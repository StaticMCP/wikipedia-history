Commodore Charles Elliot's squadron chased the war-junks at Escape Creek (present-day East River) and then, once the British ships were grounded as the river narrowed, they chased them in the ships' boats until all the junks had been overhauled.\nGallery\nFile:Map of Canton River.jpg|Map of Canton area showing Escape Creek near the top\nFile:Map of Escape Creek.jpg|Map of the engagements\nFile:Attack on the junks.jpg|Attack on the junks\nFile:Burning of 27 junks taken in Escape Creek.jpg|Burning of 27 captured junks\nReferences\nBibliography\n*Behan, T.
