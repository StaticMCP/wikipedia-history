The initiating event of the sub-franchise is \"The Great Disaster\" involving the antagonistic \"space Vikings\" known as the Nihil and the subsequent intervention of the Jedi.\nThe series' novel series is divided into three phases. The first, Light of the Jedi, ran from January 2021 to February 2022. The second phase, Quest of the Jedi, started in October 2022. The third phase, Trials of the Jedi, began in November 2023 with the release of George Mann's novel The Eye of Darkness. The series' television series includes Young Jedi Adventures (2023–present) and The Acolyte (2024).\nPremise\nThe High Republic era was a golden age for both the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order who were both at the height of their power. Importantly, it was a time of peace for the Republic and the Republic was expanding into previously unreached areas in the Outer Rim. The Jedi Order worked as a distinct entity separate from the Republic and the Order was at its most diverse and transparent, donning golden robes and wielding the Force to a much greater extent. The Jedi were primarily based on Coruscant but a number of Jedi Temples were scattered across the galaxy on every major Republic planet.\nHistory\n\"Project Luminous\" was started in September 2018 with invitations to Star Wars authors including Claudia Gray, Justina Ireland, Daniel José Older, Cavan Scott, and Charles Soule to Skywalker Ranch, with Lucasfilm offering them a \"blank slate\" in determining the project. Lucasfilm had teased \"Project Luminous\" in April 2019, prompting intense fan speculation.\nOn February 24, 2020, Lucasfilm announced a new series of comics and novels called Star Wars: The High Republic, intended to be a publisher-only multimedia project, unrelated to any films in development. A trailer was released showing events taking place two centuries before the events of Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace. It shows the Jedi at the height of their power and rise of the Nihil.\nThe series was originally intended to debut with the Light of the Jedi novel in August 2020, a few days before Star Wars Celebration 2020, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic until January 2021. The first chapter of the novel was released in June 2020 through IGN. In November 2020, the second chapter of the novel was released on StarWars.com, followed by the next six through the Penguin Random House website. In December 2020, Disney released a free digital sampler of early chapters of the first phase of High Republic books and comics, revealing the main characters for each series.\nOn Disney Investor Day 2020, it was revealed that Leslye Headland's The Acolyte series for Disney+ would take place during the late High Republic era. Shortly after, Tencent began releasing Star Wars: The Vow of Silver Dawn, an e-book created specifically for Chinese audiences in collaboration with Lucasfilm. The Vow of Silver Dawn also takes place near the end of the High Republic era. Lucasfilm has stated that they currently have no plans for an English translation and release.\nOn January 4, 2021, a day prior to the release of the first novels, Lucasfilm hosted a launch event where it gave more information regarding the works released following the first batch of novels and comics. This included the fact that Star Wars Insider would have monthly short stories as part of the publishing initiative, written by Scott and Ireland, several newly announced books releasing in the summer of 2021, and that the first phase of The High Republic would last into 2022. The second phase was given the name Quest of the Jedi, and the third, Trials of the Jedi.\nWorks\nPhase I — Light of the Jedi\nShort stories\n* \"Go Together\" (December 15, 2020 – February 10, 2021), a two-part story written by Charles Soule, and published in Star Wars Insider #199 and #200 from Titan Magazines.
