It lies on the banks of Indigo Creek, a tributary of the Murray River. The town’s commercial centre is around High Street.\nHistory\nThe township was surveyed in 1857 by Assistant Surveyor William Snell Chauncy.\nIt was settled in 1860, and the Post Office opened on 1 August 1860.\nGustav and William Baumgarten were early landowners in the area. After serving time for receiving stolen horses from bushranger Ned Kelly, William established a large winery named Bogong on the Murray River.\nIn January 1952, a bushfire destroyed ten houses, a shop, an old mill, and the Methodist church.\nHistoric resources\nThe town contains several historic buildings, including its post office, general store, Cheesely's Bootmakers shop, and a rebuilt hotel. The former Barnawartha railway station, opened in 1873 and closed in 1985, still has its original platform and building. In 1982, a fatal collision occurred nearby between a goods train and the Spirit of Progress.\nEducation\nBarnawartha Primary School, located at 11–17 Stanley Street, provides education from Prep to Year 6. The school is part of the Upper Hume Network and received a new inclusive playground in 2021 via the Victorian Government’s Inclusive Schools Fund.\nSports\nThe former golf course has been repurposed into a general-use recreation reserve managed by the Barnawartha Recreation Reserve Committee of Management.\nIn early 2024, two multipurpose hard courts (netball and tennis) were completed. Upgrades included LED lighting, seating, shelters, fencing and new acrylic surfaces. The $779,782 project was jointly funded by:\n* Victorian Government: $491,982\n* Indigo Shire Council: $282,800\n* Barnawartha Netball Club: $5,000\nIn mid‑2025, the oval lighting upgrade was approved to install 100 lux LED floodlights. The project was funded by:\n* Victorian Government: $250,000\n* Indigo Shire Council: $74,474\n* Barnawartha Football Netball Club: $25,000\nBarnawartha is also home to the Indigo Creek Fishing Club and various informal recreational spaces.\nBarnawartha Football Netball Club\nBarnawartha has an Australian rules football and netball team competing in the Tallangatta & District Football League. The club's first recorded match was in 1894 against Gooramadda. The club played informal matches until joining the Ovens and Murray Junior Football Association in 1910, and lost the 1911 grand final to Howlong.\nIt later played in the Chiltern & District Football Association from 1912 to 1957 (with breaks during wartime) before joining the T&DFL in 1958. Premierships were won in 2002 and 2013.\nAttractions\nNearby is the Chiltern-Mt Pilot National Park, covering 21,565 hectares. The park features the Mt Pilot Range, Woolshed Falls, historic goldfields, and rare flora and fauna including the swift parrot and regent honeyeater.\nThe area includes Frying Pan Creek, Indigo Creek, Mount Lady Franklin, and bush camping at Richardson’s Bend (known locally as \"Richo's\") on the Murray River, popular for fishing and boating.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://websites.mygameday.app/club_info.cgi?c=1-6200-80933-0-0 Barnawartha Football Netball Club]\n* [https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/254988067 1939 Barnawartha FC team photo]\n* [https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/258123256 1946 Barnawartha-Chiltern FC team photo]"
