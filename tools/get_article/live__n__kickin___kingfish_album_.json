It was released as an LP in 1977 by Jet Records.  It was released on CD in Germany in 1989.\nThough guitarist Bob Weir played with the band during the performance, he had returned to playing full time with the Grateful Dead by the time the album was produced. With the goal of forging a separate identity for Kingfish, tracks containing Weir's playing and singing were therefore removed from the mix, except where absolutely crucial to continuity or where his guitar or vocals bled onto the drum track.\n}}\n\n---\n\n## Live 'N' Kickin' (Kingfish album)\n\n#REDIRECT Live 'n' Kickin' (Kingfish album)"
