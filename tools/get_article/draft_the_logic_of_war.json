Developed by Simon Chkuaseli, it argues that war arises not primarily from choice or accident but from necessity.\nThe theory emphasizes three recurring forces—fear, interest, and survival—as the drivers of conflict when other options are exhausted.\nThe framework positions itself in the realist tradition and draws on the work of Thucydides, Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Clausewitz.\nIt reinterprets these insights for contemporary geopolitics, suggesting that diplomacy and balance-of-power arrangements often collapse under structural pressures of compulsion.\nOrigins of the theory\nChkuaseli developed The Logic of War within the broader intellectual tradition of political realism.\nThe framework is presented as a reinterpretation of classical insights about necessity, compulsion, and power in international relations.\nThucydides’ account of the Peloponnesian War provided an early model for understanding how necessity shapes conflict. The famous Melian Dialogue, in which the Athenians declare that “the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must,” illustrates the realist claim that power, rather than justice, determines outcomes in war.\nMachiavelli’s writings reinforced the idea of necessity as central to political life. In The Prince, he argued that rulers must often act against conventional morality in order to preserve the state.\nHobbes’s vision of the “state of nature,” in which individuals exist in constant fear and insecurity, offered a parallel for relations among sovereign states, where no higher authority guarantees peace.\nClausewitz’s theory that war is “the continuation of politics by other means” shaped the modern realist view of conflict as a structural feature of political life.\nModern realist scholarship, including E. H. Carr’s critique of utopianism in The Twenty Years’ Crisis and Kenneth Waltz’s structural realism, further contextualizes Chkuaseli’s argument that international order is fragile and prone to collapse under compulsion.\nCore principles\nChkuaseli identifies a set of \"laws of necessity\" that explain why states are compelled toward conflict. These principles reflect enduring features of political life that, according to the theory, limit the durability of peace.\nFear\nFear is presented as the most immediate driver of war. In the absence of a higher authority, states act under conditions of uncertainty about the intentions of others. This echoes Hobbes’s description of the “state of nature,” where insecurity compels individuals to take precautionary measures that often lead to conflict. In international relations, this dynamic is sometimes described as the security dilemma.\nInterest\nAlongside fear, states pursue material and strategic interests that bring them into competition. Drawing on Machiavelli’s insistence that rulers must secure advantage to preserve the state, the theory emphasizes the centrality of interest in explaining recurrent conflict. Interest may include control over resources, influence over trade routes, or strategic positioning against rivals.\nSurvival\nSurvival is described as the ultimate necessity that underpins all state behavior. Following Hobbes’s principle that the first law of nature is self-preservation, Chkuaseli argues that states will enter conflict if their existence appears threatened. Waltz’s structural realism similarly holds that survival is the primary goal of states within an anarchic international system.\nFragility of peace\nThe theory also highlights the inherent fragility of peace. Thucydides noted that treaties and balances of power are temporary, sustained only as long as they align with the interests of the powerful. Carr’s critique of interwar diplomacy reinforced the view that norms and institutions cannot override material compulsion. Chkuaseli argues that peace often represents a temporary suspension of conflict, rather than its resolution.\nRelation to classical realism\nThe Logic of War situates itself within the tradition of classical realism by reinterpreting earlier thinkers for contemporary contexts.\nThucydides\nThe theory draws on Thucydides’ analysis of the Peloponnesian War, particularly the Melian Dialogue, which underscores that power and necessity often outweigh appeals to justice. This dialogue has been described by scholars as one of the clearest realist statements in classical literature.\nMachiavelli\nFrom Machiavelli, the framework adopts the principle that rulers act according to necessity rather than virtue. The Prince emphasizes that leaders may need to disregard conventional morality in order to preserve the state, a theme echoed in Chkuaseli’s view of compulsion as a structural force in politics.\nHobbes\nHobbes’s conception of the “state of nature” as a realm of fear and insecurity provides a foundation for the theory’s emphasis on survival. Just as individuals in Hobbes’s natural condition live in constant uncertainty, so too do states in the anarchic international system.\nClausewitz\nClausewitz’s assertion that war is “the continuation of politics by other means” underpins the theory’s rejection of the idea that war is an aberration. The Logic of War reinterprets this insight by emphasizing the compulsive forces—fear, interest, survival—that push states toward conflict when politics fails.\nContemporary applications\nWhile developed within a classical realist framework, The Logic of War has been presented as a lens for understanding modern international politics.\nIt emphasizes that structural forces of fear, interest, and survival continue to shape conflicts despite the growth of international institutions and norms.\nAnalysts of international relations have similarly argued that contemporary security dilemmas reflect enduring realist dynamics. John H. Herz’s concept of the security dilemma and Robert Jervis’s work on misperception highlight how fear and uncertainty may drive escalation even when no state seeks war.\nThe theory has also been linked to debates on the fragility of peace settlements. E. H. Carr criticized the utopianism of interwar diplomacy, noting that treaties without sufficient power to enforce them were unlikely to last. Kenneth Waltz’s structural realism similarly holds that the absence of a central authority ensures that states remain preoccupied with survival and power balancing.\nIn this context, Chkuaseli’s framework is positioned as a restatement of realist principles for the twenty-first century, emphasizing that war emerges less from deliberate choice than from the compulsions inherent in the international system."
