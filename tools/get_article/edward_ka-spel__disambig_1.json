He is best known for his work with the band The Legendary Pink Dots, which he co-founded.\nKa-Spel is also known for his work on The Tear Garden with Skinny Puppy's cEvin Key. In 2017, he collaborated with Amanda Palmer on the album I Can Spin a Rainbow.\nKa-spel's recordings are often of a limited number and only available through an extensive and devoted mail-order system at Soleilmoon. He has also released numerous cassette-only special recordings, usually including materials out-of-print on earlier labels along with new releases. He often appears on stage barefoot, wearing a long scarf and either pink or black glasses. Early in his career, he drew black lines on his face and arms.\nBiography\nKa-Spel is best known as the lead singer, keyboard and electronics player, songwriter and co-founder of the band The Legendary Pink Dots, in which he was initially known as D'Archangel, Prophet Q'Sepel and other pseudonyms. He has also released numerous solo albums (initially featuring other members of the Legendary Pink Dots, and including contributions from Steven Stapleton), and has worked in various side projects, including The Tear Garden (with cEvin Key of Skinny Puppy), and Mimir (with Phil Knight, Christoph Heemann, Jim O'Rourke and others). An album with 48 Cameras, Songs from the Marriage of Heaven & Hell was released in 2019.\nKa-Spel's solo albums range from abstract electronic noise to more traditional pop songs, incorporating diverse elements of psychedelia, industrial, avant garde, experimental electronic, art pop, classical music, folk (nursery songs), sampling, noise, collage, music concrete, etc. His lyrics have been described as mystically bizarre and ambiguous, and incorporate recurrent themes from his own personal mythos. Ka-Spel's songwriting has been compared to that of Syd Barrett and early Pink Floyd, though the artist describes the comparison as being a coincidence, not a direct influence. Ka-Spel has cited Iannis Xenakis, the Beatles, Nurse With Wound, David Bowie, Brainticket, Can, The Residents, Magma, and Throbbing Gristle as significant influences.\nAssociated acts\n* The Legendary Pink Dots\n* The Tear Garden\n* Terminal Kaleidoscope\n* Mimir\n* Nurse with Wound\n* The Silverman\n* Mimir\n* Twilight Circus Dub Soundsystem\n* Strange Attractor\n* Niels Van Hoorn\nDiscography (selected)\nAlbums\n* (1984) Laugh, China Doll\n* (1985) Eyes!, China Doll\n* (1986) Chyekk, China Doll\n* (1987) AaΔzhyd, China Doll\n* (1988) Khataclimici, China Doll\n* (1991) Tanith & the Lion Tree\n* (1995) The Scriptures of Illumina\n* (1995) The Textures of Illumina\n* (1995) DNA LE DRAW D-KEE (with Elke Skelter as DNA LE DRAW D-KEE)\n* (1998) The Blue Room\n* (2000) Red Letters\n* (2001) Absence of Evidence\n* (2001) ''Caste O' Graye Skreeens\n* (2002) O'er a Shalabast'r Tyde Strolt Ay\n* (2004) Pieces Of ∞\n* (2005) O Darkness!
