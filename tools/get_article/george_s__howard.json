In 1925 he became the band director of Ohio Wesleyan University (where he became a member of Phi Kappa Tau fraternity), and he earned Bachelor of Arts in Music Education from that institution in 1929.

In 1942, Howard was commissioned into the Army Specialist Corps, and in 1947 Howard's reputation as a conductor led to his commission as leader of the newly formed Air Force Band. He directed the USAF Band and Orchestra until his retirement with the rank of colonel in 1963. During his tenure he established several performing groups,including  Airmen of Note, Singing Sergeants, Strolling Strings, and Women in the Air Force Band. He also founded the USAF Bandsman School.\nHoward was elected President of the American Bandmasters Association in 1956, and became an Honorary Life Member in 1984. He served as Honorary Life President from 1986 until his death in 1995. The John Philip Sousa Foundation awards the Colonel George S. Howard Citation of Musical Excellence for Military Concert Bands in Col. Howard's memory and the Air Force Band's annual young artists competition is named in his memory.\nOn January 29, 2005, the service road at the Reading-Lancaster Interchange of the Pennsylvania Turnpike was officially named in his honor.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://hdl.handle.net/1903.1/19219 Colonel George S.
