Military formations within the British Empire were generally not static and were composed of a changing mix of units from across Britain, its colonies and the dominions. As a result military formations within the Empire and Commonwealth are not easily attributable to specific Imperial or national entities and naming conventions do not necessarily correlate with modern country names.\n* \"formed from\" indicates that a new division was created in part from another division\n* \"formerly\" indicates a simple division name change\nAustralia\n* 1st Australian Infantry\n* 2nd Australian Infantry\n* 3rd Australian Infantry\n* 4th Australian Infantry\n* 5th Australian Infantry\n* 6th Australian Infantry\n* 7th Australian Infantry\n* 8th Australian Infantry\n* 9th Australian Infantry\n* 10th Australian Infantry\n* 11th Australian Infantry\n* 12th Australian Infantry \"Northern Territory Force\"\n* 1st Australian Armoured\n* 2nd Australian Armoured\n* 3rd Australian Armoured\nCanada\n* 1st Canadian Infantry\n* 2nd Canadian Infantry\n* 3rd Canadian Infantry\n* 3rd Canadian Infantry (CAOF)\n* 4th Canadian Infantry later 4th Canadian Armoured\n* 5th Canadian Infantry later 5th Canadian Armoured\n* 6th Canadian Infantry\n* 6th Canadian Infantry (CAPF)\n* 7th Canadian Infantry\n* 8th Canadian Infantry\n* Veterans Guard\n* 4th Canadian Armoured formed from 4th Canadian Infantry\n* 5th Canadian Armoured formed from  5th Canadian Infantry\nNew Zealand\n* 1st New Zealand Infantry\n* 2nd New Zealand Infantry\n* 3rd New Zealand Infantry\n* 4th New Zealand Infantry\n* 5th New Zealand Infantry\nSouth Africa\n* 1st Mounted Command\n* 1st South African Infantry later 6th South African Armoured\n* 2nd South African Infantry\n* 3rd South African Infantry\n* 6th South African Armoured\nSee also\n* List of British divisions in World War II\n* List of Indian divisions in World War II\n* List of British Empire brigades of the Second World War\n* List of British Empire corps of the Second World War\n* Military history of the British Commonwealth in the Second World War\nNotes\nReferences\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192416/http://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/documents.php?aid=166&nid=23&start=5 Infantry Divisions (British Army and British Indian Army) 1930 - 1956]\n# [https://web.archive.org/web/20051028194232/http://regiments.org/formations/lists/ukdivxref.htm British Army formations]\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051108051400/http://home.adelphia.net/~dryan67/orders/army.html British, Commonwealth, and Empire Orders of Battle on 3 September 1939]"
