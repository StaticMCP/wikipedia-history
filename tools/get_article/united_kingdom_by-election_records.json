Earlier exceptional results are listed separately.\nParliaments of England, Scotland, Ireland and the various unions of these Kingdoms had been assembled since the medieval period, though these bodies only gradually evolved to be democratically elected by the populace and records are incomplete. England and Wales had numerous \"rotten boroughs\" with tiny and tightly controlled electorates until the Reform Act 1832. The most recent significant expansions of the electoral franchise were the Representation of the People Act 1918 which allowed some women to vote for the first time and greatly expanded the franchise of men, overall more than doubling the size of the electorate, and the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928 which expanded the franchise of women to be equal to that of men.\nFurthermore, there are various additional factors complicating comparisons between earlier results and modern cases. Among the most significant aspects of historical elections which are no longer present are:\n*Frequent interventions and withdrawals of parties in different seats.\n*Frequent coalitions between parties, splits within parties and floor-crossing by members.\n*Uncontested elections and truces between parties, in particular during both World Wars.\n*Generally more significant competition from independent candidates and minor parties.\n*Multi-member seats and university seats (abolished 1950).\n*Higher frequency of by-elections, partly due to the practice of often uncontested ministerial by-elections which ended in 1926.\n*Generally higher turnouts, although several wartime elections exhibited the lowest recorded turnouts.\n*Generally higher variation in size of constituency electorates.\nSince 1945, the legal and general political situation regarding by-elections has been broadly stable, allowing for meaningful comparison of records.\nThese records include those from Northern Ireland. However, the politics of Northern Ireland is mostly separate from that of Great Britain so comparisons can be problematic.\nGlossary\nFor comparison purposes the following definitions have been adopted.\n*Gain - victory by a party that was not victorious at the immediate previous election\n*Loss - defeat of a party that was victorious at the immediate previous election\n*Hold - victory by a party that was victorious at the immediate previous election\n*Win - victory by a party. ambiguous term that could mean either a gain or a hold\n*Incumbent - the party that held the seat at the immediately previous election, irrespective of any intervening change of candidate or candidate's change of party\n*Third party - In England, since 1922, the \"third party\" has been the Liberal Party and its successor, the Liberal Democrats. Additionally, in Scotland and Wales the Scottish National Party (SNP) and Plaid Cymru are also considered to be third parties. Prior to 1922, the third party was the Labour Party.\n*Minor party - parties smaller than the third party\n*Uncontested - an election where only one candidate is put forward. No votes are actually cast and the candidate is by definition the victor.\nNumerical records\nFor more information about what is meant by the term \"swing\", see Swing (United Kingdom)\nLargest swings in percentage share of votes\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Election\n!Swing\n!colspan=2|From\n!colspan=2|To\n|-\n|1983 Bermondsey by-election\n|44.2\n|\n|\n|-\n|2014 Clacton by-election\n|44.1\n|\n|\n|-\n|1973 Lincoln by-election\n|43.0\n|\n|\n|-\n|2024 Rochdale by-election\n|41.8\n|\n|\n|-\n|1967 Hamilton by-election\n|37.9\n|\n|\n|-\n|2012 Bradford West by-election\n|36.6\n|\n|\n|-\n|1993 Christchurch by-election\n|35.4\n|\n|\n|-\n|2021 North Shropshire by-election\n|34.2\n|\n|\n|-\n|1988 Glasgow Govan by-election\n|33.1\n|\n|\n|-\n|1976 Newcastle-upon-Tyne Central by-election\n|32.8\n|\n|\n|-\n|1972 Sutton and Cheam by-election\n|32.6\n|\n|\n|-\n|1979 Liverpool Edge Hill by-election\n|30.2\n|\n|\n|-\n|2022 Tiverton and Honiton by-election\n|29.9\n|\n|\n|-\n|1994 Dudley West by-election\n|29.2\n|\n|\n|-\n|2023 Somerton and Frome by-election\n|29.0\n|\n|\n|-\n|2003 Brent East by-election\n|28.9\n|\n|\n|-\n|2024 Wellingborough by-election\n|28.5\n|\n|\n|-\n|1993 Newbury by-election\n|28.4\n|\n|\n|-\n|2014 Rochester and Strood by-election\n|28.3\n|\n|\n|-\n|2004 Birmingham Hodge Hill by-election\n|26.7\n|\n|\n|-\n|1962 Orpington by-election\n|26.3\n|\n|\n|-\n|2024 Blackpool South by-election\n|26.3\n|\n|\n|-\n|1973 Ripon by-election\n|25.3\n|\n|\n|-\n|2021 Chesham and Amersham by-election\n|25.1\n|\n|\n|-\n|1991 Ribble Valley by-election\n|24.7\n|\n|\n|-\n|1981 Croydon North West by-election\n|24.2\n|\n|\n|-\n| 2023 Tamworth by-election\n| 23.9\n|\n|\n|-\n| 2023 Selby and Ainsty by-election\n| 23.7\n|\n|\n|-\n|1994 Dagenham by-election\n|23.1\n|\n|\n|-\n|1999 Hamilton South by-election\n|22.6\n|\n|\n|-\n|1976 Walsall North by-election\n|22.5\n|\n|\n|-\n|2008 Glasgow East by-election\n|22.5\n|\n|\n|-\n|1996 South East Staffordshire by-election\n|22.1\n|\n|\n|-\n|1994 Barking by-election\n|22.0\n|\n|\n|-\n|2016 Richmond Park by-election\n|21.7\n|\n|\n|-\n|2004 Leicester South by-election\n|21.5\n|\n|\n|-\n|1990 Mid Staffordshire by-election\n|21.3\n|\n|\n|-\n|1968 Dudley by-election\n|21.2\n|\n|\n|-\n|1977 Ashfield by-election\n|20.9\n|\n|\n|-\n|1999 Leeds Central by-election\n|20.5\n|\n|\n|-\n|2023 Mid Bedfordshire by-election\n|20.5\n|\n|\n|-\n|2023 Rutherglen and Hamilton West by-election\n|20.4\n|\n|\n|-\n|1990 Eastbourne by-election\n|20.0\n|\n|\n|}\nLargest swings to an incumbent governing party\nIt is rare to see any swing towards the governing party in by-elections.

However, the 1931 election had no Labour Party candidate, and the MP, R. C. Wallhead, had previously been elected as a Labour candidate in prior elections, when the ILP was affiliated to Labour. Prior to his death, Wallhead joined the Labour Party, so this result could be classed as a Labour hold.\nThe 1919 East Antrim by-election saw the Irish Unionist party face its first Unionist opposition in the seat since 1906 (in the 1918 general election the heavily unionist area gave the Irish Unionist 94.6% of the vote in a contest with a Sinn Féin candidate). An Independent Unionist candidate won the seat, with the Irish Unionist share dropping by 52.8%\nWorst results for other parties:\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Election\n!Fall: %\n!colspan=2|Party\n!colspan=2|Result\n|-\n|2021 Hartlepool by-election\n|24.6\n|\n|  gain from Labour\n|-\n|1982 Belfast South by-election\n|22.4\n|\n|  hold\n|-\n|2014 Heywood and Middleton by-election\n|17.6\n|\n|  hold\n|-\n|2023 Rutherglen and Hamilton West by-election\n|16.6\n|\n|  gain\n|-\n|2009 Glasgow North East by-election\n|14.0\n|\n|  gain from Speaker\n|-\n|2017 Copeland by-election\n|9.0\n|\n|  gain from Labour\n|-\n|1986 Newry and Armagh by-election\n|7.7\n|\n|  gain from Ulster Unionist\n|-\n|1963 Swansea East by-election\n|5.3\n|\n|  hold\n|}\nLargest increase in percentage share of vote\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Election!!Increase in Share\n!colspan=2|Party\n!colspan=2|Result\n|-\n|1986 East Londonderry by-election||56.0\n|\n|  hold\n|-\n|2012 Bradford West by-election||52.8\n|\n|  gain\n|-\n|1983 Bermondsey by-election||50.9\n|\n|  gain\n|-\n|1986 South Antrim by-election||48.4\n|\n|  hold\n|-\n|1986 East Antrim by-election||47.5\n|\n|  hold\n|-\n|1986 North Antrim by-election||43.2\n|\n|  hold\n|-\n|2016 Batley and Spen by-election||42.6\n|\n|  hold\n|-\n|1972 Sutton and Cheam by-election||39.0\n|\n|  gain\n|-\n|1993 Christchurch by-election||38.6\n|\n|  gain\n|-\n|1988 Glasgow Govan by-election||38.4\n|\n|  gain\n|-\n|2022 Tiverton and Honiton by-election||38.1\n|\n|  gain\n|-\n|2021 North Shropshire by-election||37.1\n|\n|  gain\n|-\n|1979 Liverpool Edge Hill by-election||36.8\n|\n|  gain\n|-\n|2014 Heywood and Middleton by-election||36.1\n|\n|  hold\n|-\n|1986 Belfast East by-election||35.7\n|\n|  hold\n|-\n|1986 Belfast North by-election||35.3\n|\n|  hold\n|-\n|1973 Glasgow Govan by-election||31.6\n|\n|  gain\n|-\n|1986 Lagan Valley by-election||31.5\n|\n|  hold\n|-\n|2021 Chesham and Amersham by-election||30.4\n|\n|  gain\n|-\n|1973 Ripon by-election||30.4\n|\n|  gain\n|-\n|2016 Richmond Park by-election||30.3\n|\n|  gain\n|-\n|1981 Croydon North West by-election||29.5\n|\n|  gain\n|-\n|1968 Caerphilly by-election||29.3\n|\n|  hold\n|-\n|2003 Brent East by-election||28.5\n|\n|  gain\n|-\n|1994 Dudley West by-election||28.0\n|\n|  gain\n|-\n|1987 Greenwich by-election||27.9\n|\n|  gain\n|-\n|1972 Merthyr Tydfil by-election||27.4\n|\n|  gain\n|-\n|1966 Carmarthen by-election||27.4\n|\n|  gain\n|-\n|1991 Ribble Valley by-election||27.1\n|\n|  gain\n|-\n|1994 Monklands East by-election||26.9\n|\n|  hold\n|-\n|-\n|2022 Southend West by-election||26.9\n|\n|  hold\n|-\n|2004 Birmingham Hodge Hill by-election||26.1\n|\n|  hold\n|-\n|2008 Glasgow East by-election||26.1\n|\n|  gain\n|}\nLargest winning share of the vote\nWinning shares of the vote above 90%, since 1918:\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Candidate\n!colspan=2|Party\n!Election\n!Votes\n!% Share\n|-\n|Ernest Gates\n|\n|1940 Middleton and Prestwich by-election\n|32,036\n|98.7\n|-\n|Ian Paisley\n|\n|1986 North Antrim by-election\n|33,937\n|97.4\n|-\n|John Craik-Henderson\n|\n|1940 Leeds North East by-election\n|23,882\n|97.1\n|-\n|Charles Key\n|\n|1940 Bow and Bromley by-election\n|11,594\n|95.8\n|-\n|John Taylor\n|\n|1986 Strangford by-election\n|32,627\n|94.2\n|-\n|Clifford Forsythe\n|\n|1986 South Antrim by-election\n|30,087\n|94.1\n|-\n|William Ross\n|\n|1986 East Londonderry by-election\n|30,922\n|93.9\n|-\n|Arthur Woodburn\n|\n|1939 Clackmannanshire and East Stirlingshire by-election\n|15,645\n|93.7\n|-\n|Spencer Summers\n|\n|1940 Northampton by-election\n|16,587\n|93.4\n|-\n|Harry Thorneycroft\n|\n|1942 Manchester Clayton by-election\n|8,892\n|93.3\n|-\n|James Hollins\n|\n|1940 Silvertown by-election\n|14,343\n|92.8\n|-\n|Francis Douglas\n|\n|1940 Battersea North by-election\n|9,947\n|92.6\n|-\n|Henry Willink\n|\n|1940 Croydon North by-election\n|14,163\n|90.7\n|-\n|James Henry Molyneaux\n|\n|1986 Lagan Valley by-election\n|32,514\n|90.7\n|-\n|}\nLargest numerical majority overturned\nMajorities over 9,000 votes overturned:\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!Candidate\n!

Consequently, only those eligible to vote in the constituency at the outbreak of war were eligible to vote in the by-elections, and many of those were physically unable to vote, as they were located elsewhere; in addition the major parties did not compete against each other.

By-elections often attract \"fringe\" or novelty candidates, single-issue candidates, or independents. As with nominations in a general election, candidates must pay a £500 deposit, which is only refunded if the candidate wins 5% of the votes cast.\nAll by-elections with more than ten candidates are listed. Elections are listed in alphabetical order.

His first and last by-election victories were 33 years and 3 months apart.\nFormer cabinet minister and European Commissioner Roy Jenkins fought two different by-elections for the Social Democratic Party only eight months apart. He narrowly failed in the 1981 Warrington by-election before winning the 1982 Glasgow Hillhead by-election. He had been first elected as a Labour MP almost 34 years previously in the 1948 Southwark Central by-election.\nFormer Speaker of the House of Commons, Betty Boothroyd finally secured election at her third by-election attempt at the 1973 West Bromwich by-election. She had previously failed in the 1957 Leicester South East by-election and the 1968 Nelson and Colne by-election as well as the general elections of 1959 and 1970.\nJohn Bickley of UKIP contested three by-elections (all in Greater Manchester) within two years - Wythenshawe and Sale East in February 2014, Heywood and Middleton in October 2014 and Oldham West and Royton in December 2015. He was defeated on each occasion, coming closest in Heywood and Middleton where he lost by less than 700 votes. Bickley also contested Heywood and Middleton at the 2015 general election, making a total of four parliamentary elections contested in fewer than 24 months.\nMinor parties and independents\nPerennial fringe candidates include such personalities as Bill Boaks, who ran in 19 by-elections. His highest vote was at the 1982 Beaconsfield by-election with 99 votes. Screaming Lord Sutch was for most of his career the leader of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party, and competed in 34 by-elections (1 for the National Teenage Party) between 1963 and 1997. His highest vote total was 1,114 at the 1994 Rotherham by-election. Lindi St Clair of the Corrective Party contested eleven by-elections without success, her highest total being 216 votes as 'Lady Whiplash' at the 1990 Eastbourne by-election. Sutch's successor as leader of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party, Alan \"Howling Laud\" Hope, has, as of the 2023 Uxbridge and South Ruislip by-election, contested twenty-one by-elections.\nUnder various ballot paper descriptions, David Bishop of the Church of the Militant Elvis label stood at seven by-elections, receiving 99 votes at the 2012 Corby by-election, an increase over his previous high of 93 at the 2011 Feltham and Heston by-election.\nOn 23 January 1986, Wesley Robert Williamson (who changed his name to Peter Barry) stood in four simultaneous by-elections in Northern Ireland.\nPre-1945\nArthur Henderson was distinguished in being successful in no fewer than five by-elections in different seats, in Barnard Castle, Widnes, Newcastle upon Tyne East, Burnley, and Clay Cross.\nJoseph Gibbins is the only person in modern times to gain the same seat twice in two different by-elections. He triumphed for Labour in the 1924 and 1935 Liverpool West Toxteth by-elections.\nWilliam O'Brien won four by-elections, in Mallow in 1883, North East Cork in 1887 and then Cork City in 1904 and 1914. On these last two occasions, he was re-elected having resigned the seat.\nPrime Minister Winston Churchill contested five by-elections in his long career:\n*1899 Oldham by-election in which he was not elected\n*1908 Manchester North West by-election where he was defeated\n*1908 Dundee by-election where he was elected\n*1917 Dundee by-election where he was re-elected.\n*1924 Westminster Abbey by-election in which he was unsuccessful\nJohn Wilkes won the 1757 Aylesbury by-election, and was then elected in the Middlesex by-elections of February, March and April 1769, on each occasion being subsequently expelled from the House of Commons.\nFormer MPs making a comeback at a by-election\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Election\n!MP\n!colspan=2|Party\n!notes\n|-\n|2024 Rochdale by-election1\n|rowspan=2| George Galloway\n|\n|returns after losing Bradford West in the 2015 general election, and failing to win Manchester Gorton in 2017 and West Bromwich East in 2019.\n|-\n|2012 Bradford West by-election1\n|\n|returns after failing to win a seat in the 2010 general election.\n|-\n|2000 South Antrim by-election1\n|William McCrea\n|\n|returns after losing his Mid Ulster seat in the 1997 general election.\n|-\n|1999 Kensington and Chelsea by-election\n|Michael Portillo\n|\n|returns after losing his Enfield Southgate seat at the 1997 general election.\n|-\n|1997 Beckenham by-election\n|Jacqui Lait\n|\n|returns after losing her Hastings and Rye seat at the 1997 general election.\n|-\n|1988 Epping Forest by-election\n|Steve Norris\n|\n|returns after losing his Oxford East seat at the 1987 general election.\n|-\n|1988 Glasgow Govan by-election1\n|Jim Sillars\n|\n|He had first sat as a Labour MP (later as Scottish Labour) for South Ayrshire between 1970 and 1979.\n|-\n|1984 Chesterfield by-election\n|Tony Benn\n|\n|returns after losing his redrawn Bristol East seat at the 1983 general election.\n|-\n|1982 Beaconsfield by-election\n|Tim Smith\n|\n|returns after losing his Ashfield seat in the 1979 general election.\n|-\n|1982 Glasgow Hillhead by-election2:\n|Roy Jenkins\n|\n|returns after a spell as European Commissioner, then co-founding the Social Democratic Party (SDP).

He had been elected as a National Liberal Party candidate. She won as a Conservative so this could arguably be classed as the first gain by a woman.\nFirst ethnic minority by-election victors\nWhilst the first ethnic minority Members of Parliament were elected at general elections as early as the 1890s, it would be almost 100 years before one was returned at a by-election.\nThe first ethnic minority candidate to be elected in a by-election was Ashok Kumar who gained the 1991 Langbaurgh by-election for Labour.\n*David Lammy held the 2000 Tottenham by-election for Labour.\n*Mark Hendrick held the 2000 Preston by-election for Labour.\n*Parmjit Singh Gill gained the 2004 Leicester South by-election for the Liberal Democrats.\n*Seema Malhotra held the 2011 Feltham and Heston by-election for Labour, the first woman to win it.\nThe first by-election in which all three major-party candidates were from the ethnic minorities was the 2007 Ealing Southall by-election, held by Labour.\nFirst by-election victors from specific religions\nWhen the UK Parliament was established in 1801, non-Anglicans were prevented from taking their seats as MPs under the Test Act 1672. However, Methodists took communion at Anglican churches until 1795, and some continued to do so, and many Presbyterians were prepared to accept Anglican communion, thus ensuring that members of these creeds were represented in the Parliament. Some Unitarians were also elected.\nThe first by-election victor (and first ever MP) to be an adherent of the Eastern Orthodox Church was The Honourable Frederick North who was elected in 1792 for Banbury (to succeed his brother who had entered the House of Lords), having converted to the faith the previous year.\nThe first Roman Catholic by-election victor in the UK Parliament was Daniel O'Connell in the 1828 Clare by-election. He was not permitted to take his seat until the following year.\nThe first atheist by-election victor was Charles Bradlaugh, at the 1881 Northampton by-election. As an atheist, Bradlaugh was not allowed to swear the Oath of Allegiance, and the by-election was re-run in 1882 and 1884. Both were also won by Bradlaugh, who eventually was able to take his seat after the 1885 general election.\n* David Salomons was the first Jewish by-election victor, at the 1851 Greenwich by-election.\n* Terry Rooney was the first Mormon by-election victor, at the 1990 Bradford North by-election.\n* Parmjit Singh Gill became the first Sikh by-election victor, at the 2004 Leicester South by-election.\n* Virendra Sharma became the first Hindu by-election victor, at the 2007 Ealing Southall by-election.\n* Rosena Allin-Khan was the first Muslim by-election victor, at the 2016 Tooting by-election.\nPhysically disabled by-election victors\nMost physically disabled MPs in the history of the parliament entered in the intakes of general elections. Those known to have been disabled when entering parliament at by-elections are rarer and include:\n*John Horne Tooke, who lost sight of an eye in a boyhood fight, won the 1801 Old Sarum by-election.\n*Fulk Greville Howard, who lost sight of an eye in the Helder expedition in 1799, won the 1808 Castle Rising by-election.\n*Sir William Carr Beresford, who lost sight of an eye in an accident on military service in 1786, won the 1811 County Waterford by-election.\n*Samuel Shepherd, increasingly deaf from 1790, won the 1814 Dorchester by-election.\n*Arthur MacMurrough Kavanagh, born without hands and feet, won the 1866 Wicklow County by-election.\n*Michael Davitt, who lost his right arm in a factory accident in 1857, won the 1882 Meath by-election, although he was disqualified from sitting because he was in prison.\n*Aubrey Herbert, who was almost blind from childhood, won the 1911 South Somerset by-election.\n*Mabel Philipson, who lost sight in one eye after a car crash in 1911, who won the 1923 Berwick-upon-Tweed by-election.\n*John Dugdale, who was partly deaf from childhood, won the 1941 West Bromwich by-election.\n*Violet Bathurst, Lady Apsley, who was left permanently disabled and unable to walk by a hunting accident in 1930, won the 1943 Bristol Central by-election,\n*Cecil Manning, who lost his right arm in action in World War I, won the 1944 Camberwell North by-election.\n*Hervey Rhodes, who walked with a limp since severe wounding in World War I, won the 1945 Ashton-under-Lyne by-election.\n*William Rees-Davies, who lost his right arm in action in World War II, won the 1953 Isle of Thanet by-election.\nBy-elections losers awarded seats on disqualification of winner\n*Malcolm St Clair, 1961 Bristol South East by-election (resigned in 1963 to enable another by-election)\n*Charles Beattie, 1955 Mid Ulster by-election (he too was disqualified a few weeks later, causing another by-election)\n*Pre-1945: Stephen Moore, March 1875 Tipperary by-election (retired in 1880)\nTwo or more former MPs contest by-election\n* 2024 Rochdale by-election\n* 2021 Hartlepool by-election1 (three former MPs)\n* 2008 Haltemprice and Howden by-election2\n* 1997 Winchester by-election\n* 1986 Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election\n* 1982 Beaconsfield by-election\n* 1981 Warrington by-election\n* 1969 Brighton Pavilion by-election\n* 1965 Salisbury by-election\n* 1956 Mid Ulster by-election\n* 1948 Croydon North by-election\n* 1933 Altrincham by-election (three former MPs)\n* 1930 Glasgow Shettleston by-election\n* 1930 Nottingham Central by-election (three former MPs)\n* 1928 Cheltenham by-election\n1 Hilton Dawson, Thelma Walker, and Paul Williams\n2 Conservative MPs David Davis and Walter Sweeney\nWinner of previous election runs again\nThe usual causes of by-elections – death or resignation – mean that incumbent MPs are rarely candidates. Typically, this only occurs if an MP deliberately triggers a by-election to get a mandate for a party change, or to bring a particular issue to public attention. More rarely, it can occur if an election result is challenged in court or, since the Recall of MPs Act 2015, an MP chooses to run after a recall petition against them succeeds. Historically, such cases were more common due to ministerial by-elections (see #Re-election of ministers).\nExamples since 1945 include:\n* 2019 Brecon and Radnorshire by-election – Chris Davies ran again after a recall petition against him succeeded. Davies lost.\n* 2016 Richmond Park by-election – Zac Goldsmith resigned and ran as an independent in protest of plans to expand Heathrow Airport. Goldsmith lost.\n* 2014 Rochester and Strood by-election – Mark Reckless defected from the Conservatives to UKIP. Reckless won.\n* 2014 Clacton by-election – Douglas Carswell defected from the Conservatives to UKIP. Carswell won.\n* 2008 Haltemprice and Howden by-election – David Davis resigned to force a by-election in protest of government policy on civil liberties. Davis won.\n* 1997 Winchester by-election – Mark Oaten ran again after his previous win at the 1997 general election was declared void. Oaten won.\n* 1986 Northern Ireland by-elections – All unionist MPs in Northern Ireland resigned and ran again in protest of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. One, Jim Nicholson, lost.\n* 1982 Mitcham and Morden by-election – Bruce Douglas-Mann defected from Labour to the SDP. Douglas-Mann lost.\n* 1973 Lincoln by-election – Dick Taverne left Labour and founded Democratic Labour. Taverne won.\n* 1961 Bristol South East by-election – Tony Benn was disqualified as an MP after inheriting a peerage, which made him ineligible to sit in Commons. Benn ran again in the following by-election and won, but was disqualified. He would go on to win the 1963 Bristol South East by-election.\n* 1955 Mid Ulster by-election and 1956 Mid Ulster by-election. Tom Mitchell ran in both of these despite being disqualified from the House of Commons. He won in 1955, but was disqualified, and lost in 1956.\nFrequency and duration records\nLongest period without a by-election\nThe years 1998 and 2020 stand as the two in modern British history without any Westminster election. 1992, 1998, 2010 and 2020 are the four full calendar years in history without a single by-election.\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!From\n!To\n!Period (days)\n|-\n|1 August 2019\n|6 May 2021\n|645\n|-\n|20 November 1997\n|10 June 1999\n|567\n|-\n|7 November 1991\n|6 May 1993\n|546\n|-\n|12 March 1987\n|14 July 1988\n|489\n|-\n|14 February 2002\n|18 June 2003\n|483\n|-\n|23 February 2017\n|3 May 2018\n|434\n|-\n|12 November 2009\n|13 January 2011\n|427\n|-\n|23 May 1974\n|26 June 1975\n|399\n|-\n|18 June 2003\n|15 July 2004\n|393\n|-\n|29 June 2006\n|19 July 2007\n|385\n|}\nLongest period between a vacancy arising and a by-election writ being moved\n*1941 The Wrekin by-election: 357 days. James Baldwin-Webb was presumed killed as a result of enemy action when SS City of Benares was torpedoed on 17 September 1940; the writ was moved on 9 September 1941.\n*1941 King's Norton by-election: 327 days. Ronald Cartland was killed in action on 29–30 May 1940. Initially posted missing, his death was not presumed until January 1941. The writ was moved on 22 April 1941.\n*1941 Hitchin by-election: 272 days. Sir Arnold Wilson was presumed killed in action on 31 May 1940; the writ was moved on 27 February 1941.\n*1969 Newcastle-under-Lyme by-election: 236 days. Stephen Swingler died on 19 February 1969; the writ was moved on 13 October 1969.\n*1969 Swindon by-election: 220 days. Francis Noel-Baker resigned on 7 March 1969; the writ was moved on 13 October 1969.\nLongest period without a seat changing hands\nThe longest period without a seat changing hands in a by-election was the five years between the Conservative victories in the 1948 Glasgow Camlachie by-election and the 1953 Sunderland South by-election.\nDuring the short Parliaments of 1910, 1950-1 and 1974 no seats changed hands in a by-election.\nLongest period between by-election gains for a party\nThe Liberal Party endured 29 years without a single by-election gain between the 1929 Holland with Boston by-election and the 1958 Torrington by-election. It did not win a single by-election in the thirteen years between holding the 1945 Middlesbrough West by-election and gaining Torrington.\nUntil the 2008 Crewe and Nantwich by-election, the opposition Conservative Party had not gained a seat in almost 26 years, the last being the 1982 Mitcham and Morden by-election, which occurred during the unique circumstances of the Falklands War and the sitting Labour MP defecting to the Social Democratic Party and seeking re-election under his new party label. The Conservatives' last gain while in Opposition was 30 years previously at the 1978 Ilford North by-election.\nLabour's longest lean stretch was almost 18 years, between gaining the 1939 Brecon and Radnorshire by-election and the 1957 Lewisham North by-election.1\nAs of , the most recent gains for each currently active party were:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!! scope=\"col\" colspan=2 | Party\n!! scope=\"col\" | Date\n!! scope=\"col\" | Time since\n!! scope=\"col\" | By-election\n!! scope=\"col\" colspan=3 | Result\n|-\n|\n| 1 May 2025\n|\n| Runcorn and Helsby\n| Gain from\n|\n|-\n|\n| 2 May 2024\n|\n| Blackpool South\n| Gain from\n|\n|-\n|\n| 29 February 2024\n|\n|Rochdale\n|Gain from\n|\n|-\n|\n| 20 July 2023\n|\n| Somerton and Frome\n| Gain from\n|\n|-\n|\n| 6 May 2021\n|\n| Hartlepool\n| Gain from\n|\n|-\n|\n| 20 November 2014\n|\n| Rochester and Strood2\n| Gain from\n|\n|-\n|\n| 24 July 2008\n|\n| Glasgow East\n| Gain from\n|\n|-\n|\n| 27 April 2000\n|\n| South Antrim\n| Gain from\n|\n|-\n|\n| 23 January 1986\n|\n| Newry and Armagh\n| Gain from\n|-\n|\n| 14 July 1966\n|\n| Carmarthen\n| Gain from\n|\n|-\n|\n| 6 June 1946\n|\n| Down3\n| Gain from\n|\n|-\n|\n| 20 June 1918\n|\n| East Cavan4\n| Gain from\n|\n|}\nNotes\n1 The Labour Party were the official opposition in the Parliament elected in 1935, but after the major parties agreed an electoral truce on the outbreak of war in 1939, they did not contest any Conservative or Liberal seats for the remainder of the Parliament, a period of six years, and were members of the wartime coalition government between May 1940 and May 1945.\n2 Notional gain: incumbent Conservative stood as UKIP. No UKIP candidate has ever defeated an incumbent of a different party\n3 The UUP were also declared winners of the 1955 Mid Ulster by-election after the Sinn Féin candidate was disqualified, but the UUP candidate was also disqualified shortly after.\n4 Sinn Féin have not gained a seat at a by-election since 1918. However, the Anti H-Block party, an Irish Republican group that merged into Sinn Féin, gained Fermanagh and South Tyrone in the April 1981 by-election ( ago).\nLongest period between by-election holds for a party\nThe Conservatives did not successfully defend a single by-election in the eight years between their holds of the 1989 Richmond (Yorks) by-election and the 1997 Uxbridge by-election, losing a record 15 consecutive seats where they were the incumbents. By the time of the by-election in Uxbridge, the victor in Richmond, William Hague, had become leader of the Conservative Party.\nLabour's worst run was 4 consecutive by-election losses, which has occurred three times since 1945:\n* between holding the 1976 Newcastle-upon-Tyne Central by-election and the 1977 Grimsby by-election.\n* between holding the 1967 Manchester Gorton by-election and the 1968 Sheffield Brightside by-election.\n* between holding the 1967 Rhondda West by-election and the 1967 Manchester Gorton by-election.\nLongest period between by-election losses for a party\nBetween the 1988 Glasgow Govan by-election and the 2003 Brent East by-election, Labour successfully defended every seat it held at by-elections, for a total of 30 holds (not counting Falkirk West and West Bromwich West, represented by a Labour MP turned independent and a Labour speaker respectively and both won by Labour). The span of  is the longest period without a by-election defeat for either of the two main parties. The Conservatives did not lose a seat between the 2000 Romsey by-election and the 2012 Corby by-election, a span of . However, they only defended 3 seats in that time. In terms of total number, their longest run of by-election holds was 51, between the 1945 Chelmsford by-election and the 1957 Lewisham North by-election, a span of .\nSince their formation, the Liberal Democrats have held every Lib Dem seat contested at a by-election, of which there have been 3. Including their predecessor parties, their most recent by-election loss was the 1982 Mitcham and Morden by-election, lost by the SDP  ago. The SDP candidate had however defected from Labour – the last seat lost by either party that had been won at a previous election was the 1957 Carmarthen by-election, lost by the Liberals  ago. Since 1982, the Liberal Democrats and predecessors together have defended 4; since 1957 they have defended 5 seats.\nBy-elections in seats held by minor and nationalist parties are rare, and so most have never lost a seat. The SNP lost their first seat at the 2023 Rutherglen and Hamilton West by-election. The DUP and Plaid Cymru have defended but never lost a seat at a by-election, Sinn Féin have only lost seats by disqualification, and the UUP have never lost more than one seat in a row. No by-election has ever been called in an SDLP held seat.\nLongest period without an opposition gain\nFor a period of 11 years, from the 1997 general election until the 2008 Crewe and Nantwich by-election, the principal opposition Conservative Party failed to register a by-election gain against the incumbent Labour Government. This is the longest period of such failure since records began, and more than twice the previous record of the five years it took the then Labour opposition to gain the 1957 Lewisham North by-election. Labour did however lose 3 seats to the Liberal Democrats in that period, their first being the 2003 Brent East by-election.\nThe Labour Party, in its period in opposition starting in 2010, did not register a gain for over nine years, between the 2012 Corby by-election and the 2022 Wakefield by-election. In this period, the Conservative government lost three seats in by-elections where the former Conservative incumbent stood for a different party (2014 Clacton by-election and 2014 Rochester and Strood by-election, both lost to UKIP) or as an independent (2016 Richmond Park by-election, lost to the Liberal Democrats). Their first loss in a by-election without a sitting incumbent was to the Liberal Democrats at the 2019 Brecon and Radnorshire by-election.\nApart from the brief parliaments of 1910, 1950-1 and 1974, the parliaments of 1951-5 and 1997-2001 are the only occasions when the Government did not lose a by-election.\nMost by-elections in one day\nThe largest number of by-elections held on a single day occurred on 23 January 1986 when 15 simultaneous contests were held in Northern Ireland. The elections had been engineered by the incumbent Unionist parties as a protest against the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985. They intended the results to be interpreted as a referendum on the treaty. The elections were boycotted by the main Nationalist parties except in four seats where they had a reasonable prospect of victory. In the event, the Social Democratic and Labour Party gained one seat, Newry and Armagh, from the Ulster Unionist Party.\nApart from the above example, it is common for UK mainland parties to schedule several by-elections on the same day. Motivations include attempting to divide opponents' resources and getting bad news (expected losses) out of the way. Since 1945, the largest number of simultaneous mainland by-elections has been 6, held on 16 November 1960. On four occasions, 5 by-elections have been held on the same day, most recently on 9 June 1994. Groupings of two or three are very common.\nBefore November 2012, the last day on which three by-elections had been held was 23 November 2000. In November 2012 there were two such groupings of three (15 November and 29 November). The last time there were six by-elections in one calendar month was in June 1994.\nMost by-election losses in one day\nThe largest number of by-elections lost on a single day is three, when the Labour party lost Acton, Dudley and Meriden on 28 March 1968, all to the Conservatives.\nOccasions since 1945 when two seats have fallen are:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Date\n!By-election\n!colspan=2|Winning party\n!colspan=4|Losing party\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |15 February 2024\n|2024 Kingswood by-election\n|\n|\n|-\n|2024 Wellingborough by-election\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|19 October 2023\n| 2023 Tamworth by-election\n|-\n| 2023 Mid Bedfordshire by-election\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|20 July 2023\n| 2023 Somerton and Frome by-election\n|\n|-\n| 2023 Selby and Ainsty by-election\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|23 June 2022\n| 2022 Tiverton and Honiton by-election\n|\n|-\n| 2022 Wakefield by-election\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|7 November 1991\n| 1991 Kincardine and Deeside by-election\n|\n|-\n| 1991 Langbaurgh by-election\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|4 November 1976\n| 1976 Walsall North by-election\n|\n|\n|-\n| 1976 Workington by-election\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|8 November 1973\n| 1973 Glasgow Govan by-election\n|\n|-\n| 1973 Berwick-upon-Tweed by-election\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|26 July 1973\n| 1973 Ripon by-election\n|-\n| 1973 Isle of Ely by-election\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|2 November 1967\n| 1967 Hamilton by-election\n|\n|\n|-\n| 1967 Leicester South West by-election\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|21 September 1967\n| 1967 Walthamstow West by-election\n|-\n| 1967 Cambridge by-election\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|22 November 1962\n| 1962 Glasgow Woodside by-election\n|\n|\n|-\n| 1962 South Dorset by-election\n|}\nSeats with more than one by-election in a single Parliament\n*Bootle: May and November 1990.\n*Fermanagh and South Tyrone: April and August 1981.\n*Bristol South East: 1961 and 1963.\n*Mid Ulster: 1955 and 1956.\n*Edinburgh East: 1945 and 1947.\n*Middlesbrough West: 1940 and 1945.\n*Combined Scottish Universities: 1936, 1938 and 1945.\n*Berwick-upon-Tweed: 1941 and 1944.\n*Clay Cross: 1936 and 1944.\n*West Derbyshire: 1938 and 1944.\n*Buckingham: 1937 and 1943.\n*Manchester Gorton: 1937 and 1942.\n*Dunbartonshire: 1936 and 1941.\n*Greenock: 1936 and 1941.\n*Doncaster: 1938 and 1941.\n*Southampton: February and November 1940.\n*Preston: 1936 and 1940.\n*Wandsworth Central: 1937 and 1940.\n*City of London: 1938 and 1940.\n*Combined Scottish Universities: 1934 and 1935.\n*Eastbourne: 1932 and 1935.\n*Twickenham: 1932 and 1934.\n*Portsmouth South: 1922 and 1923.\n*North Down: 1921, February and July 1922.\n*West Down: 1921 and 1922.\n*South Londonderry: 1921 and 1922.\n*Louth: 1920 and 1921.\n*The Wrekin: February and November 1920.\n*North Londonderry: 1919 and 1922.\n*Prestwich: January and October 1918.\n*Edinburgh and St Andrews Universities: 1916 and 1917.\n*St George's Hanover Square: 1913, 1916 and 1918.\n*City of London: February and June 1906.\n*Oswestry: 1901 and 1904.\n*Southport: 1898 and 1899.\n*City of London: April and June 1891.\n*Buckingham: 1889 and 1891.\n*Ayr Burghs: 1888 and 1890.\n*Northampton: 1881, 1882 and 1884.\n*Preston: 1881 and February and November 1882.\n*Bath: May, June and October 1873.\n*South Shropshire: 1866 and 1867.\n*East Gloucestershire: January and December 1854.\n*Greenwich: 1851 and 1852.\n*South Nottinghamshire: 1848 and 1852.\n*Buckinghamshire: 1837 and 1839 and 1842 and 1845, within two successive parliaments.\nOther seats with by-elections less than five years apart\n* Batley and Spen: 2016 and 2021\n*Hemsworth: 1991 and 1996.\n*Upper Bann: 1986 and 1990.\n*Belfast South: 1982 and 1986.\n*Fermanagh and South Tyrone: August 1981 and 1986.\n*Nuneaton: 1965 and 1967.\n*Ormskirk: 1951 and 1953.\n*Liverpool Wavertree: 1931 and 1935.\n*Twickenham: 1929, 1932 and 1934.\n*Westminster Abbey: 1921 and 1924.\nBy-election days\nBritish Parliamentary elections are invariably held on a Thursday. The last by-election not held on a Thursday was the 1978 Hamilton by-election, held on Wednesday 31 May due to a World Cup opening match on the Thursday evening.\nDue to an administrative oversight, the 1973 Manchester Exchange by-election was held on Wednesday 27 June 1973. Prior to that, the last by-elections not held on a Thursday were the 1965 Saffron Walden by-election held on Tuesday 23 March, and the 1965 Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles by-election held the following day.\nUntil the mid-1960s, it was common to hold by-elections on any day of the week (other than Sunday).\nCountermanded poll\nVery occasionally, a scheduled by-election may be overtaken by the calling of a general election and the dissolution of Parliament, in which case the poll is countermanded by the Returning Officer. There have been only three occasions since 1918: a by-election was scheduled to take place in Warwick and Leamington on 21 November 1923, but was cancelled by a dissolution of Parliament on 16 November. A by-election was scheduled to poll between 13 and 17 October 1924 in London University but was cancelled by a dissolution of Parliament on 9 October. In 2017 the Manchester Gorton by-election was cancelled by a Motion in the House of Commons following the calling of the 2017 United Kingdom general election.\nSeats left vacant\nOccasionally seats are left vacant for a substantial period.\nNo by-election writ was moved for any seat held by Sinn Féin after the 1918 general election. Four Sinn Féin candidates were elected in two different seats and would have had to decline one of them if they had wanted to take their seats. They were Éamon de Valera (East Clare and East Mayo), Arthur Griffith (East Cavan and North West Tyrone), Eoin MacNeill (Londonderry City and National University of Ireland) and Liam Mellowes (East Galway and North Meath).\nBy the end of the Parliament, the following Sinn Féin MPs had died without being replaced: Pierce McCan (East Tipperary) of influenza on 6 March 1919, Terence MacSwiney (Mid Cork) following a hunger strike in Brixton prison on 25 October 1920, Frank Lawless (North Dublin) as a result of a riding injury on 16 April 1922, Joseph McGuinness (Longford) on 31 May 1922, Cathal Brugha (Waterford) in action during the Irish Civil War on 7 July 1922, Harry Boland (South Roscommon) shot while being arrested on 2 August 1922, Arthur Griffith (East Cavan and North West Tyrone) on 12 August 1922, and Michael Collins (South Cork assassinated on 22 August 1922). In each case their seats were abolished in 1922 as a result of the establishment of the Irish Free State.\nOther than these cases the longest time a seat has been left vacant with no by-election held is when Dennis Vosper was elevated to the Peerage on 20 April 1964, and no writ was moved by the time Parliament was dissolved on 25 September 1964.\nCauses of by-elections\nBy-elections prompted by assassination\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Date of assassination\n!Member\n!Detail\n!By-election\n!By-election date\n!colspan=2|Defending party\n!colspan=2|Winning party\n|-\n|15 October 2021\n|Sir David Amess\n|Stabbed during a surgery by an Islamic extremist\n|2022 Southend West by-election\n|3 February 2022\n|\n|\n|-\n|16 June 2016\n|Jo Cox\n|Cox was killed by a white nationalist\n|2016 Batley and Spen by-election\n|20 October 2016\n|\n|\n|-\n|-\n|30 July 1990\n|Ian Gow\n|Killed by Provisional IRA bomb under his car\n|1990 Eastbourne by-election\n|18 October 1990\n|\n|\n|-\n|12 October 1984\n|Sir Anthony Berry\n|Killed by Provisional IRA bombing of Brighton\n|1984 Enfield Southgate by-election\n|13 December 1984\n|\n|\n|-\n|14 November 1981\n|Rev.

The by-election was a single-issue election in regards to government security policy, in which the Liberal Democrats supported the Conservative candidate.\nThe Conservative Party did not run a candidate in the 1963 Bristol South East by-election, the 1957 Carmarthen by-election, the 1948 Paisley by-election or the 1946 Ogmore by-election.\nThe Labour Party did not run in the 1945 City of London by-election, the 1945 Kensington South by-election or the 1946 Combined English Universities by-election.\nPrior to 2008, the last by-election without an official Liberal Democrat, Liberal or SDP candidate had been the 1994 Newham North East by-election; the Lib Dems nominated a candidate, but he joined the Labour Party before the election. No official Liberal candidate was nominated for the 1980 Glasgow Central by-election, whilst no Liberal stood in either the 1973 Westhoughton by-election or the 1973 West Bromwich by-election, both held on 24 May 1973.\nThe last Scottish by-elections without official Scottish National Party candidates were the 1965 Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles by-election and the 1964 Rutherglen by-election.\nPlaid Cymru did not stand a candidate for the 2019 Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, choosing instead to endorse the Liberal Democrat candidate in a \"Stop Brexit\" alliance. Prior to that, the last Welsh by-elections without official Welsh Nationalist candidates were the 1950 Abertillery by-election, the 1946 Pontypool by-election and the 1945 Monmouth by-election.\nNorthern Ireland\nThe more fluid nature of politics in Northern Ireland makes it harder to define all major parties. In addition many by-elections have not been contested by parties holding other seats in the House of Commons, whether due to agreements with other parties, poor organisation in the constituency or the particular circumstances on the by-election. However, for the period since 1981 (which saw the first by-elections in twelve years, during which time several major political realignments had occurred) the main parties are usually considered to be the Democratic Unionist Party, Sinn Féin, the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and the Ulster Unionist Party.\nAt the 2013 Mid Ulster by-election. a single \"unity\" candidate was backed by the withdrawal of the Democratic Unionist Party, Ulster Conservatives and Unionists and Traditional Unionist Voice. Prior to Mid Ulster in 2013, the most recent examples of by-elections without official Democratic Unionist candidates were the 1995 North Down by-election and the 1990 Upper Bann by-election. They also did not stand in the twelve seats held by other Unionist parties in the 15 by-elections in 1986.\nThe last by-election without official candidates from either Sinn Féin or the SDLP was the 1995 North Down by-election. Both parties also declined to stand in the eleven Unionist majority seats in the 15 by-elections in 1986. The SDLP also did not contest either the April or August 1981 by-elections in Fermanagh and South Tyrone.\nThe last by-elections without official Ulster Unionist candidates prior to Mid Ulster in 2013 were North Antrim, East Belfast, Mid Ulster and North Down in the 15 by-elections in 1986.\nThe main British parties have generally not stood in seats in Northern Ireland. The by-election exceptions are the 1990 Upper Bann by-election (NI Conservatives and continuing SDP) and the 1995 North Down by-election (NI Conservatives). Prior to the 1970s the Ulster Unionists were effectively the local Conservatives, whilst the Liberals contested some but not all seats. The SDLP has traditionally seen itself as a \"sister party\" to the British Labour party, and its MPs usually accept the Labour whip in Parliament.\nMiscellaneous notable results\nIt is unusual for one of the major parties to finish outside of the top three in England and Wales (or outside of the top four in Scotland). It is also unusual for the principal opposition party to suffer a significant reverse in its share of the vote or ranking.\n*The 2024 Rochdale by-election had all three major English parties finish outside of the top two. The incumbent Labour party fell from first to fourth place, with its largest-ever loss of vote share, after disowning their own candidate.\n*The 2021 Hartlepool by-election, with a 16% swing to the Conservatives, was the Labour Party's worst result in a Labour-held seat while the party was in Opposition, since the 1912 Hanley by-election.\n*The 2019 Brecon and Radnorshire by-election saw Labour finish fourth behind the Liberal Democrats, Conservatives and Brexit Party. In addition, UKIP fell to last place, behind the Official Monster Raving Loony Party – a result compared to the continuing SDP's defeat in the 1990 Bootle by-election.\n*The 2016 Richmond Park by-election was the first Liberal Democrat gain since 2010, showing tentative signs of recovery for the party. It also gave them a female MP for the first time in the 56th parliament. In addition it was the first occasion in more than a century of Labour losing their deposit in a London by-election.\n*The 2014 Clacton by-election saw the election of the first UKIP MP on the largest swing ever against the Conservative Party. It was also the first time that a party had gained a seat not having contested the previous election since the 1973 Isle of Ely by-election. The Liberal Democrat's 1.4% of the vote was their worst result in an English seat since 1924.\n*The 2013 Eastleigh by-election delivered several records. It was the first time in an English seat that both Labour and Conservative finished outside of the top two. For the first time, UKIP came close to winning a seat. It was the closest three-cornered English by-election since the 1921 Penistone by-election, and, aside from the 1946 Combined English Universities by-election, it was won with the lowest winning share of the vote since 1918. Aside from the contrived example of the 1989 Richmond (Yorks) by-election it was also the first time Labour had finished fourth in a by-election while in Opposition.\n*At the 2012 Rotherham by-election, the Conservative party fell from second to fifth place (equalling its previous lowest position in a by-election in mainland Britain) while the Liberal Democrats fell from third place to eighth, the lowest ranking ever achieved by a major party in a by-election. This followed the 2011 Barnsley Central by-election, where the Liberal Democrats took sixth place, dropping from second at the 2010 general election. The Rotherham by-election was also the first recorded by-election result to have women in the top four places.\n*In the 2009 Glasgow North East by-election and 1999 Hamilton South by-election the Liberal Democrats came sixth in both cases, equalling the worst ever placing by a major party in the UK. In 1999 the party had 634 votes while in Glasgow the party won 474 votes.\n*At the 2008 Henley by-election the Labour Party finished in fifth place, the worst ranking for the party in its history, and a record low for any government in a UK mainland constituency. The lowest ever for an incumbent government was the 1990 Upper Bann by-election when the Conservatives came sixth, although they had not previously contested the seat.\n*At the 2006 Blaenau Gwent by-election, held on the same day as Bromley and Chislehurst, the Conservative Party's fifth-place ranking equalled the worst-place achieved by a major party in England or Wales, a feat the Conservatives had first achieved in the same seat in the 2005 general election. The Blaenau victor, Dai Davies was the first independent to hold a seat previously occupied by an independent since Sir C.V.F. Townshend held The Wrekin in 1920.\n*The drop in the Conservative share of the vote, 11.1%, at the 2006 Bromley and Chislehurst by-election was their worst result in a Conservative-held seat while in opposition since 19301. At the same by-election, the Labour Party's fall from second to fourth place was the first time the party had suffered such a reverse in an English seat.\n*The Conservative Party fell from second to fourth place in the 2004 Hartlepool by-election  and the 1983 Bermondsey by-election, and fell from third to fourth place in the 1991 Liverpool Walton by-election. At the time their worst ranking in an English by-election since at least 1945 was the drop from third place to fourth place in the 1974 Newham South by-election.\n*The Labour party fell from second to fourth place in the 2000 Ceredigion by-election.\n*At the Bootle by-election, 1990 the \"continuing\" SDP finished seventh out of eight candidates, behind the Monster Raving Loony Party, in a seat parts of which had once been in adjoining Crosby, scene of the party's greatest triumph only eight years previously.\n*The Labour Party achieved fourth place in the 1989 Richmond (Yorks) by-election although this was contrived somewhat by the Social and Liberal Democrats and Social Democratic Party parties running separate candidates.\n*At the 1976 Walsall North by-election, the Liberal Party could take only fifth place. Beaten by an independent and a minor party candidate, at the time, this was the worst placing for any major party in an English by-election since at least 1945.\n*The last time the Liberals lost a by-election they were defending was at the 1957 Carmarthen by-election, defeated by the former Liberal MP turned Labour candidate, Lady Megan Lloyd George. The Liberal parliamentary contingent was thus reduced to five MPs, its lowest ever level.\nNotes\n1Excluding the 1931 Westminster St George's by-election and the 1930 Paddington South by-election, which were essentially intra-Conservative contests, the previous worst result was, ironically, the 1930 Bromley by-election\nBy-elections having national significance\n*2024 Rochdale by-election: Victory for George Galloway and the Workers Party of Britain highlighted Labour's difficulties with Muslim voters due to its stance on the war in Gaza, presaging the success of several pro-Gaza independent candidates at the following general election.\n*2022 Tiverton and Honiton by-election and 2022 Wakefield by-election: A pair of by-election losses for the government on the same day – one in a rural area represented by the Conservatives since 1923 and one in a recently won \"Red Wall\" seat – triggered the resignation of Oliver Dowden as Chairman of the Conservative Party and contributed to the pressure on Prime Minister Boris Johnson that led to the collapse of his government two weeks later.\n*2017 Copeland by-election: A Conservative win in a previously safe Labour seat seemed to confirm the party's strong opinion poll lead and prompted an early election in which Labour ultimately achieved a net gain of 30 seats.\n*2016 Richmond Park by-election: After losing most of its seats in the 2015 general election, a Lib Dem gain on a large swing in a strongly Remain seat marked the beginning of a turnaround for the party and demonstrated the political effects of Brexit.\n*2014 Clacton by-election: The first by-election victory for the UK Independence Party\n*2008 Crewe and Nantwich by-election: A Conservative gain (from Labour in this case) at a by-election for the first time since 1982, and the first time as an opposition party since 1978, demonstrated the Conservatives were back in contention to possibly win the next general election.\n*2003 Brent East by-election: A Lib Dem gain of a Labour safe seat on a 29% swing demonstrated the political effect of public dissatisfaction with the Iraq War.\n*1997 Wirral South by-election: A Labour gain on a large swing just weeks before a general election confirmed the move in the party's favour was real and meant the Conservatives became a minority government.\n*1991 Liverpool Walton by-election: The Militant group, as Walton Real Labour, opposed a Labour candidate for the first time; their showing led to the decision to re-organise as Militant Labour without using entryist tactics.\n*May 1990 Bootle by-election: Abysmal showing of the 'continuing SDP' led to the party being wound up.\n*1987 Greenwich by-election: Defeat of a left-wing Labour candidate demonstrated the party's vulnerability.\n*1983 Darlington by-election: Labour's successful defence of a marginal seat stabilised the party, and secured the position of Leader Michael Foot.\n*1981 Crosby by-election: Victory of the Social Democratic Party in a rock-solid Conservative seat showed the national appeal of the party.\n*April 1981 Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election: Election of Maze prison hunger-striker Bobby Sands demonstrated that nationalist voters could support violent Republican candidates; taken by the Republican movement as a vindication of their stance, it led to the return of Sinn Féin as a major force in Northern Irish politics.\n*1977 Birmingham Stechford by-election: The loss of the seat to the Conservatives tipped Labour under James Callaghan into minority government status, necessitating the Lib–Lab pact.\n*1967 Hamilton by-election: Scottish National Party victory massively boosted the prospects of the party.\n*1966 Kingston upon Hull North by-election: Easy Labour victory in a marginal seat demonstrated to Prime Minister Harold Wilson that he would probably win a snap general election, and led to the construction of the Humber Bridge.\n*1965 Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles by-election: Rare Conservative loss in Opposition leads to resignation of leader Sir Alec Douglas-Home and election of Edward Heath as first democratically elected Conservative leader.\n*1965 Leyton by-election: Foreign Secretary Patrick Gordon-Walker, who was found the seat after losing Smethwick in 1964, is again defeated; he is forced to resign from the Government.\n*1963 Kinross and Western Perthshire by-election: Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home successfully returned to the House of Commons after disclaiming his peerage.\n*1962 Orpington by-election: A Liberal gain in a suburban seat led to a national revival for the party.\n*1961 Bristol South East by-election: Incumbent Labour MP Tony Benn re-elected after inheriting a peerage; the seat was awarded to the defeated Conservative, but the circumstances led to the Peerage Act 1963 allowing hereditary peerages to be disclaimed.\n*1938 Oxford by-election: After a campaign dominated by appeasement and the Munich agreement, the government candidate won.\n*1935 Liverpool Wavertree by-election: Intervention of Independent Conservative Randolph Churchill, on platform of rearmament and anti-Indian Home Rule, hands safe seat to Labour on largest ever swing (30%). Indication of hostility to National Government, and Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald resigns within months.\n*1933 Fulham East by-election: Unexpected Labour gain in a previously safe Conservative constituency, ascribed to pacifism.\n*1922 Newport by-election: Election of an anti-Coalition Conservative in a tight three-way contest spurred on Conservative MPs to end their coalition with David Lloyd George.\n*1920 Dartford by-election: massive swing to Labour prefigures the party's eclipse of the Liberals.\nFirsts and lasts\n*First (and currently only) by-election gain by Reform UK: 2025 Runcorn and Helsby by-election\n*First (and currently only) by-election gain by Workers Party of Britain: 2024 Rochdale by-election\n*Last by-election to be called via the provisions of the Recall of MPs Act 2015: 2024 Wellingborough by-election\n*First by-election to be called via the provisions of the Recall of MPs Act 2015: 2019 Peterborough by-election\n*First by-election gain by the UK Independence Party: 2014 Clacton by-election\n*Last by-election gain by a Northern Ireland party: 2000 South Antrim by-election (Democratic Unionist Party from Ulster Unionist Party)\n*First by-election gain by a Northern Ireland party: 1943 Belfast West by-election (Northern Ireland Labour Party from Ulster Unionist Party)\n*Last by-election gain by the Social Democratic Party (SDP): 1987 Greenwich by-election\n*First by-election gain by the Social Democratic Party (SDP): 1981 Crosby by-election\n*Last by-election gain by the Liberal Party: 1986 Ryedale by-election\n*First by-election in which 18 year olds could vote, and party labels were included on the ballot: 1970 Bridgwater by-election\n*First (and currently only) by-election gain by Plaid Cymru: 1966 Carmarthen by-election\n*Last by-election result to be declared undue: 1961 Bristol South East by-election\n*Last by-election in a university constituency: 1946 Combined Scottish Universities by-election\n*Last unopposed by-election in England, Scotland or Wales: 1946 Hemsworth by-election\n*Last by-election caused by appointment to ministerial office: 1926 East Renfrewshire by-election\n*Last double member by-election: 1920 Stockport by-election\n*Last by-election from what was to become the Irish Free State: 1919 Dublin University by-election\n*Last by-election result to be declared void: 1892 Cirencester by-election\n*First by-election subject to the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act 1883: 1883 Limerick City by-election\n*First by-election to be held using the secret ballot: 1872 Pontefract by-election\nSee also\n*Lists of United Kingdom by-elections\n*United Kingdom European Parliament election records\n*Swing (United Kingdom)\n*Records of members of parliament of the United Kingdom\n*United Kingdom general election records\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* ''Who's Who of British MPs: Volume IV, 1945-1979 by Michael Stenton and Stephen Lees (Harvester, Brighton, 1979)\n* British Political Facts 1900-1994'' by David Butler and Gareth Butler (St. Martin's Press, New York, 1994)\n* [http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/rp2008/rp08-012.pdf Election Statistics 1918-2007.
