Following the 1963 coup which toppled elected president Juan Bosch of the Dominican Revolutionary Party, supporters of his constitutional reforms were excluded from the elections, although Bosch himself contested them. The result was a victory for Joaquín Balaguer of the Reformist Party, whilst his party also won the Congressional elections. Voter turnout was 76%.\nResults\nPresident\nCongress\n|votes9=4834|st1t9=0|st2t9=New|st3t9=0|st4t9=New\n|party10=Democratic Revolutionary Nationalist Party|votes10=4039|st1t10=0|st2t10=–4|st3t10=–|st4t10=–1\n|invalid=27291\n|electorate=1815429\n|total_st2t=0|total_st4t=0\n|source=Nohlen\n}}\nSee also\n*1963 Dominican coup d'état\n*Dominican Civil War\nReferences"
