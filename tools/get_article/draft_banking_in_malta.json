Although the Treasury functioned similarly to a financial institution, dealing with import and export operations, establishing exchange rates, and collecting and making payments, it was not a bank but rather an administrative and financial management function within the Knights' operations.\nOn the other hand, the Massa Frumentaria, or Monte Frumentario, was a grain fund responsible for the importation of wheat and foodstuffs administered by the Università, under the supervision of the Knights of St. John. The Università was a form of local government composed of local aristocracy responsible for managing the island’s civil and economic affairs during medieval times  and was eventually dissolved in 1819. The Massa Frumentaria operated as a very profitable commercial venture financed by citizens who deposited money into it and who, in return, earned interest rates between 3% and 6%.\nBefore the French occupation in 1798, its holdings included 123 grain stores containing 75,747 salme* (21.7m litres) of grain, 23 oil vats with 25,431 cafisi (12,715 barrels) of oil, barley stores, markets, shops, and significant real estate valued at approximately 1.8 million Maltese scudi (£150,000 of the time). The average annual profit from corn sales was about 132,000 scudi (£11,000) with ecclesiastical bodies having deposited 1,121,402 scudi (£93,450), while the Order's Exchequer had borrowed 788,066 scudi (£65,672). During Napoleon's occupation of Malta, the French seized all of the assets. During the subsequent Maltese uprising in a letter dated 9 May 1799, General Vaubois, general of the French garrison, threatened the Maltese insurgents with financial ruin if the French lost control of Malta. After the French capitulated on September 5, 1800, General Pigot, leader of the British relief forces, eager to occupy Valletta, neglected to secure the financial interests of the Maltese. Following British occupation, governor Sir Alexander Ball and his successors made many false promises to restore the lost wealth, leaving a lasting financial impact on many Maltese. The confiscation of the assets also resulted in the disruption of food supply to the island, causing around 2,000 fatalities and prompting many others to emigrate abroad following the Knights' departure.\nThe salma (plural salme) was a historical unit of volume in Malta, principally used for measuring grain. It equated to 98.5% of an imperial quarter, thus amounting to 286.59 litres. In 1875, the British standardised it to precisely correspond with an imperial quarter, measuring 290.95 litres.\nTwo other institutions that operated as quasi-banks were the Monte di Pietà and the Monte della Redenzione degli Schiavi. The Monti di Pieta was set up in 1598 and operated as an early banking institution fighting usury, which was prevalent at the time and associated with Jewish moneylenders, by providing loans secured by collateral to individuals in financial hardship, while the Monte della Redenzione degli Schiavi functioned as a fund for ransoming captives taken by Muslims. The two funds merged just before the Knights' expulsion from Malta in 1798. Like the Massa Frumentaria, the French despoiled the Monte di Pietà of its assets, valued at 443,484 scudi in 1798. The fund was re-established by the British in 1800 through the advance of £4,000 from the local Treasury. See main article on the Monte di Pietà.\nAt the turn of the century, a farm labourer's daily income was only about one-third of a scudo, providing some context to the more than 2.2 million scudi looted from the Maltese financial system during the French occupation. (The daily wage of the farm labourer around the beginnings of the 1800s was 6¾ pence. At the time, the British pound sterling was subdivided into 20 shillings, each of 12 (old) pence, making it a total of 240 pence (see Sterling prior to decimalisation), which was also equivalent to 12 scudi , meaning that one scudo was equivalent to 20 pence. Hence, a farm labourer would need to work roughly three days to earn a scudo.) The looted funds were never returned.\nBritish Protectorate (1800-1813)\nFollowing the assistance provided to the Maltese in expelling the French in 1800, the Maltese recognised George III as their monarch and requested British protection formally by the Maltese Declaration of Rights in 1802.  (See Main Article: Malta as a British Protectorate).\nHarbour activity in Malta increased, which included the George Washington, the first American warship to navigate the Mediterranean in early 1801. Valletta emerged as a crucial logistical and diplomatic base for the American forces in their war against North African corsairs, known as the First Barbary War (1801-1805). American warships, such as the USS Constitution, docked in Malta's Grand Harbour to obtain fresh water, supplies, and essential repairs, which enabled the American squadron to maintain its blockade and operations against the Barbary States.\nIn 1806, Napoleon's Continental Blockade disrupted commercial connections between England and several European nations, with British trade routes predominantly redirecting through Southern Europe, particularly Malta. In addition, the island also served as a staging point for the importation of raw materials and commodities from the Barbary States and the Levant to England and to the Austrian States.\nPort activity surged between 1805 and 1815, with an impressive average of 1,500 ships visiting Malta every year. The circulating currency used in Malta reflected this international trade, comprising a mixture of Maltese scudi and tari from the era of the Order, Sicilian, Spanish and South American dollars, together with British gold sovereigns and half sovereigns. Ironically, the surge in commercial activity partially reversed the poverty and destruction caused by the Maltese insurrection against French control a few years earlier.\nThe foundation of institutional banking on the islands coincided with Malta becoming a British protectorate after 1800 and this period of economic prosperity. The first Maltese bank, the Anglo Maltese Bank, was formed on 23 June 1809 by Maltese and British merchants, under the governance of Sir Alexander Ball. This was followed on 1 May 1812 by the Banco Di Malta, which was also known as Banco Maltese. The list of shareholders of the Banco di Malta included historian Onorato Bres and Vincenzo Borg, the head of the Maltese battalion against the French during the Siege of Malta.\nThese were followed by the family-run banks '''Tagliaferro's Bank also in 1812 and Scicluna's Bank in 1830, contributing further to commercial and financial growth. Biagio Tagliaferro, a Genoese merchant, operated a corporate entity, B. Tagliaferro e Figli,''' with operations in Genoa, Naples, Odessa, and Valletta. While Scicluna's Bank, which was established by Marquis Giuseppe Scicluna, disbursed salaries to its employees by cheque. The bank was popularly known as \"il-Bank taċ-Ċisk\" from the corruption of the word cheque.\nDocuments indicate that the British managed the economy to persuade the Maltese towards British annexation. In 1813, Malta was established as a British Crown Colony, a designation formally ratified by the Treaty of Paris in 1814.\nEarly British Colonial Rule\nUp to November 1833, all banks in Malta were commercial banks until the formation of the Malta Government Savings Bank. This entity was formerly established as the Provvido Banco Maltese per Risparmi (Maltese Provident Bank for Savings) to encourage savings and provide financial services to the public under the patronage of Archbishop Francesco Saverio Caruana. It started with eight depositors on 4 January 1834, which increased to 180 by the end of the year. It operated together with the Monte di Pietà between 1838 and 1848. On December 25, 1848, both institutions were taken over by the government and continue, although in somewhat reduced capacity, to the present day as Monti di Pieta. The Bank also opened a branch in Gozo on 1 June 1853.\n20th Century Developments\nPope Leo XIII's 1891 Rerum Novarum defined the late nineteenth century Catholic social doctrine.\nThe Anglo Maltese Bank and Banco di Malta merged in 1946 to form the National Bank. Scicluna’s Bank and Tagliaferro’s Bank also joined this new National Bank in 1949. The bank was regarded as a leading financial institution of the time with an expanded branch network and financing several substantial planned projects in post-independence Malta. The National Bank was nationalised following a run on its reserves in December 1972, instigated by substantial withdrawals from government-owned enterprises. The Bank of Valletta (BOV) commenced operations on 25 March 1974 after assuming the assets and liabilities of the National Bank Group.\nAnglo Egyptian Bank Ltd opened a branch in Valletta in 1864 and in 1925 merged with the National Bank of South Africa and the Colonial Bank to establish Barclays Bank Dominion Colonial Overseas, later rebranded as Barclays Bank D.C.O and ultimately as Barclays Bank International. Mid-Med Bank was established in 1975 following the nationalisation of Barclays Bank International's activities in Malta by the socialist government. In 1999, Midland Bank acquired 67.1% of the direct holdings of the Government of Malta. Upon rebranding Midland Bank as HSBC Bank, Mid-Med was transformed into HSBC Malta Plc.\nThe two bank nationalisations preceded another banking crisis. The Bank of Industry, Commerce and Agriculture Ltd, which was set up in 1963 by Cecil and Henry Pace and known as BICAL, collapsed in November 1972. Its collapse in the 1970s highlighted significant issues in banking governance and regulation. The process, which was marked by controversies and legal disputes,\nThe Bank of Apostleship of Prayer, was founded in 1910 as a pious philanthropic financial institution by l’Unione Cattolica San Giuseppe to encourage the working classes to save part of their income.  The bank evolved into a cost-effective financial institution with a focus on personal banking. In November 1947, l’Unione Cattolica San Giuseppe, along with all its branches and the Savings Bank, was transferred to the Archdiocese of Malta. The Bank's name was changed to APS Bank Ltd in 1990.\nLombard Bank, founded in 1955\nScandals Bank of Alderney,  and of Pilatus Bank Satabank\nG. Busuttil, who operated his Victoria private bank from 54, Strada Reale, Valletta.\n19th Century Developments\nBritish colonial reforms introduced a more structured monetary system, replacing the chaotic mix of currencies previously in circulation.\nForeign banks like the Anglo-Egyptian Bank (1881) began operating in Malta, reflecting the island's growing integration into international finance.\n20th Century Transformations\nIn 1946, the Anglo-Maltese Bank and Banco di Malta merged to form the National Bank of Malta, consolidating the banking sector.\nInternational banks like Barclays and the Banco di Roma established operations in Malta, further diversifying the sector.\nThe banking sector faced challenges during World War II, including disruptions and closures, but recovered post-war.\nPost-Independence Era (1964 Onward)\nMalta gained independence in 1964, prompting significant restructuring of the banking sector.\nThe Central Bank of Malta was established in 1968 to regulate and oversee the financial system.\nNew institutions like the Bank of Valletta (1974) and Mid-Med Bank (1975) were created, replacing older banks and modernizing the sector.\nModernization and Challenges\nThe sector expanded with the introduction of specialized institutions like the Investment Finance Bank (1976) and Melita Bank International (1981), focusing on offshore and development banking.\nLiquidity crises and the collapse of smaller banks, such as the Bical Bank, highlighted vulnerabilities but also led to reforms and stronger oversight.\nBy the 1970s, the banking sector became increasingly state-controlled, with major banks like the Bank of Valletta and Mid-Med Bank playing central roles.\nKey Themes\nThe evolution of Malta's banking sector reflects its transition from a colonial economy to an independent nation with a modern financial system.\nForeign influence, particularly from British and Italian banks, played a significant role in shaping the sector.\nDespite challenges, Malta's banking industry demonstrated resilience and adaptability, contributing to the country's economic development.\nThis historical progression underscores Malta's ability to modernize its banking sector while maintaining its relevance in the Mediterranean region.\nThe Central Bank of Malta was established in (17/4/1968 as rudold uwe jens pp xxxviii) 1976, and the Banking Act was enacted three years later.\nReferences"
