Due to the difficulty in interpreting the various chronicles, historians are still debating the site of the battle. According to Reinhart Dozy, the battle was fought in Rueda in Valladolid, whereas Ruiz Asencio considers that it was Roa, in Burgos, a fortress that had been repopulated in 912.\nThe Muslim forces were commanded by Almanzor, while the Christian troops were a combined force and the combined from the kingdoms of León and Pamplona, plus the County of Castile, led by King Ramiro III of León, Sancho II of Pamplona, and García Fernández of Castile. The battle ended in a disastrous defeat for the Christian kingdoms and resulted in the rebellion of the Galician nobles and the eventual abdication of King Ramiro III in favor of Bermudo II of León.\nThe battle followed a similar defeat at the Battle of Torrevicente.\nReferences\nSources\n*"
