Munro of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. It supports three graphics output devices: X Window, PostScript, and Computer Graphics Metafiles (CGM). The library is promoted as being small (written directly to Xlib), efficient, and full featured. Portability is restricted to systems running X Window (essentially, the Unix world).\nPython variant\nThere is a Python port of Gist called PyGist; it is used as one of several optional graphics front ends of the scientific library SciPy. PyGist is also ported to Mac OS and Microsoft Windows.\nReferences"
