They were announced as one of the inaugural teams for the new Arena Football One, but will begin play in 2026.\nHistory\nThe Crusaders are the second official Stockton-based team to play in the AFL system and the first since the Stockton Lightning who played in af2 from 2006 to 2009. The team was planned to begin play in 2025 alongside the rest of the AF1, but the Crusaders, along with Monterrey, announced that they would be pushing their seasons back to 2026. The logo was made using Artificial intelligence\nArena Football One's predecessor, the 2024 revival of the Arena Football League, had initially announced a team in California's Central Valley. With a leaked social media page indicating this team would be named the California Grizzlies, this team was originally to play  southeast of Stockton, in Bakersfield; its owner, Tim Carbajal, owned a semi-pro outdoor team in that city. Ultimately, Carbajal was unable to secure a lease agreement with Mechanics Bank Arena, and the Grizzlies never made it to play.  The team logo eventually went with the Oregon Blackbears.  Carbajal is now part-owner of the Arizona Bandits of AF1.\nBirth of the Crusaders\nThe Stockton Crusaders were founded in June of 2024.  On September 9, 2024, the Crusaders announced their intentions to join the newly-formed Arena Football One. Its head coach Kurt Bryan was a co-creator of the A-11 offense briefly used in outdoor football. Team president Scott McKibben had previously been chairman of the Oakland Coliseum authority.\nOn November 18, 2024, Arena Football One announced that the Crusaders and Monterrey Kings will sit out the 2025 season and debut in 2026.\nCurrent roster\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|+ colspan=\"7\" style=\";text-align:center;\"| Stockton Crusaders roster\n|-\n| style=\"font-size: 95%;vertical-align:top;\" | Quarterbacks\n*Currently vacant\nRunning backs\n*Currently vacant\nWide receivers\n*Currently vacant\n| style=\"width: 25px;\" |\n| style=\"font-size: 95%;vertical-align:top;\" | Offensive linemen\n*Currently vacant\nDefensive linemen\n*Currently vacant\n| style=\"width: 25px;\" |\n| style=\"font-size: 95%;vertical-align:top;\" | Linebackers\n*Currently vacant\nDefensive backs\n*Currently vacant\nSpecial teams\n*Currently vacant\n| style=\"width: 25px;\" |\n| style=\"font-size: 95%;vertical-align:top;\" | Reserve lists\n*Currently vacant\n|-\n|}\nStaff\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
