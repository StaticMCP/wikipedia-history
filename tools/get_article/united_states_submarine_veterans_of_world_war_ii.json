Being unsuccessful in this endeavor Trimble called his old shipmate Ed Branin and they discussed having a reunion which would include the entire World War II Submarine Service of enlisted men and officers.  A two-line reunion announcement was placed in the American Legion magazine Reunions column.  Also, a write-up in Walter Winchell's column in the Bethlehem Times-Leader read as follows:\nFirst National Convention\nThe First National Convention (Reunion) was held at the Ambassador Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey on September 23–25, 1955.  Sixty or so attendees were senior officers and enlisted men still on active duty as well as many retirees and former mess cooks and deck hands.  It was said they had to invite the waiters and bartenders to sit down to make the crowd look bigger.  Out of the 60 or so who registered, only 30 stuck out the reunion.  There were 21 \"Plank Owners\" who attended the first National Convention.  At this reunion Hugh Trimble was appointed as the 1955 National President (Pro-tem).  Ed Branin was appointed as the 1956 National President and Hugh Trimble was appointed Secretary-Treasurer and plans were formulated by the attendees to meet the following year, September 28–30, at the same location.  The first National Convention was considered a total success.\nEvents of 1956\nThree major events took place in 1956.  First was the incorporation of the organization; the second was the Second Annual Convention (Reunion); and third the publication of its very first news bulletin called the Twin Dolphins, published in December 1956.  The Twin Dolphins listed the entire constitution and By-laws, a complete list of the charter members, news briefs, and a condensed version of the second (1956) reunion.\nThe Second Annual Convention (Reunion) was again held in Atlantic City, New Jersey from September 28–30, 1956.  Submarine veterans came from all parts of the country, representing every boat active during World War II.  As expected, New England and the Eastern Seaboard had the greatest number in attendance.  Many men brought their wives.  The group gathered for an informal cocktail party and to meet the officers and founders of the organization.  A supper was held consisting of steamed clams, corn on the cob, hamburgers, salads, and plenty of beer, socializing long into the night.  The next morning the group reassembled for the annual business meeting and election of officers for the new year.  A very solemn memorial service was held on the beach front, with Commander Charles Adams, Chaplain, conducting services.  After special dedications were made for each individual lost boat, the services were ended with the dropping of a large floral wreath from a plane off the coast.  The annual banquet was a gala affair with over 200 in attendance.\nAlthough only in its second year of existence, several states had already organized and District Commanders were appointed to the National Executive Board.  Membership had increased 100% in less than one year.  If a state did not have a chapter aspiring individuals could give their name to the National President and it would be submitted to the Executive Board for approval.  It was in this fashion that the organization experienced rapid growth.\nIncorporation\nThe organization was incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey on February 15, 1956.  The certificate of incorporation was recorded at Trenton, New Jersey.\nFederal Charter\nAt the 1960 San Diego National Convention the first application was made for a Federal Charter.  21 years later after several attempts a Federal Charter was granted on November 20, 1981 during the Ronald Reagan administration under Title 36 of the United States Code, Chapter 2207.\nWorld War II Submarine Combat Patrol Insignia\nOn February 19, 1943 the U.S. Navy Department Permanent Naval Uniform Board discussed a directive from Admiral Ernest King for the design of a Submarine Combat Patrol insignia for crew members of submarines participating in successful combat war patrols.  On March 26, 1943 Acting Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal approved the insignia and the Submarine Combat Patrol Insignia was established.  Regulations provided for award of the insignia to officers and men assigned to submarine duty who completed (since December 7, 1941) one or more patrols during which the submarine sank or assisted in sinking at least one enemy vessel or accomplished a combat mission of comparable importance.\nThe Submarine Combat Patrol insignia could be awarded to crewmen prior to their designation of Qualified in Submarines.  Full pride in the insignia was not realized until it was worn with dolphins.  However, the Commanding Officer of a submarine which conducted a successful war patrol for purposes of awarding the insignia was key in the chain of command for the awarding authority.  As such, he could recommend withholding the award of the insignia by advising the appropriate force or type Commander concerning any officer or enlisted man who he felt was 1) incapable of obtaining the designation of Qualified in Submarines or 2) who failed to display proper efforts to become qualified.  If such officer or enlisted man failed to Qualify in Submarines or show proper effort, the force or type Commander would, after full consideration of the attending circumstances, withhold the award of the Submarine Combat Patrol insignia.\nDigger hat\nThe Australian Digger hat is the official headwear of the organization  and is worn by members at all official functions.  The hats are dark blue in color with a gold band and gold trim on the edges of the brim, with a white plume feather.  The hat remains on when at colors and the wearer salutes.  When inside a building, the hat is always removed.  An exception is the hat is always worn at indoor meetings, it is never removed for prayers, memorial services, or for burials, and is worn during playing of the national anthem.\nThe hat is credited to Ernst T. Rosing who upon conclusion of the war, brought home an Australian Digger hat.  He wore this hat to all meetings and was soon nicknamed Digger by his brother shipmates.  During World War II numerous U.S. submarines were operated from Australia from the ports of Fremantle and Brisbane.\nVest\nVests were never officially adopted as part of the national uniform such as the Digger hats were.  However, the majority of the membership and their wives proudly wear a vest to all official events and gatherings.  The vests come in an array of colors, but most notably blue with gold trim with the National Organization Insignia on the back, usually with the name of the local chapter, and the names and hull numbers of the submarines served upon.  The front of the vests are usually adorned with dolphins, the Submarine Combat Patrol insignia, ribbons, and various unit patches related to the submarines and commands served at.\nLegacy\nWorld War II\nThe United States Navy Submarine Service lost 52 submarines, 374 officers and 3,131 enlisted men during World War II.  These personnel losses represented 16% of the officer and 13% of the enlisted operational personnel. This loss rate was the highest among men and ships of any U.S. Navy unit.\nLess than two percent of American sailors served in submarines, yet that small percentage of men and their boats sank 214  Japanese warships.  This included 1 battleship, 4 large aircraft carriers, 4 small aircraft carriers, 3 heavy cruisers, 8 light cruisers, 43 destroyers, 23 large submarines and 1,178  merchant ships of more than 500 tons.\nIn all, U.S. submarines sank more than 55 percent of all Japanese ships sunk.  More than surface ships, Navy air and the U.S. Army Air Corps combined.\nFleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz summarized their efforts after the war by writing:\n:\nStatus\nWith members of the organization gradually passing away, many of the organizations State Chapters have closed.  Due to this inevitable occurrence many members have chosen to become members and/or joint members with their local United States Submarine Veterans Inc. (USSVI) base to carry on their legacy.\nSubmarine Memorials\nMemorial Park in Albuquerque, New Mexico, dedicated 7 April 1979]]\nThe organization was responsible for the construction and placement of numerous memorials and plaques which honored their fallen comrades and the submarines they served on.\n*52 Boats Memorial, 2010\n*Admiral Nimitz Memorial Plaque\n*Boys Town Memorial, 1962\n*Captain Cromwell Memorial, 1973\n*Church Window Memorial, 1975\n*Fremantle Submarine Memorial, 1967\n* Memorial\n*Hawaii Memorial Plaque, 1976\n*Howard W.
