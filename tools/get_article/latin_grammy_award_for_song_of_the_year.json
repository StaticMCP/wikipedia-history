The award is given to the songwriters of new songs containing at least 51% of lyrics in Spanish or Portuguese language. Instrumental songs or a new version of a previously recorded track are not eligible. Due to the increasing musical changes in the industry, from 2012 the category includes 10 nominees, according to a restructuration made by the academy for the four general categories: Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Best New Artist and Song of the Year.\nSeventeen awarded songs have also earned the Latin Grammy for Record of the Year, which unlike this category, is given to songs that were released on a promotional level, and the prize is given to the performer, producer and audio engineer. The exceptions to this were in 2000, 2009 and 2013 when \"Corazón Espinado\" by Santana featuring Maná, \"No Hay Nadie Como Tú\" by Calle 13 featuring Café Tacvba and \"Vivir Mi Vida\" by Marc Anthony, respectively, received the award without a nomination for Song of the Year.\nAlejandro Sanz is the most awarded songwriter in the category with four wins out of twelve nominations. He's followed by Jorge Drexler and Shakira with three wins. Meanwhile, Andrés Castro, Luis Fonsi, and Carlos Vives have received the award twice. In 2017, Colombian artist Maluma became the first songwriter to have three nominated songs in the same year, with \"Chantaje\", \"Felices los 4\", and \"Vente Pa' Ca\". Claudia Brant, Angie Chirino, Joy Huerta (of the Mexican band Jesse & Joy), Natalia Lafourcade, Shakira, and Mónica Vélez are the only female writers to be awarded. In 2023, Shakira became the first female artist in history to receive three nominations for the category in the same year with \"TQG\", \"Acróstico\", and \"Shakira: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53\", ultimately winning for the latter.\nRecipients\nAn asterisk (*) indicates this recording also won Record of the Year.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"width:98%\"\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"1%\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"15%\" | Songwriter(s)\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"15%\" | Work\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"15%\" | Performing artist(s)\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" width=\"30%\" | Nominees\n|-\n! 2000\n| , Angie Chirino, Marc Anthony & Cory Rooney\n|\n| Marc Anthony\n|\n|-\n! 2001\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2002\n|\n| \"Y Sólo Se Me Ocurre Amarte\" *\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2003\n| Juanes\n|\n| Juanes\n|\n|-\n! 2004\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2005\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2006\n| Shakira & Luis F.
