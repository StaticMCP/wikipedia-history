It was released on July 22, 2014, through Century Media Records. It is the band's first album to feature the same lineup as the previous one.\nBackground\nIn 2013, it was confirmed that Fozzy would begin working on a new record in 2014 and would be looking for a release date during the summer of 2014. The band entered the studio in late January. The first single, \"Lights Go Out\", was released on April 29. Following the release of the new single, the band embarked on the Lights Go Out Tour to promote their new album, playing festivals such as Carolina Rebellion, Rock on the Range, and Download Festival (where they performed on the main stage for the first time in their history). The second single, \"One Crazed Anarchist\" – also the title of singer Chris Jericho's entrance theme when he performed for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) – was released on May 26 and was given away to people that pre-ordered the album. The album was released on July 22 in North America.\nReception\nThe album premiered at No. 54 on the US Billboard 200 chart and marks the band's best-selling first week ever, selling approximately 5,600 copies in its first week.\nTrack listing\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Chart (2014)\n!scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | US Billboard 200\n| 54\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | US Hard Rock Albums\n| 9\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | US Independent Albums\n| 12\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | US Rock Albums\n| 20\n|}\nPersonnel\nMusicians\n* Chris Jericho&nbsp;– lead vocals\n* Rich Ward&nbsp;– guitar, backing vocals\n* Paul Di Leo&nbsp;– bass\n* Frank Fontsere&nbsp;– drums\n* Billy Grey &nbsp;– guitar\n;Additional musicians\n* Michael Starr – additional vocals on \"Tonight\"\n* Christie Cook – co-lead vocals on \"Unstoppable\"\nReferences"
