With the help of Captain Hans Picault, a German anti-Nazi serving with the French Foreign Legion and Colonel A.J. Redding, a battle hardened WW1 veteran, Jack must train, lead and earn the respect of his new squad to become a functioning reconnaissance unit.\nCast\n* Luke Goss as Captain / 1st Lieutenant / Captain Jack Wosick\n* Dolph Lundgren as Captain Hans Picault\n* Chuck Liddell as Sergeant McGreevy\n* Mickey Rourke as Colonel A.J.
