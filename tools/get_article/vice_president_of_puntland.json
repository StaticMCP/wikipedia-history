The first vice president was Mohamed Abdi Hashi. Following the 2024 Vice Presidential Election, Ilyas Osman Lugator was elected in January 2024.\nEstablishment and history\nIn 1998, the self-autonomous Puntland State declared its autonomy, and Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed was chosen as its first president, with Mohamed Abdi Hashi serving as his vice president. Puntland had a single-chamber quasi-legislature called the Council of Elders. Ahmed served in the office of the president from July 23, 1998, to June 30, 2001.\nList of vice presidents\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! scope=\"col\" | Portrait\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Party\n! scope=\"col\" | Election\n! scope=\"col\" | President\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" bgcolor= | 1\n|\n| Mohamed Abdi Hashi\n| Independent\n| 1998\n| Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" bgcolor= | —\n|\n| Ahmed Mohamoud Gunle\n| Independent\n| 2001\n| Jama Ali Jama\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" bgcolor= | 2\n|\n| Mohamed Ali Yusuf\n| Independent\n| 2004\n| Mohamed Abdi Hashi\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" bgcolor= | 3\n|\n| Hassan Dahir Afqurac\n| Independent\n| 2005\n| Mohamud Muse Hersi\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" bgcolor= | 4\n|\n| Abdisamad Ali Shire\n| Horseed\n| 2009\n| Abdirahman Farole\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" bgcolor= | 5\n|\n| Abdihakim Abdullahi Haji Omar\n| Independent\n| 2014\n| Abdiweli Gaas\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" bgcolor= | 6\n|\n| Ahmed Elmi Osman\n| Kaah\n| 2019\n| Said Abdullahi Deni\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" bgcolor= | 7\n|\n| Ilyas Osman Lugator\n| Kaah\n| 2024\n| Said Abdullahi Deni\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links"
