However, it still manages to have its own charm in not only in embracing the ridiculous, but also how openly un-PC it is. It's the kind of film that could have only been made in the halcyon days of the 1990s. Check it out.\"\nThe film gained retrospective cult following.\nSee also\n* List of American films of 1996\n* Girls with guns\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
