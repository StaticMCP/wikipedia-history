When the ceremony was broadcast, Crowe was enraged that the poem was cut. He blamed the producer, Malcolm Gerrie, and confronted him about it. It was reported that the confrontation got physical and there was speculation that it would cost him the Academy Award for Best Actor; Crowe later apologized and ultimately lost the Oscar to Denzel Washington for Training Day.\nThe following poem that was cut is four lines:\n\"To be a poet and not know the trade,\nTo be a lover and repel all women;\nTwin ironies by which great saints are made,\nThe agonising pincer-jaws of heaven.\"\nStatistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Films that received multiple nominations\n! style=\"background:;| Nominations\n! style=\"background:;| Film\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 12\n| The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\n|-\n| Moulin Rouge!\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 9\n| Amélie\n|-\n| Gosford Park\n|-\n| 7\n| Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 6\n| Iris\n|-\n| Shrek\n|-\n| 5\n| A Beautiful Mind\n|-\n| 4\n| Bridget Jones's Diary\n|-\n| 3\n| Black Hawk Down\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" | 2\n| In the Bedroom\n|-\n| Mulholland Drive\n|-\n| The Others\n|-\n| Planet of the Apes\n|-\n| The Shipping News\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Films that received multiple awards\n! style=\"background:;| Awards\n! style=\"background:;| Film\n|-\n| 4\n| The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\n|-\n| 3\n| Moulin Rouge!\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 2\n| Amélie\n|-\n| A Beautiful Mind\n|-\n| Gosford Park''\n|}\nSee also\n* 74th Academy Awards\n* 27th César Awards\n* 7th Critics' Choice Awards\n* 54th Directors Guild of America Awards\n* 15th European Film Awards\n* 59th Golden Globe Awards\n* 22nd Golden Raspberry Awards\n* 6th Golden Satellite Awards\n* 16th Goya Awards\n* 17th Independent Spirit Awards\n* 7th Lumière Awards\n* 13th Producers Guild of America Awards\n* 28th Saturn Awards\n* 8th Screen Actors Guild Awards\n* 54th Writers Guild of America Awards\nReferences"
