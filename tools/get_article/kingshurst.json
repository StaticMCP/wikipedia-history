Historically part of the county of Warwickshire in the Meriden Rural District, It lies about  north of Solihull town centre,  east of Birmingham and 13 miles (21km) northwest of Coventry, it borders North Warwickshire to the east. The village is encompassed within the electoral ward Kingshurst & Fordbridge which had a population of 7,868 in the 2011 census.\nHistory of Kingshurst\nThe name Kingshurst comes from having previously been a Royal Manor, and \"hurst\" meaning wood. The earliest record of Kingshurst is in documents from the late 13th and early 14th centuries, when it is referred to as part of the Manor of Coleshill. Tenant farming was administered from here and Simon de Montford of Coleshill was an English nobleman who built a moated manor house in Kingshurst. The Hall had its own park and farmlands.\nKingshurst Hall Manor House\nKingshurst Hall was a large country manor house surrounded by a moat, built around 1390 by Sir William Montfort, son of Sir Baldwin Montfort. Kingshurst took on an independent existence from Coleshill with the arrival of the Mountfords. It is unclear how Kingshurst came into their possession although it is probable that they bought the area around 1332 from the Clintons, who were then Lords of the Manor at Coleshill. What is certain is that they were in possession by about 1352. The Manor House was demolished in 1969 to accommodate post war housing for the ever expanding nearby Birmingham.\nYorkswood Forest\nDuring World War I, much of the woodland in Kingshurst was cut down to help with the war effort. The Birmingham and District Association of Boy Scouts were able to buy a patch of land from the WarwickshireMeriden Rural District at a bargain price and set up a permanent camp there. This land was halfway between Kingshurst and Shard End. It was called Yorkswood and opened in 1923. There were five camp fields, covering an area of . The total site was over . The site benefited from permanent washhouses and latrines, a swimming-pool, a training centre and headquarters, guesthouse, warden's hut and other huts. A small brook from a fresh water spring ran past the camp and Cock Sparrow Farm was about  away to provide fresh milk.\nThe entrance to the camp was flanked by a series of griffin statues. These had come from the roof of Lewis's Department Store on Corporation Street in Birmingham when it was being renovated. After the camp closed in 1972, they were placed on the housing estate over the border in Birmingham's Kendrick Avenue and nearby roads built upon the site of the camp. The forest acts as a border between Birmingham and Solihull to this day.\nPost War Development\nShortly after the travesty of the Second World War, housing was needed to allocate civilians who had been bombed out of their homes in the nearby city of Birmingham. The Birmingham Corporation purchased the site which is now the eastern part of the village from the Meriden Rural District in 1949. Here was erected tower blocks, maisonettes and council housing nestled in the Warwickshire countryside. A few thousand families from the slums of inner city Birmingham migrated to the rural village in start of a new beginning. Bus routes were created to bridge transport connectivity between the village and the city.\nThe private development to the east of Gilson Way are detached and semi detached dwellings, they are the most expensive homes in north Solihull behind Castle Bromwich and Marston Green. The roads in this area are named after nearby Warwickshire villages, eg: Moxhull Road, Gilson Way, Meriden Drive. The shopping precinct was built in the 1960's and was at the time 'state of the art'. It was demolished in 2023 to make way for the redevelopment of Kingshurst. Nearby Shard End, Fordbridge, Chelmsley Wood and Smith's Wood began to swallow up the rural landscape around Kingshurst in the 1960's and 70's as part of an extended overspill for housing in the wider Birmingham metropolitan area. The M6 was also built during this time, it created a natural border between the Metropolitan Borough of Solihull and North Warwickshire, where rural green belt is still present.\n2022 Lake Tragedy\nOn Sunday 11 December 2022, four boys from the village, Finlay, Thomas, Samuel and Jack were taken to hospital in a critical condition, after falling under the ice and into the freezing water. By 15 December 2022, it was confirmed that all four children had died.\nKingshurst today\nKingshurst is now mainly a suburban/semi-rural residential area of Solihull. Built in the 1950s in the Meriden Rural District of Warwickshire, it now lies within the north of the Metropolitan Borough of Solihull.

There are a substantial number of large houses in the village (east of Gilson Way and south of the lake), and a housing estate in the west.

The garden is the first of its kind in Solihull, and the project took place between 2023 and 2024 by sponsors and volunteers from Birmingham Airport, Galliford Try and other notable companies. The allotment dates back to the 1940s.\nPavilions Club\nThe Pavilions Club on Meriden Drive was built in the 1960s, then modernised in 2016. It is a sports and social club with kitchen facilities.
