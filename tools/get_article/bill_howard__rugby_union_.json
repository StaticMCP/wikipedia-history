He spent his entire career with Old Birkonians, which he captained, and gained regular selection for Cheshire.\nHoward was overlooked by England selectors, in part by the fact he didn't play for a high-profile club, but did win a place on the British Lions squad for their 1938 tour to South Africa. Over the course of the trip, Howard featured in 10 tour fixtures, including the first of the three Tests against the Springboks.\nIn 1962–63, Howard served as president of Cheshire RFU.\nSee also\n*List of British & Irish Lions players\nReferences"
