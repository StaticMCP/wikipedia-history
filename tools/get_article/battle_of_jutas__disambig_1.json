Before the battle the Swedish army was in retreat after the campaign of the previous summer. The main Swedish force was retreating from Vaasa to Nykarleby. The Russians sent a force to cut off the Swedish retreat. In response the Swedes sent a force under Georg Carl von Döbeln to intercept them. The battle ended in a Swedish victory, but the main Swedish army was defeated in the Battle of Oravais the very next day.\nThe battle is described in Johan Ludvig Runeberg's Döbeln at Jutas in his epic Finnish National Poem Fänrik Ståls Sägner.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
