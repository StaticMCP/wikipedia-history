It is currently tied with the Biles vault as the vault with the second-highest D-score. It is named after Yelena Produnova of Russia, who was the first woman to complete it successfully in 1999. Produnova's coach, Leonid Arkayev, bet her that she could not perform the vault.  The D-score of the Produnova has been slowly reduced over the quads from 7.1 (2009–2012), to 7.0 (2013–2016), to 6.4 (2017–2020). In the 2022–2024 Code of Points, it has been reduced to a D-score of 6.0.\nThe vault is dangerous because a gymnast could break her neck if she fell short of two rotations. At the 2016 Summer Olympics, Uzbek gymnast Oksana Chusovitina attempted the Produnova but fell. The vault is termed the \"vault of death\" due to its high level of difficulty and likelihood of injury. Asked why she did not perform the vault, Simone Biles stated, \"I’m not trying to die.\"\nGymnasts who have successfully completed the Produnova\n*  (1999)\n*  (2011)\n*  (2014)\n*  (2014 and 2016)\n*\nReferences"
