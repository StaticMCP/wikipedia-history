Campbell losing a number of seats to their Progressive Conservative rivals. The decrease of the 26 to 6 Liberal majority to a slim 17 to 15 lead over the PC, and the resignation of Alex Campbell, led to an unstable legislature, and another election was held just one year later in 1979.\nParty standings\n{| style=\"width:55%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ ↓\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:#EA6D6A; width:53.13%;\" | 17\n| style=\"background:#9999FF; width:46.87%;\" | 15\n|-\n| Liberal\n| PC\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Party Leader\n!colspan=\"3\"|Seats\n!colspan=\"3\"|Popular Vote\n|-\n!1974\n!Elected\n!Change\n!#\n!%\n!Change\n|Liberal\n|Alex Campbell\n! align=right|26\n! align=right|17\n| align=right|-9\n! align=right|64,133\n! align=right|50.7%\n| align=right|-3.3%\n|\n|Angus MacLean\n| align=right|6\n| align=right|15\n| align=right|+9\n| align=right|60,878\n| align=right|48.1%\n| align=right|+8.2%\n|\n|Aquinas Ryan\n| align=right|0\n| align=right|0\n| align=right|-\n| align=right|1,173\n| align=right|0.9%\n| align=right|-5.3%\n|colspan=\"2\"|\n| align=right|-\n| align=right|0\n| align=right|-\n| align=right|257\n| align=right|0.2%\n| align=right|+0.2%\n|-\n|}\n|50.72}}\n|48.15}}\n|0.93}}\n|0.20}}}}|53.13}}\n|46.87}}}}\nMembers elected\nThe Legislature of Prince Edward Island had two levels of membership from 1893 to 1996 - Assemblymen and Councillors. This was a holdover from when the Island had a bicameral legislature, the General Assembly and the Legislative Council.\nIn 1893, the Legislative Council was abolished and had its membership merged with the Assembly, though the two titles remained separate and were elected by different electoral franchises. Assembleymen were elected by all eligible voters of within a district. Before 1963, Councillors were only elected by landowners within a district, but afterward they were elected in the same manner as Assemblymen.\nKings\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
