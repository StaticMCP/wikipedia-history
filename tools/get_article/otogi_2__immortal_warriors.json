In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one seven, two eights, and one seven, for a total of 30 out of 40. Otogi 2 was a runner-up for GameSpots 2004 \"Best Voice Acting\" award, which went to Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.\nThe game sold poorly, however. Responding to a letter questioning why Electronic Gaming Monthly ran such a short review on Otogi 2, Dan Hsu, editor-in-chief of the publication, stated, \"As good of a game Otogi 2 is, we still have to acknowledge that relatively few people want to read about it.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
