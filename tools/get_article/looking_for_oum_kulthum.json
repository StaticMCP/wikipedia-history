In the words of What Women Want Magazine “the movie also witnesses a mesmerizing selection of incredible gowns from Oum Kulthum’s iconic wardrobe, designed by the talented Italian costume designer Mariano Tufano. The designer was given 8 weeks to design hundreds of dresses for the characters and 350 dresses were made with initiatives from six different decades. According to Vogue Arabi, “While most of the clothes were custom-made in Tufano’s Casablanca workshops, there were hordes of extras who needed ensembles too. The costume designer and his staff collected their images of old Egypt, and traversed around London, Rome, and Marrakech for shoes, accessories, and jewelry. Tufano sought assistance from Gerardo Sacco, a popular Italian jeweler, to help recreate the unique diamond earrings Kulthum was known to spot.”\nSpecial exhibitions, unveiling and screening\nLooking for Oum Kulthum” was unveiled at the Venice Film Festival in 2017.

Again was that Oum Kulthum had never appeared in short sleeve dresses and had a perfect voice that never choked. But the film portrayed the opposite. Another was on the home town of Oum Kulthum which the critics said was not backward as was shown in the film.\nCast\n* Yasmin Raeis as Ghada.\n* Neda Rahmanian as Mitra.\n* Mehdi Moinzadeh as Amir.\n* Kais Nashef as Ahmad/Latif\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
