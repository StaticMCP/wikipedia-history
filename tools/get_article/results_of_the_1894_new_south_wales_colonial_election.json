The election was conducted on the basis of a simple majority or first-past-the-post voting system. There were three significant changes from the 1891 election, the abolition of multi-member constituencies, the abolition of plural voting where an elector had property or residence in more than one electorate and that polls for every district were held on the same day. The number of seats was reduced from 141 to 125. In this election, in 74 electorates the winning candidate received less than 50% of the votes, while 1 was uncontested. The average number of enrolled voters per electorate was 2,046, ranging from Lismore (1,360) to Marrickville (2,924).\nElection results\nAlbury\n}}\nAlma\n}}\nAnnandale\n}}\nArgyle\n}}\n|   |\n| colspan=\"2\"   |  win\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | (previously 2 members)\nThomas Rose (Protectionist) was one of two sitting members for Argyle.
