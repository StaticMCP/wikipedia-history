(In 1956, times were only recorded to the nearest tenth of a second.) Ray Norton also recorded a time of 10.1 seconds in 1959. The first person to run unambiguously faster in competition was Armin Hary in 1960.\nHe also jointly held the world 100 yard record with a time of 9.3 seconds.\nKing, along with Murchison, Thane Baker, and Bobby Morrow, won a gold medal at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne in the 4 × 100 metre relay. He ran the second leg of the race.\nAfter retiring from athletics, King returned to his job as a schoolteacher, living in Delano, California. He had been a successful student athlete, breaking and making records, at Delano High School, making the finals at the CIF California State Meet in both the 100 yard dash and 220 yard dash each of his four years, winning the 100 once and the 220 twice.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
