Its purpose was to confront the Spanish columns that operated there, and that supply the Spanish detachments of the central line, especially Bayamo, the head of the district.\nOn July 5, 1895, Brigadier Jesús Rabí joined forces from Jiguaní in Cacao, and on July 7 they camped on the Buey River, in the area of Valenzuela, southwest of Bayamo.\nSpanish Operations\nGeneral Arsenio Martínez Campos and Brigadier Fidel A. Santocildes coordinated the organization of the Spanish convoys, coming from Manzanillo and Cauto Embarcadero to Bayamo.\nOn July 11, Santocildes, with a short column of 400 men made up of two companies from the 1st and 2nd battalions of the Isabel La Católica regiment, and 40 guerrillas from Captain Travesí, left Manzanillo for Veguitas.\nOn July 12, Martínez Campos, with a small column of about 450 men made up of the Spanish forces of Lieutenant Colonel Baquero and the guerrillas of Lieutenant Colonel Lolo Benítez, left Manzanillo for Veguitas, joining Santocildes. Then they are joined by 250 soldiers from the 6th peninsular battalion under the command of Lieutenant Colonel San Martín and 400 soldiers from the 2nd battalion of the Isabel La Católica regiment under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Federico Escario. The Spanish forces stationed in Veguitas would be a total 1,500 troops. The presence of the Spanish forces is informed to Major General Maceo by Rafael Silveira.\nPreparation for the Ambush\nOn July 12, Maceo with his forces in Vega de Yao began to develop their tactical plan, the attack would be on the convoy from Manzanillo. On the same day, Major General Bartolomé Masó, head of the 2nd Liberation Army Corps, with his staff and the forces of Colonels Esteban Tamayo, Joaquín Estrada and Juan Masó Parra arrived at the Maceo camp, pasture in Valenzuela, where he interview.\nUpon retiring, Masó left Maceo some squadrons of cavalry with colonels Esteban Tamayo, Joaquín Estrada and Juan Masó Parra. At midnight, by order of Maceo, the forces of the liberating army move towards Solís. On July 13 at dawn, Maceo sets up the Vega de Yao camp, and is located in El Santísimo, (a place that dominates the two routes from Barrancas to Bayamo), with the cavalry. The infantry troops of Brigadier Jesús Rabí and Colonel Quintin Banderas, are located on the road to Solís, lower route. The rearguard is located in La Caoba (Brigadier Alfonso Goulet) and in Yao del Gallego (Major General Bartolomé Masó). The arrival of more Cuban reinforcements from Manzanillo would be expected.\nThe Battle\nThe Spanish Evasion of the Ambush\nMartínez Campos had 400 infantry and 40 horsemen and heads for Barrancas, while Santocildes with 1,100 infantry and guerrillas travel to either Bueycito or Valenzuela, both meet and cross the Buey river pass and then divide, joining both in Barrancas. Campos informed by confidants of the presence of the Mambises in El Tanteo and other positions, evadeded the surprise attack.\nAttack of the Spanish to the Cuban rearguard\nBoth Spanish generals with a column of 1,540 men, depart from Barrancas along the Solís road which was thelower route, and separating at Magueyes, Campos reinforced with Captain Travesí's Guerrilla by the Peralejo road and Santocildes penetrating the mountain in a parallel direction from Martínez Campos, outwitting the ambushes of Rabí's infantry and attacking Alfonso Goulet's impedimenta.\nThe guerrilla forces had been waiting for almost six hours, and around ten in the morning the battle began in La Caoba, between the forces of Santocildes and Goulet, who died in the confrontation.\nCounterattack of Maceo's forces\nMaceo steps forward with his staff to examine the order and position of the enemy. Maceo ordered the infantry to flank to the right and interpose themselves between the Spanish and La Caoba, while he and the cavalry stopped them, and Commander Moncada fell.\nThe Campos column joins the fight, while Maceo orders a squad to attack it while it was harassed by the guerrilla infantry, to avoid the union of the two Spanish columns. The Santocildes column moves away from La Caoba to meet the Campos column, and together they head to the Peralejos savanna. The Cuban infantry positioned themselves on the enemy's right flank, in the nearby mountains of the road, while the Cuban cavalry did so on the left in the Peralejo savanna (escort from the Maceo headquarters, Luz de Yara regiment squadron, squadron of the Cespedes regiment) and on the right of the road above Bacajama, near Mabay (squadron of the Cespedes regiment).\nArrival of Cuban Reinforcements\nThe reinforcements from Manzanillo, who cross the Babatuaba River, arrive at Maceo: 3 squadrons of the Guá regiment under the command of Colonel Salvador Hernández Ríos and Lieutenant Colonel Alonso Rivero, from Campechuela, adding 250 men, following Maceo's orders for concentration of forces. The reinforcement is attacked by the guerrillas accidentally.\nWithdrawal of the Spanish forces\nMaceo sends two squadrons of Lieutenant Colonel Rivero to join the cavalry, and Colonel Ríos's squad to join Headquarters. Under the Cuban attack, the Spanish forces managed to reach the Mabay River, while the Cubans occupied the Mabay River pass, among them Maceo with his staff and the Guá regiment squad.\nThe Spanish flee, while the Cuban infantry runs out of ammunition, Maceo orders the squad of the Cespedes regiment near Mabay to join the cavalry and attack the enemy. The Spaniards were harshly harassed until El Dátile, and were weakly persecuted until Bayamo. Campos with the column managed to escape towards Bayamo.\nIn the skirmish by the Spanish army there are 28 casualties, including Brigadier Santocildes, and some 98 wounded; while in the rebel army there are 118 casualties among the dead (Brigadier Alfonso Goulet, Colonel Carlos Suárez and Lieutenant Colonel Manuel la O Jay, Commander Moncada, fell) and wounded.\nMaceo establishes his headquarters in Santa Gertrudis (near Bayamo), besieging Bayamo. Later, Maceo continues the First Eastern Campaign towards Santiago de Cuba.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Colectivo de Autores: Diccionario Enciclopédico de Historia Militar de Cuba. Tomos I y II.
