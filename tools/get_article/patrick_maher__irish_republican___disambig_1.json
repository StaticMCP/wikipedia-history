He was 32 years old at the time of his death.\nBackground\nA native of County Limerick, Maher was hanged along with Edmond Foley for his alleged involvement in the rescue of Seán Hogan at Knocklong Railway Station on 13 May 1919 in which two Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) officers were killed.\nTrial and Execution\nUnlike Foley, Maher had no direct involvement in the rescue. He merely worked at the station grading poultry and eggs and he was at a crossroads three miles away at the time of the ambush. Maher strongly protested his innocence. Two civilian juries failed to reach a verdict. He was finally convicted of involvement by a military court-martial and sentenced to death.\nIn a final message to other members of the IRA, Foley and Maher wrote:\nReinterment\nMaher is one of a group of men hanged and buried in Mountjoy in the period 1920–21, commonly referred to as The Forgotten Ten. In 2001 Maher and the other nine, including Kevin Barry, were exhumed and given a full State funeral.\nHe is the only one of the ten men not to be buried in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin. In accordance with his wishes and those of his family, he is buried at Ladywell Graveyard in Ballylanders, County Limerick.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
