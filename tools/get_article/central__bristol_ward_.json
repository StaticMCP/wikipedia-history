The ward is represented by two members on Bristol City Council, which  are Ani Stafford-Townsend and Sibusiso Tshabalala of the Green Party of England and Wales.\nThe ward was created ahead of the 2016 United Kingdom local elections, following a boundary review by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England. It includes part of the former Cabot ward.\nArea profile\nCentral ward covers much of the city centre, including Broadmead, Redcliffe, and Queen Square, an area bound by the New Cut river to the south and the inner circuit road to the east. To the north, it extends to include the western side of Stokes Croft and the Dove Street housing estate. It also extends into the west end, to include an area bound by Park Street to the south, Whiteladies Road to the west, and Kingsdown to the south. It therefore includes Bristol Royal Infirmary, Bristol Children's Hospital, and the core of the University of Bristol campus. Other areas which some might consider to be part of Bristol city centre are not in Central ward, such as Temple Quay and Bristol Temple Meads railway station, which are in Lawrence Hill ward; and College Green and Canon's Marsh, which are in Hotwells and Harbourside ward.\nThe ward includes much of the city's central business district, with several large and many small employers. It therefore supports around 112,000 jobs, far higher than any other ward in the city. Central ward also records the highest crime rate in Bristol, with 476.6 crimes per 1,000 resident population in 2022-23 (compared to a Bristol average of 113.8).\nCentral ward had a resident population of 18,390 in the 2021 United Kingdom census. Of these, 37.6% were born outside the UK, significantly higher than the 18.8% Bristol average. Nearly half (49.4%) of residents were aged 16 to 24 years, and 29.2% lived in a communal establishment, reflecting the large number of student halls of residence in the ward.\nWith a high density urban form, 93.2% of homes are apartments, significantly higher than the 35.2% Bristol average. 43.7% are one person households, and 18.9% are multiple-family households. At 21%, home ownership is significantly lower than the 54.8% Bristol average, and private renting is significantly higher (58.3% vs 26.4% average).\nJust 10.4% of households have dependant children, significantly below the 26.7% Bristol average. Of those children, a high percentage live in low income families (39.8%, compared to 21.8% Bristol average), with a high proportion known to social services (4.6%, compared to 2.4% Bristol average).\nLife expectancy for residents of Central Ward is 74.1 years, statistically significantly lower than Bristol average of 77.8 years, and the ward has the highest rate of premature mortality in the city.\nAt the 2021 census, 57.3% of households in Central ward did not have a car, the highest rate in Bristol.\nOn measures of deprivation, there is large variation between areas within the ward, with pockets of very high measures of deprivation. Redcliffe South and Stokes Croft West, both areas with high-rise council housing, are in the most deprived decile of areas in England. By contrast, Woodland Road and University in the west of the ward rank lower than average on measures of deprevation.\nFor elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, Central is in Bristol Central constituency. Before the 2024 boundary changes, it was in Bristol West constituency.\nLocal elections\n2024 election\n}}\n2021 election\nThe 2021 election was notable for the defeat of Kye Dudd, who had been cabinet member for transport on the council, as part of a city-wide swing to the Green Party.\n}}\n2016 election\nReferences"
