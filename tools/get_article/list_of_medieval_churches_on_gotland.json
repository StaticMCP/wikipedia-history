Benefiting from its location in the middle of the Baltic Sea, the island enjoyed an increase in wealth thanks to expanding trade between Western and Eastern Europe, giving the inhabitants the means to build large and prestigious churches. The preserved churches date from between the early 12th century and the middle of the 14th century.  The first churches were stave churches, but of these only fragments remain. The oldest substantially preserved churches on Gotland are simple Romanesque churches. Church architecture remained conservative on Gotland, and, while Gothic forms eventually replaced Romanesque, it never acquired the structurally light character it did elsewhere in Europe. The churches built during the first half of the 14th century on Gotland are sometimes referred to as \"counter-Gothic\" () in Swedish literature.\nThe churches were often decorated inside with paintings on walls and vaults and stained-glass windows, as well as decorative sculptures both inside and outside. In the Gothic period particularly, the portals of the churches were adorned with stone sculptures. Workshops specialising in the production of decorated baptismal fonts established themselves on Gotland during the 12th century and supplied the churches with fonts, which in many cases still exist in the churches. Wooden sculptures were also produced from an early time, including rood crosses and sculptures of saints like the Viklau Madonna.\nIn the middle of the 14th century, Gotland entered a period of decline and turmoil, and suffered a loss of trade from which the island would never recover. No new churches were built on the island after around 1350. In Visby, only Visby Cathedral was maintained, while other churches, of which there were at least twelve, were left to decay. The systematic study of the churches on Gotland began in the 19th century.\nBackground\nThe Christianisation of Scandinavia, whereby Norse religion was gradually replaced by Christianity, began in the 9th century. During the 11th century, a church organisation with bishops and dioceses was established, and Norse religion was finally abandoned. Gotland became a part of the Diocese of Linköping, probably during the middle of the 12th century, and would remain so until the creation of the Diocese of Visby in 1572. Thanks to its location within the Baltic Sea, Gotland benefited economically from an increase in trade between Eastern and Western Europe during the Middle Ages giving the inhabitants the financial means to construct large, prestigious churches.\nThe first churches on Gotland were wooden stave churches, but they were used for a relatively short time before stone churches began to replace them. Traces of around ten stave churches have been found on Gotland. The most well-preserved remains are those of Hemse stave church, whose timber had been re-used as floor boards in a later stone church. Wooden churches were built over a time span of a bit less than 100 years,  1120–1200. These first churches were probably not parish churches in the modern sense, but erected on private initiative adjacent to rich farmsteads by members of the local elite. (However, Gotland differed from much of Europe in that there was no land-owning aristocracy of the island.) Later, church building became a communal undertaking, where several peasants joined forces to finance a church. In the Hanseatic town of Visby the situation differed from that in the countryside. There, many of the churches were constructed by religious orders, confraternities or foreign merchants; present-day Visby Cathedral originally served the German traders of the city. More churches were eventually built in Visby than in any other city in medieval Sweden, and there were at least 12 churches within the city wall. Only Visby Cathedral remains, the rest having been preserved as ruins only.\nArchitecture\ns, such as this by Hegvald in Stånga Church, have been preserved on Gotland.]]\nThe first stone churches on Gotland were built in the first half of the 12th century. They were simple Romanesque churches. They were constructed without a socle or base, and had undecorated, narrow, round-arched portals. Sometimes they were decorated with friezes of reliefs depicting religious or possibly mythological subjects; some of these have been preserved by being re-used and incorporated in later, Gothic structures. These earliest churches display stylistic influences from both Western and Eastern Europe, the latter especially evident in the Russo-Byzantine church murals in Garde Church. During the second half of the 12th century, stylistic tendencies shifted decisively towards Western Europe. The construction site of Lund Cathedral in Scania spread influences from present-day Germany. The establishment of the Cistercian Roma Abbey on Gotland in 1164 would have a lasting influence on church architecture on Gotland, which came to incorporate several elements from Cistercian architecture. These include both certain notable details, such as chancels lacking apses, with straight walls facing east containing three lancet windows, but also a general tendency towards a relatively austere architecture. Inside, these churches were probably all decorated with murals, but very few of these have been preserved. A greater number of Romanesque furnishings have been preserved. Workshops specialising in making sculpted baptismal fonts were established on Gotland during the 12th century and not only supplied the churches on Gotland with decorated fonts, but also exported fonts to the entire Baltic region. Several of these workshops have been given notnames by later art historians, such as Majestatis and Byzantios, while other labels, such as Sigraf and Hegvald, derive from inscriptions found on the fonts. A number of wooden sculptures have also been preserved from this time, including the Viklau Madonna, one of the most well-preserved 12th-century wooden sculptures in Europe, and a number of rood crosses from the same workshop.\nwhich still have traces of the original paint.]]\nA boom in church building began on Gotland around 1225. New churches were erected and older churches were rebuilt. During this period, a local variant of Gothic architecture would replace the earlier Romanesque style. The churches became considerably larger, with vaults supported by pillars and divided into several bays. Apses were no longer built. Another peculiarity is that the north side of the churches almost always lacked windows; whether for practical, religious or superstitious reasons is not known. Stylistically, a conservative Early Gothic style, still strongly reminiscent of Romanesque through its heavy volumes and often round arches, would prevail until the end of the 13th century. Influences came from Westphalia, conveyed via Visby, an indication of the trade connections of the time. At the end of the 13th and early 14th century the style shifted towards what is often referred to as High Gothic In contrast to earlier churches, these churches have decidedly Gothic forms such as larger, pointed arch windows and more slender pillars supporting higher vaults. Several of them are decorated with murals. Also more stained glass windows are preserved from this period, and the churches of Gotland contain the largest amount of medieval stained glass in Sweden, with Lye Church containing the largest intact set in the Nordic countries. From  1320 until around 1360, the last great building period took place on Gotland. Stylistically, there is a change towards a heavier architecture, which in Swedish literature sometimes is referred to as \"counter-Gothic\" (). While purely Gothic in details such as windows and portals, the architecture does not strive for lighter volumes and soaring heights, with walls dissolved into large expanses of windows supported by buttresses and pilasters. Structurally, the churches instead again tended towards more closed-in, darker spaces and heavier volumes. During the entire Gothic period, the main portals of the churches were often richly decorated. During the Early and High Gothic period, this decoration often consisted of stylised floral decoration. During the 14th century, the decoration became more profuse and also narrative, often depicting religious or mythological scenes on the capitals of the portal columns. These sculptures were originally painted in vivid colours. The church towers erected during this period are also considerably taller than before. A single workshop, today known by its notname as  after some of the sculptures that have features vaguely reminiscent of the art of ancient Egypt, appears to have been employed in a large number of churches.\nIn the middle of the 14th century, Gotland entered a period of economic decline and a loss in trade from which it would never recover. At the same time, the Black Death struck Gotland in 1350. The invasion of Gotland by Valdemar IV of Denmark and the Battle of Visby (1361) led to further disruptions. All these factors appear to have contributed to decreasing building activity, even though it remains difficult to pinpoint exact causes and effects in the building histories of individual churches. Many churches were left unfinished, and the abrupt halt in construction is often still visible in the buildings. Archaeologist Anders Andrén writes that it is \"as if the stone masons had left the construction site for the day and never returned\". Many churches on Gotland thus have a peculiar form, where often the chancel is disproportionally large in comparison with the rest of the church. In such cases, a planned reconstruction of the entire church had started during the 14th century with the chancel, but was brought to a halt before the whole reconstruction scheme could be finished.\nAfter the second half of the 14th century, no new churches were built on Gotland. Inside, some churches did receive further embellishment in the form of new altarpieces or murals into the 15th and 16th centuries.  Following the Reformation, changes in the liturgy led to the installation of new types of fittings, including pulpits and different kinds of altarpieces. Many altarpieces were made locally in Burgsvik during the 17th century and today often give a Baroque touch to the medieval churches. While the churches on Gotland have attracted interest since at least the 17th century, a more scientific approach to them started only during the 19th century. Art historian Johnny Roosval presented a first systematic study in Die Kirchen Gotlands (\"The churches of Gotland\"), published in German in 1911. Roosval dated the different churches on Gotland mainly on stylistic grounds. The timeline he established has subsequently been revised in individual cases, both by Roosval and by others. Overall, Roosval's assumptions about the age of the churches on Gotland are still widely accepted. Archaeological examinations in connection with renovations of the churches in particular during the 20th century served to further tweak the dates in individual cases but also to confirm the overall timeline. In a few cases where contemporary scientific methods have been used to examine the churches, radiocarbon dating and to a lesser extent dendrochronology have also lent some support to the established timeline.\nThe churches\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:100px\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:100px\" | Location\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:100px\" class=\"unsortable\"| Image\n! scope=\"col\"  class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n|-\n| Akebäck Church || }} ||  || Akebäck Church is an unusually well-preserved  Romanesque church, possibly inaugurated in 1149. The nave, chancel and apse were built at the end of the 12th century, the tower slightly later. Only the sacristy is significantly later, constructed in 1931. A picture stone was found immured in one of the walls in the 1930s, and is today displayed outside the church. The altarpiece is from the 17th century but contains fragments of an earlier altarpiece.\n|-\n| Ala Church || }} ||  || The oldest part of Ala Church is the nave, which has an upper floor that appears to have functioned as a defensive structure, built around 1170–1180. The tower was erected around 1240. The current chancel replaced an earlier chancel and apse around 1250. The tower spire was designed in the 18th century. In 1938 a fire destroyed much of the church, which was repaired and rebuilt without altering the structure. It was re-inaugurated in 1940.\n|-\n| Alskog Church || }} ||  || The first church was probably a wooden church. The oldest part of the now-visible church is the Romanesque nave, from the first quarter of the 13th century. It was followed by the construction of the tower in the second quarter of the same century. The Gothic chancel was constructed  1300. Its south portal is decorated in a style similar to the south portal of Garde Church. Fragments of murals by the Passion Master as well as a few medieval stained glass windows remain in the church. The rood cross, probably made by a German artist, is from the last quarter of the 12th century. The church contains several other medieval pieces of art, including four wooden statuettes, a baptismal font, a censer, a bell, candelabra and collection trays made of oak.\n|-\n| Alva Church || }} ||  || The nave and chancel of Alva Church are in a late Romanesque style, built in the early 13th century. The tower was erected approximately 100 years later. It was originally intended to be taller but for some reason it was never finished. Alva Church contains church murals from 1520, and a large rood cross from the middle of the 13th century.\n|-\n| Anga Church || }} ||  || Anga Church is an early Romanesque church with an apse. It was probably preceded by a wooden church. It was constructed at the end of the 12th century, inaugurated in 1200. Construction continued during the 13th century and a new consecration seems to have taken place in 1286. The altarpiece is from  1370. The walls are decorated with church murals from the 15th century. The church was pillaged by Russian troops in 1717. The sacristy was added at the beginning of the 19th century. A large renovation was carried out 1946–47.\n|-\n| Ardre Church || }} ||  || Ardre Church is one of the smallest churches on Gotland. The church dates from the 13th century and replaced an earlier, Romanesque church built during the 12th century. The portal of the chancel is the only thing that remains from the first church. Medieval stained glass windows have been preserved in the chancel. The altarpiece is from the 14th century, while both the baptismal font and the rood cross are from the 13th century. The church also possesses a wooden Madonna from around 1500. The interior was heavily restored by Axel Haig between 1900 and 1902; Haig also designed the church organ.\n|-\n| Atlingbo Church || }} ||  || The Gutasaga mentions a church in Atlingbo. A first, wooden church was probably constructed in the 11th century. The presently-visible church however dates from the 13th century. During the Middle Ages it was a so-called \"asylum church\" (); i.e. a church where persons accused of having committed crimes were entitled to seek refuge for some time. It contains a baptismal font by Byzantios (12th century). Its altarpiece was made in the 17th century, as was the pulpit (1693).\n|-\n| Barlingbo Church || }} ||  || The extant, Gothic church replaced an earlier, Romanesque church. The oldest part is the chancel and the sacristy, from the early 13th century. The nave is from the middle of the same century, and its vaults and the tower date from  1280. The church contains medieval murals from several different periods, the oldest dating from the construction period of the chancel. The baptismal font is of an unusual design, unlike any other on Gotland. It is richly decorated with religious imagery, including the symbols of the Four Evangelists and their names carved in runes.\n|-\n| Björke Church || }} ||  || Björke Church was built during the 13th century. The chancel was enlarged during the 14th century, but a planned tower was never constructed. The church contains a number of medieval furnishings, including the baptismal font, the rood cross, wooden sculptures and the church tabernacle. The pulpit is also one of the oldest on Gotland, from 1594.\n|-\n| Boge Church || }} ||  || The chancel with the sacristy are the oldest parts of the church, constructed in an Early Gothic style in the middle of the 13th century. The wide and short nave is from the second half of the same century, and replaced an earlier nave. The medieval tower was destroyed in an 1857 storm and a new tower was built between 1867 and 1892. The vaults of the church were also damaged when the tower collapsed, and replaced in 1925. The church contains murals from two different time periods: the middle of the 13th century and the middle of the 15th century. Most of the furnishings are from the 18th century, but the plain baptismal font is from the 13th century.\n|-\n| Bro Church || }} ||  || Bro Church lies on what was probably previously a pagan sacred site. The presently-visible church was built in stages between the early 13th century and the end of the 14th century, and is one of the most well-preserved medieval churches on Gotland. An unusual Romanesque frieze is immured in the facade. It was probably salvaged from an earlier church on the same site. The interior is decorated with several medieval murals. The church also has a baptismal font made by the sculptor Sigraf. Several of the other furnishings are Baroque in style.\n|-\n| Bunge Church || }} ||  || The oldest part of the church is the tower, built in the 12th century. The nave and chancel are from the 14th century, and are in a High Gothic style. The churchyard is surrounded by a wall which originally had a defensive purpose, and the church door still bears marks from crossbow bolts. The whole church may have been fortified by the Teutonic Order when they ruled over Gotland. The church is decorated with murals, including one set depicting fighting knights from the late 14th century or early 15th century.\n|-\n| Burs Church || }} ||  || The disproportionately small nave is the oldest part of Burs Church, built at the beginning of the 13th century. The large tower, supported by unusually-shaped buttresses, dates from the middle of the same century. The chancel was constructed in the 14th century, probably by Egypticus, replacing a Romanesque chancel and apse. The sacristy was probably added in the late Middle Ages. The chancel portal is richly decorated, and the chancel also still has some remaining stained glass window panes in its windows. The altarpiece is an elaborate piece of art of German origin, dating from the first half of the 15th century. The chancel also contains a decorated built-in Gothic choir stall made of limestone, which still has traces of the original paint.\n|-\n| Buttle Church || }} ||  || The chancel and the nave date from the 12th century, while the tower was added during the 13th century. In the 14th century the chancel was somewhat altered. An extensive renovation was made in the 1880s, when the medieval windows were replaced with the current ones. The church contains 15th-century murals by the Passion Master and contains several medieval furnishings, including the 12th-century rood cross, the altarpiece from the 15th century and the baptismal font from the 13th century.\n|-\n| Bäl Church || }} ||  || Bäl Church dates from the early 14th century. A taller tower was originally projected but never constructed. The chancel is probably somewhat older than the nave, as the chancel portal is Romanesque in style while the nave portal is a decorated Early Gothic portal. Some medieval sculptures belong to the church, while the altarpiece is from 1669 and the pulpit from 1722.\n|-\n| Dalhem Church || }} ||  || The church is built in a transitional style between Romanesque and Gothic, and displays many features typical for the churches on Gotland such as three lancet windows in the east wall, the lack of an apse, and the Early Gothic portals receding inwards with nested columns and decorated capitals. Some of the details of the oldest parts are similar to elements in Visby Cathedral. It was heavily restored between 1899 and 1914.\n|-\n| Eke Church || }} ||  || The remains of an earlier stave church have been discovered under the floor of Eke Church. The current stone church has a nave and chancel built during the 13th century, and a tower from the 14th century. It is richly decorated with murals, dating from the 13th and 15th centuries respectively; the latter come from the workshop of the Passion Master. The baptismal font is a work by Sigraf. The church also contains a 16th-century Madonna.\n|-\n| Ekeby Church || }} ||  || The base of the tower of Ekeby Church is all that remains of an earlier Romanesque church, constructed at the end of the 12th century. The nave and chancel were built at the end of the 13th century, and the tower was probably raised to its current height at the same time. Both south portals are decorated with plant ornaments, one of them also containing traces of original colour. The interior is richly decorated with murals, from the 13th, 15th, 18th and 19th centuries. The rood cross is from the late 12th century, and probably belonged to the earlier Romanesque church. From the same period is also the decorated baptismal font, possibly a work by Majestatis. The altarpiece is from 1708, the pulpit from 1741 and the pews from the late 17th century but decorated during the 18th century. The church organ facade is from 1858.\n|-\n| Eksta Church || }} ||  || The church in Eksta was thoroughly altered in 1838, when it was rebuilt into a lighter and larger church building. The medieval tower is the oldest part of the church, built during the first half of the 13th century together with the walls of the nave, although these were raised in 1838. The chancel was erected in the 14th century and its former portal was moved to the nave during the reconstruction of the church in the 19th century. The interior retains little of its medieval appearance. Of the furnishings, the baptismal font and the altarpiece both date from the 17th century.\n|-\n| Endre Church || }} ||  || A Romanesque church with an apse existed here before the current church was built, and the base of the tower remains of this first stone church. Reconstruction began in the early 13th century; the decorated north portal dates from this time. New reconstruction works started again already in the middle of the same century, when a new chancel and a sacristy were constructed. The tower was raised in the middle of the 14th century, and the nave also dates from this time. The church contains murals from the 15th century by the Passion Master, discovered under lime wash and restored in 1915. The chancel contains an unusually large amount of medieval stained glass, compared to other churches on Gotland. These were supplemented with new windows in 1915–1916. The altarpiece is from the 14th century, and the rood cross from  1200. The baptismal font is from the late 12th century, in the style of Hegvald, complete with a lid from the 13th century. Other furnishings are from the 17th century (pulpit) and the 18th century (pews). The organ is from 1916.\n|-\n| Eskelhem Church || }} ||  || The foundations of a wooden church have been found under the floor of Eskelhem Church. The wooden church was later replaced by a Romanesque church with an apse, which in turn has been replaced by the current, Gothic church. The walls of the nave and a finely decorated portal, since incorporated in the tower, are the only remains of the Romanesque church. The tower was built in the middle of the 13th century, and the chancel is from the middle of the 14th century. The vaults of the nave contain murals from the second half of the 13th century, and fragments of 15th-century murals by the Passion Master. The tower also contains an unusual fragment of a painted calendar, with the feast days written in Latin and runes. The rood and baptismal font are medieval, the latter by Byzantios. The altarpiece is from the 18th century, and the pulpit from the 17th century.\n|-\n| Etelhem Church || }} ||  || The oldest part of the church in Etelhem is the tower, erected in the beginning of the 13th century. The nave and chancel are from the 14th century. The church contains medieval murals from several different periods, including murals by the Passion Master. The baptismal font was made by a Romanesque stone sculptor known as Hegvald and probably belonged to an earlier church on the same site. The rood cross is from the 14th century and the sandstone altarpiece was made in Burgsvik in 1690.\n|-\n| Fardhem Church || }} ||  || Fardhem Church is a well-preserved Romanesque church. The chancel and the apse are the oldest parts, built at the end of the 12th century. The nave was constructed  1200 and the tower during the second quarter of the 13th century. The sacristy is the only more recent addition, built in 1871–1872 to designs by Axel Haig. The chancel portal from the late 12th century contains some unusual reliefs, in style not comparable to any other known sculpture on Gotland. The furnishings of the church all date from the time after the Reformation.\n|-\n| Fide Church || }} ||  || With the exception of the roof lantern, Fide Church in its entirety dates from the 13th century. Inside, the church is decorated with murals from both the early and the late 15th century. The furnishings include a 15th-century altarpiece and a rood cross from the 13th century. The pulpit is one of the oldest on Gotland, from 1587.\n|-\n| Fleringe Church || }} ||  || The chancel and nave of Fleringe Church appear to have been built simultaneously, probably during the second quarter of the 13th century. The tower was added in the third quarter of the same century. The church was badly damaged by fire in 1676, and no medieval furnishings remain. The wooden altarpiece is from 1701, the pulpit from 1726. The baptismal font originally belonged to the chapel of Visborg Castle. Adjacent to the church, the cemetery wall, the medieval lych gate and the former church stables are all preserved, forming an unusually well-preserved ensemble displaying how the surroundings of many of the churches on Gotland may originally have looked.\n|-\n| Fole Church || }} ||  || The church tower of Fole Church is similar to that of Bro Church and is the oldest part of the church, built around 1200. Together with a portal that is today incorporated in the chancel, it is all that remains of an earlier Romanesque church. The rest of the church was rebuilt at the middle of the 13th century, and inaugurated in 1280. The chancel and the easternmost part of the nave are in a transitional style between Romanesque and Gothic, while the west end of the nave is in a purely Gothic style. Inside, the church has a rood cross from the middle of the 13th century and a decorated baptismal font from the first half of the same century; it was painted in 1707.\n|-\n| Follingbo Church || }} ||  || The nave and tower are from the early 13th century. They are some of the best examples of Romanesque architecture on Gotland. The chancel was probably replaced with the current chancel at the end of the 13th century. The chancel, Gothic in style, is also unusually skillfully constructed. The only more recent addition is the sacristy, from 1821. Inside, the flat wooden ceiling is richly decorated with paintings from the 17th century. Among the furnishings, the pulpit is from the early 17th century and originally belonged to the church of Visborg Castle, and was moved to the church when the castle was demolished. The altarpiece is from the 1740s, the pews are from the 17th century and the baptismal font is medieval.\n|-\n| Fröjel Church || }} ||  || Fröjel Church is located in a strategic location on the coast, and a ruined defensive tower adjacent to the church indicates that the site has been used for defensive purposes. The nave is the oldest part of the church, from the end of the 12th century. In the early 13th century, a tower was erected, the disproportionately large chancel was built  1300. A rood cross is also preserved from the same period. The foot of the baptismal font is a work by Byzantios, from the 12th century, while its basin is from the 14th century. The sandstone altarpiece was made in 1634 by Peter van Eghen. The church contains several murals from the early 14th century.\n|-\n| Fårö Church || }} ||  || Fårö Church dates from the Middle Ages but retains little of its medieval appearance. Its current appearance is largely the result of reconstruction works made in 1859. The church contains two paintings, from 1618 and 1767 respectively, made in memory of seal hunters who had become isolated on drifting ice sheets but were ultimately saved. Filmmaker Ingmar Bergman and his wife Ingrid von Rosen are buried in the cemetery of the church.\n|-\n| Gammelgarn Church || }} ||  || The oldest part of the now-visible church is the tower, the only remaining part of an earlier, Romanesque church. The nave, chancel and sacristy were built during the first half of the 14th century. Adjacent to the church there is also the ruins of a defensive tower from the 12th century. Architecturally, Gammelgarn Church is one of the richest churches on Gotland. Particularly the southern nave portal is profusely decorated in a style ascribed to the workshop known by the notname Egypticus. The interior contains fragments of 15th-century murals by the so-called Passion Master. The altarpiece is a work from the 14th century.\n|-\n| Ganthem Church || }} ||  || The chancel and the apse, in Romanesque style, date from the late 12th century and are the oldest parts of Ganthem Church. The rest of the church is also Romanesque, but constructed towards the middle of the 13th century. The interior of the church is characterised by the 15th-century murals which decorate the church walls. Several of the furnishings are medieval: the baptismal font is from the 12th century, the rood cross is from  1200, and the altarpiece is a copy of a 14th-century altarpiece today in the Swedish History Museum in Stockholm.\n|-\n| Garde Church || }} ||  || Garde Church is one of the oldest churches on Gotland. Together with its cemetery and its four lychgates, it constitutes one of the most well-preserved medieval church ensembles in Sweden. Construction of the church probably began  1130. The nave and tower are Romanesque, the considerably larger chancel was constructed by  during the first half of the 14th century. The church contains unusual murals depicting two male saints, Russo-Byzantine in style. Similarities have been pointed out between these and murals in the Russian churches of Nereditsa and St. George in Staraya Ladoga. The baptismal font is by Byzantios, from the late 12th century.\n|-\n| Gerum Church || }} ||  || The chancel and the apse are the oldest intact parts of the church, built at the end of the 12th century. The rest of the church is from the 13th century. The tower was never finished. The interior is decorated with murals from three different periods. The decorated baptismal font is from the 12th century, probably a work by the sculptor Majestatis. The church owns three medieval crosses, including the rood cross from the 12th century. The altarpiece and the pulpit are both from the 17th century. The church also contains one of the oldest still-working church bells on Gotland, made sometime before 1250.\n|-\n| Gothem Church || }} ||  || Gothem Church is one of the largest churches on Gotland. Its oldest part is the chancel and the apse, built at the beginning of the 13th century. The nave is slightly later, and the tower was erected in two stages between the late 13th century and the middle of the 14th century. The interior of the church contains several medieval murals which were discovered and restored in 1950. They were probably made by a German artist and date from  1300. The church also contains a medieval choir stall. The altarpiece was donated to the church in 1689 and the pulpit is from 1709.\n|-\n| Grötlingbo Church || }} ||  || A Romanesque church was built in Grötlingbo around 1200, and several elements of this church have been preserved in the currently -isible church, which is later. Notably a set of stone reliefs, possibly recounting some heroic myth, have been immured in the facade of the church. Stylistically, they have been connected with the sculptor known as Sigraf. The oldest part of the current church is the tower, which dates from the first half of the 13th century. The nave and chancel are from the 14th century, built by the workshop known as Egypticus. Characteristic sculptures adorn the south portal of the church. The nave is three bays wide, and its vaults supported by four pillars. Typically for Gotland churches, the north wall is devoid of windows. The chancel contains medieval murals and some stained glass window panes from the 14th century.

An arch in the west wall indicates where the opening towards the nave was intended to be. Most of the furnishings of the church are from the 17th century, including a votive ship from 1637. The baptismal font is from 1592.\n|-\n| Västerhejde Church || }} ||  || With the exception of the tower, which dates from 1856 and was designed by Fredrik Wilhelm Scholander, Västerhejde Church is a well-preserved Romanesque building from the early 13th century. The altarpiece of the church is attributed to  and made in 1662. A painting by Fredric Westin depicting the Resurrection and signed 1853 hangs in the chancel. The pulpit is from the 17th century and so is the baptismal font.\n|-\n| Väte Church || }} ||   || Foundations of an earlier, 12th-century church have been discovered under the nave. The chancel and the sacristy are the oldest parts of the extant building. They were built in the 14th century. The nave is a work by Egypticus and from the same century. Inside, the church is decorated with murals from the 14th and the 16th centuries. The baptismal font dates from the 12th century and is a work by Byzantios, while the rood cross is from the 13th century. The altarpiece is from 1699, and the pulpit from 1782.\n|-\n| Öja Church || }} ||   || The church in Öja is one of the largest on Gotland. The chancel from the 13th century is the oldest part. The nave is from the end of the same century. The tower is from the middle of the 14th century and probably built by the Egypticus workshop. The interior is richly decorated with murals, mostly from the 15th century. The altarpiece is made by Peter Cran in 1643. The rood cross is one of the most elaborate on Gotland, made in the late 13th century.\n|-\n| Östergarn Church || }} ||   || The whole church was built in the middle of the 13th century. A tower was planned but never built. The church has suffered from fire in 1565 and has twice been pillaged by Russian troops. Most of the furnishings are from the 18th century. There is a memorial in commemoration of the crew of the German cruiser SMS Albatross on the cemetery. Albatross ran aground outside Östergarn after the Battle of Åland Islands in 1915.\n|}\nSee also\n* List of churches and chapels on Gotland\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*"
