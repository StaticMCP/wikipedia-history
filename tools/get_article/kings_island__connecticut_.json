Since then the island has changed ownership numerous times, including several colonial leaders.  From 1787 to 1809 a sawmill was operated until it was washed away in a flood.  Following the flood, the island was owned by its namesake family, the Kings before being owned by the Terry family.  The Terry family operated a farm which acted as a meeting place for Millerites.\nLater the island was owned by a water-power syndicate which later became Eversource.\nRecreation\nThere is a  hiking trail on the island along with a campground operated by the Appalachian Mountain Club.\nReferences\nExternal links"
