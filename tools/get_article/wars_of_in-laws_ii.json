It stars Liza Wang, Myolie Wu & Bosco Wong.\nThe series is an indirect sequel to 2005's Wars of In-Laws (我的野蠻奶奶). The main cast features Liza Wang, Myolie Wu and Bosco Wong from the original series and new cast including Benz Hui, Joyce Tang, and Derek Kok. The indirect sequel takes place in the modern era instead of the ancient setting of its prequel.\nSynopsis\nMagazine editor-in-chief Gwo Bik/Ophelia (Liza Wang) will never save face for her superiors, nor will she come to the defense of her subordinates. She shows no mercy to her enemies and does everything she can to keep her son Gwo Dak/Kyle (Bosco Wong) under her thumb. She is an iron lady who can't afford to lose anything. As she is still full of confidence that she can determine her son's future life, even when a plain, geeky-looking girl named Chow Lai-Man (Myolie Wu) has already managed to become the wife of Kyle. Ophelia will do anything to not face embarrassment by changing her daughter in law looks.\nNot long after, Bik is dragged into a scandal and gets framed by her assistant Ko Ga-Bo/Coco (Joyce Tang), which causes her to lose her place all of a sudden. Facing a dramatic career slump and her deteriorating relationship with her son and daughter-in-law, Bik moves to the outlying islands on her own. There she meets a new man in her life, the knowledgeable and talented Pat Ping-Fan (Benz Hui) who was once a convict. From Fan, Bik has learnt how to reflect on herself and let go of the past. As everything seems to be going fine, Man discovers that there is a conspiracy going on and that the magazine she is working for is in danger of falling apart. She also discover that her family is going down too when an old friend/ex-girlfriend of Kyle, Athena, comes in and takes Kyle away from Man. Will Man be able to save the magazine company, Elva, and her family from falling apart?\nCast\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"65%\"\n! Cast !! Role !!

The names of \"戈碧\" and \"戈德\" also closely resemble the transliterations for \"Gobi\" and \"Goethe\" respectively. Those names would become identical in pronunciation to the terms they are referencing if pronounced with \"lazy sounds\" common in Hong Kong Cantonese.\nBenz Hui's character \"畢平凡\" (Jyutping: bat1 ping4 fann4) used the pen name of \"畢留名\" (Jyutping: bat1 lau1 ming4) in magazine articles. The identically-sounding name \"不留名\" (translation:  anonymous) is Bosco Wong's alter ego character in the original Wars of In-Laws series. 畢平凡\nis also a homophone to 不平凡, which means \"extraordinary\".\nViewership ratings\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!
