Wade decision.\nThe executive director of RNC/Life from 1990 to 2010 was Colleen Parro Baillargeon.\nPost-Dobbs\nAfter the ''Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Supreme Court decision overturning Roe'' in 2022, the focus of RNC/Life shifted to state legislative action.  They have polled state legislators on pro-life positions and have endorsed pro-life Republicans.\nEd Martin has been president of RNC/Life since 2013.\nSee also\n*Democrats for Life of America\n*Libertarians for Life\n*Republican Majority for Choice\n*United States anti-abortion movement\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://rnclife.org/ Official website]"
