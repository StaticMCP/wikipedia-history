Dunwich is part of the Redland City local government area, administered from the bayside town of Cleveland on the Queensland mainland.  In the , the locality of Dunwich had a population of 737 people.\nDunwich is one of three towns on North Stradbroke Island – the others being Amity Point and Point Lookout.\nHistory\nOriginally known as Goompi and then renamed Green Point by European settlers, the first settlement at Dunwich was established in 1827 as pilot station and military post. It was supposed to be a good place to discharge cargo from visiting ships that traveled through the South Passage. However cargo was lost in bad weather and local Aboriginals were hostile so the post was disbanded in 1831. Dunwich was named after the Suffolk village of Dunwich near to the Stradbroke Estate by Sir Ralph Darling on 16 July 1827, in honour of the family title (Viscount Dunwich) of the Earl of Stradbroke, father of Captain Henry John Rous RN, commander of HMS Rainbow, which carried Governor Darling to Moreton Bay and surveyed the immediate Dunwich area.\nDunwich Provisional School opened on 21 January 1889 as a school for aboriginal children. In 1890-1 it was moved to Bribie Island. In November 1892, it was moved to Peel Island. It was later moved to the new Myora Mission on North Stradbroke Island.\nIn 1892, a leper colony was established at Dunwich; later this facility was closed and the lepers moved to the Peel Island lazaret. A quarantine station opened in 1850, although this was eventually moved to the more isolated St Helena Island in Moreton Bay. The station was converted into a nursing home for the elderly and infirmed, one of Queensland's first such facilities. The home was moved to Sandgate in 1946. The main cemetery on the island (Dunwich Cemetery) is found in this small town and contains the graves of over 10,000 people, most of which are unmarked. Other small cemeteries were established for the indigenous community and the leper colony.\nDunwich Post Office opened on 22 October 1896 (a receiving office had been open from 1885).\nA second Dunwich Provisional School opened on 18 August 1904. On 1 May 1915, it became Dunwich State School. The school later expanded to include a secondary department which closed in 2012,due to low enrolment numbers (6 students).\nIn 1943, after the closure of the Myora Mission, some of the residents were moved to Dunwich; others went to One Mile in Ipswich.\nSome of the remaining buildings from the Dunwich Benevolent Asylum now form part of the North Stradbroke Island Historical Museum, located in Welsby Street, Dunwich. The Dunwich Convict Causeway also remains, although it has been expanded to accommodate modern ships.\nThe 'Aboriginal Gang' that worked the Dunwich Benevolent Asylum were the first Aboriginal people in Australia to receive equal wages. In 1944, after a 25-year campaign, the Aboriginal workers gained equal wages almost 20 years before anywhere else in Australia. The Asylum closed shortly after with the Aboriginal Gang only getting equal wages for one and a half years.\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Dunwich had a population of 883 people, 48.1% female and 51.9% male.
