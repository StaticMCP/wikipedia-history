While the government blamed separatists, the separatists claimed the attack was a false flag operation by the government to make Cameroonian Francophones more eager to fight on; the ADF has made a point of not attacking outside the borders of Southern Cameroons. In Ekondo-Titi, a battle between separatists and security forces left two separatists dead.\n*On December 24, clashes took place in Bamali, Buea, Muyuka, Bamenda, Bambalang and Babessi. In Ndu, gendarmes killed an intellectually disabled man.\n*On December 26, two suspected separatists were lynched by villagers in Bangourain.\n*On December 28, government forces launched an attack to destroy a wall between Bangulan and Bangourain, erected and controlled by separatists. In Bamenda, a soldier was decapitated by separatists as the warring parties clashed. In Binka, Nkambé, government soldiers killed at least six separatists and arrested one.\n*On December 31, the presidents of Cameroon and Ambazonia addressed the ongoing conflict in their end of year speeches. President Paul Biya of Cameroon promised to \"neutralize\" all separatists who refused to disarm, while emphasizing that anyone who drops their guns can be reintegrated into society. President Samuel Ikome Sako of Ambazonia said that the separatists would switch from a defensive to an offensive strategy in the war, and announced that a Mobile Wing Police would be created to capture territory and defeat government militias. He also condemned anyone engaged in kidnappings of civilians, and promised to fight back against anyone involved in such practices. The same night, separatist fighters attacked the convoy of the Governor of the Northwest Region, injuring at least one government soldier. The Cameroonian Army also announced the killing of Lekeaka Oliver, Field Marshall of the Red Dragons militia, in Lebialem; the killing was denied by the Interim Government of Ambazonia, and was also denied by sources within the Cameroonian Army. Oliver resurfaced in a video a week later, proving that reports of his death were false.\nReferences"
