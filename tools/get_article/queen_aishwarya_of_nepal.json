She played a significant role as the consort of King Birendra and was a prominent figure in the royal family throughout her lifetime.\nQueen Aishwarya is regarded by many Nepalese as an influential figure, known for her steadfast presence. During the pre-1990 era of absolute monarchy, she was often considered to be a central influence behind the throne. While her sense of style shaped the cultural ideal for many, her influence went beyond appearance. She was seen as a figure of composure and support alongside her husband during a period of both political change and royal tradition.\nIn addition to her public role, Queen Aishwarya was a patron of the arts and made contributions to the cultural landscape of Nepal. She was known for her literary works and involvement in music, composing and writing songs under the pen-name \"Chandani Shah\".\nEducation\nShe had her school education at St. Helen's Convent of Kurseong, India, and St Mary's of Jawalakhel, Nepal. She passed S.L.C. from Kanti Ishwari Rajya Laxmi High School in 1963. She was enrolled in the Tribhuvan University-affiliated school, Padmakanya College and graduated in arts in 1967.\nFamily life\nQueen Aishwarya was born into the aristocratic Rana family, which had ruled Nepal as hereditary Prime Ministers for 104 years until the 1950s. She was the eldest daughter of General Kendra Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana (1921–1982) and Shree Rajya Lakshmi Shah (1926–2005). She had two brothers, Suraj Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana and Uday Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana, and two sisters, Komal Rajya Lakshmi Devi Shah and Prekshya Rajya Lakshmi Devi Shah.\nIn 1970, Aishwarya married her second cousin, then-Crown Prince Birendra of Nepal, becoming Crown Princess. Both of her sisters also married into the Shah family and became princesses by marriage—Komal married Gyanendra, who later became King, while Prekshya married Dhirendra, the youngest brother of Birendra and Gyanendra.\nFollowing Aishwarya's death in 2001, her younger sister Komal became Nepal's queen consort, a position she held until the monarchy was abolished in 2008.\nQueen of Nepal\nAfter King Mahendra's death in 1972, Birendra ascended the throne, and Aishwarya became Queen consort. The couple formally assumed their roles that year, with their coronation taking place in 1975. During their reign, they traveled extensively and hosted numerous royal dignitaries from around the world.\nQueen Aishwarya was known for her intelligence, eloquence, and active involvement in social and cultural initiatives. She organized various cultural and charitable programs and played a significant role in supporting King Birendra throughout his reign.\n, Australia, 1988.]]\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, as Nepal faced growing political tension and movements from anti-monarchist groups, Queen Aishwarya was the subject of various rumours. Her strong presence and influence were sometimes perceived as dominance over King Birendra. Known for her outspoken and assertive nature, she was often contrasted with her more reserved husband. During the period of absolute monarchy, she was perceived as a key influence in the palace, with some believing she advocated for retaining absolute rule. However, in 1990, King Birendra ultimately agreed to transition Nepal to a constitutional monarchy, relinquishing his absolute powers.\nThe extent of Queen Aishwarya's influence remains debated, but over time, perceptions of her shifted. While she was once seen as a dominant figure, later accounts described her as a steadfast companion to King Birendra, whose popularity and stature grew throughout his reign.\nLiterary works\nShe was interested in literature and, under the pen-name Chadani Shah, wrote dozens of poems, which have been collected under the title Aphnai Akash Aphnai Paribesh. The anthology is prefaced with criticisms about Chadani Shah's writing by veteran critics of Nepalese literature. She was also a song writer, and her songs were frequently aired by Radio Nepal and Nepal Television.\nMurder\nQueen Aishwarya was shot dead along with her husband, King Birendra; her son, Prince Nirajan; her daughter, Princess Shruti; and seven other royal family members in the June 1, 2001 palace massacre. It is widely believed that the motive for the murder was the strong opposition to the Crown Prince's proposed marriage to Devyani Rana. Queen Aishwarya's face was so badly disfigured by the gunshot wound that, for the widely attended state funeral procession, it was covered by a porcelain mask bearing her likeness.\nHonours\nNational\n* Kingdom of Nepal:\n** Member with Collar of the Order of Mahendra\n**  Member Grand Cross of the Order of Honour\n**  Member Grand Cross of the Order of the Benevolent Ruler\n**  Member Grand Cross of the Order of Gorkha Dakshina Bahu\n**  King Birendra Investiture Medal (24 February 1975)\n**  Commemorative Silver Jubilee Medal of King Birendra (31 January 1997)\nForeign\n* Denmark: Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the Dannebrog\n* Egypt: Grand Cross of the Order of the Virtues, Special Class\n* Finland: Grand Cross of the Order of the White Rose\n* France: Grand Cross of the Order of National Merit\n* Germany: Grand Cross Special Class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany\n* Japan: Dame Grand Cordon of the Order of the Chrysanthemum\n* Lao Royal Family: Dame Grand Cross of Royal Order of the Million Elephants and the White Parasol\n* Pakistan: Grand Cross of the Order of Excellence\n* Socialist Republic of Romania: Grand Cross of the Order of 23 August\n* Spain:\n** Dame Grand Cross of the Order of Charles III\n** Dame Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic\n* Thailand: Dame Grand Cordon of the Order of Chula Chom Klao (1986)\n* Yugoslavia: Grand Cross Great Star of the Order of the Yugoslav Star\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1369064.stm \"Aishwarya: Nepal's forceful queen\" 5 June 2001, BBC news]"
