He was a right-handed batsman, who bowled both right-arm medium and right-arm off break.\nWard made his only appearance in first-class cricket when he was selected to play for Warwickshire against Leicestershire at Hinckley. In a drawn match, Ward batted once, scoring 5 runs in Warwickshire's only innings, but was dismissed bowled by Norman Armstrong. He wasn't required to bowl in Leicestershire's first-innings, during which Joseph Mayer and Derek Foster shared nine of the ten wickets to fall as Leicestershire were bowled out for 53 in 23.2 overs. Made to follow-on in their second-innings, Leicestershire reached 294/8 at the close of the match, with Ward taking his only first-class wicket when he dismissed Ewart Astill, finishing with figures of 1/29 from 8 overs.\nHe died at Bideford, Devon on 13 January 1981.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/22735.html Leslie Ward] at ESPNcricinfo\n*[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/33/33623/33623.html Leslie Ward] at CricketArchive\n`"
