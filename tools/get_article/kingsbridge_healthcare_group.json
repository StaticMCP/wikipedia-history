It was founded in 2004 by Suresh Tharma, an NHS consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist  and Ashok Songra, consultant maxillo-facial surgeon.\nThe Kingsbridge Healthcare Group owns Kingsbridge Private Hospital, Belfast, Kingsbridge Private Hospital, Sligo, the Cosmetech cosmetic surgery business and the l Private GP service at their Maypole Clinic in Holywood. In 2018, Bupa awarded the company a contract to manage a clinic which provides health screening, private GP services and muscle and joint assessment.\nIn November 2019 it opened a new £1 million six-bed ward at Kingsbridge Private Hospital and announced that it plans to increase patient capacity by 30% and take on 30 new staff. This expansion is driven by increasing waiting times for surgery in the Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland and is financed by a £5 million investment by the Foresight Group, which is represented on the board of directors.  In 2022 it opened the new ‘Liz Dallas Outpatients Centre’ at their Hospital Ballykelly  and a new Operating Theatre and Intensive Care Unit in Belfast.\nThe company's income dropped by 35% between 2014 and 2018 but improved after an improved focus on private patient income.\nSee also\n*Private healthcare in the United Kingdom\nReferences"
