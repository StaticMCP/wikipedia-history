They are associated with the Chimor or Chimú culture but were used in Andean culture leading up to the Inka and Spanish colonial period. Under Spanish rule, due to regulation of silver and gold, artisans made keros mostly out of wood. Wooden and ceramic vessels survived, most of the metal or gold 'vessels' \"represented the highest, most highly prized manifestations of Andean visual expression\".  were melted down to create gold bars by the Spanish conquistadors for the Monarchy of Spain.\nThe ceremonial keros importance in Andean social identities and creation of elites, is important to note due to the time and craftsmanship invested in making the metal keros. Some being created of only gold, arsenical bronze, silver or a mixture of all three.\nSee also Metallurgy in pre-Columbian America\nMany of the vessels are decontextualized due to their looted history, their isolated museum placement, or their removal from the surroundings into which they were originally placed.  The Gold Museum of Peru and Arms of the World contains over 7,000 gold artifacts belonging to Pre-Colombian cultures. The authenticity of the artifacts is disputed due to aforementioned looting history. Peru has long tried to repatriate pre-Columbian artifacts found throughout the world.\nPre-ceramic Andean textiles  can date back 8,000 BC and were used for basketry and containers. As they mastered textiles, designs became intricate, colorful and full of iconography that lasted throughout the millenniums.\nThese textile designs and iconography were not only then mirrored in the keros and art but some posit their architecture as well.\nGold aquillas\nSilver aquillas\nA deposit of silver aquillas from the Site of Purunllacta de Soloco, Amazonas, Peru.\nReferences"
