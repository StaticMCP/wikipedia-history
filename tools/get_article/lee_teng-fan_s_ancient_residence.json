The residence is part of Daxi Wood Art Ecomuseum.\nHistory\nThe residence building was built in 1859 after Teng-fan was recommended to Emperor Sien-feng by the local government. It was later on designed as a Grade 2 historic building by Taoyuan County Government. It was opened to the public in 2004.\nArchitecture\nThe Hakka-style residence consists of two main buildings and four side buildings, guarded by a large semi-circular pool and a whitewashed wall of mud brick. The living and reception rooms are located at the center area. The side buildings on both sides guard the open courtyard with two stone bases. The roof of the center main hall is taller than the other portions. The reception area is the major entrance to the building. The main gate is placed slightly behind its ordinary position. The side buildings are the living quarters. Rooms were assigned to family members according to their seniority.\nThe residence buildings are decorated with woodcarvings. All of them are of the patterns of flowers, birds and animals. There are also many pieces of calligraphy and paintings inside the building.\nSee also\n* List of tourist attractions in Taiwan\nReferences"
