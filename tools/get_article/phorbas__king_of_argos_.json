Φόρβαντος) or Phorbaceus was the sixth king of Argos.\nFamily\nPhorbas was given two different parentage and progeny by various sources. According to scholia on Euripides, his parents were Criasus and Melantho (Melantomice), brother of Ereuthalion and Cleoboea and father of Arestor and Triopas by Euboea. While Pausanias stated that Phorbas was the son of Argus, brother of Peirasus and possibly Tiryns and Epidaurus as they were sons of Argus. His mother in the latter case maybe Evadne, daughter of river god Strymon. In which case, both authors agree that he had a son Triopas who also became a king after him. Another son, Pellen (Pelles) was credited to be the founder of the city of Pellene in Achaea.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Comparative table of Phorbas' family\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Relation\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Names\n! colspan=\"2\" |Sources\n|-\n!Euripides\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Pausanias\n|-\n|Sch. on PW\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Parents\n|Criasus and Melantho\n|✓\n|\n|-\n|Argus\n|\n|✓\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Sibling\n|Ereuthalion\n|✓\n|\n|-\n|Cleoboea\n|✓\n|\n|-\n|Peirasus\n|\n|✓\n|-\n|Tiryns\n|\n|✓\n|-\n|Epidaurus\n|\n|✓\n|-\n|Wife\n|Euboea\n|✓\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Children\n|Arestor\n|✓\n|\n|-\n|Triopas\n|✓\n|✓\n|-\n|Pellen\n|\n|✓\n|}\nReign\nAccording to Tatiānus, he may have been a king of Argos himself, succeeding either Argus or Criasus. Eusebius included him in the list of kings of Argos, in which he reigned for thirty five years and was succeeded by Triopas. He was a contemporary of Actaeus, the first king of Attica who named the country after himself, Actaea. During Phorbas' reign, Cecrops Diphyes became the first king of the Athenians.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"11\" |PHORBAS' CHRONOLOGY OF REIGN ACCORDING TO VARIOUS SOURCES\n|-\n!Kings of Argos\n! colspan=\"2\" |Regnal Years\n!Castor\n! colspan=\"2\" |Regnal Years\n!Syncellus\n!Regnal Years\n!Tatian\n!Regnal Years\n!Pausanias\n|-\n|Precessor\n|1569.5\n|54 winters & summers\n|Criasus\n|1567\n|54 winters & summers\n|Criasus\n|1575\n|Criasus\n|1600\n|Argus\n|-\n|Phorbas\n|1542.5\n|35 winters & summers\n|Phorbas\n|1539.5\n|25 winters & summers\n|Phorbas\n|1550\n|Phorbas\n|1575\n|Phorbas\n|-\n|Successor\n|1525\n|46 winters & summers\n|Triopas\n|1527\n|36 winters & summers\n|Triopas\n|1525\n|Triopas\n|1550\n|Triopas\n|}\nNotes\nReferences\n* Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica translated by Robert Cooper Seaton (1853-1915), R.
