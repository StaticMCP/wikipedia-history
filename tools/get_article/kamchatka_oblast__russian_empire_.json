The oblast corresponds with the modern day Kamchatka Krai.\nHistory\nOriginally, the Kamchatka Oblast was part of the Irkutsk Governorate and was formed on August 23, 1803. The center of the Oblast was appointed Verkhne-Kamchatsk, on April 21, 1812, the administration of the region was transferred to Petropavlovsk harbor. In 1822 the Oblast was abolished. Instead, in the Irkutsk Governorate, the Kamchatka Maritime Administration was established with its center in Petropavlovsk.\nIn 1849, the Kamchatka Oblast was re-established from the Kamchatka Maritime Administration and the Gizhiginsky District of the Okhotsk Maritime Administration. However, already in 1856, the Kamchatka Oblast was abolished, and its territory became part of the Primorskaya Oblast.\nBy the law of June 30, 1909, the Kamchatka Oblast was created for the third time. The Oblast included Petropavlovsk, Okhotsk, Gizhiginsky, Anadyr Uyezds and the Commander Islands, separated from the Primorskaya Oblast. At the same time, in the territory of Chukotka (part of the Anadyr Uyezd) the Chukotka Uyezd was formed. In 1922, the Kamchatka Oblast was transformed into the Kamchatka Governorate.\nAdministrative divisions\nAdministrative divisions in 1909:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!№\n!Uezd\n!Center\n!Coat of arms\n!Area,\nversts²\n!Population (1911)\n|-\n|1\n|Petropavlovsky\n|Petropavlovsk\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n| style=\"text-align:right\" |339,697,1\n| style=\"text-align:right\" |10,200\n|-\n|2\n|Anadyrsky\n|Novo-Mariinsk\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n| style=\"text-align:right\" |458,476,6\n| style=\"text-align:right\" |12,700\n|-\n|3\n|Gizhiginsky\n|Gizhiginsk\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n| style=\"text-align:right\" |185,347,7\n| style=\"text-align:right\" |8,100\n|-\n|4\n|Komandorsky\n|—\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n| style=\"text-align:right\" |1,524,0\n| style=\"text-align:right\" |1,300\n|-\n|5\n|Okhotsk\n|Okhotsk\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n| style=\"text-align:right\" |158,365,4\n| style=\"text-align:right\" |5,000\n|-\n|6\n|Chukotsky\n|—\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n| style=\"text-align:right\" |—\n| style=\"text-align:right\" |—\n|}\nFormer cities\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!№\n!City\n!Population (1897)\n!Included in\n!Coat of arms\n|-\n|1\n|Aklansk\n|0 people (completely abandoned)\n|Gizhiginsky district\n|\n|-\n|2\n|Nizhnekamchatsk\n|107 people\n|Petropavlovsk district\n|\n|}\nCoat of arms description\n\"In the silver shield there are three knolls or black fire-breathing mountains (middle one in front of the other two) with a scarlet flame and smoke above them.
