Located within the Glencoe Mill Village Historic District, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, the museum is housed in the former management offices and company store built in 1880.\nGlencoe developed at the time when the shift from water to steam power was seriously considered by cotton mill builders in Alamance County. Glencoe's existent mill houses, original mill buildings, and 1880- 1894 water-powered machinery, make it one of the best preserved cotton mill villages in Alamance County. Although no early textile machinery remains, the village presents important evidence relating to the earliest forms and development of the textile industry in the county.\nExhibits include a Jacquard loom along with machines used to create and lace punch cards, knitting machines and the raw materials which describe textile production at the mill and others like it in the state. Volunteers also demonstrate a turn of the century hosiery knitting machine. Products available in the company store during its operation between 1880 and 1954 are also on display.\nThe museum is run by a non-profit corporation which also maintains archives of the Glencoe Mills including business records, fabric samples and artifacts chronicling what life was like in a mill town such resident's wedding gowns and a band uniform from the company band.\nSee also\n* Glencoe Mill Village Historic District\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.loc.gov/resource/hhh.nc0001.photos?st=gallery Glencoe Cotton Mills at the Library of Congress]\n*[http://www.glencoenc.com/library/index.htm Glencoe Research Documents]"
