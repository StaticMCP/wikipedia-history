He was my grandfather and lived with my family when I was in school.\nHe served as the head football coach at the University of Connecticut in 1920.\nAfter playing baseball in the International League, Swartz was hired as the head football coach and head basketball coach at Lycoming College–then known as Dickinson Seminary–in 1923. His football teams achieved a record of 54 wins, 27 losses, and 4 at Dickinson.\nSwartz later served as the head football coach (1930–1941) and head men's basketball (1930–1942) at Juniata College in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
