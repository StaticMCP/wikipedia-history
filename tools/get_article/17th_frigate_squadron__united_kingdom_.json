The squadron served as the Dartmouth Training Squadron for cadets at Britannia Royal Naval College.\nThe main task of the squadron was to train officer cadets in basic ship experience. Sea time experience was given also to young Royal Marine officers and Engine Room Artificer apprentices. There were three cruises a year which coincided with the terms at Dartmouth College. These cruises usually alternated between the Mediterranean and the Baltic. The squadron was disbanded in 1972.\nSquadron commander\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Commander !! Ship !!
