As The Swarbriggs, they represented Ireland at the 1975 Eurovision Song Contest with \"That's What Friends Are For\". As The Swarbriggs Plus Two, with Nicola Kerr and Alma Carroll, they competed again in  with \"It's Nice To Be In Love Again\". The brothers wrote both songs.\nThey also scored numerous other top 20 chart hit singles in Ireland during the 1970s, including \"Joanne\" (a No. 1 hit in 1976), \"Looking Through The Eyes Of A Beautiful Girl\", \"If Ma Could See Me Now\", \"Funny\" and many more. They had over 20 top 20 Chart Entries through the 1970s, which were all self composed.\nEarly years\nFrom 1962, Tommy played trumpet with Joe Dolan's showband, The Drifters (not to be confused with the American group).  In 1969 he and the other backing musicians left to form The Times Showband, with Jimmy added as lead vocalist.  The brothers wrote their own compositions, which was unusual for a showband, and they scored numerous hit singles in Ireland.  By 1973 they had their own television show on Raidió Teilifís Éireann and worked independently of the showband, leaving altogether in 1975, the first year they competed in the Eurovision.\nJimmy Swarbrigg claims that they would have won the Eurovision Song Contest in 1977 if not for political voting motivated by a dispute over fishing rights. They ended up placing third that year.\nMusical promotion and management\nThey retired as performers in 1980 and In later years they had various business ventures, including promoting concerts in Ireland for various Irish and foreign artists, including Smokie, Leo Sayer, Meat Loaf (three tours), The (American) Drifters, Jack L, Albert Hammond, Dermot Morgan, and Richie Kavanagh.\nLegacy\nThe brothers were attributed as the inspiration for the 'My Lovely Horse' music video in the channel 4 television series Father Ted.\nThe re-written song of The Swarbriggs \"If Ma Could See Me Now\" was heard from the 2002–2008 Mrs Brown's Boys direct-to-video film series in Ireland.\nReferences\n*[http://www.swarbrigg.com Swarbrigg Entertainment] official site as music promoters\n*From Ian Gallagher's showbands site:\n**[http://www.iangallagher.com/Swarbriggs.html Swarbriggs]\n**[http://www.iangallagher.com/Timesshowband.htm Times Showband]\n**[http://www.iangallagher.com/drifters.htm Drifters]\n*From Irish-showbands.com:\n**[http://www.irish-showbands.com/Bands/driftersf.htm The Drifters (1964-1980's)]\n**[http://www.irish-showbands.com/Bands/times.htm The Times (1968-1982)]"
