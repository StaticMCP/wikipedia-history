Juni 1814) is an oil on canvas history painting by the German-born Austrian artist Johann Peter Krafft, from 1828.\nHistory and description\nIt depicts the Austrian Emperor Francis I returning to his capital city Vienna  on 16 June 1814 at the victorious conclusion of the War of the Sixth Coalition. Austria and its allies had recently signed the Treaty of Paris following the abdication of Napoleon.\nFrancis is seen receiving a ceremonial welcome back to the capital from the Mayor of Vienna and other dignitaries. The city would host the diplomatic Congress of Vienna, interrupted by Napoleon's escape and defeat during the Hundred Days campaign. Today the painting is in the collection of the Belvedere Museum in Vienna.\nKrafft, a former pupil of Jacques-Louis David, produced a number of works commemorating Austrian participation in the Napoleonic Wars including The Departure of the Militiaman (1813) and The Battle of Aspern-Essling (1820).\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Crow, Thomas.
