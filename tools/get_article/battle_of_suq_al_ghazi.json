Not knowing what to do, the Iraqi soldiers made frantic calls for help. Inside the base, IS ordered the soldiers to get in a dozen trucks when they arrived. The IS fighters reportedly shot at civilians and anyone who tried to intervene before raising the IS Black Standard in place of the Iraqi Flag.\nAfter receiving calls from help, and seeing that IS intended to capture Suq al Ghazi, US, UK and French drones arrived and fired at IS positions, killing multiple fighters. The remaining IS fighters fled, only to be engaged by Iraqi tanks.\nIraqi tanks fired at the remaining fighters. US drones arrived and began bombing them as well.\nAftermath\nIS permanently left Suq al Ghazi on September 16, 2014, making the battle the shortest one in the history of the conflict.\nReferences"
