SADR claims sovereignty over the entire territory of Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony; however, at present the SADR government controls approximately 20–25% of the territory it claims. It calls the territories under its control the \"Liberated Territories\", whilst Morocco claims its territories as the \"Southern Provinces\".\nThe Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic has been recognized by 84 United Nations (UN) member states, UN members, of which  have subsequently withdrawn recognition.|group=\"note\"|name=\"ossetia group\"}} but, as of November 2024, only 47 member states recognize it due to numerous member states changing their recognition to \"frozen\" or \"withdrawn\". SADR has, at some point in time, been recognized by 38 out of the other 54 () African Union (AU) member states, 18 out of 57 () Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) member states, and 5 out of 22 () Arab League (AL) member states. Several states that do not recognize the Sahrawi Republic nonetheless recognize the Polisario Front as the legitimate representative of the population of the Western Sahara, but not as the government-in-exile of a sovereign state.\nThe SADR has been a member of the African Union (AU), formerly the Organization of African Unity (OAU), since 1984. At the time, Morocco withdrew from the OAU in protest, until 2017, when Morocco again joined the African Union. The SADR also participates as guest on meetings of the Non-Aligned Movement or the New Asian–African Strategic Partnership, over Moroccan objections.\nThe Arab League supports \"Moroccan territorial integrity\", without further specification, and withdrew maps \"harming Morocco's territorial integrity\". In 2020, the United States under Donald Trump was the first country to recognize Morocco's unilateral annexation of Western Sahara. While some countries reiterate support for the \"territorial integrity of Morocco\", a number of countries have expressed their support for a future status of Western Sahara as an autonomous part of Morocco.\nBesides Mexico, Algeria, Iran, Venezuela, Vietnam, Nigeria and South Africa, India was the largest middle power to have ever recognized SADR, having allowed the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic to open an embassy in New Delhi in 1985. However, India withdrew its recognition in 2000.\nBackground information\nThe conflict in the Western Sahara dates back to the early 1970s, when the indigenous Sahrawi Polisario Front sprang up an insurgency in Spanish Sahara, demanding an independent Sahrawi Republic. In 1957, the then-Spanish territory was claimed by Morocco, who declared independence a year before.\nOn 16 October 1975, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion that, while some Sahrawi tribes held allegiance to Morocco, found that there were not any ties of sovereignty, from Morocco or Mauritania, over the territory of Western Sahara. Moreover, the ICJ invoked the right of self-determination for Sahrawis through their free and genuine expression of such will. Morocco defied this advisory and staged a Green March across the Sahara.\nThe Polisario's insurgency and subsequent international pressure led Spain to withdraw from the region in 1975, Spain agreed to the partition of the territory between Morocco and Mauritania despite the ICJ Advisory Opinion.\nIn 1976, the Polisario Front declared a Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic in Bir Lahlou. In 1979, Mauritania gave up its claim to Western Sahara, which led to Morocco taking over the Mauritanian-controlled portion of the territory. Armed conflict continued to break out until a 1991 ceasefire.\nSeeking to change the status quo, the Polisario Front blocked the Western Saharan city of Guerguerat, a key trade route between Morocco and Mauritania in 2020. This led to a Moroccan military operation and subsequently led to the 2020 Western Saharan clashes and prompted the Polisario Front to quit observing the 1991 ceasefire.\nStates that have recognized the SADR\nUN member states and South Ossetia either currently recognize the SADR or have recognized it in the past. Of these,  have \"suspended\", \"frozen\" or \"withdrawn\" recognition. Several African countries and Caribbean or Pacific island-states have taken such actions subsequent to Moroccan lobbying and offers of economic and other exchanges, although the association of such decisions and these efforts is disputable. On the other hand, some states which had \"withdrawn\" or \"frozen\" recognition later resumed it (most recently Colombia and South Sudan).\nThe following lists all the states that have ever recognized the SADR.\n{|\n|+Overview of diplomatic recognition of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic\n| style=\"background:#f5f5f5; border:1px solid #aaa; width:2em;\" |\n| States that currently recognize (}} UN member states and South Ossetia)\n|-\n| style=\"background:#c8b7b7; border:1px solid #aaa; width:2em;\" |\n| States that have \"withdrawn\", \"frozen\" or \"suspended\" recognition \"The recognition of a state merely signifies that the state which recognizes it accepts the personality of the other with all the rights and duties determined by international law. Recognition is unconditional and irrevocable.\", as well as Article 7: \"The recognition of a state may be express or tacit. The latter results from any act which implies the intention of recognizing the new state.\" Therefore, once one state recognizes another as a fellow sovereign state (even if indirectly, or tacitly), this recognition cannot be revoked, except when one or the other state ceases to exist. One can only revoke the recognition of a government (for example by breaking off diplomatic relations), but not of the state itself. The provisions of the Montevideo Convention are generally considered to be a restatement of customary international law, codifying existing legal norms and its principles, and therefore do not apply merely to the parties to the Convention, but to all subjects of international law as a whole.\n|group=\"note\"|name=\"asotrecog group\"}} ( UN member states)\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n! !! width=20%|State !!
