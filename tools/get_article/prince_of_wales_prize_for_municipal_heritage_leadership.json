Created in 1999 by the Heritage Canada Foundation, the award is named for the then-Prince Charles, who agreed to lend his title as he has personal interests in architecture and inner-city renewal.\nThe municipality receives a metal plaque bearing the insignia of the Prince of Wales and the Heritage Canada Foundation, a flag with the same emblems to be flown outside or displayed within the city or town hall, and the prize's logo must be displayed on the municipality's website. In 2008, the first ever Prince of Wales Prize Honourable Mention was awarded.\nRecipients\n* 2000: Markham, Ontario\n* 2001: Victoria, British Columbia\n* 2002: Saint John, New Brunswick\n* 2003: Quebec City, Quebec\n* 2004: Perth, Ontario\n* 2005: Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island\n* 2006: Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia\n* 2007: St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador\n* 2008:\n**Winner: Aurora, Ontario\n**Honourable mention: Saint-Raymond, Quebec\n* 2009: Edmonton, Alberta\n* 2010:\n**Winner: Oakville, Ontario\n**Honourable mention: Calgary, Alberta\n* 2011: Peterborough, Ontario\n* 2012: City of Saguenay for the District of Arvida, Quebec\n* 2013: Owen Sound, Ontario\n* 2014: Bonavista, Newfoundland and Labrador\n* 2015: Grimsby, Ontario\n* 2016: Richmond, British Columbia\n* 2017: Thorold, Ontario\n* 2018: Westmount, Quebec\n* 2019: Maple Creek, Saskatchewan\n* 2020: Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario\nSee also\n* List of Canadian awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090506054435/http://www.heritagecanada.org/eng/services/awards.html#prince The Heritage Canada Foundation: The Prince of Wales Prize for Municipal Heritage Leadership]\n* [http://www.oakville.ca/nr-10oct05_2.htm#Town of Oakville receives Prince of Wales Prize]"
