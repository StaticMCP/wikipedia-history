For this reason a great number of localised stopping places have built up since the line was completed, many at the intersection of road crossings like this one.  The crossings/halts usually take the name of the nearest farm, landmark or road as is the case here, but these unofficial halts never appear in timetable materials or have nameboards fitted to show their names.\nQueens Pier\nThe stop here serves Queens Drive and other parts of Ramsey, and is the closest stop to the famous Queen's Pier, landmark of the town.  At this point the line becomes inter-urban, running parallel to the roadway, notably featuring traction poles mounted at the side of the line, rather than between the running lines as is standard elsewhere.\nRoute\nAlso\nManx Electric Railway Stations\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\nSources\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080916212555/http://www.mers.org.im/merstoppingplaces.htm Manx Manx Electric Railway Stopping Places] (2002) Manx Electric Railway Society\n* [http://www.island-images.co.uk/Rail/MER/zElectric.html Island Island Images: Manx Electric Railway Pages] (2003) Jon Wornham\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090707011008/http://www.gov.im/tourism/attractions/railways/electric_attract.xml%7COfficial Official Tourist Department Page] (2009) Isle Of Man Heritage Railways"
