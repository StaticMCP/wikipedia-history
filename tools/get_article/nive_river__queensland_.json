There the Nive flows to the south, its course followed by the Landsborough Highway, before crossing it near Nive Downs. The river flows to the west of Augathella and has its confluence with the Warrego River south of Augathella. From source to mouth, the Nive is joined by twelve minor tributaries and descends  over its  course.\nThe towns of Charleville, Wyandra and Cunnamulla are located on the banks of the Warrego River. Cunnamulla is the only town with a levee bank to protect it against flooding. The Warrego River reaches the Darling River about  east of Louth.\nHistory\nIn 1845 Major Sir Thomas Mitchell was the first European to explore the Warrego River and he named its tributary, the Nive River, after the Nive, a river in south western France. When the Mitchell district was opened for settlement, the Bell and Dutton families were among the first applicants for land on the Nive River and their leases included the site of Tambo.\nSee also\n}}\n*\nReferences"
