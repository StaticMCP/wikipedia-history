      "text": "# Kuuma Empire\n\nKuuma Empire is a fictional space crime organization in Zaido: Pulis Pangkalawakan and the revival of Fushigi World Fuuma of Uchuu Keiji Shaider.\nHistory\nThe Kuumas are the descendants of the clan of Fuuma Le-ar. 20 years after their retreat and the death of Le-ar, Ida revived their leader to conquer the universe once again. They follow a strategy in making a planet part of the Kuuma Empire: they kidnap the children of a planet to alert the adults, they then negotiate with the planets leaders. If they surrender, the planet will become a part of the Kuuma empire. If not the planet is destroyed, the planet Earth is the only planet not under control the Kuuma or destroyed. They have the Time Space Warp (Strange Dimension or Shigi Jikyu in original version) a realm with temperatures reaching up to 6000 degrees Celsius. It magnifies the power of their soldiers and monsters. Like the original Fuuma grunts called Miraclers, Kuuma grunts are also spies and have the ability to disguise as humans. Their known dance is the Shigi Shigi and their music is the revival version of Fushigi (sung by Koorogi '73) which can be heard in original series. Their mothership is different from the mothership of Fuuma.\nDownfall\nKuuma Le-ar plans to dominate the entire Planet Earth by resurrecting monsters to destroy there once again. He orders Sigma (Alexis) to seek chaos on Earth, but instead of this, he betrays him. Drigo saves his son Alexis, Alvaro and the Zaido Squad while destroys the machine which controls the Amasonas and later killed by both Ida and Le-ar. Le-ar's monsters, grunts and even his allies are defeated by Zaido Squad, Amasonas, humans and other allies. Le-ar kills Commander Zion before the Kuuma lord faces the three Zaidos. Le-ar, along with Ida, confronts Gallian (Blue), Cervano (Red) and Alexis (Green) in the final Time Space Warp battle. Both Zaido Red and Zaido Green defeat Ida. Zaido Blue beheads Le-ar. Both Ida, who becomes older again, and the beheaded Le-ar are trapped in the Time Space Warp forever and both are died and the entire mothership of Kuuma is exploded. The tomb of the body of Le-ar is now destroyed by the Zaido Squad as an order from Luna. The world is now at peace.\nMembers of Kuuma\nKuuma Le-ar\nThe revival version of Great Emperor Kubilai of the original series. Kuuma Le-ar is the evil leader of the Kuuma Empire bent on annihilating all beings in the galaxy. 20 years later after he was defeated by Shaider, he was revived by Ida by using a blood of Annie to destroy the entire galaxy once again. Le-ar is a giant head with a third eye on his forehead and permanently situated on the center Kuuma Palace wall. He \"bears\" the Kuuma monsters by spewing out a cocoon from its mouth. He seeks to retrieve his body which was found on Earth before Zaido Squad does. When Ramiro and group of Kuumas found the lost body of Le-ar, the lord of Kuuma merges his lost body into man-size form (unlike the original Kubilai that has large head attached to his small body) so that he would become more powerful than ever. He fuses with Ramiro when he refuses his condition in order to get Debbie back to her father. He resurrects his previous monsters, which the Zaido Squad defeated them, to bring forth the destruction and chaos on Planet Earth. He duels Zaido Blue, Zaido Green and Zaido Red in the final Time Space Warp battle. He is beheaded by Zaido Blue. He and his grandson Ida who becomes old are now trapped inside the Time Space Warp forever and both die. His body is now destroyed to make the Earth peace.\nKuuma Le-ar is voiced by Tirso Cruz III, who also played Ramiro.\nIda (II)\nIda is the grandson and adviser of Le-ar. He is also the high priest of the Kuuma and is hailed as one of the most beautiful beings in the universe.  Like his ancestor Priest Poe (or Babaylan Ida in the Philippine dubbed version), Ida maintains his flawless, androgynous appearance by imbibing a concoction made from the blood of 13 young women.  Ida is known for his trademark phrase \"Time Space Warp, ngayon din!\" (roughly translates to \"Strange Dimension, now!\"). Ida confronts Zaido Red and Zaido Green in the final Time Space Warp battle. He is defeated by Zaido Green and Zaido Red before they would help Zaido Blue to finish Le-ar. Ida, along with the beheaded Le-ar, is now trapped in the Time Space Warp as he gets older and both die.\nPaolo Ballesteros played the role of Ida.\nDrigo (II)\nAs Le-ar's field commander, Drigo leads the Kuuma in their campaign against Earth. Unlike his predecessor Hessler (Drigo I), he is rather incompetent and is often the subject of derogatory comments. In flashbacks, he revealed that he had a relationship with Sharina, Cervano's real mother but unbeknownst to him and to Commander Zion, it was actually Shanara (Helen) who was impregnated by Drigo when she pretended to be her twin sister to break up with him. Drigo turns out to be father of Alexis (not Cervano) and points out that his son is half-human, half-Kuuma. Drigo saves his son Alexis, Alvaro and Zaido Squad from Ida and Le-Ar's attack, destroys the mainframe to turn the Amasonas back into their lives and battles both of them until he is killed by Ida and Le-Ar in the final battle.\nDrigo is played by Jay Manalo.\nIda Dida\nIda Dida is the mini version of Ida who was given birth by Le-ar during Ida's birthday. Even if Ida speaks, she repeats what he says. Her fate is unknown.\nIda Dida is played by a child actress, Nicole Dulalia.\nGayke\nGayke is a Kuuma grunt who is usually sent by Ida to aid in their missions (as opposed to Fasullo with Drigo). He disguises as a female human being, but retains the mannerisms of a Kuuma soldier. He sometimes accompanies Ida when they go to Earth for a mission. Gayke wanted to keep his \"female human\" form but he was hesitant because of Ida. Ida agreed to let Gayke keep his girly form so that he can watch over the kids of Tala and help any Kuuma monster in carrying out the mission. This is to point out that all Kuumas are male (except for Ida Dida), and they had to \"recruit\" female human beings just so they can form a group of Amasonas (so that they get to have real female members). He was among the grunts who were killed in the final battle.\nGayke (Human) is portrayed by Chariz Solomon.\nFasullo/Inday\nFasullo is a Kuuma intelligence agent sent by Drigo to guard the Zaidos (especially Cervano). He disguises as Inday, an English-speaking maid working for Cervano's Family. When Fasullo first appeared and talked to Drigo, he had a male voice in Spanish-like language. He turns into an ally after he saved Cervano's adoptive family from the grunts' attack, retaining his \"Inday\" persona and now speaks in Tagalog but in Balagtasan phrase. Before the final battle, Fasullo joins the forces of good, the Zaido and the Galactic Force. Fasullo is the only Kuuma blood who didn't harm the humans (even Cervano and his adoptive family) and befriended them when he disguised as Inday. After the final battle, he retains his \"female\" persona as Inday and his \"Kuuma\" status wears off and also he has to leave Cervano's family. Inday lives with love interest Dodong.\nFasullo/Inday is portrayed by Patricia Ismael.\nAmasonas\nThe Amasonas (literally Amazons) are a revival of the Girl's Army in the original Shaider series.  The term was used to describe the Girl's Army in the Philippine dubbed version of Shaider. Unlike the original kunoichi who were unidentified, the new Amasonas are identified by color and are in reality, human beings taken from Planet Earth. All the amasonas have had a bad history with the men in their lives. During that time, the Kuuma Empire was also in dire need of reinforcements, as a lot of Drigo's men were killed in the battle with the three Zaido. Ida took advantage of this point when the girls were filled with hatred, sorrow and confusion, and brought them and other girls who were also troubled in a \"seminar\" for women called KUMA or KUmakalinga sa mga Magdalenang Api (lit: Those who care for oppressed women). The five were chosen because according to Ida, they had the most hatred inside of them, plus he didn't want the looks of all the other girls. Ida hypnotized and brought the five girls to the Kuuma headquarters where they were turned into Amazonas. The colors of their respective Amasona outfits are the same as the colors of the dress/clothes they were wearing during their transformation. Their powers are using gold magic dust to put victims into sleep. Later, they have remembered their loved ones and their lives and have to betray the Kuuma. However, Ida orders the Kuumas to reprogram the Amasonas to make them stronger than before. Later, they revert into their normal lives and join the forces, the Zaido, against Kuuma.\nAmasonang Lila\nAmasonang Lila (Purple Amazon) is the fastest of the Amasonas, her expertise lies on the use of her personal weapon: the kali. Debbie is Ramiro's daughter, and a colleague of Mona's at the newspaper before turning into an Amasona. Debbie has recently discovered that it was her father who ordered the execution of Alvaro, Alexis' older brother. Later, Debbie joins the side of good. After the defeat of Kuuma and death of her father Ramiro (Le-ar), she reunites with her friend Mona. In the end, she meets and falls in love with Alvaro.\nLJ Reyes played the role of Amasonang Lila/Debbie.\nAmasonang Itim\nSonia Tamano, or known as Amasonang Itim (Black Amazon), used to be a colleague of Carmela in a security agency. Seeing Gallian save her from a hostage-taker made her readily fall for him. However, after making advances on him, she was rejected by Gallian and was told off by Carmela. Adding the fact that she was cheated upon by her former boyfriend, she was pushed to the brink which made her join KUMA. Now, she is an expert in pistols and fights for the forces of Kuuma. Sonia joins the Zaido against the Kuuma. Sonia, along with Marla and Debbie, saves Rhea and Stacy from Shadow's attack and stops him also. After the final battle, she reunites with Carmela. In the end, Sonia takes care of Mona after her friend Carmela decides to leave with Gallian for good.\nIwa Moto played the role of Amasonang Itim/Sonia Tamano.\nAmasonang Rosas\nAmasonang Rosas (Pink Amazon), known as Marla, is a martial arts expert who used to be one of Doctor Eng's boarders. Before she became an Amasona, she was being harassed by her training officer at a fast food chain. When she rejected his advances, she was eliminated from the training and was replaced by another one who is more \"qualified\" when in reality she just refused to kiss the officer. Of all the Amasonas, she is the strongest. Her weapons are a pair of short, trident-like blades. Marla turns into human again and joins the forces of good. After the final battle, she reunites with Amy. In the end, Marla works with Doctor Eng in his medicine store.\nAmasonang Rosas/Marla is portrayed by Melissa Avelino.\nAmasonang Puti\nStacy, known later as Amasonang Puti (White Amazon), was once a scorned girlfriend of Cervano before joining the Amasonas. From her group, she is cursed with a conscience, and must struggle every time if she will do good or evil. Her weapon is a spiked ball attached to a chain which she uses to hit her enemies and/or make them immobilized by bounding them with the chain. Later, Stacy joins her former boyfriend's force, the Zaido. In the end, Stacy and Rhea tell Cervano that they've become close friends.\nAmasonang Puti/Stacy is played by Arci Muñoz.\nAmasonang Kahel\nAnother girlfriend of Cervano scorned, Amasonang Kahel (Orange Amazon), known as Rhea, becomes more aggressive after she becomes part of the Kuuma Empire. With her expertise in guns and her sharp eye for shooting, she will prove to be a formidable enemy. Rhea would become an ally to Zaido Squad before the final battle. She shoots Siba-tiba while saving Amy.

However, he was defeated by Amasonas in the final battle.\nShadow/Toby Mendoza is played by Gian Carlos.\nTime Space Warp\nThe Time Space Warp is an alternate universe with various traps and other dimensions. Some of the traps used in this realm are designed to match the monster's theme. Also seen are grunts and minions that assist the monster against each Zaido. The temperature in this dimension reaches about 6,000 degrees Celsius. The primary purpose of this dimension is to enhance Kuuma monster's powers and abilities for about 4 times, giving it the upper hand against each Zaido. When Kuuma Le-Ar calls for the Time Space Warp, Ida will summon it to draw the beast inside, thereby luring each Zaido to follow it into Fuuma territory. A constant threat each Zaido faces while inside this dimension is a Kuuma gunship; for this reason, he calls on Avilo, using either its giant blaster or robot form to destroy the gunship.\nDespite an upgrade in its fighting strength, a Kuuma monster can still be destroyed by each Zaido while inside the Time Space Warp. This, in turn, will dissolve the warp until the next time it is summoned again. Ida's phrase in Tagalog is \"Time Space Warp, ngayon din!\" (Strange Dimension, Now!)\nSee also\n* Zaido: Pulis Pangkalawakan\nReferences"
