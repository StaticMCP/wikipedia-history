The series premiered on Wednesday, 15 September 2021 on Network 10.\nThe show features craftspeople skilled in different media competing to be named the \"Master Maker\" and win A$100,000. Each week, competitors participate in two or three challenges – a \"Faster Craft\", a \"Together Craft\" and a \"Master Craft.\" The winner of each challenge earns a patch. For the Faster Craft, makers have three hours to create an item. For the Together Craft, they a split into teams and work together to create a themed item. For the Master Craft, makers have eight hours to create a more elaborate themed collection. At the end of every episode, one person is sent home based on their performance in the Master Craft.\nProduction\nIn October 2020, Network 10 announced that they had commissioned a local version of the show at their annual upfronts. In March 2021, it was announced that Susie Youssef and Harley Breen would be co-hosting the series and that it would be judged by production designer and art director Deborah Riley and paper engineer Benja Harney.\nDue to low viewership, the series was bumped from its primetime slot of Wednesday and Thursday nights and began airing on Saturday nights from its seventh episode. At the Network 10 upfronts in October 2021, it was announced that the series had been cancelled.\nCast\nHosts\n*Susie Youssef\n*Harley Breen\nJudges\n*Deborah Riley\n*Benja Harney\nContestants\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
