Their debut single \"Catch Me If You Can\", released in 2012, went to No. 1 on the Irish iTunes chart. The band released their debut EP, As We Fly South, in 2013, and a second one, Hand in Hand, in (2014), together with the accompanying single \"Always Be with You\". Their next single, \"Speeding Cars\", came out on 30 October 2015. Following the international success of the single, the band released their debut album Everything This Way on 29 January 2016, which peaked at No. 1 in Ireland. On 12 April 2019, the band released their second album Colours.\nThe band announced its split on 21 August 2020, on the same date that a final six-track EP called Clouds was released.\nHistory\nFormation and early years\nIn 2010, five school friends started performing at local venues and clubs in their hometown of Dingle, County Kerry. Committing wholly to their musical ambitions, the band went on to rent a house in the Dingle Peninsula and lock themselves away for the purpose of writing and recording demos. \"The place we rented was a really old cottage, where we had no television, no phone, no Internet, no transport,\" says Sorcha, \"We were there for 6 months – just our equipment and us. It was an amazing time, ideas were constantly flowing.\"\nIn 2012, Walking on Cars won the Redbull Bedroom Jam competition and gained extensive radio play with their debut single \"Catch Me If You Can\". As a result, the track reached no. 27 in the Irish Charts, where it remained for over 20 weeks. \"Catch Me If You Can\" also reached No.1 on iTunes, and garnered over 450,000 views on YouTube. \"Two Stones\", the band's second single, reached No.12 in the Irish charts, while YouTube views exceeded 1,000,000.\nWalking on Cars released their four-song EP, As We Fly South, in 2013. It was recorded in Attica Studios, Donegal, and produced by Tom McFall (R.E.M, Snow Patrol, Bloc Party, Editors). In July 2014, the band released \"Hand in Hand\" and \"Always Be With You\".\nChart success\nIn 2016, they released their first full-length album, Everything This Way, celebrating the release with CD signings and in-store performances around Ireland. The album went \"double platinum\" and reached number one on the album charts in Ireland, as well as charting in several other European countries.\nIn 2020, the band's single, \"Monster\", was used as the opening theme of the Netflix original series, The Stranger. The eight part miniseries, based on the novel by Harlan Coben, first aired on 30 January 2020.\nSplit and later projects\nIn August 2020, coinciding with the release of an EP titled Clouds, the band announced that they had split.\nIn 2021, the former lead-singer of the band, Pa Sheehy, undertook a number of solo projects. His debut single, \"Saw you at a funeral\", was released in June 2021 with a follow-up single \"Roisin\" released in August 2021.\nBand members\nFormer members\n* Pa Sheehy – lead vocals, piano, guitar  (2010–2020)\n* Sorcha Durham – piano, vocals (2010–2020)\n* Paul Flannery – bass, vocals (2010–2020)\n* Evan Hadnett – drums, percussion (2010–2020)\n* Dan Devane - guitar (2010–Feb 2018)\nTimeline\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom\nScaleMajor = increment:1 start:2010\nColors =\nid:vocals value:red    legend:Vocals\nid:piano value:orange legend:Piano\nid:guitar value:green  legend:Guitars\nid:bass   value:blue   legend:Bass\nid:drums  value:purple legend:Drums\nid:Lines  value:black  legend:Studio_Albums\nid:Lines2 value:gray(0.5) legend:EPs\nBarData =\nbar:Patrick   text:\"Patrick Sheehy\"\nbar:Sorcha   text:\"Sorcha Durham\"\nbar:Dan    text:\"Dan Devane\"\nbar:Paul   text:\"Paul Flannery\"\nbar:Evan text:\"Evan Hadnett\"\nPlotData=\nwidth:8 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4)\nbar:Patrick   from:01/01/2010 till:21/08/2020       color:vocals\nbar:Sorcha    from:01/01/2010 till:21/08/2020       color:piano\nbar:Dan    from:01/01/2010 till:28/02/2018       color:guitar\nbar:Paul from:01/01/2010 till:21/08/2020        color:bass\nbar:Evan  from:01/01/2010 till:21/08/2020 color:drums\nLineData =\nat:01/01/2014 color:lines2 layer:back\nat:29/01/2016 color:black layer:back\nat:12/04/2019 color:black layer:back\n}}\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center;\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Details\n! colspan=\"5\"| Peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=2| Certifications\n|-\n! style=\"width:4em;font-size:85%\"| IE\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| BE\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| DE\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| NL\n! style=\"width:4em;font-size:85%\"| UK\n|-\n| 2016\n| align=\"left\"| Everything This Way\n* Released: 29 January 2016\n* Label: Virgin EMI\n* Formats: CD, download\n| 1 || 157 || 23 || 76 || 26\n| IE: double platinum\n|-\n| 2019\n| align=\"left\"| Colours\n* Released: 12 April 2019\n* Label: Virgin EMI\n* Formats: CD, download\n| 2 || 200 || 7 || -- || 50\n|\n|}\nEPs\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
