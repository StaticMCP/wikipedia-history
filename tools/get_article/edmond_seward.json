Hall, to write movies and train Australian screenwriters for Cinesound Productions.\n\"We hired him at one hundred pounds a week as a writer and he laughed at it, but he said he would like a trip to the South Seas, and he came for one hundred pounds a week and brought his wife\", said Hall. \"He didn't know all that much as it turned out.\"\nSeward ended up writing two films for Cinesound, Thoroughbred (1936) and Orphan of the Wilderness (1936), as well as adapting Thoroughbred into a novel. He soon returned to Hollywood, with Hall claiming the writer \"had not been a bell-ringing success\". Hall thought Seward may have been responsible  for plagiarising the end of Thoroughbred from the Frank Capra film, Broadway Bill (1934).\nSeward later worked for Screen Gems and wrote a number of scripts for The Bowery Boys.\nSelected filmography\n*Walls of Gold (1933)\n*Fashions of 1934 (1934) (uncredited)\n*Thoroughbred (1936)\n*Orphan of the Wilderness (1936)\n*The Devil Is Driving (1937) – uncredited\n*The Duke Comes Back (1937)\n*''Gulliver's Travels (1939)\n*There's Something About a Soldier (1943) – short\n*The Disillusioned Bluebird (1944) – short\n*Mutt 'n' Bones (1944) – short\n*As the Fly Flies (1944) – short\n*In Fast Company (1946)\n*Bowery Bombshell (1946)\n*Spook Busters (1946)\n*Hard Boiled Mahoney (1946)\n*News Hounds (1947)\n*Bowery Buckaroos (1947)\n*Angels' Alley (1948)\n*Jinx Money (1948)\n*Smugglers' Cove (1948)\n*Trouble Makers (1948)\n*Fighting Fools (1949)\n*Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla'' (1952) – additional dialogue\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
