In 1940, the mosque was bombed by Italian aircraft and was  partially destroyed. Some of the exhibits were stolen. After the Second World War, the mosque was demolished by the Greek state. In 1965 the state built a small Archaeological Museum inside the Byzantine walls of ancient Nicopolis: . From 1998 to 2006 a new archaeological museum was built 5&nbsp;km North of Preveza.\nIn July 2009, the new Archaeological museum of Nicopolis was open to public. The Nicopolis Museum is open every day from 8 am to 8pm, including Saturday and Sunday (more information on the official website).\nExhibits\n*Marble tomb sculpture, with the name of the deceased, his father, his profession, his age.\n*Marble oblation altar, dedicated to Empress Sabine, wife of Emperor Hadrian.\n*Marble sarcophagus, with lions, flowers, etc.\n*Marble sitting lion of the 4th century BC\n*Marble statue of goddess Minerva - a Roman copy of 4th century BC\n*Marble statue of a muse called the \"small Heracliotis\"\n*Broken marble head of General Agrippa, reconstructed.\n*Marble head of Faustina, wife of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, who appears to suffer from strabismus.\n*Marble Cylindrical base of a statue, with a relief the  Battle of the Amazons (Amazonomachia).
