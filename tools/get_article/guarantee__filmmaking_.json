They also have the advantage of enabling a studio to remove a participant under such a contract, with few legal complications.\nAs Appleton writes, \"Memoirs of a Geisha is an example of a film on which the provision came into play... several actors were hired by the studio under pay-or-play deals. When the contracted start date came and went, those actors began receiving their full salary as if they were rendering services.\"\nReferences"
