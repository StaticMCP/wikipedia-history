Manufactured by Hyundai Motor Company, features of the Dynasty included electronically controlled suspension, dual climate control, and power memory seats (front and rear). To differentiate the Dynasty from its shared platform smaller Grandeur, Hyundai used a different badge (stylized D logo) for Dynasty.\nOverview\nThe Dynasty was produced in Ulsan, South Korea and it was discontinued in 2005. The Dynasty was the top level flagship at its introduction, but it was a front wheel drive vehicle.
