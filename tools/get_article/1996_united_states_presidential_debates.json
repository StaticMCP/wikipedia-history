Only Democratic nominee Bill Clinton and Republican nominee Bob Dole met the criteria for inclusion in the debates, and thus were the only two to appear in the debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The CPD-sponsored vice presidential debate took place between their respective vice presidential running mates, Al Gore and Jack Kemp.\nDebate schedule\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- †\n! colspan=\"17\" style=\"background:#B0C4DE\" | 1996 United States presidential election debates\n|-\n! style=\"white-space:nowrap;\" |&nbsp;|| Date & time || Host || Location|| Moderator || colspan=\"11\" scope=\"col\" | Participants\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\" |Key: Participant &nbsp;  Non-invitee &nbsp;\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em; background: #34AAE0;\" |\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em; background: #FF3333;\" |\n|-\n!PresidentBill Clintonof Arkansas\n!SenatorBob Doleof Kansas\n|-\n|- bgcolor=\"#F7E7CE\"\n!\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap; text-align:center;\" | Sunday, October 6, 19969:00 – 10:30&nbsp;p.m. EDT\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap; text-align:center;\" | The Bushnell Center for the Performing Arts\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap; text-align:center;\" | Hartford, Connecticut\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"white-space:nowrap; text-align:center;\" |Jim Lehrer of PBS\n|\n|\n|- bgcolor=\"#F7E7CE\"\n!\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | Wednesday, October 16, 19969:00 – 10:30&nbsp;p.m. EDT\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | University of San Diego\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | San Diego, California\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"16\" style=\"background:#B0C4DE\" | 1996 United States vice presidential debate\n|-\n! style=\"white-space:nowrap;\" |&nbsp;|| Date & time || Host|| Location || Moderator || colspan=\"10\" scope=\"col\" | Participants\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\" |Key: Participant &nbsp;   Non-invitee &nbsp;\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em; background: #34AAE0;\" |\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em; background: #FF3333;\" |\n|-\n!Vice PresidentAl Goreof Tennessee\n!

Paul Kirk, co-chairman of the Commission on Presidential Debates stated that \"Our decision was made on the basis that only President Clinton and Senator Dole have a realistic chance, as set forth in our criteria, to be elected the next president of the United States.\"\nOnly Dole and Clinton met the CPD selection criteria for any of the presidential debates. As a result, only their running mates Jack Kemp and Al Gore met the criteria for the vice presidential debate.\n1996 was originally to have three presidential debates, with the first scheduled for Wednesday, September 25 at Washington University in St. Louis. However, Clinton's campaign objected to the date, noting it was one day after he was set to address the United Nations, and argued that it left him without sufficient time to prepare.\nOctober 6: First presidential debate (The Bushnell Center for the Performing Arts)\n|venue=The Bushnell Center for the Performing Arts\n|location=Hartford, Connecticut\n|participants=Bill ClintonBob Dole\n|url=\n|moderator=Jim Lehrer of PBS\n|transcript=\n|fact_checking=\n|website=}}\nThe first presidential debate between President Bill Clinton and former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole took place on Sunday, October 6, 1996, in the Bushnell Center for the Performing Arts in Hartford, Connecticut\nThe debate was moderated by Jim Lehrer of PBS' The NewsHour, who posed the questions for each candidate.\nTranscript\n*[http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=october-6-1996-debate-transcript Debate transcript] from the Commission on Presidential Debates website.\nViewership\nAn estimated 46.1 million viewers tuned into the debates.\nOctober 9: Vice presidential debate (Mahaffey Theater)\n|venue=Mahaffey Theater\n|location=St. Petersburg, Florida\n|participants=Al GoreJack Kemp\n|url=\n|moderator=Jim Lehrer of PBS\n|transcript=\n|fact_checking=\n|website=}}\nThe only vice presidential debate between Vice President Al Gore and former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp took place on Wednesday, October 9, 1996, in the Mahaffey Theater in St. Petersburg, Florida.\nThe debate was moderated by Jim Lehrer of PBS' The NewsHour, who posed the questions for each candidate.\nTranscript\n*[http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=october-9-1996-debate-transcript Debate transcript] from the Commission on Presidential Debates website.\nViewership\nAn estimated 26.6 million viewers tuned into the debate.\nOctober 16: Second presidential debate (University of San Diego)\n|venue=University of San Diego\n|location=San Diego, California\n|participants=Bill ClintonBob Dole\n|url=\n|moderator=Jim Lehrer of PBS\n|transcript=\n|fact_checking=\n|website=}}\nThe second and final presidential debate between President Bill Clinton and former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole took place on Wednesday, October 16, 1996, at the Shiley Theater on the campus of University of San Diego in San Diego, California.\nThe town hall style debate was moderated by Jim Lehrer of PBS' The NewsHour with featuring the questions asked by members of the audience.\nTranscript\n*[http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=october-16-1996-debate-transcript Debate transcript] from the Commission on Presidential Debates website.\nViewership\nAn estimated 36.3 million viewers tuned into the debate.\nThird-party debates\n*October 7, 1996 - C-SPAN sponsored a third-party presidential debate moderated by Jennifer Laszlo.
