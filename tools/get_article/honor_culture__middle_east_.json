Such honor cultures are defined by the relative importance attributed to social prestige and image, as well as the evaluation made by other individuals. Virtuous behavior, personality integrity, and good moral characteristics factor in this system. Likewise, the values of collective pride, social commitment, and men and women's honor are also features of an honor culture. This is contrasted with other societies where honor is perceived as an individual value and a personal matter, shaped by differing perspectives and commitments.\nImpacts\nIn the Middle East, social rewards, as an aspect of honor culture, may diminish the competitive aspirations of individuals.\nIn regions where governments cede control to tribes, violence associated with honor culture may appear implicitly condoned.\nThe impact of honor insults are linked to defensive reactions and coping mechanisms related to shame.\nHonor culture in these societies also influences neighboring regions such as Turkey, and Sudan. Nevertheless, honor cultures may vary significantly from one another.\nTerminology\n* Sharaf and ird (Bedouin)\nSee also\n* Culture of honor (Southern United States)\nFurther reading\n*Abu-Lughod, L.
