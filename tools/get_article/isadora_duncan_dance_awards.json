The awards are presented annually and named in honor of Isadora Duncan. The awards began in 1986 and were revitalized in 2004 via a partnership with Bay Area National Dance Week after a slump due, in part, to a perceived lack of credibility.\nAward Winners and Honorees\nSource:\nOutstanding Achievement in Choreography\n* 2017-2018 Jyothi Lakkaraju, Ananda Narthana Ganapathim, Natyalaya School of Kuchipudi, SF Ethnic Dance Festival, War Memorial Opera House, San Francisco\n*2017-2018 Trey McIntyre, Your Flesh Shall Be a Great Poem, San Francisco Ballet, War Memorial Opera House, San Francisco\n*2016-2017 Lizz Roman, Sunset Dances: Architectural Meditations II, [https://www.lizzroman.com/ Lizz Roman & Dancers], home salon performances, San Francisco\nOutstanding Achievement in Performance – Individual\n* 2017-2018 Hien Huynh, Within These Walls, choreographed by Leonora Lee and dancers, Leonora Lee Dance, Angel Island Immigration Station, San Francisco\n*2016-2017 Isaiah Bindel, les vérités, dawsondancesf, YBCA Theater, San Francisco\nOutstanding Achievement in Performance – Ensemble\n* 2017-2018 Xochitl Sosa and Caroline Wright, Unravel, choreographed by Xochitl Sosa and Caroline Wright, San Francisco Aerial Arts Festival, Cowell Theater, Fort Mason, San Francisco\n*2016-2017 MaryStarr Hope and Karla Quintero, \"The Two Sisters\" from Grace and Delia Are Gone, [https://flyawayproductions.com/ Flyaway Productions], Firehouse at Fort Mason, San Francisco\n·Outstanding Achievement in Performance – Company\n* 2017-2018 OngDance Company, Salt Doll, choreographed by Kyoumgil Ong, War Memorial Opera House, San Francisco\n*2016-2017 Abhinaya Dance Company of San José, Vaanara Leela: Monkeys in the Ramayana, School of Arts & Culture at Mexican Heritage Plaza, San José\nOutstanding Achievement in Music/Sound/Text\n* 2017-2018 Sean Dorsey, Jesse Olsen Bay, Anomie Belle, L.
