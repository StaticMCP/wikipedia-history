It opened in 1986. The Lynn Museum and Historical Society (the tenant of the former Park Visitor Center building) now displays exhibits which highlight the city's industrial past, the tradition of shoemaking and its transition from a handicraft to mechanization, and the story of Elihu Thomson, an engineer and inventor instrumental in the founding of General Electric. The park offers guided tours and a self-guided walking tour and includes the nearby  Waterfront Park, located at Lynn Harbor.\n}}\nExternal links\n*[http://www.mass.gov/eea/agencies/dcr/massparks/region-north/lynn-heritage-state-park.html Lynn Heritage State Park] Department of Conservation and Recreation"
