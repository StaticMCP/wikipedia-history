It was a decisive Hungarian victory, which ended the War of the Croatian Succession and served as a turning point in Croatian history.\nLocation\nThe traditional Croatian historiography identified Gvozd Mountain, the location of the battle according to Gesta Hungarorum, as today's Petrova Gora. In the second half of the 20th century, an alternative interpretation emerged, by which the battle took place in the Kapela mountain pass of central Croatia. The changes in name of these two locations created confusion; the first was known as Slatska Gora until 1445, and only from 1536 as Petrova Gora, while the second until 1522 was known as Iron Mountain (Alpes ferreae), Gvozd (Gozdia) and Petrov Gvozd (Peturgoz) when due to the chapel of St. Nikola (previously St. Mikula), the population started to call it as Kapela.\n}}\nExternal links"
