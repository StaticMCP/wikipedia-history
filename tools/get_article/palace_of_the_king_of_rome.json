Grand and beautiful, it was to be the center of an administrative and military imperial city. The ambitious premise and the fall of the empire meant that the palace was never built. Its designer, architect Pierre Fontaine, stated that the palace could have been \"the most vast and most extraordinary work of our century.\"\nThe small palace of Rambouillet, originally intended for secondary use, was rebuilt by Auguste Famin. Due to the preparations for the French invasion of Russia and the diminishing resources of the French state, work on the larger Chaillot palace was halted. On March 2, 1812 the Rambouillet palace was officially given the title \"palace of the King of Rome\" and it was the only one of the two palaces that was finished.\nReferences"
