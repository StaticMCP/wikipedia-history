A former cop, he works as a private investigator with his father, Mal, and his father's wife, Rose. He is over-protective of his 16-year-old niece, Tinny. He is the second son and youngest child of Mal Doyle and his late wife Emily Ann. He drives a 1968 Pontiac GTO and wears a black leather jacket, both of which figure prominently and iconically throughout the series. After years of pursuit, in Season Four, he and Leslie Bennett become a couple. He also discovers in Season Five that he has a sixteen-year-old daughter, Sloan. Near the end of the series, Sloan reveals to Jake that it was all a scam and she forged the DNA test and isn't actually Jake's daughter. In the series finale, Leslie reveals to Jake that she is pregnant with twins and in the hospital after being shot by her supervisor, Inspector Vince Pickard, who attempted to kill her to hide his ties to corruption.\n*Leslie Bennett – Leslie is a Constable, later Sergeant and Inspector, in the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary who is friends/lovers with Jake and gives him information to help with his cases. Leslie is Jake's source of distraction from his cases and personal life. She and Jake have feelings for each other, but seem to show them the wrong way, making their relationship complicated. From season four onwards their relationship has been growing stronger, until a secret from her past resurfaces. At the end, she is the mother of two of Jake's children, with another baby of theirs on the way.\n*Malachy Doyle – Malachy, known as Mal or Skipper and Poppy, is a private investigator with his son, Jake in their business \"Doyle and Doyle.\" He is 56 and has three “grown” children: Christian, Kathleen and Jake. He also has a granddaughter named Tinny, who is living with him while her mother (Kathleen Doyle) is away working in Alberta. His wife Rose lives with him, his granddaughter, and his youngest son Jake. He pokes fun at Jake's somewhat 'unsuccessful' relationships with women. He has since discovered he has a second granddaughter.\n*Rose Doyle – Rose is Mal's wife, stepmother to Jake, Christian, and Kathleen, and step-grandmother to Tinny and Sloan. She works as the office manager/secretary for Doyle and Doyle. She seems to have a love/hate relationship with her husband's granddaughter Tinny and his son Jake, which has evolved over the series into motherly affection. Rose's criminal ex-husband, Martin Poole, keeps turning up.\n*Nikki Renholds – Nikki is Jake's ex-wife. Nikki was a physician at a St. John's hospital. Nikki helped out with different cases in the first few episodes. She has since remarried, moved away, and has a son.\n*Katrina 'Tinny' Doyle-Courtney – Tinny is the daughter of Kathleen Doyle. She lives with her grandfather, Mal or Poppy as she calls him, Uncle Jake and grandfather's wife, Rose. She is 16 and can't stand her grandfather and uncle's over-protective nature. She has a love/hate relationship with her grandfather's wife, Rose and one of the employees and main characters, Des Courtney. Tinny has since become a Constable with the Constabulary, and has begun dating Des. She is now Katrina 'Tinny' Doyle-Courtney after marrying Des.\n*Des Courtney – Des is the fashion-challenged and delinquent graffiti artist who tags the town and Jake's beloved Pontiac GTO until Jake brings him to heel – and into the employ of Doyle and Doyle Investigations. He is 19 and has a crush on Tinny, leading Jake to dislike him. His real name is Pierce Redmond, and he is the son of the infamous, yet equally as dopey, Jody Redmond. Not wanting to be associated with his father, Des conceals his identity. He has grown from a delinquent to a valued member of Doyle & Doyle, specializing in the technological side of investigations. After a failed relationship with a medical student and surviving getting shot, he has begun dating Tinny. He is now married to Tinny Doyle-Courtney.\n*Walter McLean – Walter has been Jake's best friend since kindergarten and his wing-man that used to be right behind Jake in a fight. Walter was Jake's lawyer in his divorce from his wife Nikki. Walter appears only sporadically. In season three he becomes romantically involved with Tinny's mother Kathleen. The status of their relationship is unknown, but presumed to be over.\n*Allison Jenkins (season 2, guest starring in season 4) – Allison is the crown attorney and has all the things that turn Jake's head. What was once strictly professional turned into a romantic relationship, which ended  when she realized Jake's feelings for Leslie were stronger than his feelings for her. She appeared briefly in season four.\n*Sloan Daniels (seasons 5–6) - Initially believed to be Jake's sixteen-year-old daughter that he had with high school flame Ellen Daniels,  Sloan spent her time in group homes before meeting the Doyles. In \"Whistleblower\" her half-sister arrives and reveals to the Doyles that she is not Jake's daughter after all and was simply conning them. She is responsible for bankrupting the Doyles, and eventually attempts to turn herself in to the police to make things right before Jake stops her. She leaves to go to Gander to live with her aunt.\n*Kevin Crocker (guest starring in seasons 2, 4 and 5) - Jake's former partner on the force, and Tinny's biological father.
