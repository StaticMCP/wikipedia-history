The accolade is presented at the Brit Awards, an annual celebration of British and international music. Alongside the other genre categories, the winner of the award is selected by the British public. It was presented for the first time at the 2024 Brit Awards.\nThe inaugural recipient of the award is Raye. Cleo Sol holds the record for most nominations in the category, with three. Raye and Jorja Smith are the only other artists with multiple nominations, with two each respectively.\nHistory\nFollowing the removal of the gendered categories in 2021, it was announced that four new genre categories would be introduced that were voted for by the public. One of these cateogies, Best British Pop/R&B Act, was first presented at the 42nd Brit Awards alongside Rock/Alternative Act, Dance Act and Hip Hop/Grime/Rap Act).\nIn 2023, it was announced that the Pop/R&B category would be split into British Pop Act and British R&B Act and would be presented for the first time at the 2024 Brit Awards. The change followed criticism that the existing category did not fairly represent the genre and that R&B artists were less likely to be nominated against pop artists.\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
