On 8 July 1817, at age 20, he joined the 63rd Regiment of Foot. On  27 November 1819 he married Jane Catherine Pearson (11 Nov 1800 – 23 Feb 1878) in Cumberland, England.\nSwan River Colony\nBarron travelled to the Swan River Colony as colour sergeant of the 63rd Regiment on board  arriving 8 June 1829. When the regiment left Western Australia in March 1834, Barron was one of eleven men allowed to stay in the colony with their wives and children.\nJane Barron is believed to have been the first European woman to step onto the shores of the colony.\nWheat Sheaf Tavern\nBarron opened the Wheat Sheaf Tavern at 1 Murray Street, Perth, on the north-west corner of the intersection of Murray and Barrack Street. Barron later sold this and opened the United Services Tavern in St Georges Terrace and later the Criterion Hotel on Howick Street (now Hay Street) which still trades as Perth's oldest public house.\nAs Barron was still in the Army, his wife Jane ran the business due to complaints from settlers regarding soldiers running businesses.\nBarron ran many businesses including a dairy and built and let several houses. He also had the government contract for mail delivery between Perth and Guildford and had the contract for government stores and delivery of firewood to government offices.\nMurray district\nOn 15 July 1834 Barron travelled to Mandurah for the purpose of buying a horse from Thomas Peel. Peel told Barron the mare was lost in the bush and to wait for local Aboriginals to attend for their flour ration whereby they could be asked to show where the mare was.\nThe Aboriginals who attended the house indicated they did know where the mare was, and Barron and Hugh Nesbitt, of the 21st Regiment of Foot, and the group, including local Aboriginal leader Calyute, set off.\nDuring the ride Barron and Nesbitt were ambushed, with three spears hitting Barron as he rode away and Nesbitt being killed. Barron was badly wounded and conveyed back to Perth. This incident was a catalyst for the Pinjarra Massacre.\nLater life\nBarron and his wife Jane had 12 children, 9 of them born in the colony. Their son Edward George Barron (17 September 1829 – 4 March 1901) was reputed to be the first white child born in the colony. Three sons joined the Western Australia Police: Edward, John, and Charles.\nBarron died 23 February 1863 in Perth and is interred at East Perth Cemeteries.\nReferences"
