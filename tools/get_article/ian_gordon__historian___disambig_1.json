He writes on comic strips and comic books and film and television.\nBackground\nGordon earned a PhD in history at the University of Rochester. In 2015-16 he offered a  Superhero Entertainments MOOC through the Coursera platform.\nComic Strips and Consumer Culture\nGordon uses comic strips to make an argument about American culture. He says that comic strips were one of the first forms of truly national culture, by which he means people all over the country read them on the same day, and so had shared experiences, and that this happened on a widespread basis as early as 1908. He also ties comic strips to transformations in advertising styles, and not just the comic strip advertising style of the 1930s but the generalized use of more images in advertising as the twentieth century progressed. The book even has a chapter on the beginnings of comic books, which is a useful short overview and has good information on the early Superman. On 11 April 2011 he created an online version of the book which can be found at academia.edu.\nThe Journal of American History said: \"Gordon has done historians a service by recognizing the importance of popular visual sources as important clues to understanding American culture. And the book is not only informative but fun to read.\"\nAmerican Journalism said: \"a must read for any scholar interested in the question of popular culture.\"\nSuperman: The Persistence of an American Icon\nThis book addresses Superman's place in American culture and discusses the way the character was shaped through interactions between writers, artists, editors, publishers, and readers. Gordon looks at Superman in his many media versions and also licensed items.\nWriting in Choice John Lent said \"the research for Superman: The Persistence of an American Icon is extraordinarily rich, the analysis is meticulously conceived and implemented, and the writing is clear and interesting, spiced with anecdotes, asides, and quotes.\"\nThe Comics of Charles Schulz: The Good Grief of Modern Life\nOn April 26, 2018 this book was nominated for an Eisner Award for best scholarly work on comics.\nSelected works\n* Comic Strips and Consumer Culture, 1890-1945.
