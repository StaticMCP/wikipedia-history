It had two different B-sides. The US B-side was \"She Won't Dance With Me\", which is from his 1980 album Foolish Behaviour while the UK B-side, \"Three Time Loser\", is from his 1975 album Atlantic Crossing.\nMusic video\nThe song's video, directed by Jonathan Kaplan, is a story filmed mostly in black in white. According to VH1's Pop-Up Video, the clip was inspired by the Hitchcock mystery movie Rear Window. In the video, a woman (played by Kay Lenz) moves into an apartment complex where Stewart lives.  Shortly after she settles in, Stewart is accosted by the woman's bodyguard (played by Mike Mazurki) asking about her, showing him a picture of her with two mobsters, one of the faces covered by the bodyguard's thumb; Stewart denies knowing the woman, though his apartment walls are covered with numerous pictures he took of the woman in various stages of dress (and undress), mainly at the complex's pool; he is constantly snapping additional pictures or peering into the woman's apartment with his binoculars.\nEventually Stewart's obsession with the woman gets him in trouble; he is caught with his binoculars by the woman's bodyguard, who punches him in the face.  After Stewart falls back on his pillow the film changes from black and white to colour, suggesting a dream sequence.  The last scene takes a surreal turn, showing Stewart standing at a moving carousel with Lenz trapped in the center while one of the two mobsters (Dick Miller), riding a mount, taunts Stewart.\nThe video has two different endings. One ending shows the woman waving goodbye to Stewart as she and the other mobster (the one whose face was covered by the bodyguard's thumb in the picture) drive away in a blue convertible, leaving Stewart riding the carousel alone.  The other has the mobster driving away alone as Stewart and Lenz ride the carousel together in each other's arms.\nMazurki later said that he got more fame in the making of this video, than in any of the feature films or TV shows in which he had starred.\nCharts\nThe song reached No. 6 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart.  On the US dance charts, \"Infatuation\" was the last of five entries to make the chart, peaking at No. 19.\nChart history\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1984)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|Paraguay (UPI)\n|align=\"center\"|8\n|-\n|Peru (UPI)\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|UK Singles (OCC)\n|align=\"center\"|27\n|-\n|U.S. Billboard Hot 100\n|align=\"center\"|6\n|-\n|U.S. Billboard Hot Dance/Disco\n|align=\"center\"|19\n|-\n|\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
