Their father taught both Grace and her elder sister, Margaret Seguier, to paint. After moving to London, where she lived in Clapham for a long period, Grace Stewart built a reputation as a fine miniature painter. Between 1843 and 1856 she exhibited 14 works at the Royal Academy in London. These were mostly portrait miniatures of members of the Scottish nobility including the children of John Scott, 2nd Earl of Eldon and his wife Louisa.\nReferences"
