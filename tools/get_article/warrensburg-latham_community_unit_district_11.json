Warrensburg and Latham is a cross-county school.\nWarrensburg School and Latham School were separated schools. Latham's (defunct) mascot was the Rabbits. Warrensburg's elementary and middle school was formerly known as the Warrensburg Rebels and continued to be the Rebels after the merger of Warrensburg and Latham until 1995, due to racial issues with the confederate flag, the mascot was changed to the Cardinals after a vote of the student body. The Warrensburg High school (defunct) has always been the Cardinals, before and after the merger.\nBoth the Elementary/Middle School and the high school are located on the same plot of land on the northwest edge of Warrensburg. Their mascot is the Cardinal.\nFamous alumni include Stephen Mason (guitarist with Jars of Clay), Hall of Fame jockey John L. Rotz (rider of the winners of two Triple Crown races, the 1962 Preakness Stakes on the horse Greek Money, and 1970 Belmont Stakes on the colt, High Echelon).\nWarrensburg and Latham are both situated on Illinois Route 121 northwest of Decatur.\nExternal links\n* [http://www.wl.k12.il.us/ Warrensburg Latham High School Website]\n* [http://www.ihsa.org/school/schools/2303.htm IHSA School Profile]\n* [http://www.illinoishsglorydays.com/id483.html (defunct)Latham High School History]\n* [http://www.illinoishsglorydays.com/id484.html (defunct)Warrensburg High School History]"
