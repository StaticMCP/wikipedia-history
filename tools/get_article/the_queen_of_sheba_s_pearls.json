      "text": "# The Queen of Sheba's Pearls\n\n'The Queen of Sheba's Pearls' is a 2004 Swedish-British drama film set in England post-WWII.\nPlot introduction\nHelena Bergström plays Nancy Ackerman who mysteriously arrives on the Pretty family's doorstep. Ackerman looks eerily similar to Jack Bradley's (James Hawkins) mother who inexplicably died in an WWII-related accident eight years prior. As the film progresses, it becomes clear that Ackerman is the identical twin separated from Jack's mother at birth. Meanwhile Jack's father, a former marine, has clouded feelings for Ackerman; he cannot decide if his feelings for her are growing on their own merits or are based on those towards his deceased wife. Ackerman also proves to be an unsettling force in Jack's life by offering advice that turns out to be eerily omniscient and fairy godmother-like.\nProduction\nThe movie was produced, directed and written by Colin Nutley who is married to the film's lead, Helena Bergström.\"The Queen of Shebas Pearls.\" Colin Nutley.

Variety'' magazine called the film \"unquestionably [Nutley's] most substantial movie to date.\" Sandra Hall, an Australian critic, provided a more mixed review of the film, saying that Nutley is \"not great on plot mechanics and narrative dovetailing. He's into vignettes rather than the big picture. Yet in its anecdotal way, the film somehow hangs together, shaping itself into a benign and sunny take on a plot device we've often seen before in films - about a fraying household rejuvenated by the presence of a seductive stranger.\" However, while critics, film analysts, and awards committees agreed that the film has superb casting and behind the scenes elements, it is not especially popular or well-known with the general public, as evidenced by the lack of comments and support on a number of public review sites including Flixster\"The Queen of Sheba's Pearls - Movie Reviews, Photos & Videos, Layouts & Wallpapers, Fan Club.\" Flixster - Share Movie Reviews and Movie Ratings With Your Friends.
