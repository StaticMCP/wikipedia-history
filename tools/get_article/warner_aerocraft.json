In the past the company specialized in the design and manufacture of light aircraft in the form of plans and kits for amateur construction, but in recent years has concentrated on a ready-to-fly light-sport aircraft design.\nThe company's motto is \"Puts the Sport in Sport Pilot\".\nThe company started producing plans for the single-seat Warner Revolution I, also called the Spacewalker I. This design was developed into the tandem two-seat Warner Revolution II, also called the Spacewalker II. Both the  Revolution I and II are now out of production.\nThe most recent development of the basic design is the Warner Sportster light-sport aircraft, first flown in 1999 which, in 2014, is offered as a complete-ready to-fly aircraft with Federal Aviation Administration light-sport approval in progress. The company indicates that kits are not currently available.\nAircraft\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=center style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n|+ align=center style=\"background:#BFD7FF\"| Summary of aircraft built by Warner Aerocraft\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!
