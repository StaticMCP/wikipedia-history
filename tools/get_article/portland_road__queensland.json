The town is within the locality of Iron Range.\nHistory\nThe town takes its name from the Portland Road harbour (). The harbour, in turn, is named after William Henry Cavendish, Duke of Portland. The name first appears on an 1897 chart published by the British Admiralty. The use of the word \"road\" in a nautical context refers to a roadstead, a body of water where it is safe to anchor.\nPortland Road was previously the port and support centre for Iron Range. In World War II, Portland Road became an airstrip and staging post.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Portland Road. The nearest government school is Lockhart State School (Early Childhood to Year 12) in Lockhart River to the south-west.\nReferences"
