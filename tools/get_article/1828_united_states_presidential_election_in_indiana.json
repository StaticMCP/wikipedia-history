The Democratic ticket of the former U.S. senator from Tennessee Andrew Jackson and the incumbent vice president John C. Calhoun defeated National Republican ticket of the incumbent president John Quincy Adams and the U.S. secretary of the treasury Richard Rush. Jackson defeated Adams in the national election with 178 electoral votes.\nGeneral election\nSummary\nIndiana chose five electors on a statewide general ticket. Nineteenth-century election laws required voters to vote directly for members of the Electoral College rather than for president. This sometimes resulted in small differences in the number of votes cast for electors pledged to the same presidential candidate, if some voters did not vote for all the electors nominated by a party. This table compares the votes for the most popular elector pledged to each ticket, to give an approximate sense of the statewide result.\n}}\n9.66}}\n}}\n23.90}}\n}}\nResults\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ 1828 United States presidential election in Indiana\n!colspan=2 style=\"width: 130px\"| Party\n!style=\"width: 17em\"| Candidate\n!style=\"width: 5em\"| Votes\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:; width:5px;\"|\n| Democratic\n| Benjamin V.
