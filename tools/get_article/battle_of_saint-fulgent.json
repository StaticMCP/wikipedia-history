The 11,000 Vendean rebels, led by Henri de La Rochejaquelein, defeated a 6,000-man republican division, commanded by Jean Quirin de Mieszkowski and belonging to the Army of the Coasts of La Rochelle. Half of the Republican force was killed, wounded or captured, but rebel losses were only one tenth as many.\nIn mid-September, the Republican Army of the Coasts of La Rochelle, led by Jean Antoine Rossignol, advanced into the Vendée from the south and the east while the Army of the Coasts of Brest and the Army of Mainz, under Jean Baptiste Camille Canclaux, advanced from the west. In a series of battles at Coron, Pont-Barré, Tiffauges, Montaigu and Saint-Fulgent, the royalist rebels concentrated against and defeated each republican column in turn.\nReferences\n*\n*"
