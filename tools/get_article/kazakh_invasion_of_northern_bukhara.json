Khan, who was an ally of the Bukharans for much of the 1580s and 1590s. News of Abdullah Khan II's death early in 1598, followed by the death of Abd al-Mu'min in June of that year, inspired by Tawakkul to assert himself.\nShortly before the death of Abdullah Khan II, Tawakkul Khan defeated the Uzbek army sent by Abdullah Khan II and captured the cities of Aksi and Andijan.\nIn the winter of 1598-1599, Tawakkul with the army of the Kazakh Khanate, which consisted of Kazakhs, Karakalpaks and Kyrgyz, moved south from Dasht-i Kipchak, in the direction of Transoxiana. First of all, he captured Tashkent and other settlements along it. The Syr Darya River and all the others fell without resistance. Then he moved forward. south towards Samarkand. Having learned about the approach of Tawakkul, the population of the city offered no resistance. They surrendered Samarkand to the Kazakhs and gave them their prince as a hostage.\nTawakkul remained briefly in Samarkand before heading west towards Dabusia and Bukhara. Khan left his brother Esim Sultan in Samarkand with a garrison of twenty thousand people to govern Samarkand and surrounding region.\nTawakkul Khan himself moved to besiege Bukhara with his army of 70-80,000 people. However, joined Pir-Muhammad Khan and Baki-sultan actively participated in the battles against Tauekel Khan and often won victories. For about a month, both sides fought continuously. Baki-sultan demonstrated courage and loyalty to Pir-Muhammad Khan until Tauekel Khan, weakened by the battles, launched a sudden night attack on Pir-Muhammad Khan's camp  . However, the army of Pir Muhammad Khan also gave a decisive rebuff, and a fierce battle broke out. In this battle, Tauekel managed to kill Sayyid Muhammad Sultan, a relative of Pir Muhammad Khan, and Muhammad Baki-atalyk-divanbegi, but he himself was wounded and did not achieve success. Having retreated to Tashkent  , he soon died of illness: \"... and he went to the world of eternity\nResults\nIn 1598–1599, after a series of military campaigns, the Kazakh khans established control over Fergana and parts of Turkestan, including the Tashkent oasis. Fergana was returned at the beginning of the 17th century, and other lands acquired by the Kazakhs remained under their control. Treaties concluded between the Uzbeks and Kazakhs promised the Kazakhs that the Uzbek khans would not interfere in the affairs of the occupied lands.\nReferences"
