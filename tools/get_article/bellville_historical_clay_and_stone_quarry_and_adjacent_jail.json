In 1936 a Jail was built next to the Quarry. Today very little of the Quarry and Jail is left and it was replaced with modern city infrastructure.\nMining Activities\nHume Pipe Company mined clay and produced bricks. A railway line, through Oakdale, was built that linked it to Bellville railway station. This railway was used to transport stones. Two areas were used, one next to the quarry and one in O’Kennedyville. The quarry was an opencast activity. In 1973 there was no more clay in the Quarry. Activities were stopped and no further development took place. Barlow Rand  took control over Hume Pipe Company.\nThe Jail\nThe jail was built so that the prisoners could work as miners. It had a population of 600. When mining activities closed, so did the jail.\nDevelopments after closing up to 1985\nThe Quarry\nIt took Barlow Rand seven years to subdivide the land. They then sold it to the Bellville City Council, in 1980. In 1985 a shopping centre was built on a part of the land  and opened in that year.\nThe railway line\nThe use of it stopped in 1978.\nThe terrain in O’Kennedyville\nOffices and shops were developed (1983). Today it’s known as High Street.\nThe Jail\nIt was rented out as businesses.\nModern developments from 1986 to 2003\nThe Quarry\nAn athletics track (1992), and the Bellville Velodrome for cycling (1997) was built.\nThe terrain next to the quarry where bricks were made\nThe University of Stellenbosch Business School  was developed high up the Quarry (1986). A golf driving range was built on it (1997).\nThe remainder of the quarry and surroundings\nThe part surrounding the two dams (that originated due to the mining activity) were bought by a Mr de Lange from Namibia  in 1995  In 1999 Monex Ltd started to develop the area  and  called it Tyger Waterfront, with residential property, shops, offices and restaurants. This was completed in 2003. A Toboggan track used for entertainment was opened in 2007. .\nThe Jail\nIn 2003 it was demolished and a second shopping centre was built on the land.\nReferences"
