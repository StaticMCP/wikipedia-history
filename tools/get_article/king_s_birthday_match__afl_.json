The event sees celebrities slide into a pool of ice water as a curtain-raiser to the match.\nHistory\nFootball has been played on the Queen's or King's Birthday public holiday since before the first season of the Victorian Football League in 1897. In most years, the VFL scheduled three matches to take place on the public holiday. Since 1936, the public holiday has been set as the second Monday in June.\nMelbourne and Collingwood first faced off in a Queen's Birthday fixture in Round 3, 1898, with Melbourne winning by 10 points. The teams have a long-standing rivalry that was solidified in the 1950s and 1960s when the two sides were the dominant forces in the VFL. Having defeated Collingwood in the 1955 and 1956 grand finals, Melbourne was prevented from equalling Collingwood's record four premierships in a row when Collingwood was victorious in the 1958 grand final. That same year, a crowd of 99,256 saw a top-of-the-table match between the two teams on the Queen's Birthday public holiday; as of 2024, that remains a record for the highest ever home-and-away crowd. Melbourne later defeated Collingwood in the 1960 and 1964 grand finals. Almost half of Melbourne's 13 VFL/AFL premierships came against Collingwood, and the teams have met in seven grand finals, the most of any pairing.\nSince 2001, the AFL has scheduled Melbourne against Collingwood at the Melbourne Cricket Ground as the only match played on the public holiday each year, and this is considered the start of the modern Queen's Birthday match as a stand-alone event. Prior to this, Melbourne and Collingwood had faced each other on the King's/Queen's Birthday public holiday on ten occasions: 1898, 1950, 1958, 1961, 1964, 1977, 1983, 1993, 1996 and 1999; among those, the 1996 match was the only time it was the sole match scheduled for the day. The round in which the game is played is sometimes referred to as the \"King's/Queen's Birthday Round\", although Queensland and Western Australia do not celebrate the monarch's official birthday public holiday on the same date as Victoria.\nThe fixture is traditionally staged at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, which is the home ground for both teams. From 2001 until 2018, the match was always a designated Melbourne home game, resulting in Melbourne receiving a greater portion of the gate and its highest match profit of each season, typically in the order of $800,000 to $900,000. Collingwood, which had a substantially higher membership and more blockbuster fixtures than Melbourne, agreed to and encouraged the deal over that period. Since 2019, when a period of success had seen Melbourne close the financial gap between the clubs, the clubs have agreed to alternate the home team designation between the two clubs each year, with Collingwood's first home game played in 2019.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic interrupted the game's continuity for two years: the match was not played at all in 2020, and it was relocated to the Sydney Cricket Ground at short notice due to a lockdown in Victoria in 2021.\nMatch results\nThis table lists all Queen's/King's Birthday matches since it became an annual fixture between Melbourne and

Commonwealth Games.\nSince 2015 the best player afield has been awarded the Neale Daniher Trophy. Names prior to 2015 refer to the player awarded three Brownlow Medal votes.\nThe 2021 match was played at the Sydney Cricket Ground due to the COVID-19 pandemic and crowd restrictions imposed in Victoria.\nNeale Daniher Trophy\nIn 2015, the Neale Daniher Trophy was first awarded to the best player of the match. It is named after former Melbourne coach Neale Daniher.\nBig Freeze at the 'G\nIn 2014, Daniher made his motor neuron disease (MND) diagnosis public, having been initially diagnosed the year before, and set about helping raise funds for researching the disease. Since then, the Big Freeze at the 'G has a Motor Neuron Disease fundraiser event associated with the King's/Queen's Birthday match. In support of the \"Cure for MND Foundation\", well known football, sporting, entertainment and media personalities slide into a giant ice pool on the ground before the start of the game. Such personalities usually pledge to raise $10,000 for MND research after being nominated, and once successful at hitting this target, they then get to pass on the challenge and nominate the next personality into the \"cold seat\". This person in turn will raise funds and agree to \"Freeze for MND\" if their fundraising goal is met. The challenge will continue right up until the game, with each celebrity challenging the next. The first Big Freeze was held in 2015, and the Neale Daniher Trophy was established in the same year and awarded to the best player on the ground.\nParticipants\n;Big Freeze 1 (2015)\nOver A$2.2
