This was the first live action superhero TV series produced by Toho Company Ltd., and was broadcast on NET (now TV Asahi) from October 6, 1972 to September 18, 1973, with a total of 52 episodes. Mitsuru Adachi wrote a manga series based on the show which was serialized in TV Magazine Otomodachi from 1972 to 1973.\nOverview\nThe series focuses on pro wrestler Takeshi Yamato, a young man who, after training in India with the yogi sage Devadatta, gains the ability to transform into a superhero called Rainbowman who possesses seven different superhero forms called \"Dashes\", with the seven Dashes representing yin and yang (the Moon and the Sun) and the five elements (wu xing) of ancient Chinese philosophy. In each Dash form, Rainbowman is endowed with a color-coded costume and powers related to that element. Dash 1 (yellow) represents the Moon, Dash 2 (red) represents fire, Dash 3 (blue) represents water, Dash 4 (green) represents wood, Dash 5 (gold) represents metal, Dash 6 (brown) represents earth, and Dash 7 (white) represents the Sun. Later in the series, he gains the ability to create a fusion state between Dash 7 and any two other forms with all their related powers.\nRainbowman opposes the \"Die Die Gang\", a group representing hostile foreign powers bent on revenge against Japan for acts carried out in World War II. They make use of elite mercenaries, cyborgs, wizards and supernatural monsters in pursuit of their plans.\nIn 1982, a 22-episode anime remake loosely based on the series was produced. Instead of a superhero as in the live action series, the anime featured a young man who commands seven giant robots which can merge into a larger giant robot.\nCast\n*:\n*Devadatta:\n*:\n*:\n*:\n*:\n*: Reiko Mutō\n*:\n*: Akihiko Hirata\n*: Machiko Soga\nTheme songs\nOpening song\nYuke Rainbowman (行けレインボーマン, Go Rainbowman)\n*Lyrics: Kawauchi Kohan\n*Composition: Jun Kitahara\n*Singer: Yū Mizushima (as Kenji Yasunaga)\nClosing songs\nYamato Takeshi no uta (ヤマトタケシの歌, Theme of Yamato Takeshi (ep. 1 - ep. 13))\n*Lyrics: Kawauchi Kohan\n*Composition: Jun Kitahara\n*Singer: Yū Mizushima\nAitsu no namae wa Rainbowman (あいつの名前はレインボーマン, That Man's Name is Rainbowman (ep. 14 - ep. 52))\n*Lyrics: Kawauchi Kohan\n*Composition: Jun Kitahara\n*Singers: Cat's Eye and Young Fresh\nOther song\n*Shineshine-dan no uta (死ね死ね団の歌, Theme of Shineshine-dan)\n*Lyrics: Kawauchi Kohan\n*Composition: Jun Kitahara\n*Singers: Cat's Eye and Young Fresh\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050428064032/http://www.japanhero.com/profiles/rainbowman.htm Ai No Senshi Rainbow Man at Japan Hero (Archived)]\n*"
