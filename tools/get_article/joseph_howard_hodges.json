His family later moved to Martinsburg, West Virginia, where he attended St. Joseph's High School. After graduating from St. Joseph's in 1928, Hodges studied at St. Charles College in Catonsville, Maryland (1928–1930). He was then sent to further his studies at the Pontifical North American College in Rome.\nPriesthood\nHodges was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Francesco Marchetti Selvaggiani for the Diocese of Richmond in Rome on December 8, 1935. Following his return to Virginia, Hodges was appointed as curate at Sacred Heart Parish in Danville, Virginia. In 1939, he was assigned to St. Andrew's Parish in Roanoke, Virginia, then in 1945 became director of the diocesan mission band. Hodges was named pastor of St. Peter's Parish in Richmond, Virginia, in 1955.\nAuxiliary Bishop of Richmond\nOn August 8, 1952, Hodges was appointed as an auxiliary bishop of Richmond and titular bishop of Rusadus by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration at the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart in Richmond, Virginia, on October 15, 1952, from Bishop Peter Ireton, with Bishops Vincent Waters and John Dearden serving as co-consecrators. In addition to his episcopal duties, Hodges continued to serve as pastor of St. Peter's.\nCoadjutor Bishop and Bishop of Wheeling-Charleston\nHodges was named as coadjutor bishop of what was then the Diocese of Wheeling by Pope John XXIII on May 31, 1961. Upon the death of Archbishop John Swint, Hodges automatically succeeded him as the fifth bishop of Wheeling on November 23, 1962.Hodges attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council in Rome between 1962 and 1965. He dedicated much of his administration to implementing the reforms of the Council in the diocese, establishing a Liturgical Commission, Priests' Senate, Sisters' Council, and Cursillo movement.\nA strong supporter of ecumenism, Hodges established a Commission for Religious Unity in 1964, co-founded the Joint Commission of Roman Catholics and Episcopalians in 1978 with the episcopal bishop of West Virginia, and joined the West Virginia Council of Churches in 1981. He mandated parish councils in 1968, introduced extraordinary ministers in 1970 and permanent deacons in 1975, and renovated the exterior and interior of St. Joseph's Cathedral in Wheeling in 1973.\nThe Vatican renamed the Diocese of Wheeling as the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston on August 21, 1974. In 1976, Hodges established the diocesan Pro-Life Office and led a public protest against the opening of a health clinic in Wheeling that provided abortion services to women. Hodges was also known as a social reformer, using his office to challenge the social, economic, and political injustice in Appalachia.\nHodges publicly supported the American civil rights movement, urged local parishes to begin social outreach programs, and established such social ministry programs as kitchens to serve the hungry and elderly-assistance programs. He served as chairman of the USCCB Ad Hoc Committee for the Campaign for Human Development.\nDeath\nJoseph Hodges died on January 17, 1985, from lung cancer at Wheeling Hospital in Wheeling at age 73.
