Ogden, FSA, FGA, is a British jewellery historian whose research focuses on the development of materials and technology, and the authentication of ancient and historic jewellery. He is considered one of the foremost experts in his field. He has published multiple books and articles, lectured extensively, advised museums and auction houses, and served in academic and industry roles. His 1982 book, Jewellery of the Ancient World (Trefoil and Rizzoli), a study of ancient Old World jewellery technology and materials, received high praise and is still considered the standard work on the subject. Ogden is the founder and a past President of The Society of Jewellery Historians.\nBiography\nEarly life and education\nOgden was born into the fourth generation of a family retail jewellery company based in Harrogate, North Yorkshire. He attended Clifton House School in Harrogate until age 13.\nFrom childhood he showed an interest in archaeology, particularly Egyptology. A visit to the exhibition Tutankhamun and His Time at the Petit Palais, Paris in 1967 is said to have influenced his later research direction.\nOgden attended Tonbridge School for his secondary education and left formal education at age 16 to work in the family jewellery shop.\nLater, Ogden pursued academic qualifications: his PhD from Durham University was awarded based on his demonstrated work, with the thesis ''Gold jewellery in Ptolemaic, Roman and Byzantine Egypt. His supervisor was Prof John Harris, then Chair of Egyptology and the Director of the School of Oriental Studies at Durham. Although leaving formal education with neither A levels nor a university degree, Durham was happy to accept his 1982 book as an 'equivalent qualification'.\nHe also obtained the Gemmology Diploma (FGA) with distinction from the Gemmological Association of Great Britain, and a Diploma in Art, Profession, Law & Ethics with distinction from the Institute of Art & Law.\nHis first academic article, on Roman imitation diamonds, was published in 1973. A detailed study of platinum group element inclusions in ancient gold objects followed in 1977, that same year, conversations with the late John Goodall FSA on ways to bring together academics from around the world who had an interest in the history of jewellery led to the founding of the Society of Jewellery Historians.\nPublishers of his writings include The British Museum Press, University of California Press, Cambridge University Press, Oxford University Press, Yale University Press, the Getty Conservation Institute and several peer-reviewed journals. His books and articles are widely cited in the academic literature dealing with jewellery history and precious metals. Although primarily focusing on jewellery, he has a wide interest in ancient Metals and contributed the chapter on metals in Ancient Egyptian materials and technology'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000).\nOgden has made various TV appearances and radio broadcasts, including interviews on historical aspects of jewellery, and acted as a historical consultant and a presenter for a multi-part documentary series on sapphires by China state broadcaster Central China Television (CCTV).\nCareer\nOgden initially worked in the family jewellery company founded by his great-grandfather, James R Ogden and Sons Ltd. In 1982 he acquired the London premises on Duke Street, St James's, and ran it as a gallery specialising in ancient and historic jewellery. After the lease expired in 1985, he gradually withdrew from retail operations to focus on consultancy work, research and writing.  copper alloy chain with a scanning electron microscope.]] He has held leadership and administrative roles in the jewellery sector, including serving as the Secretary General to the World Jewellery Confederation and Chief Executive of the National Association of Goldsmiths (now part of the National Association of Jewellers), a combined position (1995–2000) and as Chief Executive of the Gemmological Association of Great Britain (2004–2012).\nOgden was appointed to the Treasure Valuation Committee (responsible for agreeing a value on UK archaeological treasure finds) in 1996 – 2013, serving as vice-chairman 2007 – 2013.
