      "text": "# House of Schwarzenberg__disambig_1\n\nThe House of Schwarzenberg () is a German (Franconian) and Czech (Bohemian) aristocratic family, formerly one of the most prominent European noble houses. The Schwarzenbergs are members of the German and Czech nobility, and they once held the rank of Princes of the Holy Roman Empire. The family belongs to the high nobility and traces its roots to the Lords of Seinsheim during the Middle Ages.  The  secundogeniture branch of the Schwarzenbergs was among the foremost Czech patriotic houses.\nThe current head of the family is  (born 1967), son and heir of the late Karel, 12th&nbsp;Prince of Schwarzenberg (1937–2023), a Czech politician who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic. The family owns properties and lands across Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, and Switzerland.\nHistory\nOrigin\nThe family stems from the Lords of Seinsheim, who had established themselves in Franconia during the Middle Ages. A branch of the Seinsheim family (the non-Schwarzenberg portion died out in 1958) was created when Erkinger of Seinsheim acquired the Franconian territory of Schwarzenberg and the castle of Schwarzenberg in Scheinfeld during the early part of the 15th&nbsp;century. He was then granted the title of Freiherr (Baron) of Schwarzenberg in 1429. At that time, the family also possessed some fiefdoms in Bohemia.\nAscent and expansion\nIn 1599, the Schwarzenbergs were elevated to Imperial Counts, and the family was later raised to princely status in 1670. In 1623 came the Styrian Dominion of Murau into the Schwarzenberg family due to the marriage of Count Georg Ludwig of Schwarzenberg (1586–1646) with Anna Neumann von Wasserleonburg (1535–1623). Furthermore, the House of Schwarzenberg acquired extensive land holdings in Bohemia in 1661 through a marriage alliance with the House of Eggenberg. In the 1670s, the Schwarzenbergs established their primary seat in Bohemia and, until 1918, their main residence was in Český Krumlov, Bohemia (now in Czech Republic).\nSchwarzenberg/Sulz family unification\nDue to the absence of a male heir and his only daughter Maria Anna married to Prince Ferdinand of Schwarzenberg, Johann Ludwig II Count of Sulz proposed a family unification between the Counts of Sulz and Princes of Schwarzenberg at the Imperial Court. His request was granted, which not only transferred all legal and property rights upon his death in 1687 from the Sulz family to the Schwarzenberg family, but assured that the Sulz family continues in the Schwarzenberg family. The visible affirmation of this bond was the merging of the coat of arms.\nZámek Jinonice, erb nad vjezdem.jpg|Alliance crest on Jinonice castle\nSchwarzenberg1696.jpg|Ferdinand & Maria Anna\nSchwarzenberg1696rs.jpg|Alliance crest on Schwarzenberg Ducat, which was the own currency issued by the House of Schwarzenberg\nTwo princely lines\nAt the beginning of the 19th&nbsp;century, the House of Schwarzenberg was divided into two princely-titled lines (majorats). This division was already foreseen in the will of Prince Ferdinand (1652-1703). However, the absence of two male heirs until Joseph&nbsp;II and Karl&nbsp;I Philipp inhibited the execution. The senior branch, which held not only the Palais Schwarzenberg in Vienna, but also the Dominions of Scheinfeld, Krumlov, Frauenberg and Murau, died out in the male line in 1979 upon the death of Joseph&nbsp;III of Schwarzenberg, who was the 11th&nbsp;Prince of Schwarzenberg. The cadet branch, which was established by Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg at Orlík Castle, continues to the present day.\nThe two branches have now been re-united under the father of the current head of the family, Karl&nbsp;VII of Schwarzenberg, who was the 12th&nbsp;Prince of Schwarzenberg. He was a Czech politician and served as Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic.\nAdolf, Jan Nepomuk, Josef Schwarzenberg.jpg|The three last Princes of the primogeniture: Adolf (l.), Johann&nbsp;II&nbsp;(m.) and Josef III (r.)\nMsc 2007-Sunday, 09.00 - 11.00 Uhr -Moerk084 Schwarzenberg.jpg|The heir of both lines: Karl VII/I\nSchwarzenberští zaměstnanci, Orlík.jpg|The last Prince of the secundogeniture: Karl VI (m.)\nPresent time\nDue to the unification of the family-headship under Karl&nbsp;VII Schwarzenberg, the fidei commissa of both the primogeniture / Hluboka line and the secundogeniture / Orlik line came under the single ownership of the last-mentioned prince. Karl&nbsp;VII created in the 1980s the current structure of the family belongings. The German and Austrian properties from the primogeniture were embedded (with some exceptions) into the ''Fürstlich Schwarzenberg'sche Familienstiftung (Princely Schwarzenberg Family-Foundation) based in Vaduz. The art collection, which includes the painting The Abduction of Ganymede by Peter Paul Rubens or an important collection of works by Johann Georg de Hamilton, is held in the separate Fürstlich Schwarzenberg'sche Kunststiftung (Princely Schwarzenberg Art-Foundation). The Czech property of the secundogeniture was held until 2023 privately. These properties were in their vast majority also transferred into the Fürstlich Schwarzenberg'sche Familienstiftung. The members of the family follow careers in the private or military sector.\nPeter Paul Rubens - The Abduction of Ganymede - WGA20282.jpg|RUBENS: The Abduction of Ganymede (between 1611 and 1612)\nHunting scene in Hluboka 1865.jpg|Hunting scene with the Princely family in front of Hluboká Castle in 1865\nHamilton Hirschhetze.jpg|HAMILTON: Hirschhetze (1710)\nFrisian and Prussian line\nMichael II Baron zu Schwarzenberg (†1469), oldest son of Erkinger&nbsp;I (1362–1437), was married twice. First with Gertrud (Bätze) von Cronberg (†1438), from whom the princely line descends. His second marriage was with Ursula (Frankengrüner'') Grüner (†~1484), from whom the Frisian and later the Prussian line originates. The children of Michael's and Ursula's alliance were never recognized by their half-siblings, as their first born son was born out of wedlock and the legitimisation only took place with the subsequent wedding.\nJohann Onuphrius (1513–1584), a great-grandson of Michael&nbsp;II and Ursula, is considered to be the progenitor of the Frisian Line. His marriage with Maria von Grumbach (†1564) ensured Groot Terhorne Castle until 1879 as the family seat in the Netherlands. The Frisian line was made a member of the Dutch nobility by a Royal decree of King William&nbsp;I of the Netherlands on August 28, 1814. Henceforth, the Dutch version thoe Schwartzenberg en Hohenlansberg was applied for this branch of the family.\nThe Prussian Line was established as a cadet branch of the Frisian line with Georg Baron thoe Schwartzenberg en Hohenlansberg (1842–1918), who served as a Rittmeister in the Imperial German Army. He and his descendants were made members of the Prussian nobility by an Imperial decree, issued by Emperor Wilhelm&nbsp;II, and are entitled to carry the German title Freiherr.\nImperial immediate estates\nThe Schwarzenberg family held three Imperial Immediate Estates in the Holy Roman Empire.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\"\n! width=20% |Name\n! width=20% |Timespan\n! width=20% |Map\n! width=20% |Coat of Arms\n! width=20% |Historic Map\n|-\n| Princely County of SchwarzenbergGefürstete Grafschaft Schwarzenberg\n| 1429 - 1806- Acquired by the Lords of Seinsheim\t1405 – 1421- Imperial immediacy 1429- Raised to Imperial County 1599- Raised to Princely County\t14 July 1670- German Mediatisation 1806\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| Princely Landgraviate of KlettgauGefürstete Landgrafschaft Klettgau\n| 1410 – 1806- Transition of the Landgraviate of Klettgau from the Habsburg family to the Sulz family 1410- Schwarzenberg / Sulz family unification 1687- Raised to Princely Landgraviate 1687- German Mediatisation 1806\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| County of GimbornGrafschaft Gimborn\n| 1550 – 1782- Imperial immediacy 1631\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nBy coincidence the coat of arms of the Princely Landgraviate of Klettgau and the Earldom of Buchan in Scotland are the same.

However, the Schwarzenberg family's original coat of arms has four silver and four blue vertical stripes. Moreover, it starts with silver on the heraldic right (mirror-inverted perspective).\nThe family became Freiherren (Barons) of Schwarzenberg in 1429, and a silver tower on a black hill was added to their coat of arms to represent the city Scheinfeld and Schwarzenberg Castle.\nIn 1599, Adolf von Schwarzenberg became an Imperial Count, and was given by the emperor a quarter with a canting arms showing the head of a Turk being pecked by a raven. This was to commemorate Adolf's conquest on 19 March 1598 of the Turkish-held fortress and city Győr. The German name of the Hungarian town is Raab, which means raven.\nIn 1670, the Schwarzenbergs were raised to princely status. However, only the marriage of Ferdinand, The 2nd&nbsp;Prince of Schwarzenberg (1652–1703) with Marie Anna Countess of Sulz (1653–1698), the daughter of Johann Ludwig&nbsp;II Count of Sulz (1626–1687), led to the augmenting of their coat of arms, with quarters added for the domains of Sulz, Brandis (canting arms: a brand) and the Landgraviate of Klettgau. Due to the absence of a male heir, Count Rudolf requested at the imperial court that the two families should be consolidated. This was granted, which meant for the Schwarzenberg family not only to assume all titles, rights and duties of the Counts of Sulz, but also to inherit all of Rudolf's properties.\nThe last augmentation of the family coat of arms was granted by the Austrian Emperor Franz&nbsp;II/I, he rewarded Field Marshal Karl&nbsp;I Philipp Prince of Schwarzenberg with the right to bear the three-part arms of the Habsburg family with the addition of an upright standing sword. This unique distinction was granted to commemorate the field marshal's victory in the Battle of the Nations, where he was the Generalissimo of the Sixth Coalition.\nThe family motto is NIL NISI RECTUM

Good, Duke of Burgundy, to celebrate his marriage to Isabella of Portugal.\nThroughout the order's history, eighteen members of the Schwarzenberg family were knights of the highest order and distinction of the Habsburg empire. Their first member Georg Ludwig was admitted in 1627, while their youngest knight Joseph I. was admitted with only ten years of age, after the tragic death of his father. Twice were the Schwarzenbergs Doyen, the title of the oldest ranking member of the order: Joseph I. and Johann Adolph II.. A very rare honour was given to Field Marshal Edmund, by making a  lesser born, ergo not a chief of a line,  knight of the order. Six Schwarzenbergs were knighted by Emperor Franz Joseph.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\"\n! width=9% |No.\n! width=13% |NameComment\n! width=13% |Portrait\n! width=13% |Born\n! width=13% |Age at Knighthood\n! width=13% |Fleece Knight No.\n! width=13% |Year of Knighthood\n! width=13% |Death\n|-\n| 1\n| Georg Ludwig\n|\n| 1586\n| 41\n| 365\n| 1627\n| 1646\n|-\n| 2\n| Johann Adolph I.\n|\n| 1615\n| 35\n| 424\n| 1650\n| 1683\n|-\n| 3\n| Ferdinand\n|\n| 1652\n| 36\n| 546\n| 1688\n| 1703\n|-\n| 4\n| Adam Franz\n|\n| 1680\n| 32\n| 618\n| 1712\n| 1732\n|-\n| 5\n| Joseph I.Youngest knight in the family;Doyen\n|\n| 1722\n| 10\n| 680\n| 1732\n| 1782\n|-\n| 6\n| Johann I.\n|\n| 1742\n| 40\n| 803\n| 1782\n| 1789\n|-\n| 7\n| Joseph II.\n|\n| 1769\n| 39\n| 864\n| 1808\n| 1824\n|-\n| 8\n| Karl I.\n|\n| 1771\n| 38\n| 874\n| 1809\n| 1820\n|-\n| 9\n| Johann Adolph II.Doyen\n|\n| 1799\n| 37\n| 920\n| 1836\n| 1888\n|-\n| 10\n| Karl II.\n|\n| 1802\n| 50\n| 952\n| 1852\n| 1858\n|-\n| 11\n| Edmundonly agnate\n|\n| 1803\n| 59\n| 977\n| 1862\n| 1873\n|-\n| 12\n| Karl III.\n|\n| 1824\n| 57\n| 1050\n| 1881\n| 1904\n|-\n| 13\n| Adolph Joseph\n|\n| 1832\n| 57\n| 1079\n| 1889\n| 1914\n|-\n| 14\n| Karl IV.\n|\n| 1859\n| 48\n| 1148\n| 1907\n| 1913\n|-\n| 15\n| Johann II.\n|\n| 1860\n| 55\n| 1180\n| 1915\n| 1938\n|-\n| 16\n| Joseph III.\n|\n| 1900\n| 51\n| 1239\n| 1951\n| 1979\n|-\n| 17\n| Karl VI.\n|\n| 1911\n| 49\n| 1265\n| 1960\n| 1986\n|-\n| 18\n| Karl VII.
