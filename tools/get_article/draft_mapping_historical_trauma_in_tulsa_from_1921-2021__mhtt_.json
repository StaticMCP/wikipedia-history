The project started in 2019, two years before the centennial of the Tulsa Race Massacre. The project is an archaeological investigation in the Historic Greenwood District that uses restorative justice and community-based participatory research to focus on uncovering how the Black Wall Street community survived for over 100 years. The project maps and preserves the history of Historic Greenwood for future generations through education and outreach.\nReferences"
