Unsatisfied with available implementations in 2010, the author of Rex, Jan Gehring, decided to implement a Perl-based tool to cope with his requirements.\nDesign\nRex is a stand-alone application executing either a single command or so-called tasks. Tasks are specified on the command line and are defined in Rexfiles. A Rexfile takes a similar role for remote execution as a Makefile does for application installation.\nIt is defined via a small DSL, but is essentially a Perl script. Therefore, it can contain arbitrary Perl as well.\nFor code reuse, configuration instructions are placed in modules which can be included by a Rexfile. A template system for configuration files is available.\nFor Rex to be able to work, the managed targets must provide a running SSH server and a Perl 5 interpreter.\nRex serves a variety of applications. Examples are user & group, cron, filesystem, kernel module, process and virtual machine management.\nPublic recognition\nRex is discussed on conferences and in related press releases.\nIt was voted under the Best Open Source solutions 2013 by Initiative Mittelstand.\nSee also\n*Comparison of open-source configuration management software\n*Infrastructure as code (IaC)\n*Infrastructure as Code Tools\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
