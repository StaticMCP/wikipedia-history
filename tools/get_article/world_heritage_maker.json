Software enables automatic start up (after image recognition) or with the play/stop button; you can make transparency background (via alpha channel, blue or green - important in 3D modeling); can to set the angle at which the video to \"save yourself\" sitting in relation to the image, depending on whether the so-called print markers are positioned horizontally (as in all printed products) or at another angle for external entities to vertically mounted panels, posters, etc. If an added 3D image or animation, the choice of angle positioning of the ratio between horizontal and vertical object virtual comment creates a very interesting effect. A new option allows the creation of [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aar_glass.ArsLonga Interactive AR application with Multiscreen mode.]\nHow WHM works\nIn this version the program recognizes up to 100 images, which can be attached virtual response (video, animation, etc.).
