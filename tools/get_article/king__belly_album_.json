The album sold over 350,000 copies. In the two decades since Kings release, many (including some critics) have reconsidered the initial indifferent attitude towards the album and now hold it as an equal to Belly's highly regarded debut Star.\nBackground\nBelly released their debut studio album Star in January 1993, which peaked at number two in the United Kingdom and number 59 in the United States. Among its singles, \"Feed the Tree\" performed the best, reaching number 32 in the UK and number 95 in the US. Belly was nominated for a Best New Act at the Grammy Awards, and won Boston Music Awards for Best Modern Rock Act and Debut Album of the Year. Bassist Fred Abong departed in May 1993 and was replaced by Gail Greenwood. They travelled to Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas to record their next album.\nRelease\nPreceded by the \"Now They'll Sleep\" single in January 1995, King was released in February 1995. \"Seal My Fate\" was issued as the next single in July 1995. Belly went on a US tour with Catherine Wheel. They officially broke up in early 1996.\nReception\n| rev2 = Chicago Tribune\n| rev2score =\n| rev3 = Entertainment Weekly\n| rev3score = B+\n| rev4 = The Guardian\n| rev4score =\n| rev5 = Los Angeles Times\n| rev5score =\n| rev6 = NME\n| rev6score = 5/10\n| rev7 = The Rolling Stone Album Guide\n| rev7score =\n| rev8 = Slant Magazine\n| rev8score =\n| rev9 = Spin\n| rev9score = 8/10\n| rev10 = The Village Voice\n| rev10score = A−\n}}\nIn 2012, King was listed at number seven on PopMatters \"15 Overlooked and Underrated Albums of the 1990s\" list. In 2016, the album was hailed by Will Sheff of Okkervil River as \"a winning, confident, masterful collection of songs – poppy and sweet and with a low-key psychedelic undercurrent. Everything good about Star was still there and had been expanded upon, but in many ways this felt like a new, reinvented band.\"\nTrack listing\n| length1 = 3:48\n| title2 = Seal My Fate\n| writer2 = Donelly\n| length2 = 4:03\n| title3 = Red\n| writer3 =\n| length3 = 3:35\n| title4 = Silverfish\n| writer4 =\n| length4 = 4:00\n| title5 = Super-Connected\n| writer5 =\n| length5 = 4:25\n| title6 = The Bees\n| writer6 = Donelly\n| length6 = 4:58\n| title7 = King\n| writer7 = Donelly\n| length7 = 4:18\n| title8 = Now They'll Sleep\n| writer8 =\n| length8 = 3:14\n| title9 = Untitled and Unsung\n| writer9 = Donelly\n| length9 = 3:33\n| title10 = L'il Ennio\n| writer10 = Donelly\n| length10 = 3:45\n| title11 = Judas My Heart\n| writer11 =\n| length11 = 5:21\n| total_length = 45:00\n}}\nPersonnel\nBelly\n*Tanya Donelly&nbsp;– vocals and guitar\n*Christopher Gorman&nbsp;– drums and percussion\n*Thomas Gorman&nbsp;– guitar and piano\n*Gail Greenwood&nbsp;– bass and vocals\nTechnical personnel\n*Glyn Johns&nbsp;– producer, mixing\n*Jack Joseph Puig&nbsp;– engineer, mixing\n*Oswald \"Wiz\" Bowe&nbsp;– assistant engineer\n*Rail Jon Rogut&nbsp;– assistant engineer\nCharts\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+ Chart performance for King\n!
