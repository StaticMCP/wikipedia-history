Instead of going straight to Algiers, they went to Cherchell where one of his Reis, Kara Hassan, had founded a small sovereignty. Arudj Reis did not want to leave his flank defenceless, he seized the city, put its sovereign to death and left a garrison.\nFollowing the seizure of Cherchell, Arudj Reis and his ally Ahmad al-Kadi marched on Algiers and seized the city.\nReferences"
