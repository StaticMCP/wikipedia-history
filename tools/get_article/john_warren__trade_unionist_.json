In 1933, he was promoted to become an assistant solicitor, then served as town clerk in Newton-le-Willows, Lancashire, followed by Slough.  From 1933 to 1945, he also worked as a part-time lecturer at the University of Liverpool.\nWarren was centrally involved in the Whitley Council system of wage negotiation, representing the National Association of Local Government Officers (NALGO).  He was elected to NALGO's National Executive in 1936, and served until he won election as the union's General Secretary in 1946.  He represented the union on various bodies, including the International Union of Local Authorities, and from 1950 served as joint secretary of the Whitley Council for Local Authorities.\nIn 1954, Warren was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire.  He retired from his trade union posts in 1957, and served on the London Electricity Board.  In his spare time, he wrote a number of books on local government; his 1946 work, The English Local Government System, was translated into German and Hindi.\nReferences"
