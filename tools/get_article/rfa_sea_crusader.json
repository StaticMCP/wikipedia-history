She was described by the RFA as a \"Strategic Lift Ro-Ro\".\nBackground\nIn the mid-1990s the British Ministry of Defence identified a need for sealift ships to support the new Joint Rapid Deployment Force (JRDF, subsequently the Joint Rapid Reaction Force). This requirement would ultimately be met by the construction of six Point-class sealift ships in 2002–3, but the charter of two commercial ships was approved as an interim measure.\nDescription\nSea Crusader/Celestine is the lead ship of a class of six vehicle carriers of 23,986 GT. She is  long and powered by two MAN B&W 7L40/54 diesels of 6,690 shp each. She can carry 654 cars and 157 trailers\nHistory\nKawasaki Heavy Industries built MV Celestine at Sakaide shipyard, Japan in 1996. In October of that year the RFA took the newly built ship on a two-year charter from Oceanarrow (UK) Ltd as RFA Sea Crusader. She would be joined by RFA Sea Centurion in October 1998. The original intention was that Sea Crusader would be replaced by the charter of a new-build sister ship to Sea Centurion, but construction problems with the Sea Chieftain led to the charter of the Sea Crusader being extended until 1 March 2003.\nshe is serving the Purfleet and Immingham routes to Zeebrugge for Cobelfret Ferries under a Belgian flag, homeported in Antwerp.\nReferences"
