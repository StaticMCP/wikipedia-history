      "text": "# Ward Hawkins\n\nWard Hawkins (29 December 1912 &ndash; 22 December 1990) was an American author, who wrote from the 1940s through the 1980s. His later works seem to have been science fiction, but earlier he wrote serial stories for the Saturday Evening Post in the 1940s and 1950s. He often wrote with his brother John Hawkins, and the University of Oregon has a collection of their manuscripts. In the 1960s, the brothers were writing for television, notably as staff writers for Bonanza, and in the 1970s, John Hawkins was a producer and writer for Little House on the Prairie, while Ward was Story Editor and also contributed many teleplays for the program.\nFilmography\nFilms\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
