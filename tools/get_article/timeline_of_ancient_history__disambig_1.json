The transition period from Classical Antiquity to the Early Middle Ages is known as Late Antiquity. Late Antiquity is a periodization used by historians to describe the transitional centuries from Classical Antiquity to the Middle Ages, in both mainland Europe and the Mediterranean world: generally from the end of the Roman Empire's Crisis of the Third Century (c. ACE 284) to the Islamic conquests and the re-organization of the Byzantine Empire under Heraclius. The Early Middle Ages are a period in the history of Europe following the fall of the Western Roman Empire spanning roughly five centuries from CE 500 to 1000. Not all historians agree on the ending dates of ancient history, which frequently falls somewhere in the 5th, 6th, or 7th century. Western scholars usually date the end of ancient history with the fall of the Western Roman Empire in CE 476, the death of the emperor Justinian I in CE 565, or the coming of Islam in CE 632 as the end of classical antiquity.\nHorizontal timeline\nImageSize = width:1000 height:445\nPlotArea  = width:900 height:415 left:65 bottom:20\nAlignBars = justify\nColors =\nid:time value:rgb(0.7,0.7,1) #\nid:period value:rgb(1,0.7,0.5) #\nid:age value:rgb(0.95,0.85,0.5) #\nid:era value:rgb(1,0.85,0.5) #\nid:eon value:rgb(1,0.85,0.7) #\nid:filler value:gray(0.8) # background bar\nid:black value:black\nPeriod     = from:-3000 till:400\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:500 start:-3000\nScaleMinor = unit:year increment:100 start:-3000\nPlotData =\nalign:center textcolor:black fontsize:10 mark:(line,black) width:25 shift:(0,-5)\nbar:Time color:period\nfrom: -3000 till: -1200 text:Bronze Age\nfrom: -1200 till: 400 text:Iron Age\nbar:Mideast color:era\nfrom: -3000 till: -550 text:Mesopotamia\nfrom: -550 till: -322 shift:(0,-10) text:Achaemenid\nfrom: -322 till: -247 shift:(0,0) text:Seleucid\nfrom: -247 till: 224 shift:(0,-10) text:Parthian\nfrom: 224 till: 400 text:Sassanid\nbar:Africa color:age\nfrom: -3000 till: -800 text:Ancient Egypt\nfrom: -800 till: 350 text:Kingdom of Kush\nfrom: 350 till: 400 text:Axumite Empire\nbar:Med/Europe color:era\nfrom: -3000 till: -1200 text:Archaic\nfrom: -1200 till: -650 text:Phoenicia\nfrom: -650 till: -146 text:Ancient Greece\nfrom: -146 till: 400 text:Ancient Rome\nbar:Indus color:age\nfrom: -3000 till: -1200 text:Indus Valley\nfrom: -1200 till: -180 text:Iron Age India\nfrom: -180 till: 1 text:Indo-Greeks\nfrom: 1 till: 400 text:Middle kingdoms\nbar:China color:era\nfrom: -3000 till: -2000 text:Sovereigns and Emperors\nfrom: -2000 till: -200 text:Ancient China\nfrom: -200 till: 400 text:Imperial China\nbar:N.Americas color:age\nfrom: -3000 till: -1500 text:Archaic\nfrom: -1500 till: 400 text:Classic\nbar:C.Americas color:era\nfrom: -3000 till: -1500 text:Archaic\nfrom: -1500 till: 250 text:Formative\nfrom:  250 till: 400 text:Classic\nbar:S.Americas color:age\nfrom: -3000 till: -1900 text:Archaic\nfrom: -1900 till: 200 text:Preclassic\nfrom: 200 till: 400 text:Classic\n:Dates are approximate, consult particular article for details\nMaps\nImage:East-Hem 500bc.jpg|Eastern Hemisphere in 500 BC.\nImage:East-Hem 323bc.jpg|Eastern Hemisphere in 323 BC.\nImage:East-Hem 200bc.jpg|Eastern Hemisphere in 200 BC.\nImage:East-Hem 100bc.jpg|Eastern Hemisphere in 100 BC.\nImage:World in 1 CE.png|World in CE 1.\nImage:World in 100 CE.PNG|World in CE 100.\nImage:East-Hem 200ad.jpg|Eastern Hemisphere in CE 200.\nImage:World in 300 CE.PNG|World in CE 300.\nImage:East-Hem 475ad.jpg|Eastern Hemisphere in CE 486.\nSee also\n*Timeline of Roman history\n*Timeline of post-classical history\n*Timelines of modern history\n*Chronology of the ancient Near East\nReferences\n*  Thorndike 1923, Becker 1931, MacMullen 1966, MacMullen 1990, Thomas & Wick 1993, Loftus 1996.\n*\n*\n*\n*   Web edition is constantly updated.\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*  Eight volumes.\nCitations and notes"
