A fierce battle lasted for 12 hours at Ramkani. The enemy waged guerilla warfare, which made Ranjit Singh fight a defensive battle. The Afghans however decided to withdraw during the night. Misr Sukh Raj played a role of bravery which made him earn 10,000 rupees yearly by the Maharaja.\nAftermath\nAfter this battle, the Sikhs entered the city of Peshawar and Sultan Mohammad Khan, the ruler of the city allied up with the Maharaja already. The Maharaja also wanted to ally up with Dost Mohammad Khan and upon Dost Mohammad's refusal, both sides began preparing for war, leading to the standoff at the Khyber pass.\nReferences\nSee also\n* Nihang\n* Martyrdom and Sikhism"
