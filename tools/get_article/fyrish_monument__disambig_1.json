As the local population were being cleared off the land they had worked for centuries by the Lords of the Land, survival was a problem and so it was built to keep the locals in labour. It was said that Sir Hector rolled stones from the top of the hill to the bottom, thereby extending the amount of time worked and paying the labourers for additional hours.\nIt represents the Gate of Negapatam, a port in Madras, India, which General Munro took for the British in 1781. It is visible from almost anywhere in the parishes of Kiltearn and Alness.\nThe site of the monument provides an extensive view over the Cromarty Firth and beyond, and Ben Wyvis can be seen clearly, especially impressive if snow-covered. A path to the top starts at a car park northeast of the hill at OS grid NH627715.\nReferences\nSources\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061002181022/http://www.clanmunro.org.uk/merchandise_files/maps.htm https://web.archive.org/web/20061002181022/http://www.clanmunro.org.uk/merchandise_files/maps.htm]\n*Touring Guide Scotland, p.&nbsp;151.\nExternal links\n* [http://www.streetmap.co.uk/newmap.srf?x=261500&y=870500&z=3&sv=261500,870500&st=4&ar=N&mapp=newmap.srf&searchp=newsearch.srf Map from Streetmap.co.uk]\n* [http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/ullapool/fyrish-monument.shtml Route to the monument from Walkhighlands]\n* [https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/fyrish-monument-3d-mode-near-evanton-scotland-36aa8859f8dd4680ab0e803e91527f38 3d model representing the monument]"
