He was born in the 4th century and lived until his death in the Byzantine Empire. Forced by Julian the Apostate to serve as a warrior against Christianity, he was imprisoned after being caught helping people in need or defending Christians, and awaited there his death penalty. However, John the Warrior was released after the death of the emperor during a war.\nThe Warrior is always depicted as having dark hair and a beard, as well as wearing a weskit, trousers, boots, scale armour and a cape. Three symbols characterizes him; cross, spear and shield.\nBiography\nDuring the reign of Roman emperor Julian the Apostate in the last era of persecution towards Christians in the Roman Empire, John the Warrior served as a soldier in the army, and was forced by Julian to participate on Christian persecutions. However, as a Christian he warned other against attacks or possible imprisonments, and he sometimes visited prisoners. John was not only good towards Christians, but also towards the poor and people in need. He visited invalids and comforted the suffering. When Julian saw John supporting the Christians, he imprisoned him, where the warrior awaited his death penalty. However, in 363 AD Julian died during the Battle of Samarra, and subsequently John was released from the prison.\nThe exact date of death is unknown, but it is known that he died of very old age. According to a legend, he ordered the place of his funeral and subsequently a devout woman appeared. His relics were preserved in a church in Constantinople dedicated to John the Apostle. It is believed that his relics perform miracles. Believers ask the Saint for intercession and solace for casualties and bereaved people.\nVeneration\nIn the Russian Orthodox tradition, John the Warrior is regarded a helper in sorrow and poverty. Veneration was more common in Little Russia. According to Legends of the Saints (Сказании о святых), the saint was required to pray a special prayer to reobtain stolen things and escaped servants. In the prologs about the Warrior it is said that he \"better prevents servants from fleeing, warns about theft and makes evident revelation\". There is an icon in the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv depicting John the Warrior with prayers and kontaktions to the saint. The first verses are,\n\"О великий заступниче и угодниче Христов Иоанне Воинственниче! Помилуй раба твоего, сущаго в бедах, и скорбех, и во всякой злой напасти, и сохрани от всякаго зла, заступи от обидящаго человека. Тебе бо дана бысть таковая благодать от Бога\".\n\"O mighty intercessor and saint of Christ, John the Warrior! Have mercy upon thy servant who suffers misfortunes, affliction, and all types of adversity. Save him from all evil and protect him from offenders, for thou hast been granted such grace from God\".\nNext is written:\n\"О великий и всемилостивый страдальче Иоанне, дивный и страшный, небеснаго Царя воине! Приими моление от раба твоего и от настоящия бедя, от лукаваго человека, от злаго хищения и будущего мучения избави мя, верно вопиюща Ти аллилуйя\".\n\"O mighty and all-gracious martyr John, glorious and terrifying, warrior of the Heavenly King. Accept the supplication of thy servant and from present misfortunes, from those who plot, from evil plunder and from ordeals yet to be, deliver me who cry faithfully unto to thee Hallelujah\".\nAlso, people imprisoned in dungeons or jails pray for John the Warrior.\nIn The Roman Catholic Church tradition, he is called John the Soldier with his feast day celebrated on July 29.\nTroparion\nA troparion is a short hymn of one stanza, or one of a series of stanzas.\nВсеблагаго Бога и Царя\nблаговерный раб и воин явился еси,\nИоанне чудодетелю,\nпострадав бо ради веры мужески,\nблаженне же скончав течение,\nзриши Всетворца Господа в небесех светлейше.\nОт Негоже прием дарование чудес,\nстраждущим человеком во всяких напастех помогаеши,\nукрепляеши воины в ратех,\nот врагов пленения,\nран же и внезапных смертей\nи от бед лютых изымаеши.\nТемже моли Владыку Христа, приснопамятне,\nда во всяком обстоянии сотворит нам милость,\nи не введет нас во искушения,\nно спасет души наша, яко Человеколюбец.\nO miracle-worker John,\nthou hast been shown to be a truly faithful servant and soldier of God, the all-good Sovereign;\nfor, having suffered, in manly fashion,\nfor the Faith and finished thy course in benediction,\nin the heavens thou dost behold the Lord and Creator of all most splendidly,\nand helpest men who suffer amid all manner of trials.\nThou dost strengthen soldiers in battle,\nrescuing them from capture by the enemy,\nfrom wounds, sudden death and cruel misfortunes.\nWherefore, entreat Christ the Master,\nO ever-memorable one,\nthat He deal mercifully with us in every circumstance,\nthat He lead us not into temptations,\nbut save our souls, for He is a lover of mankind.\nSource: [http://days.pravoslavie.ru/Trop/IT969.htm]\nIconography\nJohn the Warrior is usually depicted with an uncovered head.
