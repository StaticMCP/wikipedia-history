In 1985 the company expanded into aircraft design, as a result of the new ultralight aircraft rules enacted in Australia. The first aircraft design, the Australian LightWing GR532, was first accepted by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority on  29 September 1986. Working in welded 4130 steel tubing, the company offered an alternative to the aluminium and Dacron sailcloth ultralights then being produced.\nIn 1995 the company relocated to the Ballina Byron Gateway Airport industrial park.\nProducts\nThe company has produced a wide range of aircraft, including the high-wing GR 532 GR 582, GR912, Pocket Rocket, ALW Sport and Tapis, the low-wing two-seat SP-2000 Speed, four seat SP-4000 Speed and the low or high-wing SP-6000. There is also a biplane design the PR BiPe and the PR Breeze parasol wing.\nThe SP-2000 has been accepted by the US Federal Aviation Administration as a light-sport aircraft. The company has also entered electric car design with the three-seat Hughes Engineering Road-e.\nOther products include a flight simulator, the Hughes Engineering Cunning Cat  sailboat and a CAD/CAM Cutting Table. The company has also developed computer software, including a telephone messaging system and a business costing and payroll program.\nAircraft\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=center style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n|+ align=center style=\"background:#BFD7FF\"| Summary of aircraft built by Howard Hughes Engineering\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!
