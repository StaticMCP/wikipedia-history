He was a member of the prominent Leeke family of Sutton Scarsdale, Derbyshire, and fought as a Royalist in the English Civil War, where he was killed at the Battle of Lansdowne.\nEarly life and family\nEdward Leeke was born into the influential Leeke (or Leke) family of Sutton Scarsdale. He was the son of Sir Francis Leeke, 1st Earl of Scarsdale, and Anne Carey, daughter of Henry Cary of Berkhamsted. He had several siblings, including Nicholas Leeke, who later inherited the earldom, and Charles Leeke, who also fought and died as a Royalist in the Civil War at the battle of Lansdowne.\nThe Leeke family were long-established landowners in Derbyshire, holding estates at Sutton Scarsdale Hall and the manors of Morton and surrounding areas. As a younger son of the family, Edward inherited status and influence but not the primary family estate. Leeke was knighted at an unspecified date prior to 1628, earning the title “Sir.” The knighthood reflected his family's status and allegiance to the crown.\nPolitical career\nIn March 1628, Sir Edward Leeke was elected as MP for Derbyshire, serving alongside John Frescheville. He sat in the Parliament that passed the Petition of Right, a key constitutional document limiting the powers of King Charles I. His parliamentary service ended in March 1629, when Charles I dissolved Parliament, beginning his eleven-year Personal Rule.\nThere is no record of Leeke delivering speeches or sponsoring legislation.\nEnglish Civil War and death\nDuring the English Civil War, Sir Edward Leeke supported the Royalist cause. He fought in the Battle of Lansdowne on 5 July 1643, near Bath, where he was killed alongside his brother Charles. His death marked the end of his personal political and military contributions.\nReferences"
