It was published by Music Publishers Inc. in New York, New York.\nThe song tells of a young man who returns to work as a manager in his father's factory following his tour of duty as a Private First Class in World War I. His now-unemployed former Captain is hired as a clerk by the delighted former PFC. Sample lyric:\n:When I come into the office he gets up on his feet\n:Stands at attention and gives me his seat\n:Who was it said \"revenge is sweet\"?\n:''I've got my Captain working for me now\nThis song was in the top 20 from October 1919 to January 1920 and reached number 6 in November and December 1919.\nAl Jolson and Billy Murray had successful recordings of the song in 1919-20.  It was also recorded in 1919, by Eddie Cantor, for Pathe (#22201). The song was revived by Bing Crosby in the 1946 film, Blue Skies and he made a commercial recording for Decca Records on July 24, 1946 which was included in his album Blue Skies.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Berlin, Irving, Robert Kimball, and Linda Emmet.
