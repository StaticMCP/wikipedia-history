It is located about  north-east of the town of Scottsdale. The 2016 census determined a population of nil for the state suburb of Warrentinna.\nHistory\nWarrentinna was gazetted as a locality in 1969. The name is an Aboriginal word describing the area.\nThe Warrentinna goldfield was discovered by \"Black Louey\" in 1879. A township was set up in 1891. The miners exploited a number of reefs as tributers to various companies, and the township of Warrentinna was established.\nNearby the Mara siding on the Launceston and North East Railroad was established and later renamed to Warrentinna, when the railway was extended to Herrick in 1919.\nThe largest mine was Golden Mara closed in 1921, and the town was abandoned. Due to subsequent forestry operations there are no remains of the township, although there is still evidence of mining in the forest which is considered of regional historical significance.\nGeography\nThe Boobyalla River rises in the south of the locality and runs through to the north-east.\nRoad infrastructure\nThe C835 route (Warrentinna Road) enters from the south-east and runs north and north-east before exiting in the north-east. Route C834 (Forester Road) starts at an intersection with C835 and runs north-west before exiting.\nReferences"
