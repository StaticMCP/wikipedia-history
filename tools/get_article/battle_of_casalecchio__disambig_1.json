The city of Bologna was aided by the Republic of Florence that supplied 5,000 cavalry (Rose Brigade) commanded by Bernardo della Serra. The Lord of Padua sent cavalry and supplies along with two of his sons.\nVisconti was aided by the Malatesta of Rimini and the Gonzaga of Mantua. With Facino Cane, the condottiero Ludovico Gabriotto Cantelli (Ludovico da Parma) commanded the Milanese vanguard of 8,000 cavalry.\nThe Bolognese-Florentine army was led by Muzio Attendolo, while the Milanese army was commanded by Alberico da Barbiano and Jacopo Dal Verme.\nBattle\nBarbiano had encamped the Milanese forces and initiated skirmishes with the Bolognese-Florentine troops. The Bolognese-Florentines appeared to have gained the advantage from this skirmish, so Bentivoglio ordered Bernardo's forces into the fray. Bernardo refused and Bentivoglio marched his forces out and encamped, well fortified, at Casalecchio.\nA few days later, after much discussion, the Milanese force marched in tight, orderly formation towards the Bolognese-Florentine camp. Caught completely by surprise, the Bolognese-Florentine army retreated leaving their camp in the hands of the Milanese. The Rose Brigade, which had withdrawn to higher ground to evaluate the situation, fled along with 200 lancers.\nGiovanni Bentivoglio was captured and killed two days later. Gian Galeazzo Visconti took Bologna and planned to assault the Republic of Florence and city of Florence next. However, he fell ill on 10 August 1402 and died on 3 September.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*"
