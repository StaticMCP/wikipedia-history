UMRG was formed in 1999 by pooling together Universal Records, Motown Records, and Republic Records, (the first of the three is now defunct), but which gave way to the current incarnations of those labels at the time, Universal Motown Records and Universal Republic Records.\nUniversal Motown Republic Group was one of the three Universal Music Group umbrella units in North America to deal primarily with mainstream pop, rock, and urban performers; the others being: The Island Def Jam Music Group and Interscope-Geffen-A&M. Barry Weiss served as Chairman & CEO of the Company. In the summer of 2011, changes were made at the Universal Motown Republic Group umbrella: Motown Records was separated from Universal Motown Records (causing it to shut down and transfer its artists to either Motown Records or Universal Republic Records) and the umbrella label and merged into The Island Def Jam Music Group, making Universal Republic Records a stand-alone label and shutting down Universal Motown Republic Group.\nCurrent Universal Motown Republic Group Labels\nUniversal Motown Records\n*Casablanca Records\n*Cash Money Records\n**Young Money Entertainment\n*SRC Records\n**Loud Records\n*Rowdy Records\n*Custard Records\n*Ecstatic Peace!\n*Derrty Entertainment\nUniversal Republic Records\n*Casablanca Records\n*Republic Nashville\n*Next Plateau Entertainment\n*Chamillitary Entertainment\n*Serjical Strike Records\n*Tuff Gong\n*Brushfire Records\n*Lava Records\n*ANTI-\nArtists\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
