The series is the first 2D animated series produced by Lucasfilm since the 2003 Clone Wars series and the first 2D animation project created by Lucasfilm Animation; previous 2D animated series such as Ewoks, Droids, and early installments of Clone Wars were created before the formation of the studio. The series is part of Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media's franchise expansion initiative.\nForces of Destiny was created as a series of web shorts because it was felt to better appeal to children's watching patterns: \"The way that kids are consuming content today, they're still watching linear television, but increasingly they're consuming content digitally, online. We've created a story format here that reflects that. It's a combination of digital and linear.\" Each episode is written by Jennifer Muro and directed by Brad Rau.\nThe series' original score, opening theme, and closing theme was composed by Ryan Shore.\nEpisodes\nSeries overview\n(YouTube) (Disney Channel)\n| end1 =  (YouTube) (Disney Channel)}}\n| color2 = #E97638\n| link2 = #Season 2 (2028)\n| episodes2 = 16\n| start2 =  (YouTube) (Disney Channel)}}\n| end2 =  (YouTube) (Disney Channel)\n}}\nSeason 1 (2017)\n|AltDate         = July 9, 2017\n|Aux4            = 2:49\n|ShortSummary    = On Jakku, Rey takes BB-8 home, where BB-8 can stay until someone comes for the droid.

It was initially announced that this release would culminate in the broadcast premiere of the eight episode set on Disney Channel on July 9 as a thirty-minute special, but on July 9, Disney announced via Twitter that only two episodes were going to be broadcast. A second set of eight episodes was released in October 2017. It was subsequently announced that episodes will air in two half-hour specials on Disney Channel on October 1 and 29. The series is available on the Disney+ streaming service, which launched on November 12, 2019.\nBooks\nA series of youth books adapted the episodes. Daring Adventures: Volume 1 adapted shorts about Sabine, Rey, and Padmé, and Daring Adventures: Volume 2 adapted shorts about Jyn, Ahsoka, and Leia. IDW Publishing published Star Wars: Forces of Destiny, a weekly all-ages five-issue comic book miniseries that ran from January to May 2018.\nMerchandising\nAlongside the initial series announcement, Lucasfilm also announced a related toy line from Hasbro and an apparel line. The toy line features a new class of figures, adventures figures fill the space between action figures and dolls. These 11-inch articulated figures of the six core female characters and smaller paired figures of other characters launched on August 1, 2017 alongside accessories such as lightsabers. Other characters, including Luke Skywalker and Kylo Ren, are intended to be released.\nReception\nSyFy Wire calls Forces of Destiny \"a great concept in search of a far better execution. ... What could have been a female-centric version of Genndy Tartakovsky's Clone Wars shorts from 2003 is instead a series of disconnected stories tied to a singular visual aesthetic ... As fun as it is to watch these female characters get a bit more screentime, it's still not enough.\"\nAwards\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Event\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Recipient\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2019\n| ASCAP Screen Music Awards\n| Top Cable Television Series\n| Ryan Shore\n|\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE-zYQdvEYQ Inside Forces of Destiny and Star Wars Animation] on the Star Wars official YouTube Channel\n*"
