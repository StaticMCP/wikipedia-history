      "text": "# What Are You Looking At?\n\nWhat Are You Looking At? was a 2007 BBC comedy show, hosted by Jimmy Carr and produced by Hat Trick Productions. It was a clip show looking back at the week's television. The pilot was recorded, starring Carr, and the BBC planned to make a full series. However, the programme was attacked for being too similar to ITV1 show ''Harry Hill's TV Burp'' and not commissioned for a series. The BBC claimed that, \"Our show will be more spiky.\"\nReferences"
