The core group features Kaiser on guitar along with drummer John \"Drumbo\" French (ex Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band), bassist Andy West (of Dixie Dregs), and Swedish avant-rock drummer Michael Maksymenko.\nAmerican rock critic Robert Christgau said of the album: \"Concept is Beefheart as Dixie Dregs, kind of, with intermittent lyrics, not always in English.\" It was released in 1987.\nFurther recordings were made for a follow-up album; however, it was not released until 2007 as Crazy Backwards Alphabet II.\nTrack listing\nLP version\nSide one\n#\"The Blood and the Ink\" (Bob Adams & John French)  – 5:02\n#\"Det Enda Raka?\" (Michael Maksymenko)  – 1:58\n#\"Get To You\" (John French)  – 4:30\n#\"The Welfare Elite\" (John French & Henry Kaiser)  – 3:52\n#\"Ghosts\" (Albert Ayler)  – 4:18\n#\"Lobster on the Rocks #2\" (John French, Henry Kaiser, Michael Maksymenko, Andy West & Stuart Wold)  – 3:15\nSide two\n#\"Sarayushka (La Grange)\" (Original Composition: Billy Gibbons, Dusty Hill & Frank Beard•Russian Translation: Michael Maksymenko)  – 2:26\n#\"Dropped D\" (Bob Adams, Henry Kaiser, Michael Maksymenko & Andy West)  – 7:53\n#\"The Book of Joel\" (Bob Adams, Everett Shock)  – 2:04\n#\"Bottoms Up!\" (Michael Maksymenko)  – 3:40\n#\"We Are In Control?\" (John French)  – 5:25\n#\"Maran II\" (Michael Maksymenko)  – 0:24\nCD version\n#\"The Blood and the Ink\" (Bob Adams & John French)  – 5:02\n#\"Det Enda Raka?\" (Michael Maksymenko)  – 1:58\n#\"Get To You\" (John French)  – 4:30\n#\"The Welfare Elite\" (John French & Henry Kaiser)  – 3:52\n#\"Ghosts\" (Albert Ayler)  – 4:18\n#\"Lobster on the Rocks\" (John French, Henry Kaiser, Michael Maksymenko, Andy West & Stuart Wold)  – 3:15\n#\"Sarayushka (La Grange)\" (Billy Gibbons, Dusty Hill & Frank Beard•Russian Translation: Michael Maksymenko)  – 2:26\n#\"Dropped D\" (Bob Adams, Henry Kaiser, Michael Maksymenko & Andy West)  – 7:53\n#\"The Book of Joel\" (Bob Adams, Everett Shock)  – 2:04\n#\"Bottoms Up!\" (Michael Maksymenko)  – 3:40\n#\"We Are In Control?\" (John French)  – 5:25\n#\"Maran II\" (Michael Maksymenko)  – 0:24\n#\"No Doubt About It, I Gotta Get a New Hat\" (Henry Kaiser)  – 4:32*\n#\"Secret of the Telegian\" (Greg Goodman, Henry Kaiser & Michael Maksymenko)  – 6:17*\n#\"\"Lite\" Blue Mousse\" (Bob Adams, Henry Kaiser, Michael Maksymenko & Ralf Nygard)  – 7:11*\n#\"The Same Thing\" (Willie Dixon)  – 5:59*\n#\"Herr Magazine\" (Bob Adams, Everett Shock, Henry Kaiser & Michael Maksymenko)  – 3:04*\nbonus tracks on CD only\nPersonnel\nCrazy Backwards Alphabet are\n*Henry Kaiser – guitar (tracks 1–10, 12), slide guitar (tracks 1, 5, 10, 11), banjo (tracks 4, 12), backing vocals (tracks 6, 9)\n*John French – drums (tracks 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 12), lead vocals (tracks 1, 3), guitar (track 3), harmonica (track 3), keyboards (track 11)\n*Michael Maksymenko – drums (tracks 2, 5, 6, 8–10), lead vocals (tracks 2, 6, 7, 10), backing vocals (track 9)\n*Andy West – bass (tracks 2–12)\nSpecial guests\nBob Adams – guitar (track 1), bass (track 1)\nScott Colby – slide guitar (track 3), lead vocals (track 9)\nDarol Anger – violin (track 4)\nHarry Duncan – harp (track 10)\nBill Frisell – guitar\nRalph Nygard – midi wind controller bass\nProduction crew\nHenry Kaiser – producer/engineer\nPhil Brown – engineer\nOliver DiCiccco – engineer\nMark Bryan Johnson – engineer\nMatt Groening – artwork and album concept\nHugh Brown – photography\nRecorded in 1986, except 13 & 14 in 1987 and 15 in 1991.\nReferences"
