She won a bronze medal representing her country in the women's all-around team event at the 1978 Commonwealth Games.\nBiography\nGerlach was born Kirsty Elizabeth Durward in Te Puke in about 1959, one of six children of Lois and Peter Durward. She was educated at Rotorua Girls' High School, becoming a national gymnastics champion, and won a full scholarship to California State University, Long Beach when she was 17 years old.\nDurward was recruited to Long Beach State by coach Marion Duncan, but Duncan had departed by the time that Durward arrived. From 1977 to 1980, Durward won four consecutive silver medals in vault at the AIAW National Women's Collegiate Gymnastics Championships. She was inducted into the Long Beach State Athletics Hall of Fame in 1997.\nDurward represented New Zealand at the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, placing tenth in the women's individual all-around competition, and winning the bronze medal—alongside Lynette Brake, Rowena Davis and Deborah Hurst—in the women's team all-around.\nIn 1981, Durward married her Long Beach State gymnastics coach, Steve Gerlach. The couple went on to have four children, and lived between New Zealand and the United States. Initially, Steve Gerlach continued coaching in New Zealand and overseas, and Kirsty Gerlach established an audiology practice in Rotorua. They settled permanently at Lake Ōkareka, near Rotorua, in 2002.\nKirsty Gerlach was diagnosed with motor neuron disease in 2017, and shortly after had to retire from her 33-year career as an audiologist. A 25-minute documentary film, called Kirsty, about Gerlach's illness, was made by a fourth-year film student, Keziah Manabat, from the South Seas Film and TV School, in 2019, and was a finalist at the 2020 Watersprite Film Festival in Britain.\nGerlach died from her illness on 13 September 2020.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
