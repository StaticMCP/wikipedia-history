It features American rapper Juicy J and was produced by Arthur McArthur. In March 2022, the song gained newfound popularity due to widespread use on the video-sharing app TikTok.\nComposition and critical reception\nDavid Jeffries of AllMusic wrote, \"jump right to the hedonistic 'Thinking with My D**k,' where the worlds of Pimp C and cloud rap collide, creating quite the druggy, strip-club spectacle.\" Derek Staples of Consequence of Sound regarded the song as misogynist, writing that it provides \"a look back at Gates' vice-laden adolescence\".\nTikTok use\nOn March 1, 2022, at a Mardi Gras celebration in Lafayette, Louisiana, local man John E. Weatherall III took a video of another man, Steven Barbosa, dancing and rapping to the song while holding an American flag cup, with a woman in the background clapping. The video was posted on TikTok and immediately went viral; the song became significantly used in many videos on TikTok. In March 2022, the song was re-released as a single and peaked at number 37 on the Billboard Hot 100. Gates added the song to his album Khaza (2022), increasing sales.\nAt a concert at the Cajundome around May 2022, Gates brought Barbosa with him onstage during his performance of the song.\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Chart performance for \"Thinking with My Dick\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2022)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nCertifications\nReferences"
