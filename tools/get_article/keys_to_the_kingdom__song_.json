It is the album's opening track, and entered the UK Rock chart at number 33, although it was not released as a single. The song was written by the band and produced by co-lead vocalist Mike Shinoda and lead guitarist Brad Delson. The song was not performed by the band during the album's accompanying The Hunting Party Tour, and would not see a live debut until the From Zero World Tour in 2024.\nComposition\n\"Keys to the Kingdom\" is explained in an early preview for the album as, \"Right off the bat this track has an old-school punk vibe with a new twist. The hasty drums and explosive riffs  [add] a hardcore element to it. Vocalist Chester Bennington unleashes melodies and the balance of Shinoda’s rap verses makes for a powerful combination. Although the band will be playing arenas on their forthcoming Carnivores tour, this song has an underground feel that would welcome them to a small, beat up venue in Brooklyn, N.Y.\" The song continues its outro into the album's second track, \"All for Nothing\" featuring Page Hamilton of Helmet.\nLive performances\n\"Keys to the Kingdom\" was initially never performed live prior to Bennington's death in July 2017. During Shinoda's Manila concert of his solo Post Traumatic Tour in September 2019, Shinoda performed a snippet of \"Keys to the Kingdom\" during \"Sorry for Now,\" marking the first time the song had been performed live in any capacity.\nFollowing Linkin Park's announced reformation in 2024 with new members Emily Armstrong and Colin Brittain, \"Keys to the Kingdom\" was performed live in full for the first time at the band's first concert of the From Zero World Tour at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, California on September 11, 2024. Armstrong, the band's new vocalist, took up lead vocals of the song.\nReception\nIn a track-by-track review for the album, by Billboards Kenneth Partridge highlighted Linkin Park's \"back-to-basics approach\", hardcore punk-styled introduction, and overall nu metal sound akin to their early releases.\nPersonnel\n* Chester Bennington – vocals\n* Mike Shinoda –  lead and rap vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboards\n* Brad Delson – lead guitar, backing vocals, programming\n* Dave \"Phoenix\" Farrell – bass guitar, backing vocals\n* Joe Hahn – sampling, programming\n* Rob Bourdon – drums, percussion\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Chart performance for \"Keys to the Kingdom\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Chart (2014)\n! scope=\"col\" | Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | UK Rock & Metal (OCC)\n| 33\n|}\nReferences"
