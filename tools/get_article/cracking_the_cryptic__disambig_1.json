They occasionally stream puzzle videogames on YouTube.\nThe channel was set up in 2017 by two friends from England: Simon Anthony, a former investment banker, and Mark Goodliffe, a financial director. Anthony is a former member of the UK's world sudoku and world puzzle championship teams, while Goodliffe is a 14-time winner of the Times Crossword Championships and UK sudoku champion.\nEach video is generally composed of one of the two hosts presenting a puzzle with given rules and then solving it in real time, with their live commentary. The channel features both standard and variant puzzles.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the channel grew in popularity, and  it had 650,000 subscribers, with the most popular video receiving nearly 10 million views.\nThe music played at the beginning and end of many videos is Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 16, nicknamed Sonata facile or Sonata semplice. Occasionally, Simon will play his guitar as part of the introduction to the video, in place of Sonata No.16.\nOther activities\nThe channel has produced twelve Sudoku apps based on Sudoku variants: Classic, Chess, Miracle, Sandwich, Thermo, Killer, Arrow, Domino and Line Sudoku.\nIn October 2020, a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign was announced in order to produce a physical book with some of the channel's most popular puzzles. The campaign reached its initial target within 24 hours. A second volume was funded in October 2022.\nIn addition to paper-and-pencil puzzles, the pair stream puzzle video games such as The Witness, Baba Is You, Blue Prince and Return of the Obra Dinn.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
