There is also an elected township fiscal officer, who serves a four-year term beginning on April 1 of the year after the election, which is held in November of the year before the presidential election. Vacancies in the fiscal officership or on the board of trustees are filled by the remaining trustees.\nPublic services\nTelephone service is provided through South Lebanon, Lebanon, Mason, and Morrow exchanges, while the South Lebanon, Lebanon, Kings Mills, and Morrow post offices serve the township.\nInterstate 71 crosses the township from southwest to northeast and State Route 48 from south to north.
