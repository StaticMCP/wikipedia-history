The fire hall was designated as a heritage building in 1982, the Historical Society was established in 1994, and the museum was officially opened on 24 May 2008.\nThe main attraction is a fire truck from 1939. The museum also features exhibits on local history including early settlers, Métis history, military history, the 1950 Red River Flood, and local musicians. The successful Winnipeg-based rock band The Guess Who donated a collection of master tapes and videos from their long history in 2018. A large doll collection donated by local residents is also on display. It is open Tuesday to Saturday from 10 to 4 with winter hours on Saturday only.\nThe Museum is affiliated with: CMA,  CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
