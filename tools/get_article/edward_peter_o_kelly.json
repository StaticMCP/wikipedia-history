He grew up attending school at Mountrath Monastery and St Patrick's College, in Carlow, Ireland.\nCareer\nO'Kelly was elevated to Chairman of the Baltinglass Board of Guardians in 1893 and was appointed a magistrate in 1894. He was a passionate Land Leaguer.\nIn April 1895, O'Kelly was elected as a Member of Parliament as an Anti-Parnellite Irish National Federation candidate at the by-election for the East Wicklow constituency, following the resignation of John Sweetman MP. However, Parliament was dissolved on 8 July for the 1895 general election, and O'Kelly decided not to defend his seat. Instead, O'Kelly focused on local politics, becoming the first chairman of the newly established Wicklow County Council in 1899.\nIn 1910, O'Kelly returned to the House of Commons as the Member of Parliament (MP) representing West Wicklow, having been elected unopposed at a March 1910 by-election to fill the vacancy caused by the death of James O'Connor. He was re-elected unopposed in December 1910 and held the seat until he died in office in July 1914, aged 68. in Marylebone, London, England, from diabetes.\nPersonal life\nO'Kelly married Judith Whelan (1862–1911), the daughter of Myles Whelan of Athy, County Kildare, in 1882, by whom he had issue: Eileen (Sister Marie de Chantal), Anne Edith (Sister Mary Magdalen), Edward John, Teresa Mary (Sister Mary Marguerite), Joseph, Mrs Agnes Lynch; Father Patrick O'Kelly SJ, Muriel Carmella, Prof. William D. O'Kelly, Genevieve, and Mrs Ethel O'Loughlin.\nO'Kelly was a close friend of Douglas Hyde, first President of Ireland, and John Redmond, a leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
