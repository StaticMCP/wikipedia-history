Richard Yerburgh, Rector of High Bickington, Devon, and Vicar of Sleaford, Lincolnshire, by his marriage to Susan, one of the daughters of John Higgin, of Greenfield, Lancashire. His mother, a niece of William Higgin,  Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, died in 1860, and he was brought up by his father, before being educated at Sleaford and Boston Grammar School and then at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated BA and MA.\nThe young Yerburgh was Curate of St Peter's, Eaton Square, from 1881 to 1891, then Rector of Christ Church, Marylebone, until 1899, and from 1895 to 1897 was Commissary for Charles Scott, Bishop of North China. At Marylebone he was chairman of three school governing bodies and a member of the boards of the Paddington Green Children's Hospital and the London Playing Fields Association.\nIn 1899, Wardell-Yerburgh resigned from his rectory at Marylebone to accept the vicarages of Tewkesbury and the neighbouring Walton Cardiff, in Gloucestershire.
