It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.\nThe site is one of 20 or more prehistoric Indian shell middens in a ring shape located from the central coast of South Carolina to the central coast of Georgia.  It is believed to date early in the second millennium BC, and to contain some of the earliest pottery known in North America. The Sea Pines ring stands about  above a flat central area, which is about  above mean sea level.\nReferences"
