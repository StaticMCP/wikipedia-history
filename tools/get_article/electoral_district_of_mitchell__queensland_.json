A by-election was held to fill the seat. The nomination date was 18 March 1865 and the election was held on 25 March 1865.\nIn 1885, part of Mitchell was removed to form the new Electoral district of Barcoo.\nIn 1931, a redistribution absorbed Mitchell into the Electoral district of Barcoo and the Electoral district of Gregory.\nMembers\nThe following people were elected in Mitchell:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
