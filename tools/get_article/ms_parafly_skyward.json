Now out of production, when it was available the aircraft was supplied complete and ready-to-fly.\nDesign and development\nThe Skyward line was designed to comply with the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles rules as well as European regulations. It features a paraglider-style wing, single-place accommodation and a single engine in pusher configuration with a reduction drive and a  diameter two-bladed composite propeller, depending on the model. The aircraft is noted for its low noise.\nAs is the case with all paramotors, take-off and landing is accomplished by foot. Inflight steering is accomplished via handles that actuate the canopy brakes, creating roll and yaw.\nVariants\n;Skyward 1\n:Model with a  Solo 210 engine in pusher configuration with a 2.5:1 ratio reduction drive and a  diameter two-bladed composite propeller.
