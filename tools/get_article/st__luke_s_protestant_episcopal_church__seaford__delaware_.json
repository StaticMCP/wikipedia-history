It was built in 1843, and reconstructed in 1904.  It is a two-story, brick Gothic Revival style building.  It has a one-story chancel and crenellated three-story tower.  It features stained glass lancet windows.  Concrete buttresses were installed in 1943.  St. Luke's was organized by the Rev. Corry Chambers in 1835, from the remnants of the former St. Mary's congregation. St. Mary's was founded in 1704, but disestablished after the American Revolution. Delaware Governor William H. H. Ross (1814-1887) is buried in the churchyard.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.stlukesseaford.org/ St. Luke's Episcopal Church website]"
