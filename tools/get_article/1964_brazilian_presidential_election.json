José Maria Alkmin was elected vice-president unopposed after Auro de Moura Andrade withdrew his candidacy.\nBackground\nFollowing the events of the coup in the same year, João Goulart, the president, was deposed by allegations of leaving the country with no permission. Since João Goulart was already the vice president, the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Ranieri Mazzili, assumed the post until a new president to be elected until 1965 (the end of João Goulart term) by the National Congress of Brazil. The date of election, was scheduled by the first Institutional Act, amended by the Supreme Command of the Revolution, the de facto ruler over Brazil at that moment.\nThe Social Democratic Party, now as an opposition party in parliament, like the National Democratic Union, agreed to elect Castelo Branco as president. Castelo Branco  promised to preserve the Brazilian Democracy and fight against corruption and the crisis in the country. A new civil vice-president was elected on the same day.\nResults\nPresident\nThe election was virtually a single-runner election; some parliamentarians voted for Juarez Távora as a protest vote.\nVice President\nNone of the candidates for vice-president achieved the required absolute majority of votes in the first round.
