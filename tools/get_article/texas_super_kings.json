The team's home ground is Grand Prairie Stadium. The stadium has a capacity of 7,200; it can be expanded to seat 15,000 for major events.\nThe team was announced in 2023 as one of six inaugural teams to play in the league. The team has two minor league affiliates – the Dallas Mustangs and the Dallas Xforia Giants, which both compete in Minor League Cricket (MiLC) alongside 24 other teams. The franchise is co-owned by Chennai Super Kings Cricket, Ross Perot Jr., and Anurag Jain.\nThe team is coached by Stephen Fleming and is captained by South African Faf du Plessis.\nFranchise history\nBackground\nIn November 2020, USA Cricket announced that ACE had acquired a 15-year lease for a former Minor League Baseball stadium to be renovated into a fully-fledged cricket stadium, which would host the Dallas franchise Major League Cricket team. Plans were reaffirmed two years later in December 2022, where MLC officially announced its 2023 season and the name of the Texas franchise home ground, Grand Prairie Stadium.\nIn May 2022, it was formally announced during a Series A and A1 fundraising round for Major League Cricket that Anurag Jain and Ross Perot Jr. – who were among many big-name investors such as Satya Nadella and Sanjay Parthasarathy – would co-own the Texas franchise cricket team.\nIn the buildup to the 2023 draft – which was held on March 19, the Texas franchise announced its partnership with the Chennai Super Kings. Following the draft, the team held a press conference wherein co-owner Anurag Jain, amongst Stephen Fleming and K.S. Viswanathan, publicly announced their team name – the Texas Super Kings, logo and coach for the first time. However, it was announced in late April that they had revamped their logo for it to look similar to the logos of the Chennai and Joburg Super Kings.\n2023 season\nPrior to the launch of the official season, it was announced the MLC's inaugural domestic draft would take place on March 19, 2023. The Super Kings had the final pick of the first round draft and selected Rusty Theron, before adding Sami Aslam, Calvin Savage, and Milind Kumar with later selections. In June 2023, the Super Kings announced seven of their nine overseas signings, including Ambati Rayudu, Devon Conway, and Dwayne Bravo. In addition, they announced their full support staff lineup, including Albie Morkel and Eric Simons, among others. They subsequently announced that former South African skipper, Faf du Plessis, would captain the side and on July 5, selected Mohammad Mohsin as their domestic wildcard pick.\nRayudu withdrew from the tournament following the Board of Control of Cricket in India's proposal of a year-long \"cooling-off period\" for recently retired players and his place taken by Imran Tahir.\nIn the opening match of the tournament on July 13, the Super Kings recorded a 69-run win over the Los Angeles Knight Riders. This was followed by a 6-run defeat to the Washington Freedom in their second match, a 17-run victory over MI New York and an 8-wicket defeat to the Seattle Orcas.\nA three-wicket win over the San Francisco Unicorns ensured a top-two finish going into the playoffs, but losses to both Seattle and New York saw the team eliminated.\n2024 season\nAhead of the start of the 2024 season on July 5, on February 15, 2024, the Super Kings released a list of retentions for overseas players, including captain Faf du Plessis, Devon Conway and Mitchell Santner. During the domestic players' draft, the Texas Super Kings selected Joshua Tromp and Raj Nannan. Outside of the draft, the team announced a series of overseas signings from New Zealander Daryl Mitchell to Australian Marcus Stoinis. Mitchell however, following an injury, was ruled out of the season and was replaced by Afghan cricketer Noor Ahmad. The Super Kings reached the playoffs for the second time in a row after winning three of the seven group stage matches.\nCurrent squad\n* Players with international caps are listed in bold.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n|+Texas Super Kings roster\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Position\n!scope=\"col\"|Name\n!scope=\"col\"|Nationality\n!scope=\"col\"|Date of birth (age)\n!scope=\"col\"|Batting style\n!scope=\"col\"|Bowling style\n!scope=\"col\"|Year signed\n!scope=\"col\"|Notes\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" style=\"background: #DCDCDC text-align=center;\"| Batters\n|scope=\"row\"|Faf du Plessis\n| |||| Right-handed || Right-arm leg-break || 2023 ||Direct signing, captain\n|-\n|scope=\"row\"|Milind Kumar\n| |||| Right-handed || Right-arm off-break || 2023 ||\n|-\n|scope=\"row\"|Saiteja Mukkamalla\n| |||| Right-handed || Right-arm off-break|| 2023 ||U23 player\n|-\n! rowspan=\"9\" style=\"background: #DCDCDC text-align=center;\" | All-rounders\n|scope=\"row\"|Calvin Savage||\n||| Right-handed || Right-arm fast || 2023 ||\n|-\n|scope=\"row\"|Zia Shahzad||\n||| Right-handed || Right-arm legbreak || 2023 ||\n|-\n|scope=\"row\"|Dwayne Bravo||\n| ||Right-handed ||Right-arm medium fast ||2023 ||Direct signing\n|-\n|scope=\"row\"|Mitchell Santner||\n| ||Left-handed ||Slow left-arm orthodox ||2023 ||Direct signing\n|-\n|scope=\"row\"|Marcus Stoinis||\n| ||Right-handed ||Right-arm medium fast ||2024 ||Direct signing\n|-\n|scope=\"row\"|Aaron Hardie||\n| ||Right-handed ||Right arm medium-fast||2024 ||Direct signing\n|-\n|scope=\"row\"|Cameron Stevenson||\n| ||Right-handed ||Right arm fast-medium ||2023 ||\n|-\n|scope=\"row\"|Raj Nannan||\n| ||Left-handed ||Slow Left arm Orthodox ||2024 ||\n|-\n|scope=\"row\"|Daryl Mitchell||\n| ||Right-handed ||Right-arm medium ||2024 ||\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #DCDCDC text-align=center;\"| Wicket-keepers\n|scope=\"row\"|Devon Conway||\n| ||Left-handed ||Right-arm medium ||2023  ||Direct signing\n|-\n|scope=\"row\"|Joshua Tromp||\n|||Right-handed ||Right arm medium ||2024 ||Drafted\n|-\n! rowspan=\"5\" style=\"background: #DCDCDC text-align=center;\"| Bowlers\n|scope=\"row\"|Mohammad Mohsin\n| |||| Left-handed || Left-arm leg break googly || 2023 ||\n|-\n|scope=\"row\"|Zia-ul-Haq\n| |||| Right-handed || Left-arm fast-medium || 2023 ||\n|-\n|scope=\"row\"|Naveen-ul-Haq\n| |||| Right-handed || Right-arm medium-fast || 2024 ||\nDirect Signing\n|-\n|scope=\"row\"|Noor Ahmad\n| |||| Right-handed || Left-arm unorthodox || 2024 ||\n|-\n|scope=\"row\"|Ottniel Baartman\n|  ||  || Right-handed || Right-arm medium-fast || 2024 || Injury replacement\n|-\n|}\nAdministration and support staff\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Texas Super Kings staff\n!scope=\"col\"|Position\n!scope=\"col\"|Name\n|-\n|scope=\"row\"|Head coach\n|Stephen Fleming\n|-\n|scope=\"row\"|Assistant coach\n|Eric Simons\n|-\n|scope=\"row\"|Assistant coach\n|Albie Morkel\n|-\n|scope=\"row\"|Team manager\n|Russell Radhakrishnan\n|-\n|scope=\"row\"|Strength and conditioning\n|Greg King\n|-\n|scope=\"row\"|Physiotherapist\n|Tommy Simsek\n|}\nPerformance\nStandings\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Year\n!League standing\n!Final standing\n|-\n|2023\n|2nd\n| style=\"background: #cfc\"  |Challenger\n|-\n|2024\n|3rd\n|style=\"background: #cfc\" |Challenger\n|-\n|2025\n|2nd\n|style=\"background: #cfc\" | Challenger\n|}\n*  C: champions\n*  RU: runner-up\n*  CH: team eliminated in the Challenger stage of the play-offs\nSeason summary\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Year\n!Played\n!Won\n!Lost\n!NR\n|-\n!2023\n|7\n|3\n|4\n|0\n|-\n!2024\n|7\n|3\n|2\n|2\n|-\n!2025\n|10\n|7\n|3\n|0\n|-\n!Total\n!24\n!13\n!9\n!2\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |Source: ESPNCricinfo\n|}\nNotes\nSee also\n* Chennai Super Kings\n* Joburg Super Kings\nReferences\nExternal links"
