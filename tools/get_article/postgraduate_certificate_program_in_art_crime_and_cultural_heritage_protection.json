The course programming consists of 10–11 weeks of academic instruction at the postgraduate level and is hosted in Amelia, Italy. The instruction covers a wide variety of theoretical and practical elements of art and heritage crime and examines art crime's interconnected world of art criminals, investigators, lawyers and art historians. The courses include comprehensive lectures and discussions exploring art crime, its nature and impact, as well as what is currently being done to mitigate it.\nProgram\nThe program includes approximately 25 lecture hours per week of customized instruction over the course of one summer, for a total of approximately 250 contact hours with teaching professionals. This format allows students to complete the classroom portion of the program onsite, before writing their thesis remotely. ARCA selected this configuration to facilitate both student and allied professional enrollment, to ensure that both groups might undertake the program of study during one summer between academic advanced degrees or during a brief sabbatical or hiatus from work.\nThis program is currently being run under the auspices of the association and is considered a professional development program and not a master's degree program. While the courses comprising the Postgraduate Certificate Program may be used as evidence in support of a student's application for admission to a graduate degree program, the certificate itself is not considered to be a prerequisite, completing the program does not guarantee admission into a graduate study program. Prerequisites for this program require that applicants have completed an undergraduate degree by the start date of the program. The program has run each summer since 2009.\nFaculty\nRecent instructors and lecturers have included:\n*Dr. Stefano Alessandrini –  [http://www.artcrimeresearch.org/our-people/ Consultant to Il Ministero per i Beni Culturali e Ambientali]\n*Marc Balcells, [https://johnjay.academia.edu/MarcBalcells Criminal Defence Attorney and Criminologist, Professor Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche, Consultant Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, Graduate Teaching Fellow at The City University of New York - John Jay College of Criminal Justice]\n*Dr. Noah Charney, Founding Director of ARCA and Adjunct Professor of Art History, American University of Rome\n*Dr. Duncan Chappell, Lawyer and Criminologist, [http://sydney.edu.au/law/about/people/profiles/duncan.chappell.php Adjunct Professor in the Faculty of Law at the University of Sydney], Conjoint Professor in the School of Psychiatry at the University of NSW,\nChair of the International Advisory Board of the Australian Research Council's Center of Excellence in Policing and Security, Former Director of the Australian Institute of Criminology (1987-1994)\n*Dr. Crispin Corrado, academic director, adjunct professor and lecturer in archaeology and classics at the American University of Rome, [http://www.johncabot.edu/about_jcu/directory/Faculty_Form.aspx?IdFaculty=455 John Cabot University], and [http://rome.cua.edu/faculty-staff.cfm The Catholic University of America]\n*Dick Drent, [https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=AAkAAACPWAIBERCTumvGP2X-z7EqVPXbnqdL-4g&authType=NAME_SEARCH&authToken=Nw7J&locale=en_US&trk=tyah&trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Amynetwork%2CclickedEntityId%3A9394178%2CauthType%3ANAME_SEARCH%2Cidx%3A1-1-1%2CtarId%3A1441351282240%2Ctas%3Adick%20drent Museum Security Expert, Law Enforcement and National Security Expert, Director, Omnirisk, Associate Director, Holland Integrity Group, Corporate Security Manager, Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam  (retired)]\n*Richard Ellis, [https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=ADEAAAMqL9sBb6V540FCnh1BUAzNVijditknT0c&authType=NAME_SEARCH&authToken=05dp&locale=en_US&srchid=11555791441351248335&srchindex=1&srchtotal=896&trk=vsrp_people_res_name&trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A11555791441351248335%2CVSRPtargetId%3A53096411%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary%2CVSRPnm%3Atrue%2CauthType%3ANAME_SEARCH Director, Art Management Group and former Head Art and Antiques Squad Metropolitan Police, New Scotland Yard (retired)]\n*Dr. Tom Flynn, [https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomflynn Art Historian and London Art Lecturer, Adjunct Assistant Professor, Richmond The American International University, Sr. Lecturer and Course Director, RICS-Accredited Art Market & Art Appraisal Kingston University, Lecturer, History of the Art Market, Art & Business, IESA/Wallace Collection]\n*Dr. Valerie Higgins, [http://www.aur.edu/academics/archaeology-and-classics/valerie-higgins/ Associate Professor of Archaeology and Classics, Program Director, MA Programming in Sustainable Cultural Heritage at the American University of Rome]\n*Dr. Laurie Rush, Board Member, [http://uscbs.org/uscbs-board.html U.S. Committee of the Blue Shield]\n*Dorit Straus, Vice President and Worldwide Specialty Fine Art Manager for Chubb & Son, a division of Federal Insurance Company (retired), [http://artrecovery.com/About Insurance Industry Consultant, Art Recovery International]\n*Judge Arthur Tompkins, Forensic Expert, District Court Judge, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150924064523/http://www.paroleboard.govt.nz/about-us/whos-who.html New Zealand Ministry of Justice]\n*Dr. Christos Tsirogiannis Forensic Archaeologist, Illicit antiquities researcher, University of Cambridge, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150924064523/http://www.paroleboard.govt.nz/about-us/whos-who.html Research Assistant, Scottish Centre for Crime and Justice at Trafficking Culture University of Glasgow] – Cambridge\nCourses are supplemented with field classes and guest lecturers.
