Suzu ware pottery has been found in many locations along the coast of the Sea of Japan as far north as Hokkaido, indicating that it was a common trade good for the coastal commerce. The Muromachi period was a golden age for Suzu ware, but it soon went into decline, and vanished by the time of the Sengoku period, unable to complete with large-scale production in areas such as Tokoname. In recent times, however, production of pottery along those traditional lines has resumed.\nSuzu ware was fired in tunnel-shaped kilns built into hill slopes, at over 1100 degrees. Upon extinguishing the fire, the furnace opening and the flue were sealed to starve the kiln of oxygen, causing the iron contained in the clay to turn into a characteristic shade of dark gray. No glazing was used, but some works have a natural whitish glaze caused by ash present within the kiln. Suzu ware products were typically made for everyday use, typically storage pots, water jars,  or ribbed mortars used for grating food.\nSuzu city has a museum dedicated to exhibits of Suzu ware with detailed explanations of its history and production process.\nSuzu Pottery Kiln Sites\nThe  is a designated National Historic Site of Japan. covering 12 separate locations in what are now the cities of Suzu and Noto where the ruins of kilns used to make Suzu ware have been found. The sites are distributed over a 15&nbsp;km east to west, by 20&nbsp;km north to south region, and contain over 40 kilns and were built between the 12th and 15th centuries. Most are surface kilns, and only the latest couple are completely underground. Items produced included pots, bowls, mortars, sutra containers and Buddhist statues, and water containers.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061006150612/http://www.city.suzu.ishikawa.jp/suzuyaki/index.htm Zuzu city official site]\n*"
