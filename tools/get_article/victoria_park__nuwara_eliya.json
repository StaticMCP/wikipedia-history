The park was formally named in 1897 to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. The park was established with the planting of its first tree, an Oak, by a visiting German Princess. The Nanu Oya runs through the park, creating a number of small lakes. A number of rare bird species can be found in the park. At the far end of the park is a small children's playground and miniature ridable railway.\nSee also\n*Victoria Park, Colombo\nReferences"
