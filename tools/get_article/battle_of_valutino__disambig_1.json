The Russians were strongly posted in marshy ground, protected by a small stream, about  east of Smolensk. The French, attacking resolutely, captured the Russian position in the face of considerable physical obstacles.\nPrelude\nNapoleon's hopes of trapping General Barclay's army were dashed when he discovered that the Russian force awaiting the French was a rearguard under General Tuchkov. Barclay's main force of three infantry and one cavalry corps was strung out near Smolensk, trying to get away from the French after the Battle of Smolensk. The rearguard then turned around to fight the French on the Stragan river.\nBattle\nAfter a heavy bombardment, Ney launched an assault against the Russians, crossing the Stragan but failing to capture the crest. Murat's cavalry attacks were bogged down in marshy ground and accomplished nothing. General Junot's force was close to the battlefield and was urged to attack the Russians by Murat. Junot did not engage, and the opportunity for a decisive victory passed.\nWhen Napoleon heard of Junot's failure to attack, they had been friends since their early twenties, he is said to have shouted in frustration “[Junot] will now never earn his Marshal’s Baton!”\nA few hours later, Ney launched the last French attack. General Gudin led the assault and was hit by a cannonball, which removed one leg. He died three days later from infection. The French managed to capture the crest after hard fighting. By that point the majority of Barclay's army had escaped and was heading towards Lubino.\nAftermath\nThe French suffered around 7,000-8,800 casualties. The Russians lost about 6,000. Napoleon was furious after the battle, realizing that another good chance to trap and destroy the Russian army had been lost.\nSee also\n*List of battles of the French invasion of Russia\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
