He spent time in 10 British prisons for his revolutionary activities as the founder of the Drogheda Volunteers during the Irish revolutionary period. Burke played inter-county Gaelic football for Louth, and refereed the 1928 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship final. He was also an athlete.\nEarly life\nThomas Burke was born on 17 February 1894 on Coola Street, Drogheda, County Louth, to Christopher Patrick Burke, secretary of the gas works, and Mary McQuillan. He lived the first 12 years of his life on Coola Street, and was raised in a well-off family. However, things took a turn for the worse with the death of Christopher Burke Snr from Bright's disease on 12 October 1906 at the age of just 44. With the family's source of income gone, his mother moved with him and his five siblings to live with her siblings on Duleek Street.\nBurke was a brother of the revolutionary Christopher Burke, and a cousin of the politician Eamonn Duggan.\nRevolutionary activities\nThomas Burke was the founder of the Drogheda branch of the Irish Volunteers and was a courier for the revolutionary leader Michael Collins. He served much time in British prisons during the Irish revolutionary period, most notably Frongoch internment camp in 1916, where he captained a Louth side in a game of Gaelic football in the prison. When the truce to end the Irish War of Independence was signed in 1921, Burke was interned in the Curragh.\nFootball career\nBurke captained his county in the 1912 All-Ireland Junior Football Championship final against Tipperary. He achieved success at club level with Stars of Drogheda and subsequently Wolfe Tones, who he helped found in the 1920s. After his playing days ended, he took up refereeing and later chaired the county board for several years.\nHonours\nLouth\n*Leinster Junior Football Championship (1):\n1912\nDrogheda Stars\n*Louth Senior Football Championship (2):\n1917, 1919 (As captain)\n*Louth Junior Football Championship (2):\n1912, 1914 (As captain)\nWolfe Tones\n*Louth Senior Football Championship (1):\n1925\nReferee work\nStarting in 1924, Thomas Burke refereed four consecutive Leinster Senior Football Championship (SFC) finals.
