All Iranians would be guaranteed housing and free from hunger as part of the Great Civilization.\nThe Shah predicted the Great Civilization was not in the far future as Iran would reach the level of progress Western Europe had in 1978 by 1990 and Iran would catch up to nations like France and the United Kingdom by the end of the century.  The Shah had prophesied the Great Civilization was destined as Iranians had a natural invincible energy, humanity, a sense of justice and rights, gift for sciences, literature, arts, universal outlook, and a deep-seated patriotism that protects Iranianness in any adversity.\nThe Shah sought to prove Iran's Great Civilization would surpass western nations and avoid the shortcoming of the west. He told westerners Iran would be \"free from the blemishes of your [Western] society\" and in a 1974 Indian newspaper, the Shah stated, \"If we [Eastern nations] protect [our] inheritance … I am confident that we shall avoid the abysses into which material and materialistic civilisations have fallen.\"\nInterview statement\nDuring an interview on the American political news program Meet the Press, interviewer Lawrence E. Spivak asked the Shah, \"Your Majesty, in an interview last year you were reported as saying in 25 years Iran will be the fifth largest world power and that your achievements will be what you can contribute to civilisation. What is it you would like to contribute to civilisation?\" The Shah responded:\n}}\nReferences"
