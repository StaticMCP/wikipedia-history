It is the only independent, paid-for newspaper in London. The newspaper is owned and run by Southwark Newspaper Limited, based in Bermondsey.\nSouthwark News was founded by Dave Clark as the Bermondsey News in 1987, later expanding to the borough and the surrounding area. It was funded for a time by Barry Albin-Dyer. In 2002, Albin-Dyer offered to sell the company to Chris Mullany and Kevin Quinn, and they bought the business.\nSee also\n* List of newspapers in London\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/ Southwark News website]"
