It was reported that Khaled bin Sufyan Al-Hathali (also known as Hudayr, the chief of the Banu Lahyan tribe), considered an attack on Madinah and that he was inciting the people on Nakhla or Uranah to fight Muslims. So Muhammad sent Abdullah ibn Unais to assassinate him. After cutting off Khaled bin Sufyan's head at night, Unais brought it back to Muhammad.\nAttack on the chief of Banu Lahyan\nAfter the migration to Medina Muhammed tried to gather information of possible attacks and acted to crush his enemies. This expedition was executed on a similar news. Abdullah ibn Unais found Khaled bin Sufyan Al-Hathali (also known as Hudayr, the chief of the Banu Lahyan tribe) in the company of his wife. Khaled bin Sufyan trusted him. Then Unais asked to talk to him privately, once, while conversing, Abdullah ibn Unais walked a short distance with ibn Sufyan, and when an opportunity came he struck him with his sword and killed him. After killing ibn Sufyan, he cut off his head and brought that to Muhammad. Muhammad gave him his staff as a reward and said:\nThis will function as a sign of recognition for you and me, on the day of resurrection (Musnad Ahmad 3:496)\nAnother branch of Banu Lihyan planned to take revenge for the killing of their leader, Khaled bin Sufyan.\nIslamic sources\nBiographical literature\nThis event is mentioned in Ibn Hisham's biography of Muhammad.
