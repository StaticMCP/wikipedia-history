One evening, while entertaining a friend, Alice, she admits she has no idea where her rich husband is or what he is doing.  He has not replied to messages for days. Three strangers, two men and a woman stop their car outside, claiming to be lost. Alice goes outside to help them but is shot and killed.  They force themselves into the house while Chloe and Jacob hide. She raises the alarm with their private security company, who watch every room with hidden cameras.  The gang search the house with metal detectors, looking for a secret safe.  Meanwhile, a fourth member sabotages the swing bridge to hold back the police.\nThe woman gang member, Knox, finds Chloe and Jacob, but they overpower her and tie her up until she is later found and released.

He is killed in a gunfight with the police, in which the sheriff and several deputies are also killed. Meanwhile, the gang finds the hidden safe but cannot open it.  Chloe is captured and the gang leader, Heflin, kills the failed safecracker to intimidate her into revealing the combination.  He tells her he has killed her husband as they were both criminals and he had stolen something of great value that is in the safe.\nShe has no idea what the combination is, but stabs Heflin, in the leg. She and Jacob escape again.  Outside, Jacob climbs into a SUV and hits and kills Knox.  The security company play a recording of Chloe’s voice through a speaker to lure Heflin the wrong way.
