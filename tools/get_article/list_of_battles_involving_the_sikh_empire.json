Throughout its history, it fought various adversaries including the Durrani Empire of Afghanistan and the British East India Company.\nBackground\nThe Sikhs first raised their weapons against the Mughal Empire under Guru Hargobind. Shri Guru Hargobind Ji was son of the 5th Shri Guru Arjan Dev Ji who was executed by the Mughal ruler Jahangir. After his father's death, Shri Guru Hargobind Ji added the martial element to Sikhism which was until then a religion mainly focused on Spirituality. But at this point the need for self defence was felt. Hence Shri Guru Hargobind Ji started recruiting an army which he called \"Risaldari\", after training his men in cavalry and Sikh Martial Arts. He adopted Royal symbols like wearing \"kalgidhari turban\" and keeping bodyguards. Along with that he asked his followers to gift him horses and weaponry instead of anything else. So the 6th Guru at one point managed to command 700 cavalry and with this might his Risaldari fought several small scale battles in 1620s and 1630s against Shahjahan's forces and some other warlords in Poadh and Majha.  The tenth and the last Guru, Guru Gobind Singh organized Sikhs into a military sect called Khalsa (means \"pure\"), in 1699, against the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. Before his death in 1708, he sent Banda Singh Bahadur to lead the Sikhs of Punjab. Banda Singh Bahadur through his outstanding leadership skills weakened the Mughal grasp over India. But he was later captured and beheaded in Delhi in 1716, during the reign of Farrukhsiyar.\nThereafter, Sikhs were divided into Misls. In 1738, Nadir Shah of the Afsharid dynasty attacked India and looted Delhi. The Mughals were never able to recover their power in the Punjab. Later, the Punjab was subject to constant invasions of Ahmad Shah Durrani of Afghanistan.\nThe Afghans led numerous campaigns to re-capture Lahore but ultimately had to return to Pashtun territories due to internal strife. After Ahmad Shah's final invasion of the Punjab in 1767, he left Lahore which was re-captured by the Sikhs. For more than three decades, Sikhs consolidated their power in areas of the Punjab, though facing repeated invasion attempts from other Afghan emperors such as Timur Shah Durrani, and Zaman Shah Durrani. The decisive moment came in 1790, when Ranjit Singh of Sukerchakia Misl became Misldar. He started uniting Misls and finally took Lahore in 1799. His coronation on 12 April 1801 marked the beginning of the Sikh Empire, which went on to conquer the whole Punjab, Kangra, parts of Kashmir and briefly, the city of Peshawar.\nList\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\" background:orange;\"|Name of conflict (date)\n! style=\" background:orange;\"|Part of\n! style=\"background:orange; widh:150px;\"|Belligerents\n! style=\"background:orange;width:150px;\"| Opponents\n! style=\"background:orange;width:320px;\"| Outcome\n! style=\"background:orange;width:320px;\"| Details\n|-\n|Katoch–Sikh War(1801)\n|\n|Sikh Empire\n|Kangra State\n|Sikh victory\n|-\n|Battle of Kasur(1807)\n|\n|Sikh Empire\n|Durrani Empire\n|Sikh victory\n|-\n|Battle of Jammu(1808)\n|\n|Sikh Empire\n|Dogra Rajput\n|Sikh victory\n|-\n|Gurkha-Sikh War (1809)\n|\n|Sikh Empire\n|Kingdom of Nepal\n|Sikh victory\n|-\n|Siege of Multan(1810)\n|\n|Sikh Empire\n|Durrani Empire\n|Sikh victory\n|-\n|Battle of Bhimber (1812)\n|\n|Sikh Empire\n|Chibhal\n|Chibhal victory\n|-\n|Battle of Anandpur (1812)\n|\n|Sikh Empire\n|Kahlur\n|Sikh victory\n|-\n|Afghan-Sikh Capture of Kashmir (1812–1813)\n|\n|Sikh EmpireDurrani Empire\n|Kashmir under Ata Muhammad Khan\n|Sikh-Afghan victory\n|-\n|Battle of Hasan Abdal (1813)\n|\n|Sikh Empire\n|Pashtuns led by Wazir Fateh Khan Barakzai\n|Afghan victory\n|-\n|Battle of Attock (1813)\n|\n|Sikh Empire\n|Durrani Empire\n|Sikh victory\n|-\n|Battle of Kashmir (1814)\n|\n|Sikh Empire\n|Pashtuns led by Wazir Fateh Khan Barakzai\n|Afghan victory\n|-\n|Battle of Multan (1818)\n|\n|Sikh Empire\n|Durrani Empire\n|Sikh victory\n|-\n|Battle of Shopian (1819)\n|\n|Sikh Empire\n|Durrani Empire\n|Sikh victory\n| Kashmir is conquered by the Sikhs.\n|-\n|Battle of Gandgarh (1820)\n|\n|Sikh Empire\n|Yousufzai Zamindars\n|Yousufzai\nAfghan victory\n|-\n|Battle of Mangal (1821)\n|\n|Sikh Empire\n|Jaduns and Tanaolis Tribes\n|Sikh victory\n|-\n|Siege of Mankera (1821–1822)\n|\n|Sikh Empire\n|Kingdom of Mankera\n|Sikh victory\n|-\n|Battle of Taragarh (1822)\n|\n|Sikh Empire\n|Afghan tribesmen\n|Sikh victory\n|-\n|Battle of Nowshera (1823)\n|\n|Sikh Empire\n|Coalition of Azim Khan\n|Sikh victory\n|-\n|Battle of Akora Khattak (1826)\n|\n|Sikh Empire\n|Mujahideen\n|Mujahideen victory\n|-\n|Battle of Saidu (1827)\n|\n|Sikh Empire\n|Mujahideen\n|Sikh victory\n|-\n|Battle of Haidru (1828)\n|\n|Sikh Empire\n|Mujahideen\n|Sikh victory\n|-\n|Battle of Balakot (1831)\n|\n|Sikh Empire\n|Mujahideen\n|Sikh victory\n|-\n|Battle of Bannu (1832)\n|\n|Sikh Empire\n|Local Pashtuns\n|Afghan victory\n|-\n|Expedition of Shuja ul-Mulk (1833-1834)\n|\n|Shah Shuja Durrani\n* British Empire\n* East India Company\n* Sikh Empire\n|Emirate of Kabul\n* Principality of Qandahar\n|Barakzai Afghan victory\n|Shah Shuja's expedition fails.\n|-\n|Battle of Peshawar (1834)\n|\n|Sikh Empire\n|Peshawar Sardars\n|Sikh victory\n|Peshawar Sardars deposed from power.\n|-\n|Ladakh War (1834–1835)\n|\n|Sikh Empire\n|Namgyal Dynasty\n|Sikh victory\n|Entirety of Ladakh annexed in Sino-Sikh War\n|-\n|Battle of Ramkani (1835)\n|\n|Sikh Empire\n|Barakzai Dynasty\n|Inconclusive\n|-\n|Standoff at the Khyber Pass (1835)\n|\n|Sikh Empire\n|Emirate of Kabul\n|Inconclusive\n|Withdrawal of Dost Mohammad Khan, no battle fought.\n|-\n|Battle of Panjtar (1836)\n|\n|Sikh Empire\n| Panjtar Pashtuns\n|Sikh victory\n|-\n|Battle of Jamrud (1837)\n|\n|Sikh Empire\n|Emirate of Afghanistan\n|Disputed\n|-\n|1837 Poonch Revolt\n|\n|Sikh Empire\n|Sudhans of Poonch\n|Sikh victory\n|Rebellion suppressed\n|-\n|Baltistan Expedition (1840)\n|\n|Sikh Empire\n|Maqpon Dynasty\n|Sikh victory\n|Baltistan and Skardu annexed to the Sikh Empire\n|-\n|First Anglo-Afghan War1 October 1838 – October 1842\n|\n|\n* East India Company\n* Sikh Empire\n* Shah Shuja\n* Sadozai loyalists\n* Maimana Khanate\n|Emirate of Kabul\n* Principality of Qandahar\n* Barakzai loyalists\n|British coalition defeat\n| Shah Shuja initially restored to the throne successfully, however is deposed and killed in 1842.\n|-\n| Battle of Mudki18 December 1845\n| First Anglo-Sikh war\n| British Empire\n| Sikh Empire\n| British victory\n| Night battle.
