Following its establishment and golden years, the theatre faced a blizzard and was then purchased by a larger company and renovated to make modern updates and improve the overall aesthetic of the building. Since 2000, it has been used as a performance venue for live music and other performing arts events. The now 1,200 seat theatre provides a multitude of opportunities to view shows involving many popular artists, and participate in various events.\nThe Golden Era (1928-1978)\nAfter opening its doors on December 20, 1928, the Midland Theatre served the community of Newark, Ohio, for 50 years primarily as a movie theater, until it closed in 1978.  Prior to its closing, the Midland Theatre was a popular attraction. The theatre hosted small live music events and movies, having around 1000 seats. As it evolved, the Midland began showing some of Hollywood’s most famous movies. The schedule rotated on a 3 day basis, causing high demand for tickets. The Midland Theatre was noted for its unique Spanish architecture, high quality seating, and tall marble pillars. The high quality design of the theatre made for premier movie screenings and attracted crowds of all ages for both movies and live performances, with Saturdays being especially busy. The theatre remained like this for around 50 years, and they now refer to this time as the “Golden Era.”\nThe Empty Years (1978-1992)\nThe Ohio Blizzard of 1978\nEventually, the Golden Era faded, and in 1978, the Ohio Blizzard struck the Midland Theatre and closed it for good. The blizzard significantly damaged the building, causing flooding in the lower levels, leaks in the ceiling, and severe damage to the boilers as well. This natural disaster not only destroyed the Midland Theatre but many other businesses as well. It was estimated that around two thousand homes were destroyed and Ohio suffered more than one billion dollars in damage across the state. The Ohio Blizzard of 1978 was a devastating blow for the Midland Theatre, leading it to sit vacant for 14 years until its turning point in 1992, when David Longaberger and the Longaberger Company purchased the historic theatre.\nRenovations (1992-2000)\nRenovations on the Midland Theatre began in 1992 after the theatre had been closed for the past 14 years. David Longaberger and his company decided to start renovations on the theater to fix poor conditions resulting from flooding and debris, with the goal of bringing back the old prestige of the theatre and creating room for a wider range of performances. After 8 years and 8.5 million dollars, the renovations were completed in 2000, after the passing of David Longaberger the year before. Following its renewal, Longaberger entrusted the property to The Newark Midland Theatre Association, a local volunteer, non-profit organization. It is also supported by the Ohio Arts Council.[https://web.archive.org/web/20100203144843/http://www.oac.state.oh.us/grantsprogs/StaticPages/OAJPGApplicants.pdf Ohio Arts Council > Home]\nAfter the successful renovations, the theatre went beyond movies and intended to attract a variety of performers. The Midland booked Bill Cosby to perform at the reopening and had a sold out crowd for his two performances in 2002. Due to the high cost of renovations, the future of the theatre heavily depended upon filling out crowds and donations made to the endowment.\n| type = performance hall\n| genre =\n| broke_ground =\n| built = 1928\n| opened = December 20, 1928Re-opened 2000\n| renovated = 1992-2000\n| expanded =\n| closed = 1978\n| demolished =\n| owner = The Longaberger Company\n| former_names =\n| seating_type =\n| seating_capacity = approx. 1,800 (originally)\n| website = http://www.midlandtheatre.org/\n}}\nThe Modern Era (2000-Present)\nThe Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nIn recent history, the Midland Theatre faced more struggle through the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic. Many shows and concerts were postponed due to the virus, and the future of the Midland was questionable. However, multiple fundraising efforts and donations were put towards keeping the theatre in service. The theatre received over 200,000 dollars in donations; however, it cost nearly 40,000 dollars a month to keep it up and running. Employees were working long hours with limited pay, and shows were lacking in attendance. While the many donations and fundraisers significantly helped the theatre, many were worried about the years following the Pandemic and said it could take up to 3 years for the theatre to fully recover.\nReopening\nThe theatre has since been reopened and offers a variety of shows and performances, and also includes opportunities for gatherings and events. Films and other performances attract a variety of ages and demographics, and disability accessible features can now be found throughout the updated theatre. A wide range of performances are scheduled, including cabaret series, live interactions with performers, replays of well-known shows and cartoons, ballets, live bands, and more. Recently, many concerts have been held in the Midland Theatre with notable performances from Toto, Kansas, and Rick Springfield. Concerts have been held consistently at the theatre with a performance or two each month, including all genres of music.\nAs for ticketing and shows, the Midland Theatre puts on performances that range in ticket prices. Tickets usually come with a purchasing fee and can be bought online, in-person at their box office, or over the phone. The theatre accepts credit and debit, along with cash, however, no written checks are accepted.\nOther Facts\nArt\nThe Midland Theatre is also home to many pieces of art and history. Prior to its shut down after the Ohio Blizzard of 1978, the Midland housed a 1188 pipe historic organ that weighed around 1000 pounds. The organ took up a lot of space in the theatre, as it was 7.5 feet in length, 4.5 feet deep, and stood 4.5 feet tall. In the 1960s, this organ was removed from the theatre after being bought by “Organ Buff McKeon” via a bid. As of more recent changes, the Midland is now accompanied by a statue of the famous Mark Twain, which sits outside the theater walls. He can be seen sitting on a bench, one of his most famous pieces, Huckleberry Finn, perched on his lap. The statue attracts many tourists and people who pass by enjoy taking pictures and admiring the art.\nSeparate Events\nThe Midland Theatre not only puts on shows and performances, but they also host other events. While not a popular occurrence, the murder trial of Zanesville, Ohio’s Delaney D. Daniels, and Heath, Ohio’s Brianna K. Lohr was held at the Midland, in February 2021. The two suspects faced multiple counts of unclassified felonies, varying in degree, for the murder of Matthew P. Helman in August of 2019.\nIn the past, Midland has also provided opportunities to be a part of shows and performances that take place within its walls. The Central Ohio Youth Ballet program has performed its version of \"The Nutcracker,\" at the Midland Theatre since 2002. Over 40 aspiring young ballet students work tirelessly to craft new versions of the show, each getting their moment to shine onstage. Through this experience, young ballerinas say they are able to make new friends and make memories together, and are given opportunities to go on and dance for companies and schools around the world.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.midlandtheatre.org/ Official website]"
