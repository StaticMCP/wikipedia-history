Partridge was born in Independence, Missouri, and was less than a year old when the Latter-day Saints were driven out of that place. The family moved to Clay County, Missouri, then Caldwell County, Missouri, and then to Nauvoo, Illinois, where Partridge's father died when young Edward was about seven.\nPartridge arrived in Utah in 1848 and then was called on a mission to Hawaii in 1854, where he remained until 1857. In 1858, Partridge married Sarah Lucretia Clayton, a daughter of William Clayton. He later moved to Farmington, Utah, where he ran Amasa M. Lyman's (the husband of one of his sister's) farm.\nIn 1864, Partridge moved to Fillmore, Utah, where he was called to serve as bishop in the Church. In 1877, he became a counselor to Ira N. Hinckley in the presidency of the Millard Stake which was headquartered in Fillmore. From 1882 to 1885, Partridge served as president of the Hawaiian Mission of the church.\nPartridge then moved to Provo so his children could study at Brigham Young Academy. He served as a counselor to Abraham O. Smoot in the Utah Stake Presidency from 1892 to 1895 and then served as president of the Utah Stake from 1895 until his own death five years later.\nPartridge had married Elizabeth Buxton as a second wife in 1862. He had a total of 17 children, only 12 of whom outlived him.\nReferences\n*Andrew Jenson. Latter-day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia. Vol. 1, p.&nbsp;488.\nExternal links\n*"
