It contains an index to place, peoples, historical and military events and explorers.  Covers the span from 3000 BC to ~1970 (Rhodesia, not Zimbabwe; Pakistan, not Bangladesh; North and South Vietnam)\nCappelens historiske atlas\nIn 1962, the Norwegian publishing house Cappelen issued an historical atlas in conjunction with the series Menneskenes liv og historie, popularly known as ''Grimberg's world history. The atlas became the 22nd and last volume in the series. In addition to 108 maps, it contained a registry of state leaders. (Carl Grimberg died in 1941, and posthumous editions of his books in Norway were revised by others.)\nIn 1983, Cappelen issued a new world history series Cappelens verdenshistorie in 21 volumes, again with the historical atlas as a supplement. The 166 maps therein were organized according to the chapters in the volumes. The editor was Anders Røhr, cooperating with the overall editor of Cappelens verdenshistorie, historian Knut Mykland.\nReferences\n;Reviews of the 1962 edition of Cappelens historiske atlas\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*|language=no|type=review}}\n*\n*|language=no|type=review}}\n;Reviews of the 1974 edition of Cappelens historiske atlas\n*\n;Reviews of the 1983 edition of Cappelens historiske atlas''\n*\n*"
