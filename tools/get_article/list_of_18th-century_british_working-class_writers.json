These were, in the main, writers without access to formal education, so they were either autodidacts or had mentors or patrons. This lack of standardized education gave rise to the notion of the \"rough,\" \"untutored,\" \"natural\" artist. There was a vogue among middle- and upper-class readers, particularly later in the eighteenth-century and throughout the Romantic era, for writers with an \"interesting story of genius-in-rags,\" for \"the Unschooled Sons\" — and daughters — \"of Genius.\"\nWriters\n([https://archive.org/details/musesofresistanc0000land/page/n5/mode/2up Open Access] at Internet Archive)\n*Thomas Blacklock (1721—1791)\n*Robert Bloomfield (1766—1823)\n*William Brimble (fl. 1765)\n*Michael Bruce (1746–1767)\n*John Frederick Bryant (1753-91)\n*Robert Burns (1759-96)\n*George Campbell (c. 1761-1818)\n*Ann Candler (1740—1814): \"the Suffolk cottager\"\n*Margaret Catchpole (1762–1819), convict chronicler deported to Australia\n*Thomas Chatterton (1752—1770)\n*Edward Chicken (1698–1746): \"the Mayor of White Cross\"\n*Mary Collier (c. 1688 – 1762): \"the washerwoman of Petersfield\"\n*Mary Davys (1674?–1732)\n*Robert Dodsley (1703–1764)\n*Stephen Duck (c. 1705 – 1756): \"the Thresher poet\"\n*N.
