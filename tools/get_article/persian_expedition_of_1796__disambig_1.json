Empress Catherine the Great of Russia () took advantage of the disorder to consolidate her control over the weak polities of the Caucasus, which was, for swaths of it, an integral Persian domain. The kingdom of Georgia, a subject of the Persians for many centuries, became a Russian protectorate in 1783, when King Erekle II signed the Treaty of Georgievsk, whereby the Empress promised to defend him in the case of Iranian attack. The shamkhals of Tarki followed this lead and accepted Russian protection three years later.\nWith the enthronement of Agha Mohammad Khan as Shah of Persia in 1794 the political climate changed. He put an end to the period of dynastic strife and proceeded to re-strengthen the Persian hold on the Caucasus by re-garrisoning the Iranian territories and cities in the area of modern-day Dagestan, Azerbaijan, and Armenia, as well as ravaging and recapturing Georgia and reducing its capital Tbilisi to a pile of ashes in 1795. Belatedly, the Empress Catherine determined to mount a punitive expedition against the Shah. The ultimate goal for the Russian government involved toppling the anti-Russian Shah and replacing him with his half-brother, namely Morteza Qoli Khan, who had defected to Russia, and was therefore pro-Russian.\nIn the Early spring of 1796, he sent Alexander and Davit Batonishvili to Ganja with an army assembled by name to punish Javad Khan. from the south. The army of Ibraim-Khan Karabagheli also went to Ganja. Javad Khan was locked in prison. Georgians severely defeated his troops and besieged the city. Then Erekle himself, Giorgi and Ioane Batonishvili, came to Ganja with new troops and assault vehicles. Intimidated by the revenge of the Georgians, Javad Khan asked for peace and sent the key to the city. Georgians entered Ganja. Erekle did not personally accept the sword tied around his neck and paid fifteen thousand manats as an annual tribute.\nAlthough it was widely expected that a 50,000-strong Russian corps would be led by a seasoned general (Gudovich), the Empress followed the advice of her lover, Prince Platon Zubov, and entrusted the command to Zubov's youthful brother, Count Valerian Zubov. The Russian troops set out from Kizlyar in April 1796 and stormed the key fortress of Derbent on 10 May. The Russian court poet Derzhavin glorified this event in a famous ode; he would later comment bitterly on Valerian Zubov's inglorious return from the expedition in another remarkable poem.\nBy mid-June Zubov's troops had overrun—without any resistance—most of the territory of modern-day Azerbaijan, including three principal cities—Baku, Shemakha and Ganja. By November they were stationed at the confluence of the Araks and Kura Rivers, poised to attack mainland Iran.\n]]\nIn that month the Empress of Russia died. Her successor, the Emperor Paul, who detested the Zubovs and had other plans for the army, ordered the withdrawal of all Russian troops from the region. This reversal aroused the frustration and enmity of the powerful Zubovs and other officers who took part in the campaign: many of them would join the conspiracy which arranged Paul's assassination five years later.\nSee also\nBattle of Derbent (1796)\nReferences\nBibliography\n*Gen.
