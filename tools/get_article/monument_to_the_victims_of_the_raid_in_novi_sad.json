The bronze composition \"The Family\", 4 meters tall, dedicated to the victims of the Second World War was erected at that place.\nCreation of the monument\nThe monument is the work of sculptor Jovan Soldatović and was built in 1971. In 1992, the monument was completed with another 78 bronze plates made by the same sculptor. Four plaques (three with text in Serbian and one in Hebrew) describe the event, and 66 plaques contain the names of the murdered persons. Between the plates with the texts are rhythmically arranged plates decorated with the symbols of the Star of David (4 plates), the cross (2) and the eye (1). Below the monument are plaques with texts in Serbian, Hungarian, Slovak and Hebrew.\nThe plates had been removed but were restored in 2004.\nGallery\nFile:Porodica.JPG\nFile: Spomenik žrtvama racije, Novi Sad 02.jpg\nFile: Spomenik žrtvama racije, Novi Sad 01.jpg\nFile: Spomenik na keju 1.jpg\nFile: Suncani kej.jpg\nFile: Spomenik žrtvama racije u Novom Sadu.jpg\nReferences"
