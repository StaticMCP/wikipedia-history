He was educated in England at Marlborough College, before matriculating to Trinity College, Cambridge. After graduating from Cambridge, he joined the Indian Civil Service in June 1905. Ward held a number of positions within the civil service with the Indian Finance Department, holding the position of accountant-general for the Central Provinces and Berar by April 1926. While in India, he made two appearances in first-class cricket for the Europeans cricket team in September 1910, against the Parsees and the Hindus. He scored 7 runs in his two matches, in addition to taking 2 wickets. Ward later returned to the United Kingdom, where he died in Wales at Cardigan in July 1959. His uncle, Edward Wolstenholme Ward, was also a first-class cricketer.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
