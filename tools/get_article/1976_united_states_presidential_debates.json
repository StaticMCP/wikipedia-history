Three presidential debates were held between Republican nominee Gerald Ford and Democratic nominee Jimmy Carter. One vice presidential debate was held between their respective vice presidential running mates, Bob Dole and Walter Mondale. In each of the debates, the candidates received questions in turn with three minutes to answer and a 60-second rebuttal.\nParticipant selection\nIn 1976 only the two candidates from the major political parties, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, were invited. As a result, only Bob Dole and Walter Mondale met the criteria for the vice presidential debate.\nDebate schedule\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-†\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE\" colspan=\"16\"| 1976 United States presidential election debates\n|-\n!style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"|&nbsp; || Date and time || Host || Location|| Moderator || scope=\"col\" colspan=\"10\"| Participants\n|-\n!colspan=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\" |Key: Participant &nbsp;\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em; background: #FF3333;\"|\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em; background: #34AAE0;\"|\n|-\n!
