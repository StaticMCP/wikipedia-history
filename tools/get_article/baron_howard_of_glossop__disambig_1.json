It was created in 1869 for the Liberal politician Lord Edward Howard, the second son of Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 13th Duke of Norfolk. His grandson, the third Baron (who succeeded his father), married Mona Stapleton, 11th Baroness Beaumont. Their eldest son, Miles, succeeded his mother in the barony of Beaumont in 1971 and his father in the barony of Howard of Glossop in 1972. In 1975 he also succeeded in the dukedom of Norfolk on the death of his father's second cousin, Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk. The two baronies are now subsidiary titles of the dukedom of Norfolk.
