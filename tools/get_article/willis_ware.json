He was also a  pioneer of privacy rights, social critic of technology policy, and a founder in the field of computer security.\nBiography\nAs an undergraduate, Ware read electrical engineering at the Moore School of the University of Pennsylvania. He completed his master's degree in the same subject at MIT, in 1942.\nDuring World War II, Ware worked for the Hazeltine Corporation (1942–1946) on classified military projects. After the war (1946–1951), he joined the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton to work with John von Neumann on building an early computer.  After completing his PhD there, he moved to North American Aviation (1951–1952), helped to move the aviation industry from punch-card machines to early computers, and in 1952 began teaching a class in computing at the UCLA Extension Division; it continued for 12 years. In 1952 he joined the RAND Corporation, where he stayed until 1992. He was an early design engineer on the RAND JOHNNIAC computer.\nIn 1961, he was the founding president of the American Federation of Information Processing Societies, an early technical computing society. Ware predicted that increased reliance on computers would create new privacy issues, and in 1972 he chaired the Department of Health, Education and Welfare's Special Advisory Committee on Automated Personal Data Systems, which developed policy recommendations including the Code of Fair Information Practice that significantly influenced the Privacy Act of 1974.  He continued to study and write about privacy for many years.\nWare influenced many aspects of computing including the initiation and direction of one of the first computing courses, at UCLA and authored some of the first textbooks in the field of computer security. In addition, he chaired several influential studies, including one in 1967 that produced a groundbreaking and transformational report to the Defense Science Board for ARPA (now DARPA) that was known thereafter as \"the Ware report\". The European Union's Data Protection Directive was strongly influenced by his research.\nWare died at his home in Santa Monica, California in 2013.\nProfessional activities\nWare was an active and influential member of many industry organizations including:\n*Chair of the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE) Group on Computers (1958 - 1959)\n*Founding President of the American Federation of Information Processing Societies (1961)\n*Chair of the Advisory Committee on Automated Personal Data Systems for the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (now [https://www.hhs.gov HHS]) (1972)\n*Vice Chair of the IFIP TC 11 (1985-1994)\n*Founding Chair of the Information System and Privacy Advisory Board (1987 - 1998)\n*US Air Force Scientific Advisory Board\n*NSA Scientific Advisory Board\n*Member of the Electronic Privacy Information Center(EPIC) Advisory Board\n*Member of the National Academy of Engineering\nAwards and honors\n;Fellowships\n*National Fellow of Tau Beta Pi (1941-1942)\n*Fellow of the AAAS\n*Fellow of the IEEE\n*Fellow of the IRE (1962)\n*Fellow of the ACM (1994)\n;Awards\n*Achievement Award, Los Angeles Chapter, IRE (1957)\n*Distinguished Service Award, AMPS (1963)\n*Computer Sciences Man of the Year, Data Processing Management Association (1975)\n*USAF Exceptional Civilian Service Medal (1979)\n*IEEE Centennial Medal (1984)\n*Distinguished Service Award, AMPS (1986)\n*National Computer System Security Award (1989)\n*IEEE Computer Pioneer Award (1993)\n*[https://spaf.cerias.purdue.edu/ncssa.html NIST/NSA National Computer System Security Award] (1989)\n*[http://www.ifiptc11.org/index.php?id=394 IFIP Kristian Beckman Award] (1999)\n*Lifetime Achievement Award from the Electronic Privacy Information Center (2012)\n*Inductee into the Cyber Security Hall of Fame (2013)\nPublications\nWare authored over 70 publications over the course of his professional career.\n* RAND and the Information Evolution: A History in Essays and Vignettes - 2008\n* Security in Computing - 2002 (foreword).\n* The Cyber-Posture of the National Information Infrastructure - 1998\n* New Vistas on Info-Systems Security - 1997\n* Privacy and Security Policy Choices in a National Information Infrastructure Environment - 1996\n* A Retrospective on the Criteria Movement - 1995\n* Policy Considerations for Data Networks - 1994\n* Privacy Dimensions of Medical Record Keeping - 1994\n* Statement on Escrowed Key Proposals Presented to the Subcommittee on Technology, Environment, and Aviation, U.S. House of Representatives - 1994\n* Cyberspace security and safety - 1993\n* The new faces of privacy - 1993\n* Perspectives on trusted computer systems - 1988\n* Survivability Issues and USAFE Policy - 1988\n* Computer security policy issues: from past toward the future - 1987\n* A Perspective on the USAFE Collocated Operating Base System - 1986\n* Emerging privacy issues - 1985\n* Technological perspectives for air base communications - 1985\n* Base communications issues for the 1980s - 1984\n* Information and communications protection - 1984\n* Information systems : the challenge of the future for the Air Force Communications Command - 1984\n* Information Systems, Security, and Privacy - 1983\n* Perspectives on Oversight Management of Software Development Projects - 1983\n* Avionics software: where are we?
