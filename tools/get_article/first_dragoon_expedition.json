Painting by George Catlin who accompanied the expedition.]]\nThe First Dragoon Expedition of 1834 (also known as the Dodge-Leavenworth Expedition) was an exploratory mission of the United States Army into the southwestern Great Plains of the United States.  It was the first official contact between the American government and the Southern Plains Indians.\nHistory\nThe United States Dragoon Regiment left Fort Gibson, Indian territory, on 20 June 1834, under the command of General Henry Leavenworth. In addition to the troops, there were 30 Cherokee, Delaware, Osage, and  Seneca tribesmen who served as guides. The expedition entered the Cross Timbers region on July 10. The difficult terrain of the Cross Timbers region, together with summer heat, sickness, and death slowed the progress of the expedition; one hundred fifty of the five hundred men died on the march. The expedition stopped at Camp Leavenworth, where General Leavenworth, sick and injured from a buffalo hunt, sent the troops onward under the command of Colonel Henry Dodge. On July 16, 1834, the expedition left 75 sick men, including American traveling artist George Catlin, at Camp Comanche; Colonel Dodge and the rest of his men continued onward. General Leavenworth died on July 21, 1834.\nOn July 21, 1834, Colonel Dodge and the remaining men reached a village of Wichita Indians at Devils Canyon. One of the Wichita men was the father of a woman travelling with the expedition. The reunion resulted in easing Dodge's negotiations with the tribe on the next day, during which Dodge invited the tribe to send representatives to Washington, D. C. He also won the release of a white boy whom the Wichitas had captured during the previous Spring.\nDodge also met with some Kiowas, who had arrived with some Comanches. Another woman traveling with the Leavenworth-Dodge group was a Kiowa, who had been kidnapped by Osages in 1833. Dodge returned her to her tribe, winning their friendship. He urged the three tribes to avoid attacking white and Eastern Indian people. A few days later, the main body of the expedition left for Fort Gibson which they reached on August 15, 1834.\nthe commander of the United States Regiment of Dragoons]]\nsketch of Colonel Henry Dodge, commander of the United States Mounted Rangers, 1833.]]\nwas second in command of the Dragoons and later died in the Mexican–American War]]\nthe youngest son of Daniel Boone was on the expedition and served with Henry Dodge in the War of 1812]]\nwas in command of Dragoon company F who later became the President of the Confederate States of America.]]\nNotable expedition members\nIn addition to Dodge, Leavenworth and Catlin, notable members of the expedition included:\n*Stephen W.
