The Agency's service area covers 242 square miles and approximately 700,000 people.\nIEUA's supplemental water comes from both imported water and recycled water.\nThe wastewater treatment facility consists of domestic and industrial disposal systems and energy recovery and production facilities. The agency is also a biosolids and fertilizer treatment provider and remains a leader in protecting the quality of the area's groundwater.\nHistory\nIEUA was formed in 1950 as the Chino Basin Municipal Water District (CBMWD) and joined MWD in the same year. In 1998 CBMWD changed its name to the Inland Empire Utilities Agency (IEUA). The name change was meant to reflect changes in the District's mission.\nIn 2002 IEUA made history by becoming the first public agency to obtain a Platinum LEED rating by the USGBC\nChino Creek Wetlands and Educational Park\nIn 2008 the Chino Creek Wetlands and Educational Park opened to the public. The park is located at the IEUA headquarters adjacent to the LEED Platinum buildings. Among many other things, the park features:\n* 1.7 miles of trails\n* 22 acres of habitat\n* 6 connecting wetland ponds used for tertiary treatment of grey water before it is sent out to the Chino Creek\n* One million gallons of recycled water flowing through its wetlands each day\n* Wildlife monitoring stations\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111009021017/http://www.ieua.org/home/about.html Official Inland Empire Utilities Agency website]\n*[http://www.environmental-expert.com/Files%5C5306%5Carticles%5C13484%5C438.pdf Environmental-expert.com: \"How a LEED Platinum Building is Cleaning up Inland Empire Runoff\"] —  by Whitman et al (Water Environment Foundation).\n*[http://www.coastalconference.org/h20_2007/pdf_07/2007-10-24-Wednesday/Session_4B-Stream_Restoration/Slater-IEUA's_Chino_Creek_Wetlands_Educational_Park.pdf  CoastalConference.org: \"IEUA Chino Creek Wetlands Educations Park\"] — by Cole Slater, Stephen Lyon and Judi Miller."
