However, Albania was a \"wonderful country\" during the Cold War. Turning over with the Soviet Union also blocked the West.\nFor this reason, Albania, which withdrew from the Warsaw Pact, became the only European country that simultaneously opposed the two major camps of the United States and the Soviet Union. For the Soviet Union, Albania did not fall to the West after withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact, did not change the Cold War pattern, and the invasion had little strategic significance.\nSecondly, Albania is well aware of the dangers of simultaneously fighting the two major camps of the United States and the Soviet Union. Therefore, Albania, which has a territory of only 28,748 square kilometers, built hundreds of thousands of bunkers and became the \"country of bunkers\", and it also hoarded enough weapons to fight a world war.\nAccording to the estimates of the Soviet military, it would take 400,000 troops, thousands of tanks, and about two and a half years to occupy Albania so prepared. After paying such a huge price, the Soviet Union could only get a small barren country that had little meaning to the Cold War.\nIt can be said that the invasion of Albania was a loss-making business for the Soviet Union that might not even be earned by shouting, without any strategic significance. Albania is a country with little value for invasion, and the Soviet Union has left it to its withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact.\nReferences\ninf.news/en/history/adc33a626cc2f299f33b72252f6173db.html"
