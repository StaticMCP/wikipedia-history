The Vision is, \"Transforming Airmen into Air Commandos who possess the specialized skills and warrior ethos to fight and win anytime, anywhere.\"\"Air Force Special Operations Home Page - Units - Air Force Special Operations Air Warfare Center\"\nHistory and overview\nThe Special Operations Air Warfare Center was originally formed at Hurlburt Field in 1962 to train and deploy some of the first special operations airmen, known as Air Commandos, in irregular warfare. The first graduates eventually took on advisory and combat roles assisting the Army of the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The program was dissolved after the war due to budget cuts.\nThe Air Force Special Operations Air Warfare Center was activated on 11 February 2013 with the deactivation of the Air Force Special Operations Training Center (AFSOTC). As a result, the major units that fall under the center include: U.S. Air Force Special Operations School, 371st Special Operations Combat Training Squadron, 19th Special Operations Squadron, 551st Special Operations Squadron from Cannon Air Force Base, N.M., 18th Flight Test Squadron, 6th Special Operations Squadron and the 745th Special Operations Squadron from Eglin AFB, FL, which were formerly assigned to AFSOTC.\"AFSOC Stands up Air Warfare Center.\" - By Raquel Sanchez Air Force Special Operations Command Public Affairs. - AFSOC Homepage - News. 12 February 2013.\nThe center was inactivated on  17 May 2017 and its functions were assumed by the 492d Special Operations Wing.\nLeadership\nBrigadier General Jon Weeks, took command of the newly created Air Force Special Operations Air Warfare Center at a ceremony on Duke Field, Florida on 11 February 2013.\"Reservist takes reins of new special ops center\" - By Tech.
