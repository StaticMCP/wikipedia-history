Located in the west of the town, on the pier, it illustrates the social history and heritage of the Clew Bay area and Westport. Topics covered include Croagh Patrick, Grace O'Malley, John MacBride, Maud Gonne, the Irish War of Independence, the 1798 Rebellion and schooling in the area.\nThe museum is located in a 19th-century stone building, once used for holding live pigs prior to transport, donated by the Harbour Board. It was founded by Westport Historical Society in 1987. Tour guides describe it as \"a chaotic but engaging jumble\" and \"a veritable garage sale of history.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
