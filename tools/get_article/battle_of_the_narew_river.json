The battle ended with a Polish victory\nThe Battle\nIn the autumn of 1282, a combined force of Lithuanians and Yotvingians, claimed to number 14,000 armed men, invaded Lubelszczyzna. The invading forces were divided into three divisions. After ravaging the Lublin region, they retreated with large booty. While retreating, the Lithuanian-Yotvingian army clashed with the pursuing Polish army led by Leszek the Black at an unknown location between Narew and Niemen. The battle is believed to have occurred:\n* near Brańsk, on the rivers Nurek and Branka,\n* on the Narew River near Długosiodło,\n* near Wasilkow on the Supraśl River,\n* on the fields of the villages Łopiennik and Krzywe,\n* on the estuary of the Czarna Hańcza River to the Niemen River, near the village of Jatwieź Duża.\nA Polish army of 6,000 men split the opposing forces and, after the Lithuanians had fled, crushed the army of the Yotvingians. After the victory, the Polish army went on to plunder the Bialystok Highlands. It is believed that the military strength of the Yotvingians was shattered during this battle, and the invasion in 1283 was the last raiding attack of this fierce tribe on Poland.\nCitations\nNotes\nSources\n*\n*\n* |title=Rocznica bitwy nad Narwią i zagłada Jaćwingów.
