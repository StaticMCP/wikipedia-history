He would later take the surname of his mother's second husband, Albert Clayton.\nAged 21, he moved to London, worked as a window display manager, and became Clayton Howard. He worked in the evenings with his friend Maxine Grew as a dance duo – he designed the costumes, and she made them.\nIn the early 1960s, he trained with Max Factor as a make-up artist, and went on to have clients including Lauren Bacall, Princess Anne, Princess Margaret and Princess Michael of Kent.\nIn November 1980, Howard did the make-up for Lady Diana Spencer (and John Frieda did her hair) for the official portrait that was to appear alongside news of her engagement to Prince Charles. He went on to mentor Diana in how to use make-up, and in 1992 published Look Like a Princess.\nReferences"
