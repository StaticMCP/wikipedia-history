The Democratic ticket of the former U.S. senator from New Hampshire Franklin Pierce and the senior U.S. senator from Alabama William R. King defeated the Whig ticket of the major general Winfield Scott and the U.S. secretary of the navy William A. Graham. The Free Soil ticket of the senior U.S. senator from New Hampshire John P. Hale and the former U.S. representative from Indiana's 4th congressional district George W. Julian finished a distant third. Pierce defeated Scott in the national election with 254 electoral votes.\nGeneral election\nSummary\nIndiana chose 13 electors on a statewide general ticket. Nineteenth-century election laws required voters to vote directly for members of the Electoral College rather than for president. This sometimes resulted in small differences in the number of votes cast for electors pledged to the same presidential candidate, if some voters did not vote for all the electors nominated by a party. This table reflects the statewide popular vote as calculated by Michael J. Dubin.\n}}\n3.11}}\n}}\n1.59}}\n}}\n1.51}}\n}}\nStatistics\nThis was the last time Porter County voted for a Democratic presidential candidate until Bill Clinton won a plurality in 1996.\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Indiana\nNotes\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
