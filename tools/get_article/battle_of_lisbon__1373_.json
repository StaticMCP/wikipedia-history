The victory contributed decisively to Castile's victory in the Second Ferdinand War and it resulted in the capture and sack of the city.\nBackground\nShortly after the end of the First Fernandine War, Ferdinand I of Portugal signed a treaty with John of Gaunt on 10 July 1372 in which they promised mutual aid against the Crown of Castile.\nAfter signing the treaty, the Portuguese monarch ordered the seizure of Castilian ships in their ports, so that the supporters of Peter I were able to invade Galicia. Henry II of Castile reacted quickly and decided to invade Portugal. He placed his base of operations in Zamora, and in December 1372 he invaded it. While the land assault was successful, Ambrosio Boccanegra sailed with a fleet of 12 galleys from Seville to Lisbon.\nThe battle\nOn 7 March 1373, Ambrosio Boccanegra approached Lisbon. After crossing the Mar da Palha, Boccanegra attacked a Portuguese fleet of more than 6 galleys and 15 naos under the command of Admiral Lancelot Pessanha, which was in the port of Lisbon, and which left the port to attack the Castilian fleet, knowing that it was approaching, in order to destroy it and keep the port open for the expected English reinforcements.\nTheir efforts, however, were in vain, because the Portuguese admiral did not act firmly and hesitated in his actions. That is why the fleet of Castile under the command of a firm and resolute Boccanegra was able to capture 2 of the galleys and most of the Portuguese ships during the battle and thus decide the naval battle in their favor. Castile occupied the city after the battle.\nAftermath\nAdmiral Pessanha lost his post due to his performance in the battle and was replaced by Juan Alfonso Tello, while Ferdinand I of Portugal was forced to ask for peace from Henry II, since no English reinforcements had arrived due to the aftermath of the catastrophe at La Rochelle and he could no longer hope for one with the Castilian fleet in front of the port.\nHe was therefore forced to sign the Treaty of Santarém with Henry II on 19 March 1373. This marked the end of the Second Ferdinand War and also the last service of Ambrosio Boccanegra to King Henry II. After this, he retired and died at home the same year. His successor was Fernando Sánchez de Tovar.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
