The latter led a massive naval force in a campaign against the Anam, who were thereby completely routed, with their general slain in a duel with Ogwu Aje.\nAftermath\nFollowing the war, the Aboh warriors took as a trophy, two large canoes which they nicknamed “Anam”, and were reported as the largest canoes they had ever seen in Aboh. The trophies were still seen in the Aboh creek by the late 1920s.\nFor the Anam, a treaty was reached following their crushing defeat, and it was therefore after this battle that the Anam settlements of Ifite-Anam, Umuezeanam, and Ezi-Anam were moved further inland for safety.\nReferences\nSources\n}}"
