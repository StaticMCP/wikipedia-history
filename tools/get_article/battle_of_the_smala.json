The 500 French cavalrymen surprised the camp defenders, who fired a single volley before scattering. More than 3000 of al-Qadir's followers out of a camp population of 30,000 were captured, as were many of his possessions, including his war chest and a library valued at £5000. Three days later, another 2500 followers were captured.\nAl-Qadir fled to Morocco later that year, triggering French pressure on Morocco and the advent of the Franco-Moroccan War in 1844. He was eventually captured in 1847, ending major Algerian resistance to the French colonial occupation.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=xXYoAAAAYAAJ&q=Aumale&pg=PA366 The Tricolor on the Atlas]\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=iAgZAAAAYAAJ&dq=Taguin%20Algeria&pg=PA221 The life of Abdel Kader]"
