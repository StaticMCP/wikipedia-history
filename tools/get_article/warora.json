During the British Raj, the town was part of the Central Provinces and was a coal-mining center. The work place of famous social worker Baba Amte, \"Anandwan\" is situated in Warora.\nHistory\nThe story of Tata Steel is a century old and Sir Jamsetji Tata had idea of starting a steel plant near Warora region. At the age of forty-three in 1882, Jamsetji read a report by a German geologist, Ritter von Schwartz, that the best situated deposits of iron ore were in Chandrapur district in the Central provinces, not far from Nagpur where he worked. They area named was Lohara, after the iron ore deposits nearby. In the vicinity, Warora had deposits of coal. Jamsetji is believed to have visited Lohara himself and obtained specimens of Warora coal for testing. He took a consignment of coal with him and had it tested in Germany. The coal was found unsuitable. The mining terms offered by the government were too restrictive, and Jamsetji gave up the project. But the idea of giving India a steel plant abided with him.\nGeography\nWarora is located at .
