Appointed by President Richard Nixon on May 27, 1969, he presented his credentials to Governor-General Sir Richard Edmonds Luyt on October 15, 1969, in the capital city of Georgetown.  After Guyana declared itself a republic in 1970,  Ambassador King had to be reaccredited as ambassador, this time presenting his credentials to the republic's new president, Sir Edward Victor Luckhoo on February 23, 1970.  He represented the United States and its interests in this former British colony until March 8, 1974, when he left the post.  A longtime resident of Maine, he retired from the foreign service after his ambassadorship came to an end. He died on January 20, 1988.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.politicalgraveyard.com/bio/king8.html The Political Graveyard listing]\n*[http://georgetown.usembassy.gov/guyana/index.html U.S. Embassy in Guyana]\n*[https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/po/com/10832.htm List of U.S. Ambassadors to Guyana]"
