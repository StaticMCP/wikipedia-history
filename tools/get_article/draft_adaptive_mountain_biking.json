Unlike conventional mountain biking, the discipline involves specialized bikes, inclusive trail designs and adaptive programs to allow riders to enjoy off-road trails safely. Adaptive mountain biking has organized events, competitions, and dedicated trails worldwide, and is recognized as a distinct discipline within disability sports.\nSpecially designed trails called \"adaptive trails\" have been developed in many regions to better accommodate disabled riders. Organisations, such as the International Mountain Bicycling Association (IMBA) and AusCycling, have published standards to support the creation of safe, accessible and sustainable adaptive trail designs. Many adaptive trails are designed with wider tread, smoother surfaces and gentler gradients so that adaptive cycles and less experienced upright riders can use them. As a result, these trails commonly double as beginner or family-friendly mountain bike routes.\nHistory\nThe evolution of adaptive MTB has progressed through several milestones:\n* The world's first cited trail designed for adaptive mountain biking is the Jetton Park's Trail Loop, that was built in North Carolina, USA in 2007.\n* In 2009, a mountain biking club for disabled riders was reported in a piece in The Guardian. By 2020, several mountain bike parks and public land managers had built more trails designed to accommodate adaptive mountain biking. Notable examples include Arklow mountain bike trail in Australia and the Squamish Off-road Cycling Association trails in the United States.\n*In Australia, adaptive cross-country mountain biking (adaptive XC) was included as a racing event in the country's national mountain biking championships in 2017. In the 2024 meet, GWM Mountain Bike National Championships later introduced the adaptive Downhill (adaptive DH) as a competitive discipline.\nEquipment\nThere is a wide range of adaptive mountain bikes. Some are designed to be pedal powered for riders who have full or partial use of their legs. There is also types that have a hand crank alongside a throttle, and others that are fully motor-powered.\nThere is generally three types of adaptive bikes based on its number of wheels.\n1. Three-wheeled\nThere are three-wheeled bikes that can be ridden without the need for a support rider, and can handle a variety of terrain.\nWithin the category of three wheeled bikes, there are different designs, such as:\n* Front-wheel drive: are usually propelled with a hand crank that powers the two front wheels, and  typically have a throttle.\n* Rear-wheel drive: comparatively allows better traction on the uphill climbs than front-wheel types, and are also more maneuverable. But they also tend to be the least affordable type of adaptive mountain bike.\n* Recumbent: Recumbent adaptive bikes, or trikes, are either pedal-powered or hand-powered. They are not ideal for very challenging terrain but are meant for the easier trails.\n2. Two-wheeled\nBucket bikes are basically normal mountain bikes, but are modified or have a dedicated design to incorporate a \"bucket\" seat for a disabled rider to sit, and be strapped in. There also needs to be a support rider or \"spotter\" to pedal the bike, as the adaptive rider can't ride on their own. This design is for adaptive mountain bikers seeking a two-wheeled experience on the trails.\n3. Four-wheeled\nAlso known as Fourcross, they are designed for gravity fed trails, such as downhill or sloped courses. They don't have a motor.\nTrail Design and Accessibility\nTrails that are designed for the purpose of improving accessibility to disabled riders, are commonly called \"accessible trails\".\nThey often have the following key design principles:\n* Wider trails and minimum/wider turning radii to accommodate trikes and quads.\n* Gentler gradients to enable a more gradual climb or descent.\n* Clear sightlines\n* Avoiding muddy and soft sandy surfaces by ensuring effective drainage and having hard compact surfaces\n* Lower number of technical obstacles, such as rock gardens to reduce overall risk of injury.\n* Clear signage and rating systems, like the Adaptive Trail Rating, to give notice of the difficulty of the trail and accessibility for each type of bike.\n*Suitable parking and a trailhead that is easily accessible\nNotable adaptive trails\nA number of locations around the world have constructed trails that are specifically built or modified for adaptive MTB:\nNorth America\n* Jetton Park Trail Loop (North Carolina, USA)\n* West Kootenays (British Columbia, Canada)\n* Wascana Trails (Saskatchewan, Canada)\n* Squamish Off-Road Cycling Association trails (Canada)\nUnited Kingdom & Ireland\n*Old Bob’s (England)\n*Dalby Forest (North Yorkshire)\n*Coed y Brenin (Wales)\nOceania\n*Fox Creek Bike Park (Australia)\n*Rotorua Whakarewarewa loop (New Zealand)\n*West Coast Wilderness Trail (New Zealand)\n*Kiwarrak Mountain Bike Trail (Australia)\n*Arklow Adaptive Trail (Australia)\n*Forrest - Southern Networks (Australia)\nOrganisations and Events\n*Gravity Adaptive Inc. (Australia) -  a non-profit organization that advocates for (aMTB) trail access, provides rider support and education for disabled riders.\n*Adaptive Sports Center (USA) - Hosts the Adaptive Mountain Biking World Championship and the annual Off-Road Handcycling World Championship.\n*Vermont Mountain Bike Association  (USA) - provides adaptive mountain biking opportunities and hosts events for adaptive cyclists.\n*The UNPavement Movement (USA) – An organization that aims \"to document trails for adaptive riders\".\n*Kelly Brush Foundation (USA) - A non-profit that advocate and educates for trails to accommodate the sport. In collaboration with Richmond Mountain Trails and Vermont Mountain Bike Association, it also produced a documentary called \"Best Day Ever\", that tells the story of two adaptive mountain bikers.\n*Kootenay Adaptive Sport Association (Canada) - developed a comprehensive set of standards for safer adaptive trails.\nDocumentaries and films\n* Adaptation\n* Best Day Ever\nSee also\n* Para-cycling\n* Accessibility\n* List of cycleways\nReferences"
