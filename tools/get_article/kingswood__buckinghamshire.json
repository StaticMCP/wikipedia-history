Kingswood is also a civil parish within Aylesbury Vale area. Parish matters are currently administered via a parish meeting. There is an Italian restaurant, Canaletto, which opened in 2013. The Village Hall blew down in the Great Storm of 1987.\nEtymology\nThe hamlet name refers to the nearby Bernwood Forest, an ancient Royal hunting forest.\nDescription\nThe houses within the hamlet form part of a larger community encompassing a further 30 dwellings within adjoining parishes and includes a burial ground, a public house and a Mission Hall at the crossroads built around 1850 and left in trust in 1905 by Henry Grattan Guinness (1835–1910) for the salvation or edification of souls. There is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, Ham Home-cum-Hamgreen Woods.\nHistory\nThe old Roman Akeman Street was the main route to Cirencester, Cheltenham and Bath and the Crooked Billet an important coaching inn / staging post.\nThe original trustees of the Mission Hall were William Kirby, Sydney Hopcroft, James & John Taylor and William Wellings; and adjoining land then owned by Amy Wellings on one side and William Daniels on the other.\nHenry Grattan Guinness established the East London Training Institute for Home and Foreign Missions in Stepney Green in 1873, across the road from the Mission Hall of his friend, Thomas Barnardo and moved to larger premises in Harley House in Bow later in that year. The institute was interdenominational and international, opening its own missions in Congo (1878), Peru (1897), India (1899), Borneo (1948), Nepal (1954), and Irian Jaya (1957). Present day Latin Link descends from the Peru mission.\nRailway\nIn the late 19th century the Brill Tramway had a spur to Kingswood.\n1871-04-01  Wotton to Quainton Road opened [Wotton Tramway]\n1871-08-19  Wood Siding to Wotton opened [Wotton Tramway]\n1871-11-    Brill to Wood Siding opened [Wotton Tramway]\n1871-11-    Wood Siding, Church Siding\n1872-01-    Wotton, Westcott, Waddesdon Road, Quainton Road (Wotton Tramway)\n1872-04-    Brill\n1891-07-01  Verney Junction to Aylesbury started [Metropolitan]\n1892-09-01  Aylesbury to Amersham opened\nThe Metropolitan extended its route north from Baker Street through Harrow and Rickmansworth to Aylesbury and bought out the Aylesbury & Buckingham Railway from Aylesbury via Quainton Road to Verney Junction - and took over the operation of the Wotton Tramway from Quainton Road to Brill.
