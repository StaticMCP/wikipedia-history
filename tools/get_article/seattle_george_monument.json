It was surveyed and deemed \"treatment needed\" by the Smithsonian Institution's \"Save Outdoor Sculpture!\" program in October 1994. The sculpture was designed to resemble the highway shields used by Washington's state highway system.\nThe sculpture rests on a trellis base under the suspended nose of a Boeing 707. Lines from Chief Seattle's farewell speech are etched in the base in English and phonetic Salish.\nSee also\n* 1989 in art\n* List of monuments dedicated to George Washington\nReferences"
