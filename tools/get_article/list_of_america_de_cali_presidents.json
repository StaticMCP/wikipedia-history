According to Hernán, \"the end of 1926 ran when, with my two friends Serafín Fernández and Alvaro Cruz, we decided to create a\" team. \"Serafin was the only one who had access to cash since he managed the box of his father's the coins that we managed to \"collect\" we bought once a fortnight an Argentine sports publication called \"El Gráfico.\" In one of those magazines told the exploits of a team called Racing Club then with Serafin and Alvaro we decided to buy a ball and started playing In a field of the Central Cemetery under the name of Racing, the T-shirts, obviously made with fabrics donated by Serafin, were white with celestial sticks such as those of that Argentine team \". On February 16, 1948, Humberto Salcedo Fernández \"Salcefer\" and Dr. Manuel Correa Valencia, constitute the America in the first professional soccer championship in the country. \"Salcefer\" receives the appointment as first president in the professional era of the team and later it would become the first of the Dimayor.\nThe team began an odyssey of difficult times when it was included in the Clinton List in 1996 under the command of Carlos Puente González. In 2011, America suffers another serious event when it falls in the second division, time when Carlos H. Andrade becomes the new president of the institution, after bad campaigns of the previous directives; It was not until 2013, when Oreste Sangiovanni took the reins of the team in his attempt to not disappear and after 4 years of failed efforts aimed at restructuring for further sanitation, the new América S.A. organization was created.\nSince May 10, 2016, Tulio Gómez became the new president and largest shareholder of América de Cali with 53 percent of the shares, after the era of Oreste Sangiovanni was concluded. Under his mandate, on November 27, 2016, Gómez became one of the architect men in the rise of América de Cali to the first division of Colombian football, after 5 years of remaining in second division.\nOn May 16, 2018, Tulio Gómez announced his retirement as President of the institution after bad management and an irregular campaign in the 2018 Liga Águila, although declared that it would continue being the owner of the team.\nOn May 30, 2018, Ricardo Pérez was announced as the new executive president of the America. The \"Gato\" Pérez would return to the team, after acting as a player between 1994 - 1996 and 1998. After a year of presiding as president of the América and reaching the 14th title in his administration, Ricardo Pérez said goodbye to the presidency on December 16, 2019 obeying \"personal reasons\".\nCurrently, the president of the America is the Colombian former player Mauricio Romero. He's assumed the presidency on December 18, 2019, after Ricardo Pérez left the team.
