The museum is dedicated to the culture of the Philistines, the ancient people who inhabited the maritime part of Israel from the XII century BC. It is the only museum in the world completely dedicated to the Philistine people.\nThe museum has a permanent exhibition showing archaeological finds, as well as temporary exhibitions. Cultural events are held for visitors; in particular, they can try on clothes similar to those worn by the ancient Philistines, and try the dishes of their cuisine.\nIn 1990, the Museum of Philistine Culture became the first museum to open in Ashdod.\nGallery\nFile:תצוגת הקבע עולמם של הפלשתים צילום אבישי פינקלשטיין .jpg\nFile:Museum of Philistine Culture, Ashdod 01.jpg\nFile:Museum of Philistine Culture, Ashdod 04.jpg\nFile:Museum of Philistine Culture, Ashdod 21.jpg\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20141223172808/http://www.phcm.co.il/en Corinne Mamane Museum of Philistine Culture] homepage, archived copy (2014)\n* [http://museums.gov.il/en/museums/pages/ashdod-philistine-culture.aspx/ Museum of Philistine Culture at Museums in Israel – the National Portal], active 2020"
