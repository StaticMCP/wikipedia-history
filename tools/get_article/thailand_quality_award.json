The TQA has a world class technical foundation and awarding process. It is closely modeled after the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (MBNQA) and is an award with a rigorous screening process together with a standardized assessment system employing volunteering elite assessors from the private, public, government, state enterprise, medical, and education sectors.\nHistory and description\nThe Thailand Quality Award (TQA) was first launched in 2002. However, the history of the award started on September 5, 1996, with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Thailand Productivity Institute (FTPI) and the National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA) to study the guidelines for establishing an award.\nThe FTPI has been appointed by the government to be the Thailand Quality Award (TQA) Secretariat Office, also referred to as the National Quality Award Office. It is the main organization in Thailand encouraging the manufacturing and service sectors to adopt the TQA framework as an essential tool to improve their management capability.\nOn March 4, 2004, the TQA was won for the first time by a Thai company, [https://www.thaipaper.com/ Thai Paper Company Limited]. a subsidiary of Siam Cement Group (SCG).\nIn 2013, the lead assessor of the TQA, Bill Voravuth Chengsupanimit, stated \"In Thailand, upon signing an agreement between the Foundation of Thailand Productivity Institute and the National Science and Technology Development Agency, on September 5, 1996, the Thailand Quality Award (TQA) was initiated. The resulting TQA technical and decision-making processes are identical to the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award. Since TQA's inception, only four organizations have scored above 650 points to qualify for the TQA, out of hundreds of applicants. However, more than 50 organizations have achieved the Thailand Quality Class status by scoring more than 350 points.\"\nOn January 16, 2020, the FTPI hosted an event where they covered changes in the TQA for 2020–2021. The FTPI stated that the content of the criteria was revised to suit changing global social and economic conditions as well as to comply with the US MBNQA criteria.\nIt was announced on February 12, 2020, that True Group's Mobile Business Group had won the Thailand Quality Award 2019. This was the first time since 2012 that a Thai organization qualified by passing the rigorous evaluation criteria to receive the award. True Group's Mobile Business Group was also the first Thai telecommunication organization to win the award. However, the Government Housing Bank also achieved the TQA in 2019.\nObjectives\nThe stated objectives of the TQA are:\n# To support the implementation of the National Quality Award guidelines to improve competitiveness\n# To honor the organizations that have achieved global standards\n# To encourage learning and exchange of practices that Excellence\n# To show the international commitment to raise the standard of excellence in management\nThailand Quality Award Recipients\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\"\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"50\" |
