The majority of those buried here had fallen in battles between September and November 1944 in the region south and west of the River Meuse and during the fighting for the Scheldt estuary. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission is responsible for the cemetery.\nOf the fallen personnel buried here, 664 are Commonwealth soldiers (seven of whom are unidentified) and one Dutch grave (of G.M. Stönner of the Princess Irene Brigade).\nIn 1982, an employee of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission was also buried in the cemetery.\nThe graves are arranged in eight sections (numbered 1 to 8), with six or seven rows in each section (A to F or G).\nThe Cross of Sacrifice at the cemetery was designed by Sir Reginald Blomfield.\nIn September 2019 the cemetery was vandalized with graffiti. The damage included letters on the gravestones, a swastika in the chapel and graffiti on the Cross of Sacrifice. There was also the graffiti \"MH17 lie\" in reference to the shooting down of flight MH17.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Country      || colspan=\"2\" |Army|| rowspan=\"2\" | Air Force || colspan=\"3\" | Total\n|-\n!                           known || unknown ||                            known || unknown || total\n|-\n| United Kingdom || 635   || 7|| 13 || 648   || 7        || 648\n|-\n| Australia   ||       ||          ||  5                       ||   5   ||          || 5\n|-\n| Canada              ||   3   ||          ||  1                       ||   4   ||          || 4\n|-\n| Netherlands           ||   1   ||          ||                          ||   1   ||          || 1\n|-\n| Total                  || 639   || 7        || 19                       || 658   || 7        || 658\n|}\nPhotographs\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.4en5mei.nl/oorlogsmonumenten/zoeken/monument-detail/_rp_main_elementId/1_7278 Description of the monument] on the website of the Dutch Nationaal Comité 4 en 5 mei\n*"
