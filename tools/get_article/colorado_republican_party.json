The party's headquarters is located in Greenwood Village, Colorado.\nThe Republican Party was dominant in the state as recently as the mid-2000s, however it has declined over the subsequent decades. After the 2020 elections, Republicans held the smallest amount of political power in the state government since World War II. This decline has been attributed to various factors, including the party moving too far right for the state, changing demographics, mismanaged campaign money, internal party divisions, a better organized Democratic Party, and the unpopularity of Donald Trump in the state.\nThe party fared even poorer in the 2022 elections, in which Democrats swept every statewide office by a double-digit margin, expanded their majority in the state's U.S. House delegation, and further expanded their supermajorities in both chambers of the legislature. Since 2023, the party has faced revenue loss and party infighting, with the party veering further towards the far-right and overall further decline of influence in the state.\nHistory\n2010s\nTed Cruz won all of Colorado's delegates during the 2016 presidential primaries. Colorado's delegation to the 2016 Republican National Convention stagged a walkout as part of the Never Trump movement. However, Ken Buck and other members of the delegation later became Trump supporters after initially opposing him.\nAccording to Frank McNulty, fringe candidates began winning in safe Republican seats in the 2010s. Republicans in Colorado shifted rightward following the election of Trump. From 2018 to 2020, Republicans lost all of their statewide offices, except for the at-large Board of Regents seat held by Heidi Ganahl. Between 1984 and 2016, the Republicans had more registered voters than the Democrats. In 2020, the Republicans lost control of the Regents of the University of Colorado for the first time in 41 years.\nPatrick Neville was elected minority leader in the state house in 2016, which gave him control of the caucus' bank account. Neville renamed the account to Values First Colorado and registered it under his brother Joe Neville. The previous vendor was fired and replaced with Rearden Strategic, which was run by Joe. $207,800 was given to Rearden Strategic from 2017 to 2020, and two other committees managed by Joe, Citizens for Secure Borders IEC and Take Back Colorado, were given $274,200 and $545,000 respectively. Representative Larry Liston stated that it was embarrassing for those who contributed funds and Representative Lois Landgraf was critical of the lack of oversight and not supporting \"appropriate candidates\".\n2020s\nSince Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, elements of the Colorado GOP and its voter base have espoused support for Trump's false claims of election fraud. While top Colorado Republicans have defended Colorado's local elections, they have cast doubt on the validity of the election results in other states or stayed silent on Trump's allegations of fraud. On December 7, 2020, a group of Republicans requested to the Speaker of the House KC Becker that a committee be formed on \"election integrity\" to conduct an audit of the Dominion Voting Systems used in Colorado in spite of no evidence of issues. The request was rejected, with Becker criticizing it as \"a dangerous stunt\" and a promotion of \"debunked conspiracy theories.\"\nAlso in December, Colorado congressional Republicans supported a lawsuit aimed to overturn the election results. On January 6, 2021, congressional Republicans from Colorado objected to certification of the results, with Lauren Boebert and  Doug Lamborn objecting to certification of the results.\nThe party performed poorly in the 2022 elections; Democrats won every statewide office by double digits, expanded their numbers in the state's U.S. House delegation, and further expanded their majorities in both chambers of the legislature. In the aftermath of the heavily lopsided results, Republican state representative Colin Larson lamented that \"Colorado Republicans need to take this and learn the lesson that the party is dead. This was an extinction-level event.\"\nIn 2023, former state representative Dave Williams was elected to chair the state's Republican Party; he has been noted for promoting false claims of election fraud. Since 2023, the party has faced a significant loss of funding, an increase in infighting and party division, controversial leadership, the party veering further to the right, and a further decrease of influence within the state.\nIn March 2025, former Routt County treasurer Brita Horn was elected chairperson of the party.\nCurrent elected officials\nAfter the 2022 Colorado elections, the Colorado Republican Party controls none of the statewide offices and holds  minorities in the Colorado Senate and House of Representatives. Republicans currently hold half of the state's U.S. House delegation, having erased the Democrats' majority after the 2024 elections when Gabe Evans defeated incumbent Democrat Yadira Caraveo.\nMembers of Congress\nU.S. Senate\n*None\nBoth of Colorado's U.S. Senate seats have been held by Democrats since 2021. Cory Gardner was the last Republican to represent Colorado in the U.S. Senate. First elected in 2014, Gardner lost his bid for a second term in 2020 to John Hickenlooper who has held the seat since.\nU.S. House of Representatives\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!District\n!Member\n!Photo\n|-\n|3rd\n|\n|\n|-\n|4th\n|\n|\n|-\n|5th\n|\n|\n|-\n|8th\n|\n|\n|}\nStatewide offices\n* None.\nRepublicans have not won a statewide office since 2016, when Heidi Ganahl narrowly won the at-large seat on the University of Colorado Board of Regents.\nLegislative leadership\n* Senate Minority Leader: Cleave Simpson\n* House Minority Leader: Jarvis Caldwell\nElection results\nPresidential\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Colorado Republican Party presidential election results\n!Election\n!Presidential ticket\n!Votes\n!Vote %\n!Electoral votes\n!Result\n|-\n|1876\n|Rutherford B.
