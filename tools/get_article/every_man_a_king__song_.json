      "text": "# Every Man a King (song)\n\n\"Every Man a King\" is a song cowritten by Louisiana's Governor and United States Senator Huey Long and Castro Carazo. Long was known for his political slogan \"Every man a king\", which is also the title of his 1933 autobiography and the catch-phrase of his Share Our Wealth proposal during the Great Depression. The song's lyrics include the lines \"With castles and clothing and food for all / All belongs to you\". The song was co-written in 1935 by Huey Long and Castro Carazo, the band director of Louisiana State University, a former orchestra leader at the Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans brought to LSU by Long himself.\nOrigin\nThe phrase \"Every man a king, but no one wears a crown\" was adopted from Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan. Long also used the phrase as a political slogan and as the name of his autobiography.\nLyrics\nRecordings\nThe song was recorded by the Louisiana Boys in January 1935 (Bluebird B-5840) and again by the Louisiana Ramblers in October 1935, just a few weeks after Long's death (Decca 5151).\nSinger-songwriter Randy Newman recorded the song on his 1974 album Good Old Boys.\nReferences\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://digitallibrary.tulane.edu/islandora/object/tulane%3A19147 \"Every Man a King\" at the Tulane University Digital Library]"
