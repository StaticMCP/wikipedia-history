Bovell served as a minister for over a decade under the premiership of Sir David Brand.\nEarly life\nBovell was born in Busselton, Western Australia in 1906. He attended the Busselton Central School.\nDuring World War II, he served in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), reaching the rank of flight lieutenant.\nPublic life\nAfter the death of sitting member for Sussex, William Willmott, Bovell was endorsed by the Liberal Party for the seat. At the resultant by-election in June 1947, Bovell was elected to the Western Australian Parliament, winning an absolute majority of votes against two unendorsed Liberal candidates. His uncle, George Barnard had held the seat between 1924 and 1933. Sussex was abolished in 1950, and Bovell followed most of his constituents into the new seat of Vasse, which he held without difficulty for the rest of his career.\nIn 1959 Bovell was appointed Minister for Lands, Forests and Immigration, serving in these ministries until 1971. Between 1961 and 1962 he also took the role of Minister for Labour.\nBovell was posted to London as Agent-General for Western Australia in 1971. He served in this role until 1974.\nLater life and death\nAfter returning from London, Bovell retired to Busselton. He died in September 1999 at the age of 92.\nHonours and legacy\nBovell was made a knight bachelor in 1976 for services to Western Australia. He received the accolade from Queen Elizabeth in Canberra in 1977.\nReferences"
