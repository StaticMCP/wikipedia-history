But as the Vandals moved to North Africa, the Visigoths took over and made Toledo their capital. Seville lost its political and military power but remained a large and wealthy city with fine monuments and buildings. It was also a religious center in Spain. Seville was situated on the left bank of the Guadalquivir River. It was also a well-fortified city where only from the east could be attacked. The west of it is protected by a river.\nConquest\nAfter the conquest of Carmona, Musa moved with his army to Seville and arrived there in August 712 and began laying siege to it. It's difficult to assess how long the siege has lasted; some historians mention that it took several months, but most likely it took one or two months due to the view of chronological events. Details regarding the siege are little, but Musa successfully assaulted the city by force, which made the Visigothic garrison flee to Beja. The remainder of the population accepted the Muslim rule. After the conquest, Musa quickly began establishing his hold on the city; he placed the local Jews in charge of administering the city and left a force of 100 men to establish law and order.\nAfter his victory, Musa marched to capture Mérida.\nReferences\nSources\n*Agha Ibrahim Akram (2004), The Muslim Conquest of Spain.[https://archive.org/details/TheMuslimConquestOfSpain_201807/page/n69/mode/1up]\n*David James (2012), A History of Early Al-Andalus, The Akhbar Majmu'a.[https://www.google.ae/books/edition/A_History_of_Early_Al_Andalus/YSipAgAAQBAJ?hl=ar&gbpv=1&dq=carmona+Musa+712&pg=PA54&printsec=frontcover]\n*Abdulwahid Dhanun Taha (2016), Routledge Library Editions: Muslim Spain.[https://books.google.ae/books?id=Ei5EDwAAQBAJ&dq=Cordoba+400+garrison&pg=PT70&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false]"
