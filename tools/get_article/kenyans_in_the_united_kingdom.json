As a result, many people in the UK were born in Kenya, or have Kenyan ancestry. The majority of Kenya-born people who migrated to the UK are of South Asian extraction.\nBackground\nMost Kenyans in the UK are ethnically South Asian Kenyans who, like those in Uganda, were expelled during the late 1960s and early 1970s. This community has a substantial cluster in Leicester and London. The most recent growth may now be coming from ethnically African Kenyans, mirroring wider trends across the continent of economic migration to the richer industrialised nations. There are also a small number of Kenyan-born people who are the children of British civil servants based there before the end of the Empire.\nDemographics\nThe 2001 UK Census recorded 129,633 Kenyan-born British residents. The 2011 census recorded 135,966 Kenyan-born people resident in England, 1,526 in Wales, 2,743 in Scotland and 301 in Northern Ireland, making a UK total of 140,536. The equivalent UK figure in 2019 has been estimated at 121,000 by the Office for National Statistics.\nThe largest proportion of Kenyan-born British residents are found in the capital, London, where around half of the Kenyan-born population in Britain resides. There are also significant populations in the South East and the East Midlands.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Religion of Kenyan Born - England and Wales\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Religion\n! colspan=\"2\" |Census 2021\n|-\n!Number\n!%\n|-\n| Hinduism\n|46,664\n|34.6%\n|-\n| Christianity\n|33,815\n|25.1%\n|-\n| Islam\n|17,848\n|13.2%\n|-\n| Sikhism\n|13,318\n|9.9%\n|-\n|No Religion\n|8,924\n|6.6%\n|-\n|Other Religions\n|8,534\n|6.3%\n|-\n| Buddhism\n|206\n|0.2%\n|-\n| Judaism\n|103\n|0.1%\n|-\n|Not Stated\n|5,533\n|4.1%\n|-\n|Total\n|134,945\n|100%\n|}\nFamous Britons born in Kenya\nAcademia, medicine and science\n* Richard Dawkins, ethologist, biologist, writer\n* Azim Nanji, academic\n* Alan Rayner, biologist\n* Sir Nilesh Samani, physician\n* Sir Tejinder Virdee, physicist\nBusiness, law and politics\n* Michael Bear, former Lord Mayor of London\n* Peter Hain, former Labour MP, cabinet minister and currently member of the House of Lords\n* Baroness Prashar, businesswoman\n* Lord Sheikh, businessman, Conservative politician\nMusic and the arts\n* Khadambi Asalache, poet\n* Kamara Bacchus, actress\n* Kuljit Bhamra, musician\n* Gurinder Chadha, film director\n* Nitin Ganatra, actor\n* Kulvinder Ghir, comedian\n* Tania Harcourt-Cooze, model and actress\n* Elspeth Huxley, author, journalist, broadcaster\n* Viram Jasani, musician\n* Michael Kuhn, film producer\n* Charles Mnene, actor\n* Dev Patel, actor\n* Deep Roy, actor, stuntman\n* Roger Whittaker, musician\n* Imran Yusuf, comedian\n* Adrian Zagoritis, music producer and songwriter\nSport\n* Roger Chapman, golfer\n* Jamie Dalrymple, cricketer\n* Chris Froome, racing cyclist\n* Rajesh Maru, cricketer\n* Derek Pringle, cricketer\n* Peter Thackeray, cricketer\n* Curtis Osano, footballer\n* Victor Wanyama, footballer\n* Simon Shaw, rugby union player\n* Anne Wafula Strike, wheelchair racing\nSee also\n*Black British\n*British Mixed\n*British African-Caribbean community\n*Kenya–United Kingdom relations\n*Kenyan Australians\n*Kenyan Americans\nReferences\nExternal links"
