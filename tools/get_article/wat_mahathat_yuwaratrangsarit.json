It is one of only six first-class royal temples of the ratchaworamahawihan grade in Thailand. Its monks belong to the Mahā Nikāya.\nHistory\nBuilt during the Ayutthaya period (1351–1767), the temple was then known as Wat Salak. Soon after Bangkok was established as the capital of Siam, the temple became strategically situated between the newly built Grand Palace and Front Palace (residence of the vice-king). As a result, the temple was used for royal ceremonies and funerals.\nThroughout the past two centuries, the temple has been renovated and elevated in status by many Thai kings and royalties. It became the Wat Mahathat of Bangkok in 1803 and was given its current name in 1996. The temple is also home to Vipassana Meditation centre.\nUniversity\nMahachulalongkornrajavidyalaya University, Thailand's oldest higher education institute for Buddhist monks, is on the temple grounds. This is one of the most important universities in Thailand, split into faculty of human sciences, social sciences, an international programme, and a graduate college. The first class was admitted in 1889 and by 1997, both universities became public universities.\nMedia\nFile:พระอุโบสถวัดมหาธาตุ.jpg|Phra ubosot\nFile:ภายในพระอุโบสถวัดมหาธาตุ.jpg|Interior of the Phra ubosot\nFile:พระวิหารวัดมหาธาตุ.jpg|Phra vihara\nFile:พระมณฑปวัดมหาธาตุ.jpg|Phra mondop\nFile:Buddhist monk in Wat Mahathat (Bangkok).jpg|Buddha idols along a walkway\nFile:Wat mahathat bkk 05.jpg|Wat Mahathat temple building\nFile:Watmahathatbkk0609c.jpg|Pagoda\nFile:01 Mahachulalongkornrajavidyalaya University.jpg|Mahachulalongkornrajavi-dyalaya University\nFile:Watmahathatbkk0609b.jpg|Temple roof\nFile:MCU1.jpg|Thai PM at the time, Phibul (centre), joining the graduation ceremony of the Mahachulalongkornrajavidyalaya's first class.\nFile:พระพรหมวชิราธิบดี.jpg|Abbot\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.dhammathai.org/watthai/bangkok/eng/watmahathat_e.php Wat Mahathat Yuwarajarangsarit Rajaworamahavihara (Dhammathai)]\n* [http://www.bangkoktourist.com/thai_places_wat_mahathat_yuwaratrangsit.php Wat Mahathat Yuwarajarangsarit Rajaworamahavihara (Bangkok Tourist)]"
