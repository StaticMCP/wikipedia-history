The school is named after Saint Margaret Ward, a Roman Catholic martyr who was executed during the reign of Elizabeth I for assisting a priest to escape from prison.\n[https://www.search.staffspasttrack.org.uk/Details.aspx?&ResourceID=39248&PageIndex=3&SearchType=2&ThemeID=194 Blessed William Southern Roman Catholic County Secondary School] was established in 1957 and was renamed St Margaret Ward's Catholic School in 1980. In September 2013 St Margaret Ward Catholic School converted to academy status and was renamed St Margaret Ward Catholic Academy. The school is now part of the Newman Catholic Collegiate, a Multi Academy Trust sponsored by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Birmingham.\nSt Margaret Ward Catholic Academy offers GCSEs and BTECs as programmes of study for pupils, while students in the sixth form have the option to study from a range of A-levels and further BTECs.
