Delegates to the 1928 Democratic National Convention were elected from each of the state's congressional districts, along with eight delegates at-large.\nMost delegate races were uncontested; in fact, the only contested races were in two districts where multiple supporters of New York governor Al Smith competed against each other for the same slot. Many of the delegates who were formally uncommitted also supported Smith regardless. Ultimately, the delegation voted for Smith unanimously at the national convention.\nBackground\nProcedure\nIn 1928, New Jersey was allocated 28 total delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Four delegates were elected at-large, and two delegates were elected from each of the state's twelve congressional districts, along with two alternates. Delegates were given the choice of pledging support to a particular candidate or running as uncommitted delegates.\nSince most races were ultimately uncontested, the real contest was to be selected for party support to access the ballot; local party leaders designated preferred delegates ahead of time, determining who would likely represent the district at the convention. The May primary formally ratified their choices.\nThe state also held a presidential preference primary, but no candidates were on the ballot. Fewer than 30,000 votes were recorded as write-ins for Al Smith.\nCampaign\nThe county leaders from the second congressional district met on March 18 at the Ritz-Carlton in Atlantic City to endorse Smith and designate their delegate slate, which consisted of Atlantic County party chair Charles I. Lafferty and state committeeman William B. Vandegrift. (ran for district delegate)\n;Local officials\n* George V. McDonough, member of the West Orange Town Commission (ran for district delegate)\n;Party officials\n* Charles I. Lafferty, chair of the Atlantic County Democratic Party\n* William B. Vandegrift, member of the Democratic State Committee from Burlington County\n}}\nResults\n{{Election box begin no change|title=1928 New Jersey Democratic presidential preference primary}}}\nResults by contest\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:100%;line-height:20px\"\n|+1928 New Jersey Democratic primary\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Contest\n! colspan=\"3\" |Delegatesand popular vote\n|-\n!
