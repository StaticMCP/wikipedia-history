The successive phases of the  Uyuk culture are:\n* the Arzhan culture (9th-8th century BCE)\n* the Aldy-Bel culture (7th-6th century BCE)\n* the Sagly-Bazhy culture/ Chandman culture (5th–3rd centuries BCE).\nThese Saka cultures would ultimately be replaced by the Xiongnu Empire and later the Kokel Culture.\nNearby Saka cultures were the Tagar Culture of the Minusinsk Basin, and the Pazyryk Culture in the Altai Mountains. To the east was the Slab-grave culture.\nThe culture of Tuva in the Scythian era is presented in Hall 30 of the State Hermitage Museum. It stopped to exist in the 2nd century BCE as a result of Xiongnu invasions.\nFile:Аржаан - 2.JPG|Arzhan 2 kurgan (7th-6th centuries BC, associated with the Aldy-Bel culture).\nFile:Arzhan animal ring.jpg|Curled-up feline animal from Arzhan-1, circa 800 BCE.\nFile:Arzhan deer.jpg|\"Animal style\" deer of the Arzhan culture, (7-6th century BC) Tuva.\nFile:6.

Around 7% of their ancestry was related to the Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex population of Central Asia, which is closely related to modern-day populations of the Iranian plateau.\nThe Xiongnu derived an important part of their ancestry from the Chandman culture combined with Eastern Asian Ulaanzuukh/Slab Grave ancestry. A study of the relationship between ethnicity and social status in the Xiongnu Empire suggested that the ancestry of high status individuals among the Xiongnu essentially derived from the Eastern Eurasian Slab Grave culture, while retainers of comparatively lower status had high genetic heterogeneity, representing influxes from the many parts of the Xiongnu Empire, and included a large proportion of Chandman-related individuals.\nReferences"
