AMASE has arranged annual expeditions on Svalbard since 2003 and is run by Vestfonna Geophysical AS and funded by the Norwegian Space Centre, ESA and NASA.\nPayload instruments CheMin and SAM onboard NASA's Curiosity rover were deployed on AMASE in 2006–2011. Field deployment of payload instruments onboard ESA's ExoMars rover has been ongoing since 2007.\nIn 2007 ESA organized a competition, won by a student from Technical University of Denmark, which allowed the winner to carry out her own experiment during the expedition as well as assist in other experiments and activities.\nDates of the expeditions\n* 12 August 2007 – 26 August 2007\n* 4 August 2008 – 17 August 2008\n* 1 August 2009 – 24 August 2009\n* 9 August 2010 – 25 August 2010\n* 8 August 2011 – 21 August 2011\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mars/news/amase/ AMASE Mission], NASA\n*[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Preparing_for_the_Future/Space_for_Earth/Arctic/Mars_in_the_Arctic Mars in the Arctic], ESA\n*[http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/svalbard.html Exploring Mars on Earth: The Arctic Mars Analog Svalbard Expedition], Planetary Society\n*[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Education/AMASE_student_blog_Arrival_at_Longyearbyen AMASE student blog: Arrival at Longyearbyen] (Blog entries available in right-hand menu)"
