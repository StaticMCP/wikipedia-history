Such areas are recognised for their natural beauty, wildlife and heritage and amongst the purposes of definition is support for these qualities and enabling enjoyment of them by the public. For England this national agency is Natural England (having formerly been the Countryside Agency) and for Wales it is Natural Resources Wales (which took over the role from its predecessor body, Countryside Council for Wales).\nDesignated coastline\n1,057&nbsp;km of the English coastline and 495&nbsp;km of the Welsh coastline, in both cases approximately one-third of the total length, have been defined as heritage coast. The goal is to conserve their natural beauty and improve accessibility for visitors.\nUnlike national parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs), the heritage coast designation is non-statutory, and designations can only be made with the agreement of local authorities and landowners. However, the majority of heritage coast falls within statutorily designated landscapes such as national parks, AONBs and the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site. These coincident designations are listed in the fourth column of the tables below. Designations for nature conservation (as opposed to landscape, e.g. SSSI, Special Area of Conservation and Special Protection Area) of parts of Heritage Coasts are too numerous and complex to easily list here.\nThe southern coast of Wales and Devon and Cornwall in south west England have more heritage coastline per mile than other regions, including over 50% of the coast between Cardiff and St Davids, about 55-60% of Cornwall's coast, and around 60-65% of Devon's coast. This contrasts with the coasts of North West England, where St Bees Head is the only heritage coast,  or the south-east stretch of the English Channel which has only very sporadic stretches.\nThe first heritage coast was Beachy Head with its famous white cliffs.\nList of heritage coasts\nEngland\nHeritage coasts listed clockwise around the English coast from Northumberland:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=\"200pt\"|Heritage coast name\n!width=\"200pt\"|County (or equivalent)\n!width=\"150pt\"|Defined length\n!width=\"200pt\"|Coincident designations\n|-\n|Northumberland\n|Northumberland\n|\n|\n|-\n|Durham\n|Durham\n|\n|None\n|-\n|North Yorkshire and Cleveland\n|North Yorkshire, Redcar and Cleveland\n|\n|Mostly within North York Moors National Park\n|-\n|Flamborough Headland\n|East Riding of Yorkshire\n|\n|None\n|-\n|Spurn\n|East Riding of Yorkshire\n|\n|\n|-\n|North Norfolk\n|Norfolk\n|\n|\n|-\n|Suffolk\n|Suffolk\n|\n|\n|-\n|South Foreland\n|Kent\n|\n|\n|-\n|Dover-Folkestone\n|Kent\n|\n|\n|-\n|Sussex\n|Sussex\n|\n|South Downs National Park\n|-\n|Tennyson\n|Isle of Wight\n|\n|Isle of Wight AONB\n|-\n|Hamstead\n|Isle of Wight\n|\n|Isle of Wight AONB\n|-\n|Purbeck\n|Dorset\n|\n|Dorset AONB, Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site\n|-\n|\n|Dorset\n|\n|Dorset AONB, Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site\n|\n|-\n|East Devon\n|Devon\n|\n|East Devon AONB, Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site\n|-\n|South Devon\n|Devon\n|\n|\n|-\n|Rame Head\n|Cornwall\n|7.6&nbsp;km\n|\n|-\n|Gribbin Head-Polperro\n|Cornwall\n|24&nbsp;km\n|South Devon AONB\n|-\n|The Roseland\n|Cornwall\n|54.2&nbsp;km\n|\n|-\n|The Lizard\n|Cornwall\n|27&nbsp;km\n|\n|-\n|Isles of Scilly\n|Isles of Scilly\n|\n|Isles of Scilly National Landscape\n|-\n|Penwith\n|Cornwall\n|54&nbsp;km\n|\n|-\n|Godrevy-Portreath\n|Cornwall\n|9&nbsp;km\n|\n|-\n|St Agnes\n|Cornwall\n|11&nbsp;km\n|\n|-\n|Trevose Head\n|Cornwall\n|4&nbsp;km\n|\n|-\n|Pentire Point-Widemouth\n|Cornwall\n|52&nbsp;km\n|\n|-\n|Hartland\n|Cornwall\n|11&nbsp;km\n|\n|-\n|Hartland (Devon)\n|Devon\n|37&nbsp;km\n|\n|-\n|Lundy\n|Devon\n|\n|None\n|-\n|North Devon\n|Devon\n|\n|North Devon AONB\n|-\n|Exmoor\n|Somerset\n|\n|\n|-\n|St. Bees Head\n|Cumbria\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\nWales\nHeritage coasts listed clockwise around Welsh coast from southeast:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=\"200pt\"|Heritage coast name\n!width=\"200pt\"|Unitary authority area(s)\n!width=\"150pt\"|Defined length\n!width=\"200pt\"|Coincident designations\n|-\n|Glamorgan\n|Vale of Glamorgan, Bridgend\n|21.7&nbsp;km\n|\n|-\n|Gower\n|Swansea\n|55&nbsp;km\n|Gower AONB\n|-\n|South Pembrokeshire\n|Pembrokeshire\n|66.0&nbsp;km\n|National Park\n|-\n|Marloes and Dale\n|Pembrokeshire\n|43.3&nbsp;km\n|National Park\n|-\n|St Brides Bay\n|Pembrokeshire\n|8.0&nbsp;km\n|National Park\n|-\n|St Davids Peninsula\n|Pembrokeshire\n|82.0&nbsp;km\n|National Park\n|-\n|Dinas Head\n|Pembrokeshire\n|17.7&nbsp;km\n|National Park\n|-\n|St Dogmaels and Moylgrove\n|Pembrokeshire\n|22.5&nbsp;km\n|National Park\n|-\n|Ceredigion\n|Ceredigion\n|33.8&nbsp;km\n|\n|-\n|Llŷn\n|Gwynedd\n|88.3&nbsp;km\n|Llŷn AONB\n|-\n|Aberffraw Bay\n|Isle of Anglesey\n|7.7&nbsp;km\n|Anglesey AONB\n|-\n|Holyhead Mountain\n|Isle of Anglesey\n|12.9&nbsp;km\n|Anglesey AONB\n|-\n|North Anglesey\n|Isle of Anglesey\n|28.6&nbsp;km\n|Anglesey AONB\n|-\n|Great Orme\n|Conwy\n|7.1&nbsp;km\n|\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
