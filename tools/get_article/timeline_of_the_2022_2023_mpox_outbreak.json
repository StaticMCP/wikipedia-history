The person developed a rash on 29&nbsp;April while in Nigeria and flew back to the United Kingdom, arriving on 4&nbsp;May, and presented to hospital later the same day. Mpox infection was immediately suspected, and the patient was hospitalised at Guy's Hospital and isolated, then tested positive for the virus on 6&nbsp;May.\nOn 12&nbsp;May two new cases of mpox were confirmed by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), both in London, living together in the same household, with no known link between either of them and either the index case or travel to endemic regions. One of the new cases was hospitalised at St Mary's Hospital, while the other case with milder symptoms was said to be self-isolating at home.\nOn 17&nbsp;May, another four cases of mpox were confirmed by the UKHSA in three Londoners and a person in North East England who had previously travelled to London.\nOn 18 May in Portugal, 14 cases of mpox were reported by health authorities out of total of 29 suspected cases. Two samples' test results were pending. In Spain, there are seven confirmed cases as of 18 May.

A suspected case was reported in France. A genomic analysis conducted on a case in Portugal places the virus infecting that patient in the West African clade, finding it most closely related to viruses associated with cases exported from Nigeria in 2018 and 2019. Current sequencing error prevents exact placement of the virus within the group of these Nigerian viruses.\nFollowing the detection of a case in Massachusetts the previous day, the United States on 19 May placed a $119 million order with Bavarian Nordic with the option to buy $180 million's worth more, for up to 13 million vaccines against smallpox. On 20 May, the US Department of Health and Human Services said the order was part of a standard preparedness effort and not a response to recent events. A spokesperson said, \"BARDA has worked with industry to develop and purchase vaccines and treatments for a potential smallpox emergency, some of which may also be used to respond to mpox.\" Separately, Bavarian Nordic stated an unidentified European country had placed an order for \"Imvanex\" vaccines in response to the mpox outbreak.\nOn 20 May, Health Secretary of the UK Sajid Javid reported that another eleven cases had been confirmed, bringing the total in the country to twenty. UKHSA reported on 27 May that a majority of cases are in men who have sex with men.

The cases were identified as being in Melbourne and Sydney. Both recently returned from travel in Europe and the UK. Germany, France and the Netherlands confirmed their first cases on the same day. The three confirmed cases in Belgium were linked to the Darklands fetish festival in Antwerp. Also on 20 May, Belgium became the first country to introduce a mandatory quarantine for people infected with mpox (21 days). Close contacts of infected people do not have to self-isolate, but are told to stay vigilant. In addition, Health Secretary of the UK Sajid Javid also reported that another eleven cases had been confirmed, bringing the total in the country to twenty. Dr Susan Hopkins from the UKHSA urged watchfulness among men who have sex with men, who have made up \"a notable proportion\" of the recent cases in the UK and Europe. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) advised people who have had close contact with a person infected with mpox to self-isolate for 21 days. Self-isolation is not mandatory.\nOn 21 May, Switzerland and Israel confirmed their first cases. Spain reported 23 new cases linked to a gay bathhouse in Madrid, bringing the country's total to 30. Several infections may also be linked to the Maspalomas Gay Pride Festival in Gran Canaria.
