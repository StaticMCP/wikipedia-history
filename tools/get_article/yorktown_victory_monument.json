Designed by Richard Morris Hunt, the monument was installed in 1884. At the top stands a figure of Liberty sculpted by John Quincy Adams Ward. That element was destroyed by lightning in 1942. It was replaced in 1957 by a figure of Victory by Oskar J. W. Hansen.\nOverview\nOn October 29, 1781, the Continental Congress authorized the creation of the monument, although it would not be until another 100 years when it was finally built.\nGallery\nFile:Yorktown_Victory_Monument,_2014-03-19,_05.jpg|alt=\nFile:Yorktown_Victory_Monument,_2014-03-19,_07.jpg|alt=\nFile:Yorktown_Victory_Monument,_2014-03-19,_08.jpg|alt=\nFile:Yorktown_Victory_Monument,_2014-03-19,_06.jpg|alt=\nFile:Yorktown_Victory_Monument,_2014-03-19,_03.jpg|alt=\nFile:Yorktown_Victory_Monument,_2014-03-19,_04.jpg|alt=\nFile:Yorktown_Monument_(Alliance_and_Victory_Monument),_Yorktown,_Virginia._Rendering)_-_RMH_1884_LCCN2011648072.tif|alt=\nFile:Yorktown_Monument,_Yorktown,_VA_(NBY_429354).jpg|alt=\nFile:Yorktown_Victory_Monument_2.jpg|alt=\nFile:Yorktown_Monument,_Yorktown,_Va.jpg|alt=\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://npplan.com/parks-by-state/virginia-national-parks/colonial-national-historical-park-park-at-a-glance/colonial-national-historical-park-yorktown-battlefield-at-a-glance/colonial-national-historical-park-historic-yorktown/ Colonial National Historical Park | HISTORIC YORKTOWN]"
