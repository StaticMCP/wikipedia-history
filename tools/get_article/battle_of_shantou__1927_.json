Ye Ting and He Long had most of the force. Zhu De's section was charged with protecting the march's north flank.\nCCP founding member Zhang Tailei arrived from Hong Kong with a new Comintern directive: there would be no arms shipment coming into Shantou. The troops were to avoid combat and retreat into the hills south and west of that port, there to proclaim the Haifeng Soviet.\nOutcome\nLeft-KMT troops saw 40% of their number killed in action during the two days' of fighting. Ye Ting took his surviving troops to Haifeng where they enforced the return to local power of Peng Pai. He Long had no men at his disposal and barely escaped; Zhu De led his survivors northwest into Hunan, He Long's old bandit-ground.\nWith Right-KMT-allied warlord troops closing in, CCP leaders Zhou, Li and Zhang slipped out of the now-hopeless Shantou port area and eventually returned to Shanghai, the latter two by way of Hong Kong.\nSee also\n* Outline of the Chinese Civil War\n* Swatow Operation\nBibliography\n*"
