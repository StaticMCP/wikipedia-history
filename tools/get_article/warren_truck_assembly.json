The nearby Warren Stamping opened in 1949. In 1953, the Mound Road Engine plant opened just south of Eight Mile Road in Detroit.\nThere was once a nearby Sherwood Assembly, that closed in the late 1970s when Chrysler halted production of the Dodge Medium and Heavy Duty trucks and exited the market. It was located on the southwest corner of 9 Mile Road and Sherwood, adjacent to the Warren Assembly site on the east.\nThe facility was the site of Dodge Dakota production from 1987 to 2011, with over 2.75 million vehicles produced.\nThe Warren Truck plant became the sole source of Ram 1500 Rebel production in 2015.\nThe factory received a US$1 billion investment to upgrade and convert the facility to produce the revived Jeep Wagoneer, which was completed in 2020. In 2018, Fiat Chrysler said that it would move production of its Ram Heavy Duty trucks from Mexico to Warren. In 2021, Chrysler's new owner, Stellantis, announced that Heavy Duty trucks will continue to be produced in Mexico.\nIn August 2024, it was announced up to 2,450 workers at Warren Truck could be laid off as Ram 1500 Classic production comes to a close.\nProducts\nCurrent\n*Jeep Wagoneer/Grand Wagoneer\nPast\n*Dodge A-Series\n*Dodge B-Series Pickup\n**Dodge B-Series Van\n*Dodge C-Series Pickup\n*Dodge D-Series Pickup\n*Dodge M Series motorhome chassis\n*Dodge W-Series Pickup incl.
