Tolstoy, who first described it. It is named after a site of the same name. The Kelteminar culture was replaced by the Tazabagyab culture.\nThe Kelteminar people practised a mobile hunting, gathering and fishing subsistence system. Over time, they adopted stockbreeding. With the Late Glacial warming, up to the Atlantic Phase of the Post-Glacial Optimum, Mesolithic groups moved north into this area from the Hissar (6000–4000 BCE). These groups brought with them the bow and arrow and the dog, elements of what Kent Flannery has called the \"broad-spectrum revolution\".\n}}\nSome Russian scientists believe that Kelteminar culture is related to the Pit–Comb Ware culture and belonged to a Finno-Ugric people.\nThe Kelteminar people lived in huge houses (size 24m x 17m and height 10m), which housed the whole tribal community of about 100-120 people. They adorned themselves with beads made of shells. They manufactured stone axes and miniature trapezoidal flint arrowheads. For cooking, they used clay vessels produced without the potter's wheel.\nThe Kelteminar economy was based on sedentary fishing and hunting.\nReferences\nLiterature\n*[https://www.opentextnn.ru/history/archaeology/expedetion/Tolstov/?id=1635 Tolstov S.P.
