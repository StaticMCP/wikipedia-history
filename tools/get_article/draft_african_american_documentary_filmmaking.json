From its origins, this field has encompassed a wide range of concerns and utilized diverse narrative and cinematic approaches. African American documentary production spans various media, including independent films, videotapes, theatrical releases, and public television programs.\nA central unifying theme across this work is the depiction of Black life in ways that challenge portrayals seen in mainstream media film and television. Filmmakers have seen the documentary mode as a compelling way to present an alternative, more authentic narrative of the Black experience and to critique mainstream discourse effectively. In the face of a history of exclusion and misrepresentation, many African American film and videomakers have adopted the documentary form to assert their view of reality. Documentary's association with realism and its non-commercial status have made it a space for challenging the authority of mainstream American history and culture. For many African American filmmakers and their audiences, \"non-commercial\" often signals \"authenticity\". Socially and politically committed filmmakers view documentary as a tool to question and reshape history, creating counter-narratives that fill gaps, correct errors, and expose distortions in the historical record of African American experience.\nThe works in this field engage with fundamental questions about documentary theory and the representation of race, reflecting changes in how Black experience has been portrayed across different historical periods. While some filmmakers emphasize offering a unique perspective from \"inside the community,\" theorists caution that there is no single truth or authentic insider that can homogeneously represent diverse Black opinions and experiences. The \"burden of representation\" involves navigating varying viewpoints, subjectivity, and competing facts and fictions.\nAfrican American documentaries encompass a range of subjects and forms, including \"activist journalism,\" innovative television series, portraits of artists and leaders, personal documentaries, works connecting U.S. artists of color to the diaspora, and works utilizing new technologies. The field acknowledges competing definitions of documentary, and some contemporary theory blurs the lines between documentary and narrative. Some African American film and videomakers merge documentary and narrative modes, creating documentary-influenced narratives or nonfiction films with poetic power. Some contemporary filmmakers doubt that conventional realism is more authentic than personal and subjective expression.\nMany African American documentarians are suspicious of the mainstream culture's emphasis on \"objectivity\" in nonfiction work. For some, \"objectivity\" is seen as a term used by the dominant culture to define its version of reality, and they argue that all films, including documentaries, are constructions. Despite this, some, like Henry Hampton, the producer of Eyes on the Prize, strove to present a balanced perspective and give voice to a variety of participants.\nHistory\nEarly Pioneers (Pre-1950s)\nThe history of the African American documentary has roots in the field of still photography. Black photographers documented their communities as early as 1900, creating portraits and images that became source materials for later films. These photographers chronicled growth and change, personalizing and historicizing major social and economic shifts like the Great Migration. Their images, preserved in collections, serve as testimonials to the desire to establish self and group identity and are a vital part of the historical record. Early black photographers' work was often unrecognized, challenging the assumption that photography and cinema were exclusively created by and for whites. Research by scholars like Deborah Willis-Thomas and Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe has helped document this history.\nSome black photographers transitioned into motion pictures, occasionally documenting significant community events. These included sporting events, fairs, civic happenings, and gatherings of organizations like the National Negro Business League or the United Negro Improvement Association. They documented celebrations of freedom, such as the fiftieth anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation.\nNotable early pioneers\n* Peter P. Jones: A photographer in Chicago who established the Peter P. Jones Photoplay Ltd. in 1914 to make short films focusing on the Black community. He produced, directed, and edited his own films. His work often documented parades, conventions, and achievements, and he created compilation films like The Dawn of Truth, incorporating earlier footage and addressing themes like the post-slavery era in response to films like Birth of a Nation. Jones was praised for his technical skill and artistry.\n* Addison N. Scurlock: A successful photographer in Washington, D.C., who later produced weekly newsreels focusing on the social and political events of the Black middle class shown in neighborhood theaters.\n* Arthur Laidler Macbeth: A photographer and inventor in Charleston, Norfolk, and Baltimore, known for inventing a daylight projection screen for stereopticon and movies.\n* Jennie Louise Toussaint Welcome and Ernest Toussaint Welcome: A husband-and-wife team in New York who were active in making motion pictures. Their work, along with other early photographers and filmmakers, celebrated community life and provided vital public records.\nDuring the silent era, limited footage remains, but newspaper accounts and other sources provide insights into early black film documentaries. Films known as \"race films\" provided opportunities and training grounds for photographers entering cinema. Early works included one- and three-reel films, often incorporating \"actualities\" (unedited, unrehearsed moments) of community events like parades, church activities, and gatherings. These films often focused on themes of progress, pride, and contributions, such as Black soldiers or people in the workplace. Race theaters catering to African Americans provided audiences for these films. Early distribution was informal, with prints sold or following circuits mapped by showmen or filmmakers. Comic or dramatic skits were sometimes added to short subjects to incorporate story lines. These films served both entertainment and educational purposes, connecting different communities and promoting race consciousness. Some early documentaries supported political and economic movements like the National Negro Business League and Marcus Garvey's United Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), that established its own film company.\nOne of the earliest black documentaries discussed in the sources is A Day at Tuskegee (1910), commissioned by Booker T. Washington and produced by the George Broome company. This film documented the activities of Tuskegee Institute, showcasing its industrial education program and serving as a communication tool and potential fundraising instrument. The film was viewed as a symbol of progress and race pride.\nMilitary service by Black Americans was a frequent subject of early documentaries. Films from the World War I era and earlier recalled exploits in Cuba and Mexico. Peter P. Jones's For the Honor of the Fighting 8th Illinois Regiment (1914) combined newsreel footage with his own filming to create a historical record of Black soldiers. Lincoln Motion Pictures' Trooper of Company K (1916) was a re-enactment focusing on heroism and was seen by both Black and white audiences. The Frederick Douglass Film Company produced Heroic Negro Soldiers of the World War (1919), praised for depicting Black soldiers training, fighting, and returning home, aiming to present the \"better side of Negro life\". Such films aimed to sustain public memory of Black loyalty and patriotism and encourage the fight for citizenship rights. However, images of Black troops in combat were also systematically suppressed or edited out of mainstream media.\nChallenges for early documentaries included a lack of distribution outlets, limited commercial venues, and small advertising budgets. Some films may have had a longer life as educational material shown in schools and clubs.\nIn the years after World War I, racial tensions increased. Films depicting Black heroism served to strengthen resolve against prejudice and oppression at home. These images also challenged notions of racial inferiority and threatened white domination.\nBy the mid-1920s, the market for race movies, including documentaries, declined due to undercapitalization and competition from Hollywood theater chains.\nPost-World War I era\n* Edward Lewis: Profiled in the late 1930s as a young producer of national series like The Colored Champions of Sports and Colored America on Parade. He worked as a one-man production company, scripting, shooting, and editing, and produced documentary shorts on Black life in Harlem. His sports series featured prominent athletes like Joe Louis and Jesse Owens. Despite his work, he did not achieve widespread prominence, and his operation was unprofitable.\n* St. Clair T. Bourne (Sr.): A journalist who wrote scripts for Lewis's sports reels and William Alexander's newsreels. His broad experience covering domestic and international news, sports, and social issues made him a valuable asset.\n* Gordon Parks: Began his photography career in the 1930s and sought to document Black participation in the war effort during World War II. His attempts to film Black fighter pilots in action were hindered by racism. Parks later became a prominent photographer and filmmaker, making documentaries such as Diary of a Harlem Family (1968), which aimed to humanize poverty, and the impressionistic Moments without Proper Names (1987).\n* Carlton Moss: A playwright, director, and actor who worked in theater and radio before entering film. During World War II, he wrote the script for The Negro Soldier (1944) for the War Department, which provided a historical account of Black soldiers' participation in American conflicts. The film's title was changed from Moss's original Colored Men to Arms! The Negro Soldier was shown to both white and Black audiences and received national attention. Moss went on to produce other historical documentaries and taught film.\n* William D. Alexander: Described as a \"consummate producer\" with a career spanning decades. Like Moss, his career was influenced by work with the Office of War Information during World War II. Under his direction, the All American Newsreel Company produced over 250 newsreels. After the war, he produced short musical films and features and later created \"soundies\" for coin-operated jukeboxes. In the 1950s, he moved to London and established a production company, making documentaries for and about newly independent countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, often working with heads of state. His African documentaries received international acclaim, including prizes at Cannes and Venice film festivals. Alexander's career is seen as bridging the gap between the first generation of Black documentarians and the new voices of the 1960s.\nPost-1960s era\nThe period from the 1960s onward saw new documentarians using film to capture contemporary events, empower the community, and effect change, carrying on the tradition of earlier pioneers. This era saw the rise of filmmakers who challenged mainstream media's portrayal of the civil rights struggle by providing a fuller context of Black culture and history.\nKey figures and productions\n* William Greaves: Became executive producer of the public affairs program Black Journal in 1969, creating important outlets for Black documentarians. He is noted for his own work and mentoring others. Greaves described his decision to become a filmmaker as a response to witnessing demeaning depictions of African Americans in mainstream cinema, aiming to create films about social issues. He is among those acknowledged for early counsel in the conceptualization of the book and is discussed in more than one chapter. He is also well known for creating experimental documentaries like Symbiopsychotaxiplasm: Take One (1971).\n* St. Clair Bourne (Jr.): A documentary filmmaker whose decision to become a documentarian was triggered by his reaction to television coverage of the civil rights movement in the 1960s. He is among those acknowledged for early counsel, discussed in multiple chapters, and is the founder of the Black Documentary Collective. Notable films by Bourne include John Henrik Clarke: A Great and Mighty Walk.\n* Henry Hampton: The producer of the groundbreaking public television series Eyes on the Prize, Parts I and II (1986, 1987), which traced the civil rights and black power movements using historical footage and music. Hampton made the decision to pair black and white producers on each segment to tell \"the full story\" and insisted on giving voice to various participants. His work is analyzed in the context of public television's role.\n* Marlon Riggs: A filmmaker known for innovative, autobiographical studies like Tongues Untied (1989). His more personal works, beginning in the 1980s, extended the tradition while consciously diverging from past practices. Tongues Untied is described as intimate, expressionistic, lyrical, and confrontational, exploring the complexities of Black masculinity and challenging the \"Black or gay\" binary. It is a conversation about sexuality and silence within the Black community. The film confronts anti-gay attitudes within Black nationalist thought and can be seen as a critical response to the Black Arts Movement. Riggs also critiqued offensive portrayals of Black gay men in popular culture, including excerpts from films like Spike Lee's School Daze. He is also known for Ethnic Notions (1987), a documentary about blackface minstrelsy. Tongues Untied is recognized as a valuable document of Black queer history, particularly in the context of the early HIV/AIDS epidemic. Riggs is mentioned alongside other queer artists who challenged the Black Arts Movement's views on sexuality and gender. He experienced racism both in the segregated South and in white gay communities. Riggs took the risk of having his conversation potentially misused or misinterpreted by broader audiences, echoing Audre Lorde's ideas about speaking important truths despite the risk of misunderstanding. Other notable films by Riggs include Color Adjustment and ''Black is... Black Ain't.\n* Stanley Nelson Jr.: Described as a foremost chronicler of the African American experience in nonfiction film. His work combines narratives with deeply researched historical detail, illuminating both familiar and under-explored aspects of the American past. He is a MacArthur \"Genius\" Fellow and has received numerous awards, including a Peabody for his body of work and the National Medal of the Humanities presented by President Barack Obama. Nelson has premiered many films at the Sundance Film Festival, more than any other documentary filmmaker. His films cover topics such as the Black Panther Party (The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution), the Civil Rights Movement (Freedom Riders, Freedom Summer), the murder of Emmett Till (The Murder of Emmett Till), the Black Press (The Black Press: Soldiers Without Swords), and various figures like Madame C.J. Walker and Marcus Garvey. Nelson, along with his wife Marcia A. Smith, founded Firelight Media, a non-profit supporting nonfiction filmmakers of color, and Firelight Films, a production company. The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution is also listed as a notable documentary by the Black Documentary Collective.\n* Jacqueline Shearer: A filmmaker working in contemporary African American documentary, she documents Black contributions to the military. Shearer critiques the myth of objectivity, stating that all films are constructions and that not telling lies is different from claiming objectivity.\n* Louis Massiah: His biography of W. E. B. Du Bois, W.E.B. Du Bois: A Biography in Four Voices,'' is noted for employing multiple points of view and filtering the filmmaker's concerns through several narrators. He is also important in the context of Black diaspora documentary alongside figures like John Akomfrah and Raoul Peck.\n* Marco Williams: Known for innovative, autobiographical studies like In Search of Our Fathers (1991). He also co-directed Tulsa Burning: The 1921 Race Massacre with Stanley Nelson. His work relates to family discourses and challenging conventional notions of family.\n* Camille Billops and James Hatch: Known for innovative, autobiographical studies like Suzanne, Suzanne (1982) and Finding Christa (1991). Their work relates to family discourses and challenging conventional notions of family.\nReferences"
