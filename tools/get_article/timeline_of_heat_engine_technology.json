A heat engine is any system that converts heat to mechanical energy, which can then be used to do mechanical work.They continue to be developed today.\nIn engineering and thermodynamics, a heat engine performs the conversion of heat energy to mechanical work by exploiting the temperature gradient between a hot \"source\" and a cold \"sink\". Heat is transferred to the sink from the source, and in this process some of the heat is converted into work.\nA heat pump is a heat engine run in reverse. Work is used to create a heat differential. The timeline includes devices classed as both engines and pumps, as well as identifying significant leaps in human understanding.\nPre-17th century\n* Prehistory – The fire piston used by tribes in southeast Asia and the Pacific islands to kindle fire.\n* c. 450 BC – Archytas of Tarentum used a jet of steam to propel a toy wooden bird suspended on wire.\n* c. 50 AD – Hero of Alexandria's Engine, also known as Aeolipile. Demonstrates rotary motion produced by the reaction from jets of steam.\n* c. 10th century – China develops the earliest fire lances which were spear-like weapons combining a bamboo tube containing gunpowder and shrapnel like projectiles tied to a spear.\n* c 12th century – China, the earliest depiction of a gun showing a metal body and a tight-fitting projectile which maximises the conversion of the hot gases to forward motion.\n* 1125 – Gerbert, a professor in the schools at Rheims designed and built an organ blown by air escaping from a vessel in which it was compressed by heated water.\n* 1232 – First recorded use of a rocket.

This used the force from pressurized steam to move the piston.\n19th century\n* 1802 – Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac develops Gay-Lussac's law which describes the relationship between a gas's pressure and temperature.\n* 1807 – Nicéphore Niépce installed his 'moss, coal-dust and resin' fuelled Pyréolophore internal combustion engine in a boat and powered up the river Saone in France.\n* 1807 – Franco/Swiss engineer François Isaac de Rivaz built the De Rivaz engine, powered by the internal combustion of hydrogen and oxygen mixture and used it to power a wheeled vehicle.\n* 1816 – Robert Stirling invented Stirling engine, a type of hot air engine.\n* 1824 – Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot developed the Carnot cycle and the associated hypothetical Carnot heat engine that is the basic theoretical model for all heat engines.
