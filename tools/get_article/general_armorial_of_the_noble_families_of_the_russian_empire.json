Parts five through ten were published in 1836–1840 in the amount of 600 copies. The arms were engraved in black and white. A few years ago, a facsimile reprint of the first three parts of the General Armorial was undertaken from the publication of 1803–1809.\nThe following ten parts have not been published and exist in a single copy.\nEmperor Alexander II approved the eleventh part – April 13, 1857 (153 emblems).\nEmperor Alexander III approved:\n*The twelfth part – May 23, 1882 (152 coats of arms);\n*The thirteenth part – January 19, 1885 (186 emblems);\n*The fourteenth part – April 11, 1890 (170 emblems).\nEmperor Nicholas II approved:\n*The fifteenth part – March 29, 1895 (143 emblems);\n*The sixteenth part – February 14, 1901 (140 emblems);\n*The seventeenth part – January 14, 1904 (140 emblems);\n*The eighteenth part – January 9, 1908 (143 emblems);\n*The nineteenth part – June 12, 1914 (142 emblems);\n*The twentieth part – February 3, 1917 (135 emblems).\nA collection of 61 emblems approved by the Governing Senate from June 1 to November 22, 1917, is called the twenty-first part of the General Armorial.\nArmorial decorations\nThe Armorial was supposed to emphasize the importance of entering the emblems of noble families on its pages. It was a highly solemn act of legalization of the emblem of the clan or face. Significance was enhanced by the personal signature of emperors in the approval of each coat of arms. Therefore, the volumes of the General Armorial should look as impressive as possible in order to emphasize this significance. For all volumes in the design is characterized by the use of the state coat of arms – a two-headed eagle. The appearance of the originals of the first 10 parts of the General Armorial is as follows: each volume (size 40x25 cm) is bound in dark raspberry velvet (the successor to the Velvet Book), the images of a state eagle are embroidered on the outside of the binding, a silver meander coils along the blue field of the frontispiece enclosed in a frame. On this sheet, an entry is made about the approval of the corresponding part of the Armorial. This is followed by coats of arms, drawn on parchment sheets arranged with green taffeta and the text is placed under the coat of arms. Over time, the appearance of the General Armorial has changed. So, the 11th part looked different than the first 10 parts. The image of the state emblem was embroidered on the top cover, the spine was embroidered with gold and silk. From the 12th part, the sheets are transferred with translucent paper, and in the following parts the parchment is replaced with thick Bristol paper. All volumes are stored in case-boxes, covered in black leather with handles, for convenience and safety during transportation. Volume 21 of the General Armorial part was bound in 1919, and at the same time a case was made for it. This last volume is a red velvet book depicting the coat of arms of the period of the Provisional Government. The sheets of the General Stamp of the 21st part are arranged with taffeta.\nAfter 1917\nIn 1992, the Russian Nobility Assembly began to publish the New General Armorial (30 emblems), which was to be a continuation of the General Armorial. The New General Armorial was published in the form of individual newspaper publications; the publication was not completed and stopped already in 1993.\nIn 2013, Maria Romanova resumed the practice of approving the next parts of the General Armorial, approving:\n*The twenty-first – July 16, 2013 (61 emblems);\n*The twenty-second – July 16, 2013 (170 emblems);\n*The twenty-third – June 11, 2016.\nVolume 21 is a collection of emblems approved in 1917 under the Provisional Government (see above), and volume 22 contains emblems approved by the Vladimiroviches (Kirill Vladimirovich, Vladimir Kirillovich and Maria Vladimirovna) in 1933–2012. Also in 2013, Maria Romanova decided to \"resume the publication of the General Armorial and, after the publication of this twenty-second part, prepare for publication 11–21 volumes compiled in 1857–1917 and remaining in the manuscript\". Volume 22 was published in 2017.\nSee also\n*Gothic Almanac\nReferences\nExternal links\n*Vladislav Lukomsky, Sergey Troinitsky.
