One of the committee members flippantly suggests nominating Linda Lovelace.  The committee approaches the porn star, who agrees to be the flag bearer of the newly formed Upright Party.  Lovelace’s campaign takes her on a cross-country tour, where she meets voters in stops ranging from crowded big cities to isolated rural towns.  Lovelace’s popularity, however, threatens the Washington, D.C. establishment, and her political rivals dispatch a hit man known as the Assassinator to bring a fatal end to the Lovelace campaign.\nCast\n*Linda Lovelace – Herself\n*Micky Dolenz – Lieutenant Fenwick\n*Scatman Crothers – Super Black\n*Val Bisoglio – Reverend Billy Easter\n*Joey Forman – Chow Ming\n*Garry Goodrow – Adolph Von Luftwafter\n*Fuddle Bagley – Abdul Ali Umagooma\n*Jack DeLeon – Captain Neldor\n*Chuck McCann – The Assassinator\n*Vaughn Meader – Reverend Sacrifice\n*Monte Landis – B.S.\n*Marty Ingels – Ronald Trixie\n*Art Metrano – The Sheik\n*Jack Collins – Honest John\n*Morgan Upton – The Veep\n*Danny Goldman – Bruce Whippoorwill\n*Louis Quinn – Dirty Guy #1\n*Joe E.

By 1974, however, her career stalled.  An R-rated sequel to her breakthrough film, Deep Throat Part II, was commercially unsuccessful, and her attempts to establish success as a nightclub singer and stage actress were considered failures.  The film Linda Lovelace for President was designed by Winters to establish the star’s crossover appeal with mainstream moviegoers. Winters came up with the idea for the film after observing the strong positive reaction that college students exhibited towards Linda Lovelace during her speeches at various college campuses.\nThe film brought in several recognizable actors for guest appearances.  Featured in the film were Micky Dolenz of The Monkees, whom Winters knew from the days he directed and choreographed two episodes of The Monkees, as a near-sighted bus driver, Scatman Crothers as a pool hall hustler, Joe E. Ross as a political operative, Vaughn Meader as a preacher who lusts after Lovelace, and Chuck McCann as The Assassinator. However, much of the film played up Lovelace's starring role in Deep Throat with jokey reminders of the X-rated film's oral sex subject matter (i.e., the slogan for the Lovelace campaign is \"A vote for Linda is a blow for democracy\").\nWinters was one of the film’s producers.\nParts of the film were shot on the campus of the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas and at Swope Park in Kansas City, Missouri.\nReception\nLinda Lovelace for President was not commercially successful and the film was Lovelace's final screen appearance.\nOver the years, bootleg versions of Linda Lovelace for President were released on home video. A commercial DVD version was scheduled for release in August 2008 on the Dark Sky/MPI label.\nSee also\n* List of American films of 1975\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
