He inherited Ballylin House from his father in 1857 and, because he was unmarried with no children, this was passed to his nephew Henry Louis Mahon, son of Ross Mahon and Harriett King.\nPolitical career\nAt the 1865 general election, he was elected to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom as one of the two Members of Parliament (MPs) for King's County.  He stood down at the next election, in 1868.\nOther activities\nHe was a Justice of the Peace and High Sheriff of King's County for 1852–53.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
