A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2013 found that most of the taxa had substantially diverged from each other. The species was therefore split and 12 of the subspecies were promoted to species status. At the same time the name was changed to the Moluccan dwarf kingfisher. Some taxonomic authorities further split this species into the Seram dwarf kingfisher, and refer to the other group as the North Moluccan dwarf kingfisher. The Seram dwarf kingfisher is then limited to the southern Moluccas.\nDistribution\nThis species is endemic to the Moluccas.\nHabitat\nIt is a sylvan species. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, shrubland, wetlands, abandoned plantations and dense vegetation along streams.\nDescription\nCeyx lepidus can reach a body length of about . These small birds show a brilliant blue-black basic color. Juveniles show a slightly less blue color than adults. In adult the forehead is marked with an orange spot surrounded by black. A white triangle is present on the side of the neck. The throat is usually white or yellowish-white, The bill is orange-red and the eyes are dark brown. The entire underside is bright orange. The end of the tail is black. The yellow-orange legs consist of only three toes (tridactyl feet). The appearance is similar in males and females.\nBiology\nThese birds are solitary and insectivorous. They usually prey dragonflies and other insects by means of a rapid, direct flight over the forest pools. The coupled pair dig a short gallery in an embankment, a bank or between the roots of an overturned tree. The gallery leads to a laying chamber in which the female lays two eggs.\nReferences"
