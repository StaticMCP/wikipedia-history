It dates to 1772 and is permanently enshrined within the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Licheń, in central Poland, which was built to honor it, and receives about 1.5 million pilgrims per year.\nPope Paul VI issued a decree of Pontifical coronation for the image on 8 November 1965. The rite of coronation was executed by the former Archbishop of Warsaw, Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński on 15 August 1967. Pope John Paul II decreed her shrine as a Minor Basilica on 25 February 2005. The image was officially enshrined within the building on 2 July 2006.\nAlong with the Black Madonna of Częstochowa, the image is one of the two most venerated Marian images in Poland.\nDescription\nIn the central image, the Virgin Mary has a gold panel dress created in 2017 for its 50th year thanksgiving anniversary of Pontifical coronation.\nThe Marian image is crowned by two angels and is surrounded by a ring of stars. Below the image, a ribbon carries the inscription: \"Queen of Poland, give us days of peace.\" The image measures 9.5 × 15.5&nbsp;cm and is on larger panel of 16 × 25&nbsp;cm. The actual Pontifical crown of 1967 is above the original image, set  on the larger frame panel created in 2004.\nHistory\nThe icon was painted in 1772 as a replica of the icon of the Blessed Virgin Mary enshrined in Rokitno, Międzyrzecz County in Western Poland. According to legend, a Polish soldier, Thomas Kłossowski was wounded in the Battle of Leipzig in 1813 and had a vision of the Virgin Mary who saved him from death and instructed him to look for the image upon his return to Poland. Kłossowski is then said to have looked for and found the image in the woods in Grąblin as instructed.\nAccording to oral tradition, in 1850 Kłossowski and shepherd Nicholas Sikatka witnessed several apparitions of the Virgin Mary who called for repentance and prayer. In the apparitions, the Virgin reportedly predicted war and a cholera epidemic but also gave hope. During the cholera plague of 1852, the image became famous for claims of purported miraculous healing.\nOn 29 September 1852, the image was moved to the parish church in Licheń and remained there until 2006. The Primate of Poland, Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski executed the rite of Canonical Coronation towards the image with the 1965 decree of Pope Paul VI on 15 August 1967.\nMinor Basilica (2005)\nIn 1994, the construction of the new basilica of Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lichen was started to house the image and accommodate a large number of pilgrims.   Pope John Paul II blessed the basilica in 1999, and decreed the title of minor basilica in 2005. The basilica is Poland's largest church, the seventh-largest in Europe and eleventh in the world.\nThe basilica's organ created by Professor Andrzej Chorosiński and manufactured by the Zych company (157 stops, 6 manuals and pedalboard) is the largest instrument in Poland, the fourth largest in Europe and thirteenth-largest in the world. In 2004, the marked golden protective altar frame was constructed for veneration. On 2 July  2006, the heavily guarded image was placed in the main altar of the basilica.\nSee also\n* Marian devotions\n* Roman Catholic Mariology\nReferences"
