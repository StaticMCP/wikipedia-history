The park's distinguishing feature is its unusual rock formations around which religious shrines have been constructed. Some formations also feature prehistoric rock paintings.\nThe park was established by the Fine Arts Department of Thailand in 1991.\nGeography\nPhu Phra Bat is located in the western zone of the Phu Phan Mountains between Udon Thani and Nong Khai, at a distance of about  from each city. The park's area is  and is entirely within the Phu Phra Bat Buabok Forest Park.\nRock formations\nThe unusual rock formations in the park include spires, massive boulders and balanced rocks and form the backdrop for the prehistoric art and religious shrines created there. The geological origins of these rocks are thought to be from under-sea erosion that occurred fifteen million years ago.\nPrehistoric art\nPrehistoric art paintings on the rocks can best be seen where some rocks have formed a natural shelter. Others have faded considerably. The formations named Tham Wua and Tham Khon are particularly good examples; in the former oxen are depicted, the latter has human figures. The park's rock paintings are believed to date from 6,000 years ago.\nMythology\nPhu Phra Bat's rock formations are the setting for a local legend about a king, his daughter and her suitor. The park's most striking rock formation, Ho Nang Usa, is where the overprotective king forced his beautiful daughter to live. Despite her confinement, she was able to get a message out to her suitor prince and the two were married in defiance of her father.\nReligious shrines\nHo Nang Usa is one of a number of the rock formations where a shrine has been constructed. Early shrines date to the Dvaravati period in the seventh to tenth centuries. Shrines feature Hindu and Buddhist influences.\nThe park's most significant shrine is Wat Phra Putthabaht Bua Bok, where a Cham–Khmer style chedi covers a chamber housing a sandstone Buddha footprint. The shrine is a pilgrimage site with an annual festival held in March.\nSee also\n* Bai sema\n* Prehistoric painting\n* List of World Heritage Sites in Thailand\nReferences"
