The name Phra Nakhon Khiri means 'holy city hill', but locals know it better as Khao Wang, meaning 'hill with palace'.\nThe park consists of three building groups on the three peaks of the 95 m hill. On the western peak is the palace with adjoining structures. On the middle or central peak is a big chedi named Phra That Chom Phet. The eastern peak houses the Wat Phra Kaeo, the royal temple, built similarly to the Wat Phra Kaeo in Bangkok. The whole complex was built as a summer palace by King Mongkut, with construction finished in 1860.\nThe site was registered as a historical park on 27 August 1979, with two of the palace buildings now housing a branch of the Thai National Museum.\nGallery\nFile:Phra Nakhon Khiri historical park 02.JPG\nFile:Khao Wang 003.JPG\nFile:Phra Nakhon Khiri 0143.JPG\nFile:Phra Nakhon Khiri (Petchaburi)-001.jpg\nFile:Phra Nakhon Khiri (Petchaburi)-005.jpg\nFile:Phra Nakhon Khiri historical park 03.JPG|Funicular to the top of Khao Wang\nFile:Phra-Nakhon-Khiri (Khao-Wang), Phetchaburi.jpg|Khao Wang and Phra Nakhon Khiri Historical Park at night\nReferences"
