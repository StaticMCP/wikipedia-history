Bikie Wars is based on the book Brothers in Arms by Lindsay Simpson and Sandra Harvey. The screenplay was written by Greg Haddrick, Roger Simpson and Jo Martino. It is directed by Peter Andrikidis. Bikie Wars: Brothers in Arms cost A$6,000,000 to make.\nPremise\nThe six-episode series dramatises the story of the Milperra massacre, when the Bandidos and the Comanchero motorcycle clubs went to war on Father's Day, Sunday 2 September 1984. The massacre had its beginnings after a group of Comancheros broke away and formed the first Bandidos Motorcycle Club chapter in Australia. This resulted in intense rivalry between the two chapters. At a public swap meet at the Viking Tavern at Milperra, New South Wales, a brief but violent battle ensued with seven people shot dead, including a 14-year-old innocent female bystander. A further 28 people were wounded with 20 requiring hospitalisation.\nEach episode starts with a quote stated by Justice Adrian Roden when the clubs went before the New South Wales Supreme Court; \"As patriotism can lead to jingoism and mateship can lead to cronyism, so bikie club loyalty can lead to bikie club war.\"\nCast\nBandidos\n* Callan Mulvey as Snoddy\n* Maeve Dermody as Lee (Snoddy's girlfriend)\n* Damian Walshe-Howling as Chopper (Vice President of the Bandidos)\n* Anthony Hayes as Colin \"Caesar\" Campbell (Sgt-at-Arms of the Bandidos)\n* Luke Hemsworth as Shadow\n* Fletcher Humphrys as Bull\n* Sam Parsonson as Junior\n* Aaron Fa'aoso as Roo\n* Richard Sutherland as Davo\n* Peter Flaherty as Lard\nComancheros\n* Matt Nable as Jock Ross (President and self-proclaimed 'Supreme Commander' of the Comancheros)\n* Susie Porter as Vanessa (Jock's wife)\n* Richard Cawthorne as Foggy (Vice President of the Comancheros)\n* Jeremy Lindsay Taylor as Leroy (Sgt-at-Arms of the Comancheros)\n* Luke Ford as Snow\n* Nathaniel Dean as Kraut\n* Todd Lasance as Kiddo\n* Manu Bennett as Sunshine\n* Trent Baines as Sparra\n* Pier Carthew as Dog\nEpisodes\n| Viewers         = 1.261\n| ShortSummary    = Alone and adrift after his discharge from the Navy, Anthony Spencer discovers the seductive world of the outlaw bikie and the formidable force that is William \"Jock\" Ross – the Supreme Commander of the Comancheros.\n| LineColor       = 191820\n}}\n| Viewers         = 0.905\n| ShortSummary    = Now a fully-fledged member of the Comancheros, Anthony \"Snoddy\" Spencer does his best to calm bristling egos when Mario \"Chopper\" Cianter, Colin \"Caesar\" Campbell and his brothers Gregory (\"Shadow\") and Phillip (\"Bull\") threaten to become a club within a club to the displeasure of Ross.\n| LineColor       = 191820\n}}\n| Viewers         = 0.959\n| ShortSummary    = After splitting the Comancheros into two chapters, tensions with Jock's western chapter make a mockery of club loyalty.

It is going to be a great day. Though neither of the two warring clubs expect more than a show of force at such a public event, motives are misunderstood when a number of Bandidos ride by Kiddo's house.\nAs the girlfriends and wives of the bikers prepare family barbeques, the two clubs assemble at their respective clubhouses. The Comancheros are the first to arrive at Milperra and think the Bandidos are a no-show. Then the Bandidos suddenly arrive in force, catching the Comancheros unprepared and clearly outnumbered.\n| LineColor       = 191820\n}}\n| Viewers         = 1.026\n| ShortSummary    = The confrontation at Milperra leaves six bikers and one innocent bystander dead (\"Chopper\" & \"Shadow\" of the Bandidos. \"Foggy\", \"Leroy\", \"Sparra\" & \"Dog\" of the Comanchero and 14-year-old girl Leanne Walters).\nMany of the members from both clubs are imprisoned as they await trial. The stresses and guilt are too much to bear for Snoddy who relinquishes his Presidency to \"Bull\" Campbell before hanging himself in his jail cell.\n57 Bandidos & Comancheros are handed lengthy sentences for various convictions. Due to serious misdirections to the jury by trial judge Justice Roden, the Court of Appeal quashed the murder convictions and the majority of bikers were released immediately.\nJock served a total of five years and three months for his part in the massacre. His time served was the most of anyone involved.\n| LineColor       = 191820\n}}\n}}\nReception\nRatings\nThe premiere episode won its timeslot with 1.26&nbsp;million viewers based on the overnight numbers, peaking at 1.43&nbsp;million viewers.\n| title2      = Episode 2\n| date2       = 22 May 2012\n| timeslot2   = Tuesday 8:30 pm\n| OVviewers2  = 905,000\n| OVrank2     = 14\n| ref2        =\n| title3      = Episode 3\n| date3       = 29 May 2012\n| timeslot3   = Tuesday 8:30 pm\n| OVviewers3  = 959,000\n| OVrank3     = 11\n| ref3        =\n| title4      = Episode 4\n| date4       = 5 June 2012\n| timeslot4   = Tuesday 8:30 pm\n| OVviewers4  = 928,000\n| OVrank4     = 13\n| ref4        =\n| title5      = Episode 5\n| date5       = 12 June 2012\n| timeslot5   = Tuesday 8:30 pm\n| OVviewers5  = 1,029,000\n| OVrank5     = 10\n| ref5        =\n| title6      = Episode 6\n| date6       = 19 June 2012\n| timeslot6   = Tuesday 8:30 pm\n| OVviewers6  = 1,026,000\n| OVrank6     = 9\n| ref6        =\n}}\nReviews\nThe New Zealand critic Craig Nicholson praised Brothers In Arms as a \"chilling\" mini-series that was similar to the Underbelly series. Nicholosn wrote: \"Like Underbelly, Bikie Wars is the almost unbelievable story of a \"war\" that really happened.\" The Australian critic Steve Molk praised the acting, music and realism of the mini-series. Molk wrote: \"Incredible performances from Mulvey and Nable led a very strong male-heavy cast that, despite bikies often being portrayed as one-dimensional thugs, delivered layered characters and intense performances...Special mentions to Susie Porter as Jock’s wife Vanessa and Maeve Dermody as Snoddy’s girl Lee – two very determined and strong women of their own right.\" Molk felt that: \"One of the few negatives about the series was after building so much tension across five and a half hours of story the last have of the final episode seemed to drag and was far too procedural, though it was a necessary post script to a spectacular showdown that was the basis for the story.\"\nMusic \"Highway Mind\"\nAustralian musician Diesel recorded and released the track \"Highway Mind\" for the soundtrack. It was released as a single on 16 May 2012.\nHome media\nBikie Wars: Brothers In Arms was Released on DVD & Blu-Ray In June 2012.
