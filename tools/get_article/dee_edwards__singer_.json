A keen painter, Edwards then left the music industry to concentrate on her family in Detroit.\nShe died in 2006 of natural causes, at the age of 60.\nIn 2010 Adidas featured a remix of \"Why Can't There Be Love\" by Pilooski in a commercial for the 'Celebrating Originality on the Streets' campaign.\nIn 2015, Tyler, the Creator interpolated a section of \"Why Can't There Be Love\" for the song \"Deathcamp\" on his third studio album Cherry Bomb.\nSingles\n*\"My Time Is Important to Me\"\n*\"You Say You Love Me\"\n*\"Too Careless with My Love\"\n*\"Oh What a Party\"\n*\"Happiness Is Where You Find It\"\n*\"Why Can’t There Be Love\"\n*\"All the Way Home\"\n*\"His Majesty, My Love\"\n*\"Say It Again with Feeling\"\n*\"All We Need Is a Miracle\"\n*\"I Can Deal with That\"\n*\"'Don't Sit Down\"\n*\"Mr. Miracle Man\"\nAlbums\n*\"Two Hearts Are Better Than One\" 1980 (Cotillon COT 50 745)\nReferences"
