Voters chose four representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nMaine was won by incumbent Vice President Hubert Humphrey by twelve percentage points over Republican challenger and former Vice President Richard M. Nixon. Humphrey received 55.30% of the vote in Maine, which equated to 217,312 total votes to Nixon's 43.07% and 169,254 total votes. Despite Nixon squeaking by Humphrey nationwide, the Vice President's decisive victory in Maine made the state about thirteen percentage points more Democratic than the nation as a whole in 1968. Humphrey's win was almost certainly due to the popularity and consequent \"favorite son\" status in Maine of his running mate Edmund Muskie.\nAlabama Governor George Wallace received 6,370 votes on the American Independent ticket with 1.62% of the vote. Despite his significant impact on the election as a whole, Wallace did not have a serious impact in Maine. Indeed, upstate Aroostook County was Wallace's weakest in the nation outside of the District of Columbia where he was not on the ballot.\nThis election made Nixon the first Republican to ever win the presidency without carrying Maine. It would also prove to be the last time that a Democratic presidential nominee would carry the state until Bill Clinton in 1992, and the last time that a Democrat would win an absolute majority of the popular vote in the state until Clinton also did so in 1996. Humphrey was also the first losing Democrat to carry the state since Lewis Cass in 1848. This and the previous election also marked the first occasion since 1852 that the state voted Democratic in consecutive elections. The state swung heavily towards Richard Nixon in 1972, awarding him over 61 percent of the vote, which no presidential candidate of either party has surpassed since.\nThis is also the last time, as of the 2024 presidential election, that a Democrat received over 70% of the vote in any Maine county, which Humphrey did in predominantly French-Canadian Androscoggin County.\nAlong with Washington, Maine was one of only two states that Nixon lost in 1968 that he won in his unsuccessful attempt at the presidency in 1960.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!
