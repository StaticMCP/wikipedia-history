See design patterns for the opposite.  There are many diverse types of software anti-patterns.  Some relate to software design, object-oriented programming, computer programming, methodological, configuration management, DevOps, and other aspects of software engineering.  Several books have popularized the idea and teaching of anti-patterns.\nAnti-patterns can be found in anything that has organization, from project management to cultures, but this list focuses solely on software and computer science anti-patterns.\nGeneric software design anti-patterns\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nObject-oriented anti-patterns\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* Poltergeist\n*\n*\nProgramming anti-patterns\n*\n* Action at a distance\n* Boat anchor\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* Lasagna code\n* Lava flow\n*\n* Magic numbers\n* Magic strings\n* Repeating yourself\n*\n*\n* Soft code\n*\nMethodological anti-patterns\n* Copy and paste programming\n* Golden hammer\n*\n* Not invented here or (NIH) syndrome\n* Premature optimization\n* Programming by permutation (or \"programming by accident\", or \"programming by coincidence\")\n*\n* Silver bullet\n*\nConfiguration management anti-patterns\n*\n*\n*\n*\nSee also\n* List of software architecture styles and patterns\n* Software design pattern\n* Anti-pattern\n* AntiPatterns (book)\nReferences"
