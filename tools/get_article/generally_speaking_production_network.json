Ravenscraft began the podcast as a hobby with no experience in broadcasting, radio, or television; in a June 2007 interview with Podcast User Magazine, Ravenscraft confessed that \"he didn't put a lot [of] preparation into the show at first, and that his audio was poor, but [...] the content was in high demand.\" Ravenscraft gathered thousands of listeners in only a few weeks, and quickly added his wife Stephanie to the podcast.\nSoon thereafter, they launched a second Lost podcast, followed by podcasts discussing faith and family issues, and one about Cliff's life (originally titled My Crazy Life). In December 2008, Cliff Ravenscraft had worked in the insurance industry for eleven years when he left his job to begin podcasting full-time. In 2008, he claimed that, since October 2009, GSPN was producing \"more money every month that [he'd] ever made in [his] life.\"\nPersonnel\nCliff Ravenscraft (born c. 1972/1973) grew up in Erlanger, Kentucky and graduated Conner High School in 1992. In 2001, Ravenscraft was an associate pastor of a Highland Heights, Kentucky church for which he blogged about his faith in his \"Almost Daily Devotional\". Building upon a childhood interest in CB radio, and after he began the Weekly LOST Podcast, Ravenscraft switched from blogging to podcasting.\nCliff and his wife Stephanie have three children, Meagan, Matthew, and McKenna. The elder two Ravenscraft children have produced their own GSPN podcasts, The World According To Meagan and Gaming With Matt respectively.\nProducts\nPodcasts\nGSPN only advertises on two of its podcasts, and has strict requirements as to where and how advertisements will be implemented. GSPN previously offered a subscription service for US$10 a month which removed ads for subscribers, and gave them access to additional podcast material and a daily blog. GSPN scrapped the Plus Member program on January 17, 2011, and has since produced all content with no advertising. The PodcastAnswerMan podcast however sells products where the product itself is a video tutorial. Cliff Ravenscraft also offers a 4-week online podcasting course for a fee. , GSPN currently lists 24 separate podcasts, divided by subject matter:\n;Balanced Living podcasts\n* Biggest Loser\n* Family From the Heart, Authentic Life Radio, Pursuing A Balanced Life (previously My Crazy life), and Watermark Church\n;Business & Technology podcasts\n*Business Tech Weekly (cancelled)\n*Facebook 101\n*Help I Got a Mac (cancelled)\n*Podcast Answer Man\n*Social Media Serenity (cancelled)\n*Virtual Assistant Podcast\n;Entertainment podcasts\n*Desperate Housewives\n*Doctor Who\n*Gaming With Matt\n*''Grey's Anatomy\n*Heroes\n*Musically Challenged\n*Private Practice\n*The World According To Meagan\n*TV Talk\n*Twilight Saga Podcast\n*Hunger Games Fan Podcast\n*Weekly LOST Podcast\nWeekly LOST Podcast\nCliff Ravenscraft began GSPN and his podcasting career with his Lost podcast. Stephanie Ravenscraft introduced her husband to the series and, after watching the first-season finale in May 2005, he was hooked. Seven months later, Cliff recorded the first episode of the Weekly LOST Podcast for 30 minutes, the first official GSPN production.\n, there are 261 episodes of the Weekly LOST Podcast, and over 50,000 subscribers. On May 23, 2010, GSPN hosted watch party for the series finale of Lost.\nCancelled podcasts\nGSPN produced a podcast dedicated to the TV series Drive, but stopped after the show was canceled in April 2007. On December 29, 2011, several shows were cancelled including Balanced Living Weekly, Full Time Mom, Business Tech Weekly, Social Media Serenity, Help I Got a Mac, Almost Daily Devotional, and About The Church''.\nRelated services\nIn addition to producing and publishing their podcasts, the Ravenscrafts offer consulting for others interested in beginning podcasting, as well as setting up a website and all the amenities necessary to begin podcasting. Podcasting AtoZ is a regular course, founded by Cliff Ravenscraft, to provide a start for aspiring podcasters.\nSee also\n* List of podcasting companies\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
