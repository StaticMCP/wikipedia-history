Ltd. (KSAS) for aerial top-dressing and spraying.\nJohn Brown OBE had purchased KSAS in 1946 (the company was started by Sir Charles Kingsford Smith in 1933, but was defunct at the time of Brown's purchase) and made several attempts to develop an agricultural aircraft suitable for Australian conditions. Modifications to a war-surplus CAC Wackett airframe (C/N 283, VH-AJH) had resulted in the KS-1 and KS-2, but feedback from Bill Boulden (Chief Pilot at Airwork Pty Ltd in Perth) indicated the hopper should be placed behind the pilot, for better visibility, easier loading of the hopper and avoiding cleaning the windscreen after loading. KSAS converted Wackett C/N 299 to become the first KS-3 Cropmaster, and it had its first flight on 29 November 1957.\nAll KS-3 airframes were converted from war-surplus Wackett airframes. The changes included reducing the wing and tail-plane incidence, covering the fixed leading-edge slots, removing the rounded wing-tip fairings, adding a 13 cubic foot (400 litre) aluminium chemical hopper in place of the rear seat and modifying the control routes around the hopper outlet.\nSpecifications (Kingsford Smith Aviation Services KS-3 Cropmaster)\n|prime units?=imp\n|crew=1\n|capacity=\n|length ft=26\n|length in=\n|length note=\n|span ft=37\n|span in=\n|span note=\n|height ft=7\n|height in=11\n|height note=\n|wing area sqft=184\n|wing area note=\n|aspect ratio=\n|airfoil=root: NACA 2216; tip: NACA 2209\n|empty weight lb=\n|empty weight note=\n|gross weight lb=2620\n|gross weight note=\n|max takeoff weight lb=\n|max takeoff weight note=\n|fuel capacity=\n|more general=\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 name=Warner Super Scarab\n|eng1 type=7-cylinder air-cooled radial piston engine\n|eng1 hp=175\n|eng1 note=\n|prop blade number=2\n|prop name=fixed-pitch propeller\n|prop dia ft=\n|prop dia in=\n|prop dia note=\n|max speed mph=\n|max speed note=\n|cruise speed mph=97\n|cruise speed note=\n|stall speed mph=\n|stall speed note=\n|never exceed speed mph=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|range miles=\n|range note=\n|combat range miles=\n|combat range note=\n|ferry range miles=\n|ferry range note=\n|endurance=\n|ceiling ft=\n|ceiling note=\n|g limits=\n|roll rate=\n|glide ratio=\n|climb rate ftmin=\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude=\n|sink rate ftmin=\n|sink rate note=\n|lift to drag=\n|wing loading lb/sqft=14.2\n|wing loading note=\n|disk loading lb/sqft=\n|disk loading note=\n|fuel consumption lb/mi=\n|power/mass=\n|thrust/weight=\n|more performance=\n*Take-off run:\n*Take-off distance to :\n*Landing run:\n*Landing distance from : -->\n|avionics=\n}}\nSee also\n*Yeoman Cropmaster\nReferences\n* Tiger Moth, CT-4, Wackett & Winjeel in Australian Service Stewart Wilson.
