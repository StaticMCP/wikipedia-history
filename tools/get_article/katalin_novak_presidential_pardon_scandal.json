The case caused a major public outcry, and led to Novák's resignation as President of Hungary on 10 February 2024. Shortly afterwards, former Minister of Justice Judit Varga also resigned, both from her parliamentary seat and from her role as leader of the Fidesz list for the European Parliament election. It was she who, as Justice Minister, countersigned Katalin Novák's pardon decision. Following Novák's resignation, Tamás Sulyok took an oath to become her successor on 26 February.\nBicske children's home case\nBetween 2004 and 2016, the director of the Kossuth Zsuzsa Children's Home in Bicske, , was accused of forcing ten minors to perform oral sex in exchange for various concessions. In 2016, after one of the victims committed suicide, another abused boy alerted his child protection guardian about the abuse, who immediately moved him to another children's home without further investigation. The deputy director, Endre Kónya, then blackmailed the child, threatening that if he did not withdraw his confession, his cousin would also be relocated. The deputy director was convicted of coercion at the first trial in 2019 and at the appeal trial in 2021, for which he received a prison sentence of three years and four months, with a five-year ban from his profession and from public office as an additional punishment. The director was sentenced to 8 years' imprisonment.\nPardon\nLegal background\nThe clemency procedure in Hungary is initiated either ex officio or on the basis of a written request signed by the person concerned. An application for pardon may be made by the accused, the defence, the legal representative of the accused or a relative of the accused. The court shall submit the request for pardon to the Minister of Justice within eight days who in all cases, countersigns and submits the request for pardon to the President. The President decides on the merits of the request, and may decide to grant the pardon without stating his/her grounds. The decision of the President takes effect on the day of the pardon decision, but the Minister's countersignature is required for the decision to be valid. Pardon decisions are not revocable and final, and are in principle not public and are not published anywhere. However, Katalin Novák has previously given a brief explanation in such cases, and this is not prohibited by law.\nGranting of pardon\nThe Hungarian news publication 444.hu first reported on 2 February 2024 that according to a document available in the Collection of Court Decisions, the President of Hungary Katalin Novák granted a presidential pardon to Kónya on 27 April 2023 according the decision of the Curia of Hungary of September 2023. On that day, Novák granted a total of 22 pardons, which she justified by Pope Francis' pastoral visit to Hungary. Kónya challenged his sentence in a third appeal in parallel with the application for pardon. The decision on the pardon was taken during the Curia proceedings and was included in the text of the September third appeal decision. Kónya was under house arrest at the time of the pardon decision, with nine months remaining in his sentence. The pardon decision suspended the remainder of the sentence of imprisonment imposed in the case for a probationary period of 5 years and waived the remainder of the sentence of prohibition from public office, and exempted him from the criminal record disqualifications in relation to the conviction.\nIn an article published on 11 February, Telex.hu and Direkt36.hu reported that the pardon was issued under pressure from Zoltán Balog, Novák's mentor and synodal president of the Hungarian Reformed Church. It is known that Balog also nominated the later convicted director of the foster home for a state medal in 2016, and Balog himself became a member of Novák's presidential advisory board. According to sources familiar with the two, Balog, after leaving the government, had considerable influence on Novák in the Sándor Palace, while according to the law, the position of President of Hungary must function independently of any other branch of power, including the church. According to these sources, those involved in the clemency process did not think that the granting of the pardon would come to light. Meanwhile, it has also emerged that Balog had arranged a meeting between Novák and Kónya's wife. On 13 February, Balog responded to the allegations, saying that he had not submitted the request for clemency, but that he had been consulted and had decided to support it, which he had done wrong, but he apologised to those he believed he owed an apology to, while also claiming Novák took her decision independently of him in a sovereign manner.\nReactions\nProtests\nWhen Kónya's pardon was made public on 2 February 2024, a national controversy ensued, becoming known as the \"pardon affair\" (Hungarian: kegyelmi ügy). Protests erupted in Budapest demanding Novák's resignation, with commentators viewing the scandal as damaging to Fidesz's credibility as a defender of traditional family values.\nOn 9 February, Novák cut short her attendance at the World Water Polo Championships in Qatar and flew home to Budapest, where she announced her resignation on 10 February. In her resignation address, she apologized to Kónya's victims. Judit Varga, who was serving as Minister of Justice in 2023 and had countersigned the pardon, also resigned as a member of parliament and withdrew her candidacy for member of the European Parliament in the 2024 election. In response, the Prime Minister of Hungary, Viktor Orbán said he would introduce a constitutional amendment to bar convicted child abusers from receiving clemency. As part of the fallout from the scandal, Balog resigned from the synodal presidency of the Hungarian Reformed Church on 16 February 2024.\nOn 10 February, Péter Magyar, Judit Varga's ex-husband, announced his resignation from all public positions and sharply criticized Fidesz political figures, especially Antal Rogán, accusing them of \"hiding behind women's skirts,\" referring to his ex-wife and Novák. In an interview published on 11 February, Magyar mentioned that his ex-wife did not support Kónya's clemency request as a minister, but he did not know why she signed it if she was against it.\nOn 16 February, a large demonstration was held on Heroes' Square in Budapest, organized by several celebrities and public figures, including famous Hungarian singer Azahriah. The demonstration was supported by more than a hundred celebrities and public figures, with estimates of 50,000 to 160,000 participants.\nBy law, the National Assembly had to accept her resignation before it could take effect. There is no line of succession under Hungarian law; instead, when a vacancy occurs, the speaker of the National Assembly (at the time of her resignation, László Kövér) temporarily becomes acting president until a successor is inaugurated. On 26 February, the National Assembly accepted Novák's resignation and elected Tamás Sulyok to succeed her.\nOn April 6, Magyar led a rally in Kossuth Square, Budapest, attended by tens of thousands of people. Four days later, he announced that he will run under the previously marginal Tisza party.\nSee also\n*Pál Schmitt academic misconduct controversy\nReferences"
