Of roughly 100 votes, 75% were for Senator Barack Obama and 25% for Senator Hillary Clinton. The midnight vote was an attempt to replicate the voting at Dixville Notch, New Hampshire during the New Hampshire primary.\nThis was the first Democrats Abroad primary in which voters could vote online, and by the end of the primary, online votes had been cast from 164 countries and territories.  Democrats Abroad announced the worldwide results on February 21, 2008, declaring Barack Obama the winner. Democrats Abroad held a global convention on April 12, 2008.\nResults\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|Key: || align=\"center\" bgcolor=#FFE8E8| Withdrewprior to contest\n|}\nPrimary\nPrimary dates: February 5–12, 2008\nNational pledged delegate votes determined: 7 (of 7)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text-align:right;\"\n!   colspan=\"4\" | Democrats Abroad presidential primary, 2008\n|-\n!   style=\"width: 17em\"|Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\"|Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\"|Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\"|National delegate votes\n|-\n| align=\"left\"| Barack Obama\n| 15,214\n| 65.85%\n| 4½\n|-\n| align=\"left\"| Hillary Clinton\n| 7,501\n| 32.46%\n| 2½\n|-bgcolor=#FFE8E8\n| align=\"left\"| John Edwards\n| 159\n| 0.69%\n| 0\n|-bgcolor=#FFE8E8\n| align=\"left\"| Dennis Kucinich\n| 143\n| 0.62%\n| 0\n|-bgcolor=#FFE8E8\n| align=\"left\"| Bill Richardson\n| 19\n| 0.08%\n| 0\n|-bgcolor=#FFE8E8\n| align=\"left\"| Joe Biden\n| 15\n| 0.06%\n| 0\n|-\n| align=\"left\"| Uncommitted\n| 54\n| 0.23%\n| 0\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" style=\"margin-right:0.5em\"\n| Totals\n|23,105\n|100.00%\n|7\n|}\nA breakdown of results by country and voting method is also available.\nRegional caucus\nWhile the nine pledged regional delegates (each with a half vote, for a total of 4½ votes) were selected at the regional caucuses, the number allocated to each candidate was pre-determined by the results of the primary.

Democrats Abroad is the official arm of the Democratic Party for Americans living outside of the United States.  The 22 delegates each have a half vote, bringing the organization's total votes to 11.\nEvery member of the Democrats Abroad delegation had taken part in the \"Green Delegate Challenge\" sponsored by House Speaker and Permanent Convention Chair Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Convention organizers, by obtaining carbon offsets for their travel.\nCriticism\nCriticism focused on the internet voting, suggesting the possibility of hacking and other subterfuge, though there was no evidence that such hacking occurred.\nAlleged corporate and partisan influence\nProfessor David Dill of Stanford University questioned whether having a private company run a public election, with little oversight, was appropriate. The software used for Internet voting was provided by the private company Everyone Counts. The provider of internet voting was spun off from an Australian company in 2003. In 2006 the company received an \"injection of U.S. private equity\" from an undisclosed source.\nThe corporation running the election, Everyone Counts, named Paul DeGregorio, former Republican chair of the Election Assistance Commission as Chief Operating Officer in 2007.\nPartial results reporting\nThe final results for the February 5–12 Democrats Abroad Global Primary were not released until February 21, nine days after the voting had concluded. The initial reporting of results incorrectly reported the results of the election. The error was reported as a result of \"a programming error in a spreadsheet column.\"\nRule 13 allowed reporting of \"provisional\" results on the first day of voting. Based on partial results, the international news media reported large Obama victories as soon as these manual polling stations closed. These totals did not include any of the postal or Internet votes:\nAt 3 a.m., there are still around 30 Democrats watching CNN as results are projected on a giant screen. When the news channel reports that Obama has apparently won the international Democratic primary in Jakarta, Indonesia, they begin cheering -- more because the station has just flashed the Democrats Abroad logo on the screen than because the Illinois senator has won.\nTokyo Voting Center Results\nThese are the results for the Voting Center in Tokyo, this tally is provisional, does not include internet, fax or mailed ballots, and is subject to ratification from the chair of Democrats Abroad.\nBut here goes.... (drum roll please)\n2/5/2008 Tokyo Voting Center\n% report =\n83% Obama\n13% Clinton\n2% Edwards\n1.% Kucinich\n1.% Richardson\nIn the end the ballot boxes produced a 971 to 422 victory for Obama.\nVoting was scheduled to occur from February 5–12, not just on February 5.\nSee also\n* Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008\n* Results of the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080326194647/http://www.democratsabroad.org/sites/default/files/Democrats%20Abroad%202008%20Delegate%20Selection%20Plan%20(revise).pdf Democrats Abroad Delegate Selection and Affirmative Action Plans For the 2008 Democratic National Convention]"
