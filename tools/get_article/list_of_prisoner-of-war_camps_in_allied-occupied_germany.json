Officially named Prisoner of War Temporary Enclosures (PWTE), they held between one and two million Nazi German military personnel from April until September 1945.\nPrisoners held in the Allied camps were designated Disarmed Enemy Forces, not the Prisoners of War. This specific designation was introduced in March 1943 by SHAEF commander in chief Dwight D. Eisenhower in order to conform with the logistics of the Geneva Convention.\nCamps of the U.S. Army\nThe Rheinwiesenlager'' camps are listed from north to south. Most of them were located near villages on the western side of the river Rhine.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 99%;\"\n!Town\n!Federal state\n!Period\n! style=\"width: 15em;\" |Notes\n|-\n|Büderich\n|North Rhine-Westphalia\n|April - June 1945\n|\n|-\n|Rheinberg\n|North Rhine-Westphalia\n|April/June - September 1945\n|\n|-\n|Wickrathberg\n|North Rhine-Westphalia\n|April/June - September 1945\n|\n|-\n|Remagen\n|Rhineland-Palatinate\n|April - June 1945\n|\n|-\n|Sinzig\n|Rhineland-Palatinate\n|April/June - September 1945\n|women's section\n|-\n|Siershahn\n|Rhineland-Palatinate\n|April/June - September 1945\n|\n|-\n|Andernach\n|Rhineland-Palatinate\n|April/June - September 1945\n|\n|-\n|Diez\n|Rhineland-Palatinate\n|April/June - September 1945\n|\n|-\n|Urmitz\n|Rhineland-Palatinate\n|April/June - September 1945\n|\n|-\n|Koblenz\n|Rhineland-Palatinate\n|April/June - September 1945\n|\n|-\n|Heidesheim\n|Rhineland-Palatinate\n|April/June - September 1945\n|\n|-\n|Winzenheim / Bretzenheim\n|Rhineland-Palatinate\n|April/June - September 1945\n|camp for Waffen SS, later French transit camp - 1948\n|-\n|Hechtsheim\n|Rhineland-Palatinate\n|April/June - September 1945\n|\n|-\n|Biebelsheim\n|Rhineland-Palatinate\n|April/June - September 1945\n|-\n|Bad Kreuznach\n|Rhineland-Palatinate\n|April/June - September 1945\n|\n|-\n|Dietersheim\n|Rhineland-Palatinate\n|April/June - September 1945\n|\n|-\n|Ludwigshafen\n|Rhineland-Palatinate\n|April/June - September 1945\n|\n|-\n|Böhl-Iggelheim\n|Rhineland-Palatinate\n|April - June 1945\n|April/June - September 1945\n|-\n|Heilbronn\n|Baden-Württemberg\n|April/June - September 1945\n|\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
