      "text": "# Charles Howard (courtier)\n\nCharles Howard was a gentleman at the court of Henry VIII of England.\nHe was the eldest son of Lord Edmund Howard and Joyce Culpeper, and the elder brother of Sir George Howard. His maternal grandmother, Isabel Worsley, mentioned him first among her Howard grandchildren. As a scion of the mighty Howard family, his uncle, Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, secured him a position at court. Charles' fortunes improved in 1540, when his sister, Katherine Howard, became King Henry VIII's fifth wife.\nGareth Russell writes:Charles Howard received a few properties from the king, £100 a year, a licence to import 1,000 tons of Gascon wine and French timber, and a place as a gentleman of the Privy Chamber. But in comparison to the treasures that were heaped upon them in popular legend, the Howards were left wanting. With his sister's encouragement Charles entered into a relationship with the King's niece, Margaret Douglas, the daughter of Henry's sister, Margaret Tudor, Queen Dowager of Scotland, who had previously contracted a similar mesalliance with his half-uncle Lord Thomas Howard. The king did not approve.\nGareth Russell writes:Charles Howard seems to have had the Howard charisma seeping out of his fingertips, and if he was not quite the stuff of the council chamber, he at least fitted in perfectly to the merrymaking routine that dominated the court in the latter half of 1540.A seventeenth-century account states that he was killed fighting in France, three years after his rustication in 1541. He died without issue.\nAncestry\n|3= 3. Joyce Culpeper\n|4= 4. Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk\n|5= 5. Elizabeth Tilney\n|6= 6. Richard Culpeper Esq\n|7= 7. Isabel Worsley\n|8= 8.
