This can include wildcat strikes, which are done without union authorisation, and slowdown strikes, where workers reduce their productivity while still carrying out minimal working duties. It is usually a response to employee grievances, such as low pay or poor working conditions. Strikes can also occur to demonstrate solidarity with workers in other workplaces or pressure governments to change policies.\nTimeline\nContinuing strikes from 1983\n* 1983 Arizona copper mine strike, 3-year strike by Phelps Dodge copper miners, represented by the United Steelworkers.\n* 1983-85 Bolivian protests, including strikes, against austerity policies adopted by the government of Hernán Siles Zuazo in Bolivia.\n* 1983-85 Continental Airlines strikes, series of strikes by Continental Airlines workers, including a 25-month pilots' strike.\n* 1983-84 Douglas Aircraft strike, 16-week strike by Douglas Aircraft Company workers in the United States over wages.\n* 1982-84 French auto strikes fr strikes led by immigrant workers in the automobile industry in France against low salaries and discrimination.\n* 1983-84 Sagunto strikes, series of strikes and protests in Sagunto, Spain, over the closure of the Altos Hornos del Mediterráneo steel plant in the city.\n* 1983 Suriname bauxite strike, by bauxite miners in Suriname against tax increases designed to qualify the country for an International Monetary Fund loan.\nJanuary\n* Moroccan Intifada of 1984, including strikes, in Morocco over rising food and education costs resulting from International Monetary Fund structural adjustment policies.\n* 1984 Uruguayan strikes, series of strikes against the Civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay, resulting in the 1984 Uruguayan general election.\nFebruary\n* 1984 Ecuadorian oil strike, strike by oilfield workers in Lago Agrio, Ecuador, over road, electricity, and water conditions.\nMarch\n* 1984 Indian dockworkers' strike, strike by dock workers in India calling for wage parity with steelworkers.\n* 1984–1985 United Kingdom miners' strike, year-long strike by coal miners in the United Kingdom, represented by the National Union of Mineworkers against layoffs.\nApril\n* 1984 Las Vegas casinos strike, 75-day strike by casino workers in Las Vegas, United States, breaking the record for the longest gaming strike in American history.\nMay\n* Anti-Duvalier protest movement, including strikes, against the dictatorship of Jean-Claude Duvalier in Haiti.\n* Cammell Laird Shipyard occupation\n* 1984 West Germany metalworkers' strike, 7-week strike by metalworkers in West Germany, represented by IG Metall, calling for the introduction of a 35-hour work week.\nJune\n* 1984 Iberia strikes, series of strikes by Iberia workers in Spain;
