But the date doesn't go well, and Aorta ends up with plate of spaghetti on his head.  Fortunately, Aorta likes Glorice's tough style, and George and Dip celebrate.  Their festivities are cut short when they discover that Glorice is actually a man.\nThe two try introducing Aorta to other women, but none can match up to Glorice because, as Aorta says, \"She's got balls\".  The Mafia Don even thanks George with a kiss, and George panics, thinking he's received the ominous \"Kiss of Death\".  But his fear is unfounded as Aorta promotes George to consigliere and throws him a party with a cake made by Mickey the Baker.  As the assistant and new friend to the boss, George is forced to drive the two on a date which ends with Aorta on the receiving end of Glorice's oral talents.  Aorta announces his engagement to Glorice with George to be best man, and the beautiful moll reveals to George her plan of blackmail.  So George decides to hire hitman Briles, an expert assassin.  But he fails when Glorice recognizes the hitman as a long-lost uncle, and the hitman is unwilling to kill a nephew in a dress.\nGeorge, dejected, walks the streets when he's suddenly tackled by a draft detective.  George proves his undraftable 4-F status by showing his flat feet. Discovering Glorice in the draft detective's wanted file, George turns Glorice in to the Navy.

Instead, the two start kissing, completely in love.  Aorta walks in and threatens to kill George for stealing his fiancé.
