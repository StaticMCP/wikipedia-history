It is a landmark judgment concerning homelessness law and concerned the meaning of vulnerability under s.189(1)(c) of Part VII of the Housing Act. Hotak overturned the R. v Camden LBC, ex p. Pereira case which introduced the so-called Pereira Test of vulnerability whereby it was judged against the ordinary homeless person.\nSee also\n*Gatekeeping (UK housing term)\nReferences"
