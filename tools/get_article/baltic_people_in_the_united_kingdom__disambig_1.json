The first group of displaced persons (DPs) from the British zone of occupation of Germany arrived in the UK in 1947, called the Balt Cygnets.\nThe 2011 UK Census recorded 95,730 Lithuanian-born residents in England, 1,353 in Wales, 4,287 in Scotland, and 7,341 in Northern Ireland. The census recorded 53,977 Latvian-born residents in England, 692 in Wales, 4,475 in Scotland, and 2,297 in Northern Ireland.\nThe previous, 2001 UK Census, had recorded 4,363 UK residents born in Lithuania and 4,275 born in Latvia.\nThere is a Latvian section at the Brookwood cemetery near London.\nSee also\n*European Voluntary Workers\n*Lithuanians in the United Kingdom\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Burrell, Kathy and Panayi, Panikos:  [https://books.google.com/books?id=KK0GR2ZrVL4C&dq=%22Lithuanians+in+Britain%22&pg=PA89 Histories and Memories: Latvians and Their History in Britain]\n* Budriuniene, Jolanta:  [https://web.archive.org/web/20090520230527/http://www.kirmus.ee/baltic_archives_abroad_2006/kogumik/eng/Budriuniene_eng.pdf ''Regeneration of the Lithuanian Emigrant Press: Fifteen Years' Experience'']"
