One is a stone retaining wall, about  long and  tall, built out of native stone on a concrete foundation.  It is laid out in a zig-zag pattern just south of the campground's main waterfront building, and is oriented with its faces generally directed eastward to the water.  The other is an outdoor cooking area (barbecue pit), also built of stone, located a short way west of the wall.  Construction of both of these structures was begun in 1942 by crews of the Civilian Conservation Corps, but was interrupted when work ceased due to World War II.  Both were then later completed by German prisoners of war who were housed nearby.  They are believed to be unique in the state for this construction history.\nThe structures were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.\nSee also\n*Lake Catherine State Park CCC Cabins\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Hot Spring County, Arkansas\nReferences\nExternal links"
