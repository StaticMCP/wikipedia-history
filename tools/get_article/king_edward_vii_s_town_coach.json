Not being a state coach, it is much plainer than some of the other carriages kept at the Mews.\nFormerly there were several similar town coaches in use, each with maroon-painted bodywork and a dark blue hammercloth. All were disposed of during the Second World War, with the exception of this one (named after Edward VII) which was put into storage. In 1964 it was restored, and at the same time four glass windows were added.\nReferences"
