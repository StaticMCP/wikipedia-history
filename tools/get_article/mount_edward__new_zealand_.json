It is set within Mount Aspiring National Park which is part of the Te Wahipounamu UNESCO World Heritage Site. Precipitation runoff from the mountain's slopes drains to the Dart River / Te Awa Whakatipu. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises  above the headwaters of this river in two kilometres. The nearest higher neighbour is Rob Roy Peak, 11 kilometres to the east.\nClimate\nBased on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Edward is located in a marine west coast climate zone, with a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc) at the summit. Prevailing westerly winds blow moist air from the Tasman Sea onto the mountain, where the air is forced upwards by the mountains (orographic lift), causing moisture to drop in the form of rain and snow. This climate supports the Dart, Marshall, Hesse, and Whitbourn glaciers surrounding the mountain. The months of December through February offer the most favourable weather for viewing or climbing this peak.\nClimbing\nClimbing routes:\n* Whitbourn Glacier – Bernard Head, Jack Clarke, Colin Ferrier – 1914 – First ascent route\n* East Ridge – Stafford Morse, Russell Fisher\n* Via Marshall Glacier\n* Via Whitbourn Saddle\nGallery\nFile:Dart Glacier.jpg|Mount Edward (upper left corner) and the Dart Glacier\nFile:Mt Edward - Mount Aspiring National Park.jpg|East aspect\nFile:Snowdrift Range.jpg|Snowdrift Range on skyline.
