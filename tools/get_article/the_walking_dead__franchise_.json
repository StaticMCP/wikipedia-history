Set in one fictional shared universe, the franchise has developed into seven live-action television series, eight web series that tie into the first two television series, novels, video games, and other media. The television series all air on AMC and AMC+.\nThe Walking Dead comic book was initially adapted into The Walking Dead television series (2010–2022). It was followed by the spin-off series Fear the Walking Dead (2015–2023), The Walking Dead: World Beyond (2020–2021), and the anthology series Tales of the Walking Dead (2022).\nFollowing the conclusion of the original television series, three further spin-off series have been released featuring returning main characters: The Walking Dead: Dead City (2023–present), which focuses on Negan and Maggie; The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon (2023–present), which focuses on Daryl and Carol; and The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live (2024), which focuses on Rick and Michonne. Another series entitled More Tales from the Walking Dead Universe is in development.\nDevelopment\nIn January 2010, AMC ordered a pilot for The Walking Dead, based on the comic book of the same name and developed by Frank Darabont and Gale Anne Hurd. Andrew Lincoln was cast as Rick Grimes. The show premiered on October 31, 2010. The Walking Dead became known as AMC's flagship series and as a ratings juggernaut. Beginning with its third season, The Walking Dead attracted the most 18-to 49-year-old viewers of any cable or broadcast television series. The series was positively received by critics.\nIn September 2013, it was announced that Robert Kirkman, creator of the original comic book, Hurd and Dave Alpert would create a companion spin-off television series featuring a new set of characters. The show was entitled Fear the Walking Dead. The series began as a prequel, but later shifted to run concurrently with the original series by adding Lennie James to the main cast of Fear the Walking Dead, reprising his role as Morgan Jones on The Walking Dead. James' appearance on Fear the Walking Dead was the first crossover within the franchise. The second crossover occurred when Austin Amelio reprised his role as the reformed Savior Dwight in the show's fifth season.\nIn July 2018, Scott M. Gimple announced a second spin-off series at San Diego Comic-Con. The show was later given a 10-episode order and the working title Monument. It was later re-titled The Walking Dead: World Beyond, and it ran for two seasons. The second season featured the franchise's third crossover, with Pollyanna McIntosh reprising her role as Jadis from The Walking Dead.\nIn November 2018, Gimple announced that a trilogy of The Walking Dead films--revolving around the character of Rick, with Lincoln reprising his role--were in development by AMC Original Films. James expressed interest in joining the film, and McIntosh had teased her character Jadis as being in the film.\nIn September 2020, Gimple announced that an anthology series was in the works. The series was greenlit in October 2021 and was entitled Tales of the Walking Dead.\nIn 2022, multiple spinoffs were announced. One such spinoff was The Walking Dead: Dead City, a spinoff focusing on Maggie Greene and Negan that was originally entitled Isle of the Dead; Another was The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon. This show was originally intended to be a spin-off about the titular character and Carol Peletier, but it shifted focus to Daryl due to logistical reasons involving Melissa McBride, who portrays Carol. Melissa McBride joined the series as a regular in its second season. Another spinoff announced in 2022 was The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live, which was originally intended to be a trilogy of films announced in 2019 but was reworked into a miniseries. The Ones Who Live was originally entitled Rick & Michonne. In a November 2022 interview with AMC, Gimple said that more spinoffs were still to come.\nThe development of a series entitled More Tales from the Walking Dead Universe was announced in April 2023.\nTelevision series\n| end1        =\n| infoA1      = Frank Darabont\n| infoB1      = Concluded\n| infoB1span  = 22\n| color2      = #EDE0CD\n| link2       = The Walking Dead season 2\n| episodes2   = 13\n| start2      =\n| end2        =\n| infoA2      = Glen Mazzara\n| color3      = #B7B094\n| link3       = The Walking Dead season 3\n| episodes3   = 16\n| start3      =\n| end3        =\n| color4      = #27504C\n| link4       = The Walking Dead season 4\n| episodes4   = 16\n| start4      =\n| end4        =\n| infoA4      = Scott M.

Rick must fight for his survival to protect his family and friends. While the walkers are their number one threat, other humans create conflict. With the collapse of modern civilization, these survivors must confront other human survivors who have formed groups and communities with their own sets of laws and morals, sometimes leading to open, hostile conflict between them.\nFear the Walking Dead (2015–2023)\nFear the Walking Dead is a companion series to The Walking Dead, developed by AMC. AMC started development of the series around September 2013 and committed to a two-season broadcast by March 2015. Fear the Walking Dead first premiered on August 23, 2015. The series ended on November 19, 2023 after the conclusion of the eighth and final season.\nFear the Walking Dead features a different set of characters, developed by Kirkman. The series starts at the onset of the zombie apocalypse, and follows several people that escape Los Angeles as the military attempt to quarantine the city, and seek refuge along the west coast of the United States and Mexico. The fourth season of Fear the Walking Dead features a crossover with The Walking Dead, specifically through the character Morgan Jones (played by Lennie James) who joins the cast of Fear the Walking Dead after the events of the eighth season of The Walking Dead. Similarly, Dwight, played by Austin Amelio, joined Fear the Walking Dead for its fifth season in 2019.\nWorld Beyond (2020–2021)\nIn April 2019, AMC officially announced it had ordered a 10-episode limited series created by Scott M. Gimple and Matthew Negrete. The series focuses on the first generation of children that have grown up during the zombie apocalypse who call themselves \"Endlings\", and are aware of how to survive if confronted by zombies, but have otherwise been raised behind walls and have never actually experienced survival. Production began in July 2019 in Richmond, Virginia, with Jordan Vogt-Roberts originally attached to direct the pilot before Magnus Martens took over on account of a new series direction. The series stars Aliyah Royale, Alexa Mansour, Annet Mahendru, Nicolas Cantu, Hal Cumpston, Nico Tortorella and Julia Ormond. The series premiered on October 4, 2020, and ended on December 5, 2021, after two seasons.\nTales of the Walking Dead (2022)\nIn October 2021, AMC officially greenlit a six-episode series which premiered on August 14, 2022 and ended on September 18, 2022. Channing Powell, who wrote for both The Walking Dead and Fear the Walking Dead, served as showrunner. It is an episodic anthology series that features new and existing characters within The Walking Dead universe.\nDead City (2023–present)\nIn March 2022, AMC officially greenlit Isle of the Dead, starring Cohan and Morgan as their characters Maggie and Negan respectively. They are also executive producing with Eli Jorné, who is serving as showrunner. The series is set in Manhattan. In August 2022, the series was retitled as The Walking Dead: Dead City. The series premiered on June 18, 2023. In July 2023, it was renewed for a second season.\nDaryl Dixon (2023–present)\nA spinoff series created by Angela Kang and Scott M. Gimple to star Reedus and McBride as their characters Daryl and Carol, respectively, was also announced in September 2020, with plans to air in 2023 after the conclusion of the eleventh season of the main show. In April 2022, the project was retooled to be entirely Daryl-focused, and McBride departed the project. The series is set and was to be filmed in Europe in mid-2022, which would have made it logistically untenable for McBride. David Zabel serves as showrunner, who replaces Kang. In October 2022, the series' title was revealed to be Daryl Dixon. The series premiered on September 10, 2023. In July 2023, it was renewed for a second season, with McBride joining as a series regular. In July 2024, it was renewed for a third season.\nThe Ones Who Live (2024)\nFollowing the departure of Andrew Lincoln (who portrayed the main character of Rick Grimes) during the ninth season of The Walking Dead, chief content officer Scott Gimple stated that three AMC original films would explore events related to Rick's character in the future. Lincoln was expected to star in the films, and the first of the films was expected to begin production in 2019. Besides Lincoln, Danai Gurira (Michonne) and Pollyanna McIntosh (Jadis / Anne) were also slated to star in the films. Gimple stated that the three films would not simply be extended episodes and would not attempt to adapt any of the comic books, but would heavily involve Kirkman in their development. The films were slated to be released in theaters by Universal Pictures.\nAt the 2022 San Diego Comic-Con, it was announced that the three films were being reworked into a six-episode miniseries starring Lincoln and Gurira. The series will conclude Rick and Michonne's storyline following the main series' conclusion. The series takes place after the events of the fifth episode of the ninth season (\"What Comes After\") and the thirteenth episode of the tenth season (\"What We Become\"), and presents an \"epic love story of two characters changed by a changed world.\" The series was set to begin filming in January 2023. Gurira confirmed that she would be a writer on the series and would be credited as a co-creator alongside Gimple. The six-episode series premiered on February 25, 2024.\nMore Tales from the Walking Dead Universe\nThe development of a series entitled More Tales from the Walking Dead Universe was announced in April 2023.\nWeb series\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Series\n! scope=\"col\" | Web series\n! scope=\"col\" | Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" | Originally released\n! scope=\"col\" | Written by\n! scope=\"col\" | Timeline\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:left\" | The Walking Dead\n| Torn Apart\n| 6\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"3\" | Set before the first season of The Walking Dead.\n|-\n| Cold Storage\n| 4\n|\n| John Esposito\n|-\n| The Oath\n| 3\n|\n|\n|-\n| Red Machete\n| 6\n|\n| Nick Bernardone\n| Set during the entire apocalypse, mainly through and after seasons 4, 5, 7 and 8 of The Walking Dead.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:left\" |\n| Flight 462\n| 16\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| Set during the third episode of the first season of Fear the Walking Dead.\n|-\n| Passage\n| 16\n| }}\n| Set before the third season of Fear the Walking Dead.\n|-\n| The Althea Tapes\n| 6\n|\n| Michael Alaimo and Jacob Pinion\n| Set before the fourth season and before the second half of the fifth season of Fear the Walking Dead.\n|-\n|\n| 6\n|\n| Jacob Pinion\n| Set before the sixth season of Fear the Walking Dead.\n|}\nRecurring cast and characters\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n|+ Cast and characters of The Walking Dead series\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" width=\"15%\" | Character\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" width=\"13%\" | Cast member\n! colspan=\"7\" scope=\"col\" align=\"center\" | Television series\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" align=\"center\" | Web series\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\" width=\"8%\" | The Walking Dead\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\" width=\"8%\" | Fear the Walking Dead\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\" width=\"8%\" | World Beyond\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\" width=\"8%\" | Tales of the Walking Dead\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\" width=\"8%\" | Dead City\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\" width=\"8%\" | Daryl Dixon\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\" width=\"8%\" | The Ones Who Live\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\" width=\"8%\" | The Walking Dead\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\" width=\"8%\" | Fear the Walking Dead\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Aiden\n| Breeda Wool\n|\n| colspan=\"5\"\n|\n| colspan=\"2\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Alex\n| Michelle Ang\n|\n|\n| colspan=\"6\"\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Alpha\n| Samantha Morton\n|\n| colspan=\"2\"\n|\n| colspan=\"5\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Althea Szewczyk-Przygocki\n| Maggie Grace\n|\n|\n| colspan=\"6\"\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Anne (AKA Jadis Stokes)\n| Pollyanna McIntosh\n|\n|\n|\n| colspan=\"3\"\n|\n| colspan=\"2\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Bailey\n| King Bach\n|\n| colspan=\"5\"\n|\n| colspan=\"2\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Carol Peletier\n| Melissa McBride\n|\n|\n| colspan=\"3\"\n|\n| colspan=\"3\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Daryl Dixon\n| Norman Reedus\n|\n| colspan=\"4\"\n|\n| colspan=\"3\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Dwight\n| Austin Amelio\n| colspan=\"2\"\n| colspan=\"7\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Edwin Jenner\n| Noah Emmerich\n|\n|\n|\n| colspan=\"6\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Gabriel Stokes\n| Seth Gilliam\n|\n| colspan=\"5\"\n|\n| colspan=\"2\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Hershel Rhee\n| Logan Kim\n|\n| colspan=\"3\"\n|\n| colspan=\"4\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Jake Powell\n| Brendan Meyer\n|\n|\n| colspan=\"6\"\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Jason Riley\n| Nick Stahl\n|\n|\n| colspan=\"6\"\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Joe\n| Jeff Kober\n|\n| colspan=\"6\"\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Judith Grimes\n| Cailey Fleming\n|\n| colspan=\"5\"\n|\n| colspan=\"2\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Maggie Greene\n| Lauren Cohan\n|\n| colspan=\"3\"\n|\n| colspan=\"4\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Michonne\n| Danai Gurira\n|\n| colspan=\"5\"\n|\n| colspan=\"2\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Morgan Jones\n| Lennie James\n| colspan=\"2\"\n| colspan=\"7\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Negan\n| Jeffrey Dean Morgan\n|\n| colspan=\"3\"\n|\n| colspan=\"4\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Paul \"Jesus\" Rovia\n| Tom Payne\n|\n|\n| colspan=\"7\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Rick Grimes\n| Andrew Lincoln\n|\n|\n| colspan=\"4\"\n|\n| colspan=\"2\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | R.J.
