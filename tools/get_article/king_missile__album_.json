Hall lyrical and spoken word moments alongside the lackluster pop filler that padded out their previous five albums.\" Trouser Press said \"the music is unassailable (Rick does his part with several hair-raising noise-fuzz-wah-guitar solos), but — with the exception of \"The Dishwasher,\" an extraordinary multi-leveled evocation of the post-stress syndrome crime-fearing urbanites endure daily — the album draws close to self-parody.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nAdapted from the King Missile liner notes.\nKing Missile\n* John S.
