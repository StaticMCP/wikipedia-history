The arena is part of a larger mixed-use development being constructed by New Balance at Boston Landing that includes the headquarters of New Balance and that will also include shops, a hotel and the practice facility for both the Boston Bruins and a separate one for the Boston Celtics next door (The Auerbach Center). The arena is named after New Balance's Warrior Sports brand, which is the brand New Balance uses for their hockey products.\nWarrior Arena was the home arena of the Boston Pride of the Premier Hockey Federation and the practice facility of the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League who moved in from Harvard University's Bright-Landry Hockey Center, and Ristuccia Ice Arena in Wilmington, Massachusetts respectively.\nPublic transit to the facility is via the MBTA Boston Landing station, a station on the MBTA Commuter Rail system's Framingham/Worcester Line.
