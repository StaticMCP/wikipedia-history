The emotion catches up in the scene where a pressmeet is held in second half to announce Malliswari as the heiress to the 750 crore property. The same emotion is carried till the climax of the film. The climax is very impressive. The strength of the film are dialogues by Trivikram, direction of Vijaya Bhaskar and histrionics by Venkatesh who managed the entire show single-handedly. The only thing that does not live up to the high expectations are the songs in the film. The narration of the film is slow, just like any other Vijaya Bhaskar's films\". Deccan Herald wrote \"Coming from the stable of Suresh Productions, it provides entertainment if you are not looking for deep plots. The story appears cliched and screenplay lacks intensity at times, yet, the movie manages to steer clear of winsomeness with its flow of gags\".\nAwards\n;Nandi Awards\n*Best Home Viewing Feature Film - D.
