In 1977, the house was damaged by Typhoon Thelma and was later renovated. The house was declared a historical building on 15 December 2003 because of its significant value to understand the development of the village. In March 2016, an opening ceremony was held to mark the end of renovation and the opening to the public.\nArchitecture\nThe house was constructed with the southern Fujian architectural style with five layers which spreads over an area of five hectares. The house has five halls with three wings on the left and nine wings on the right. The wings on the left and right are connected to the first main hall. The central room used to be the place for worship.\nSee also\n* List of tourist attractions in Taiwan\nReferences"
