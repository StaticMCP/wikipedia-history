The majority of films in the list come from USA, followed by Europe (mostly United Kingdom and France), Asia (mostly South Korea and Japan) and Latin America (mainly Brazil).\n* Bong Joon Ho's Parasite was voted as the top pick on both the original and readers' polls, as was the second top pick, David Lynch's 2001 neo-noir Mulholland Drive.\n* Only ten films from the list have won the Academy Award for Best Picture: Parasite (1st), Moonlight (5th), No Country for Old Men (6th), The Departed (31st), 12 Years a Slave (51st), Oppenheimer (65th), Spotlight (66th), The Hurt Locker (68th), Everything Everywhere All at Once (77th), and Gladiator (92nd).\n* Only four animated films appeared on the list, with Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away (9th) is the highest-ranking animated feature to be on each list. Other films included Pixar's WALL-E (34th), Up (50th), and Ratatouille (73rd).\n* Only three documentary films appeared on the list: The Act of Killing (82nd), The Gleaners and I (88th), and Grizzly Man (98th).\n* The highest-ranked female-directed film on the list is Justine Triet's Anatomy of a Fall (26th). Although Kátia Lund appears as co-director of City of God (15th), the work is mainly attributed to Fernando Meirelles; therefore, not being credited as the latter's partner, Triet is in the official list in first position.\nDirector's count\nOnly fourteen film directors appear more than once in a list. Christopher Nolan earned the most entries with a total of five films.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Count\n!Director\n|-\n|5\n|Christopher Nolan\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |4\n|Paul Thomas Anderson\n|-\n|Joel Coen and Ethan Coen\n|-\n|Alfonso Cuarón\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |3\n|David Fincher\n|-\n|Quentin Tarantino\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" |2\n|Wes Anderson\n|-\n|Bong Joon Ho\n|-\n|Jonathan Glazer\n|-\n|Spike Jonze\n|-\n|Ang Lee\n|-\n|Richard Linklater\n|-\n|Martin Scorsese\n|}\nSee also\n* List of films voted the best\n* BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century (August 2016)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/movies/best-movies-21st-century.html Official site]"
