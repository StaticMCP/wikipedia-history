Renaissance of the Celtic Harp, one of the most beautiful and haunting records ever made by anybody, introduced the Celtic harp to many thousands of listeners around the world. To call this music gorgeous and ravishing would be the height of understatement—indeed, there aren't words in the English language to describe this record adequately.  The opening work, Ys, is a piece inspired by the legend of the 5th century capital of the kingdom of Cornwall, [most versions of the legend place the city in the Douarnenez Bay on the coast of Brittany] which was engulfed by a flood as punishment for its sins. (Debussy wrote one of his finest works, \"The Engulfed Cathedral,\" later adapted by the group Renaissance into \"The Harbor\" on Ashes Are Burning, based on the same legend). The reflective \"Marv Pontkellec\" is every bit as sublimely beautiful, but the highlight of this record is \"Gaeltacht,\" a 19 minute musical journey by Stivell's harp across the Gaelic lands of Ireland, Scotland, and the Isle of Man.\nPersonnel\n* Bass [Bass Guitar] - Gérard Levavsseur, Gérard Salkowsky\n* Bombarde - Alan Kloatr, Mig Ar Biz\n* Cello - Henri Delagarde, Jean Huchot, Manuel Recasens\n* Double Bass - Jean-Marc Dollez\n* Drums - Guy Cascales\n* Drums [Scottish] - Yann-Fanch Ar Merdy\n* Electric Guitar - Dan Ar Bras\n* Organ - Gilles Tinayjre\n* Percussion, Tabla - Michel Delaporte\n* Producer - Franck Giboni\n* Viola - Gabriel Beauvais, Paul Hadjaje, Pierre Cheval, Stéphane Weiner\nTrack listing\nSide A:\n* A1 Ys  Variations on folk themes.
