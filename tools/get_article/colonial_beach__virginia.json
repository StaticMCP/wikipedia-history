It is bounded by the Potomac River, Monroe Bay and Monroe Creek. It is located  from Washington, D.C.;  from the state capital of Richmond; and 35 nautical miles from the Chesapeake Bay.\nColonial Beach was named Best Virginia Beach for 2018 by USA Today. In 2019, Colonial Beach was named The Nicest Place in Virginia and a finalist for Nicest Places in America by Reader's Digest.\nColonial Beach was a popular resort town in the early to mid-20th century, before the Chesapeake Bay Bridge made ocean beaches on the Eastern Shore of Maryland more accessible to visitors from Washington, D.C. The family of Alexander Graham Bell maintained a summer home in Colonial Beach, the Bell House, which still stands today. Sloan Wilson, author of The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit, retired and died in Colonial Beach. George Washington, the first President of the United States, was born near here at what is now the George Washington Birthplace National Monument. , the James Monroe Family Home Site, birthplace of President James Monroe, now has a replica of his birthplace.\nHistory\nJudging by excavations done on oyster pits, it would seem that Native Americans have inhabited the area of modern-day Colonial Beach since at least the Early Woodland Period (500 B.C.- A.D. 900).\nThe town area now known as ‘The Point’ was originally patented by John Lancelott and S. Lancelott [Odyer and Sturman Escheat] on October 29, 1651.\nColonial Beach emerged as a bathing and fishing resort in the late 19th century known as the \"Playground on the Potomac.\" Prior to automobile travel, most visitors arrived by boat from Washington, D.C.\nThe town was incorporated on February 25, 1892, and there was extensive construction of houses, summer cottages, and hotels. Arguably the most famous of these structures is the Bell House, built for Alexander Graham Bell as a summer home, which still stands today on Irving Avenue.\nThe area was at the center of the Potomac River Oyster Wars between Virginia watermen and the Maryland State Oyster Police that lasted from the late 19th century to the 1960s.\nThe town began to gradually decline as the automobile made travel to more distant ocean beaches more feasible.  However, because gambling was legal in Maryland and the Maryland state line ends at the low-water mark of Virginia's Potomac River shore, from 1949 to 1958, Colonial Beach offered slot machines in pier casinos extending into Maryland waters.  This temporarily revitalized the town, although it was sometimes called \"the poor man's Las Vegas.\"  However, the piers burned in the 1960s in a devastating fire and the town continued to decline.\nEntrance to the Colonial Beach Municipal Pier\nThe town is ranked fifth-safest place to live in Virginia by Safewise.\nGeography\nColonial Beach is located at  (38.253840, −76.968941), in the northwestern part of Westmoreland County in Virginia's Northern Neck,  from Washington, D.C., and  from the state capital Richmond.\nThe Potomac River forms the northeastern boundary of Colonial Beach.
