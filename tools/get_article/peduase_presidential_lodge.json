Completed in 1959 during the presidency of Kwame Nkrumah, the lodge has served as a holiday residence for presidents and a venue for national meetings.\nHistory\nConception and construction\nThe lodge was conceived to provide a hill‑top retreat for the head of state, offering cooler climate conditions than Accra and promoting development in the surrounding region. Construction was completed in 1959 under Nkrumah's government.\nUse by presidents\nDuring Ghana's Second Republic and Third Republic, it served as the official temporal residence for presidents such as Edward Akufo-Addo and Hilla Limann.\nDecline and rehabilitation\nBy the early 2000s, the lodge fell into disrepair, with infrastructure deteriorating due to lack of maintenance. A major rehabilitation programme was launched by the government in the mid‑2000s.\nModern usage\nThe lodge continues to host presidential retreats, cabinet meetings, and state events.\nArchitecture and facilities\nPeduase Presidential Lodge is a four‑storey building situated on a ridge with panoramic views. Facilities include guest suites, a library, a theatre complex, and indoor/outdoor recreational spaces such as a swimming pool.\nLand and compensation issues\nIn 2004, the Government of Ghana pledged compensation to landowners whose property was acquired for the lodge and associated projects.\nSee also\n* Aburi Botanical Gardens\n* Jubilee House\nReferences"
