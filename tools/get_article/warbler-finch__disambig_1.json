Together with related genera, they are collectively known as Darwin's finches.\nThe two species were formerly considered to be conspecific; however, they have different songs, prefer different habitats, and are located in different areas on the islands.\nTaxonomy and species list\nThe genus Certhidea was introduced in 1837 by the English ornithologist John Gould with the green warbler-finch as the type species. The name is a Latin diminutive of the genus Certhia introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for the treecreepers. The members of the genus form part of a group collectively known as Darwin's finches. Although traditionally placed with the buntings and New World sparrows in the family Emberizidae, molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that Darwin's finches are members of the subfamily Coerebinae within the tanager family Thraupidae. The genus contains two species.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Image !! Scientific name !! Common name !!
