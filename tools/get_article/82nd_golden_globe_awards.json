The winners were revealed during the live telecast, aired on CBS on January 5, 2025. The event was hosted by comedian Nikki Glaser, making her the first solo female host in Golden Globes history.\nThe nominations were announced live on December 9, 2024, at a press conference at The Beverly Hilton by actors Morris Chestnut and Mindy Kaling, following an introduction from Golden Globes president, Helen Hoenhe. Emilia Pérez, with 10 nominations, became the most nominated comedy/musical film in Golden Globes history, just 1 shy of the overall record of 11, set by Robert Altman's country music satire Nashville in the drama category in 1976. The Brutalist received the second-most in film with 7 nominations, followed by Conclave with 6. Additionally, The Bear led the television nominations with 5, followed by Only Murders in the Building and Shōgun with 4 each.\nCeremony information\nOn August 28, 2024, comedian Nikki Glaser was announced as the host for this year's ceremony, following last year's widely criticized host, comedian Jo Koy. She is the first woman to host the Golden Globes solo. Glaser herself was nominated for Best Performance in Stand-Up Comedy on Television for her HBO comedy special, ''Nikki Glaser: Someday You'll Die'', but lost to Ali Wong.\nThe ceremony was held at 5:00 p.m. PST / 8:00 p.m. EST on January 5, 2025. It was broadcast live on CBS and streaming on Paramount+. Glenn Weiss and Ricky Kirshner of White Cherry Entertainment returned from last year to executive produce the ceremony, along with Dick Clark Productions.\nOn December 3, 2024, it was announced that the two Lifetime Achievement Awards, which were not presented last year, would return this year; however, they were presented during an untelevised gala dinner on January 3, 2025, prior to the telecast, similar to the Academy Awards' Governors Awards. The recipient of the Cecil B. DeMille Award was Viola Davis, while the Carol Burnett Award was awarded to Ted Danson.\nWinners and nominees\n, Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama winner]]\n, Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama winner]]\n, Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy winner]]\n, Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy winner]]\n, Best Supporting Actor winner]]\n, Best Supporting Actress winner]]\n, Best Actor in a Television Series – Drama winner]]\n, Best Actress in a Television Series – Drama winner]]\n, Best Actor in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy winner]]\n, Best Actress in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy winner]]\n, Best Actor in a Limited Series, Anthology Series, or Motion Picture Made for Television winner]]\n, Best Actress in a Limited Series, Anthology Series, or Motion Picture Made for Television winner]]\n, Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Limited Series, Anthology Series, or Motion Picture Made for Television winner]]\n, Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Limited Series, Anthology Series, or Motion Picture Made for Television winner]]\n, Best Stand-Up Comedian on Television winner]]\nEmilia Pérez star Karla Sofía Gascón was the first trans nominee for a Golden Globe motion picture acting category, for the Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy category.
