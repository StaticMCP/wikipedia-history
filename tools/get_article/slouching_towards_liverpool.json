Michael Quercio, leader of The Three O'Clock and a member of Game Theory in 1989 and 1990, plays bass guitar on \"The Come On\".\nThe EP's title alludes to William Butler Yeats's poem The Second Coming, which ends with the lines \"And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,\nSlouches towards Bethlehem to be born?\" The Loud Family's use is a nod to both Scott Miller's literary interests and to the hometown of The Beatles.\nTrack listing\n#\"Take Me Down\" – 3:09\n#\"The Come On\" – 3:23\n#\"Back of a Car\" – 2:27\n#\"Slit My Wrists\" (Live at WNUR-FM) – 2:52\n#\"Aerodeliria\" (Live at WNUR-FM) – 3:05\n#\"Erica's Word\" (Live in studio) – 4:04\nPersonnel\n*Jozef Becker - drums and percussion\n*Scott Miller - vocals and rhythm guitar\n*R.
