An aerial lift or cable car to connect the stadium with the \"Aerovia\" Julian Coronel station in downtown Guayaquil was scheduled to start in 2021. The stadium is the home to Ecuadorian football club Barcelona SC. It has a capacity of 57,267, which makes it the largest stadium in Ecuador. It is located at 10 meters (32,8 feet) above sea level.\nHistory\nClub president Isidro Romero Carbo wanted Barcelona, at the time playing their home games at the Estadio Modelo Alberto Spencer Herrera, to have their own stadium.\nThe stadium was inaugurated on December 27, 1987. The first game was played against Peñarol of Uruguay, which Barcelona SC lost 1-3. Barcelona invited many South American football celebrities, such as Pelé, to the inauguration; Pelé compared the stadium to the famous Maracanã in Rio de Janeiro:\nthere is a golden plaque in the stadium celebrating this description.\nThere are healthcare facilities, clothing-and-souvenir shops, and restaurants, in a total area of about 5,100&nbsp;m2. The football field is 105 metres long and 70 metres wide. The training field near the stadium is called Alternate Field Sigifredo Agapito Chuchuca in honor of one of the greatest midfielders in team history.\nThe stadium hosted 5 matches of the 1993 Copa América, including the final.\nOn January 2, 2008, president of Barcelona Eduardo Maruri signed a 4-year contract with Ecuadorian bank Banco Pichincha to have the stadium named after the bank. The contract was renewed but came to an end in 2015.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928180817/http://www.bsc.ec/reportajesinfo.php?id=182 19 Years of Monumental]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080922145529/http://www.ecuafutbol.org/UI/detalle.aspx?seccion=1&categserie=7&nivel=0&subnivel=0&id=10946&tabla=N FEF article on name change]"
