Band members were Martin Ling (vocals), Eugene Rodgers (vocals), Andy Hearnshaw (guitar, formerly of The Farmer's Boys), Jem Moore (bass), Pete Saunders (keyboards) also known from Dexys Midnight Runners and Lance Dunlop (drums). Their debut EP, Love on the Terraces (produced by Madness's Mark Bedford) reached number 9 on the UK Indie Chart in 1982, with follow-up \"Hangover\" reaching number 4 the following year. Debut album The Revolution Starts at Closing Time also reached number 4, and was followed up in 1984 by a second album, ''They May Be Drinkers Robin, But They're Still Human Beings. After another single, \"Country Girl Became Drugs and Sex Punk\", Moore and Dunlop left the band.
