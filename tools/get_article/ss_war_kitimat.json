She was steam-powered, with a hull made of wood.\nShe was built in New Westminster, BC. A temporary shipyard was built on then undeveloped Poplar Island, for the construction of the War Kitimat and three sister ships, , , and .\nThe War Kitimat was run aground shortly after her launch, and was repaired in Victoria, BC. She made at least one voyage during wartime. When peace came she was redundant, and was sold, in 1919, to the Belgian shipping firm Lloyd Royal Belge S.A., which renamed her Serbier. On 12 January 1920 she was en route from Cartagena and Oran, bound for Antwerp, carrying zinc ore and general cargo, when she sprang a leak 80 nautical miles off Penmarch, Finistère. With her engine room flooded she was abandoned by her crew and left to sink. Her crew were rescued by the French vessel .\n-->\n}}\nExternal links"
