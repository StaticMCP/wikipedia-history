Hymns on the temple have been composed by the Nayanmars Sambandar, Appar and Sundarar. Lakshmi, the consort of Vishnu is believed to have worshipped Vishnu in the temple and hence the presiding deity is called Mahalakshmeeswarar..\nLegend\nAccording to legend, a Chola king was travelling through the place when the torch carried by his men went off. It automatically started burning when the entourage had crossed the spot. On inquiring from a local shepherd, the king learnt that a holy shivalinga had been buried at the spot. The king found the shivalinga and built a temple to Shiva.\nTirunindriyur is also believed to be the place where Shiva gave darshan to Parasurama in order to relieve him of the sin of matricide.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
