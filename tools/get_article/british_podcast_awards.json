The British Podcast Awards will initially sit within Haymarket Business Media’s marketing communications portfolio, with plans to launch more podcast events internationally in 2023.\nPodPod, a publication about the craft and business of podcasting launched the previous year, was announced as media partner of the British Podcast Awards in 2023, before responsibility for overseeing the awards was transferred to Campaign.\n2017\nChaired by Helen Zaltzman, the judging panel contained more than 50 independent members representing podcast creators, publishers, the press, listeners and audio industry executives.
