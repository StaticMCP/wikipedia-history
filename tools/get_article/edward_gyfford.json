Stratford, Holborn, 1809]]\nfrom The Microcosm of London, 1809]]\nEdward Gyfford or Gifford (1772 – after 1851) was a British architect and surveyor known for his two volumes of designs for small buildings that were published in 1806 and 1807. He also produced architectural drawings that were engraved for David Hughson's description of London (1805–1809).\nEarly life and family\nEdward Gyfford was born in Middlesex in 1772. He was a pupil at the Royal Academy Schools and was awarded a gold medal by the Academy in 1792.\nHe married Janet and they had children Samuel, Mary, and John, all born in Fulham. Mary married the Quebec merchant Matthew H. Warren in 1856.\nCareer\nGyfford designed Belle Vue House, also known as Cooke's Folly, in Hale Brinks Woods, Walthamstow, for the bookseller Charles Cooke. It was built around 1803 in the Regency style and featured a semi-circular portico with Ionic columns and landscaped grounds with an artificial lake. It was demolished around 1937.\nHe is remembered for his architectural drawings. He contributed several to David Hughson's description of London, including his own Belle Vue House, which were engraved on copper plates and published in the six volume work from 1805 to 1809.\nHe also published two volumes of his designs for small buildings, Designs for Elegant Cottages and Small Villas, Calculated for the Comfort and Convenience of Persons of Moderate and of Ample Fortune (1806) and Designs for Small Picturesque Cottages and Hunting Boxes (1807). (see Hunting box.)\nHe may have held a commission in the West London Militia.\nIn April 1832, a notice in The Times announced a meeting of Gyfford's creditors on his discharge from the King's Bench Prison where he had been held for debt. His former addresses were given as 38 William Street, Hampstead Road, and 4 Brasset Place, North End, Fulham, both in the county of Middlesex.\nLater life\nGyfford is included in the 1851 British census when he is recorded as living at Bloomfield Place, Middlesex, with his wife and three children. His year of death is unknown.\nPublications\n* [https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100241875 Designs for Elegant Cottages and Small Villas, Calculated for the Comfort and Convenience of Persons of Moderate and of Ample Fortune; Carefully Studied and Thrown into Perspective.
