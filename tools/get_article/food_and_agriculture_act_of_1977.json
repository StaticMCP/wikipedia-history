The S. 275 legislation was passed by the 95th U.S. Congressional session and signed into law by the 39th President of the United States Jimmy Carter on September 29, 1977.\nIt increased price and income supports and established a farmer-owned reserve for grain. It also established a new two-tiered pricing program for peanuts. Under the peanut program, producers were given an acreage allotment on which a poundage quota was set. Growers could produce in excess of their quota, within their acreage allotment, but would receive the higher of the two price-support levels only for the quota amount. Peanuts in excess of the quota are referred to as \"additionals\", or additional peanuts.\nTitle XIII was designated the Food Stamp Act of 1977 and permanently amended the Food Stamp Act of 1964 by eliminating the purchase requirement and simplifying eligibility requirements.\nTitle XIV was designated the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act and made USDA the leading federal agency for agricultural research, extension, and teaching programs.  It also consolidated the funding for these programs.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-10246/uslm/COMPS-10246.xml Food and Agriculture Act of 1977] as amended ([https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-10246/pdf/COMPS-10246.pdf PDF]/[https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/COMPS-10246 details]) in the GPO [https://www.govinfo.gov/help/comps Statute Compilations collection]"
