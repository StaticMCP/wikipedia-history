The layout of ancient Chinese architectural style in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River such as kiosks, pavilions, platforms, and towers was adopted against the mountains and waters, realizing a gorgeous effect of diverse landscapes of mountain beyond mountain and garden beyond garden.\nBy the end of October 2010, the park was closed for renovation and expansion. It was reopened two years later in November 2012.\nFile:Liangshengjun Miao.jpg|Liangshengjun Temple\nFile:Liangzhu Culture Park, 2014-06-10 09.JPG|Liangzhu joint tomb, rebuilt in 1985\nSee also\n* Liangzhu station\nReferences"
