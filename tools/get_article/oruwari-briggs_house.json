      "text": "# Oruwari-Briggs House\n\nThe Briggs family is a prominent and influential lineage in Rivers State, Nigeria, deeply embedded in royalty, chieftaincy, and leadership within Kalabari land. The family is extensive and complex, encompassing multiple branches and houses, and has strong connections to the Amachree (pronounced Āmá-kiri) Royal family of the Kalabari Kingdom. Historical accounts suggest that Amachree (I), originally migrated from Amakalakala in Ogbia, an Ijaw sub-group.\nPrimarily of Ijaw ethnicity, the Briggs family belongs to the Kalabari Ijaw subgroup in Rivers State. The family's prominence rose significantly through the Oruwari-Briggs House, previously led by the late High Chief Olu Benson Lulu-Briggs, popularly known as O.B. Lulu-Briggs.\nIn 2012, Forbes estimated High Chief O.B. Lulu-Briggs' net worth at approximately $500 million, solidifying the Lulu-Briggs family as one of the most renowned and affluent in the Niger Delta region. High Chief O.B. Lulu-Briggs was among the few Ijaws who secured Oil Mining Licenses (OML) early on and retained them. Instead of selling his license, he transformed it into Moni Pulo Petroleum Development Company (MPPDC), now Moni Pulo Limited (MPL), an oil exploration and production company that employs hundreds of youths and generates significant wealth daily.\nHistorical background\nThe Oruwari House traces its origins to the Dueinala lineage in the Akialame ward. After Dueinala's era, leadership of the ward passed to Asukein, who lacked the resources to rebuild it. He was succeeded by Ikata, a renowned merchant, who also faced challenges in reuniting the dispersed lineage. The turning point came with Oruwari Biriki, later known as Oruwari-Briggs, who successfully rebuilt Dueinala's ward, which later became known as Dueinala's house. Oruwari's father, Inoma, and his mother, Iniibatangamuari, were both from the Dueinala lineage. His name, Oruwariyibo, reflects these circumstances, meaning \"child born in a shrine.\"\nOruwari later returned to Elem Kalabari, where he adopted his grandfather's trade name, Black Jimmy.\nLike other Ijaw sub-groups, the Kalabari participated in the 19th-century slave trade, acquiring slaves primarily to showcase wealth and expand their workforce. These slaves were eventually freed, with many being adopted into various families within the Kalabari Kingdom.\nThe Kalabari Civil War and its Aftermath\nThe socio-political tensions between the Amachree and Bob-Manuel alliances on one side, and the Awo-Barboy and Oruwari-Briggs alliances on the other, eventually weakened the state, pushing Princewill Amachree to seek British support. This culminated in the Treaty of Protection between Britain and Kalabari in 1883, which was signed by King Princewill Amachree IV and other leaders, including Chiefs Young-Briggs, George Amachree, Bob Manuel, John Bull, and Omekwe Horsefall Manuel.\nThe Kalabari Civil War provided an opportunity for previously conquered communities to regain their independence. The war, combined with the migration of populations from Elem Kalabari and the founding of new towns like Bakana, Buguma, Krakrama and Abonnema, marked the decline of the Kalabari Empire and its transformation into a republic or confederacy.\nThe conflict led to the dispersion of the population, with people settling in new areas based on strategic alliances rather than biological or familial ties. This period marked the beginning of significant changes in the political and social structure of the Kalabari Kingdom, ultimately reshaping the region's history.\nActivities\nThe modern-day Briggs family is actively engaged in a broad range of activities, including philanthropy, business, and human capital development. Their influence extends far beyond Rivers State, with family members residing in various cities worldwide, contributing significantly across different sectors.\nPhilanthropy and Activism\nChief Dumo Lulu-Briggs, the son of the late High Chief Olu Benson Lulu-Briggs, is a significant figure within the family. He serves as the chairman and CEO of DLB Group, a conglomerate with diverse interests in the oil, gas, and marine industries. In addition, he is the chairman of Platform Petroleum Limited, an oil exploration and prospecting company. His leadership roles extend to his former positions as chairman of the governing council at the Maritime Academy of Nigeria, Oron, and as chairman of the board of management at the Federal Medical Centre, Owerri.\nHis father, High Chief O.B. Lulu-Briggs, founded Moni Pulo Petroleum Development Company (MPPDC) in 1992, an oil exploration firm. Additionally, he was involved in Krakrama Investment Limited alongside Solate Lulu-Briggs, his daughter, and was also involved in Lubrick Construction Company Limited.\nHigh Chief O.B. Lulu-Briggs was also a revered elder statesman, politician, trade unionist, businessman, and philanthropist who established the O.B. Lulu-Briggs Foundation, which continues to make significant contributions to the welfare of the less privileged.\nAnn-Kio Briggs, another notable family member, is an environmentalist and human rights activist. She founded the non-governmental organization Agape Birthrights and has served as the spokesperson for the Ijaw Republican Assembly (IRA) and the United Niger Delta Energy Development Security Strategy (UNDEDSS) as of 2011. Her advocacy work has made her a significant voice in environmental justice and the rights of the Ijaw people.\nBusiness and Leadership\nHon. Victor Tubotamuno Abiye Briggs is a significant figure within the Briggs family, recognized for his leadership as the CEO of Vic-Briggs Nigeria Limited and his influential role as a political stakeholder in Abonnema City, located in the Akuku-Toru Local Government Area of Rivers State. His contributions highlight the family's continued impact in both business and politics within the region.\nAdditionally, the late Professor Nimi Briggs made significant contributions to the educational sector as a professor emeritus at the University of Port Harcourt. He also served as the second Pro-Chancellor of the Federal University Lokoja and chairman of the university's governing council, leaving a lasting impact on Nigerian higher education.\nAnother notable member of the Briggs family is Dr Ine Briggs. As of 2024, Dr. Briggs serves as the Acting Director General of the Rivers State Bureau on Public Procurement. She is a distinguished certified engineer with the Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN) and a seasoned Project Management Professional (PMP). With over 24 years of experience, Dr. Ine Briggs brings a wealth of expertise and knowledge to her role.\nChief Dumo Lulu-Briggs, a key member of the family, is the current head of the Oruwari-Briggs House (Iniikeiroari VI). He continues to uphold and build upon the legacy of his father, High Chief O.B. Lulu-Briggs. High Chief O.B. Lulu-Briggs was a towering figure, serving as the Paramount Head of the Oruwari-Briggs War-Canoe House of Abonnema, and holding esteemed titles such as Iniikeiroari V of Kalabari Kingdom and Oruwari VI. His leadership and contributions laid a strong foundation for the family's ongoing prominence.\nFollowing the death  of High Chief O.B. Lulu-Briggs in late 2018, his wife, Dr. (Mrs.) Seinye O.B. Lulu-Briggs, has emerged as chairman and chief executive of Moni Pulo Limited (MPL), guiding the company with the same visionary approach that her late husband was known for.\nDr. Seinye's career began in the Computer Department of the Central Bank of Nigeria, where she honed the skills that would later propel her to success in the private sector.\nRecognized as one of Africa's top 20 most influential women, Dr. Seinye O.B. Lulu-Briggs has made substantial contributions to the Nigerian economy.\nShe is the driving force behind La Sien Bottling Company, which produces premium beverages, including the well-known La Sien Premium Bottled Water. Additionally, she oversees Rachael Hotels Limited and Soliyama Limited, a company that specializes in haulage, asset-leasing, and manpower management, particularly within the oil and gas industry.\nLegacy and Influence\nThe late High Chief O.B. Lulu-Briggs held a profound connection to both the Kalabari Kingdom and the broader Niger Delta region. His state burial was a monumental event, drawing a host of dignitaries from the political, royal, and business spheres, including the 14th President of Nigeria, His Excellency Dr. Goodluck Jonathan (GCFR, GCON), King Dandeson Douglas Jaja (V) of Opobo, former Nigerian First Lady, Her Excellency Hajia Aisha Buhari, and the former Rivers State Governor, His Excellency Nyesom Wike. The presence of these distinguished figures highlights the significant influence and respect the Briggs family commands in Nigeria.\nThe Briggs family's legacy is defined by its unwavering commitment to the region, playing a pivotal role in shaping the cultural, political, and economic landscape of Rivers State, the Ijaw tribe, and the entire Niger Delta region.\nControversy surrounding the Oruwari-Briggs House\nFollowing the passing of High Chief O.B. Lulu-Briggs, the Oruwari-Briggs House became embroiled in a significant controversy that has attracted widespread attention. The dispute centers around his wife, Dr. Seinye O.B. Lulu-Briggs, and her late husband's sons, particularly the elder sons—Senibo Lulu-Briggs, Dumo Lulu-Briggs, and Sofiri Lulu-Briggs. This conflict has created a deep rift within the family and delayed the burial of the esteemed High Chief.\nDr. Seinye alleges that her late husband's sons are obstructing her from performing the burial rites, accusing them of harassment and attempts to undermine her role as the widow. The sons, led by Dumo Lulu-Briggs, have accused Dr. Seinye of being responsible for their father's death, a charge that has further fueled the family feud. The sons reportedly have the backing of some of the compound chiefs in Abonnema, creating a divide between them and Dr. Seinye, who has the support of her four children and has been closely associated with High Chief O.B. Lulu-Briggs for the past two decades.\nDespite interventions from prominent figures, including the Amanayabo of Kalabari Kingdom, King Theophilus J.T. Princewill, Amachree XI, who established a committee to mediate the issue, the controversy persisted. Burial dates were repeatedly set and then canceled at the last minute, exacerbating tensions.\nThe conflict also extended to the legal realm, where the sons sought to halt the reading of High Chief O.B. Lulu-Briggs’ will, claiming it contained specific instructions regarding his funeral. They obtained an injunction from a court in Rivers State to stop the will's reading and later introduced another will purportedly drafted by their father in 2003. This move added another layer of complexity to the already contentious situation.\nIn June 2019, the conflict took a dramatic turn when Dr. Seinye was detained by the Nigerian Immigration Service upon her return from an overseas trip. Her passport was seized, and she was held for hours before being released, thanks to her lawyer's intervention. This incident, along with a previous detention by police from the Force Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (FCIID) in Abuja, where Dr. Seinye was held for five hours, was seen by many as part of a broader effort to intimidate her by her stepsons.\nThe roots of this controversy trace back to the early 2000s when the elder sons of High Chief O.B. Lulu-Briggs and other siblings took legal action against their father in multiple courts, including those in Abuja, Lagos, Houston, and London, in a bid to seize control of Moni Pulo Limited, the family's oil exploration company. However, High Chief O.B. Lulu-Briggs successfully defended his position in court, leading to two settlements in which he symbolically “bought” the purported shares of his three eldest sons—Senibo, Dumo, and Sofiri. The agreements stipulated that the sons would relinquish their claims to the company in perpetuity.\nNow, following High Chief O.B. Lulu-Briggs’ death, the sons appear to be renewing their efforts to claim their father's assets, a move Dr. Seinye believes is aimed at pushing her aside and disregarding the interests of the family's other children. This ongoing dispute has not only delayed the burial of High Chief O.B. Lulu-Briggs but has also cast a shadow over the legacy of the Oruwari-Briggs House, one of the most prominent families in the Niger Delta.\nPolitics\nThe Briggs family has been a powerful influence in the political landscape of Rivers State for many years. Their involvement spans various significant roles, reflecting their deep-rooted commitment to public service and leadership.\nRoseberry Robinson Briggs (1925–2013) was a distinguished Nigerian politician and a notable member of the Briggs family. As a member of the National Party of Nigeria, he made significant contributions to the political landscape of Rivers State. Briggs served as the first Speaker of the Rivers State House of Assembly, holding the position for two consecutive terms from 1979 to 1987.\nIn 2015, Tonye Briggs-Oniyide made notable contributions as the Rivers State Commissioner for Culture and Tourism under former Governor Nyesom Wike, where she played a key role in promoting the state's cultural heritage and tourism potential.\nHon. Victor Tubotamuno Abiye Briggs has also been an influential political figure, particularly in Abonnema City within the Akuku-Toru Local Government Area, where he has been a key stakeholder in local governance and political decision-making.\nChief Dumo Lulu-Briggs, another prominent member of the family, has actively pursued political leadership on a larger scale. He ran for the governorship of Rivers State in the 2019 elections under the National Democratic Party and again in the 2023 elections under the Accord Party. His repeated candidacy underscores the family's enduring influence and continued ambition to shape the political future of Rivers State.\nReferences"
