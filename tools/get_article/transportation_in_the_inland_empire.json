The only exception is the segment of the Foothill Freeway, State Route 210 (SR 210) between San Dimas and San Bernardino, completed in July 2007.\nIn general, most of the higher paying jobs are located in Los Angeles and Orange County. Thus, workers must commute daily up to two hours in each direction on the existing network. As the population increases, traffic congestion is also projected to increase. In 2007, Forbes magazine ranked the area first in its list of America's most unhealthy commutes, beating every other major metropolitan area in the country, as Inland area drivers breathe the unhealthiest air and have the highest rate of fatal auto accidents per capita.\nFreeway system\n]]\nSan Bernardino.]]\nThe Inland Empire is crossed by two interstates and several major state highways. Although major freeway construction was finished years ago (except for the recent completion of SR 210 from Fontana to San Bernardino), growth in the region has strained the freeway system. As a result, several major projects have recently been completed or are underway on freeways throughout the region. Examples include the 60/215/91 interchange and widening of I-10 through Redlands as well as the currently ongoing widening of I-215 through Downtown San Bernardino into the city's University District.\n* State Route 2\n* San Bernardino Freeway (Interstate 10)\n* Mojave Freeway/Barstow Freeway/Ontario Freeway/Corona Freeway/Temecula Valley Freeway/Escondido Freeway (Interstate 15)\n* State Route 18\n* State Route 38\n* Needles Freeway (Interstate 40)\n* State Route 58\n* Pomona Freeway/Moreno Valley Freeway (State Route 60)\n* State Route 62\n* State Route 66\n* Corona Expressway/Chino Valley Freeway (State Route 71)\n* State Route 74\n* State Route 78\n* State Route 79\n* State Route 83\n* State Route 86\n* Riverside Freeway (State Route 91)\n* U.S. Route 95\n* State Route 111\n* State Route 127\n* State Route 138\n* State Route 142\n* State Route 173\n* State Route 177\n* State Route 178\n* State Route 189\n* Foothill Freeway (State Route 210)\n* Barstow Freeway/San Bernardino Freeway/Riverside Freeway/Moreno Valley Freeway/Escondido Freeway (Interstate 215)\n* State Route 243\n* State Route 247\n* State Route 259\n* State Route 330\n* State Route 371\n* U.S. Route 395\n* County Route R2\n* County Route R3\nPublic transportation\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; width:150px;\"\n|-\n|240px\n|240px\n|-\n|Downtown San Bernardino's Civic Center Station on the rapid transit sbX's Green Line.
