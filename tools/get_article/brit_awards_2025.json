The ceremony took place on Saturday 1 March 2025 at The O2 Arena in London. Jack Whitehall hosted the ceremony for the fifth time, returning as host after the 2021 ceremony.\nFor this year's ceremony, Charli XCX led the nominations with five, including British Album of the Year, Song of the Year and British Artist of the Year. Dua Lipa, the Last Dinner Party and Ezra Collective followed with four nominations each. The Beatles were nominated for Song of the Year for their \"final song\" \"Now and Then\", being their first nomination since 1983 where they were honoured with the Outstanding Contribution to Music award. Similarly, the Cure, who received three nominations including British Album of the Year for Songs of a Lost World (their first album in 16 years after 2008's 4:13 Dream), were nominated for an award for the first time since 1993.\nBackground\nTrophy\nThe designer for this year's trophy was artist Gabriel Moses. The sculpture was inspired by Moses' Nigerian heritage as well as his upbringing in South London.\nBrits Week 2025\nIn order to promote the awards ceremony and support the charity War Child, the BPI hosted a number of gigs as part of Brits Week.
