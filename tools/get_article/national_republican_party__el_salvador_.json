The party joined a coalition with Arturo Araujo's Labor Party during the 1931 general election. The coalition failed to win a majority but Araujo was elected president by the Legislative Assembly and Maximiliano Hernández Martínez became vice president.\nThe party was dissolved following the 1931 Salvadoran coup d'état but was later turned into the National Pro Patria Party.\nElectoral history\nPresidential elections\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!
