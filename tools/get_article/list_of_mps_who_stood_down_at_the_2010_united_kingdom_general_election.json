This has been attributed to the expenses scandal and the fact that redundancy-style payments for departing MPs may be scrapped after the election.\nIn all, 149 MPs (100 Labour, 35 Conservatives, seven Liberal Democrats, two independents, one Independent Conservative and one member each from Plaid Cymru, the Scottish National Party, the Democratic Unionist Party, and Social Democratic and Labour Party) announced that they would not be contesting the next election. In four of these cases a sitting MP was not selected by their Constituency Labour Party to stand.\nIn addition, three seats were vacant at the dissolution of Parliament on 12 April 2010, where the sitting MP had died or resigned and no by-election had been held.\nMPs who were de-selected, barred from standing or defeated in selection\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|Party\n!Name\n!Constituency\n!Year elected\n!Reason for not standing\n!Replaced as MP by\n!colspan=2|Party\n|-\n! rowspan=8 style=\"background-color: \" |\n| rowspan=8|Labour Party\n|David Chaytor\n|Bury North\n|1997\n|Barred from standing due to United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal\n|David Nuttall\n! rowspan=1 style=\"background-color: \" |\n| rowspan=1|Conservative Party\n|-\n|Jim Devine\n|Livingston\n|2005\n|Barred from standing due to United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal\n|Graeme Morrice\n! rowspan=1 style=\"background-color: \" |\n| rowspan=1|Labour Party\n|-\n|Anne Moffat\n|East Lothian\n|2001\n|De-selected\n|Fiona O'Donnell\n! rowspan=1 style=\"background-color: \" |\n| rowspan=1|Labour Party\n|-\n|Edward O'Hara\n|Knowsley South\n|1990\n|Defeated in selection process by fellow MP George Howarth\n|George Howarth\n! rowspan=1 style=\"background-color: \" |\n| rowspan=1|Labour Party\n|-\n|Margaret Moran\n|Luton South\n|1997\n|Barred from standing due to United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal\n|Gavin Shuker\n! rowspan=1 style=\"background-color: \" |\n| rowspan=1|Labour Party\n|-\n|The Right Honourable Elliot Morley\n|Scunthorpe\n|1987\n|Barred from standing due to United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal\n|Nic Dakin\n! rowspan=1 style=\"background-color: \" |\n| rowspan=1|Labour Party\n|-\n|Ian Stewart\n|Eccles\n|1997\n|Defeated in selection process by fellow MP Hazel Blears\n|Hazel Blears\n! rowspan=1 style=\"background-color: \" |\n| rowspan=1|Labour Party\n|-\n|Bob Wareing\n|Liverpool West Derby\n|1983\n|De-selected\n|Stephen Twigg\n! rowspan=1 style=\"background-color: \" |\n| rowspan=1|Labour Party\n|-\n! rowspan=1 style=\"background-color: \" |\n| rowspan=1|Conservative\n|John Greenway\n|Ryedale\n|1987\n|Defeated in selection process by fellow MP Anne McIntosh\n|Anne McIntosh\n! rowspan=1 style=\"background-color: \" |\n| rowspan=1|Conservative Party\n|-\n|}\nLabour\nLabour's National Executive Committee (NEC) barred five MPs from standing as official Labour Party candidates at the 2010 general election in the wake of the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal.  However, they could stand as independent candidates. Three of these MPs, David Chaytor, Margaret Moran and Elliot Morley, stated that they would be standing down as MPs. Another, Ian Gibson, resigned his seat, causing a by-election in Norwich North that was won by Conservative candidate Chloe Smith. The fifth, Jim Devine, hinted either at forcing a by-election or standing for re-election as an independent, but ended up standing down.\nThe East Lothian Labour Party voted on 19 March 2010 to deselect their MP, Anne Moffat, who appealed the decision the NEC, which rejected her appeal. Moffat chose to stand down at the general election, and it was revealed that she had been negotiating a pension based on retirement with a health condition at the same time she was fighting the deselection.\nList of Labour MPs standing down:\n# Hilary Armstrong — North West Durham, announced 4 July 2009\n# John Austin — Erith and Thamesmead, announced 31 July 2008\n# John Battle — Leeds
