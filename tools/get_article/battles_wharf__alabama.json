It was originally known as Yarborough, possibly in honor of a local family. The name was then changed to Dadeville to honor R. R. Dade. The name later changed to Battles, but due to another community in Alabama having a similar name, it was then renamed Narcissus, in honor of the figure from Greek mythology. Finally, the community became known as Battles Wharf. A post office operated under the name Battles from 1875 to 1903, under the name Narcissus from 1903 to 1904, and under the name Battles Wharf from 1904 to 1961.\nReferences"
