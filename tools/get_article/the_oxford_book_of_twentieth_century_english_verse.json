It was published in 1973 by Oxford University Press with . Larkin writes in the short preface that the selection is wide rather than deep; and also notes that for the post-1914 period it is more a collection of poems, than of poets. The remit was limited by him to poets with a period of residence in the British Isles. Larkin's generous selection of Thomas Hardy's poems has been noted for its influence on Hardy's later reputation. On the other hand, he was criticized, notably by Donald Davie, for his inclusion of \"pop\" poets such as Brian Patten. The volume contains works by 207 poets.\nContributing poets\nReferences"
