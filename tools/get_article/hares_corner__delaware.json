Hares Corner is located at the intersection of U.S. Route 13/U.S. Route 40 and Delaware Route 273, west of New Castle and immediately south of Wilmington Airport.\nHistory\nThe community was once a stagecoach stop and a cattle market. Hares Corner was home to the Green Tree Inn, which was demolished in 1931 to allow US 13 to be widened to a divided highway.\nThe Hares Corner post office operated from 1863 to 1891. According to historian Harvey Cochran Bounds, the 1890 opening of the post office at nearby Farnhurst \"had more than a little to do\" with the closure of the Hares Corner post office. In 1890, Hares Corner's population was 50. In the 1920s, Hares Corner was the site of fox hunting; these events were hosted by the Hares Corner Community Club.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
