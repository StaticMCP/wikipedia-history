Described as \"a very brave and attractive strokemaker\" as well as \"a good off-spinner\", Ward was also a skilled fielder both close to the wicket and in the outfield. He was one of the shortest players in county cricket, at around five feet three inches tall.\nHis career best with the bat was 86, against Somerset in 1956. With the ball he took his career-best 7 for 60 against Lancashire in 1962, when he bowled Glamorgan to a 12-run victory in the second-last match of his career. He also served in the British Armed Forces, playing for British Army and Royal Artillery teams in 1953.\nAfter leaving Glamorgan at the end of the 1962 season he worked for a transport company in South Wales.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
