For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign. Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\". Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\nAll modern acts have a short title, e.g. the Local Government Act 2003. Some earlier acts also have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n48 & 49 Vict.\nContinuing the sixth session of the 22nd Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 23 October 1884 until 14 August 1885.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  applies.|note4= }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  and the East Indian Railway (Redemption of Annuities) Act, 1881; and for other purposes.}}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n-\n|  as regards the establishment of a Sinking Fund.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  in relation to Ships and Port Sanitary Authorities.}}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  and to reduce for a like period the Permanent Annual Charge of the National Debt.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  office accommodation for officers appointed under the said Act.|note4= }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  with respect to the Members and Officers of Local Authorities.}}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  in relation to the Pensions of Clerks of the Crown and Clerks of the Peace.}}\n|\n| or the Ashbourne Act|public|73|14-08-1885|archived=n|An Act to provide greater facilities for the Sale of Land to occupying Tenants in Ireland.}}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and for other purposes connected with Labourers Dwellings in Ireland.}}\n|\n|\n|\n}}\nLocal acts\n|po2=Honiton Order 1885|Provisional Order for partially repealing, altering, and amending a Local Act.\n|po3=Mansfield Order 1885|Provisional Order for altering and amending the Mansfield Commissioners Gas Act, 1878.\n|po4=Milford Order 1885|Provisional Order for altering and amending the Milford Improvement Act, 1857.\n|po5=Stockton Order 1885|Provisional Order for altering and amending the Stockton Gas Act, 1857, and the Stockton Gas Act, 1873. }}\n|  as amended and extended by the Poor Law Act, 1879, relating to the Parishes of Corwen, Dolbenmaen, Ewenny, Gwyddelwern Llanfihangel-y-Pennant, Llangar, Llanharan, Llanilid, Mathern, Penmorfa, St. Bride's Major, Saint Pierre and Runstone, and Yspytty Ystwith; and to the Township of Lower Gwnnws.|po1=Ewenny and Saint Bride's Major Order 1885|Bridgend and Cowbridge Union.\n|po2=Llanharan and Llanilid Order 1885|Bridgend and Cowbridge Union.\n|po3=Mathern and Saint Pierre and Runstone Order 1885|Chepstow Union.\n|po4=Corwen, Gwyddelwern, and Llangar Order 1885|Corwen Union.\n|po5=Dolbenmaen, Llanfihangel y Pennant, and Penmorfa Order 1885|Festiniog Union.\n|po6=Lower Gwnnws and Yspytty Ystwith Order 1885|Tregaron Union.}}\n|\n|  and the Acts amending the same, relating to the Upper Morning Star Drainage District, county Limerick, and the Cashen River Drainage District, county Kerry.|po1=In the matter of the Upper Morning Star Drainage District, in the county of Limerick.|po1short=n|\n|po2=In the matter of the Cashen River Drainage District, in the County of Kerry.|po2short=n|}}\n|  as amended and extended by the Poor Law Act, 1879, relating to the Parishes of Aller, Barrington, Berecrocombe, Camerton, Curry Mallet, Curry Rivall, Drayton, Dunkerton, Earnshill, Fivehead, High Ham, Huish Episcopi, Isle Abbots, Isle Brewers, Kingsbury Episcopi, Kingsdon, Long Sutton, North and Mid Littleton, Pitney, Puckington, Somerton, South Littleton, and Swell.|po1=Camerton and Dunkerton Order 1885|Bath and Clutton Unions.\n|po2=North and Mid Littleton and South Littleton Order 1885|Evesham Union.\n|po3=Aller, &c.
