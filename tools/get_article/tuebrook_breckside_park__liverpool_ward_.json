The Tuebrook Breckside Park ward was created as a single-member ward from the north-western portion of the former Tuebrook and Stoneycroft ward and a small portion of the former Anfield ward. The ward boundaries follow Townsend Lane, the Canada Dock Branch line, West Derby Road, Belmont Road, Belmont Grove, behind Ellencliff Drive and Sedley Street.}}\nNotes\nReferences"
