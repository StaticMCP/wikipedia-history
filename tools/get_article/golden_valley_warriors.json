He was shot multiple times outside his residence in Mayangone Township while returning from a gym session.\nCho Tun Aung had previously served in Myanmar’s Tatmadaw, and was active as a political science lecturer after his diplomatic career. He was also a member of the country’s War Veterans Organization. According to the Golden Valley Warriors, Cho Tun Aung played a key role in training military cadres and supporting the junta’s counterinsurgency efforts.\nThe assassination was claimed by the Golden Valley Warriors group, who stated that his activities directly contributed to military operations targeting resistance groups. Myanmar's state-run media later confirmed his death, underscoring the severity of the attack.\nObservers viewed the assassination as a psychological blow to the junta and a sign of growing sophistication among urban guerrilla forces.\nBetween 23–29 May 2025, SAC's security forces arrested 16 individuals, including a six-year-old girl, allegedly connected to the assassination plot. This group purportedly included the gunman Myo Ko Ko, his family, a hospital owner accused of treating him, and community members involved in providing support or coverage for the act.\nSee also\n*Timeline of the Myanmar civil war (2021–present)\nReferences\nExternal links"
