However the other USAAF support commands (Air Technical Service Command (ATSC); Air Transport Command (ATC) or Troop Carrier Command) commanded a significant number of airfields in a support roles.\nIt is still possible to find remnants of these wartime airfields. Many were converted into municipal airports, some were returned to agriculture and several were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.\nMajor airfields\nAir Transport Command\n* Bismarck MAP, Bismarck\n: Joint use USAAF/Civil Airport\n: Now: Bismarck Municipal Airport\n* Fargo MAP, Fargo\n: Joint use USAAF/Civil Airport\n: Now: Hector International Airport\n: And:  Fargo Air National Guard Base\n* Port O'Minot, Minot, North Dakota\n: Joint use US Navy/USAAF/Civil Airport\n: Now: Minot International Airport\n:: Note: Minot Air Force Base (1957-Present) is NOT this facility.\nArmy Air Force Training Command\n* Grand Forks Municipal Airport, Grand Forks\n: Joint use USAAF/Civil Airport\n: Contract Pilot School\n: Non aviation use, redeveloped and part of urban area of Grand Forks.\n:: Note: Grand Forks Air Force Base (1957-Present) is NOT this facility.\nReferences\n* Maurer, Maurer (1983).
