Zavagli was immediately wounded and died on the boat, which was hastily trying to get out to sea while the rest of the crew fired wildly to cover their escape. Bertorello was hit by the Somalis while working on the anchor; he suffered wounds, which caused him to die shortly after, he jumped into the water to free the propeller from its mooring where it had become entangled due to the disaster.Upon return, their boat was studded in arrows, and Lieutenant Zavagli's body in a pool of blood, his head decapitated.\nThe death of Carlo Zavagli is one of the many \"incidents\" that stalled italian ambitions in Somalia.\nSomali response\nSheekh Ahmed Gabyow, also known as Sheekh Gabyow, recited this poem at the end of June 1891 after the battles of Cadale and Warsheikh killing the Lieutenant Carlo Zavagli, along with 60 Italian colonial troops said to have been the first call for Somali nationalism.\nAfter another Italian defeat at Lafoole 1896, dubbed the \"Somali Adwa\" by the Italians, resulting in the death of Italian Consul General Antonio Cecchi, the most important expeditionist and fervent promoter of the Italian Colonial Administration, Italian ships bombed the coasts of Nimmo and Jasira before withdrawing to their limited areas of influence on the coast for some years.\nSee also\n* Italian-Somali Wars\n* Banadir resistance\n* Hiraab Imamate\n* Hawiya\nBibliography\n* Finaldi, Giuseppe (2016).
