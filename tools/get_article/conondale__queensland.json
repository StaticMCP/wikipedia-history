The town is located on the banks of the upper Mary River,  north of the state capital, Brisbane.\nHistory\nOn 6 October 1851, pastoralist Donald Tuach McKenzie took up a pastoral run, which he named Conondale after hist birthplace on the Conon River in Ross and Cromarty, Scotland. The town takes its name from the pastoral run.\nIn November 1906, a sub-division of the former Conondale Station, the Conondale Estate, described as 14,000 acres in one of the best agricultural and dairying districts in the Commonwealth, was advertised for sale. The auctioneers offered to forward an illustrated lithograph to any address. As a new departure in the sub-division of estates, a butter factory was built by the vendors as part of the sale. However, the butter factory never operated and the building was later demolished, with the timbers used for the construction of a house at Moffat Beach.\nConondale Provisional School and Flagstone Creek Provisional Schools opened in September 1912, both on a half-time basis, meaning that a single teacher was shared between the two schools. In 1913, Flagstone Creek Provisional School was renamed Conondale South Provisional School. In 1915, Conondale South Provisional School was closed and Conondale Provisional School continued with the teacher on a full-time basis. It experienced occasional closures due to lack of students or unavailability of a teacher. In 1933, it became Conondale State School.\nIn 1919, the Landsborough Shire Council decided to set aside  of land as a memorial park in Conondale, but later decided on a larger more convenient site, which was officially opened on 3 March 1928.\nConondale Post Office opened by 1949 (a receiving office or Telegraph office had been open from 1904) and closed in 1974.\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Conondale had a population of 858 people.\nIn the , the locality of Conondale had a population of 882 people.\nHeritage listings\nConondale has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* Conondale Timbers Sawmill, Aherns Road\nEducation\nConondale State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 1700 Maleny-Kenilworth Road ().
