It is handed out by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), an organisation whose aim is \"to advance the interests of the Australian record industry.\" A previous category, Best Urban Release, was split into Best Soul/R&B Release and Best Hip Hop Release, which were first presented in 2019.\nTo be eligible, the work must be within the hip-hop genre. The nominated release must qualify for inclusion in the ARIA Album Chart, and cannot be entered in any other genre categories. The accolade is voted for by a judging school, which comprises between 40 and 100 members of representatives experienced in this genre, and is given to an artist who is either from Australia or an Australian resident. The award for Best Hip Hop Release was first presented to Sampa the Great for the single, \"Final Form\".\nWinners and nominees\nIn the following table, the winner is highlighted in a separate colour, and in boldface; the nominees are those that are not highlighted or in boldface.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"19%\" | Winner(s)\n! width=\"19%\" | Album/single title\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" | 2019\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| Sampa the Great\n| \"Final Form\"\n|-\n| Baker Boy\n| \"Cool as Hell\"\n|-\n| Hilltop Hoods\n| The Great Expanse\n|-\n| Illy\n| \"Then What\"\n|-\n| Tkay Maidza featuring JPEGMafia\n| \"Awake\"\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" | 2020\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| Sampa the Great\n| The Return\n|-\n| Baker Boy featuring JessB\n| \"Meditjin\"\n|-\n| Briggs\n| Always Was\n|-\n| Illy\n| \"Last Laugh\"\n|-\n| The Kid Laroi\n| F*ck Love\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" | 2021\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| Genesis Owusu\n| Smiling with No Teeth\n|-\n| B Wise\n| jamie\n|-\n| Masked Wolf\n| \"Astronaut in the Ocean\"\n|-\n| The Kid Laroi\n| \"Without You\"\n|-\n| Youngn Lipz\n| Area Baby\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" | 2022\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| Baker Boy\n| Gela\n|-\n| Barkaa\n| Blak Matriarchy\n|-\n| Chillinit\n| Family Ties\n|-\n| Day1 (featuring Kahukx)\n| \"Mbappé\"\n|-\n| The Kid Laroi and Fivio Foreign\n| \"Paris to Tokyo\"\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" | 2023\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| Genesis Owusu\n| Struggler\n|-\n| Kahukx\n| \"Nothing to Something\"\n|-\n| Kerser\n| A Gift & a Kers\n|-\n| Onefour (featuring CG)\n| \"Comma's\"\n|-\n| Tkay Maidza and Flume\n| \"Silent Assassin\"\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" | 2024\n|-style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| 3%\n| Kill the Dead\n|-\n| Kobie Dee\n| Chapter 26\n|-\n| Lithe\n| \"Fall Back\"\n|-\n| Onefour\n| \"Natural Habitat\"\n|-\n| The Kid Laroi\n| The First Time [Deluxe Version]\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
