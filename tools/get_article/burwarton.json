Local governance is provided through the 'grouped' Parish Council for Aston Botterill, Burwarton and Cleobury North.  The Parish falls within the Brown Clee Division of the Shropshire Unitary Council. There is no village meeting place, but the combined parishes share the facilities of the Village Hall at Cleobury North.  The Burwarton Parish embraces most of the 'home estate' around Burwarton House.  This rises westward from the main Bridgnorth-Ludlow road, passing north–south through the village,  up to the ridge summit of Brown Clee Hill.\nNotable Landmarks and Events: nearby are Burwarton Cottage owned by the Scout organisation and Wenlock hills.  The Shropshire Way passes along the western border of the parish close to the Brown Clee summit.  Orienteering and Mountain Bike events take place periodically. The famous annual Burwarton Show has its offices here.  The show is actually held in the adjacent village of Cleobury North.  Public Footpaths criss-cross the parish and the Boyne Estate. Burwarton Parish Church is now a private residence.\nBurwarton House is the seat of Viscount Boyne, whose family gives their name to the village pub, the Boyne Arms.  Hiking route information is also available from links on the website of the Boyne Arms at  [http://boynearms.co.uk]\nSee also\n*Listed buildings in Burwarton\nReferences\nExternal links"
