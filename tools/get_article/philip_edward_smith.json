After graduating with a PhD in Anatomy from Cornell University in 1912, he joined the Department of Anatomy, Berkeley California until 1926. From 1927 to 1952 he served as Professor of Anatomy at the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University. He served as the 24th president of the Association of American Anatomists from 1940 to 1942. He became a research associate at Stanford University, where he published his last paper in 1963.\nWorks include\n*\"Hypophysectomy and Replacement Therapy in the rat\"\n*\"The disabilities caused by hypophysectomy and their repair\"\nReferences\n*Severinghaus AE, \"A memorial resolution for Philip Edward Smith\" Am J Anat. 1972 Oct;135(2):159-64\n*Agate FJ Sr, \"Philip Edward Smith. 1884–1970\" Anat Rec. 1971 Sep;171(1):134-6.\n*Christy NP, \"Philip Edward Smith PhD.
