The safe seat was held by the Conservative candidate Bob Benzen on an increased majority.\nThe by-election was scheduled to coincide with four others across the country, and was one of two to be held in the city of Calgary; Calgary Midnapore.\nBackground\nConstituency\nCalgary Heritage covers the southwestern corner of Calgary.The electoral district was created for the 2015 federal election and has had Harper as its only MP; however, it is largely composed of the former riding of Calgary Southwest which was held by conservative parties throughout its existence.\nCampaign\nThe riding of Calgary Heritage became vacant when former Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper resigned his seat on August 26, 2016, to return to private life, including accepting directorships on corporate boards and establishing a consultancy firm.\nThe by-election was announced on February 22, 2017. The Speaker's warrant regarding the vacancy was received on August 29, 2016. The last day a by-election could have been announced was February 25, 2017, with an election held at least 36 days after being announced.\nCandidates\nBob Benzen, a small business owner and member of the Calgary Heritage Conservative Association defeated Rick Billington, a lawyer and the former president of the Calgary Heritage Conservative Association, and city prosecutor Paul Frank for the Conservative nomination, which was decided on October 23. Former Calgary Centre MP Joan Crockatt, party insider Alan Hallman, former Medicine Hat MP Monte Solberg, and Dan Williams, a former staffer to Calgary Midnapore MP Jason Kenney, all declined to run for the nomination despite speculation to the contrary. Ric McIver, leader of the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta and MLA for Calgary-Hays, stated that he would not run.\nRumoured candidates for the Liberal nomination included physician Brendan Miles, the 2015 candidate in this riding, Chima Nkemdirim, the chief of staff to Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi, and former Conservative MP Lee Richardson. On February 8, 2017, the Liberal nomination was won by physician Scott Forsyth, defeating Steven Turner and Kanwar Gill.\nKhalis Ahmed won the uncontested NDP nomination.\nTaryn Knorren defeated Brennan Wauters for the Green Party of Canada nomination.\nThe Libertarian candidate was Darcy Gerow.\nBusinesswoman and former ''Dragons' Den'' star Arlene Dickinson was considered a potential candidate until she declined interest on January 22. Dickinson stated she had supported parts of both Conservative and Liberal platforms in the past, but considers herself non-partisan.\nResults\n2015 results\nReferences\nSee also\n* 2023 Calgary Heritage federal by-election"
