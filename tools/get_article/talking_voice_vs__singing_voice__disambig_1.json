It was released on April 12, 2005 by Tooth & Nail Records.\nIts sound is very different from the band's early work, which was characterized by loud guitars and a \"wall of sound.\" The album includes string arrangements on several tracks and a trumpet on the song \"Easy Street.\" Most of the album has a relaxed attitude, except for the song \"Good Sons,\" which has an upbeat, dance-like sound.\nCritical reception\nExclaim! wrote: \"Making above average, semplice rock for 12 years, Starflyer 59 haven't really changed much.\" Paste wrote that \"the vocal monotony truly is a shame because [Jason] Martin’s compositions are often warmly seductive.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n*Jason Martin – guitar, singing\n*Frank Lenz – drum kit, string arrangements\n*Nicole Garcia – violin\n*Briana Dandy – viola\n*Ginger Murphy – cello\n*Dirk Lemmenes – bass guitar\n*Matt Fronke – trumpet\nReferences"
