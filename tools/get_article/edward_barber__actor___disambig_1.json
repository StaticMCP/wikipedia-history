Barber placed his education on hold when he joined Pinoy Big Brother.\nCareer\nBarber was sixteen when he was asked to audition online for Pinoy Big Brother after staff from The Filipino Channel took a photo of him in a Dolce Amore event in Germany. He succeeded in joining and was later introduced as the first contestant of the show. Barber was later announced as a semi-finalist on the show and had to temporarily exit due to the program's format. Meanwhile, Barber, together with the other semi-finalists, Maymay Entrata, and Kisses Delavin, took part in an online reality series called Follow the Lucky 3 Teens, which follows their journey after momentarily exiting the house. The show's finale was held on March 5, 2017 at the Alonte Sports Arena where he was declared as one of the runners-up, with Entrata winning the competition.\nIn September 2017 Maymay Entrata and Edward Barber, popularly known with their loveteam \"MayWard\", played the lead roles for their debut film, Loving in Tandem, which was released nationwide on September 13, 2017. Right after, he got a cameo role in the box office hit film Seven Sundays.\nHe joined Maymay to make a teleserye debut on the television series La Luna Sangre.\nOther ventures\nPhilanthropy\nELM Tree Foundation, a charity organization founded by Barber, his sister Laura, and Entrata, was formally launched on December 19, 2017. It takes its name from the initials of their name.\nEndorsement\nFresh from Pinoy Big Brother house, he together with on-screen partner Maymay Entrata joined McDonald's family as the newest endorsers of the new Creamy McFreeze.
