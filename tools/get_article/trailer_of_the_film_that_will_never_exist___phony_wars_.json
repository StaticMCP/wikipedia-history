He wanted to get back to the old ways of making films, the ways he started out with, but with the distance of experience. It was January 2020, and as he made headway, I began the technical tests, but the Covid pandemic and series of lockdowns slammed the brakes down on our progress. Jean-Luc continued working on paper, developing successive versions of the script until he decided he wanted to make a trailer. It was a sort of snapshot of the film to come, a path that led back to its origins, and through it, the film already existed!\"\nRelease\nThe short film had its world premiere at the \"Cannes Classics\" section of the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, alongside a 4K restoration of Le Mépris (1963) and the French documentary Godard by Godard (2023), as a tribute to the filmmaker.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
