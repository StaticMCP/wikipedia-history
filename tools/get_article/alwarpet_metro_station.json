This metro station will be among the 30 stations of Corridor IV and 12 underground stations along Corridor IV of the Chennai Metro, Poonamallee Bypass–Lighthouse stretch. This metro station is slated to be commercialized on March 2027.\nHistory\nIn February 2021, Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) initiated the bidding process for the construction of this Alwarpet metro station, which falls within the underground stretch from Light House to Bharathidasan Road, forming part of Corridor 4 under Phase 2 of the Chennai Metro project.\nApart from this metro station, this package includes three other stations, namely Light House, Kutchery Road and Bharathidasan Road. The tender attracted competitive bids from major infrastructure firms including ITD Cementation India Ltd., Larsen & Toubro (L&T), Gulermak, Shanghai Tunnel Engineering Co. Ltd. (STEC), and a joint venture of J Kumar Infraprojects–Patel Infrastructure.\nAfter careful technical and financial assessment, ITD Cementation India Ltd. emerged as the lowest bidder and was awarded the contract. The company commenced civil construction activities, including site clearance and preparatory excavation, aligned with the project’s underground engineering specifications.\nStation layout\nStation Layout - To Be Confirmed\n| title-color = white\n| legend = track\n| collapsible = no\n| map = HSTg\\HSTf\nPSTR(L)\\PSTR(R) ~~ ~~ ~~ to   **\n*P#\\PSTR(L)\\PSTR(R)\\*P#\nPSTR(L)\\PSTR(R) ~~ ~~ ~~ to  **\nHSTg\\HSTf\n| bottom = Station with two tracks and one Island platform** Under Construction\n}}}}\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\"\n| width=\"30\" valign=\"top\" style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" |G\n| width=\"85\" valign=\"top\" style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" |Street level\n| width=\"500\" valign=\"top\" style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" |Exit/Entrance\n|-\n| style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" |L1\n| style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" |Mezzanine\n| style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" |Fare control, station agent, Ticket/token, shops\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" width=\"30\" valign=\"top\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" |L2\n| width=\"85\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px white;\" |Platform #Eastbound\n| width=\"500\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px white;\" |Towards → Next Station: Change at the next station for\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" |Island platform\n|-\n| width=\"85\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" |Platform #Westbound\n| width=\"500\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" |Towards ←  **Next Station:\n|-\n| style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=\"30\" valign=\"top\" |L2\n| style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=\"85\" valign=\"top\" |Note:\n| style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=\"500\" valign=\"top\" |** (Further extension to  in the future)\n|-\n|}\nEntry/Exit\nSee also\n* List of Chennai metro stations\n* Railway stations in Chennai\n* Transport in Chennai\n* Urban rail transit in India\n* List of metro systems\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.urbanrail.net UrbanRail.Net] – descriptions of all metro systems in the world, each with a schematic map showing all stations."
