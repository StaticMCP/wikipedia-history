They threatened the Ukrainian central authorities, saying that they reserved the right \"to ask for help from the brotherly people of the Russian Federation\". Pro-Russian citizens held a rally of up to 5,000 against the new government demanding a referendum on whether to join Russia.\n*There were reports of busloads of Russian citizens crossing the border into Ukraine to support pro-Russian demonstrators. At an administrative building in Kharkiv, a Russian from Moscow replaced the Ukrainian flag with a Russian one. Demonstrators supporting Russia vandalized the parliament building and beat civilians, but Reuters reported that this alienated many local ethnic Russians, who were speaking and mobilizing in support of the Ukrainian government. The flag was restored and 200 policemen guarded the building.\n*Protesters in Donetsk reportedly raised the Russian tricolor over the Donetsk Oblast Regional Administration building, in addition to electing a new pro-Russian governor. Demonstrators in Mariupol also protested in front of regional offices, waving Russian flags. According to Interfax, between 5,000 and 20,000 participated in a pro-Russian demonstration in Odesa. The city council of Donetsk voted on 1 March to have a referendum on the status of the region but lawmakers made no mention of what question would be asked or when.\n*In Zaporizhzhia 1,000–5,000 estimated protesters gathered to save the Lenin monument. They also protested against the Kyiv government and in support of Berkut troops and Soviet symbols.\n*Various Russian news media outlets began to use the term Russian Spring () to describe the protests.\n2 March\nIn Zaporizhzhia, over 5,000 protested against Russian intervention and pro-Russian demonstrations, and unity in Ukraine. They also protested against people seizing state buildings and raising Russian flags over them. Similar rallies were held in Dnipropetrovsk (a rally described by local reporters as the largest in years that drew an estimated 10,000 people), Odesa (several thousand), Mykolaiv (according to local media 5,000 to 10,000 people) and Kharkiv (a few thousand protesters).\n3 March\nSeveral hundred pro-Russian protesters led by Pavel Gubarev gathered at the  Donetsk Oblast administrative building, broke through police barricades and retook the facility, and raised the Russian flag. Pavel had claimed to be the people's governor of the region. Some 200–500 demonstrators with Russian flags, opponents of the new authorities in Kyiv, attempted to seize the Odesa Regional State Administration building. They demanded that a referendum on the establishment of an \"Odesa Autonomous Republic\" be held. As protesters began to break windows and enter the building, Oblast chairman and Party of Regions official Mykola Leonidovych Skoryk spoke to the crowd, saying that the police could not allow an \"assault\" on the RSA, and that Ukrainians \"must live peacefully in a single state.\" Protesters shouted \"traitor!\" and \"Judas!\" at him. Meanwhile, Reuters reported that anti-Kyiv protesters had broken into the first floor of the Donetsk RSA building.\n4 March\n]]\nPro-Russian separatists consolidated their control of the local Regional Administration in Donetsk. Pavel Gubarev was elected governor, and told reporters that work on the structure of the new administration is being done. \"We don't want to give our money any more to Kyiv. We want more freedom for our city in a new federation or confederation that allows us to embrace the friendly ties and positive feelings towards us of the people of Russia,\" Gubarev said. Allegations that many of the demonstrators were bussed in from Russia, specifically from the Rostov region, were levelled by opponents, but according to a local journalist, \"[I'm] sure they were paid to participate in those numbers but I have to say unfortunately that most of the people are from this city.\" \"Hundreds\" later protested peacefully against the pro-Russian RSA occupiers and in support of a united Ukraine. On the evening of 4 March, a large peaceful rally of over 2,000 supporting peace and a united Ukraine was held in central Donetsk.\n5 March\nIn Donetsk, a bomb threat forced the evacuation of the Regional Administration building, which forced out the pro-Russian activists who had been occupying the building and flying the Russian flag since 1 March. After the bomb-scare and subsequent evacuation, the Ukrainian flag was raised over the building for the first time since 1 March. However, later in the evening, hundreds of pro-Russian protesters retook the building, and once again raised the Russian flag. Despite the retaking of the RSA by pro-Russian activists, up to 5,000 protested for unity in Ukraine and against Russian intervention, the largest of its kind in the eastern Ukrainian city since the unrest began. 1,000 pro-Russia counter-protesters attempted to confront the Ukrainian unionists, but were kept apart by the police.|group = nb}} Ukrainian unionists were also protected by FC Shakhtar Donetsk \"ultras\"|group = nb}} (fanatical supporters). Meanwhile, 1,000 pro-Russian protesters marched in Kharkiv, demanding a referendum on federalism for Ukraine and making Russian a state language. Police kept the demonstrators away from the Kharkiv Oblast RSA building, which continues to fly the Ukrainian flag.\n200 people attended a pro-Russia rally in Zaporizhzhia.\n6 March\nAfter retaking the Donetsk RSA the previous day, pro-Russian protesters lost control of the building after a pre-dawn offensive led by police and the national Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), which is under the control of the Euromaidan leaders. In addition to capturing control of the RSA and hoisting the Ukrainian flag, the SBU arrested self-proclaimed new Donetsk governor and pro-Russian protest leader Pavel Gubarev, charging him with \"encroachment on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine\" as well as \"actions aimed at the forcible change or overthrow of the constitutional order, or the seizure of state power\". About 70 supporters of Gubarev were also arrested.\n9 March\n]]\n*Pro-Russian protesters stormed the Municipal Administration building in Luhansk, brought down the Ukrainian flag and hoisted the Russian one instead, urging authorities to hold a referendum over joining Russia. Meanwhile, Luhansk's governor Mykhailo Bolotskykh fled the city, and the protestors claimed a pro-Russian figure was elected as the city's new governor. Later in the day Bolotskih stated that he continued to carry out his duties and that his resignation was written under pressure and it had no legal force.\n*In Donetsk, 10,000 pro-Russian activists held a demonstration, while the authorities of Donetsk denounced the referendum on the status of the region.\n*In Kharkiv 10,000 protested against Russia.\n10 March\nUkrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk stated that central authorities maintain control over Donetsk and had regained control of Luhansk. The same day employees of the Russian Defence Ministry's Intelligence Directorate GRU were arrested in Donetsk. Also, Mikhail Dobkin was arrested on charges of leading a separatist movement.\nReports from the Russian media and a Russian diplomat in Kyiv allege that 300 employees of private security companies mercenaries are active in Ukraine as did a Russian Foreign Ministry statement released on 10 March saying that Russia is \"outraged by the chaos which is currently ruling in eastern regions of Ukraine.\" These allegations were interpreted by The Washington Post as potentially being a \"pretext for Russian military intervention into areas of Ukraine beyond Crimea.\"\n11 March\nPolice freed the Municipal Administration building in Luhansk and briefly arrested the leader of the pro-Russian movement there and local councilman, Arsen Klinchayev. Pro-Russian protesters then elected a \"People's Governor of Luhansk Oblast\", Alexander Kharitonov, who worked from a tent in a square. The same day Chief of the Security Service of Ukraine Valentyn Nalyvaichenko stated he had evidence that employees of the GRU were involved in the organization of provocations in Ukraine and that SВU had detained a 37-year-old Russian citizen, who was engaged in formation of an armed subversive group. The Ukrainian National Council on Television and Radio Broadcasting demanded providers to shut down the broadcast of Russian television channels Rossiya 24, Channel One Russia, RTR Planeta, and NTV Mir in Ukraine. At the time 50% of the providers in Ukraine had already stopped broadcasting these channels. The Russian Foreign Ministry sharply criticized what it said was a double standards policy and selective approach \"in the assessment of the freedom of the press in Ukraine by international organizations, non-governmental organizations and human rights groups, which are turning a blind eye to such a blatant show of censure\".\n13 March\nOne pro-Kyiv protester from Svoboda, Dmytro Cherniavsky, was stabbed to death in the city of Donetsk and a further fifteen were hospitalized after rival rallies clashed in Lenin Square. The local health ministry said that around 1,000 pro-Kyiv protesters were attacked by 2,000 pro-Moscow protesters, Witnesses claimed some pro-Russian activists had arrived in vehicles with Russian number plates, and governor of Donetsk Oblast Serhiy Taruta said the pro-Russian demonstrators were citizens of Russia. The clashes were described by Reuters as being the worst violence in Ukraine since the 18–23 February 2014 overthrow of the Yanukovich government.\nThe Russian Armed Forces announced a new set of sudden military exercises in the border regions of Rostov, Belgorod, and Kursk on 13 March, involving \"artillery batteries, assault helicopters, and at least 10,000 soldiers\". Amateur footage showed columns of trucks and armoured vehicles amassing at the border town of Lopan, just  outside of Kharkiv. The United States Department of State said that the Russian military exercises had \"certainly created an environment of intimidation [in Ukraine]\".\n14 March\nSecurity Service of Ukraine (SBU) detained the self-declared 'governor' of Luhansk Oblast, Alexander Kharitonov. Kharkiv Mayor Hennadiy Kernes was placed in night-time house arrest. Four participants of yesterdays clashes in Donetsk were arrested. According to Euronews the situation in Donetsk \"was quiet\". Clashes in Kharkiv between pro-Russian nationalists and an unknown group resulted in the deaths of two people.\n15 March\nIn Kharkiv, one pro-Russia demonstrator and a passerby were killed by buckshot when Ukrainian nationalists opened fire on a group of men. Police said events leading to the deaths began when a group of nationalists opened fire from inside a car at a pro-Russian protest being held on Kharkiv's central Svoboda (Freedom) Square. A group of several dozen pro-Russian protesters chased the car, tracking it to the headquarters of the Patriot of Ukraine (Patriot Ukrainy) nationalist group. The pro-Russians tried to storm the building and the nationalists opened fire, killing one of them along with a passer-by, police said. The Patrioty Ukrainy group then took several hostages from other offices inside the building as the police arrived. Six people were injured in the ensuing gunfight, including a police officer who suffered serious wounds. The nationalists eventually agreed to give up their arms and surrender. Police made 30 arrests. Both rival groups blamed each other for starting the clashes.\n16 March\nIn Donetsk, protesters stormed the local SBU headquarters for the second day in a row, in addition to the local prosecutor's office and the headquarters of the Industrial Union of Donbass, owned by magnate and local Kyiv-appointed governor Serhiy Taruta.

In Mykolaiv, one question asked, \"Do you support the creation of a federal district Novorossia within Ukraine, including the Nikolayev (Mykolaiv), Odesa and Kherson regions?\"\nThe Economist documented the rallies in Kharkiv and elsewhere, stating that they appeared staged, \"it was not part of a mass movement, more a bit of street theatre, carefully choreographed for the cameras. By seven o'clock it was all over.\"\nUkrainian military units heading towards the Russian border were stopped from passing by residents of Donetsk and Luhansk. Due to weather, only a few hundred attended protests in Donetsk.\n17 March\nhas been adopted by protesters who feel \"sympathetic towards the Soviet Union or imperial Russia and those who denounce Ukrainian nationalists as 'fascists'\"]]\nIn Odesa Anton Davidchenko, the leader of the pro-Russian organization \"Youth Unity\" (who had organized by the majority of rallies in support of Russia), was arrested for \"encroachment on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine\" and \"treason\".

Yatsenyuk also stated that law enforcers would soon start \"seizing all unregistered firearms\" in Ukraine. Yatsenyuk further claimed \"Law enforcement agencies have collected compelling evidence of the involvement of Russian secret services in unrest in the east of our country\".\nIn a televised address in front of both houses of parliament Russian President Vladimir Putin stated \"Don't trust those who frighten you with Russia... we do not need a divided Ukraine. We do not want a partition of Ukraine, we do not need this\". He also stated that \"Russia and Ukraine were not just neighbours but one nation\" and that Russia would always \"protect\" the speakers of the Russian language in Ukraine. He saw the Yatsenyuk Government as \"an illegitimate puppet government under the control of radicals\". Putin also accused nationalists, neo-Nazis, Russophobes and anti-Semites of being behind the \"coup\" in Ukraine; according to Putin this coup was executed using \"Terror, murder and pogroms\". He also called the Verkhovna Rada's vote of 23 February 2014 to repeal a language law aimed at giving Russian and other minority languages in Ukraine the status of regional language a \"scandalous law on the revision of the language policy, which directly violated the rights of the national minorities\".|group = nb}}\nMembers of a large rally under Russian flags stormed Mariupol City Council.
