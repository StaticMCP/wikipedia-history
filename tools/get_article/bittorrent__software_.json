BitTorrent was the first client written for the protocol. It is often nicknamed Mainline by developers denoting its official origins. Since version 6.0 the BitTorrent client has been a rebranded version of μTorrent. As a result, it is no longer open source. It is currently available for Microsoft Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android. There are currently two versions of the software, \"BitTorrent Classic\" which inherits the historical version numbering, and \"BitTorrent Web\", which uses its own version numbering.\nHistory\nProgrammer Bram Cohen designed the protocol in April 2001 and released the first implementation of the BitTorrent client on 2 July 2001. It is now maintained by Cohen's company BitTorrent, Inc.\nPrior to version 6.0, BitTorrent was written in Python, and was free software. Very early versions released prior to December 30, 2001, were released into the public domain without a license. Versions up to and including 3.4.2 were distributed under the MIT license. The source code for versions 4.x and 5.x was released under the BitTorrent Open Source License, a modified version of the Jabber Open Source License.  Versions 4.0 and 5.3 were relicensed under the GPL.\nVersion 4.20 of the client was dubbed Allegro by BitTorrent Inc., in reference to protocol extensions developed by the company to accelerate download performance and ISP manageability.\nVersion 5.30 of the client which is snapshotted at Internet Archive is the latest open source version.\nSince version 6.0, which was released on September 18, 2007, the BitTorrent client has been a rebranded version of μTorrent. It is no longer open source.\nFeatures\nThe BitTorrent client enables a user to search for and download torrent files using a built-in search box (\"Search for torrents\") in the main window, which opens the BitTorrent torrent search engine page with the search results in the user's default web browser.\nThe current client includes a range of features, including multiple parallel downloads. BitTorrent has several statistical, tabular and graphical views that allow a user to see what events are happening in the background. A host of views offer information on the peers and seeds to which the user is connected, including how much data is being downloaded from each and to how much data is being uploaded by each. It has an automatic recovery system that checks all data that has been handled after an improper shutdown. It also intermediates peering between itself, source file servers (\"trackers\") and other clients, thereby yielding distribution efficiencies. The client also enables users to create and share torrent files.\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\"| Versions released into the public domain or under MIT License\n|-\n! Version\n! Release date\n! Changes\n|-\n|\n| 2001 July 2\n| Initial release\n|-\n|\n| 2001 August 10\n| The UI has been rewritten to be very simple and easier to use.\n|-\n|\n| 2001 August 23\n| A fix for a serious problem which was keeping it from using a whole net connection, a complete rewrite of Downloader.py, and other minor tweaks.\n|-\n|\n| 2001 September 2\n| Several major changes were made to the protocol, which is now frozen.\n|-\n|\n| 2001 September 12\n| This release has extensive user feedback and download resuming.\n|-\n|\n| 2001 October 23\n| UI was rewritten. It is now completely graphical and works in mozilla/netscape under UNIX. Monothreading was added which gave vast performance increases. The publisher now stores metadata in files, so it doesn't have to re-scan files every time it restarts, and the tracker now stores publisher and downloader information persistently, so downloads start working again as soon as it restarts. A clean shutdown, small improvements, and bugfixes added.\n|-\n|\n| 2002 January 6\n| For this release, the upload/download logic was thoroughly rewritten to use a tit-for-tat bandwidth trading strategy. Usage of TCP buffering was also greatly improved. Unix installation was simplified, and many small improvements were added.\n|-\n|\n| 2002 April 29\n| Major performance enhancements, including peers reciprocating uploads more responsively. Significant UI enhancements were made, including progress meters on file allocation and resuming. Much better error-handling and multi-file support were added, so multiple files can be downloaded with a single click. The protocol has been reworked to be much more secure, and now uses a fixed port. This should be the last backwards-incompatible release. Several major bugs were also fixed.\n|-\n|\n| 2002 May 31\n| Huge internal performance improvements, changes to the protocol to substantially reduce overhead, and Tracker now keeps track of which peers are still up, greatly improving scaling.\n|-\n|\n| 2002 July 2\n| This release contains major performance enhancements and bugfixes. The publication process has been greatly cleaned up and simplified. Deployments which have too many downloaders behind NAT can now keep them out with the tracker option, --nonat 1. This will hopefully be the last release with a version check on startup - if there are no big snags in the next deployment, the version check will be removed in the next release.\n|-\n|\n| 2002 October 2\n| Minor cleanups, finalizing the protocol, and removal of version checking (which happened in release 3.0).\n|-\n|\n| 2003 January 2\n| Massive performance improvements and some bugfixes were made. Some utilities were added. Upload rate capping was added.\n|-\n|\n| 2003 March 28\n| This release features massive performance improvements, and now supports read-only files. The Windows build now takes command-line parameters. There were also several bugfixes.\n|-\n|\n| 2003 September 24\n| Files now only get allocated as they're downloaded, and don't fragment the hard drive. Large torrents no longer hose the CPU. Better network utilization and more consistent download rates have been achieved. Poorly seeded torrents now get out faster. Several important bugs were fixed.\n|-\n|\n| 2004 March 6\n| This version fixes bugs. The client no longer complains about tracker connection problems when transfers are still going. The bandwidth usage was reduced.\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\"| Versions released under BitTorrent Open Source License\n|-\n! Version\n!

It does so by distributing the end users' downloads between each other. In this way, the developers intend that content providers should take less load on their servers so the end users can receive the content faster. It runs in the background whenever the operating system is running.\nBitTorrent DNA is different from traditional BitTorrent in that it relies on publisher HTTP servers in order to provide publishers with guaranteed minimum data delivery rate, as well as give publishers control over content delivery (peers must connect to the origin server before they can reach other peers), and collect information about content delivery to share with the publisher. The quality of the file transfer is specified in terms of a long-term average bitrate for data and in terms of meeting deadlines when streaming.  It also can give bandwidth to TCP and other traffic.\nDNA is also different from traditional BitTorrent in that it is a UDP-based protocol that has replaced regular TCP-based bandwidth throttling with a much more sensitive bandwidth management technique.\nApart from being installed by third party websites and software companies, the program for end users is also installed when the official BitTorrent client is installed (starting with the rebranded version 6.0). However, it can be independently uninstalled.\nThe first version of the DNA made it possible to keep the DNA application installed and yet temporarily stopped until the next system restart (through the system's control panel, in Windows XP). The DNA GUI was completely removed in the official BitTorrent version 6.1 and 6.1.1, but was re-introduced in version 6.1.2.\nSince October, 2007 BitTorrent DNA has been offered by BitTorrent, Inc. as a commercial service that content providers can purchase (for an undisclosed price) and as a free background program for end users. Company President Ashwin Navin launched the product claiming that \"Implementing BitTorrent DNA on top of legacy infrastructure has the profound impact of allowing our customers to deliver a better user experience, higher quality video, faster software downloads, all with the security and reliability of a managed service.\"\nNavin in a podcast interview claimed that he attempted to sell BitTorrent DNA in January 2005. After finding that BitTorrent's brand was too polarizing for potential customers, they delayed the launch until after partnering with nearly 50 media companies in the [http://www.bittorrent.com/company/about/bittorrent_inc_launches_the_bittorrent_entertainment_network BitTorrent Entertainment Network]. That provided the company enough public validation to finally launch BitTorrent DNA two and half years later.\nThe service's first customer was the company Brightcove, that chose to use it to distribute streaming video files.\nAs of May 2009, the Asus support website is using BitTorrent DNA as an additional download method of their larger files in addition to their multiple somewhat internationally distributed HTTP servers and content delivery mirrors and other redirection facilities Asus has been known to rely in the present and past for their data delivery needs. Currently, a separate \"P2P\" icon is being presented for the DNA style downloads next to the \"Global\" and \"Chinese\" located servers as an example.\nSee also\n* Comparison of BitTorrent clients\n* Usage share of BitTorrent clients\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://broadband.mpi-sws.org/transparency/bttest.php Glasnost] test BitTorrent traffic shaping (Max Planck Institute for Software Systems)"
