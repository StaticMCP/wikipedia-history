Its headquarters are in Phoenix. The party currently controls six of Arizona's nine U.S. House seats, seventeen of thirty State Senate seats, thirty-three of sixty State House of Representatives seats, four of five seats on the Arizona Corporation Commission and three Statewide Executive Offices (State Treasurer, Superintendent of Public Instruction, and State Mine Inspector)\nSince 2020, the state party has had significant Christian nationalist and far-right factions. The Arizona Republican Party played key roles in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 United States presidential election and the 2022 Arizona gubernatorial election.\nHistory\nThe organizational convention of the Republican Party in the Arizona Territory, chaired by James Churchman, was held on November 6–7, 1866, in Prescott, Arizona.\nRepublicans held both of the state's U.S. Senate seats between 1995 and 2019, and the governorship for all but six years between 1991 and 2023. Republican presidential candidates won the state in every election between 1996 and 2020.\nThe party's cash reserves fell from around $770,000 in 2019, to less than $50,000 in 2023. The organization spent $300,000 on legal counseling while attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and $500,000 on an election night party in 2022.\nCurrent structure\nHere is the structure of the state party, as of Feb 2019.\nElected officers of the State Committee\n{|\n|\n* Gina Swoboda, Chairwoman\n* Jake Hoffman, National committeeman\n* Liz Harris, National committeewoman\n* Nickie Kelley, Secretary\n* Ron Gould, Treasurer\n* Gina Maloney, First vice chairman\n* Shiry Sapir, Second vice chairman\n* Kris Morrissey, Third Vice Chairman\n* Carrie Hughes, Sergeant at Arms\n* Shirley Dye, Assistant Secretary\n* Elizabeth Kennedy, Assistant Treasurer\n* Branden Turley, Assistant Sergeant at Arms\n|}\nState Executive Committee\n{|\n|\n* The 12 elected officers of the State Committee (listed above)\n* The 15 county Republican chairmen, first-vice and second-vice chairmen\n* The 28 Members-At-Large (three from each of nine congressional districts)\n* National Committeeman and National Committeewoman (RNC members)\n|}\nState Committee\n* The 15 county Republican chairmen\n* One member for each three elected Republican PCs\nThe chairman, Secretary and Treasurer elected at the biannual Statutory Meeting and other officers elected at the biannual Mandatory Meeting (except National Committeeman and Committeewoman, who are elected at quadrennial State Convention).\nCounty committees\nCounty committees include all PCs within that county. They meet in January after general elections to elect a chairman, two vice chairs, a secretary and a treasurer.\nLegislative district committees\nLegislative district committees exist in counties of more than 500,000 people (Maricopa and Pima Counties), and include all PCs within that district. Officers are elected at Organizational Meetings\nafter the general election including a chairman, two vice chairs, a secretary and a treasurer.\nPrecinct committeemen\nPrecinct committeemen are elected one per precinct, plus one additional for each 125 registered voters of that party as of March 1 of the general election year. There are over 1,666 precincts statewide (including over 724 precincts in Maricopa County.)\nFederal officials\nThese are the Republican Party members who hold federal offices.\nU.S. Senate\n* None\nBoth of Arizona's U.S. Senate seats have been held by the Democratic caucus since 2020. Martha McSally is the last Republican to represent Arizona in the U.S. Senate. Appointed in 2019 by Governor Doug Ducey after the resignation of Jon Kyl who was appointed to the seat after the death of John McCain in 2018, McSally lost the 2020 special election to determine who would serve the remainder of the term expiring in 2023. McSally lost the special election to Democratic challenger Mark Kelly, who won a full term in 2022, defeating Blake Masters. John McCain is the last Republican elected to represent Arizona in the U.S. Senate in 2016, while Jeff Flake is the last Republican to represent Arizona for a full term in the U.S. Senate from 2013 to 2019.\nU.S. House of Representatives\nOut of the nine seats Arizona is apportioned in the U.S. House of Representatives, six are held by Republicans:\n* AZ-01: David Schweikert\n* AZ-02: Eli Crane\n* AZ-05: Andy Biggs\n* AZ-06: Juan Ciscomani\n* AZ-08: Abraham Hamadeh\n* AZ-09: Paul Gosar\nState officials\nExecutive\nThe Arizona Republican Party controls 7 of 11 elected statewide executive offices:\n{|\n|\n* Tom Horne (Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction)\n* Kimberly Yee (State Treasurer)\n* Paul Marsh (State Mine Inspector)\n* Kevin Thompson (Arizona Corporation Commission)\n* Nick Meyers (Arizona Corporation Commission)\n* Lea Marquez Peterson (Corporation Commissioner)\n* Justin Olson (Corporation Commissioner)\n* Jim O’Connor (Corporation Commissioner)\n|}\nSenate\nThe Arizona Republican Party holds the majority in the Arizona Senate, holding 17 of the 30 seats.\nHouse\nThe Arizona Republican Party holds the majority in the Arizona House of Representatives, holding 33 of the 60 seats.\nMayors\n* Jason Beck (Peoria)\n* Steve Otto (Payson)\n* Scott Anderson (Gilbert)\n* Mark Stanton (Paradise Valley)\n* Michael LeVault (Youngtown)\n* Cal Sheehy (Lake Havasu City)\n* Thomas Schoaf (Litchfield Park)\n* Jon Thompson (Coolidge)\n* Phil Goode (Prescott)\n* Mark Freeman (Mesa)\n* Kevin Hartle (Chandler)\n* Byron Lewis (Snowflake)\nParty chairs\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
