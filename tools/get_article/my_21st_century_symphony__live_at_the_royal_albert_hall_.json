The album spent two weeks on the UK Albums Chart and peaked at number 83.\nAccompanied by the Heritage Orchestra and the Flames Collective, a 30-member gospel choir, Raye presented a symphonic reinvention of her album My 21st Century Blues, captured in a live recording.\nThe original album was released in February 2023, coinciding with the success of the well-received song \"Escapism\". Other tracks on the album, such as \"Oscar Winning Tears\" and \"Ice Cream Man\", were also praised for their creative storytelling and emotional performance.\nOn Instagram, Raye shared her enthusiasm for the live recording, calling it \"the most magnificent thing\" she has ever created, and expressing the hope that listeners will be able to enjoy it wherever they are.\nThe concert was broadcast for the first time in the UK on 3 January 2024 on BBC.\nTrack listing\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Chart performance for My 21st Century Symphony (Live at the Royal Albert Hall)\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2024)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Release history for My 21st Century Symphony (Live at the Royal Albert Hall)\n! scope=\"col\" | Region\n! scope=\"col\" | Release date\n! scope=\"col\" | Formats\n! scope=\"col\" |\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" | Various\n| 16 October 2023\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| 15 November 2024\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|}\nReferences"
