From the middle of the 1st to the middle of the 2nd century a brickyard was operated.\nApproximately half a kilometer south of it, at the site of the municipality center of Emerkingen, developed later an Alemannic settlement. Emerkingen was first mentioned in the Latin form \"in Antarmarhingas\" in a deed of 805, given by the counts Cadolah of Friuli and Wago to the Abbey of St. Gall.\nThe village was eponymous for the barons of Emerkingen. Their medieval castle was demolished in 1870. Only the \"Roman Tower\" still exists.\nReligions\nOn July 7, 1103 was ordained with the Burgkapelle the first church. Since May 3, 1900 Emerkingen is the seat of a catholic rectory.\nMuseum\nThe local museum is in the \"Roman Tower\".\nExternal links\nReferences"
