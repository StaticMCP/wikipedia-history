It was founded by Sam McGrath, Travis Stringer, Trevor Stringer and Rod Green; except for Green, they had worked for S2 Games developing Savage: The Battle for Newerth, which won the grand prize at the Independent Games Festival in 2004.\nThe company had one game under development, a first-person shooter with the working title \"Project Offset\". (Some official preview videos have shown third-person views for close-quarters combat.) The game featured a detailed high fantasy world. It was showcased on Attack of the Show! in 2005.\nIn February 2008, Intel acquired Offset Software, having purchased the Havok engine in 2007.\nIntel canceled the game in mid-2010, citing \"recent changes in our product roadmap\" (possibly meaning the failure of Larrabee as a consumer product). The founders of Offset Software have moved to a new game development studio named Fractiv LLC.\nThe Offset Engine was licensed by Red 5 Studios in 2006 to create their MMOFPS game Firefall. Intel shutting down the Offset team did not mean Red 5 could no longer use the engine. The game used a heavily modified engine originally based on the Offset Engine.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
