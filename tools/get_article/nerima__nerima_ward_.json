Its current administrative names go from Nerima 1st Street to Nerima 4th Street. Nerima Station is located in Nerima 1st Street.\nGeography\nThe neighborhood is located slightly towards the east of the center of Nerima Ward. It borders the neighborhoods Hayamiya to the north, Nakamura-Kita, Toyotama-Kita, and Toyotama-Kami to the south, Sakuradai to the east, and Kōyama to the west.\nName\nEven though it was formerly part of the village of Shimo-Nerima (下練馬村, Shimo-nerima-mura) in the Toshima District of Musashi Province, the neighborhood's name derives from Nerima Station.\nHistory\nOn October 1, 1932, the neighborhood was named Nerima-Minamichō. Then, Nerima Ward was part of Itabashi Ward. On February 1, 1963, when the residential address system began to be implemented in Nerima Ward, the neighborhood was renamed Nerima, and was divided into 4 Streets (chōme). This was the first implementation of address format in Tokyo.\nReferences\nExternal links"
