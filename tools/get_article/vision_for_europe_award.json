Luxembourg's best-known sculptor Lucien Wercollier designed the statue presented to the recipients. The first Vision for Europe Award was given to Jacques Santer in 1995, the year he left his position as Prime Minister of Luxembourg to become President of the European Commission. The award honored his efforts to unite Europe into a single entity.\nSince 2016, the Award is presented during the Prague European Summit. The statue is produced by the Czech glass manufacturer Preciosa.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n! Year\n! Image\n! Choice\n!
