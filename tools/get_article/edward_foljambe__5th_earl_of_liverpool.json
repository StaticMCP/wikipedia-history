He has been married three times and has two children from his first marriage. He serves as a member of the House of Lords, the upper house of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\nEarly life\nLiverpool is the posthumous son of Captain Peter George William Savile Foljambe (1919–1944), who was killed in World War II in September 1944, and the former Elizabeth Joan Flint. His paternal grandfather was the Hon. Bertram Foljambe, sixth son of Cecil Foljambe, 1st Earl of Liverpool, the former Lord Steward of the Household to Edward VII.\nFoljambe was educated at Shrewsbury School and the University of Perugia.\nCareer\nIn 1969, at the age of 24, he succeeded his great-uncle as Earl of Liverpool and took his seat in the House of Lords. He was one of the 90+ elected hereditary peers who remain in the House of Lords after the House of Lords Act 1999, and sits on the Conservative benches.\nHe is a former managing director of Melbourns Brewery and director of hotel management company Hart Hambleton.\nPersonal life\nLord Liverpool married three times—firstly to Lady Juliana Mary Alice Noel, daughter of Anthony Noel, 5th Earl of Gainsborough, and Mary Stourton, on 29 January 1970. Before they divorced in 1994, they had two children: Luke Foljambe, Viscount Hawkesbury (born 25 March 1972), and Hon. Ralph Foljambe (born 1974). He later married Countess Marie-Ange Michel de Pierredon, daughter of Count Géraud Michel de Pierredon, on 26 May 1995—they divorced in 2001. Finally, he married Georgina Ann Lederman (née Rubin) in 2002.\nArms\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n|heir-type=Heir apparent}}"
