He competed at the elite level over a fifteen-year period from 1970 to 1984, primarily as a sculler. He was a fourteen time Australian national champion - nine times in a single scull, four times in crewed sculling boats and once in a sweep oared pair. He won the New Zealand national single sculls championship in 1976. He represented at two World Rowing Championships and competed in the men's single sculls event at the 1976 Summer Olympics.\nClub and state rowing\nRaised in Tasmania, Hale's senior rowing was from the Lindisfarne Rowing Club and the University of Tasmania. Rowing for the University of Tasmania he won the intervarsity single sculls title at the Australian University Championships in 1971 and 1972.

In 1972 he was selected as Tasmania's single sculls entrant to race the President's Cup at the Interstate Regatta. He rowed again for Tasmania in the President's Cup in 1973 when he and Jeff Sykes of New South Wales initially rowed to a dead-heat. They re-rowed the event ninety minutes later and Sykes won by a five-second margin. He raced in that event again for Tasmania in 1974, 1975 and 1984\nBy 1976 Hale had relocated to Sydney and from 1976 to 1982 he represented New South Wales as their single sculls entrant in the President's Cup. He won those events on six occasions, all consecutive from 1976 to 1981. All told, Hale contested the Presidents Cup (for NSW and Tasmania) on a record twelve occasions.\nIn Lindisfarne colours and rowing with Steve Spurling he twice contested the national double sculls title at the Australian Rowing Championships in 1974 and 1975 placing second both times. In Sydney Rowing Club colours he contested the national double sculls title - he won in 1976 and placed second in 1977, 1978 and 1979. He contested and won the quad sculls title in 1976, 1978 and 1979; and placed second in that boat class in 1980. He won the coxless pair title in 1979 with Chris Shinners of SUBC. In 1980 an open single sculls event was introduced to the Australian Rowing Championships (in addition to the President's Cup Interstate event).

For the 1979 World Rowing Championships in Bled, Hale was selected as the sculler but an injury to Rob Lang in the Australian men's eight saw Hale step into the five seat for the eight's campaign.
