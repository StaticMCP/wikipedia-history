The awards are named for Barbara Gittings, Israel Fishman, and (jointly) Mike Morgan and Larry Romans. In full they are the Stonewall Book Award-Barbara Gittings Literature Award, the Stonewall Book Award-Israel Fishman Non-Fiction Award, and the Stonewall Book Awards – Mike Morgan & Larry Romans Children's & Young Adult Literature Award.\nFinalists have been designated from 1990, and termed \"Honor Books\" from 2001. Currently a panel of librarians selects five finalists in each award category and subsequently selects one winner. The winners are announced in January and each receives a plaque and $1000 cash prize during the ALA Annual Conference in June or July. Winners are expected to attend and to give acceptance speeches.\nThe ALA solicits book suggestions each to be accompanied by a brief statement in favor of the book. Anyone may suggest a title for consideration. However, the publisher of a proposed title, agents or representatives of the author, or anyone else who may stand to gain directly from the nomination of the book should disclose this information via the online form.\nEligible books should be original works published in the U.S. and Canada during the preceding year, including \"substantially changed new editions\" and \"English-language translations of foreign-language books\".\nHistory\nThe Gay Book Award was inaugurated in 1971 at the ALA annual meeting in Dallas, by the newly created Task Force on Gay Liberation (TFGL) The ceremony, attended by only 9 people, recognized Patience and Sarah, a historical novel by Alma Routsong (writing as Isabel Miller), which had been self-published by Routsong in 1969. A \"grassroots acknowledgment\" of GLBT publishing, there were \"only a handful\" of books to consider annually. The ALA officially started granting the award in 1986, and by 1995, there were more than 800 books considered for the award.\nIn 2002, the awards, then two, were jointly named after the site of the 1969 Stonewall riots as well as two of the founding members of the TFGL, Barbara Gittings and Israel Fishman.\nAward name and categories\n* 1971–1986 Gay Book Award\n* 1987–1989 Gay and Lesbian Book Award\n* 1990–1993 Gay and Lesbian Book Award (nonfiction and literature categories)\n* 1994–1998 Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Book Award (nonfiction and literature)\n* 1999–2001 Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Book Award (nonfiction and literature)\n* 2002–2010 Stonewall Book Award-Barbara Gittings Literature Award and the Stonewall Book Award-Israel Fishman Non-Fiction Award.\n* 2010–present Stonewall Book Award-Barbara Gittings Literature Award, the Stonewall Book Award-Israel Fishman Non-Fiction Award, and the Stonewall Book Award-Mike Morgan and Larry Romans Children's & Young Adult Literature Award.\nFrom 1986, the Gay Book Award and its descendants have been part of the American Library Association awards program, now termed ALA Book, Print & Media Awards.\nRecipients\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|+ Stonewall Book Awards Winners\n}}\nExternal links\n* [http://www.ala.org/glbtrt/award/stonewall/honored Stonewall Book Awards List]\n*[http://www.ala.org/glbtrt/ American Library Association's Rainbow Round Table (RRT)]"
