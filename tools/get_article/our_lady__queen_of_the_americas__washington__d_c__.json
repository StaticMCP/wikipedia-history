The chapel and classrooms were leased evenings during the week and on weekends to celebrate Mass in Spanish and Portuguese, and to teach English, basic skills and literacy classes.\nIn 1986, the Capilla Latina (Latin Chapel in Spanish) became the Parish of Our Lady Queen of the Americas and Cuban-born Fr. José Somoza O.F.M. was appointed pastor.\nIn 1989, the property and building at 2200 California Street, N. W., were transferred to Our Lady Queen of the Americas for the purpose of serving the Hispanic and Portuguese communities, and for building of the premises the Educational and Pastoral Center and the Church.\nIn 1993, at the request of Our Lady Queen of the Americas Catholic Church,  a handful of volunteers taught evening and Sunday classes to 200 Central American parishioners. With access to a single computer, classes focused on English as a second language, graduate equivalency degrees, and U.S. Citizenship.  Job openings were posted on a bulletin board.\nFrom that beginning, Washington English Center has expanded the English literacy education and workforce preparation programs provided by volunteer teachers and tutors to adult immigrants from across the greater Washington area. Today, students, who represent over 100 countries and a variety of world religions, learn from 350 volunteer teachers each term. Students use two computer labs for language lesson reinforcement, computer literacy instruction and job searches.  The Employment Services program combines job counseling with industry certification and career workshops. Conversation reading, chorus clubs, class field trips, and local services and health fairs create a strong sense of community.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://ourladyqueenoftheamericasdc.org Parish Website]"
