In 1914, the Allied armies retreated through the region before the advancing German armies, who were following Von Schlieffen's plan of attack. At the Battle of the Marne, the German army's advance was halted and they retreated to the Aisne region and then dug in there before the so-called \"race to the sea\". The \"war of movement\" was to be short-lived and replaced by a static war of attrition, dominated by the trenches. The region was thereafter an integral part of the Western Front, the \"Chemin des Dames\" area, in particular, seeing the French army in continual action. This article deals with the local memorials which were erected in every city, town and village in France.\nSome of the monument aux morts in the Aisne region\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:200px\" |Work\n! style=\"width:100px\" class=\"sortable\"|Image\n! style=\"width:100px\" |Location\n! style=\"width:60px\"  |Date(s)\n! style=\"width:650px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Subject, notes and references\n|-\n|The monument aux morts at Achery.\n|\n|Achery\n|1925\n| The Achery war memorial features work by the sculptor N.

It was as late as 21 July 1935 that Soissons finally saws her monument aux morts unveiled by the President, Albert Lebrun. The Soissons monument had first been designed by Bartholome in 1914 as a monument to celebrate the history of Soissons but it was decided to create the memorial as the City's monument aux morts and it was erected in 1926. However the Great War veterans (\"Les Anciens Combattants\") were unhappy with Bartholome's statue of a woman at the very top of the monument, the so-called \"Dame Blanche\", and after much discussion the \"Dame Blanche\" was moved to a position in the St Crepin park and eventually replaced on the top of the monument aux morts by the four men carrying an \"eternal flame\" which was completed by a pupil of Lamourdedieu. The monument comprises a central pedestal with the \"eternal flame\" at the very top and Lamourdedieu's reliefs are on the sides of the pedestal. At each corner of the monument are Bartholome statues. In the middle section of the pedestal there are bas-reliefs on the south and east facing sides. In one Lamourdedieu depicts a group of soldiers and in the other a winged female figure representing \"Victory\" protects another two soldiers, one of whom is wounded. On the west facing side of the lower part of the pedestal the bas-relief depicts the King of France and Joan of Arc entering Soissons on horseback on 23 June 1429 and on the south facing side the bas-relief depicts the story of the \"Vase of Soissons\". A soldier is seen crushing the vase under the eyes of Clovis and the messengers of St Remigius. The north facing bas-relief shows the evacuation of the City. The statue on the north west side depicted a \"citizen\" holding a scroll. The inscription reads\"1181. Abolition des Servitudes Feodales a Soissons\"\nIn the south west corner is a knight carrying a sword. The inscription tells his story\"923. Carolingien defenseur de Soissons. Capital Franque\"\nThe south east and north east facing corners have statues depicting French soldiers of the Great War.\n|}\nImages for Soissons\nFile:Soissons Monument aux Morts.jpg|The Soissons War Memorial\nFile:Another part of Soissons frieze.JPG|Part of one of the bas-reliefs on the Soissons monument aux mort\nFile:Child cries in Soissons relief.JPG|Part of one of the bas-reliefs on the Soissons war memorial\n|Part of one of the bas-reliefs on the Soissons war memorial.
