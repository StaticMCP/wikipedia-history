However, as the colonial British were firmly established as tea drinkers, it would be almost a century before coffee became part of Australian culture. Moving into the 1870s, coffee became popular due to the fashionable rise of Parisian coffee shops and the lobbying of the Temperance Movement, a movement of Christian women who protested anti-social drunken behaviour.\nHowever, Australia was once a predominantly tea-drinking society. In the early 1880s, Australians were, per capita, the largest consumers of tea in the world, reportedly consuming annually 6.61 pounds of tea per head.\nAustralia has a distinct coffee culture. The coffee industry has grown from independent cafes since the early 20th century.\nLate 20th century – today\nAfter the Second World War, Italian immigrants were the first to bring espresso machines to Australia.\nCafé culture first flourished in Leichhardt in Sydney due to its high concentration of Italian immigrants. Several Italian coffee names were eventually switched, with the caffè lungo the long black and the espresso becoming the short black.''\nIn 1952, the first espresso machines began to appear in Australia, and many fine Italian coffee houses were emerging in Melbourne and Sydney. Pellegrini's Espresso Bar and Legend Café often lay claim to being Melbourne's first \"real\" espresso bars, opening their doors in 1954 and 1956 respectively. This decade also saw the establishment of one of Australia's most iconic coffee brands, Vittoria, which remains the country's largest coffee maker and distributor. The brand has existed in Australia since 1958, well before it moved to the US.\nThe flat white, regarded as Australia's greatest culinary export, may trace its origins to Australia and New Zealand in the 1980s. Its popularity has since expanded to other countries, gaining traction in the UK and the US. It consists of a shot of espresso with a larger ratio of froth and steamed milk. It first became popular in Australia in the 1990s and its invention is claimed by a Sydneysider. The flat white has since become a classic for Sydneysiders. The iconic Greek cafés of Sydney and Melbourne were the first to introduce locally roasted coffees in 1910.  Melbourne is sometimes called the \"coffee capital of the world\" with its plethora of cafés and roasteries.\nLocal taste and characteristics\nAustralians tend to prefer less sugary coffee, opting for pure rather than sugary variants. Australian café culture is said to emphasise the quality of the beverage, in addition to the quality of the coffee making process. Specialty coffee is in demand in Australia, with numerous boutique cafés. Such coffees include innovations in both the roasting and brewing processes.\n95% of Australian cafes are independently owned establishments.\nAt present, international coffee chains such as Starbucks have very little market share in Australia. Australia's long-established independent cafés compete with homegrown franchises such as The Coffee Club, Michel's Patisserie, Dôme in Western Australia, and Zarraffas Coffee in Queensland. One reason for this is that unlike the United States and Asia, Australia has for many decades had an established local culture of independent cafés before coffee chains tried to enter the market. Australians are more focused on the specialty coffee culture, focusing on sourcing fresh coffee beans, roasting properly, and brewing the best coffee.\nRistretto is a coffee beverage with a smoother flavour because of its higher concentration. The Australian iced coffee uses a cold brew instead of hot espresso. The Australian iced coffee does not involve blending, and may incorporate different local flavours, ice creams and syrups. Another uniquely Melbourne coffee style is the \"Magic,\" made with a double ristretto topped with steamed milk, typically served in a 5–6 oz tulip cup.\nCoffee industry in Australia\nAustralian coffee industry generates US$5.8 billion in revenue per year.\nAustralia currently produces a small volume of specialty coffee, harvesting up to 600 tonnes of green beans from about 850 000 trees every year.\nCoffee is grown in two main areas in Australia, northern New South Wales and Queensland, due to the subtropical climate of these regions. In the 1870s an experimental coffee plantation was established at Waggrakine, Western Australia, but failed within three years due to the unsuitable climate.\nSee also\n*Greek café culture in Australia\n*Coffee in world cultures\n*Tea in Australia\nReferences\nExternal links"
