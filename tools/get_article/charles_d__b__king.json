He was of Americo-Liberian and Sierra Leone Creole descent. He was a member of the True Whig Party, which ruled the country from 1878 until 1980.\nKing was Attorney General from 1904 until 1912, and Secretary of State of Liberia from 1912 until he was elected president in 1919. In this capacity, he attended the 1919 Paris Peace Conference and the accompanying First Pan-African Congress. Though a moderate supporter of reform, he continued to support the patronage machine and corrupt dominance of the True Whig Party.\nPresident King's administration was marked by scandal. His economic agenda and development plan consistently fell short of expectations; and while literacy rates increased with broader access to public education, his presidency is best known for a string of political scandals and economic setbacks.\nIn 1927, he won a sham presidential election, similar to the one he had won in 1923, with official results showing over 15 times more votes for him than there were electors. A forced labor and slavery scandal forced his resignation in 1930. Charles King resigned in disgrace and retired from seeking higher office thereafter until his death. His presidency was marked by extreme corruption, nepotism for the hiring of officials rather than by skill, and a lack of transparency regarding the decisions his administration was making regarding the welfare of the people and use of slave labor.\nPresidency (1920–1930)\nKing became Liberia's President in 1920 and served for ten years. As president, he helped establish the Booker Washington Agricultural and Industrial Institute in Kakata in 1929, and although King was considered a moderate reformer within the True Whig Party, his administration was mired in corruption and controversy, serving the party's patronage machine and making appointments based on nepotism and political favors.\nNegotiation of a loan from the United States\nBy the early 1920s, Liberia's financial crisis had worsened to the point where President King headed up a commission that traveled to the United States to seek reorganization of the country's staggering debt burden. They arrived in March 6, 1921, shortly after President Warren G. Harding had taken office.  The U.S. Congress had suspended all foreign credit and extension of foreign loans, even though the U.S. State Department favored approving the request from the Liberian delegation. In July, U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes said that it was the moral duty to extend the requested loan to Liberia because of a 1918 agreement between the two countries. The following month, President Harding told Congress that he agreed with Secretary Hughes. Negotiations dragged on until October before the State Department finally granted Liberia a loan for $5million (equivalent to $million in ).\nThe United States government under President Harding proposed anew (after an attempt made during World War I from Liberian President Howard to get a loan from the previous Woodrow Wilson Administration) to Congress a $5million loan to Liberia. The House of Representatives approval the loan in a vote of 148–139, but the Senate voted 42–32 against giving the loan. This created great disappointment and a sense of desperation among Liberian officials, who worried that British and French designs on their country might now prove unstoppable. Liberia had become a charter member of the League of Nations in 1919, and the Liberian government was determined to safeguard its sovereignty.\nFirestone Rubber Company\nIn 1925, Firestone Rubber Company agreed to a 99-year lease of  of land in Liberia in order to grow rubber on it. Firestone began exporting rubber from Liberia in 1934. The Liberian economy soon came to depend on it. Firestone's subsidiary Finance Corporation of America gave a $5million loan to the Liberian government, which Liberia intended to use to consolidate and bond debts and fund public improvements. Under the terms of the loan, the President of the United States appointed a financial advisor to Liberia who had the power to approve and disapprove all expenditures by the Liberian government. The Liberian government was also required to use $2.5million of the loan to purchase bonds at a tenpercent markup. Of the remainder, over $1.1million went toward loan repayments on a 1912 loan from the U.S. As a result, very little of the proceeds of the 1934 loan were available to help the country. Meanwhile, the loan repayments constituted 40percent of the Liberian government's annual income.\nPresidential election of 1927\n, The Hague, in 1927.]]\nKing was challenged in the 1927 presidential election by Thomas J. R. Faulkner. According to the official statement, King received 234,000 votes; however, Liberia only had 15,000 registered voters at the time. Thus, King was later listed in the Guinness Book of Records for winning the most fraudulent election reported in history.\nForced labor and slavery scandal\nAfter losing the 1927 presidential election to King, Thomas Faulkner accused many members of the True Whig Party government of recruiting and selling contract labor as slaves. Despite Liberia's firm denials and a refusal to cooperate, the League of Nations established a commission under the leadership of British zoologist Cuthbert Christy to determine the extent of forced labor and slavery still practiced by Liberia. U.S. President Herbert Hoover briefly suspended relations to press Monrovia into compliance.\nIn 1930, the League of Nations published the committee's report, dubbed the 'Christy Report' after the Committee's chairman. The report supported many of Faulkner's allegations and implicated many government officials, including vice president Allen Yancy. It was found that forced labor was used for the construction of certain public works such as roads in the interior, with certain tribes practicing domestic servitude that could be considered as slavery.\nThe report found:\n# \"In order to suppress the native, prevent him from realizing his powers and limitations and prevent him from asserting himself in any way whatever, for the benefit of the dominant and colonizing race, although originally the same African stock as themselves, a policy of gross intimidation and suppression has for years been systematically fostered and encouraged, and is the key word of the Government native policy;\" and\n# that, \"...Vice President Yancy [of Liberia] and other high officials of the Liberian Government, as well as county superintendents and district commissioners, have given their sanction for compulsory recruitment of labor for road construction, for shipment abroad and other work, by the aid and assistance of the Liberian Frontier Force; and have condoned the utilization of this force for purposes of physical compulsion on road construction for the intimidation of villagers, for the humiliation and degradation of chiefs, of captured natives to the coast, there guarding them till the time of shipment [to Fernando Po and Sao Tome.]\"\nSubsequently, King and Vice-President Yancy, along with other implicated leaders, resigned.\nPost-presidency\nKing served as resident minister to the United States from 24 to 25 July 1947, when the legation was raised to embassy. King continued to serve as ambassador until 1952.\nPersonal life\nKing was first married to Janie E. Scott, and the couple had a son and two daughters. His second wife was Cecelia Adeline Cooper and they had one son together. In 1919, King and his wife were guests of President Woodrow Wilson in the United States.\nHe is the grandfather of Olubanke King Akerele.\nSee also\n*History of Liberia\n*1927 Liberian general election\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=f0VnzMelzm8C&dq=freetown+charles+d.b.+king&pg=PA1010 Google Books]\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=f0VnzMelzm8C&dq=freetown+charles+d.b.+king&pg=PA1010 Google Books]"
