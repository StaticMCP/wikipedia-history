Its mission was self-education for those “who labor with their hands.” Located at 407 Tavern Street, New Harmony, Indiana in the New Harmony Historic District, it is the last remaining such institute founded by Maclure. In 1896 the library of the WMI was opened to the public, and it is the oldest functioning library in Indiana. Also open to the public are its museum and art gallery. The WMI maintains archives where human artifacts, natural history specimens and documents are kept, supporting museum and research activities. The members of the WMI continue to meet regularly, as they have done since its earliest days.\nOrigin and History\nIn the late 1820s, the institute (Society of Mutual Instruction) was a group of laboring men who held planned meetings in a variety of houses for discussions of social, political and religious issues and for mutual instruction. It had no permanent home and after Maclure's move from New Harmony to Mexico it became dormant.\nAfter his removal to Mexico, William Maclure and citizens of New Harmony who \"labor with their hands\" corresponded \"vigorously\" and the Working Men's Institute was incorporated. According to a printed clipping in the first minute book of the organization: “The first meeting toward formal organization was held April 2, 1838…” Hence the WMI is considered to have been founded in 1838.\n\"Maclure's endowment of the Workingmen's Institute in essence established the first public library in America.\"\nBy 1840 the Society was holding its meetings in a wing of the old Harmonist brick church. In 1874 a committee of members of the Harmony Society came to New Harmony and purchased the dilapidated old Harmonist Brick Church, tore down what could not be saved, built a new school building for New Harmony School, and repaired the attached wing which was owned and used by the WMI. The WMI's library was moved to the granary building until the improvements were finished.\nIn 1894 Dr. Edward Murphy, who first came to New Harmony as an orphan from Cork, Ireland just after the beginning of the Owen community, generously gave the WMI land and funds for a new building.\nA detailed history of the Working Men's Institute from its beginning to 1927 was written by Thomas James De la Hunt. It is titled, \"History of the New Harmony Working Men's Institute, New Harmony, Indiana: founded by William Maclure, 1838–1927.\"\nThe longevity of the WMI is due in large part to the excellent stewardship of its board of trustees and generosity of the community and grants and loyalty of its members.\nSupport Organizations\nForemost among the local organizations which have supported the WMI are the Woman’s Library Club (founded November 1894) and the Friends of the Working Men’s Institute (founded November 1982).\nDespite the fact that they do not have a formal organization, the many volunteers who have worked in support of the WMI have been very important in its life.\nBuilding Improvements and Maintenance\nSince the construction and dedication of the current WMI building in 1894, maintenance work and improvements have been ongoing. Under the guidance of librarians, directors, and trustees, much work has been done. Here are some of the major achievements:\nAn audio and video projection system for presentations has been added to the ground floor room (Maclure Room) used for most lectures and meetings.\nAn elevator has been added to the front of the building for access by people with disabilities.\nA flat screen television has been installed in the art gallery room (Murphy Gallery) so that materials can be shown which cannot be displayed by other means.\nComputer systems and Internet access (both wired and wireless) have been added for use by patrons and staff.\nPaintings and murals have been professionally conserved (see Conservation and restoration of cultural property) to preserve them and restore them to their original appearance.\nThe chimneys which appear in early photographs of the WMI building are gone now; they were removed when the coal furnace was replaced. A new slate roof has since been installed which resembles as closely as possible the slate roof which was originally on the building.\nAn archive space has been added to the original building, the “Roger D. Branigin / Lilly Endowment, Inc Archives.” The archive space was \"made possible by Indiana Gov. Roger Branigin in 1967.\" The archives are used to contain historic documents, human artifacts and natural history specimens. Usage by researchers and usage for developing museum and art gallery exhibits are supported.\nA portion of the library room has been set aside as a STEM area, with objects and books to further learning for children in those areas.\nPresent Day\nThe Working Men's Institute has maintained its identity and yet kept pace with the times. Its website is at www.workingmensinstitute.org. A sample of its museum collection can be seen online at workingmensinstitute.pastperfectonline.com. It is a 501(c)(3) organization and its library is now associated with other libraries in Indiana. It has connections to Historic New Harmony, Indiana State Museums and Historic Sites, and to the town of New Harmony.\nThe mission of the Working Men's Institute is now the dissemination of useful knowledge to working men and their families.\nMeetings of the membership of the institute are held quarterly.\n[insert a picture of the logo]\nMurphy Auditorium\nIn 1913, an auditorium building was built by the Working Men's Institute, and it was dedicated in January of 1914 and named Murphy Auditorium. It was built in honor of Dr. Edward Murphy and dedicated in the centennial year of New Harmony.\nOver the years this building has been used for plays, light opera, concerts, school events, and public meetings.\nMurphy Auditorium was leased by the WMI to Historic New Harmony in the 1970s and then sold to the University of Southern Indiana in 1996, so Murphy Auditorium is now no longer a property of the Working Men's Institute.\nArlene Feiner Memorial Research Grant for Women’s Studies\nOut of respect for the life and accomplishments of Arlene “Lena” Feiner, the Working Men’s Institute (WMI), in cooperation with the Friends of the Working Men’s Institute (FWMI) provides an annual research grant. This grant has been made possible by the generosity of the Efroymson Family Fund.\nMore details are available on the WMI's website at workingmensinstitute.org/research-grant/\nUses of the Facilities\nIn addition to the library facilities, museum, archives and art gallery, there is a space in the WMI building which is available for a variety of kinds of activities.\nIt is used for classes in various subjects, such as weaving, drawing, yoga and many others. It is used for concerts by small ensembles, playing jazz, classical music and more. It is used for meetings, both small and large, sometimes using web cameras and microphones to include members who cannot be present in person. It is used by individuals for private study or work.\nIt is used for research using the natural history collection, the document archives and more. It is used for children's programs.\nAnd the Working Men's Institute is a venue for free lectures. Many of these lectures are recorded and are available online and in the library.\nMembership\nApprentices and families of members have been welcomed to membership meetings since the institute was young. In the original constitution of the society, Article X reads as follows: “The Wives of members of the Society, and their Children, Wards and Apprentices, between twelve and eighteen years of age, shall be admitted to the meetings of the Society.”\nAs of 1899, the WMI is \"limited to a membership of twenty-six [and] all members shall be citizens of the town of New Harmony.\" Today, the limit on the number of members is still 26, but membership is limited to residents of Posey County, rather than New Harmony.\nTo become a new member, one must be nominated by an existing member and elected by the current membership.\nReferences"
