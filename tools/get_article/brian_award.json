Later, it was a transparent plaque bearing the award's logo.\nThe award was established by the Italian Union of Rationalist Atheists and Agnostics (member of Humanists International).\nAwards\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" width=\"50%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"efefef\"\n!Year\n!Winner\n!Director\n!Country\n|-\n|2006\n|Dark Blue Almost Black\n|Daniel Sánchez Arévalo\n|Spain\n|-\n|2007\n|Sympathy for the Lobster\n|Sabina Guzzanti\n|Italy\n|-\n|2008\n|Khastegi\n|Bahman Motamedian\n|Iran\n|-\n|2009\n|Lourdes\n|Jessica Hausner\n|Austria\n|-\n|2010\n|Lost Kisses\n|Roberta Torre\n|Italy\n|-\n|2011\n|The Ides of March\n|George Clooney\n|United States\n|-\n|2012\n|Dormant Beauty\n|Marco Bellocchio\n|Italy\n|-\n|2013\n|Philomena\n|Stephen Frears\n|United Kingdom\n|-\n|2014\n|The Farewell Party\n|Tal GranitSharon Maymon\n|Israel\n|-\n|2015\n|Spotlight\n|Tom McCarthy\n|United States\n|-\n|2016\n|Worldly Girl\n|Marco Danieli\n|Italy\n|-\n|2017\n|The Blessed\n|Sofia Djama\n|France\n|-\n|2018\n|On My Skin\n|Alessio Cremonini\n|Italy\n|-\n|2019\n|The Perfect Candidate\n|Haifaa Al Mansour\n|Saudi Arabia\n|-\n|2020\n|Quo Vadis, Aida?\n|Jasmila Žbanić\n|Bosnia and Herzegovina\n|-\n|2021\n|Happening\n|Audrey Diwan\n|France\n|-\n|2022\n|The Lord of the Ants\n|Gianni Amelio\n|Italy\n|-\n|2023\n|Tatami\n|Guy Nattiv, Zar Amir Ebrahimi\n|Georgia, United States\n|-\n|2024\n|The Room Next Door\n|Pedro Almodóvar\n|Spain\n|-\n|2025\n|La grazia\n|Paolo Sorrentino\n|Italy\n|}\nReferences"
