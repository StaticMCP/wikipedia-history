The result was a victory for José María Medina.\nBackground\nIncumbent president Medina was constitutionally barred from running for a new term. After urging local authorities to submit a request to the government to amend the constitution, a Constituent Assembly was convened. The Assembly began in Comayagua on 8 August. On 13 August, article 33 was amended by degree, allowing Medina to be re-elected. He was subsequently proclaimed president for a term of 1 February 1870 to 31 January 1874 without elections being required. The Assembly closed on 19 August 1869.\nResults\nFollowing protests from opponents, Medina submitted his presidency to a public vote, which he easily won.\nReferences"
