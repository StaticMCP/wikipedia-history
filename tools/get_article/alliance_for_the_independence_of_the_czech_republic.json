The alliance was formed in October 2023 and was led by a MEP and a former general of the Czech army Hynek Blaško.\nPolicies\nThe alliance supported the withdrawal of Czech Republic from the European Union and NATO, was opposed to Green Deal and international migration and advocated for a political neutrality. It hoped to terminate the Czech membership in NATO by writing a letter addressed to the President of the United States Joe Biden, citing Article 13 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Several diplomats commented their efforts as \"ridiculous\" and the Czech Minister of Foreign Affairs Jan Lipavský have reaffirmed the importance of the membership in a reaction to the letter.\nIn pre-electoral interview, Blaško reaffirmed the exit from EU and NATO as priorities, together with the alliance's opposition to international migration and the Euro. He also claimed that efforts to abolish unanimous voting in the European Council are \"a terrible thing\" and said that if he got reelected, he would try to rejoin the Identity and Democracy Group.\nComposition\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Parties\n!Main ideology\n!Leader(s)\n!List composition\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\" |\n|Alliance of National Forces\n|Nationalism\n|Vladimíra Vítová\n|}}\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\" |\n|National Democracy\n|Ultranationalism\n|Jan Sedláček\n|}}\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\" |\n|Workers' Party of Social Justice\n|Neo-Nazism\n|Tomáš Vandas\n|}}\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\" |\n|Party of Common Sense\n|Nationalism\n|Petr Hannig\n||}}\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"grey\" |\n|Clean Region\n|Local politics\n|Milan Poláček\n|\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"olive\" |\n|Safe Streets\n|Local politics\n|Hana Pavlíčková\n|\n|}\nElection results\n2024 European Parliament Election\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!
