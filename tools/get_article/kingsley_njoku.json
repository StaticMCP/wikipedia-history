However, because of a situation regarding his marriage in Nigeria, which had deleterious effects on his mental health, the striker was dropped from the Gombak United roster in early 2010.\nCambodia\nAnnounced as one of Cambodian outfit Phnom Penh Crown's new signings in late 2010, Njoku donned the number 20 jersey, scoring the winning goal to help Crown list the 2011 Cambodian League title and finishing that season with 10 goals in the league and 4 before the final of the 2011 AFC President's Cup. He then stayed with Phnom Penh Crown for 2012, missing the first half of the season on account of being suspended by the AFC.\nIn 2011, Njoku scored 5 goals in a friendly game opposing Asia Euro University that ended 10-1 in favor of Crown; that year, he also scored the opening goal 12 seconds into the match, in a 4-0 triumph over Prek Pra Keila.\nHe is an Igbo, an ethnic group ubiquitous in southern Nigeria.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://kingsleynjoku.wordpress.com/player-cv/ Player CV]\n*"
