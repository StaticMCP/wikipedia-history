He played first-grade rugby for Western Suburbs and in 1925 toured New Zealand with New South Wales.\nKing, capped 14 times at Test level, made his international debut playing for New South Wales against a visiting New Zealand XV in 1926, a series of matches which were retrospectively awarded Test status. He played his international rugby as an inside centre, with his defensive game complimenting the more attacking centre partner Cyril Towers.\nAfter serving as a state and national selector, King became a sports journalist, writing in newspapers and journals.\nSee also\n*List of Australia national rugby union players\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
