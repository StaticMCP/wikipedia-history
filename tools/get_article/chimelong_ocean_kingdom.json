Examples include polar bears confined in small areas demonstrating \"repetitive pacing, swaying, head-bobbing or circling\" and skin disorders in penguins kept in a sub-tropical environment.\nFurther criticism arises from a recent trade of orcas between China and Russia. In 2013 Russia captured wild orcas in the Sea of Okhotsk, two of which have been sold to China. \"Now, a conservation group monitoring the capture of killer whales says it has discovered that Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) permits were applied for by Russia and granted for two wild-caught killer whales, also known as orcas, to be exported to China.\" Ocean Kingdom refuses to comment on whether they plan to display orcas in the future, but there are currently 50 aquariums in China, none of which have orcas on display.\nAttendance\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Attendance\n! scope=\"col\" | Worldwide Rank\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n| 2014 || 5,504,000 || 20 ||\n|-\n| 2015 || 7,486,000 || 13 ||\n|-\n| 2016 || 8,474,000 || 12 ||\n|-\n| 2017 || 9,788,000 || 11 ||\n|-\n| 2018 || 10,830,000 || 10 ||\n|-\n| 2019 || 11,736,000 || 8 ||\n|-\n| 2020 || 4,797,000 ||  ||\n|-\n| 2021 || 7,452,000 ||  ||\n|-\n| 2022 || 4,400,000 ||  ||\n|-\n| 2023 || 12,520,000 || 6 ||\n|-\n| 2024 || 12,680,000 || 6 ||\n|}\nSee also\n* Chimelong Paradise\n* List of tourist attractions in China\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.latimes.com/travel/deals/themeparks/la-trb-chimelong-ocean-kingdom-china-07201311-pg,0,2381946.photogallery Photos: Chimelong's Ocean Kingdom theme park in China] Los Angeles Times.\n* [http://themeparkreview.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=67361 Coaster Forum Review]"
