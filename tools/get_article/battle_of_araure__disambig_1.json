Simon Bolivar's force defeated General José Ceballos.\nPrelude\nAfter the Admirable Campaign, Simón Bolívar had reconquered the capital Caracas in August 1813, but large area's of Venezuela remained under Royalist control.\nThe Spanish Governor of Coro Province, José Ceballos, had gathered 1,300 soldiers and advanced towards Valencia. He was joined by the 2,500 men under command of José Antonio Yáñez and defeated a Patriot force in the Battle of Tierrita Blanca on 10 November. Bolivar, summoned all the men that he could, and advanced to meet Ceballos, what occurred near a place called Araure.\nThe battle\nThe actual battle began early in the morning of 5 December and lasted for around six hours. It was clear that the Royalist troops were numerically superior to the Venezuelan Patriots. The Royalists had a total of 3,500 to 5,000 (depending upon the source) soldiers, while the patriots had some 3,000 men. Despite the superiority of the Royalists, the Patriots would go on to win the battle.\nBolivar would later tell his troops:\n''Your valor has earned yesterday a name for your corps, and through the midst of the fighting, when I saw you succeed, I named you the Victorious Battalion of Araure. You removed the enemy's flags in the moment of your victory; you have earned the famous, invincible call of Numancia.''\nReferences\nLinks\n*Bolivar's words after the Battle (in Spanish) : :es:Batalla de Araure\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070513124929/http://www.gobiernoenlinea.ve/misc-view/ver_efemerides.pag?id=5595 Size of the Spanish Force (1) ]\n*[http://www.militaryheritage.com/bolivar.htm Size of the Venezuelan and Spanish Force (2)]"
