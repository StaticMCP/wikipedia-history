The ceremony was announced on 1 July 2014, and recognised excellence in Australian community television of the eligibility period, running from 1 January 2013 to 31 May 2014.\nIt was hosted by comedian and former Studio A presenter Tegan Higginbotham. The ceremony was broadcast live on C31 Melbourne, and relayed on delay to TVS Sydney, 31 Digital Brisbane and WTV Perth. On 21 May 2015, the ceremony was made available to stream on YouTube.\nAwards were presented in 13 categories. Program of the Year was awarded to No Limits, while Outstanding Female Personality and Outstanding Male Personality were awarded to Phyllis Foundis and Chris Gibson respectively.\nThis was the 8th Antenna Awards ceremony, revived to celebrate 20 years since the first broadcasts of community television in Melbourne and Brisbane. Weeks before the ceremony was held, the Minister for Communications, Malcolm Turnbull, announced that community television stations would no longer be licensed to access terrestrial broadcast spectrum from January 2016. While subsequent license extensions were granted, it would be the last Antenna Awards to air on terrestrial television in Sydney and Brisbane.\nPerformers\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Artist(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Song(s)\n|-\n| My Lasting Reply\n| \"Steal Your Heart\"\n|-\n| Ginger and Tonic\n| \"Love Shack\"\n|-\n| Pierce Brothers\n| \"Flying Home\"\n|-\n| Ras Jahknow\n| \"Get Up & Live\"\n|}\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!style=\"width:50%; background:#EEDD82;\"|Outstanding Arts Program\n!style=\"width:50%; background:#EEDD82;\"|Outstanding Comedy Program\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" |\n* Inside Art\n** Behind The Words\n** Sacred Spaces\n** The Bec Mac Show\n** Wood Working Masterclass\n|valign=\"top\" |\n* Famous With Luis\n** Community Kitchen\n** Live On Bowen\n** Schlocky Horror Picture Show\n|-\n!style=\"width:50%; background:#EEDD82;\"|Outstanding Factual, Current Affairs or Interview Program\n!style=\"width:50%; background:#EEDD82;\"|Outstanding Music Program\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" |\n* Undercurrent\n** Inside Art\n** No Limits\n** The Exchange\n** Top Brands\n|valign=\"top\" |\n* Speaker TV\n** Asylum TV\n** Basement Apes Live\n** Frequency\n** The Story So Far\n|-\n!style=\"width:50%; background:#EEDD82;\"|Outstanding Youth Program\n!style=\"width:50%; background:#EEDD82;\"|Outstanding Creative Achievement In A Program\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" |\n* Real\n** 1700\n** Enquiring Minds\n** Snaps Kakadu Club\n** The Why Generation\n|valign=\"top\" |\n* Leongatha\n** Being Overseas\n** Jumping Jellybeans\n** Live On Bowen\n** The Buzz\n|-\n!style=\"width:50%; background:#EEDD82;\"|Outstanding Outdoor or Recreational Program\n!style=\"width:50%; background:#EEDD82;\"|Outstanding Special Interest or Lifestyle Program\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" |\n* The Green Corridors of Southern Sydney\n** Beyond Gardens Live\n** Beyond The Divide\n** Rev Heds – \"Calder Park Raceway\"\n** Vasili’s Garden To Kitchen\n|valign=\"top\" |\n* Beyond The Divide\n** AFN Fishing Show\n** Being Overseas – \"Japan\"\n** Get Dirty with Milton\n** Postcards From The Bush\n|-\n!style=\"width:50%; background:#EEDD82;\"|Outstanding Sports Program\n!style=\"width:50%; background:#EEDD82;\"|Outstanding Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Program\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" |\n* The Local Footy Show\n** Australian Electric Superbikes\n** Blend Line TV\n** Rev Heds\n** The Sledge\n|valign=\"top\" |\n* 'No Limits – \"Disability In The Solomons\"'\n** Dutch TV\n** Indigenous Models Of Achievement\n** Oz Indian\n** Russian News Time\n|-\n!style=\"width:50%; background:#EEDD82;\"|Outstanding Female Personality\n!style=\"width:50%; background:#EEDD82;\"|Outstanding Male Personality\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Phyllis Foundis – The Foundis Show'\n** Candice Barnes – The Buzz\n** Lara Shannon – Eco TV\n** Lindi Jane – Snaps Kakadu Club\n** Yana Portnoy – FASX\n|valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Chris Gibson – Leongatha'\n** Aaron McCarthy – Live on Bowen\n** Luis Brown – Famous With Luis\n** Jeremy Dooley – Asylum TV\n** Vasili Kanidiadis – Vasili’s Garden To Kitchen\n|-\n!style=\"width:50%; background:#EEDD82;\"|Program of the Year\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" |\n* No Limits\n** Being Overseas\n** Get Dirty with Milton\n** The Foundis Show\n** The Y Generation\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
