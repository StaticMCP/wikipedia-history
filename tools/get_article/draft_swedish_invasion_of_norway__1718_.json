The campaign concluded with the death of Charles XII at the siege of Fredriksten, thereby leading to the end of the Swedish Empire.\nBackground\nSweden had been on the backfoot of the Great Northern War since its decisive defeat at the Battle of Poltava. Stenbock's campaign, despite a notable victory at Gadebusch, ended in another defeat for Sweden at the siege of Tönning. Following his return to Sweden in 1715, Charles XII executed a campaign in 1716, which also ended in defeat. However, his hopes of removing Denmark-Norway from the war were not entirely shattered.\nSwedish Preparations\nIn 1716, before preparations had begun, Sweden's field forces numbered a meager 40,000 men, in addition to another 10,000 men in the navy. Thanks to further recruitment, this figure had been increased to 60,000–65,000 men by late 1718. Around 20,300 men were left in reserve for the defense of Sweden on the eve of the invasion. This means nearly 59,000 men were prepared against Denmark-Norway.\nThe ongoing negotiations on Åland between Russia and Sweden left Charles XII with little reason to worry about the Swedish coast, allowing him to divert troops for the Norway campaign. The negotiations at Åland fostered considerable fear regarding a potential joint Russo-Swedish fleet in the Baltic, which could potentially force its way through the Sound. In the event of a Russian assault, the fleet in Karlskrona was prepared; more accurately, it served as a fleet-in-being.\nHitherto, the highest tactical and administrative unit in the Swedish army was the regiment. However, through several decrees, the Swedish army was reorganized for the upcoming campaign. 8 infantry corps, and 8 cavalry corps were established. In addition, the artillery corps was reorganized and further strengthened under Carl Cronstedt. His proposals were accepted in early 1718.\nA fleet of 145 ships with the ability to transport some 17,000 men and 4,000 horses was prepared in Stockholm.\nThe plan, was in fact, not to engage the Dano-Norwegian army in a pitched battle, but rather to capture fortresses in Southern Norway and starve out the Dano-Norwegian army.\nDano-Norwegian Preparations\nThe invasion\nArmfeldt's campaign\nArmfeldt's movement into Trondhejm was delayed\nSouthern front\nSwedish forces were organized into 3 corps; the largest consisted of 22 infantry battalions and 33 cavalry companies, personally commanded by Charles XII himself.\nSiege of Fredriksten\n.\nAftermath\nFollowing the death of Charles XII, efforts were undertaken to conceal his death, but these were unsuccessful. On December 1 at the headquarters in Tistedal, the generals decided to abandon the siege. The army retreated along three different routes, and the withdrawal was marked by considerable hardships. The Swedish Life Guards had dwindled to a mere 500 men, from the 2,300 who had initially participated in the campaign. Further north, Armfeldt's army that was poised to conquer Trondheim had been nearly annihilated in the Carolean Death March, resulting in the loss of nearly 4,000 men.\nSweden's new regime did little to maintain the army that Charles XII had tirelessly rebuilt. Following the unsuccessful conclusion of negotiations on the Åland Islands in 1719, the allies advanced on Sweden. Frederick IV marched into Bohuslän with an army of 34,000 men, and while Apraksin, with 132 galleys and 26,000 men ravaged the eastern coast, an attack on Stockholm appeared imminent. Peace was concluded with Denmark-Norway in 1720, and the ships that were so desperately needed in the Baltic to counter the Russians were, alas, transferred.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
