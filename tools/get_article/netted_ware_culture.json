      "text": "# Netted Ware culture\n\nThe Netted Ware culture (also called Textile Ceramic culture) was a Bronze Age culture in northeastern Europe that extended from Finland to the upper Volga region in Russia.\nOrigins\n.]]\nThe Netted Ware culture emerged around 1900 BCE with the arrival of the Seima-Turbino phenomenon in the upper Volga region, replacing the earlier Volosovo cultures, and soon expanded to the west to Karelia and eastern and central Finland. The Netted Ware culture did not reach southwestern Finland, the area of the Kiukainen culture and later the Nordic Bronze culture. The subsistence of the Netted Ware culture was based on small-scale swidden agriculture and animal husbandry.\nHypothetical linguistic affiliation\nThe spread of the Netted Ware culture has been linked to the dispersal of early forms of the Finno-Volgaic languages, especially Finnic languages and Saami languages.\nReferences"
