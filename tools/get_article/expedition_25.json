Expedition 25 began with the Soyuz TMA-18 undocking on 25 September 2010. Three new crewmembers (Scott Kelly, Alexander Kaleri and Oleg Skripochka) arrived aboard the ISS 10 October 2010 on Soyuz TMA-01M to join Douglas Wheelock, Fyodor Yurchikhin and Shannon Walker, and formed the full six member crew of Expedition 25. NASA astronaut Doug Wheelock accepted command of Expedition 25 on 22 September 2010, taking over from Russia's Aleksandr Skvortsov. The departure of Wheelock, Walker and Yurchikhin on 25 November 2010 marked the official end of Expedition 25.\nDuring Expedition 25 Progress M-08M spacecraft visited the ISS, docking with the space station on 30 October 2010 bringing 2.5 tons of cargo supplies. Space shuttle Discovery on STS-133 mission was scheduled to arrive at the ISS on 3 November 2010 but was rescheduled for launch on 3 February 2011. The 10th anniversary of human life, work and research on the ISS fell during Expedition 25. On 2 November 2000, Expedition 1 commander William Shepherd and flight engineers Sergei Krikalev and Yuri Gidzenko became the first residents of the space station. Expedition 25 ended on 26 November.\nCrew\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Position\n!First part(September 2010)\n!Second part(October 2010to November 2010)\n|-\n!Commander\n|colspan=2 align=center| Douglas H.

The footage includes the crew's arrival in Baikonur, their suited and unsuited fit checks in their Soyuz spacecraft, the raising of flags outside their Cosmonaut Hotel crew quarters and other traditional activities. The Soyuz TMA-01M spacecraft was mated to its booster in a processing facility for its rollout to the launch pad in Baikonur 5 October 2010.\nThe Soyuz TMA-01M spacecraft and booster rocket were moved to Launch Complex 5 (Complex 17P32-5) at Baikonur Cosmodrome on a rail-car 5 October 2010 for final preparations prior to launch.\nImage:Expedition 25 Soyuz Rolls to the Pad.jpg|The Soyuz TMA-01M spacecraft is rolled out by train to the launch pad.\nImage:Soyuz TMA-01M launch.jpg|The Soyuz TMA-01M rocket launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 7:10&nbsp;pm.

The new experiments include, Molniya-Gamma, Sprut-2, UHF-radiometry, SLS, VIRU, Test and Colon Crystal.\nExperiments to be carried out include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Field !! Experiment !!

After three days of autonomous flight, at 16:36 UTC on 30 October 2010 Progress M-08M docked with the Pirs module nadir port. A problem during Progress' approach to the space station forced cosmonauts on the station to intervene. During station-keeping as part of the rendezvous operations, flight controllers in Moscow instructed cosmonaut Alexander Kaleri to activate the TORU manual docking equipment and take over the piloting tasks from the Progress' autonomous KURS system. The switch to manual mode was decided at range of 194 m. Kaleri worked inside the space station's Zvezda module to fly Progress M-08M remotely using television views and a pair of joysticks and guided it to the successful docking.\nSpacewalks\nRussian EVA 26 worksites.\nMultipurpose workstation on Zvezda module.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"10%\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\"|Mission\n! width=\"20%\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\"|Spacewalkers\n! width=\"16%\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\"|Start (UTC)\n! width=\"16%\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\"|End (UTC)\n! width=\"12%\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\"|Duration\n|-\n|rowspan=2 style=\"border-bottom:2px solid grey;\"|Expedition 25EVA 1‡\n| Fyodor YurchikhinOleg Skripochka\n| 15 November 2010 14:55\n| 15 November 2010 21:22\n| 6 hours and 27 minutes\n|-\n| colspan=4 style=\"border-bottom:2px solid grey;\"| Yurchikhin and Skripochka installed a portable multipurpose workstation in Plane IV in the Zvezda large diameter and installed struts between Poisk module and Zvezda module and Poisk module and Zarya module. They performed an experiment called Test, which was aimed at verifying the existence of micro organisms or contamination underneath insulation on the Russian segment of the ISS. Yurchikhin and Skripochka photographed and installed the protective cover and disconnected and removed the Plasma Pulse Injector Science hardware from the portable multipurpose workstation in Plane II of the Zvezda. They cleaned the Kontur science hardware (ROKVISS) with dry towels and then disconnected and then removed it. Yurchikhin and Skripochka also installed the protective cover and disconnected and removed the Expose-R scientific experiment from the portable multipurpose workstation in Plane II of the Zvezda module. The Kontur experiment studied remote object control capability for robotic arms and the Expose-R experiment is a European Space Agency experiment designed to expose organic material to the extreme environment of space. Yurchikhin and Skripochka installed an oft hand-rail on Pirs docking module and installed the SKK #1-M2 cassette on Poisk module. The cosmonauts also removed a television camera from the Rassvet module; however, they were unsuccessful in relocating the camera due to interference with insulation where it was to be installed.\n|-\n|}\n‡ denotes spacewalks performed from the Pirs docking compartment in Russian Orlan suits.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/index.html NASA's Space Station Expeditions page]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100401110435/http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/station/crew-25/ndxpage1.html Expedition 25 photography]"
