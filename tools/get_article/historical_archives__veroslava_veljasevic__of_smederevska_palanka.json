The archives are primarily serving municipalities of Smederevska Palanka, Velika Plana, and Žabari.\nHistory\nThe archives were established by the city authorities of Smederevska Palanka in 1968 while it received regional responsibility for surrounding municipalities only in 1996 by the decision of the government of the Republic of Serbia.\nIn 2016, the archives were faced with a deep economic crisis when the City of Smederevska Palanka ended up bankrupt. The crisis was caused by the 2003 decision according to which archival work was funded by the City of Smederevska Palanka alone and not by other municipalities it served. At the time, the official website was closed down, phone number was shut down, and professional staff received their salaries irregularly.\nSee also\n* List of archives in Serbia\n* State Archives of Serbia\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.arhivpalanka.rs/ Official website]"
