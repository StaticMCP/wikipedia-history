It was recorded in 1993 and released later that year on December 3 on the Italian Black Saint label. The album is an update/sequel to Burrell's album Windward Passages (1979) on hatART.\nThe album also features Burrell's wife, Monika Larsson, on the track \"Cela Me Va\" performing a spoken word reading. However, Murray's playing \"ends up drowning her out to an extent.\"\nTrack listing\n#\"Sorrow Song (For W.E.B.
