The show debuted in April 1978 as a five-part miniseries on the CBS network, and then was subsequently broadcast for thirteen seasons from April 2, 1978 to May 3, 1991. It has been a frequent reference in popular culture. At its height it was regarded as cult viewing both in America and in much of the rest of the world. In the communist Soviet Union thousands of people drove regularly to the northern tip of Estonia to pick up the series on Finnish TV.\nIn film and television\n*In the experimental documentary [http://www.hoteldallasfilm.com Hotel Dallas], Patrick Duffy takes a surreal tour of Romania, where Dallas played a surprising role in the fall of communism.\n*In the DuckTales episode \"Ducks of the West\", Scrooge McDuck meets up with a cow-cowboy named J.R.

I bet they're doing at least the 1000th episode.\", replacing the original inquiry about the Atlanta Braves in the belief that this reference would be lost on an audience unfamiliar with baseball.\n*In the 1985 episode of Terry and June'', a Swedish businessman wishes to watch a program on Swedish television. Terry foolishly tells Sir Dennis he has a satellite dish (which he doesn't) and Sir Dennis tells him the Swedish businessman will be watching the program at Terry's house.

The song incorporates the lines \"I must have had my dinner watching something on TV / There's not I think a single episode of Dallas that I didn't see.\" This grammatically challenging lyric may have been partially biographical as it was reported in the UK press that ABBA member Agnetha Faltskog (who performed the song) was dating one of the Dallas producers and had been offered a part in the series.

When British group Blancmange released their version of the song on single in 1984, the picture sleeve included a picture of a shot JR on a TV screen.\n*Ozzy Osbourne, in 1986 made a music video for the song \"The Ultimate Sin\" loosely based on Dallas.

The cliffhanger was also referenced in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air episode \"As the Will Turns\"; when Will was trying to get fired from a television show via a ridiculous monologue that incorporated elements from numerous TV shows, he says that he's \"the guy who shot J.R.\"\n*Charlene Tilton hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live (which Larry Hagman had turned down) centered around the \"shooting\" of Charles Rocket, in which Rocket says, \"I'd like to know who the fuck did it.\" For his use of the profanity, he was fired.\n*During the mania surrounding \"Who shot J.R.?\", Happy Days aired an episode in which the Fonz (Henry Winkler) was shot in the behind. Three different versions of the incident come forward, with the one told by Roger (Ted McGinley) being the most accurate. Fonzie, Chachi (Scott Baio), Roger and Potsie (Anson Williams) have gone camping. Fonzie and Chachi are at odds with Roger and Potsie trying to restore order. When Potsie intervenes, Fonzie tells him to mind his own business and shoves him hard enough that he hits the mantelpiece above the fireplace. This dislodges a mounted rifle, which discharges upon hitting the floor. Thus, the shooting is determined to have been an accident.\n*The episode was first broadcast in Finland on 12 November 1982. The tabloid Ilta-Sanomat lacked a suitable real-life news item to print on the headline poster on said day, so managing editor Raimo Toivonen chose the contents of the episode as a headline. Another headline immediately below reported Ronald Reagan's inability to attend Leonid Brezhnev's funeral due to time constraints, which led to the unintentionally comical combination Tänään tv:ssä J.R. ammutaan / Reagan ei ehdi hautajaisiin (\"Today on TV J.R. is shot / Reagan can't make it to the funeral\"). This was also the first time a fictional character had appeared on the headline poster of a tabloid in Finland, and numerous copies of it were stolen as pieces of memorabilia.\nLater\n*During a scene in The Wedding Singer, Frank Sivero, who plays Andy, refuses to leave the living room and says, \"Hang on! I'm watching Dallas! I think J.R. might be dead or something! They shot him!\"\n*The Jeffersons also had a Dallas parody through a script written by Florence, the maid. The cast was George as G.R. Jenkins, Louise as Lou Weezy Jenkins, Helen as Ellen Wallis, Tom as Tim Wallis, Lionel as Leon Jenkins, and Jenny as Jannice Wallis Jenkins. There is even a scene in which G.R. is shot but fakes his coma to draw out the assailant—Florence as Flossie.\n*In the Irish sitcom Father Ted, one of the locals, Tom, on Craggy Island constantly wears a shirt that reads \"I Shot J.R.\" and repeatedly says, \"I killed a man, Father\" to Father Ted Crilly.\n*The Simpsons episode \"Who Shot Mr. Burns?\" parodies \"Who shot J.R.?\" A deleted scene in \"Bart vs. Australia\" also includes a reference when one of the court members shouts, \"Don't tell us who shot J.R.!\" whilst covering his ears. In another episode, \"I Married Marge\", Homer is briefly seen wearing a shirt saying \"I shot J.R.\".\n*Desperate Housewives paid homage to this storyline in Season 7's midseason cliffhanger. As main antagonist Paul Young was shot, just about everyone on Wisteria Lane ended up being suspects.\n*The Friends episode \"The One with Phoebe's Rats\" shows Chandler watching the show during a period of his unemployment. After hearing the gunshot he exclaims: \"Who shot J.R.?\" After which he says: \"I have got to get a job...\"\nSeason 9 (the \"Dream Season\")\n*In the Family Guy episode \"Da Boom\" (1999), the Y2K virus changes civilization for the worse. In a parody of the \"Blast from the Past\" episode climax from 1986, Victoria Principal and Patrick Duffy reprise their roles as Pam and Bobby respectively in a live-action sequence at the end of the episode, when Pam wakes up and tells Bobby, who is in the shower, that she just dreamt about the strangest episode of Family Guy. Bobby comforts her, pauses, then asks, \"What's Family Guy?\"\n*Introducing Saturday Night Lives 1986–1987 season, Madonna, who hosted the first episode of the dismally rated 1985–1986 season, read a statement from NBC that claimed the previous season of SNL was \"all a dream, a horrible, horrible dream.\"\n*During the episode of Night Court entitled \"Her Honor: Part 2\", Judge Harold T. Stone is removed from the bench. Christine Sullivan, the Public Defender, tries to persuade him to fight for his job, he retorts with: \"Like What?

To open the show, van Outen and co-host Johnny Vaughan parodied the Dallas shower scene.\n*Parodying the JR plot line when Smithers (The Simpsons) dreams that Mr. Burns was not really shot and is in the shower. In the same series episode \"Pygmoelian\", it is alluded to when Moe plans revenge at being written out of a show, but discovers too late that his character was only meant to die in a dream.\n*In the Phineas and Ferb episode, \"Phineas and Ferb Get Busted!\" (2009), Candace waking up and discovering that busting Phineas and Ferb and trying to rescue them was all just a dream is a reference to Pam Ewing waking up and discovering that her husband, Bobby is killed was all just a dream. Perry the Platypus also had the same reference at the end of the episode.\n*In the Married... with Children episode \"Al Bundy, Shoe Dick\", the ending reveals that the events of that episode as well as the previous episodes going to the beginning of Season 6, namely the pregnancies of Peg Bundy and Marcy D'Arcy were all a dream sequence of protagonist Al Bundy.
