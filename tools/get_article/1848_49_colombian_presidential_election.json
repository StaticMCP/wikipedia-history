Members of the electoral college were elected in 1848 and subsequently convened to elect the president in March 1849. The Liberal José Hilario López was elected president with the support of the artisans and their Democratic society clubs, also taking advantage of the divisions among the Conservatives.\nThe election has been characterized as free and fair.\nResults\nElectoral college\n|party5=|votes5=74\n|cand6=|party6=|votes6=72\n|cand7=|party7=|votes7=52\n|source=Historia electoral colombiana\n}}\nBy Congress\nAs no candidate received a majority of the electoral college vote, the president was to be elected by members of Congress from the top-three candidates in the electoral college votes, López, Gori and Cuervo, with a candidate requiring 43 votes to be elected. In a tight and controversial election, under pressure from an armed mob in the streets, López received the required 43 votes in the fourth round and was elected.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=text-align:right\n!rowspan=2|Candidate\n!colspan=2|First round\n!colspan=2|Second round\n!colspan=2|Third round\n!colspan=2|Fourth round\n|-\n!Votes!!%!!Votes!!%!!Votes!!%!!Votes!!%\n|-\n|align=left|José Hilario López||37||44.05||40||47.62||42||50.00||45||53.57\n|-\n|align=left|Rufino Cuervo||37||44.05||41||48.81||39||46.43||39||46.43\n|-\n|align=left|Joaquín Gori||10||11.90||colspan=2| ||colspan=2| ||colspan=2|\n|-\n|align=left|Blank votes||0||0.00||2||2.38||3||3.57||0||0.00\n|- class=sortbottom style=font-weight:bold\n|align=left|Total||84||100.00||81||100.00||84||100.00||84||100.00\n|- class=sortbottom\n!colspan=9|\n|- class=sortbottom\n|align=left colspan=9|Source: Historia electoral colombiana, [https://www.banrepcultural.org/biblioteca-virtual/credencial-historia/numero-4/7-de-marzo-de-1849-tumultuosa-eleccion-de-jose-hilario-lopez Banrepcultural]\n|}\nReferences"
