No examples from Azerbaijan were included in the \"Register of Good Safeguarding Practices\". The Azerbaijani mugham, the first sample from Azerbaijan to be added to the list of intangible cultural heritage of UNESCO, was included in the list in 2008.\nThe concept of intangible cultural heritage is regulated by the Convention on the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, which was adopted at the 32nd session of UNESCO in Paris in 2003 and entered into force in 2006. The inclusion of new heritage elements in UNESCO's lists of intangible cultural heritage is determined by the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage established by the convention. According to UNESCO, intangible cultural heritage includes holidays, festivals, performances, oral traditions, music and handicrafts.\nUNESCO intangible cultural heritage elements selected from Azerbaijan are taken in the \"Europe and North America\" category. Eleven of Azerbaijan's heritage elements are unique to Azerbaijan, and twelve are multinational. Countries with shared multi-ethnic heritage patterns are from West, Central and South Asia. Iran, Turkey and Kazakhstan are the countries with the most examples of shared heritage with Azerbaijan.\nSome cultural elements are exclusive to certain Azerbaijani localities (Nakhchivan, Basqal, Lahic, Goychay, Shaki). Particularly, the Ismailli district is the one with the greatest amount of cultural treasures (Basqal pottery and Lahic copper art).\nThe first element, Azerbaijani mugham, was included into the list in 2008.\nIntangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity\nLegend and domains:\nRepresentative List\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20%\" | Name (date)\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Image\n! colspan=\"2\" | Registration\n|-\n!

In Azerbaijan, a mugham trio made up of performers of the tar, kamancha, and gaval is typically used to accompany mugham performances.\nThe tasnif can be done either before or after the mugham. Ghazals make up the majority of the texts for the classifications, while couplets, garayli, bayati, and other syllable-weighted poetry may also be utilized.

Over time, the zorkhana lost its status as a school where military methods were taught, and took on a ceremonial character.\nIn the national wrestling of Azerbaijan, holding onto the legs and pants is widespread, and the tricks of the stick, hook, mill, and throw are allowed. To warm up for the fight, the wrestlers greet each other and go to opposite sides of the mat with dance steps. At the same time, they make hand movements: one hand first goes up, then down, the other first goes down, then up, and then the movements are reversed. After the referee's whistle, the fight begins and the competitors greet each other in the center of the mat.
