The game started at 5:00&nbsp;p.m. US EST on Monday, December 28, 2009. The game was telecast on ESPN2 and the Georgia Bulldogs defeated the Texas A&M Aggies by a score of 44-20.\nThe game was Georgia's second appearance in the bowl game. Their previous appearance in the game was a 24–15 victory over the University of Arkansas in 1991.\nAs for Texas A&M, the Aggies made their third appearance in the Independence Bowl and now hold an overall record of 1–2. Their last appearance resulted in a 43–41 overtime loss to Mississippi State on December 31, 2000, a game since nicknamed the \"Snow Bowl\" due to the unusual amount of snowfall Shreveport received that day. The entire game was played under extremely wintry conditions, a rarity for Shreveport.\nThe game was the fifth time that the two schools have faced each other in a game.  Texas A&M previously held the series advantage 3–1 (now 3-2). The last time, prior to the bowl that the two teams met was a 42–0 victory by Georgia in 1980.
