The expedition began upon the departure of Soyuz MS-19 on 30 March 2022 with NASA astronaut Thomas Marshburn taking over as ISS commander.\nBackground, Crew, and Events\nInitially, the expedition consisted of Marshburn and his three SpaceX Crew-3 crewmates Raja Chari, Kayla Barron, and Matthias Maurer, as well as Roscosmos cosmonauts Oleg Artemyev, Denis Matveev, and Sergey Korsakov, who launched aboard Soyuz MS-21 on March 18, 2022 and transferred from Expedition 66 alongside the Crew-3 astronauts. However, continued international collaboration has been thrown into doubt by the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and related sanctions on Russia.\nDuring Expedition 67, the space station was also visited by the crew of Axiom Mission 1, a space tourist mission that brought three spaceflight participants to the station on April 9, 2022 along with former NASA astronaut Michael López-Alegría, who had previously commanded the station during Expedition 14. They departed the ISS on April 25, 2022.\nCrew-3 departed on May 5, 2022 and was replaced by SpaceX Crew-4, which ferried NASA astronauts Kjell N. Lindgren, Bob Hines and Jessica Watkins, as well as ESA astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti, to the station. Before departing, Marshburn handed command of the station over to Artemyev. Starliner visited the station for the first time in May 2022 during the OFT-2 mission. At the end of Expedition 67, they remained on the ISS as part of Expedition 68 in September 2022.\nEvents manifest\nEvents involving crewed spacecraft are listed in bold.\nPrevious mission: Expedition 66\n30 March 2022 - Soyuz MS-19 undocking, official switch from Expedition 66\n8 April 2022 – Axiom Mission 1 docking (non-Expedition crew)\n18 April 2022 - EVA 1 (VKD-50) Artemyev/Matveyev: 6 hrs, 37 mins\n25 April 2022 – Axiom Mission 1 undocking (non-Expedition crew)\n27 April 2022 - SpaceX Crew-4 docking\n28 April 2022 - EVA 2 (VKD-51) Artemyev/Matveyev: 7 hrs, 42 mins\n4 May 2022 - ISS Expedition 67 change of command ceremony from Thomas Marshburn to Oleg Artemyev\n5 May 2022 - SpaceX Crew-3 undocking\n21 May 2022 - Boe-OFT-2 docking\n25 May 2022 - Boe-OFT-2 undocking\n1 June 2022 - Progress MS-18/79P undocking\n3 June 2022 - Progress MS-20/81P docking\n28 June 2022 - CRS NG-17 unberthing and release\n16 July 2022 - CRS SpX-25 docking\n21 July 2022 - EVA 3 (VKD-52) Artemyev/Cristoforetti: 7 hrs, 5 mins\n17 August 2022 - EVA 4 (VKD-53) Artemyev/Matveyev: 4 hrs, 1 min\n19 August 2022 - CRS SpX-25 undocking\n2 September 2022 - EVA 5 (VKD-54) Artemyev/Matveyev: 7 hrs, 47 mins\n21 September 2022 - Soyuz MS-22 docking\n28 September 2022 - ISS Expedition 67/68 change of command ceremony from Oleg Artemyev to Samantha Cristoforetti\n29 September 2022 - Soyuz MS-21 undocking, official switch to Expedition 68\nNext mission: Expedition 68\nCrew\n{| class=\"wikitable\"style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Flight\n!Astronaut\n!First part  (30 March-27 April 2022)\n!Second part  (27 April–5 May 2022)\n!Third part  (5 May-21 September 2022)\n!Fourth part  (21–29 September 2022)\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"|Soyuz MS-21\n| Oleg Artemyev, Roscosmos  Third spaceflight\n|colspan=\"2\"|Flight engineer\n|colspan=\"2\"|Commander\n|-\n| Denis Matveev, Roscosmos  Only spaceflight\n|colspan=\"4\"|Flight engineer\n|-\n| Sergey Korsakov, Roscosmos  First spaceflight\n|colspan=\"4\"|Flight engineer\n|-\n!rowspan=\"4\"|SpaceX Crew-3\n| Raja Chari, NASA  First spaceflight\n|colspan=\"2\"|Flight engineer\n|style=\"background:grey; color:white;\"colspan=\"2\"|Off station\n|-\n| Thomas Marshburn, NASA Third spaceflight\n|colspan=\"2\"|Commander\n|style=\"background:grey; color:white;\"colspan=\"2\"|Off station\n|-\n| Matthias Maurer, ESA  First spaceflight\n|colspan=\"2\"|Flight engineer\n|style=\"background:grey; color:white;\"colspan=\"2\"|Off station\n|-\n| Kayla Barron, NASA  First spaceflight\n|colspan=\"2\"|Flight engineer\n|style=\"background:grey; color:white;\"colspan=\"2\"|Off station\n|-\n!rowspan=\"4\"|SpaceX Crew-4\n| Kjell N.
