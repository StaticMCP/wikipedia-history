During the middle of the last century, numerous boat yards lined the harbor.\nWilliam H. Albury (“Uncle Will”) built some of the largest boat yards in Man-O-Way Cay.  When a big boat was under construction, he might employ 15 or 20 men to work on her. Many of these men also had small yards where they built smaller boats –  \"Abaco Dinghies\" which became the backbone of the fishing and commercial industry of the Bahamas.\nIn 1960, Edwin Albury started Edwin's Boat Yard. He, Keith Albury and Darvin Sands built boats of varying sizes during the 60s and were joined by Blake Albury in 1969. Edwin Albury expanded in 1976 when he bought out William H. Albury.\nJoe Albury now builds Abaco Dinghies in his yard. And Willard's sons, Don and Jamie, of Albury Brothers Boats build modern center-console and runabout boats in their facility next to the water.\nThis page is intended to archive the names of the boat builders and boats built on Man-O-War Cay from the 1800s into the late 1900s.\nBoats built on Man-O-War Cay in the 1900s\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
