It is known from two specimens from interior montane forests at an elevation around 2,000&nbsp;m. It is likely threatened by ongoing deforestation.\nThe International Ornithologists' Union consider the plain-backed kingfisher as a subspecies of the scaly-breasted kingfisher (Actenoides princeps) but some taxonomists elevate the taxon to species status.\nReferences"
