This was the nation's tenth appearance at the Summer Olympics since its debut in 1968, although it had previously competed in four editions under the name Zaire.\nFour athletes from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, two per gender, were selected to the team across three different sports (athletics, judo, and taekwondo – the nation's sporting debut in Rio Janeiro) at the Games. Taekwondo fighter Rosa Keleku, the only qualified sportswoman in the team, served as the nation's flag bearer in the opening ceremony. The Democratic Republic of Congo, however, has yet to win its first Olympic medal.\nAthletics (track and field)\nCongolese athletes have so far achieved qualifying standards in the following athletics events (up to a maximum of 3 athletes in each event):\n;Track & road events\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Event\n!colspan=\"2\"|Heat\n!colspan=\"2\"|Final\n|-style=\"font-size:95%\"\n!Result\n!Rank\n!Result\n!Rank\n|-align=center\n|align=left|Makorobondo Salukombo\n|align=left|Men's marathon\n|colspan=2\n|2:28:54\n|113\n|-align=center\n|align=left|Beatrice Alice\n|align=left|Women's 5000 m\n|19:29.47\n|16\n|colspan=2|did not advance\n|}\nJudo\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo has qualified one judoka for the men's half-lightweight category (66&nbsp;kg) at the Games.
