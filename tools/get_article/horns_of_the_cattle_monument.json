The monument depicts the common locally known concept that Mbarara is the land of Milk and Honey, welcoming visitors to the main city in the Western Region of Uganda.\nCultural significance\nThe monument serves as a symbolic representation of the cultural heritage and economic foundation of the Ankole region. The Mbarara City Horns of a cow monument depicts the unique cultural and historical story of Ankole. The monument celebrates the traditional cattle-keeping culture of the Banyankole people and symbolizes Mbarara's reputation as the \"land of milk and honey.\"\nDesign and symbolism\nThe monument features an artistic representation of the distinctive horns of the Ankole long-horned cattle, which are indigenous to the region. The new monument, an artistic imposture of the Ankole long horned cow was erected this week, with the sponsorship of Airtel Uganda. The iconic cow monument is a reflection of Amahembe g'Ente The Ankole cattle are renowned for their majestic horns, which traditionally curve outward and then inward, forming a distinctive lyre-like shape.\nLocation\nThe monument is strategically positioned at a prominent location in Mbarara Town, serving as a welcoming landmark for visitors entering the main city of Western Uganda.

The monument functions both as a tourist attraction and as a symbol of regional identity.\nControversy and renovation\nThe monument has been the subject of public discourse, particularly regarding its maintenance and redesign. In 2019, the original monument underwent renovation which generated significant public reaction. The new monument ,an artistic imposture of the Ankole long horned cow was erected with the sponsorship of Airtel Uganda, to replace the iconic cow feature that welcomed visitors to Mbarara.\nReferences"
