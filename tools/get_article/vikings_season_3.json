Ragnar wants to return to Wessex to claim the land promised by King Ecbert. Floki feels that his new family with Helga is too happy, while Rollo wishes to be away from Siggy.

When Lagertha announces she intends to raid with Ragnar, Kalf, her right-hand man, offers to remain and take care of Hedeby. But he betrays her as soon as she is gone to usurp the earldom with the help of Einar. When Ragnar and Lagertha arrive in Wessex, King Ecbert brings a new condition to give his land. The Vikings must fight for Princess Kwenthrith to appease King Ecbert's nobles. Lagertha is unsure about joining, so King Ecbert offers her the job of leading the Viking settlers in Wessex.

Knowing his end is drawing near, he asks to be baptized and to be buried inside the city. Meanwhile, Aslaug rules in Kattegat and deals with the Christian missionary Ansgar. Ansgar tries to carry a hot piece of metal to prove the might of the Christian god. When he fails, Aslaug has him killed.  In England, King Ecbert and Judith start up an affair.\n| LineColor       = C4CAC4\n}}\n| ShortSummary    = The Franks pay gold and silver to the Vikings, but they show no sign of leaving. Many people are still shocked at Ragnar's christening, and when the badly wounded leader dies, Bjorn is in charge. The warriors place Ragnar into a wooden coffin and escort it to the gates of Paris, where they meet the Bishop. The coffin is brought inside the Cathedral to be blessed, but Ragnar suddenly jumps out of the coffin alive. He takes Princess Gisla as a hostage and forces the guards to open the gates, allowing the Vikings to enter the city. Most of the Vikings then set sail for home, but a small party, led by Rollo, remain camped outside the city to maintain a presence for next year's raid. Emperor Charles is determined to gain his favour, offering Rollo land and titles, and his daughter in marriage in exchange for his pledge to defend Paris against future Viking attacks. While sailing home Ragnar tells Floki that he knows he is Athelstan's killer.\n| LineColor       = C4CAC4\n}}\n}}\nProduction\nDevelopment\nAn Irish-Canadian co-production presented by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Vikings was developed and produced by Octagon Films and Take 5 Productions.
