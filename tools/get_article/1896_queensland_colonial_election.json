In the two-member constituencies, plurality block voting was used -- electors could cast two valid votes but were allowed to \"plump\".\nKey dates\nDue to problems of distance and communications, it was not possible to hold the elections on a single day.\nResults\n{| style=\"width:65%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ style=\"width:50.0%; text-align:right\" | ↓\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:#6495ED; width:47.82%;\" | 41\n| style=\"background:; width:24.55%;\" | 20\n| style=\"color:black; background:#F5DEB3; width:6.5%;\" | 8\n| style=\"background:gray; width:1.3%;\" | 3\n|-\n| Ministerialists\n| Labour\n| Opposition\n| Other\n|}\n| house = Legislative Assembly\n| series = Queensland colonial election\n| back = 1893\n| forward = 1899\n| enrolled = 86,882\n| total_votes = 61,453\n| turnout % = 76.84\n| turnout chg =\n| informal = 765\n| informal % =\n| informal chg =\n}}\n|}\nSee also\n* Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, 1896–1899\nReferences"
