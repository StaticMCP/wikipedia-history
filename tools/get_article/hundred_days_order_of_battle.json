This article describes the deployment of forces in early June 1815 just before the start of the Waterloo Campaign and the minor campaigns of 1815.\nFrench\nUpon assumption of the throne, Napoleon found that he was left with little by the Bourbons and that the state of the Army was 56,000 troops of which 46,000 were ready to campaign. By the end of May, the total armed forces available to Napoleon had reached 198,000 with 66,000 more in depots training up but not yet ready for deployment.\nWaterloo Campaign\nBy the end of May, Napoleon had deployed his forces as follows:\n* I Corps (Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon) cantoned between Lille and Valenciennes.\n* II Corps (Honoré Charles Reille) cantoned between Valenciennes and Avesnes.\n* III Corps (Dominique Joseph Vandamme) cantoned around Rocroi.\n* IV Corps (Étienne Maurice Gérard) cantoned at Metz.\n* VI Corps (Georges Mouton, Count de Lobau) cantoned at Laon.\n* Cavalry Reserve (Emmanuel, marquis de Grouchy) cantoned at Guise.\n* Imperial Guard (Édouard Mortier, Duke of Trévise) at Paris.\nThe preceding corps were to be formed into ''L'Armée du Nord'' (the \"Army of the North\"), led by Napoleon Bonaparte and would participate in the Waterloo Campaign.\nArmies of observation\nFor the defence of France, Bonaparte deployed his remaining forces within France observing France's enemies, foreign and domestic, intending to delay the former and suppress the latter.

According to the returns laid out in secret sittings at the Congress of Vienna the military resources of the European states that joined the coalition, the number of troops which they could field for active operations—without unduly diminishing the garrison and other services in their respective interiors—amounted to 986,000 men. The size of the principal invasion armies (those designated to proceed to Paris) was as follows:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|I||colspan=\"3\"|Army of Upper Rhine—(Schwartzenberg) consisting of :\n|-\n| || ||Austrians||align=\"right\"| 150,000\n|-\n| || ||Bavarians||align=\"right\"| 65,000\n|-\n| || ||Württemberg||align=\"right\"| 25,000\n|-\n| || ||Baden ||align=\"right\"|16,000\n|-\n| || ||Hessians, etc., ||align=\"right\"|8,000\n|-\n|I||colspan=\"3\"|Army of Upper Rhine—(Schwartzenberg), Total||264,000\n|-\n|II||colspan=\"3\"| Army of Lower Rhine—(Blücher) Prussians, Saxons, etc.||155,000\n|-\n|III||colspan=\"3\"| Army of Flanders—(Wellington) British, Dutch, Hanoverians, Brunswickers||155,000\n|-\n|IV||colspan=\"3\"| First Russian Army—(Barclay de Tolly)||168,000\n|-\n! ||colspan=\"3\"|Total||742,000\n|}\nWaterloo Campaign\nWellington's Allied Army (Army of Flanders)\nCantoned in the southern part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, in what is now Belgium, Field Marshal Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington commanded a coalition army, made up of troops from the duchies of Brunswick, and Nassau and the kingdoms of Hanover, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.\nIn June 1815 Wellington's army of 93,000 with headquarters at Brussels was cantoned:\n* I Corps (William, Prince of Orange), 30,200, headquarters Braine-le-Comte, disposed in the area Enghien–Genappe–Mons.\n* II Corps (Lord Hill), 27,300, headquarters Ath, distributed in the area Ath-Oudenarde–Ghent.\n* Reserve (under Wellington himself) 25,500, lay around Brussels.\n* Reserve Cavalry (Lord Uxbridge) 9,900, in the valley of the Dendre river, between Geraardsbergen and Ninove.\n* Dutch light cavalry observed the frontier into the west of Leuze and Binche\nThe Netherlands Corps, commanded by Prince Frederick of the Netherlands did not take part in early actions of the Waterloo Campaign (it was posted to a fall back position near Braine), but did besiege some of the frontier fortresses in the rear of Wellington's advancing army.\nAlexander I of Russia offered Wellington his II Army Corps under general Wurttemberg, but Wellington was far from keen on accepting this contingent.\nPrussian Army (Army of the Lower Rhine)\nThis army was composed entirely of Prussians from the provinces of the Kingdom of Prussia, old and recently acquired alike. Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher commanded this army with General August Neidhardt von Gneisenau as his chief of staff and second in command.\nBlücher's Prussian army of 116,000 men, with headquarters at Namur, was distributed as follows:\n* I Corps (Hans Ernst Karl Graf von Zieten), 30,800, cantoned along the Sambre, headquarters Charleroi, and covering the area Fontaine-l'Évêque–Fleurus–Moustier.\n* II Corps (Georg Dubislav Ludwig von Pirch), 31,000, headquarters at Namur, lay in the area Namur-Hannut–Huy.\n* III Corps (Johann von Thielmann), 23,900, in the bend of the river Meuse, headquarters Ciney, and disposed in the area Dinant–Huy–Ciney.\n* IV Corps (Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von Bülow), 30,300, with headquarters at Liège and cantoned around it.\nMinor campaigns\nGerman Corps (North German Federal Army)\nThis army was part of the Prussian army above, but was to act independently much further south. It was composed of contingents from the following nations of the German Confederation: Electorate of Hesse, Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Grand Duchy of Oldenburg, Duchy of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, Duchy of Anhalt-Bernburg, Duchy of Anhalt-Dessau, Duchy of Anhalt-Kothen, Principality of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, Principality of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, Principality of Waldeck and Pyrmont, Principality of Lippe and the Principality of Schaumburg-Lippe.\nFearing that Napoleon was going to strike him first, Blücher ordered this army to march north to join the rest of his own army. The Prussian General Friedrich Graf Kleist von Nollendorf initially commanded this army before he fell ill on 18 June and was replaced temperately by the Hesse-Kassel General von Engelhardt (who was in command of the Hessen division) and then by Lieutenant General Karl Georg Albrecht Ernst von Hake. Its composition in June was:; ).}}\n* Hessen-Kassel Division (Three Hessian Brigades)- General Engelhardt\n** Hessian 1st Brigade (5 battalions) – Major General Prince of Solms-Braunfels\n** Hessian 2nd Brigade (7 bns.) – Major General von Muller\n** Hessian Cavalry Brigade (2 regiments) – Major General von Warburg (Prussian)\n** Hessian Artillery (2 six-pounder batteries) – Major von Bardeleben (Prussian)\n* Thuringian Brigade – Major General Egloffstein (Weimar)\n** 1st Provisional Infantry Regiment (4 bns.)\n** 2nd Provisional Infantry Regiment (3 bns.)\n** 3rd Provisional Infantry Regiment (5 bns. including the Oldenburg Line Infantry Regiment (2 bns.))\nTotal 25,000\nRussian Army (I Army)\nField Marshal Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly commanded the First Russian Army.

This was the largest of these armies, commanded by Field Marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg. Its target was Paris. This Austrian contingent was joined by those of the following nations of the German Confederation: Kingdom of Bavaria, Kingdom of Württemberg, Grand Duchy of Baden, Grand Duchy of Hesse (Hessen-Darmstadt), Free City of Frankfurt, Principality of Reuss Elder Line and the Principality of Reuss Junior Line. Besides these there were contingents of Fulda and Isenburg. These were recruited by the Austrians from German territories that were in the process of losing their independence by being annexed to other countries at the Congress of Vienna. Finally, these were joined by the contingents of the Kingdom of Saxony, Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen and the Duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen.

The Swiss General Niklaus Franz von Bachmann commanded this army. This force was to observe any French forces that operated near its borders. Its composition in July was:\n* I Division – Colonel von Gady\n* II Division – Colonel Fuessly\n* III Division – Colonel d'Affry\n* Reserve Division – Colonel-Quartermaster Finsler\nTotal 37,000\nAustro-Sardinian Army (Army of Upper Italy)\nThis was the second largest of Austria's contingents. Its target was Lyon. General Johann Maria Philipp Frimont commanded this army. Its composition in June was:\n* I Corps –  Major-General(Feldmarschalleutnant) Paul von Radivojevich\n* II Corps –  Major-General (Feldmarschalleutnant) Ferdinand, Graf Bubna von Littitz\n* Reserve Corps – Major-General (Feldmarschalleutnant) Franz Mauroy de Merville\n* Sardinian Corps – Lieutenant-General Count Latour\nTotal 50,000\nAustrian Army (Army of Naples)\nThis was the smallest of Austria's military contingents. Its targets were Marseille and Toulon. General Frederick Bianchi commanded this army. but Plotho and Vaudoncourt name the commander as General Bianchi (;  ).}} This was the Austrian army that defeated Joachim Murat's army in the Neapolitan War. It was not composed of Neapolitans as the army's name may suggest and as one author supposed. There was however a Sardinian force in this area forming the garrison of Nice under Giovanni Pietro Luigi Cacherano d'Osasco which may have been where the other part of this misunderstanding had arisen. Its composition in June was:\n* I Corps – General Adam Albert von Neipperg\n* II Corps – General\n* Reserve Corps – General Laval Nugent von Westmeath\nTotal 23,000\nBritish Mediterranean contingent\nThis was Great Britain's smaller military expedition. It was composed of British troops from the garrison of Genoa under General Sir Hudson Lowe transported and supported by the Mediterranean Fleet of Lord Exmouth to Marseille to aid a French Royalist uprising. The British landed about 4,000 men in Marseille, made up of soldiers, marines and sailors.\nOther mobilisations\nSpanish armies\nIt was planned that a Spanish army was to invade France via Perpignan and Toulouse. General Francisco Javier Castanos, 1st Duke of Bailen commanded this army.\nIt was planned that a second Spanish army was to invade France over the river Bidassoa and into France via Bayonne and Bordeaux. General Henry Joseph O'Donnell, Count of La Bisbal commanded this army.\nBoth Wellington's Despatches and his Supplementary Despatches show that neither of the Spanish armies contained any Portuguese contingents nor were they likely too, (See the section Portuguese contingent below), however both Chandler and Barbero state that the Portuguese did send a contingent.\nNetherlands reserve army\nIn order to support the Netherlands field army, plans had been made on 24 May to raise a reserve army. It wasn’t until 19 July until the organisation of the army was laid out: it was to consist of 30 infantry battalions, 18 cavalry squadrons, and four artillery batteries. The infantry was organised from the newly acquired Swiss regiments and newly raised Belgian Militia battalions; the cavalry from the reserves of all nine cavalry regiments, including the colonial hussars and Belgian Militia Carabiniers. By then, the Coalition armies had already set up camp around Paris. The army, existing largely only on paper, was disbanded after three months. }} Only the 43rd National Militia Infantry Battalion, part of the 4th Infantry Brigade (2nd Infantry Division), was deployed in the observation of Bouillon. }}\nCommander: Lieutenant-General baron Ralph Dundas Tindal, Quartermaster / Adjudant-general: Major General D.L. Vermaesen: }}\n*1st Infantry Division, Lieutenant-general Baron Tindal\n*2nd Infantry Division, Lieutenant general Gijsbertus Martinus Cort Heyligers\n*Cavalry Division, Lieutenant general Baron Evers (formed partially)\nPrussian Reserve Army\nBesides the four Army Corps that fought in the Waterloo Campaign listed above that Blücher took with him into the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Prussia also had a reserve army stationed at home in order to defend its borders.\nThis consisted of:\n* V Army Corps – Commanded by General Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg\n* VI Army Corps – Commanded by General Bogislav Friedrich Emanuel von Tauentzien\n* Royal Guard (VIII Corps) – Commanded by General Charles II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz\nRoyal Danish Auxiliary Corps and Hanseatic Contingent\nA Danish contingent known as the Royal Danish Auxiliary Corps commanded by General Prince Frederick of Hessen-Kassel and a Hanseatic contingent (from the free cities of Bremen, Lübeck and Hamburg) commanded by the British Colonel Sir Neil Campbell, were also on their way to join Wellington's army, both however, joined the army in July having missed the conflict.\nPortuguese contingent\nWellington had very much hoped to obtain a Portuguese contingent of 12–14,000 men that might be boarded on ships and sent to this army. However, this contingent never materialised, as the Portuguese government were extremely uncooperative. They explained that they did not have the authority to send the Prince Regent of Portugal's forces to war without his consent (he was still in Brazil where he had been in exile during the Peninsular War and had yet to return to Portugal). They explained this even though they themselves had signed the Treaty of 15 March without his consent. Besides this, the state of the Portuguese Army in 1815 left much to be desired and it was a shadow of its former self with much of it being disbanded.\nRussian 2nd (Reserve) Army\nThe Second Russian Army was behind the First Russian Army to support it if required.\n* Imperial Guard Corps\n* I Army Corps\n* II Army Corps, commanded by General Wurttemberg\n* I Grenadier Division\n* I Reserve Cavalry Corps\nRussian support for Wellington\nThe Tsar of Russia offered Wellington the II Army Corps under General Wurttemberg from his Reserve Army, but Wellington was far from keen on accepting this contingent.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*  (also published as: ''Vers la neutralité et l'indépendance.
