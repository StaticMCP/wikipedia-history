It lies about 3.4&nbsp;million light-years away. It was discovered on 13 June 1977 on a photographic plate taken for the ESO&nbsp;(B) Atlas on 13&nbsp;June 1977 using the ESO 1&nbsp;meter Schmidt telescope.\nThe SagDIG is thought to be the member of the Local Group most remote from the Local Group's barycenter. It is only slightly outside the zero-velocity surface of the Local Group.\nSagDIG is a much more luminous galaxy than the Aquarius Dwarf and it has been through a prolonged period of star formation. This has resulted in it containing a rich intermediate-age population of stars. Twenty-seven candidate carbon stars have been identified inside SagDIG. Analysis shows that the underlying stellar population of SagDIG is metal-poor (at least [Fe/H]&nbsp;≤&nbsp;&minus;1.3). Further, the population is young, with the most likely average age between 4 and 8&nbsp;billion years for the dominant population.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
