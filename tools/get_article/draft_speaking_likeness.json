      "text": "# Draft:Speaking likeness\n\nby Gian Lorenzo Bernini, 1632. Note the off-center gaze and tensed oral muscles, creating Bernini's signature sense of motion and speech.]]\nThe speaking likeness was a genre of the figure in Renaissance sculpture and painting that sought to capture momentary, ephemeral motions or expressions, particularly subtle details indicative of a subject speaking or preparing to speak. The style was popularized by the biographic sculptural work of Italian artist Gian Lorenzo Bernini. It is an extreme form of naturalism that arose in a period where human subjects were typically instead deified as untouchable, larger-than-life figures.\nReferences"
