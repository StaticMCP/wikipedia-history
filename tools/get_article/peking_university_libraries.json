It include the Peking University Main Library, the Peking University Medical Library and various faculty branch libraries. Peking University Main Library is the largest university library in Asia.\nHistory\nIn 1898, the Book Collection Building of the Imperial University of Peking was founded on the university campus. It was the first national comprehensive university library in China.\nIn 1912, after the Xinhai Revolution, the Book Collection Building was officially renamed \"Peking University Library\", following the renaming of the Imperial University of Peking as \"Peking University\".\nIn 1918, the Peking University Library moved into the newly-built Red Building. And Li Dazhao became the Chief Director of the library.\nIn 1919, Mao Zedong, through the introduction of his mentor Yang Changji, a professor at Peking University, was appointed an assistant at the library. Although Mao audited classes while working at PKU, he was not a formally enrolled student and did not graduate from the university.\nAfter the Lugou Bridge Incident that took place in 1937, Peking University relocated to Changsha, together with Tsinghua University and Nankai University, united to form the National Changsha Provisional University. And a joint library was set up for the provisional university.\nIn 1938, the National Changsha Provisional University moved to Kunming, and was renamed the National Southwestern Associated University, with Yuan Tongli appointed as the Library Director.\nIn 1946, The three universities, including Peking University, were relocated back to their respective original sites. By 1949, the book collection of Peking University Library increased to the second largest in China, right behind the National Library of Peiping.\nIn 1952, during the national departmental restructuring, Peking University Library relocated with Peking University to the former Yenching University site. The former Yenching University Library's collections were merged into the Peking University Library, and some collections from other institutions were absorbed, forming a structure centered around the former Yenching University Library building.\nIn 1975, a new library was built in the heart of the campus, becoming China's largest and best-equipped library at the time. Deng Xiaoping inscribed the name of the library.\nOn May 4, 1998, the 100th anniversary of Peking University, the new library, donated by Hong Kong industrialist Li Ka-shing, opened in the east side of the 1975 library.\nIn 2000, Peking University merged with Peking Medical University, and the former Peking Medical University Library was renamed the \"Peking University Medical Library\".\nIn 2005, the 1975 library underwent a major renovation, integrating the old and new libraries. The new and old libraries spanned over 51,000 square meters, with over 4,000 reading seats and a collection capacity of 6.5 million volumes, making it the largest university library in Asia.\nIn 2018, King Abdulaziz Public Library Branch in Peking University was established and officially put into operation.\nOn 28 October 2023, Peking University Library held a ceremony for its 125th anniversary.\nCurrent situation\nPeking University Library has developed into a world-class university library composed of the main library, the Medical Library and faculty branches. The libraries cover over 100,000 square meters, and have collected over 10 million pieces of printed documents and over 3PB data storage.
