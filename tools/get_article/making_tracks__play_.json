      "text": "# Making Tracks (play)\n\nMaking Tracks was a 1981 musical play with words by Alan Ayckbourn and music by Paul Todd. It is set in a recording studio and is about Stan, a recording studio owner in debt to businessman Wolfe, who stakes everything on singer/songwriter Sandy, whilst using the voice of Lace, who is Stan's ex-wife and Wolfe's new partner.\nAlthough the musical enjoyed good ticket sales, critical reaction was lukewarm. The play has been only re-staged a few times, was never published, and is not available for production.\nReferences\n* [http://makingtracks.alanayckbourn.net/ Making Tracks on official Ayckbourn site]\n* Allen, Paul (2004) A Pocket Guide to Alan Ayckbourn Plays Faber & Faber"
