In 1994 it was banned by the Federal Ministry of the Interior. At that time it had 400 to 500 members and was considered the largest Neo-Nazi youth organization in Germany.\nHistory\nThe Sozialistische Reichspartei (SRP) was outlawed in 1952, together with its youth organization \"\". The Neo-Nazis went underground in numerous fragmented follow-up organizations, and the former Reichsjugend, the  and the  eventually coalesced again in the form of the \"Wiking-Jugend\". The group was active in the pan-European nationalist New European Order, although they quit in 1955 over the issue of South Tyrol.\nThe organization was founded by Walter Matthaei, and thereafter took on a dynastic tendency, being headed in turn by Raoul Nahrath, then his son Wolfgang, and then his son Wolfram.\nPekka Siitoin extended an invitation to Wiking-Jugend to visit him, and Wiking-Jugend did hold a camp in Finland in 1976 and created controversy by plastering posters calling for the release of Rudolf Hess.\nUntil 1991, Stolberg (Rhineland) was the headquarters of the WJ. From 1991 to 1994, it was in Berlin. There was a direct connection to the NPD. At times the Wiking Youth and the NPD youth organization has a registered under the address of the former WJ chairman Wolfgang Nahraths. When the WJ was banned in 1994, the JN served as a catch basin for numerous former WJ members.\nThe Wiking-Jugend was outlawed as unconstitutional on 10 November 1994 by the North Rhine-Westphalian Ministry of the Interior. The successor organization was the Heimattreue Deutsche Jugend (Homeland-loyal German Youth) (HDJ), which follows the WJ tradition. It was also banned in March 2009.\nStructure\nThe structure of the WJ was strongly based on the National Socialist Hitler Youth: subunits were \"Gaue\" and \"Forste\", the children and teens were organized separately according to gender into boys' and girls' groups. The minimum age for membership was six years. There was no upper age limit; membership was for life.\nThe WJ pursued the intention of training its members in National Socialist idology and socializing them in a nationalistic way. It regularly organized camps and marches, which also intend as a paramilitary training. According to the WJ, a total of 15,000 children and young people are said to have completed their school.\nMembers\nWell known members:\n{| width=\"100%\"\n| width=\"33%\" valign=\"top\" |\n* Bela Ewald Althans\n* Manfred Börm\n* Gudrun Burwitz\n* Friedhelm Busse\n* Lisbeth Grolitsch\n* Thorsten Heise\n* Odfried Hepp\n* Eric Kaden\n* Gundolf Köhler\n| width=\"33%\" valign=\"top\" |\n* Stefan Köster\n* Thomas Lemke\n* Walter Matthaei\n* Dirk Nahrath\n* Raoul Nahrath\n* Wolfgang Nahrath\n* Wolfram Nahrath\n* Udo Pastörs\n* Anton Pfahler\n| width=\"33%\" valign=\"top\" |\n* Sebastian Räbiger\n* Frank Rennicke\n* Edda Schmidt\n* Ralph Tegethoff\n* Björn Ulbrich\n* Sascha Wagner\n* Norbert Weidner\n* Rudi Wittig\n* Thomas Wulff\n|}\nSee also\n*Wotanism\nReferences"
