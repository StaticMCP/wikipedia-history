It does not include people who may have committed war crimes but were never formally indicted, or who were indicted only for other types of crimes.\nThe Nuremberg trials\n* Martin Bormann – Guilty, sentenced in absentia to death by hanging. Later proven he committed suicide to avoid capture at the end of World War II in Europe, and remains discovered in 1972 were conclusively proven to be Bormann by forensic tests on the skull in 1998. Nonetheless, Simon Wiesenthal, Hugh Thomas and Reinhard Gehlen refused to accept this. Gehlen further argued Bormann was the secret Russian double agent 'Sasha'.\n* Karl Dönitz – Guilty, sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment.\n* Hans Frank – Guilty, sentenced to death by hanging\n* Wilhelm Frick – Guilty, sentenced to death by hanging\n* Hans Fritzsche – Acquitted.
