It was designed by Richard von Ezdorf, Draftsman for the Supervising Architect of the Treasury. Completed in 1879, it cost more to construct than any other room in the building at about $33.50 per square foot (total $55,675.00). The room has been used as a library, but today is primarily used for meetings and receptions.\nThe design of the room includes many nautical motifs, such as shells over the Italian and French marble panels; seahorses and dolphins in the cast iron railings on the second floor balcony; stars for navigation in the ceiling; and the compass in the center of the floor. The floor is the original English Minton tile floor. The room contains the only surviving original lighting fixtures in the building.\nPresident Dwight D. Eisenhower held the first televised presidential press conference in the room in January 1955. It was subsequently used for presidential press conferences from 1955 until 1961. On September 12, 2001, the room was used to host the American Red Cross for an emergency blood drive so the White House staff could donate blood in response to the September 11 attacks. In 2001-2002, the room was used for the White House's Coalition Information Center, which coordinated media relations and relief efforts during Operation Enduring Freedom.\nThe origin of the name \"Indian Treaty Room,\" which dates from the 1930s, is unclear. It may have been applied because the Navy had used the room to store documents including treaties with tribal nations.\nThe Bretton Woods agreements, the peace treaties with Italy, Hungary, and Romania after World War II, and the United Nations Charter were all signed in the room.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/history/eeobtour/indian-treaty.html Indian Treaty Room], The Eisenhower Executive Office Building Tour, whitehouse.gov\n* [https://clintonwhitehouse4.archives.gov/WH/Tours/OEOB/html/Indian_Treaty.html Photos of the Indian Treaty Room], National Archives and Records Administration"
