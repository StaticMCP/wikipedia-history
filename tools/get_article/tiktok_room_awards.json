Without affiliation with the TikTok social media platform, it was based through the @tiktokroom Instagram page that had 1.9 million followers, which was disabled by the show's owners according to internet culture journalist Taylor Lorenz. The brand now actively operates under the Instagram handle @tiktokroomtm.\nHistory\nThe show was founded by Nat and Elasia who met on the internet, a college and high school student at the time respectively. The two originally founded the now defunct Muser Shaderoom in 2016, a media page with nearly 500,000 followers that tracked internet drama related to the social media service Musical.ly, the predecessor to TikTok\nIn November 2020, the awards show was held online in which fans of social media influencers voted for winners in various categories. Vox reported that nearly 500,000 votes were cast via a Google Form for the show. The show featured and was promoted by several internet influencers, such as Charli D'Amelio, Dixie D'Amelio, James Charles, and Noah Beck.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|Award\n|Winner\n|-\n|Best house\n|Sway Boys\n|-\n|Best style (female)\n|Avani Gregg\n|-\n|Best style (male)\n|Huddy\n|-\n|Best YouTuber\n|Larray\n|-\n|Best song\n|Jaden Hossler's Angels and Demons\n|-\n|Most positive\n|Sienna Gomez\n|-\n|Most active with fans\n|Charli D'Amelio\n|-\n|Best makeup\n|James Charles\n|-\n|Best fandom\n|Sienna Gomez\n|-\n|Best group/duo\n|4freakshow\n|-\n|Best diss track\n|Larray's Cancelled\n|-\n|Best hair\n|Devyn Winkler\n|-\n|Best clapbacks/comebacks\n|James Charles\n|-\n|Best dance creator\n|Haley Sharpe\n|-\n|Most talented musician\n|Jaden Hossler\n|-\n|Kindest TikToker\n|Sienna Gomez\n|-\n|Best role model\n|Sienna Gomez\n|-\n|Most achieved (female)\n|Charli D'Amelio\n|-\n|Most achieved (male)\n|James Charles\n|-\n|Least problematic (female)\n|Sienna Gomez\n|-\n|Least problematic (male)\n|Jack Wright\n|-\n|Best dancer (female)\n|Charli D'Amelio\n|-\n|Best dancer (male)\n|Jack Wright and James Wright\n|-\n|Funniest TikToker\n|Larray\n|-\n|Best ship\n|Sienna Gomez and Jack Wright\n|-\n|Best couple\n|Dixie D'Amelio and Noah Beck\n|-\n|Favorite Influencer (female)\n|Sienna Gomez\n|-\n|Favorite TikToker (male)\n|Vinnie Hacker\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktokroom_ tiktokroom_] on TikTok"
