The first through train from Wellington to Palmerston North ran on 30 November 1886.\nNew Zealand Railways Department took over the line in 1908 and, in 1955, work began on a  by  Road Services-type shelter, with a light, timber floor and concrete piles, on a timber fronted,  sealed platform,  above rail level, able to take two twin-car sets. It cost £744.1.11. New steps were built in 1963 and the platform was tar sealed.\nTenders for removal were sought in 1978 and it went in 1985.\nReferences"
