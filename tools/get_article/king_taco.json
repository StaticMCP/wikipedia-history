The chain was founded in 1974 by Raul Martinez, and since then, it has expanded to over 20 locations throughout Southern California.\nHistory\nKing Taco was founded in 1974 by Raul Martínez, Sr., who operated a mobile lunch wagon out of a converted ice cream truck. Within six months, he opened the first of the chain's restaurants in Cypress Park.  He opened the second King Taco somewhere in East Los Angeles, which at  is the flagship restaurant. Other locations soon followed, opening every other year in Commerce, Baldwin Park, El Monte and other East Los Angeles sites. By 1995, Martinez had established fourteen restaurants grossing over $21 million.\nAs of August 6, 2015, a grand opening was held at the new location in the heart of the city of Glendale, California, bringing the total to 23 restaurants that are now located throughout Los Angeles County and San Bernardino County. New restaurants have recently opened in Old Town Pasadena and Long Beach, which are among the few King Taco restaurants not located in a predominantly Mexican American neighborhood. The company has contributed to urban revitalization through the retrofitting of vacant commercial buildings for its restaurants. Additionally, King Taco has expanded into the Inland Empire, with restaurants in Ontario, California, and Fontana, California.\nCompany founder Raul Martinez Sr. died on December 3, 2013, at the age of 71 while visiting family in Mexico City.\nSponsorships\nIn 2003, King Taco was the sponsor of the Champ Car season finale at the California Speedway. Called the King Taco 500, the race was eventually canceled as a result of the forest fires that devastated the Southern California area at the time.\nFor the 2019 Acura Grand Prix of Long Beach, King Taco was the primary sponsor on the Harding Steinbrenner #88 Honda/Dallara IR-18 IndyCar driven by rookie Colton Herta.\nLegal matters\nKing Taco Restaurant, Inc. filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against King Taco Express, Inc., Emmanuel Luna, and Sol Celene Rojas in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada in March 2008. King Taco Restaurant, Inc. won the lawsuit.\nSee also\n* List of Mexican restaurants\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
