Officials requested that BP release information on their dispersant effects.\n*May 8\n:*BP reports that methane is freezing at the top of the dome making it ineffective.\n:*Unified Command noting low level flights above Breton National Wildlife Refuge issues press release reminding the media that low level flights above wildlife refuges is prohibited by law above all refuges.\n*May 9\n:*Tar balls reported on Dauphin Island in Alabama.\n*May 10\n:*After failed containment dome BP announces plans to apply five feet in diameter containment vessel nicknamed \"top hat\". BP announced strategy of trying to push mud and debris down the tube to clog it. The strategy was nicknamed \"junk shot.\"\nMay 11–15\n*May 11\n:*BP, Transocean and Halliburton officials testify before Congress blaming each other for the incident.\n:*MMS and Coast Guard Joint Investigation Team chaired by USCG Capt. Hung Nguyen and MMS employee David Dykes begin a Joint Marine Board of Investigation into the accident holding the first hearings at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Kenner, Louisiana where they interview survivors. The investigation is to report its findings in nine months from its convening on April 27.\n:*BP in its regulatory filing says a blowout in its relief well could result in a release of 240,000 barrels a day.\n*May 12\n:*BP releases first public video of leak and others say the leak is significantly higher than what BP has been saying.

It was initially dislodged when an underwater robot collides with the pipe. The stock price of BP was $48.6/share.\n*May 15\n:*Construction of a new permanent riser to replace the temporary riser begins. The installation for the new riser is targeted for June 15.\n:*Coast Guard and EPA authorize use dispersants underwater, at the source of the Deepwater Horizon leak.\nMay 16–20\n*May 16\n:*A new tube is inserted into the pipe and some oil is pumped to surface ship. Transocean's GSF Development Driller II started drilling second relief well.\n*May 17\n:*BP begins burning off gas with the Discoverer Enterprise.\n:*BP says it will release a live feed of the leak hours after receiving a request from Congressman Edward Markey. Supporting his position is Steve Wereley from Purdue University who says the leak may be  a day. BP America President Lamar McKay defends the company's estimates noting the higher estimates are \"theoretically possible...But I don't think anyone who's been working on this thinks it's that high.\"\n:*Chris Oynes, Regional Director for the Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf, announces his early retirement from the MMS.\n*May 18\n:*BP CEO Tony Hayward stated at its respond to Ken Salazar that the environmental impact of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico would be \"very, very modest\".\n*May 19\n:*Oil washes ashore on mainland Louisiana.\n:*Salazar signs a Secretarial Order dividing MMS into three separate divisions: Bureau of Ocean Energy Management reporting to Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement reporting to Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management, Office of Natural Resources Revenue reporting to Assistant Secretary for Policy, Management, and Budget.\n:*Coast Guard labs report that tar balls that washed up at Fort Zachary Taylor State Park in Key West, Florida are not from the spill.\n*May 20\n:*The EPA tells BP to find a new dispersant to replace Corexit EC9500A and Corexit EC9527A that are either comparable or 10 to 20 times more toxic than 12 other dispersants on the EPA's approved list. BP applied 650,000 gallons of the chemical that breaks up oil since the spill began. Corexit is manufactured by Nalco Holding Company which has ties to BP and ExxonMobil.\nMay 21–25\n*May 21\n:*BP begins live underwater video broadcasts of the leak.\n:*BP closing stock price 44.58 following pressure from Congressman Ed Markey.\n:*Flow Rate Technical Group established to \"scientifically validated information about the amount of oil flowing from BP s leaking oil well.\" The average daily oil collection rates is  a day.\n*May 22\n:*Obama signs an executive order establishing the bipartisan National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling, with former Florida Governor and Senator Bob Graham and former Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly serving as co-chairs. The purpose of the commission is to \"consider the root causes of the disaster and offer options on safety and environmental precautions.\"\n*May 23\n:*BP rebuffs EPA order to change its dispersants. BP says that if oil reaches the shore, it would do more environmental harm than if it were dispersed off the coast. It notes that corexit is the only product that is available in sufficient quantities to deal with the spill. Further BP which has now deployed a third of the world's dispersant supply against the spill said suggesting alternatives (or even detailing the chemicals that make up corexit) would expose confidential business information which it legally can keep private.\n*May 24\n:*BP says it currently has no plans to use explosives on the well. It also flatly denies it ever considered using a nuclear bomb on the well as some suggested.\n:*Tom Sesler an official blogger on the BP website reporting from Houma (30 miles north of the Gulf) says, \"Much of the region's other businesses - particularly the hotels - have been prospering because so many people have come here from BP and other oil emergency response teams.\"\n*May 25\n:*BP official says BP would like to retrieve the 325 ton blow out equipment from the sunk Deepwater Horizon.

Deepwater rigs lease for between $250,000 and $500,000 a day and employ between 800 and 1,400 during the initial drilling. The moratorium affected 33 wells owned by the following companies: Royal Dutch Shell (5 rigs), Eni (3), Marathon Oil (3), Anadarko Petroleum (3), Equinor (2), Chevron Corporation (2), Noble Corporation (2), Devon Energy (2). BP (2), BHP (2), Hess Corporation (1), LLOG Exploration (1), Walter Energy (1), Petrobras (1), ATP Oil and Gas (1), Newfield Exploration (1), and Nexen (1)).\n:*Based on the oil flow estimates by the Flow Rate Technical Group, the United States government increased its estimate at  per day.\n:*Elizabeth Birnbaum resigns from MMS.\n*May 28\n:*Obama visits Louisiana again.\n:*In a regulatory filing, BP claims to have spent a total of $930 million.\n:*BP closing stock price 42.95\n:*Bureau of Land Management Director Bob Abbey named interim director.\n:*Obama reverses a Fall 2009 position and authorizes the International Association of Drilling Contractors to visit Cuba. Repsol YPF had a 5-year lease to begin exploratory drilling off the Cuban coast in Gulf of Mexico deepwater later in 2010. The United States embargo against Cuba forbids economic ties between the countries. Newspaper articles noted that if there were an accident U.S. companies could not legally provide assistance.\n*May 29\n:*BP declared Top Kill as a failure and moved on to the Lower Marine Riser Package (LMRP) Cap Containment System. The operational plan first involves cutting and then removing the damaged drilling riser from the top of the failed Blow-Out Preventer (BOP) to leave a cleanly cut pipe at the top of the BOP's LMRP. The cap is designed to be connected to a riser from the Discoverer Enterprise drillship and placed over the LMRP with the intention of capturing most of the oil and gas flowing from the well. During the cutting of the pipe, the diamond blade saw became stuck but was eventually freed later. BP had to use shears instead and the cut is \"ragged\", meaning the cap will be harder to fit.\n*May 30\n:*New Orleans Times-Picayune published an article outlining the difficulties of using relief wells noting that the wells first have to hit the original well bore that is only a foot wide and then has to make sure it can control the output once it hits the well bore so that it doesn't create a duplicate problem. The original well has already shown it has unpredictable gas bubbles. It notes the Ixtoc I oil spill which was finally stopped by the two relief well approach after nine months and 22 days. Ixtoc was in 150 feet of water and had a depth of 11,625 feet.\n*May 31\n:*BP announces plan to slice the leaking pipe, placing a cap on it and channeling the oil to surface ships. Robert Reich writes a column on the Huffington Post saying the United States government should temporarily takeover BP much as it did with AIG and General Motors. He noted the government had a minimal ability to make BP do what the government wants or even report accurately on its actions.\nJune\nReferences"
