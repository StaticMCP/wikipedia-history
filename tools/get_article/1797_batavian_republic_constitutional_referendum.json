      "text": "# 1797 Batavian Republic constitutional referendum\n\nA referendum on the constitution of the Batavian Republic was held on August 8, 1797. The draft constitution was rejected, eventually culminating in a coup d'état.\nBackground\nFollowing the French Revolution, the Patriots brought an end to the rule of stadtholder William V in the Dutch Republic, with support from the French army. They proclaimed the Batavian Republic, and established the National Assembly to draft a constitution, which would be put to a referendum. Its members disagreed about the extent of suffrage and about whether to organise the republic as a federal or unitary state. The Patriots had originally supported a federal state with autonomy for the provinces, but some wanted to emulate the unitary model of the French First Republic with a strong central government. After two years of debate, a draft constitution with compromises was completed on May 10, 1797.\nResults\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:right\n|+ Official results\n!Choice\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n|align=left|For||27,955||20.45\n|-\n|align=left|Against||108,761||79.55\n|-\n|align=left|Total||136,716||100\n|-\n|align=left|Registered voters/turnout||~400,000||–\n|}\nAftermath\nThe draft constitution had been rejected by almost eighty percent, which meant that a new Constitution would have to be drafted. In the elections for the National Assembly a few months later, the supporters of a unitary state won the majority, but the supporters of a federal state retained the majority in the constitutional commission. Meanwhile, in France, the radicals led by Pierre Augereau had seized power. With French help, the radical unitarists staged a coup d'état in January 1798. A new draft constitution, establishing a unitary republic, was quickly adopted in the National Assembly. The Constitution for the Batavian People was approved in a referendum on April 23, 1798.\nReferences\nNotes\nFurther reading\n*"
