Winners are selected by a committee of security industry professionals from nominations collected from the information security community. Nominees are announced yearly at Summercon, and the awards themselves are presented at the Black Hat Security Conference.\nOrigins\nThe name Pwnie Award is based on the word \"pwn\", which is hacker slang meaning to \"compromise\" or \"control\" based on the previous usage of the word \"own\" (and it is pronounced similarly). The name \"The Pwnie Awards,\" pronounced as \"Pony,\" is meant to sound like the Tony Awards, an awards ceremony for Broadway theater in New York City.\nHistory\nThe Pwnie Awards were founded in 2007 by Alexander Sotirov and Dino Dai Zovi following discussions regarding Dino's discovery of a cross-platform QuickTime vulnerability () and Alexander's discovery of an ANI file processing vulnerability () in Internet Explorer.\nWinners\n2024\n* Most Epic Fail: Crowdstrike for 2024 CrowdStrike incident\n* Best Mobile Bug: Operation Triangulation\n* Lamest Vendor Response: Xiaomi for obstructing
