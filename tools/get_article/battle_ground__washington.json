The population was 20,743 at the 2020 census. As of 2023, its population is 22,959.\nHistory\nName\nBattle Ground got its name from a standoff between a group of the Klickitat peoples and a military force from the Vancouver Barracks, which had recently transitioned to a U.S. Army post. By 1855, members of the Klickitat peoples had been imprisoned at the Vancouver Barracks. The hostile conditions of their detainment inspired some of the Klickitats to decamp.\nThis group of Klickitat peoples headed north, led by Chief Umtuch (or Umtux, according to some accounts). When the community at Fort Vancouver discovered this escape, they assembled an armed contingent led by Captain William Strong to pursue the Klickitats. Captain Strong's party eventually found the Klickitats near the present-day location of downtown Battle Ground.\nDetails of the standoff vary. However, accounts agree that Chief Umtuch and Captain Strong engaged in some sort of negotiations, which resulted in the Klickitats agreeing to return to the Barracks. After this decision, at least one shot was fired, resulting in the death of Chief Umtuch, reportedly by one of Captain Strong's soldiers.\nThe Klickitat asked Captain Strong to leave them alone so they might properly bury their chief. After some deliberation, Captain Strong agreed, provided the Klickitats promised to return to the Fort, which they did a couple of days later.\nAs a result of this event, settlers at the fort began to refer to that site as 'Strong's Battle Ground', which was later shortened to 'Battle Ground.' Two schools in Battle Ground were later named after Captain Strong and Chief Umtuch.\nEarly settlement\nBattle Ground was first settled in 1886 by Augustus H. Richter, who platted the town in 1902.
