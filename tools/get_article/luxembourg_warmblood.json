As with other European warmblood sport horses, admission to the stud-book is based on performance rather than parentage. Warmblood breeding within Luxembourg derives mostly from Holsteiner and Hanoverian stock imported from Germany.\nFrom 1970 registration was through the Fédération des Stud-Books Luxembourgeois, a federation of stud-books. In 1999 it was dissolved and the Stud-Book du Cheval de Selle Luxembourgeois was established as an independent non-profit organisation.\nReferences\n.\n}}"
