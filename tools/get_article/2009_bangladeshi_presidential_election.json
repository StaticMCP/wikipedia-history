They were originally scheduled to have taken place by 5 September 2007, when Iajuddin Ahmed's term expired, but was postponed due to the lack of an elected parliament. The Awami League, which resoundingly won the parliamentary election, nominated AL presidium member Zillur Rahman as its candidate for president, and he was expected to be elected at the parliamentary session. Rahman was the only candidate who submitted his papers by the nomination deadline of 9 February 2009, and as he did not withdraw by the withdrawal deadline of 11 February 2009, the Election Commission declared him elected. He was sworn in on 12 February 2009.\nReferences"
