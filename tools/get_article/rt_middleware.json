RT-middleware supports the construction of various networked robotic systems by integrating various network-enabled robotic elements named RT-Components, which specification standard is discussed and defined by the Object Management Group (OMG).\nProperties\nIn the RT-middleware, robotics elements, such as actuators, are regarded as RT-components, and the whole robotic system is constructed by connecting such components. This distributed architecture helps developers reuse the robotic elements and boosts the reliability of a system.\nEach RT-component has a port as an endpoint for communicating to other RT-components. Every port has its type and the ports which have the same type can be connected each other.\nRT-components also have state, so they behave as finite-state machines. The states they can have are: CREATED, INACTIVE, ACTIVE, and ERROR. States and behaviors are controlled by the execution-context. If component behavior must be changed, the execution-context can be replaced at runtime.\nImplementations\nRT-middleware is only a standard of the Robotics platform software. Implementations include:\n* OpenRTM-aist is based on the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) platform developed by National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology. Using CORBA properties, OpenRTM-aist is available for environments with multiple platforms and programming languages.\n* OpenRTM.NET is for the .NET Framework.\n* RTM on Android is being implemented on Android (operating system).\n* RTC Lite is a future modified RT-middleware for embedded or small-resource systems.\n* RTM Safety to pass the IEC 61508 standard.\nRelated projects\n*Robot Operating System (ROS) – C++ software framework developed by Willow Garage.\n*Open Robot Control Software (Orocos) – C++ software framework for component-based robot control software\n*OPRoS developed by Korea Association of Robot Industry (KAR)\nSee also\n*Robot\n*Open-source robotics\n*Middleware\n*New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization\n*National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology\n*Object Management Group\n*Japan Robot Association\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040504030512/http://www.is.aist.go.jp/rt/ RT-middleware Project (Japanese)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101010204852/http://www.openrtm.org/OpenRTM-aist/ OpenRTM-aist]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120310175128/http://www.openrtp.org/wiki/_default/en/Home/ OpenRT Platform]\n*[http://www.virca.hu VirCA - Virtual Collaboration Arena framework powered by RT-Middleware]"
