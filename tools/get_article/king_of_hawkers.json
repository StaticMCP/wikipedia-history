Upon her return, she discovers her mother's ailing health and a young man named Dong managing their family stall.\nMisunderstandings arise when Dong considers selling their secret recipe, and tensions heighten when an multinational corporation linked to Nala's in-laws threatens the hawker community's traditions. As the MNC plans a competition to acquire recipes, chaos erupts among the hawkers.\nAmidst this turmoil, Nala stands against the corporation's manipulative tactics to preserve Singapore's hawker culture, setting the stage for a battle between tradition and corporate greed, determining whether she can safeguard the legacy as the King (or Queen) of Hawkers.\nCast\n* Dawn Yeoh as Zhang Nala\n* Ryan Lian as Ah dong\n* Hugo Ng as Ah Lau\n* Liu Lingling as Ping Jie\n* Gini Chang as CP\n* Kimson Tan as Kimson\n* Moses Cheng as Xiao Gao\n* Asher Su as Jia Sheng\n* Das DD as Raja\n* Collin Chee as Lee Guo Zhong\n* Mimi Chu as Mrs. Lee\n* Anita Chui as Fiona\nProduction\nThe filming was done in the whole month of October 2023.

This isn’t the most original movie you’ve seen, with a number of over the top and melodramatic scenes that many local mainstream productions seem to be fond of.\"\nCai Xin Ying of Lianhe Zaobao gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars, opining that film, \"There are many close-up shots of hawker food in the movie, and you can feel the director's love for hawker food. These shots are the culprits that made me hungry in the theater. I would like to remind the audience who came to support this Singaporean film to eat full before entering the theater, and don't be like me, who was in a dilemma of \"should I eat pork minced meat noodles or Hainanese chicken rice later\" after watching the end.\"\nLin Jia Hao of vibes by 8world gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars, opining that the film, \"The film claims to be based on Singapore's hawker culture, and indeed many familiar hawker delicacies appear in the film, allowing the audience to \"see and eat\" across the big screen. \"\nHowever, from the plot point of view, in addition to being filmed in hawker centers, the plot eventually extends to a cooking competition between several hawkers and Hong Kong chefs, which makes people feel that it fails to truly highlight the essence of local hawker culture. If the film can explore hawker culture more deeply and strengthen realism, I believe it will add points to the film. In any case, “King of Hawkers” chose to release in the Lantern Festival slot, and overall still presents a hot and bustling atmosphere, allowing the audience to welcome the Lantern Festival happily.\"\nTay Yek Keak of 8days gave the film 2 out of 5 stars, opining that the film, \"This run-of-the-mill cooking competition flick featuring our hawker food — bak chor mee, chilli crab, bak kut teh, etc — throws in expected ingredients. Including a cockroach-eating scene (hey, it's hawker fare after all). But the whole blend goes bland due to an average, outdated TV-ish script gone askew.\", and that the film feels \"a mild swallow, stuffs itself with too many unnecessary characters while veering off course from chirpy livestream comedy to clunky sabotage drama.\"\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
