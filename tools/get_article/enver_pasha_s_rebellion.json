It was conducted by the former Ottoman Minister of War, Enver Pasha.\nThe uprising started in the summer of 1921 when Enver Pasha arrived in Bukhara to negotiate with the Basmachi. He ended up defecting to the Basmachi and began fighting the Bolsheviks. During this period of the Basmachi movement, they reached their peak, but by May 1922, with the start of Bolshevik counteroffensives in Turkestan, the Basmachi began to fall apart. By mid-June, Ibrahim Bek revolted against Enver, sparking a civil conflict that divided the Basmachi. The rebellion was ultimately crushed by August 4, 1922, when Enver Pasha himself was killed.\nBackground\nAfter the end of World War One, Enver Pasha, along with Djemal Pasha and Talaat Pasha, fled to Germany, where he had to change his identity to 'Ali Bey' due to a military tribunal in Istanbul sentencing the Young Turk trio to death. In 1919, he met with Karl Radek, a representative of the Comintern in Berlin, who offered him a new future—leading the Red Army against the Basmachi. In early 1920, Enver Pasha traveled to Moscow, where he worked for the Society for the Unity of the Revolution with Islam. He promised a marriage between Islam and Communism, aiming to establish a Communist-Muslim union, and pledged to stop the Basmachi and turn them to their side. In June 1921, he arrived in Bukhara with some representatives and officers. He was offered the post of Minister of War in the Bukharan Government but he rejected this proposal, he executed the captured men there, thereby starting his rebellion.\nThe uprising\nEnver Pasha soon found his ideas of Muslim socialism popular among the farmers and working class of Eastern Bukhara, but this led to him being shunned by the nobility and many of the Kurbashi. The nobility indirectly supported Ibrahim Bek over Enver, laying the groundwork for a civil conflict between the two. This culminated in Enver Pasha being disarmed and captured during a meeting with Ibrahim Bek. He was later released by the Emir of Bukhara, Seyyid Alim, who appointed him as naib (deputy). In his new position, Enver attempted to gather arms from countries hostile to the local Bolshevik presence, with Afghanistan and the United Kingdom being the most notable, as both were eager to send him supplies. However, the Bolsheviks prevented this and blockaded Bukhara. Despite these setbacks, Enver started his campaign with 20,000 soldiers. His first victory was in Dushanbe, which he successfully captured after a month-long siege. Although they attempted to open the border with China to end the blockade however they failed.\nHeight of the Movement\nIn May 1922, after receiving military aid from Afghanistan—including 800 soldiers, 100 British rifles, and 80 camel-loads of ammunition—Enver Pasha mobilized from his headquarters in the Kafirun region with approximately 3,000 to 20,000 Basmachi fighters under his command.\nOn 12 May 1922 GK Ordzhonikidze arrived in Bukhara from Tashkent and sharply criticized the hesitant policies of the Bukharan satellite government. Around the same time, Sh.Z. Eliava, sent to Central Asia on a special mission, telegraphed Joseph Stalin:“The situation in Bukhara can be characterized by an almost general uprising in Eastern Bukhara, according to the local data it becomes organized under the leadership of Enver. For the rescue, the immediate liquidation of Enver is necessary, which is being prepared.\"On 13 May 1922 Enver launched a broad offensive, taking Hisar, Kulab, Darvaz, Karategin, Saraykemer, Kurgantepe, Kabaduyan, Yarkand, Kashgar, Samarkand, Bukhara and most of the city of Boysun under his possession. A detailed report submitted to Galip Pasha, appointed as the Ottoman representative to Bukhara, confirmed that more than half of the territory of the Emirate of Bukhara was under Enver's military control, rather than the Soviet authority.\nAccording to Colonel Humphrys, the British diplomatic representative in Kabul, reporting to Lord Curzon on 29 May 1922, Enver had recently inflicted a heavy defeat on General Budyonny, who commanded about 50,000 men. As a result of Basmachi successes, they regained control over all of Eastern Bukhara, most of Western Bukhara, and much of the Fergana valley.\nThese defeats greatly alarmed the Bolsheviks, who spent massive resources on a counteroffensive. By June 1922, the Red Army launched a major counteroffensive, recapturing Vakjubent, Gijduvan, Kermine, Baysun, Baljuvon, Korfuk, and on June 14, 1922, the Basmachi suffered arguably their biggest loss with the fall of Dushanbe. Around this time, a civil conflict finally broke out between Ibrahim bek and Enver, leading to significant losses for Enver. By July, he attempted to retreat to Afghanistan, but he was caught in an ambush near Dushanbe in Baljuvan and died in combat against the Armenian Bolshevik commander, Yakov Melkumov, ending his revolt.\nAftermath\nThe Basmachi movement reached its peak under Enver Pasha and never quite returned to the same strength afterward. The Bolsheviks resumed their conflict with Ibrahim Bek, and at this point, the main strategy of the Basmachi involved cross-border operations along the Afghan-Soviet border. These operations ultimately culminated in direct Soviet interventions into Afghanistan, such as in 1929 when the Soviets attempted to prevent the Saqqawist takeover. The Basmachi movement truly came to an end by 1938 with the death of Junaid Khan.\nReferences"
