Stewart worked with a number of the directors of his time, including George Cukor (a frequent collaborator), Michael Curtiz and Ernst Lubitsch. Stewart was a member of the Algonquin Round Table and, with Ernest Hemingway's friend Bill Smith, the model for Bill Gorton in The Sun Also Rises. His 1922parody on etiquette, Perfect Behavior, published by George H. Doran and Co., was a favoritebook of P.G. Wodehouse.\nLife and career\nHis hometown was Columbus, Ohio.
