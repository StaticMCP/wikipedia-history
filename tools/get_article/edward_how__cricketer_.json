He was educated at Dr. Challoner's Grammar School before going up to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. While studying at Cambridge, he played first-class cricket for Cambridge University Cricket Club between 1995 and 1997, making fourteen appearances. A largely ineffective left-arm medium-fast bowler against first-class county opponents, he took 13 wickets at an average of 88.07. His one bowling performance of note came against Kent in 1997, with figures of 5 for 59. He also played football for Cambridge University A.F.C., earning a football blue.\nAfter graduating from Cambridge, How worked in the City of London for Deutsche Bank, becoming a vice president at the bank. He then changed careers, becoming a chemistry teacher at Charterhouse School, where he also coached cricket and football. How was killed in an off-piste skiing accident at Val-d'Isère in France on 28 March 2012, having fallen  to his death. He was survived by his wife and child.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
