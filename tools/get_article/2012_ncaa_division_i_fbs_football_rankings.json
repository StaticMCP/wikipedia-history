Unlike most sports, college football's governing body, the NCAA, does not bestow a national championship title. That title is bestowed by one or more of four different polling agencies. There are two main weekly polls that begin in the preseason—the AP Poll and the Coaches Poll. Two additional polls are released midway through the season; the Harris Interactive Poll is released after the sixth week of the season, and the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) standings are released after the seventh week. The Harris Poll and Coaches Poll are factors in the BCS standings. At the end of the regular season, on December 2, 2012, the BCS standings determined who would play in the BCS bowl games as well as the 2013 BCS National Championship Game on January 7, 2013, at Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D8FFEB; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Increase in ranking\n|-\n|
