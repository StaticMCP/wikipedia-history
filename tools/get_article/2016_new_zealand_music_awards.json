It took place in November 2016 at Vector Arena in Auckland and was hosted by comedy duo Jono Pryor and Ben Boyce. The awards show was broadcast live on TV3 and The Edge TV.\nNominations for the 2016 New Zealand Music Awards opened on 20 June 2016, and cover artists who have had commercial recordings released between 1 July 2015 and 31 July 2016. Nominations closed on 3 August 2016. The nominees were announced on 13 October, along with the 2016 Legacy Award recipient and the Critics' Choice Prize shortlist.\nEarly awards\nWhile most of the awards were presented at the main awards ceremony held in November, five genre awards are presented earlier in the year at ceremonies of their field.\n*The first was awarded in February, with the Tui for Best Folk Album presented at the Auckland Folk Festival in Kumeu to Queenstown singer-songwriter Holly Arrowsmith for her debut album For the Weary Traveller.\n*The Tui for Best Jazz Album was presented in March at the National Jazz Festival in Tauranga to Phil Broadhurst Quintet for their album Panacea.\n*The Best Country Music Album Tui was presented in June at the New Zealand Country Music Awards in Gore to The Warratahs for their album Runaway Days.\n*The Tui for Best Pacific Music Album was presented in June at the Vodafone Pacific Music Awards to the performance group Te Vaka for their album Amataga.\n*The Tui for the '''Best Children's Music Album' was presented in August on What Now to Itty Bitty Beats for their album Lay Your Head Down''.\nIn addition, the artisan awards (previously known as the technical awards) were presented on 20 October at a cocktail event at the Pullman Hotel in Auckland. The Critics' Choice prize event and winner announcement will be held on 2 November at the Tuning Fork bar in Auckland.\nNominees and winners\nNew for 2016, the technical awards have been renamed the artisan awards, and the Best Electronica Album award is now named Best Electronic Album. Broods dominated the awards, picking up Album of the Year, Single of the Year, Best Group, Best Pop Album and the People's Choice Award. R&B singer Aaradhna won Best Urban/Hip Hop Album, but refused to accept the award as she felt a category that included both R&B and rap acts was putting the two genres together for racial reasons. She then informally presented the award to rap group SWIDT. Recorded Music NZ still lists Aaradhna as the winner of the category.\nWinners are listed first and highlighted in boldface.\n;Key\n: – Artisan award\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!style=\"background:#FFFF99\"|Album of the Year\n!style=\"background:#FFFF99\"|Single of the Year\n|-\n|valign=top|\n*'Broods –  Conscious'\n**Aaradhna – Brown Girl\n**Fat Freddy's Drop – Bays\n**Hollie Smith – Water or Gold\n**Tami Neilson – Don’t Be Afraid\n**The Phoenix Foundation – Give Up Your Dreams\n|valign=top|\n*'Broods - Free'\n**Aaradhna - Brown Girl\n**Kings - ''Don't Worry Bout It\n**Maala - Kind of Love\n**Shapeshifter - Stars\n**The Naked and Famous - Higher\n|-\n!style=\"background:#FFFF99\"|Best Group\n!style=\"background:#FFFF99\"|Breakthrough Artist of the Year\n|-\n|valign=top|Sponsor\n*'Broods –  Conscious'''\n**Fat Freddy's Drop – Bays\n**Sol3 Mio - On Another Note\n**The Phoenix Foundation – Give Up Your Dreams\n|valign=top|Sponsor\n*'Kings - Don't Worry Bout It'\n**Leisure – All Over You\n**Nomad – Oh My My\n**Sachi – Lunch with Bianca\n|-\n!style=\"background:#FFFF99\"|Best Male Solo Artist\n!style=\"background:#FFFF99\"|Best Female Solo Artist\n|-\n|valign=top|Sponsor\n*'Maala – Composure'\n**Avalanche City – We are for the Wild Places\n**Dave Dobbyn – Harmony House\n**Lawrence Arabia – Absolute Truth\n|valign=top|Sponsor\n*'Aaradhna - Brown Girl'\n**Hollie Smith – Water or Gold\n**Ladyhawke – Wild Things\n**Tami Neilson – Don’t Be Afraid\n|-\n!style=\"background:#FFFF99\"|Best Rock Album\n!style=\"background:#FFFF99\"|Best Pop Album\n|-\n|valign=top|Sponsor\n*'Villainy - Dead Sight'\n**Beastwars - The Death of All Things\n**Jordan Luck Band - Not Only… But Also\n|valign=top|\n*'Broods – Conscious'\n**Avalanche City – We Are for the Wild Places\n**Maala - Composure\n|-\n!style=\"background:#FFFF99\"|Best Urban/Hip Hop Album\n!style=\"background:#FFFF99\"|Best Reggae/Roots Album\n|-\n|valign=top|Sponsor\n*'Aaradhna – Brown Girl'\n**SWIDT – SmokeyGotBeatz Presents SWIDT vs EVERYBODY\n**PNC – The Luke Vailima EP\n|valign=top|Sponsor\n*'Unity Pacific – Blackbirder Dread'\n**Fat Freddy's Drop – Bays\n**Rob Ruha – Pūmau\n|-\n!style=\"background:#FFFF99\"|Best Alternative Album\n!style=\"background:#FFFF99\"|Best Māori Album\n|-\n|valign=top|Sponsor\n*'Lawrence Arabia – Absolute Truth'\n**The Phoenix Foundation – Give Up Your Dreams\n**Silicon – Personal Computer\n|valign=top|Sponsor\n*'Rob Ruha – Pūmau'\n**Dennis Marsh – Maori Songbook 2\n**Kirsten Te Rito – Āiotanga\n|-\n!style=\"background:#FFFF99\"|Best Worship Album\n!style=\"background:#FFFF99\"|Best Classical Album\n|-\n|valign=top|Sponsor\n*'Edge Kingsland - Edge Vol. 3: The Common Good'\n**Grace Vineyard Music - Seek You\n**LIFE Worship - By My Spirit\n|valign=top|Sponsor\n*'Anthony Ritchie and Ross Harris – Fjärren: In the Distance'\n**Kenneth Young – Shadows and Light\n**Zephyr – Zephyr\n|-\n!style=\"background:#FFFF99\"|Best Electronic Album\n!style=\"background:#FFFF99\"|Legacy Award\n|-\n|valign=top|Sponsor\n*'Pacific Heights – The Stillness'\n**Electric Wire Hustle – Aeons\n**Opiuo – Omniversal\n|valign=top|\nAnnounced 13 October 2016\n*Bic Runga\n|-\n!style=\"background:#FFFF99\"|People's Choice Award\n!style=\"background:#FFFF99\"|Critics' Choice Prize\n|-\n|valign=top|\n*Broods\n**Fat Freddy's Drop\n**Kings\n**Maala\n**Sol3 Mio\n|valign=top|\nPresented 2 November 2016\n*Scuba Diva\n**Kane Strang\n**Spycc & INF\n|-\n!style=\"background:#FFFF99\"|Highest selling New Zealand Single\n!style=\"background:#FFFF99\"|Highest selling New Zealand Album\n|-\n|valign=top|Sponsor\n*'Six60 - White Lines\n|valign=top|Sponsor\n*Sol3 Mio - On Another Note\n|-\n!style=\"background:#FFFF99\"|Radio Airplay Record of the Year\n!style=\"background:#FFFF99\"|International Achievement Award\n|-\n|valign=top|\nNo finalists are announced in this category.\n*Six60 - White Lines''\n|valign=top|Sponsor\n*Fat Freddy's Drop\n|-\n!style=\"background:lightblue\"|Best Music Video\n!style=\"background:lightblue\"|Best Album Cover‡\n|-\n|valign=top|Presented 20 October 2016\n*Chris Lane – Inside Out (Avalanche City)'\n**Sam Peacocke – Buried by the Burden ([Pacific Heights Ft.
