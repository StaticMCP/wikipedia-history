Below the rhombus, the date December 7, 1787, declares the day on which Delaware became the first state to ratify the United States Constitution. The colors of the flag reflect the colors of the uniform of General George Washington.\nHistory\nDuring the American Civil War, regiments from Delaware flew a flag which was similar to the current state flag. The design had the state coat of arms on a field of blue. In 1910 the USS Delaware was given a state flag by members of Daughters of the American revolution. It bore the state's coat of arms with the federally's logo on a blue field. The banner measured around 4 x 5 feet.\nThe current flag was adopted on July 24, 1913. In 1946 Governor Walter Bacon gave Denmark a variant of the state flag with a golden rhombus instead of a bluff one, to celebrate the rebuilding of a park near Aalborg.\nThe coat of arms in the center of the flag was adopted on January 17, 1777. It depicts a shield of horizontal orange, blue, and white stripes. On the stripes are a sheaf of wheat, an ear of corn, and an ox standing on grass, all representing Delaware's agriculture. Above the shield is a sailing ship. Supporting the shield are a farmer on the left and a soldier on the right. The state motto, below the shield, reads \"Liberty and Independence\". These symbols are also included on the seal of Delaware.\nIn 2001, a survey conducted by the North American Vexillological Association (NAVA) placed Delaware's flag 52nd in design quality out of the 72 Canadian provincial, U.S. state and U.S. territorial flags ranked.\nLaws that enact the flag\nThe design of the official state flag shall be as follows: A background of colonial blue surrounding a diamond of buff in which diamond is placed the correct coat of arms of the state in the colors prescribed by law and in accordance with §301 of this title, with the date, \"December 7, 1787\", to be inscribed underneath.\nThe official state colors, colonial blue and buff, are designated by the Textile Color Card Association of the United States, Inc., New York, as \"armor blue\" (Cable No. 10663), and \"golden beige\" (Cable No. 10781) respectively; the color shades having been determined by Colorimetric Specifications of the National Bureau of Standards, United States Department of Commerce, in Test No. 2, 1/140565, dated November 18, 1954, which is on file with the Delaware Public Archives, Dover, Delaware.

The pole upon which the governor's flag is carried shall have mounted thereon a model of a blue hen's fighting cock.\nIn 1909, Governor John Reybold carried his own flag, but its design is unknown.\nGallery\nFile:Delaware_state_flag.jpg|Vintage state flag with a golden rhombus and no text.\nFile:Delaware Bicentennial 13c 1976 issue.jpg|The Delaware state flag as depicted in the 1976 bicentennial postage stamp series.\nFile:Delaware State Fair - 2012 (7681655554).jpg|Large Delaware flag hanging  inside Quillen Arena.\nimage:2022-07-20 08 10 08 Delaware state flag flying on the southwest side of the Delaware Legislative Hall (Delaware Capitol Building) in Dover, Kent County, Delaware.jpg|The Delaware flag flying at the Delaware Legislative Hall.\nSee also\n*Symbols of the state of Delaware\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=pnVcfj-MmCEC&dq=delaware+flag&pg=PA621 Origin and History of the American Flag and of the Naval and Yacht-club Signals, Seals and Arms, and Principal National Songs of the United States, with a Chronicle of the Symbols, Standards, Banners, and Flags of Ancient and Modern Nations], Volume 2, by George Henry Preble, Charles Edward Asnis 1917.
