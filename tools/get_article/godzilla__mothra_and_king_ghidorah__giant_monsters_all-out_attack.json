The 26th film in the Godzilla franchise and the third of the Millennium era, it serves as a direct sequel to the original 1954 film, ignoring the events of every other installment in the series (albeit briefly referencing the 1998 American film). Chiharu Niiyama stars as a reporter covering the story of Mothra, King Ghidorah, and Baragon defending Japan from Godzilla, an undead creature possessed by the souls of those killed during the Pacific War. The supporting cast includes Ryudo Uzaki, Masahiro Kobayashi, Hideyo Amamoto (in his final film role), and Shirō Sano, with Mizuho Yoshida as Godzilla, Akira Ohashi as Ghidorah, and Rie Ōta as Baragon.\nKaneko originally slated Godzilla to face off against a revamped version of Kamacuras but ultimately decided to place Godzilla against three monsters representing elements of the Earth. The initial three monsters he pitched were Varan, Baragon, and Anguirus, however, Toho later convinced him to replace Varan and Anguirus with King Ghidorah and Mothra to attract more public interest. Principal photography began on May 11, 2001, on a  budget, at Toho Studios, and wrapped on August 9.\nGodzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah premiered at the Tokyo International Film Festival on November 3, 2001. Toho later released it throughout Japan on December 15. The film earned  internationally and tied in Japan for the position of the third-highest-grossing domestic film during 2002. Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah received generally positive reviews from critics, with many considering it among the best in the Godzilla franchise.\nGodzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah was accompanied by a Hamtaro double feature, Hamtaro: Adventures in Ham-Ham Land.\nThe film was followed by Masaaki Tezuka's Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla, which is set in a different continuity, was released on December 14, 2002.\nPlot\nDuring a briefing with the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) regarding the first Godzilla's attack and death, admiral Taizo Tachibana is alerted about an American nuclear submarine that went missing off Guam. Search and rescue units find the submarine destroyed and capture footage of the creature's dorsal plates nearby.\nTachibana's daughter and reporter, Yuri, films a docudrama with her production crew at Mount Myōkō, where a mysterious earthquake briefly occurs. It occurs again later that night, burying a biker gang and leaving a surviving trucker, who witnesses the subterranean monster Baragon. The next day, Yuri's colleague Teruaki Takeda supports her theory that a monster may have caused the mysterious earthquakes and gives her a book called The Guardian Monsters.\nAt Lake Ikeda, Mothra in her larval form attacks a group of teenage vandals who disturbed her shrine and builds her cocoon. Yuri interviews Hirotoshi Isayama, an mysterious old man who explains the legend of the guardian monsters, iterating that they must be awakened before Godzilla, an undead creature, destroys Japan. Yuri and her colleagues visit the guardian monsters' shrine, where she finds a stone before returning to continue interviewing Isayama. In the process, she discovers that the souls of soldiers and civilians who were killed during the Pacific War are embedded within Godzilla and are lashing out due to modern Japan's denial of its past crimes. Meanwhile in Aokigahara, a suicidal man accidentally encounters a frozen 1,000-year-old ancient dragon called King Ghidorah.\nGodzilla and Baragon surface and battle in Hakone, with the former killing the latter. Yuri is injured during the fray and goes on her own after Takeda refuses to take her to Godzilla's location. After the jets fail to stop Godzilla, Tachibana sets up a defense line in Yokohama. Mothra metamorphoses into her imago form and joins Ghidorah in battling Godzilla, but are overpowered. Godzilla attempts to attack the soldiers, but Mothra sacrifices herself and imbues her spirit into Ghidorah. An empowered Ghidorah injures and drags Godzilla underwater. Amidst this, Tachibana and his colleague Yutaka Hirose board miniature submarines to launch D-3 missiles into Godzilla's wound.\nDuring Yuri and Takeda report on the struggle from Yokohama Bay Bridge that later collapses from Godzilla's atomic breath, the shrine stone falls from Takeda's pocket and revives Ghidorah, who saves Yuri and Takeda from their fall before they swim ashore while the monsters continue to fight. Godzilla kills Ghidorah, which unleash the spirits of the guardian monsters to drag Godzilla underwater, allowing Tachibana enters Godzilla's body through its mouth. As Godzilla attempts to kill Yuri and Takeda, Tachibana fires a D-3 missile at its wound, causing its atomic breath to escape through the gaping wound and build pressure within Godzilla. Tachibana escapes as Godzilla sinks and explodes after attempting to kill the former with its atomic breath.\nAs Japan rejoices at their victory, Yuri's colleagues discover all trace of Isayama has vanished from their recordings and that he was killed during the first Godzilla attack. Meanwhile, Yuri reunites with Tachibana, who salutes his colleagues and the guardian monsters. On the ocean floor, Godzilla's disembodied heart continues to beat.\nCast\nas Baragon, a subterranean dinosaurian creature and one of Japan's guardian monsters.\n** Ōta also makes a cameo as a fishery staff member at Yaizu Harbor.\n**  as the stunt actor for Baragon.\n}}\nOther cast members include Yukijirō Hotaru as a suicidal man who accidentally discovers Ghidorah;  as Adjutant Miyashita;  as the director of BS Digital Q;  as Jun Maruo, an assistant director at BS Digital Q; Masahiko Tsugawa as the Chief Cabinet Secretary; Katsuo Nakamura and Ryo Kase as fishermen in Yaizu; Tomoe Shinohara as an inn guest; and Koichi Yamadera as a television producer. Ai and Aki Maeda portray twin sisters watching Mothra flying over Kagoshima, paying homage to the monster's twin prietesses from her eponymous 1961 film.\nCameo appearances include Godzilla 2000 (1999) star Takehiro Murata as a pilot while Kōichi Kawakita and Godzilla vs. Megaguirus (2000) director Masaaki Tezuka make uncredited appearances as a JASDF officer and a JSDF officer, respectively.\nProduction\nDevelopment\n, seen in 2023, directed and co-wrote the film]]\nProducer Shōgo Tomiyama had considered selecting Kaneko to direct a Godzilla film since the filmmaker first approached him with the idea during the development of Godzilla vs. Mothra (1992). Kaneko later impressed Tomiyama by making the critically-acclaimed Gamera film trilogy (1995-1999) and Pyrokinesis (2000). During the production of Godzilla vs. Megaguirus (2000), the producer and his superiors met with Kaneko and agreed he should conceive the next installment.\nKaneko cycled through various script ideas while attempting to devise the film. At first, he suggested having Godzilla battle Kamacuras, his son's favorite kaiju, but this was scrapped because Godzilla had fought a similar insectoid kaiju in the previous entry. His next proposal concerned Godzilla facing off against an astronaut who becomes a monster after being exposed to cosmic rays, which Toho executives strongly rejected. He then envisoned the monster fighting three divine kaiju, who he felt should be Anguirus, Varan and Baragon. They approved of this, but told him to replace Anguirus and Varan with the more popular Mothra and King Ghidorah. After silently considering the suggestion for 15 minutes in their office, Kaneko concluded that he could meet their requirements for this film despite his initial skepticism.\nAn announcement for the film's development was scheduled to occur on December 16, 2000—the release date of Godzilla vs. Megaguirus—but was cancelled. Kaneko told reporter Norman England on that same day, \"The Toho heads have decided to commit only if the current film lives up to box-office expectations\". Godzilla vs. Megaguirus became a box-office bomb (grossing  against its  budget), substantially affecting the planning of Kaneko's film. Regardless, Tomiyama and executives agreed to let Kaneko continue developing the film, having gained enough faith that he would deliver a critical and commercial hit.\nWriting and themes\nKaneko co-wrote the film's screenplay with Keiichi Hasegawa and Masahiro Yokotani, which had Godzilla's role replacing that of King Ghidorah in Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster (1964). Furthermore, Godzilla's radioactive element was replaced with a mystical element, as its origins are rooted in Japan's past during World War II. While Godzilla is still a mutant dinosaur that was created by the atomic bomb, it is also described as the embodiment of those killed or left to die at the hands of the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces during the Pacific War. The extent to which his nuclear and spiritual origins balance is never specified. Kaneko, a lifelong pacifist, wanted to give the film an anti-war angle. The nuclear origin was left in because he believed audiences wanted a realistic Godzilla, but he believed it worked better with a fantasy element. The screenwriters ultimately completed the script for the film on April 20, 2001.\nA reference to Godzilla (1998) featured in the film was converted and added by Kaneko in an early draft of the script as a joke due to that film's unpopularity. The inclusion of the dialogue about a similar monster attacking New York a few years before reinforces that monsters exist worldwide in the film's universe.\nPre-production\nKaneko was expecting the appointment and had already had discussions with suit creator Fuyuki Shinada about collaborating on a Godzilla project. He soon hired many of his collaborators on his Gamera trilogy and other films he had directed.\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on May 11, 2001, in Studio 1 at Toho Studios. The first two scenes filmed were the encounters with the frozen Ghidorah, for which a set was created to depict the interior of a cave; Yukijirō Hotaru's scene at the location was shot on the first day, with Hideyo Amamoto's shot the following day. At the start of photography, Kaneko expressed on-set that he felt \"One difference between Toho and Daiei is the quality of the sets. On Gamera, we had little money, so I had to film on location. At Toho, with over twice the budget, I can have sets built to order.\"\nThe three months of filming wrapped on August 9, 2001.\nSpecial effects\nSpecial effects photography began on May 17, 2001, in Studio 9 at Toho Studios and concluded on August 24, 2001.\nRelease\nTheatrical run\nGodzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack opened in Japan on December 15, 2001 on a double-bill with the anime film Hamtaro: Ham Ham Big Land Adventure. In its opening weekend, it grossed approximately $1,900,000. By the end of its box office run, Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack grossed a total of approximately  (), with 2,400,000 admissions. It was one of the largest-grossing Godzilla films of the Millennium series in Japan. According to IGN, the film \"rescued\" the series since the two previous Millennium films were box-office bombs.\nHome media\nThe film was released on DVD on August 21, 2002 and on VHS that December. A re-edit of the film was broadcast on Japanese television in 2002; this version became the last effort for the film's editor Isao Tomita, who died in October of that year. It was released on DVD on January 27, 2004, and on Blu-ray, bundled with Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla, on September 9, 2014.\nEnglish version\nAfter the film was completed, Toho had their international versions of the movie dubbed in Hong Kong. This dubbed version significantly changes the meaning of several lines throughout the film.\nSony licensed GMK and Godzilla vs. Megaguirus with the hope of giving both films a theatrical release in the United States. However, after the American release of Godzilla 2000 under-performed at the box office, plans to give any newer Godzilla films a wide release were scrapped. Instead, Sony prepared edited television versions of both films. These premiered in the United States on the Sci-Fi Channel on August 31, 2003, during the channel's Labor Day marathon. In February 2004, the uncut international versions of both films were released on DVD with the addition of the original Japanese soundtracks, a first for an American release of a Godzilla film.\nReception\nGodzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack received mostly positive critical reviews. It was awarded the Excellence/Silver Award at the 40th .\nKatsuhito Itō of Hobby Japan felt the film is the best kaiju movie since the original 1954 Godzilla film. Troy Guinn of Eccentric Cinema gave the film a score of 8 out of 10, calling it \"one of only three Godzilla films I would recommend to anyone besides giant monster-movie fans or sci-fi buffs, the other two being the original Gojira  and Mothra vs. Godzilla.\" Bryan Byun of DVD Verdict gave it a positive review, calling it \"one of the most exciting entries in Godzilla's long cinematic history.\" Stomp Tokyo gave the film a score of 3 out of 5, calling it \"one of the better-looking entries in the series, albeit one of unfulfilled potential.\"\nJohn Wallis of DVD Talk felt that \"the story is quite weak and somber\" and that \"this new take on [Godzilla] doesn't really work,\" while Gemma Tarlach of the Milwaukee Journal said that \"GMK is best when it embraces its unabashed cheesiness. But when it tries to make Statements with Meaning, whether on Japan's past aggressions or ersatz samurai ruminations on the duty of a warrior, the movie flounders like a giant lizard hogtied by power lines.\" The Boston Globes Wesley Morris praised the film for meeting the expectation that it would be as ridiculous as the lengthy title suggested. He felt the final battle was its main flaw, citing how Baragon was \"just a bumbling warm-up act\" for Mothra who was \"equally useless\" when fighting Godzilla. Jamie Healy of the Radio Times rated it 3 out of 5 saying that as a result of the sheer power of Godzilla \"this project comes slightly undone, as he's made into such an all-conquering badass as to be nigh-on indestructible.\"\nA retrospective capsule review in ''Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide'' assessed that \"Kaneko was brought in 'shake things up,' and he certainly succeeded with this dark, very violent epic\". The critic noted how it is \"considered by many fans to be the apex of the series, with terrific special effects and a consistently adult tone; worth seeing even for nondevotees .\" In 2021, the film was ranked at number 14 on Variety's list \"All the Godzilla Movies Ranked\" In 2023, Collider ranked GMK as the best film in the series, listing it higher than the 1954 film and Godzilla vs. Destoroyah (1995). That same year, Comic Book Resources listed it number 12 on their ranking of every film. As of 2024, it is the 18th highest-rated Godzilla film on Rotten Tomatoes.\nLegacy\nThe film's miniature Yokohama set was later utilized in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill: Volume 1, doubling as Tokyo for a sequence in which the Bride arrives in the city. The set was provided by Shinji Higuchi, who acted as Tarantino's production coordinator in Japan.\nIn 2023, critically acclaimed filmmaker Takashi Yamazaki cited Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack as one of his favorite Godzilla films. He stated in a discussion with Kaneko at a screening of GMK, that the film had a major influence on his 2023 film Godzilla Minus One: \"I had forgotten the contents of GMK for a while, but it seems like I self-consciously thought about it when writing the scenario for [Minus One]. Without realizing it, I was under considerable influence\".\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*\n* Watch the documentary Project GMK (2001) (Japanese with English subtitles)"
