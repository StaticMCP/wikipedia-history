Buckingham began her career in 2011, after finishing fifth in the second season of Česko Slovenská SuperStar, the joint Czech-Slovak version of Idol.\nBorn in Switzerland to an American father and Iranian mother, Buckingham settled with her family in Slovakia at the age of three. After beginning her professional career with Česko Slovenská SuperStar, Buckingham released the singles \"Blue Guitar\" and \"Nobody Knows\", both of which became top ten radio hits in Slovakia. The singles were followed by the release of her debut studio album ''Don't Look Back (2012). While a moderate commercial success, the album spawned the release of the single \"Run Run Run\", becoming a number-one radio hit in both Slovakia and the Czech Republic, and the most-played song of the year by a Slovak artist. Buckingham has since gone on to release four additional studio albums as an independent artist: Where I Belong (2013), So Far So Good (2015), BARE (2017), and Life (2022).\nIn addition to music, Buckingham has additionally worked as a model and television host, and was a judge on X Factor Česko a Slovensko, the Czech-Slovak version of The X Factor'', in 2014. In 2007, she authored and released the children's picture book The Lost Princess (2007), cowritten by her younger sister Carmel.\nEarly life and education\n|source = —Buckingham about her native-like Slovak (SME, 29 August 2012)\n|width  = 29%\n|align  = right\n}}\nBuckingham was born on 3 May 1995 in Zürich to a culturally diverse family. Her father, Thomas (born 1954), is an American from Chicago with British-Irish origins, while her mother, Zarin (born 1961), is Iranian with Russian heritage. Shortly after Buckingham's birth, the family relocated to Anchorage, Alaska in the United States, where her father worked as a cardiologist. Buckingham is the elder of two sisters: her younger sister is Carmel (born 1998).\nIn 1999, the family left Alaska and relocated to Slovakia, after Buckingham's father was offered a job there. After arriving in Slovakia, they settled in the village of Borinka, outside of Bratislava. Despite initially planning to only spend a year in Slovakia, they ultimately remained there indefinitely. Upon beginning school in Slovakia, Buckingham could not speak the Slovak language and was teased by her peers for this inability, although she soon became fluent. Buckingham was later educated at Forel International School, an international school in Bratislava, founded by her mother. In 2012, she began studying music at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee.\nBuckingham developed an interest in music at a young age, and began taking lessons in classical ballet and Latin dance, while learning to play the piano and guitar. In 2007, she and her sister coauthored the children's picture book The Lost Princess, released by Divis-Slovakia.\nCareer\n2011–2012: Česko Slovenská SuperStar and ''Don't Look Back\nBuckingham began her professional career in 2011, after auditioning for season two of Česko Slovenská SuperStar, the joint Czech-Slovak version of Idol. Buckingham had been encouraged to audition for the series by record producers Martin Šrámek and Andrej Hruška. Buckingham went on to pass her audition, and finished the competition in tenth place, being eliminated in week two of the finals.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" style=\"background:#BFBFBF;\"| Česko Slovenská SuperStar season 2 performances and results\n|-\n!Week #\n!Theme\n!Song choice\n!Original artist\n!Order #\n!Result\n|-\n|Audition\n|Bratislava\n|\"Because of You\"\n|Kelly Clarkson\n|rowspan=\"4\"|N/A\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Advanced\n|-\n|Top 100\n|Theatre Week Round 1 – Groups\n|colspan=2\n|-\n|Top 80\n|Theatre Week Round 2 – Quartets\n|\"Hey, Soul Sister\"\n|Train\n|-\n|Top 40\n|Dlouhá cesta\n|colspan=2\n|-\n|Top 24\n|Semifinal Round 1 – Girls\n|\"Unfaithful\"\n|Rihanna\n|12\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Safe\n|-\n|Top 20\n|Semifinal Round 2 – Girls\n|\"Mercy\"\n|Duffy\n|10\n|-\n|Top 16\n|Semifinal Round 3 – Girls\n|\"Listen\"\n|Beyoncé\n|8\n|-\n|Top 12\n|My Idol\n|\"You Had Me\"\n|Joss Stone\n|11\n|-\n|Top 10\n|Czech and Slovak Hits\n|\"Nekráčaj predo mnou\"\n|Zuzana Smatanová\n|9\n|Eliminated\n|-\n|}\nFollowing her elimination, Buckingham signed a recording contract with EMI Czech Republic to begin a career as a solo artist. In the aftermath of the competition, Buckingham spoke negatively of her experiences, stating that she and other contestants had no choice of songs and were frequently involved in disputes with directors and each other. She later released the singles \"Blue Guitar\" and \"Nobody Knows\" in July and November 2011, respectively, both of which became top ten radio hits in Slovakia. She later collaborated with Slovak rapper Majk Spirit on the song \"Ja a ty\" in February 2012, before releasing her debut studio album Don't Look Back in April. Coinciding with the release of Don't Look Up'' was the release of her third solo single \"Run Run Run\". The song went on to become a hit in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, topping both countries' radio songs charts and peaking at number-two on each country's overall singles charts. \"Run Run Run\" additionally became the most-played song by a Slovak artist of the year, and the second most-played song of the year in the Czech Republic.\nFollowing the commercial success of \"Run Run Run\", Buckingham won New Artist of the Year at the 2012 Slávik Awards and Best Female Singer at the 2012 OTO Awards, while also being nominated for Female Singer of the Year at the Slávik Awards, and for Best Czech & Slovak Act at the 2012 MTV Europe Music Awards.\n2013–present: Independent artist\nin 2017]]\nBuckingham ended her collaboration with EMI Czech Republic in late 2012, and continued her career as an independent musician. She later released the single \"Never Be You\" in November 2012, to serve as the lead single to her upcoming second studio album. The song was a moderate hit in Slovakia, but became a top ten radio hit in the Czech Republic. The song was followed by the release of \"I Was Wrong\" in May 2013, Buckingham's second collaboration with Majk Spirit. \"I Was Wrong\" went on to become Buckingham's second number-one radio hit in Slovakia, while also peaking at number-two on the Slovak overall singles chart. She went on to win Best Female Singer for the second consecutive year at the 2013 OTO Awards, while also becoming the final winner of Best Czech & Slovak Act at the 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards, following the category's discontinuation the following year.\nBibliography\n*2007, The Lost Princess with Carmel Buckingham (illustrated by Georgina Soar)\nDiscography\n*''Don't Look Back (2012)\n*Where I Belong (2013)\n*So Far So Good (2015)\n*BARE (2017)\n*Life (2022)\nFilmography\nReality shows\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
