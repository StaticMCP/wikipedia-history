Wellington Ruckstuhl to build it. The monument was dedicated on May 2, 1903.\nThe statue shows Glory supporting a fallen soldier, his standard lowered but her wreath of History held high. The inscription at the base of the monument read, \"GLORIA VICTIS\", meaning \"Glory to the Vanquished\" and To The Soldiers and Sailors of Maryland in the Service of The Confederate States of America, 1861–1865. On the right side it read: \"Deo vindice\", on the left: \"Fatti maschii, parole femine\" and on the rear Glory Stands Beside Our Grief. Erected by the Maryland Daughters of the Confederacy, February 1903.\nThe monument was marked in June 2015, with \"Black Lives Matter\" scrawled across its side in the aftermath of the Charleston church shooting. In August 2017, its statue was covered with red paint. It was removed during the same month along with all other Confederate monuments in the city after the Baltimore City Council unanimously voted on August 14, 2017, to have it removed along with the Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee Monument, the Roger B. Taney Sculpture, and the Confederate Women's Monument.\nSee also\n* List of Confederate monuments and memorials\n* List of public art in Baltimore\n* Removal of Confederate monuments and memorials\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
