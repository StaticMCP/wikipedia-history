This was their first season as a member of the newly formed MEAC. Led by fifth-year head coach Arnold Jeter, the Hornets compiled an overall record of 1–8 and a mark of 1–5 in conference play, tying for sixth in the MEAC. The team played most of the season with mainly freshmen and sophomores, as many veteran players were suspended after being involved in a drug scandal.\nSchedule\n| site_stadium = Alumni Stadium\n| site_cityst = Dover, DE\n| score = 7–14\n| attend =\n| source =\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium = John A.
