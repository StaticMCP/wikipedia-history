It is based at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton.\nI Marine Expeditionary Force is the largest of the three MEFs in the Fleet Marine Force and is often referred to as the \"Warfighting MEF\" for its consistent involvement and contributions in major armed conflicts. It is presently commanded by Lieutenant General Michael Cederholm. The deputy commander is Brigadier General Michael R. Nakonieczny.\nEtymology\nPronunciation of the Roman numeral designator: As a Roman numeral the capital letter \"I\", representing one, is properly pronounced as \"One\". However, there are some who erroneously pronounce the number as either \"First\", or either intentionally, or unknowingly, pronounce it as \"Eye\", as in the letter \"I\".\nThe convention of using Roman numerals to designate a MEF, which is itself the Marine Corps equivalent organization to an Army corps, stems from the U.S. Army practice that began during the First World War, and continues today, of numbering corps (two or more divisions with supporting troops, and sometimes including separate brigades, regiments, groups, or battalions, all under a unified corps headquarters, usually commanded by a lieutenant general) with Roman numerals. Corps, themselves being the first-level sub-unit of a \"field army\", or a numbered, or named, army (e.g., First U.S. Army, or the Army of the Potomac).\nDuring the First World War, the 4th Marine Brigade, as part of the U.S. Army 2nd Infantry Division, came under the U.S. Army I Corps, American Expeditionary Forces. With the expansion of the Marine Corps to six divisions and five air wings during the Second World War, the Marine Corps created two \"Amphibious Corps\", I Marine Amphibious Corps (later re-designated as III Amphibious Corps) and V Amphibious Corps, continuing the custom begun by the Army. Modern Marine Expeditionary Forces, or MEFs (for a time known as Marine Amphibious [italics added] Forces, or MABs) continue the U.S. Marine Corps legacy as corps-equivalent organizations designated by Roman numerals.\nMission\nWhen directed, I MEF deploys and is employed as a Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) in support of Combatant Commander (COCOM) requirements for contingency response or Major Theater War; with appropriate augmentation, serves as the core element of a Joint Task Force (JTF); prepares and deploys combat-ready MAGTF's to support COCOM presence and crisis response; and supports service and COCOM initiatives as required.\nLineage\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black; background:white;float: right;text-align: center\" cellpadding=\"3\"\n|-\n!
