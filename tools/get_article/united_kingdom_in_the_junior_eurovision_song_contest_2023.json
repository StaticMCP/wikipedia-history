This jury judged each entry based on: vocal capacity; the stage performance; the song's composition and originality; and the overall impression by the act. In addition, no member of a national jury was permitted to be related in any way to any of the competing acts in such a way that they cannot vote impartially and independently. The individual rankings of each jury member were released shortly after the contest.\nThe following members comprised the British jury:\n* Aaron Renfree – Former S Club Juniors member, choreographer\n* Jamie Birkett – West End singer, actress\n* Ngunan Adamu – Radio DJ, broadcaster\n* Josh Caslin – Child star, opened Eurovision Song Contest 2023 in Liverpool\n* Kristin-Leigh – Performer, backing dancer for Freya Skye in 2022\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable collapsible plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n|+\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Draw\n! scope=\"col\" | Country\n! scope=\"col\" | Juror A\n! scope=\"col\" | Juror B\n! scope=\"col\" | Juror C\n! scope=\"col\" | Juror D\n! scope=\"col\" | Juror E\n! scope=\"col\" | Rank\n! scope=\"col\" | Points\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 01\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |\n| 10\n| 6\n| 5\n| style=\"background:#CC9966;\" | 3\n| style=\"background:silver;\" | 2\n| style=\"background:#CC9966;\" | 3\n| style=\"background:#CC9966;\" | 8\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 02\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |\n| style=\"background:#CC9966;\" | 3\n| 7\n| style=\"background:silver;\" | 2\n| 10\n| 8\n| 7\n| 4\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 03\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |\n| 5\n| 8\n| 10\n| 14\n| 15\n| 10\n| 1\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 04\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |\n| 12\n| 15\n| 15\n| 13\n| 11\n| 15\n| style=\"background:#AAAAAA;\" |\n|-class=\"sortbottom\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 05\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |\n| style=\"background:#AAAAAA;\" |\n| style=\"background:#AAAAAA;\" |\n| style=\"background:#AAAAAA;\" |\n| style=\"background:#AAAAAA;\" |\n| style=\"background:#AAAAAA;\" |\n| style=\"background:#AAAAAA;\" |\n| style=\"background:#AAAAAA;\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 06\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |\n| 15\n| 14\n| 11\n| 8\n| 14\n| 13\n| style=\"background:#AAAAAA;\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 07\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |\n| 13\n| 9\n| 6\n| 4\n| 9\n| 9\n| 2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 08\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |\n| style=\"background:gold;\" | 1\n| style=\"background:gold;\" | 1\n| 7\n| style=\"background:gold;\" | 1\n| 6\n| style=\"background:gold;\" | 1\n| style=\"background:gold;\" | 12\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 09\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |\n| 8\n| style=\"background:#CC9966;\" | 3\n| style=\"background:#CC9966;\" | 3\n| style=\"background:silver;\" | 2\n| style=\"background:gold;\" | 1\n| style=\"background:silver;\" | 2\n| style=\"background:silver;\" | 10\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 10\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |\n| 4\n| 5\n| 13\n| 7\n| 3\n| 8\n| 3\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 11\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |\n| 11\n| 11\n| 12\n| 12\n| 7\n| 11\n| style=\"background:#AAAAAA;\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 12\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |\n| 7\n| 4\n| 4\n| 5\n| 5\n| 5\n| 6\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 13\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |\n| style=\"background:silver;\" | 2\n| style=\"background:silver;\" | 2\n| 8\n| 6\n| 10\n| 4\n| 7\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 14\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |\n| 9\n| 10\n| 14\n| 11\n| 12\n| 12\n| style=\"background:#AAAAAA;\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 15\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |\n| 14\n| 13\n| 9\n| 15\n| 13\n| 14\n| style=\"background:#AAAAAA;\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 16\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |\n| 6\n| 12\n| style=\"background:gold;\" | 1\n| 9\n| 4\n| 6\n| 5\n|}\nReferences"
