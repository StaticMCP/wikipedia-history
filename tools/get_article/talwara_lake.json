The lake forms only for a few months every year during the annual flooding of the Ghaggar-Hakra river in the monsoon season. It is located between Ellenabad and Hanumangarh town, nearly 40&nbsp;km downstream of the Ottu barrage and reservoir (in the Sirsa district of Haryana). This village population is nearly 15000 and a subtehsil of Hanumangarh district.\nHistorical significance\nThis place has been established by historians as the site of the First Battle of Tarain of 1191 and the Second Battle of Tarain of 1192 between Prithviraj Chauhan and Muhammad Ghori.\nIn his invasion of India in 1398-99 CE, Timur encamped at the banks of this lake after overpowering Bhatner fort in modern-day Hanumangarh.\nSee also\n*List of lakes in India\nReferences"
