      "text": "# The Last Supper (Warhol)\n\nThe Last Supper is a series of paintings created by the pop artist Andy Warhol (1929–1987) between 1984 and 1986 based on the famed Last Supper (c. 1495–1498) by Leonardo da Vinci.\nArt dealer Alexander Iolas commissioned the series in 1984. Warhol's January 1987 trip for the debut in Milan was the artist's last voyage out of New York City. Warhol died shortly after the Milan premier, soon followed by the death of Iolas.\nThe Museo del Novecento held a 2017 exhibition of the works in honor of the thirtieth anniversary of their Milanese debut.\nSome art scholars including Jessica Beck a curator at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh have posited that they are an artistic response by Warhol to the AIDS crisis.\nThe paintings are discussed in depth in \"Loving the Alien\", the sixth and final episode of the 2022 Netflix docuseries The Andy Warhol Diaries.\nReferences"
