Of the total 2,619 burials, the cemetery contains 2,338 Canadian soldiers. It was built to a design by Commission architect Philip Hepworth.\nHistory\nThe cemetery is unique in that many of the dead were brought here from nearby Germany. It is one of the few cases where bodies were moved across international frontiers. It is believed that all fallen Canadian soldiers of the Rhineland battles, who were buried in German battlefields, were re-interred here (except for one who is buried in Reichswald Forest War Cemetery). General Crerar, who commanded Canadian land forces in Europe, ordered that Canadian dead were not to be buried in German soil.\nThe cemetery also has a Cross of Sacrifice within it.\nThousands of Dutch children tend the graves of the soldiers buried here as they do throughout the Netherlands.\nCommemoration\nWithin the cemetery stands the Groesbeek Memorial, which commemorates members of the Commonwealth land forces who died during the campaign in north-west Europe between the time of crossing the Seine River at the end of August 1944 and the end of the war in Europe. There are 1,016 names on the memorial; although since the date of completion of the name-panels, graves have been found for four men commemorated by it. The Bayeux Memorial in Normandy, France honours 103 Canadian servicemen and women.\nThe memorial consists of twin colonnaded buildings which face each other across the grass forecourt of the cemetery, between the entrance and the \"Stone of Remembrance.\" The names of the men whose graves are unknown are inscribed in panels of Portland stone built into the rear walls.\nInternational Four Days Marches Nijmegen\nOn the third day of the International Four Days Marches Nijmegen, the route leads along the Canadian military cemetery, and the military participants commemorate their colleagues from the Second World War during an impressive ceremonial gathering.\nNotable graves\n*Aubrey Cosens (1921–1945) of the Queen's Own Rifles of Canada VC\n*John Baskeyfield (1922–1944) of the South Staffordshire Regiment VC is remembered on the memorial.\n*Gustave Biéler, Frank Pickersgill and Roméo Sabourin, Canadian members of the Special Operations Executive who were sent undercover into occupied France; all three were caught by the Germans and sent to concentration camps, where they were executed.
