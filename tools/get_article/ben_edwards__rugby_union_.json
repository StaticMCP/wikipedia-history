He became a lock forward and developed a reputation for his long range place kicks, which included a successful 64-yard effort in a match for Newport.\nIn 1951, Edwards received his solitary Wales cap, during a season in which he set a new Newport points-scoring record. He played the fixture against Ireland in Cardiff and kicked a penalty from just inside the halfway line to open the scoring, with the match finishing in a 3–3 draw. Edward's penalty prevented Ireland from achieving the grand slam.\nEdwards ended his rugby career at Ebbw Vale and later settled in Gloucestershire, where he was employed by Imperial Chemical Industries. He volunteered as chairman of his local Outward Bound branch, for which he was awarded an MBE in the 1978 Birthday Honours during the final months of his life.\nSee also\n*List of Wales national rugby union players\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
