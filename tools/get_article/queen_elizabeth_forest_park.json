The forest park is one of six such parks in Scotland, and was established in 1953, the year of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. It is owned and managed by Forestry and Land Scotland.\nGeography\nThe park is part of Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park and is a sparsely populated region of mountains, hills, lochs and valleys. Most of the upland areas are bare and uncultivated, while much of the lowland is densely forested.\nWithin the park are several mountains including Ben Lomond, which at  is the highest point, Ben Venue () and Ben Ledi (). Its lakes and reservoirs include Loch Ard, Loch Chon, Loch Venachar, Loch Arklet, Loch Katrine, Loch Achray and Loch Drunkie. Its forests include Achray Forest, Buchanan Forest, Strathyre Forest and Loch Ard Forest.\nTourism\nThe main visitor centre for the area is The Lodge Forest Visitor Centre at Aberfoyle on the edge of the highlands on the eastern hillside of Craigmore (). There are marked hiking trails and a car trail, the Three Lochs Forest Drive.\nGallery\nFile:Achray Forest - geograph.org.uk - 669038.jpg|Loch Drunkie in the Achray Forest, seen from the Duke's Pass\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://forestryandland.gov.scot/visit/forest-parks/queen-elizabeth-forest-park Queen Elizabeth Forest Park] - Forestry and Land Scotland"
