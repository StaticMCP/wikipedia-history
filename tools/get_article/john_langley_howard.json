His siblings included Henry Temple Howard (1894–1967), Robert Boardman Howard (1896–1983), Charles Houghton Howard (1899–1978), and Jeanette Howard Wallace (1905–1998). The family moved to California in 1904. They settled in Berkeley, where John Galen Howard was hired to supervise the erection of the Hearst Memorial Mining Building at the University of California, Berkeley.\nJohn Langley Howard attended University of California, Berkeley and studied engineering and English for one semester, leaving in 1922. He switched to study art and initially enrolled in California College of Arts and Crafts and later at Art Students League of New York with Kenneth Hayes Miller.\nHe painted one of the Coit Tower murals, California Industrial Scenes. The mural was designed as a result of the atrocity of the Great Depression, and featured Karl Marx imagery which caused controversy when it was unveiled.\nFrom 1953 until 1965, Howard illustrated many covers for Scientific American magazine. He also created illustrations for Sports Illustrated magazine.\nHoward was married three times Adelaide Scofield Day Howard (in 1925); Blanche Phillips (in 1949); and Mary McMahon (in 1980).\nHe died on November 15, 1999, in his home in the Potrero Hill neighborhood of San Francisco, California.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oral-history-interview-john-langley-howard-and-mary-howard-6024 Oral history Interview with John Langley Howard and Mary Howard, 1991 Sept. 5], from Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution\n* [https://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/blanche-phillips-howard-and-john-langley-howard-papers-7810 Blanche Phillips Howard and John Langley Howard papers, 1947-1981], from Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution"
