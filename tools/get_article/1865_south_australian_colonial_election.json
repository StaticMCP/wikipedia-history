All 36 seats in the House of Assembly (the lower house, whose members were elected at the 1862 election), and eight of the 18 seats in the Legislative Council (the upper house, which had two casual vacancies to be filled) were up for re-election.\nThe election used non-compulsory plurality block voting, in which electors voted for as many candidates as they wished. Members of the House of Assembly were elected to 18 multi-member districts consisting of two seats each. Members of the Legislative Council were elected in a single 18-member district. Suffrage extended to men (including Aboriginals) over 21 years of age (who owned property worth at least ₤50, for the Legislative Council), unless they were \"attainted or convicted of treason or felony\".\nNo parties or solid groupings would be formed until after the 1890 election, which resulted in frequent changes of the Premier. If the incumbent Premier lost sufficient support through a successful motion of no confidence at any time, he would tender his resignation to the Governor, which would result in another member being elected and sworn in by the Governor as the next Premier.\nResults\nHouse of Assembly\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-datatable\" style=\"text-align:right; margin-bottom:0\"\n|+House of Assembly (BV) – Turnout N/A (Non-CV)\n| colspan=\"8\" align=\"center\" |\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:200px\" |Party\n! colspan=\"3\" |Votes\n! colspan=\"2\" |Seats\n|-\n! style=\"width:70px;\" |Votes\n! style=\"width:40px;\" | %\n! style=\"width:40px;\" |Swing ()\n! style=\"width:40px;\" |Seats\n! style=\"width:40px;\" |Change\n|-\n|  |&nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\" |Independent\n| 13,339\n| 100.0\n| ±0.0\n| 36\n|  0\n|-\n! colspan=\"8\" |\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" |Total\n|13,339\n|100.0\n|–\n|36\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"8\" |\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:left;\" |Registered voters\n| 14,256\n|–\n|–\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align:left; background-color:#eaecf0\" |Source: ECSA\n|}\nLegislative Council\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-datatable\" style=\"text-align:right; margin-bottom:0\"\n|+Legislative Council (BV) – Turnout 30.0% (Non-CV)\n| colspan=\"8\" align=\"center\" |\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:200px\" |Party\n! colspan=\"3\" |Votes\n! colspan=\"2\" |Seats\n|-\n! style=\"width:70px;\" |Votes\n! style=\"width:40px;\" | %\n! style=\"width:40px;\" |Swing ()\n! style=\"width:40px;\" |Seats\n! style=\"width:40px;\" |Change\n|-\n|  |&nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\" |Independent\n| 27,818\n| 100.0\n| ±0.0\n| 18\n|  0\n|-\n! colspan=\"8\" |\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" |Total\n| 27,818\n|100.0\n|–\n|18\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"8\" |\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:left;\" |Informal votes\n| 188\n| 4.7\n| –2.6\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:left;\" |Turnout\n| 3,992\n| 30.0\n| +8.7\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:left;\" |Registered voters\n| 13,291\n|–\n|–\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align:left; background-color:#eaecf0\" |Source: ECSA\n|}\nSee also\n*Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1865–1868\n*Members of the South Australian Legislative Council, 1865–1869\nReferences\n*"
