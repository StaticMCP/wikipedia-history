Yizong was also known by his Tangut name Ningling Liangcha (寧令兩岔). \"Ningling\" (寧令, Tangut: ) was his Tangut title, which meant \"Grand Prince\", while \"Liangcha\" (兩岔) was his personal name.\nAfter the death of his father, Li Yuanhao (Emperor Jingzong) in 1048, Yizong assumed the throne at the age of one, but most of the power laid in the hands of his mother the Empress Dowager. In 1049, the Liao dynasty attacked the Western Xia and forced it to become a vassal state. In 1056, the Dowager was killed and Yizong's uncle, Mozang Epang, became the regent. In 1061, Yizong's uncle and cousin plotted against him, so he had them executed and assumed direct control of the Western Xia.\nYizong expanded the central government, adding many offices. He made the armies more efficient and improved his control over faraway states. Yizong began to attack the Northern Song dynasty and raided their villages. He also forced the Turpan leader to surrender. In later years, Yizong began to improve diplomatic relationships with the Northern Song and Liao dynasties. He died suddenly in 1068.\nFamily\nConsorts and issues:\n* Empress, of the  Mozang clan (皇后沒藏氏, d.1061), daughter of Mozang Epang\n* Empress Gongsu, of the Liang clan (恭肅皇后梁氏, d.1085), personal name Luoyao (落瑤)\n**Li Bingchang, Emperor Huizong (西夏惠宗 李秉常; 1060 – 1086), 1st son\n**Princess Li (李氏), 1st daughter\n***Married son of Dong Zhan (董毡), Dong Tongbi (董通比)\nReferences\nThe Ageless Chinese by Dun J.
