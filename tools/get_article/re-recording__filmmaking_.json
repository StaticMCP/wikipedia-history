An Audio re-recording is often called a re-recording of music. As sound elements are mixed and combined the process necessitates \"re-recording\" all of the audio elements, such as dialogue, music, sound effects, by the sound re-recording mixer(s) to achieve the desired result, which is the final soundtrack that the audience hears when the finished film is played. This may involve processes such as dubbing and automated dialogue replacement.\nIt is carried out by a re-recording mixer.\nReferences"
