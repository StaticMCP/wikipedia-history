There are 22 National Historic Sites designated in Kingston, including the Rideau Canal which extends from Ottawa and traverses  to Kingston.  The following sites are administered by Parks Canada: Bellevue House, Kingston Fortifications, the Rideau Canal and Shoal Tower (identified below by the beaver icon ).   Fort Henry and Fort Frontenac were both designated in 1923 and were the first sites designated in Kingston.\nNumerous National Historic Events also occurred in Kingston, and are identified at places associated with them, using the same style of federal plaque which marks National Historic Sites.
