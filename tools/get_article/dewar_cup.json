It is named after Sir Thomas Dewar as a tribute to his works promoting soccer in the U.S. in the early 1900s. Though the trophy is now on permanent display at the National Soccer Hall of Fame in Frisco, Texas, each winning club's name is still added to the base of the trophy each year.\nExternal links\n*[http://www.thecup.us/ TheCup.us - Unofficial website of the tournament]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110611075512/http://www.ussoccer.com/Tournaments/Lamar-Hunt-US-Open-Cup/2011-Lamar-Hunt-US-Open-Cup.aspx U.S. Soccer's Official Open Cup Website]\n*[http://thecup.us/the-open-cup-final-1914-present/ List of US Open Cup finals]"
