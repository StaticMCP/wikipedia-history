The horse also showed strength in other distances, as he had come in fifth in the 1998 Kikuka-shō. After retiring from racing, King Halo had a successful stud career.\nRacing career\n1997: Two-year old season\nKing Halo was sired by Dancing Brave, who was touted to be one of Europe's strongest horse in the 1980s, out of Goodbye Halo, who had won 7 GI races in the United States. According to King Halo's jockey, Yuichi Fukunaga, the horse was originally scheduled to be ridden by Yutaka Take. However, the schedule could not be kept as he decided to ride Genuine instead for the Mainichi Okan, which was held at a different race track. When Take called in to tell Masahiro Sakaguchi, King Halo's trainer, that he couldn't make the race, Fukunaga just so happened to be present, and was asked if he could ride the horse, to which he accepted. From the horse's debut race, Fukunaga, who was only in his second year as a jockey at the time, would ride King Halo for all of his three year old races except for one.\nAfter winning both his debut race and the Kigiku Sho, the horse moved on to the Tokyo Sports Hai Sansai Stakes, which he also won with a two-and-a-half-lengths lead against second place horse . This was the first group race victory for both the horse and jockey. The horse would become the favored at the Radio Tampa Hai Sansai Stakes, but finished second after Lord Ax passed him on the final stretch.\n1998: Three-year old season\nKing Halo started the season with the Yayoi Sho, which was a trial race for the Satsuki Sho. The horse was the most favored here as well, but couldn't catch runner Seiun Sky or Kisaragi Sho winner Special Week, finishing third with a four-length gap behind the two. At the Satsuki Sho, King Halo ran in front of Special Week and tried to catch up on Seiun Sky but was unable to catch up, finishing at second place. At the following Tōkyō Yūshun, King Halo took the lead and ran, but as the race became the second fastest pace at the time, the horse lost momentum at the final stretch, finishing at an unimpressive 14th place.\nIn autumn, the horse was briefly ridden by Yukio Okabe for the Kobe Shimbun Hai, where the horse went neck-and-neck with Bold Emperor but finished 3rd. Later at the Kyoto Shimbun Hai, the horse pressured Special Week but lost to him by a neck. Later, he did not perform well at the long-distance races, with him finishing 5th at the Kikuka Sho and 6th at the Arima Kinen.\n1999: Four-year old season\nKing Halo won two group races in a row in the 1999 season, the Tokyo Shimbun Hai and Nakayama Kinen, with Yoshitomi Shibata as his new jockey. It was hoped that the horse would become the face of the mile races after Taiki Shuttle retired, but failed to do so as he finished 11th at the Yasuda Kinen and 8th at Takarazuka Kinen. Norihiro Yokoyama rode King Halo for the Mainichi Okan but finished 5th, and the horse returned to Shibata for the Autumn Tenno Sho but finished 7th, leading to the horse to return to Fukunaga for the Mile Championship. In anticipation for the race, Fukunaga shaved his head to show commitment. However, while they were able to pass Take's Black Hawk, he was unable to beat . Fukunaga continued to ride King Halo for the following Sprinters Stakes, but finished third behind Black Hawk and Agnes World.\n2000: Five-year old season\nKing Halo's first race of the season was the February Stakes. He was the most favored given his pedigree and hopes for paving a new path. However, the horse was in post position 1, which meant that the horse would have sand all over him, leading to the horse to not go forward, leading to the horse to finish at 13th place. Sakaguchi was met with criticism over this, but his desire to make the horse a GI horse was unwavering. For the next Takamatsunomiya Kinen, the horse returned to Shibata, who won the race from the outside passing the likes of Agnes World and Black Hawk at the very last moment. Sakaguchi had cried in front of the camera upon the victory. In a twist of irony, King Halo's original jockey, Fukunaga, was riding the second-place horse, .\nAfter the Takamatsunomiya Kinen, the horse came in third at the Yasuda Kinen, the highest for any Japanese horse of that race, with Fukunaga back as his jockey. In autumn, Shibata once again rode King Halo, but did not make an impressive showing with him finishing 7th on both the Sprinters Stakes and the Mile Championship. However, drove itself in to fourth place at his final race, the Arima Kinen.\nWhile King Halo was only able to win a sprint race when looking at his GI race, the horse was able to show mixed results for mile race, medium race, and stayer races. The horse, whose track records can not be described simply by discussing the horse's distance aptitude.\nPost-retirement\nKing Halo entered stud in 2001 at the . With the horse's pedigree and service fee of around 1,000,000 JPY, the horse covered over a hundred mares per year; leading to the horse entering 5th place in the First Season Sire Ranking of 2004. One of the horse's first year crop, Nishino Dokomademo, won an open race, before finishing second at the Aoba Sho and going on to finish 6th at the Japanese Derby. Later on, Go Go Kirishima won the 2006 Shinzan Kinen, marking the first time a King Halo crop won a group race. Later on that same year,  won the Yushun Himba, becoming the first King Halo crop to win a GI race. The horse then went on to win the Shūka Sho undefeated, and went on to finish first the Queen Elizabeth II Cup before being dropped to 12th due to interference. In 2009 Laurel Guerreiro won the Takamatsunomiya Kinen, the same race his sire won nine years prior.\nWith the horse running in various distances, King Halo has sired various types of horses. Similarly, the horses King Halo sired was stronger in the winter season and weaker in the summer season. On top of that, many of his sires run with his neck high. King Halo's service fee went up as his crops won races, with the service fee for 2007 going up to 3,500,000JPY after Kawakami Princess (among others) won numerous races.\nThe 12th race held at Chukyo Racecourse on March 28, 2010, which was designated as a JRA Premium Race, King Halo earned the most votes, and as such was given the sub-name \"King Halo Memorial\".\nOn March 19, 2019, King Halo died due to old age at the Yushun Stallion Station (Niikappu, Hokkaido). Five days later, Yuichi Fukunaga won the 49th Takamatsunomiya Kinen with , a victory which Fukunaga dedicated to his former partner.\nRacing statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\"
