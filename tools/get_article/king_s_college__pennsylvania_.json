It is run by the Congregation of Holy Cross and is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. It is located within the Diocese of Scranton.\nHistory\nKing's College was founded in 1946 by Congregation of Holy Cross priests and brothers from the University of Notre Dame. The original mission of the college was to educate the sons of local miners and mill workers who lived in the Northeastern Pennsylvania region. The college's Administration Building indicates the links to the coal mining industry: Built in 1913, it was designed by Daniel Burnham of Chicago to serve as the headquarters of the Lehigh Valley Coal Company.\nThe institution's chapel, The Chapel of Christ the King, is located on West North Street.  It features a 4,200-pound anthracite altar, highlighting the relationship between the coal industry and the institution. It was created for King's in 1954 by renowned African-American sculptor and Wilkes-Barre resident, C. Edgar Patience.\nIn June 1972, massive flooding occurred in downtown Wilkes-Barre. Rains from Tropical Storm Agnes caused the neighboring Susquehanna River to overflow and flood most of the campus.\nPresidents\n{| class=wikitable\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n! !!President!!Term\n|-\n|1||James W.
