In Chilean historiography, where the event is often called the Disaster of Curalaba (), the battle marks the end of the conquest (la conquista) period in Chile's history, although the fast Spanish expansion in the south had already been halted in the 1550s. The battle led to a general Mapuche uprising that resulted in Destruction of the Seven Cities. This severe crisis reshaped Colonial Chile and forced the Spanish to reassess their mode of warfare.\nHistory\nOn December 21, 1598, Governor Martín García Oñez de Loyola traveled to Purén at the head of 50 soldiers and companions. At the end of the second day, they camped overnight in Curalaba, failing to take protective measures. The Mapuche were aware of their presence and Pelantaru and his lieutenants Anganamón and Guaiquimilla, leading three hundred men on horseback, shadowed the group's movements and mounted a surprise night raid. Taken by surprise, the governor and almost all of his party were killed.\nThis event was called the Disaster of Curalaba by the Spaniards. It not only involved the death of the Spanish governor, but the news rapidly spread among the Mapuche and triggered a general revolt, long-prepared by the toqui Paillamachu, that destroyed Spanish camps and towns south of the Bío-Bío River over the next few years.\nSee also\n* List of battles won by Indigenous peoples of the Americas\nReferences\nSources\n* Vicente Carvallo y Goyeneche, [http://www.memoriachilena.cl/temas/index.asp?id_ut=descripcionhistorico-geograficadelreinodechile Descripcion Histórico Geografía del Reino de Chile (Description Historical Geography of the Kingdom of Chile), PDF E Libros from Memoria Chilena] (History of Chile 1542–1788)\n* [http://www.memoriachilena.cl/temas/documento_detalle.asp?id=MC0008928 Tomo I History 1542–1626, Tomo 8 de Colección de historiadores de Chile y de documentos relativos a la historia nacional.
