Construction began in 1986, with John Laing as the main contractor. The school had a non-conventional design designed to maximise heat efficiency, with a central atrium illuminated by a barrel vault.\nThe school opened  1988. In 1999 the school was closed due to poor performance. It was reopened and renamed Kingswood High School, receiving funding under the government's Fresh Start programme to specialise as an Arts College.\nIn 2011 Hull City Council decided to demolish the school, and rebuild it with better facilities as part of the Building Schools for the Future programme. This programme saw 17 new schools built in Hull, including Kingswood Academy, at a cost of £123&nbsp;million.\nConstruction of the new 1,350 pupil capacity school began in April 2011, with a stated construction cost of around £25 million. The school was designed by Allford Hall Monaghan Morris, and built by the \"Esteem Consortium\" with Morgan Sindall as the main construction contractor. Initially planned to open in September 2012, opening was delayed to January 2013. On completion of the new building the school changed its name to Kingswood Academy. The new school building opened in January 2013.\nWhen the Academy opened as an Academies Enterprise Trust academy, free school uniforms were distributed in order to improve the image of the academy and its pupils in the local community.\nIn 2009 1,067 pupils were enrolled at the school; in 2012 the number had dropped to 797 students.\nDale Jackson replaced Bob Dore as principal in 2015. As of 2016 the academy had 588 pupils.\nSee also\n*Thomas Perronet Thompson, Hull-born parliamentarian\n*Kingswood, Kingston upon Hull, housing estate\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n*\n*, School website\n*, official construction images"
