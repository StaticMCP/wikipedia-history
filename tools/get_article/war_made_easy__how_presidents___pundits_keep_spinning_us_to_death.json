The film is produced by Alper and narrated by Sean Penn. It premiered in New York City on May 14, 2007, before a limited release on August 24, 2007.\nSynopsis\nThe film attempts to expose how the American government over 50 years has tried to strum up war effort using the media as a tool. \"War Made Easy gives special attention to parallels between the Vietnam war and the war in Iraq.\"\nReception\nCritical response\nJeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times stated, \"Unsubtle, condensed and bullet-point simple, War Made Easy avoids fancy visuals for a uniformly drab and dispiriting aesthetic. Sporadically narrated by Sean Penn (evincing all the personality of a potato), the movie is cinematically inert if ultimately persuasive.\" V.A. Musetto of the New York Post criticized the film as \"conventional and one-sided\". Aaron Hillis wrote for The Village Voice that the film is \"sobering, straightforward, and a bit drab, but... it's also an entirely nonpartisan endeavor\". Variety critic Dennis Harvey credited \"Solomon's astute onscreen analysis\" for driving the film.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
