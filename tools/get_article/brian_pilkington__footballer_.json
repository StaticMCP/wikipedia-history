He won one England cap, in place of the injured Tom Finney, whilst at Burnley, on 2 October 1954 in a 2–0 victory over Northern Ireland. He was also capped twice for England B, scoring once.\nPost-football career\nHe continued to live in Leyland and became a successful businessman and magistrate. He was married to Maureen, with whom he had a son, Tim.\nIn 2018 the Lancashire Football Association honoured him by naming a stand after him at their headquarters in Leyland.\nDeath\nPilkington died in a care home in Adlington on 7 February 2020 aged 86 after a long battle with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.\nHonours\nBurnley\n* Football League First Division champions: 1959–60\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
