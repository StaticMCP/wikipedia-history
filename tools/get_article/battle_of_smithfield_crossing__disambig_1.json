However, a counterattack from Ricketts' infantry division stopped the Confederate advance. Rebel troops were never ordered to attempt another advance, and ultimately the results were inconclusive. It was the last engagement of the war to take place in West Virginia.\nPreservation\nThe battle ranks in the top 3 percent of the more than 16,000 recorded armed encounters in the Civil War.
