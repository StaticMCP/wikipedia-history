He was the first formally trained architect operating in the state.\nHe was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and studied architecture there.  During the American Civil War he served in the quartermaster's department, in West Virginia.  After the war he practiced architecture in West Virginia. He moved to Boise, Idaho in 1888.\nAccording to the National Register nomination about one of his works, \"Research has not revealed much information about King, and few of his buildings remain.\"  Photos of some of his works show \"that he worked in the prevailing eclectic idiom style: the C.W. Moore house is a flamboyant Chateauesque residence, and the [[Boise City National Bank Building|[Boise City National] bank building]] is Richardsonian Romanesque; the [Washington County] courthouse had a Georgian Revival cupola, a projecting pavilion reminiscent of Federal architecture and round Romanesque arches.\"\nSeveral of his works are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).\nWorks include:\n*Bishops House (1889), moved to its present location in 1977.\n*Benjamin Watlington House (1890), Queen Anne-style, NRHP-listed\n*Washington County's courthouse (1890), demolished 1938.\n*Boise City National Bank Building (1891–92), aka 801 Building, Boise.
