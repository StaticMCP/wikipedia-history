It soft launched in select countries on March 10, 2016 and globally released on May 4, 2017.\nGameplay\nBattle Bay features matches of 2 teams with 5 players each attempting to destroy the other team or meet an alternative win condition. Before battles, players can individualize their ships almost completely by choosing one of 9 ship bodies and filling the ship's \"slots\" with weapons or other items of their choice. Each ship body has a unique pattern of slots, meaning it can hold more or less of a certain item type. Players can upgrade their weapons and ships using the game's currencies. Players can also fleet up together, putting them into the same team, and form into guilds.\nReception\nMetacritic gave the game 88/100. Pocket Gamer gave the game 4.5/5 Stars, noting it is an \"incredibly well constructed game\". Gamezebo also gave the game 4.5/5 Stars, noting they especially liked the waves as a feature.\n}}\nExternal links\n*\nReferences"
