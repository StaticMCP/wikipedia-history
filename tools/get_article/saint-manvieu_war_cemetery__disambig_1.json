The graveyard contains  1,627 Commonwealth war graves and 555 German war graves. The cemetery is maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.\nHistory\nA large proportion of the soldiers buried here are from the battles that took place between Tilly-sur-Seulles and Caen from mid-June to late-July 1944. Key engagements at this time were Operations Epsom and Jupiter. The cemetery received its first interments in mid-June 1944.\nLocation\nThe cemetery is 10&nbsp;km west of Caen, on the D.9 (Rue de la Guinguette).\nSee also\n* American Battle Monuments Commission\n* UK National Inventory of War Memorials\n* German War Graves Commission\n* List of military cemeteries in Normandy\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Shilleto, Carl, and Tolhurst, Mike (2008). “A Traveler’s Guide to D-Day and the Battle of Normandy”.
