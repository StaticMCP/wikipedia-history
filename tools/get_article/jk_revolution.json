It was released on 7 February 2008 through City Records. The tracks on the album were produced by Marko Peruničić and Nebojša Arežina from Atelje Trag, whilst the lyrics were written by Marina Tucaković with the assistance from Ljiljana Jorgovanović.\nRevolution was sold in 250,000 compact discs and 30,000 cassette tapes.\nBackground\nIn January 2008, the album was announced with the release of the music video for \"Tihi ubica\" on Pink, for which Karleuša faced public scrutiny because it was shot in the historical Karlovci Gymnasium. The school's professors, students and their parents launched a petition to ban the music video from airing on television because of its \"sexually explicit content\". Moreover, the provincial secretary for education and culture of Vojvodina, Zoltan Jegeš, publicly condemned the video and threatened the school with inspection. The studio session of \"Tihi ubica\" leaked to the public, which also provoked discussions about Karleuša's vocal abilities.\nTrack listing\nAll tracks are produced by Nebojša Arežina and Marko Peruničić.\nSample credits\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes.\nPerformers and musicians\n*Jelena Karleuša – vocals\n*Ceca Slavković - backing vocals\n*Aleksandra Radović – backing vocals\n*Marija Mihajlović – backing vocals\n*Miki Element - backing vocals\n*Dejan Momčilović – drums\n*Vladimir Čukić - bass\n*Zoran Petrović – guitar\n*Bane Kljajić – guitar\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Country\n! scope=\"col\"| Date\n! scope=\"col\"| Format\n! scope=\"col\"| Label\n|-\n| Serbia\n| February 7, 2008\n|\n| City Records\n|-\n|}\nExternal links\n*\nReferences"
