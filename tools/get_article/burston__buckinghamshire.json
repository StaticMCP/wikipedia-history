Its name derives from the Old English personal name Briddel + þorn (“thornbush”).\nThere used to be a village of Burston, which was recorded separately to Aston Abbots in the Domesday Book of 1086. The village was deserted after its residents were evicted in 1488, to clear arable farmland for sheep grazing. The desertion was later investigated by Thomas Wolsey, who found that after evicting at least 60 people, the landlord raised rents from  a year to £40.\nModern Burston consists of a few farms, including Burston Hill Farm, Lower Burston, and Burston Ridge Farm, but in the valley below earthworks of the old settlement remain and are a scheduled monument.\nSee also\n* Enclosure, the removal of common rights that people had to farmlands and parish commons.\n* Fleet Marston and Littlecote, other villages near to Aylesbury that were deserted after enclosure.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://heritageportal.buckinghamshire.gov.uk/Monument/MBC3163 Monument record 0104000100 - Burston DMV], aerial photographs of the Burston village earthworks."
