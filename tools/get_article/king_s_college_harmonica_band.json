It consisted of only a few members initially. In the 60's, under the baton of Fung On, the band began to expand in scale and winning an enviable reputation by means of their marvelous performances.  At that time, KCHB consisted of over thirty members. Through their efforts, they had won numerous prizes in the Hong Kong Schools Music Festival during these years. Mr. Fung left the band in the 60s and the band's repute started to wane. Hui Yau Fong took the baton a few years later. He reorganized the band and enthusiastically nurtured the new generation intending to retrieve the band's glorious prospects.\nBetween 1981 and 1985, KCHB was ushering in a significant stage of its development. Under the baton of Ho Pak Cheong, Chan Kai Wah, Chan Shu Keung, Mok Chi Chiu, and Lau Chun Bong, the band had won championships in most of the categories in the successive Hong Kong Schools Music Festivals. Ho Pak Cheong was a remarkable figure in KCHB's development in the 80s who assumed the office of conductor-in-chief in 1988. His contributions had given rise to their outstanding achievements during his time.\nHo Pak Cheong departed from the stage in the 90s and the baton went to a King's College alumni Johnny Kuan. He was intending to nurture new blood with his zealous endeavors and pushing the band toward another pinnacle of its history. From 1989 to 1993, he had witnessed the claim of the title of champion five times in a row in the Concert Work of Harmonica Solo of the Hong Kong Schools Music Festival. In 1991, KCHB presented its 40th Anniversary Concert in Shouson Theatre of Hong Kong Arts Centre, which was their first public concert. The success and the subsequent acclaim of the concert were arousing the period of \"harmonica kick\" among professionals and amateurs alike.  Shortly after that, the ongoing development of KCHB was left in the hands of Fung Sui Tsan, the next chairman. The year 1996 saw the return of Mr. Kuan as the conductor. He presented in their 45th Anniversary celebration concert at the Drama Theatre of Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts. In 2001, KCHB held a concert at Hong Kong City Hall Concert Hall to celebrate the Diamond Anniversary of the King's College and the Golden Anniversary of the Harmonica Band.
