For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\n9 Edw. 7\nThe fourth session of the 28th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 16 February 1909 until 3 December 1909.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 9 Ed. 7 or 9 E. 7.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| or the Government of India Act 1909|public|4|25-05-1909|maintained=y|repealed=y|archived=y|An Act to amend the Indian Councils Acts, 1861 and 1892, and the Government of India Act, 1833.|note4=  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n-\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  in its application to French Citizens, as may be necessary to give effect to a Convention between His Majesty and the President of the French Republic.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  to Scotland.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  to the County of Cork.}}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n-\n|\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n}}\nLocal acts\nrelating to the Zetland Masonic Sick and Widows and Orphans Fund.|po1=Zetland Masonic Sick and Widows and Orphans Fund Order 1909|}}\n|  and the Hastings Harbour Act 1897 for the compulsory purchase of lands as extended by the Hastings Harbour Acts 1900 1903 and 1905 and also to extend the period limited by those Acts for the construction and completion of the harbour and works.}}\n|\n|\n|  to extend the time for the sale of surplus lands and for other purposes.}}\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  relating to Kirkwall Water.|po1=Kirkwall Water Order 1909|}}\n|  in the matter of a proposed drainage district in the parishes of Westbury Minsterly and Pontesbury in the county of Salop.|po1=Land Drainage (Shropshire) Order 1909|}}\n|  in the matter of a proposed drainage district in the parishes of Haxey and Owston in the county of Lincoln.|po1=Land Drainage (Lincolnshire) Order 1909|}}\n|\n|\n|\n|  among the securities which may be purchased for the sinking fund created under that Act and to make corresponding provisions regarding securities which may be purchased for the sinking funds created under the Eastern Bengal Railway Company Purchase Act 1884 the Scinde Punjaub and Delhi Railway Purchase Act 1886 the Great Indian Peninsula Railway Purchase Act 1900 and the Madras Railway Annuities Act 1908 respectively.}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  1904 and 1906 for construction of works and land purchases and for other purposes.}}\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  and for other purposes.}}\n|  to abandon the construction of certain works authorised by the Act of 1908 and for other purposes.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  relating to the classification of merchandise traffic and the schedule of maximum rates and charges applicable thereto of the Weston Clevedon and Portishead Light Railways Company.|po1=Railway Rates and Charges (Weston, Clevedon and Portisland Light Railways) Order 1909|}}\n|\n|\n|\n|  in the matter of a proposed drainage district in the parish of Owston in the county of Lincoln.|po1=Land Drainage (Lincoln) Order 1909|}}\n|  relating to Musselburgh Gas.|po1=Musselburgh Gas Order 1909|}}\n|  relating to Musselburgh Corporation.|po1=Musselburgh Corporation (Extension of Boundaries, &c.)
