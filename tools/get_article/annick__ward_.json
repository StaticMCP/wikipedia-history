Created in 2007, the ward elects four councillors using the single transferable vote electoral system. Originally a three-member ward, Annick was increased in size following a boundary review and has elected four councillors since the 2017 East Ayrshire Council election.\nSince the creation of the ward, Labour, the Scottish National Party (SNP) and the Conservatives have held seats with each topping the poll in at least one election.\nBoundaries\nThe ward was created following the Fourth Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements ahead of the 2007 Scottish local elections. As a result of the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, local elections in Scotland would use the single transferable vote electoral system from 2007 onwards so Annick was formed from an amalgamation of several previous first-past-the-post wards.\nIt contained most of the former Stewarton East and Dunlop and Kilmaurs and Stewarton South wards as well as all of the former Stewarton Central ward and initially elected three members. Annick includes the northernmost part of the council area between its borders with North Ayrshire and East Renfrewshire and takes in the towns of Stewarton, Kilmaurs and Dunlop. Following the Fifth Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements ahead of the 2017 Scottish local elections, the ward was expanded to elect four members. The towns of Fenwick, Moscow and Waterside – previously part of the Irvine Valley ward – to the east of the A77 were included in the new boundaries.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=4|John McGhee(Labour)\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|John MacKay(SNP)\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Rose-Ann Cunninghame(Conservative)\n|colspan=2; rowspan=2\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=1|Eòghann MacColl(SNP)\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Ellen Freel(Ind.)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=1|Gordon Jenkins(SNP)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|John McFadzean(Conservative)\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1|Stephen Canning(SNP)\n|}\nElection results\n2022 election\n2017 election\n2012 election\n2007 election\nNotes\nReferences"
