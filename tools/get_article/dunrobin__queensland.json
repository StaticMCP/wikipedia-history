In the , Dunrobin had a population of 14 people.\nOn 22 November 2019, the Queensland Government decided to amalgamate the localities in the Barcaldine Region, resulting in five expanded localities based on the larger towns: Alpha, Aramac, Barcaldine, Jericho and Muttaburra. Dunrobin was mostly incorporated into Jericho, except for the south-east corner which was incorporated into Alpha and the south-west corner which was incorporated into Aramac.\nGeography\nThe Great Dividing Range passes through the locality from north to south-east, creating a watershed. To the west of the range, the Alice River rises in the south-east of the locality and flows to the south (Garfield) while Clara Creek rises in the south and flows to the west (Upland), eventually becoming a tributary of the Thomson River. Both of these watercourses are within the Lake Eyre drainage basin. In contrast, Dunda Creek also rises in the south-east of the locality but to the east of range. Dunda Creek flows north through the locality exiting to the north-east (Laglan), eventually contributing to the Burdekin River in the North East Coast drainage basin.\nIn the south-east of the locality are two protected areas, the Cudmore National Park and the Cudmore Resources Reserve.\nApart from the protected areas, the principal land use is grazing on native vegetation.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Dunrobin. The nearest primary schools are in Aramac , Jericho  and Mistake Creek . The nearest secondary school is in Aramac but only offers secondary schooling to Year 10. For Years 11 and 12, the nearest schools are in Barcaldine  and Clermont . However, the long driving times on the poor roads in this area make it unlikely that children could feasibly attend any of these schools. Boarding schools and distance education would be the alternatives.\nReferences"
