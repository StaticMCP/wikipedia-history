Tilden High School, Abraham Lincoln High School, John Adams High School, Walton High School, Andrew Jackson High School, and Grover Cleveland High School were all built during the Great Depression from one set of blueprints, in order to save money. Bayside and Andrew Jackson HS were the final two schools to be completed. The design was based on Kirby Hall in Gretton, Northamptonshire, England. The schools were designed as small campuses to provide a \"somewhat collegiate atmosphere\". The design of Bayside High School and the other schools, created by architect Walter C. Martin, was considered to be \"a modern adaptation of the Adams, Lincoln, and Tilden High Schools\", which had all been completed by 1929. Bayside High School was also the first school building in the city to be constructed using Federal funds, built by the Public Works Administration from 1934 to 1936 at the cost of $2.5&nbsp;million (equivalent to $&nbsp;million in ).\nBayside opened its doors on March 16, 1936, taking in 2,300 students who had previously attended Flushing High School.\nIn 1978 the Bayside High School music program, then under department chairman Sidney Lovett and teacher John Benza, was among the first secondary schools in the nation to purchase and teach music synthesis on a synthesizer, the Roland System 100.\nNotable alumni\n* Adrienne Adams  (born 1960), Speaker of the New York City Council, New York City Councilwoman from the 28th district\n* Eric Adams (born 1960), Mayor of New York City and former borough President of Brooklyn\n* Peggy Adler (born 1942, class of 1959), author and illustrator of children's books; investigative researcher\n* Ellen Baker (born 1953, class of 1970), astronaut\n* Jordan Belfort (born 1962), former investment banker whose life was the basis the film The Wolf of Wall Street\n* Action Bronson (born 1983), rapper\n* Mic Geronimo (born 1973), rapper and former reality star\n* Glenn Consor, sports broadcaster, Washington Wizards broadcasts, and former NCAA and pro basketball player\n* Chy Davidson (born 1959), former professional football player\n* Margaret Oakley Dayhoff (1925–1983), chemist, valedictorian, class of 1942\n* Steve Englebright (born 1946, class of 1964), paleontologist, politician—member of the New York State Assembly\n* Jason Eskenazi (born 1960), photographer\n* Lovari, musician and actor\n* Mae Faggs (1932–2000), track-and-field athlete who was a gold medalist in the Women's 4 × 100 meters relay at the 1952 Summer Olympics\n* Heather Foster (born 1966), Jamaican American professional bodybuilder\n* Mohammad Salman Hamdani (1977-2001), lauded for heroism on 9/11\n* Bobby Hammond (born 1952, class of 1971), Educator/doctoral candidate, Former National Football League player & coach\n* Ronnie Harmon (born 1964), professional football player\n* Scott Ian (born 1963, class of 1981), musician, best known as the rhythm guitarist for the heavy metal band Anthrax\n* Jipsta (born 1974 as John Patrick \"JP\" Masterson, class of 1992; valedictorian), rapper who has appeared six times on the Billboard Dance chart\n* Daymond John (born 1969), founder, president, and CEO of FUBU; investor on the ABC reality television series Shark Tank\n* Matthew Kaye (born 1974), former World Wrestling Entertainment wrestler/announcer, currently working for Lucha Underground as an announcer.\n* Carolyn Konheim (1938-2019), environmental activist and consultant\n* Brian Lehrer (born 1952), host of WNYC's The Brian Lehrer Show, a local call in radio show.\n* Dan Lilker (born 1964), heavy metal musician, bassist for Nuclear Assault, Brutal Truth and founding member of Anthrax\n* Olivia Longott (born 1981), R&B Singer/rapper, Class of 1998, currently on the VH1 show Love & Hip Hop\n* David Nolan (born 1946), historian and author of Fifty Feet in Paradise and The Houses of St. Augustine\n* John Paulson (born 1955), founder and president of Paulson & Co., a New York-based hedge fund\n* Andrea Peyser (born 1959), columnist for the New York Post\n* Vincent Rey (born 1987), professional football player\n* Steven J.
