It is run by the Queensland Rugby League (QRL)  and is contested by fifteen teams, thirteen of which are based in Queensland, with one based in New South Wales and one in Central Province, Papua New Guinea.\nThe competition is the present-day embodiment of Queensland's top-level club competition. It replaced the Winfield State League in 1996 and accompanied the Brisbane Rugby League, before becoming the premier competition in 1998, following the disbanding of the Brisbane Rugby League.\nHistory\nOrigin and establishment\nSince its inaugural season in 1922, the Brisbane Rugby League was the premier competition in the state of Queensland. Like its counterpart, the Sydney Rugby Football League, the Brisbane Rugby League was thriving, boasting big crowds and large, loyal supporter bases with their respective clubs. The clubs were constant, with new teams rarely entering the competition. However, in 1956, when poker machines (\"pokies\") were introduced in New South Wales but not in Queensland, Sydney's clubs were able to recruit the best players from Brisbane, Rugby Union and overseas. Within the space of several years, the Sydney Rugby League had come to dominate the code within Australia.\nIn the 1980s, the NSWRFL began to further expand and supersede the Brisbane competition in popularity and media coverage. In 1982, the first clubs based outside of Sydney, the Canberra Raiders and Illawarra Steelers, were admitted. In 1988, two Queensland-based sides, the Brisbane Broncos and Gold Coast Giants, along with the Newcastle Knights, another team from regional New South Wales, were formed and gained entry into the competition. The Broncos would sign Brisbane Rugby League stars like Wally Lewis, Gene Miles and Allan Langer. In the space of one season, media coverage and match attendance for the Brisbane Rugby League dropped significantly.\n1996–1997: The beginning\nIn 1996, the Queensland Cup was formed, replacing the Winfield State League, as new federal government laws banned cigarette companies from sponsoring sport. Originally branded the Channel Nine Cup, the 15 round regular season competition featured sixteen teams, fifteen from Queensland and one from Papua New Guinea. The Toowoomba Clydesdales were crowned the inaugural premiers, defeating the Redcliffe Dolphins in the Grand Final. In 1997, three teams withdrew from the competition and the Burleigh Bears joined, becoming the first Gold Coast-based side.\n1998–2002: Premier competition\nIn 1998, the competition became the top level of rugby league in the state, following the end of the Brisbane Rugby League. Channel Nine also ended their sponsorship for the 1998 season, with competition going under name, the Queensland Cup. A sixteen-team competition returned in 1998, with the Bundaberg Grizzlies rejoining and the Gold Coast Vikings being formed.\nIn 1999, the Grizzlies and Vikings both left the competition, as well as inaugural club Brisbane Brothers and the Townsville Stingers, who played just one season.\nIn 2000, Bundaberg Rum began a two-year sponsorship of the competition and it was known as the Bundy Gold Cup. The 2000 season was also the first in which all twelve teams remained from the season prior. It would not last long though, as the Cairns Cyclones folded after the 2000 season, leaving no north Queensland representation in the competition. In 2002, the North Queensland Young Guns, a Townsville-based North Queensland Cowboys feeder club, were admitted into the competition. At the end of the 2002 season, the Logan Scorpions, an inaugural club, left the competition.\n2003–2006: Interstate expansion\nIn 2003, the Tweed Seagulls joined the competition, becoming the first New South Wales-based side. The club had originally applied for the 2002 season but were unsuccessful. However, following a merger of the Logan Scorpions and Souths Magpies to form the Souths Logan Magpies, a spot was opened up and Tweed were admitted. Another inaugural club would leave the competition in 2004, with the Wests Panthers exiting, and Brothers-Valleys, a merger of Past Brothers and the Fortitude Valley Diehards, joining for a single season.\nIn 2005, the competition became known as the Queensland Wizard Cup, after Wizard Home Loans became the major sponsor.\n2007: Loss of the Clydesdales\nAlthough the QRL had anticipated that the same teams from 2006 would participate in the 2007 competition, it was announced on 5 December 2006 that inaugural club, the Toowoomba Clydesdales, who were the reigning minor premiers, would be withdrawing from the competition for financial reasons. Brisbane Broncos chairman Bruno Cullen said that \"It didn't make sense to have this club up there running at what was looking like a $250,000 loss for the year.\" The following day it was announced that the Aspley Broncos would be replacing the Clydesdales, and acting as the Brisbane Broncos feeder club. The Aspley Broncos would play just a single season in the competition.\nThe 2007 season marked the first time a team based outside of Queensland would win the competition, with the Tweed Seagulls defeating the Redcliffe Dolphins in the Grand Final.\n2008–2013: Further expansion\n2008 saw the Queensland Cup once again have teams based in the northern cities of Cairns and Mackay after absences of seven and twelve years, respectively. These new teams replaced Aspley and North Queensland as part of the rationalisation of rugby league below the NRL level caused by the introduction of the NRL under 20s competition.\nIn 2009, the Sunshine Coast Falcons rejoined the competition after thirteen-year absence, after signing a partnership with the Manly Sea Eagles to develop rugby league on the Sunshine Coast.[http://www.thedaily.com.au/news/2007/nov/09/coast-lands-footy-coup/ Manly to invest $1m in Coast league | thedaily.com.au]  The side played as the Sea Eagles and won the premiership in their first year.\nIn 2010,  Super was announced as the new major sponsor, with the competition becoming known as the Intrust Super Cup. From 2009 to 2013, the competition featured the same twelve teams for five straight seasons.\n2014–2021: Papua New Guinea and Townsville return\nIn 2014, the PNG Hunters entered the competition, becoming the first Papua New Guinea based side in the competition since the Port Moresby Vipers in 1997. In their inaugural season, the side was based out of the East New Britain town of Kokopo. On 10 September 2014, QRL chairman Peter Betros announced that the Brothers Townsville-led Townsville Blackhawks bid had been successful and the side would compete in the 2015 season.\nOn 5 October 2014, the Northern Pride became the first Queensland Cup side to win the NRL State Championship, defeating the heavily favoured Penrith Panthers New South Wales Cup side in the inaugural final.\nIn 2017, the Hunters won their first Queensland Cup premiership, defeating the Sunshine Coast Falcons in the Grand Final and becoming the first team outside of Australia, and the second from outside of Queensland to win the competition.\nOn 27 March 2020, after round one of the season was completed, the 2020 Intrust Super Cup competition was suspended, and subsequently cancelled for the first time in its history due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with no premiers being crowned. In September 2020, the Easts Tigers were renamed as the Brisbane Tigers for the 2021 season onward. The Tigers had played under the name of Easts or Eastern Suburbs since the formation of the Queensland Cup in 1996.\n2022–present: Hostplus Cup and return of the Clydesdales\nIn November 2021, Hostplus became the naming rights sponsor of the competition for the 2022 season, replacing Intrust Super after the two companies had merged.\nOn July 17, the QRL announced that the Western Clydesdales, previously called the Toowoomba Clydesdales would (re)enter the competition for the 2023 season, becoming the competition's fifteenth team.\nQueensland Cup teams\nThe Queensland Cup consists of 15 teams, 13 from Queensland, and 1 each from National Capital District of Papua New Guinea and New South Wales, and operates on a single group system, with no divisions or conferences and no relegation and promotion from other leagues.\nA number of clubs in the Queensland Cup have an affiliation with a team in the Australian national competition, the National Rugby League.\nCurrent teams\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 105%\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\" style=\"background:maroon;

Clubs generally use this time to organise trial matches to test playing combinations. Usually, Queensland Cup teams will play each other in trials, while some face National Rugby League (NRL) sides. For example, in 2018, the Brisbane Broncos played trial matches against the Central Queensland Capras and PNG Hunters.\nRegular season\nThe Queensland Cup regular season usually begins in early March and runs until late August. A round of regular season games is played every weekend for twenty-four weeks. In most rounds, matches are played on Saturday nights/afternoons and Sunday afternoons. Each team receives one bye during the regular season.\nThe regular season also features a number of themed rounds, where proceeds from the games go to various charities. In 2018, these rounds included ANZAC Round, Indigenous Round, Men of League Round, Women in League Round, \"Turn to Me\" Round and the annual Country Week.\nCountry Week\n}}\nThe Queensland Cup has the largest regional footprint of any professional sporting code in Queensland, hosting regular season and trial matches over a large geographical footprint.\nIn Round 20, 2011 the Souths Logan Magpies game against the Northern Pride was relocated from the Magpies home ground in Brisbane to Yusia Ginau Oval, Bamaga on Cape York. The game attracted 2000 spectators, and was so successful that the following year QRL in partnership with the Queensland Government introduced the 'Country Week' concept and took matches to regional Queensland, country towns and cities, to engage fans at a grassroots level. This round usually takes place in July.\nLocations which have hosted Country Week games include:\n* 2012: Blackwater, Kilcoy, Moranbah, Mount Isa\n* 2013: Roma, Toowoomba, Whitsundays, Woodford, Yarrabah\n* 2014: Emerald, Longreach, Mareeba, Moranbah, Kingaroy, Kokopo (East New Britain Province)\n* 2015: Blackall, Bundaberg, Charters Towers, Dalby, Innisfail, Stanthorpe\n* 2016: Barcaldine, Charleville, Gympie, Moranbah, Mount Isa, Ravenshoe\n* 2017: Bamaga, Clermont, Julia Creek, Mundubbera, Winton, St George\n* 2018: Bowen, Cooktown, Goondiwindi, Hughenden, Lae (M.

The system consists of a number of games between the top eight teams over four weeks in September, until only two teams remain. These two teams then contest the Grand Final, which is usually played in late September. Over the years, the Queensland Cup has used a number of different finals series systems, usually involving five to six  and now eight teams. In 2019, the current eight team final series system will be adopted.\nGrand Final\nThe Queensland Cup Grand Final, which determines the season's premiers, is one of the state's major sporting events. It is usually contested at Suncorp Stadium, having been held there annually since 2014, although other venues have been used, such as Dolphin Stadium, North Ipswich Reserve and Sunshine Coast Stadium.\nThe Grand Final had traditionally been played on Saturday afternoons, until moving to Sunday afternoons beginning in 2010.\nSince 2007, the player judged to be the man-of-the-match is awarded the prestigious Duncan Hall Medal.\nPremiership winners\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;

The match originally followed the NRL Under-20s Grand Final from 2014 to 2017, and in 2018 followed the NRL Women's Grand Final.\nIn 2019 however, the NRL State Championship was the first of three grand finals played on the day, preceding both the NRL Women's Grand Final and NRL Grand Final, with the exception of 2020 and 2021 when the NRL State Championship match was cancelled due to COVID-19. The Northern Pride and Ipswich Jets became the first two QRL teams to win the State Championship with the next six championships won by the NSWRL premiers. The Norths Devils would break the streak, winning the 2024 match against the Newtown Jets.\nChampions: Queensland Cup\n*Northern Pride (2014)\n*Ipswich Jets (2015)\n*Norths Devils (2024)\nNRL State Championship winners\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#003D01;\"\n!rowspan=2 style=\"color:#F9B41B;\"|NRLSeason\n!colspan=4 style=\"color:#F9B41B;\"|NRL State Championship\n!rowspan=2 style=\"color:#F9B41B;\"|Player of the Match\n|- style=\"background:#F9B41B;\"\n!style=\"color:#003D01;\" \"width:02%;\" |Winners\n!style=\"color:#003D01;\" \"width:08%;\" |Score\n!style=\"color:#003D01;\" \"width:02%;\" |Runners-up\n!style=\"color:#003D01;\" \"width:08%;\" |Venue\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| align=center|2014\n| align=left| Northern Pride\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 32–28\n| align=left| Penrith Panthers\n| align=left| Stadium Australia\n| align=left|  Javid Bowen\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| align=center|2015\n| align=left| Ipswich Jets\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 26–12\n| align=left| Newcastle Knights\n| align=left| Stadium Australia\n| align=left| Matt Parcell\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| align=center|2016\n| align=left|  Illawarra Cutters\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 54–12\n| align=left| Burleigh Bears\n| align=left| Stadium Australia\n| align=left|  Drew Hutchison\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| align=center|2017\n| align=left|  Penrith Panthers\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 42–18\n| align=left| PNG Hunters\n| align=left| Stadium Australia\n| align=left|  Kaide Ellis\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| align=center|2018\n| align=left|  Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 42–18\n| align=left| Redcliffe Dolphins\n| align=left|Stadium Australia\n| align=left|  Josh Cleeland\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| align=center|2019\n| align=left|  Newtown Jets\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 20–16\n| align=left| Burleigh Bears\n| align=left|Stadium Australia\n| align=left| Toby Rudolf\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center\" | 2020\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left\" | Match was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Australia.\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center\" | 2021\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left\" | Match was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in New South Wales.\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center\" | 2022\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | Penrith Panthers\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 44–10\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | Norths Devils\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | Stadium Australia\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  J'maine Hopgood\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center\" | 2023\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | South Sydney Rabbitohs\n| style=\"text-align:center\" | 42–22\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | Brisbane Tigers\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | Stadium Australia\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  Tyrone Munro\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center\" | 2024\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | Norths Devils\n| style=\"text-align:center\" | 20–18\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | Newtown Jets\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | Stadium Australia\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  Oryn Keeley\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center\" | 2025\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  NZ Warriors\n| style=\"text-align:center\" | 50–20\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  Burleigh Bears\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | Stadium Australia\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  Tanah Boyd\n|}\nHonours\nAt the end of each season at the QRL presentation night, the Petero Civoniceva Medal is awarded to the Queensland Cup player voted as the best and fairest over the entire season. Formerly known as The Courier Mail Medal, in 2018, the medal was renamed after former Australian and Queensland representative Petero Civoniceva.  After each game, the referees award three votes to the best player, two votes to the second-best player, and one vote to the third-best player. Previous winners include Australia and Queensland representatives Greg Inglis and Daly Cherry-Evans.\nSince 2007, the man of the match in the Grand Final has been awarded the Duncan Hall Medal. The medal is named in honour of ARL Team of the Century member Duncan Hall, who played 24 games for Queensland and 22 games for Australia between 1948 and 1955. Past recipients include Tony Williams and Jake Granville, who would go onto win NRL premierships shortly after their Queensland Cup success.\n20th Year Anniversary Team\nOn 21 September 2015, the QRL announced their Queensland Cup 20th Year Anniversary team. The 17-man team was chosen by a selection panel consisting of Brad Tallon (Queensland Rugby League statistician), Steve Ricketts (rugby league journalist), David Wright (former ABC commentator) and Mike Higgison (rugby league historian).\nTo be eligible for selection, a player must've played a minimum of 75 games in the competition. Rick Stone, who coached the Burleigh Bears from 1997 to 2005 (winning two premierships), was named coach of the side, while longtime referee Tony Maksoud was included as referee of the team.\n{| border=1 style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\" cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 width=100%\n|- bgcolor=#C1D8FF\n!

Previously, the match of the round had been broadcast by Nine on Sunday afternoons and before that, on ABC Television on Saturday afternoons.
