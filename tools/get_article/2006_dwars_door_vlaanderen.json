The race started in Kortrijk and finished in Waregem. The race was won by Frederik Veuchelen.\nThe race was characterized by Tom Boonen who was training himself for the big (Flemish) monuments to come (RVV, E3, P-R, ...); according to many this was one of his best performances in a single-day race ever, even though he did not win. When asked afterwards why he was showing off his magnificent shape he replied: \"T'is Lente Schat\" [spring has begun], two weeks later he won RVV in his rainbow jersey.\nGeneral classification\n{|\n|Final general classification\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Rank\n! scope=\"col\" | Rider\n! scope=\"col\" | Time\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1\n|\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" |\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2\n|\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | + 2\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 3\n|\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | + 2\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 4\n|\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | + 2\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 5\n|\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | + 2\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 6\n|\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | + 2\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 7\n|\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | + 2\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 8\n|\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | + 2\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 9\n|\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | + 2\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 10\n|\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | + 2\"\n|}\n|}\nReferences"
