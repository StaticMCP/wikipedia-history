Bangash attacked the state of Bundelkhand in December 1728. Being too old to fight, as well as heavily outnumbered, Chhatrasal appealed to Baji Rao for assistance - under whose leadership the Maratha with 25,000 horsemen with the Bundela troops defeated the Muhammad khan Bangash.\nBackground\nIn Bundelkhand, Chhatrasal had rebelled against the Mughal Empire and established an independent kingdom. In December 1728, a Mughal force led by Muhammad Khan Bangash attacked him and besieged his fort and family. Although Chhatrasal repeatedly sought Baji Rao's assistance, he was busy in Malwa at the time. He compared his dire situation to that of Gajendra Moksha. In his letter to Baji Rao, Chhatrasal wrote the following words:\nBattle\nAfter marching to Jaitpur, Bajirao surrounded Muhammad Khan Bangash and cut off his supplies as well as communication lines to Delhi and Allahabad. Bangash launched a counterattack against Baji Rao, but could not pierce his defences. Qaim Khan, son of Muhammad Khan Bangash, learned of his father's predicament and approached with fresh troops. His army was attacked by Bajirao's forces, and he was defeated. Bangash then sought forgiveness and surrendered, signing an agreement and promise that he would never suppress the independence of Bundelkhand again.\nAftermath\nChhatrasal's position as ruler of Bundelkhand was restored. He gifted one-third of his state to the Peshwa and gave him his daughter from a concubine named Ruhani Bai, Mastani. Before Chhatrasal's death in December 1731, he ceded one-third of his territories to the Marathas.\nReferences"
