      "text": "# United States presidential visits to Southern Europe\n\nfeaturing the countries of Southern Europe (highlighted in dark green)]]\nThirteen United States presidents have made presidential visits to Southern Europe. Woodrow Wilson became the first incumbent president to visit a Southern European country in January 1919 in the aftermath of World War I. Visits occurring during the 1940s through 1980s were offshoots of American diplomatic interactions during World War II and then the Cold War.\nTo date, 34 visits have been made to Italy, 23 to Vatican City, 11 to Spain, eight to Portugal, four to Greece, three to Bosnia and Herzegovina, three to Malta, three to Slovenia, two to Croatia, two to Kosovo, one to Albania, and one to Macedonia (now known as North Macedonia). Three were also made to Yugoslavia prior to its breakup during the early 1990s. Of the present-day nations in (or partly within) the region, all but Cyprus, San Marino, Andorra, Montenegro, and Serbia have been visited by a sitting American president.\nTable of visits\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!President\n!Dates\n!nowrap|Country or territory\n!Locations\n!Key details\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Woodrow Wilson\n|\n|\n|Rome, Genoa, Milan, Turin\n|Met with King Victor Emmanuel III and Prime Minister Vittorio Orlando.\n|-\n|\n| Vatican\n|Apostolic Palace\n|Audience with Pope Benedict XV.\n|-\n|rowspan=3|Franklin D.

Ulysses S. Grant met with Pope Leo XIII in the Vatican in 1878, during a world tour after leaving the presidency.\nTheodore Roosevelt sought an audience with Pope Pius X in April 1910 while in Rome. The Pope agreed to see him, provided Roosevelt would not call on some Methodist missionaries in Rome. Roosevelt had no intention of meeting the missionaries, but he declined to submit to the pope's conditions and the interview did not take place.\nFormer presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton accompanied President George W. Bush to the funeral of Pope John Paul II in April 2005.\nSee also\n* Foreign policy of the United States\n* Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe\n* Catholic Church and politics in the United States\n* List of meetings between the pope and the president of the United States\nReferences"
