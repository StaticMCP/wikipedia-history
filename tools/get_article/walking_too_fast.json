It was released in 2010. It is a psychological story about relations between the secret police (StB) and the dissident movement, set in communist Czechoslovakia in the 1980s. The film was likened to the German film The Lives of Others.\nWalking Too Fast is described as a dark thriller with an unpredictable protagonist who becomes dangerous to all people around including himself. His way to reach the goal is self-destructive.\nPlot\nThe story revolves around Antonín Rusnák who is an StB agent. He feels rage towards the world. He feels sick and bored from his family and work. His psychological issues cause him breathing problems and his doctor advises him to breathe into a bag if he gets a fit.\nAntonín and his partner Martin surveil Tomáš and Pavel. They are both dissidents but Pavel is also collaborating with Antonín and Martin. Antonín finds out that Tomáš, who is married, has a lover, Klára. Antonín becomes interested in her. He secretly follows her and uses his authority to protect her. He beats up a guy who bothers her or prevents her boss from firing her because of her links to the dissidents. He also pushes Tomáš to leave the country to get rid of him. He beats him up during interrogations and reveals his affair to his family and Tomáš finally decides to leave Czechoslovakia.\nAntonín forces Pavel to arrange a meeting with Klára in exchange for seeing his file. Pavel then meets Antonín's partner Martin in order to reveal the agreement he made with Antonín. Martin states that Antonín is done at StB but doesn't know that Antonín is aware of their meeting and lures Martin to the woods where he attacks him and threatens him with a gun. Martin begs him for his life and Antonín handcuffs him to a tree.\nAntonín and Klára meet in Pavel's apartment. The meeting doesn't end well and Antonín gets a fit so he breathes into the bag which makes Klára realize that Antonín is the agent who terrorized Tomáš. He tells her that he followed her and she admits that she felt as if somebody was watching her for a long time. Antonín reveals his name and she says that he has to stop watching her.\nKlára leaves the apartment but writes a message for Pavel on the Wall - \"Svině\" (Swine). Klára goes Home and meets the ambulance that takes her pregnant Friend Darina to the Hospital. She gets on the ambulance but looks around if anybody watches her. The film ends with Antonín waking up at the lakeside. The audience can now hear his thoughts as he enters the lake and goes deeper and deeper. He thinks about who he was and hopes that Klára will remember his name. In the end he states \"It is beautiful here\" as he kills himself.\nCast\n* Ondřej Malý – Antonín Rusnák, a State Security agent\n* Martin Finger – Tomáš Sýkora, a dissident\n* Kristína Farkašová – Klára Kadlecová, Tomáš's lover\n* Luboš Veselý – Pavel Veselý, an important figure in the dissident movement and a close friend to Tomáš\n* Lukáš Latinák – Martin Husár, Antonín's partner\n* Barbora Milotová – Silvie Sýkorová – Tomáš's wife\n* Ivana Uhlířová – Darina, Klára's friend\n* Oldřich Kaiser – Janeček, Antonín and Martin's boss\n* Iva Pazderková – Miluška\n* Jana Janěková – Šimková\n* Monika Fingerová – Rusnák's wife\n* Jiří Štrébl – Martinec\n* Cyril Drozda – Doctor\n* Natálie Drabiščáková – Anna Řeháková\nProduction\nThe film was inspired by 1995's Casino.
