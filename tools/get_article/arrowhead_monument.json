Local Catawba community leaders also attended the unveiling. The monument was a familiar sight for travelers through Western North Carolina, as a tall, hand-carved arrowhead in front of the depot, signaling a stop in the historic town of Old Fort.\nThe Arrowhead Monument remains as of 2023. It is decorated for holidays including Christmas and the Fourth of July.\nReferences"
