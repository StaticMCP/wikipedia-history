In this election, the only candidates for President of Uruguay per party for the general election will be elected. In addition, the integration of the National Deliberative Body and the different Departmental Deliberative Bodies of the different parties, which have the function of nominating the candidate for president and vice president of each party, and the candidates for mayors for the municipal elections of 2020 are also elected.\nIn accordance with the transitory provisions of the Constitution, the primary electionsare held on the last Sunday of June of the electoral year, and those \"qualified to vote\"—all those over 18 years of age and registered in the Civic Registry and with a civic credential―can participate in the secret and non-compulsory suffrage.\nIn order to win the primary election and be proclaimed a presidential candidate, the pre-candidate must obtain an absolute majority of the party's valid votes. In the event that no pre-candidate obtains that majority, the winner will be the one that exceeds 40% of the votes and leads the second by no less than 10 percentage points. If none of these circumstances occur, the deliberative body elected in the election will nominate the party's candidate for president by an absolute majority of its members.\nThe participation of the parties in the elections is mandatory. In addition, each one had to obtain at least 500 votes to participate in the general elections.\nBroad Front\nThe Broad Front is the party of incumbent president Tabaré Vázquez, which was unable to seek reelection due to constitutional term limits, so it had to pick a new presidential nominee. This primary was also considered a generation change of the Broad Front, due to the lack of presence of historically dominant names such as Tabaré Vázquez, José Mujica and Danilo Astori.\nCandidates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
