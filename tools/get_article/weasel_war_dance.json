Naturalists speculate that weasels in the wild use the dance to confuse or disorient prey.\nIn domestic ferrets\nIn domestic ferrets the war dance usually follows play or the successful capture of a toy or a stolen object. The war dance is commonly held to mean that the ferret is thoroughly enjoying itself.\nThe behavior consists of a frenzied series of erratic leaps, often accompanied by an arched back and a frizzed-out tail. Ferrets are notoriously clumsy as they dance and will often collide with or fall over objects and furniture.\nThe war dance usually includes a clucking vocalization, known among domestic ferret owners as \"dooking\". It normally indicates happiness. Although the war dance may make a ferret appear frightened or angry, they are often just excited and are generally harmless to humans.\nIn the wild\n]]\nThe stoat (also known as the ermine or the short-tailed weasel) reputedly mesmerises prey such as rabbits by a \"dance\" (sometimes called the weasel war dance), though this behaviour could be linked to Skrjabingylus infections. In fact, all weasels, e.g., the least weasel, the European polecat, the steppe polecat, the black-footed ferret, etc., dance when they have caught or killed their prey in the wild.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211212/VdRXuyBOyow Ghostarchive] and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130430123543/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdRXuyBOyow Wayback Machine]:\n*"
