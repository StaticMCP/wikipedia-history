It is one of the oldest saree shops in the Chennai's commercial neighbourhood of T. Nagar.\nHistory\nNalli was established in T. Nagar in 1928 by Nalli Chinnasamy Chetti, a weaver who belonged to the Padmasali community. Chinnasamy Chetti was a famous weaver of Kanchipuram sarees who had been weaving silk sarees since 1900 and gifted a Kanchipuram saree, the Durbar Pet, as a souvenir to George V during his visit to India in 1911. In 1928, he moved to the then Madras and became one of the first to open a shop in the neighbourhood of T. Nagar which was founded in the early 1920s.  The shop initially functioned from a house until Nalli established his own showroom in 1935. Nalli Chinnasamy Chetti died in 1958 and was succeeded by his grandson Nalli Kuppusamy Chetti.\nNotes\nExternal links\n*\n*"
