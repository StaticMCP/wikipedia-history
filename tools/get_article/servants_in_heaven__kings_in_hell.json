It was released September 19, 2006 through Babygrande Records. The first single, \"Heavy Metal Kings\", featuring Ill Bill of La Coka Nostra, was released in early August through iTunes and a limited edition vinyl pressing. Additional guest appearances on the album are provided by Shara Worden of My Brightest Diamond, Sean Price, R.A. the Rugged Man, Block McCloud and Army of the Pharaohs members Chief Kamachi and Reef the Lost Cauze.\nOverview\nAs with previous Jedi Mind Tricks albums, many of the track titles appear to be lifted from previous songs by heavy metal groups.  For example, \"When All Light Dies\" was previously the title of a song by Trivium; \"Serenity in Murder\" is also the name of a Slayer track; \"Razorblade Salvation\" is also a song by Sinergy; and \"Black Winter Day\" is the name of a track by Amorphis. The album title, as well, could potentially be a reference to the Kreator track \"Servant in Heaven (King in Hell)\" from their Violent Revolution album. Much of the lyrics reference heavy metal also, i.e. \"I'm a Cannibal Corpse\" (When All Light Dies) and \"Calculate infinity with The Dillinger Escape Plan.\" (Serenity In Murder).\nServants in Heaven became the group's most commercially successful release, being their first album to break into the Billboard 200, and also landed in the top ten on the Independent Albums chart, and the top fifty on the Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart. The album was warmly received critically, especially when compared to their two previous efforts, Visions of Gandhi and Legacy of Blood, which both received mixed reviews. Allmusic gave the album a positive four star rating; writer Marisa Brown stated:\nallmusic ((( Servants in Heaven, Kings in Hell > Overview )))]}}\nAn exclusive version of the album was released at Trans World Entertainment chain stores. This version features three bonus tracks, a remixed version of \"Heavy Metal Kings\", performed with California hardcore band Terror, the D-Tension mixtape track \"Pretty Little Whores\", featuring OuterSpace, and \"Blitz Inc.\", featuring King Syze and Esoteric, as well as a bonus DVD, featuring the \"Heavy Metal Kings\" music video.[http://www.babygrande.com/news.jsp?id=106 Babygrande News]\nTrack listing\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!#\n!Title\n!Guests\n|-\n|1\n|\"Intro\"\n|\n|-\n|2\n|\"Put 'Em In The Grave\"\n|\n|-\n|3\n|\"Suicide\"\n|\n|-\n|4\n|\"Uncommon Valor: A Vietnam Story\"\n|R.A. the Rugged Man\n|-\n|5\n|\"A Blood Red Path\"\n|\n|-\n|6\n|\"When All Light Dies\"\n|Shara Worden\n|-\n|7\n|\"Serenity In Murder\"\n|\n|-\n|8\n|\"Pariah Demise (Interlude)\"\n|\n|-\n|9\n|\"Heavy Metal Kings\"\n|Ill Bill\n|-\n|10\n|\"Shadow Business\"\n|\n|-\n|11\n|\"Triumph & Agony (Interlude)\"\n|\n|-\n|12\n|\"Razorblade Salvation\"\n|Shara Worden\n|-\n|13\n|\"Outlive The War\"\n|Sean Price & Block McCloud\n|-\n|14\n|\"Gutta Music\"\n|Reef the Lost Cauze & Chief Kamachi\n|-\n|15\n|\"Temples of Ice (Interlude)\"\n|\n|-\n|16\n|\"Black Winter Day\"\n|\n|-\n|17\n|\"Heavy Metal Kings (Terror Remix)\" (produced by Scott Stallone)*\n|Ill Bill & Terror\n|-\n|18\n|\"Pretty Little Whores\" (produced by D-Tension)*\n|OuterSpace\n|-\n|19\n|\"Blitz Inc.\" (produced by 7L)*\n|King Syze & MC Esoteric\n|}\n* = Bonus tracks\nSamples\n'''Put 'Em In The Grave'''\n*\"Threat\" by Jay-Z\n*\"Twinz (Deep Cover '98)\" by Big Pun\n*\"Quiet Storm\" by Mobb Deep\nSuicide\n*\"1-800 Suicide\" by Gravediggaz\nSerenity In Murder\n*\"Made You Look (Remix)\" by Nas (Vocals by Jadakiss)\n*\"Still D.R.E.\" by Dr. Dre\n*\"Day One\" by D.I.T.C.
