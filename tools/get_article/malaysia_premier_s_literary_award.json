Since the 1990/1991season, the prize has been awarded only for works published as a book. This was motivated by the need to improve the quality criteria for the selection of works. This led to the fact that the number of entries accepted for the competition fell sharply.\nSince the season of 1996/1997 the prize has received the modern name.\nIn 2015/2016, 44 literary works were awarded this prize\nReferences"
