      "text": "# List of Star Wars sequel trilogy characters\n\nThis incomplete list contains only the major characters and storylines featured in the three films of the Star Wars sequel trilogy.\nBackground\nThe Star Wars sequel trilogy is the third trilogy of the main Star Wars franchise, an American space opera created by George Lucas. It is produced by Lucasfilm Ltd. and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. The trilogy consists of episodes VII through IX, chronologically following the prequel trilogy (Episodes I–III; 1999–2005) and the original trilogy (Episodes IV–VI; 1977–1983), serving as the final act of the \"Skywalker saga\".\nThe first installment, The Force Awakens, was released on December 18, 2015, after a 30-year hiatus between the original and sequel trilogies. It was directed by J. J. Abrams who  the screenplay with Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt. Original trilogy cast members including Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher reprised their roles,  alongside franchise newcomers Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, and Oscar Isaac. The second installment, The Last Jedi, was released on December 15, 2017, with Rian Johnson as screenwriter and director, and most of the cast returning. The final installment, The Rise of Skywalker, was released on December 20, 2019. It was directed by Abrams, who  it with Chris Terrio.\nThe trilogy follows the orphan Rey and the plight of the Resistance against the First Order, which has risen from the fallen Galactic Empire. Rey learns the ways of the Force under Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa, and confronts Kylo Ren—the son of Leia and Han Solo, nephew of Luke, and grandson of Anakin Skywalker—who has fallen to the dark side. The first two films received positive reviews from critics, while the third received mixed reviews. The trilogy grossed over $4.4&nbsp;billion at the box office worldwide, with each film surpassing $1 billion worldwide.\nSome reports indicate that, contrary to popular belief, some plot points across the trilogy were planned in advance. The idea of Luke Skywalker living on an island following his failure to stop the murder of his Jedi apprentices and then training an apprentice who would help him overcome his self-doubt was first pitched by George Lucas in 2013 during creative meetings between himself and Lucasfilm as part of story discussions for Episode VII (these ideas would later be used in The Last Jedi). Several plot points of The Rise of Skywalker were pitched in an early 2014 story meeting between Lucasfilm executives (including Dave Filoni, Pablo Hidalgo, Doug Chiang, John Knoll and Kiri Hart) after the plot of The Force Awakens had been finalized, including the notion of Leia as a mentor figure to Rey, Leia breaking through to her son Ben Solo (Kylo Ren) and the notion of Rey as \"the Skywalker\" of the trilogy by metaphor rather than blood connection. The return of Emperor Palpatine in Episode IX was planned as far back as the earliest development phase of the trilogy. Similarly, Abrams hinted that Palpatine being Rey's grandfather was an early idea he and Lawrence Kasdan had while working on The Force Awakens, although Daisy Ridley later claimed that ideas for Rey's lineage changed throughout filming of The Rise of Skywalker. Adam Driver claimed that back when shooting The Force Awakens, Kylo Ren was not meant to be redeemed by the end of the trilogy, which was the character arc Abrams had in mind at that moment, with Ren starting insecure about his commitment to the dark side before becoming the one most committed by the end of the trilogy in reversal to his grandfather Darth Vader's arc in the original trilogy, noting that Johnson took that planned direction in consideration when shooting The Last Jedi even though he took other decisions.\nCast\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 99%;\"\n!Character\n!The Force Awakens (2015)\n!The Last Jedi (2017)\n!The Rise of Skywalker (2019)\n|-\n|Han Solo\n|Harrison Ford\n|\n|Harrison Ford\n|-\n|Luke Skywalker\n| colspan=\"3\" |Mark Hamill\n|-\n|Leia Organa\n| colspan=\"3\" |Carrie Fisher\n|-\n|Ben Solo / Kylo Ren\n| colspan=\"3\" |Adam Driver\n|-\n|Rey\n| colspan=\"3\" |Daisy Ridley\n|-\n|Finn\n| colspan=\"3\" |John Boyega\n|-\n|Poe Dameron\n| colspan=\"3\" |Oscar Isaac\n|-\n|Maz Kanata\n| colspan=\"3\" |Lupita Nyong'o\n|-\n|Supreme Leader Snoke\n| colspan=\"2\" |Andy Serkis\n|\n|-\n|General Hux\n| colspan=\"3\" |Domhnall Gleeson\n|-\n|C-3PO\n| colspan=\"3\" |Anthony Daniels\n|-\n|Chewbacca\n|Peter Mayhew\n| colspan=\"2\" |Joonas Suotamo\n|-\n|Captain Phasma\n| colspan=\"2\" |Gwendoline Christie\n|\n|-\n|Rose Tico\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" |Kelly Marie Tran\n|-\n|Vice-Admiral Holdo\n|\n|Laura Dern\n|\n|-\n|Jannah\n| colspan=\"2\"\n|Naomi Ackie\n|-\n|Allegiant General Pryde\n|colspan=\"2\"\n|Richard E.
