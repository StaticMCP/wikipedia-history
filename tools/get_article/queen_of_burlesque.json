Young and Marion Martin. The film was distributed by the low-budget Producers Releasing Corporation. Rose La Rose, who played Blossom Terrain, was a stripper in real life and, according to Variety, a \"runway peeler with considerable experience.\" She portrays a supporting character and has one feature dance, a faux \"Arabian Fantasy\" that is not a striptease.\nPlot\nWhen striptease artiste Blossom Terraine is strangled backstage at a burlesque theater, fellow dancer Crystal is suspected of the murder. Crystal's reporter boyfriend Steve turns detective in an attempt to prove her innocence.\nCast\n*Evelyn Ankers as Crystal McCoy\n*Carleton G.
