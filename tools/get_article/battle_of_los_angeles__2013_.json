He rated the night one 7.7, calling it PWG's \"second-worst show of the year\" in comparison to other shows which featured more acclaimed performances and would have been equivalent to Ring of Honor's \"Show of the Year candidate\". According to him, it \"was a fantastic show full of consistent wrestling and entertainment\". He criticized the placement of the six-man tag team match as the main event, believing it was \"a before-intermission spotfest more so than an actual main event.\"\nHe considered the night two to be virtually perfect, rating it a full 10 score. He stated that the tournament's night two was PWG's \"one of the very best shows\" ever, with \"the perfect blend of comedy, brawling, insane spotfests, and storyline\".\nAftermath\nKevin Steen's shocking alliance with Adam Cole and The Young Bucks led to the formation of a new faction called Mount Rushmore of Wrestling.\nAfter winning the 2013 Battle of Los Angeles, Kyle O'Reilly received his title shot for the PWG World Championship against Adam Cole at Matt Rushmore, which he failed to win after interference by Cole's Mount Rushmore teammates Kevin Steen and The Young Bucks. O'Reilly received another title shot against Cole in a Knockout and Submission Only match at ''Sold Our Soul For Rock 'n Roll'', where he finally defeated Cole to win the PWG World Championship.\nThe Young Bucks' assault on Candice LeRae and Joey Ryan led to the latter duo forming a tag team and challenging the Bucks for the World Tag Team Championship at Matt Rushmore, which they failed to win. LeRae and Ryan continued to feud with the Mount Rushmore as they teamed with Drake Younger to defeat Kevin Steen and the Bucks in a six-person tag team match at All Star Weekend 10, but lost to Cole Steen Cole (Adam Cole and Kevin Steen) in the 2014 Dynamite Duumvirate Tag Team Title Tournament. They named their team called \"The World's Cutest Tag Team\" and defeated the Bucks in a Guerrilla Warfare at Eleven.\nResults\nTournament brackets\n| RD1-team03 =A. R.
