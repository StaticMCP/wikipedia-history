How can a page confirm that it has \"gone viral\" (whatever this means) or garnered hundreds of thousands of views?\n2:  The reference for this is a web page that dates from October 2013, that says next to nothing, and that cannot say anything about anything during the period from November 2013 to the present.\nThis makes me think that every one of the references here should be examined.\nAnother point: . This is what Takei does, often several times a day. Having images shared by Takei may be an honor, but if so then it's one bestowed on many people. -- Hoary (talk) 06:12, 22 July 2025 (UTC)}}\n----\nWars on Kinkade is a viral art series created by California-based artist and designer Jeff Bennett. The collection juxtaposes imagery from the Star Wars franchise with the stylistic hallmarks of Thomas Kinkade’s paintings, blending idyllic Americana landscapes with the visual language of sci-fi authoritarianism. The series gained widespread attention online in the 2010s for its mashup of nostalgic domesticity and imperial militarism, and continues to be shared across art, geek culture, and religious commentary platforms.\nConcept and creation\nBennett began the series as a personal creative experiment, inserting stormtroopers, AT-ATs, Star Destroyers, and other elements of the Galactic Empire into peaceful, light-filled environments reminiscent of Kinkade’s signature style. The project was partly a commentary on the sentimental veneer of commercial Americana, contrasting Kinkade's idealized world with the ever-looming presence of Empire. According to Bennett, the decision to use dark side characters was intentional: Kinkade was known as the “Painter of Light,” and this served as a conceptual foil for introducing the dark side of the Force into his aesthetic.\nReception\nThe series first gained major online traction in 2013 and 2014, when several design and entertainment publications shared Bennett's work. Articles in Wired, Fast Company, and Flavorwire noted the humorous but unsettling blend of Star Wars iconography with traditional American idealism. The Huffington Post called the series “bizarrely beautiful,” and Bored Panda published a gallery that went viral, garnering hundreds of thousands of views.\nIn addition to news coverage, the series was widely discussed on social media and forums. Actor and pop culture commentator George Takei shared the images on Facebook, introducing them to his millions of followers. In 2015, the blog My One Beautiful Thing featured the series, writing: “I, for one, am ready to reconsider [Kinkade’s] work now that Darth Vader has shown up.”\nIn 2025, the publication Plough referenced one of Bennett’s works in an article exploring the loss of Eden and modern nostalgia. The image was used as a visual metaphor for the tensions between contemporary fantasy and traditional ideals, reinforcing the series' ongoing relevance. Earlier coverage by Relevant Magazine and design blogs such as Creativepool and Think Christian also highlighted the cultural impact of the mashups.\nCultural impact\nThough unofficial and not commercially licensed, Wars on Kinkade has remained part of internet culture for over a decade, with occasional resurgences as new audiences rediscover the work. The series has been cited in articles discussing the intersection of pop culture and religion, the reinterpretation of kitsch art, and the appeal of parody in digital art.\nSee also\n* Mashup (culture)\n* Parody art\n* Internet meme\n* Fan art\n* Thomas Kinkade\n* Star Wars fandom\nReferences"
