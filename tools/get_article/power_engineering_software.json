It is a type of application software used for power engineering problems which are transformed into mathematical expressions.\nHistory\nThe first software program for power engineering was created by the end of the 1960s for the purpose of monitoring power plants. In the following decades, Power engineering and Computer technologies developed very fast. Software programs were created to collect data for power plants. One of the first computer languages used in Nuclear plants and Thermal plants was C (programming language).  The first power systems analysis program to feature a graphical user interface and [https://www.ipsa-power.com/ IPSA] was designed in the mid-1970s. Other platforms for electrical power modelling were created by the end of the 1980s. Currently, the programming language Python, commonly used in French Nuclear plants, is used to write energy-efficient algorithms and software programs.\nClassification\nPower Plants Analysis Software\nThe early 2000s saw the rapid development of analytical programming and 3D modeling. Software products were being created for designing power plants and their elements and connections. The programs were based on mathematical algorithms and computations. Power software such as [https://www.ipsa-power.com/ IPSA], [https://www.skm.com/ SKM], [https://www.cyme.com/ CYME], DINIS, PSS/E, DIgSILENT and ETAP are pioneers in the category of power engineering software. Most of these products used MARKAL, ESME and other modelling methods. The transmission lines were designed according to minimum requirements set out in the SQSS (security and quality of supply standard). This also applies to other elements of the power systems. In the software world, many CAD software products for 2D and 3D electrical designs were developed.\nRenewable Energy Controller Software\nThe controllers of Renewable energy used different software. The digital controllers are of different types: ADC, DAC, 4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit, and many others. To date, the controllers are mostly programmed with computer languages like: C, C++, Java and others.\nPower Engineering Protection Software\nAnother kind of software is one for simulating security systems for power systems and power plants. Such software simulates the activation of the various types of protections, which protects the transformers, power lines and other components. It graphs the different characteristics of the protections. Mathematical models have been set for all components of the power engineering system. It is up to the user to choose what type of protection to put on the energy objects. Protections are also mathematically modeled when they are connected to power engineering objects. The parameters of the emergency are set and based on the mathematical model, all the calculations are performed to obtain the output graphs and results.\nSoftware products\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
