He was a member of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, the Defence Council, and the Air Force Board, which administered the Royal Air Force.  The following positions were part of the Air Force Board:\n*Secretary of State for Defence – as Chairman\n*Minister of State for the Armed Forces – as Vice-chairman\n*Minister of State for Defence Procurement\n*Under-Secretary of State for the Armed Forces\n*Under-Secretary of State for Defence Procurement\n*Chief of the Air Staff – with the rank of air chief marshal (generally the Chief of Air Staff would be promoted to the rank of Marshal of the Royal Air Force upon retirement at the conclusion of their term as CAS)\n*Air Member for Personnel – with the rank of air marshal\n*Air Member for Supply and Organisation – with the rank of air marshal\n*Controller of Aircraft – usually an RAF officer with the rank of air marshal, though in 1989 it was held by a member of the Civil Service\n*Second Permanent Under-Secretary of State and Controller R & D Establishments, Research and Nuclear\nThe manned strength of the Royal Air Force in 1989 was 93,300&nbsp;personnel.\nRAF Strike Command\nRoyal Air Force Strike Command (RAF Strike Command, or RAF STC), was the main and primary command of the Royal Air Force, and was in charge of all operational (front-line or combat) Royal Air Force units and assets in the United Kingdom.  Its Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) was Air Chief Marshal Sir Patrick Hine, who double-hatted as NATO, Commander-in-Chief United Kingdom Air Forces (CINCUKAIR), which was a major subordinate command under NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe.  In 1989, RAF Strike Command consisted of three major operational groups, along with its subordinate wings, squadrons and minor units; and also had administrative control of the Royal Observer Corps (ROC), which was tasked with nuclear warfare analysis and manned the UK's nuclear fallout warning service.\n*UK Regional Air Operations Centre, RAF High Wycombe\n**Headquarters No. 1 Group, RAF Upavon\n**Headquarters No. 11 (Air Defence) Group, RAF Bentley Priory\n**Headquarters No. 18 (Maritime) Group, Northwood Headquarters, doubled as NATO Commander Maritime Air Eastern Atlantic (COMAIREASTLANT) and Commander Allied Maritime Air Force Channel (COMAIRCHAN)\n**Royal Observer Corps, RAF Bentley Priory, administrative control, but financed mostly by the Home Office under UK Warning and Monitoring Organisation\n**Central Tactics and Trials Organisation, RAF High Wycombe\n**Strike Command Air-to-Air Missile Establishment, RAF Valley\n**Strike Command Integrated Communications System.\nNo. 1 Group\n}}\nof No. 13 Squadron.|alt=]]\nof No. 233 Operational Conversion Unit.|alt=]]\nof No. 6 Squadron (foreground) and No. 41 Squadron (background).|alt=]]\nfree-fall nuclear bomb (training example), as available for the tactical nuclear strike role.|alt=]]\nNo. 1 Group Royal Air Force (1 Gp RAF) was the Royal Air Force group commanded by Air Vice-Marshal (AVM) Charles John Thomson (until February 1989), then AVM Ronald Andrew Fellowes Wilson (from February 1989), headquartered at RAF Upavon in Wiltshire.  1 Group contained varied aircraft, with the majority being strike aircraft.  The group's main focus would have been bombing raids on advancing Soviet ground forces in Northern Germany as directed by NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SAC-E).  The group fielded six squadrons of bomber aircraft, which could be armed with WE.177 free-fall tactical nuclear bombs, along with aerial refuelling tanker aircraft to ensure that the armed aircraft could deliver nuclear strikes deep inside enemy territory.\n*No. 1 Group, group headquarters, RAF Upavon\n**Mobile Air Operations Team, 244 Signal Squadron, Royal Corps of Signals, RAF Upavon\n**RAF Aldergrove — under operational control of Headquarters Northern Ireland\n***No. 72 Squadron RAF — Wessex HC2\n***No. 3 Squadron RAF Regiment — field\n**RAF Benson\n***No. 115 Squadron RAF — radio and airport navigation aid calibration, Andover C1 / E3 / E3A\n***Queen's Flight — Royal Flight, BAe 146 CC2, Wessex HCC4\n**RAF Brize Norton\n***No. 10 Squadron RAF — transport, 13x Vickers VC10 C1\n***No. 101 Squadron RAF — aerial refuelling, 9x Vickers VC10 K2 / K3\n***No. 216 Squadron RAF — aerial refuelling, transport, and cargo, 9x Tristar K1 / KC1\n***No. 241 Operational Conversion Unit RAF — trained Vickers VC10 and Tristar crews\n***No. 19 Squadron RAF Regiment — air defence, Rapier launch stations, defending RAF Upper Heyford and RAF Fairford\n**RAF Coltishall\n***No. 6 Squadron RAF — tactical nuclear strike, ground attack / reconnaissance, 12x Jaguar GR1Anote 1\n***No. 41 Squadron RAF — reconnaissance, 12x Jaguar GR1A\n***No. 54 Squadron RAF — tactical nuclear strike, ground attack / reconnaissance, 12x Jaguar GR1Anote 1\n**RAF Honington\n***No. 13 Squadron RAF — reconnaissance, Tornado GR1A (activated 1 January 1990)\n***No. 45 Squadron RAF — Tornado Weapons Conversion Unit, Tornado GR1note 1\n***No. 20 Squadron RAF Regiment — air defence, Rapier launch stations, defending RAF Alconbury, RAF Mildenhall, and RAF Lakenheath\n**RAF Lyneham\n***No. 24 Squadron RAF — tactical airlift, Hercules C1 / C3\n***No. 30 Squadron RAF — tactical airlift, Hercules C1 / C3\n***No. 47 Squadron RAF — tactical airlift, Hercules C1 / C3\n***No. 70 Squadron RAF — tactical airlift, Hercules C1 / C3\n***No. 242 Operational Conversion Unit RAF, (Hercules C1 / C3\n**RAF Marham\n***No. 27 Squadron RAF — tactical nuclear strike, ground attack / reconnaissance, Tornado GR1\n***No. 617 Squadron RAF — tactical nuclear strike, ground attack / reconnaissance, Tornado GR1\n***No. 55 Squadron RAF — aerial refuelling, 14x Victor K2\n**RAF Northolt\n***No. 32 Squadron RAF — VIP flight, 12x BAe 125 CC2 / CC3, Andover CC2, Gazelle HCC4\n**RAF Odiham\n***No. 7 Squadron RAF — air assault, Chinook HC1\n***No. 33 Squadron RAF — tactical airlift, Puma HC1\n***No. 240 Operational Conversion Unit RAF — Puma HC1, Chinook HC1\n***Support Helicopter Standards and Evaluation Flight\n**RAF Wittering\n***No. 1 Squadron RAF — tactical nuclear strike, ground attack / reconnaissance, Harrier GR5\n***No. 233 Operational Conversion Unit RAF — Harrier GR5\n**RAF Brawdy\n***No. 1 Tactical Weapons Unit RAF\n****No. 79 (R) Squadron RAF — Hawk T1A\n****No. 234 (R) Squadron RAF — Hawk T1A\n**RAF Chivenor\n***No. 2 Tactical Weapons Unit RAF\n****No. 63 (R) Squadron RAF — Hawk T1A\n****No. 151 (R) Squadron RAF — Hawk T1A\nNote 1: Unit had a nuclear strike role with WE.177 tactical nuclear weapons.\nNo. 1 Group RAF also administered the flying units detached to Belize and the Falkland Islands:\n*British Forces Belize, Belize City, Belize\n**RAF Belize, Airport Camp, Ladyville\n***No. 1417 Flight RAF — ground attack / reconnaissance, Harrier GR3\n***No. 1563 Flight RAF — Puma HC1\n*British Forces Falkland Islands, RAF Mount Pleasant, Falkland Islands\n**RAF Mount Pleasant\n***No. 78 Squadron RAF — air assault, Chinook HC1; Search & Rescue, Sea King HAR3\n***No. 1435 Flight RAF — air defence and reconnaissance, 4x Phantom FGR2\n***No. 1312 Flight RAF — aerial refuelling, 1x Hercules C1K.\nNo. 11 (Air Defence) Group\n}}\nof No. 27 Squadron.|alt=]]\nNo. 11 (Air Defence) Group Royal Air Force (11 Gp RAF) was the Royal Air Force group commanded by Air Vice-Marshal Roger Hewlett Palin (until March) then William (Bill) John Wratten (from March), headquartered at RAF Bentley Priory.  11 Group was to defend the United Kingdom against all aerial threats, and fielded exclusively fighter aircraft and one air defence missile squadron.  In 1989, the Royal Air Force was speedily replacing its ageing Phantom air defence fighter aircraft with the more modern and more capable Tornado F3, whose superior supersonic acceleration, powerful radar and beyond-visual-range missiles made it the ideal platform to intercept and destroy Soviet bombers intent on attacking the United Kingdom.  In case of war, No. 11 (Air Defence) Group would have taken command of the five UK-based Hawk T1 training squadrons, which, armed with AIM-9L Sidewinder missiles would have become the last line of defence against Soviet air attacks.\n*No. 11 (Air Defence) Group, group headquarters, RAF Bentley Priory\n**RAF Coningsby\n***No. 5 Squadron RAF — fighter, Tornado F3\n***No. 29 Squadron RAF — fighter, Tornado F3\n***No. 229 Operational Conversion Unit RAF — Tornado F3\n***Battle of Britain Memorial Flight — historic aircraft memorial, Lancaster B1, Hurricane, Spitfire\n**RAF Leeming\n***No. 11 Squadron RAF — fighter, Tornado F3\n***No. 23 Squadron RAF — fighter, Tornado F3\n***No. 25 Squadron RAF — fighter, Tornado F3 (operational from 1 August 1989)\n**RAF Leuchars\n***No. 43 Squadron RAF — fighter, Tornado F3 (conversion from Phantom FG1 to Tornado F3 completed in September 1989)\n***No. 111 Squadron RAF — fighter / ground attack, Phantom FG1 (began to receive Tornado F3s in January 1990)\n***No. 228 Operational Conversion Unit RAF — Phantom FGR2\n***No. 27 Squadron RAF Regiment — air defence, Rapier launch stations\n**RAF Wattisham\n***No. 56 Squadron RAF — fighter / ground attack / reconnaissance, Phantom FGR2\n***No. 74 Squadron RAF — fighter, Phantom F-4J(UK) F3\n**RAF West Raynham\n***No. 66 Squadron RAF Regiment — air defence, Rapier launch stations, defending RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge\n***No. 85 Squadron RAF — Bloodhound Mk II surface-to-air missiles; D, E and F flights joined the squadron when No. 25 Squadron converted to Tornado F3 on 1 August 1989.\n****A Flight, at RAF West Raynham\n****B Flight, at RAF North Coates\n****C Flight, at RAF Bawdsey\n****D Flight, at RAF Barkston Heath\n****E Flight, at RAF Wattisham\n****F Flight, at RAF Wyton\n**RAF Fylingdales\n***UK Ballistic Missile Early Warning System.\nNo. 18 (Maritime) Group\n}}\nof No. 226 Operational Conversion Unit RAF.|alt=]]\nNo. 18 (Maritime) Group Royal Air Force (No. 18 Group RAF, or 18Gp RAF) was the Royal Air Force group commanded by Air Marshal Andrew L. Roberts (until August) then David Emmerson (from August), headquartered at the Northwood Headquarters.  During war, the Commander of No. 18 Group would also assume the titles of Commander Maritime Air Eastern Atlantic (COMAIREASTLANT) and Commander Allied Maritime Air Force Channel (COMAIRCHAN).  In case of war, No. 18 Group's Maritime Air Region North would have assumed the titles of NATO Commander Maritime Air Northern Sub-Area (COMMAIRNORLANT) and NATO Commander Maritime Air Nore Sub-Area Channel (COMAIRNORECHAN), and taken command of Norwegian Air Force and US Navy P-3 Orion anti-submarine aircraft at Andøya Air Station and Naval Air Station Keflavik respectively, as well as the Keflavik-based US Air Force F-15C/D Eagles to prevent vessels of the Soviet Navy's Northern Fleet from passing through the GIUK gap.\nThe Maritime Headquarters units provided additional reserve personnel to man the operations rooms and communications centres that directed 18 Group and the Royal Navy.\nThe two Maritime Air Regions were amalgamated in 1987, and Pitrevie became the backup to Northwood HQ, becoming the location of Air Officer Scotland and Northern Ireland only.\n*No. 18 (Maritime) Group, group headquarters, Northwood Headquarters, doubled as NATO Commander Maritime Air Eastern Atlantic (COMAIREASTLANT) and Commander Allied Maritime Air Force Channel (COMAIRCHAN)\n**Maritime Air Region North, RAF Pitreavie Castle, Rosyth, commanded by an Air Vice-Marshal, who doubled as RAF Air Officer Scotland and Northern Ireland, and NATO Commander Maritime Air Northern Sub-Area (COMMAIRNORLANT) and Commander Maritime Air Nore Sub-Area Channel (COMAIRNORECHAN)\n***RAF Kinloss\n****No. 120 Squadron RAF — maritime patrol, Nimrod MR2\n****No. 201 Squadron RAF — maritime patrol, Nimrod MR2\n****No. 206 Squadron RAF — maritime patrol, Nimrod MR2\n***RAF Lossiemouth\n****No. 8 Squadron RAF — airborne early warning and control, Avro Shackleton AEW2 (being replaced by 7x Sentry AEW1 aircraft, squadron was part of No. 11 (Air Defence) Group)\n****No. 12 Squadron RAF — maritime attack, Buccaneer S2Bnote 1\n****No. 208 Squadron RAF — maritime attack, Buccaneer S2Bnote 1\n****No. 226 Operational Conversion Unit RAF — land strike, Jaguar GR1 (unit was part of No. 1 Group)note 1\n****No. 237 Operational Conversion Unit RAF — maritime attack, Buccaneer S2Bnote 1\n****No. 48 Squadron RAF Regiment — air defence, Rapier launch stations\n**Maritime Air Region South, Admiralty House, Mount Wise, Plymouth, commanded by an Air Vice-Marshal, who doubled as NATO Commander Maritime Air Central Sub-Area (COMMAIRCENTLANT) and Commander Maritime Air Plymouth Sub-Area Channel (COMAIRPLYMCHAN)\n***RAF St Mawgan\n****No. 42 Squadron RAF — maritime patrol, Nimrod MR2\n****No. 236 Operational Conversion Unit RAF — Nimrod MR2\n***RAF Wyton\n****No. 51 Squadron RAF — signals intelligence, 3x Nimrod R1\n****No. 100 Squadron RAF — electronic countermeasures, Canberra T17\n****No. 360 Squadron RAF — electronic countermeasures, Canberra T17\n****No. 231 Operational Conversion Unit RAF — Canberra T17\n****No. 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit RAF — Canberra PR9\n****Electronic Warfare and Avionic Unit\n**Search and Rescue Wing, RAF Finningley\n***No. 22 Squadron RAF — SAR, four flights of 2x Wessex HC2 at RAF Chivenor, RAF Leuchars, RAF Valley, RAF Coltishall\n***No. 202 Squadron RAF — SAR, squadron moved to RAF Boulmer in 1989, five flights of 2x Sea King HAR3 at RAF Boulmer, RAF Leconfield, RAF Brawdy, RAF Lossiemouth, RAF Manston (flight moved to RAF Wattisham in 1989)\n***Search and Rescue Training Unit\n***Search and Rescue Engineering\n**No. 1 (County of Hertford) Maritime Headquarters Unit, RAF Northwood (augmented HQ 18 Group)\n**No. 2 (City of Edinburgh) Maritime Headquarters Unit, Edinburgh (augmented HQ Northern Maritime Air Region and RAF Pitreavie Castle operations centre after 1987)\n**No. 3 (County of Devon) Maritime Headquarters Unit, RAF Mount Batten (augmented Southern Maritime Air Region)\nNote 1: Unit had a nuclear strike role with WE.177 tactical nuclear weapons.\nRoyal Observer Corps\nThe Royal Observer Corps (ROC) was commanded by the Commandant Royal Observer Corps with the rank of Air Commodore, and headquartered at RAF Bentley Priory.  The corps was tasked with detecting and reporting nuclear explosions and associated fallout as the field force for the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation, (UKWMO).  By the late 1980s, the ROC comprised 69&nbsp;professional full-time officers, approximately 10,500&nbsp;civilian part-time volunteers, and over 100 Ministry of Defence (MoD) civilian support staff.\nRAF Germany\n}}\nof No. 92 Squadron prior to landing at RAF Wildenrath in the mid-1980s|alt=]]\nRoyal Air Force Germany (RAF Germany, or RAFG), a major command of the Royal Air Force, consisted of Royal Air Force units located in West Germany as part of the United Kingdom's commitment to the defence of Western Europe during the Cold War.  In wartime, the air marshal in command of RAFG would also have assumed the command of NATO's Second Allied Tactical Air Force.  RAFG's main missions were to protect the British Army of the Rhine from Warsaw Pact air attacks, and bomb hostile armour formation.  In case Soviet spearheads would have breached the Weser-line on the western side of the Upper Weser Valley, RAF Germany was trained and equipped to attack enemy troop concentrations to the east of the Weser with tactical nuclear weapons.\nTo fulfil its mission, RAFG had a varied mix of fixed-wing jet aircraft and rotary-wing aircraft under its command: Phantom FGR2 (fighter / ground attack / reconnaissance), Tornado GR1 (fighter-bomber / reconnaissance), helicopters, and Harrier GR5 vertical/short takeoff and landing (V/STOL) (ground attack / reconnaissance).  As the most forward deployed units, the Harriers would have dispersed to auxiliary airfields, forest clearings, and road runways, during the transition to war to protect them from Soviet air attacks.  The British Army's 38th Engineer Regiment and the Royal Auxiliary Air Force (RAuxF) Regiment's No. 2624 (County of Oxford) Field Squadron would have supported the Harrier Force at these dispersed locations.\n*Royal Air Force Germany, command headquarters, RAF Rheindahlen, doubles as commander of NATO's Second Allied Tactical Air Force\n**RAF Germany Photographic Reproduction Unit, RAF Rheindahlen\n**RAF Bruggen\n***No. 9 Squadron — tactical nuclear strike, ground attack / reconnaissance, 12x Tornado GR1note 1\n***No. 14 Squadron — tactical nuclear strike, ground attack / reconnaissance, 12x Tornado GR1note 1\n***No. 17 Squadron — tactical nuclear strike, ground attack / reconnaissance, 12x Tornado GR1note 1\n***No. 31 Squadron — tactical nuclear strike, ground attack / reconnaissance, 12x Tornado GR1note 1\n***No. 37 Squadron RAF Regiment — air defence, Rapier launch stations\n***No. 51 Squadron RAF Regiment — light armour, Spartan, Scorpion\n***No. 11 Signals Unit\n***No. 431 Maintenance Unit RAF — airframe repair\n****No. 431 Maintenance Unit Detachment, RAF Laarbruch\n**RAF Gütersloh\n***No. 3 Squadron — ground attack / reconnaissance, Harrier GR5\n***No. 4 Squadron — ground attack / reconnaissance, Harrier GR5\n***No. 18 Squadron — Chinook HC1, supporting British Army of the Rhine\n***No. 230 Squadron — Puma HC1, supporting British Army of the Rhine\n***No. 63 Squadron RAF Regiment — air defence, Rapier launch stations\n**RAF Laarbruch\n***No. 2 Squadron — reconnaissance, Jaguar GR1A / T2A, (replaced with Tornado GR1A from January 1989)\n***No. 15 Squadron — tactical nuclear strike, ground attack / reconnaissance, 12x Tornado GR1note 1\n***No. 16 Squadron — tactical nuclear strike, ground attack / reconnaissance, 12x Tornado GR1note 1\n***No. 20 Squadron — tactical nuclear strike, ground attack / reconnaissance, 12x Tornado GR1note 1\n***No. 1 Squadron RAF Regiment — light armour, Spartan, Scorpion\n***No. 26 Squadron RAF Regiment — air defence, Rapier launch stations\n**RAF Wildenrath\n***No. 19 Squadron — fighter / ground attack / reconnaissance, Phantom FGR2\n***No. 92 Squadron — fighter / ground attack / reconnaissance, Phantom FGR2\n***No. 60 Squadron — transport, Andover CC2, Pembroke C1\n***No. 16 Squadron RAF Regiment — air defence, Rapier launch stations\n**No. 4 Wing RAF Regiment, RAF Wildenrath, administrative control of West Germany-based Rapier squadrons defending Royal Air Force Germany airfields\n**No. 33 Wing RAF Regiment, RAF Gütersloh, administrative control of West Germany-based light armour squadrons defending Royal Air Force Germany airfields\n**No. 54 Signals Unit, Celle — co-located with 14th Signal Regiment (Electronic Warfare), Royal Signals\n**No. 735 Signals Unit, Borgholzhausen\nNote 1: Unit with nuclear strike role with 18x WE.177 tactical nuclear weapons.\nRAF Support Command\nof the RAF Institute of Aviation Medicine prior to landing at RAF Farnborough.|alt=]]\nRoyal Air Force Support Command (RAF Support Command, or RAF SupC), a main command of the Royal Air Force, was commanded by an air marshal, and headquartered at RAF Brampton in Cambridgeshire.  During war, the command would have moved to its Emergency War Headquarter to a bunker at RAF Holmpton.  Support Command had been created in 1973 by merging RAF Maintenance Command, with No. 90 (Signals) Group.  In 1977, Support Command absorbed Training Command making it additionally responsible for all RAF ground and aircrew training.\nIn 1989, RAF Support Command was responsible for all signals under, logistics (Movements), maintenance (Air Officer Commanding Maintenance Units and Air Officer Maintenance, RAF Support Command), personnel management, ground transport (MT), supply, basic flying training, ground crew training (Air Officer Commanding Training Units and Air Officer Training, RAF Support Command), ordnance, recruitment, medical services, airbase services, IT systems, etc.  Air Officer Commanding (AOC) were air vice-marshals.  Below follows a provisional, unverified, partial listing of this large part of the Royal Air Force.\nAOC Training Units and AO Training\nThe Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Training Units and Air Officer (AO) Training was an air vice-marshal (AVM) responsible for all training establishments of the Royal Air Force.
