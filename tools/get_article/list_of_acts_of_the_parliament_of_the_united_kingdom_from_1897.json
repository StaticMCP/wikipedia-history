For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign. Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\". Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\nAll modern acts have a short title, e.g. the Local Government Act 2003. Some earlier acts also have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n60 & 61 Vict.\nThe third session of the 26th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 19 January 1897 until 6 August 1897.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  so far as they relate to Market Gardens.|note4= }}\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  as respects Female Nurses appointed after the commencement of the said Act.|note4= }}\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  with regard to Joint Committees for the purposes of the Burial Acts.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n| or the Weights and Measures (Metric) Act 1897or the Weights and Measures Act 1897|public|46|06-08-1897|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to legalise the Use of Weights and Measures of the Metric System.|note4= }}\n|  with respect to Rules for Volunteer Corps.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  with respect to the Power of Detention for undermanning.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  in regard to the additional grant to School Boards, and to provide out of the Exchequer an aid grant for Voluntary Schools in Scotland, and for the Exemption from Bates of those Schools.|note4= }}\n|\n| |note4= }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n}}\nLocal acts\nrelating to Lands in the Parish of St. George the Martyr Southwark.|po1=Order to enable the London County Council to put in force the powers of the Lands Clauses Acts with respect to the purchase and taking of land otherwise than by agreement for the purposes of Part III of the Housing of the Working Classes Act 1890.|po1short=n}}\n|\n|  relating to lands in the Parish of St. James Westminster.|note4=|po1=Order made by the Secretary of State under the Metropolitan Police Act 1886.|po1short=n|}}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  and for other purposes.}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  and for other purposes.}}\n| or the South Western Railway (Meon Valley) Act 1897|local|35|03-06-1897|maintained=y|archived=n|An Act for enabling the London and South Western Railway Company to construct new Railways and to widen their Farnham Alton and Winchester Railway in the county of Southampton and for other purposes.}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  and for conferring further powers on the Devonport Water Company for the construction of works and otherwise in relation to their undertaking and for other purposes.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  relating to the Urban Sanitary District of Kilkenny and the Rural Sanitary District of Scariff.|po1=Kilkenny Waterworks.
