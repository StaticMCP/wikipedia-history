She is seen as a driving force behind King Louis' struggle with the West Frankish king Charles the Bald around the possession of Lotharingia, culminating in the 876 Battle of Andernach and ending in the final acquisition of the Lotharingian realm by the 880 Treaty of Ribemont.\nMarriages and issue\nBefore 29 November 874, Liutgard married Louis the Younger (830/835&ndash;882), second son of King Louis the German, at Aschaffenburg, Franconia. They had two children:\n* Louis (877&ndash;879), reportedly died after a fall from a window of the Imperial palace in Frankfurt.\n* Hildegard (c. 879 &ndash; after 899), became a nun in Frauenchiemsee Abbey, Bavaria.\nReferences\nSources\n*"
