It is known for its mineral waters, spa, and the Khoymorski Datsan (Хойморский дацан) Boddhidharma Tibetan Buddhist temple. The name comes from the Buryat word for \"spring.\"\nArshan is located at an altitude of 900 m in a valley at the foot of the snow-capped Sayan Range and the Tunkin Pinnacles. It is 120&nbsp;km from the Kultuk railway station, 479&nbsp;km from Ulan-Ude, and 210&nbsp;km from Irkutsk. Arshan is built on the banks of the Kyngyrga River of the Eastern Sayan Range, which has more than 12 waterfalls. The village is the center of the Arshan rural municipal district.\nHistory\nOn August 9, 1894, the Khoymorsky missionary Chistokhin gave a presentation about the mineral springs at a meeting of the Academic Council of Tomsk State University. By the end of the 19th century, there were 52 permanent residents and 40 vacation homes.\nIn May, 1920, after the Tunkinsky valley was liberated from Kolchak's White Cossacks, the governor of Irkutsk ordered Arshan to take on the wounded from the Red army. During 1920, 320 people rested and were treated there. In 1922, a bath complex was built, and in 1925, two-bedroom housing was built. In 1926, a small hydroelectric plant was built on the Kyngyrga River.\nIn Summer 1927, the carbonated mineral water plant began production. In 1932, a cafeteria building was built.\nArshan had the status of urban settlement from 1975 to 1979.\nPresent\nThe Arshan resort is made up of two sanatoriums: Sayan and Arshan, both in the Baikal spa trade union. The Khoymorsky Datsan  temple is also located on the grounds.\nThe main therapeutic factors in the mildly acidic thermal water are carbon, low-mineralized silicates, sulfates, magnesi-hydrocarbons and sulfide silt mud, which are reputed to effectively treat diseases of the metabolism and the digestive, circulatory, respiratory, urinary and endocrine systems. The waters range in temperature from 11 to 45&nbsp;°C. The waters belong to Class 1 of the classification system of V. A. Alexandrova because of their high carbolic acid gas content.\nThe sanatorium treatment includes modern diagnostic methods, drinking the therapeutic Arshan water, balneotherapy (baths, showers and irrigation), climate, diet therapy, physical therapy, paraffin ozokerite therapy, massage, halotherapy, and inhalation therapy. The water used for bathing and drinking is bottled. The Chief Physician at the resort is Vladimir Ivanovich Songolov.\nOne of the largest waterfalls on the Kyngurga River is a half-hour walk from the town. In the vicinity, there are more than 20 active volcanoes. Although the last eruption was in the Mesozoic era, the volcanoes are not considered completely extinct because of the presence of numerous hot springs. The mineral springs of Suburga and Papi Arshan are nearby.\nClimate\nThe climate is continental. Winter is long and cold, summers are short and moderately warm. 595&nbsp;mm of precipitation per year (maximum in summer). Diseases: Mineral water is one of the sources.\n|date=April 2012\n|source 2 =\n}}\nTransportation\nThe resort is connected by regular bus service from Irkutsk, Ulan-Ude, Slyudyanka and Kyren.\nTelecommunications\nThere are four mobile operators in Arshan: Baikalvestcom (BVK), MegaFon, MTS and Beeline.\nImages\nFile:Аршан.
