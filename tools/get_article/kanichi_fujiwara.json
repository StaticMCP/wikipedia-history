His 1995 trip around Japan was documented in his 1997 book The Original Bike Bastard Starving Around Japan.\nBetween March 2004 and May 2008 he made a  journey circumnavigating the world on a Yamaha Passol electric scooter, on a route including Australia from Sydney to Perth, Thailand, India to Lisbon, South Africa to Kenya, and America from New York to San Francisco (44 countries). It may have been the first global circumnavigation by electric two-wheeler. Fujiwara visited and documented the sites of sacred trees in various countries to spread awareness of green transportation.\nThe scooter he used in the 2004–2008 circumnavigation, sponsored by Yamaha, weighed , had a 30&nbsp;km/h top speed, and an endurance of 20&nbsp;km on a battery charge. Even with six batteries giving a 100&nbsp;km range, his partner had to shuttle charged batteries to him in order to cross Australia's Nullarbor Plain.\nBetween April 2009 and November 2013, he rode 100,000 kilometers across Japan's major highways on a 50&nbsp;cc Honda Cub, sponsored by motorcycle apparel supplier Rough & Road, and supported by serializing his journeys in the Japanese magazine Tandem Style and on his own blog.\nOnline journalism\nIn addition to various blogs covering his motorcycle travels, Fujiwara is also a food critic.  His \"Tabigohan\" column covers road food at roadside stations and other Japanese venues for BBB-Bike, an online publication of large Japanese auction house BDS.\nBibliography\n*\nNotes and references\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*}}\n*\n*}}\n*|access-date=November 17, 2013|archive-date=June 10, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610222656/http://j.people.com.cn/2004/03/23/jp20040323_37849.html|url-status=dead}}\n*\n*\n*\n*}}\n*}}\n*}}\n*}}\n*}}\n*\n*|issue=122}}\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.wtn-j.com/html/column/0905fujiwara_kanichi/0905kanichi.htm Long distance rides] at World Touring Network—Japan"
