The song was later included on the album The Presidents of the United States of America.\nAccording to Dave Dederer, the song was based \"as far as I know\" on a true story about \"a bad little cat that lived in some [apartment] Chris shared with some folks in Boston\".\nDescription\nThe song describes a man's desire to pet a cat that has been out all night, implied to be a feral cat. After a moment of bliss, the cat turns on him and scratches him and he decides to let it spend the night outside again.\nMusic video\nA music video for \"Kitty\" was filmed on October 25, 1995.
