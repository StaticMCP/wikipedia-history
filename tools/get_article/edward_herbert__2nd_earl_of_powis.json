He was the grandson of Clive of India.\nEarly life\nEdward was born on 22 March 1785, the son of Edward Clive, 1st Earl of Powis, and his wife, the former Henrietta Herbert. He was one of four children. His younger brother, Robert Henry Clive, was a noted politician. His elder sister, Henrietta, was the wife of Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 5th Baronet. His younger sister, Charlotte, was the wife of Hugh Percy, 3rd Duke of Northumberland, and she was famously the governess of the future Queen Victoria.\nEdward was educated at Eton and St John's College, Cambridge, graduating as M.A. in 1806 and being awarded LL.D. by the same university in 1835. He also became an honorary D.C.L. from Oxford University in 1844, the year he also became a Knight of the Garter\nPeerage and estates\nFile:Shield of arms of Edward Herbert, 2nd Earl of Powis, KG.png|Garter-encircled arms of Edward Herbert, 2nd Earl of Powis, KG\nFile:Powis Castle 2016 116.jpg|Powis Castle, Wales\nAfter 1804, when his father was created Earl of Powis, he was known by the courtesy title of Viscount Clive, his father's second title. In 1806, he became a Member of Parliament for Ludlow, retaining the seat until he inherited the earldom and entered the House of Lords. He was also heir to his uncle George Herbert, 2nd Earl of Powis, who had died unmarried in 1801, and inherited the Powis Castle estates on condition that he assume the name and arms of Herbert only in lieu of those of Clive, which he did by Royal licence on 9 March 1807; other conditions were that he should settle his uncle's large gambling debts and that his father should leave the Clive estates to his younger son, Robert Henry Clive.\nCareer\nOn 29 November 1808 he was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant of the Eastern Montgomeryshire Local Militia, which existed until 1816. Powis also had long service in the Shropshire Yeomanry. In 1807 he was appointed major in command of a troop raised from Ludlow and Bishop's Castle towns, which merged into a larger South Shropshire Yeomanry Cavalry regiment in 1814. He continued under command within the new regiment, to which he succeeded as lieutenant-colonel in 1827. Succeeding his father as Lord-Lieutenant of Montgomeryshire in 1830, Powis played a leading role in the suppression of the Chartist riots of 1839, himself deploying four troops of his own regiment to disperse rioters from Newtown and apprehend some ringleaders while the Montgomeryshire Yeomanry were deployed in other parts of the same county. In addition to his yeomanry regiment, he was Colonel commanding the Royal Montgomeryshire Militia from 1846 to his death.\nIn 1812, as Viscount Clive, he served as treasurer of the Salop Infirmary in Shrewsbury.\nThe Earl was a bibliophile who built up by 1816 a book collection in Powis Castle sourced from travels in France, purchased partly from booksellers and partly from an auction of Empress Joséphine's library at Malmaison. He was elected to the Roxburghe Club in 1828 and became President in 1835, the year he sponsored their publication of The Lyvys of Seyntys (i.e. The Lives of Saints).\nA defender of Church of England interests in Wales, in the Lords he led a successful opposition over 1843 to 1847 to a proposal to unite the sees of Bangor and St Asaph. He was ultimately appointed to a Royal Commission on English and Welsh bishoprics. A sum of £5,000 raised in testimonial to him was devoted to found the Powis Exhibitions to assist Welsh students at Oxford and Cambridge Universities intending to take holy orders.\nIn 1847, he stood for election as Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, but was defeated by only 117 votes by Albert, Prince Consort.\nAn encourager of canal building in Shropshire and into Montgomeryshire, he was at the time of his death Chairman of the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company.\nPersonal life\n(1793–1875), Countess of Powis by Frederick Richard Say (1805-1868)]]\nOn 9 February 1818, Powis married Lady Lucy Graham, the daughter of James Graham, 3rd Duke of Montrose, and they had seven children, five boys and two girls:\n* Edward Herbert, 3rd Earl of Powis (1818–1891), who died unmarried.\n* Percy Egerton Herbert (1822–1876), who in 1860 married Lady Mary Petty-FitzMaurice, only child of Earl of Kerry, the eldest son of the 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne.
