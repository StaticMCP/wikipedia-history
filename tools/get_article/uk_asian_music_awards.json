The awards show has been produced and broadcast by B4U Music since 2008. Awards winners were decided by public voting at a website, from a list of nominees presented by the event organizers, except for the special category awards \"Outstanding Achievement\" and \"Commitment to Scene\" which are decided by the organizers. Desimag called the event \"The most prestigious Asian music awards ceremony in the UK\".\nHistory\nThe UK Asian Music Awards were founded by Abs Shaid in 2002 as \"The Asian DJ and Music Awards\". They were held on 6 March 2002 at the Aquarium nightclub in London. The event was filmed by BBC2 and Zee TV, and was aired on BBC2s Network East.\nFollowing the success of the 2002 event, the UK Asian Music Awards (UKAMA) was formed. In 2003, Abs Shaid teamed with Br-Asian Media, managed by managing director Moiz Vas, to produce the 2003 event. The event took place in London at Hammersmith Palais on the 22 October 2003. It was filmed and broadcast by ITV, who reported viewing figures of one million in the UK. B4U Music broadcast two exclusive versions during prime time slots in 80 countries over the Christmas period. Other sources give the viewing figures of 2 million in the UK and 500 million worldwide. A 2003 review by Tom Horan in The Telegraph said: \"This was a hugely inspiring night for new British music... The freshest most innovative and exciting sounds this year have come from the Asian club world. Here, with the first ever AMAs, the scene celebrated its gate crashing of the pop mainstream... there was something in the event's familial warmth and celebration that spoke of a thousand wedding receptions\". Award winners were decided via online, SMS and interactive television voting. The voting process was criticized, claiming that the event turned out to be a popularity contest.\nAfter the show, both parties claimed rights to continuing the show. This resulted in both parties issuing their own announcements for the next event, with Shaid's group keeping the name \"UK Asian Music Awards\" and Br-Asian's group calling it the British Asian Music Awards (BrAMA). ITV chose to side with BrAMA. and on 7 October 2004 Br-Asian made a launch party, planning for the 23 February 2005 at Ocean in London, which was later changed to 24 March 2005.\nThe 2005 UKAMA was held on 3 March 2005 at Hammersmith Palais, London, in front of a packed audience. To avoid some of the voting controversy, most awards were decided by a judges panel, out of a short list which was created by public voting. The winners of the Best Asian Radio, Best Asian Publication and Best Asian Website were determined by online and SMS voting.\nThe 2005 BrAMA were supposed to be held on 24 March 2005 at Cirque, in London. The event was supposed to be broadcast on Channel 4 on 27 March 2005 and shown on B4U Music a week later. However, to avoid confusion with the UKAMA, the event was postponed on 11 March 2005, and tickets were reimbursed. The event never took place, and finally, Br-Asian bowed out.\nThe 2006 event was held on 6 December 2006 at Hammersmith Palais, London, and was sponsored by Ary Digital. Two new categories were introduced, \"Best Female Act\" and \"Best Unsigned Talent\". Nominations were announced in November 2006.\n2008 marked the big year for the UK Asian Music Awards, as they moved from the Hammersmith Palais to the Royal Festival Hall and were first presented by B4U Music. Royal Festival Hall for three years (2008 / 2009 / 2010) and moved to the Roundhouse, Camden in March 2011. It has previously been broadcast on ITV, B4U Music and most recently on the BBC red button (2010 and 2011).  The UK AMAs celebrated its 10th anniversary on 25 October at Wimbley Arena, with a show headlined by international music star Ustad Rahat Fateh Ali Khan and was attended by music producer naughty boy.\nAward winners\n2003\nThe 2003 event was held on the 22 October 2003 at Hammersmith Palais, London.
