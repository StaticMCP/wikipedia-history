They travelled up the east coast, taking a mainly inland route until they came to the junction of Cattle Creek and the Pioneer River, in an area about 15 miles west of present-day Walkerston. They then followed the river, firstly named by Mackay's companions as the Mackay River but now known as the Pioneer River.\nThis town was commonly known as Scrubby Creek from as early as 1866, and sometimes as Baker's Creek; later these two names were interchangeable with Walkerston and, to a lesser degree, Alsatia. Scrubby Creek was definitely not a nickname for Walkerston; there were no inverted commas included when the words were printed in newspapers or almanacs. The name was well deserved, for the wild bush scrub grew luxuriantly on the banks of Baker's Creek.\nWalkerston Provisional School opened in November 1874 but  closed soon after due to low student numbers. It reopened but then closed on 31 March 1880 with the students transferred to the Alsatia State School which opened on 21 April 1880. About 1891 the school was renamed Walkerston State School.\nWhen the Queensland Surveyor-General combined the two former townships of  Walkerston and Alsaia in 1881, he chose to name the combined town Walkerston. John Walker was the lessee of the Homebush pastoral run since 31 May 1866.\nThe Pioneer Valley railway reached  Walkerston from Paget on 10 August 1885. Whilst there was a station building, there was no passenger platform, passengers accessing the trains from the ground.\nSt John's Catholic Primary School was established on 29 January 1924 by the Sisters of Mercy to provide Catholic education to both children of the town and the largely Maltese farming community. A boarding school was introduced to cater for students further along the Pioneer Valley, an arrangement that continued until 1976. The first lay principal was appointed in 1982 but the Sisters continued to be associated with the school until 1996.\nThe Polynesian Provisional School  opened in 1933  but closed that same year.\nThe Walkerston public library opened in 1977.\nDemographics\nIn the , the town of Walkerston had a population of 2,563 people.\nIn the , the locality of Walkerston had a population of 3,089 people.\nIn the , the locality of Walkerston had a population of 3,403 people.\nIn the , the locality of Walkerston had a population of 3,615 people.\nHeritage listings\nWalkerston has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* Walkerston State Butcher's Shop, 13 Dutton Street\n* Greenmount Homestead, Greenmount Road\nEducation\nWalkerston State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls on Dutton Street ().
