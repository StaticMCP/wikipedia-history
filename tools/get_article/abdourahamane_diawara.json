Diawara qualified for the men's 50 m freestyle, as Guinea's only swimmer, at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, without having an entry time. He challenged five other swimmers in heat one, including 16-year-old Emile Rony Bakale of Congo. He posted a lifetime best of 28.10 to save a fifth spot over Mali's David Keita by more than a second. Diawara failed to advance into the semifinals, as he placed seventy-sixth overall out of 86 swimmers in the preliminaries.\nReferences"
