The stream meanders southwest roughly paralleling Route A then veering south-southwest to its confluence with the Current River just after passing under Missouri Route 19 north of Round Spring.\nSinking Creek is one of the main features of Echo Bluff State Park, established in 2016. Park visitors often swim, wade, and float in the cool waters and swimming holes of the stream. The park's namesake is the Echo Bluff, which towers over the creek.\nSinking Creek was named for the fact it is a losing stream along part of its course.\nSee also\n*List of rivers of Missouri\nReferences"
