Located on the eastern edge of the Great Plains, the U.S. state of Kansas was the home of sedentary agrarian and hunter-gatherer Native American societies, many of whom hunted American bison. The region first appears in western history in the 16th century at the time of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, when Spanish conquistadors explored the unknown land now known as Kansas. It was later explored by French fur trappers who traded with the Native Americans. It became part of the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. In the 19th century, the first American explorers designated the area as the \"Great American Desert.\"\nWhen the area was opened to Euro-American settlement in the 1850s, Kansas became the first battlefield in the conflict in the American Civil War. After the war, Kansas was home to Wild West towns servicing the cattle trade. With the railroads came heavy immigration from the East, from Europe, and from Freedmen called \"Exodusters\". For much of its history, Kansas has had a rural economy based on wheat and other crops, supplemented by oil and railroads. Since 1945 the farm population has sharply declined and manufacturing has become more important, typified by the aircraft industry of Wichita.\nEarly history\n* 10,000-9000 BCE: First evidence of human beings in Kansas\n* 1450: Wichita people founded the historical city of Etzanoa, near the modern day Arkansas City.\n* 1500–1800: Proto-historic indigenous peoples in Kansas include the Pawnee, Kansa, Wichita, and Apache.\n* 1541: Francisco Vásquez de Coronado, the Spanish conquistador, visits Kansas.\n* 17th century: Kansa (sometimes Kaw) and Osage Nation arrive in Kansas.

The settlement is named Blue Earth Village.\n* End of the 18th century: Kansa and Osage Nation dominant in the eastern part of the state — the Kansa on the Kansas River to the north and the Osage on the Arkansas River to the south. Pawnees were dominant on the plains to the west and north of the Kansa and Osage nations, in regions home to massive herds of buffalo.\n* 1803: Kansas, as part of the Louisiana Purchase, annexed to the United States as unorganized territory.\n* 1806: Zebulon Pike passes through the region, and labels it \"the Great American Desert\" on his maps.\n* 1812: The Kansa and Pawnee fight a large battle at Blue Earth Village.\n1820s to 1840s: Indian treaties and westward trails\n* 1820s: Kansas area (by then popularly known as the Great American Desert) is set aside as Indian territory by the U.S. government and closed to settlement by whites.\n* 1821: After a brief period as part of Missouri Territory, Kansas returned to unorganized status.\n* 1821: Santa Fe Trail was opened across Kansas as country's transportation route to the Southwest, connecting Missouri with Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n* 1825, June 3: 20 million acres (81000&nbsp;km2) of land ceded by the Kansa Nation to the United States, and the Kansa tribe are thereafter limited to a specific reservation in northeast Kansas.\n* 1825, June: Osage Nation was limited to a reservation in southeast Kansas.\n* 1825, November 7:  Missouri Shawanoes (or Shawnees) are the first Native Americans removed to the territory by treaty.\n* 1827, May 8: Cantonment Leavenworth, or Fort Leavenworth, (named in honor of Henry Leavenworth) built just inside Indian territory to guard travelers on the United States' Western frontier.
