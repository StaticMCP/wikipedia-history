The term applies to all democratic countries in which religion is incorporated into the form of government.\nDemocracies are characterized as secular or religious.[http://www.gazellebookservices.co.uk/ISBN/1904063187.htm 1904063187 : 9781904063186:Theory of Religious Democracy]  The definition of democracy is disputed and interpreted differently amongst politicians and scholars. The religiosity of political leaders can also have an effect on the practice of democracy.\nSome argue that religious democracies can be also be liberal democracies, such as religious liberalism.\nHistorical\nHistorical democracies with state sponsored religious laws:\n* Athenian democracy (Ancient Greek religion)\n* Roman Republic (Ancient Roman religion)\n* Hindu s and Khap and Caste Panchayats\n* Buddhist s\n* Icelandic Commonwealth (Norse paganism, after AD 1000 Christianity)\n* Old Swiss Confederacy (Christianity)\n* Kingdom of Nepal was once the world's only Hindu Kingdom during the monarch's rule but has ceased to be so following a declaration by the Parliament in 2006. The official religion of Nepal was Hinduism but in 2006 Nepal became democratic country and constitution declared it as a Secular state with freedom of religion is guaranteed by Constitution. During the rule of the Monarch, there was democratic rule, and for a brief time, a partyless religious democracy of the Panchayat (Nepal) system.\nContemporary\nContemporary countries which claim to be democracies with state religions:\n* Christian democracy:\n**Armenia, Costa Rica, Denmark, England, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Malta, Monaco, Nicaragua, Norway, Samoa, Scotland, Tuvalu, Zambia\n* Islamic democracy:\n** Algeria, Bangladesh, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Jordan, Libya,  Malaysia, Maldives, Mauritania, Morocco, Palestine, Pakistan,  Somalia, Yemen\n* Buddhism and democracy:\n** Bhutan, Cambodia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka\n* Jewish and democratic state:\n** Israel\nCriticism\nMajor criticism of religious democracy include criticism from the secular and the legalist points of view.[http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=6426&sec=59&con=33 WorldWide Religious News-President Says Democracy Conforms With Religion in Iran]\n* From the secular point of view, religion is a hindrance to democracy as it enforces a set of legal and societal principles. Separation of religion and state is required to protect freedom and ensure equality. As many countries, including the United States, incorporate religion into their legislation, it could be argued as to what constitutes a secular democracy.\n* From the legal point of view, democracy can never enjoy general acceptance in a religious society. Anything outside of rigid interpretation of religious texts is rejected, and God rather than the people is sovereign.\n* Conversion is a threat to diversity richness of a nation. It installs fear among the people of a particular community as they find their population shrinking due to conversion.\nSee also\nReferences"
