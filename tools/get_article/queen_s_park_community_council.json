The council was the first to be formed in Greater London and remains the only one. It was established on 1 April 2014 following a referendum of residents in 2012. Elections to the community council are held every four years and coincide with Westminster City Council elections. The first election of 12 councillors from four wards took place on 22 May 2014. The chair of the council is Eartha Pond.\nBackground\nParish councils were established in England in 1894. They had been eliminated from the London area by 1936 and were not permitted in Greater London when it was created in 1965. The Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 permitted the creation of parish councils in the 32 London boroughs and permitted the alternative naming style of community council. A referendum was held in the Queen's Park ward of Westminster in 2012 to gauge support for a new parish council and it was approved by Westminster City Council in May 2012. The council was created on 1 April 2014 as part of the City of Westminster (Reorganisation of Community Governance) Order 2013. The first elections took place on 22 May 2014 and then every four years to coincide with the Westminster City Council elections.\nChair of the council\nThe council elects a chair at its annual meeting in May of each year.
