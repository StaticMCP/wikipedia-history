Other units were reinforcements which gradually arrived from Hunan, Guangdong, and Sichuan.\n2. On 18 December the Chinese launched a successful counter-offensive against the Japanese in the Guangxi Province.  To support the Chinese Guangxi-offensive and direct the air-units the more experienced 1st ARC (Colonel Chang Ting-Meng) temporarily replaced the 2nd ARC (Colonel Xing Zhanfei) at Liuzhou, with the 2nd ARC moving to rear positions at Guilin.\nTaking part in the offensive were 115 aircraft of the 3rd, 4th and 5th PGs, 6th BG, 18th PS and one of the Soviet groups.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Cheung, Raymond.
