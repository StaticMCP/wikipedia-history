An estimated population of 2700 birds was reported in 2009 on Saipan, and on Alamagan 950 birds were reported in 2010. It inhabits wetlands, thickets and the margins of forests.\nDescription\nThe Saipan reed warbler is approximately  long, and is greyish olive-brown above with a pale-yellow underside. The female is slightly smaller than the male. Both sexes have a long bill compared to other reed warbler species.\nConservation\nThreats to the survival of the Saipan reed warbler include habitat destruction resulting from urban development and agriculture, the introduction of invasive species, and volcanic eruptions.\nReferences"
