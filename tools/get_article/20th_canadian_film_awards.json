The ceremony was hosted by broadcaster Bill Walker and actress Louise Marleau.\nJust before the awards' 20th anniversary, its sponsors, the Canadian Association of Adult Education, the Canadian Foundation and the Canadian Film Institute, terminated their connection with the awards. Members of the Association of Motion Picture Producers and Laboratories in Canada, the Canadian Society of Cinematographers and the Directors Guild of Canada formed a group to organize a competition for 1968. This  group was independently incorporated as the Canadian Film Awards; its executive was members of industry associations, guilds and unions. Not represented was the Quebec Association of Independent Filmmakers which declined due to its objection to competition among filmmakers.\nThe awards categories were restructured, and craft categories and new special awards were introduced. For the first time, awards were presented to actors and actresses; and it was the last year in which awards were presented for amateur films. A statue was commissioned from sculptor Sorel Etrog, public screenings were instituted, and the selection process was revamped, with nomination committees pre-selecting entries for consideration by a five-member international jury. For this year, 181 films were entered, and the committees nominated 50 for final consideration. But the jury ignored committee recommendations for Best Cinematography and Best Direction and made its own choices. As a result, the voting process was changed for 1969.\nWinners\nFilms\n*Film of the Year: A Place to Stand - TDF Productions, Christopher Chapman and David MacKay producers, Christopher Chapman director\n*Feature Film: The Ernie Game - National Film Board of Canada, Gordon Burwash producer, Don Owen director\n*Film Under 30 Minutes: 'Ça n'est pas le temps des romans' (This Is No Time for Romance) - National Film Board of Canada, Fernand Dansereau director\n*Film Over 30 Minutes: Do Not Fold, Staple, Spindle or Mutilate - National Film Board of Canada, John Howe director\n*Documentary Under 30 Minutes: Avec tambours et trompettes (With Drums and Trumpets) - National Film Board of Canada, Robert Forget producer, Marcel Carrière director\n*Documentary Over 30 Minutes: Never a Backward Step - National Film Board of Canada, Guy Glover producer, Donald Brittain, Arthur Hammond and John Spotton directors\n*Animated: Not awarded\n::Honorable Mention: A Child in His Country (Un enfant...
