They reached Kotputli on January 15,  where he met Malhar Rao Holkar and voluntarily handed him the command of the Maratha army on 24 January, Holkar ordered the Marathas to return to Delhi and engage the invading Afghans until the arrival of reinforcements. A Maratha contingent was defeated by Jahan Khan near Rewari on 11 February.\nBattle\nThe Maratha troops led by Holkar sighted the Afghans in the vicinity of Bahadurgarh and forced the Afghans to retreat to Delhi. Upon learning of their approach, Holkar bypassed the city and entered Ganga Doab by crossing the Yamuna river. On the night of 26–27 February, he learned that the Afghans had entered Delhi two days earlier. He sacked the town of Sikandrabad on March 1, Holkar spent 3–4 days attempting to find a ford to cross the Ganga river into Rohilkhand for loot and plunder. However, while retreating to Delhi, Abdali was kept informed of the Marathas' march. The advance guard of the Marathas was caught and annihilated. The defeat panicked Holkar into a retreat towards Agra.\nAftermath\nWith Holkar's defeat, the victorious Afghans marched to Aligarh and encamped there, in order to prepare for another fresh Maratha army coming from Deccan as advised by Najib ad-Dawlah. The Marathas captured Delhi on August 1, which led to the Third Battle of Panipat.\nReferences\nSources\n*  |title=Advanced Study in the History of Modern India 1707-1813 |date=2005-01-01 |publisher=Sterling Publishers Pvt.
