Former president Abdirahman Tuur then declared that he had renounced the idea of independence for Somaliland, and expressed his desire to reunite it with the rest of Somalia.\nPresident Egal then declared war on the rebel troops which he labelled them Red Flags''' or the Young Boys causing a 3 year civil war that lasted until 1997.\nBackground\nAfter Somaliland declared Independence on 18 May 1991, conflict immediately rose between the SNM. Initially, the conflict was ignited by dissatisfaction with the first president of Somaliland, Abdirahman Ahmed Ali Tuur, who was perceived as giving his own clan power and neglecting other, mostly opposed by the Habar Awal, Habar je'lo who are apart of the wider Isaaq family, and the Gadabursi who are apart of the wider Dir family.\nA brief conflict ensued between 1992-1993 in Berbera which was settled by the 1993 Borama Conference, where Mohamed Haji Ibrahim Egal was elected president.\nHowever, in 1993, unhappy with the Habar Awal gaining of power, a group of Garhajis armed men of the Eidagalle which is in turn a part of the greater Isaaq clan seized Hargeisa Airport, demanding extortionate landing fees from aid aircraft and passengers and pocketing the money under the pretext that 'Hargeisa belongs to the Eidagalle'. President Egal had asked them to return control of the airport to the government but to no avail. Unable to stop the rebels from returning the airport and trying to avoid conflict, he had started building a small airstrip 35 km from the capital and asking aid flights to use it instead of the 'National Airport'. And in late September, he threatened armed action and the climate became very tense.\nThe situation went from bad to worse when in April 1993, with the support of UNOSOM II, the former president Abdirahman Tuur declared from his self-imposed exile in London that he was still head of the Somali National Movement, and that he had renounced the idea of independence for Somaliland. A UNOSOM 'grant' of US$ 200,000 and a promise of help from General Mohamed Farah Aidid have greatly helped him change his mind.\nCourse of the war\n1994\nUpon his declaration that Tuur was no longer interested in secession, he and other factional leaders began a meeting with General Aydeed, the former arch-enemy of UNOSOM. Aydeed understood that the United Nations still believed in the possibility of bringing together some kind of a 'national government' as a face-saving device before withdrawing. In an effort to reposition himself in the good graces of the UN, General Aydeed developed a scheme of 'resurrecting' Tuur and using him to appear as a 'national' leader in the eyes of the UN, one who would oppose the secession of Somaliland, which he had previously accepted. This was designed to take the wind out of the sails of his political rival, 'President' Ali Mahdi, before the departure of UNOSOM forces, since both were competing, first for the material leftovers of the international operation and later for the continuing political support of the international community.\nEsclations and Battle for the Hargeisa Airport\nUNOSOM support for Abdirahman Ahmed Ali Tuur led to the expulsion of all UN personnel from Somaliland in late August 1994. A few days later, on 30 August 1994, the former Somaliland president arrived in Mogadishu, where he met with Mohamed Farah Abdullahi, leader of the anti-SNM branch of SDA, and Abd-er-Rahman Dualeh Ali, the USF President. The meeting was sponsored by General Mohamed Farah Aydeed and the SNA, and it marked a clear declaration of war against the Egal government.\nIn these circumstances, President Egal could no longer tolerate the occupation of Hargeisa Airport by the Eidagalley militia, even though they were not under the orders of former President Abdirahman Tuur, he still believed they were linked. On 16 October 1994, Somaliland government troops stormed the airport, thus starting a new war. The conflict began poorly for the government side. By mid-October, government armed forces launched an operation. The Eidagale militia attempted to defend themselves using small arms and by blocking the road to Berbera. However, government forces swiftly overpowered them, forcing the militia to retreat into the mountains. Reports indicated that the clash between the government and the 300-500 strong militia resulted in approximately a dozen casualties, including both dead and wounded.\nAlthough the skirmish was relatively minor and primarily aimed at dismantling freelance bandit groups, the fallout from the incident proved to be more serious and complex than initially anticipated. The Eidagale militia, while routed, was not completely defeated.\nBy November 1994, fighting resumed in Hargeisa. The airport militia, having regrouped approximately fifty kilometers outside the city near the Ethiopian border, launched incursions into neighboring areas. The government responded by attacking the militia's camp near the village of Toon, capturing their ordnance, artillery, and two trucks. The fleeing militiamen were pursued by government forces until they reached Hargeisa. According to official reports, they attempted to rob a bank and opened fire on a busy market crowd. A firefight ensued between government forces and the militia, resulting in several dozen civilian casualties, predominantly from the Habar Awal, who were the main occupants of the market.\nFollowing the attack, the militia retreated to the predominantly Eidagale-populated Dumbuluq area in southeastern Hargeisa, using it as a base for further operations. As clashes persisted, Hargeisa endured repeated shelling from the airport area during the final two weeks of November 1994. While government forces—including irregular clan forces loyal to Egal—continued to pursue the militia, the latter reportedly received some support from local Hargeisa communities.\nThe conflict gradually escalated. The government military consisted of a multi-clan regular Somaliland National Army unit of approximately 500 men, reinforced by former Somali National Movement (SNM) militia units. These reinforcements primarily came from the Habar Awal/Saad Muse, the wealthiest segment of the Hargeisa population and the financial backbone of the Egal administration.\nConversely, the Eidagale militia was joined by their kinsmen from the Somaliland National Army and the police, many of whom defected after refusing to fight fellow Eidagale at the Battle of Toon. Additionally, certain members of the Habar Yunis subclan, closely related to the Eidagale militia, aligned with them, raising concerns that broader Garhajis clans might become involved in the war. Both the Habar Awal and the Garhajis leadership began mobilizing manpower and resources in anticipation of an all-out war. Egal, despite appealing for calm, struggled to maintain control over the Habar Awal clan militia, as several Habar Awal ex-SNM colonels voluntarily returned to active service, further escalating tensions.\nAccording to Reuters, a confrontation erupted between the Habar Awal militias loyal to the self-declared republic's president, Mohamed Ibrahim Egal, and the Habar Yunis fighters of his political rival, Abdirahman Tuur. Egal promptly responded via Radio Hargeisa, asserting that the violence was not inter-clan fighting but rather an orchestrated effort to render the country ungovernable, akin to the chaos under Aideed’s regime in Somalia.\nAn incident that initially began as a confrontation between the government and rogue bandit groups soon escalated into a highly politicized issue, compounded by significant clan dynamics. Public opinion, previously detached, became increasingly polarized as both sides shifted from a passive perception of events to a subjective and emotive interpretation of developments. On 21 October, rebel troops entered Hargeisa town and began indiscriminate shelling. The Central Bank was looted, and thousands of refugees streamed out of the city, where violent fighting raged until early December. As the battle gradually spread to the countryside around Hargeisa, refugees fled all the way to Ethiopia, where about 80,000 had arrived by Christmas of 1994. Fighting finally began to slowly abate in January 1995.\nReferences"
