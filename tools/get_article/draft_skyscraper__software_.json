The first release of Skyscraper was released on December 27, 2002. A 1.0 stable release was released in mid-2004, followed by a gradual complete redesign and rewrite in C++ using the Crystal Space simulation engine with wxWidgets for the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) control panel.  The first release of the rewritten simulator (version 1.1, released as 2.0 Alpha 1) was released on January 6, 2009. Skyscraper's latest stable release, version 1.11 (released as \"2.0 Alpha 11\") was released on April 13, 2023. The last version to use the Crystal Space engine was the September 19, 2012 build. Beginning with the July 28 2024 build, the simulator is now in the 2.0 Beta stage. As of the most recent build (November 27, 2024), the Mac version of the simulator is now signed by Apple. There is also a new menu screen since the 2.0 Beta release.\nFeatures\n*Users can manually hand-design buildings by scripting with corresponding coordination for every objects, or use a tool called \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20210810145654/https://beno.uk/askyscrapersim/creator/ Beno Building Creator]\" made by Beno with HTML5 Canvas element to make them.\n*Fully functioning elevators\n*Escalators, using fan-made scripts, most notably \"Escalator2011\"\n*Stairs\n*Moving walkways, using fan-made scripts, most notably \"GooperWalk2012\"\n*Destination dispatch elevators\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n** [https://forum.skyscrapersim.net Forum]\n** [https://wiki.skyscrapersim.net Wiki]\n*\n:Category:Free simulation software\n:Category:Software that uses wxWidgets\n:Category:Free software programmed in C++\nde:Skyscraper (Software)\nzh:模擬摩天樓"
