      "text": "# Later Three Kingdoms\n\nThe Later Three Kingdoms period (; c. 890s – 936 AD) of ancient Korea was a partial revival of the old three kingdoms from 1st century BC to the 7th century.\nDates\nThe start and end dates of the Later Three Kingdoms are poorly defined and differ across sources. Key events used as starting dates include the first major rebellions against Unified Silla (889), the capture of Gwangju by Kyŏn Hwŏn and subsequent establishment of the Later Baekje state at Jeonju (892), and the proclamation of Later Baekje as a kingdom by Kyŏn Hwŏn (900). Two events mark the end of the Later Three Kingdoms: the surrender of Gyeongsun, the last Silla monarch, to Goryeo in 935 and the conquest of Later Baekje by Goryeo in 936.\nSee also\n*List of monarchs of Korea\n*Taejo of Goryeo\n*Taejo Wang Geon (TV series)\n*Tomb of King Wanggon\n*Family tree of the Goryeo kings\n*Silla monarchs family tree\nNotes\nMost of this article has been copied from here: https://www.worldhistory.org/Later_Three_Kingdoms_Period/\nReferences\nMost of this article has been copied from here: https://www.worldhistory.org/Later_Three_Kingdoms_Period/\n* }}\n* }}"
