He probably reigned sometime in the first Paleo-Elamite period (). Additionally; he could have possibly been the same first king from Awan said on the Sumerian King List (SKL) to exercise the kingship over all of Sumer. According to the SKL: he was preceded by Balulu of Ur and succeeded by Kur-Ishshak. However, the Susanian Dynastic List states that he was succeeded by Tata.\nSee also\n*Mesopotamia\n*Ancient Near East\nReferences\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nJournals\n*\nWeb resources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nLanguage\n*\n*\n*\n}}}}\n|-\n}}}}\n|-\n}}}}"
