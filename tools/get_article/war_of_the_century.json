It not only examines the war but also the terror inside the Soviet Union at the time due to the paranoia of Joseph Stalin—the revenge atrocities, the Great Purge of army officers, the near-lunatic orders, and the paranoia of being upstaged by others, especially Marshal Zhukov.  The historical adviser is Ian Kershaw.\nMedia information\nDVD release\nThe film was released on Region 2 DVD by BBC Video as part of the BBC World War II DVD Collection.\nCompanion book\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
