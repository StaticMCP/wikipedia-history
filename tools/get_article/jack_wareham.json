He did not play a first-team game for the \"Potters\" and instead moved on to local rivals Port Vale in August 1924. After making his debut in a 4–1 defeat to Blackpool at Bloomfield Road on 22 April 1925, he played in the 4–0 defeat to Manchester United at Old Trafford three days later. These were his only Second Division appearances for the \"Valiants\", and he was released at the end of the season, at which point he signed with Crewe Alexandra of the Third Division North. He later played non-League football for Winsford United and Stafford Rangers.\nCareer statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|Port Vale\n|1924–25\n|Second Division\n|2||0||0||0||2||0\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Crewe Alexandra\n|1925–26\n|Third Division North\n|14||2||0||0||14||2\n|-\n|1926–27\n|Third Division North\n|13||2||0||0||13||2\n|-\n|1927–28\n|Third Division North\n|6||0||3||1||9||1\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!33!!4!!3!!1!!36!!5\n|}\nReferences"
