Incumbent president Adama Barrow is running for a third term.\nElectoral system\nThe President of the Gambia is elected in a single round by first-past-the-post voting for a five-year term. Registered voters receive a voter's card which must be presented at the assigned polling station. After verifying eligibility, a polling officer marks the voter's left forefinger with indelible ink.\nInstead of using paper ballots, elections in the Gambia are conducted using marbles. Each voter receives a marble and places it in a tube on top of a sealed drum that corresponds to that voter's favoured candidate. The drums for different candidates are painted in different colours corresponding to the party affiliation of the candidate, and a picture of the candidate is affixed to their corresponding drum. The drums are placed in the booth concealed from the officials to preserve ballot secrecy; the insertion of a marble rings a bell inside to signal that the vote has been cast. As a precaution against COVID-19,  sanitizer was provided at the entrances and exits of the booth at the 2021 election.\nDuring the tallying process, a candidate's drum is unsealed and its contents emptied in batches on hole boards with a capacity of 200 to 500 marbles each. Once the tellers agree on the number of marbles, the drum is refilled and retained for use in a recount, and the tellers pass to the next candidate's urn. This process, repeated in each polling station, is very fast; the results are generally known at the national level the day after the vote.\nThe system has the advantages of low cost and simplicity, both for understanding how to vote and for counting the results. The method is reported to have an extremely low error rate for miscast ballots.\nBackground\nThe 2020 draft constitution that failed to be ratified was widely regarded as a step toward democratic accountability and included provisions such as a two-term presidential limit, a clause that became a point of contention due to Barrow’s eligibility to seek re-election under the current constitution. Ousainou Darboe, leader of the United Democratic Party (UDP), has consistently accused Barrow of obstructing the process to extend his hold on power, a claim the president's supporters reject.\nCandidates\nDeclared\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Name\n!\n!Party\n!Position\n!Ref\n|-\n|Adama Barrow\n|\n|President of the Gambia (since 2017)\n|\n|-\n|Ousainou Darboe\n|\n|Vice President of the Gambia (2018–2019)\n|\n|-\n|Bakary K.
