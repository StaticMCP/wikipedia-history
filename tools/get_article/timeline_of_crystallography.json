This was the original statement of the first law of crystallography (Steno's law).\n18th century\n* 1723&nbsp;- Moritz Anton Cappeller introduced the term crystallography in his book Prodromus Crystallographiae De Crystallis Improprie Sic Dictis Commentarium.\n* 1766&nbsp;- Pierre-Joseph Macquer, in his Dictionnaire de Chymie, promoted mechanisms of crystallization based on the idea that crystals are composed of polyhedral molecules (primitive integrantes).\n* 1772&nbsp;- Jean-Baptiste L. Romé de l'Isle developed geometrical ideas on crystal structure in his Essai de Cristallographie. He also described the twinning phenomenon in crystals.\n* 1781&nbsp;- Abbé René Just Haüy (often termed the \"Father of Modern Crystallography\") discovered that crystals always cleave along crystallographic planes. Based on this observation, and the fact that the inter-facial angles in each crystal species always have the same value, Haüy concluded that crystals must be periodic and composed of regularly arranged rows of tiny polyhedra (molécules intégrantes). This theory explained why all crystal planes are related by small rational numbers (the law of rational indices).\n* 1783&nbsp;- Jean-Baptiste L. Romé de l'Isle in the second edition of his Cristallographie used the contact goniometer to discover the law of constancy of interfacial angles: angles are constant and characteristic for crystals of the same chemical substance.\n* 1784&nbsp;- René Just Haüy published his law of decrements: a crystal is composed of molecules arranged periodically in three dimensions.\n* 1795&nbsp;- René Just Haüy lectured on his law of symmetry: \"the manner in which Nature creates crystals is always obeying&nbsp;... the law of the greatest possible symmetry, in the sense that oppositely situated but corresponding parts are always equal in number, arrangement, and form of their faces\".\n19th century\n* 1801&nbsp;- René Just Haüy published his multi-volume Traité de Minéralogie in Paris.

Yonath shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry \"for studies of the structure and function of the ribosome.\"\n* 2009&nbsp;- Judith Howard and her collaborators created the Olex2 crystallographic software package.\n* 2011&nbsp;- Gustaaf Van Tendeloo led a team including Sandra Van Aert, Kees Joost Batenburg et. al. determined the 3D atomic positions of a silver nanoparticle using electron tomography.\n* 2011&nbsp;- Dan Shechtman received the Nobel Prize in chemistry \"for the discovery of quasicrystals.\"\n* 2011&nbsp;- Henry N. Chapman, Petra Fromme, John C. H. Spence and 85 co-workers used femtosecond pulses from a Free-electron laser (XFEL) to examine the structure of nanocrystals of Photosystem I. By using very brief x-ray pulses, most radiation damage is mitigated using the technique called serial femtosecond crystallography.\n* 2012&nbsp;- Jianwei Miao and his co-workers applied the coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) method in Atomic Electron Tomography (AET).\n* 2013&nbsp;- Tamir Gonen and his co-workers demonstrated microcrystal electron diffraction (microED) for lysozyme microcrystals at the Janelia Farm Research Campus.\n* 2014&nbsp;- Carmelo Giacovazzo published Phasing in Crystallography: A Modern Perspective, a comprehensive opus on phasing methods in X-ray and electron crystallography.\n* 2014&nbsp;- The International Union of Crystallography and UNESCO named 2014 the International Year of Crystallography to commemorate the century of discovery since the invention of X-ray diffraction.\n* 2017&nbsp;- Lukas Palatinus and co-workers used dynamical structure refinement to resolve hydrogen atom positions in nanocrystals using electron diffraction.\n* 2017&nbsp;- Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson shared the Nobel Prize in chemistry \"for developing cryo-electron microscopy for the high-resolution structure determination of biomolecules in solution.\"\n* 2019&nbsp;- The Cambridge Structural Database reached the milestone of one million structures.\n* 2020&nbsp;- Two independent groups led respectively by Holger Stark and Sjors Scheres demonstrated that single-particle cryoelectron microscopy has reached atomic resolution.\n* 2021&nbsp;- Kenneth G. Libbrecht published the book Snow Crystals: A Case Study in Spontaneous Structure Formation, summarizing his decade-spanning work on the subject for engineering conditions for designer ice crystals.\n* 2022&nbsp;- Leonid Dubrovinsky, Igor A. Abrikosov, and Natalia Dubrovinskaia led a team that demonstrates high-pressure crystallography in the terapascal regime.\n* 2024&nbsp;- A team led by Anders Madsen developed a deep learning model, PhAI, to solve crystallographic phase problem for small molecules.\nSee also\n* History of crystallography before X-rays\n** Chemical\n** Geometrical\n** Physical\nReferences\nFurther reading\nCrystallography before 20th century\n*\n* Burke, John G.
