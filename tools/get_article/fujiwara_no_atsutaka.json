His real name may have been Tachibana no Atsutaka.\nLife\nFujiwara no Atsutaka was a son of the governor of Hizen Province, Fujiwara no Toshikiyo (藤原俊清). His year of birth is unknown, but the s entry for the 27th day of the seventh month of Hōan 1 (22 August 1120 in the Julian calendar) says that he was in his fifties when he died earlier that same month.\nThe Sonpi Bunmyaku does not mention a \"Fujiwara no Atsutaka\", but it includes a reference to \"Mokunosuke Atsutaka\" (木工助敦隆), son of \"Tachibana no Toshikiyo\" (橘俊清). Atsutaka's court position was Mokunosuke (assistant director of the Mokuryō 木工寮), and his father's name was the same, so it is believed that these two were the same individual.}}\nThe Chūyūki records that he was assigned to the Mokunosuke post in Eichō 1 (1096). He appears to have held this position until his death.\nAccording to the Chūyūki, Atsutaka died on the first day of the seventh month of Hōan 1 (27 July 1120).\nDescendants\nHis daughter married Minamoto no Toshiyori, and from this union was born Shun'e.\nPoetry\nHe participated in the Sanka Goban Uta-awase (山家五番歌合) in Tennin 3 (1110). Counting both \"Tachibana no Atsutaka\" and \"Fujiwara no Atsutaka\", his name appears in the surviving records of four uta-awase contests from this period. None of his poems, however, were included in any of the court anthologies.\nHe was also noted for his scholarship, and compiled the 20-volume Ruiju Koshū (類聚古集), a thematically arranged  collection of ''Man'yōshū'' poems. Sixteen volumes of the work are extant.\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n}}"
