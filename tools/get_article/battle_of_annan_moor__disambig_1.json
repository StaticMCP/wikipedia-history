The battle took place on 20 and 21 October 1645 when the experienced cavalry commander Sir John Brown of Fordell and his newly raised Scots cavalry regiment defeated the Royalists army. The Royalists lost more than half of their 600 men as casualties or prisoners. The remainder of the Royalist were driven back into England.\nReferences\n* Brown, C, Scottish Battlefields, Gloucestershire, 2008.\nSources\n* Furgol, E., A Regimental History of the Covenanting armies (John Donald, 1990)."
