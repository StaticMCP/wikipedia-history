It won three awards at the 2009 Pula Film Festival.\nPlot\nSaša Mihelčić is a journalist and a failed writer in his early thirties. He scrapes a living by writing a newspaper column on gastronomy, inherited from his father, a journalism legend. His listless existence is changed when he meets Ines, a former volleyball player who works as a masseuse in his gym. They begin a romantic relationship, and - wanting to show himself as a man of character for once - he writes a scathing review of a restaurant owned by Braco, a politically influential investor. This lands Saša in serious trouble, forcing him to face and overcome the weaker points of his character...\nCast\n* Nenad Cvetko - Saša\n* Dijana Vidušin - Ines\n* Siniša Popović - Mladen\n* Jan Budař - Honza\n* Filip Šovagović - Filip\n* Zoran Čubrilo - Braco\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://www.tportal.hr/kultura/clanak/ljubavni-zivot-domobrana-i-metastaze-za-kraj-pule-20090725 'Ljubavni život domobrana' i 'Metastaze' za kraj Pule]\n*[https://arhiva.nacional.hr/clanak/63682/nista-novo-u-puli Ništa novo u Puli]"
