This was on the same day as other local elections and had been postponed from May 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe composition of the council before the election was as follows:\n{| style=\"width:60%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ ↓\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:; width:57.4%;\" | 31\n| style=\"background:; width:27.7%;\" | 15\n| style=\"background:; width:7.4%;\" | 4\n| style=\"background:; width:5.5%;\" | 3\n|-\n| }}\n| }}\n| }}\n| }}\n|}\nThere was one vacancy.\nAfter the election, the composition of the council became:\n{| style=\"width:60%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ ↓\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:; width:57.4%;\" | 31\n| style=\"background:; width:33.3%;\" | 18\n| style=\"background:; width:5.6%;\" | 3\n| style=\"background:; width:3.7%;\" | 2\n|-\n| }}\n| }}\n| }}\n| }}\n|}\nElection result\nThe Conservatives retained control of the council and gained one seat from Labour. They regained a seat from an Independent who had originally been elected as a Conservative, and also regained a vacant seat, which had been won by a Conservative in 2016, who joined the Liberal Democrats in 2017, and had resigned from the Council in 2020. The Liberal Democrats gained three seats from the Conservatives.\nTotal Election result\n2\n|seats %       = 66.7\n|other seats   = 19\n|total seats   = 31\n|total seats % = 57.4\n|votes         = 21,540\n|votes %       = 46.4\n|plus/minus    =  9.1\n}}\n3\n|seats %       = 33.3\n|other seats   = 12\n|total seats   = 18\n|total seats % = 33.3\n|votes         = 16,492\n|votes %       = 35.5\n|plus/minus    =  3.9\n}}\n1\n|seats %       = 0.0\n|other seats   = 3\n|total seats   = 3\n|total seats % = 5.6\n|votes         = 7,439\n|votes %       = 16.0\n|plus/minus    =  0.4\n}}\n|seats %       = 0.0\n|other seats   = 2\n|total seats   = 2\n|total seats % = 3.7\n|votes         = 0\n|votes %       = 0.0\n|plus/minus    =  5.4\n}}\n|seats %       = 0.0\n|other seats   = 0\n|total seats   = 0\n|total seats % = 0.0\n|votes         = 695\n|votes %       = 1.5\n|plus/minus    =  0.9\n}}\n|seats %       = 0.0\n|other seats   = 0\n|total seats   = 0\n|total seats % = 0.0\n|votes         = 175\n|votes %       = 0.4\n|plus/minus    =  0.1\n}}\n|seats %       = 0.0\n|other seats   = 0\n|total seats   = 0\n|total seats % = 0.0\n|votes         = 114\n|votes %       = 0.2\n|plus/minus    = New\n}}\nA total of 46,771 votes were cast for 62 candidates.
