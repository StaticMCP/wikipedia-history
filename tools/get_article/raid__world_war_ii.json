The game was developed by Lion Game Lion and was published by Starbreeze Studios for Microsoft Windows.\nSynopsis\nDuring World War II, the Nazis are on the verge of winning the war in Europe. Four prisoners of war – Sterling, Rivet, Kurgan and Wolfgang have been freed by \"Mrs. White\", a British Intelligence Operative, who needs someone to take down Hitler and Nazi Germany. Their objective is to fight the war without rules or mercy. Their reward is all the Nazi gold they can carry.\nDevelopment\nRAID: World War II was developed by Lion Game Lion, a Croatian Starbreeze partner studio, that has developed downloadable content for Payday 2. The team chose to work with Diesel, an engine made by Overkill Software (ex-Grin Studios), because they have an extensive experience on working with the engine. The game has a budget of US$8 million, financed by Starbreeze Studios.\nReception\nOn Metacritic, it has an aggregate score of 53% on PC, 46% on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
