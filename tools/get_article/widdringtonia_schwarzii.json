It is threatened by habitat loss, particularly by wildfire. The Willowmore cypress is a protected tree in South Africa.\nIt is a medium-sized evergreen tree growing to 20–25 m (formerly known to 40 m) tall. The leaves are scale-like, 1.5&nbsp;mm long and 1&nbsp;mm broad on small shoots, up to 10&nbsp;mm long on strong-growing shoots, and arranged in opposite decussate pairs. The cones are globose to rectangular, 2–3&nbsp;cm long, with four scales. It is closely related to Widdringtonia wallichii from Western Cape Province, being most easily distinguished by its larger seeds with a short seedwing.\nReferences\n;Notes\n;Sources\n*"
