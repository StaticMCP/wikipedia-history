The category was established at the 1st Children's and Family Emmy Awards in 2022, and is a sister category to the Children's and Family Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's or Young Teen Animated Series, which honors shows aimed at older audiences.\nThe inaugural recipient of the award was Netflix series Ada Twist, Scientist. The current holder of the award is the Nickelodeon series The Tiny Chef Show, which won at the 3rd Children's and Family Emmy Awards.\nBackground\nOn November 17, 2021, the NATAS announced the creation of the Children's and Family Emmy Awards to recognize the best in children's and family television. The organization cited an \"explosive growth in the quantity and quality of children’s and family programming\" as justification for a dedicated ceremony. Many categories of the awards were previously presented at the Daytime Emmy Awards. Animated programming aimed towards preschool children was honored from 2013 to 2022 with the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Pre-School Children's Animated Program. Following the establishment of the Children's and Family Emmy Awards, this award was discontinued.\nWinners and nominations\n2020s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"10%\" | Series\n! width=\"30%\" | Producers\n! width=\"5%\" | Network\n! width=\"3%\" | Ref\n|-\n| rowspan=6 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2022(1st)\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n|Ada Twist, Scientist: Seasons 1-2\n| Andrea Beaty, Mark Burton, Tonia Davis, Cathal Gaffney, Chris Nee, Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, Darragh O’Connell, David Roberts, Priya Swaminathan (executive producers); Kerri Grant (co-executive producer); Gillian Higgins (supervising producer); Nayanshi Shaw, Peedee Shindell (producers); Jean Herlihy (consulting producer)\n| Netflix\n| rowspan=6 style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n| Molly of Denali\n| Trevor Bentley, Dorothea Gillim (executive producers); Heather Renney (supervising producer); Anthony Bostler (coordinating producer); Yatibaey Evans, Princess Daazhraii Johnson (creative producers); Elizabeth Thorsen (producer); Courtenay Crane, Kassia O'Connor (line producers)\n| PBS\n|-\n| Octonauts: Above & Beyond\n| Andrew Hymas (executive producer); Adam Idelson, Kurt Mueller, Stephanie Simpson (co-executive producers); Lacey Stanton (supervising producer); Frank Rocco (creative director); Greg De Winter, Kim Dent Wilder, Michael Hefferon, Steve Jacobson, Rachel Simon (producers); Susane Belec (line producer)\n| Netflix\n|-\n| Santiago of the Seas\n| Tony Gama-Lobo, Niki López, Dave Palmer, Leslie Valdes, Valerie Walsh Valdes (executive producers); Michael Heinz (co-executive producer); Lauren Montgomery (supervising producer); Ian Murray (line producer)\n| Nickelodeon\n|-\n|Xavier Riddle and the Secret Museum\n| Vince Commisso, Christopher Eliopoulos, Brad Meltzer, Fonda Snyder, Blake Tohana, Rob Weisbach (executive producers); Jennifer Bradley, Nora Keely (supervising producers); Meredith Kenny (producer); Cory Bobiak (consulting producer)\n| PBS\n|-\n| rowspan=6 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2023(2nd)\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| StoryBots: Answer Time: Season 1\n| Gregg Spiridellis, Evan Spiridellis (executive producers); Jeff Gill, Nate Theis (supervising producers); Jason Wyatt (producer); Sunisa Petchpoo (line producer)\n| Netflix\n| rowspan=5 style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n| The Adventures of Paddington\n| Rosie Alison, Jon Foster, Ron Halpern, David Heyman, James Lamont, Anna Marsh, Lynsey O'Callaghan, Rob Silva (executive producers); Karen Davidsen, Simon Quinn (producers)\n| Nick Jr.\n|-\n| Spirit Rangers\n| Chris Nee, Karissa Valencia (executive producers); Marshell Becton, PeeDee Shindell (producers); Tra Nguyen, Charles Seignolle, Guillaume Villeneuve (line producers); Joey Clift, Kent Redeke (consulting producers)\n| Netflix\n|-\n| Star Wars: Young Jedi Adventures\n| Carmen Italia, Jacqui Lopez, Richard Marlis, Michael Olson, Josh Rimes, James Waugh (executive producers); Jeannine Hodson, Shea Wageman (producers); Brenda Dewet, Jennifer Rogan (line producers); Lamont Magee (consulting producer)\n| Disney+\n|-\n| The Tiny Chef Show\n| Ozlem “Ozi” Akturk, Kristen Bell, Phil Chalk, Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, Rachel Larsen, Adam Reid, Morgan Sackett, Stephanie Sperber (executive producers); Hannah Ferguson (line producer); Jonny Belt, Robert Scull (consulting producers)\n| Nickelodeon\n|-\n| rowspan=6 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2024(3rd)\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| The Tiny Chef Show\n|  '''Ozlem 'Ozi' Akturk, Kristen Bell, Alex Bulkley, Corey Campodonico, Leah Gotcsik, Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, Rachel Larsen, Adam Reid, Morgan Sackett (executive producers); Michael Kaufman (co-executive producer); Sara Crowley, Jason Wyatt (line producers)\n| Nickelodeon'\n| rowspan=5 style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n| Frog and Toad\n| Antonio Canobbio, Rob Hoegee, Ben Kalina, Adam Lobel, Adrianne Lobel, Chris Prynoski, Shannon Prynoski (executive producers); Jennifer Ray (supervising producer); Rachel Bepple, Sammy Rivkin (line producers)\n| rowspan=2| Apple TV+\n|-\n| Interrupting Chicken\n| Clint Eland, Ron Holsey, Loris Kramer Lunsford, David Ezra Stein (executive producers); Chantal Ling (producer); Sarah Laight (line producer)\n|-\n| Rosie's Rules\n| Vince Commisso, Mariana Díaz-Wionczek, PhD, Karen Fowler, Jennifer Hamburg, Wendy Harris, Natalie Osborne, Angela C.
