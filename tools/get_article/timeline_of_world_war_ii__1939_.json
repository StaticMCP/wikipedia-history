For events preceding September 1, 1939, see the timeline of events preceding World War II.\nGermany's invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 brought many countries into the war. This event, and the declaration of war by France and Britain two days later, mark the beginning of World War II. After the declaration of war, Western Europe saw minimal land and air warfare, leading to this time period being termed the \"Phoney War\". At sea, this time period saw the opening stages of the Battle of the Atlantic.\nIn eastern Europe, however, the agreement between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed on 23 August opened the way in September for the Soviet Union's invasion of eastern Poland, which was divided between the two  countries before the end of the month. The Soviet Union began a new military offensive by invading Finland at the end of November. France and Britain provided minimal physical support to Poland during the invasion.\nThe war in East Asia among the Republic of China and the Empire of Japan reached a stalemate, while increasing clashes between Japan and the Soviet Union ended when the two parties agreed in September on a ceasefire.\nSeptember\n.\n*1 September\n** The Republic of China and the Empire of Japan are involved in the early stages of the third year of armed conflict between them during the Second Sino-Japanese War. The war is in what will be known as the \"Second Period\", which begins after the fall of Wuhan in October 1938 and ends in December 1941 with Pearl Harbor. This conflict will eventually be swept up into World War II when Japan joins the Axis and China joins the Allies.\n** The invasion of Poland by Germany starts at 4:45 am when the Kriegsmarine's battleship Schleswig-Holstein opens fire on the Polish military transit depot at Westerplatte in the Free City of Danzig on the Baltic Sea, but the attack is repulsed.
