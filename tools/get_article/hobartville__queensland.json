In the , Hobartville had a population of 50 people.\nOn 22 November 2019, the Queensland Government decided to amalgamate the localities in the Barcaldine Region, resulting in five expanded localities based on the larger towns: Alpha, Aramac, Barcaldine, Jericho and Muttaburra. The northern and eastern parts of Hobartville were incorporated into Alpha, while the south-western part was incorporated into Jericho.\nGeography\nThe Central Western railway line and, to its immediate south, the Capricorn Highway form the southern boundary of the locality.\nThe Great Dividing Range passes through the south-west of the locality. Therefore most of the locality is within the North East Coast drainage basin. Therefore the creeks within the locality are tributaries eventually of the Burdekin River which empties into the Coral Sea at Rita Island in the Shire of Burdekin.\nThe principal land use is grazing on native vegetation.\nHistory\nThe origin of the locality name is unclear but it is likely to have been taken from the Hobartville pastoral run operated by Mr Holland in 1885.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Hobartville. The nearest primary schools are in neighbouring Jericho and Alpha. The nearest secondary school is in Alpha but only to Year 10. For Years 11 and 12 the nearest secondary schools are in Barcaldine and Emerald. Boarding schools and distance education might also be used.\nReferences"
