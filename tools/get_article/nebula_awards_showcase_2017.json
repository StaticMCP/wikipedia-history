As it should be, being the best of the best nominated for the awards.\" She discusses most of the pieces favorably, summing up with \"[t]he characters and cultures depicted are also wonderfully diverse, and that's still a new enough thing to see that it's exciting and fresh.\" Noting that \"[m]ost of this collection comes from women,\" she take the fact as a signal \"that the boy's club idea of scifi and fantasy may finally have cracked.\" She concludes \"[i]f this book doesn't make a reader want to go find the full novels and collections these stories and excerpts come from, maybe speculative fiction isn't for them, because this year's collection is top notch and compulsively readable.\"\nKristi Chadwick in the Library Journal writes \"[t]his collection will speak to anyone who has a passion for diverse, imaginative speculative fiction\" and \"the tales showcased here push the boundaries of sexuality, diversity, and genre, reflecting the ability of sf/fantasy always to surprise and reward.\"\nGlenn Dallas in the San Francisco Book Review describes the series \"hard to top\" as \"a home for outstanding short stories that show the incredible inventiveness that typifies science fiction,\" with the current volume representing \"one of the more accessible years for Nebula nominees,\" as it \"skewed more toward the emotional than the dry and scientific. ... [T]his is the breadth and depth of speculative fiction writ large: the crossroads of imagination, heart, and insight.\" He rates the book 4 stars out of 5.\nNotes"
