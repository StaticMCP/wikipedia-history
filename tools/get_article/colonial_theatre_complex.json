The Piscopo Block, which contains the main entrance to the theatre, is distinguished by a large marquee spelling out \"COLONIAL\" that is located on Main Street (New Hampshire Route 106). The complex was built in 1914, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2020.\n__NOTOC__\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Belknap County, New Hampshire\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://609mainstreet.org 609 Main Street] Colonial Theatre Block Redevelopment website"
