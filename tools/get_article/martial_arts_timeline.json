      "text": "# Martial arts timeline\n\nThis martial arts timeline is designed to help describe the history of the martial arts in a linear fashion.  Many of the articles for particular styles have discussions of their history.  This article is designed to help visualize the development of these arts, to help better understand the progression of the separate styles and illustrate where they interrelate.\nThe history of martial arts is challenging to document precisely, because of the lack of historical records, secretive nature of the teacher-student relationships and political circumstances during much of its history.  It is likely that many techniques were learned, forgotten, and re-learned during human history.\nBronze Age (3000 to 1000 BCE)\n* 20th century BCE – Murals were first in tomb 15 at Beni Hasan, depicting wrestling techniques, in present-day Egypt (in Africa).\n* 19th century BCE  - Celtic wrestling (which evolved into Cornish wrestling, Gouren, Collar-and-elbow wrestling, etc) was described as being part of the Tailteann Games which continued until the time of the Normans.\n* 18th century BCE – The newly created Babylonian Gilgamesh epic included the major hand-held weapons (sword, axe, bow and spear) used prior to the gunpowder era.\nIron Age and Antiquity (1000 BCE to CE 500)\n* 8th century BCE – Roughly the start of Greek Olympic Competition. Through the popularity of the Olympics, martial arts like pankration flourished.\n* 8th century BCE – Homer's newly createdIliad described many scenes of hand-to-hand combat in detail.\n* 6th century BCE – Ten styles of Śastravidyā were said to have been created in India at this time.\n* c.4th century BCE – Newly created Indian epic poetry and the Vedas gave the earliest written mention of South Asian martial arts.\n* 50 BCE – The earliest records of a Korean martial art, namely taekkyon, were created at this time and found in paintings in the Muyong-chong, a royal tomb from the Goguryeo dynasty.\n* CE 72 – The Colosseum opened in Rome, providing the public with the world's largest martial arts venue for over the next three hundred years.\n* CE 1st century – Buddhist texts of this time such as the Lotus Sutra mentioned a number of South Asian fighting arts, while the Khandhaka discouraged their practice.\n* CE 2nd century – P.Oxy. III 466, a Greek papyrus manuscript on wrestling, was written. It is the earliest known European martial arts manual.\n* CE 477 – The first abbot of Shaolin Monastery was Buddhabadra, an Indian Dhyana master who came to China in AD 464 to translate Buddhist texts to Chinese. The Shaolin Temple was built at the western base of the Chinese Songshan mountain range, at the orders of Emperor Xiaowen. Successive Chinese emperors authorized fighting monks to train in the temple.\nMiddle Ages (500 to 1500)\n* 550 – Indian monk Bodhidarma taught what will be called Chan Buddhism. While there is no evidence he was involved in the martial arts, folklore later linked him to the creation of qigong and Shaolin fist, as well as crediting him with introducing forms into silat. Chán and its Japanese offshoot Zen Buddhism were influential among martial artists.\n* c.700 – Kuvalaymala described non-keshatriya students learning martial arts from Hindu priests at gurukula or traditional educational institutions.\n* 728 – This was the date of the \"combat stele\" at the Shaolin Monastery.\n* 782 – At this time the Japanese Heian period began, and curved swords called tachi (large sword) appeared.
