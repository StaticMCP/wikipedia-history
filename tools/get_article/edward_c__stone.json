He was the project scientist of the Voyager program, which sent two spacecraft to the outer Solar System's giant planets and became the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space.\nStone led the Voyager mission for 50 years, from 1972 until his retirement in 2022, overseeing the spacecraft's encounters with Jupiter (1979), Saturn (1980–1981), Uranus (1986) and Neptune (1989). Under his leadership, the mission discovered active volcanism on Jupiter's moon Io, new moons and ring systems. The Voyagers continued beyond the planets to cross the heliopause and enter the interstellar medium, with Voyager 1 becoming the first spacecraft to leave the Solar System in 2012, followed by Voyager 2 in 2018. The Voyager mission became the longest-running NASA mission, with Stone being its face and advocate.\nAs JPL director, Stone oversaw the successful launches of Mars Pathfinder with the first Mars rover Sojourner, Mars Global Surveyor, Cassini–Huygens   and other missions during NASA's \"faster, better, cheaper\" era. Throughout his career, he served as principal investigator on nine NASA spacecraft missions, including SAMPEX, the Advanced Composition Explorer and scientific instruments on the Galileo and STEREO missions.\nStone's contributions to space science earned him the National Medal of Science (1991), the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal (2013), and the Shaw Prize in Astronomy (2019). He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1984 and served key roles in establishing major astronomical facilities, including overseeing the creation of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) during his tenure as chair of Caltech's Division of Physics, Mathematics and Astronomy, and supervising the construction of the W. M. Keck Observatory.\nEarly life and education\nEdward Carroll Stone Jr. was born in Knoxville, Iowa, on January 23, 1936, to Edward Carroll Stone Sr., a construction superintendent, and Ferne Elizabeth Stone. He was the eldest of two sons. Stone grew up in Burlington. While at school, he worked at a J.C. Penney department store, and was a member of the Burlington Municipal Band playing French horn.\nStone studied at Burlington Junior College in Iowa, and continued his education at the University of Chicago where he earned his M.S. (1959) and Ph.D. (1964) degrees in physics. Initially, he planned to study nuclear physics, but became interested in space physics after the launch of the Soviet Sputnik in 1957. Stone began astrophysics research in 1961, working on a cosmic-ray telescope carried by Discoverer 36 spy satellite. He worked on it under the cosmic rays researcher John A. Simpson's supervision. The experiment became his PhD thesis, titled Low energy cosmic-ray protons. While in Chicago, Stone also worked with Eugene Parker; he said later that \"Parker taught me how to reduce a problem to its nuts and bolts, to a picture.\"\nCaltech\nStone moved to Caltech to work on space physics with Rochus Eugen Vogt in 1964, and helped him to establish the Space Radiation Laboratory. He became a full faculty member in 1967. In 1976, Stone was named professor of physics, later the David Morrisroe Professor of Physics, and was chair of the Division of Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy from 1983 to 1988; during his tenure he oversaw the establishment of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). He had also served as director of the Caltech Space Radiation Laboratory, and as vice president for Astronomical Facilities. He was the vice-chair of the Thirty Meter Telescope Board of Directors. He also served on the board of the California Association for Research in Astronomy (CARA) for nearly 25 years, and oversaw the construction of the W. M. Keck Observatory. He was also a W. M. Keck Foundation director, and chaired the Keck Foundation's Science and Engineering Committee for 24 years.\nVoyager program\nIn 1964, Gary Flandro, a summer student at JPL, found out that the rare planetary alignment of the giant planets allows a mission he called \"the Grand Tour\". Such alignment occurs every 175 years; Flandro calculated that the best option was to launch spacecraft in 1977. Gravity assist maneuvers were already known, but according to Flandro he was the first to notice the opportunity to visit the giant planets. NASA was reluctant to finance the proposed mission of four spacecraft, but it eventually transformed into the Voyager program.\nIn 1972, Stone became the project scientist for the Voyager program that sent two space probes to the giant planets in the outer Solar System. He was invited for the position by Harris \"Bud\" Schurmeier, the mission's first project manager; according to Schurmeier, Stone was proposed as the project scientist by Rochus Vogt, who was involved into the Grand Tour mission planning from the start. Stone himself was reluctant at first: as a scientist, he didn't want to sacrifice a lot of time for administrative work.}} Stone was also the principal investigator for the Cosmic Ray Subsystem experiment on both Voyager spacecraft.\nStone supervised the work of 11 teams of about 200 scientists; he organized \"the clique-like teams\" and work groups for key points of interest, \"moons, rings, atmosphere and magnetosphere\". Stone had the final word on observation target selection, instrument usage, and the spacecraft trajectories. A NASA official who was present at the first Voyager meeting, observed that \"Stone knew more about every one of their instruments than the P.I.s themselves knew.\"\nStone also became a spokesman for Voyager, and became well known to the public in the 1980s, after he held dozens of press conferences announcing Voyagers' discoveries., search for \"The press conference was a keystone activity of the Project Scientist...\"}} According to the Voyager project manager Norman Haynes, Stone \"revolutionized the world of project science\".\nStone said that planetary encounters and the discovery of volcanism on Io were the most memorable events of the Voyager mission for him. He recounted the team's regular work process:\nStephen P. Synnott recounted how Stone let him name a moon of Jupiter that he discovered on Voyager photos in 1980, saying \"it looks like you've found yourself a moon\" after checking the calculations. Synnott chose Thebe from a list of names suggested by the IAU.\n| width  = 30%\n| align  = right\n}}\nStone was the main advocate of the Voyagers. After the last planetary encounter he was able to receive funding for an extended mission, the Voyager Interstellar Mission. The Voyagers became the only spacecraft that left Solar System into interstellar space.\nJamie Rankin became Stone's last PhD student. Her thesis was on the Voyagers' interstellar space data; she graduated in 2018 and became the Voyagers' deputy project scientist in 2022. Before Rankin, Stone refused to advise graduate students for about 25 years.\nThe Voyager mission visited all four giant planets and is the only spacecraft that visited Uranus and Neptune. It is NASA's longest-running spacecraft mission. In 2022, Stone retired after holding the role of the Voyager project scientist for 50 years.\nJPL\nThough Stone is better known as the Voyager's project scientist, he served as a principal investigator for multiple other missions. but don't list these missions. Stone himself said that \"[Before Voyager] My first space mission was in 1961 and I had flown instruments on missions in 1965, '67, '69, '72, and '73 – so I had lots of instruments in space, but they had all been on Earth-orbiters.\"}} He was the PI of the Cosmic Ray Experiment on Orbiting Geophysical Observatory-6 (OGO-6, 1969), the PI of the Electrons and Hydrogen and Helium Isotopes experiments on Interplanetary Monitoring Platform 7 (IMP-7, 1972) and IMP-8 (1973), was involved into the cancelled ASTROMAG (1980s), was the PI of two instruments of the cancelled International Solar Polar Mission (1981), the PI of a heavy-ion counter on the Galileo mission to Jupiter (1989), the PI of SAMPEX (1992), the PI for the Advanced Composition Explorer (1997), and co-investigator of STEREO mission's High Energy Telescope (HET) and Low Energy Telescope (LET) (both part of the In-situ Measurements of Particles and CME Transients (IMPACT) instrument package) (2006). Stone also \"oversaw the redesign of the cooling system\" on the Spitzer Space Telescope (2003), and was an investigator on the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun instrument on the Parker Solar Probe (2018).\nIn 1991, Ed Stone–a well-known, enthusiastic and respectable scientist–was made the JPL director. His directorship was during the difficult period of the 90s: with the Cold War and the Space Race between the US and the USSR finished, NASA saw dwindling budgets and introduced the so-called \"faster, better, cheaper\" approach, that encouraged smaller, cheaper missions built with the help of third-party contractors, efficiently \"commercializing\" the research lab and forcing it to work with industry. Cost-cutting had to be done by Stone, who tried to adapt a new management culture at JPL, while at the same time trying not to hurt science. The plans were to downsize the lab and fire around 30% of JPL personnel by the end of the decade; Stone and Caltech leadership even feared that JPL could be closed.\nThe \"faster, better, cheaper\" (FBC) approach was described as:\nJPL had little experience in small missions at the time: its \"flagship\" missions, like Voyager, Cassini, and Galileo, employed hundreds of people for decades. Cassini, for example, \"directly supported maybe 500 work-years, about 10 percent of total lab staff [and] provided close to 20 percent of the lab budget\". In order to comply with budget restrictions and save the mission, Cassini was downsized; to save $250 million, the scan platform had to be removed from the plans. Stone himself saw the \"faster-better-cheaper\" as a cultural change of the lab's engineering practices.\nStone also became a proponent of a management culture change at JPL, and installed Richard Laeser (former Voyager project manager) to apply total quality management (TQM) at all levels. Reorganization was required to meet NASA needs, and TQM \"emphasized customer service\", even though few people at JPL saw NASA as their customer. Many employees were against the new management practices.}}\nThe most successful, \"model\" example of an FBC mission was the Mars Pathfinder lander and the first Mars rover, the Sojourner. The mission cost around 200 million dollars and was widely reported in the press, appearing on the covers of Time and Newsweek. Other missions were less fortunate: in 1998–1999, six missions were launched; four of them failed, including two Mars orbiters. Both JPL (Stone) and the NASA administration (Daniel Goldin) acknowledged that they pushed too far with the FBC; no project manager of the failed missions was fired.\nAccording to Peter J. Westwick, as the director of JPL, Stone was a \"cautious revolutionary\". He retired in 2001; his successor, Charles Elachi, \"felt no need to change JPL's culture\".\nRetirement and death\nStone retired from Voyager in 2022, after holding the role for 50 years, but remained professor emeritus at Caltech. He died in Pasadena, California, on June 9, 2024, at the age of 88.\nPersonal life\nStone was a shy man, and worked 100-hour weeks at times. Alan C. Cummings, the Cosmic Ray Subsystem co-investigator, who worked with Stone for fifty years, described him as \"very calm ... the smartest guy I ever met. He was a multiplexer supreme.\" Stone was profiled in 1990 for The New York Times by Michael Norman:\n– lugging an ancient leather briefcase. He keeps to the shadows and side paths, terra incognita, a physicist so swept up in his daily occasions, so occupied by science, his life appears to turn on little else.\nAnd yet, for the public, Ed Stone has been a kind of Cicero on space. As chief scientist on Project Voyager, he has participated in some 60 public briefings and news conferences over the 13 years of the project.}}\nStone met Alice Wickliffe on a blind date at a comedy club and married her in 1962. She died in December 2023. They had two daughters, Susan and Janet. Stone was described as a \"shy man, sometimes diffident, often detached\"; his younger daughter compared him to Star Treks Mr. Spock. He had no close friends but \"shared a long professional kinship with several scientists\". He was a registered Democrat but not very interested in politics. Norman wrote that \"He has no interest in sports, no hobbies ... His main recreation is to read a daily newspaper. His favorite food is raisin pie. He is not a man of faith.\"\nThe Voyager mission became the longest NASA mission; Stone described it in 2012:\nHe appeared in The Farthest, a 2017 documentary on the Voyager program.\nAwards and honors\nIn 2002, JPL established the Edward Stone Award for Outstanding Research Publication, which is awarded annually to JPL employees in both science and engineering.\nIn 2012, a middle school was named in Stone's honor in Burlington, his hometown.\nIn 2013, Stone was awarded the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal, the highest NASA award for non-governmental employees. NASA arranged the award ceremony to be performed during The Colbert Report night show, with the award presented by Stephen Colbert dressed in a retrofuturistic spacesuit. Stone was unaware of the award when he came to the show. It was given \"for a lifetime of extraordinary scientific achievement and outstanding leadership of space science missions, and for his exemplary sharing of the exciting results with the public.\"\nIn 2019, Stone won the Shaw Prize in Astronomy, \"for his leadership in the Voyager project\". The award included $1.2 million; Stone endowed a summer student program with this money \"in return for the wonderful mission [Flandro] discovered\".\nIn 2023, the W. M. Keck Foundation endowed the Edward C. Stone Professorship at Caltech. Christopher Martin, director of Caltech Optical Observatories, became the first Stone Professor.\nIn 2024, the Edward Stone Voyager Exploration Trail was unveiled at the JPL campus to commemorate Stone and his \"penchant for walking\". The trail starts at JPL Mall and consists of two paths, made similar to Voyager 1 and 2 trajectories. The trail features 24 memorial plaques, designed to \"evoke the Golden Record\" commemorating the mission's and Ed Stone's personal milestones.\n\" to President George H.W.
