Ware has received accolades including seven Brit Awards nominations including one for Best New Artist and four for British Female Solo Artist and two Mercury Prize nominations.\nIn 2018, Ware began co-hosting Table Manners'' alongside her mother Lennie, a podcast about \"family, food and the art of a good old chit-chat\", available to online streaming platforms.\nEarly life\nWare was born at Queen Charlotte's Hospital in Hammersmith, London, on 15 October 1984. She was raised in Clapham, London. She is the daughter of Helena (née Keell, usually called Lennie), a social worker, and John Ware, a BBC Panorama reporter, who divorced when she was 10. She is the younger sister of English actress Hannah Ware. Her mother was supportive in her early musical career and Ware considers her to be \"her hero\", saying \"She brought up my sister, brother and me with so much love and fun and always told me I could do anything I want.\" Ware's mother is Jewish and she was raised in the faith.\nWare was educated at Alleyn's School, a co-educational independent school in Dulwich in South London, where she was a schoolmate of Florence Welch, Jack Peñate, and Felix White of the Maccabees. She then attended the University of Sussex, where she graduated with a degree in English literature. After her studies, Ware briefly worked as a journalist at The Jewish Chronicle, did sports journalism at The Daily Mirror and worked behind the scenes at TV company Love Productions. There, she was a colleague of Erika Leonard, otherwise known as E. L. James, the author of Fifty Shades of Grey.\nMusic career\n2009–2011: Career beginnings\nIn the years prior to releasing her first solo album, Ware did backing vocals at live shows for Jack Peñate (who took her on tour in the U.S.) and Man Like Me. Ware said she learned a lot during her time with Jack Peñate: \"Performing with him was really good training, because I got to learn all about how other people do it – I was able to perform live without the pressure of being a lead singer. It gave me a taste of what to expect, and it prepared me for what I'm doing now.\"\nOne of Peñate's bandmates, Tic, introduced Ware to SBTRKT; Ware and SBTRKT went on to collaborate on \"Nervous\" (2010). She consequently met Sampha, then known as SBTRKT's main collaborator. They created \"Valentine\" together, which was released on a special-edition, heart-shaped vinyl by Young Turks in 2011. \"Valentine\" was partly inspired by James Blake's song \"The Wilhelm Scream\" and based on their personal experiences in love. The music video for \"Valentine\" was directed by Marcus Söderlund. \"Nervous\", \"Valentine\" and an additional collaboration with DJ Joker (\"The Vision\") led Ware to a record deal with PMR Records. She also featured on Ceremonials, the 2011 album by Florence and the Machine in which her good friend Florence Welch is lead singer.\nOn 14 October 2011, Ware released her debut solo single, \"Strangest Feeling\", on limited 10\" purple vinyl. The song did not chart on the UK Singles Chart.\n2011–2013: Devotion\nOn 20 August 2012, Ware released her debut album, Devotion, which peaked at number five on the UK Albums Chart. The album's lead single, \"Running\", was released on 24 February 2012. \"110%\" was released as the album's second single on 13 April, peaking at number&nbsp;61 in the United Kingdom. \"Wildest Moments\" was released as the album's third single on 29 June, peaking at number&nbsp;46 in the United Kingdom. \"Night Light\" was released as the fourth single on 24 August.\nDevotion was announced as a nominee for the prestigious Mercury Prize that year.  Ware toured in the United Kingdom in the early part of March 2013, supported by Laura Mvula, starting with Cambridge, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham, Oxford, Bristol and ending in London. The United Kingdom tour was followed by a European tour in the second half of March 2013 and a US tour in April 2013. In the summer of 2013, Ware played many festivals all over the world, and at the end of 2013, Jessie went on tour in the United States again.\n2014–2018: Tough Love and Glasshouse\nWare's second album, Tough Love, was released on 6 October 2014. Ware began writing the album earlier that year. The album peaked at number nine on the UK Albums Chart, becoming her second top ten album. \"Tough Love\" was the first single to be taken from the album and released on 3 August 2014. \"Tough Love\" was compared to \"Prince at his minimalist '80's best\" by Pitchfork. \"Tough Love\" is produced together with BenZel, the production duo composed of London post-bass producer Two Inch Punch and mega-producer Benny Blanco who Ware previously worked with on the single \"If You Love Me\"; Benzel are also executive producers of the album. Ed Sheeran co-wrote the song \"Say You Love Me\".  Ware played the Wilderness Festival (7–10 August 2014); a pair of additional dates at Berlin Festival 2014 (6 July 2014) and Sopot Gulf of Art (26 July 2014) that year.\nWare contributed a song for Nicki Minaj's third studio album, The Pinkprint (2014), called \"The Crying Game\" in which Minaj alternates between \"devastating verses and pensive crooning\" whilst Ware adds \"haunting\" and \"soulful\" vocals to the chorus. Originally, Ware only received a songwriting credit, but she was then credited on updated versions of the album.  She also co-wrote the song \"New Man\" for Ed Sheeran's third album, ÷, and provided background vocals on it and two other songs.\nin February 2018]]\nIn October 2017, Ware returned to the stage after a two-year absence in anticipation of the release of her third studio album, Glasshouse.
