      "text": "# Somali Civil War (2009–present)__disambig_1\n\nThe Somali Civil War (2009–present) (; ) is the ongoing phase of the Somali Civil War which is concentrated in southern and central Somalia. It began in late January 2009 with the present conflict mainly between the forces of the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) assisted by African Union peacekeeping troops and al-Shabaab militants who pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda during 2012.\nDuring the insurgency that followed the 2006 Ethiopian invasion of Somalia, al-Shabaab rose to prominence and made major territorial gains. Several weeks before the end of the military occupation, Islamist insurgents had seized most of the south and Transitional Federal Government (TFG) was on the verge of collapse. In early 2009, Ethiopian troops withdrew from Somalia and former Islamic Courts Union leader Sharif Ahmed was elected president TFG, marking a new phase of the civil war. Al-Shabaab and allied Islamist groups continued fighting against the new TFG and the African Union mission (AMISOM) throughout 2009 and 2010, weakening the frail TFG further. By 2010, al-Shabaab reached its peak operational capacity as it absorbed other factions and began embracing drastic changes in the types of attacks they utilized. That year the group merged with Hizbul Islam and also carried out the Kampala bombings in response to Ugandan support for AMISOM.\nIn August 2011, al-Shabaab withdrew from Mogadishu and lost the significant control it had established in the city since the insurgency began in 2007. While the group continues to carry out operations in the capital, the 2011 withdrawal marked the end of a strong insurgent presence. The Kenyan invasion of southern Somalia aimed at al-Shabaab, Operation Linda Nchi, began in October 2011. Coinciding with Kenya's operation, the Ethiopian National Defence Force (ENDF) returned to Somalia in large numbers for the first time since their 2009 withdrawal. In 2012 the FGS was formed, and it was becoming increasingly clear that a military victory would not resolve the conflict, and during that same year al-Shabaab pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda. In 2014, ENDF troops in Somalia were formerly integrated into AMISOM.\nDespite the growing challenges, al-Shabaab still controls large swathes of territory in southern Somalia. It remains influential in many rural areas, and it now prioritizes guerrilla and terror attacks over territorial acquisitions. The Islamic State in Somalia (ISS) and Hizbul Islam have also carried out attacks against both factions. In 2013 Hizbul Islam renounced violence against the government, but as of 2023, ISS remains active in northern Somalia. In 2023, the Las Anod conflict broke out in the northern part of Somalia between SSC-Khatumo and the Somaliland Army.\nBackground\nEstablished in 2004, the internationally recognized Transitional Federal Government's (TFG) in Somalia was waning until the United States-backed 2006 invasion by the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF), which drove out the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) from power. Following this defeat, the ICU splintered into several different insurgent factions.\nEmergence of the insurgency\nIn early 2007, many Somalis rallied behind an insurgency which aimed to expel the Ethiopian military occupation in Mogadishu. The Ethiopians were caught off guard by the scale and intensity of the emerging resistance, responding with bombardments of urban areas. Thousands of Ethiopian troops and Somalis had been killed during fierce fighting for Mogadishu.ENDF military losses had reached unsustainable levels by the end of 2007. In 2008 insurgent pressure intensified in the capital and across south-central Somalia, particularly in the Shabeelle, Jubba Valley, Bay, and Bakool regions. Skirmishes with ENDF/TFG forces soon morphed into a sustained insurgent offensive.\nThe TFG and its Ethiopian backers had low public support. The government lacked legitimacy, capacity, and credibility, and refused to broaden its political base throughout 2007. Opposition figures were purged from parliament, leaving a narrow coalition that failed to advance any political transition or create institutions. The TFG was widely seen as corrupt, fractured and abusive. Al-Shabaab, former a youth militia under the ICU's military wing, emerged as an independent faction in early 2007. It gained significant combat experience and began governing territory for the first time in 2008. The Ethiopian invasion transformed the group from a fringe entity to a dominant insurgent force.\nBy 2008, most of the country had fallen under insurgent control, leaving the TFG on the brink of collapse. More than 80% of its police and army had deserted. The invasion failed to empower the TFG, which only controlled some parts of Mogadishu and its original 2006 capital of Baidoa by the end of 2008. The Ethiopian army withdrew with significant casualties and little to show for their efforts. The insurgency had achieved its primary goal of removing the Ethiopian military presence from most of Somalia by November 2008.\nEthiopian withdrawal and new TFG administration\nAs the Ethiopians withdrew from Somalia, tensions between the differing insurgent factions exacerbated. By this time most elements of the pre-invasion Islamic Courts had merged into one of the two wings of the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia (ARS) or had joined al-Shabaab, though some smaller factions continued operating independently under the ICU banner into 2009. A power-sharing deal was reached in Djibouti between the TFG and Sharif Sheikh Ahmed's ARS-D faction in late 2008. Al-Shabaab, which had broken away from the moderate Islamists, rejected the agreement and expanded its control, later joined by Hizbul Islam—a coalition of insurgent groups from the Ethiopian military occupation era, including the ARS-Asmara faction led by Hassan Dahir Aweys. Meanwhile, Ahlu Sunnah Waljama'ah, backed by Ethiopia and aligned with the TFG, fought and successfully repelled al-Shabaab advances in Galguduud.\nRather than eliminating jihadist activity in Somalia, the invasion significantly expanded it, with al-Shabaab's ranks growing from around 600 to several thousand fighters by the time of Ethiopia's 2009 withdrawal. Between 2004 and 2008, Ethiopia—then the TFG's main ally—trained thousands of Somali troops, but over 10,000 deserted or joined the insurgency. After Ethiopia's 2009 withdrawal, AMISOM assumed responsibility for rebuilding the army, which still lacked a functional chain of command.\nAfter parliament took in 275 officials from the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia, ARS leader Sheikh Ahmed was elected TFG President on 31 January 2009. Since then, the al-Shabaab radical Islamists have accused the new TFG President of accepting the secular transitional government and have continued the civil war since he arrived in Mogadishu at the presidential palace in early February 2009.\nTimeline\n2009–10: War begins\nAl-Shabaab also vowed to fight the government. On 4 February 2009, four Islamist groups, including Hassan Dahir Aweys' Eritrean branch of the ARS merged and created the group Hisbi Islam, to oppose the new government of Sharif Sheikh Ahmed. New TFG President Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed arrived in Mogadishu as a president for the first time on 7 February 2009. The al-Shabaab and other radical Islamists began firing at the new TFG president hours later. They accused the new President of accepting the secular transitional government.\nOn 8 February, heavy fighting broke out in southern Mogadishu. al-Shabaab leader Sheikh Mukhtar Robow (Abu Mansur) met with Sharif Ahmed for peace talks during his visit to Mogadishu, while Omar Iman rejected the president. During these negotiations, Sharif Ahmed said that he would be prepared to enforce Sharia Law in Somalia, which was the radical groups' main demand. However, Sheikh Mukhtar Robow, a former al-Shabaab spokesman, denied having talked to Sharif Ahmed and vowed to continue fighting until his demands for Sharia Law were met. Sheikh Mukhtar Robow warned Nigeria against sending peace keepers to Somalia, as al-Shabaab view the AU peace keepers as occupying forces. An offensive was launched two days later by al-Shabaab to take the Bakool province. Government officials who had been ousted from Baidoa had been amassing troops in the city of Hudur (Xudur) and planning a major offensive to re-take Baidoa. Islamist forces attacked the province and reached the capital where they started a battle against government forces. In Galmudug, Clan militia took the town of Masagaway from al-Shabaab, while there was also fighting in Warsheekh.\nThe spokesman for al-Shabaab at the time, Sheikh Mukhtar Robow (Abu Mansur), rebuffed reports from several media outlets that a mutual agreement between him and newly elected president Sharif Ahmed was made. In his 12 February statement, he also added that he had no intention to contact the president on any matters, and that they would continue fighting against foreign troops and what he described as an \"apostate\" government. Al-Shabaab also vowed war against the new government. On 22 February, a double suicide bomb attack on an AU base in Mogadishu left 11 Burundian soldiers dead and another 15 wounded. Two days later, heavy fighting erupted in the city as TFG and AU forces attempted to retake the city from radical Islamist forces. The fighting lasted for two days and killed 87 people, including: 48 civilians, 15 insurgents and 6 TFG policemen. At the same time as the fighting raged in Mogadishu, al-Shabaab forces took the town of Hudor, to the northwest, in fighting that killed another 20 people: ten TFG soldiers, six insurgents and four civilians. On 28 February, it appeared that Hisbi Islam would sign a ceasefire with the Transitional Federal Government. However, by 1 March, it was clear that no ceasefire would be given, despite President Sharif Ahmed having agreed to proposals for a truce and having offered to accept the implementation of Sharia law but refused to move troops from civilian areas despite the Islamists doing so. al-Shabaab announced on 6 May that it would continue the war even if AMISOM withdrew. The Somali government, in turn, later announced an immediate blockade on airstrips and seaports under insurgent control to stop the flow of weapons reaching them.\nBattle of Mogadishu and central Somalia\nOn 7 May, a fierce battle for control of Mogadishu started between al-Shabaab and Hizbul Islam against the TFG. Hundreds were killed and injured and tens of thousands were displaced. By 11 May, rebel forces gained the upper hand and made large gains taking over most of the capital. The rebels came close to overthrowing the government before fighting ended on 14 May, new rounds of fighting would last all through August. By 16 May, al-Shabaab captured the strategic town of Jowhar, which connects Mogadishu with central Somalia. One of the largest battles of the war took place about 3 weeks later on 5 June when Hizbul Islam captured Wabho leaving 50 combatants killed. On 19 June, the transitional parliament speaker Sheikh Adan Mohamed Nuur Madobe asked the international community to send foreign troops to Somalia within the following 24 hours. He stated that the government's power is on the verge of being defeated by Islamist forces in the Somali capital. The Somali cabinet declared a state of emergency, and asked for help from neighboring countries which included Kenya, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Yemen. Ethiopia refused saying intervention needs an international mandate. al-Shabaab responded by 21 June saying they would fight any foreign troops, and made threats against potential Kenyan intervention.\nPresident Sheikh Sharif Ahmed declared a state of emergency by 22 June, as a new round of fighting in Mogadishu left 12 dead and 20 injured with hundreds more fleeing the city. The notion of Ethiopian troops intervening in the conflict caused defections by local government administration officials. Areas affected by this included Beledweyne, El-gal village, and Hiraan. The effects also caused many pro-government Islamic Courts Union officials to resign. In response, TFG forces led by general Muktar Hussein Afrah started military manoeuvers in the East side of Mogadishu. On 6 July, The Amir of al-Shabaab, Ahmed Godane gave government forces an ultimatum of five days to hand over their weapons which was rejected. At some point, foreign aid to the government was provided in the form of security advisors. On 17 July, two of these advisors (sent by France) were captured by insurgents. The Somali government gave permission for French commandos to launch operations inside Somalia to free the two French nationals that were held by al-Shabaab. France responded on 22 July by sending in warships and helicopters near the ports of Mogadishu and Marka declaring they would undertake military operations to free the two French military advisors who had been captured by insurgents. One of the hostages eventually was able to escape by August 2009, while the other was last seen in a video released in June 2010 asking for assistance.\nThe United States also took up targeting Al-Qaeda members. On 14 September several U.S. Navy helicopters launched a raid in Baraawe against Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, killing him as well as five other militants.\nAlso in 2009, British Army soldiers from the Special Air Service and the Special Reconnaissance Regiment were deployed to Djibouti as part of Combined Joint Task Force – Horn of Africa to conduct operations against Islamist terrorists in Somalia. They carried out missions focusing on surveillance and targeting of terrorists, alongside their US counterparts. They have also been carrying out this role in Yemen.\nAl-Shabaab-Hizbul Islam conflict\nThe armed conflict between Hizbul Islam and al-Shabaab began due to a dispute between the faction of the Ras Kamboni Brigades led by Sheikh Ahmed \"Madoobe\" and al-Shabaab, over a power sharing agreement in Kisimayo. Hizbul Islam and al-Shabaab had made a power sharing agreement for the city, where the power would rotate between the two factions, with each faction controlling the city for periods of six months. However, due to clan politics al-Shabaab refused to let the power rotation take place. This led to internal problems within Hizbul Islam as its ARS-A and JABISO factions, which were aligned with al-Shabaab in Hiran and Mogadishu, refused to support the Ras Kamboni Brigades, while Anole remained neutral. It also led to a split within the Ras Kamboni Brigades, with a faction led by Hizbul Islam's deputy chairman Sheikh Hassan \"Turki\" refusing to back Ahmad \"Madoobe\" and instead siding with al-Shabaab. It was reported on 1 October that heavy fighting in Kisimayo had broken out between the two factions, al-Shabaab controlled most of the city with dozens of casualties reported by the afternoon. At least 17 more people were killed in a series of battles overnight on 5 October. Hizbul Islam claimed that they had captured foreign fighters in the battle. The battle eventually ended with a decisive victory for al-Shabaab, which expelled Madbobe's Ras Kamboni Brigade forces from the city.\nThroughout November 2009, fighting between the two factions continued as the battle lines moved into Southern Somalia, resulting in a decrease in insurgent attacks at Mogadishu targeting government forces (TFG) and their allies (AMISOM). Sheikh Ahmad Madobe's forces were ultimately overpowered by al-Shabaab and its local allies, and forced to withdraw from the Lower Juba region and most of Southern Somalia. The merger between al-Shabaab and Sheikh Hassan Turki's branch of the Ras Kamboni Brigades occurred early in 2010 (February) with a call for other groups in Hizbul Islam to do the same. Additional battles throughout 2010 were fought between Hizbul Islam and al-Shabaab in central Somalia as fighting moved from the Hiran region to the Bay region, to Lower Shabelle. Hizbul Islam eventually was forced to surrender the Luuq District in Gedo region to al-Shabaab, after which the group announced that it would merge with al-Shabaab. From mid-December al-Shabaab fighters started taking over Hizbul Islam positions. The merge was confirmed on 20 December, when Hizbul Islam Chairman Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys and Sheikh Mohammad Osman Arus, the organisation's official spokesman, surrendered to al-Shabaab and disbanded the organisation.\n2011–15: Government forces retake lost territory\nBattle of Gashandiga\nAl-Shabaab controlled roughly half the lands claimed by the Somali government at their greatest extent in 2009 July. With the help of allies, government forces slowly started to make gains that would lead to a retake of lost territory through various military operations. An offensive on 20 February 2011 was dubbed by AU Representative Wafula Wamunyinyi as the \"Battle of Gashandiga.\" This offensive involved AMISOM troops destroying a large complex of al-Shabaab trenches, killing six al-Shabaab commanders in Mogadishu. Towards the end of February, disturbances moved into Mogadishu again in the form of one suicide attack and heavy shelling as al-Shabaab fighters attempted to re-take lost territory. This push resulted in the deaths of at least 47 people, rebels displayed one wounded and five dead Burundian AMISOM soldiers. Another offensive was opened up between 26 February and 28 February by TFG troops with support of Ethiopian soldiers in Bula Hawo (southern Somalia), resulting in 33 deaths.\nBy 5 March, AMISOM and TFG forces claimed to control seven of the city's districts, while six were contested and three were controlled by anti-government forces. Al-Shabaab responded to the government offensive by putting up roadblocks to prevent the movement of goods from the seaport. This adversely affected both sides of the conflict, as the TFG controlled the port and its profits. At the same time though, places such as Bakaara Market were controlled by the insurgents where many of the goods were bound to be sold. It was also reported by this time that up to 53 AMISOM may have died in the clashes, which included 43 Burundian and 10 Ugandans. An additional 1,000 peacekeepers to assist in the TFG's renewed offensive against al-Shabaab were brought in, and by 16 March AMISOM had a force of nearly 9,000.\nIn early May 2011, al-Shabaab were pushed out of Garbahare by government forces commanded by Nur Matan Abdi. At least 26 al-Shabaab militants were killed, while just five government soldiers were wounded.\nDefeat of al-Shabaab in Mogadishu\nThe 2010–11 battle of Mogadishu began when al-Shabaab militants launched an offensive to capture the city. The battle soon swung in favor of government forces, who were able to drive the militant group out by 11 October 2011. The complete capture of the city took place on 7 September 2012, when the Transitional Federal Government's troops and their AMISOM allies managed to secure the city. Around the same time witnesses reported al-Shabaab vehicles abandoning their bases in the capital for the south-central city of Baidoa. The group's spokesman Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage described the exodus as a tactical retreat, and vowed to continue the insurgency against the national government. Observers have suggested that the pullout may have been caused in part by internal ideological rifts in the rebel organization. The city was by no means safe after al-Shabaab withdrew as the militant group continued hit and run tactics in the Northern part of the city. Suicide bombs continued to be an occurrence lasting into 2020 (see below).\nFighting in Puntland\nOn 2 to 3 September, fighting was reported in Puntland that resulted in the deaths of up to 60 people, including eight Puntland soldiers and 40 al-Shabaab militants, with Insurgents being repelled. al-Shabaab claimed on 7 September that they have captured two Kenyan troops who were on a surveillance mission near the Kenyan-Somali Border. Puntland forces captured 18 members of al-Shabaab in counter-terrorism operations on 8 September.\nBattle of Elwaq & Kismayo offensive\nal-Shabaab attacked the southern town of Elwaq on 10 September 2011, resulting in the deaths of 12 insurgents and soldiers. The next day, Somali troops fought back, retaking the town after militants fled on captured technicals. The bodies of 30 militants were later found, some of them children. Conversely, al-Shabaab claimed they killed around 70 government aligned troops and captured 10 technicals.\nThe Burundian military lost 51 soldiers in October, causing anger among Burundians, who believe that their country is sacrificing too much. Many Burundians have urged other AU members to contribute troops to the Somalia mission. Nigeria, Djibouti, and Guinea have indicated sending troops, but all have yet to contribute.\nOn 4 September 2012 the Kenyan Navy shelled Kismayo. This was part of an AU offensive to capture the city from al-Shabaab fighters. The harbour was shelled two times and the airport three times. According to a UN report the export of charcoal through Kismayo is a major source of income for al-Shabaab.\nOn 28 September 2012, the Somali National Army assisted by AMISOM troops and Ras Kamboni militia launched an assault on Kismayo, al-Shabaab's last major stronghold. The allied forces reportedly managed to re-capture much of the city from the insurgents.\nOperation Indian Ocean & Jubba Corridor\nIn August 2014, AMISOM supported by Somali forces began Operation Indian Ocean. On 1 September 2014, a US drone strike carried out as part of the broader mission killed al-Shabaab leader Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr, also known as Ahmed Godane US authorities hailed the raid as a major symbolic and operational loss for al-Shabaab, and the Somali government offered a 45-day amnesty to all moderate members of the militant group. Political analysts also suggested that the insurgent commander's death will likely lead to al-Shabaab's fragmentation and eventual dissolution.\nFrom 19 July 2015, AMISOM and the Somali National Army regained many villages and the major towns of Bardhere and Dinsoor. Operation Piga Jangili, seizing Bardhere, involved fighting for six hours against an estimated 175 to 200 insurgent opponents. \"Upon entering the kill zone, several Improvised Explosive Device initiated ambushes [delayed] convoy movement and killed and wounded multiple KDF soldiers.\" Then-Captain William Doyle of 10th Special Forces Group, US Army, won the Silver Star for \"exposing himself to effective fire so he could ... keep the KDF convoy moving through the valley.\" The medal citation credits his actions with contributing to 173 enemy killed and 60 more wounded, while saving \"countless\" partner forces.\n2016: Battle of El Adde and resurgence of al-Shabaab\nOn 15 January 2016, al-Shabaab attacked a Kenyan-run AMISOM base in El Adde Somalia, overrunning the compound and killing approximately 185 soldiers. Al-Shabaab then regained the important town of Marka, 45&nbsp;km from the capital, and the port of Gard in Puntland region (March 2016). Al-Shabaab's activities create constant dilemmas for international humanitarian aid organisations.\nOn 5 March 2016, US aircraft and unmanned drones killed more than 150 al-Shabaab insurgents at a training camp called \"Camp Raso\", located about 120 miles north of Mogadishu as they were \"training for a large-scale attack,\" according to a spokesman for the United States Department of Defense. The camp had been under surveillance for some time before the strike. In the early hours of 9 March 2016, US Somali special forces killed between 1 and 15 al-Shabaab fighters in a heliborne-attack on the al-Shabaab-controlled town of Awdhegele, as well as capturing an undisclosed number of high-value al-Shabaab figures.\nOn 11/12 April 2016, two US airstrikes on al-Shabaab targets in the town of Kismayo killed about a dozen suspected militants who posed an \"imminent threat\" to American troops in the country. As of May 2016, roughly 50 US special operations troops operate at undisclosed locations across southern Somalia, with their headquarters at the airport in Mogadishu; advising and assisting, Kenyan, Somali and Ugandan forces in their fight against al-Shabaab. Also in that month, US personnel helped those forces plan an operation against illegal checkpoints.\nOn 12 May 2016, a small group of US military advisers accompanied some Ugandan soldiers during a raid on an illegal taxation checkpoint just west of Mogadishu, when the Ugandans came under fire from 15 to 20 al-Shabaab militants, the US commander on the ground called in a \"defensive\" airstrike, killing five militants and wounding two more. Two days previously, the US provided helicopters and advise and assist in support of a Somali military mission against a group of al-Shabaab militants, which one defense official said was also defensive because they had intelligence that the al-Shabaab fighters were planning an attack on the AMISOM installation nearby. No word on how many al-Shabaab were killed or wounded in that operation. On 13 May, a US strike targeted nine al-Shabaab militants, three of them were allegedly killed.\nOn the night of 31 May 2016, two senior al-Shabaab operatives; Mohamud Dulyadeyn, the plotter behind the Garissa University attack in April 2015 and Maalim Daud, head of al-Shabaab's intelligence hit squads and another 16 members from al-Shabaab were killed by the Somali National Army and anti-terror partners. Defense Department spokeswoman Lt. Col. Michelle L. Baldanza told CNN \"US forces supported this Somali-led operation in an advise-and-assist role,\".\nOn 1 June 2016, al-Shabaab militants attacked with a car bomb on the gate of Ambassador Hotel in Mogadishu, Somalia. At least 15 people have been killed in the attack, among 10 civilian pedestrians and two members of parliament near the gate. Also that day, the Pentagon announced that it had conducted an airstrike that killed a senior al-Shabaab leader in Somalia on 27 May. On 3 August 2016, a contingent of elite American troops acting as military advisers assisted Somali commandos in an assault on an al-Shabaab checkpoint in Saakow, as the Somali-led force approached the checkpoint the militants opened fire, a gun battle ensued that resulted in 3 militants killed.\nOn 29 September 2016, a Somali regional government demanded an explanation from the United States after an airstrike killed 22 civilians and other soldiers instead of the targeted al-Shabaab militants in Galmudug. The Military Times also reported that on 26 September a bomb-manufacturing network linked al-Shabaab attacked a small team of US and Somali troops, who were conducting an operation near Kismayo, with small-arms fire. A Pentagon spokesman said the US military \"conducted a self-defense strike to neutralize the threat and in doing so killed nine enemy fighters.\" Also on 28 September, near the town of Galkayo, a Somali army unit conducting counterterrorism operations nearby, when the Somali soldiers came under fire from al-Shabaab militants. The Somali soldiers engaged them, then broke contact and rejoined with their nearby American advisers and soon afterwards the militants \"began to maneuver in an offensive manner\" so the US conducted a self-defense airstrike, killing 4 militants.\n2017: American involvement expanded\nIn late March 2017, President Donald Trump gave US Africa Command more freedom to conduct airstrikes and other military operations.\nIn addition to stepping up airstrikes, US special forces fighting with Somali forces have also been increased, conventional US troops give lessons in building defense institutions, with added support from other nations.\nCNN reported that General Thomas Waldhauser, commander of AFRICOM, told reporters in April that the US seeks to help Somali security forces gain the ability to provide for their own security by 2021.\nThe New York Times reported that on 4 May 2017, a US Navy SEAL team partnered with Somali National Army forces, carried out a mission on an al-Shabaab-occupied complex around  west of Mogadishu. Fox News reported that they targeting what Pentagon spokesperson Captain Jeff Davis said was a \"group of people\" associated with attacks on Mogadishu. The New York Times reported that Defence Department officials said that Somali forces were to have led the operation, with the SEALs hanging back in an advise, assist and accompany role, however Brig.Gen. David J. Furness, the commander of the military's task force for the Horn of Africa, said that American and Somali forces were traveling together in a single group. Whilst approaching the complex, the militants opened fire and the mission was aborted, Senior chief petty officer Kyle Milliken was killed, 2 other SEALs and an interpreter were wounded. Captain Jeff Davis said that the mission \"resulted in the death of three Shabaab operatives including Moalin Osman Abdi Badil,\" the group quickly returned to the aircraft that had taken it to the area and was exfilled. Davis described Badil as an al-Shabaab leader responsible for gathering information on troop movements in order to support attacks on Somali and African Union forces and that he had been linked to the death of several soldiers and at least one civilian.\nCNN reported that on 11 June 2017, that a US air strike killed 8 al-Shabaab militants in Sakow, the president of Somalia said that \"This was a successful strike which destroyed a key al-Shabaab command and supply hub,\" and that \"This will ultimately disrupt the enemy's ability to conduct new attacks within Somalia.\" CNN reported that on 23 July 2017, The US carried out a targeted airstrike an al-Shabaab regional commander in Banadir. Fox News reported that on 30 July 2017, a US strike near Tortoroow in southern Somalia which was coordinated with regional partners as a direct response to al-Shabaab's actions which included attacks on Somali forces, killed Ali Jabal, who was considered a senior al-Shabaab terrorist and was responsible for leading forces operating in the Mogadishu and Banadiir area, including planning and carrying out attacks in Mogadishu.\nABC reported that on 10 August 2017, airstrikes conducted by drones in Banaadir in a joint operation against al-Shabaab fighters, killing a high-level al-Shabaab leader. The airstrikes marked the fourth offensive airstrike against al-Shabaab since the new authorisation in March. CNN reported that on 17 August 2017, the US conducted a \"self defense\" drone strike in Jilib after a joint US-Somali force, consisting of Somali troops and US advisors, came under direct attack by al-Shabaab militants and a firefight ensued, 7 militants were killed.\nMilitary.com reported that on 3 November 2017, that a US drone conducted two airstrikes against Islamic State in Somalia, at least six missiles were used which struck in Buqa, 37 miles north of Qandala, AFRICOM said in a statement that \"several terrorists\" were killed and that the strikes were carried out in coordination with Somalia's government; marking the first time the US has conducted airstrikes against ISS terrorists in Somalia. CNN reported that US drone aircraft conducted five strikes between 9 and 12 November against al-Shabaab and ISS-linked militants, killing 36 al-Shabaab and four ISS fighters. One of the strikes killed an al-Shabaab member who had attacked a joint US-Somali military convoy in Gaduud. CNN reported that a US airstrike on a camp 125 miles northwest of Mogadishu killed more than 100 al-Shabaab militants; the US now estimates there are between 3,000 and 6,000 al-Shabaab fighters and fewer than 250 ISIS operatives in Somalia. Military Times reported that on 14 November, a US drone strike roughly 60 miles northwest of Mogadishu killed several al-Shabaab militants. CNN reported that on 24 December, a US airstrike in southern Somalia killed 13 al-Shabaab terrorists.\n2018–present: Ongoing guerrilla warfare\nOn 15 December 2018, there were demonstrations in Baidoa by supporters of Mukhtar Robow, a presidential candidate, who was arrested two days before by government forces and transferred to Mogadishu. Rowbow is a former member of al-Shabaab. Robbow was seized by the Ethiopian National Defence Force. African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) announced in a statement that its forces did not assist in Rowbow's arrest and his transfer to Mogadishu.\n2019\nBy 2019, the United States was heavily involved in the war, using airstrikes.

As part of its duties, AMISOM also supports the Transitional Federal Government's forces in their battle against al-Shabaab militants.\nAMISOM was created by the African Union's Peace and Security Council on 19 January 2007 with an initial six-month mandate. On 21 February 2007 the United Nations Security Council approved the mission's mandate. Subsequent six-monthly renewals of AMISOM's mandate by the African Union Peace and Security Council have also been authorised by the United Nations Security Council.\nAMISOM's UN mandate was extended for a further six months in August 2008 by UNSCR 1831. The AMISOM's mandate has been extended each period that it has been up for review. It is now set to be reviewed again on 16 January 2013.\nOn 12 November 2013, the UN Security Council adopted SC Resolution 2124 (2013) extending AMISOM's mandate from 28 February 2014 to 31 October 2014.

It was announced that it was hoped that ATMIS's mandate would end in 2024. ATMIS consists of troops from the East African nations of Burundi, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda.\nUnited States and United Nations\n, in Somalia on 21 January 2021]]\nThe Government of Somalia has requested U.S. involvement multiple times.\nThe United Nations Development Programme for Somalia spends about $50 million each year, though these funds are not related to military aid. Instead these programs, such as Employment Generation for Early Recovery (EGER). As of October 2010, the US State Department noted the United States directly obligated over $229 million to support AMISOM, and paid for other UN assistance for the mission indirectly through its obligations to the international body.\nIn January 2013, the US announced that it was set to exchange diplomatic notes with the new central government of Somalia, re-establishing official ties with the country for the first time in 20 years. According to the Department of State, the decision was made in recognition of the significant progress that the Somali authorities had achieved on both the political and war fronts. The move is expected to grant the Somali government access to new sources of development funds from American agencies as well as international bodies like the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, thereby facilitating the ongoing reconstruction process. In addition to diplomatic ties; roughly 50 US special operations troops operate at undisclosed locations across southern Somalia advising and assisting, Kenyan, Somali and Ugandan forces in their fight against al-Shabaab.\nAt the behest of the Somali and American federal governments, among other international actors, the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved United Nations Security Council Resolution 2093 during its 6 March 2013 meeting to suspend the 21-year arms embargo on Somalia. The endorsement officially lifts the purchase ban on light weapons for a provisional period of one year, but retains certain restrictions on the procurement of heavy arms such as surface-to-air missiles, howitzers and cannons. On 9 April 2013, the US government likewise approved the provision of defense articles and services by the American authorities to the Somali Federal Government. At the request of the Somali authorities and AMISOM, the US military in late 2013 also established a small team of advisers in Mogadishu to provide consultative and planning support to the allied forces.\nThe United Kingdom is also involved in combating Islamist extremists in Somalia. Since 2009, members of the Special Air Service and the Special Reconnaissance Regiment have conducted counter-terrorist operations in Somalia from Camp Lemonnier; they have watched Britons believed to be travelling to Somalia for terrorist training and have worked with US counterparts observing and \"targeting\" local suspects. They have also been carrying out a similar role in Yemen. In May 2016, it was reported that 70 UK military personnel have arrived in Somalia to counter al-Shabaab as part of a UN peacekeeping mission; ten soldiers will offer medical, engineering and logistical support to AMISOM. Personnel will also be sent to South Sudan to carry out a similar role.\nOn 16 October 2016, The New York Times reported that American officials said the White House had quietly broadened the president's authority for the use of force in Somalia by allowing airstrikes to protect American and African troops as they combat fighters from al-Shabaab. About 200 to 300 American Special Operations troops work with soldiers from Somalia and other African nations like Kenya and Uganda to carry out more than a half-dozen raids per month, according to senior American military officials. The operations are a combination of ground raids and drone strikes. SEAL Team 6 has been heavily involved in many of these operations. American military officials said once ground operations are complete, American troops working with Somali forces often interrogate prisoners at temporary screening facilities, including one in Puntland, before the detainees are transferred to more permanent Somali-run prisons. The Pentagon has only acknowledged a small fraction of these operations, announcing 13 ground raids and airstrikes so far in 2016 (three of which took place in September)—up from five in 2015; according to data compiled by New America (a Washington think tank) the strikes have killed about 25 civilians and 200 people suspected of being militants. At a former Russian fighter jet base in Baledogle, US Marines and private contractors are working to build up a Somali military unit designed to combat al-Shabaab throughout the country.\nOn 30 March 2017, CNN reported that US President Donald Trump signed off a decision by the White House which approved a new strategy granting AFRICOM the authority to step up counterterrorism strikes in Somalia; under the new strategy, the US military will now be able to conduct precision airstrikes in support of the Somalia National Army and AMISOM forces. The new authorization designates some regions of Somalia an \"area of active hostilities,\" freeing counterterrorism strikes there from restrictions governing other strikes outside the areas; an official said that the designated areas will not include Mogadishu and Puntland. Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon Spokesman said that \"The additional support provided by this authority will help deny al-Shabaab safe havens from which it could attack US citizens or US interests in the region.\" Another official said that the legal basis for the new authority is the 2001 AUMF. In mid-April 2017, it was reported that 40 soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division were deployed to Somalia on 2 April 2017 to improve the capabilities of the Somalia Army in combating Islamist militants. AFRICOM stated that the troops will focus on bolstering the Somali army's logistics capabilities; an AFRICOM spokesman said that \"This mission is not associated with teaching counterextremism tactics\" and that the Somali government requested the training.\nOn 16 June 2020, Human Rights Watch revealed the inconsistency in investigation by the US authorities in a 2 February airstrike, which killed one woman.

In Hiraan, Ethiopian forces which entered along with TFG-forces exchanged fire with al-Shabaab militants and advanced until the Kalaber junction, near Beledweyne. The Ethiopian troops then withdrew to Ferfer.\nOn 29 August, there was a second Ethiopian incursion. A large number of Ethiopian forces in military vehicles, accompanied by highly trained TFG forces, entered several villages in al-Shabaab controlled Hiraan region. This came at a time when al-Shabaab militants regularly ventured near the border. Hussein Abdallah, an ASWJ loyalist claimed that the movements were a preliminary action to signal that Ethiopian authorities are able of weakening the Islamist insurgents, to al-Shabaab's leadership.\nOn 1 September, Ethiopian forces moved deeper into Gedo region, via Dolow, entering the TFG-held village of Yeed. TFG officials in the region reported they were planning to capture the entire Bay and Bakool regions from al-Shabaab.\nOn 30 December, TFG forces clashed with Ethiopian troops in the Jawil district, near Beledweyne, after Ethiopian forces took a TFG soldier into custody. One TFG soldier and one civilian were injured in the clashes.\n2011\nOn 3 January, Ahlu Sunna Waljamaa official Sheikh Abdi Badel Sheikh Abdullahi, complained about Ethiopian forces in the town of Dolo, in Gedo region. The town is controlled by 300 ASWJ and TFG forces, but it is also home to several Ethiopian military bases. Ethiopian forces had called on ASWJ fighters in the district to lay down their arms. According to a TFG official, three Ethiopian commanders had then come to the town of Dolo and ordered TFG forces to disarm. Ethiopian troops then disarmed a number of TFG and ASWJ forces. Sheikh Abdullahi alleged that Ethiopian forces were doing this because they were outraged by ASWJ's military capability.\nOn 19 November, eyewitness reported large number of Ethiopian troops crossing into Somalia. Ethiopian authorities denied this.\nAfter a multinational conference held on 25 November in Addis Ababa, IGAD announced that the Ethiopian government had agreed to support the allied forces' campaign against al-Shabaab.\nOn 31 December 2011, the Transitional Federal Government soldiers and around 3,000 allied Ethiopian army troops attacked Beledweyne in the early morning, capturing it after hours of fighting. They later took control of Baidoa, among other areas.\n2012\nOn 22 October 2012, the Spokesman of African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM) Col. Ali Aden Humed speaking to journalists in Mogadishu on Saturday said that Ethiopian forces present in parts of the regions of Somalia will soon pull out from the country.\nThe spokesman said AMISOM troops will take over the areas where Ethiopian forces are holding at the moment. \"The plan by AMISOM is to take over the positions held by Ethiopian forces in parts of the regions of the country, Ethiopian troops will soon retreat back to their position along Somalia border\" said Col. Ali Aden Humed.\n2013\nIn 2013, Ethiopian Foreign Minister Tedros Adhanom announced that Ethiopian troops were pulling out of Baidoa as the situation on the ground was relatively stable and the Somali military and AMISOM forces were now able to assume security duties. The withdrawal was well planned and coordinated. Adhanom added that a pullout could have occurred twelve months earlier, but the allied forces were at the time unprepared to take over, so the move was postponed. Additionally, he asserted that Eritrea was attempting to destabilize Somalia and environs, and that the international community should take the situation seriously since Eritrea was also still allegedly supporting al-Shabaab. Following the Westgate shooting in Nairobi by al-Shabaab operatives, the Ethiopian government halted its plans to withdraw completely out of Somalia. In November 2013, the Ethiopian government announced that it would integrate its troops that are deployed in Somalia into the AMISOM multinational force. Somalia's Foreign Minister Fowzia Haji Yussuf welcomed the decision, stating that the move would galvanize AMISOM's campaign against the insurgent group. She also emphasized the importance of collaboration between Somalia and Ethiopia. The Ethiopian authorities' announcement came a month after a failed October bombing attempt by al-Shabaab in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, and a week after Ethiopia received a renewed terrorism threat from the insurgent group. According to Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Ambassador Dina Mufti, the Ethiopian military's decision to join AMISOM is intended to render the peacekeeping operation more secure. Analysts also suggested that the move was primarily motivated by financial considerations, with the Ethiopian forces' operational costs now slated to be under AMISOM's allowance budget. It is believed that the Ethiopian military's long experience in Somali territory, its equipment such as helicopters, and the potential for closer coordination will help the allied forces advance their territorial gains. On the other hand, there is a certain amount of unease following Ethiopia's entry into AMISOM given local animosity originating from Ethiopia's heavy handed intervention in 2006. There are also fears that al-Shabaab could use Somali animosity towards Ethiopia as a rallying cry and to recruit more members. It is also believed that some Ethiopian troops in Somalia operate independently from AMISOM.\n2014\nIn December 2014, the Ethiopian government offered to replace the last AMISOM contingent from Sierra Leone with fresh Ethiopian military reinforcements.\n2020\nOn 4 May 2020, an East African Express Airways Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia airliner on an air charter flight delivering COVID-19 pandemic relief supplies crashed on approach to Berdale, Somalia, killing all 2 crew and 4 non-revenue passengers on board. On 10 May, a leaked AMISOM report alleged that ground troops of the Ethiopian National Defense Force operating outside AMISOM authority had shot the aircraft down, mistakenly believing it was undertaking a suicide attack. This allegation ignited renewed controversy over unauthorized Ethiopian incursions into Somalia to fight al-Shabaab. Ethiopian, Kenyan and Somali authorities have initiated a joint investigation of the accident.\n2021\nKenya\n, a Somali government-allied militia, 2012]]\nRecruitment from Kenya\nAccording to press reports, Somali and Kenyan government officials have recruited and trained Somali refugees in Kenya and Kenyan nationals who are ethnic Somalis to fight insurgents in Somalia.

There was a subsequent fierce exchange of fire between the two sides leading to the deaths of 2 militia and the wounding of one Kenyan officer. Hundreds of security personnel were later deployed to the border following the clash and because of continued fighting between two militia groups in the neighbouring town of Dobley, Somalia. al-Shabaab had previously claimed responsibility for a deadly suicide bombing in Uganda in July.\nOperation Linda Nchi\nIn October 2011, the Kenya Defence Forces began Operation Linda Nchi against al-Shabaab in southern Somalia. The mission was officially led by the Somali armed forces, with the Kenyan armed forces providing supporting role. In early June 2012, Kenyan forces were formally integrated into AMISOM.\nCamp Simba attack\nOn 5 January 2020, al-Shabaab militants launched an attack at on Camp Simba at Manda Air Strip used by Kenyan and US troops in Lamu County, Kenya, the attack was repelled, leaving three American nationals killed; one serviceman and two contractors. Four militants died in the attack and five were arrested. Moreover, six aircraft and land vehicles were destroyed or damaged at the airstrip. Some of the airframes lost included a De Havilland Canada Dash 8 and two helicopters.\nPiracy\nGovernment officials from the Galmudug administration in the north-central Hobyo district also reportedly attempted to use pirate gangs as a bulwark against Islamist insurgents from southern Somalia's conflict zones. Other pirates are alleged to have reached agreements of their own with the Islamist groups, although a senior commander from the Hizbul Islam militia vowed to eradicate piracy by imposing sharia law when his group briefly took control of Harardhere in May 2010 and drove out the local pirates.\nSee also\n* American military intervention in Somalia (2007–present)\n* Democracy in Africa\n* Elections in Somalia\n* Elections in Somaliland\n* List of wars: 2003–present\nReferences"
