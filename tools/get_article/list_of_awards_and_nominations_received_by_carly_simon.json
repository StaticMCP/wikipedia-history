Among her numerous accolades, she is the recipient of two Grammy Awards, from 14 nominations, as well as an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award. Her debut album, Carly Simon, was released in 1971 and won her the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1972, while the lead single \"That's the Way I've Always Heard It Should Be\" earned her a nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the same ceremony. Her second album, Anticipation, earned her another Grammy nomination in the same category the following year. Her third album, No Secrets, was released in 1972 and spawned the worldwide hit \"You're So Vain\", which earned Simon three Grammy nominations in 1974: Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. No Secrets also earned a nomination for Best Engineered Recording at the same ceremony, for engineers Robin Geoffrey Cable and Bill Schnee.\nSimon's 1977 worldwide hit \"Nobody Does It Better\", the theme song to the Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me, garnered her another Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance in 1978. The song also earned a nomination for Song of the Year, for composer Marvin Hamlisch and songwriter Carole Bayer Sager. Simon's seventh album, Boys in the Trees, was released later that year and spawned the hit single \"You Belong to Me\", which earned her another Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance in 1979. Boys in the Trees won Best Album Package at the same ceremony; the Grammy went to Johnny Lee and Tony Lane. Simon's eighth album, Spy, was released in 1979 and its lead single, \"Vengeance\", earned her a Grammy nomination for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance in 1980, the first year to feature this category.\nSimon released her 13th album, Coming Around Again, in 1987.
