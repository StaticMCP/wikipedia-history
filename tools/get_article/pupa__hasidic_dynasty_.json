The whole community was deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp, and only a few survived. There are no longer any Jews there.\nThe group is based in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, with branches in the Boro Park section of Brooklyn, Monsey, New York, Los Angeles, and Ossining, New York. It is headed by the Pupa rebbe, who has several thousand followers.\nPupa has more than 7,000 students enrolled in its yeshivas, girls schools, summer camps, and kollelim in Williamsburg, Boro Park, Monsey, Westchester County, New York, Montreal, Jerusalem, and elsewhere. In Williamsburg, Pupa is second in size to the Satmar Hasidim, with whom they share many communal facilities.\nLineage\n* Moshe Greenwald (1853–1910).\n** Yaakov Yechezkiah Greenwald I (1882–1941)\n*** Yosef Greenwald (1903–1984)\n**** Yaakov Yechezkiya Greenwald II (born 1948)\nat his father's gravesite]]\nKiryas Pupa and Kehilath Yakov Rabbinical Seminary\nKiryas Pupa is a village in Ossining, New York, established by Yosef Greenwald.
