F. Segrave. He was educated at Stonyhurst College and New College, Oxford, where he graduated BA. After Oxford, he became a member of the London Stock Exchange, and succeeded to the barony and a seat in the House of Lords on the death of his father in 1939.\nArundell served in the Territorial Army as a second lieutenant on the General List from 1929 to 1931. He joined the 4th Battalion of the Wiltshire Regiment as a lieutenant in 1934, and was promoted to captain in 1939. With the 2nd Battalion the Wiltshire Regiment, he was part of the British Expeditionary Force and in 1940, during the Battle of France, was taken prisoner-of-war by the Germans. He escaped, but was recaptured and was transferred to Oflag IV-C at Colditz Castle. There he had a habit of exercising in the snow and, perhaps as a result, contracted tuberculosis.\nIn accordance with the Geneva Conventions, he was repatriated and died aged 37 in hospital in Chester. He was unmarried, and his barony became extinct upon his death. He was buried in the Chapel of New Wardour Castle.\nSee also\n*List of solved missing person cases\nReferences\nExternal links\n* 'ARUNDELL of Wardour', in Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920–2008; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2007 [http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U222010, accessed 5 Jan 2011]\n* http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2710500"
