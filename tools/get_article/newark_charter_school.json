It has two campuses, the Greg R. Meece Campus with three buildings for elementary (K-2), intermediate (3-5), and junior high (6-8) and the McIntire Drive Campus with the senior high school (9-12) that includes a sports complex and a performing arts center.\nHistory\nNewark Charter School's charter was approved by the Delaware State Board of Education in April 2000 and the middle school opened in September 2001. Shortly after the school opened, their students voted \"the Patriot\" as their mascot after the September 11 attacks and the school address was changed to 2001 Patriot Way. The charter was renewed in June 2004. An elementary school was opened in August 2007 and the charter was renewed for a second time in January 2010.\nIn April 2012, the Delaware state board of education voted unanimously to allow the addition of a high school, which made Newark Charter the state's first K-12 charter school.  Newark Charter High School is located in the former Lear Corporation factory, which made car seats for the now closed Chrysler Newark Assembly plant.  There were openings for 162 ninth graders in fall 2013, with another grade added each year.  The first graduation took place in 2017 with a total of 154 students graduating.  In 2020, the first students to complete the full K-12 program received diplomas. As of May 2024, 1303 students have graduated from Newark Charter High School.\nIn 2019, the school purchased the Delaware Freezer warehouse behind the Patriot Way campus to construct a new junior high school.  In March 2021, the groundbreaking ceremony for the new building took place with construction continuing through the 2021-2022 school year.  The new Junior High opened in time for the 2022-2023 school year with a reorganization of the existing buildings following suit.  The Elementary school shifted from K-3 to K-2, the Intermediate school shifted from 4-6 to 3-5, and the McIntire Drive campus shifted from 7-12 to 9-12.  To fund the construction, 600 additional seats were added in grades k-9 (50 per grade level).\nIn addition to the new Middle School, construction of a Commons Building also took place connecting the Elementary and Intermediate Schools in 2021.  Opening in August 2021, the Commons Building featured new administrative offices along with a bus port, shared kitchen, classrooms, a new art room, and a larger library.  In the fall of 2023, the athletic complex at the McIntire Drive campus, featuring a weight room, improved locker room facilities and a lighted stadium (Robert W. Gore Stadium) with a turf field and track (Boulden Brothers Field) opened.\nThe final part of the expansion features a new 600-seat performing arts center that has been finished in the winter of 2024.\nAthletics\nThe school joined the Diamond State Athletic Conference in the 2015–2016 school year.
