These villages are believed to have been developed by Catawba ancestors (specifically the Cheraw).\n|-\n| c. 1567 || || On a lengthy journey into the interior from Santa Elena (present day South Carolina) to the planned capital of Spanish Florida, Juan Pardo established the Presidio of San Juan at Joara.

An additional clause allowed Cherokee not wishing to move would be allowed to remain and become citizens of the states in which they resided, but President Jackson struck this clause.
