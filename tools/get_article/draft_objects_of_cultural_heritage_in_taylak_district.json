The history of the district was mainly studied on the basis of the books \"Kandiya\" by Abu Nasafiy, \"Samaria\" by Abu Takhirkhoja, \"Maymurg in the early Middle Ages\" by A. Sandibaev, as well as the newly published books by M. Mehrojiddin \"Shovdorname\" and \"Toyloqnoma\" by T. Muzaffarov.\nIt was confirmed that two of the 12 gardens built by Amir Temur in and around Samarkand are located in today's Taylak district. That is, Garden Zogan and Garden Stateabad. Of course, none of the Timurid parts of these gardens have been preserved until now. However, the improvement of the gardens mentioned in the sources and the pleasant weather indicate that it is possible to restore the Temur gardens according to modern standards.\nThe shrine of Taylak Baba is an archaeological monument of the 19th-20th centuries on the side of the highway, located in the Bogichinor neighborhood, south of the Samarkand-Panjakent road.\nShrine of Ad-Doramiy. The \"Master of Muhaddis\" who lived in the 8th century. He was the mentor of Imam al-Bukhari. Navbahar is located in MFY. A large-scale construction work is underway on the mausoleum.\nArchaeological monument of Khoja Guzar. It is the oldest and most territorial hill in the district dating back to the III, II-IV, VIII, XVI centuries.\n\"Pilgrimage of Baba Bandikusho\" is located in Bogizogan MFY. The object was created in the 19th-20th centuries.\nConclusion\nThe geographical location of Taylak district at a convenient point of Samarkand region indicates that it has long been a center of settlements, a center of trade and handicrafts, and an important arlomeration of Samarkand. Its historical potential, socio-economic indicators play an important role in the development of one of the developing districts of Samarkand region. These historic and modern facilities serve as an important foundation for the development of the tourism sector in the district. There are also a number of suggestions and recommendations that should be made regardless of the work being done in the district.  In particular, the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan \"On measures to further improve the activities of the Scientific and Expert Council of the Agency for Cultural Heritage of the Republic of Uzbekistan dated 20.05.2024 N 295\" on the protection of cultural heritage objects during 2024\", Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan dated 25.03.2024 \"On additions to the National List of Tangible Cultural Heritage Objects\" The need for more efficient organization of work and the allocation of additional funds for the preservation of cultural heritage objects in accordance with the Decree of 22.04.2024 No. 227 \"On amending and addenda to the National List of Tangible Cultural Heritage Objects\";\nThe need to provide economic support from the district administration in conducting comprehensive scientific and practical archaeological research of cultural heritage sites in order to increase the tourist potential of the district;\nIt will be expedient to develop tourist programs for the development of domestic tourism in the district, as well as to eliminate problems and shortcomings related to the service sector.\nThe proposed measures will be implemented in stages in 2025-2026, and the results can be posted as open data on the website of the district administration."
