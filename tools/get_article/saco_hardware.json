Founded in 1984, SACO started out with one store in Riyadh. Over the next two decades, the company expanded its reach across the country and, to date, operates 34 stores in 18 cities, including five stores (known as SACO World), each occupying between 2,350 and 24,500 square meters.\nHistory\nSACO was established in Riyadh in 1984 by a small group of entrepreneurs. Two decades later, in May 2004, the company set out to open SACO World in Riyadh, the largest, first-of-its-kind store in the Middle East. In June 2010, the company built its second SACO World in the Red Sea port city of Jeddah, and a year after that opened its largest superstore yet in the eastern province of Dhahran.\nIn 2015, it became a publicly listed company. In 2018, SACO opened its 31st store and, today, it has 34 stores across the country, with plans in the works to build more stores in the coming years.\nSACO acquired Medscan Terminal, a Saudi-based logistics service provider, in 2016. Amongst its latest endeavours are the launch of its new website and an e-commerce app.\nProducts and services\n- SACO carries a wide range of products that fall under seven departments: Tools and Hardware, Outdoor and Garden, Home Essentials, Home Improvement, Automotive, Electronics, and Sports, Fitness, and Toys.\n- SACO also offers three main areas of services: Delivery and Assembly, Installation, and Item Warranty and Maintenance.\nReferences"
