The PRC constitution asserts Taiwan as part of its territories, although the PRC has never controlled Taiwan since the PRC's establishment in 1949. The territory of the claimed province, including the entire island of Taiwan, is in actuality administered by the Republic of China (ROC) but is not coextensive with the smaller Taiwan Province of the ROC.\nThe political status of Taiwan is complex. Following the Chinese Civil War, the PRC considers itself the successor state of the pre-1949 ROC and the sole legitimate government of \"China\" since its founding on 1October 1949, and claims Taiwan and the Penghu Islands as part of its territory under the One China principle. However, the PRC has never administered Taiwan: the Taiwan Area, including all of the territory claimed by PRC as a province, has been continuously administered by the government of the Republic of China (ROC) since the Japanese surrender of World War II.\nThe People's Republic of China was founded in 1949 near the end of the Chinese Civil War. While by 1950 it had obtained control over most of the territories previously administered by the Republic of China (ROC), it never gained control of an area made up of Taiwan. Instead, Taiwan has been administered by the ROC (which is now commonly known as \"Taiwan\") since the end of World War II in 1945, continuing through the Chinese Civil War and past the foundation of the People's Republic of China in 1949.\nWhile the PRC claims Taiwan as part of its territory, it recognises Taiwan is outside its actual territory of control and does not maintain a government in exile for Taiwan Province. However, its National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party reserves a position for legislators that represent Taiwan, most of whom are of Taiwanese descent but were born in and are residents of mainland China, except for one representative (Lu Li'an) who was born and grew up in Taiwan. The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China is the part of the PRC government that has responsibility over Taiwan-related matters, but it is neither tasked with, nor presented as, a shadow administration for Taiwan. Instead, the ROC government currently based in Taiwan is referred to by the PRC as the \"Taiwan authorities\".\nIn 1979, the PRC proposed that under a hypothetical unification Taiwan would become a Special Administrative Region  rather than a province.\nUsage in the People's Republic of China\nIn official PRC statistics involving Taiwan, \"Taiwan Area\" is widely used instead, and is grouped with Special Administrative Regions rather than other provinces.\nAdministrative divisions\n{|class=\"wikitable\" | style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+\n|-\n! colspan=\"9\" | Administrative divisions of Taiwan\n|-\n| colspan=\"9\" style=\"font-size: larger;\" |\n}}\n}}\n}}}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n|-\n!

For example, in 2002 that Decision was as follows:\nHaving regard to the relevant Decision, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopts a \"Plan for the Consultative Election of Deputies of Taiwan Province to the National People's Congress\". The Plan typically provides that \"the deputies will be elected in Beijing through consultation from among representatives sent by Taiwan compatriots in these provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government and in the Chinese People's Liberation Army.\"\nIn the case of the 2002 election, the Standing Committee noted that there were more than 36,000 \"Taiwan compatriots\" in the 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government and the central Party, government and army institutions. It was decided that 122 representatives would participate in the conference for election through consultation. The number of representatives was allocated on the basis of the geographic distribution of Taiwan compatriots on the mainland and the standing committees of the people's congresses of the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government were responsible for making arrangements for the election of the representatives through consultation. The Standing Committee's Plan also provided that the election should be \"conducted in a democratic manner\".\nAfter the latest election at the 13th National People's Congress, 13 of the Taiwan representatives for the National People's Congress are:\n* Cai Peihui ()\n* Ceng Liqun ()\n* Chen Jun (), Amis\n* Chen Yunying (), born in Taipei\n* Fu Zhiguan ()\n* Huang Zhixian (), born in mainland China to a mother from Tainan\n* Liang Zhiqiang (), born in mainland China to parents from Miaoli County\n* Liao Haiying ()\n* Lin Qing (), born in Taipei\n* Xu Pei ()\n* Zhang Xiaodong ()\n* Zhang Xiong ()\n* Zou Zhenqiu ()\nNomenclatures for the ROC government used by PRC\nSince 21 July 2021, RTHK in Hong Kong has also imposed the same restrictions on its staff to prevent them from implying Taiwan as an independent state.\nFor some cases, where the name does not significantly imply sovereignty, the name remains the same, such as for the Mainland Affairs Council, county and mayor.\nGovernment bodies\n* Government as the Taiwan authorities\n* Presidential Office Building as the ''Taiwan leader's office building\n* Executive Yuan as the executive body\n* Legislative Yuan as the legislative body\n* Judicial Yuan as the judicial body\n* Ministry of Economic Affairs as the economic affairs authority\n* Ministry of Health and Welfare as the health and welfare authority\n* Ministry of the Interior as the interior authority\n* Ministry of Transportation and Communications as the transportation and communications authority\n* Central Election Commission as the election commission\nROC Government officials\n* President of the Republic of China as the leader of the Taiwan Area ()\n* Vice President as the deputy leader ()\n* Premier (or President of the Executive Yuan) as the executive chief ()\n* President of the Legislative Yuan as the legislative chief\n* Minister of Foreign Affairs as the chief official in charge of foreign exchange\n* Minister of Health and Welfare as the chief of health and welfare authority\n* Minister of the Mainland Affairs Council as the mainland affairs chief'' (Since 2014, Chinese state-affiliated media had started using the title of \"Minister of the Mainland Affairs Council\" directly rather than the Mainland Affairs Chief in Ma Ying-jeou's presidency)\n* Minister of National Defense as the military chief\n* Minister of Transportation and Communications as the chief of transportation and communications authority\nEducational institutions\n* National Taipei University as the Taipei University\n* National Taiwan University as the Taiwan University\n* National Taiwan Normal University as the Taiwan Normal University\nEvents\n* Republic of China Presidential Election as the leadership elections in the Taiwan area\nDemographics\nSee also\n* Provinces of China\n* Taiwan Province, Republic of China\n* Taiwan Affairs Office\n* Political status of Taiwan\n* Cross-strait relations\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.gwytb.gov.cn Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council]"
