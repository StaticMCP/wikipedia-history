There are four major and one minor petroleum refinery in the downstream sector of the UK oil industry.\n*Phillips 66, Humber Refinery, South Killingholme, 221,000 barrels per day\n*Essar Energy plc., Stanlow refinery, 190,000 barrels per day\n*Valero Energy Corp., Pembroke refinery, 270,000 barrels per day\n*ExxonMobil, Fawley refinery, 270,000 barrels per day\n* Haltermann Carless, Harwich refinery, 0.5 million tonnes per year (10,500 barrels per day)\nTotal, operational refining capacity 1,222,800 barrels per day, around 58 million tonnes per year.\nHistory\nIn 1902, there were four petroleum refineries in London that held a licence to import oil in barges along the River Thames, including S. Bowley and Son. There was small-scale oil refining along the Lower Thames estuary in 1914. Refining capacity increased during the inter-war period. By 1938 there were 11 oil refineries in the UK.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+UK oil refineries 1938\n!Company\n!Plant\n!Year completed\n!Capacity in 1937/8, tonnes per year\n|-\n|Esso Petroleum Co Ltd\n|Fawley, Hampshire\n|1921\n|700,000\n|-\n|Shell\n|Stanlow, Cheshire\n|1924\n|750,000\n|-\n|Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Co/ Shell UK Ltd\n|Shell Haven, Essex\n|1916\n|800,000\n|-\n|London and Thames Haven Oil Wharves Ltd\n|Shell Haven, Essex\n|1921\n|400,000\n|-\n|Cory Brothers Ltd\n|Coryton, Essex\n|1921\n|250,000\n|-\n|Shell UK Ltd\n|Ardrossan, South Ayrshire\n|1928\n|225,000\n|-\n|Anglo-Iranian Oil Co\n|Llandarcy, Neath Port Talbot\n|1921\n|360,000\n|-\n|Anglo-Iranian Oil Co\n|Grangemouth, Falkirk\n|1924\n|360,000\n|-\n|Berry Wiggins & Co Ltd\n|Kingsnorth, Kent\n|1930\n|70,000\n|-\n|Burmah Oil Trading Ltd\n|Ellesmere Port, Cheshire\n|1934\n|100,000\n|-\n|William Briggs & Sons Ltd\n|Dundee\n|1935\n|35,000\n|}\nIn 1937/8 total refining oil capacity in the UK was 4.21 million tonnes per year, by 1954 this had increased to 26.64 million tonnes.\nIn the post-Second World War period several of the existing refineries were expanded and 3 new major oil refineries were built.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+New major post-war oil refineries\n!Company\n!Plant\n!Year completed\n!Capacity in 1955, tonnes per year\n|-\n|Shell UK Ltd\n|Heysham, Lancashire\n|1948\n|1,800,000\n|-\n|BP Refinery Ltd\n|Isle of Grain, Kent\n|1953\n|4,600,000\n|-\n|Vacuum oil Co/Mobil Oil Co Ltd\n|Coryton, Essex\n|1953\n|1,000,000\n|}\nIn 1964 the following refineries were operating or being constructed or planned.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Coastal Oil Refineries in Great Britain 1964\n!Refinery\n!Acreage\n!Company\n!Capacity (1,000 tons)\n!Terminal location\n!Tanker size (1,000 dead  weight tons)\n|-\n|Shell Haven\n|1,000\n|Shell\n|8,900\n|Shell Haven, Thames Estuary\n|80\n|-\n|Coryton\n|300\n|Mobil\n|2,400\n|Coryton, Thames Estuary\n|53\n|-\n|Isle of Gain / BP Kent\n|1,300\n|BP\n|9,500\n|Isle of Grain, Medway\n|50\n|-\n|Kingsnorth\n|–\n|Berry Wiggins\n|195\n|Medway\n|\n|-\n|Fawley\n|1,000\n|Esso\n|11,500\n|Southampton Water\n|100\n|-\n|Llandarcy\n|900\n|BP\n|5,500\n|Angle Bay\n|100\n|-\n|Milford Haven\n|–\n|Esso\n|4,800\n|Swansea\n|20\n|-\n|Stanlow\n|2,000\n|Shell\n|10,400\n|Milford Haven\n|100\n|-\n|Ellesmere Port\n|100\n|Lobitos\n|400\n|Stanlow, Manchester Ship Canal\n|15\n|-\n|Heysham\n|124\n|Shell\n|2,000\n|Heysham\n|22\n|-\n|Ardrossan\n|30\n|Shell\n|180\n|Ardrossan\n|14\n|-\n|Dundee\n|–\n|William Briggs\n|60\n|Dundee\n|15\n|-\n|Grangemouth\n|400\n|BP\n|3,250\n|Finnart, Loch Long\nGrangemouth, Forth\n|100\n16\n|-\n|Pumpherston\n|–\n|BP\n|180\n|None\n|\n|-\n!

In 1976 there were 17 oil refineries in the UK. By 2000 there were 12 refineries namely:\n* BP Amoco, Coryton refinery (later Petroplus, closed 2012)\n* Carless, Harwich refinery (now Haltermann Carless)\n* Phillips 66, Humber refinery\n* Total, Lindsey refinery (Prax from 2021, closed 2025)\n* Petroplus, North Tees refinery (closed 2012)\n* BP Amoco, Grangemouth refinery (PetroIneos from 2004)\n* Nynas, Dundee refinery (closed 2013)\n* Shell/Nynas, Eastham refinery (bitumen) (closed after 2010)\n* Shell Stanlow refinery (Essar Energy from 2011)\n* Amoco, then Murco, Milford Haven refinery (closed 2015)\n* Texaco, Pembroke refinery (Valero from 2011)\n* Esso, Fawley refinery\nFurther oil company re-organisations and take-overs, and reductions in demand, led to further refinery closures. By 2019 there were 6 major and one smaller oil refineries in the UK.\nTimeline of UK refinery closures\nA timeline of the closure of UK oil refineries is summarised in  the following table.

The modern-day institute is headquartered in Marylebone, London.
