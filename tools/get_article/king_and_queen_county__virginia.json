As of the 2020 census, the population was 6,608. Its county seat is King and Queen Court House.\nHistory\nKing and Queen County was established in 1691 from New Kent County, and was named for King William III and Queen Mary II of England. King and Queen County is notable as one of the few counties in the United States to have recorded a larger population in the 1790 census than in 2020, this has been the case since 1920.\nAmong the earliest settlers of King and Queen County was Roger Shackelford, an English emigrant from Old Alresford, Hampshire, after whom the county's village of Shacklefords is named. Shackelford's descendants continued to live in the county, and by the nineteenth century had intermarried with several local families, including Taliaferro, Beverley, Thornton, and Sears.\nIn 1762 when he was 11, future president James Madison was sent to a boarding school run by Donald Robertson at the Innes plantation in King and Queen County. Robertson was a Scottish teacher who tutored numerous prominent plantation families in the South. From Robertson, Madison learned mathematics, geography, and modern and classical languages, becoming especially proficient in Latin. He attributed his instinct for learning \"largely to that man (Robertson).\"  At age 16, Madison returned to his father's Montpelier estate in Orange County.\nOn March 2, 1864, the Battle of Walkerton, an engagement of the American Civil War, took place here, resulting in a Confederate victory.\nVirginia Longest, national director of the Nursing Service for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs in the late 1970s, was a county native.\nRichard and Mildred Loving lived in a remote part of the county in the 1960s, hoping to avoid arrest by the authorities while their legal challenge to Virginia's anti-miscegenation laws moved through the courts.\nFor many years, county publications noted that the county lacked any traffic lights. This is now no longer the case, as a traffic light has been installed on U.S. Route 360 and Virginia State Route 14 at St. Stephen's Church.\nEven in the 21st century, King and Queen County contains no incorporated towns or cities, and remains one of Virginia's most sparsely populated counties. For example, as of 2024 it does not have a grocery store.\nGeography\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which  is land and  (3.4%) is water.\nMeasuring  in length, it is one of the longest counties in the state of Virginia, as well as one of the narrowest, measuring less than  across at its widest point.\nAdjacent counties\n* Caroline County – north\n* Essex County – northeast\n* Middlesex County – east\n* Gloucester County – southeast\n* James City County – south\n* New Kent County – southwest\n* King William County – west\nMajor highways\n*\n*\n*\nDemographics\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census1790–1960 1900–19901990–2000 2010 2020\n}}\n2020 census\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+King and Queen County, Virginia – Racial and ethnic composition\n!Race / Ethnicity (NH = Non-Hispanic)\n!Pop 2010\n!Pop 2020\n!% 2010\n!% 2020\n|-\n|White alone (NH)\n|4,547\n|4,460\n|65.47%\n|67.49%\n|-\n|Black or African American alone (NH)\n|1,970\n|1,561\n|28.37%\n|23.62%\n|-\n|Native American or Alaska Native alone (NH)\n|109\n|82\n|1.57%\n|1.24%\n|-\n|Asian alone (NH)\n|17\n|23\n|0.24%\n|0.35%\n|-\n|Pacific Islander alone (NH)\n|0\n|3\n|0.00%\n|0.05%\n|-\n|Some Other Race alone (NH)\n|7\n|19\n|0.10%\n|0.29%\n|-\n|Mixed Race or Multi-Racial (NH)\n|111\n|278\n|1.60%\n|4.21%\n|-\n|Hispanic or Latino (any race)\n|184\n|182\n|2.65%\n|2.75%\n|-\n|Total\n|6,945\n|6,608\n|100.00%\n|100.00%\n|}\n2000 Census\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 6,630 people residing in the county; these included 2,673 households and 1,897 families.
