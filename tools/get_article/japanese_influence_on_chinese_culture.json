It became popular in Japan as manga in the late 19th century. Feng Zikai reintroduced the word to Chinese, in the modern sense, with his 1925 series of political cartoons, entitled Zikai Manhua, in Wenxue Zhoubao (Literature Weekly). While terms other than  had existed before, this publication took precedence over the many other descriptions for cartoon art, and  became a general term for all Chinese comic materials.\nAnimation\nIn 2011, Chinese company Vasoon Animation released Kuiba. The film borrows from a Japanese \"hot-blooded\" style, refreshing the audience's views on Chinese animation. Kuiba was critically acclaimed; however, it commercially fell below expectations. It was reported that CEO Wu Hanqing received minority help from a venture capital fund at Tsinghua University to complete Kuiba. This film holds distinction as the first big Chinese animation series to enter the Japanese market.\nSee also\n* Wasei-kango\nReferences"
