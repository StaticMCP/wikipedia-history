Main Cross St. in Carmi, Illinois. Built in 1814 by John Craw, the house is the oldest in Carmi and one of the oldest in Illinois. Carmi was founded in an 1816 meeting at the house; the community's early settlers met there to choose the community's name, a reference to a biblical figure, and voted to plat its land. The house also served as White County's courthouse until 1828, when a separate courthouse building was constructed. In 1835, U.S. Senator John McCracken Robinson purchased the house; Robinson lived in the home until his death in 1843.\nThe house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 17, 1973.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~ilwcohs/museums.htm White County Historical Society]"
