These are all conventional names used by historians for convenience in studying Ayutthayan history. The name was derived from the legendary name of Ramathibodi I, who was originally known as \"King Uthong\" (Chao Uthong). However, the true origins of the dynasty remain obscure.\nOrigins\nThe original lineage of this dynasty is an unsolved mystery, leading to several hypothetical names based on the following theories:\n* Theory of northern origins (Chiang Rai dynasty)\n** Based on a royal explanation by King Mongkut (Rama IV) that \"King Uthong was the son-in-law of King Sirichai Chiang Saen, inherited the throne through his wife, reigned for six years, and then moved to establish a new capital at Ayutthaya after a plague broke out.\"\n** The Singhanavati Chronicle, the chronicles of Ngoenyang-Chiang Saen, and the abridged Royal Chronicles by Prince Paramanuchitchinorot state that King Uthong was of the Lao dynasty (Ngoenyang) or Laochangkrat lineage, descended from King Phrom of Chiang Saen.\n** The La Loubère Archives and the Phanarat version of the Royal Chronicles of Ayutthaya state that King Uthong migrated from Chiang Saen.\n** Accounts from Jeremias van Vliet and Guy Tachard note that many Ayutthayans believed King Phrom the Great was an \"ancient king,\" an ancestor of King Uthong, and the founder of the Ayutthaya Kingdom.\n* Theory of migration from the city of Uthong due to a plague\n** This theory posits a southward migration from the north, first settling in Uthong, and then moving to Ayutthaya when a plague struck the city.\n*** This theory has since been dismissed. Archaeological surveys by Manit Vallibhotama found that the city of Uthong had been abandoned nearly 300 years before Ayutthaya was founded, making it impossible for its ruler to have fled a plague at that time.\n* Theory of a connection with the Lavo\n** After the establishment of Ayutthaya in 1350, Chinese documents continued to refer to it as \"Luohu\" (羅渦国), the name for Lavo. This suggests a strong prior connection, further supported by the fact that King Ramesuan was appointed to rule Lavo as the Uparaja (heir).\nAdditionally, the Chronicles of Lan Xang, a Lao chronicle, states that Khun Borom gave birth to seven sons who went on to rule various cities; the fifth son, \"Ngua In,\" was said to have ruled Ayothaya. Another text, Khumue Thut Top, written by an anonymous royal scholar during the Ayutthaya period in 1681, claims that the king was descended from Phra Pathom Suriyanarayaneesuanbophit, whose descendants later migrated to Sukhothai before moving south to build the city of Phetchaburi and later establishing Ayutthaya as the new capital.\nIt has been speculated that the dynasty may have had Lao ancestry, as noted in a royal commentary by King Chulalongkorn (Rama V): \"The ancestry of King Ramathibodi I was of Lao descent, establishing a royal capital in Siam. Various customs likely still had Lao influences.\" Others suggest possible Brahmin ancestry, as after losing power, the dynasty's descendants were not executed, similar to the Brahmins who were exempt from capital punishment under Ayutthayan law. Ultimately, the lineage and origins of this dynasty remain unclear today.\nRise to Power\nRamathibodi I, or King Uthong, was the first monarch of the Uthong dynasty and the founder of the Ayutthaya Kingdom. He reigned for 19 years (March 12, 1350 – 1369) until his death.\nRamesuan, his son and the ruler of Lopburi, ascended the throne as the second king of Ayutthaya in 1369. However, he reigned for only one year before abdicating in favor of his maternal uncle, Borommarachathirat I (Khunluang Pha Ngua), the ruler of Suphanburi. Ramesuan then returned to rule Lopburi. Borommarachathirat I established the Suphannaphum dynasty and reigned for 18 years until his death in 1388. His son, Thong Lan, succeeded him but was quickly overthrown by Ramesuan, who usurped the throne. Thong Lan, after reigning for only seven days, was executed.\nPower thus returned to Ramesuan, who subsequently made many contributions to the Ayutthaya Kingdom in both religion and warfare. He is remembered as a monarch who maintained peace and expanded the kingdom's territory while continuously supporting Buddhism.\nRamesuan passed away in 1395 at the age of 56, having reigned for a total of 8 years over two periods. His son, Ramracha, succeeded him.\nEnd of Power\nRamracha, son of Ramesuan, succeeded to the throne but was later deposed after a conflict with Chao Phraya Maha Senabodi, his chief minister and military commander. The minister fled to Pathakhucham and conspired with Intharacha, who brought forces from Suphanburi to seize Ayutthaya. Intharacha was then invited to take the throne. Ramracha was granted the city of Pathakhucham to rule. He reigned over Ayutthaya for 15 years, and the year of his death is not recorded.\nSome sources suggest Ramracha was exiled by Intharacha to rule Chatomuk. Michael Vickery speculates that King Ramathibodi of Cambodia, the father of Ponhea Yat, was the same person as the \"Phra Ram Chao\" mentioned in an auxiliary royal chronicle, and that this was Ramracha. Vickery further speculates that the city of Chatomuk was the same as Pathakhucham.\nDescendants of the Uthong dynasty were neither punished nor executed after their loss of power. Instead, they may have been elevated to a sacred status. The Lavo-Ayothaya lineage was supported as court priests (Brahmins) to perform royal ceremonies but were stripped of any military power. Women from this lineage often served as royal consorts with the title \"Thao Sri Sudachan,\" one of the four principal consorts of the Ayutthayan king, symbolizing his power extending to the four cardinal directions.\nAttempted Restoration\nAs the Lavo-Ayothaya dynasty maintained a role in the Ayutthayan court through religious ceremonies and by providing royal consorts, they \"waited\" for an opportunity to reclaim their power. During the reign of King Chairachathirat, a woman from this lineage, Mae Yua Sri Sudachan, became his left-rank consort. Her influence grew significantly after she gave birth to a son, Prince Yot Fa, elevating her status above the other consorts. When King Chairachathirat fell ill and died after returning from a military campaign, their son, Yot Fa, was placed on the throne in 1546, with Mae Yua Sri Sudachan acting as regent.\nAfter her husband's death, she began an illicit affair with Phan But Sri Thep (Bun Si), a former palace official, which was a grave violation of the palace law that forbade queens from remarrying. Seeing an opportunity to seize power to protect the throne, she deemed Phan But Sri Thep's faction suitable. She argued that as King Yot Fa was still young and the northern provinces were unstable, Worawongsathirat (her lover's new title) should govern until the king came of age. The nobility consented. Once Worawongsathirat was in power, he had the young King Yot Fa executed at Wat Khok Phraya. Notably, Burmese chronicles from this period name the ruler of Ayutthaya as the \"Chief Queen,\" referring to Thao Sri Sudachan herself.\nUltimately, her restoration of power was short-lived. A group of senior nobles who opposed her rule, led by Khun Phirenthorathep (later King Maha Thammaracha), conspired to capture and execute both Worawongsathirat and Mae Yua Sri Sudachan, along with their daughter. Their bodies were publicly displayed at Wat Raeng.\nList of Monarchs\nBased on historical evidence from legends and chronicles, it is believed that the \"Uthong dynasty\" represented a kinship between the cities of Lopburi and Suphanburi. However, the dynasty's origins remain ambiguous. There were three monarchs from the Uthong dynasty:\n{| width=100% class=\"wikitable\"\n!style=\"background-color:#F0DC82\" width=5%|No.\n! style=\"background-color:#F0DC82\" width=30% | Name\n! style=\"background-color:#F0DC82\" width=10% | Born\n! style=\"background-color:#F0DC82\" width=10% | Reign Began\n! style=\"background-color:#F0DC82\" width=10% | Reign Ended\n! style=\"background-color:#F0DC82\" width=10% | Died\n! style=\"background-color:#F0DC82\" width=20% | Reign Duration\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|align=\"center\"| Ramathibodi I (King Uthong)\n|align=\"center\"|1314\n|align=\"center\"|1350\n|align=\"center\" colspan=2|1369\n|align=\"center\"|19 years\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|2 (1st reign)\n|align=\"center\"|Ramesuan\n|align=\"center\"|1342\n|align=\"center\"|1369\n|align=\"center\"|1370\n|align=\"center\"|1395\n|align=\"center\"|1 year\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|2 (2nd reign)\n|align=\"center\"|Ramesuan\n|align=\"center\"|1342\n|align=\"center\"|1388\n|align=\"center\" colspan=2|1395\n|align=\"center\"|7 years\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|3\n|align=\"center\"|Ramracha\n|align=\"center\"|1356\n|align=\"center\"|1395\n|align=\"center\" colspan=2|1409\n|align=\"center\"|15 years\n|-\n|}\nFamily Tree\nReferences\nSee also\n* List of monarchs of Thailand"
