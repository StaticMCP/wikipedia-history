Stern. Filming took place in New Orleans. The first trailer was released in September 2011.\nPlot\nWill Gerard is a humble high school English teacher in New Orleans. His wife Laura is a cellist  who plays in a local orchestra. After a performance one evening, Laura is beaten and brutally raped by a stranger named Hodge.\nWill rushes to the hospital to see Laura. There, a stranger who calls himself Simon tells Will that he represents an organization that deals with criminals who have evaded the justice system, and that Hodge, who had raped three other women before, had been paroled shortly before his attack on Laura. Simon offers to have someone make Hodge pay for Laura's rape, in exchange for a favor from Will to be determined later. A distraught and grief-stricken Will consents to the deal, knowing this will spare Laura a drawn-out trial that would prolong her suffering. That night, Hodge is killed and a picture of Hodge's body, along with a necklace that Hodge took from Laura during the rape, are sent to Will as proof. The organization's code phrase is \"The hungry rabbit jumps\".\nSix months later, Simon returns to ask Will to repay the favor. He wants Will to follow a woman and her two children and to look out for a man, whom Simon deems a sex offender. Will initially complies, until Simon demands that Will kill the man on a pedestrian walkway under a high overpass, by \"accidentally\" bumping him off it to his death, making it look like suicide. Will becomes increasingly paranoid and earns a suspension from Jimmy, his best friend and the school's principal, after hitting a rebellious student. Fearing retaliation from Simon, Will reluctantly agrees to his demand, but intends to question the target about Simon instead of killing him. The man, already paranoid and suspicious of Will, attacks him: Will dodges his attacks, causing the man to fall to his death.\nWill runs home, where Detectives Rudeski and Green arrest him for murdering the man, whose name is Alan Marsh. At the station, Will fails to convince the detectives of his innocence. Their boss, Lieutenant Durgan, has a private meeting with Will, where he reveals himself as a member of Simon's organization and allows Will to escape, giving him 24 hours to leave the city before Simon comes looking for him. At a memorial for Alan, Will discovers that he was not a sex offender, but actually an award-winning reporter who was investigating the vigilante organization. Will realizes the organization is prepared to kill innocent people who become a threat to its existence. Simon and his henchmen Scar and Cancer arrive and give chase to Will, who escapes as Scar is accidentally killed by a speeding SUV. After Laura finds the necklace that had been returned to Will, he explains to her what is happening and advises her not to cooperate with the police or anyone asking questions.\nWill retrieves a DVD from a storage facility that Alan used, which documents Alan's findings about the vigilantes. He learns that Jimmy joined the organization years ago after his brother was murdered and the killer could not be found, and that Simon's real name is Eugene Cook. Will offers Cook to trade the disc with the stolen security camera footage that proves his innocence in Alan's death. They agree to meet at the Louisiana Superdome during a monster truck show.\nAt the dome, Simon reveals he has kidnapped Laura to ensure Will keeps his side of the deal. They go to a nearby abandoned mall, where a bound-and-gagged Laura is being held at gunpoint by Cancer, Jimmy ― who claims he had no choice but to turn Laura in ― and a man named Sideburns. Will gives up the disc, but Cook reneges on the deal and orders both Will and Laura killed to tie all loose ends. Jimmy relents and kills Cancer, whereupon a struggle ensues, where Sideburns dies and Jimmy is fatally shot by Cook, who then loses his gun as Will engages in a fistfight with him. Laura manages to free herself and grabs Cook's gun, which she uses to kill Cook.\nAs Will and Laura walk away, Durgan arrives and promises to arrange the crime scene to make it look like they were not present and the dead merely killed each other. The walkway camera footage is released, proving Will acted in self-defense and clearing him of any wrongdoing. With the disc still in hand, Will decides to follow up on Alan's work by giving it to Gibbs, a reporter whom Will met at Alan's memorial. Thanking him, Gibbs says, \"The hungry rabbit jumps, eh?\", indicating his involvement with the vigilante organization to a surprised Will.\nCast\n* Nicolas Cage as Will Gerard\n* January Jones as Laura Gerard\n* Guy Pearce as Simon\n* Harold Perrineau as Jimmy\n* Jennifer Carpenter as Trudy\n* Xander Berkeley as Lieutenant Durgan\n* IronE Singleton as \"Scar\"\n* Cullen Moss as Jones\n* Marcus Lyle Brown as Detective Green\n* Dikran Tulaine as \"Sideburns\"\n* Jason Davis as Alan Marsh\nRelease\nBox office\nThe film opened at #27 at the US box office, taking $249,912 during its first weekend.
