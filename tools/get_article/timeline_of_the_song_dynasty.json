The Song dynasty was founded by Zhao Kuangyin, posthumously known as Emperor Taizu of Song, who ended the period of division known as the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. The Song dynasty is commonly separated into two historical periods, the Northern Song (960–1127) and the Southern Song (1127–1278), divided by the loss of the north to the Jurchen Jin dynasty (1115–1234). In 1279, the Mongol Yuan dynasty conquered the Song.\n10th century\n960s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n! style=\"width:6%\" | Year || style=\"width:10%\" | Date || Event\n|-\n| 960 || February || Zhao Kuangyin declares himself Emperor Taizu of Song, replacing Later Zhou\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\" | 963 || || Song conquers tang\n|-\n| || Song dynasty introduces the appointment by protection system, which allows high officials to nominate their sons, grandsons, and nephews for the civil service\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\" | 965 || || Song conquest of Later Shu: Song conquers Later Shu\n|-\n| || Tao Gu provides the first written documentation of using cormorants for fishing\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\" | 967 || || Long Yanyao of Nanning, the Yang clan of Bo Prefecture, and the Tian clan of Si Prefecture submit to the Song dynasty in return for their autonomy\n|-\n| || Song dynasty recognizes the Bole of the Luodian kingdom, the Mangbu of the Badedian kingdom, and the Awangren of the Yushi kingdom\n|-\n| 968 || || Vietnamese king Đinh Bộ Lĩnh of the Đinh dynasty unites the kingdom and renames it to Đại Cồ Việt\n|-\n| 969 || || Gunpowder propelled fire arrows, rocket arrows, are invented by Yue Yifang and Feng Jisheng.\n|}\n970s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n!
