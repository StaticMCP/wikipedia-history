He was the youngest child of Chai and Noi Suphaiyat, with five siblings. Because he was the youngest, he was named “Khamla.”\nAt the age of nine, after falling ill, his parents entrusted him to Khruba Siwichai at Wat Chiang Yuen, Chiang Rai, where he studied under his guidance.\nOrdination\nKhruba Siwichai ordained him as a novice at Wat Chiang Yuen around 1927. After completing elementary education, he studied at Samakkhi Witthayakhom School until Mathayom 2 (secondary year 2) before leaving. He later earned the Nak Tham Tri (junior ecclesiastical studies) at Wat Chet Yot, Chiang Rai, and also studied the Lanna script for three years.\nHe was ordained as a monk on 28 December 1938 at Wat Mung Muang, Chiang Rai, with Phra Khru Phutthisanawet (Haet Thewawango), the provincial ecclesiastical head, as his preceptor. He received the monastic name Sangwaro. His practices mirrored those of Khruba Siwichai, such as abstaining from meat, eating one meal a day, frequent wandering ascetic practices (dhutanga), and temple building.\nHe built and restored more than 20 religious sites across Chiang Rai, Phayao, and Nan provinces, including temples, chedis, and schools. In 1953, he studied vipassanā meditation for three months at Wat Mahathat in Bangkok under Phra Phimontham (Asabhamahathera).\nRestoration works\nAmong his major works were:\n* Restoration of Wat Phra That Doi Chom Sak Sangwararam, Chiang Rai\n* Restoration of Phra That Doi Khao Kwai, Chiang Rai\n* Chedi of Wat Phra That Chom Thong, Thoeng District\n* Wat Phra That Chom Cho, Thoeng District, Chiang Rai\n* Phra That Si Maha Pho, Wat Phra Si Maha Pho, Thoeng District\n* Den La Chom Sawan Chedi, Khun Tan District, Chiang Rai\n* Wat Ku Kaeo Chedi, Mae Chan District\n* Wat Phra That Pu Lan, Phaya Mengrai District\n* Chedis and vihāras in Phayao and Nan, including Wat Na Nun in Nan Province.\nHe also built public works such as the bridge across the Phung River in Pa Daet District, Chiang Rai.\nPassing\nLater in life, Khruba Khamla resided in the remote Khun Huai Suat Hermitage, Chiang Kham District, Phayao Province, to focus on practice. In late 1989, he fell ill with intestinal inflammation and was hospitalized in Chiang Rai and Phayao. He died peacefully at Chiang Rai Prachanukroh Hospital on 8 January 1990, aged 71. His cremation took place at Khun Huai Suat Hermitage on 28 March 1992.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.relicsofbuddha.com/marahun/page8-2-50.htm Khruba Khamla Sangwaro, Khun Huai Suat Hermitage, Phayao Province] (archived 2013)\n* [http://www.pralanna.com/boardpage.php?topicid=12741 Khruba Khamla Sangwaro]"
