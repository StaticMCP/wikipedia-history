The awards highlight exemplary service in wildlife protection, biodiversity conservation, anti-poaching operations and community engagement. In 2025, the programme expanded with additional categories and wider participation.\nBackground\nThe establishment of the awards aligns with international conservation practices that recognise the risks faced by protected-area staff. A 2025 study in the journal PARKS emphasised the importance of acknowledging rangers as conservation ambassadors in Pakistan, particularly in mountainous and remote regions.\nOrganisation and partners\nThe awards are organised by the Ministry of Climate Change & Environmental Coordination (MoCC&EC) in collaboration with the Snow Leopard Foundation (Pakistan). Supporting partners include the Snow Leopard Trust, the UK Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, and provincial forest and wildlife departments from Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The inaugural ceremony was held on 31 July 2024, World Ranger Day, at the Pakistan National Council of the Arts in Islamabad.\nAward categories and selection\nThe programme features several species-themed categories that symbolise Pakistan's iconic mountain wildlife. Core categories include:\n* Snow Leopard Award\n* Ibex Award\n* Blue Sheep Award\n* Markhor Award\n* Wolf Award\n* Musk Deer Award\nIn 2025, a Brown Bear Award was also introduced, and one category was reserved specifically for community recognition. Nominations are reviewed by the National Committee for the Citizen-Ranger Wildlife Protection Programme.\nThe initiative complements the Citizen Ranger Wildlife Protection Programme, launched by the Snow Leopard Trust in 2024 to empower and recognise field staff across Pakistan's snow leopard range.\nRecipients\n2024\nSix individuals from Gilgit–Baltistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Azad Jammu and Kashmir received the first set of awards:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Pakistan Wildlife Protection Awards 2024\n!
