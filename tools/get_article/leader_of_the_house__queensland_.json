The office is held by a member of the Ministry; until 2009, the office was always held by a Cabinet minister, but Judy Spence held the office as parliamentary secretary. Under changes made in October 2011, the office was given a salary greater than its holder would otherwise earn by virtue of his or her other ministerial office. The Leader of the House is the Chair of the Committee of the Legislative Assembly, which has responsibility for the efficient management of the Queensland Parliament.\nList of Leaders\n{| class=wikitable\n! colspan=2 | Leader\n!
