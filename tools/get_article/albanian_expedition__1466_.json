However, when the Ottoman-Venetian war began that same year, Skanderbeg, amidst the Pope's objections, broke the peace treaty and launched attacks against the Ottomans. Mehmed II then commissioned Balaban Pasha to launch raids into Albania. Balaban Pasha initially achieved a few victories, but was defeated in 1465. Yakup Pasha was subsequently killed. The sultan then personally ordered an expedition against Albania. He gathered his armies and set out for Albania.\nCampaign\nIn the spring of 1466, the Turkish army marched towards Albania under the command of Mehmed the Conqueror himself. When the army entered Albania, the Albanians abandoned their positions and retreated to the tops of steep mountains and narrow straits that were difficult to climb and took up defensive positions. Ottomans successful raided Skanderberg's army, which had fled into the harsh mountains, and put many to the sword. Villages were also plundered and thousands were taken captive.\nReferences\nSources\n* Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time, Franz Babinger, ‎William C.
