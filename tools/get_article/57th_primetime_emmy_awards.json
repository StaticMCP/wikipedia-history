The ceremony was broadcast on CBS. BBC America received its first major nomination this year.\nThe ceremony, which aired three weeks after Hurricane Katrina hit, featured a mini-telethon for Habitat for Humanity and gave DeGeneres more opportunity to use the ceremony to somberly remember the victims of the Gulf Coast. Opening the ceremony was the famous 1970s band Earth, Wind & Fire with a comedic version of \"September\", in collaboration with The Black Eyed Peas. The ceremony featured tributes to ABC-TV anchor Peter Jennings (who died six weeks earlier) presented by rival anchors Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw, and to talk show host Johnny Carson (who died on January 23, 2005) by close friend and Late Show host David Letterman. Also, the show featured Emmy Idol, five segments in which famous TV stars performed popular TV theme songs in a format like American Idol.\nEverybody Loves Raymond became the first comedy to have its final season win the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series since Barney Miller in 1982. The CBS comedy series also tied for the lead in major nominations and wins with ten and three, respectively. Freshman series Desperate Housewives became just the second series to earn three nominations in a lead acting category, joining The Golden Girls which had three nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for four separate years. In the drama field, new series Lost won Outstanding Drama Series.\nActress Angela Lansbury received her eighteenth and final nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series. However, she failed to win causing her record losing streak to be extended. Lansbury died on October 11, 2022.\nWinners and nominees\nWinners are listed first and highlighted in bold:\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program winner]]\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Everybody Loves Raymond (CBS) '\n** Arrested Development (Fox)\n** Desperate Housewives (ABC)\n** Scrubs (NBC)\n** Will & Grace (NBC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Lost (ABC) '\n** 24 (Fox)\n** Deadwood (HBO)\n** Six Feet Under (HBO)\n** The West Wing (NBC)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Warm Springs (HBO) '\n** Lackawanna Blues (HBO)\n** The Life and Death of Peter Sellers (HBO)\n** The Office: \"Christmas Special\" (BBC America)\n** The Wool Cap (TNT)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'The Lost Prince (PBS) '\n** The 4400 (USA)\n** Elvis (CBS)\n** Empire Falls (HBO)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'The Daily Show with Jon Stewart (Comedy Central) '\n** Da Ali G Show (HBO)\n** ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien (NBC)\n** Late Show with David Letterman (CBS)\n** Real Time with Bill Maher (HBO)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'The Amazing Race (CBS)'\n** American Idol (Fox)\n** The Apprentice (NBC)\n** Project Runway (Bravo)\n** Survivor (CBS)\n|}\nActing\nLead performances\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Tony Shalhoub – Monk as Adrian Monk (USA) '\n** Jason Bateman – Arrested Development as Michael Bluth (Fox)\n** Zach Braff – Scrubs as Dr. John \"J.D.\" Dorian (NBC)\n** Eric McCormack – Will & Grace as Will Truman (NBC)\n** Ray Romano – Everybody Loves Raymond as Ray Barone (CBS) (Episode: “The Power of No”)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Felicity Huffman – Desperate Housewives as Lynette Scavo (ABC)' (Episode: \"Pilot\")\n** Marcia Cross – Desperate Housewives as Bree Van de Kamp (ABC) (Episode: “Running to Stand Still”)\n** Teri Hatcher – Desperate Housewives as Susan Mayer (ABC) (Episode: “Move On”)\n** Patricia Heaton – Everybody Loves Raymond as Debra Barone (CBS) (Episode: “The Finale”)\n** Jane Kaczmarek – Malcolm in the Middle as Lois (Fox) (Episode: “Lois vs Jaime”)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'James Spader – Boston Legal as Alan Shore (ABC)'\n** Hank Azaria – Huff as Craig Huffstodt (Showtime)\n** Hugh Laurie – House as Dr. Gregory House (Fox)\n** Ian McShane – Deadwood as Al Swearengen (HBO)\n** Kiefer Sutherland – 24 as Jack Bauer (Fox)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Patricia Arquette – Medium as Allison DuBois (NBC) '\n** Glenn Close – The Shield as Monica Rawling (FX)\n** Frances Conroy – Six Feet Under as Ruth Fisher (HBO)\n** Jennifer Garner – Alias as Sydney Bristow (ABC)\n** Mariska Hargitay – Law & Order: Special Victims Unit as Olivia Benson (NBC)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Geoffrey Rush – The Life and Death of Peter Sellers as Peter Sellers (HBO) '\n** Kenneth Branagh – Warm Springs as Franklin D.
