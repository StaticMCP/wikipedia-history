In 1933, Warren joined Johnny & Jack and the Tennessee Mountain Boys, with whom he appeared regularly on the Grand Ole Opry. During that time he recorded a number of sides with Kitty Wells, including ''It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels and Release Me''.\nHe joined Flatt and Scruggs and the Foggy Mountain Boys in 1954, after fifteen years with the Tennessee Mountain Boys. As a member of that band, he was often called upon in concert segments featuring traditional fiddle tunes, including a number of the Arthur Smith tunes which had been recorded by Flatt and Scruggs, such as \"Pig in the Pen\".\nWhen Flatt and Scruggs broke up in 1969, Warren decided to stay with Lester Flatt's band.  In 1978 CMH Records released America.\nLegacy\nWarren helped perpetuate the old-time fiddle style typified by Arthur Smith, and has been cited by a number of musicians as an influence, including fiddler Andrea Zonn and mandolin player Roland White.  His son Johnny Warren continues to play his repertoire.  In 2009 and 2011, Johnny recorded two albums featuring noted bluegrass musicians, ''A Tribute to Fiddlin' Paul Warren Vols. 1 and 2'' on which he played tunes for which is father was well known.\nAwards and honors\nWarren was inducted into the Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame in 2013.\nReferences"
