      "text": "# Fu Jing (Shang dynasty)\n\nFu Jing was a Shang dynasty queen of Wu Ding and recipient of the Houmuwu sacrificial vessel.\nBiography\nAlthough Wu Ding reportedly had over 60 wives, he had only three queens: Fu Jing, Fu Hao, and Fu Gui (). Like Wu Ding's other wives, Fu Jing participated in military expeditions and divined for the state. Some of the divinations Fu Jing conducted focused on procuring millet, so Zheng Zhenxiang has suggested that she was responsible for agricultural management. Fu Jing is often referred to in the oracle bones as Biwu ().\nSee also\n*Women in ancient and imperial China\nReferences"
