Riders are judged based upon the height of their jumps, variety of tricks, and style.\nThe competition began in 2000 at Ho‘okipa, a beach known for windsurfing in Maui, Hawaii. After an 8-year hiatus, the competition was relaunched in 2013 in Big Bay Cape Town, South Africa, where it has been held annually since. The event is attended by over 7,000 people per day. From 2018, the event was moved from Big Bay to Blouberg. In 2021 the King of the Air was rescheduled to a November/December wind window due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the event has kept to these date since; originally the event ran in January/February.\nIn 2024, it was announced that Red Bull would be running a Women's Division fleet for King of the Air alongside the usual Open Division fleet. The Open Division would still run with 18 riders whilst the Women's Division would have just 6.\nWinners\nOpen Division Winners (2013 - Present)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
