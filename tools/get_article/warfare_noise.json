The album features four Brazilian heavy metal bands: Chakal, Mutilator, Sarcófago, and Holocausto. A follow-up album titled Warfare Noise II was also released through Cogumelo Records in 1988. The record served as the debut for Sarcófago, and their appearance on the album ultimately led to them being signed to Cogumelo - their first label. In 2006, a one-off concert featuring Sarcófago was organized by Cogumelo and bass player Geraldo Minelli in celebration of the album's 20th anniversary.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n;Chakal\n* Willian Wizdrums\n* Markguitar\n* Vladimir Korgvocals\n* Destroyerbass\n;Mutilator\n* Alexander \"Magoo\"lead guitar\n* Kleberrhythm guitar\n* Ricardo Nevesbass\n* Rodrigo Nevesdrums\n* Silvio SDNvocals\n;Sarcófago\n* Wagner Moura Lamouniervocals\n* Geraldo \"Gerald Incubus\" Minellibass\n* Zéder \"Butcher\"guitar\n* Armando \"Leprous\" Sampaiodrums\n;Holocausto\n* Valério \"Exterminator\"guitar\n* Anderson \"Guerrilheiro\"bass\n* Nedson \"Warfare\"drums\n* Rodrigo \"Führer\"vocals\nProduction\n*Ibsenartwork\n*Tarso Senraengineering\n*Patti Creusa Pereira De Fariaphotography\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
