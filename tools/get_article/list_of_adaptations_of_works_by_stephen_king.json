The musical was revived at the Lucille Lortel Theatre in New York, directed by Stafford Arima from January to April 2012. On September 25, 2012, the first official cast recording was released.\n*1990: Ghost Stories'' was an adaptation of Stephen King's short stories \"The Return of Timmy Baterman,\" about zombies; \"Strawberry Spring,\" about a campus serial killer; \"Gray Matter,\" a black comedy about a hideous mutation caused by a bottle of beer; \"Uncle Otto's Truck,\" and \"The Boogeyman,\" about a distraught father's encounter with a child-killing closet monster, as well as selections from Pet Sematary. Adapted and directed by Robert Pridham, the play premiered at the Arts Center Theatre at Kent Place School in Summit, New Jersey, and toured the United States in the mid-1990s.\n*1992: Misery stage play by Simon Moore based on 1987 novel. Another adaptation, written by William Goldman (who wrote the 1990 film), premiered on Broadway in 2015 with Bruce Willis and Laurie Metcalf. This version was also adapted to Polish language. It premiered at the Kwadrat Theatre in Warsaw in 2017. A musical version also exists, written by Jeff Hockhauser and Bob Johnson. While it has not been staged, a demo recording has circulated on the internet in recent years. There are also four Finnish-language stage adaptations of Misery under the name Piina: the first adaptation was performed in October 2019 by Tampere Theatre in Tampere, the second adaptation was performed in September of the same year by Kuopio City Theatre in Kuopio, the third adaptation was performed in November 2022 by Pori Theatre in Pori, and the fourth adaptation was performed in February 2025 by Seinäjoki City Theatre in Seinäjoki.\n*1993: Rage stage play written by Phillip Smith, produced by Shane Black, and directed by Jim Birge. It was intended to premiere in Jasper, Indiana, but scheduling and venue issues due to protests over its mature themes forced it to move to the American Legion hall in Santa Claus, Indiana, where it ran from April 23 to May 1.\n*2009: Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption was dramatized by Dave Johns and Owen O'Neill for the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin. A later version, directed by Peter Sheridan, had its world premiere at the Peter Sheridan Theatre in London in September 2010. A production was mounted at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe directed by Lucy Pitman-Wallace in August 2013. In April 2019, The Shawshank Redemption made its North American debut at the Metropolitan Ensemble Theatre in Kansas City, Missouri, directed by Bob Paisley. It garnered great reviews from critics during its run. It featured Keenan Ramos as Red, Chris Roady as Andy Defresne, S.E. Perry as Warden Stammas, Tim Ahlenius as Hadley, Chad Burris as Boggs Diamond, Dan Daly as Pinky, Kevin Fewell as Brooksie, Christopher Preyer as Rooster, Larry Goodman as Dawkins, Nick Hazel as Entwhistle, Evan Lovelace as Tommy, Andrew Paredes as Rico, and Alex Paxton as inmate/guard.\n*2012: Ghost Brothers of Darkland County, an original musical with book by Stephen King and music and lyrics by John Mellencamp. After a week of previews, it ran at Atlanta's Alliance Theatre from April 11 to May 13, 2012. A concept album was released the following year.\n*2013: Dolores Claiborne is an American opera composed by Tobias Picker. It premiered at the San Francisco Opera in Fall 2013. Before that, the novel was also made into a couple of Finnish plays, both called Doloreksen tunnustus: in 2009 presented by Tukkateatteri, and in 2012 presented by Ad Astra Teatteri.\n*2014: The Body (also known as \"Stand By Me\") was produced by Chellaston Players in Derby, England. Though an amateur staging (produced with Stephen King's permission), it received rave reviews.\nThere have also been dramatizations of many of King's short stories, including \"Nona\", \"Quitters, Inc.\", \"In the Deathroom\", \"Strawberry Spring\", \"Harvey's Dream\", \"The Man Who Loved Flowers\", \"Mute\", \"The Ten O'Clock People\" and King's poem, \"Paranoid: A Chant\".
