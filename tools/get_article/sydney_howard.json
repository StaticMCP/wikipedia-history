Despite his popularity in the 1920s and 1930s films he appeared in, Howard is almost totally forgotten today. His most revived film is When We Are Married, in which he played a drunken photographer.\nIn 1937, British exhibitors voted him the 10th most popular British star at the box office.\nFilmography\n* Splinters (1929)\n* French Leave (1930)\n* Tilly of Bloomsbury (1931)\n* Up for the Cup (1931)\n* Splinters in the Navy (1931)\n* Almost a Divorce (1931)\n* The Mayor's Nest (1932)\n* Trouble (1933)\n* Up for the Derby (1933)\n* Night of the Garter (1933)\n* It's a King (1933)\n* It's a Cop (1934)\n* Girls, Please!
