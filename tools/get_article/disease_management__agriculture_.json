Crops can also suffer from ectoparasites including insects, mites, snails, slugs, and vertebrate animals, but these are not considered diseases.\nControlling diseases can be achieved by resistance genes, fungicides, nematicides, quarantine, etc. Disease management can be a large part of farm operating costs.\nSee also\n* Corn smut\n* Great Irish Famine\n* Blight\nReferences"
