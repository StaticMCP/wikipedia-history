It is one of its county's two seats of government. The population was 28,676 at the time of the 2020 census. It is the third largest city in Northern Kentucky after Covington and Florence, and is part of the Cincinnati metropolitan area.\nHistory\n.]]\nThe area post office was established by Isaac Everett in 1837 as \"Everett's Creek\"; in 1838, this was changed to \"Crews Creek\" (presumably after the present Cruises Creek that is south of the city); in 1839, Thomas Hordern renamed it \"Bagby\".\nIn 1840, Kenton was formed from Campbell and Boone counties. Local farmer John McCollum donated a site at the center of the new county to be its seat of governance, and the name \"Independence\" was chosen to honor the liberation of locals from Campbell County. The post office was renamed the same year. Quickly settled, Independence was formally incorporated by the state assembly in 1842.\nBecause the majority of the county's population resided along the Ohio River, Independence was eventually obliged to share its status as county seat with the larger city of Covington, a situation later repeated in Campbell County between the centrally located Alexandria and the larger, riverside Newport.\nGeography\nIndependence is located in central Kenton County. It is bordered to the northwest by Elsmere, to the north by Erlanger and Covington, and to the northeast by Ryland Heights. The western border of Independence follows the Boone County line, and the city of Florence in Boone County borders the far northwestern end of Independence.\nThe original center of Independence is in the southeast part of the city, along Madison Pike. Kentucky Route 17, a four-lane divided highway, passes just east of the city center, leading north  to downtown Covington and south  to Falmouth.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, Independence has a total area of , of which  are land and , or 1.45%, are water. Banklick Creek, a northeast-flowing tributary of the Licking River, is the largest stream in the city, draining most of the area within the city limits.\nDemographics\n| footnote = U.S. Decennial Census\n}}\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 14,982 people, 5,181 households, and 4,149 families residing in the city.
