Before his partnership with Fordyce, Upcott was in partnership with Mark Fyson, who retired in 2009 after the pair had won the bronze medal in the 2008 world championships in Glasgow. With his new partner Adam McAssey, Upcott was awarded the silver medal in the 2012 Acrobatic Gymnastics World Championships.\nUpcott came to UK national public attention with his membership of the gymnastic group Spelbound, who rose to fame in 2010, winning the fourth series of ''Britain's Got Talent''. Part of their performance was a spectacular throw of Upcott over the heads of the judges, catching him in the main performance area. The prize was £100,000 and the opportunity to appear at the 2010 Royal Variety Performance.\nWith Spelbound, Upcott holds the world record for 'Highest throw and catch of a person', where he was the person thrown and caught. The successful record attempt was televised on the UK children's TV show Blue Peter.\nUpcott left Spelbound in 2012 to pursue other avenues. While still a member, he was cast as a stunt double for Asa Butterfield in Hugo. He works with Doug Fordyce as Brothers of Eden. His stated ambition is to be part of Cirque du Soleil.\nPersonal life\nUpcott was educated at The Magna Carta School in Surrey.\nA long-term asthmatic, Upcott has learned how to control this such that it has no impact on his sporting endeavours. His official biography states that, as a child, he nearly died during his first asthma attack.\nHis younger siblings, Alice and Adam are also acrobatic gymnasts.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*"
