A single award for Best Documentary was handed out from 1958–2008, before it was split into three categories: Best Feature Length Documentary, Best Documentary Under One Hour and Best Documentary Series. The award is presented at the AACTA Awards Luncheon, a black tie event which celebrates achievements in film production, television, documentaries and short films.\nWinners and nominees\nIn the following table, winners are listed first, in boldface and highlighted in gold; those listed below the winner that are not in boldface or highlighted are the nominees.\nAFI Awards (2009-2010)\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"30%\" | Film\n! width=\"25%\" | Producer(s)\n! width=\"10%\" | Network\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| align=\"center\" | 2009(51st)\n| Solo\n| Jennifer Peedom\n| ABC1\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2009(51st)\n| The Love Market\n| Shalom Almond\n| National Geographic Channel\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2009(51st)\n| Salt\n| Michael Angus\n| ABC\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2009(51st)\n| Tackling Peace\n| Mark Radomsky\n| Network Ten\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| align=\"center\" | 2010(52nd)\n| You Only Live Twice - The Incredibly True Story of the Hughes Family\n| Ruth Cullen\n| ABC1\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2010(52nd)\n| A Thousand Encores: The Ballets Russes in Australia\n| Sharyn Prentice, Marianne Latham and Lavinia Riachi\n| ABC\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2010(52nd)\n| Rudely Interrupted\n| Susie Jones and Benjamin Jones\n| ABC1\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2010(52nd)\n| Surviving Mumbai\n| Andrew Ogilvie and Andrea Quesnelle\n| ABC\n|-\n|}\nAACTA Awards (2012)\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"30%\" | Film\n! width=\"25%\" | Producer(s)\n! width=\"10%\" | Network\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| align=\"center\" | 2011(1st)\n| 'Jandamarra's War\n| Andrew Ogilvie, Andrea Quesnelle and Eileen Torres\n| ABC1'\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2011(1st)\n| The Ball\n| Yael Bergman, Laura Waters and Jessica Leski\n| ABC1\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2011(1st)\n| Leaky Boat\n| Penny Chapman\n| ABC1\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2011(1st)\n| Orchids: My Intersex Adventure\n| Phoebe Hart\n| ABC\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n*AACTA Awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.aacta.org The Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts Official website]"
