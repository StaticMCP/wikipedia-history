The Missouri primary was an open primary, with the state awarding 92 delegates  towards the 2000 Democratic National Convention, of which 75 were pledged delegates allocated on the basis of the results of the primary.\nVice president Al Gore had won the primary by a landslide, taking around 64% of the vote, winning every county in the state but Jefferson and Ste. Genevieve, and gaining 51 delegates, while senator Bill Bradley received almost 34% of the vote and 24 delegates. Jefferson County is the site of Crystal City, where Bradley was born and raised.\nProcedure\nMissouri was one of 15 states and one territory holding primaries on Super Tuesday.\nVoting took place throughout the state from 6:00&nbsp;a.m. until 7:00&nbsp;p.m. In the open primary, candidates had to meet a threshold of 15 percent at the congressional district or statewide level in order to be considered viable. The 75 pledged delegates to the 2000 Democratic National Convention were allocated proportionally on the basis of the results of the primary. Of these, between five and six were allocated to each of the state's eight congressional districts and another nine were allocated to party leaders and elected officials (PLEO delegates), in addition to 15 at-large delegates.\nFollowing ward, township, legislative district, and county mass meetings on March 30, 2000, during which district and state convention delegates were designated, district conventions on April 27, 2000, chose national convention district delegates. At the meeting of the Democratic state committee on May 6, 2000, the nine pledged PLEO delegates were voted on, while the 15 pledged at-large delegates were selected at the subsequent state convention on May 13, 2000. The delegation also included 15 unpledged PLEO delegates: nine members of the Democratic National Committee, five representatives from Congress (Bill Clay, Dick Gephardt, Ike Skelton, Karen McCarthy, and Pat Danner), the governor Mel Carnahan, and two add-ons.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;float:none;padding:5px;\"\n! colspan=\"2\"| Pledged nationalconvention delegates\n|-\n!
