Cuttalosa Road crosses over the stream five times.\nEtymology\nThe name Cuttalosa was derived from the Lenape name Quatalossi for their village nearby.\nGeology\nCuttalosa Creek lies on the Stockton Formation, a layer of bedrock consisting of light-gray to light brown sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone, laid down in the Late Triassic.\nHistory\nAt one time, the Lenape occupied a village in the valley. Later, there were several mills along the creek. One was built by Samuel Armitage in 1752 which operated until his descendant, Amos Armitage, closed the mill in 1929.\nMunicipalities\n*Bucks County\n**Solebury Township\nCrossings and Bridges\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
