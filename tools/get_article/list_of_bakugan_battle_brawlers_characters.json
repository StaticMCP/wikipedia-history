      "text": "# List of Bakugan Battle Brawlers characters\n\nThis is a list of characters from the Japanese anime series Bakugan Battle Brawlers.\nMain characters\nBattle Brawlers\nDan Kuso\n|Scott McCord}}\nDaniel Kuso (known in the Japanese version as  and nicknamed ) is the main human protagonist in the series, who is 12 years old (11 in the Japanese dub) in the first season, 14 in New Vestroia, 16 in Gundalian Invaders, and 17 in Mechtanium Surge. In the beginning, he is ranked #117, and by episode 39, he is ranked #1 and has become ranked #4 or under in episode 6 of Mechtanium Surge.  It is revealed in episode 5 that he lives not too far from Runo. In episode 32, a flashback revealed that he knew Runo from when he was little, but didn't realize it until later. It is heavily hinted that he has feelings for Runo (and vice versa) but no relationship forms.\nIn New Vestroia, Dan returns to New Vestroia to help Drago save the world from the invading Vestals. Despite having just been introduced to the new Brawling system, Dan manages to get the hang of it before he battles his way into the Resistance by tying with Ace. He returns to Earth, following Spectra, Gus, and Lync into a portal with Mira and Baron. After losing Drago to Spectra in episode 16, his determination to get him back pays off as he and Drago reunite in episode 18. At the end of episode 19, he and Baron go back to New Vestroia through Dr. Gehabich's dimension transporter. In episode 20 he and Baron make it back to New Vestroia where they battle Mylene and Shadow in Beta City where they defeat them when Drago unleashes the power of the Perfect Core. In episode 26, he goes back to Earth, along with Marucho, Shun and the rest of the Bakugan. Various portals open up across the world, allowing all the other brawlers to reunite with their Bakugan.\nAfter the destruction of the BT System, Dan and the Brawlers find out, with Lync Volan's help, that King Zenoheld is constructing a machine called the Alternative Weapon System which could destroy both Earth and Vestal. Dan along with the rest of the resistance attempt to stop the alternative through any means necessary. At the end of New Vestroia, he destroys the alternative weapon system with the help of his friends and allies. In Gundalian Invaders, Dan, Marucho, Shun, Jake, and Ren join Fabia in fighting an oncoming invasion of the evil Gundalians who want to rule over Neathia and have control over the Sacred Orb. In Mechtanium Surge, he and Drago have a problem controlling the new powers they were given by Code eve, and can sometimes be taken over by Mag Mel and Razenoid and spawn Zenthon, a Mechtogan, which they eventually tame while in New Vestroia, after they returned to New Vestroia to control their new powers. They were number one in Bakugan Interspace until they were disqualified for using Zenthon accidentally when battling Anubias for the number one position. Dan later regained the title of Leader of the Brawlers after he apologized to the rest of the Brawlers minus Spectra.\nHe has a good relationship with his parents. His mom is a big yoga fan, while his dad is obsessed with pudding and has a personality similar to Dan's, only he's a little more clueless. It is possible that Dan plays the guitar; in earlier episodes you can see a Fender Telecaster in the corner of his bedroom. In season 3, Dan has moved to Bayview Town because of his dad's work and quickly becomes popular due to the fact he helped destroy Naga and King Zenoheld.\nRuno Misaki\n, is a 12-year-old (11 in the Japanese dub) girl who loves playing Bakugan against skilled people so she can show off. Runo is a Haos brawler. Her Partner Bakugan is a Haos Tigrerra (the others being Terrowclaw and Saurus), who is very obedient and powerful in battle. Tigrerra later evolves into Haos Blade Tigrerra. Though underage (in the first season), she helps her parents run their family business in a cafe. It is revealed in episode 5, it is she lives not too far from Dan. In episode 32, a flashback revealed that she knew Dan from when she was little, but didn't realize it because she didn't catch his name. It is heavily hinted that she has feelings for Dan (and vice versa) but no relationship forms. She reached 6th in the rankings. She has not brawled for the final showdown against King Zenoheld as Tigrerra chose not to brawl and put her into trouble. She missed her friends so much that she teleported herself to New Vestroia but she was halfway there. She's believed to be 16 years old in the third season's timeline. Even though she didn't appear in Gundalian Invaders as an individual, in True Colors, she was shown in a flashback from New Vestroia, and in Mobile Assault, she was shown in a picture with Dan. In Mechtanium Surge, she was shown in another picture with Julie in the episode Back in Sync. However, she finally made her return in the episode Enemy Allies, where she delivers the battle suits to Dan, Marucho and Shun as they battle Wiseman. From that episode on, she and Mira helped to deliver the Battle Suits to the Brawlers whenever they needed them. In Jump to Victory, she met a Baku Sky Raider named \"Haos Aerogan\" and became his new partner, but Aerogan later returned to New Vestroia. Runo is a fairly good opponent in Bakugan. Near the end of Mechtanium Surge, Runo, along with Julie and Mira, are killed when Mechtavius Destroyer annihilates Bakugan City, but their deaths are prevented when Dan, Shun, and Marucho, are able to use the Current of Time to go back to before that happened and destroy Mechtavius Destroyer for good, preventing that dark future.\nMarucho Marukura\nMarucho Marukura (known in the Japanese version as  and nicknamed ) loves to play Bakugan and is also able to change attributes. Marucho is eleven (ten in the Japanese dub) and is an aquas brawler. He is seen after being defeated by Volt in episode 13, being held as a hostage in episodes 15 and 17, and was later freed by Mira and Spectra in episode 20, even though he is unaware of this. He gets Preyas back in episode 26. Nothing is known about Preyas Angelo/Diablo. In episode 26, he goes back to Earth with Dan, Shun, Drago, the other brawlers' old Guardian Bakugan, Elfin, and Ingram, except for Storm Skyress. Marucho's trap Bakugan is Aquos Tripod Epsilon. Despite his height, he is older than Baron. Marucho is 14 years old in the second series. In episode 31, \"Spectra Rises\", Marucho Dan and Mira make it to Vestal where they meet up with Ace Baron and Klaus later they are challenged by both of Volt Luster for their attribute energy and then challenging Dan. Spectra then battles Dan, Mira and Marucho when both Mira and Marucho lose when Drago protects them from Cyber Helios' cyber blast. At episode 35's ending, Marucho loses the Aquos energy to Hydron and Shadow Prove, although he wins the battle. He helps fend off the onslaught of Zenoheld's robotic Bakugan during the final episode of New Vestroia. He also gains a new Bakugan and will be back in Gundalian invaders. He's now believed to be about 16 in Mechtanium Surge.\nShun Kazami\nwas the former 1st ranked Bakugan brawler but after Masquerade showed up, he moves down to 6th, then back up to 5th after defeating Komba, then 2nd and ultimately to 3rd by the end of the first series. He is 13 years old (11 in the Japanese dub), has black hair, which is tied into a long ponytail, bronze-brown eyes and wears a purple jacket over a dark, dark blue (almost black) sleeveless shirt. He is a master of Bakugan and co-created the rules with Dan. He is also Dan's childhood best friend. Shun is a loner, a boy of very few words, yet is willing to help his friends at almost every turn. He is a Ventus brawler and he approaches Bakugan like a ninja. He lives with his grandfather, who used to be a famous ninja warrior, who once expected Shun to follow in his footsteps instead of playing Bakugan. His Partner Bakugan is a Ventus Skyress, whom Shun received from his sick mother before she fell into a coma, and died in the Japanese series. It is unknown if Shun has a father, this is not yet revealed, and he has not appeared in any of the seasons. Skyress later evolved into Storm Skyress.\nIn New Vestroia, Shun came to New Vestroia completely by accident, and explained why Dan could not contact him in episode 1; he was up alone in the mountains working on his ninja skills when a warp hole appeared and he was sucked into New Vestroia. He is 15 years old in New Vestroia. He made a cameo appearance in episode 4 when Marucho battled Mylene, but his face was not revealed as his hood covered it completely and was offered a place in the Vexos. After hearing that Skyress was taken captive, he rushed towards one of the cities to save her, but on the way, teamed up with Dan after rescuing him from Spectra and Gus. After being separated from Skyress, he teams up with Ventus Ingram, who he grabbed just before a beam pulled him into the ship. In the beginning, he does not get along with Ace very well, who refers to him as a \"ninja-wannabe\", but he is deeply admired by Baron who, in episode 7, even tries to imitate some of Shun's ninja moves but fails. He is taken hostage in episode 15, after being defeated by Shadow. Mira and Spectra later free him in episode 20, though he is unaware of this. He is reunited with Storm Skyress in episode 26 but she stays in New Vestroia, claiming that she was in his past and that Ingram is officially his new partner now. In episode 26, he goes back to Earth with Marucho, Dan, Drago, and the other brawler's Bakugan, except for Storm Skyress. Shun returns to New Vestroia a few episodes after the beginning of the second series and has a run-in with Lync Volan of the Vexos. Storm Skyress comes to his rescue, and after Lync is defeated by Shun and Ingram, Skyress bids Shun her final farewell. Shun is still the strong silent type and highly skilled with Bakugan and is willing to help his friends whenever they need it. He helps Dan defeat the Alternative in the final episode of New Vestroia. Not much has changed in how he acts or looks, except for the fact that he has cut off his ponytail to neck length. His Trap Bakugan is Ventus Hylash and his current Guardian Bakugan is Ventus Master Ingram.\nShun is 16 years old in Gundalian Invaders. Shun returns in Gundalian Invaders as the second-ranked battler in Bakugan Interspace and partnered with the synthetic Hawktor clone. At first, he does not trust Ren and asks Fabia for her side of the story after the comes to Earth. Together they expose Ren for the liar he is and the brawlers side with Fabia at which point he is given the real Ventus Hawktor that Fabia gave him. When the brawlers head to Neathia, Shun helps restart the second defense shield by switching Bakugan with Dan and heading to the generator. The mission is a success, but it is later destroyed by Barodius and Colossus Dharak.\nShun returns again in \"Mechtanium Surge\" as co-captain of the Battle Brawlers. His Bakugan is Ventus Taylean which is another Bakugan from Neathia. In episode 7, Dan disappears and Shun loses his cool as the new captain of the Battle Brawlers.\nJulie Makimoto\nJulie Makimoto (known in the Japanese version as  is a 12-year-old Blasian girl from Las Vegas, United States, who tries to stay happy even when the worst has happened (for example, when Billy ended up under the control of Masquerade); she acts happy after something bad happened but she generally does that just to cover up her true feelings inside. Julie forgets things easily, proving that she is a little scatterbrained at times. In the Japanese version, Julie spices her speech with American phrases, differentiating her personality from the others. She adores Dan, and by \"adore\", we mean \"make out adore\". This is why she's jealous of Runo, but eventually gets over Dan and becomes best friends with Runo. Instead, in episode 47, called, \"Here's Mud In Your Eye\", after defeating Tricloid, Julie realizes she likes Billy Gilbert, her childhood friend, while Billy feels the same way about her (which is true, due to the fact that she and Billy were blushing at each other a little throughout the 47th episode), and of course, when she asks Billy out, he said, \"Okay...\".  She is a Subterra battler and her guardian Bakugan is her Subterra Gorem. Gorem then evolves into Subterra Hammer Gorem. Julie has a sister named Daisy who has bested her in everything since she was a child. She reached 8th in the rankings. She chose not to brawl against Zenoheld in the final showdown as Gorem did not want to put her into trouble. She returns in Gundalian Invaders as a neighbor of Dan's once he moves. She works at a cafe and in Revelation, it is revealed she is a cheerleader for the team Jake plays for. This strongly suggests she is already in high school in her first year with Dan. She's believed to be about 16 years old. In Brawler To Be, Jake is having his first battle and Jake gets scared, so Julie teaches Jake some lessons. Her role is basically that of a supporting character. Julie returns in Mechtanium Surge as a news reporter. Near the end of that season, Julie is killed alongside Runo and Mira when Mechtavius Destroyer levels Bakugan City, but her death is prevented when Dan, Shun, and Marucho use the Current of Time to go back and destroy Mechtavius Destroyer for good before he could carry out his murderous intent.\nAlice Gehabich\n(also known as  Masquerade) is a 14-year-old girl from Moscow. Although she knows almost everything about the game, she rarely plays it; she is generally afraid of hurting others, including Bakugan. She usually just gives advice to the other brawlers, which she prefers over battling. Alice is kind and caring, worried for and compassionate towards others and does not think of herself. She also adores Shun. Alice was sometimes unconsciously possessed by  \"Masquerade\" (her mysterious alter-ego), and with a sudden jolt, her auburn hair spikes up and turns into a golden blonde as well as becomes slightly shorter and straighter, and clothes and a mask come out of nowhere on her, and finally, she turns into a male. This was caused by her exposure to the Silent Core. Alice might seem to be less important than the other brawlers, but in fact, she plays an important part, not as Masquerade, but without her, the brawlers might have already lost her to her alter ego. Michael Gehabich is her grandfather; who she constantly worries about after finding out that his alter-ego is the monstrous Hal-G and that he works for Naga. Alice and Marucho are the 2 brawlers who mostly use strategy. However, unlike Marucho, Alice gives her strategies to the other brawlers. She left the Brawlers after finding out that she was Masquerade out of intense guilt over what she had done as him, as well as fearing the Battle Brawlers will have a deep grudge against her,  but later returns in time to save Dan in the form of Masquerade. Her guardian is Alpha Hydranoid, which she received from Masquerade after he bid her farewell and left her body (something she initially resents, because she believed that she needed him; although Masquerade's presence will always be in her, as he is capable of communicating to her through her mind. Alice is also shown once with Masquerade's shadow instead of her own). After that, she initially begins to battle more, with her Darkus attribute, which she inherited from Masquerade. She either has a crush on Shun or Lync. Alice is 17 years old in New Vestroia, 18 years old in Gundalian Invaders, and 19 years old in Mechtanium Surge. Alice has a special ability that most brawlers wish to have, she can see the power level of any Bakugan on the field even if the Bakugan is not playing. That is why she does not have a Baku-pod. She might have this ability because of Masquerade. She ultimately ends up in 2nd place at the end of the series. It is still unknown if Alice is an orphan. She appears in Surprise Visitor and takes in Lync in Gate Crashers. In New Vestroia it is stated after Alice is reunited with Hydranoid, that she hates brawling because of what happened in the past, but when Shadow attacks in Shadow Attack, she has no choice but to fight back with help from Chan Lee. She and her grandfather also manage to find the route to the Mother Palace in All For One.\nJoe Brown\nJoe Brown (known in the Japanese version as ), also known as . In the first season, it was revealed that due to an unknown health condition, he basically lived in a hospital for some time. During this time, the Brawlers thought that he was working for Masquerade, because somehow, Masquerade knew every location they set foot, although this was because Alice was a Battle Brawler, so she knew where they were. After Dan confronted him, he told Dan that he would only tell him the truth if Dan could beat him in a battle. In the middle of the battle, Joe fainted, and when he awoke he revealed that the brawlers' theory was untrue and he actually sent a message to all of the Bakugan players around the world to warn them that Masquerade was plotting against them. After the truth was revealed, they asked him if he wanted to become a Battle Brawler, which he gladly accepted. He then revealed that he and his mother were going on a road trip for the time being, to see the world outside of the hospital. Sometime later, after he moved to the Brawlers' neighborhood, he found Wavern, who had the Infinity Core hidden inside of her. It was also revealed that Wavern was Naga's twin sister and that he was looking for her in order to absorb the infinity core. After he obtained Wavern, Joe was the first person to beat Masquerade in a one-on-one battle.\nJake Vallory\n|Dan Petronijevic}}\nis a new friend of Dan's after his arrival in his new town. He has a powerful presence because he's big for his age. He's very calm but can get overly excited and obsessive. He is a Subterra brawler and his Bakugan partner is Coredem. He is just starting out as a brawler and still was asked to join the Bakugan Battle Brawlers. He really admires Dan and likes to use his name and rhymes it with other words like, \" Dan the Man with the big, brown van.\" which sometimes irritates Dan. Later on, when the brawlers are on Neathia Jake gets kidnapped and brainwashed but as of episode 34, it looks like Jake is coming back to his senses. But in Dream Escape, he has a dream where Dan is shouting his name and it is then that he comes back to his senses and goes back to Neathia with the others.\nGunz Lazar\nGunz Lazar is a new character and the new member of the Battle Brawlers in Arc 2 of Mechtanium Surge. Gunz has blond hair, and wears a gray, with red lining, jumpsuit. His eyes are violet. He thinks of himself as Dan's greatest opponent and has a somewhat cocky personality. He is a Haos brawler and his partner is Reptak. He was seen in Evil Arrival which he fought in the Neo Tournament in Bakugan City. However, he was lost since Wiseman Cometh. In Battle Suit  Bash, he was revealed that he was captured by Wiseman and that he was absorbing Gunz's energy as well as stealing his appearance using vines. He later freed himself in Enemy Infiltration. He later took on the Wiseman persona himself after Coredegon stopped using it, becoming a second Wiseman and vowing vengeance against Dan for turning Reptak against him. He was defeated and later abandoned the persona in Doom Dimension Throwdown, joining the Brawlers and reuniting with Reptak.\nBakugan Brawlers' Resistance\nThe ''Bakugan Brawlers' Resistance' is a resistance movement that opposed the Vexos. Among its members are:\nMira Fermin\n|Alyson Court}}\nis a 16-year-old Vestal girl who had formed the Bakugan Brawler Resistance and became a leader of it after witnessing the tortured Alpha Hydranoid speak out in vengeance to the invaders, to free all the captured Bakugan from Prince Hydron and the Vexos. At the end of Surprise Visitor, she along with Baron travel with Dan back to his world. In Unmasked'', Mira challenges Spectra to a battle and if she's victorious, Spectra will be unmasked. If she loses, however, she has to join the Vexos and even battle against her own friends. She told herself in the beginning that her hero was always her brother, Keith, but forced herself to change her mind about it after Spectra unmasks himself in front of her, revealing that he was her 'hero'. Baron described her as 'intense'. She betrays the Brawlers in Family Ties as she says that she wants to stay with Keith, once telling the others on Earth that Spectra is her brother. She returns to New Vestroia through the portal Apollonir opened with Spectra, Gus and Lync after revealing her betrayal. In Beta City Blues, she reveals that she has joined the Vexos, but is really wondering what Spectra is up to. In Brotherly Love she challenged her elder brother to a battle and if she wins, she goes back to being with her real brother and not Spectra. However, if she loses, she will have no choice but to work for and obey Spectra.\nShe later lost the brawl. She is regretful of this as she says, \"I'm sorry, my friends\" after the battle, and is also seen crying as she has no choice but to be an enemy to the Resistance that she herself had founded. She later returns to the Resistance which was her main plan. She returns to Vestal with Ace and Baron and their Bakugan, in case the Vexos will want to take back New Vestroia for themselves in the future. Mira visits the Brawlers on Earth for a visit but soon returns to Vestal, this time with Dan and Marucho, and they meet up with Ace and Baron at Klaus Von Hertzen's estate. Following the defeat of Zenoheld, she returns to Vestal with her older brother, Gus, and the rest of the Vestal Resistance. She also has a brother that she desperately wants to find after he disappeared during Hydranoid's rebellion. Although she is the leader, she has a small tendency to go off on her own. She prefers the Subterra attribute. Her main Bakugan is Subterra Wilda and her Trap Bakugan is Baliton. She is good friends with Julie and Runo. It was also the main reason for Ace's hostility to Dan because Ace has a romantic crush on Mira. Mira is a strong fierce leader and very caring about everyone. she also always wishes that her brother Keith would return and her wish came true. Mira returns in Bakugan: Mechtanium Surge where she helps the brawlers by creating powered battle suits for their Bakugan. She is among those killed by Mechtavius Destroyer near the end of the season when he destroys Bakugan City, but her death is prevented when Dan, Shun, and Marucho are able to go back in time and destroy Mechtavius Destroyer before he could attack Bakugan City.\nAce Grit\nis a Vestal boy, 16 years of age, and the Darkus battler of the Resistance with Darkus Percival as his guardian and Darkus Falcon Fly as his trap. He is often very rash and does not think things through. As revealed in episode 13, Ace was once a top brawler in the Vestal tournaments but stayed away after Hydron used them to find strong brawlers. Mira approached him, invited him to the Resistance, and gave him Percival. Ace first shows his skills as a brawler when he battles Dan in the second episode of the series: Ace refuses to accept humans on the Resistance and challenges Dan to a battle to prove his skills. After three hours, the battle ends in a draw and the two become fast best friends.\nIn Return of a Friend, he and Mira had an argument because Mira wanted to postpone destroying the dimension controllers and find her brother, however, Ace refuses to allow her to go because he fears of the dangers she may face. In Voices in the Night, he says, \"This is for Mira\", which may also hint that he likes Mira. After Mira and Baron went to Earth with Dan, he worries about Mira and when he hears her voice in the night, which was really Shadow Prove who was leading him into a Vexos trap, he tries to save her, which further proves his love for Mira.\nIn ''What's the Plan?, when he and Shun are forced to fight together in a tournament, Ace wears a purple and black mask to disguise himself while tensions rise between the two of them and they fall close to losing. However, on the edge of defeat, they put their differences aside and Ace works together with Shun after realizing he was just trying to help. Shun remarks that he is very much like Dan. In Voices in the Night'', after falling for the Vexos trap laid out by Mylene, he loses a battle with her and becomes a hostage. After Marucho and Shun are also captured, they are relocated to Beta City, where they are freed by Mira and Spectra, though they are unaware of this. When he's told that Mira betrayed the Resistance he refused to believe it due to his feelings for her and gets a little violent by grabbing Dan's collar, but accepts it as the truth when Baron insists Dan's telling the truth. In Wall To Wall Brawl, When the Resistance infiltrate Gamma City, he and Dan battle Mira and Gus. Mira ends up betraying Gus and Ace tells her he always believed in her, Mira smiles happily at him and is glad to be back in the resistance.\nAfter Skyress, Hydranoid, Gorem, Tigrerra and Preyas are rescued, Ace and Percival return to Vestal with Baron and Mira and spread the truth about the Bakugan and the Vexos' actions. After Percival receives the Darkus attribute energy from Exedra, Percival evolves into Knight Percival. While Baron searches for an apartment to move into, Ace helps out but is ambushed by Mylene. He nearly loses but is saved by Klaus. Ace travels to Earth with the Resistance to hide out from the Vexos and protect the Attribute energies. While in hiding, Julie develops a crush on him after watching him work out. When Marucho invents Bakugan Interspace, Ace is set to battle Billy, but also challenges Julie so as to not \"get in between the two love birds.\" Despite Percival becoming immobile, Ace is victorious thanks to his evolved trap Darkus Flash Falcon Fly. After the Resistance decided to go on the attack, Ace and Marucho encounter Lync and Shadow at the Mother Palace. Due to the rigged field, Ace and Marucho lose and the Darkus energy is taken.\nAfter destroying the BT System, Ace returns to Earth with the Resistance and witnesses Dan's ultimate battle with Spectra, in which he decides to turn over a new leaf. After Keith becomes an official member of the Resistance, Ace becomes jealous of the time Keith spends with Mira. But Julie and Percival assure him that Keith and Mira are only siblings and that Mira is just happy to have her brother back.\nBaron Leltoy\nBaron Leltoy (known in the Japanese version as ). Originally, Baron fought with Tigrerra but lost her to Spectra Phantom and Pyrus Helios. He used Haos Nemus as his main Bakugan and uses Piercian as his Trap Bakugan. In Surprise Visitor, he says that he had always wondered what it would be like on the other side of the portal, which was the portal that led Runo to New Vestroia from Earth. In the end, he decides to follow Dan, Mira, and Runo to Earth in order to stop the Vexos from destroying it. Baron admires Runo as one of the six original Battle Brawlers but Runo's father does not like the fact that he does. He returns to New Vestroia with Dan through Dr. Gehabich's dimension transporter. He seems to be very fond of the activities done on Earth, especially by Dan e.g. taking baths. In Beta City Blues, he and Dan made it back to New Vestroia where they battled Mylene and Shadow in Beta City. Baron was defeated in helping Dan and Drago, but he still was able to keep Nemus. He returns to Vestal with Ace and Mira with their Bakugan, in case the Vexos will want to take back New Vestroia for themselves in the future.\nIn \"Revenge of the Vexos\", after the Vexos return, Baron brawls Prince Hydron and loses the Haos attribute energy. Baron is currently 12 years old, confirming this in the English version by saying, \"I'm almost 13 ya know!\" He is a huge fan of the Bakugan Battle Brawlers and the six fighting Bakugan as displayed by his reaction to first meeting Dan, Marucho, Drago, and Shun. He seems to always embarrass himself in front of Dan, Marucho, and Shun. According to Mira, he has a poster of the Bakugan Battle Brawlers up on his wall. From what was shown earlier in the episode stated above, Baron has a large family and is very caring for his many younger brothers and sisters, one of whom is Maron. He is the youngest and most emotional of all the brawlers.\nSpectra Phantom (Keith Fermin)\n. At the beginning of the series, Spectra Phantom would only serve under and obey Prince Hydron. Little was known about Spectra, but it confirmed he is very powerful and thinks highly of his skills as a Pyrus brawler. He was the Vexos' strongest battler and used Pyrus Viper Helios as his main Bakugan and Metalfencer as his Trap Bakugan. After seeing Drago's powers, Spectra said that he's not going to let it be a 'play thing', which means that even when he captures Drago, he will not give him to Prince Hydron. In ''What's the Plan?'', Mira noticed a possibility that Spectra could be Mira's brother. How he became Spectra is unknown. He also wished to join forces with Dan and the Resistance so they could take Prince Hydron down together in an attempt to rule New Vestroia and Vestal. After Gus lost to Mira, Spectra unmasks himself, proving himself as Mira's older brother . When he, Gus and Lync traveled to Earth, Mylene took over as leader. Meanwhile, Spectra won the Bakugan brawl against Dan and Drago and takes Drago. Dan defeats him and a corrupted Drago during their brawl with the help of Pyrus Apollonir. In episode 19, he convinced Mira to join him. He needed her help on his \"ultimate plan\", which was creating a Cyber Helios and duplicating the power of the Perfect Core, planning to use this Bakugan to overthrow the Vestal royal family. In Brotherly Love he battled Mira and won with his new Cyborg Helios. In episode 24 he took several Mechanical Bakugan for his own purpose of making Maxus Helios to defeat Dan. He does not return to Vestal, but he remains on the other rim of the planets area in a ship with Gus, Helios, Elico, Vulcan, and Brontes.\nSpectra appears again in Spectra Rises, battles Dan, and loses, but nevertheless says he will see him again soon. As shown in Spectra Rises, he used the forbidden card \"Chaos Ability X\" on Elico, Vulcan and Brontes, which forced their unnatural evolution, making them his battle weapons. In All Or Nothing, Spectra transports Dan to his ship upon reaching Earth to retrieve the Perfect Core from Drago. During their battle, Spectra seems to have a change of heart, referring to Dan as his friend in thanks for enlightening him. He reveals shortly that using data on Bakugan evolution, he plans to bring out even further power from within the Bakugan. After they arrive at the Mother Palace, he states that the Resistance is on their own in shutting down the BT system. After confronting Zenoheld however, Gus is defeated and Spectra soon forms a temporary alliance with Dan to avenge his fallen comrade. After the Pyrus attribute energy is absorbed and the BT system begins to activate, his ship is used to transport all of the Bakugan on New Vestroia to Earth. When time begins to run out, and the Resistance decides to bail out while they still can, Helios leaves Spectra and confronts Drago about staying to evacuate the remaining Bakugan. The two decide to head off and destroy the BT system, and after Drago evolves by absorbing the attribute energies, Helios and Spectra once again become Dan and Drago's rivals before leaving New Vestroia. But at the end of ''Spectra's Last Stand, Spectra agrees to join Dan and the Resistance and takes off his mask, becoming Keith once again. It is shown in the same episode that like Mira, he may have some sort of telepathic ability, as he spoke to Dan and Drago in their own minds from a distance.\nSpectra has returned in the fourth season, Bakugan Mechtanium Surge''. He was first seen in the shadows receiving a distress call from Marucho who was fighting against the rampaging chaos Bakugan, although Marucho and Shun were surprised that Spectra came to help they were still glad. Spectra left afterwards but not before telling Dan that he has changed from the old Dan. Spectra and Helios returned to help the brawlers again when they were fighting against Mag Mel on Gundalia and before they left Spectra said they had nothing left to worry about over the brawlers. When Dan thanked the two of them for helping, Spectra said they could call on him anytime.\nCastle Knights\nFabia Sheen\nis the Princess of Neathia. She is the younger sister of Serena Sheen, the former Neathian Queen. Fabia's reason for brawling is to save her planet from the Gundalians. She is also the fiancée of the former Captain of the Castle Knights, Jin, who is deceased.\nShe seems to have the same kind of love for freedom and initiative to act as Mira does. She also seems to be strong, because she shoulder threw Dan twice in episode 3, the first was by accident and the second was when she got mad at Dan after losing, and in episode 10 when Zenet tried to take her as a hostage and Fabia threw her hard on the ground. Those incidents may prove Ren Krawler's statement about the Neathians' specialty at close combat, although most of what Ren said was a lie to put down the Neathians. Fabia owns Aranaut, the bakugan of her deceased fiancée, Jin. After she becomes the new Neathian Queen in Bakugan: Mechtanium Surge, following her sister stepping down from the throne, she gives Aranaut to Captain Elright.\nRafe\nRafe (known in the Japanese version as ) is a new character in Bakugan: Mechantium Surge. He is a Neathian Castle Knight who was sent by Princess Fabia to go to Earth to help the Brawlers with the Mechtogan threat. He is the new Haos Brawler of the Battle Brawlers.  Since the Battle Brawlers helped save Neathia during the war against Emperor Barodius Rafe, along with other members of the Castle Knights, have looked up to Dan and the Brawlers.  Rafe was disappointed when he and Paige discovered how much the Brawlers had changed with Dan and Drago gone but he never gave up believing in the Battle Brawlers. After Mag Mel's defeat Rafe and Wolfurio returned to Neathia.\nGundalian Forces\nRen Krawler\nVoiced by Hirofumi Nojima (Japanese) David Reale (1-9), Peter Cugno (English)\nis a 16-year-old Darkus Brawler. Ren was the leader of a secret agent group sent to Earth by Emperor Barodius to find the DNA Code. He is an alien disguised as a human sent to find the best brawlers and defeat the Neathians. Ren comes from the underground world of Gundalia where he was kept, unknowingly, by the Emperor's family due to his possession of a dark Bakugan with a powerful ability.  He is a member of the Twelve Orders because he thinks that would save his people if he works for them.  He is attempting to trick the brawlers into thinking that the Neathians are the ones trying to conquer Gundalia. His Bakugan partner is Linehalt. He makes an appearance at the end of the final episode of New Vestroia. In A New Beginning it was revealed that he helped put Bakugan Interspace online. He has a battle with Dan, which ends up as a draw. In Confrontation Ren shows too much care and loyalty to his home planet. It's possible that even if Ren and Marucho are current enemies, they still share a big friendship thread. It also seems Ren does not want to fight the brawlers because he still remembers their friendship.\nAfter Sid, Lena, Jesse and Zenet were punished by the Twelve Orders, Ren feels incredibly guilty over what has happened, especially since he has gotten off Scot free each time. While he was fighting with Dan, he was surprised to see that Sid is alive and is relieved to hear from him that the others are alive as well. Sid saves Ren from Dharak's attack and falls to his death, not before giving Ren his Rubanoid. After some serious thought and battling with Dan, Ren decides to turn on Barodius and do something he should have done a long time ago: fight alongside his true friends. At first, the Neathians do not accept him, but after battling Fabia, where he lost, Fabia offers him her hand and he goes with the Brawlers. He is now one of the Castle Knights.  After the war is over Ren returns to Gundalia along with his teammates and Nurzak.\nIn Mechtanium Surge Ren has become the commander of the Gundalian Forces and is reunited with the Brawlers when they come to help Gundalia fight against Mag Mel.\nPaige\nPaige (known in the Japanese version as ) is a new character in Bakugan: Mechtanium Surge. She is a Gundalian Soldier who was sent to Earth by Princess Fabia of Neathia to help the brawlers deal with the Mechtagan threat. She is the new Subterra Brawler of the Battle Brawlers. Paige and Boulderon like to charge head first into battle. When Paige first met the Brawlers she was unimpressed with the way they acted and couldn't understand why Rafe looked up to them. Later though Paige changes her mind and figures out why Rafe looks up to them when Marucho comes up with a plan to win a competition. Paige later admits she may have been a bit too hot-headed with her first judgement of Shun and Marucho. After Mag Mel's defeat Paige and Boulderon returned to Gundalia.\nVillains\nDoom Dimension's faction\nHal-G\n; Osman Albayrak (Turkish)\nHal-G is a man with green skin and white hair who was the alter-ego of Alice's grandfather Michael after he was exposed to the Silent Core just like Alice, who became Masquerade. He assisted Naga in his quest to get the Infinity Core from Wayvern. After Naga was destroyed, Hal-G was exposed to the Infinity Core and returned to being Michael.\nAt the beginning of the first video game, Hal-G said that he had the Silent Core and that all Bakugan would bow to him. At nearly the end of the game, Hal-G reappeared after the player defeated Marduk at the Tournament a second time, showing the Silent Core to them, but stolen by Marduk's Bakugan Vladitor.\nMasquerade\n; Gökhan Akçakara (Turkish)\nis Alice's male-and-evil separated personality and used to be the first-ranked Bakugan player in the world before he left Alice's body. His goal is to send all Bakugan to the Doom Dimension with his Doom Card, so he can evolve his Hydranoid and have the ultimate Bakugan (to take the Infinity Core and bring it to Naga). He is a Darkus battler. He is revealed to be Alice in episode 38 and his origin is revealed in episode 39. Masquerade came to life when negative energy changed Alice when she was exposed to the energy of the Silent Core alongside her grandfather Michael. Darkus Hydranoid is Masquerade's Guardian Bakugan (his first Guardian Bakugan was Reaper, but he sent it to the Doom Dimension). He battles with Dan in episode 38 and loses. After that, Masquerade takes his mask off, revealing his true identity, Alice. Following the battle against Centorrior and Druman, Masquerade disappears from Alice's body. In New Vestroia, Masquerade made a minor appearance in episode 32 during Alice and Chan Lee's Brawl against Shadow.\nVexos\nKing Zenoheld\nThe central villain of the second season. The King of Vestal and a leader of the Vexos. He is the one responsible into invade New Vestroia, capturing the Bakugan and them to fight each other to create Mechanical Bakugan as his own weapons.\nIn the first half of New Vestroia, Zenoheld had little interaction with the Resistance or the Vexos. The only time he appeared was when he nagged Hydron for not taking better care of the Dimension Controllers. He seems to be impatient with him due to his constant failure. He will also check in with him and make sure that he is still on the right track, although Hydron shrugs his warnings and discipline off, as he thinks he is doing fine without his father's constant nagging.\nIn the second half of New Vestroia, he flees Vestal and resides in his palace on the outer skirts of the galaxy that is remote from civilization. He is revealed to be a brawler and he sends a message to the Six Ancient Warriors to surrender their Attribute Energies to him so that Professor Clay can power up the Bakugan Termination System. They decline his offer at first, but then they decide to battle him. When they arrive, Zenoheld reveals that he owns a Mechanical Bakugan, Pyrus Farbros. After a tough battle, Zenoheld comes out victorious, but the Ancients escaped and entrusted their Attribute Energies to the Resistance.\nAfter hearing the news of the Attribute Energies being dispersed throughout New Vestroia and Earth, he entrusts Mylene Pharaoh with the duty of picking another Subterra Brawler to replace Gus in the Vexos. She chooses Hydron, and he says that he “couldn’t have picked better himself”. After Hydron gains the Haos Energy after he defeats Baron in a brawl he says “I knew I could count on you...Hydron”, revealing that he now trusts him with responsibility more than he did in the first half.\nSoon after Mylene and Volt come back from brawling, he sees a transmission from Spectra, saying that the Vexos, Hydron and Zenoheld himself were responsible for the mess in the previous season. This causes him to send Shadow Prove to seek out Dan and the others so that he will get the Attribute Energies first. But when he does, he realizes Spectra jammed the transporting system, making it impossible to travel to Vestal and back. This infuriates him, knowing that he is up to something. Eventually, though, Shadow goes to Earth and brawls Chan Lee and Alice (who do not have any Attribute Energies). He wins and proves himself to Zenoheld. He also brawled against Gus Grav and won with the Farbros-Assail formation, and destroyed Blast Elico, and his Bakugan Trap Hexados. However, Gus and Vulcan survived the final blow.\nIn BT: The Final Battle, he helps Hydron brawl Mira Clay, Dan Kuso and Spectra Phantom. However, he does not brawl until Hydron loses to Dan and Spectra. He wins but Farbros was destroyed and he takes the Pyrus energy from Cross Dragonoid.\nIn Phantom Data Attack, he almost launched the Bakugan Termination System, and then Cross Dragonoid and Helios MK2 try to destroy it but fail. When Cross Dragonoid brings the B.T. System into the atmosphere and absorbed all the Attribute Energies from it Zenoheld was furious and was eventually going do something about it.\nIn Fusion Confusion, he takes his frustration out on Hydron demanding to know whose fault it was for the destruction of the BT System. After Professor Clay told him about how he could rule over all dimensions he had Clay create the Alternative Weapon to destroy Earth and Vestal.\nIn An Heir To Spare, it is revealed that Zenoheld took his anger against Hydron for another time. He battled against Hydron to see who would have the throne and won. Hydron was then jailed, along with Gus Grav. Zenoheld stated that they were never destined to be father and son.\nIn Ultimate Weapon, he battled Spectra, who rammed into his palace. During the entire battle, he was losing, even with Assail Farbros, because later Gus joined Spectra. However, when Farbros combined with the Alternative, he overpowered both of them.\nIn All For One and Final Fury, he uses the Alternative against the brawlers, but when the Alternative was destroyed, Farbros was destroyed by Dryoid. Hydron then used Dryoid to trap Zenoheld until the Alternative explodes, supposedly killing all three.\nHe is currently mentioned by Dan in season 3's introduction (first fourteen episodes), and also appeared in the next video game, Defenders of the Core (along with Spectra and the other Vexos, except Hydron and Clay).\nProfessor Clay Fermin\nProfessor Clay Fermin is Mira and Keith's father who created the first Mechanical Bakugan named Ventus Altair for Lync in Cyber Nightmare. He also appeared in Facing Ace with Alpha Hydranoid. He also created Darkus Hades and Trap Darkus Fortress for Shadow. Professor Clay is also credited for making the Cyber Bakugan that were intended for Prince Hydron but are being reprogramed for Spectra by Lync. He also turns Pyrus Helios into Pyrus Cyborg Helios after Helios gave him the idea of a Cyborg Bakugan. He also oversaw the test run of his creation Farbros in King Zenoheld's battle with the six Ancient Warriors. Besides Altair, Cyborg Helios, and Farbros, other examples of Professor Clay's Mechanical Bakugan creations are Aquos Brachium, Darkus Fortress, Subterra Dryoid, Dynamo, Fencer, Foxbat, Grafias, Grakus Hound, Hades, Klawgor, Leefram, Macubass, Metalfencer, Scraper, Spindle, Spitarm, Spyderfencer, and Wired. He also designed the Bakugan Termination System and is currently developing the Alternative Weapon system for King Zenoheld. As of Ultimate Weapon, he has finished the Alternative Weapon system (which he based on Farbros). In Final Fury, he was killed along with Hydron & Zenoheld when the Alternative System was destroyed, while he was watching the video sent by Fabia about the Bakugan at war.\nPrince Hydron\nHydron was the commander of the Vexos, the Vestal Prince and Zenoheld's son. He tried collecting all six of the fighting Bakugan that saved Vestroia and keep them as trophies. The Vexos continually failed to bring him Drago, the last of the six fighting Bakugan needed in his collection, as he had already in possession of Gorem, Preyas, Tigrerra, Skyress, and Hydranoid in a petrified statue form. He is shown to have a habit of twirling his hair between his fingers. In episode 17, he may have been aware that Spectra had Drago in his hands. At the end of the first half of the series, he flees New Vestroia with Mylene, Volt, Lync, Shadow and Professor Clay. He attempted to kill Spectra due to Spectra's betrayal but failed due to Spectra's own determination for power. He lost the six fighting Bakugan to the Resistance in Reunion. In Revenge of the Vexos, he started brawling with Subterra Bakugan, using Dryoid when he is sent to obtain the Haos Energy from Baron's Mega Nemus and succeeded. In Elfin On the Run, he teams up with Shadow Prove to try to obtain the Aquos Energy from Marucho and Aquos Minx Elfin and succeeds in defeating Elfin, but lost to Preyas. Later, he battles Dan and Spectra at the Mother Palace but loses to Helios and his new Battle Gear. In ''Volt's Revolt, after Volt leaves the Vexos, Zenoheld orders Hydron to deal with Volt. Volt defeats Hydron in a brawl, but Hydron starts to go insane and throws a dimensional grenade at Volt to send him to another dimension. He is almost pulled in with Volt but escapes in the nick of time. In Payback'', when Lync copies the plans for the Vexos' new Alternative Weapon system, Hydron follows Lync and defeats him in a brawl. He then throws another dimensional grenade at Lync to send him to the same dimension as Volt. When he returns, he is looking for his father's approval, but Zenoheld ignores Hydron blaming him for his minions' failures. This causes Hydron to face his father. When he does, he loses and is put in a cell across from a shadowed figure, which is possibly Gus from the figure's blue hair. In the next episode, it did turn out to be Gus, and they had a brief conversation before the opening. Gus later tricks Hydron, after a string of dog-related insults on Gus's part, into brawling with him. This breaks the doors on the cells releasing both. Before flying off, Gus says that he could have asked Hydron nicely but that would probably not work only further angering Hydron. He is later seen making his own, escape attempt on Dryoid. He makes it to the ship with the other Bakugan Brawlers. They forgive him and he is presumed that he was killed after ensuring that his father will not escape the blast from the ALternative's destruction. His last words were \"Volt, Lync, I'll be there soon.\" The blast occurred right after, so it is believed that he is dead.\nMylene Farrow\nMylene is the only female in the Vexos. She did not trust Spectra and enjoys doing things her way, but is still a loyal member of the Vexos. She becomes the leader of the Vexos after Spectra and Gus travel to Earth. However, King Zenoheld later became the ruler of the Vexos. Mylene used Aquos Elico as her main Bakugan and Aquos Tripod Theta as her Trap Bakugan. She defeated Ace in episode 13. She enjoyed the power of being the leader of the Vexos and, like Spectra, is tired of Prince Hydron bossing her around all the time. She also gets annoyed easily by Shadow Prove, who will not stop following her everywhere she goes. In episode 20 she and Shadow Prove battled Dan and Baron in Beta City and were defeated when Drago unleashed the power of the Perfect Core. She escapes New Vestroia with Volt, Shadow, and Lync, saying that it could be destroyed by the battle between Spectra and Dan and their Bakugan, discarding her guardian Bakugan together with Volt's Haos Brontes, as she thinks that Bakugan with feelings are useless. She later flees to Vestal with the Vexos, Prince Hydron, and Professor Clay, leaving Spectra and Gus. She later duels Ace in order to obtain Percival's Darkus Energy-wielding Aquos Macubass, but was defeated by Ace and Klaus. She then went to Earth with Lync to draw out the brawlers. They found Runo and Mira and battle them. Mylene defeats both Runo and Mira, thus gaining the Subterra energy. She later goes on to defeat Shun and Baron alongside Volt, taking the Ventus energy. After Zenoheld's announcement to create the Alternate Weapons System that would destroy both Vestal and Earth, she appears when Volt was about to leave, warning him about his idea. When he leaves, she wishes him luck and appears saddened when she hears what happened. In episode 48, Mylene is ordered by Zenoheld to retrieve the Brawlers Battle Gear data and DNA code for the Alternative Weapons system. She is then lured into Bakugan Interspace with Shadow Prove by Keith and Mira and is forced to battle. She no longer serves Zenoheld and has named herself a free agent. She loses to Mira and her mechanical Bakugan is destroyed. In the end, she rejects the Brawlers' offer to join them and instead throws a dimensional grenade at Keith and Mira. But after the grenade activated, Bakugan Interspace shut down, trapping her, Shadow Prove, Keith, and Mira inside. Marucho made a connection to bring them back, so Mira told Mylene and Shadow to come, but Mylene refuses to go. Mylene then got pulled by the dimensional pull until Mira and Keith grabbed her hand, but accidentally let go of her as Mira and Keith were teleported and Shadow grabbed Mylene's hand as they both were pulled into the dimensional portal. Her fate is unknown.\nShadow Prove\nShadow is a Darkus brawler. He is very childish and jester-like. When he starts a battle, he is very pompous. His Guardian Bakugan is Darkus Hades, who was created with Alpha Hydranoid's DNA, and he also has Darkus Fortress as a Trap Bakugan. Mylene described him as a child in episode 3, and then a hyena in episode 15. He has the ability to copy other people's voices as he tricked Ace and Marucho into falling for a trap by being the voice of Mira and Dan respectively. He has a habit of sticking his tongue out every time he talks or laughs. He defeated Shun in episode 15. In episode 20 he and Mylene battled Dan and Baron in Beta City and were defeated when Drago unleashed the power of the Perfect Core. He later flees to Vestal with the Vexos, Prince Hydron, and Professor Clay, leaving Spectra and Gus. But soon after, he is forced to leave Vestal with the other Vexos after the citizens of Vestal rally against Zenoheld and Hydron. Later when Spectra blocks the Vexos from teleporting to Vestal, Zenoheld sends Shadow to Earth to battle Alice to lure the Brawlers back to Earth. Shadow does stalk her disguised as a werewolf before she battles him. He loses his Darkus Hades against Alice and Chan Lee but reveals his mechanical Bakugan Darkus MAC Spyder, and wins easily. In episode 35, he joins with Prince Hydron to battle Marucho for the Aquos attribute energy and succeeds upon defeating Elfin, but lost to Preyas. When the Resistance infiltrated the Mother Palace, Shadow and Lync fought Ace and Marucho, winning the battle and taking the Darkus energy. He is trapped in Bakugan Interspace along with Mylene, Keith and Mira. Shadow and Mylene are pulled into the dimensional portal while Mira and Keith were teleported back to Earth. Because of staying behind with Mylene, it could be guessed Shadow has an attraction towards her. His fate is unknown.\nVolt Luster\nVolt is a Haos attribute brawler. He used Haos Brontes as his Guardian Bakugan and Haos Dynamo as a Trap Bakugan. He and Lync Volan are the Vexos' tag team champions, although they do not get along well together. He gets defeated by Dan in Invasion of the Vestals, and then again in episode 9 by Ace and Shun in the Bakugan Battle Tournament. He defeats Marucho in episode 14. He is defeated by Baron in Wall To Wall Brawl, and in Ultimate Bakugan is shown with Mylene and Shadow as they hatched an escape plan. In Final Countdown, his Haos Brontes was thrown out by Mylene, together with her Aquos Elico, as she thinks that Bakugan with feelings are useless. Although he was furious, he still left without Brontes, proving Mira's theory that he is brainless. He later flees to Vestal with the Vexos, Prince Hydron, and Professor Clay, leaving Spectra and Gus. He makes his reappearance in Spectra Rises, at first challenging Dan and the brawlers still in possession of Elemental Energies, but backs when Spectra appears, and Gus taunts him by saying he stole Brontes' soul. It is shown Volt seems to believe in doing the honorable thing, saying, \"I won't kick a man when he's down,\" after Dan defeats Spectra, and is seemingly weakened by the battle. Later, Volt challenges Gus to a brawl to win Brontes back, revealing his mechanical Bakugan Haos Boriates. However, he is defeated by Gus. In Samurai Showdown, Volt challenges Shun for the Ventus attribute energy. But Volt is defeated by the combined efforts of Shun and Baron. In ''Volt's Revolt'' Volt does not agree with King Zenoheld's plan to destroy all living things that stand up against him and returns home showing some of his past to the audience in the process. He is shortly thereafter confronted and challenged by Prince Hydron, Volt wins the ensuing Brawl and then starts to leave not before scarring Hydron by telling Boriates to nearly crush him. As payback, Hydron throws a grenade in front of Volt, which opens a dimensional port beneath him, sending him into a far dimension. As Volt sinks into the portal, he vows that Hydron will get what's coming to him for all the suffering he has caused innocent people. Volt later appears in Hydron's dreams/hallucinations along with Lync in An Heir To Spare. His fate is unknown.\nLync Volan\nLync is a Ventus brawler. He used a mechanical Ventus Altair as his Guardian Bakugan, and a mechanical Ventus Wired as a Trap Bakugan. Altair and Wired are able to combine into Meta Altair. However, in Gate Crashers, Altair and Wired were damaged beyond repair, and did not brawl for the rest of the arc. He was a spy for Prince Hydron on Spectra and Gus. He and Volt Luster were the Vexos' tag team champions. He gets defeated by Dan in Invasion of the Vestals, and then again in episode 9 by Ace and Shun in the Bakugan Battle Tournament. He then gets defeated by Baron in episode 11. He went to Earth with Spectra, Gus, Dan, Mira, and Baron. He was stuck on Earth with Alice after rejecting Dan's hospitality. He is seen crying at the end of episode 11. Baron called him 'a little weasel' in episode 11. In the same episode, Gus calls him a snake. He has his Gauntlet taken away by Dr. Gehabich in order to fix his dimension transporter without Lync realizing it (although it would not have mattered, as his Bakugan were destroyed anyhow). Lync eventually makes it home after swearing loyalty to Spectra and when Prince Hydron asked him to spy on Spectra, Lync denies him and helps Spectra with his \"ultimate plan\". But he then betrays Spectra by locking up Gus so he cannot tell his master of Mylene's escape plan. It is obvious he will do whatever is best for him (going as far as to claim behind Hydron's back \"You can count on me to do what's best for me.\" He later openly admits that he's \"very loyal to three people: me, myself and I\" in conversation with Volt and the other Vexos), due to his multiple betrayals throughout the series. He later flees to Vestal with the Vexos, Prince Hydron, and Professor Clay, leaving Spectra and Gus. He reappears to battle Shun after Zenoheld launches a prototype for the Bakugan Termination System, but is defeated by the combined efforts of Skyress, and a newly evolved Ingram. In Earth Invaders, Lync and Mylene battle Runo and Mira and succeed in obtaining the Subterra attribute energy. He later brawls Ace and Marucho alongside Shadow, taking the Darkus energy. Lync does love Alice. It was this that finally caused him to leave the Vexos when Zenoheld declared that the alternative would be used to wipe out Vestal, Earth, and New Vestroia (may have been a likely target as Zenoheld had a grudge against the Bakguan, although it was not mentioned in the list of targets) and anyone else that opposed him. After Volt's departure and \"demise\" at Hydron's hand, Lync copied the Blue Prints of the alternative to give to Alice (who would warn the resistance). He hesitates to speak to her, feeling guilty about his betrayal of her trust. However, he resolves to speak to her. However, Hydron appears on the scene (Professor Clay had discovered that Lync had made an unauthorised copy, which Mylene overheard him saying, she reported the incident to Zenoheld, who sent Hydron after Lync) and challenges him to a battle. Lync puts up a heroic and close fight but Aluze is destroyed by Dryoid and he is banished with a death bomb by Hydron (but not before throwing his glove with the data disk towards Alice's home, where she found it later outside, once the battle and its combatants had disappeared from the scene). Lync later appears in Hydron's dreams/hallucinations along with Volt in An Heir To Spare. His fate is unknown.\nTwelve Order\nEmperor Barodius / Mag Mel\nThe central villain of the third season, and one of the two main villains of the fourth season (alongside Coredegon). The Emperor of Gundalia, leader of the Twelve Orders and also a Darkus Brawler. He was born to a family that has ruled Gundalia for a long time. He is the leader of the Twelve Orders that seek to conquer Neathia. He has been able to rule Gundalia due to his overwhelming strength and special ability to simultaneously execute battles. His sole desires are: to obtain the secret DNA Code from the Bakugan that possess it and create the most powerful Bakugan in the universe. His other goal is to take Neathia's Sacred Orb so he can rule the universe. His Bakugan partner is Dharak. Gill is his longtime childhood friend and most trusted confidant, but when Barodius found out that Gill killed Kazarina, he had Phantom Dharak destroy Gill, Airzel, Stoica and their Bakugan. His quiet and calm demeanour masks his hot-tempered and devious nature.\nHe is highly arrogant but also highly intelligent. Barodius and Phantom Dharak have a final showdown with Dan and Drago and in the end, they lost to Dan and Drago. Refusing to admit defeat, Barodius and Phantom Dharak start to take the power of the Sacred Orb only for Code Eve to banish them inside a flip world of Bakugan Interspace, their hatred and desire exposed to the Sacred Orb causing them to mutate into steel-armored forms that soon would be known as Mag Mel and Razenoid, although the Brawlers at first believed that the two had been killed after Dharak absorbed too much of the Sacred Orb's powers. From that point onwards, he kept his desire to take the Gate and Key to control the Mechtogan and Bakugan in existence. He was killed by Drago in the episode \"The Final Takedown\".\nKazarina\nMember of the Twelve Orders. She's a Haos Brawler. She is sly as she is cold-hearted and is always by Emperor Barodius' side. She works as the Director of the Bakugan Biological Research Center, where she secretly undergoes cruel living body experiments to heighten the abilities of Bakugan. Her goal is to develop abilities that will rival the Neathians. She is an exceptional scientist who has unraveled the mysteries of Bakugan evolution. She can also hypnotize others to do her bidding, as shown with Jake and Coredem. She is heartless and selfish, as she would sacrifice one of her own subordinates to use as a scapegoat without losing any sleep on it. Another example of her cruelty was shown in a battle before the series began when she killed a number of Neathian soldiers, including the previous commander of the Castle Knights and Fabia's fiancé Jin before capturing Aranaut and sadistically experimenting on him. Her Bakugan partner is Lumagrowl. Kazarina is killed by Gill in the middle of Broken Spell and her spell on everybody is broken. When Lumagrowl hears about Kazarina's death, he leaves in sadness. His final, mournful howl over her death is heard echoing.\nGill\nMember of the Twelve Orders. He's a Pyrus Brawler. Gill is a calm, cool warrior who pledges his undying loyalty to Emperor Barodius. He had no parents when he was a child and was raised by the Emperor's family, seeing Barodius as an older brother. He will follow Barodius' orders without considering whether it is right or wrong. He is a teacher and trainer of Airzel, who shares a Spectra-Gus relationship with him. This relationship is also shown between him and Barodius, with Barodius in the \"Spectra\" role and Gill in the \"Gus\" role (reverse of his relationship with Airzel). It is shown that many times in the series he distrusts Kazarina, and he shares a mutual hatred with her, as well as fighting over Barodius's favor. His Bakugan is Krakix. He first appears in Revelation, where he and the rest of the Twelve Orders discuss how powerful Drago truly is. In The Secret Package, he, Airzel, and Kazarina join their brainwashed battlers against the Neathian Castle Knights. In The Element, Gill reports to Emperor Barodius that their Gundalian forces took down the second shield and Neathia's front line. In The Sacred Orb, Gill and Krakix battle against Captain Elright and Raptorix, but as Drago and Dharak come face to face, the Sacred Orb teleports the Twelve Orders back to Gundalia. In Battle For the Second Shield, before Lena leaves for Neathia with Kazarina, Gill tells her to watch her back around Kazarina, for she is loyal to no one but herself and would think of nothing of sacrificing one of her subordinates to save herself. After reporting to Barodius, she runs into Gill, letting him know of Lena's betrayal, suggesting that someone may have told her what she had planned for her. Gill replies that she got lucky today and that you never know who you can trust.\nIn ''Partners 'Til the End'', Gill and Ren planned on going to Neathia to take down the second shield, but Zenet disguised herself as Ren to redeem herself. But when Krakix thumped Ren (Zenet) on the head, she morphed back to her normal self. As she begged for a second chance, Gill allowed her to accompany him on this mission. Krakix took out the Castle Knights guarding the second shield. Then, Gill had Krakix scan the shield so they could destroy it on a molecular level. But when Shun and Hawktor swooped down on them, Gill had Zenet delay him while Krakix scanned the shield. But as Contestir was about to shoot down Hawktor, he tricked him and Zenet into hitting Krakix. Gill jumped in and as he was about to finish Shun and Hawktor, Dan and Drago arrived on the scene just in time. With the combined teamwork between Dan and Shun, Gill and Zenet lost and retreated. Because of the Brawlers' interference, they were only able to transfer 76% of data from the shield. Just as Gill was about to punish Zenet, Contest spoke up for her and suggested to Gill that he should have someone loyal only to him, to keep an eye on the other members of the Twelve Orders, and volunteered Zenet for the role. Convinced, Gill decides to try it out, so he has Zenet disguise herself as Nurzak to spy on Kazarina for him. Zenet reports back to Gill with information on Kazarina and Nurzak plotting to overthrow Barodius. Despite their excellent job, Gill and Krakix dispose of Zenet and Contestir, as they saw no further use for them.\nIn Divide and Conquer, Gill informs Barodius of Nurzak and Kazarina's plot against him. As Gill volunteered to do away with these traitors, Barodius told him otherwise and that this information does not leave his room. Furious at Kazarina, Gill vows to take her down, one way or another. In Mobile Assault Dharak suggests that they keep the Neathians busy with a wave of attacks of brainwashed battlers. He, Stoica, and Airzel lead the attack against the Neathians. With 72% of Gundalian forces down, Gill orders the first battalion to fall back and the second to prepare to attack. He then asks Kazarina to resupply him with more battlers from Earth, so she has Ren go do it, and Gill has Stoica tag along with him. In Colossus Dharak, as Stoica battles Marucho and Jake, Gill steps in for support. In Dragonoid Colossus, Gill and Jake battle each other, both using their Battle Gear, but Krakix's Vicer proves to be stronger. When Linehalt unleashes his Forbidden Power, the Twelve Orders retreat back to Neathia. In Into the Storm, Gill and Krakix defeat the Castle Knights and attack the third shield, but the third shield has a DNA barrier, preventing Gundalians from passing through the shield. He then retreats back to Gundalia and reports his findings back to Emperor Barodius. In Infiltrated, Barodius orders Gill and Airzel to separate Dan from Marucho and Shun. Gill and Airzel begin to battle Marucho and Shun, who have fallen for their trap. When Gill is prepared to take on Shun, he surprises him by finishing off Airzel, but Gill defeats both Marucho and Shun. Before Gill and Airzel can take them away, Shun throws down a smoke ball, letting Shun and Marucho escape. In Final Strike, Kazarina informs Barodius that Drago's DNA can be spliced with Dharak's DNA so Dharak can evolve, which Gill protests against, for risking their greatest weapon, the Emperor's weapon, is too great a risk. But Emperor Barodius orders him to stand down. After Dharak evolves, Barodius promotes Kazarina to his #2, infuriating a demoted Gill. Barodius then orders him to come with him. After the Brawlers break into the castle, Barodius has Gill take care of them while he heads to Neathia with Lena, Zenet, and Jesse (who are brainwashed). Once in the castle, the Brawlers run into Gill. Krakix attacks them before they can even launch their Bakugan, leaving them vulnerable. Fortunately, Ren and Linehalt counter Gill's attack before it hits the Brawlers. The Brawlers then leave Gill to Ren.\nIn Dream Escape, Ren leaves the battle to join Dan, Fabia, and Jake, but Gill follows him as well. As the Twelve Orders reunite, they prepare to attack the Brawlers. In Gundalian Showdown, Gill, Kazarina, Stoica, and Airzel battle against the Brawlers. Just as it seems that Gill has defeated Drago, he comes out unscratched. Drago defeats him with Spire Dragon, as well as Stoica and Airzel, but not Kazarina. After the Brawlers leave for Neathia, Gill orders Stoica and Airzel to follow them. He did not go because \"his ship was damaged by the Brawlers\". In Broken Spell, Kazarina, looking for her sword, finds Gill, holding her sword. Gill says they need to talk about things, but Kazarina just scolds him to stay in his place. Then Gill, using Kazarina's sword, kills Kazarina, telling her to watch what she says, for words have consequences. In Code Eve, Gill and Krakix, having spotted Fabia, Nurzak, and Mason, try to keep them from returning to Neathia, but they escape on Nurzak's ship. Just as he makes it to Neathia, Gill apologizes to Emperor Barodius for being late and tells him that Kazarina was taken down in battle by Fabia. But Barodius knows it was he who finished off Kazarina. For his betrayal, Barodius has Phantom Dharak attack Gill, along with Airzel and Strikeflier, who try to protect him but are all killed.\nAirzel\nMember of the Twelve Orders. He's a Ventus Brawler. Emperor Barodius and Gill recruited Airzel to be a warrior, and Airzel continues his battle training with Gill. He lurks in the shadows, to protect Barodius who chose him personally to be part of the 'Twelve Orders'. Airzel is the leading expert in enemy surveillance and information analysis. He always takes matters seriously, which causes him to be annoyed by Stocia's laid-back personality. Airzel is the #1 trainer on the Special Bakugan Team. His Bakugan partner is Strikeflier. He is fierce, confident, and reckless. He first appears in Revelation, where he and the rest of the Twelve Orders discuss how powerful Drago truly is. In The Secret Package, he, Gill, and Kazarina join the brainwashed battlers from Earth against the Neathian Castle Knights. After sending Linus to Earth with the Element, Elright is confronted by Airzel, asking him where the Element is. In The Element, Airzel reports to Emperor Barodius that they had captured Captain Elright, but his interrogation has not been successful. In The Sacred Orb, Airzel battles against Shun, and having blended in with the surroundings, gained the upper hand. Just as Drago and Dharak are about to face each other, the Sacred Orb teleports the Twelve Orders back to Gundalia. In Decoy Unit, Airzel volunteers to attack Neathia and take down the third shield, taking Mason with him too, as a chance to redeem himself. With their Gundalian forces and battlers from Earth, Airzel and Mason battle against Marucho and Jake. When the battle gets intense, Marucho and Akwimos trap Strikeflier and Avior in a block of ice, with Marucho and Jake escaping Airzel and Mason. In Mobile Assault, Gill, Stoica, and Airzel lead a front line of brainwashed battlers against the Neathians. In Colossus Dharak, Airzel and Strikeflier battle Shun and Hawktor, but when Fabia intervenes, Kazarina steps in to help Airzel. In Dragonoid Colossus, Airzel and Shun continue their battle, both using Battle Gear. Just as Hawktor takes out Lumagrowl, Strikeflier sneaks up on him and Shun and finishes them off. When Linehalt unleashes his Forbidden Power, the Twelve Orders retreat back to Gundalia. In Infiltrated, Emperor Barodius orders Gill and Airzel to separate Dan from Marucho and Shun. Gill and Airzel begin to battle Marucho and Shun, who have fallen for their trap. When Gill is prepared to take on Hawktor, he finishes off Airzel, but Gill defeats both Marucho and Shun. Before Gill and Airzel can take them away, Shun throws down a smoke ball, letting Shun and Marucho escape. In Final Strike, Airzel takes on Marucho as the Brawlers make their way to Dan. In Gundalian Showdown, Gill, Kazarina, Stoica, and Airzel battle the Brawlers to keep them from leaving Gundalia, but are all defeated by Drago's Spire Dragon, all but Kazarina. Just as the Brawlers take their leave, Stoica and Airzel prepare to leave for Neathia, but when Stoica wonders where Gill is, Airzel tells him that the Brawlers damaged his ship and told them to go on ahead. In Broken Spell, Stoica and Airzel reach Neathia, keeping Dan and Shun away from Barodius. After Kazarina's spell breaks, Stoica reveals that on the way to his ship, he saw Airzel and Gill talking about Kazarina. Airzel admits to Stoica that it was Gill that killed Kazarina, not Fabia, with Barodius listening in on them, thanks to Stoica's speakerphone being on. In Code Eve, Airzel realizes that Barodius was listening in on his conversation with Stoica, who had his speakerphone on. Just as Dharak prepares to attack Gill, Airzel and Strikeflier fly to his ship to protect him, but are killed along with Gill by Dharak's attack.\nStoica\nMember of the Twelve Orders. He's an Aquos Brawler. He has a split personality: one of an angel, the other the devil, which can change in a second, so turning your back on him is a very bad idea. Stoica is usually calm and pompous, but when he is irritated, he will need a lot to calm him down. Stoica has many trick moves during battle and opponents have a hard time reading him. He has saved Gundalia many times with ingenious battling abilities. He is the youngest member of the Twelve Orders. His Bakugan partner is Lythirus. He is the only member of the Twelve Orders to show his human form. He first appears in Revelation, where he and the rest of the Twelve Orders discuss how powerful Drago truly is. In The Sacred Orb, Stoica and Lythirius battle Marucho and Akwimos in the water. Just as Drago and Dharak are about to face each other, the Sacred Orb teleports the Twelve Orders back to Gundalia. In The Secret Switch, Stoica and Jesse find Dan, Shun, and Fabia in the jungle, wondering why they are even there in the first place. As Shun flees the scene, Stoica lets Jesse and Plitheon take on Fabia and Aranaut but loses to them. Anxious and impatient, Stoica and Lythirius enter the battle. As he keeps taunting Dan, Stoica realizes that Dan and Shun switched Drago and Hawktor around. Even with Razoid, Stoica and Jesse both lose to Dan and Fabia. In Curtain Call, as he and Kazarina try to blame each other for the loss of the second shield, Stoica suggests they blame Jesse for their mistakes. Unfortunately, Jesse has escaped, so he sends Ren to go retrieve him. After losing to Fabia and Jake, Ren returns to Gundalia with Jesse for Kazarina and Stoica. Just as they are about to dispose of Jesse, Plitheon speaks out of wanting to leave Jesse. However, Lumagrowl and Lythirius subdue Plitheon for turning on his partner. After disposing of Plitheon, Kazarina and Stoica do the same with Jesse. While walking down the hall, planning their report for Barodius, Kazarina and Stoica run into Nurzak, who tells them that they may be able to fool the others, he can see them for who they really are. In Mobile Assault, Gill, Stoica, and Airzel lead a front line of brainwashed battlers against the Neathians. Then, Gill has Stoica go to Earth to recruit more battlers from Earth. In Bakugan Interspace, Stoica and Ren, in their human forms, go to recruit new battlers, but Stoica leaves Ren to do the recruiting, while he goes searching for battlers in Bayview City. He then follows Koji, a battler, and persuades him into coming with him to Gundalia, so Kazarina can brainwash him (Koji having no clue of Stoica's intentions, merely that he was going to get a chance to have a brawl). In Colossus Dharak, Stoica takes on Marucho and Jake, but Gill steps in. In Dragonoid Colossus, Stoica is seen battling against Marucho, with both Lythirius and Akwimos using their Battle Gears. Thanks to Razoid, Stoica and Lythirius beat Marucho and Akwimos. Then, just as Linehalt unleashes his Forbidden Power, the Twelve Orders retreat back to Gundalia. In Redemption, Kazarina and Stoica confront Fabia and Nurzak and engage in battle with them. As Kazarina and Stoica press on the attack with their Battle Gears, the ground under Fabia and Nurzak crumbles, with them falling. They then find Fabia and Nurzak to survive their fall, thus continuing their battle. Just as they have got the upper hand, Stoica has Lythirius flood the battlefield, forcing Kazarina, Lena, Zenet, and Jesse (the last three being brainwashed) to retreat. With Fabia and Nurzak to himself, Stoica, now underwater, blasts them, sending Nurzak down the current. In Final Strike, Stoica and Lythirius knock Shun, Hawktor and Fabia to the ground as they are trying to reach Dan's location. Fabia leaves Stoica to Shun. In Gundalian Showdown, Gill, Kazarina, Stoica, and Airzel battle the Brawlers to keep them from leaving Gundalia, but are all defeated by Drago's Spire Dragon, all but Kazarina. Just as the Brawlers take their leave, Stoica and Airzel prepare to leave for Neathia, but Stoica stops to wonder where Gill is. Airzel tells him that his \"ship was damaged when the Brawlers attacked and said to go on ahead\", making Stoica suspicious. In Broken Spell, Stoica and Airzel reach Neathia, keeping Dan and Shun away from Barodius. After Kazarina's spell breaks, Stoica reveals that on the way to his ship, he saw Airzel and Gill talking about Kazarina. Airzel admits to Stoica that it was Gill that killed Kazarina, not Fabia, with Barodius listening in on them, thanks to Stoica's speakerphone being on. In Code Eve, Airzel realizes that Barodius was listening in on his conversation with Stoica, who had his speakerphone on. Stoica and Lythirius attack Dragonoid Colossus with acid bubbles in his eyes, blinding him in the process. But Dharak attacks Dragonoid Colossus with Stoica and Lythirius still on him, killing them all.\nChaos Army\nAnubias\nAnubias was the leader of the team of the same name and an artificial creation of Barodius whose appearance resembled that of a Gundalian. He was a Darkus Brawler. Anubias was a competitive brawler willing to fight at any challenge. While not entirely a bad person, he looked down on those with weaknesses or excuses. He appeared to have a want to destroy Dan. Mag Mel absorbed and killed him in \"Unfinished Business\". He was mourned over by Noah and Dan, who vowed that Mag Mel would not get away with what he'd done.\nSellon\nSellon was the leader of the team of the same name, and was the artificial creation of Barodius that resembled the appearance of a Neathian. She was a Ventus Brawler. Sellon had a mysterious personality and a serious attitude towards brawling. She loved style and grace in a battle and lived by honor. Unlike most Neathians, whose form is mainly blue and white, Sellon's is black, with tentacle-like hair. She also has 6 eye-looking adornments on her chest, much like the Chaos Bakugan. At the end of \"Dangerous Beauty\", she stole Dan's key and gave it to Mag Mel but was then absorbed and violently killed by him.\nSecondary characters\nAllies\nGus Grav\n(Japanese); Chris McCawley (English)\nGus was the Vexos' second strongest player, a Subterra brawler and devoted all his free time to training. He used Subterra Primo Vulcan as his main Bakugan and Hexados as his Trap Bakugan. He only answers to Spectra. He is said to be a weasel throughout the series, and \"Spectra's little pet\" and \"Spectra's lapdog\" by the other members of the Vexos, like Mylene and Lync. He was shown to be fond of the different things on Earth such as 'juice in boxes', but the planet made him uncomfortable. In episode 5, it was shown that before he joined the Vexos, he battled Spectra in the finals of the Bakugan Battle Tournament and lost. He was then offered a place in the Vexos by Spectra, which he gladly accepted. He admired Spectra a great deal and he felt that Spectra must be respected at all costs. He was shown to hate Lync because of his cheekiness. When the Vestal Palace was self-destructing, he gathered Elico and Brontes who were thrown into the ship chamber and saved Spectra and Cyborg Helios. He did not return to Vestal, but he lived with Spectra on the ship. Gus later was challenged by Volt to a battle but won with Brontes. After the battle, he returned to Spectra, but not before tossing Brontes through the teleporter back to New Vestroia. In Avenging Spectra, Gus took King Zenoheld hostage and then battled him but when he used his attack Aquos Blast Elico (formerly used by Maylene) sacrificed himself for Gus then later in the battle Hexados sacrificed himself for Subterra Rex Vulcan then both Gus and Rex Vulcan fall defeated in battle. Since then, Spectra had vowed to avenge him. Gus was thought to have died until 10 episodes later when it was later revealed that he survived and was placed in a cell, though how he survived was not explained. He later escaped and helped Spectra battle Zenoheld who was trying to stop Zenoheld's new weapon. Gus later made a comeback in Mechtanium Surge, though he only appeared in Episodes 25 and 26, where he teamed up with Spectra to defeat Mag Mel's Chaos Bakugan.\nLinus Claude\nA Pyrus brawler and Castle Knight from Neathia. When the Gundalians break through the second shield, Captain Elright sends Linus to Earth to give him the Element within his partner, Pyrus Neo Zip Zam. When he arrives, he meets Shun, who thinks he is Gundalian at first but realizes he is Neathian after Jesse and Ren challenge them to a battle, saying that any friend of Fabia's is a friend of his. Despite Zip Zam's power, they are both overwhelmed by Jesse and Zip Zam is taken. Linus, injured, is taken back to the brawlers while Dan heads out to win back Zip Zam. However, during that battle, Zip Zam gives the Element to Drago and subsequently dies. Zip Zam appears one final time in Linus' dream to say goodbye. Though saddened by the loss of his partner, Linus accepts that is it what he would have wanted. He returns to Neathia with the Brawlers. Much later in the series, Pyrus Rubanoid, Sid Arkale's partner before he died, accepts Linus as his new partner.\nElright\nElright is the Captain of the Neathian forces. He is captured by Airzel and interrogated but promptly escapes in time to join Fabia in battle. He is usually found fighting against the Gundalians or debriefing the brawlers on their next mission.\nIn Mechtanium Surge, Elright is still the captain of the Castle Knights and is the one who leads them to aid Gundalia.  Elright has become partners with Haos Aranaut and the two fought together against the chaos bakugan on Gundalia.\nNurzak\nA former member of the Twelve Orders who is a Subterra Brawler, and the oldest Gundalian living, as he served Barodius's father (the previous Emperor), he is a scholarly and wise intellectual. Despite being the oldest of the Twelve Orders, he has the most physical energy. He is the #1 officer of the Twelve Orders and is very good at analyzing the opponent, planning strategy and evaluating the situation. His Bakugan partner is Sabator. In \"Mechtanium Surge\", he is now the first Prime Minister of Gundalia.\nKato\nMarucho's butler. He has always helped the Brawlers and flies Marucho anywhere. Hal-G once tried to trick the brawlers by impersonating Kato, but Shun found out when he did not say \"Master Marucho.\" He is also very polite. Kato also appears many times in Bakugan: New Vestroia assisting the Brawlers once again (even when Marucho is not there). Kato appears in the 1st and 2nd seasons. He did appear in the 10 episode in season 3.\nHe also appears in Mechtanium Surge at the end of the episode Back in Sync with Marucho's father at the end of Marucho's battle with Jack and praises Marucho on his battle. Near the end of the series, he was going to take Mira, Runo, and Julie to meet up with Dan and the others, but is killed when Bakugan City is wiped off the map by Mechtavius Destroyer. However, thanks to the surviving Nonents sacrificing themselves, Dan, Shun, and Marucho are able to use the Current of Time to travel back and prevent Kato's death by destroying Mechtavius Destroyer for good.\nTop Brawlers\nThe Top Brawlers are the top five Bakugan Battle Brawlers who were mind-controlled by Masquerade and Naga to take out Dan Kuso's group. They were freed from Masquerade's control and later helped Dan's group in their fight against Naga's forces and the Vexos.\nKlaus Von Herzon\nThe 2nd rank brawler that appeared in episode 14, and was recruited by Masquerade. He uses Aquos attribute Bakugan and his guardian Bakugan is Aquos Sirenoid. Klaus sent Marucho's prized and caring Preyas to the Doom Dimension. Aquos Sirenoid is sent to the Doom Dimension in Episode 26. He is reunited with her sometime around episodes 29 and 42, and both attempt to attain revenge on Alice after she confesses to having been Masquerade, but also to teach her a valuable lesson when she intended to avoid Bakugan altogether because of the trauma she suffered from her evil acts she committed as Masquerade. He fights the Haos/Subterra hybrid Rabeeder with Alice and Christopher in episode 47.\nIn New Vestroia, he owns Condo Apartments and is in the condo business shown on Vestal in episode 29, having moved to Vestal to maintain his business there with Sirenoid.

Her usual past times are watching TV and doing yoga. She appears to be a typical stay-at-home mom, always doing the cooking and cleaning. At the beginning of the series, Miyoko became concerned about her son's latest hobby. She found out about Bakugan when she was cleaning Dan's room. Mrs. Kuso found a Bakugan ball on a table, dropped it and it turned out to be a Pyrus Griffon. She soon feared something was going on when Dan gave her a frog keychain for her birthday only to not come home afterward and asks Runo and even Masquerade. When Dan comes back, she and the rest of the brawlers' parents were informed of what was going on and let him go to Vestroia with the others to stop Naga. In New Vestroia, Dan calls her in episode 12 when he returns to Earth. In episode 14 when Dan comes into the house she goes over to hug him only to be greeted by Baron, who she called a sweetie. She then gets Mira to join her in doing some yoga, which Mira apparently did not like. Mira said, \"Is this some Earth torture?\" She continues to appear until Dan goes back to New Vestroia. She allows him to go, though she gets a bit worried about him once he leaves. She also appears in the first episode of Gundalian Invaders.\nShinjiro Kuso\nDan's father. He is a typical working dad who works for a businessman. He loves pudding up to the point of an unhealthy obsession and will go crazy if he gets it from someone (especially vanilla flavored).

He does not appear that much in New Vestroia but in one of his appearances, he joked about Mira being Dan's new girlfriend.\nTatsuo Misaki\nRuno's father and owner of their family cafe alongside his wife Saki Misaki. He has a tendency to smother Runo and the cafe is filled with pictures of her and his actions as an over-protective parent get on Runo and his wife's nerves. However, he is very devoted to his family and loves them very much. While he does accept it when a girl does a bad job or breaks a few dishes but he does not like it when there is a bad male waiter in his cafe such as Baron, who had evidently spilled several times. He is seen crying in the preview for episode 43 while hugging Runo this shows just how much he loves his daughter.\nSaki Misaki\nRuno's mother and part-owner of the Misaki's cafe where all of the girls work. She is married to Tatsuo Misaki. She tends to respond negatively towards her husband's actions such as when she has Baron sweep the front porch and she has mentioned that he has put her in therapy.

An Illusionary Daisy was summoned to battle her for a test with Clayf.\nShiori Kazami\nShun's mother. The reason for Shun's grimness since his mom is comatose (in the English version). (Although in the Japanese version, she's noted to be dead.) Before sleeping, she waited to see Shun. After Shun thinks his mom is dead the doctor says she is just tired which turned out to be true. After Shun's initial relief, he finds a Bakugan in his mother's hand; this turned out to be Skyress, a strong and rare Bakugan. She gave this to Shun because she knew that Shun was interested in Bakugan not in ninja lessons. It is unknown if she is alive. Skyress was given to Shun to look after him since she cannot look after him herself. When Oberus gave Shun his test, she used an illusionary form of a young Shun's Mother who always wanted to play with Shun, the final game she wanted to play with him, was Bakugan. She made Shun almost want to stay with her since he wanted his mother to be healthy again and he wanted to stay with her.\nShun's Grandfather\nHe wants Shun to be a ninja, not a Bakugan player. Shun lives with him. His house resembles a dojo and has many traps installed inside. He seems to want Shun to be a ninja, as he was once a greatly skilled ninja.

Similar to how Alice is Masquerade he has a more negative, evil form, which is Hal-G, and for most of the first series he is seen in this form. He turns into Hal-G when a huge amount of negative energy from the Silent Core infiltrates his lab. He is cured by the end of the first and second seasons. He is first seen in Moscow with Alice, fixing the gate to New Vestroia. When he tests it by sending a Russian doll, it fails to teleport he tries it with a Gate Card and it teleports. However, unknown to him or Alice, it sent thousands of gate cards into New Vestroia, one of which is caught by Spectra and given to Professor Clay. Later Michael used the technology of Lync's gauntlet to fix the gate thus preventing Alice, Runo and Julie from going to New Vestroia along with Dan and Baron, as they did not have gauntlets which were required to be able to enter.\nBen Gehabich\nAlice's uncle.\nClara Gehabich\nAlice's aunt.\nMrs. Brown\nJoe's mother.\nMaron Leltoy\nBaron Leltoy's younger sister and the second oldest of the Letloy siblings.

She appeared again when Baron and the rest of the Resistance had to leave for Earth. In episode 36, Maron uses the Dimension Transporter to visit Baron on Earth. Baron takes her to an amusement park where she showed a lot of excitement. While Baron was showing her how to use a Gauntlet, they accidentally ended up in a battle against Volt Luster (who was battling Shun Kazami). After joining the battle, Maron was watching from a safe distance until some of the attacks landed near her. When she was falling from her lookout post Shun saved her. After the battle before she left for home, she gave Shun a kiss on the cheek for saving her. Maron is the main sibling of Baron.

Not one to crumble under pressure, Serena goes and sends Fabia to Earth to get help against The Gundalians. In addition, she calls the ancient and legendary \"antimatter energy\" to cover her home world. However, the Emperor of Gundalia uses his Bakugan Dharak to break down the shield to steal and absorb the energy's power. Serena's biggest challenge is to keep Neathia running smoothly and keep the people calm and safe while waiting for Fabia and the Brawlers to help take down Barodius. In \"Mechtanium Surge\", she is revealed to be the Ambassador of Neathia and Gundalia. In order for this to happen, she resigned as Queen, thus giving the throne to Fabia.\nEnemies\nGundalian Agents\nSid Arkale\nSid Arkale was a Pyrus brawler from Gundalia. He is partnered with Pyrus Rubanoid and his Battle Gear is Destrakon Gear. Sid has a feeling of doubt like he does not think Emperor Barodius's decision to let Ren handle the Battle Brawlers is a good idea. He first appears in \"Revelation\" with Lena Isis battling against Dan and Marucho. Although they managed to defeat Marucho, they lose to Dan and Drago with his Level 2 Battle Gear. In \"Confrontation\", after he failed to recruit new kids for the Gundalians, Sid battles alongside Zenet Surrow against Dan and Ren and beat them, but was later told to leave the Battle Brawlers to Ren. In \"Hostile Takeover\", Sid battles with Casey, a brainwashed kid, against Marucho and Jake, but loses. In \"The Element\", Sid steals a sealed Neo Zipzam from Ren, who tries to take it back, and he decides to battle Dan, but after throwing Neo onto the arena, he loses the battle to a newly evolved Drago. After retreating back to Gundalia, Rubanoid attempts to attack Emperor Barodius, but is struck down by Krakix and taken away by Kazarina for research. After Ren pleads mercy from the Emperor, Sid faces is fate as the Emperor disposes of him. In \"Sid Returns\", Sid, who awakes from a deep sleep, finds himself, Lena, Jesse and Zenet trapped in Kazarina's Lab. As Sid escapes her lab, he sees Ren alongside Gundalian soldiers running towards Gundalian transport ships. As Dan and Ren battle each other, Sid, disguised as a Gundalian soldier, joins the battle alongside Ren, but loses. After catching up with Ren, Sid is fired on by Dharak, but is saved by Ren. He then hands Rubanoid to Ren and releases his grip, falling to his death. In \"Forgiveness\", Sid was mentioned and shown in a flashback while Ren was battling Fabia with Rubanoid to join the Battle Brawlers or stay with the Gundalians. It is unknown if Sid survived his fall from the cliff. Unlike most Gundalian brawlers, Sid was barely seen in his Gundalian form throughout the series.\nLena Isis\nLena Isis is an Aquos brawler from Gundalia. She is partnered with Aquos Phosphos and his Battle Gear is Terrorcrest. She is an intelligent, strategic brawler and is calm, and collective in a battle. She is also clever and does not suffer from arrogance like her teammates. She first appears in \"Revelation\" alongside Sid Arcale against Dan and Marucho, but both lose to Drago because of his Level 2 Battle Gear. In \"Confrontation\", she and Mason manage to recruit some top-ranked brawlers by using their non-Guardian Bakugan and lose, thus proving they are powerful brawlers. They then bring the two kids back to Gundalia, in which Kazarina hypnotizes them. In \"Escape From Darkness\", she and Zenet battle Fabia and Avatar Marucho. Lena was clever enough to realize that Marucho's Aranaut was a digital clone, but did not realize that Marucho was an avatar, not until Ren put his and Marucho's conversation on the arena's big screen, letting Lena and Zenet that they are battling a clone. After that, Lena and Zenet defeat the Avatar Marucho and Fabia. They then try to take Fabia back to Gundalia, but escape Bakugan Interspace when Marucho arrives. In \"The Sacred Orb\", Ren, Lena, Zenet, Mason, and Jesse, in their true forms, were being talked down to by the Twelve Orders. Before heading for Neathia in \"Battle For the Second Shield\", Lena is warned by Gill to watch her back around Kazarina, for she is loyal to no one but herself and would think nothing of sacrificing one of her subordinates to save herself. Once on Neathia, she, alongside Kazarina, battle against Shun and Drago, but lose when Dan and Hawktor arrive. After retreating back to Gundalia, Lena and Phosphos attempt to ambush Kazarina, knowing she would sell her out to save herself, but her plan fails when Lumagrowl takes down Phosphos and Kazarina finishes her off. She is then seen unconscious in \"Sid Returns\", along with Sid, Zenet, and Jesse. In \"Redemption\", Ren and Mason sneak into Kazarina's Lab to rescue Lena, Zenet, and Jesse, but find that no one is inside. As she is battling against Fabia and Nurzak, Kazarina reveals a surprise to them: Lena, Zenet, and Jesse, all hypnotized. But once Stoica has Lythirius flood the battlefield, Kazarina has Lumagrowl retreat, along with Lena, Zenet, and Jesse.
