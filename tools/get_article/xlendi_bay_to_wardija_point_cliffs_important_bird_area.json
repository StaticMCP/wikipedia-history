It extends from Wardija Point in the west for about 3&nbsp;km to Xlendi Bay in the east, with the steep and rugged cliffs rising from sea level to a height of 105&nbsp;m. It was identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports 350–500 breeding pairs of Cory's shearwaters and 30–50 pairs of vulnerable yelkouan shearwaters.\nSee also\n* List of birds of Malta\nReferences"
