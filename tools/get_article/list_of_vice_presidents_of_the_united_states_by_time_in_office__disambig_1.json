The listed number of days is calculated as the difference between dates, which counts the number of calendar days except the first day (day zero). If the first day were included, all numbers would be one day more.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left:2em\"\n|\n|-\n|\n|}\nSince 1789, there have been 50 people sworn into office as Vice President of the United States. Of these, nine succeeded to the presidency during their term, seven died while in office, and two resigned. Since the adoption of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution (February 10, 1967), when there is a vacancy in the office of the vice president, the president nominates a successor who takes office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress.\nVice presidents by time in office\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" | Rank !! data-sort-type=\"text\" | Vice&nbsp;President !! data-sort-type=\"number\" | Lengthin&nbsp;days\n!! data-sort-type=\"number\" | Order of vice presidency !! class=\"unsortable\" | President served under !! class=\"unsortable\" | Number of terms\n|-\n| rowspan=7|1tie || Daniel D.
