The company provides custom printing, branding, and fulfillment services for drinkware, apparel, packaging, and promotional products to commercial clients throughout the United States.\nHistory Grandstand was founded in 1988 by Chris Piper, a former University of Kansas basketball player and 1988 NCAA national champion, as a small T-shirt printing business in Lawrence, Kansas. The company began printing designs on glassware for local breweries during the 1990s. The Lawrence Journal-World reported that by the early 2010s, Grandstand had produced over 1.3 million amber glass growlers and cited the company as the largest producer of amber glass growlers in the United States as of 2013.\nIn 2011, Grandstand relocated to a 150,000-square-foot facility in the East Hills Business Park, purchasing the former Sauer-Danfoss building. By 2018, the company employed more than 200 people.
