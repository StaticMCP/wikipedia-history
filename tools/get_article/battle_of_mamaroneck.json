To cover the eastern flank of his army, Howe ordered Major Robert Rogers and his Rangers to seize the village of Mamaroneck which had been recently abandoned by the Continental army. On the night of October 22, 750 men under Colonel John Haslet attacked the British encampment. Haslet's men achieved complete surprise, but Rogers' Rangers rallied and drove off the attackers.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
