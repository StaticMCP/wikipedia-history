He played college football for the Florida State Seminoles and was selected by the Seattle Seahawks in the second round of the 2004 NFL draft. He also played in the NFL for the Houston Texans.\nBoulware's older brother Peter Boulware also played in the NFL.\nEarly life\nBoulware attended Spring Valley High School in South Carolina. He played safety and linebacker on the school's football team. Boulware was selected as South Carolina's Gatorade Player of the Year in 1999; he committed to play college football for the Florida State Seminoles.\nCollege career\nAt Florida State University (FSU) he started every game in 2001 at strongside linebacker, and was an All-America candidate in his senior year.\nAs a Freshman he was FSU's top tackler on kickoff teams; he was 21st on the team with 21 tackles. As a Sophomore he ranked 4th in the Atlantic Coast Conference and tied for the team lead with three interceptions. He led the Seminole defense in scoring with two touchdowns, and ranked 4th on the team in tackles with 81. As a Junior he started every game at strongside line-backer. He was a semifinalist for the Butkus Award, and named to the All-ACC second-team.\nProfessional career\n}}\nSeattle Seahawks\nAfter college, Boulware went on to play for the Seattle Seahawks defense as a part-time linebacker and strong safety. In his rookie year he had a forced fumble, a sack, fifty-three tackles and most impressively, intercepted five passes, the most interceptions for any rookie ever to play for the Seahawks (until Earl Thomas did it in 2010). The end of his second year proved to be rewarding as the Seahawks played in Super Bowl XL, in which he intercepted a pass from Ben Roethlisberger. On Wednesday, October 25, Mike Holmgren, coach of the Seattle Seahawks, announced Jordan Babineaux would replace Michael Boulware at the free safety position. Mike Holmgren said that Boulware could get his job back later in the season, which he did in the December 24 game against San Diego.\nHouston Texans\nOn September 1, 2007, the Seahawks traded Boulware to the Houston Texans for former first-round pick Jason Babin.\nMinnesota Vikings\nOn March 20, 2008, the Minnesota Vikings signed Boulware to a one-year contract.  On August 28, 2008, he suffered a wrist injury and was subsequently placed on IR on August 30, 2008, ending his season.\nNFL statistics\n{|style=\"text-align:center;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
