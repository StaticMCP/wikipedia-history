Brady Farm, is a historic home and farm located near Middletown, New Castle County, Delaware. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.\nHistory\nOriginal structure\nThe original structure was built in the early 1800s by John Clayton. Clayton was the son of Colonel Oscar Clayton, who served as secretary to Caesar Rodney, famous for having rode his horse to Philadelphia in 1776 to cast the deciding vote for Delaware for independence.\nAdditions and architectural style\nThe larger addition featured in the pictures was built about 1850, and consists of the original two-story brick farmhouse adjoining a later and larger brick three-story addition whose design displays influences of both Greek Revival and Italianate styles. It features large pairs of sawnwork brackets supporting the overhanging boxed cornice. Also on the property are a contributing icehouse, smokehouse, barn, granary, and tenant house.\nReferences"
