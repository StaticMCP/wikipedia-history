Taking place in the Rawanduz region of northern Iraq, the battle was initiated by an Iraqi counteroffensive against Iranian and Kurdish (Peshmerga) forces who had gained control of key mountainous terrain during Operation Karbala-10.\nAlthough not as strategically wide-ranging as major battles in the south, the engagement was tactically vital, as it prevented further Iranian advances in Iraqi Kurdistan and allowed Iraq to reassert control over areas threatened by Iranian-aligned insurgency.\nBackground\nBy 1987, both Iran and Iraq were exhausted from nearly seven years of attritional warfare.Unable to make decisive gains on the southern front, Iran had begun launching operations in northern Iraq, capitalizing on alliances with Kurdish insurgents such as the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK).\nDuring Operation Karbala-10, Iranian Revolutionary Guards and Kurdish fighters had seized high ground overlooking Iraqi Army positions near Rawanduz, a key logistics and military garrison town in Erbil Governorate. The Jabal Maqlub mountain was of particular importance, dominating the Rawanduz–Soran corridor, a crucial route for Iraqi troop movements and air supply.\nThe Iranian-Kurdish occupation of these positions posed a dual threat: it endangered northern Iraqi infrastructure and emboldened anti-Ba'athist Kurdish insurgents.\nPrelude to the battle\nAlarmed by the strategic implications of the loss of Jabal Maqlub, the Iraqi High Command ordered an emergency counteroffensive. Led by elements of the elite Republican Guard, along with the 1st Army Corps and special forces from the Army Aviation Command, the objective was to:\n*recapture the Jabal Maqlub heights;\n*eliminate or disperse Iranian and Peshmerga elements operating in the area;\n*prevent further Iranian logistical buildup in Kurdistan;\n*re-establish full Iraqi control before launching broader counterinsurgency actions.\nThe battle\nThe Iraqi operation commenced on the morning of April 2, 1987, with a heavy artillery barrage and aerial strikes targeting known Iranian and Kurdish positions on the mountain slopes. Iraqi Mi-24 and Gazelle helicopters provided close air support while scouting vulnerable positions.\nGround assault\nInfantry and armored columns advanced from Rawanduz and Bekhal, supported by mobile artillery.\nHeliborne units from the Republican Guard landed on the western slope of Jabal Maqlub, attempting a pincer movement.\nIntense close-quarters combat followed as Iraqi troops stormed entrenched positions, often under fire from machine gun nests and mortar emplacements manned by IRGC and Kurdish fighters.\nKurdish withdrawal\nOn April 5, following sustained air strikes and Iraqi flanking maneuvers, Kurdish Peshmerga units began withdrawing toward Soran and Choman, suffering heavy casualties.\nIranian Revolutionary Guards tried to regroup at Mount Zozik, but were overwhelmed by Republican Guard artillery on April 7.\nAftermath\nThe Iraqi victory at Jabal Maqlub had both military and psychological impact.\nMilitary significance\nThe battle restored Iraqi control over a strategic corridor in the north. It also denied Iran a potential launch point for future offensives toward Erbil or Kirkuk, and severed the coordination line between Iranian command elements and KDP fighters.\nHuman impact\nCivilian casualties were reported in the villages of Haji Omaran and Bekhal, caught between the two sides.\nDozens of captured Peshmerga were later executed or sent to Abu Ghraib Prison.\nReports of chemical weapons use in follow-up raids on surrounding Kurdish villages remain disputed, but plausible.\nStrategic implications\nThe regained security enabled Iraq to shift attention toward retaliatory campaigns in Kurdish areas, including chemical attacks such as those in Sardasht (June 1987) and later Halabja (March 1988).\nThe battle marked the last time Iran made a serious conventional push in the north before the war began winding down.\nLegacy\nThough a relatively localized battle, the engagement at Jabal Maqlub is viewed by some historians as a microcosm of the broader war:\n*high human cost for minimal strategic change;\n*proxy elements (Kurdish fighters) heavily involved;\n*use of elite units and aerial mobility by Iraq to contain northern threats.\nThe battle is rarely referenced in English-language sources and lacks a standalone entry on major military history platforms, though Iraqi military records and Kurdish oral histories recount it with significance.\nSee also\n*Iran–Iraq War\n*Operation Karbala-10\n*Republican Guard (Iraq)\n*Kurdistan Democratic Party\n*Halabja chemical attack\nReferences\n:Category:Battles in 1987"
