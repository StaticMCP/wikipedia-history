Simon Li (李湛明), is a pioneer\nin the field of optoelectronic device simulation TCAD and based on this work, Crosslight claims to be the\nfirst commercial vendor of TCAD tools for quantum well laser diodes.\nCrosslight also licenses other technology from the Stanford University\n[http://www-tcad.stanford.edu/tcad/programs/oldftpable.html TCAD Group] for semiconductor process simulations.\nHistory\nAfter its initial spin-off from the NRC, Crosslight launched its flagship product LASTIP, a 2D simulator for quantum\nwell laser diodes. Based on its founder's research, LASTIP predates\nother well-known tools in the field such as MINILASE.\nBy adding the ability to model quantum well active regions, LASTIP was also a significant step-up from\nearlier comparable efforts such as Hitachi's HILADIES.\nAs early laser diode TCAD tools were primarily developed by individual researchers for their own use, Crosslight claims\nthat LASTIP's commercialization makes them first-to-market in this field.\nFurther improvements in the technology followed including the development of PICS3D for 3D modeling of optoelectronic\ndevices, a feat which earned Crosslight the Laser Focus World Commercial Technology Achievement Award in 1998.\nFor non-laser TCAD applications such as solar cells and light-emitting diodes, a\nthird tool called APSYS was developed.\nIn March 2004, Crosslight licensed the legendary 2D process simulator SUPREM-IV.GS\nfrom Stanford University and extended it to 3D as the core of its process simulation tool CSUPREM.\nIn January 2010, Crosslight entered into a partnership with Acceleware with the intention of producing greater speed\nin thin film solar cell and image pixel sensor simulations.\nSince its founding, Crosslight has built up a worldwide base of industrial and academic users\nand has sponsored research and academic projects at various universities and research institutes.\nIt has also collaborated with many leading researchers in the field of semiconductor devices, including Nobel-prize winner Shuji Nakamura.\nProducts\nLASTIP\nLaser Technology Integrated Program is Crosslight's flagship product and was intended to bring to the laser diode\ncommunity a level of maturity equivalent to that seen in the silicon IC industry. It includes optical gain models for\nquantum well/wire/dot with different types of spectral broadening, Coulomb interaction for many-body effects,\nk.p non-parabolic subbands and models optical mode competition in structures supporting multiple lateral modes.\nPICS3D\nPhotonic Integrated Circuit Simulator in 3D, is a state of the art 3D-simulator for surface and edge emission laser\ndiodes, SOA and other similar active waveguide\ndevices. 2/3 dimensional semiconductor equations (drift-diffusion) are coupled to the\noptical modes in both the lateral and longitudinal directions. Optical properties such as quantum well/wire/dot optical\ngain and spontaneous emission rates are computed self-consistently.\nAPSYS\nAdvanced Physical Models of Semiconductor Devices, is based on 2D/3D finite element analysis of electrical, optical and\nthermal properties of compound semiconductor devices with an emphasis on band structure engineering and quantum mechanical effects.\nUnlike other TCAD tools used in the microelectronics industry, silicon is merely a special case of a more generalized\nsemiconductor material library.\nCSUPREM\n(Crosslight-SUPREM) is a 3D process simulation software package based on the SUPREM.IV.GS code developed at the\nIntegrated Circuits Laboratory of Stanford University.\nPROCOM\n(PROcesses of COMpounds) is a 2/3-dimensional process simulation software package for compound semiconductor growth by\nMetal-Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD). Given the deposition reactor geometry, chemical species and growth\ncondition parameters, PROCOM predicts the semiconductor film growth rate, composition, thickness uniformity, dopant\nincorporation and defect distribution based on detailed chemical kinetics and mass/heat transfer models.\nReferences"
