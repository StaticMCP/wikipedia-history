He played in all of the Welsh games of that term.\nIn the following season, he was one of four Aberavon RFC players who played against the touring All Blacks (the others being fellow second row Max Wiltshire, centre Ian Hall and debutant full-back Paul Wheeler). His final test was against England in 1968.\nHe captained Aberavon RFC in the 1969–70 and 1970-1 seasons playing on until the club's centenary season of 1976-7.\nDuring his career he formed a formidable club second row partnership firstly with Max Wiltshire and later with Allan Martin, both fellow internationals.\nAfter retirement he became a selector at Aberavon RFC. His mother, Evelyn Mainwaring, who died in 2004, was a vociferous supporter of Aberavon; her \"often deafening\" words of advice and humour delivered from the stand made her popular throughout the rugby fraternity in Wales. On one occasion, when her son got into a fracas with Gareth Edwards, she shouted: \"Put him down, Billy, he's playing for Wales on Saturday!\"\nReferences"
