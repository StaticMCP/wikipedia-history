He obtained a diploma with honours from the Royal Agricultural College. In 1927, Ash authored the two-volume Dogs: Their History and Development. The book was originally two million words in length but was reduced at the publisher's request to 500,000. The book has been described as a \"remarkable modern work\". In the 1930s, Ash was considered one of the world's greatest authorities on dogs. He used the pseudonyms A. D. Brasset and A. D. Fielding.\nFrom 1911 to 1921, Ash worked as a farmer at Wickham Market in Suffolk. He was a member of the East Suffolk County Council. Ash married Judith Nora in 1913 at Trimley St Mary and they resided at Dallinghoo Hall, Wickham Market. They had three daughters. He joined the British Army in February 1916 and served in the Royal Field Artillery. In 1922, Ash pursued a divorce from his wife over alleged misconduct but there was insufficient evidence presented in court.\nIn 1929, Ash's private secretary Edna Mary Hine hanged herself at his residence in Ramsden Heath. She had suffered from appendicitis but feared an operation and commented to others that she \"preferred to be dead\". In 1930, he purchased Lawn House at Ramsden Heath with 14 acres of land on a seven's years lease. Ash filed for bankruptcy in 1932.\nDeath\nAsh was found dead in a gas filled nursery of his home at Manston, Kent in 1938. His wife had discovered his body after she returned from the cinema.\nSelected publications\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences"
