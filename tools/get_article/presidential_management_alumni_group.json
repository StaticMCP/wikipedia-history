PMAG is not sponsored by OPM. Members are former and current Fellows and other individuals interested in recruitment and development of Federal Government career managers. PMAG sponsors professional and social activities, maintains a network among the over 3,500 former Fellows, and provides support to maintain the PMF Program as the Federal Government's premier mechanism for recruiting future managers.\nExternal links\n* [http://www.pmag.org/  - Official Website for the Presidential Management Alumni Group]\n*[http://www.facebook.com/pages/Presidential-Management-Alumni-Group/129956463712676?sk=info facebook site]\nReferences"
