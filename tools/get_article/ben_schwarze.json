He is the brother of Troy Schwarze.\nHe was originally Rookie listed from the Sandringham Dragons by St Kilda in the 2002 Rookie Draft, remaining on the Saints list for the 2002 and 2003 seasons. After being delisted by the Saints, Schwarze spent the 2004 season playing with Port Melbourne Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL) before being drafted by the Kangaroos with selection 68 of the 2004 AFL draft.\nHe made his debut against the Adelaide Crows in Round 7, 2006 at the Telstra Dome. He broke his ribs in that game and was sidelined for four weeks. He returned and became a regular for the remainder of the season. Despite this, Schwarze was delisted by the Kangaroos at the end of the 2006 season, and moved to South Australia to play for Woodville-West Torrens for two seasons before switching to North Adelaide for the 2009 season.\nReferences\nExternal links"
