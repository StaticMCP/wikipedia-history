Its shape can be oval, round, octagonal, rectangular, or square.\nIt can be made of metal, ceramic, plastic, glass or wood. Plain and ornate platters suitable for more formal settings or occasions are made of, or plated with, silver, and antique examples are considered quite valuable. Especially expensive and ceremonial platters have been made of gold. Sizzling platters are heated so that the food on them sizzles; they are usually made of metal with an underliner.\nIn restaurant terminology, a platter is often a main dish served on a platter with one or more side dishes, such as a salad or french fries.\nNotable platters includes the Colombian bandeja paisa, Indian thali or Arabic mixed-meat platters.\nGallery\nFile:14th June 2014 Badar's Mix Platter.jpg|Mixed Arabic meat platter served on a bed of rice, in a restaurant in the United Kingdom\nFile:Sadya 2019.jpg|Sadya, a traditional platter originated from the Indian state of Kerala, served on Banana leaf\nFile:Seven fruits platter (8475320398).png|A platter of fruits\nFile:Spanish Cheeses and European cheeses on plate.jpg|Five of Cheese on the platter\nCarne a la tampiqueña.jpg|Carne a la tampiqueña on a platter.\nSalad platter.jpg|A salad platter.\nFile:Thorramatur.jpg|An Icelandic platter with goat head, head cheeses and cold meat\nFile:Fish finger sandwich at The Fox Inn public house at Finchingfield, Essex, England.jpg|Fish Finger Sandwich platter\nBandeja paisa 30062011.jpg|Bandeja paisa is a typical meal popular in Colombian cuisine.
