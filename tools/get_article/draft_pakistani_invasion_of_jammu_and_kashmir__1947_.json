The invasion began after Pashtun tribesmen intervened against the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir amidst internal violence in the state, including the Poonch rebellion. This invasion resulted in the capture of several Western districts of Jammu and Kashmir, which were subsequently incorporated into the new state of Azad Kashmir.\nThe invasion, codenamed Operation Gulmarg, failed to take the Kashmiri capital of Srinagar due to the plodding invasion by the Pakistani-backed tribesmen, who slowed down their advance to loot and plunder occupied territory rather than continue their advance on Srinagar. Maharaja Hari Singh of Jammu and Kashmir was unable to repulse the tribal invasion with his state forces, which led him to seek aid from India. However, India set the condition that it would only aid Jammu and Kashmir against the Pakistani invasion if it acceded to India. Due to coercion by Indian Governor-General Lord Mountbatten, Hari Singh agreed to this condition and acceded to the Indian Union on 26 October 1947.\nAfter Jammu and Kashmir's accession to India, the Indian government deployed troops to the state to repulse the Pakistani invasion, with command placed under Lieutenant Colonel Dewan Ranjit Rai to defend Srinagar. Indian forces successfully defended Srinagar's only airfield, thus preserving India's logistics to supply its forces in Jammu and Kashmir, and Indian troops also repulsed the Pakistani tribesmen to Uri. By May 1948, Pakistan deployed its regular army into Jammu and Kashmir, and the war eventually resulted in a stalemate and the Karachi Agreement, which partitioned the princely state; one-third of the state was given to Pakistan, with Indian control over the remainder.\nBackground\nReferences"
