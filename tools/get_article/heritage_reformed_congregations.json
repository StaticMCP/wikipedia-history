However, 780 of the one thousand members of the church could not accept the deposition of their pastor, elders, and deacons.\nThe consistory felt compelled to form a new denomination named the Heritage Netherlands Reformed Congregation (renamed the Heritage Reformed Congregations in 2003), while Joel R. Beeke continued ministering to the church. Eight other churches soon joined the Grand Rapids congregation to form a new denomination, bringing the denominational membership to about two thousand.“Testimony of Dr. Joel Beeke,” SermonAudio, May 5, 2013, . 40:24–42:41.\nIn 1995, the denomination founded Puritan Reformed Theological Seminary. Later, the seminary was supported by the Free Reformed Churches of North America.\nStarting in the 2010s, the denomination began a dialogue with the Free Reformed Churches of North America about a possible denominational merger. In 2017, the two denominations held simultaneous synods to discuss the proposed merger.\nDoctrine\nThe churches of the Heritage Reformed Congregations subscribe to the Three Forms of Unity (the Heidelberg Catechism, the Belgic Confession of Faith, and the Canons of Dort) and the Westminster Standards (the Westminster Confession of Faith, the Westminster Larger Catechism, and the Westminster Shorter Catechism). The denomination affirms the authority, inspiration, and inerrancy of the Bible and promotes Reformed experiential preaching.\nInterdenominational relations\nThe denomination is a member of the North American Presbyterian and Reformed Council and the International Conference of Reformed Churches.\nMinistries\nThe denomination has five publishing ministries:\n* The Banner of Sovereign Grace Truth (the denominational periodical)\n* The Banner of Truth Tract Mission (the denominational tract ministry)\n* Glad Tidings (the denominational missions periodical)\n* The Gospel Trumpet (the denominational sermon periodical)\n* Inheritance Publishers (a ministry that republishes sermons in the Reformed tradition from the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries)\nCongregations\nThe Heritage Reformed Congregations consist of ten congregations.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:50%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | List of Heritage Reformed Congregations\n|-\n!
