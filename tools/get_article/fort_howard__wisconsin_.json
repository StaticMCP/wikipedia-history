It was located along the west bank of the Fox River in Green Bay, Wisconsin.\nHistory\nAlong with Fort Crawford at Prairie du Chien, Fort Howard was constructed during the War of 1812 to protect the Fox-Wisconsin Waterway, an important regional trade and travel route between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River, from British invasion. The fort was built at the site of the earlier French Fort La Baye (and renamed Fort Edward Augustus by the British in 1761). The initial estimate of its building cost was $16,644.70.

Fort Howard was reoccupied two years later. Abandoned again in 1841, when the garrison was sent to Florida during the Seminole Wars, the fort was officially decommissioned in 1853.\nIn 1863, the United States government granted land to the States of Michigan and Wisconsin for construction of a military road between Fort Howard and Fort Wilikins near Copper Harbor, Michigan. This road was completed in 1872.\nFollowing the fort's closure its buildings fell into decay. Several structures were subsequently removed to the Camp Smith site, where they are now part of the Heritage Hill State Historical Park. Three of the fort's remaining structures are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: the hospital, hospital ward, and officers' quarters.\nLater use of name\nIn the 20th century, the Fort Howard Paper Company was a pulp and paper manufacturer based in Green Bay, founded by Austin E. Cofrin in 1919. It merged with James River in 1997 to form Fort James Corporation and became part of Georgia-Pacific in 2000.\nImages\nFile:Fort Howard Company Kitchen and Orderly Room Heritage Hill State Historical Park.jpg|Kitchen\nFile:Fort Howard Hospital Restorations June 2014.jpg|Hospital during 2014 restoration\nFile:FortHowardOfficersQuartersDiningArea.jpg|Dining area in Officers' Quarters\nFile:Fort Howard Officers Quarters June 2014 at Heritage Hill State Historic Park.jpg|Side of Officers' Quarters\nFile:FortHowardPanoramaSoutheast.jpg|Looking southeast at courtyard\nFile:FortHowardYardPanoramaNorthwest.jpg|Looking northwest across courtyard\nFile:Fort Howard Post School June 2014 Heritage Hill State Historical Park.jpg|School\nFile:FortHowardHospitalWardHeritageHill.jpg|Ward\nFile:Guard House from Fort Howard during 2014 construction at Heritage Hill State Historical Park.jpg|Guard house during 2014 reconstruction\nNotes\nExternal links\n* [http://www.heritagehillgb.org/ Heritage Hill State Historical Park]\n* [http://archive.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/103973893.html/ History buffs launch search for Fort Howard's footprint]"
