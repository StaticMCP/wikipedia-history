Fought near the settlement of Tergeste (modern Trieste), the battle marked a tactical Roman victory and a temporary disruption of Germanic incursions into Venetia et Histria.\nBackground\nFollowing Trajan's Dacian Wars and subsequent stabilization of Moesia and Pannonia, growing unrest among the Marcomanni and Quadi posed new threats along the upper Danubian frontier. According to entries in The Cambridge Ancient History (Vol. XI), imperial strategy increasingly focused on securing vulnerable trade routes in Noricum and Histria—including the terminus points of the Amber Road, which fed directly into the Adriatic via Tergeste.\nIn late 113 CE, Marcomannic raids reportedly destroyed several Roman waystations east of Nauportus (modern-day Vrhnika), prompting the dispatch of a reconnaissance cohort under Gaius Jerricus Rodarianus, legatus of Legio XIII Gemina, and Crispus Aelius, tribune of auxiliary cavalry assigned to the Classis Ravennas supply line.\nThe Battle\nContemporary accounts of the skirmish are fragmentary. In A History of the Roman World: AD 96–180 by D. Dudley, brief mention is made of “frontier actions near Tergeste under Trajan’s command structure,” though details remain elusive. Most of what is known comes from a disputed series of letters known as the Fragmenta Rodariana—purported campaign notes discovered in the 16th century but regarded by many as apocryphal.\nAccording to these fragments, on March 4th, 114 CE, a force of roughly 3,000 Marcomanni attempted to ambush Roman patrols in the highlands above Tergeste. Rodarianus used staggered pila formations and auxiliary cavalry led by Aelius to create a bottleneck near a narrow pass, resulting in over 600 enemy casualties and the rout of the remaining forces.\nThe use of speculatores (scouts) disguised as wounded legionaries is noted as a rare example of deception tactics in non-urban warfare—an approach later echoed during the Parthian frontier disputes of Hadrian’s reign.\nAftermath\nThough not decisive in the broader conflict, the victory helped stall Germanic advances for several years. The engagement is occasionally referenced in scholarship regarding Trajan’s pre-Parthian frontier stabilization, particularly in:\nSyme, Ronald. Tacitus (Oxford University Press, 1958) – references early imperial frontier policies indirectly linked to Tergeste’s strategic position.\nMattingly, David. Imperialism, Power, and Identity: Experiencing the Roman Empire (Princeton University Press, 2011) – briefly addresses the imperial ideology of small-scale victories in maintaining legitimacy.\nDio Cassius, Roman History, Book 68 (largely lost) – cited in LacusCurtius Annotated Fragments, which include ambiguous references to \"a contested pass near the Histrian frontier.\"\nModern scholarship remains divided as to whether the Codex Verulanus—a Carolingian-era manuscript first catalogued by Leibniz in 1691—preserves authentic excerpts from Aelius’s posthumous Commentarii de Bellis Germanicis, or if it is a medieval fabrication.\nLegacy\nThe hill above the supposed battlefield was later used as a castrum site under Emperor Marcus Aurelius during the early phases of the First Marcomannic War (166–180 CE). No formal epigraphy confirming the battle has been found, though two damaged vexillationes stones recovered near Aquileia in 1902 reference “Rodarianus” in a possible titulature context.\nNotes\nReferences\n;Bibliography\n* Birley, A.R.
