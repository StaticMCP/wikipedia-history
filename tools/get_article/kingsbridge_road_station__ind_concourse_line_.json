Located within the Fordham Manor and Kingsbridge Heights neighborhoods in the Bronx, it is served by the D train at all times and the B train weekdays only. It has three tracks and two island platforms.\nHistory\nThis station was built as part of the IND Concourse Line, which was one of the original lines of the city-owned Independent Subway System (IND). The route of the Concourse Line was approved to Bedford Park Boulevard on June 12, 1925 by the New York City Board of Transportation. Construction of the line began in July 1928. The station opened on July 1, 1933, along with the rest of the Concourse subway.\nElevators at the station opened in December 2014, making it compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced in 2024 that it would replace the station's existing waist-high turnstiles with taller, wide-aisle turnstiles.\nStation layout\n{|table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=50|G\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=150|Street level\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=500|196th Street exit/entrance\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|B1\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|Upper mezzanine\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|Fare control (not ADA-accessible)\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" rowspan=5 valign=top|B2Platform level\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|Northbound local\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|←  toward  rush hours and select midday trips (Terminus)←  toward  (Bedford Park Boulevard)\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Island platform\n|-\n|Peak direction express\n| ←  PM rush toward Norwood–205th Street (Bedford Park Boulevard)  AM rush toward  () →\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Island platform\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Southbound local\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|  toward  rush hours and select midday trips (Fordham Road) →  toward Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue (Fordham Road) →\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|B3\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Lower mezzanine\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Kingsbridge Road exit/entrance, fare control, station agent Elevator at northeast corner of Grand Concourse (service road) and East Kingsbridge Road.\n|}\nThe station has three tracks and two island platforms. The tile band in this station is Marine Blue and vent chambers are also present. White walls exist at the two northernmost platform staircases to the Kingsbridge Road exit. It is not known why they were built.\nThe station was renovated to comply with ADA standards, with one elevator from each platform to the Kingsbridge Road mezzanine underneath it, and another from the mezzanine to the northeast corner of the Concourse and Kingsbridge Road.\nExits\nThe station has one mezzanine above the platforms and another below them. The part-time and unstaffed entrance is at 196th Street on the north end and contains two street stairs to the northwest and southeast corners of the intersection, and one stair to each platform. This mezzanine is above the platform area.\nThe full-time entrance with a staffed token booth is at Kingsbridge Road on the south end and contains three pairs of staircases from platform level down to the lower mezzanine. Exits to the street are via a staircase to either northern corner of Kingsbridge Road and Grand Concourse; the exit to the northeastern corner also has an elevator. A ramp also leads to the north side of the Kingsbridge Road underpass, below the Grand Concourse.\nThe current booth setup (full-time at Kingsbridge; part-time at 196th Street) was instituted in 2013. This was also the original setup. From a booth operation switch in the 1990s until the switch in 2013, the part-time side was at the current full-time side (Kingsbridge) and vice versa. The current setup was created in order to accommodate new elevators in the station.\nThere is a closed passageway that begins next to the current exit to the Kingsbridge Road underpass, which led to an exit on the south side of the underpass. This exit is sealed by a concrete wall, and the stair to the passageway is walled off. During the summer of 2019, the underpass was the center of unsanitary conditions, a hangout spot for the homeless and a hotspot for fights and drug addicts. As a safety measure, the walkway was sealed off to the public on July 10, 2020.\nBoth exits to Kingsbridge Road and Grand Concourse also have closed passageways to both southern corners of the same intersection. They are sealed on street level. The passageway to the southwestern corner is blocked by a metal wall, and the one to the southeastern corner was walled off following the installation of the elevator shaft to the northeast corner.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* MTA — [https://web.archive.org/web/20130531072345/http://mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/130128_1030_TRANSIT.pdf#page=163 Kingsbridge Road Station Plan]\n*\n* Station Reporter — [https://web.archive.org/web/20150113015342/http://www.stationreporter.net/btrain.htm B Train]\n* Station Reporter — [https://web.archive.org/web/20150112231643/http://www.stationreporter.net/dtrain.htm D Train]\n* The Subway Nut — [http://www.subwaynut.com/ind/kingsbridged/index.html Kingsbridge Road Pictures]\n* [https://maps.google.com/?ll=40.865947,-73.894199&spn=0.001424,0.004823&layer=c&cbll=40.865949,-73.894197&panoid=M9QC5R3lV_S9CrUjINyqng&cbp=12,3.92,,2,4.96&t=m&z=18 Kingsbridge Road underpass entrance from Google Maps Street View]\n* [https://www.google.com/maps/@40.8661622,-73.8941323,3a,75y,102.22h,85t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1ssjvhD90EhVWjs0GEK01oHw!2e0!5s20160601T000000!7i13312!8i6656 Kingsbridge Road entrance from Google Maps Street View]\n* [https://www.google.com/maps/@40.8678522,-73.8928335,3a,75y,157.72h,86.29t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s19OQ6ryGHokYcnagTZERig!2e0!5s20140601T000000!7i13312!8i6656 196th Street entrance from Google Maps Street View]\n* [https://www.google.com/maps/@40.8669357,-73.8936844,3a,75y,280.57h,89.62t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s-FmdYXClW-S0%2FWH2A6tSmOgI%2FAAAAAAAAboU%2F-TTtm7CMbAE58wpeU0k_Lv4XOCCpGggJACLIB!2e4!6s%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2F-FmdYXClW-S0%2FWH2A6tSmOgI%2FAAAAAAAAboU%2F-TTtm7CMbAE58wpeU0k_Lv4XOCCpGggJACLIB%2Fw203-h100-p-k-no%2F!7i8000!8i4000!4m3!8m2!3m1!1e1!6m1!1e1 Platforms from Google Maps Street View]"
