He studied at New York University from where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1947 and a Master of Arts in 1949. Between 1951 and 1953, Cilley was an Assistant Professor of Drama at the University of Texas, after which he decided to enroll at the Seminary of the Southwest where he trained for the priesthood and earned his Master of Divinity in 1956. He was also awarded a Doctor of Divinity by the seminary and the University of the South.\nOrdained ministry\nCilley was ordained deacon in July 1956 and priest in June 1957 by Bishop John E. Hines of Texas. He initially served as assistant and later as rector of St Thomas' Church in College Station, Texas, between 1956 and 1958, and episcopal chaplain at the \tAgricultural and Mechanical College of Texas. In 1958, he was appointed rector of Holy Comforter in Angleton, Texas, where he remained until his transfer to Trinity Church in Galveston, Texas, in 1962. While at Trinity, he also undertook several posts within the diocese and served as a deputy to six General Conventions. Cilley was also involved as a consultant to the Prayer Book Revision Committee between 1967 and 1973.\nEpiscopacy\nIn 1975, Cilley was elected Suffragan Bishop of Texas and was consecrated on March 20, 1976, by Presiding Bishop John Allin.
