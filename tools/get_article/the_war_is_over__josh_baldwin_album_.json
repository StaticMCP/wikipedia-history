The album was released on May 26, 2017, by Bethel Music, the album being his first solo release with the label. Bobby Strand produced the album.\nBackground\nAfter joining the Bethel Music collective in 2014, Josh Baldwin and his family moved from North Carolina to Redding, California, in August 2015. This cross-country move is cited as having influenced the album's creative direction due to the blending of sonic elements which reflect Baldwin's Southern origins and his placement in Bethel Music and Redding.\nPromotion\nThe earliest mention of The War Is Over dates as far back as March 2017 when announcements on Christian digital outlets Cross Rhythms and Louder Than The Music that the album will be released via Bethel Music on May 26.\nOn May 5, 2017, Bethel Music announced the pre-order of the album, having made three tracks and one music video available as pre-order singles prior to the album's release, the songs were \"Get Your Hopes Up\", \"Endlessly\" and \"The War Is Over\" and the music video of \"Abraham\". A press release to affirm the album's launch date as well as its full track listing via The Media Collective was issued on May 9, 2017.\nTo further promote the album, on May 19, 2017, a free exclusive stream of the album was made available on WorshipU, Bethel Music's online worship school, also prior to the album's release.\nSingles\n\"Get Your Hopes Up\" was released on May 26, 2017, as the lead single from the album. The song impacted Christian radio on June 30, 2017.\nCritical reception\n| rev2 = The Christian Beat\n| rev2Score =\n| rev3 = Jay's Musik Blog\n| rev3Score = 4.5/5\n| rev4 = Louder Than The Music\n| rev4Score =\n| rev5 = NewReleaseToday\n| rev5Score =\n| rev6 = Today's Christian Entertainment\n| rev6Score =\n}}\nKevin Sparkman of CCM Magazine rated the album four stars out of five, saying that the songs are \"the blend feels organic, and the album expectedly swells with the rich textures of electric guitars and strings we've come to love.\" Indicating in a four-point-three star review at The Christian Beat, Madeleine Dittmer states, \"The War Is Over is all about the journey.
