He named his station Butcher's Hill after Butcher’s Hill Farm in Littleport, Cambridgeshire, England where he lived as a child.  It was also known as Turalba Station. The locality was variously known as being in the Cooktown or Laura districts. In September 1899 Earl's daughter Sarah Campbell Earl of Turalba Station married Samuel William Wellington Cook, a part owner of the adjacent Spring Vale Station. These two stations comprise the majority of the current locality of Lakeland.\nMining had commenced on the West Normanby Goldfield by the end of 1874. This goldfield should not be confused with the Normanby Goldfield near Bowen, which opened in 1871. Mining continued intermittently, depending on gold prices, until 1999.\nThe Normanby Diggings Native Mounted Police camp was located on the West Normanby River just south-east of Butchers Hill and operated for 7 years between 1885 and 1892.\nThe Normanby Reefs Post Office was renamed Earlton (Earltown) Post Office in 1890. It was closed in December 1892.\nClive J Foyster was an entrepreneur, mining company chief and farmer who bought Butchers Hill in 1968.  In a private venture known as Lakeland Downs development began with the clearing of land intended for agriculture, and two irrigation dams were constructed. Dry land and irrigated cropping commenced with plantings of maize and sorghum and later of peanuts and coffee.  More intensive cattle grazing also commenced.  Eventually  were cleared. In the 1980s Lakeland Downs was sold, divided into freehold farms averaging about .\nLakeland Downs is named for William (Billy) Lakeland who was one of the earliest prospectors of Cape York Peninsula. The township of Lakeland Downs came into being to service this development, and is now known as Lakeland.\nButcher's Hill State School opened on 23 August 1969.

It becomes a thick mat that can smother native aquatic plants, alter stream flow, and deplete oxygen levels for aquatic organisms. It is most likely to grow in freshwater creeks and in wetlands, and is usually spread by the movement of water plants, aquariums or watercraft. Biosecurity Queensland and Cook Shire Council are working on the complete eradication of salvinia as well as hymenachne (marsh grass), which is another aquatic weed. Report any suspected outbreaks to Cook Shire Council.]]\nAt Lakeland, most of the irrigation water comes from farm dams. Licenses are required to extract surface or bore water for irrigation purposes. In 2012, there were 16 licenses to impound water in the Normanby catchment, with most occurring in the Lakeland area. Many of the dams are located on small creeks. Honey Dam is the largest on Bullhead Creek, which flows into the Laura River. Dams are only permitted to store wet season run off.\nThe main products are cattle and cropping, including bananas.\nIn April 2022, a 10.8 MWac solar PV with a 1.4MWac/5.3MWh BESS solar farm was opened south of the township.\nEducation\nLakeland State School is a government primary (Early Childhood-6) school for boys and girls on the corner of Peninsula Developmental Road and the Mulligan Highway ().

Queensland, 2009]]\nIn 2016 the Queensland Government purchased Springvale Station, a  property situated in the east of the locality. Springvale Station was purchased to add to the State's protected area network and complement activities being taken to reduce sediment run-off entering the Normanby River catchment that flows into Princess Charlotte Bay and the Great Barrier Reef. The Department of Environment and Science contracted Cape York Natural Resource Management (Cape York NRM) to work with traditional owners, Griffith University, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, and erosion, water quality and vegetation scientists to develop the Springvale Erosion Management Plan.\nSpringvale Station Nature Refuge provides important habitat for endangered or vulnerable flora and fauna including the Cooktown orchid, ghost bat, northern quoll, red goshawk, spectacled flying-fox, spotted-tailed quoll, Semon's leaf nosed bat and large eared-horseshoe bat. There is no public access on the Nature Refuge.\nAmenities\nLakeland has a hotel, a cafe, and roadhouse and a hardware store.\nAttractions\nJames Earl Lookout is off the Mulligan Highway,  SSE of the town ().\nSee James Earl for more information regarding the lookout namesake.\nTransport\nLakeland Airport (YLND) is located north of the township, beside the Mulligan Highway.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Trezise, P.J. 1969.
