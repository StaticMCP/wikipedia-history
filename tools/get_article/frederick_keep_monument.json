The male figure stands closely on her proper left side with his proper right arm behind her. Both of the figures are bare chested and wear loosely draped Roman-style drapery that is rolled at the waist, as well as Roman sandals. The female figure has a cape on over the back of her head and she looks downward. The male figure gazes out to the distance. They stand in front of a narrow granite wall.\nThe lower right side of the sculpture is signed: J. E.

His wife, Florence, was the sister of Mabel Thorp Boardman, one of the founders of the American Red Cross, and American socialite Josephine Porter Boardman. Her father, William J. Boardman, a lawyer and philanthropist who died August 2, 1915, is also buried in Rock Creek Cemetery.\nFlorence socialized with U.S. Secretary of State John Hay, Agnes Meyer, Katharine Graham, Ruth Draper, and President William Taft and his wife. A number of Keep's personal belongings were donated to the National Museum of American History by her sister Josephine, including a late 1920s evening dress that was exhibited in the Hall of American Costume from 1964-1973.\nCondition\nThis sculpture was surveyed in 1993 for its condition and was described as needing treatment urgently.\nReferences\nSources\n*James M.
