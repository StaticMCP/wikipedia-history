This article documents malware!DO NOT download and run any linked samples on your main PC, or else it can result in your data being deleted! Please make sure to only run them on a virtual machine when testing the samples!\nGDI malwares are malwares made for the Windows operating system that have been developed by various creators. None of these malwares are intended for malicious purposes, they are instead meant to be tested for educational purposes, usually in VMware or VirtualBox.\nExecution\nUpon execution, they often display 2 warnings, asking the user if they want to run the malware, to prevent further execution by users who are running it on their main device. If the user answers \"Yes\" to both warnings, the malware will run.\nGDI payloads\nThe main part of these malwares are the GDI effects. Each payload features GDI visual effects on the screen and Bytebeat sounds.\nOther payloads\nSome malwares have other non-GDI payloads, including:\n* Displaying a fake error message.\n* Shaking open windows.\n* Opening random system programs.\nDestructive payloads\nSome GDI malwares have safe versions that do not have the destructive payloads listed below, but still have the GDI payloads.\nDestructive versions of GDI malware can run the following destructive payloads:\n* Overwrite the Master Boot Record.\n* Disable Task Manager, Registry Editor, Command Prompt, and other important Windows utilities.\n* Corrupt the BCD.\n* Unmount all drives.\nFinal destruction\nOnce the malware runs its last payload, the system will crash with a Blue Screen of Death. The system will then reboot to an overwritten MBR, showing either an image or some text, depending on the malware.\nExamples of GDI malwares\nPankoza\n* Trihydridoarsenic.exe\n* Gadolinium.exe\n* xpmalwrdest.exe\n* destr3ktdows.exe\n* Heptoxide.exe\n* Triphenylarsine.exe\n* Technetium.exe\n* xgqgxtxxgs.exe\n* rwqvhhbsld.exe\n* trichloromethane.exe\n* Holmium.exe\n* salinewin.exe\n* ksdcbrctys.exe\n* MS 0735.6+7421.exe\n* DETTAMROFNIW.exe\n* wgwcpdpgbf.exe\n* dhzfxwwdll.exe\n* oxhzulzwrt.exe\n* jwzyexgnlc.exe\n* 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin.exe\n* btfoiuthns.exe\n* Olthaltlzpz.exe\n* Cytochalasin.exe\n* Getaparane.exe\n* Hexachlorocyclohexane.exe\n* xjmjivqdmpn.exe\n* dlwxzypwwzdtd.exe\n* kclglegrgq.exe\n* Phenylsilatrane.exe\n* webm.exe\n* Oxymorphazone.exe\n* cdm.exe\n* APM 08279+5255.exe\n* xcf.exe\nReferences"
