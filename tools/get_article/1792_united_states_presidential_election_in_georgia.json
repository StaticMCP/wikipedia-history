The state legislature chose four representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President. Georgia had lost one elector compared to the previous election in 1788–89.\nGeorgia cast four electoral votes for the Independent candidate and incumbent President George Washington, as he ran effectively unopposed. The electoral votes for Vice president were cast for Democratic-Republican George Clinton from New York. These electors were elected by the Georgia General Assembly, the state legislature, rather than by popular vote.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1792 United States presidential election in Georgia\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#F0F071; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Independent\n| George Washington (incumbent)\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | 4\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | Totals\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | 4\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Georgia\nReferences"
