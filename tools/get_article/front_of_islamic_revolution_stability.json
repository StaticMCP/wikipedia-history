The front is partly made up of former ministers of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Taqi Yazdi is said to be the \"spiritual leader\" behind the group.\nThe front declares that it stands against both \"sedition\" (2009 Iranian presidential election protests) and the \"deviant current\". Rajanews website is its online mouthpiece.\nViews\nThe Economist described them as \"Shia supremacists who oppose any kind of compromise with anyone inside or outside Iran\".\nThe group's influence extends to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), where they've strategically positioned clerics and commanders who share their hardline ideologies. Many of the recent generation's commanders have undergone extensive training at summer camps conducted by clerics from this group.\nHistory\nIn 2013, the front supported Saeed Jalili for president after Kamran Bagheri Lankarani's withdrawal, and it released electoral lists for local elections in several cities, with a landslide victory in Mashhad City Council.\nIn recent years, the group has been influential in passing new laws, such as chastity laws, and in attempts to reinstate the mandatory hijab, which had seen a de facto suspension following widespread protests in 2022.\nElection results\nPresident\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:100%; line-height:16px;\"\n|-\n!Election\n!Candidate\n!Votes\n!%\n!Rank\n|-\n||2013\n||Saeed Jalili\n|4,168,946\n|11.36%\n|3rd\n|-\n||2017\n||Ebrahim Raisi\n|15,786,449\n|38.28%\n|2nd\n|-\n||2021\n||Ebrahim Raisi\n|18,021,945\n|62.90%\n|1st\n|-\n||2024\n||Saeed Jalili\n|13,538,179\n|45.24%\n|2nd\n|}\nParliament\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:100%; line-height:16px;\"\n|-\n!Election\n!Seats\n!+/−\n!Ref\n|-\n||2012\n||||||\n|-\n||2016\n|||| 58||\n|-\n||2020\n|||| 16||\n|-\n||2024\n|||| 71||\n|}\nCity councils\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:100%; line-height:16px;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Council\n!colspan=\"2\"|2013\n!colspan=\"1\"|2017\n|-\n!Seats\n!Ref\n!Seats\n|-\n||Tehran\n||||\n||\n|-\n||Mashhad\n|||| 3 were elected.}}\n||\n|-\n||Isfahan\n||||\n||\n|}\nMembers\nParty leaders\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:100%; line-height:16px;\"\n|-\n|+ Secretaries-general\n!Name\n!Tenure\n!Ref\n|-\n||Morteza Aghatehrani\n||2011–2021\n||\n|-\n||Sadegh Mahsouli\n||2021–present\n||\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:100%; line-height:16px;\"\n|-\n|+ Deputy secretaries-general\n!Name\n!Tenure\n!Ref\n|-\n||Sadegh Mahsouli\n||2016–2020\n||\n|-\n||TBD\n||\n||\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:100%; line-height:16px;\"\n|-\n|+ Spokespersons\n!Name\n!Tenure\n!Ref\n|-\n||Kamran Bagheri Lankarani\n||2011–2013\n||\n|-\n||Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi\n||2013\n||\n|-\n||Nasser Biria\n||2013–2016\n||\n|-\n||Majid Mottaghifar\n||2016–present\n||\n|}\nCurrent officeholders\n;Parliament members\n* Ahmad Salek (Isfahan)\n* Mohammad Esmaeil Saeidi (Tabriz)\n* Mojtaba Zonnour (Qom)\n* Ahmad Amirabadi (Qom)\n* Javad Karimi-Ghodousi (Mashhad)\n* Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi (Mashhad)\n* Nasrollah Pejmanfar (Mashhad)\n* Ehsan Ghazizadeh Hashemi (Fariman)\n* Hossein Naghavi-Hosseini (Varamin)\n* Mohammad-Mehdi Zahedi (Kerman)\n* Mohammad-Javad Abtahi (Khomeinishahr)\n* Hossein-Ali Haji-Deligani (Shahin Shahr)\n* Alireza Salimi (Mahallat)\nNotes and references"
