It is presumed that the first stone was laid by President Gerardo Barrios on November 21 of that year.\nThe first person in charge of its construction was the English engineer William Kirk who had to leave the project shortly after the death of Barrios. Still unfinished, the temple received the rank of cathedral by papal decree of Pius X, on 11 February 1913. Eight years later, on November 21, 1921, Monsignor Juan Antonio Dueñas y Argumedo proclaimed the Patronage of Our Lady of Peace and gave papal coronation of the image on behalf of Pope Benedict XV. The cathedral was declared completed in 1962 with the promotion of then pastor Oscar Romero,  exactly a century after construction works had started.\nSee also\n}}\n*Roman Catholicism in El Salvador\n*Our Lady Queen of Peace\nReferences"
