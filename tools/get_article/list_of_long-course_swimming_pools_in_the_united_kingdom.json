      "text": "# List of long-course swimming pools in the United Kingdom\n\nThis is an annotated list of swimming pools in the United Kingdom which conform to the Olympic standard. Additionally, it lists other long-course facilities that do not quite come up to the full standard of 50&nbsp;×&nbsp;25 metres, 10 (middle 8 used) lanes.\nAt the start of the 21st century, the provision of 50-metre swimming pools in the United Kingdom was very poor for a developed country. Few universities possessed 50-metre pools, and there was a marked reluctance on the part of municipal authorities to build new public long-course facilities. However, the successful bid to hold the 2012 Summer Olympics in London added impetus to the development of new pools. A number of new venues were completed before and after the Games, although some existing pools were demolished and not replaced by 50-metre facilities.\n, no university in the UK possesses an Olympic standard pool, though several have an 8-lane 50-metre pool. The Aberdeen Aquatics Centre, being part funded by the University of Aberdeen, is the main pool facility for the university.\nOlympic size pools\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Location\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Pool/centre name\n!colspan=\"2\"|Pool dimensions\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Opened\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Further information\n|-\n!Length\n!Width (lanes)\n|-\n|Aberdeen\n|Aberdeen Aquatics Centre\n|align=\"center\"|50&nbsp;m\n|align=\"center\"|25&nbsp;m (10)\n|2014\n|Opened 5 May 2014 as part of the Aberdeen Sports Village complex.\n|-\n|Bangor, County Down\n|Bangor Aurora Aquatic and Leisure Complex\n|align=\"center\"|50&nbsp;m\n|align=\"center\"|25&nbsp;m (10)\n|2013\n|Plus a 7 lane (15m?) x  25m diving pool at the end of the main pool.\n|-\n|Bristol\n|Hengrove Park Leisure Centre\n|align=\"center\"|50&nbsp;m\n|align=\"center\"|25&nbsp;m (10)\n|2012\n|Opened 29 February 2012.\n|-\n|Cardiff\n|Cardiff International Pool\n|align=\"center\"|50&nbsp;m\n|align=\"center\"|25&nbsp;m (10)\n|2008\n|Part of the Cardiff International Sports Village.
