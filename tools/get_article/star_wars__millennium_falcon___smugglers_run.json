Located in Star Wars'': Galaxy's Edge, the attraction opened on May 31, 2019, in Disneyland, and opened on August 29, 2019, in Disney's Hollywood Studios.\nRiders are seated in a 6-passenger motion simulator, themed after the Millennium Falcon. Guests go on an interactive \"smuggling mission\" with each guest on the attraction being assigned a different crew role. The story is set between the films The Last Jedi (2017) and The Rise of Skywalker (2019).\nHistory\nAt the Disney D23 Expo in 2015, Disney first announced the creation of a Star Wars-themed land coming to Disneyland and Disney's Hollywood Studios. In 2017, Disney announced that the new Star Wars-themed land would be called Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge and it would hold two new attractions. Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run was not officially announced until 2018.\nStar Wars: Galaxy's Edge and Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run first opened at Disneyland on May 31, 2019, and the second opened at Disney's Hollywood Studios on August 29, 2019.\nStar Wars: Millennium Falcon – Smugglers Run had wait times ranging from 30 to 60 minutes upon opening day. The ride benefited from having four slowly rotating attraction turntables. Each turntable had multiple Millennium Falcon cockpits. That meant that the downtime was registered if all four turntables of the flight simulator failed simultaneously.\nIn August 2024, it was announced that a new story with The Mandalorian and Grogu will be added to the ride. In March 2025, it was announced that the new version will debut on May 22, 2026, at Disneyland and Disney's Hollywood Studios, which is the same day that the film The Mandalorian and Grogu will be released in theaters. During Star Wars Celebration in April 2025, it was announced the update would feature a choose-your-own-adventure path, allowing guests to visit Tatooine, Coruscant, Bespin or Endor.\nRide experience\nQueue\nSmugglers Run is located in the center of Black Spire Outpost at the entrance to Ohnaka Transport Solutions. The queue begins outside, wrapping around behind a life-size Millennium Falcon parked outside. The queue continues through an engine room/mechanic shop which then leads to the command center where Audio-Animatronics of Hondo Ohnaka and his astromech droid R5-P8 explain what the mission is about. If the animatronic of Hondo is not working, Hondo will instead appear on the left-hand television screen and acknowledge and apologize about the remote communication before explaining the mission. Both characters were first seen in Star Wars: The Clone Wars; as in the series, the animatronic of Hondo is voiced by Jim Cummings. Chewbacca also appears in this attraction.\nEach guest can have one of three jobs—pilot, gunner, or engineer. Guests are grouped into six riders (two of each job) and given a color which is then called when ready to board. While riders wait for their color to be called, they get to explore the inside of the Millennium Falcon. Once their group color is called, riders walk down the corridors of the Millennium Falcon to the flight deck where the ride begins.\nRide\nRiders begin their ride experience by loading into the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon. The two pilots sit in the front row–the left side moves the ship left and right, and the right side moves the ship up and down. The next row holds the gunners who press buttons to shoot down enemies and obstacles in the way. The back row seats the two engineers who work to repair the ship during the flight. If less than six guests are riding, the missing positions are controlled automatically.\nSimilar to Epcot's Mission: SPACE, Smugglers Run is an interactive ride, with every guest having a role in the mission. Lasting about four and a half minutes, the ride takes the guests on a mission led by Hondo Ohnaka and R5-P8 to steal precious cargo from the First Order TIE fighters. How well each rider performs determines the success of the mission. Furthermore, any \"damage\" afflicted to the ship during the run will affect the lighting conditions in the exit corridor.\nThe ride is made up of four turntables each with seven simulators that rotate axpromiatexly every 45 seconds. If the ride is backed up, guests may end up in an asteroid field or receive longer messages from Hondo while they wait for their turn to exit.\nThere is a hidden \"Chewie Mode\" that guests can activate before the ride begins. This mode replaces the usual narration of Hondo Ohnaka with Chewbacca.\nSee also\n* Star Tours – The Adventures Continue\n* Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://disneyland.disney.go.com/attractions/disneyland/millennium-falcon-smugglers-run/ Disneyland Official Website]\n* [https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/attractions/hollywood-studios/millennium-falcon-smugglers-run/ Disney's Hollywood Studios Official Website]"
