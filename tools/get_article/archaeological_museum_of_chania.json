Chalepa.\nThe original museum was located in the former Venetian Monastery of Saint Francis at Chalidon Street. It was established in 1962 and operated until 2020.\nBuilding\nThe exact date that the building of the original museum was constructed is unknown although it was mentioned in writing as standing during the great earthquake of 1595 and being the largest in the city. It served as a Venetian church inhabited by Franciscan friars, and became an important monument of the city.\nDuring the period of the Ottoman occupation, the building was used as a mosque and named after Yussuf Pasha. After World War II it served as a storehouse for military equipment, until it was converted into the museum in 1962.\nIn 2020, the Museum closed and reopened in 2022 at a new location on Skra Street in Halepa.\nFile:AMC - Flavische Büste.jpg|Portrait bust of a Roman man\nFile:AMC - Kaiser Hadrian.jpg|Roman emperor Hadrian\nFile:AMC - Mosaik 2.jpg|Roman floor mosaic depicting Dionysos and Ariadne\nFile:AMC - Sarkophag Armeni 3.jpg|Late Minoan sarcophagus, 1400-1200 BC.\nInterior\nThe museum contains a substantial collection of Minoan and Roman artifacts excavated from around the city of Chania and the surrounding regional unit, including pieces from the ancient cities of Kydonia, Idramia, Aptera, Polyrinia, Kissamos, Elyros, Irtakina, Syia and Lissos, and also from Axos and Lappa in Rethymno regional unit.\nThe museum contains a wide range of coins, jewellery, vases, sculpture, clay tablets with inscriptions, stelae and mosaics.\nThe museum has a Roman floor mosaic, depicting Dionysos and Ariadne.
