The building was built in 1910-11 and has two facades facing streets, which include ten distinctive terracotta gargoyles. It is located at the intersection of Peterson Avenue (U.S. Route 441 southbound) and Ward Street (Georgia State Route 32 westbound).\nHistory\nThe building was built by the Union Banking Company, but it closed in 1930, along with many other banks. The Coffee County Bank was started in 1931 and used the building, which it later bought. It is now a BB&T but they will vacate the property moving down the street to their other location in February 2016. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on December 10, 1982. It is also a contributing building to the 1993 NRHP Downtown Douglas Historic District.\nPhotos\nFile:Union Banking Company Bldg, two gargoyles, Douglas, GA, US.jpg|Two gargoyles\nFile:Union Banking Company Bldg, gargoyle, Douglas, GA, US.jpg|gargoyle\nFile:Union Banking Company Bldg, roof corner, Douglas, GA, US.jpg|The top corner of the two street facades\nFile:Union Banking Company Bldg, gargoyle close-up, Douglas, GA, US.jpg|Close-up of a gargoyle\nFile:Union Bank Building gargoyle, side, Douglas, GA, US 01.jpg|Side view\nFile:Union Bank Building gargoyle, underneath, Douglas, GA, US.jpg|Underneath\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
