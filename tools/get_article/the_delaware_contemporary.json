Founded in 1979 as the Delaware Center for Contemporary Arts (DCCA) it rebranded to its current name in 2015. It is a non-collecting museum focused on work by local, regional, as well as national and international artists.\nThe Delaware Contemporary moved to the Riverfront in Wilmington, Delaware in 2000.  The 33,000-square-foot building includes seven galleries, 26 art studios, an auditorium, a classroom, a museum shop, and administrative offices.\nIn 2008, it ceased charging admission to view the galleries to offer families more affordable cultural choices during the Great Recession.\nSee also\n* Delaware Art Museum\n* List of museums in Delaware\n* University Museums at the University of Delaware\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.decontemporary.org/ Delaware Contemporary]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090129095625/http://www.brandywinetreasures.org/ Brandywine 10]\n* [http://www.riverfrontwilm.com/ Wilmington Riverfront]"
