He was a three times British champion over 110m hurdles and three times British champion over 60m hurdles. King represented Great Britain and England at a number of major international competitions including the delayed 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\nBiography\nKing was a three times British 110 metres hurdles champion (2017, 2019, 2020) and three times British champion over the 60 metres hurdles (2019, 2020, 2023).\nIn 2021, he reached the semi-finals at the delayed 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\nAt the 2022 World Athletics Indoor Championships, King advanced to the final after successfully winning a draw of lots and finished 6th in the final. In the semi-finals, King and Japanese athlete, Shusei Nomoto, tied for the final non-automatic qualifying position with a time of 7.565. As there were no additional lanes available, a drawing of lots took place which saw King advance to the final as a result of his race bib labelled \"King\" being randomly drawn from a bag.\nHaving not raced for almost a year, he announced his retirement from professional athletics in June 2025.\nInternational competitions\n{|\n|-\n!colspan=\"6\"|Representing  and\n|-\n|2013\n|European Junior Championships\n|Rieti, Italy\n|8th (h)\n|110 m hurdles (99&nbsp;cm)\n|13.741\n|-\n|2015\n|European U23 Championships\n|Tallinn, Estonia\n|4th\n|110 m hurdles\n|13.90\n|-\n|2016\n|European Championships\n|Amsterdam, Netherlands\n|15th (sf)\n|110 m hurdles\n|13.54\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2017\n|European Indoor Championships\n|Belgrade, Serbia\n|11th (h)\n|60 m hurdles\n|7.70\n|-\n|World Championships\n|London, United Kingdom\n|33rd (h)\n|110 m hurdles\n|13.67\n|-\n|rowspan=3|2018\n|World Indoor Championships\n|Birmingham, United Kingdom\n|18th (sf)\n|60 m hurdles\n|7.70\n|-\n|Commonwealth Games\n|Gold Coast, Australia\n|10th (h)\n|110 m hurdles\n|13.74\n|-\n|European Championships\n|Berlin, Germany\n|13th (sf)\n|110 m hurdles\n|13.55\n|-\n|2019\n|European Indoor Championships\n|Glasgow, United Kingdom\n|10th (sf)\n|60 m hurdles\n|7.71\n|-\n|2021\n|Olympic Games\n|Tokyo, Japan\n|19th (sf)\n|110 m hurdles\n|13.67\n|-\n|rowspan=3|2022\n|World Indoor Championships\n|Belgrade, Serbia\n|6th\n|60 m hurdles\n|7.62\n|-\n|World Championships\n|Eugene, United States\n|20th (sf)\n|110 m hurdles\n|13.51\n|-\n|European Championships\n|Munich, Germany\n|17th (sf)\n|110 m hurdles\n|13.73\n|-\n|2023\n|European Indoor Championships\n|Istanbul, Turkey\n|7th\n|60 m hurdles\n|7.71\n|-\n|2024\n|World Indoor Championships\n|Glasgow, United Kingdom\n|14th (sf)\n|60 m hurdles\n|7.65\n|}\n1Did not start in the semifinals\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
