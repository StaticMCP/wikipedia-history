The PRL was founded in 1959 by Nazi Boni as a reaction to the attempts by the Voltaic Democratic Union to create a one-party state. Boni built his new party largely out of the ashes of the defunct African Regroupment Party (PRA).\nPRL was short-lived and failed to make any major impact. Boni went into exile in Dakar, Senegal.\nReferences\n*Englebert, Pierre. La Revolution Burkinabè. Paris: L'Harmattan, 1986."
