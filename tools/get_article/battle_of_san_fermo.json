Through the use of a screening force at Olgiate (on the main road from Varese to Camerlata) Garibaldi was able to distract the attention of the Austrians as he led the main force of his army northwards in the direction of the mountains.\nThis force then turned east and approached the San Fermo pass. The Austrians were caught out of guard and the pass was only defended by the small force of Hungarians. The Hungarian troops took up defensive positions in the church of San Fermo and a nearby inn, from where they could command the valley approaches.\nGaribaldi deciding to outflank the Hungarian position and so divided his army into three groups. One flanking party was sent out on each side, one to outflank the church and the other the inn. When the flanking forces attacked the third group, in the centre, launched a full frontal assault on the Hungarian positions in the church and the inn. This group was under the command of Captain , who was one of the first Italians to be killed in the battle.\nDespite a number of losses the Hungarian positions were quickly captured by the Italians. During the course of the Battle of San Fermo fourteen Italians were killed and sixty were wounded.\nAftermath\nGeneral Urban now realised that the pass was in Italian hands, and sent reinforcements up the steep road from Como. Garibaldi's men held off the Austrian attacks, and eventually Urban's army fell back into Como. The Austrians still outnumbered Garibaldi's men, but the defeat on the San Fermo pass had badly affected Urban's morale. While Garibaldi decided if he should risk an attack on the strong Austrian forces he could see in Como, Urban decided to retreat. When Garibaldi's men reached the town after the slow descent from the pass they discovered that it was undefended.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_san_fermo.html Battle of San Fermo, 27 May 1859]\n*[https://comocompanion.com/recreation/walks/san-fermo-to-como-in-the-footsteps-of-garibaldi/ San Fermo to Como – in the footsteps of Garibald"
