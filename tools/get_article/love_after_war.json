Still, this is a consistent showcase for his dextrous singing, which evokes pop/R&B icons from Marvin Gaye to Michael McDonald,\" complimenting \"his ability to serve old-school textures with a fresh and not-too-shiny finish.\"\nCommercial performance\nThe album debuted at number 22 on the Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 41,000 copies in the United States.\nTrack listing\n;Sample credits\n* \"Never Give Up\" contained a sample of José Pablo Moncayo's 1941 piece Huapango.\nPersonnel\nCredits for Love After War adapted from Allmusic.\n* Sarah Alminawi – marketing coordinator\n* Beau Benton – publicity\n* Al Branch – management\n* Moses Burdon – design\n* John Codling – cover painting\n* Larry Cox – bass, Fender Rhodes, organ, piano, strings\n* DJ Mormile – A&R\n* Tiffany Ferguson – A&R\n* Michael \"Mike Banga\" Gahadia – engineer\n* M.
