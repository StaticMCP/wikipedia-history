In the Segua Kingdom, a boy named Gear travels with his childhood friend, Nel, to the capital, seeking to join the Segua Army in order to avenge the death of his best friend Til at the hands of Ninteldo. Segua's vice-general, Ramses, tests Gear by pitting him against 50 of her soldiers, which he defeats instantly with his amazing speed. Impressed by his strength, Ramses enlists Gear in the special forces, alongside an archer named Opal, and tasks them with the mission of rescuing their strongest warrior, General Alex, who is being held prisoner in the Ninteldo-allied country of Tatrand. Later that night, Gear is called out by Opal, who doesn't approve of him and challenges him to a fight for his right to stay in the army. Gear wins instantly with a direct attack, earning her praise after he explains how he admires those who aim to go forward. The next morning, Ramses introduces the third special forces member, a somewhat perverted mercenary named Tejirov, who decides to train Gear for the operation, his barriers winning against Gear's speed.\n}}\n)\n| OriginalAirDate =\n| AltDate         = February 13, 2017\n| ShortSummary    = Tejirov trains Gear, Opal and Nel to use their \"Killer\" abilities, special skills possessed by only a small fraction of people in Consume. Ramses and Tejirov discuss the possibility that Gear is the son of General Alex. Gear asks Tejirov about other Killers especially the strongest ones. The group start their mission to rescue General Alex from Hope Fortress. While on their way, they find a wounded Segua scout who asks to be \"absorbed\". Tejirof and Opal explain that Killers can absorb the life forces of others, gaining their strength, but that there are limits to how many one can absorb (Gear can absorb two). They are interrupted by the appearance of the Vaiz, one of Tatrand's Killers. Tejirov cages him in a wall of light so they can escape. Once inside the fortress, Opal plays decoy so the others can get past D. Fisher, another Tatrand Killer. Tejirov, Gear and Nel reach General Alex's cell, where Gear finds out that he is his father.\n}}\n)\n| OriginalAirDate =\n| AltDate         = February 20, 2017\n| ShortSummary    = General Alex is too wounded to be saved. Tejirov tells Gear that he must instead absorb Alex. He refuses at first, but Alex says he has no choice and forces Gear to touch him. Before he is absorbed, he tells Gear the story of his mother, the only killer Alex considered to be his equal, whom he had to absorb after they were so badly wounded in combat that they could only survive if one of them absorbed the other. Opal is left unable to move after her battle with D. Fisher and is nearly killed by Vaiz's brother Voiz, but it rescued by a newly energized Gear, who joins the siege on the fortress. Tejirov leaves to prevent Bays from interfering with Gear, leaving Opal in Nel's care, but Vaiz surrenders, remarking that the battle is already lost. In the end, Segua takes Hope Fortress, and Gear is given the nickname of \"Blue Sonic\", becoming infamous throughout both the Ninteldo empires and their allied countries.\n}}\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://oab.sakura.ne.jp/gia/index.shtml Official (doujin series) website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20161106015438/http://aoisekai.net/ Micro Magazine (complete edition) website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20170204130727/http://aoisekai.net/anime.html Micro Magazine (TV series) website]\n*[http://sevenseasentertainment.com/series/world-war-blue/ Seven Seas Entertainment page]\n*\n*\n*[http://aoisekaino101.blog103.fc2.com original story verification blog]"
