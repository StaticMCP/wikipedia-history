In the , Mexico had a population of 26 people.\nOn 22 November 2019, the Queensland Government decided to amalgamate the localities in the Barcaldine Region, resulting in five expanded localities based on the larger towns: Alpha, Aramac, Barcaldine, Jericho and Muttaburra. Mexico was incorporated into Jericho.\nGeography\nThe Capricorn Highway and, to its immediate south, the Central Western railway line form the western end of the northern boundary of the locality. The highway and the railway (but with the railway to the north) form the eastern end of the northern boundary, having crossed within the town of Jericho to the immediate north.\nThe Great Dividing Range runs through the western part of the locality from north-east to south-east. Jordan Creek rises in the south of the locality and flows north to Jericho. Like all creeks in the locality west of the range, they are eventually tributaries of the Barcoo River within the Lake Eyre drainage basin, whereas watercourses to the east of the range are within the North East Coast drainage basin flowing into the Coral Sea.\nThe predominant land use is grazing on native vegetation.\nHistory\nThe origin of the name is unclear, but there was a pastoral run called Mexico in 1880s in the area.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Mexico. The nearest primary school is in Jericho. The nearest secondary schools are in Alpha (to Year 10) and Barcaldine (to Year 12). Due to the travelling time involved, alternatives are boarding schools and distance education.\nReferences"
