Originally located on the east side of Wilmington's Market Street between 9th and 10th Streets, the building was used during the American Revolution by British troops as a prison and hospital during the occupation of Wilmington after the Battle of Brandywine, September 12, 1777.  It remained a house of worship until 1840. A cemetery on the site was the final resting place of many noted Wilmingtonians which were reinterred to Wilmington and Brandywine Cemetery and Riverview Cemetery.\nIt was moved to its present site in 1916. In order to move it, it was dismantled and rebuilt with its re-dedication in 1918. It was given to the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in the State of Delaware to maintain and restore. They currently use it as their headquarters and have it open to the public on 2nd Sundays, April–October,\n2-4pm.\nIt was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.  The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America restored the interior to its original condition in 1981.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://nscda.org/?page_id=150&state=DE&prop=268 The National Society of The Colonial Dames of America: THE FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH (1740)]\n*"
