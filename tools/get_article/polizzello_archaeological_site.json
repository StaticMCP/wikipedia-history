It consists of two plateaus of which the upper smallest one is home of Acropolis and place of the first protohistoric and archaic settlement, moreover; the site has an east–west orientation with a single access from east.\nHistorically, the site had three significant phases:\n# Early Bronze Age (19th–16th centuries BC), of which remain some chamber tombs of Castelluccio period and a circular hut with ornaments placed on the eastern side of the mountain.\n# 11th–9th centuries BC with the creation of an Acropolis placed on top of the hill.\n# 8th–6th centuries BC, period of maximum development of the center, of which remains a monumental fence that runs along the edge of the terrace on the hill and a series of circular buildings: Sacelli, places of worship. Inside which exceptional historical artifacts have been found including the Polizzello helmet of Cretan workmanship and a clay figurine of ithyphallic warrior (The Warrior of Polizzello).\nOf the fifth century BC are the remains of the House of Temenos. This is a residential building with multiple rooms.\nSee also\n*Castelluccio Culture\n*\n*Vassallaggi\n*Castelluccio di Noto\nNotes\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20180104224939/http://www.siciliafotografica.it/homesic/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=502%3Ala-civilta-castellucciana&catid=35&Itemid=127 La Civiltà Castellucciana]\n*[http://www.agrigentoguide.it/italia/castelluccio_guide_turistiche_agrigento.htm Luigi Bernabò Brea, La Sicilia prima dei Greci, 1958]\n*\n* [http://www.siciliantica.it/download/07_dario_palermo_davide_tanasi.pdf Dario Palermo e Davide Tanasi, Diodoro a Polizzello]\n*"
