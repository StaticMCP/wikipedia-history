It lies close to sea level south of the Polden Hills, forming a large part of the Somerset Levels and Moors, a wetland area between the Mendips and the Blackdown Hills. The Neolithic people exploited the reed swamps for their natural resources and started to construct wooden trackways, including the world's oldest known timber trackway, the Post Track, dating to the 3800s BC. The Levels were the location of the Iron Age Glastonbury Lake Village as well as two lake villages at Meare Lake. Several settlements and hill forts were built on the natural \"islands\" of slightly raised land, including Brent Knoll and Glastonbury. In the Roman period sea salt was extracted and a string of settlements were set up along the Polden Hills.\nA scheduled monument is a nationally important archaeological site or monument which is given legal protection by being placed on a list (or \"schedule\") by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport; English Heritage takes the leading role in identifying such sites. The legislation governing this is the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. The term \"monument\" can apply to the whole range of archaeological sites, and they are not always visible above ground. Such sites have to have been deliberately constructed by human activity. They range from prehistoric standing stones and burial sites, through Roman remains and medieval structures such as castles and monasteries, to later structures such as industrial sites and buildings constructed for the World Wars or the Cold War.\nThere are 79 scheduled monuments in Sedgemoor. The oldest are Neolithic, Bronze Age or Iron Age including hill forts, bowl barrows and occupied caves including several in Cheddar Gorge. Cannington Camp (which is also known as Cynwit Castle) dates from the Bronze Age, while Brent Knoll Camp between the Somerset Levels and Brean Down is Iron Age (although there are some Bronze Age artefacts) and it was reused in the Roman period. The Romano-British period is represented with several sites. Medieval sites include several motte-and-bailey castles and church or village crosses. Industrial development, particularly in Bridgwater, are represented by brick and tile kilns and a telescopic railway bridge. The most recent monuments are World War II bunkers and bombing decoys on Black Down. The monuments are listed below using the titles given in the English Heritage data sheets.\nMonuments\n| show_architect = no\n| architect =\n| show_listed = no\n| date_listed = 26 November 1969\n| grid_ref = ST 31297 46794\n| lat = 51.2162\n| lon = -2.9850\n| show_notes =yes\n| notes = The site was used in the Iron Age and again during the Romano-British and Medieval periods.

Originally Athelney was a small island in swampland. Following the dissolution it was acquired for use as a private residence by Lord Audley who had the church demolished. With the church demolished and other buildings fallen into disrepair, nothing visible remains at the site today. The site of the Abbey is marked by King Alfred's Monument which is a Grade II listed building.\n| uid = 1019099\n| show_img = yes\n| image = King Alfreds Monument.jpg\n| upload_desc =\n| show_ref = yes\n| reference =\n| commonscat =\n| show_wikidata= no\n| wikidata = Q4813330\n}}\n| show_architect = no\n| architect =\n| show_listed = no\n| date_listed = 17 November 1972\n| grid_ref = ST 33312 29034\n| lat = 51.0568\n| lon = -2.9529\n| show_notes =yes\n| notes = Earthworks remain of a burh which was important during the reign of Alfred the Great.

The north side of the hill has been destroyed by quarrying during the 19th and 20th centuries. Minor excavations were carried out in 1905, 1913 (Bezell), and 1963 (Rahtz). Flint tools, scrapers and flakes have been found on or near the hill, indicating Mesolithic occupation. Bronze Age finds include an axe head and a knife.

The cave is  deep and is  long, and contains a variety of large chambers and rock formations. It contains the Cheddar Yeo, the largest underground river system in Britain. The cave contained skeletal remains of both humans and animals, all showing cut-marks and breakage consistent with de-fleshing and eating. In 1903 the remains of a human male, since named Cheddar Man, were found a short distance inside Gough's Cave.  He is Britain's oldest complete human skeleton, having been dated to approximately 7150 B.C. A Skull cup dating from 14,700 B.C. has been uncovered at the site. The first  of the cave are open to the public as a show cave, and this stretch contains most of the more spectacular formations.

Made of Carboniferous Limestone, it is a continuation of the Mendip Hills. Two further continuations are the small islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm. The cliffs on the northern and southern flanks of Brean Down have large quantities of fossils laid down in the marine deposits about 320–350 million years ago. The site has been occupied by humans since the late Bronze Age and includes the remains of a Romano-Celtic Temple. At the seaward end is Brean Down Fort which was built in 1865 and then re-armed in the Second World War. Brean Down is now owned by the National Trust, and is rich in wildlife, history and archaeology. It is a Site of Special Scientific Interest due to both the geology and presence of nationally rare plants including the white rock-rose. It has also been scheduled as an ancient monument.\n| uid = 1008211\n| show_img = yes\n| image = Brean Down.jpg\n| upload_desc =\n| show_ref = yes\n| reference =\n| commonscat = Brean Down Fort\n| show_wikidata= no\n| wikidata = Q3403788\n}}\n| show_architect = no\n| architect =\n| show_listed = no\n| date_listed = 4 September 1991\n| grid_ref = ST 39680 55004\n| lat = 51.2910\n| lon = -2.8664\n| show_notes =yes\n| notes = A small cave from which a large number of Middle Palaeolithic artefacts, and two Neanderthal teeth dated to about 55,000 years BP, have been recovered.\n| uid = 1010715\n| show_img = yes\n| image =\n| upload_desc =\n| show_ref = yes\n| reference =\n| commonscat =\n| show_wikidata= no\n| wikidata =\n}}\n| show_architect = no\n| architect =\n| show_listed = no\n| date_listed =\n| grid_ref = ST181363\n| lat = 51.1197\n| lon = -3.17\n| show_notes =yes\n| notes = Plainsfield Camp (or Park Plantation or Cockercombe Castle) is a possible Iron Age earthwork on the Quantock Hills, but may have been an animal enclosure.\n| uid = 1007669\n| show_img = yes\n| image = Plainsfield Camp.jpg\n| upload_desc =\n| show_ref = yes\n| reference =\n| commonscat =\n| show_wikidata= no\n| wikidata = Q7200749\n}}\n| show_architect = no\n| architect =\n| show_listed = no\n| date_listed = 26 November 2013\n| grid_ref = ST1548538136\n| lat = 51.1362\n| lon = -3.2093\n| show_notes =yes\n| notes = A platform cairn on the Quantock Hills.\n| uid = 1417363\n| show_img = yes\n| image =\n| upload_desc =\n| show_ref = yes\n| reference =\n| commonscat =\n| show_wikidata= no\n| wikidata =\n}}\n| show_architect = no\n| architect =\n| show_listed = no\n| date_listed = 28 June 1996\n| grid_ref = ST 35497 37162\n| lat = 51.1300\n| lon = -2.9232\n| show_notes =yes\n| notes = The remains of several prehistoric trackways in the peaty soil of the Somerset Levels.\n| uid = 1014430\n| show_img = yes\n| image =\n| upload_desc =\n| show_ref = yes\n| reference =\n| commonscat =\n| show_wikidata= no\n| wikidata =\n}}\n| show_architect = no\n| architect =\n| show_listed = no\n| date_listed =\n| grid_ref = ST 39461 44433\n| lat = 51.1959\n| lon = -2.8678\n| show_notes =yes\n| notes = The remains of salt mounds used in Roman times.
