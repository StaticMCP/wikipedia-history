He then entered private practice in New York City until 1941, when he began a series of government positions. He was an attorney in the U.S. Department of Justice, first for the Board of Immigration Appeals in 1941, and then for the Alien Enemy Control Unit in 1942. From 1942 to 1943, he was a law clerk to Justice Stanley F.

He returned to the Department of Justice as a trial attorney in the Office of Alien Property from 1945 to 1957, and in the Antitrust Division from 1957 to 1958. He then served as general counsel of the Development and Resources Corporation from 1958 to 1959, and as a partner in the Manhattan law firm of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan from 1960 to 1968.\nIn 1968, Schwartz became a trial judge of the U.S. Court of Claims. On October 1, 1982, he was appointed by operation of the Federal Courts Improvement Act, 96 Stat. 27, to a new seat on the United States Court of Federal Claims.
