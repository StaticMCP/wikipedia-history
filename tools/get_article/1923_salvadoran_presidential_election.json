The election was between Vice President Alfonso Quiñónez Molina and Miguel Tomás Molina, a former government minister and Quiñónez's cousin. On 25 December 1922, Salvadoran security forces massacred Molina's supporters at a political rally in San Salvador. Molina subsequently fled the country and called on his supporters to boycott the election, but Quiñónez won the election unanimously with 178,000 votes.\nResults\n}}\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n* }}"
