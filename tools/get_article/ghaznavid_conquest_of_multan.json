Jami al-Tawarikh (The Assembly of Histories)\n}}\nThe Ghaznavid Empire under Mahmud of Ghazni () carried out multiple military expeditions against the Fatimid backed Ismaili}} Sh'ia Lodi dyansty of Multan. In 1006 AD, Mahmud besieged Abu'l Fateh Daud, who had adopted Qaramatian heretical beliefs. Ghaznavids consolidated their authority over Multan but soon faced revolt in 1008. Final campaign was taken 1010 AD which abolished the Emirate of Multan.\nBackground\nSince the conquest of Sindh and Multan}} by Muhammad bin Qasim in 712-14, Multan served as the output of Islam in India. The region remained part of the Caliphates from 712 AD until 870 AD. By the end of ninth century Multan became independent from the Abbasid Caliphate although continued reading khutbah in name of Abbasids. In the 10th century, Ismaili Fatimid emissaries arrived in Multan. Local rulers, with military support from Cairo, captured Multan in 977, established the Ismaili doctrine as the official religion, and khutbah was read in the name of the Fatimid Caliph rather than the Abbasid Caliphs. Later in 983-4, the Fatimid Caliph Al-Aziz () dispatched Julam bin Shayban to Sindh. Julam captured Multan and closed the Umayyad mosque. His rule made alliance with Hindu Shahis against the Sunni Ghaznavids who supported the Abbasid Caliphate. After Julam's death in 986/990, Shaikh Hamid Lodi united with Shahis to oppose Sabuktigin () at Laghman. Daud Lodi, grandson of Shaikh Hamid Lodi, made friendly relation with Sabuktigin and following his death, with Mahmud. During the reign of Anandapal, the Hindu Shahis and Emirate of Multan renewed their alliance. Daud's adoption of Qaramatian beliefs ensued conflict with Mahmud who resolved taking campaigns against Daud.\nWars\nSiege of Multan\nIn 1005 after returning from the conquest of Bhatiya, Daud blocked the passage of Ghaznavid army while crossing the province of Multan. Mahmud with the intention of punishing Daud for his disobedience, marched against Multan to subjugate him. In early 1006, he crossed Peshawar. Mahmud asked Anandapal, the Hindu Shahi ruler of Lahore to allow him to pass through his territory. Anandapal refused the orders, instructed his chiefs to move to Indus River to block Mahmud's passage. Mahmud turned his attention to the Hindu Shahis, defeated Anandapal in battle and forced him to abandon his capital. He then marched to Multan through Punjab. Daud fled to an island in the Indus River. After a seven day siege, the civilians offered submission and paid 20,000,000 dirhams. The offer was accepted. The inhabitants were spared except the Qaramatians. Duad was allowed to rule Multan on the promise to pay annual tribute of 20,000 dinars and follow the principles of Sunni Islam. Mahmud intended to bring the entire region under his authority. In the meantime, Kara-Khanid Khanate under Ilig Nasr Khan invaded Khorasan. Mahmud left Multan assigning Sukhapala, grandson of Jayapala, who had been taken prisoner and embraced Islam with the name Nawasa Shah.\nSukhapala's governorship and revolt\nSukhapala, taking advantage of the war between Ilig Nasr Khan and Mahmud, abjured Islam and revolted in December 1007. Daud also began to collaborate with him. The news of revolt reached Mahmud in January 1008 AD. Mahmud after gaining victory at Battle of Balkh (1008), against Kara-Khanid Khanate decided to march against Sukhapala. Sukhapala being defeated, sought refuge to Anandapal but was soon was captured by the frontier amirs. He was brought to the royal camp, deprived of his personal treasure of 400,000 dirhams and imprisoned.\nAnnexation of Multan\nDaud reverted back to the heretic Qaramatian practices and tried to assert independence. In 1010 AD, Mahmud renewed his expedition and marched towards Multan to subdue the remaining parts of the region. Daud was defeated and taken prisoner. He was sent to the fort of Ghurak. Subsequently thousands of Qaramatians were either executed or enslaved. Mahmud appointing a new governor annexed the kingdom. The Ismaili leaders had left Multan and took refuge in Mansura, Uch, Ar-rur, Bhakkar and founded a new state with the aid of local Ismaili chiefs. The kingdom lasted until its annexation shortly after the Somnath expedition.\nAftermath\nMahmud restored the Umayyad mosque of Muhammad al-Qasim that had been previously shut down by the Ismailis in 833-4 while leaving the Ismaili mosque built by Julam to decay He also built a fort and two mosques in Lahore in 1022 and 1026. The Ismailis of Upper Sindh recovered after Mahmud's attack. Following Mahmud's death, Daud's son and Ismaili leaders instigated by Syrian Druze leader Muqtana seized Multan. Another attempt was made to re-establish their authority in Multan but was suppressed by Muhammad of Ghor () in 1175.\nSee also\n* Ghaznavid–Samanid war\n* Siege of Bhatiya\n* Battle of the Indus (1027)\n* Ghaznavid conquest in Khwarazm\n* Ghaznavid invasion of Kannauj\n* Ghaznavid–Saffarid war\n* Battle of Chach\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
