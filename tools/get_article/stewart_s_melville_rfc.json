The team competes in Scottish National League Division Two, the third tier of Scottish club rugby. Home matches are played at Inverleith; this was the venue for Scotland's home games between 1899 and 1925, during which time the first matches against France and New Zealand were played.\nHistory\nThe club took on its present form following the merger of Stewart's College FP and Melville College FP in 1973 when the club became known as '''Stewart's Melville FP RFC'''.\nAs the name suggests, many of the players in the club's history were former pupils of the Stewart's Melville College (formed in a merger of Daniel Stewart's College and Melville College) in Edinburgh. This remains the case today, although the club is now 'open' and welcomes players who did not attend the school.\nThe 1st XV were coached by Grant MacKenzie, a P.E. teacher who worked at the school, and who died in 2008.\nIn June 2014 the club resolved at an AGM to shorten the name to Stewart's Melville RFC.\nThe club currently run two XVs on a regular basis. The 1st and 2nd XVs both play in competitive leagues with the 2nd XV currently playing in East Region Reserve League Division 1.\nClub Honours\n* Melrose Sevens\n** Champions (1): 1979\n* Langholm Sevens\n** Champions (2): 1979, 1983\n* Hawick Sevens\n** Champions (2): 1980, 1992\n* Gala Sevens\n** Champions (2): 1976, 1980\n*Kelso Sevens\n** Champions (1): 1978, 1979\n* Jed-Forest Sevens\n** Champions (1): 1980\n* Selkirk Sevens\n** Champions (2): 1976, 1977\n*Middlesex Sevens\n** Champions (1): 1982\n* Edinburgh Northern Sevens\n** Champions (1): 2003, 2006\nRecent Internationals\n*Richie Vernon\n*Ross Rennie\n*Graham Shiel\n*Graeme Burns\n*Dougie Morgan\n*Alex Brewster\n*Jim Calder\n*Finlay Calder\n*Douglas Wyllie\n*Ian Forsyth\n*A.J.W.
