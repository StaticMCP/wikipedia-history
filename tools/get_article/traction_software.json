It is the creator of  Traction TeamPage software for action tracking and collaboration. Traction Software products are used as project management software, quality management software, knowledge management software, competitive intelligence software, as well as other collaborative software applications.\nHistory\nThe company was founded in 1996 by Chris Nuzum and Gregory Lloyd who were heavily influenced by the work of Douglas Engelbart's On-Line System (the first hypertext journaling system) and other hypertext pioneers including Andy van Dam's HES and Ted Nelson's Xanadu.\nThe company was first to the Enterprise 2.0 software market with releases dating back to 1999 and a commercial market launch in 2002 when Traction TeamPage Version 2.8 was the first platform to be called an Enterprise Weblog in a review by Jon Udell of InfoWorld.\nIn 2003, the US Department of Defense CIO office funded a Rapid Acquisition Incentive-Net Centricity (RAI-NC) pilot program, titled the \"Liberty Project,\" to study the business case for using social software for net-centric project communication and information management. The study involved funding to add the WebDAV extension to the Traction platform and to support the following Liberty Project participants: Traction Software, The Office of Naval Research, the Army Night Vision Lab, Defense Acquisition University, Naval Underwater Warfare Center, Marine Corps, Ford Motor Company, and the New York City Police.\nTraction Software was named to KMWorld’s 100 Companies that Matter in Knowledge Management for nine consecutive years through 2013.\nIn the Competitive Intelligence market, Traction TeamPage was included in Fuld & Company Intelligence Software Report in 2008/2009, 2006/2007, and 2004/2005.\nFunding\nThe company was initially funded by In-Q-Tel (the venture arm of the US Central Intelligence Agency) in May 2000. In-Q-Tel followed through in June 2002 with a customer agreement that represents the first significant enterprise site license of a blogging platform.\nTraction Software raised a second round in 2002 with participation from In-Q-Tel, the Slater Fund, and private investors.\nProducts\nTraction Software's primary product is Traction TeamPage.
