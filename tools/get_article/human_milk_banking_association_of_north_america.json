The organization was founded in 1985. As of 2022, it has thirty-one member milk banks, including twenty-eight in the US and three in Canada. HMBANA is accredited by the US FDA, and is funded by membership dues and donations.\nOperations\nHMBANA member banks provide donor milk to NICUs on a cost-recovery basis. In 2021, member banks distributed  of breast milk, a 22% increase over the prior year. During the 2022 United States infant formula shortage, HMBANA saw a twenty percent increase in requests for donor milk, and increased donor applications.\nHMBANA member banks screen potential donors for communicable diseases, medications, and illicit drug use. Donated milk is pooled to ensure consistency, pasteurized at  for 30 minutes, and  tested for bacterial pathogens both before and after pasteurization. The milk is stored frozen until delivery. Donated milk is prioritized for \"medically fragile\" babies, and may be prescribed for preterm infants, or those with malabsorption, feeding intolerance, immune deficiency, or who have undergone gastrointestinal surgery. When donor milk is available for healthy infants, up to  may be purchased without a prescription, at a typical cost of $3 to $5 an ounce. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against sharing breastmilk outside of accredited milk banks.\nHMBANA-authored publications include 2018 Guidelines for the Establishment and Operation of a Donor Human Milk Bank; 2019 Fourth Edition of Best Practice for Expressing, Storing and Handling Human Milk in Hospitals, Homes, and Child Care Settings; and Lactation Support for the Bereaved Mother.\nHMBANA is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, but is incorporated in Connecticut.\n}}"
