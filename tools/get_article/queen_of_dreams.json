The track first appeared on the 1972 Grave New World album.\nMusical content\nThe track has a psychedelic quality, due to the first two verses, where acoustic guitar chords were played in reverse order then tape-reversed to provide instrumental backing. The middle section features a solo on a dulcimer played through a fuzzbox, similar to the solo on another Grave New World Track \"Benedictus\". There follows a short section of special effects which then leads into a third verse, this time with a backing of conventional acoustic guitars. The song continues with a middle 8 section and an instrumental closing section, leading to a drum solo which fades out.\nPersonnel\n*Dave Cousins – vocals, acoustic guitar, electric dulcimer\n*Tony Hooper – backing vocals, acoustic guitar\n*Blue Weaver – Hammond organ, Mellotron, piano\n*John Ford – bass guitar\n*Richard Hudson – drums\nExternal links\n* [http://www.strawbsweb.co.uk/lyrics/alphres.asp#queenofdreams Lyrics to \"Queen of Dreams\" at Strawbsweb official site]\nReferences\n*[http://www.strawbsweb.co.uk/albtrack/gnw/gnw30.asp Grave New World 30th anniversary article on Strawbsweb]\n*Sleeve notes to album CD 540 934-2 Grave New World (A&M 1998 Remastered)"
