They are designed to function using compressed air to power their engines if they are passing through pools of burning oil or oxygen-poor environments—carrying enough compressed air to function for 50 minutes. Every evacuee is issued a rebreather for passing through anoxic environments if the airtight evacuation capsules are compromised. The vessels are insulated so passengers and crew can survive transiting through pools of burning oil. Since the Caspian freezes during winter, the vessels are designed to break up to 0.6 metres (2.0 ft) of ice.\nThe vessels were designed by AKAC Inc. and Robert Allan Limited, a firm of Canadian naval architects.\nInitially, in 2005, Remontowa built four vessels.\nBy 2012 the fleet contained ten vessels.\nThere is provision to carry ten stretcher-bound, wounded evacuees, while the remaining 328 evacuees are seated in one of three evacuation capsules.\nOnly two crewmembers are required to operate the vessels.\nReferences"
