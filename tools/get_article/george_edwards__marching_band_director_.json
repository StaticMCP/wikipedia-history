Edwards (November 5, 1948 – May 28, 2009) was the director of bands for Prairie View A&M University.\nEarly life and education\nEdwards was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on November 5, 1948, to George and Beulah Edwards. He was baptized at Second Missionary Baptist church by Rev Paul A. McDaniels and served faithfully until leaving to attend Florida A&M University, (FAMU) Tallahassee, Florida. He earned his Bachelor of Arts in Music (1970) and he joined Kappa Kappa Psi band fraternity (1969), and Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, Beta Nu chapter. While at FAMU, he played as part of famed Marching 100, performing under the pioneering and legendary Dr. William P. Foster, where he received a number of distinctive awards and opportunities; some of which were his selection as Student Arranger, the Outstanding Senior Award, and having his arrangements played by the Marching 100 at Super Bowl III.\nIn the mid-1970s, he directed the jazz band at Kirkman Technical High School in his hometown of Chattanooga, where he frequently arranged popular pieces for his students. Mr. Edwards later received a master's in music education from Michigan State University (1976). At Michigan, many of his marching band arrangements were performed and recorded by the Michigan State University Spartan Marching Band. From 1975 to 1978 he traveled with Lansing Community College Suitcase Theater as Musical Director, touring the Netherlands, Germany, Wales, Scotland, Denmark, Belgium, and Japan. On January 1, 2009, George Edwards led the \"Storm\" in the 120th Tournament of Roses Association Rose Parade in Pasadena, CA where they were the first Black College Band to perform in the Rose Bowl's Parade pilot program to include bands from historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in the parade each year.\nPrairie View A&M University\nIn 1978, Prof. Edwards came to Prairie View A&M University (PVAMU) as Assistant Director of Bands and served in capacity of music arranger. In 1984, Edwards rose to the position of Head Director of the Prairie View A&M University Marching Band and Jazz Band. Professor Edwards took the struggling marching band of 25 and helped them become a world-renowned, first-class composition of musical athletes. Under his leadership, in 1991 the band rebranded as “The Marching Storm\" due in part to a slew of challenging or canceled performances due to weather. His technique and passion for the art of marching band was characterized by his quest for perfection, and the motto that the band came to live by was: “Make It Happen!”\nThrough Professor Edwards' direction, the Marching Storm became the first marching band to debut its drumline solely during the \"drum feature\", known as the PV McFunk BOX (The BOX, for short), in a show-style halftime event at the football games. Edwards incorporated few of the FAMU concepts of innovative formations and fast-stepping, while adding unique framing, drum routines, and their majorettes (the Black Foxes), to create a half-time show that provided the \"Marching Storm\" with national recognition and their pick of the best of the best high school band members from across the nation.\nFor 30 years Professor Edwards collaborated with friend and associate, Dr. Margaret Sherrod on music arranged especially for the jazz and precision high kick choreography of the “Black Foxes” majorette line that he always urged to live up to their reputation as a “Class Act.” Skyrocketing to national acclaim, the Storm performed, appeared, or were featured as part of the following activities:\n* 2001: Performed in President George W.

He was 60 years old.\nLegacy\nProfessor Edwards was an innovator who was dedicated, committed, and passionate about music and its performance. Professor Edwards spoke in a language that only band members understood; with words like:\n“Chop chop Chief”\n\"Chatter, chatter!\"\n“What’s up Chief”\n“Drop down and give me twenty”\n“I know you don’t have a doo rag on your head”\n“Get on the Bus”\n“In the Hole Band…last time”\n“Chief, pull your pants up”\n“Do you see this knucklehead”\nHe was demanding of his band members to ensure they achieved their maximum potential as performers, students, and as people; was a surrogate parent to many of his students; and will remain in history as one of the top college band directors.\nProf. Edwards spawned numerous band directors from his lineage of marching band leadership and style.\nReferences\n*[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/08/arts/music/08band.html Ratliff, Ben. \"Where the Game Is Just a Warm-Up for the Band.\" The New York Times Sep. 8, 2007]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090925073920/http://www.pvamu.edu/pages/4514.asp Prairie View A&M University Marching Storm]\n*[http://www.blackvibes.com/features/news/prairie-view-band-director-dies-after-tragic-car-accident/ Posey, John. \"Prairie View Band Director Dies After Tragic Car Accident.\" Blackvibes.com Jun. 5, 2009]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090601071804/http://www.tspnsports.com/2009/05/29/pvamus-marching-storm-director-passes.htm Fiyah. \"PVAMU’s Marching Storm Director “George Edwards” Passes.\" TSPNSports.com May 29, 2009]\n*[https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/prairie-view-a-m-mourns-beloved-band-leader-prof-1748959.php Kever,Jeannie. \"Prairie View A&M mourns beloved band leader 'Prof'.
