It is located in Newton, in Sussex County, New Jersey, United States, and pursues a mission of promoting public knowledge and interest in the county's heritage.\nHill Memorial Museum\nHill Memorial Museum at 82 Main Street in Newton, was constructed for the historical society in 1916 and has served as its home since then. It was built in the renaissance revival style to the design of Henry T. Stephens, an architect from Paterson, New Jersey by local contractor Thomas Farrel. It was dedicated on June 8, 1917, and named after three relatives of the main donor, Joshua Hill. It is the oldest building continuously operated as a museum in the State of New Jersey.  The Hill Memorial was placed on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and National Register of Historic Places on July 18, 1985, for its significance in architecture, education, and social history.\nThe entry hall has a grand staircase made of quartered oak. The exterior walls are constructed in brick in two shades made by the N.H. Sloan kilns of Pennsylvania. Ornaments for the entrance were manufactured by the Brick Terra Cotta & Tile Company of Corning, New York. A 1922 fireplace on the ground floor was made by George Sharp with stones of local geological and historic significance.\nThe second floor houses collections of quilts and other textiles, farming tools, baskets and other household items, Civil War memorabilia, and a partial skeleton of a Mastodon discovered nearby.\nSee also\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Sussex County, New Jersey\n* List of historical societies in New Jersey\n* List of museums in New Jersey\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.sussexcountyhistory.org Sussex County Historical Society] (website)"
