The ceremony was hosted by Garry Shandling and was broadcast on ABC. Networks Bravo and The WB received their first major nominations; this remains the only year in which a series from the latter or its descendants (The CW and UPN) received a major nomination. The nominations were announced on July 20, 2000.\nFor its second season, Will & Grace led all comedy series with three major wins, including Outstanding Comedy Series; Ally McBeal became the first defending champion, that wasn't canceled or ended, that failed to be nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series since Get Smart in 1970.\nThe drama field was dominated by first year series The West Wing. In addition to winning Outstanding Drama Series, the series won five major awards total, leading all series. Overall, when adding The West Wings technical categories, it won nine awards in a single year, a record that stood until Game of Thrones received twelve awards for its fifth season in 2015. In addition, James Gandolfini became the first actor from an HBO series to win Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for The Sopranos; Gandolfini would win twice more over the next three years.\nWinners and nominees\nWinners are listed first, highlighted in boldface, and indicated with a double dagger (‡).
