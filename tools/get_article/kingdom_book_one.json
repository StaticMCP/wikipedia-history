Kingdom Book One isn't a sanitised album. But it doesn't have to be. Maverick City Music's goal is to win souls for Jesus- and I think they might have done that with this release. A stellar album and a project that will be timeless, Kirk needs to be congratulated, as do everyone else involved.\" Reviewing for Others Magazine, Jared Proellocks wrote: \"This is not necessarily an album of songs to be replicated in a congregational worship setting but a vulnerable declaration of praise and love to God.\"\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Awards\n|-\n!
