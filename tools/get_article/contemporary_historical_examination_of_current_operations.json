The series produced over 200 reports – many have been declassified in the early 1990s.\nHistory\nProject CHECO was an Air Force effort to document aerial operations in Southeast Asia, with emphasis on new forces, tactics and techniques, materials, and methods. The project was established by the Air Staff in June 1962, at the request of Lieutenant General Thomas S. Moorman, the vice commander of Pacific Air Forces. It was under the command of Headquarters Pacific Forces and the 2nd Air Division; which was redesignated 7th Air Force in April 1966. Over the course of 15 years, over 250 reports were established on topics that included command arrangements, training, air base defense, special operations, conventional air operations, and many others.\nList of reports\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Reports\n!Number of Reports\n!Pages\n!Title\n!Date\n|-\n|\n| 230\n| The War in Vietnam 1966\n| 23 October 1967\n|-\n| 179\n| 97\n|Attack on Cam Ranh\n| 25 August 1971\n|-\n|\n| 157\n| Khe Sanh (Operation: Niagara)\n| 22 January - 31 March 1968\n|-\n|\n| 183\n| Igloo White\n| January 1970 - September 1971\n|-\n| 196\n| 129\n| Base Defense in Thailand\n| 18 February 1973\n|-\n|\n| 74\n| Tactical Data Systems Interface (U)\n| 1 January 1975\n|-\n| 204\n| 62\n| Guided Bomb Operations in Southeast Asia: The Weather Dimension\n| 1 February - 31 December 1972\n|-\n|\n| 62\n| Linebacker Operations\n| 31 December 1978\n|-\n|\n| 224\n| The Royal Thai Air Force\n| 3 December 1971\n|}\nList of USAF Search and Rescue reports\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Reports\n!Pages\n!Title\n!Date\n|-\n| 91\n| Evasion and Escape, SEA\n| 1964 - 1971\n|-\n| 118\n| USAF Search and Rescue in Southeast Asia\n| 1961 - 24 Oct 1966\n|-\n| 53\n| USAF Search and Rescue\n| July 1966 - November 1967\n|-\n| 101\n| The USAF Helicopter in Sea\n| 4 December 1968\n|-\n| 117\n| USAF Search and Rescue\n| November 1967 - June 1969\n|-\n| 167\n| USAF Search & Rescue in Southeast Asia\n| 1 July 1969 - 30 December 1970\n|-\n| 88\n| Search and Rescue Operations in SEA\n| 1 April 1972 - 30 June 1973\n|}\nNotes\nReferences\n*"
