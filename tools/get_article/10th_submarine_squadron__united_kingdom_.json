The four Resolution-class submarines would carry out a total of 229 operational patrols during their time in service with the squadron.\nThe squadron would later direct the Vanguard-class submarines equipped with Trident missiles.\nIn October 1993 the 3rd and 10th Squadrons at Faslane amalgamated into a new 1st Submarine Squadron (Watson).\nIn February 2002 all existing squadrons were disbanded and replaced by three flotillas at the base ports of Devonport, Faslane and Portsmouth.\nSubmarines\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
