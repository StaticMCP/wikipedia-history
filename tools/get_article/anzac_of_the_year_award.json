Members of the public may submit nominations to a Selection Panel, which makes the final choice of recipient. The Selection Panel comprises three New Zealanders from the defence forces and the RSA, and the incumbent Governor-General.\nThe Award statuette\nThe bronze statuette was designed by Captain Matt Gauldie of the New Zealand Army. It depicts two soldiers with a donkey, and represents the story of New Zealander Private Richard Henderson. During the battle for Gallipoli, the 19-year old Henderson was a stretcher bearer. He used a donkey to convey wounded soldiers from the battlefields to medical stations, at considerable personal risk.\nThe base of the statuette shows the Maori hammerhead shark motif, signifying Tumatauenga, the God of War.\nRecipients\n2016\nBarbara Cunningham of Mataura, Southland, received the 2016 Award for her work establishing a community garden to help people who could not afford to buy vegetables. The community garden also took over the town's Meals on Wheels service for elderly people and extended the service to any needy people in the town, providing fresh, locally made meals.\n2015\nLouise Nicholas, rape survivor and advocate for victims' rights, received the 2015 Award. She had been nominated by the Katherine Mansfield Birthplace Association for her courage in demanding accountability over her allegations of rape by New Zealand Police officers despite significant opposition and scrutiny.\n2014\nBanapa Avatea was the recipient of the 2014 Award. Avatea prevented a potentially fatal accident on State Highway 1 between Auckland and Hamilton; he noticed a truck was being driven erratically and followed it, eventually gaining an opportunity to board the vehicle and bring it under control. The driver had passed out at the wheel. The award was presented by the Governor General Sir Jerry Mateparae at a ceremony at Government House, Wellington.\n2013\n12-year old cousins Will White and Sergio Schuler received the 2013 Award for their bravery in rescuing a swimmer caught in a rip at a beach in Waihi. The boys used their surf lifesaver training to call for help, then swim out to support the swimmer, bring him back to the shore and stay with him until emergency services arrived. The Governor-General Sir Jerry Mateparae presented the award at a ceremony at the Waihi Beach Memorial RSA.\n2012\nteam clearing liquefaction in Christchurch]]\nThe Student Volunteer Army received the 2012 Award in recognition of its contribution to the recovery of Christchurch following the devastating 2010 and 2011 Christchurch earthquake.

Governor-General Sir Anand Satyanand presented the award at a ceremony at Government House, Wellington.\n2010\nLieutenant Colonel John Masters was the inaugural recipient of the Award. Masters had served in the New Zealand Army for 27 years, seeing active service in Malaysia, Borneo and Vietnam, and he had also received the Military Cross for bravery in rescuing a Ghurka soldier. On his return to New Zealand, Masters became an advocate for veterans, including playing a key role in demonstrating the impact of Agent Orange on New Zealand soldiers.\nPrime Minister John Key presented the award to Masters' wife Alisoun and son Allan as Masters was not able to travel due to ill health. Chief of Defence Jerry Mateparae later presented the award personally to Masters in Christchurch.\nReferences"
