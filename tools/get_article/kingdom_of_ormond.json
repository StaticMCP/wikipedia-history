It existed in the 12th century, comprising the eastern part of Munster, in what is now County Tipperary, as well as adjoining parts of Leinster (western County Kilkenny and northern County Waterford).\nOrmond was formed from a partition of the preceding Kingdom of Munster. It was a fief of the O'Kennedy family and later invaded by the Anglo-Normans, who created the Earldom of Ormond as part of the Lordship of Ireland, under the suzerainty of the Butler family. However, the O'Kennedys, now styled \"Lords of Ormond\", long struggled with the Butlers for control of the region. Ormond later included a part of the former Kingdom of Ossory (which had comprised all of the future County Kilkenny, along with western Laois and parts of eastern Tipperary)\nIn 1336, a peace treaty was signed between the two families, but in 1347 the O'Kennedys were able to drive out the Butlers from Nenagh Castle and install there, keeping the manor for more than two hundred years.\nTwo modern Irish baronies, Ormond Upper and Ormond Lower, are named after the kingdom.\nKings of Ormond\n* Olaf Húa Ua Cennétig (...-1164)\n* Domnall Húa Ua Cennétig (...-1181)\n* Brian Ua Cennétig\n* Tomás Ua Cennétig, half-king of Ormond\nReferences"
