The label was founded and financed by Guggenheim heiress Diane Hamilton (the pseudonym of Diane Guggenheim) in 1956. Its president and director was Patrick \"Paddy\" Clancy, who was soon to join his brothers Liam and Tom Clancy and Tommy Makem, as part of the new Irish folk group, The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem. Liam Clancy designed the company's maple leaf logo. Columbia University Professor of Folklore Kenneth Goldstein was also involved in the early creation of the company, which operated out of Greenwich Village, New York, United States.\nWith artists like The Clancy Brothers, Odetta, and Jean Ritchie growing in popularity during the American folk music revival, the label began to generate good profits. When The Clancy Brothers signed with Columbia Records in 1961, Paddy Clancy ceased to run the day-to-day operations of the company. In 1966, The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, as owners of the label, sold the Tradition catalogue to Everest Records. Everest reissued Tradition recordings without any notes in haphazard permutations. Much of the Tradition catalogue has been reissued on CD and/or for digital download. For many years John Jacob Niles received little acclaim, but following the broadcast of the Bob Dylan documentary No Direction Home, there was a surge in the demand for his albums. His two albums on Tradition were reissued.\n43 North Broadway, a private IP management fund, acquired the exclusive worldwide rights to the Tradition Records catalog, as part of its acquisition of the Everest Records Group of labels.\nPartial discography\nTLP series\n*TLP 501: Siobhán McKenna, John Neville, Tom Clancy: The Countess Cathleen\n*TLP 1001: Isla Cameron: Through Bushes And Briars (Songs From The British Isles) (1956)\n*TLP 1002: Hillel and Aviva: Songs Of Israel and Many Lands (1956)\n*TLP 1003: Ed McCurdy: ''A Ballad Singer's Choice'' (1956)\n*TLP 1004: Liam Clancy, Tommy Makem, Sarah Makem, Paddy Tunney, Padraig O'Keeffe: The Lark in the Morning (1956)\n*TLP 1005: Paul Clayton: Whaling and Sailing Songs from the Days of Moby Dick (1956)\n*TLP 1006: The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem: The Rising of the Moon: Irish Songs of Rebellion (1956)\n*TLP 1007: Various artists: Instrumental Music of the Southern Appalachians  1976\n*TLP 1008: El Nino De Ronda: The Real Flamenco  1969\n*TLP 1009: John Langstaff: Sings American and English Folk Songs and Ballads\n*TLP 1010: Odetta: Odetta Sings Ballads and Blues    1957\n*TLP 1011: Jean Ritchie & Paul Clayton: American Folk Tales and Songs 1956\n*TLP 1012: Norman Notley and David Brynley: Elizabethan Songs (1956)\n*TLP 1013: Seamus Ennis: The Bonny Bunch of Roses (1956)\n*TLP 1014: Oscar Brand: Laughing America (1956)\n*TLP 1015: Ewan MacColl and Peggy Seeger: Classic Scots Ballads (1956)\n*TLP 1016: A.
