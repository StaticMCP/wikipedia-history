Released in June 1979, it was the final Parlet album to feature Mallia Franklin and the first to feature Janice Evans. The album was produced by George Clinton and Ron Dunbar. The title is a play on Invasion of the Body Snatchers, replacing \"Body\" with \"Booty\". The cover art was created by Ronald \"Stozo\" Edwards. The album's highest-charting single was \"Riding High\". The album leaned more toward disco, in an effort to keep up with musical trends.\nInvasion of the Booty Snatchers was re-released in Japan on the Casablanca/Polystar label in 1992 and in Germany on Universal in 2003. On July 30, 2013, Real Gone Music in the U.S. reissued both Pleasure Principle and Invasion of the Booty Snatchers, featuring liner notes by former P-Funk minister of information Tom Vickers.\nTrack listing\n# \"Riding High\" (Ron Dunbar, Donny Sterling) – released as 7-inch single Casablanca NB 975 and 12-inch single Casablanca NBD 20161 DJ 7:40\n# \"No Rump to Bump\" (Donny Sterling, Ron Dunbar, Jim Vitti, George Clinton) 6:10\n# \"Don't Ever Stop (Lovin' Me, Needin' Me)\" (Glenn Goins, Ron Dunbar, George Clinton) – released as single Casablanca NB 995 7:13\n# \"Booty Snatchers\" (Ron Dunbar, George Clinton, Phillipina Bishop) 5:50\n# \"You're Leaving\" (Gary Cooper, George Clinton, Ron Dunbar) 6:26\n# \"Huff-N-Puff\" (Ron Dunbar, Michael Hampton) 7:17\nPersonnel\n* Guitars: Gordon Carlton, Jerome Ali, Phelps Collins, Bootsy Collins, Michael Hampton, Kevin D.
