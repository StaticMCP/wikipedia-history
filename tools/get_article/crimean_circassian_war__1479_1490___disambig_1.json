They outnumbered the Kabardians and captured the fortresses of Kopa and Anapa, where many Turkish garrisons were left. Some Circassians were captured and sold into slavery meanwhile others kept on fighting.\nAt the very beginning of the 1490s, the Crimean Khan Mengli Gerai undertook a campaign against the Circassians. This was the first campaign of the Crimean khans in a series of numerous campaigns against the tribes of the Circassians, Circassians and Kabardians in order to conquer and subdue them.\nReferences"
