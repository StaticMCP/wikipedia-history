In the , the locality of Burnett Heads had a population of 2,908 people.\nGeography\nThe locality of Burnett Heads is on the southern side of the Burnett River at its mouth into the Coral Sea.The river forms the western and northern boundaries, while the ocean forms most of the eastern boundary.\nThe land use is a mixture of residential (mostly with proximity to the coast), industrial (mostly the Port of Bundaberg) and some agricultural use (growing sugarcane). There is a network of cane tramways to transport the harvested sugarcane to the Millaquin sugar mill for processing.\nHistory\nThe Barolin run was leased by Alfred Henry Brown from 1862. This was on a coastal strip of the Barolin Plain which stretched from the southern side of the Burnett River to the northern side of the Elliott River.\nBurnett Heads Provisional School opened on 3 April 1878. On 17 September 1888, it became Burnett Heads State School.\nNew Bundaberg is now Port Bundaberg and the Barolin Marine Township Estate is the current Burnett Heads township. Both townships are part of the current Burnett Heads locality.\nIn February 1883, land surveyed by Charlton and Gardiner, licensed surveyors, in the township of New Bundaberg was offered for sale in the Victoria Hall, Bundaberg. The locality map advertising the sale also shows land in the Barolin Marine Township Estate to be offered for sale on the same day. The same map shows the Lighthouse, Pilot Station and Public Telegraph Office at South Head.\nThe Maryborough Chronicle later reported that the New Bundaberg town allotments sold well, recording the buyers and prices paid while the Barolin estate did not sell so well on the day. The auction was conducted three auctioneers: Bryant and Co., John Cameron and W. E. Curtis. .\nIn 1883, the Maryborough Barolin Syndicate proposed to build a private tramline and railway station from New Bundaberg  to connect with the terminus of the Bundaberg and Burrum railway. In 1884 the New Bundaberg Land, Building, and Investment Co., Limited acquired the rights to the land reserved for that purpose. The tramline did not eventuate.\nIn 1917, New Bundaberg was described as a mosquito Infested swamp.\nMethodist services were held at the Burnett Heads State School, until the Burnett Heads Methodist Church was opened on Thursday 6 August 1903. It was on the eastern side of Burnett Heads Road halfway down the school hill. In 1967, it was relocated to its present site in Zunker Street. In 1977, the Methodist Church entered into an amalgamation to create the Uniting Church in Australia; the church then became known as Burnett Heads Uniting Church.\nBurnett Heads Post Office opened by 1919 (a receiving office had been open from 1888), closed in 1924 and reopened around 1942.\nOn Sunday 3 May 1931, Archbishop James Duhig consecrated a new Roman Catholic Church in Burnett Heads. It was entirely funded by the Zunker family in memory of their dead parents. Over 1000 people attended the ceremony. It was closed and sold in 1991 and has been demolished. It was at 33 Zunker Street ().\nArchbishop William Wand laid the foundation stone for St John the Divine Anglican Church on Sunday 6 August 1939. The land for the church had been donated by Christian Mittleheuser. The church was consecrated on Sunday 4 February 1940 by Bishop Dixon.\nIn 1958, the Port of Bundaberg was established at Burnett Heads to better support the sugar industry and the larger ships being employed.
