Katarzyna Person is the Deputy Director for Research and Exhibition Programming, and Joanna Dudelewicz is the Deputy Director for Investment, Economic and Organisational Affairs.\nThe mission of the institution is to disseminate knowledge about the everyday life, survival strategies, fight and extermination of Polish Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto and other ghettos on territory of the occupied Poland.\nThe museum's team is working on the creation of a permanent exhibition in the revitalised building of the former Bersohn and Bauman Children's Hospital, collecting archives, artefacts and testimonies of memory and drawing on the achievements, experience and resources of Polish and foreign institutions that deal with the topic of the ghetto.\nThe statutory tasks of the museum include: activities for the protection and care of the cultural heritage of Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto, conducting cultural, scientific, educational and popularisation activities related to the history of the Warsaw Ghetto and other ghettos built on the occupied Polish territories, initiating and supporting social initiatives and non-governmental organisations that contribute to the protection and commemoration of the history of the Warsaw Ghetto.\nHistory\nSigmund Nissenbaum, a participant in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, was the first initiator of the establishment of the Warsaw Ghetto Museum. At the end of the 1980s, he contacted the President of the Society of Fighters for Freedom and Democracy, prof. Henryk Jabłoński, to entrust the establishment of the Warsaw Ghetto Museum to the Nissenbaum Family Foundation. However, the works did not start at that point.\nOn 14 November 2017, the decision to establish the Warsaw Ghetto Museum was announced by the Polish Minister of Culture and National Heritage, Deputy Prime Minister Piotr Gliński. The museum was officially established on 28 February 2018. On 7 March 2018, in the Chancellery of the Prime Minister, there was a press conference on the establishment of the new institution, attended by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and Minister Piotr Gliński.\nIn October 2018, the local government of the Mazowieckie Voivodeship leased the complex of the Bersohn and Bauman Children's Hospital to the museum for 30 years. Both buildings of the former hospital - the main pavilion and the southern pavilion - have been entered on the list of historical monuments by the Mazowieckie Voivodeship Conservator of Monuments in 2018. The permanent exhibition of the museum will be presented in the main building of the former hospital, while the two-storey southern pavilion, where the ophthalmology department was located, is to become the seat of the Education Department of the museum.\nIn November 2020, on the 80th anniversary of the closing of the ghetto borders, the authorities of the Mazowieckie Voivodeship sold the museum building for PLN 22.7 million (the funds for that purpose were provided by the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage).\nIn 2020, the Institute of National Remembrance agreed to hand over the original of the Stroop Report as a deposit for the permanent exhibition at the museum.\nThe first meeting of the international Warsaw Ghetto Museum Council, that consisted of 15 members, took place on 10 September 2019. The Chairman of the Council became the Chief Rabbi of Poland, Michael Schudrich. In June 2021, the position was taken by Colette Avital.\nVisual identification\nThe concept for the visual identity of the Warsaw Ghetto Museum is the result of an international competition organised jointly with the Polish Association of Applied Graphic Designers. The competition was announced in September 2019. In the first stage, 216 applications were submitted, out of which the jury selected 6. The authors of the winning concept are the designers from the Lithuanian studio DADADA.\nPermanent exhibition\nThe work on the concept of the permanent exhibition began in 2019, under the supervision of Daniel Blatman, a historian and Professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The scientific team of the museum prepared documents with the initial concept of the exhibition. The team adopted three key parameters, which will constitute dominant themes in the historical narrative of the museum:\n* a presentation of the broad perspective of Jewish life in Poland during the German occupation, going beyond the framework of Jewish history in the Warsaw Ghetto;\n* the history of the Warsaw Ghetto against the background of the history of occupied Warsaw;\n* conveying a universal message, based on which the tragedy of the Holocaust and extermination of Jews in Warsaw is the starting point for learning about the fate of other victims of Nazi persecution and for demonstrating humanistic values such as tolerance, compassion for minorities, dialogue between religious, ethnic and national groups.\nThe permanent exhibition of the museum is to be based on authentic artefacts from the period of the German occupation of Poland.\nIn autumn 2022, the museum published a series of videos presenting the concepts of the permanent exhibition galleries. The videos featured the curators of the galleries and specialists involved in the preparation of the exhibition.\nThe museum constantly looks for historical artefacts, testimonies and documents relating to the functioning of the Warsaw Ghetto and its commemoration.\nIn 2022, the museum's collection included 5,125 artefacts, divided into archives, iconography and exhibits.\nThe most valuable artefacts in WGM collection\n1. Hannukiah – a monumentral candelabrum of the synagogue type, dating to the 19th century. Made of bronze, the base is supported by depictions of lions. Purchased at Sotheby's auction in December 2022.\n2.  A kiddush cup which belonged to Kalman Kalonymus Shapiro, one of the Schutz shop's employees. A present of one of Shapiro's father Elimelech's follower from Grodzisko.\n3. Megillat Esther – a pre-war megillah case made of silver in the Warsaw factory of Israel Szekman (the factory was closed in 1939). The central part bears an inscription in Hebrew. This in an object of exceptionally unique historical value, a witness to religious life in the Warsaw Ghetto.\n4. Stroop Report.\n5. Photographs of the burning ghetto – 11 photographs of the burning Warsaw Ghetto made from the “Aryan” side. The photos were taken on May 2, 1943 by Ryszard Jurgelewicz. The collection was donated to WGM in November 2022 by the photographer's grandson Ryszard Sikorski.\n6. Cart for transporting dead bodies – dated to the 1930s, it has undergone professional restoration. The cart was discovered and purchased after the war by Pinkus Szenicer, a long-time guard of the Jewish cemetery in Warsaw. It then became the property of Szenicer's son Bolesław Szenicer (1952-), the founder of The Jewish Cemetery Foundation “Gęsia” in Warsaw. The cart was purchased with the help of The Nissenbaum Family Foundation.\n7. Henryk Hechtkopf, Ruiny („Ruins”) – a collection of 76 drawings was donated to WGM by Rachel Postavski. The collection includes 22 drawings of the Warsaw Ghetto ruins which were drawn from nature – they are dated 1946-47. The rest depictions scenes from the ghetto life, as well as postwar life in Warsaw.\n8.  Erna Rosenstein, Golgota („Calvary”), 1968, acrylic, canvas – an exceptional piece not only in Erna Rosenstein's heritage but also in the whole Polish postwar art, which deals with a complicated history in private, social and political layers. It will be one of the key works of the WGM collection and the permanent exhibition of the museum.\n9. Gustav Metzger, Historic Photographs: no. 1: Liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto, April 19 – 28 days, 1943, 1995/2022 – a series of historical photographs made from enlarged archival photos that have been somehow hidden or obscured so that the viewer is not able to see the whole picture at once. For the museum, this is an extremely interesting work contextualizing the photos from the original Stroop Report as well as other photographs from the ghetto.\n10. Maryan S. Maryan, no name, 1969, acrylic, canvas.\n11. Ceija Stojka, SS.Auschitz, 2002, acrylic, carton.\n12. Harun Farocki, Respite, 2007, film – a film based on the materials recorded in the Nazi Westerborg transit camp (The Netherlands) by a prisoner Rudolph Breslauer by order of the camp commander. The original recording, re-edited and accompanied by text comments, shows the delusion of the documentary being in fact an instrument of progagadna where the author carefully smuggles the fragments of cruel reality which are visible for Farocki and the audience many years later. The film will be a part of the collection of contemporary artists' work.\nTemporary exhibitions\nIn the course of its efforts to create a permanent exhibition, the museum also undertakes various exhibition-related activities. The projects of the museum are made available both in the urban space of Warsaw and in the virtual space. The following exhibitions have been organised so far:\n# \"Witness to History.

In October 2021, the museum, in cooperation with the Pułtusk Academy of Humanities, performed excavations at the northern border of the Krasiński Garden, on the western side of the pre-war axis of Wałowa Street. During the excavations, more than a thousand objects were found.\nIn the summer of 2022, the museum, in cooperation with Christopher Newport University and the Pułtusk Academy of Humanities, began excavations and archaeological research in Muranów, on the site of the former Warsaw Ghetto. The research was performed in the area of Miła – Dubois – Niska –Karmelicka streets, in the area where Anielewicz's bunker was located. Approximately 3,000 artefacts were found during the excavation works, including many objects of everyday use, as well as religious objects such as pieces of Jewish prayer books and tefillin used by Jews.\nIn September 2022, the Warsaw Ghetto Museum was one of the organisers of the international academic conference \"80 years after Aktion «Reinhardt» (1942-1943)\". The conference was held as part of the commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the beginning of Operation Reinhardt, which was carried out by Nazi Germany in the years 1942-1943, on the territory of the General Government and the Białystok District.\nThe museum also organizes scientific seminars on Holocaust-related subjects and its perceptions in museums. Another scientific activity is organizing series of webinars about the Holocaust.\nEducational activities\nThe museum has a well-developed educational offer for both kids and adults. The Education Department of the museum offers school lessons and workshops, seminars, conferences, Warsaw walking tours and educational walks.\nThe classes organised by the museum concern both the religion, tradition and culture of Polish Jews, as well as the history of the Warsaw Ghetto and the everyday life of people forced to live there.

On regular basis, the museum also organises lessons in secondary schools located in the area of former Warsaw Ghetto.\nIn the spring of 2019, WGM began a series of regular Warsaw walking tours related to the history and functioning of the Warsaw Ghetto. The tours are in Polish, English and German. In April 2022, Warsaw walking tours for refugees from Ukraine were added to the offer of the museum.\nThe Education Department of the museum offers training for teachers and educators in the form of conferences, getaway seminars and workshops. Meetings with teachers and educators were initiated with the 2019 conference \"Around the Warsaw Ghetto and other ghettos of occupied Poland\" ( 29-31 March 2019). So far, four getaway seminars have been organised: \"Warsaw Ghetto – Treblinka – Majdanek\" (25-27 October 2019), \"Chełmno nad Nerem and Łódź\" (9 October 2021), \"In the footsteps of Operation Reinhardt – Lublin, Trawniki, Poniatowa\" (26-27 March 2022) and \"Hasag – German forced labour camp\" (1-2 October 2022).\nAs part of the collaboration with the Polish Underground State Foundation, an educational guide related to the history of the Jews from Warsaw was produced in 2019. The guide in the form of an educational game is available on the website of the museum.\nCooperation with the World Association of Home Army Soldiers, within the framework of the \"Niepodległa\" Multi-Annual Programme, has resulted in a series of interviews with the Holocaust survivors, former Gray Ranks scouts, members of the underground, witnesses to history and family members of the Righteous Among the Nations. Another project implemented as part of the \"Niepodległa\" Multi-Annual Programme was entitled: \"The image of the Jewish community in the eyes of their neighbours\". This time, the residents of Warsaw, Łódź, Vilnius, Novogrudok, Oświęcim, Mińsk Mazowiecki, Tykocin and Bliżyn shared their memories. They talked about their Jewish neighbours, about events from their common and – from a certain moment – separate history which remained in their memory.\nIn 2020, the museum started a video project: \"The Warsaw ghetto in Literature\", the purpose of which was to show the ghetto from three perspectives: victims, executioners and witnesses. The project is an artistic interpretation of four publications: \"Shielding the flame\" (Zdążyć przed Panem Bogiem) by Hanna Krall, \"Conversations with an executioner\" by Kazimierz Moczarski, \"Campo di Fiori\" by Czesław Miłosz and \"Memories. My version\" by Wacław Isaac Kornblum. As part of a project for schools located on the territory of the former Warsaw Ghetto, the motto of which was: \"What does it mean – what might it mean for our future – that we live around the place of their death?\"(J. M. Rymkiewicz). The film \"Opening the Silence\" was produced in cooperation with a high school – XVII Liceum Ogólnokształcące z Oddziałami Dwujęzycznymi im. Andrzeja Frycza Modrzewskiego.\nIn November 2022, the Education Department of the museum in collaboration with the Faculty of Social Sciences of the SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities organised a webinar: \"Around the trauma of the Holocaust\" dedicated to the issue of trauma in its broadest sense. The seminar was attended by researchers from Poland, Ukraine and Israel.\nThe Education Department of the museum is also involved in the design of urban and educational games on the history of the Warsaw Ghetto and educational materials for teachers and educators.\nPublications\nThe museum is also involved in publishing activities.
