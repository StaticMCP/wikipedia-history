The plot is loosely based on the 1973 tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs. The film stars Emma Stone and Steve Carell as King and Riggs, leading an ensemble cast including Andrea Riseborough, Elisabeth Shue, Austin Stowell, Bill Pullman, Natalie Morales, Eric Christian Olsen, and Sarah Silverman in supporting roles. The film marks the second collaboration between Carell and Stone after Crazy, Stupid, Love and the second collaboration between Riseborough and Stone after Birdman.\nThe film had its premiere at the 44th Telluride Film Festival on September 2, 2017, and was theatrically released in the United States by Fox Searchlight Pictures on September 22, 2017. It received positive reviews from critics, who praised the performances of Stone and Carell and the direction, with some calling it the best performance of Stone's career. Despite the positive reviews, the picture performed poorly at the box office, grossing $18.6 million against a $25 million budget.\nAt the 75th Golden Globe Awards, Stone and Carell received nominations for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy respectively. Both received Critics Choice Awards nominations in the categories Best Actress in a Comedy and Best Actor in a Comedy. At the 24th Screen Actors Guild Awards, Carell received a nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role.\nPlot\nIn 1970, pro-tennis player Billie Jean King and her manager, Gladys Heldman, confront promoter Jack Kramer, who has organized a tennis tournament for which the top prize for women is one-eighth of the men's prize despite equal ticket sales. King and Heldman threaten to start their own tour but Kramer won't alter the terms, citing the inferiority of women's tennis. When King, and fellow tennis players Julie Heldman, Valerie Ziegenfuss, Judy Dalton, Kristy Pigeon, Peaches Bartkowicz, Kerry Melville Reid, Nancy Richey, and Rosie Casals sign on as the “Original 9” players of what becomes the WTA Tour, Kramer bans them from tournaments organized by the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association.\nWhile the women's tour struggles during its early days, Billie Jean King begins an affair with Marilyn Barnett, her hairdresser, threatening her marriage to Larry King. Meanwhile, men's pro-tennis player Bobby Riggs's marriage to the wealthy Priscilla Whelan is in trouble because of his addiction to gambling. Thrown out of his house when he can't conceal a Rolls-Royce he won in a tennis bet, he hits upon the idea of a challenge match against the top woman player, boasting that even at age 55 he can beat any woman.\nThe women's tour has slowly gained a stronger foothold, with the Women's Tennis Association formed in 1973. Riggs continues to pressure King to play him. Eventually, Riggs persuades Margaret Court, who recently overtook King to gain the World No. 1 ranking, to play a match in May 1973. Riggs easily defeats Court and King decides she has to accept his challenge, but demands a final say as to the arrangements. King trains intensely, while Riggs relaxes. King objects to Kramer as a game announcer, threatening to not play unless he withdraws, which he does. After a slow start, King wins the match, changing the future of women's tennis.\nA textual epilogue states that King divorced her husband in the 1980s, retired from tennis in 1990, and later became involved in a long-term same-sex relationship while Riggs reunited with his wife but never quit his gambling habit.\nCast\n* Emma Stone as Billie Jean King\n* Steve Carell as Bobby Riggs\n* Andrea Riseborough as Marilyn Barnett\n* Sarah Silverman as Gladys Heldman\n* Bill Pullman as Jack Kramer\n* Alan Cumming as Cuthbert \"Ted\" Tinling\n* Elisabeth Shue as Priscilla Riggs\n* Austin Stowell as Larry King\n* Natalie Morales as Rosie Casals (“Original 9”)\n* Jessica McNamee as Margaret Court\n* Fred Armisen as Rheo Blair\n* Lewis Pullman as Larry Riggs\n* Martha MacIsaac as Jane “Peaches” Bartkowicz (“Original 9”)\n* Mickey Sumner as Valerie Ziegenfuss (“Original 9”)\n* Bridey Elliott as Julie Heldman (“Original 9”)\n* Eric Christian Olsen as Lornie Kuhle\n* Wallace Langham as Henry\n* Matt Malloy as Rigg's Therapist\n* Dan Bakkedahl as Gamblers Anon Leader\n* Chris Parnell as DJ\n* Bob Stephenson as PR Sugar Daddy\n* John C.

Brie Larson was, for a brief period, set to replace Stone due to scheduling conflicts, but these were cleared up. On March 3, 2016, Andrea Riseborough was cast to play Marilyn Barnett, King's hairdresser and lover. Later that month, three more were cast in the film, Elisabeth Shue as Riggs's wife; Austin Stowell as Larry King, Billie Jean's husband; and Sarah Silverman as Gladys Heldman, the founder of World Tennis magazine. Four actors joined the cast in April: Eric Christian Olsen as Lornie Kuhle, Jessica McNamee as tennis player Margaret Court, Alan Cumming as designer Ted Tinling, and Natalie Morales as player Rosie Casals.\nPrincipal photography on the film began in Los Angeles on April 13, 2016, with a budget of more than $25 million.\nFor the tennis match scenes, tennis players Kaitlyn Christian (who portrays “Original 9” member Kerry Melville Reid) and Vince Spadea were the body doubles of Stone and Carell, respectively.\nThe score was composed by Nicholas Britell. He also co-wrote the original song \"If I Dare\" with Sara Bareilles who also performed it.\nRelease\nBattle of the Sexes had its world premiere at the Telluride Film Festival on September 2, 2017. It also screened at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, 2017, and at the BFI London Film Festival on October 7, 2017. The film began a limited release in the United States on September 22, 2017, before going wide the following week.\nReception\nBox office\nBattle of the Sexes grossed $12.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $5.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $18.4 million.\nIn its opening weekend, the film grossed $515,450 from 21 theaters, an average of $24,545 per theater.
