The tract was granted in 1764 by Lieutenant Governor Cadwallader Colden of the New York crown colony, in the name of King George III to the board of governors (trustees) of King's College – the predecessor of today's Columbia University and the Canadian University of King's College. The grant was intended for the eventual expansion of the college.\nThe emergence of the Vermont Republic in 1777 forestalled claim of the grant, and Vermont's General Assembly made a grant of the same land in 1785 to William Samuel Johnson, an American founding father and jurist who informally represented Vermont before the Continental Congress and argued for its eventual admission to the federal union.\nBy coincidence, the association with King's College, now Columbia University, continued, as Johnson became president of then Columbia College in 1787.\nThough Columbia University never moved to King's College Tract, eventually a college was located there. In 1828, John Chesamore founded the Lamoille Academy, predecessor to Johnson State College, now a campus of Vermont State University.\nReferences and further reading\n* Graff, Nancy Price.
