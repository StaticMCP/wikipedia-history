Internationally, he played for the Canadian national team at the 1958 World Championships, winning the gold medal.\nPlaying career\nIn 1958, at age 21, Edwards backstopped the Whitby Dunlops, Canada's representative, to the World Championships at Oslo, Norway. He posted a perfect 7–0 record in the eight-team round-robin tournament. In those seven games, Edwards played every minute. He recorded three shutouts and allowed six total goals to have a 0.86 goals-against average.\nIn 1960, he became property of the Chicago Black Hawks. His name was engraved on the Stanley Cup in 1961 even though he never played a single game for Chicago.\nEdwards' road to the NHL was a long, winding one. In nine years, he played for seven teams in four leagues. On June 6, 1967, the Pittsburgh Penguins selected him in the expansion draft, but traded him to the Detroit Red Wings the very next day.\nIn 1967–68, Roger Crozier, the Red Wings' first-string goaltender, retired due to illness, and Edwards was called upon to take his place. He led the team in games and wins for four consecutive seasons.\nA collision in 1970 with an opposing forward and the goalpost caused a hairline fracture in Edwards' skull, and this caused him headaches and dizzy spells. His health caused him to retire, but only briefly. He made a comeback with the Pittsburgh Penguins, and after one season there, he returned to the Wings. He had his best season in 1972–73: he won 27 games and led the NHL with six shutouts. The following season, he lost his first three games and retired for good.\nPersonal life\nEdwards was the uncle of Don Edwards, also an NHL goalie.\nCareer statistics\nRegular season and playoffs\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" |\n! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" |\n! colspan=\"9\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" | Regular season\n! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" |\n! colspan=\"8\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" | Playoffs\n|- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n!
