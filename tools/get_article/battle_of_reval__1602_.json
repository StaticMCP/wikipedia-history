Żółkiewski attacked \"on the march\" with two squadrons of Polish hussars. The charge, however, was not successful.\nAs a result, the Swedish forces put up frisian horses as a protection against further frontal cavalry charges. Żółkiewski then sent light cavalry on a round about flanking maneuver which attacked the Swedes from behind, coinciding with another charge by the hussars. The Swedish lines broke as a result. The Swedes were led by Reinhold Anrep.\nReferences\n*Leszek Podhorodecki, \"Stanisław Żółkiewski\", Warszawa 1988,"
