As fellow members of the Commonwealth of Nations, the United Kingdom and Brunei exchange high commissioners rather than ambassadors. In 1958 the constitution was changed, the post of British resident was abolished and the full on British high commission for Brunei was established. Sir Dennis Charles White, who had been appointed as resident the previous year, became the first high commissioner under the new Constitution.\nList of high commissioners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!No.\n!Name\n!Took office\n!Left office\n!Monarch\n!Ref\n|-\n|1\n|Dennis Charles White\n|29 September 1959\n|31 March 1963\n| rowspan=\"19\" |Elizabeth II\n|\n|-\n|2\n|Angus MacKay Mackintosh\n|1 April 1963\n|9 December 1963\n|\n|-\n|3\n|Edgar Ord Laird\n|9 December 1963\n|1965\n|\n|-\n|4\n|Fernley Douglas Webber\n|1 August 1965\n|October 1967\n|\n|-\n|5\n|Arthur Robin Adair\n|December 1967\n|January 1972\n|\n|-\n|6\n|Peter Gautrey\n|12 January 1972\n|14 January 1975\n|\n|-\n|7\n|James Alfred Davidson\n|January 1975\n|1978\n|\n|-\n|8\n|Arthur Christopher Watson\n|October 1978\n|31 December 1983\n|\n|-\n|9\n|Robert Francis Cornish\n|6 November 1983\n|5 August 1986\n|\n|-\n|10\n|Roger Westbrook\n|1986\n|1991\n|\n|-\n|11\n|Adrian Sindall\n|1991\n|1994\n|\n|-\n|12\n|Ivan Roy Callan\n|1994\n|1998\n|\n|-\n|13\n|Stuart Laing\n|1998\n|2002\n|\n|-\n|14\n|Andrew Caie\n|January 2002\n|2005\n|\n|-\n|15\n|John Saville\n|2005\n|2009\n|\n|-\n|16\n|Rob Fenn\n|2009\n|2013\n|\n|-\n|17\n|David Campbell\n|2013\n|2017\n|\n|-\n|18\n|Richard Lindsay\n|2017\n|2020\n|\n|-\n|19\n|John Virgoe\n|August 2020\n|August 2024\n|\n|-\n|20\n|Alexandra McKenzie\n|August 2024\n|present\n| rowspan=\"19\" |Charles III\n|}\nSee also\n* List of administrators of British Brunei\n* Brunei–United Kingdom relations\n* Foreign relations of Brunei\n* List of high commissioners of Brunei to the United Kingdom\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.gov.uk/government/world/organisations/british-high-commission-bandar-seri-begawan British High Commission Bandar Seri Begawan]"
