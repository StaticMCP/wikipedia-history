It is located on the flank of a hill on the south side of the Colorado River, across from the older town of Parachute. The two communities together are known as \"Parachute-Battlement Mesa\". The town takes its name from Battlement Mesa, an  basalt-topped mesa that sits to the south of the town.\nHistory\nThe community was first developed by an oil company as a residence for its workers in the expectation that the rising price of oil would make shale oil extraction economically viable. When adjusted oil prices fell, the housing estate was left as a stranded asset, and the oil company marketed it to retirees in conjunction with a real estate firm.\nBattlement Mesa Schoolhouse\nThe Battlement Mesa Schoolhouse, located at 7201 300 Road, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The rear portion of the building was built in 1897 with stone from a local quarry. The front portion was added in 1907, also using stone from the same quarry. By the late 1940s, the building was no longer used as a schoolhouse but was used for community gatherings and events. However, the local population declined, and the schoolhouse fell into disuse and was looted and vandalized. In 2003, the State Historical Fund awarded a grant to The Grand Valley Historical Society to restore the school building.\nGeography\nBattlement Mesa is located in Garfield County on the south side of the Colorado River.
