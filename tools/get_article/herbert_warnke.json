He joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1923 and became actively involved in trade union activism. In 1932 he was elected to the Reichstag and held his seat until the Nazi seizure of power in 1933. Later that same year he became secretary of Profintern in Saarbrücken and Paris and actively opposed the Nazis during the remainder of the Interwar period. He lived in a number of countries during his exile from Nazi Germany. During World War II he was in Sweden where he worked with a number of organizations for exiled Germans.\nAfter the defeat of the Nazis, Warnke returned to Soviet-occupied Germany and helped found the Free German Trade Union Federation (FDGB). He succeeded Hans Jendretzky as First Chairman of the organization, serving from 1948 until his death in 1975. He was elected to the Volkskammer in 1949 and was also elected to the State Council of East Germany in 1971.\nHerbert Warnke was a passionate fan of 1. FC Union Berlin.\nReferences"
