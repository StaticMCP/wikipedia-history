The marker is a concrete structure in the shape of a truncated pyramid with a rectangular cross-section.  It is  wide,  high, and  deep.  On the west side of the marker is raised lettering stating \"ROSE ISLAND / AMERICAN SAMOA / TRESPASSING PROHIBITED / WARREN J. TERHUNE / JAN 10 1920  GOVERNOR\".  A brass plaque on the opposite side of the monument conveys a similar message.  The monument was placed in 1920 by the order of Naval Governor Warren J. Terhune during a tour he made of all of the islands of the territory of American Samoa, and serves as a continuing reminder of the American claim to the atoll.\nThe monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in American Samoa\nReferences"
