He began his acting career primarily with small roles in film and television starting in 1969. For his first film role, he was credited as \"Arnold Strong\", but was credited with his birth name thereafter. He has appeared mainly in action and comedy films. In addition to films and television, he has appeared in music videos for AC/DC, Bon Jovi, and Guns N' Roses.\nIn the 1980s, Schwarzenegger became his primary character in two&nbsp;film franchises: as Conan in the Conan series and as The Terminator in the Terminator series. His other film roles include Commando, The Running Man, Predator, Total Recall, Last Action Hero and True Lies. Although Schwarzenegger's acting career was put on hiatus due to his position as governor of California, he also made several cameos in various films while in office, including The Kid & I and The Expendables. On February 11, 2011, just over a month after leaving office, Schwarzenegger announced he would return to acting.\nSchwarzenegger has received several awards and nominations for his work in films. In Stay Hungry, one of his early roles, he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Acting Debut in a Motion Picture. He has also been nominated for various awards for his roles in Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Junior, and True Lies. According to Box Office Mojo, a box office revenue tracking website, films in which Schwarzenegger has acted have grossed a total of more than $1.7&nbsp;billion within the United States, with an average of $67&nbsp;million per film and total $4.0&nbsp;billion worldwide. According to The Numbers, another box office revenue tracking website, films in which Schwarzenegger has acted have total grossed around $4.5&nbsp;billion worldwide.\nFilm\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Role\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n! scope=row| 1970\n| Hercules in New York\n| Hercules\n| Credited as Arnold Strong \"Mr. Universe\"\n|\n|-\n! scope=row| 1973\n| The Long Goodbye\n| Hood in Augustine's Office\n| Uncredited\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n! scope=row| 1976\n| Stay Hungry\n| Joe Santo\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=row| 1977\n| Pumping Iron\n| Himself\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" | 1979\n| The Villain\n| \"Handsome Stranger\"\n|\n|\n|-\n| Scavenger Hunt\n| Lars\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=row| 1982\n| Conan the Barbarian\n| Conan the Barbarian\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" | 1984\n| Conan the Destroyer\n| Conan the Destroyer\n|\n|\n|-\n| The Terminator\n| The Terminator\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" | 1985\n| Red Sonja\n| Lord Kalidor\n|\n|\n|-\n| Commando\n| Colonel John Matrix\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=row| 1986\n| Raw Deal\n| Sheriff Mark Kaminsky / Joseph P.
