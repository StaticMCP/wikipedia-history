The Republican ticket of the commanding general of the United States Army Ulysses S. Grant and the speaker of the United States House of Representatives Schuyler Colfax defeated the Democratic ticket of the former governor of New York Horatio Seymour and the former U.S. representative from Missouri's 1st congressional district Francis P. Blair Jr.. Grant defeated Seymour in the national election with 214 electoral votes.\nGeneral election\nSummary\nIndiana chose 13 electors on a statewide general ticket. Nineteenth-century election laws required voters to vote directly for members of the Electoral College rather than for president. This sometimes resulted in small differences in the number of votes cast for electors pledged to the same presidential candidate, if some voters did not vote for all the electors nominated by a party. This table reflects the statewide popular vote as calculated by Walter Dean Burnham in his influential study, Presidential Ballots, 1836–1892.\n}}\n2.13}}\n}}\n2.13}}\n}}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Indiana\nNotes\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*"
