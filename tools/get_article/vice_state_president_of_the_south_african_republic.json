The vice president was to act if the State President of the South African Republic was indisposed in case of mental or bodily disability, or was outside of the country. The vice president was constitutional successor of the president.\nThe position was first established in March 1877 before the British annexation in April 1877.\nList of officeholders\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=2|\n! rowspan=2| Portrait\n! rowspan=2| Name\n! colspan=3| Term of office\n|-\n!
