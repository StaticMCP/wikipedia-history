It premiered on December 1, 2010. A 16th season premiered on June 7, 2025.\nWhen rent is not paid on a storage locker for three months in California, the contents can be sold by an auctioneer as a single lot of items in the form of a cash-only auction. The show follows professional buyers who visit storage facilities throughout the state and bid on these lockers. Before each locker is auctioned, the buyers are given five minutes to inspect the contents from the doorway, but may not enter the locker or touch any of the items.\nAfter the day's auctions are completed, the winning bidders sort through the lockers, estimating the prices they will set on the contents and/or consulting with experts for an appraisal of unusual items. Running totals on-screen display the cost versus the estimated total value, and a final tally at the end of the episode summarizes the buyers' net profit or loss.\nHistory\nThom Beers is the executive producer and narrator of the show. He provides a quick explanation of the show's premise at the beginning and does a recap of the featured buyers' profits or losses at the end of each episode. He has stated that the series avoids delving into behind-the-scenes stories of the lockers' original owners because \"all you see is misery there, and I didn't want to trade on that\". In the United States, Storage Wars premiered on A&E on December 1, 2010.\nSeason one of Storage Wars consisted of 19 episodes, 17 of which were filmed at various self-storage facilities throughout Southern California. The show enjoyed ratings success, and its second-season premiere attracted 5.1million total viewers, making it the most-watched program in A&E's history to that point.\nStorage Wars was recommissioned for another 26-episode season, which premiered on June 5, 2012. Only 20 of the 26 episodes were aired however, with six of the episodes being held back for broadcast during the second half of the show's  season which began airing on December 4, 2012.\nStorage Wars concluded its  season on January 30, 2019, and there initially was no news regarding a season renewal. A  season was eventually announced in March 2021 and premiered on April 20.  Season 14 premiered on November 2, 2021, with Barry Weiss returning as a buyer, after departing the series in 2013 during season 4.\nSeason 15 aired 24 episodes and concluded on August 15, 2023. A 16th season is scheduled to premiere on June 7, 2025, with the series transitioning to an hour-long format. The season will include the return of buyer Dave Hester, absent since the conclusion of season 12.\nSpin-offs\nSeveral spin-off series were also produced, most of them airing on A&E:\n* Storage Wars: Texas (2011–14)\n* Storage Wars: New York (2013)\n* Storage Wars: Canada (originally aired on OLN from 2013 to 2015; re-runs aired as Storage Wars: Northern Treasures on A&E)\n* ''Barry'd Treasure (2014)\n* Brandi & Jarrod: Married to the Job (2014)\n* Storage Wars: Miami (2015)\n* Storage Wars France: Enchères surprises (aired on 6ter)\nParticipants\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" width:\"100%\" font-size:5%; line-height:6px;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:15%;\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:9%;\" | Known As\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:15%;\" | Spinoff\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%;\" | Occupation\n! colspan=\"16\" scope=\"col\" style=\"width:50%;\" | Seasons\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4%;\" | 1\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4%;\" | 2\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4%;\" | 3\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4%;\" | 4\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4%;\" | 5\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4%;\" | 6\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4%;\" | 7\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4%;\" | 8\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4%;\" | 9\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4%;\" | 10\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4%;\" | 11\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4%;\" | 12\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4%;\" | 13\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4%;\" | 14\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4%;\" | 15\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4%;\" | 16\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Dave Hester\n| The Mogul\n|\n| Buyer\n| colspan=\"3\"\n| colspan=\"1\"\n| colspan=\"8\"\n| colspan=\"3\"\n| colspan=\"1\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Darrell Sheets\n| The Gambler\n|\n| Buyer\n| colspan=\"15\"\n| colspan=\"1\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Brandon Sheets\n| The Sidebet\n|\n| Buyer\n| colspan=\"9\"\n| colspan=\"7\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Jarrod Schulz\n| rowspan=\"2\" | The Young Guns\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Brandi & Jarrod: Married to the Job\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Buyers\n| colspan=\"13\"\n| colspan=\"3\"\n|-\n|Brandi Passante\n| colspan=\"16\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Barry Weiss\n| The Collector\n| Barry'd Treasure\n| Buyer\n| colspan=\"4\"\n| colspan=\"9\"\n| colspan=\"2\"\n| colspan=\"1\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Dan and Laura Dotson\n| American Auctioneers\n|\n| Auctioneers\n| colspan=\"16\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Ivy Calvin\n| The King\n|\n| Buyer\n| colspan=\"2\"\n| colspan=\"2\"\n| colspan=\"12\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Rene and Casey Nezhoda\n| The Bargain Hunters\n|\n| Buyers\n| colspan=\"3\"\n| colspan=\"1\"\n| colspan=\"12\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Mary Padian\n| The Junkster\n| Storage Wars: Texas\n| Buyer\n| colspan=\"4\"\n| colspan=\"9\"\n| colspan=\"4\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Kenny Crossley\n|\n|\n| Buyer\n| colspan=\"1\"\n| colspan=\"3\"\n| colspan=\"5\"\n| colspan=\"7\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Emily Wears\n|\n|\n| Auctioneer\n| colspan=\"9\"\n| colspan=\"3\"\n| colspan=\"4\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Shana Dahan and Edwina Registre\n| The Vegas Ladies\n|\n| Buyers\n| colspan=\"10\"\n| colspan=\"2\"\n| colspan=\"4\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Justin Bryant\n| The Rookie\n|\n| Buyer\n| colspan=\"10\"\n| colspan=\"2\"\n| colspan=\"4\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Lisa Delarios\n|\n|\n| Buyer\n| colspan=\"12\"\n| colspan=\"3\"\n| colspan=\"1\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Dusty Riach\n|\n|\n| Buyer\n| colspan=\"13\"\n| colspan=\"2\"\n| colspan=\"1\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Mark Balelo\n| Rico Suavé\n|\n| Buyer\n| colspan=\"1\"\n| colspan=\"3\"\n| colspan=\"12\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Nabila Haniss\n| Paris Hilton\n|\n| Buyer\n| colspan=\"1\"\n| colspan=\"3\"\n| colspan=\"12\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Jeff Jarred\n|\n|\n| Buyer\n| colspan=\"2\"\n| colspan=\"1\"\n| colspan=\"13\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Herb Brown and Mike Karlinger\n| The Tank Top Twins\n|\n| Buyer\n| colspan=\"2\"\n| colspan=\"2\"\n| colspan=\"12\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Mark and Matt Harris\n| The Harris Brothers\n|\n| Buyers\n| colspan=\"2\"\n| colspan=\"2\"\n| colspan=\"12\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Earl and Johan Graham\n|\n|\n| Auctioneers\n| colspan=\"3\"\n| colspan=\"1\"\n| colspan=\"12\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Maverick Harvey\n|\n|\n| Buyer\n| colspan=\"6\"\n| colspan=\"2\"\n| colspan=\"8\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Chad\n|\n|\n| Buyer\n| colspan=\"9\"\n| colspan=\"3\"\n| colspan=\"4\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Lupe Riach\n|\n|\n| Buyer\n| colspan=\"14\"\n| colspan=\"1\"\n| colspan=\"1\"\n|}\nMain buyers\nDave Hester\nDave Hester, also known as The Mogul'' (seasons 1–3; seasons 5–12; season 16-): At the start of the series, Hester owned Newport Consignment Gallery in Costa Mesa, California and the Rags to Riches thrift store, but closed them in June 2011. He now operates his own auction house, Dave Hester Auctions. Hester has had confrontations with the other main buyers, especially Darrell and Brandon Sheets, and is known to frequently raise bids when somebody else wants to buy a storage unit. Hester's son Dave Jr. occasionally appeared on the show with him. Dave Hester's signature catchword is a loud \"YUUUP!\" when making a bid. He has this word imprinted on his trucks, T-shirts, and hats. Hester's call originated from him being a bid-catcher in auction facilities, helping auctioneers spot bidders in a crowd. In December 2012, Hester was fired from the show, and sued the show's producers for wrongful termination; part of his lawsuit was tossed out in March 2013. Hester didn't appear in the fourth season but returned for season five.\nDarrell and Brandon Sheets\nDarrell Sheets, also known as The Gambler (seasons 1–15): A storage auction veteran from San Diego. His catchphrase is \"This is the WOW factor!\" and he makes the occasional malapropism.

In an interview, Sheets indicated that some of his biggest finds in lockers included a sizable comic book collection, four drawings by Pablo Picasso, and a letter written by Abraham Lincoln that sold for over . Darrell was often accompanied by his son Brandon Sheets, also known as The Sidebet. In later seasons, Brandon attended auctions on his own and also bid against his father for the same units.\nIn the season-two special \"Unlocked: Sell High\", Darrell revealed that he once found a plastic-wrapped human corpse in a storage locker. It was determined that the previous owner of the locker had murdered his wife and left her in the unit. In the season three finale, Darrell bought a locker for , which was discovered to have contained many pieces of original artwork by Frank Gutierrez.

The Long Beach store is shown to have closed during the opening segment of the episode aired on April 8, 2014. Their Orange store also permanently closed in early 2016. On April 24, 2014, A&E premiered the special Brandi & Jarrod: Married to the Job, which focuses on the two balancing running their business and raising their two children. The special led to a spin-off series of the same name, premiering on August 12, 2014. Though identified on-screen as husband and wife in some episodes, Schulz and Passante never actually married. They have two children, Cameron and Payton. In the season 13 premiere, it is revealed that Jarrod and Brandi have broken up, but they continue to bid separately.\nBarry Weiss\nBarry Weiss, also known as The Collector (seasons 1–4; season 14–15): Weiss and his brother owned a successful produce company until he retired.

Wears married in 2017, and is close friends with auction buyer Mary Padian.\nEpisodes\nReception\nCritical response\nCritical response was mixed, with Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times calling Storage Wars \"a strangely uplifting showhope being one of the many things one can apparently find in an abandoned storage unit,\" and Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times called the series \"an especially entertaining addition to the genre.\" Brian Lowry of Variety said that Wars' should have been left in storage, indefinitely.\" Writing for Slate magazine, Troy Patterson gave a mixed review, referring to the series as \"trash TV\" as well as \"trivial and magnetic.\" Ellen Gray of the Philadelphia Daily News suggested \"if there's an acquisitive bone in your body, you should probably steer clear\".\nRatings\nThe first-season premiere episode drew 2.1million viewers and the show was A&E's top-rated non-fiction show for 2010, with an average of 2.4million viewers. The season two premiere consisted of back-to-back new episodes of the show; the second show drew 5.1million total viewers and was the highest rating for an episode of a series in A&E history. The combined season premiere outperformed competing original episodes of NBC's Love in the Wild and ABC's Primetime Nightline.\nConcerns about authenticity\nSome critics have speculated that some of the units have been stocked by producers, but an A&E publicist said: \"There is no staging involved. The items uncovered in the storage units are the actual items featured on the show\". Executive producer Thom Beers has stated that the vast majority of the storage lockers investigated during production contain nothing of interest and therefore do not appear in the final show. However, Beers admitted that half of the lines are scripted, and so is moving items between storage lockers purchased by the same person.\nLawsuits\nIn December 2012, a main auction buyer, Dave Hester, filed a lawsuit against A&E and Original Productions, claiming that the producers staged entire units, planted items in lockers after having them appraised weeks in advance, and funneled cash to weaker teams to buy lockers that they could not have otherwise afforded. The suit claims that Hester and other cast members met with network officials to express concerns that those actions violated federal laws that are intended to prevent viewers from being deceived when watching a show involving intellectual skills.\nIn January 2013, rather than deny the accusations, A&E responded by stating that its composition of the show is covered by the First Amendment and that Hester's claims do not apply; the network also said that the Communications Act of 1934 is inapplicable to cable television, which did not exist in 1934, and that the TV format of Storage Wars involves no \"chance\", \"intellectual knowledge\", or \"intellectual skill\" and so is not a game show. A&E also stated that there are \"notable inconsistencies in [Hester's] exaggerated self-portrait\", referring to his claims of value on the items that he finds in lockers.\nIn March 2013, A&E won a partial victory in the suit when a federal judge tossed out Hester's claim of unfair business practices, calling the show \"expressive free speech\", and stating that his claim of wrongful termination was not specific enough. Hester was ordered to pay the legal fees for A&E.\nOn September 3, 2013, Hester had one of his claims approved by Los Angeles Superior Court judge Michael Johnson. The court ruled that Hester \"can move forward with the wrongful termination portion of his wide-ranging lawsuit against A&E and the producers of Storage Wars.\"\nOn July 15, 2014, it was announced that Hester and A&E came to a settlement, setting the stage for his return to the show on August 12, 2014.\nSee also\n* Auction Kings (Discovery Channel; 2010–13)\n* Auction Hunters (Spike; 2010–15)\n* Storage Hunters (TruTV; 2011–16)\n* Baggage Battles (Travel Channel; 2012–16)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  at A&E\n*"
