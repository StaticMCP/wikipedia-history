Raghunathrao had established an alliance with Nizam Ali Khan of Hyderabad.\nWhen conflict arose between Raghunathrao and Madhavrao I, a joint campaign by Nizam Ali Khan and Raghunathrao resulted in Madhavrao I being heavily defeated.  Madhavrao I surrendered on 12 November 1762. Nizam Ali Khan got all of his territories lost at the Battle of Udgir. Madhavrao I submitted to his uncle, Raghunathrao.\nReferences"
