      "text": "# Louis Legendre (historian)\n\nLouis Legendre (; 1655–1733), was a French historian.\nBorn at Rouen (Normandy) to poor parents, Legendre owed the benefit of an education to François de Harlay de Champvallon, the archbishop of his native city, whom he followed to Paris, where he received a canonical at Notre Dame. He then went on to become abbot of Clairfontaine.\nLegendre's style has been described as elegant, correct, and his criticism judicious and impartial. The facts he recounts are always backed up by convincing evidence. While not a first rank historian, Legendre nonetheless offers information of interest.\nLegendre was the first benefactor of the Académie des Sciences, Belles-Lettres et Arts de Rouen. He also founded the competitive examination prize for the Paris colleges.\nSources\n*\n*\n*"
