He was known primarily as a scriptwriter for a series of 1950s Walt Disney films.\nLife\nWatkin was born in Camden (town), New York in 1901. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Syracuse University in 1924 and a master’s degree from Harvard in 1925. From 1926 until he entered the Navy in 1942, he was a member of Washington and Lee University's English Department in Lexington, Virginia.  He died in 1981, a few days after his 80th birthday, in San Joaquin County, California.\nWriter\nWatkin's first novel, On Borrowed Time, published in 1937 while an English professor at Washington and Lee, remains his best-known work. It won the National Book Award as Bookseller Discovery of 1937, voted by members of the American Booksellers Association.\n\"Booksellers Give Prize to 'Citadel': Cronin's Work About Doctors Their Favorite--'Mme. Curie' Gets Non-Fiction Award ...\", The New York Times, March 2, 1938, page 14. ProQuest Historical Newspapers The New York Times (1851-2007).\nIt was dramatized in 1938 by Paul Osborn for a successful run on Broadway. A Hollywood film version with Lionel Barrymore and Sir Cedric Hardwicke followed in 1939.\nHis next novel, Geese in the Forum (1940), was an allegory about university structures.\nIn 1947 Walt Disney hired Watkin to adapt the stories of Herminie Templeton Kavanagh featuring Darby O'Gill.  The project was finally realized in 1959 as ''Darby O'Gill and the Little People. By that time, Watkin had written numerous other screenplays for Disney.  The first of his Disney screenplays was Treasure Island (1950), adapted from the Robert Louis Stevenson novel.  Three screenplays followed (Beaver Valley, The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men, and The Sword and the Rose), which were produced by Disney in Great Britain. The popular Disney television serials Spin and Marty''  (1955&ndash;1957) were adapted by Jackson Gillis from Watkin's 1942 book Marty Markham. Watkin was producer of Disney's 1956 Adventure film,  The Great Locomotive Chase.\nIn the late 1960s Watkin was hired by the Disney Studio to do a biography of Walt Disney after the first effort by Richard G. Hubler was judged unsatisfactory. Watkin's effort was also deemed unsuitable; he told friends the biography was \"ill-fated\" because it was \"too truthful\". Disney historian Wade Sampson, after reading the unpublished manuscript, dubbed it \"achingly boring, with only occasional insights into the life and genius of Walt Disney and merely listing the Disney productions rather than the stories behind those productions.\"\nWorks\nNovels\n* On Borrowed Time, New York and London 1937\n* Geese in the Forum, New York and London 1940\n* Thomas Jones and His Nine Lives, New York 1941\n* Gentleman from England, New York 1941\n* Marty Markham, New York 1942 .
