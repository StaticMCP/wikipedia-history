In the , Upper Kedron had a population of 5,800 people.\nGeography\nUpper Kedron is located  north-west of the Brisbane CBD. Upper Kedron is a residential suburb on the edge of the Brisbane Forest Park.\nThe suburb contains the headwaters of the two tributaries of Kedron Brook, namely Kedron Creek and Cedar Creek. Despite the similarity of their names, the Brisbane suburbs of Upper Kedron and Kedron are  apart.\nHistory\nUpper Kedron Hall () opened on Cedar Creek Road in 1890.\nThe Cedar Creek Cemetery () opened on Cemetery Road in 1898.\nIn 2014, Cedar Woods Properties purchased a  parcel of land remaining within Upper Kedron for $68 million. Cedar Woods received council approval to develop this into a 900-lot master planned residential community.\nDemographics\nIn the , Upper Kedron had a population of 3,432 people, 50.1% female and 49.9% male. The median age of the Upper Kedron population was 31 years, 6 years below the Australian median. 81.3% of people living in Upper Kedron were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 69.8%; the next most common countries of birth were England 5.5%, New Zealand 3%, Scotland 0.6%, South Africa 0.6%, Iran 0.4%. 92.5% of people spoke only English at home; the next most common languages were 0.7% Persian (excluding Dari), 0.4% Italian, 0.3% Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, 0.3% Dutch, 0.3% Sinhalese.\nIn the , Upper Kedron had a population of 4,180 people.\nIn the , Upper Kedron had a population of 5,800 people.\nDevelopment\nCedar Woods lodged a Development Application with Brisbane City Council over the Suburb's remaining undeveloped land within the South East Queensland Urban Footprint, noting the council's zones as being inconsistent with the South East Queensland Regional Plan. The development proposes to use an existing road reserve which runs through the property to connect with Mount Nebo Road, and ultimately Waterworks Road.\nThe proposed 227 hectare development includes 91 hectares of open space and up to 980 individual lots to be developed over a period of ten years. The works to develop the site are estimated to cost $900 million, and will generate up to 550 direct jobs.\nThe proposed development responds to the site's topography by offering a range of living options, ranging from bush blocks, to lots designed for terrace-style dwellings.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Upper Kedron. The nearest primary and secondary schools are in neighbouring Ferny Grove.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.ourbrisbane.com/living/suburbs/upper_kedron/home/ ourbrisbane.com website, Upper Kedron section]\n* [http://www.upperkedronestate.com.au Upper Kedron Estate pre-development website]\n* [http://www.chapelhill.homeip.net/FamilyHistory/Photos/Cedar-Creek-cemetery-Ferny-Grove-Brisbane/ Cedar Creek cemetery at Upper Kedron]"
