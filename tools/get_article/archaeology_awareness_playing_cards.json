The goal of the publication of the cards was two-fold according to Fort Drum archaeologist Laurie Rush - to prevent unnecessary damage to ancient sites and to stem the illegal trade of artifacts in Iraq. The military has long recognized that educational playing cards are a good way to capitalize on the time soldiers spend waiting for orders.\nThey were devised following the success of the most-wanted Iraqi playing cards (officially called \"personality identification playing cards\") that were used in the 2003 invasion of Iraq to help members of the U.S. military identify wanted personnel from the Baathist regime. Approximately 40,000 sets of the cards were issued to U.S. forces. In the archaeology deck, each suit has a theme: diamonds for artifacts, spades for digs, hearts for \"winning hearts and minds,\" and clubs for heritage preservation.\nAbout the cards\nSpades\n*  \"Ancient walls of mud brick are easily damaged.\"\n*  \"Many DoD sites in the US have protected archaeological sites.
