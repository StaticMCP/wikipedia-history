It is currently held by Ambassador Joseph Yun.\nHistory\nThe three strategically important Pacific nations have been affiliated with the United States since the U.N. made them part of the U.S.-governed Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands in 1947. They achieved full sovereignty in 1986, when the U.S. Congress ratified the COFA, providing the FAS with economic benefits and visa-free entry to any U.S. jurisdiction in exchange for full international defense authority and responsibilities.  The initial terms for economic assistance provisions ran to 2003, followed by an amended agreement guaranteeing financial assistance through 2023.\nNegotiations to extend the compacts became stalled in December 2020. In February 2022 the Republic of the Marshall Islands' Ambassador to the United States, Gerald Zackios, attributed the impasse to Washington's failure to appoint a negotiator empowered by the president to discuss key issues beyond economic assistance, including remuneration for the legacy of nuclear testing on the islands, the continuing presence of U.S. military bases and the ballistic missile test site at Kwajalein Atoll and climate-change mitigation. Citing \"the critical nature of these complex negotiations,\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the creation of the position of Special Presidential Envoy for Compact Negotiations on March 22, 2022, President Biden named Ambassador Yun to be the inaugural envoy.\nAfter 18 months of negotiations with the Compact states, led by Ambassador Yun, and with the bipartisan support of the US Congress, on March 8, 2024, the renewed Compacts of Free Association (COFA) were officially signed into law as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act.\nReferences"
