His brother Ryan Warsofsky is the NHL ice hockey head coach for the San Jose Sharks.\nHe played at Marshfield High School in 2004–05 and at Cushing Academy in Ashburnham, Massachusetts for the following two years. He was named the 2007 U.S. Hockey Report's Prep Defenseman of the Year. Warsofsky was captain of the 2007–08 Under-18 United States men's national ice hockey team, where he tied as leader in assists and was second in points. The team won a bronze medal at the 2008 IIHF World U18 Championship.\nPlaying career\n.]]\nWarsofsky was selected by the St. Louis Blues in the 4th round (95th overall) of the 2008 NHL Entry Draft. Instead of turning pro immediately, he played for Boston University in the Hockey East and was a member of the 2009 national championship team as a freshman. He played for Team USA in 2010, winning the World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.\nOn June 26, 2010, the Blues traded Warsofsky's rights to the Boston Bruins in exchange for Vladimír Sobotka. He then played four consecutive seasons solely for the Bruins' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Providence Bruins.\nOn December 18, 2013, the Bruins recalled Warsofsky from Providence. He is the first Bruin to wear the number 79. He made his NHL debut the following night in a 4–2 loss to the Buffalo Sabres. On December 28, Warsofsky scored his first career NHL goal in a 4–3 loss to the Ottawa Senators. He finished the season with two points in six games for Boston, as well as 32 in 56 with Providence.\nOn July 1, 2015, Warsofsky signed a one-year, two-way contract with the Pittsburgh Penguins. He skated in 12 games for the Penguins during the 2015–16 season, recording one goal. On February 26, 2016, the New Jersey Devils claimed Warsofsky off waivers. He finished the season with one assist in ten games for the Devils.\nOn July 1, 2016, Warsofsky returned to the Penguins, signing a one-year, two-way contract. He spent the majority of the 2016–17 season with Wilkes-Barre, where he led all team defensemen with 47 points in 58 contests, all career-highs. He also skated in seven games with Pittsburgh, recording one assist.\nOn July 1, 2017, Warsofsky signed a two-year contract with the Colorado Avalanche. Aside from a 16-game stint with the Avalanche in the 2017–18 season, he primarily played for the team's affiliates, the San Antonio Rampage and the Colorado Eagles.\nOn July 1, 2019, Warsofsky returned to the Penguins for a second time, signing a two-year, two-way contract. He was named captain of Wilkes-Barre/Scranton, and led the defense with 33 points in 51 games.\nOn August 25, 2020, Warsofsky was traded by the Penguins to the Toronto Maple Leafs along with Evan Rodrigues, Filip Hallander, and the 15th overall pick in the 2020 NHL Entry Draft in exchange for Kasperi Kapanen, Jesper Lindgren and Pontus Aberg.\nOn February 15, 2021, Warsofsky was traded to the Carolina Hurricanes along with Yegor Korshkov in exchange for Alex Galchenyuk. In the 2020–21 season, the Hurricanes assigned Warsofsky to join AHL affiliate, the Chicago Wolves, to be coached by his brother Ryan. Limited to 22 regular season games, he produced 17 assists and 19 points.\nA free agent from the Hurricanes, Warsofsky left North America by signing his first contract abroad, agreeing to a one-year contract with German club ERC Ingolstadt of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL) on June 18, 2021.\nFront Office and Coaching\nDuring the 2024-25 ECHL season, Warsofsky served as a special advisor to Jared Nightingale at the ECHL's South Carolina Stingrays, which had previously hired his brother in his first head coaching gig.  After Nightingale left to join an AHL club, on June 23, 2025, David Warsofsky was named the club's thirteenth head coach and Director of Hockey Operations, the same position his brother had held with the Stingrays from 2016 to 2018.\nCareer statistics\nRegular season and playoffs\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" |\n! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" |\n! colspan=\"5\" | Regular season\n! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" |\n! colspan=\"5\" | Playoffs\n|- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n!
