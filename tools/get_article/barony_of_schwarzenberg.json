It continued to exist following its acquisition by John Frederick the Magnanimous in 1533 as an administrative unit of the Electorate of Saxony under the name of Amt Schwarzenberg and acted as the regional focal point, until the end of the Saxon Amt constitution, for the collection of baronial contributions and coordination of socage, for law and order and military service.\nGeography\nThe barony was bordered by the Vogtland region to the east, and extended south into the forests on the ridge of the Western Ore Mountains from the Auersberg mountain to the Fichtelberg, and was bounded by the rivers Schwarzwasser, Pöhlwasser and Große Mittweida. To the south, it was bounded by the watershed. The centre of the territory was the Fort of Schwarzenberg, first mentioned in 1212 as a castrum.\nSources\n* Walter Fröbe: Herrschaft und Stadt Schwarzenberg bis zum 16.
