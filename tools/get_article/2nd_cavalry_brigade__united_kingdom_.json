It served in the Napoleonic Wars (2nd Union Cavalry Brigade), the Boer War and in the First World War when it was assigned to the 1st Cavalry Division.\nPrior to World War I the brigade was based at Tidworth Camp in England; and originally consisted of three cavalry regiments and a Royal Engineers signal troop. After the declaration of war in August 1914, the brigade was deployed to the Western Front in France, where an artillery battery joined the brigade the following September and a Machine Gun Squadron in February 1916.\nHistory\nNapoleonic Wars\nof the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at Waterloo in 1815.]]\nFrom June 1809, Wellington organized his cavalry into one, later two, cavalry divisions (1st and 2nd) for the Peninsular War.  These performed a purely administrative, rather than tactical, role; the normal tactical headquarters were provided by brigades commanding two, later usually three, regiments.  The cavalry brigades were named for the commanding officer, rather than numbered.  De Grey's Brigade was broken up 29 January 1812.  On 20 May 1813, Fane took over Slade's Brigade; the second Fane's Brigade was unrelated to the original one although coincidentally, and to add to the potential confusion, the 3rd Dragoon Guards served in both.}}  For the Hundred Days Campaign, he numbered his British cavalry brigades in a single sequence, 1st to 7th.}}  The 2nd Cavalry Brigade consisted of:\n*1st (Royal) Regiment of Dragoons\n*2nd Regiment of Dragoons (Royal Scots Greys)\n*6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons\nAs the brigade consisted of regiments from England (1st Dragoons), Scotland (2nd Dragoons) and Ireland (6th Dragoons), it was known as the 2nd (Union) Cavalry Brigade.\nBoer War\nThe brigade was reformed for the Boer War.  During the Battle of Paardeberg, the brigade commanded:\n*6th Dragoon Guards (Carabiners)\n*2nd Dragoons (Royal Scots Greys)\n*6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons\n*New Zealanders\n*Australians\n*G and P Batteries, Royal Horse Artillery\nWorld War I\n*4th (Royal Irish) Dragoon Guards\n*9th (Queen’s Royal) Lancers\n*18th (Queen Mary’s Own) Hussars\n*2nd Signal Troop, Royal Engineers\n*H Battery, Royal Horse Artillery from 28 September 1914\n*2nd Cavalry Brigade Machine Gun Squadron Machine Gun Corps\nCommanders\nThe commanders of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade during the First World War were:\n*Brigadier-General H. de B. de Lisle (At mobilization)\n*Brigadier-General R.
