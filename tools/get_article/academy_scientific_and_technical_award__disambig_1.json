The Awards have been presented since the 4th Academy Awards in November 1931, to recognize original developments resulting in significant improvements in motion picture production and exhibition. The Awards are presented at a formal dinner ceremony a couple weeks before the principal Academy Awards ceremony. The 2025 awards will take place April 29, two months after the 97th Academy Awards.\nThese awards recognize significant milestones in the development of technology for motion pictures and are conferred by vote of the Academy Board of Governors.  Potential nominations for awards are investigated by a special committee within the Academy, \"The Scientific and Technical Awards Committee\", which presents a written report and recommendation to the Board of Governors.\nAdditionally, the John A. Bonner Medal of Commendation, given for \"outstanding service and dedication in upholding the high standards of the Academy\", and the Gordon E. Sawyer Award, both also considered Honorary Awards, are usually also chosen by the Scientific and Technical Awards Committee and conferred at this annual presentation dinner ceremony.\nThree kinds of Scientific and Technical Awards\nInnovations in motion pictures technology are recognized with the following awards:\n# Academy Award of Merit – an Academy statuette (an Oscar);\n# Scientific and Engineering Award – an Academy bronze tablet; and\n# Technical Achievement Award – an Academy certificate.\nAward of Merit\nFrom the 4th Academy Awards in 1931 through the 50th Academy Awards in 1978 the award was originally called the \"Class I Scientific and Technical Award.\" The award is non-competitive. Winners receive an Oscar statuette. ,  50 achievements have been recognized with an Award of Merit.\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+Sci-Tech Award of Merit Recipients\n!Year\n!Recipient(s)\n|-\n|1930/1931 (4th)\n|\n* To Electrical Research Products, Inc., RCA-Photophone, Inc., and RKO Radio Pictures, Inc., for noise reduction recording equipment\n* To Dupont Film Manufacturing Corp., and Eastman Kodak Company for super-sensitive panchromatic film\n|-\n|1936 (9th)\n|\n* To Douglas Shearer and the MGM Studio Sound Department \"for the development of a practical two-way horn system and a biased Class A push-pull recording system\"\n|-\n|1937 (10th)\n|\n* To Agfa Ansco Corporation for Agfa Supreme and Agfa Ultra Speed pan motion picture negatives\n|-\n|1940 (13th)\n|\n* To 20th Century-Fox Film Corp. for the design and construction of the 20th Century Silenced Camera, developed by Daniel Clark, Grover Laube, Charles Miller, and Robert W.
