It elected three councillors and was part of the city’s internal divisions until the reorganisation of wards in 1895.\nOverview\nPitt Street ward was established on 1 November 1835, when Liverpool was first divided into 16 wards. It participated in Liverpool City Council elections during the 19th century. On 31 October 1895, the original set of wards were reorganised, and many were abolished or restructured. Pitt Street was one of those that ceased to exist in its original form at that time.\nPitt Street ward covered the area around Pitt Street in Central Liverpool, which includes what was once a dense urban area close to the docks. The area had a mixed population, including immigrant communities, boarding houses, and shops. Over time, the street and surrounding neighbourhood became known for poorer housing and overcrowding. The living conditions were reported in various 19th- and early-20th-century sources to be quite difficult.\nPitt Street is historically linked with Liverpool’s Chinese community. Many Chinese-run boarding houses, laundries, restaurants, etc., were located around Pitt Street. It was one of the focal areas for Chinatown early on. There was a Pitt Street Wesleyan Chapel, one of the older Methodist chapels in Liverpool, which was rebuilt and served the area; it was part of the South Circuit of chapels.\nElections\n1835\nPolling place : At two compartments in the South Free School in Park-lane.\n1836\n1837\n1838\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Time\n! colspan=\"2\" | Hugh Hornby\n! colspan=\"2\" | Thomas Toulmin\n|-\n!
