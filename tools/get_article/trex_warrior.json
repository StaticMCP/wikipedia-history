The player is a contestant named Riano Bolar, who must fight off various types of droids, including speeders and missile-launching \"Wasps\". Different kind pads can be driven over: jump pads, shield pads which replenish the droid's shields, star pads which cause damage to the droid. Static objects can be blown up to take out nearby opponent droids. At the end of each survived day, credits are earned that can be spent on new weaponry.\n| TILT = 16/20 (Amiga)17/20 (ST)\n| rev1 = '\n| rev1Score = 78% (Amiga)\n| rev2 = '\n| rev2Score = 74% (Amiga)\n}}\nAktueller Software Markt gave a positive review and praised the fast graphics, music, and the opening credits sequence.
