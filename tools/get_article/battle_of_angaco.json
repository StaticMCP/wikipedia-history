He returned towards the city at top speed.\nHis force spent the night in a place called the paddocks of Daniel Marcó, in the Albardón Department, bordering Angaco.\nGeneral Acha, knowing that Benavídez had returned with his column,\nleft the city and went north to meet it with a small group of Unitarian reinforcements from San Juan.\nOn the morning of 15 August 1841 the Unitarian vanguard, the Brizuela Battalion led by Juan Crisóstomo Álvarez, spotted the federal camp,\nwhich was at the ranch with horses unsaddled. It was a surprise for both armies, who did not expect to meet so soon or at that place.\nAlvarez immediately gave the order to attack. The battle lasted two hours.  Benavídez's troops, who were tired, hungry and short of sleep, were defeated.\nAlthough it was a triumph, the Unitarians only managed to disperse their enemies, not to defeat them.\nShortly after the end of the battle they saw the thick dust of the Federal Army of the West, with its commander José Félix Aldao,\nwho entered the ravine between the Pie de Palo and Sierra de Villicum.\nDevelopment of the battle\nOrder of battle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

After two hours of fighting, in which half of his men were killed, he had to retire.\nAldao, aware of the situation, did nothing to help. One of the first to fall, with a bullet in the head, was Colonel José Manuel Espinoza, head of the Cazadores battalion of San Juan.\nHe was replaced in the field by Colonel Francisco Domingo Díaz, who would twice become governor of San Juan.\nAldao ordered the infantry to charge the center of the Unitarian line, with cavalry flanking both sides. Acha's artillery, superior to the federal, destroyed the infantry.\nThe bodies filled the ditch from side to side. The federal cavalry attacked the Unitarian line,\nbut a quick movement of the two squadrons of Unitarian cavalry repulsed the attack and forced it back.\nAldao then ordered his cavalry to attack the flanks, where the Unitarian guns caused great destruction and forced it to retire for the second time.\nDuring the confusion of the cavalry attack, Aldao wanted to exploit the situation and ordered Francisco Díaz to advance at the trot towards the line of enemy artillery and infantry.\nThe Unitarian guns fired point blank at Díaz's troops, who closed in hand-to-hand combat with bayonets and sabers.\nMeanwhile, Acha moved up and down the infantry line, giving them support wherever they were weak.\nThe Federal cavalry was defeated by the Unitarian cavalry and as a result the infantry had to retreat with heavy losses.\nThe battle was stopped around two in the afternoon, after six hours of fighting.\nWhile waiting for a new federal onslaught, Acha ordered his infantry to take position within the ditch, using it as a trench.\nAldao, furious at being unable to win despite great numerical superiority,\nquickly reformed the two infantry battalions and ordered a new attack, without giving time for the cavalry, which was dispersed, to rearm.\nThe infantry locked in bloody combat with heavy casualties.\nWhen the Federal cavalry managed to join the battle it was defeated once again by the Unitarians, with Crisóstomo Álvarez at its head.\nDespite being wounded, he led his troops and pursued the federal cavalry, which retreated for the third time.\nAldao ordered a new maneuver, with commander Rodríguez to attack with cavalry from the rear, but the Unitarians had been warned and shot at close range.\nRodríguez was among those killed.\nAcha moved along his line, haranguing his troops to raise their courage.  He told them the enemy would kill any prisoners, so they should die fighting if need be.\nAldao, overcome by despair, personally led the remnants of his infantry and advanced to the ditch, where his men threw themselves flat on the ground,\nfiring intensely at a range of .\nThe federal cavalry returned to the attack, and again the cavalry of Crisóstomo Álvarez repelled their attacks and put them to flight.\nGiving chase, when the Unitarian cavalry reached the road it turned sharply and charged the Federalist infantry.\nMajor N. Barrera, in front of the Federal Infantry, gave battle until only 44 of his men survived, who laid down their arms.\nWith the infantry lost, the rest of the Federal army fled to the interior of San Juan Province. It was about 17:00. Meanwhile, Benavídez went to the city of San Juan, where he gathered 400 men, pretending to have triumphed. When Acha advanced towards the city, Benavídez fled to La Rinconada.\nThe Federal army lost over a thousand men, most of their baggage, and lost 157 infantry as prisoners.\nThe Unitarians lost more than 170 men. Both sides left many of their officers in the battlefield.\nAftermath\nThe Unitarian victory was short-lived.\nA few days later at the Battle of La Chacarilla, Nazario Benavidez defeated the Unitarian fighters who had survived Angaco,\nrecovered the city of San Juan and captured General Acha, who would be executed shortly afterwards.\nGeneral Lamadrid continued his slow advance towards the cities of San Juan and then Mendoza, which he held in turn.\nPersecuted first by Benavidez and then by General Angel Pacheco, he was finally defeated in the Battle of Rodeo del Medio,\nwhich ended Unitarian resistance for a decade.\nRelations between Aldao and Benavidez were soured by the defeat.\nThis was aggravated because Benavidez was named Chief of the Federal Army of the West soon after, and won military prestige despite the defeat.\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\n* |url=http://www.legionunitaria.granaderos.com.ar/batallas/angaco.htm  |work=Granaderos.com\n|title=Angaco}}\n*\n*\n*\n* |url=http://www.revisionistas.com.ar/?p=3019  |work=Revisionistas\n|title=Nazario Benavídez}}\n*\n*"
