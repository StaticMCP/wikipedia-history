It was released on Big Dada in 2003. It peaked at number 35 on the UK Independent Albums Chart. The album was nominated for the 2004 Mercury Prize.\nCritical reception\nJon Dolan of Spin said, \"Ty is most reminiscent of robo-voiced Brit MCs like Roots Manuva, and his turtleneck-rocking look suggests a dude too arty to party, but his mix of neo-soul warmth, skip-rope beats, and clever rhymes smoothes out his raggafied rough edges.\"\nTrack listing\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n!scope=\"col\"| Chart\n!scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| UK Independent Albums (OCC)\n| 35\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
