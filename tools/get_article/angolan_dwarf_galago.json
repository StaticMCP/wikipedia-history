Though 36 individuals of the Angolan dwarf galago were identified in September 2013, it was declared as a new species in 2017, and is now the nineteenth species of galago to be identified. Its call, described as \"A loud chirping crescendo of longer notes, followed by a fading twitter\", was enough to separate it as a new species, without any genetic identification, due to its uniqueness.\nIt is by far the largest of its family, with a head-body length of  and a tail length of . It is greyish brown in colour and has a darker tail.\nThough the species' status in the wild has not been formally identified, it is likely endangered due to large amounts of deforestation around its habitat area.\nReferences"
