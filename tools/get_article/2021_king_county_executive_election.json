Incumbent County Executive Dow Constantine ran for re-election to a fourth term. He was challenged by four opponents, the most well-known of whom was State Senator Joe Nguyen. In the nonpartisan primary, Constantine placed first with 52 percent of the vote and advanced to the general election against Nguyen, who won 33 percent. In the closest race that Constantine faced, he defeated Nguyen to win his final term as County Executive, 55–44 percent. Ultimately, Constantine would not serve out his full fourth term, and resigned in 2025 to become the CEO of Sound Transit.\nPrimary election\nCandidates\n* Dow Constantine, incumbent County Executive\n* Joe Nguyen, State Senator\n* Bill Hirt, retired engineer, 2017 candidate for County Executive\n* Goodspaceguy, perennial candidate\n* Johnathon Cranes, security guard\n}}\nGeneral election\nResults\n}}\nReferences"
