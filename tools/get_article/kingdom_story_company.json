It was founded on March 26, 2019 by the Erwin Brothers (Jon and Andrew Erwin), Kevin Downes, and Tony Young and has operations in Nashville, Tennessee, and Los Angeles, California.\nHistory\nKingdom was funded by profits from the Erwins' film I Can Only Imagine, which was released in early 2018 by Lionsgate, grossing more than $83 million at the domestic box office on a $7 million budget. Subsequent negotiations with Lionsgate culminated in a multi-year deal in which it was agreed that the Erwin Brothers and Kevin Downes would create faith-based feature films and television programming for the company. Lionsgate Motion Picture Group Chairman, Joe Drake, and Television Group Chairman, Kevin Beggs announced the agreement on August 9, 2018.\nKingdom Story Company was announced to have been launched on March 26, 2019, at the National Religious Broadcasters convention in Anaheim, California.\nI Still Believe, Kingdom's first film project, began filming in the spring of 2019 and was released on March 13, 2020.\nIn September 2019, it was announced that Kingdom would be launching a television division, headed by The Big Bang Theory producer Mona Garcea.\nAfter Kingdom acquired the film rights to NFL quarterback Kurt Warner's life story, interviews, and memoir, American Underdog: The Kurt Warner Story was announced in February 2020, and released on December 25, 2021. Most recently, the company had renewed its first-look deal with Lionsgate.\nFilmography\nKingdom Story Company intends to produce two faith-based films per year, and has of yet revealed four productions, each one slated for a prospective 2020 or 2021 wide release by Lionsgate. Each of the films were unveiled at the National Religious Broadcasters convention at Anaheim, California  in March 2019. I Still Believe, based on Jeremy Camp's life during his first wife's cancer battle, was Kingdom's first film to be theatrically released. The other films announced are Apostles: Resurrection of Christ, which is to be the first in a trilogy based on the New Testament, Jesus Revolution, which is based on the events surrounding the Jesus Movement, and The Drummer Boy, which will be produced in cooperation with Christian music group For King and Country. American Underdog is a sports drama biopic based on the life of Kurt Warner.\nFilms\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Film\n! scope=\"col\"| Director(s)\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10%;\"| Prospective year of release\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10%; text-align:center;\"| References\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|I Still Believe\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"3\"| Erwin brothers\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2020\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"1\"|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| The Jesus Music\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\" | 2021\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| American Underdog\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"1\"|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| Jesus Revolution\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| Jon Erwin & Brent McCorkle\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2023\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| Ordinary Angels\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| Jon Gunn\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"4\"| 2024\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| Unsung Hero\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| Joel Smallbone and Richard Ramsey\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| White Bird\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| Marc Forster\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| The Best Christmas Pageant Ever\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| Dallas Jenkins\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| The Unbreakable Boy\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| Jon Gunn\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"|2025\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''Sarah's Oil\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| Cyrus Nowrasteh\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| I Can Only Imagine 2\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| Andrew Erwin and Brent McCorkle\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2026\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | Apostles: Resurrection of Christ\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | Erwin Brothers\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | TBA\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | The Drummer Boy''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | Joel and Luke Smallbone\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | TBA\n|}\nSee also\n*Great American Pure Flix\n*Affirm Films\n*Fox Faith\n*Lightworkers Media\nExternal links\n*[https://www.kingdomstorycompany.com Website]\n*IMDB\nReferences"
