Treaty bodies are distinct from \"international organizations\" as such, like United Nations agencies, programs, or other sui generis international organizations.\nThere are a number of treaty bodies, in particular in relation with international human rights law. However, there are also treaty bodies related to non-human rights instruments such as the UPOV or the INCB. The mandates of treaty bodies is generally defined in the treaty that establishes them, and sometimes by General Assembly decisions or resolutions. Treaty bodies sometimes perform additional functions than the sole monitoring of treaty compliance.\nList of treaty bodies\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of treaty bodies (non-exhaustive)\n!Treaty body\n!Treaty\n!Date of creation\n!Headquarter\n|-\n|Committee Against Torture\n|United Nations Convention against Torture\n|1987\n|Geneva\n|-\n|Human Rights Committee (CCPR)\n|International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\n|1977\n|Geneva\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |International Narcotics Control Board (INCB)\n|1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs\n| rowspan=\"3\" |1968\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Vienna\n|-\n|1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances\n|-\n|1988 Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances\n|-\n|International Whaling Commission (IWC)\n|International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling\n|1946\n|Impington\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity\n|Convention on Biological Diversity\n| rowspan=\"3\" |1992\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Montreal\n|-\n|Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety\n|-\n|Nagoya Protocol on Fair Access and Benefit-Sharing\n|-\n|International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV)\n|International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants\n|1968\n|Geneva\n|-\n|International Seabed Authority (ISA)\n|United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\n|1994\n|Kingston\n|}\nSee also\n* International law\n* United Nations\n* Human rights treaty bodies\nReferences"
