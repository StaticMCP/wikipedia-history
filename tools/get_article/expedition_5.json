The crew, consisting of three people, remained in space for 184 days, 178 of which were spent aboard the ISS. Expedition 5 was a continuation of an uninterrupted human presence in space, as of November 2000, which was begun by Expedition 1 in 2000–2001.\nThe crew of Expedition 5 launched to space aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour aboard the STS-111 mission on 5 June 2002. Their tenure aboard the station, however, did not begin until they docked with the ISS two days later on 7 June.\nCrew\nValery Korzun\n| flights1_up       = Second and last\n| agency1_up        = RSA\n| position2         = Flight Engineer\n| crew2_up          =  Peggy Whitson\n| flights2_up       = First\n| agency2_up        = NASA\n| position3         = Flight Engineer\n| crew3_up          =  Sergei Treshchev\n| flights3_up       = Only\n| agency3_up        = RSA\n}}\nAleksandr Kaleri\n| agency1_up        = RSA\n| position2         = Flight Engineer\n| crew2_up          =  Scott J.

An official ceremony between expedition crews took place 10 June, with the ceremonial ringing of the station's brass bell, symbolizing the transfer of command. The Expedition Five crew carried out approximately 25 new investigations on board the ISS, as well as continued with various science investigations begun before their stay. The crew wrapped up a 184-day stay in space when they returned home on STS-113 7 December 2002.\nSpace Shuttle Endeavour delivered the Expedition 5 crew during mission STS-111, which launched 5 June 2002. The fifth crew to live aboard the International Space Station was led by Russian Valery Korzun and joined by fellow cosmonaut Sergey Treshchev and U.S. astronaut Peggy A. Whitson, both flight engineers. While on board, Dr. Whitson was named NASA's first ISS science officer by NASA administrator O'Keefe.\nSpacewalks\nThe Expedition Five crewmembers conducted two spacewalks during their stay at the International Space Station. Both were based out of the Pirs Docking Compartment and used Russian Orlan space suits.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"10%\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\"|Mission\n! width=\"20%\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\"|Spacewalkers\n! width=\"16%\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\"|Start (UTC)\n! width=\"16%\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\"|End (UTC)\n! width=\"12%\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\"|Duration\n|-\n|rowspan=2 style=\"border-bottom:2px solid grey;\"|Expedition 5EVA 1\n| Valery Korzun  Peggy Whitson\n| 16 August 2002  09:23\n| 16 August 2002  13:48\n| 4 hours, 25 minutes\n|-\n| colspan=4 style=\"border-bottom:2px solid grey;\"|Korzun and Whitson installed six debris panels onto the Zvezda Service Module. They removed the panels from their temporary location on the station's Pressurized Mating Adapter 1 prior to attachment to Zvezda. The panels are designed to shield Zvezda from potential space debris impacts. A total of 23 shields will eventually be installed onto the Service Module.\n|-\n|rowspan=2 style=\"border-bottom:2px solid grey;\"|Expedition 5EVA 2\n| Korzun  Sergei Treshchev\n| 26 August 2002  05:27\n| 26 August 2002  10:48\n| 5 hours, 21 minutes\n|-\n| colspan=4 style=\"border-bottom:2px solid grey;\"|During Expedition Five's second spacewalk, Korzun and Treshchev installed a frame on the outside of the Zarya Module to house components for future spacewalk assembly tasks. They installed new material samples on a pair of Japanese Space Agency materials exposure experiments housed on the outside of Zvezda. Korzun and Treshchev also installed devices on Zvezda that will simplify the routing of tethers during future assembly spacewalks. They improved future station amateur radio operations by adding two ham radio antennas on Zvezda. Also, Korzun and Treshchev installed the Kromka hardware that was originally slated to take place during Expedition Five's first spacewalk. Kromka measures residue emissions from ''Zvezda's'' jet thrusters.\n|}\nReferences\nNASA\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20020220030755/http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/station/crew-5/ndxpage1.html Expedition 5 Photography]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20020609064443/http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/crew/exp5/ ISS Expedition Five Crew (with mission overview)]"
