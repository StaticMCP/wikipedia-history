It promotes multi-disciplinary research into the history, art, literature and philology of the medieval Latin era.\nStructure\nSISMEL was founded by Claudio Leonardi in 1978, formally recognized in 1984 and was approved as a Superior Graduate School by the Ministero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali in 1997.\nIn December 2012 SISMEL inaugurated the premises of the new headquarters, in a portion of a historic building, built in 1873 and located in the center of Florence in Via Montebello n. 7, between the  Santa Maria Novella train station and the river Arno. All activities of SISMEL were transferred here in 2013 from the former Carthusian monastery of Certosa di Firenze, which was the first base of the Society.\nIn the same building of Via Montebello there is also the Ezio Franceschini Foundation, with which SISMEL has shared the premises of the Certosa for 25 years.\nPublishing\nThe Society runs the academic publishing house SISMEL-Edizioni del Galluzzo, specializing in editions of medieval literature and related subjects.
