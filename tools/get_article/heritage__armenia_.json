It was founded in 2002 by Raffi Hovannisian, independent Armenia's first Foreign Minister.\nIdeology\n*Liberal democracy is the party's principle ideology.\n;Economy\n*The party has stated its support for Economic liberalism.\n*Other domestic policy goals include legal reforms, the development of civil society and the economic development of Armenia. Heritage has stated that sustaining the competitiveness of the market will help strengthen the Armenian economy.\n*The party also believes that reducing poverty and building good social services should be prioritized. By taking these measures, Heritage has the objective to reduce emigration from Armenia and stop the \"brain drain\" from the country.\n*The party supports the establishment of a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area between Armenia and the EU.\n;Foreign Affairs\n*The party's foreign policy can be characterized as balanced, but also as pro-Western. The Heritage party underlines maintaining and developing good relations with the United States, Russia, Georgia, China and India, but sees European integration and cooperation as the key to progress. European integration is not a goal on its own, but rather a tool for improved well-being, prosperity and security. With Turkey, Heritage advocates an open and honest dialogue.\n*The party not only advocates for the integration of Armenia with Europe but also the eventual accession of Armenia into the European Union. Heritage firmly believes that for centuries Armenia has been one of the constituents of European civilization, regardless of the geographical boundaries drawn for Europe. The party believes that Armenia must adhere to Pan-European values and that Armenia can contribute to the enrichment of Europe's cultural heritage.\n*Some party members have advocated their support for the withdrawal of Armenia from the Collective Security Treaty Organization.\n*The party supports recognition of the Republic of Artsakh as an independent state (the party has several times unsuccessfully proposed bills in parliament that would formally recognize the Republic of Artsakh by Armenia).\n*Continued cooperation with both NATO and CIS member states.\nElectoral record\nThe party emerged as the fifth largest party in the National Assembly of Armenia after its debut in the 2007 Armenian parliamentary elections. It won 6% of the popular vote and obtained 7 seats.\nPrior to the 2012 parliamentary election, some Free Democrats party members decided to run under the Heritage list.
