The Legions became \"a founding myth for the creation of modern Poland\" in spite of their considerably short existence; they were replaced by the Polish Auxiliary Corps () formation on 20 September 1916, merged with Polish II Corps in Russia on 19 February 1918 for the Battle of Rarańcza against Austria-Hungary, and disbanded following the military defeat at the Battle of Kaniów in May 1918, against Imperial Germany. General Haller escaped to France to form the Polish army in the West against the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which granted Germany sovereignty over Polish territories.\nThe Legions took part in many battles against the forces of the Imperial Russia, both in Galicia and in the Carpathian Mountains. They suffered heavy casualties outnumbered three to one in the Battle of Łowczówek. They captured Kielce, and in 1915 took part in the offensive on Warsaw. In June 1916 the unit had approximately 25,000 soldiers. Both the number of troops and the composition of units changed rapidly. After the Battle of Kostiuchnówka where 2,000 Polish soldiers died delaying a Russian offensive, Józef Piłsudski demanded that the Central Powers issue a guarantee of independence for Poland and partially succeeded. The Polish Legions became the Polish Auxiliary Corps. After the Act of 5th November of 1916 which pronounced the creation of the puppet Kingdom of Poland of 1916–18, the Polish Legions were transferred under German command. However, most of the members refused to swear allegiance to the German Kaiser and were interned in Beniaminów and Szczypiorno (the Oath crisis). Approximately 3,000 of them were drafted into the Austro-Hungarian army and sent to the Italian Front while approximately 7,500 stayed in the  Polish Auxiliary Corps, part of the failed German Polnische Wehrmacht.\nHistory\nAccording to Prit Buttar, \"When war broke out, Piłsudski was quick to recognize that an important preliminary step in Poland's path to independence was the defeat of tsarist Russia... Piłsudski was no supporter of the Central Powers, and once Russia had been driven out of Polish territory, he believed that he and his fellow Poles would have to persuade the Germans and Austro-Hungarians to leave too, but he held secret meetings with representatives of France and Great Britain to make clear to the western members of the Entente that Polish troops would never fight against them, only against Russia.\"\nThe formation of the Legions was declared by Józef Piłsudski in his order of 22 August 1914. The Austrian government, having jurisdiction over the area, officially agreed to the formation on 27 August 1914.\nThe unit became an independent formation of the Austro-Hungarian Army thanks to the efforts of the KSSN and the Polish members of the Austrian parliament. Personnel came mostly from former members of various scouting organizations, including Drużyny Strzeleckie and Związek Strzelecki, as well from as volunteers from all around the Austro-Hungarian Empire. with his staff in front of the Governor's Palace in Kielce, 1914]]Initially, the Polish Legions were composed of two legions: the Eastern and the Western Legion, both formed on 27 August. After a Russian victory in the Battle of Galicia (August–September 1914) the Eastern Polish legion refused to fight on behalf of the Austro-Hungarian side against Russia and was disbanded on 21 September. On 19 December, the Western legion was transformed into three brigades: the I Brigade of the Polish Legions under Józef Piłsudski, formed in mid-December; the II Brigade of the Polish Legions under Józef Haller\nJózef Piłsudski and his officers, 1915]]\nde Hallenburg, formed between mid-December and March (sources vary); and the III Brigade of the Polish Legions under Zygmunt Zieliński (later Bolesław Roja), formed on 8 May 1915. All brigades had the following:\n* Artillery Battalions with served with I, II, and III Brigade\n* Cavalry Regiments: 1st served in I Brigade; 2nd served in II Brigade; 3rd served in III Brigade\n* Infantry Regiments: 1st, 5th, 7th served in I Brigade; 2nd, 3rd served in II Brigade; 4th served in both II and III Brigades; 5th, 6th served in III Brigade.\nThe commanders of the Legions were consecutively: Gen. Karol Trzaska-Durski (September 1914 – February 1916), Gen. Stanisław Puchalski (until November 1916), Col. Stanisław Szeptycki (until April 1917), and Col. Zygmunt Zieliński (until August 1917). After the war ended the officers of the Polish Legions became the backbone of the Polish Army.\nThe last march of the First Cadre Company, August 6th 1939\nIn independent Poland the Legions were celebrated as those who regained Poland's independence. Being a Legionnaire meant being part of a new elite by merit. Each year on August 6th the march of the First Cadre Company was commemorated in Kraków Oleandry Street. In the 1930s a building was built as a museum of the Legions. It stands until today. The last march of the original company took place on 6th of August 1939. After the toppling of communism these marches were revived.\nBattles\nBelow is a list of prominent Polish battles against the Imperial Russian Army in 191416, leading to victories in most cases, with notable exceptions especially during the Brusilov Offensive of 1916.\n* Battle of Nowy Korczyn (23–24 September 1914)\n* Battle of Laski and Anielin (21–26 October 1914)\n* Battle of Mołotków (29 October 1914)\n* Battle of Krzywopłoty (17–18 November 1914)\n* Battle of Marcinkowice (5–6 December 1914)\n* Battle of Łowczówek (22–25 December 1914)\n* Battle of Pustki (2 May 1915)\n* Battle of Konary (16–25 May 1915)\n* Battle of Rafajłowa (23–24 January 1915)\n* Kirlibaba (18–22 January 1915)\n* Rarańcza (13 June 1915)\n* Battle of Rokitna (15 June 1915)\n* Battle of Jastków (29 July – 31 July 1915)\n* Battle of Kostiuchnówka (4 July – 6 July 1916)\n* Battle of Rarańcza (15–16 February 1918)\nNotable officers who served in the Polish Legions\nFollowing the foundation of the Second Polish Republic, many served in the Polish Army, and held political as well as elected offices.\n{| width=\"98%\"\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*Tomasz Arciszewski\n*Leon Berbecki\n*Zygmunt Berling\n*Wacław Kostek - Biernacki\n*Władysław Bortnowski\n*Edmund Charaszkiewicz\n*Walerian Czuma\n*Bolesław Wieniawa-Długoszowski\n*Gustaw Orlicz-Dreszer\n*Wiktor Tomir Drymmer\n*Bolesław Bronisław Duch\n*Karol Durski-Trzaska\n*Kazimierz Fabrycy\n*Emil August Fieldorf\n*Stanisław Grzmot-Skotnicki\n*Tadeusz Rozwadowski\n*Michał Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski\n*Tadeusz Kasprzycki\n*Roman Kawecki\n*Zdzisław Kawecki\n*Franciszek Kleeberg\n*Tadeusz Klimecki\n*Bronisław Prugar-Ketling\n*Tadeusz Różycki-Kołodziejczyk\n*Alojzy Wir-Konas\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*Stefan Kossecki\n*Jan Kowalewski\n*Wincenty Kowalski\n*Marian Kukiel\n*Julian Kulski\n*Tadeusz Kurcyusz\n*Józef Kustroń\n*Ludwik de Laveaux (officer)\n*Mieczysław Mackiewicz\n*Kazimierz Mastalerz\n*Henryk Minkiewicz\n*Józef Dowbor-Muśnicki\n*Mieczyslaw Norwid-Neugebauer\n*Leopold Okulicki\n*Kazimierz Orlik-Łukoski\n*Wilhelm Orlik-Rückemann\n*Antoni Pająk\n*Witold Pilecki\n*Tadeusz Piskor\n*Władysław Belina-Prażmowski\n*Tadeusz Puszczyński\n*Bronisław Rakowski\n*Ludomił Rayski\n*Bolesław Roja\n*Juliusz Rómmel\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*Stanisław Grzmot-Skotnicki\n*Piotr Skuratowicz\n*Edward Rydz-Śmigły\n*Mieczysław Smorawiński\n*Kazimierz Sosnkowski\n*Mieczysław Boruta-Spiechowicz\n*Julian Stachiewicz\n*Wacław Stachiewicz\n*Kazimierz Stamirowski\n*Stefan Starzyński\n*Aleksander Stawarz\n*Zygmunt Bohusz-Szyszko\n*Wiktor Thommée\n*Władysław Wejtko\n*Bolesław Wieniawa-Długoszowski\n*Józef Olszyna-Wilczyński\n*Jan Włodarkiewicz\n*Włodzimierz Zagórski (general)\n*Józef Zając\n*Ferdynand Zarzycki\n*Marian Januszajtis-Żegota\n*Lucjan Żeligowski\n*Juliusz Zulauf\n*Michał Rola-Żymierski\n*Franciszek Owsiany\n|}\nPolish Legions' prominent members\nFile:Edward Rydz-Smigly.jpg|Edward Śmigły-Rydz\nFile:Narcyz Witczak-Witaczyński - Gen.
