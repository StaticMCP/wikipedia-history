Two years earlier, the Dominican Party of President Rafael Trujillo had been declared the only legally permitted party. However, the country had effectively been a one-party state since Trujillo assumed office in 1930.\nTrujillo was the only candidate in the presidential election and was elected unopposed, whilst the Dominican Party won every seat in the Congressional elections. There was also an election for a Constitutional Assembly, whose role was to amend certain articles of the constitution.\nResults\nReferences"
