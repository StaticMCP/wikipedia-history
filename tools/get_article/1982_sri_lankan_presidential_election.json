Jayewardene of the governing United National Party was re-elected, receiving 53% of all valid votes cast, defeating his main opponent Hector Kobbekaduwa of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.\nBackground\nAfter winning a landslide victory in the 1977 parliamentary elections, prime minister J. R. Jayawardene introduced the Executive Presidency through the 2nd Amendment to the Republican Constitution of 1972. Consequently, Prime minister J. R. Jayawardene was inaugurated as the 1st Executive President of Sri Lanka on 4 February 1978. As soon as he assumed office, Jayawardene introduced the 2nd Republican Constitution of 1978, which was in effect since 7 September 1978.\nUnder the Provisions of the 1978 Constitution, the president was elected to a six-year term. Since Jayawardene's first term commenced on 4 February 1978, Presidential elections were initially Scheduled between 4 December 1983, and 4 January 1984.\nHowever, Jayawardene passed the 3rd Amendment to the Constitution on 27 August 1982, paving the way for the President to call for an Early presidential election after completing four years of their first term. Since president Jayawardene's first four years of his first term has concluded on 4 February 1982, he decided to call an early presidential election and sought reelection for a second term.\nElectoral System\nThe President of Sri Lanka is elected through a system of limited ranked voting. Voters can express up to three ranked preferences for the presidency. If no candidate receives more than 50% of all valid votes in the first count, all candidates except the two who received the highest number of votes are eliminated. The second and third preference votes of the eliminated candidates are then redistributed to the remaining two candidates until one of them secures an outright majority.\nElection\nNominations were accepted from 8.00am to 11.00am IST on 17 September 1982, at the Election commission. The Notification for the Date of the election was issued by the Extraordinary Gazette No.211/2, on 20 September 1982.\nThe Election was held on 20 October 1982, and the voter turnout was 81.06%. The election was described as a fight between capitalism and socialism: Kobbekaduwa, who advocated to carry on the policies of the previous SLFP-led regime of Sirimavo Bandaranaike, was expected to undo most of the open market and capitalist reforms brought in by president Jayewardene.\nPredictably, in a Six horse-race, Jayawardene was given a clear mandate by the People of Sri Lanka for another term of Six years. He received 52.91% of the Votes, and as he received half of the valid votes, a run-off was not needed.\nThe 3rd Amendment stated that if a President was re-elected for a second term via an Early Presidential election, his second term starts on the next date corresponding to the beginning of his 1st term.\nJayawardene was inaugurated for a second term on 4 February 1983.\nResults\nBy district\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Districts won by Jayewardene\n|-\n|Districts won by Ponnambalam\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"font-size:100%; text-align:right;\"\n|+ Summary of the 1982 Sri Lankan presidential election by electoral district\n|-\n! valign=bottom rowspan=3|ElectoralDistrict !! valign=bottom rowspan=3|Province !! colspan=2|Jayewardene !! colspan=2|Kobbekaduwa !!colspan=2|Others  !! valign=bottom rowspan=3|TotalValid !! valign=bottom rowspan=3|Rejectedvotes !! valign=bottom rowspan=3|TotalPolled !! valign=bottom rowspan=3|RegisteredElectors !! valign=bottom rowspan=3|Turnout\n|-\n! colspan=2 style=\"background:\"| !! colspan=2 style=\"background:\"|  !! colspan=2|\n|-\n!
