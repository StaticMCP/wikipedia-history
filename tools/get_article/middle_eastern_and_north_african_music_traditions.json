The term folk music cannot be easily defined in a precise manner. It is used with widely varying definitions depending on the author, intended audience and context within a work. Similarly, the term traditions in this context does not connote any strictly defined criteria. Music scholars, journalists, audiences, record industry individuals, politicians, nationalists, and demagogues may often have occasion to address which fields of folk music are distinct traditions based along racial, geographic, linguistic, religious, tribal, or ethnic lines, and all such peoples will likely use different criteria to decide what constitutes a \"folk music tradition\". This list uses the same general categories used by mainstream, primarily English-language, scholarly sources, as determined by relevant statements of fact and the internal structure of works.\nThese traditions may coincide entirely, partially or not at all with geographic, political, linguistic, or cultural boundaries. Very few, if any, music scholars would claim that there are any folk music traditions that can be considered specific to a distinct group of people and with characteristics undiluted by contact with the music of other peoples; thus, the folk music traditions described herein overlap in varying degrees with each other.\nMiddle East and North Africa\nFile:Abderrahmane Abdelli.jpg|Algerian musician Abderrahmane Abdelli performing in Belgium\n| name = Dabkeدبكة\n| image = Palestinian girls dancing traditional Dabke.jpg\n| caption = Palestinian girls dancing traditional dabke\n| image size = 300px\n| medium = Circle dance and line dancing\n| types = Variations\n| ancestor =\n| culture = Levantine\n| era =\nFile:La fête de la musique au centre culturel dEgypte (Paris) (7416610718).jpg|Arabic music instrument Mizmar\nFile:Sintir player in Rabat, Morocco.JPG|A Moroccan instrument sintir or gimbri\nFile:2 dhols.jpg|Iranian instrument dohol\n|Styles           = medh – melhun – raï – zendani\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  = gasha – mandole - rabab - guellal\n|Other            = berrah – cheikha – meddhahates – mehna – wa'adat\n}}\n|Styles           = zajal\n|Dance            = fantasia\n|Instrumentation  = mijwis – mismar – yaghul\n|Other            =\n}}\n}}\n|Styles           = amarg – ammussu – astara – ritual music – tabbayt\n|Dance            = aberdag – ahidu – ahouach – ahwash\n|Instrumentation  = ajouag – bendir – ghaita – lotar (instrument) – nakous – ney – rabab – t'bel – tinde – viol\n|Other            = amydaz – imdyazn – laamt – rwai\n}}\n|Styles           = Saiyidi – sawahili – wedding music\n|Dance            = awalim\n|Instrumentation  = mismar saiyidi – nahrasan\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Styles           = Georgian polyphony – krimanchuli – naduri – orovela – table song\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  = accordion – changui – chonguri – chuniri – clarinet – duduk – panduri\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Styles           = Hausa\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  = Gummi – ganga (cylindrical drum, snared and double-membraned) – kakaki – darbuka – tapsnee – qloo – tambari (large, bowl-shaped drum) - goje - kalangu - Jaju umpho umpho (a flute)\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Styles           =\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  = daf – dohol – karnay – lute – ney – ney-anban – zurna\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Styles           = epic\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  = Bloor – daf – dhol – doozela – duduk – kamanche – ney – oud – santur – shimshal – tabalak – tar – tenbur – zil – zurna\n|Other            = chirokbej – dengbêj – stranbej\n}}\n|Styles           = Khaleeji music – sawt (music)-tarab-Adani-shela\n|Dance            = Ardha, dabkah|\n|Instrumentation  = duff – teeran – nay – oud – rababa – merwass – tabla – binges – qanun\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Styles           =\n|Dance            = dabkah\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n}}\n|Styles           = takht\n|Dance            = ait atta – ait Bodar – ait Bugemaz (ait bouguemaz) – taskiwin\n|Instrumentation  = aghanin – bendir – darbuka – duff – garagab – ghaita – gimbri – guedra – kamanjeh – kanum – nai – nakous – oud – rabab – taarija – tabl – tan-tan – tar\n|Other            = moussem\n}}\n|Styles           =\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  = duff\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Styles           = dalauna – meyjana – Zaghareet – wedding music-    Ataaba – Sahja – zajal\n|Dance            = dabka\n|Instrumentation  = duff – mijwiz – nay – oud – rababa – shababi – tabla – yarghoul-oud-qanun\n|Other            = zajaleen\n}}\n|Styles           = Afghan wedding music – kiliwali\n|Dance            = chub bazi – atan\n|Instrumentation  = daireh – dhol – rubab – tanbur\n|Other            = landai\n}}\n|Styles           = folk - acritic - call and response - parakathi\n|Dance            = Pontic Greek folk dance, including serra, dipat, atsiapat, omal, etc.\n|Instrumentation  = lyra - daouli - touloum - zourna - kemane - oud\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Styles           = cantica – copla – endechas – romance – Songs for Purim – wedding music\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  = accordion – darabouka – kanun – oud – tambourine\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Styles           = haqiiba\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  = oud – tambour\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Styles           =\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  = oud\n|Other            = ghat\n}}\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nThe Rough Guide to Music (various editions and volumes):\n* Chapters from Volume 2 of –  cited:\n**\n**\n* Chapters from Volume 1 of –  cited:\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.worldmusiccentral.org/staticpages/index.php/glossary \"International Dance Glossary\"] World Music Central"
