The duo, however, on occasion did record original songs and music by contemporary songwriters. Hawker continues to live in the small village of Tanner, West Virginia. Tracy Schwarz was a member of the New Lost City Ramblers and Strange Creek Singers.  The other members of the New Lost City Ramblers (Tom Paley’s former band) were John Cohen and Mike Seeger.  The other members in Strange Creek Singers (Mike and Tracy’s other band) were Alice Gerrard, Hazel Dickens, and Lamar Grier.\nTracy Schwarz died on March 29, 2025, at the age of 86.\nSelected discography\nGinny Hawker and Tracy Schwarz\n* Draw Closer (2004, Rounder)\n** with Ron Stewart, Peter Schwarz, and Kari Sickenberger\n** produced by Dirk Powell\n* Good Songs for Hard Times (2000, Copper Creek)\n** with Buddy Griffin, Jim Martin, and Peter Schwarz\nGinny Hawker\n* Letters from my Father, Ginny Hawker (2001 Rounder)\n** with Tim O'Brien, Darrell Scott, Ron Stewart, Dirk Powell, Dennis Crouch, and Kenny Malone\n* Bristol, A Tribute to the Carter Family, Ginny Hawker & Kay Justice (1999, Copper Creek/June Appal)\n** with Tracy Schwarz and Mike Seeger\n* Heart of a Singer, Hazel Dickens, Carol Elizabeth Jones, and Ginny Hawker (1998 Rounder)\n** with Ron Stewart, Pete Kennedy, Dudley Connell, Barry Mitterhoff, Marshall Wilborn, Bruce Molsky, and Lynn Morris.\n* Come All You Tenderhearted, Ginny Hawker & Kay Justice (1995, June Appal)\n* Signs & Wonders, Ginny Hawker & Kay Justice (June Appal)\n* Pathway to West Virginia, Ginny Hawker & Kay Justice (Pathway)\nTracy Schwarz\n* New Lost City Ramblers: 40 Years of Concert Recordings (2001 Rounder)\n* ''There Ain't No Way Out, The New Lost City Ramblers (1997 Smithsonian Folkways)\n* A Cajun Practice Music Tape, Tracy Schwarz\n* Mes Amis!, The Tracy Schwarz Cajun Trio (1996, Swallow)\n** with Matt Haney and Lee Blackwell\n* Feel Bad Sometime (1990 Marimac Recordings)\n* Louisiana And You (1991 Marimac Recordings)\n* Third Annual Farewell Reunion: Mike Seeger (with others) (1994, Rounder) - “Bound Steel Blues” (New Lost City Ramblers - Mike on banjo and vocals, John on guitar, and Tracy on fiddle)\n* The Tracy Schwarz Cajun Trio (1993, Swallow)\n* How to Play the Cajun Accordion, Marc Savoy and Tracy Schwarz\n* Strange Creek Singers: Strange Creek Singers (1972, Arhoolie)\n* 50 Years: Where Do You Come From?
