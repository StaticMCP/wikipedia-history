According to the 2001 census it had a population of 26.  The hamlet is located  from Mickleover,  from Willington and  south west of Derby.\nIn the Anglo-Saxon period, bears were first kept for the purposes of diversion or baiting.  The officer in charge was called the \"bearward\"; hence Bearwardcote points out his place of residence.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
