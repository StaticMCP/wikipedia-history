The sector gained momentum with the founding of the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) in 1956, which became the central regulatory authority. Over the decades, Nepal transitioned from a state-dominated banking model to a liberalized, competitive financial ecosystem.\nRegulatory Framework\nThe banking system is governed by the Nepal Rastra Bank Act, Bank and Financial Institutions Act (BAFIA), and various NRB directives.
