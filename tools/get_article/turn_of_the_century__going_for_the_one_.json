Redirecting to the specific album or film in which the song appears is preferable to redirecting to the artist when possible.\n** There is consensus that the majority of songs do not meet Wikipedia's notability guidelines. Songs should only have an individual article when there is enough material to warrant a detailed article.\n**\n**"
