The town lies along the China–Myanmar border and serves as a border crossing between the two countries.\nThe town is part of Myanmar's Kachin Special Region 1. The town is also known for its snowy landscape in the winter, with some locals nicknaming it the \"ice city\".\nHistory\nThe village of Pang War was elevated to town status by Notification 200/24-66/U-1 on 5 January 2011.\nRare Earth Mining\nThe town serves as a hub for rare earth mining under the control of the New Democratic Army – Kachin (NDA-K) administered as Kachin Special Region 1.\nOn 4 June 2024, a landslide occurred at a rare earth mine in Pang War, resulting in the deaths of at least 7 miners and the disappearance of at least 10 additional miners. Then on 15 June, another landslide occurred at rare earth mine in Pang War resulting in 50 miners going missing. Little information was made available as search and rescue operations commenced.\n2024 Kachin offensive\nDuring the renewed Myanmar civil war, Pang War became the target of offensives by the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) against the NDA-K in October 2024. Fighting in the area began as early as mid-September as the resistance-aligned KIA and the junta-aligned NDA-K fought in Chipwi Township in the valley with NDA-K and the junta losing the strategic Lag Way camp nearby. The junta continued their defence with airstrikes as their Pang War Border Guard Forces Battalion 1002 remained on the ground to defend.\nOn 15 October, the 1002 battalion headquarters in Pang War was captured. By 23 October 2024, the town had been completely taken with the KIA seizing the NDA-K leader's house.\nReferences"
