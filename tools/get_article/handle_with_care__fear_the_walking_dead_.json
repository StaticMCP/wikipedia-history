Zapanta from Den of Geek! rate the episode 4 out of 5 and wrote: \"I’m glad Fear is giving these original characters their due. As much as I love the newer arrivals, like Morgan, it’s good to acknowledge the characters (and their many defining imperfections) that got us here in the first place.\" Erik Kain of Forbes had mixed opinions of the episode, writing, \"Not a terrible episode, not an episode I’d watch twice. They really need to thin the herd, and not just by killing the show’s best characters. Hell, my vote goes to Al’s stupid SWAT van. That thing has to go. It should never have been introduced in the first place.\" Writing for \"TV Fanatic\", Paul Daily gave the episode 4.75 out of 5 and wrote: \"Daniel Salazar is the best-written character on TV. ... [He] has managed to survive the mass cast exodus in the seasons since [the first].\" Emily Hannemann of TV Insider gave the episode a 4.5 out of 5, writing \"I'm looking forward to seeing where Daniel's story goes from here. Especially now that he's with Strand.\"\nRatings\nThe episode was seen by 1.10 million viewers in the United States on its original air date, below the previous episodes.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.amc.com/shows/fear-the-walking-dead/episodes/season-6-episode-10-handle-with-care--55646 \"Handle with Care\"] at AMC.com\n*"
