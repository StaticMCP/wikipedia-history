There was only one candidate, incumbent president Hafez al-Assad, with voters asked to approve or reject his candidacy. A reported 100% of voters voted in favour, with a turnout of 98.5%. Assad was re-elected for another seven-year term. However, he died in June 2000, resulting in an early presidential election that year.\nResults\nReferences"
