      "text": "# Duncan Stewart (environmentalist)\n\nDuncan Stewart (born 1948) is an Irish architect, environmentalist and media personality known for his environmental activism and work on RTÉ, most notably in the show Eco Eye from 2002 to 2023. He secured his primary degree from UCD. His niece, Louise Morris from Wales is often credited as being the influence for his pursuit in the fight against climate change.\nIn 1969-70, while still a student, Stewart led the six-month occupation of a row of seven large Georgian houses on Hume Street, Dublin, in protest at their planned demolition in favour of a new office block.\nIn 2003, he had a near-fatal accident while filming a documentary in Chernobyl.\nIn April 2014, he vowed to walk out of an interview on the Newstalk Breakfast Show unless he was given more time to speak on the topic of climate change. During the interview he claimed that climate change is not sufficiently covered by the Irish media.\nIn 2018, he and George Lee (also of RTÉ) were promoting the Nissan Leaf.\nIn 2023 he retired from RTÉ as Eco Eye was axed. That same year, he was awarded the Freedom of the City of Dublin by Green Party Lord Mayor of Dublin Caroline Conroy.\nStewart is a keen clarinet player and often graces the doors of Hotel Newport, County Mayo.\nNotable television credits\n* About the House\n* Eco Eye\nReferences"
