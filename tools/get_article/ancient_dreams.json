The cover art of the album is a painting made by Thomas Cole, second in his series, \"The Voyage of Life\", entitled \"Youth\". Ancient Dreams was the first Candlemass album to chart in the US, debuting at No. 174 on the Billboard'' 200 album chart.\n\"Epistle 81\" (Märk hur vår skugga), was written by Swedish poet/musician Carl Michael Bellman (1740 – 1795). \"Incarnation of Evil\" is actually a reworked version of the old Nemesis track \"Black Messiah.\"\nThe band were not happy with the album's sound mix for which they blamed their then record label. The band felt that the album production had been rushed in order to have the LP released in time for their US tour.\nTrack listing\n*The track \"Black Sabbath Medley\" is a CD bonus track and is composed of parts of songs from Black Sabbath, namely: \"Symptom of the Universe\", \"Sweet Leaf\", \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\", \"Into the Void\", \"Electric Funeral\", \"Supernaut\", \"Black Sabbath\".\nPersonnel\nCandlemass\n* Messiah Marcolin – vocals\n* Lars Johansson – lead guitar\n* Mats Björkman – rhythm guitar\n* Leif Edling – bass\n* Jan Lindh – drums\nProduction\n* Rex Gisslén – mixing at Montezuma Studios, Stockholm\n* Peter Dahl – mastering at Polar Studios, Stockholm\n* Wendy Kramer – artwork, graphics\n* Micke Lind – remastering\n* Micke Mårtensson – artwork, layout\n* Ulf Magnusson – photography\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"330px\"\n!align=\"center\"|Year\n!align=\"center\"|Chart\n!align=\"center\"|Position\n|-\n|align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"|1989\n|align=\"center\"|Swedish Albums Chart\n|align=\"center\"|45\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|Billboard 200 (US)\n|align=\"center\"|174\n|}\nReferences"
