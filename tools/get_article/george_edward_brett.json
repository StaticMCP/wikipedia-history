Brett was aided in the creation of the New York office by American firm Messrs Pott & Amery.  Frederick Macmillan, commenting on Brett resignation letter, said \"We have all been profoundly touched by your letter . . . it is a great achievement for a man to go through this life with a spotless reputation & to be successful in what he sets himself to do.  You will have succeeded in both these aims, and whatever fortune may have in store for the New York Agency, we shall not forget who it was that brought it through troublous times.\"  The Bretts remained in control of the American offices of Macmillan from its creation in 1869 to the early 1960s, “a span matched by few other families in the history of United States business.”[http://www.answers.com/topic/macmillan-inc?cat=biz-fin Macmillan: Information and Much More from Answers.com]\nBrett opened the New York branch of Macmillan Publishing at Clayton Hall., 53 Bleecker Street, New York, NY.\nOn May 1, 1890, Brett's son George Platt Brett Sr., succeeded him as head of the New York office of Macmillan.\nPrior to joining Macmillan, Brett worked for Simpkin Marshall & Co.\nSee also\n*George Platt Brett Sr.\n*George Platt Brett\n*Richard M.
