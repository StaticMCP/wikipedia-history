It was a resounding Saudi victory against the Egyptian forces.\nPrelude\nIn 1811, the Ottoman forces led by Tusun Pasha, the son of Muhammad Ali Pasha, captured Yanbu from the Saudis. The Saudi garrison had only 300 men; their leader escaped, and the garrison was either killed or captured. The Ottoman forces then proceeded to Badr where they fought the Saudis in a battle for two hours until they succeeded in capturing Badr. The Saudis retreated to Wadi Al-Safra near Medina, the Ottomans had an army of 8,000 or 14,000 men. When Saud bin Abdulaziz heard of the invading Ottomans, he recruited his forces from Najd, Hejaz, and Tihamah with an army of 18,000 men and 800 cavalry and marched to Wadi Al-Safra (also known as Al-Kheif) with his son Abdullah bin Saud Al Saud.\nBattle\nWhen they arrived at Al-Kheif, Abdullah ordered Mas'ud Bin Madhian to march to a hill next to Al-Kheif in order not to get outflanked. Abdullah then sent a small force to engage with the Ottomans, but they were defeated and 32 were killed. Abdullah then gave command of the cavalry to his brother Faisal bin Mas'ud and Habab bin Qahisan. The fighting started, and both sides suffered losses. The Bedouins were defeated, but the rest held their places. The fighting continued for three days. Abdullah ordered Mas'ud Bin Madhian and other Bedouins to charge against the Ottomans, which broke them and killed many of them, causing panic in Ottoman ranks.\nThe Ottomans retreated unorganized from the battlefield, leaving 600 dead on the field; however, they were chased by the Saudis, who dealt great casualties to them, and the final Ottoman casualties were 4,000 or 5,000 killed; the Saudis lost only 600, and they captured 7 Ottoman cannons alongside much weaponry.\nReferences"
