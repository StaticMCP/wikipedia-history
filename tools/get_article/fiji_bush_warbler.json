There are four subspecies occurring on all the main islands of the group. The species has been afforded its own genus, Vitia, in the past, but similarities of egg colour, song and morphology place it firmly within the Horornis bush-warblers.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Fiji Bush Warbler\n\n#REDIRECT Fiji bush warbler\n}}"
