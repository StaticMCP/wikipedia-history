It recognized the best recordings, compositions, and artists of the eligibility year, running from October 1, 2018, to August 31, 2019. Alicia Keys hosted the ceremony, having hosted the previous year's ceremony as well.\nLizzo received the most nominations of any artist with eight, followed by Billie Eilish and Lil Nas X with six each. Finneas, Eilish's brother, received the most awards with six, followed by Eilish herself with five. Eilish became the second artist to win the four major categories of Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best New Artist in the same year after Christopher Cross in 1981.\nTen days prior to the ceremony, Recording Academy president Deborah Dugan was relieved of her duties as president and CEO and placed on administrative leave from the organization. She sparked controversy by claiming that the organization engaged in corruption and favoritism; Champagne Billecart-Salmon responded by pulling their ads from the broadcast, and Megyn Kelly, Gabrielle Union, and others tweeted their support of Dugan. The ceremony was held on the same day as the death of basketball player Kobe Bryant, to whose memory Keys and Boyz II Men dedicated their performance of \"It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday\".\nBackground and controversy\nAfter many years of being traditionally held in February (except during the years of the Winter Olympics), the 62nd Grammy Awards ceremony was moved to the last Sunday in January, following the Academy Awards' decision to move their 2020 ceremony to the second Sunday in February. Nominations were announced in all 84 categories by Gayle King, Alicia Keys, and Bebe Rexha on the set of CBS This Morning on November 20, 2019.\nThis was set to be the first edition of the Grammy Awards that the new Recording Academy president Deborah Dugan would have presided over; however, she was relieved of her duties as president and CEO and placed on administrative leave from the organization ten days before the ceremony. The Academy launched an investigation into allegations that Dugan bullied an assistant. After her dismissal, Dugan sparked controversy by claiming that the Recording Academy engaged in favoritism and corruption during the Grammy nomination process. Taylor Swift reportedly cancelled a planned surprise performance of her song \"The Man\" at the ceremony in solidarity with Dugan, although both Swift and Grammys producer Ken Ehrlich denied this. Recording Academy Chairman Harvey Mason Jr. took over as interim president and chief executive officer and presided over the ceremony instead of Dugan.\nThe ceremony was held at the Staples Center on the same day as the death of basketball player Kobe Bryant, who played for the Los Angeles Lakers — the arena is the team's home venue. Several tributes to Bryant were included in the ceremony, including a performance of \"It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday\" by host Alicia Keys and Boyz II Men, while Lil Nas X, Lizzo and DJ Khaled all incorporated tributes to Bryant into their performances.\nCategory changes\nFor the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards, multiple categories were changed.\n* As of the 62nd Grammy Awards, the Recording Academy would accept links to streaming services as opposed to physical copies as submissions. The Academy stated: \"For most categories, we would prefer streaming distribution links for online entry submissions, though CD submissions remain optional\". As justification for this development, the Academy highlighted the changing music industry and added that submitting links was more convenient and cost effective, especially for smaller and independent labels.\n* Additionally, there were separate screening committees for Pop and Rock, whereas previously these categories were screened by a Core Committee. This leaves the Core Committee to focus on the more difficult decisions such as determining who is eligible for the Best New Artist category and trying to find the best home for borderline genre entries.\n* The definition of the Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album had been expanded to accept \"contemporary pop songs performed in traditional pop style – the term \"traditional\" being a reference to the style of the composition, vocal styling and the instrumental arrangement without regard to the age of the material\". The Academy stated that broadening the category was done in an attempt to allow it to \"remain robust and inclusive\" and enable it to be more competitive as, for example, Tony Bennett has won the award 13 times.\n* Spoken word recordings targeted at children had been moved from the Best Children's Album category to the Best Spoken Word Album.\n* As of the 62nd Grammy Awards, Spanish-language Latin Gospel and Christian music would be officially welcomed in the Best Gospel Album, Best Contemporary Christian Music Album, Best Roots Gospel Album, Best Gospel Performance/Song and Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song categories.\nPerformers\nPremiere ceremony\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Artist(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Song\n|-\n|Chick Corea and the Spanish Heart Band\n|House Band\n|-\n|I'm with Her\n|\"Call My Name\"\n|-\n|Angélique Kidjo\n|\"Afirika\"\n|-\n|Nicola Benedetti\n|Instrumental\n|-\n|Yola\n|\"Faraway Look\"\n|}\nMain ceremony\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Artist(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Song(s)\n|-\n|Lizzo\n| \"Cuz I Love You\"\"Truth Hurts\"\n|-\n|Alicia KeysBoyz II Men\n| Tribute to Kobe Bryant\"It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday\"\n|-\n|Blake SheltonGwen Stefani\n| \"Nobody but You\"\n|-\n|Alicia Keys\n| Tribute to nominated artists to the tune of\"Someone You Loved\" by Lewis Capaldi\n|-\n|Jonas Brothers\n|\"Five More Minutes\"\"What a Man Gotta Do\"\n|-\n|Tyler, the CreatorBoyz II MenCharlie Wilson\n|\"Earfquake\"\"New Magic Wand\"\n|-\n|UsherFKA TwigsSheila E.\n|Tribute to Prince\"Little Red Corvette\"\"When Doves Cry\"\"Kiss\"\n|-\n|Camila Cabello\n|\"First Man\"\n|-\n|Tanya TuckerBrandi Carlile\n|\"Bring My Flowers Now\"\n|-\n|Ariana Grande\n| \"Imagine\"\"My Favorite Things\"\"7 Rings\"\"Thank U, Next\"\n|-\n|Billie EilishFinneas\n| \"When the Party's Over\"\n|-\n|AerosmithRun-DMC\n|\"Livin' on the Edge\"\"Walk This Way\"\n|-\n|Lil Nas XBilly Ray CyrusBTSDiploMason RamseyNas\n|\"Old Town Road\"\"Rodeo\"\n|-\n|Demi Lovato\n|\"Anyone\"\n|-\n|DJ KhaledKirk FranklinJohn LegendMeek MillRoddy RicchYG\n|Tribute to Nipsey Hussle\"Letter to Nipsey\"\"Higher\"\n|-\n|Rosalía\n|\"Juro Qué\"\"Malamente\"\n|-\n|Alicia KeysBrittany Howard\n|\"Underdog\"\n|-\n|H.E.R.\n|\"Sometimes\"\n|-\n|-\n|Bonnie Raitt\n|Tribute to John Prine\"Angel from Montgomery\"\n|-\n|Gary Clark Jr.The Roots\n|\"This Land\"\n|-\n|Trombone ShortyOrleans AvenuePreservation Hall Jazz Band\n|Tribute to Dr. John\n|-\n|Ben PlattCyndi LauperJohn LegendJoshua David BellDebbie AllenMisty CopelandCamila CabelloGary Clark Jr.Lang LangThe War and TreatyLee CurreriCommon\n|Tribute to music education and Kenneth Ehrlich\"I Sing the Body Electric\"\n|-\n|}\nPresenters\nPremiere ceremony\n*Imogen Heap – hosted the Grammy Premiere Ceremony, presented Visual Media, World Music, American Roots, Pop and Producer categories\n*Kimie Miner – presented Packaging, Notes, Historical, Engineering, Remixer, Surround Sound and Music Video/Film categories\n*Esperanza Spalding – presented New Age, American Roots, Reggae, Children's, Spoken Word, Dance and Contemporary Instrumental categories\n*Luis Fonsi – presented Composing, Arranging, Jazz and Country categories\n*PJ Morton – presented Gospel, Latin and Rap categories\n*Natalia Joachim – presented Classical categories\n*Jimmy Jam – presented Musical Theatre, Rock, Alternative and R&B categories\nMain ceremony\n* Billy Porter – introduced the Jonas Brothers\n* Keith Urban & Cynthia Erivo – presented Best Pop Solo Performance\n* Trevor Noah – introduced Tyler, the Creator\n* Shania Twain & Bebe Rexha – presented Best Country Duo/Group Performance\n* Jim Gaffigan – introduced Camila Cabello\n* Brandi Carlile & Tanya Tucker – presented Best Comedy Album\n* Ben Platt – introduced Ariana Grande\n* Common – introduced Aerosmith & Run-DMC\n* Issa Rae – presented Best Rap Album\n* Ellen DeGeneres – introduced Lil Nas X\n* Greta Gerwig – introduced Demi Lovato\n* Ava DuVernay – introduced the Tribute to Nipsey Hussle\n* Smokey Robinson & Little Big Town – presented Song of the Year\n* Ozzy & Sharon Osbourne – presented Best Rap/Sung Performance & introduced H.E.R.\n* Alicia Keys & Dua Lipa – presented Best New Artist\n* John Legend – introduced the Tribute to Kenneth Ehrlich\n* LL Cool J – presented Album of the Year\n* Alicia Keys – presented Record of the Year\nNotes\n* Stevie Wonder was announced as a presenter, but did not appear at the ceremony.\nWinners and nominees\nwon all four major general field awards in the same year, becoming the second artist to achieve the feat and the first since 1981.]]\nreceived the most nominations, with eight in total.
