His father was the principal of Trondheim Cathedral School.\nPetersen became a cand. pilot. in history in 1914 at the University of Oslo and the following year was employed as a curator at the University's Antiquities Collection. Petersen received a dr.philos. in archeology during 1919. Petersen was director of the Stavanger Museum from 1923 to 1958.\nDuring this period he worked with excavation and publication of Iron Age farms in southwestern Norway. He also worked with architect  Gerhard Fischer (1890-1977)  in the preservation and restoration of the medieval monastery  Utstein Abbey.\nHe was  notable for writing De Norske Vikingsverd (\"The Norwegian Viking Swords\") in 1919.  This book was the \"standard and authoritative work\" on Norse sword typology and \"remains an invaluable guide today.\"\nThe Oakeshott typology by British historian and illustrator Ewart Oakeshott (1916–2002) was based on Petersen's work.\nPersonal life\nIn 1928, he was elected to the Norwegian Academy of Sciences.\nIn 1917, he married Gerda Holtermann (1892–1985).
