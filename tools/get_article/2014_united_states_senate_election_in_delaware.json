This election was the fifth consecutive even-number year in which a senate election was held in Delaware after elections in 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012.\nIncumbent Democratic Senator Chris Coons ran for re-election to a first full term in office. He was unopposed for the Democratic nomination and defeated Republican businessman Kevin Wade in the general election.\nBackground\nDemocratic senator Joe Biden was re-elected to a seventh term in 2008, defeating Republican political commentator Christine O'Donnell by 65% to 35%. At the same time, he was elected Vice President of the United States and resigned his Senate seat to be sworn in as vice president in January 2009. Delaware Governor Ruth Ann Minner appointed Biden's longtime aide Ted Kaufman to the seat until a special election was held in November 2010. In the election, Christine O'Donnell ran again and upset U.S. Representative and former governor Mike Castle in the Republican primary to face Democrat Chris Coons, who had run unopposed for his party's nomination. In the general election, Coons defeated O'Donnell by 57% to 40% and was sworn in later that month.\nDemocratic primary\nCandidates\nDeclared\n* Chris Coons, incumbent U.S. Senator\nDeclined\n* Beau Biden, Delaware Attorney General and son of then vice president Joe Biden\nRepublican primary\nCandidates\nDeclared\n* Carl Smink, retired engineer and businessman\n* Kevin Wade, businessman and nominee for the U.S. Senate in 2012\nDeclined\n* Mike Castle, former U.S. Representative, former Governor of Delaware and candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2010\n* Tom Kovach, New Castle County Council President and nominee for Delaware's at-large congressional district in 2012\n* Christine O'Donnell, political commentator, candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2006 and nominee for the U.S. Senate in 2008 and 2010\nPrimary results\n}}\nOther candidates\nGreen Party\nNominee\n* Andrew Groff, computer science professor and nominee for the U.S. Senate in 2012\nGeneral election\nFundraising\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
