The station is located above ground on a viaduct and is an interchange for the Tsuen Wan and Tung Chung lines.\nThe Chinese name of the station uses the classical character of }} instead of the contemporary version of }}. The former is regarded as orthodox per the Kangxi dictionary. The same goes for Lai Chi Kok station which shares the same character.\nHistory\nTsuen Wan Line\nLai King was opened on 10 May 1982 as an intermediate stop on the . The station was built to serve the adjacent public housing complex and the container terminal on the coast. The station contractor was Maeda-Okumura joint venture.\nTung Chung Line\nWhen the rail link to Lantau Island was announced, Lai King was chosen to be the interchange between the Tsuen Wan line and the then proposed . The new line's construction of a station and tunnels was awarded to Maeda Corporation under Contract 508 in December 1994. During the construction of the Tung Chung line platforms, the layout of the station was significantly altered. New tracks were added above the existing tracks to provide a cross-platform interchange between the Tung Chung and Tsuen Wan lines. The outbound Tsuen Wan line trains now stops on the same level as the outbound Tung Chung line trains, and the same goes for the inbound services.\nAn additional pair of tracks was constructed to permit the  trains to bypass Lai King without stopping. The station is made up of six tracks with four platforms.\nThe station has opened a toilet on 31 October 2019.\nStation layout\nOutbound (Tung Chung-bound) passengers on the Tung Chung line can walk across the platform at Lai King to board the Tsuen Wan line trains for destinations in Kwai Chung and Tsuen Wan.\nThose who are travelling to Central and Hong Kong Island from Kwai Chung and Tsuen Wan can transfer at Lai King, across the platform, for an express service on the Tung Chung line. Given both the Tsuen Wan line and Tung Chung line trains terminate at the Central & Hong Kong station complex, most passenger opt for the latter as it makes fewer stops. As a result, the station is often crowded at peak hours given the number of transfer passengers.\n{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;border-top:solid 1px gray;width:50px;\"|G\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;width:120px;\"|Ground\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;width:390px;\"|Exit A1 (Lai King Hill Road)\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;border-top:solid 1px gray;width:50px;\"|L1\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;width:120px;\"|Passageway\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;width:390px;\"|Exits A2, A3, C (Yin Lai Court, Lai King Estate)\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;vertical-align:top;\" rowspan=3|L3\n|Platform\n|←  towards  ()\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Island platform, doors will open on the left for Tsuen Wan line and right for Tung Chung line\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Platform\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|←  towards  ()\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;vertical-align:top;\" rowspan=3|L4\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Upper concourse\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Exits, MTR Shops, automatic teller machines\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;vertical-align:top;\" rowspan=2|Lower concourse\n|Exits, customer service\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|MTR Shops, Hang Seng Bank, automatic teller machines\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;vertical-align:top;\" rowspan=5|L5\n|Platform\n|  Tsuen Wan line towards  () →\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Island platform, doors will open on the right for Tsuen Wan line and left for Tung Chung line\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Platform\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|  Tung Chung line towards  () →\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" |\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|  does not stop here →\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|←  Airport Express does not stop here\n|}\nEntrances/exits\n*A1: Lai King Hill Road\n*A2: Yin Lai Court\n*A3: Lai King Estate\n*B: Kwai Chung Container Terminal\n*C: HKEAA Lai King Assessment Centre\nReferences"
