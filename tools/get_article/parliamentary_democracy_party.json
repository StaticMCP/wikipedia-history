Its armed wing, the Patriotic Liberation Army, unsuccessfully attempted insurgency along the border between Thailand and Burma. In 1970, with covert CIA backing, the party tried to establish a united front, known as the National United Front, together with the Karen National Union, the Chin Democracy Party and the New Mon State Army. The end of the Vietnam War also brought an influx of modern weaponry for the PLA such as M79 grenade launchers, M16 rifles, and AK47 rifles. Former KNU leader and current State Administration Council junta member, Mahn Nyein Maung, claimed that the KNLA still largely used WW2-era weapons such as Bren guns at this time.  However, the NUF faced financial difficulties and political disagreement between its different ethnic constituencies. After U Nu resigned the PDP's presidency and moved to India in 1973, the movement collapsed.\nReferences"
