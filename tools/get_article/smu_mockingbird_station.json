The station is located at the intersection of Mockingbird Lane and North Central Expressway (US&nbsp;75). The station serves the , , and . It is the northernmost station to serve all three lines: the Red and Orange Lines continue north towards Richardson and Plano, while the Blue Line continues northeast towards Garland and Rowlett.\nThe station is located  east of the main campus of Southern Methodist University (SMU), which is on Mockingbird Lane on the opposite side of US&nbsp;75. SMU operates a shuttle route between the station and the campus. The station also serves the University Crossing neighborhood of Dallas and the Park Cities (i.e., Highland Park and University Park). It directly connects to the University Crossing Trail, which in turn connects to the Katy Trail, Ridgewood Trail, and SoPac Trail.\n, the station has the highest ridership of all Blue Line stations outside of Downtown Dallas and the highest weekend ridership of all Red Line stations outside of Downtown Dallas, with an average of 2,002 riders on weekdays, 1,600 riders on Saturdays, and 1,187 riders on Sundays.\nMockingbird Station is a mixed-use development adjacent to the station, which contains an open-air shopping district, an Angelika Film Center, apartments, and office space.\nStation\nA northbound train at the stationSMU/Mockingbird is the only entrenched station in the DART light rail system, with the main platform located  below ground level. The station is the northern end of a  tunnel to Downtown Dallas.\nThe station's upper level consists of a small plaza containing ticket machines, an elevator, and a pair of escalators. The west entrance to the plaza leads to the Mockingbird Station development and the University Crossing Trail, while the east entrance leads to buses, passenger drop-off/pick-up, bicycle parking, and vehicle parking. A stairwell to the rail platform is located at each end of the bus platform.\nOn the lower level is the rail platform, which is an island platform. Southbound and westbound trains board on the western side, while northbound and eastbound trains board on the eastern side. All three lines use the same platforms.\nArtwork\nThe eastern entrance to the station contains six  archways, each of which are decorated with colorful mosaic tiles and topped with a stained-glass mockingbird. The western retaining wall is decorated with a colorful ribbon pattern, while the eastern retaining wall is landscaped with shade-tolerant plants.\nHistory\nPlans for a station at North Central and Mockingbird date back to DART's 1983 rail plan. A revised plan in 1986 called for the Mockingbird Lane station to open in 1994 as the initial northern terminus for the North Central line. Later in the decade, DART obtained two rail corridors that intersected north of Mockingbird Lane, one from Southern Pacific (which became the Red Line) and the other from Union Pacific (which became the Blue Line).\nA 1990 study of the Southern Pacific corridor determined two possible locations for the Mockingbird Lane station. One location would consist of two separate stations north of the Southern Pacific/Union Pacific junction, while the other would consist of a single station south of the junction. Both proposals included a 950-space parking lot. DART ultimately chose the southern site. The site was located near the former headquarters of Dr Pepper, which was demolished in 1997. A proposal was made to name and theme the station after Dr Pepper, but this was rejected.\nMockingbird station opened on January 10, 1997 as part of a Red Line extension from Pearl to Park Lane. The station did not receive Blue Line service until September 27, 1999, and said service was weekday-only until the opening of White Rock station on September 24, 2001.\nIn 2015, DART added two dedicated spaces for carsharing company Zipcar to the station's passenger pick-up/drop-off zone. An additional space was added later in the year.\nOn November 4, 2017, a pedestrian bridge over Mockingbird Lane, which connected the station to the Katy Trail, was opened.\nOn August 12, 2019, DART renamed the station to SMU/Mockingbird station, with SMU paying DART $463,000 for a 10-year naming rights agreement.\nDevelopment\nThe Lofts at Mockingbird Station, the residential section of the development\nSeveral months after the DART station opened, developers Ken Hughes and Archon Group announced plans for Mockingbird Station, a transit-oriented development complex with a pedestrian connection to the DART station. The 10-acre, $100 million complex, built on top of a former Western Electric warehouse, opened on July 1, 2001.\nThe complex contains 211 apartments,  of office space, and  of retail and restaurant space. Notable retail tenants include Angelika Film Center, Bath & Body Works, Loft, and Urban Outfitters. The property is currently owned by CBRE Group, which purchased the property in 2015.\nA 2004 study of transit-oriented developments by the Transportation Research Board called Mockingbird Station \"a TOD success story,\" praising it for its location with \"strong local demographics, and an abundance of adjacent regional attractions,\" as well as for being driven by private developers.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.dart.org Dallas Area Rapid Transit] - [https://www.dart.org/guide/transit-and-use/rail/rail-station-detail/smu-mockingbird-station SMU/Mockingbird Station]\n* [https://www.smu.edu/businessfinance/campusservices/parkingandidcardservices/transportation/smuexpress SMU Express Shuttles]\n* [https://mockingbirdstation.com/ Mockingbird Station] (adjacent development)"
