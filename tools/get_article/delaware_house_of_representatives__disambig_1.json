It is composed of 41 Representatives from an equal number of constituencies, each of whom is elected to a two-year term. Its members are not subject to term limits, and their terms start the day after the election. The House meets at the Delaware Legislative Hall in Dover.\nName\nFrom 1776 to 1792, the chamber was known as the House of Assembly, a common name for lower houses of colonial legislatures and states under the Confederation. The name was changed by Delaware's 1792 Constitution, reflecting the new federal House of Representatives. This change on the part of Delaware initiated a movement that has resulted in a majority of the lower houses of U.S. state legislatures sharing the name of the federal House of Representatives.\nLeadership\nThe Speaker of the House presides over the House of Representatives. The Speaker is elected by the majority party caucus followed by confirmation of the full House through the passage of a House Resolution. The Speaker is the chief leadership position of the body. The other House leaders are elected by their respective party caucuses. The Majority Leader determines which bills are brought to the floor for debate from an Agenda prepared by the Speaker of the House and manages debates and floor votes.\nTerry Spence (R) was the longest serving speaker in the history of the Delaware General Assembly. Valerie Longhurst was the first woman to serve as speaker and current speaker Melissa Minor-Brown, is the first Black woman in the role.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Office !!
