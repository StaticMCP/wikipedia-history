The album was a retrospective of Cole's recording career, designed to present many of his earlier hits in new recordings featuring stereo sound. Cole is accompanied on the re-recordings by many of the notable arrangers and bands that had appeared with him on the original records.\nOf particular note is Cole's re-recording of \"The Christmas Song\". This was Cole's fourth, and final, recording of the song, and also the first version recorded in stereo. This recording of the song was subsequently added to a 1963 reissue of Cole's 1960 LP The Magic of Christmas (the album concurrently retitled The Christmas Song and given new cover art), and remains one of Cole's best-known recordings and among the most-played Christmas tunes on radio each December.\nThis compilation also marks the last time Cole would record with a Trio.  In addition to The Christmas Song, referenced above, the album includes Cole's recreations in stereo of five of his early Trio hits, including \"Straighten Up and Fly Right\", \"Sweet Lorraine\", \"It's Only a Paper Moon\", \"(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66\" and \"For Sentimental Reasons\", in addition to \"Orange Colored Sky\", a re-recording of a song originally done in 1950 in conjunction with the Stan Kenton Orchestra.\nAt the 4th Annual Grammy Awards, The Nat King Cole Story was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year.\nTrack listing\nDisc 1\n# \"Straighten Up and Fly Right\" (Nat King Cole, Irving Mills) – 2:36\n# \"Sweet Lorraine\" (Cliff Burwell, Mitchell Parish) – 3:22\n# \"It's Only a Paper Moon\" (Harold Arlen, Yip Harburg, Billy Rose) – 2:57\n# \"(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66\" (Bobby Troup) – 2:56\n# \"(I Love You) For Sentimental Reasons\" (William Best, Deek Watson) – 3:04\n# \"The Christmas Song (Merry Christmas to You)\" (Mel Tormé, Robert Wells) – 3:11\n# \"Nature Boy\" (Eden Ahbez) – 2:53\n# \"Lush Life\" (Billy Strayhorn) – 3:46\n# \"Calypso Blues\" (Cole, D.W.
