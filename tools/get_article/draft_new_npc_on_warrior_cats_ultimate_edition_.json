Splash has not really been confirmed a new NPC yet since only two or three groups of hunters have seen Splash. But what is confirmed is every thing we know about him. Splash has only been seen in to forms, a blueish gray pelt and blind eyes and brown with blind eyes, which could mean he’s a hostile NPC. Splash has only three cues and three spawning spots, his cues are water fall nosies, splashing water, and thunder. His spawning spots are the carrion place, the gorge, and riverclan. Though we don’t know whether he’s a real NPC or not we know that he can ban,kick,and possibly possess. But here’s our story, so we were hunting for tall summoner when saw a grayish blue flash by the gorge ( this was the second time we saw him ). But it also turns out he can summon two the most dangerous NPCs ( this has been confirmed) Mother and possibly Tall summoner.\nSo just to let all NPC hunters know don’t be afraid if you see Splash."
