He was educated in Blackheath, London, England, where he became a close friend of Benjamin Disraeli.\nCareer\nHe received his commission in the Royal Engineers in 1825. He was involved in the Rideau Canal construction in Canada in 1827 to 1833.\nIn September 1839 Frome arrived in South Australia on the ship  Recovery to take up an appointment as the colony's third Surveyor General. He was also a member of the South Australian Legislative Council (2 October 1839 to 14 June 1843). He made an important contribution in surveying large areas of South Australia for new immigrants to settle upon.\nHe was also a competent artist and made many sketches and paintings of landscapes on his surveying expeditions. In one of his sketchbooks, there is a sketch of a Milmenrura village in the south-east of South Australia consisting of a cluster of about twelve established Aboriginal homes. It is annotated with the note \"burnt by me, October 1840\". This was apparently part of the retribution for the Maria massacre of shipwrecked survivors a few months earlier.\nIn 1843 he led an expedition to the mid-north of South Australia and was the first to accurately map Lake Frome.\nAfter his ten-year term expired he returned to England and was subsequently stationed in Mauritius, Scotland and Gibraltar. Between 1869 and 1874 he served as Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey.\nLater life and legacy\nHe retired in 1877 with the army rank of general, and died on 2 November 1890 at Ewell in Surrey.\nHis name was given to two lakes – Lake Frome in the state's north-east and Lake Frome in the state's south-east; Frome River in the Lake Eyre basin; and Frome Road, a major thoroughfare in Adelaide.\nThe South Australian Electoral district of Frome, named after him, has existed in several incarnations since 1884. The latest incarnation has existed since 1991, but in 2024 the Electoral Districts Boundaries Commission announced that at the 2026 state election its name would be changed to Ngadjuri, due to concerns over Frome's involvement in acts of retribution following the Maria massacre.\nSee also\n*History of Adelaide\n*Water Witch (1835 cutter)\nReferences\n* McGrath, Sandra; & Olsen, John.
