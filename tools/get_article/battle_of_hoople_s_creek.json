The delay also gave Gen. Morrison precious time to consolidate his forces around Crysler's farm for the decisive battle.\nMary Hoople lived on the farm by the creek where the battle was fought and tried unsuccessfully to save the life of an invading American rifleman wounded at the battle on November 10, 1813.  After the War, the U.S. government compensated her for compassion.\nReferences"
