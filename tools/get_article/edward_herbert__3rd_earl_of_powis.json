Sir Percy Egerton Herbert was his younger brother and also a Member of Parliament.\nEducation\nHe was educated at Eton College and St John's College, Cambridge, where he was president of the University Pitt Club, and he graduated as MA in 1840 and LLD in 1848.  He was also awarded an honorary degree as DCL by Oxford University. Whilst at Cambridge he played in two first-class cricket matches for the Cambridge Town Club against Cambridge University Cricket Club.\nHe was later appointed High Steward of Cambridge University in 1863.\nHe was also President of the Powysland Club, founded in 1867, dedicated to the study of Montgomeryshire's history and other aspects of the county.\nPolitical career\nVanity Fair caricature of the Earl of Powis by Spy.|200px]]\nPowis was returned to Parliament as one of two MPs for Shropshire North in 1843, a seat he held until 1848, when he succeeded his father in the earldom and entered the House of Lords.\nPaternally great-grandson of Clive of India and grandson of a former Governor of Madras (Edward Clive, 1st Earl of Powis), the Earl was offered the Viceroyalty of India by then Prime Minister Disraeli in 1875, when aged 67, but declined, fearing his health \"would not be suited to the rigours of the tropical climate\". On the preserved envelope of the letter he scrawled, \"Not worth considering - Powis.\"\nFrom the formation of County Councils in 1889, he was County Alderman for Shropshire and County Councillor for Montgomeryshire.\nHe also served as Lord Lieutenant of Montgomeryshire from 1877 to 1891, and was J.P. for the counties of Shropshire and Herefordshire.\nMilitary service\nPowis (then Viscount Clive) was commissioned a cornet in the South Salopian Yeomanry Cavalry in 1840, and was captain by his father's death in 1848, when he succeeded him as colonel commanding the regiment.  He remained in command until resigning in 1871, aged 63.\nBusiness Interests\nPowis was chairman of the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company and of Welshpool Gas Company, who provided gas-lighting in Welshpool town.\nPersonal life\nLord Powis died at his London home at 45 Berkeley Square, Mayfair, in May 1891, aged 72, and was buried at St Mary's Church, Welshpool. He was unmarried and was succeeded in the earldom by his nephew, George.\nReferences\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
