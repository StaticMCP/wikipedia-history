A squadron of U.S. vessels, under the command of Stephen Decatur, Jr., met and engaged the flagship of the Algerine Navy, the frigate  under Admiral Hamidou. After a sharp action, Decatur's squadron captured the Algerine frigate and won a decisive victory over the Algerines.\nBackground\nStephen Decatur's squadron had left New York on May 20, 1815, with orders to destroy Algerine vessels and bring the Dey of Algiers to terms for attacking American shipping. He reached the Strait of Gibraltar on June 15, 1815, and began his mission. After learning that several Algerine cruisers had crossed the Strait of Gibraltar shortly before he did, Commodore Stephen Decatur, Jr. decided to give them chase and cut them off before they could reach Algiers.\nBattle\nCommanding a fleet of nine vessels, he encountered the Algerine flagship Mashouda (also spelled 'Mashuda' or 'Meshuda') of forty-six guns off Cape Gata, Spain. Heavily outnumbered, Admiral Rais Hamidou tried to flee to the port of Algiers, but was overtaken by the American squadron. After receiving damage from the  and with the admiral himself being wounded, the Algerines instead decided to change course and try for the safety of a neutral port along the Spanish coast.\nThe Constellation and the sloop  were able to close in and hammer the Algerine frigate. The Algerines resorted to replying with musket fire at close range, but Decatur was able to get his flagship, the , alongside the Algerine frigate. Firing a devastating broadside, the Guerriere crippled the enemy and killed the Algerine admiral. Decatur ceased firing, expecting the Algerine ship to surrender. Instead the Algerines continued to fight hopelessly with muskets as long as they were able. As a result, Decatur had the sloop  fire nine broadsides into the Meshuda with disastrous effect. The bloodied Algerines then struck their colors and ended the battle.\nAftermath\nFour hundred and six Algerines were captured, most wounded, and thirty killed. American losses were remarkably light, with only four dead and ten wounded (all on the Guerriere). Most of the American casualties were due to a gun explosion, but a few were due to enemy action. After sending the captured frigate to Cartagena, Decatur continued towards Algiers. However, his squadron encountered another Algerine cruiser off Cape Palos.  After engaging and capturing the cruiser Decatur arrived in Algiers. The loss of the Meshuda and Admiral Hamidou greatly weakened Algerine morale and naval capabilities. The American squadron met no further opposition and by a mere show of force were able to bring the Dey to terms, thus ending the war.\nBibliography\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=eaAB34NFf9wC&q=decatur Url]\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=_dyeFP5Hyc4C&q=gata Url]\n*\"Victory in Tripoli\", by Joshua E.
