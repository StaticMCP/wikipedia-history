Conall beheaded Mesgegra at the bullaun stone and placed his head in the hollow. Mesgegra's body was buried under King Mesgegra's Mound, while his head was buried at Mainham Cemetery, north of Clane, along with his wife Buan. This story is recounted in Tallaind Etair (\"The Siege of Howth\") in the 12th-century Book of Leinster.\nThe mound was later built on in the 12th century by the Normans who took control of Clane, probably by Richard de Hereford.\nSunday's Well, a warm spring now covered over, is at its base. At 13&nbsp;°C (55&nbsp;°F), it is one of only ten such springs in Ireland.\nReferences"
