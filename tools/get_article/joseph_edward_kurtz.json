Kurtz completed his post-graduate work at Marywood University in Scranton, Pennsylvania, earning a Master of Social Work degree.\nDuring his priestly ministry, Kurtz served as high school teacher, college lecturer, administrator, and pastor in Catasauqua and Bethlehem, both in Pennsylvania. The Vatican elevated Kurtz to the rank of Monsignor in 1986.\nBishop of Knoxville\nOn October 26, 1999, Kurtz was appointed as the second bishop of Knoxville by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on December 8. 1999. from Archbishop Gabriel Higuera, with Archbishop Thomas Kelly and Bishop Edward Cullen serving as co-consecrators, before an audience of approximately 5,000 at the Knoxville Convention Center in Knoxville, Tennessee.\nArchbishop of Louisville\nKurtz was named archbishop of Louisville on June 12, 2007, by Pope Benedict XVI.

He was elected as the vice president of the USCCB in November 2010. In November 2013, Kurtz was elected USCCB president. In February 2014, the Vatican named Kurtz as a member of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches.In November 2014, he was elected as a delegate to the 2015 Synod of Bishops on the Family, pending Vatican approval.\nIn February 2019, Kurtz released a report that named 22 priests from the archdiocese with credible accusations of sexual abuse. The report was prepared by an independent investigator who was not part of the church. None of the 22 men were active priests in 2019.\nIn July 2019, Kurtz underwent treatment for urothelial cancer, which required a three-month medical leave of absence from the archdiocese.\nRetirement\nOn February 8, 2022, Pope Francis accepted Kurtz's letter of resignation as archbishop of Louisville and named Shelton Joseph Fabre as archbishop of the Archdiocese. He was installed on March 30, 2022.\nDoctrinal positions\nKurtz is generally seen as a conservative and a firm follower of Vatican directives on doctrine and liturgy. The Rev. Thomas J. Reese indicates that Kurtz is a \"smiling conservative\" like Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, who is \"very gracious but still holds the same positions\" as a cleric like Archbishop Charles J. Chaput, who has openly criticized Catholic politicians who support abortion rights for women.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.archlou.org/ Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Louisville Official Site]"
