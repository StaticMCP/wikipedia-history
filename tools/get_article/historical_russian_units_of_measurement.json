From the 12th to 15th centuries, during the period of political fragmentation, Russian systems of measurement were diverse until the emergence of an all-Russian system of measurement.\nAlthough Peter is sometimes believed to have replaced Russian units with English units, in reality, he did not significantly change Russian units. Instead, the Russian units were redefined relative to the English system. He also did not apply Russian units in areas where the Russians had limited experience, such as in shipyards. The system also used Cyrillic numerals until the 18th century, when Peter the Great replaced it with the Hindu–Arabic numeral system.\nThe metric system was used from 1899 and remained legally optional from 1900 until it was made compulsory in the Russian SFSR in 1918.\nLength\nThe basic unit was the Russian ell, called the arshin, which is known in sources from the 16th century. The lokot (elbow) was replaced around this time. The Ivansky lokot, dating to the 11th or 12th century and used in Novgorod, was about 547mm. The arshin was originally the length of a man's arm from the shoulder. It was standardized by Peter the Great in the 18th century to measure exactly twenty-eight English inches (). Thus, 80 vershoks = 20 pyads = 5 arshins = 140 English inches ().\nA pyad (, \"palm\", \"five\"), known since the 12th century, or chyetvyert (, \"quarter\") is a hand span, the distance between ends of the spread thumb and index finger.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=3 | Unit\n! rowspan=3 | Ratio\n! rowspan=3 | Metricvalue\n! rowspan=3 | English value\n! rowspan=3 | Source\n|-\n! colspan=2 | Russian\n! rowspan=2 | Translation\n|-\n!

It may still be encountered in documents dealing with agricultural production (especially with reference to cereals), and has been revived in determining weights when casting bells in belfries following the rebirth of the Orthodox Churches in the former Soviet lands.\nApothecaries' system\nThe Imperial Russian apothecaries' weight was defined by setting the grain () to be exactly seven-fifths of a dolya.  The only unit name shared between the two was the funt (pound), but the one in the apothecaries' system is exactly seven-eighths of the ordinary funt.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Unit\n! Russian\n!

In modern colloquial Russian it is used in a generic meanings of \"very much\" and \"very\", as well as \"most surely\". The adjective  and the adverb  derive from this expression.\n* : Seven pyad across the forehead – very smart\n* : Not seven pyad across the forehead – not so smart\n* : A zolotnik is small, but expensive: when quality rather than quantity is important\n* : To walk in 7-mile steps – any kind of very fast progress, e.g., of improvement\n* : To learn how much a pound of likho costs – to experience something bad\n* : Do not give up (even) a pyad of land\n* : To eat a 'pood' of salt (with somebody) – to have a long common experience with somebody (with the implication \"to know someone well\")\nSee also\n* Petrograd Standard\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://www.academia.edu/10103740/Russian_system_of_measures_of_length_brief_description_ Russian system of measures of length (brief description)] by V.
