The award was established in 1988 to recognize excellence in quality and productivity, applying to the public sector similar criteria used for the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award.\nIn 2002, the PQA was redesigned to recognize Federal agencies that best achieve the objectives of the President’s Management Agenda (PMA).\nIn 2009, the PQA program ceased operation.\nSee also\n* Baldrige Award\n* Total Quality Management\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## President’s Quality Award\n\n#REDIRECT President's Quality Award\n}}\n\n---\n\n## President's quality award\n\n#REDIRECT President's Quality Award\n}}"
