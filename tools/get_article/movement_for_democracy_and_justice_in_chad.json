It initially tried to oust the government of the current Chadian president Idriss Déby from October 1998–2003. The movement was founded by Youssouf Togoïmi, Déby's former Defense Minister, and operated primarily in Bourkou-Ennedi-Tibesti and the Tibesti Mountains.\nThough MDJT fought mostly against the Chadian Military, they were accused of assassinating the President of an opposition party in 1999, but no evidence supports this claim.\nMDJT began negotiating with the Chadian government in January 2002 and signed a treaty giving amnesty to all MDJT rebels who stopped fighting. A MDJT remnant continued to fight to on a smaller scale until another agreement was signed in December 2003. This accord ensured high-ranking government positions for MDJT members. Togoïmi died in September 2002 in a Libyan hospital from injuries he had received a few days earlier when his truck hit a landmine. Togoïmi is buried in Libya.\nThe movement was similar in where it got its members, the Chadian military, and goals, overthrow of President Déby, to the later Platform for Change, Unity and Democracy.\nAmid the ongoing insurgency in Chad, it and other rebel groups conducted peace talks with the Chadian government in March 2022.\nSee also\n*Civil war in Chad (1998–2002)\n*Revolutionary Armed Forces of the Sahara\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=3629 MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base]\n*[http://peacemaker.un.org/chad-agreementmdjt2003 Full text of the 'Peace Agreement between the Government of Chad and  MDJT' signed in 2003, UN Peacemaker]\n*[http://peacemaker.un.org/chad-agreementmdjt2002 Full text of the 'Peace Agreement between the Government of Chad and  MDJT' signed in 2002, UN Peacemaker]"
