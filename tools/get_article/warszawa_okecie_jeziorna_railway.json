It primarily transports hard coal, fuel oil, and biomass to the Siekierki Cogeneration Plant plant in Warsaw.\nHistory\nThe first part of the line was opened as a siding on 1 October 1935 to serve a paper factory in Konstancin-Jeziorna. After World War II, the line was expanded to electric power plants in Piaseczno and the Siekierki Cogeneration Plant plant in Warsaw.\nProposal of passenger services\nSince 2008, there have been several proposals of bringing passenger services to the railway line, as it is currently only used by freight trains. Most recently, in May 2023, Polish State Railways proposed the construction of three new railway stations on the line: Piaseczno Śniadeckich, Konstancin Jeziorna and Konstancin-Jeziorna Mirkowska.\nOther times, during local elections, occasional railbus rides with the press took place, but no other actions aimed at implementing passenger services were taken.\nAnother proposal proposed the construction of five new railway stations in Nowa Iwiczna, Piaseczno, Julianów, Kierszek, and Jeziorna.\nReferences"
