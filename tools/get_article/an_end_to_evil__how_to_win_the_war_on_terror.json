The book was co-written by Richard Perle, who had previously been chairman of the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee, and David Frum, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.\nIn 2004, Frum replied to some of the critics of the book in \"He That Stands It Now...\", an article that appeared in the National Review.\nDanielle Pletka, a foreign policy analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, told The Jewish Daily Forward, \"The political prescriptions contained are terrific. This is a very thoughtful articulation of how to fight the battle ahead of us.\"\nPolitical scientist Fareed Zakaria said about the book: \"It is now possible to describe a neoconservative foreign policy, and David Frum and Richard Perle's new book, An End to Evil: How to Win the War on Terror, is a useful guide to it. There have been many books written by neoconservatives on aspects of the war on terror, but because of the identity of the authors, the scope of the book and the vigor of argumentation, this one deserves special attention.\"\nReviews\n*Kamiya, Gary, [https://web.archive.org/web/20081019235304/http://dir.salon.com/story/books/review/2004/01/30/frum_perle/index.html \"An End to Evil\" by David Frum and Richard Perle], salon.com book review, January 30, 2004\n*Buchanan, Pat, [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2004/mar/01/00006/ Review] , amconmag.com, March 1, 2004.\n*Kakutani, Michiku, [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/13/books/books-of-the-times-a-confident-prescription-for-foiling-the-terrorists.html?pagewanted=print \"A Confident Prescription For Foiling the Terrorists\"], The New York Times, January 13, 2004.\n*Riklin, Geoffrey, [http://www.intellectualconservative.com/article3243.html \"Book Review of An End to Evil: How to Win the War on Terror, by David Frum and Richard Perle\"] , The Intellectual Conservative Web site, 17 March 2004.\n* Hutchison, Harold C., [http://www.strategypage.com/bookreviews/250.asp \"An End To Evil: How to Win the War on Terror, by David Frum and Richard Perle\"], Strategy Page Web site.\n* Zakaria, Fareed, [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/08/books/showing-them-who-s-boss.html?pagewanted=print \"Showing Them Who's Boss\"], The New York Times Book Review.\n* Crock, Stan, [https://web.archive.org/web/20061110154527/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_05/b3868028_mz005.htm \"Two Jeremiads\"], Business Week, 2004-02-04.\n* Powers, Thomas.  \"An End to Evil: How to Win the War on Terror\".
