On the morning of the first day, Tuareg independence forces were successful in the Ambush of Tagarangabotte 50 kilometers east of Ansongo. However, the Islamist offensive was not stopped. According to a security source from Burkina Faso, the same day MUJAO attack elements of the MNLA in the village of Idelimane 80 kilometers from Ménaka, the last bastion of the MNLA. According to the same source, \"The Mujao has taken a lot of prisoners and taken two vehicles, there have been deaths.\"\nAccording to the Malian newspaper Le Combat, MUJAO's forces were made up of the Osama bin Laden brigade led by Abu Walid Sahraoui and reinforced by 300 AQIM fighters, including the Mokhtar's Al-Mouthalimin brigade (the turbaned ones). Belmokhtar brought 16 pickups, many equipped with heavy artillery. For its part, the MNLA claims to have clashed with 1,000 jihadists. Xinhua News Agency sources also stated the battle was being fought 80 kilometers from Ménaka and 70 kilometers from Ansongo.\nOn the 17th, the MUJAO forces receive reinforcements from AQIM troops. According to security sources in Mali, the MNLA was routed on November 17 with a loss of 10 killed.\nAftermath\nOn the 18th, Mossa Ag Attaher, in charge of Communication and Information of the MNLA, declared that \"the terrorist hordes were driven from the former army camp of the paratroopers of the Malian army that they tried to occupy and they (the terrorists) were forced to retreat into the Tidjefenes area.\" According to him, 12 Islamists were killed in this military camp. According to witnesses, 6 wounded MUJAO were sent to Gao Regional Hospital. Other testimonies mention dozens of deaths.\nA report is provided by various sources to the Xinhua News Agency, including men close to the International Committee of the Red Cross. According to these sources, the fighting killed more than 117 people by 17 November, 17 for MUJAO, including Abu Dardar, Emir of Ansongo, and over 100 for the MNLA. These figures, however, seem to reflect MUJAO's estimates of the losses of the Independents.\nAccording to residents of Gao, on 17 November, Abdoul Hakim, a commander of MUJAO, told Nata radio that his troops had lost 3 fighters and 6 seriously wounded against more than 100 dead for MNLA forces. Next, the Battle of Ménaka followed.\nReferences"
