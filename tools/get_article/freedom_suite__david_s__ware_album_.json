This is the most masterful of interpretations\".\nThe All About Jazz review noted \"The Freedom Suite is emotionally involving the whole way through. And after these forty minutes have passed, there's a palpable sense of calm and resolution. Perhaps that's a sign that Ware has managed to pass along some of his spiritual vision\".
