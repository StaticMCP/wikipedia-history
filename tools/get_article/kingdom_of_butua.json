Butua was renowned as the source of gold for Arab and Portuguese traders. The first written record of the kingdom came from Ahmad ibn Majid in 1502.\nThe kingdom was governed by the Torwa dynasty until 1683 from its capital at Khami. Around 1683, the kingdom was conquered by the Rozwi Empire.\nThe foundations of the Khami Ruins show a striking resemblance to the pattern of masonry at the base of the Zimbabwe Ruins.\nHistory\nFoundation and apogee\nKhami was originally a Leopard's Kopje site, whose inhabitants are thought to be the ancestors of the Kalanga (southwestern Shona). During the time of Great Zimbabwe's dominance over the region, various offshoots split from it to form various states, one such state being the Mutapa Empire. In the early 15th century Angoche traders opened a new route along the Zambezi via the nascent Mutapa Empire and Ingombe Ilede to reach the goldfields west of Great Zimbabwe, bypassing it. Close to the goldfields, a local Leopard's Kopje chiefdom centred on Khami rose to prominence, contributing to Great Zimbabwe's decline. This was the Kingdom of Butua, with its first mambo (king) Madabhale of the Torwa dynasty, who had the praise name Chibundule (meaning \"sounding of the war horn\"). Kalanga oral traditions collected in 1922 compress the history of the Torwa dynasty into that of one ruler called Chibundule, such that the story of Chibundule represents that of Butua.}}\nButua rapidly grew in size and wealth, and came to border the Mutapa Empire along the Sanyati River.}} There appear to have been intermarriages between the Torwa dynasty and the Nembire dynasty of Mutapa. Changamire I, who rebelled against and ruled Mutapa from 1490-1494, was likely a member of both dynasties, and was possibly supported by the Torwa, with his descendants founding the Rozvi Empire. In 1493, the mambo gifted the Mwenemutapa (Mutapa king) 4000 cows and copious amounts of gold. The first written record of Butua came from Ahmad ibn Majid in 1502, who mentioned \"Munhu Butua\" (\"King of Butua\"). Due to tales such as that already mentioned, the Portuguese referred to Butua as the \"Mother of Gold\". The Portuguese traded far into the interior via African merchants, who were noted for their honesty. The Kalanga of Butua were reportedly not war-like (said to rely more on faith in Mwari), and the mambo only mobilised his army in times of war. Women accompanied the army and cooked for them.\nInternal conflict and Portuguese invasion\nIn the 1640s, a dispute between the mambo and his brother escalated. The brother had married into a powerful family of Shona-speaking Muslim traders (called Mwenye), and with the Mwenye's support he forced the mambo into exile in Manyika. With the support of a Portuguese prazo-holder and his army, the mambo returned in 1644 and was reinstated. The prazo-holder left soldiers behind in the capital, however he was killed on the way to Manyika, after which the soldiers withdrew. Historian Malyin Newitt writes that Butua was too remote for Portuguese influence to last, however the episode bolstered Portuguese confidence that they could expand into the interior and conquer Mutapa.\nRozvi conquest\nAround 1683 Butua was conquered by Changamire Dombo, who is thought to have either been head of the Mwenemutapa's royal cattle herd, which he used to gain influence, or the leader of Mutapa's army, dispatched to Rozvi}} territory (the northeast) where he became leader of the Rozvi and rebelled. In the northeast, a European-introduced epidemic and famine had swept through the region, and there was likely anger about the Mwenemutapa selling gold-producing land to the Portuguese as prazos, dispossessing Karanga families. The Portuguese also dealt directly with chiefs' subjects, disrupting the hierarchical system, with this all propelling Rozvi out-migration. The Portuguese's withdrawal from Butua had likely left the Torwa mambo with little support, possibly compounded by his failure to bring rain amid a drought.\nRozvi traditions mention two rulers or royal lineages in Butua, Chibundule and Tumbare, while Kalanga traditions' only mention of Tumbare is as Chief Councillor for Changamire, however say Tumbare's father tried to take control of Butua three times. Catharina Van Waarden considers the Tumbare lineage to have aided Changamire in his conquest. Kalanga traditions detail a large battle taking place, ending in Chibundule's defeat, after which he is said to have left for the Matombo a Bhuba mountains and disappeared. Certainly by his death in 1696, Changamire controlled all of Butua's territory. Changamire founded the Rozvi Empire with its capital at Dhlo-Dhlo, and used Butua as his base to expand into Manyika and Uteve in the 1680s, defeating the Portuguese and expelling Portuguese traders.He also attacked Mutapa in 1693, leading to the overthrow of its ruler. Some of the original inhabitants of Butua (now called the Lilima, a Kalanga sub-group) migrated into north-eastern Botswana.\nChangamire's dynasty continued to rule in Butua, until it was destroyed during the 1830s amid the Ngoni invasions.\nGovernment\nThe mambo had various Councillors (bakadzaxa or makulukota, one of which was head of the royal herds of cattle), minor councillors (basungwaxa), and royal advisors (machinda). He also had a Great Diviner (''ng'anga), one of their tasks was rainmaking. Roles were likely hereditary. The mambo had multiple residences for security reasons, with oral traditions mentioning five in and around the Matopos Hills. Cattle played an important role in politics, and the mambo'' owned many. The government's tribute was collected by sub-chiefs from their people, and gifts were likely distributed, often in the form of loans of cattle.\nAccording to Rozvi traditions the Torwa dynasty had the totem of the monkey. Traditions collected in 1922 claim the kingdom covered the territory from Great Zimbabwe to the Makgadikgadi Pan, south to the Crocodile River, and north to the Zambezi, however other traditions say the mambo ruled from Gweru to the Motloutse River.\nSociety and culture\nCeremonies were held at Khami where people prayed to Mwari for rain. Men sought to marry many wives and have as many children as possible. Produce, skins, and copper could be used to buy cattle and goats, which could then be used to acquire wives. Women sewed skins and furs into blankets, and copper was mined to make jewellery. Gold was mined in people's spare time, usually before planting season. Having a large amount of cattle symbolised high status, and were sought after in order to enlarge one's family.\nKhami features monumental stone structures, which likely symbolised prestige, with reports that the stones were brought to Khami and laboured on as tribute (a service called zhunde). Khami's royal palace resembles Leopard's Kopje architecture (specifically Woolandale).\nAfter Changamire's conquest of Butua, the Rozvi did not allow the Portuguese to enter its territory, however they allowed African merchants hired by the Portuguese, termed mussambazes, to trade in Butua.\nEconomy\nCattle were abundant in Butua, and were an important component of its economy. Cattle were also likely used for loans (a practice called kusaidza). The person who received the loan (kuronzera) could use the cattle as they saw fit and sell its produce, however they could not dispose of them without the owner's permission. The relationship between owner and kuronzera resembled one of vassalage, and served to distribute food and wealth, with the mambo owning most cattle. Despite Butua's fame for gold, Portuguese reports say that its people had little interest in gold mining, and focussed primarily on cattle.\nGallery\nFile:Khamiruins1.jpg|The ruins of Khami, capital of the Butua Kingdom.\nFile:Khamiruins2.jpg|Steps leading into the ancient city of Khami\nFile:Khamiruins3.jpg|The outer wall of Khami\nSee also\n*Torwa dynasty\n*Rozwi Empire\n*Naletale\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*"
