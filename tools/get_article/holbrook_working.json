He taught at Cornell University and the University of Minnesota before he joined Stanford's Food Research Institute in 1925. His younger brother Elmer Working made a major contribution on the identification problem for demand curves in econometrics, with which Holbrook Working was also involved.\nWorking disagreed with Keynes's backwardation theory of futures prices, which argued that short hedgers (farmers) drive down futures prices because of their demand for price insurance. Working argued that there could be hedgers on both sides of the market and that hedging was essentially not a risk reduction technique, but \"speculation in the basis\" which allows informed traders and commodity dealers to profit from their knowledge of future changes in the difference between futures and spot prices.\nHe was a founding member of the Econometric Society and was elected a Fellow of the American Agricultural Economics Association, the American Statistical Association, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  In 1981 he was awarded the Wilks Memorial Award by the American Statistical Association.\nHe died on October 5, 1985, in Santa Clara, California.\nSee also\n*Working–Hotelling procedure\nNotable papers\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences"
