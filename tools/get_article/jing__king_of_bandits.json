The series was originally serialized in Kodansha's Comic Bom Bom magazine from 1995 to 1998; the publisher later collected the individual chapters into seven tankōbon volumes. The series continued in Kodansha's  Magazine Z in 1999, under the title KING OF BANDIT JING, known as Jing: King of Bandits: Twilight Tales outside of Japan and ran until finishing in 2005. The story revolves around a teenage boy named Jing who despite his young age is known as the \"King of Bandits\". Along with his partner Kir, a talking albatross, he travels the world in search of new adventures and legendary treasure. Throughout the series the duo manage to pull off impossible heists and outwit countless enemies that stand in their way.\nJing: King of Bandits features a motif in the form of references to alcohol. Volumes of the manga are \"bottles\", episodes and chapters are \"shots\", Jing and Kir's special attack is a \"Kir Royal\", and almost every character and location is named after an alcoholic beverage or cocktail.\nIn 2002, five of the original seven manga volumes were adapted into an anime television series that totaled 13 episodes. Produced by Aniplex and animated by Studio Deen, the TV series aired on NHK from May 15, 2002 to August 14, 2002. The two studios went on to produce a three part original video animation that adapted the fourth volume of the original manga in 2004 under the title . Tokyopop licensed both the original manga and Twilight Tales for English-language releases in North America, while ADV Films handled the licensing of the anime series and the Seventh Heaven original video animation.\nSynopsis\nKing of Bandits Jing is a series of short, usually disconnected stories starring the young boy who calls himself Jing, the Bandit King. Although Jing's reputation seems to extend throughout the universe of the series, many enemies underestimate him, not expecting the \"great\" King of Bandits to be a \"little kid\".\nThe stories vary a great deal, especially between the initial manga series and the sequel series, Jing: King of Bandits: Twilight Tales. In the initial series, stories often border on comical and cartoonish. Each arc includes a new treasure or object that Jing is seeking, a woman or girl who accompanies him somewhere along the way on his quest for this item, and an enemy that either wants to protect what it is he intends to steal, or get to it before he does. Settings also vary; Jing travels to a clockwork city, a desert with living lava, and even deliberately gets himself arrested to steal something from inside a maximum security prison, among other fantastic locales. He always escapes in the end of each arc, and always manages to steal his target, although not always in the way that the characters or the reader expects. Each arc also features the upset of some restrictive societal norm thanks to Jing's intervention; rulers are dethroned, prison riots are caused, an entire corrupt religion is reduced to shambles.\nTwilight Tales also ran seven volumes. Jing no longer manages to steal every treasure he sets out after in the arcs. In Twilight Tales, more often than not, Jing actually winds up fighting the sought object, or having to destroy it in some way. There is also a short arc featuring Jing's past. In both these childhood arcs, Jing is already calling himself the King of Bandits.  There is no fixed ending for either series.\nCharacters\n;\n:\n:He is the protagonist of the series and The Bandit Boy Wonder. A young black haired thief in a flowing orange trenchcoat, his exceptional skills and dedication are seemingly contradicted by his laid-back manner. He approaches life with a disarming, confident cheerfulness, selecting his targets seemingly on a whim. Because he is such a legendary figure, many people are surprised when they meet him in person, as he is rather small and unassuming at first glance. His skills as a thief, however, are without equal. He travels the world with his best friend, Kir, a talking albatross bird with whom he can combine to unleash the deadly Kir Royale attack, which is a green ball of energy shot out of Kir's mouth. He also holds a hidden retractable knife in his right sleeve and usually uses it when the Kir Royale would be a waste; its worth noting that the knife goes through a small handful of 'upgrades:' as a boy, it seemingly hid oversized kitchen utensils, in the primary series it becomes a simple slightly curved single edged knife, and by the time of Twilight Tales - it is a full blown double-edged blade almost the size of a short sword. He isn't restricted to this however, as he also seems to be capable of turning anything into a weapon, such as wires as seen when he traps attack dogs or an umbrella he uses to diffuse a Kir Royale blast. That said though, his single greatest weapon is his mind - although never really highlighted, Jing is an extremely keen analyst, almost impossibly clever in executing his plans, and most importantly - has a talent for improvising when something actually doesn't work out his way (a rarity in itself). Strangely, his single greatest treasure is a simple green necklace, which never truly has its purpose revealed.\n;\n:\n:He is Jing's sidekick and partner in crime, a feisty talking avian with a big mouth. Despite being a bird, he is constantly chasing human women and usually hits on each episode's Jing Girl at every opportunity. Nonetheless, he is always rejected (curiously, the rejection is always due to his mannerisms and personality, and not the fact that he is a bird). Kir is a bit greedier than Jing and often wonders why the latter doesn't go after targets with more monetary value. Nonetheless, he is a steadfast friend and invaluable partner to Jing. As noted, Kir is Jing's primary source of firepower - when fused onto his right arm, he can fire a large ball of energy aptly named 'Kir Royale,' although seemingly infinite in power - Kir has shown exhaustion over firing too many in a sequence. In this fused form, Kir can also grant Jing some limited flight. In a certain chapter involving a porvora delivery, it is seen for the first and only time that Kir is not unique to his species; mines around the world that Jing takes place make full use of these birds for demolition purposes - as such, the question is whether or not the Kir Royale is any stronger than that of his brethren's blasts.\n;\n:\n:He is the only other recurring character, and is a good example of the series' surreal tone. Postino is a mail carrier who travels by motorcycle, and whose route seems to include the entire world. He appears, seemingly on cue, at some point in each episode just as Jing is in need of help. He drives up, delivers a clue or plot exposition, and then drives away, and is not seen again for the remainder of the story. Postino is both a parody of Deus ex machina plot devices, and an example of the surreal and sometimes illogical world which Jing inhabits. Postino appeared only once in the original manga, in the \"Amarcord\" story. He appears twice in the Twilight Tales series, once in volume one, and once in volume five.\nMedia\nManga\nOriginal series\n|}\nTwilight Tales\n|}\nAnime\nAnime episodes\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"98%\"\n|-\n! # !!

The Double Mermaid is kept at the top of a large tower that the tyrant in charge of the town has constructed. Many thieves have died trying to get to the top of this tower. Eventually Jing is able to make a giant bird angry enough to grow wings and fly him to the top of the tower. The item that Jing steals is the jewel that was created by the mother's and daughter's tears mingled together.\n| LineColor           =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = The second episode involves a trip to a town called Blue Hawaii and a rumored Ghost Ship that lies off its coast. The ship in reality is a casino powered by greed and desire, whose power source Jing steals. The Jing girl in this episode is Rose the daughter of Chief Police in the city, and whose father is trapped in the Casino of Greed. In the casino/boat Jing and Kir amass a lot of money, winning every game they participate in. Eventually the operator of this casino takes notice to them. Jing ends up figuring out that the casino's inhabitants are in reality lost souls consumed by greed and trapped in the gold coins. He defeats the gold coins because as the King of Bandits he is able to control his own desires and not fuel their power. This is apparently the source of Jing's true power as the bandit king. At the end of the episode Rose gives Jing a kiss.

Jing and Kir defeat the guards at the entrance and rescue a girl named Mirabelle from being executed. The main crime in this town is being late. If you are 5 seconds late, the punishment is execution. After they save Mirabelle they are chased by the Master of the town. Mirabelle saves them by showing them to a place called Neverland for refugees.\n| LineColor           =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = This is the second part of the two-part chapter in Jing: King of Bandits. Mirabelle brought the two to the Neverland and as turns out, are being hunted by Adonis, wanted for many time-related crimes. Jing devised a plan to infiltrate the castle and stop the time clock, thus, stealing Adonis's \"time\". In the end Adonis was put to an end and Jing got to try the Pure \"Clockwork Grape\".\n| LineColor           =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = The fifth episode has Jing and Kir help a young daughter of an artist complete his final work of art before his death.\n| LineColor           =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Jing and Kir start off by crashing the party of a baby prince at his castle and soon hear about a city, Reviva, whose people hold the secret to eternal life. The two set off with this episode's Jing-girl, Vermouth, to find the city. They are pursued the entire time by a duo also seeking the secret to eternal life, a scholar called Pernod (eerily similar to Malcolm MacDowell in the movie Clockwork Orange) and his well-built lackey, China Lilet. They pursue the three at a distance most of the time and more often than not just follow in the footsteps of Jing when solving puzzles or overcoming obstacles. The episode closes, to be continued in episode 7, shortly after Jing and his companions battle a skeleton who is cursed to drink wine for all eternity, only to have it spill back into the barrel again. The skeleton thanks them for freeing him from his curse and goes to spread his cape and stand on a small boat to act as a sail.\nPostino's Riddle: \"Yeah, I deliver letters for them sometimes. But you know, I've never seen an obituary come out of that town.\"\n| LineColor           =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Jing, Kir and Vermouth continue on their sail boat to the city of Reviva, which has long been abandoned by its citizens and is inhabited only by the king, who still guards the water of eternal life. He congratulates Jing, whom he calls \"The Minstrel,\" for coming so far and tells him of his plan to make Jing the new king of Reviva. Vermouth is injured in a battle with Leviathon, a giant fish that the king has been pursuing for ages, and is, to the great surprise of Jing and Kir, repaired by the king. The king apparently constructed her for the purpose of finding a new king. Jing and his companions are then drawn into battle with the scholar and his lackey, who has been modified by the scholar with robotic parts and a remote-control. In the end, the scholar and his lackey are tangled up and forced into becoming part of a perpetual motion machine and Jing pours out the water of eternal life, stating that shining for only a second is better than living a dull grey life for all of eternity.\nPostino's Riddle: None, this episode is the second in a series. See Episode 6.\n| LineColor           =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Jing and Kir go on a quest to find the lost Sun Stone and pick up a shipment of two Por Vora along the way. In addition to dangerous and magical environments, the Por Vora are explosive. Jing and Kir hook up with this episode's Jing-girl, Izarra, and just narrowly make it to their destination, Sungria, with just one Por Vora. The other sacrifices itself to save the others. Jing uses his typically inexplicable knowledge of treasure to reveal the Sun Stone using the Mercury Stone to activate it. Izarra adopts the Por Vora as Jing and Kir vanish into the clouds, hitching a ride on the rising Sun Stone.\nPostino's Riddle: \"I'm not permitted to handle dangerous creatures like the Por Vora. I'm prohibited from delivering radioactive or poisonous cargo.\" ''This is not necessarily a riddle, but reinstates what has already been mentioned about the Por Vora's dangerous nature.''\n| LineColor           =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Jing and Kir travel to the musical island of Coco-Oco. At the beginning of the episode, Kir becomes irritated with Jing and goes off on his own. Kir almost drowns but is saved by Mimosa, this episode's Jing girl. Jing goes off on his own to investigate the rumor of the Ocarina of the Moon. Mimosa goes to a cave on the island to watch the guy she likes called Russian playing a flute. Most of the rest of the episode is spent developing her character and their relation. At the end of the episode, Kir gets Jing to show up to save Russian from the collapsed cave, where all four find that the Ocarina of the Moon was in fact the moon shining beautifully through the cave like music. Mimosa and Russian have a cute little scene at the end and Kir and Jing settle their argument. Jing reflects that \"this is one thing we can never steal\". Jing and Kir leave on the train heading for Zaza.\n| LineColor           =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Jing finds the secret Por Vora city Bluwari and is invited to stay there forever but he declines. A trio of criminals infiltrate the building and hack into a room 'that should not be opened' and thus the self-destruct mechanism was turned on to ensure that the Por Vora secret never leaked out.\n| LineColor           =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Jing and Kir are in ZaZa planning to attend what was thought of as a masquerade ball, but it turns out the sign read \"Mas Corrida\", and corrida is a bullfighting term. Suddenly, Jing and Kir are in the middle of a nationwide masked gladiator tournament to determine the new Earl of ZaZa and receive the Vintage Smile, a pearl white mask Jing came to steal. Jing finds out from Angostura Sr., that Madame DuBonnet didn't mourn for the loss of her husband, but was severely crushed when her only son, Lemon, was murdered by his uncle. The Madame grew cold and heartless, and ordered these tournaments to force everyone to fight until no warrior is left standing. Her main targets are the D'Ice Brothers: Baffle, Crash and Cube, the three who assassinated Lemon. After humiliating an opponent in true bandit fashion, Jing witnesses Cube's devastating defeat at the hands of a mysterious warrior in blood-red armor and demon motifs.\n| LineColor           =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Jing has advanced into the Black Corrida, which is the final stages of battle. During the time, more plotting from the D'Ice Brothers are in the works to take the role of Earl by force, while Jing plots his own caper. Miss Stir unexpectedly comes across Jing while walking through the palace, but she didn't notice him as the King of Bandits. After defeating Crash, Jing finds himself surrounded by all three D'Ice Brothers, but one Kir Royale later and the brothers get blasted. Having escaped the D'Ice Brothers' wrath, Jing finds himself face to face with the demonic warrior who brutalized Cube who is simply known as \"The Warrior of the Rising Son\".\n| LineColor           =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = The fight continued on until the night with Jing and the red-armored warrior matching each other blow for blow. Just as Jing disarms the warrior's sword, Cube smashes the warrior to gain vengeance. The armor shatters and to everyone's shock, it revealed Miss Stir! Before anyone can act, Jing carried Stir and jumped towards the Madame's balcony so she can rest. Baffle suddenly captures Jing and hopes to execute him, but Angostura halts Baffle letting him know the law in ZaZa. Jing, ever so crafty, decides to have one more battle with Baffle. However, before the match, he switched masks and clothes with Angostura in order to reach Stir and the Vintage Smile. During Stir's rest, the cold-hearted Madame cried and took off her mask revealing her face. Then, everything in ZaZa was back to normal. Jing got the Vintage Smile while his friend Ginjou got everything else. However, Baffle was on Jing's trail and Jing finally put an end to the D'Ice Brothers' evil with a Kir Royale blast. Afterwards, Kir started to get that look in Jing's eye that something happened between him and Stir. When the masquerade ball was back to dancing instead of fighting, Stir put off every man who wanted to dance with her so she can save the first dance for Jing.\n| LineColor           =\n}}\n|}\nJing, King of Bandits: Seventh Heaven OVA episodes\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"98%\"\n|-\n! # !!

Animefringe called the manga imaginative and humorous. Allen Divers felt the series played its one trick pony to the hilt and had generic artwork. Jeffrey Harris of IGN praised the story of Jing's past. A review in The Escapist complained about static characters, flimsy plot, and poorly-directed action sequences. Theron Martin praised the OVA series for its creative visual design and energetic musical score. Jonathan Clements noted that Jing was a series \"which nobody really watched\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050206205124/http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/Animation/jing/ Official Aniplex Jing: King of Bandits website]\n*"
