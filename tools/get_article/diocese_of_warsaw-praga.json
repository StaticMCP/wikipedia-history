He conserves his personal title of archbishop.\nNotable churches\nCathedral Basilica of St. Michael the Archangel and St. Florian\n*Minor Basilicas:\n** Bazylika Najświętszego Serca Jezusowego in Praga (Sacred Heart)\n** Bazylika Trójcy Przenajświętszej in Kobyłka (Holy Trinity)\nLeadership\n* Bishops of Warszawa-Praga (Roman rite)\n** Bishop Kazimierz Romaniuk (1992–2004)\n** Archbishop Sławoj Leszek Głódź (2004–2008)\n** Archbishop Henryk Hoser (2008-2017)\n** Bishop Romuald Kamiński (since 2017)\nSex abuse reports\nOn September 27, 2018, Bishop Romuald Kamiński apologized for the history of sex abuse of minors in the Diocese. He also stated that work on a document addressing the Polish Catholic Church on the abuse of minors and suggesting ways to prevent it was completed. Archbishop Wojciech Polak, who serves as the Primate of Poland, also stated this document would also contain data on the sexual abuse committed by Catholic clergy in Poland. Statistics were released on 14 April 2019, commissioned by the Episcopal Conference of Poland and with data from over 10,000 local parishes. It was found that from 1990 to mid-2018, abuse reports about 382 priests were made to the Church, with 625 children, mostly under 16, sexually abused by members of the Catholic clergy. There were opinions that the figures underestimated the extent of the problem, and failed to answer questions church officials had avoided for years. Marek Lisinski, the co-founder of Don’t Be Afraid, which represents victims of clerical abuse, said \"Tell us how [the priests] hurt those children and how many times they were transferred to different parishes before you paid notice\". The data were released a few weeks after Pope Francis had called for \"an all-out battle against the abuse of minors\". After pressure from the Pope, in the preceding years Poland's church had publicly apologized to abuse victims, and accepted the need to report those accused of such crimes. In earlier times clergy to whom sexual abuse of minors was reported were not required by their superiors to notify the police, but to investigate themselves, and if necessary, inform the Vatican.\nSee also\n*Roman Catholicism in Poland\nSources\n* [http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/wars1.htm GCatholic.org]\n* [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dwapr.html Catholic Hierarchy]\n* [http://www.diecezja.waw.pl/   Diocese website]\nReferences"
