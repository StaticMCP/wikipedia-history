Initially inspired by Congress-led nonviolent movements, he later joined the revolutionary underground under Purna Chandra Das of the Madaripur Group. Following Das's arrest in 1930, Manoranjan led operations, organizing swadeshi dacoities to fund anti-colonial activities. On 14 March 1932, during a mail robbery at the Charmugria post office, a scuffle led to fatal gunfire. Captured by locals, he was tried and sentenced to death. Manoranjan was executed on 22 August 1932 at Barisal District Jail, becoming one of Bengal’s lesser-known martyrs in the struggle for Indian independence movement.\nEarly life and education\nManoranjan Bhattacharya was born on 21 July 1909 in the village of Erikathi, located in the Idilpur pargana of Faridpur district, then part of the Madaripur subdivision in British India (present-day Bangladesh). He hailed from a conservative \"Barendra\" Brahmin family known for its strict adherence to orthodox Hindu customs. His father, Kaliprasanna Bhattacharya, was a devout and principled man, and the family maintained rigid boundaries with regard to caste, religion, and social practices.\nIn accordance with the family's traditional values, Manoranjan's early education was confined to religious teachings and the study of Sanskrit. The household, like many Brahmin families in the area, viewed Western-style education—particularly English instruction—with suspicion and disapproval. Social interaction beyond the caste circle was rare, and cultural orthodoxy dominated daily life.\nA turning point came with the return of Manoranjan’s uncle, an English-educated employee of the Assam Railway Company. Although not fully accepted within the family due to his adoption of Western habits, the uncle strongly advocated for modern education. After some resistance, Manoranjan’s parents agreed to enroll him in Koneshwar High English School. This marked his first formal exposure to English education and the beginning of his intellectual awakening.\nDespite Erikathi’s small size, the village fostered a vibrant intellectual and political atmosphere. During the First World War, several local youths were arrested under the Defense of India Act for revolutionary activities. These individuals later established the Erikathi Boys Library, which became a cultural hub promoting literature, physical training, and public service. Manoranjan’s involvement with the library exposed him to nationalist literature and reformist ideas, which played a formative role in shaping his later revolutionary path.\nYouth Activities and Community Engagement\nDuring his school years, Manoranjan Bhattacharya became closely involved with the Erikathi Boys' Library, a dynamic cultural and social institution that played a pivotal role in the political awakening of rural Faridpur. Despite the village’s seasonal isolation due to monsoon flooding, Bhattacharya regularly visited the library—sometimes rowing a small boat or swimming across waterlogged paths with only a towel around his waist. His commitment earned him widespread respect among his peers and elders.\nBhattacharya gained recognition for his public recitations of revolutionary poetry, delivered with great emotional intensity. Verses such as “ওরে সবুজ, ওরে আমার কাঁচা / আধমরাদের ঘা মেরে তুই বাঁচা” and “এ দারুণ উপপ্লবের দিনে আমরা দাঁড়ি শির / মোদের মাঝে মুক্তি কাঁদে বিংশ শতাব্দীর” became closely associated with his performances at cultural events.\nThe Erikathi Boys’ Library also hosted an annual Shakti Puja, a covertly organized event imbued with nationalist undertones. These gatherings featured martial arts demonstrations, including stick and dagger fights, alongside poetry recitations, debates, and patriotic songs. Bhattacharya actively led many of these segments, helping to instill nationalist consciousness among the youth.\nThe library also ran a social service wing to aid the sick and elderly. Bhattacharya once volunteered to care for the ailing son of a village barber suffering from typhoid, defying caste taboos and familial opposition. His stance—that such regressive customs must be challenged—left a lasting impression on the community.\nHe played a vital role in developing the institution. During an annual meeting, Bhattacharya proposed constructing a new tin-roofed building with a reading room and debate hall. His detailed plan was approved, and he became secretary of the library while still in Class 10. Through youth-organized labor and service contracts, funds were raised, culminating in the library’s successful expansion—an enduring example of grassroots leadership.\nPolitical awakening & Early activism\nIn 1928, the Erikathi Boys' Library received a book titled Bolshevism, published by Basumati Sahitya Mandir and sent by former village students residing in Kolkata. This was Manoranjan Bhattacharya’s first encounter with terms like “Lenin” and “Bolshevism.” Although the book portrayed Bolsheviks critically—as cannibals and German agents—it sparked his interest in revolutionary ideologies. Prior to this, the library's collection included works on the French Revolution, the Easter Rising, Sinn Féin, Mazzini, Garibaldi, Russian Nihilists, and anarchists such as Kropotkin, but had limited material on socialism and communism.\nAround the same time, Bhattacharya deepened his commitment to public service. When a cholera outbreak struck the nearby village of Kalurga, he was requested by Saran Basu, assistant headmaster of Koneshwar High School and a former Yugantar revolutionary, to lead relief efforts. Bhattacharya and his team tended to the sick, cleaned affected areas, and performed cremations, witnessing firsthand the devastation caused by the epidemic. Reflecting on the tragedy, he remarked, “There is death in war, but this procession of death from disease does not happen in a free nation. Subjugation is our curse,” reinforcing his anti-colonial resolve.\nIn 1924, at age fifteen, Bhattacharya secretly left his village to attend the provincial Congress Conference in Faridpur, chaired by Chittaranjan Das. There, he met poet Kazi Nazrul Islam and gained acclaim for reciting revolutionary songs, including Nazrul’s “Bolo bhai māvoi māvoi” and the poem “Truth, alas, is slain by the tyrant’s sword.” He also sold banned literature such as The Student Society of China by Priyanath Ganguly.\nAfter passing matriculation in 1926, Bhattacharya trained in telegraphy in Assam and secured employment at the Railway Telegraph Office in Dhaka. There, he joined the political group Sang Maing Sang (“Equality, Friendship, Freedom”), which introduced him to Marxism, Leninism, and the Russian Revolution. Though not formally linked to the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association, his political views were influenced by their ideology.\nWhile recovering from malaria during a visit home, Bhattacharya held secret meetings where banned revolutionary writings circulated. He organized a student strike against the Simon Commission, marking his entry into active resistance and earning him a local reputation as a “Swadeshi.”\nManoranjan Bhattacharya’s family arranged his marriage to Nirupama Devi to deter his revolutionary activities. Despite his objections and illness during the wedding in Tangail, the marriage took place. He never accepted it or lived with her, but reportedly felt remorse about the relationship during imprisonment. From prison, he sent Nirupama a letter quoting Rabindranath Tagore’s poem:\n“In this vast universe, spanning heaven and earth,\nA deep cry echoes, ‘I won’t let you go.’\nAlas, yet one must let go, and they depart.”\nInvolvement in revolutionary activities\nIn 1929, Manoranjan Bhattacharya attended a youth conference held in Gohala, Faridpur. Accompanied by six associates, he traveled to Madaripur with the objective of engaging in strategic discussions with fellow revolutionaries. This event marked another step in Bhattacharya’s increasing involvement in the anti-colonial struggle.\nBeyond his participation in organized politics, Bhattacharya played a significant role in grassroots social reform and village development. His work extended far beyond the Erikathi Boys’ Library; he led initiatives in public health, education, and youth mobilization. Bhattacharya actively challenged entrenched social norms, advocating for inter-caste service, secular values, and scientific education.\nFollowing the arrest of revolutionary leader Purna Chandra Das in 1930, Manoranjan Bhattacharya assumed leadership of the Madaripur revolutionary group.\nPost office dacoity and arrest\nFollowing the arrest of revolutionary leader Purna Das in 1930, Manoranjan Bhattacharya assumed leadership of the Madaripur revolutionary group. Under his direction, the group continued organizing swadeshi dacoities to raise funds for anti-colonial activities. On 14 March 1932, during an attempted mailbag robbery at the Charmugria Post Office in Madaripur, a confrontation occurred. In the ensuing scuffle with the post office chowkidar, Bhattacharya fired his revolver, resulting in the death of two individuals.\nBhattacharya and his associates were captured by local residents and handed over to the British authorities. Following a swift trial, he was sentenced to death. His co-accused—Suren Kar and Jageshwar Das—received sentences of transportation for life, while Jogesh Chatterjee was sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment.\nDeath\nOn 22 August 1932, Manoranjan Bhattacharya was executed by hanging in Barisal District Jail. His execution occurred during a wave of revolutionary activities inspired by the Chittagong Armoury Raid, and he became the third Bengali revolutionary to be executed in quick succession after Dinesh Gupta (7 July 1931) and Ramkrishna Biswas (4 August 1931).\nOn the morning of his execution, thousands of people gathered outside the Barisal Jail, led by local activist Monorama Basu, to pay homage. The British authorities, fearing unrest, denied the release of Bhattacharya’s body to the public. His cremation was conducted under heavy security within the jail premises, and his body was not returned to his family despite formal requests. In response, the people of Barisal observed a day of mourning known as Arandhan—a symbolic protest during which households refrained from cooking food.\nLegacy\nManoranjan Bhattacharya is remembered as a committed revolutionary and social reformer. His final meeting with his family before execution was marked by composure and stoicism. To his grieving parents and wife, he reportedly said, “Do not grieve, do not weep. This is not a death to mourn but a glory to celebrate.”\nBhattacharya’s death stirred public sentiment and further galvanized anti-colonial resistance in Bengal. Though less well known than some of his contemporaries, his contributions to the freedom struggle—through both militant activities and grassroots mobilization—remain significant in the history of the Indian independence movement.\nReferences"
