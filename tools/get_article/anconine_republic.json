It came about after a French victory at Ancona in February 1797, and the consequent occupation of the city. It existed in the region of Marche, with Ancona serving as its capital. Despite the Treaty of Campo Formio stating that Ancona and the surrounding region had to be returned to the Papal States, the municipality proclaimed the decadence of papal rule, under French protection. The subsequent tension led to general conflict with Pope Pius VI and the French occupation of the whole of the Papal States. Ancona was incorporated into the Roman Republic on 7 March 1798. It had a consul as its head.\nAncona is now a province of Italy, in the central part of the country on the Adriatic Sea.\nReferences"
