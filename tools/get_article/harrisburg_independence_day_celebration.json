It is the state's largest Independence Day weekend music festival.\nFestivities take place along Riverfront Park and City Island and consist of street concerts, food and craft vendors, a wine/beer garden, amusement rides and a large fireworks display.\nHistory\nThe festival's name has changed across the years, from \"The Harrisburg Independence Weekend Festival\" to \"American MusicFest\" in 1999, to \"Harrisburg Jazz & Multi-Cultural Festival\" by Mayor Linda D. Thompson in 2010, then \"Harrisburg's Fourth of July Celebration\" in 2013 under Mayor Eric Papenfuse, \"Harrisburg Independence Weekend Walkaround\" for 2014, and finally Harrisburg's \"Taste of Independence\" from 2015, where it became a food truck festival.\nThe 2020 celebration was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the fireworks show was still presented. The event returned in 2021 for one day as \"July 4th Food Trucks & Fireworks.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://harrisburgpa.gov/special-events/ Harrisburg Special Events]"
