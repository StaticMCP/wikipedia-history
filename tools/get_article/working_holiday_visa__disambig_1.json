A working holiday visa enables holders to experience living in a foreign country without having to find work sponsorship in advance or go on an expensive university exchange program. Working holidays are commonly mentioned in backpacker literature due to the groups sharing some similarities.\nMost working holiday visas are offered under reciprocal agreements between certain countries to encourage travel and cultural exchange between their citizens.\nIn some countries there is growing criticism around working holiday visas because governments are increasingly linking them to labour strategies rather than centring cultural exchange. This is often achieved by tweaking mobility infrastructures such as visa rules to direct working holiday makers toward certain regions and jobs. This often increases working holiday makers' precarity which can make them more vulnerable to harms such as exploitation and sexual harassment.\nThere are often several restrictions on this type of visa:\n* Many are intended for young travellers and, as such, have an age restriction (usually from 18 to 30 or 35).\n* There are usually limits on the type of employment taken or the time the traveller can be employed.\n* The visa holder is expected to have sufficient funds to live on while seeking employment.\n* The visa holder should have some kind of health or travel insurance for the duration of the stay unless the country will cover it.\nStates offering working holiday visas\nAsia\nHong Kong\nHong Kong Special Administrative Region government has the working holiday visa agreements with Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea, Sweden and the United Kingdom.\nAgree to hold medical and comprehensive hospitalisation and liability insurance Separately, Hong Kong residents 18 to 30 ages who are British National (Overseas) can apply for UK Youth Mobility Scheme without sponsors.\nIndia\nIn the context of the Australia-India Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement, Australia has agreed to extend access to the Work and Holiday (subclass 462) visa to up to 1,000 Indian citizens each year.\nWithin two years, Australia will put in place arrangements to allow eligible Indian citizens aged between 18 and 30 to apply for a Work and Holiday visa to visit Australia for one year and undertake short-term work and study while holidaying.\nAs part of a new agreement with India, the UK government has agreed (albeit in a non-binding agreement) to participate in a scheme aimed at allowing increased mobility for a limited number of young people between India and the UK.
