She is Professor Emerita of Psychiatry and Neurobehavioral Sciences at University of Virginia (UVA) and affiliated with Park Dietz & Associates, Inc., a nationwide, interdisciplinary forensic expert firm.\nEducation\nWarren earned her Bachelor of Arts in Social Work from the University of Manitoba in 1973 and pursued further studies there, acquiring her Master of Arts in Social Work in 1975.  Warren received the University of Manitoba Graduate Fellowship for her excellent academic work and research potential during her graduate studies at the University of Manitoba. This important award goes to students who show remarkable academic performance and promise in their field. She subsequently attended the University of California Berkeley for her doctoral studies, where she received her Ph.D. in Social Welfare. Additionally, Warren received Adult Psychoanalysis accreditation from the Contemporary Freudian Society in 2001.\nCareer\nWarren is known for her contributions to conducting training on forensic evaluations for the judicial system, with a focus on assessing the likelihood of violent behavior in both juveniles and adults,evaluating individuals accused of sexual offenses, and determining the legal decision-making capabilities of adolescents and young adults. After completing her doctoral studies, Warren was appointed as an instructor within the Division of Medical Center Social Work and the Department of Behavioral Medicine and Psychiatry at the University of Virginia (UVA), where she worked from 1981 to 1985. She then became full-time facility in 1985 in the same division and department at UVA. During her role as assistant professor, she initiated research on community-based forensic evaluations in 1988, collaborating with W. Lawrence Fitch to explore how forensic mental health evaluations could be transferred from centralized state hospitals to community environments. Warren received tenure in 1991, collaborating with Roy Hazelwood to analyze the criminal behavior of serial rapists.\nWhile simultaneously working as an Associate Professor at UVA, Warren was hired as a UVA liaison to the FBI Behavioral Sciences Unit (BSU) from 1996 to present. She has contributed to the development of paradigms that are pertinent to the criminal investigative analyses of sexual offenders, such as the differences between impulsive and ritualistic sex offenders , the components of modus operandiHazelwood, R. R., & Warren, J. I. (2003). Linkage analysis: Modus operandi, ritual, and signature in serial sexual crime. Aggression and Violent Behavior, 8(6), 587–598.\n‌, ritual, and the signature exhibited in an offender's behavior at the crime scene.Additionally, she has worked with the FBI National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime to perform research on the crime scene analysis of child abduction and murder, sexually sadistic murder, and serial rape. She has previously engaged in the development of GPS methodologies for spatial profiling of serial sexual offenders and in the creation of software for police agencies to detect hotspots for the timely deployment of resources.\nSince 2000,Warren has served as an Expert Forensic Social Worker for Park Dietz and Associates. She consults for attorneys on cases involving topic such as child abuse, child sexual abuse, elder abuse and exploitation, foreseeability of abuse standard of care in child, adult, and elder care facilities, mitigation evaluations, and intimate partner violence.\nSince 2002, Warren has served as Professor Emerita of Psychiatry and Neurobehavioral Sciences at UVA. In this capacity, she held the position of professor and researcher at the University of Virginia's School of Law (School for Social Work) and Medicine. Additionally, she held a role at the Institute of Law, Psychiatry, and Public Policy. Warren offered training on how to perform forensic evaluations for the courts and has expertise in assessments that concentrate on evaluating the risk of violent behavior in both juveniles and adults, the evaluation of individuals accused of sexual offenses, and the legal decision-making ability of adolescents and young adults.\nAdvisory Positions\n* 1990-1991 Ritualistic Crime Task Force, Virginia State Crime Commission, Commonwealth of Virginia\n* 1996-1997 Mental Health Working Group, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention,Washington, DC\n* 1998-1999 Sexually Violent Predator Task Force, Virginia State Crime Commission, Commonwealth of Virginia\n* 2004-2005 NGA Prison Reentry Policy Team, DMHMRSAS, Commonwealth of Virginia\nResearch\nWarren has contributed to peer-reviewed journals on a variety of subjects, such as child sexual abuse, serial rape , child abduction, and homicide . Her work also includes analyzing crime scenes related to sexually sadistic offenses involving both children and adults, as well as the dynamics of consensual and non-consensual sexual activities in prisons. She has researched factors that contribute to violenceWarren, J. I., South, S. C., Burnette, M. L., Rogers, A., Friend, R., Bale, R., & Van Patten, I. (2005).

Additionally, Warren examines linkage analysis related to sexual crimes, the application of third-party information in court evaluations, forensic assessments and expert opinions for the legal system, and the competency and rehabilitation processes for juvenile offenders.\nShe is perhaps most well-known in her research in response to the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA). In 2007, Warren obtained funding from the National Institute of Justice to carry out a three-year research project on sexual violence and victimization in prisons, which was initiated in response to the enactment of this legislation.   Warren, in partnership with Shelly L. Jackson, discovered that factors such as early childhood trauma, psychological characteristics, and gender significantly influence sexual victimization and predation within prisons, revealing different trends for men and women. This study contributed to the efforts of PREA by pinpointing specific risk factors that necessitate gender-sensitive, evidence-based prevention and classification approaches.\nIn 2010, Warren started a ten-year investigation into the Ineligible Volunteer (IV) “P” (Perversion) files compiled by the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) from 1944 to 2016. Warren examined thousands of files within the BSA and highlighted that there has never been a definitive profile of child sex offenders. Warren concluded that while these documents have been useful in preventing unsuitable leaders from participating, the BSA's historical responses to allegations of abuse have often been lacking. Her research has contributed to efforts aimed at enhancing the organization’s Volunteer Screening Database and overall youth protection measures. Warren's findings also underscored the extent of the abuse, with thousands of documented cases of alleged abusive leaders, which calls for increased transparency and reforms within the BSA. This research led to the creation of a database that identified 7,819 accused individuals and 12,254 confirmed victims.\nWarren has also established her own laboratory at the University of Virginia that specializes in forensic psychology. Her research areas include evaluating violence risk, analyzing victim selection behaviors, and assessing competency to stand trial. In her lab, she collaborates primarily with Park Dietz in examining sexual offending, sexual sadism, and forensic psychiatric evaluation. Warren and Dietz's research highlights that sexually sadistic offenders display consistent behavioral patterns, characterized by premeditation, specific victim targeting, and the implementation of restraint, humiliation, and violence. Their findings indicate that these behaviors tend to recur in various offenses, showcasing recognizable signatures. Furthermore, their work demonstrates trends in forensic evaluations, particularly the focus on cognitive factors related to insanity and the limited use of psychological testing, thus broadening the scope of forensic psychology.\nBooks\n* Sheehan, D., & Warren, J.

London, England: Routledge, Taylor and Francis.\nIn Popular Press\nWarren's work was featured in the Philadelphia Inquirer on September 14, 1989, where she addressed the topic of stalking, the obsessions with celebrities and public figures, and associated psychosexual issues. The article examines obsessive or fixated behaviors, including stalking and perilous fan obsessions. It also touches on clinical, legal, and safety-related concerns. In the TIME article “A Fatal Obsession with the Stars” (1989), Janet I. Warren offers a psychological view for understanding how admiration can turn into unhealthy fixation among celebrity stalkers. She describes how these individuals often mix up fantasy and reality, feeling a personal or saving link with the celebrity. Warren’s observations place these behaviors within a forensic and behavioral medicine context. She highlights that obsessive attachments to public figures show clear clinical patterns that can seriously affect public safety.\nExternal Links\n* [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Janet-Warren Janet I.
