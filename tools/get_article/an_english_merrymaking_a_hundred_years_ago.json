During the early stages of his career Frith was a member of The Clique artistic group. He later became known for his panoramic crowd scenes The Derby Day and The Railway Station.\nThe work depicts a day of festivities in an English village in the mid-eighteenth century. It was one of several paintings that cemented Frith's growing reputation. It was exhibited at the Royal Academy's Summer Exhibition of 1847. An oil sketch for the painting is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Gaunt, William. The Restless Century: Painting in Britain, 1800-1900.
