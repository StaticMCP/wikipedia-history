The band consists of lead singer Mason Maggio, guitarist Christian Van Deurs, drummer Chris Wall and keyboardist Billy Duprey.\nOriginally a side project of Maggio and Van Deurs' indie folk band Tigers on Trains, the Republic of Wolves gained popularity when a set of their demos was uploaded online and mistakenly believed to belong to fellow Long Island band Brand New. They have released three full-length albums.\nHistory\nDuring the summer of 2009, Maggio and Van Deurs were recording the Tigers On Trains album Grandfather at Gregg Andrew DellaRocca's home studio. They began experimenting with a different, heavier, and more dynamic style of music with their friends Duprey and Wall and The Republic of Wolves was formed.\nThe Republic of Wolves has notable influences from other Long Island bands such as Brand New, Taking Back Sunday, Straylight Run, Glassjaw and As Tall As Lions. This influence was most obvious when clips of three The Republic of Wolves demos were posted onto YouTube as demos of Brand New songs from their then upcoming album Daisy. Initially, many Brand New fans could not tell whether these demos were legitimate or not. The band has said that they had no part in this incident, and when they found out about the faux demos they contacted the CEO of AbsolutePunk, Jason Tate, and the truth was revealed.Tate, Jason.
