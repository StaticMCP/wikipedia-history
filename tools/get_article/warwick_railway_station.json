The station is served by Chiltern Railways (who manage the station), and also less frequently by West Midlands Trains. It is located around half a mile north of the town centre.\nWarwick is also served by Warwick Parkway railway station on the town's outskirts, which opened in 2000.\nHistory\nWarwick station was opened on 1 October 1852 by the Great Western Railway on their main line between London, Oxford and Birmingham. The station's platforms were extended in length in 1892.\nThe station formerly had an additional bay platform on the western side, which in steam days was often used to hold the bank engine used to assist heavy goods trains up Hatton Bank towards Birmingham. It was extended in May 1911, converted to a loop in June 1944 and shut down on 26 November 1967.\nThe original buildings on the 'up' (London bound) platform were demolished in 1964.\nPlatforms and facilities\nThe main station building is on the Birmingham bound Platform 1, a subway links this to the London bound Platform 2, which has only a basic shelter.\nThe station is equipped with real-time electronic information departure boards, A staffed ticket office is open for part of the day; there is also a self-service ticket machine located outside the station building, which is on the northbound platform. There is an indoor waiting room by Platform 1 and two outside waiting shelters, one on each platform. There was a 'Permit-to-Travel' machine on the northbound platform but was removed in 2016. In 2012 a cafe selling drinks and snacks opened on Platform, but has since closed. Although car parking is available at the station it is limited and there is a charge for it. A local taxi company called Castle Cabs shares the main station building with Chiltern Railways. The station underwent a light refurbishment in 2022 including repainting and the replacement of signage to correspond with Chilterns' new branding.\nThe station will receive lift instalment works in 2023 to fit with the governments Access For All scheme. Work was delayed however when the foundations of the existing station were found to be built on the original 1850s station so new plans had to be drawn up.\nServices\nMost trains calling here are Chiltern Railways trains between  and  (mostly half hourly) or Leamington Spa & either  or Birmingham Snow Hill (both two-hourly). At peak times, these are augmented by a few West Midlands Trains services between Leamington Spa and / or Worcester Shrub Hill.  Chiltern also run a limited weekday/weekend through service between Marylebone &  that stops here. Most services are operated with Class 165 or Class 168 DMUs or Class 68 locomotives hauling Mark 3 carriages. West Midlands Railway use 172s and occasional 196s for peak time services.\nGallery\nFile:Front of Warwick Railway Station.jpg|Front of the station, taken from the main station approach\nFile:Station building Platform 1 Warwick.jpg|The main station building, taken from Platform 2\nFile:Warwick2platform.jpg|The waiting facilities on Platform 2\nFile:Warwick Station ticket office.jpg|Warwick Station ticket office\nFile:Class 165 at Warwick.png|Class 165 on platform 1 bound for Birmingham Moor Street railway station.\nFile:Class 168 Warwick.jpg|British Rail Class 168 seen on platform 2 departing to Marylebone station.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://warwickshirerailways.com/gwr/warwick.htm Photographs of Warwick railway station] from Warwickshire Railways\n*[http://www.railaroundbirmingham.co.uk/Stations/warwick.php Rail Around Birmingham and the West Midlands: Warwick station]\n|next=|route1=Chiltern RailwaysLondon to Birmingham|col1=|route2=Chiltern RailwaysChiltern Main Line fast services|col2=|route3=Chiltern RailwaysLeamington Spa to Stratford-upon-Avon|col3=}}\nLimited Service|next=Limited Service|route=West Midlands RailwayLeamington-Worcester |col= }}"
