It was funded by Leeds City Council and the National Lottery Heritage Fund. The facility stores over one million objects in climate-controlled conditions and hosts regular tours.\nCollections stored here include: natural science specimens, social history (including historic board games), textiles, world cultures and archaeology (including Anglo-Saxon sculpture). Objects from different collections areas are displayed alongside each other to maximize visual impact. In 2018, the learning team was awarded The Sandford Award for Excellence in Heritage Learning. The Discovery Centre runs events including art classes.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://museumsandgalleries.leeds.gov.uk/leeds-discovery-centre/ Official website]\n* Leeds Museums & Galleries: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=027cRJ9qBVI Three Women: a plesiosaurus, a mistaken identity, and a hat.]"
