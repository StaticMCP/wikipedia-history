The awards were created to honor science fiction, fantasy, and horror in film, but have since grown to reward other films belonging to genre fiction, as well as television and home media releases. The Saturn Awards were created in 1973 and were originally referred to as Golden Scrolls.\nHistory\nand Aaron Paul at the 2010 Saturn Awards]]\nThe Saturn Awards were devised by Donald A. Reed in 1973, who felt that work in films in the genre of science fiction at that time lacked recognition within the established Hollywood film industry's award system. Initially, the award given was a Golden Scroll certificate. In the late 1970s, the award was revamped to a representation of the planet Saturn, with its ring(s) composed of a film reel.\nThe Saturn Awards are voted upon by members of the presenting Academy. The Academy is a non-profit organization with membership open to the public. Its president and executive producer is Robert Holguin, and producer/writers Bradley Marcus and Kevin Marcus. Its members include filmmakers J. J. Abrams, Bryan Singer, Steven Spielberg, Bryan Fuller, Mark A. Altman, Vince Gilligan and James Cameron, among others.\nAlthough the Awards still primarily focus on films and television in the science fiction, fantasy and horror categories, the Saturns have also recognized productions in other dramatic genres. There are also special awards for lifetime achievement in film production.\nFollowing the 46th ceremony held in 2021, the decision to rebrand what would have been the 47th as the \"50th Saturn Awards\" was made in order to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Saturn Awards, which were founded in 1973. Subsequent ceremonies have continued with the new numbering. The television categories were majorly overhauled at the 50th ceremony, with several categories being split to recognise both network/cable and streaming series. These changes were reverted at the following ceremony, however. In 2023, the nominations announcement and awards process for the 51st Saturn Awards was postponed by several months in solidarity with the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes.\nAward categories\nFilm\nTelevision\nHome video\n* Best DVD or Blu-ray Release (since 2001)\n* Best DVD or Blu-ray Special Edition Release (since 2001)\n* Best Classic Film DVD Release (since 2001)\n* Best Television DVD Release (since 2002)\n* Best DVD or Blu-ray Collection (since 2003)\n* Best Retro Television Series on DVD (since 2014)\nSpecial awards\n* The George Pal Memorial Award\n* The Life Career Award\n* The President's Memorial Award\n* Special Recognition Award\n* Breakthrough Performance Award\nDiscontinued awards\n* Best Low-Budget Film (1980–1982)\n* Best Comic-to-Movie Film (2013–2024)\n* Best Network Television Series (1988–2014)\n* Best Streaming Science Fiction, Action & Fantasy Series (2019)\n* Best Streaming Superhero Series (2017–2018)\n* Best Syndicated/Cable Television Series (1996–2014)\n* Best International Series (2007)\n* Best Youth-Oriented Television Series (2011–2014)\n* Best New Media Television Series (2015–2017)\n* Best Streaming Limited Event Television Series (2022)\n* Best Streaming Action/Adventure Television Series (2022)\n* Best Streaming Fantasy Television Series (2022)\n* Best Streaming Horror & Thriller Series (2018, 2022)\n* Best Streaming Science Fiction Television Series (2022)\n* Best Actor in a Streaming Television Series (2018, 2022)\n* Best Actress in a Streaming Television Series (2018, 2022)\n* Best Supporting Actor in a Streaming Television Series (2022)\n* Best Supporting Actress in a Streaming Television Series (2022)\n* Best Performance by a Younger Actor in a Streaming Television Series (2022)\n* Best Guest-Starring Performance in a Streaming Television Series (2022)\nRecords\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!width=\"250\"|Superlative\n!width=\"350\"|Record-holder\n!width=\"250\"|Record set\n!width=\"150\"|Year\n!width=\"350\"|Notes\n|-\n| rowspan=2| Most awards for a person\n| James Cameron\n| 10 awards\n| rowspan=3| 2022/23\n| Awards resulted from 15 nominations\n|-\n| rowspan=2| John Williams\n| 10 awards\n| Awards resulted from 23 nominations\n|-\n| Most nominations for a person\n| 23 nominations\n| Nominations resulted in 10 wins\n|-\n| Most awards for a film\n| Avatar\n| 10 awards\n| 2009\n| Awards resulted from 10 nominations\n|-\n| Most nominations for a film\n| Star Wars: The Force Awakens\n| 15 nominations\n| 2015\n| Nominations resulted in 8 wins\n|-\n| Most awards for a TV series\n| rowspan=2|The Walking Dead\n| 24 awards\n| rowspan=2|2021/22\n| Awards resulted from 62 nominations\n|-\n| Most nominations for a TV series\n| 62 nominations\n| Nominations resulted in 24 wins\n|-\n| rowspan=5|Most awards for acting\n| Anna Torv\n| rowspan=5|4 awards\n| 2012\n| Awards resulted from 5 nominations\n|-\n| Robert Downey Jr.\n| 2018/19\n| Awards resulted from 8 nominations\n|-\n| Caitríona Balfe\n| 2022/23\n| Awards resulted from 8 nominations\n|-\n| Patrick Stewart\n| 2022/23\n| Awards resulted from 7 nominations\n|-\n| Mark Hamill\n| 2023/24\n| Awards resulted from 6 nominations\n|-\n| Most nominations for acting\n| Tom Cruise\n| 12 nominations\n| 2021/22\n| Nominations resulted in 2 wins\n|-\n| Most awards for directing\n| James Cameron\n| 6 awards\n| 2022/23\n| Awards resulted from 7 nominations\n|-\n| Most nominations for directing\n| Steven Spielberg\n| 14 nominations\n| 2021/22\n| Nominations resulted in 4 wins\n|-\n| rowspan=2|Most awards for writing\n| Christopher Nolan\n| rowspan=2|4 awards\n| 2014\n| Awards resulted from 6 nominations\n|-\n| James Cameron\n| 2022/23\n| Awards resulted from 7 nominations\n|-\n| rowspan=5|Most nominations for writing\n| Peter Jackson\n| rowspan=5|7 nominations\n| 2014\n| Nominations resulted in 1 win\n|-\n| Fran Walsh\n| 2014\n| Nominations resulted in 1 win\n|-\n| Quentin Tarantino\n| 2019/20\n| Nominations resulted in 2 wins\n|-\n| Guillermo del Toro\n| 2021/22\n| Nominations resulted in 1 win\n|-\n| James Cameron\n| 2022/23\n| Nominations resulted in 4 wins\n|-\n| Most awards for a film series\n| Star Wars\n| 49 awards\n| 2019/20\n| Awards resulted from 114 nominations\n|-\n| Most nominations for a film series\n| Marvel Cinematic Universe\n| 180 nominations\n| 2023/24\n| Nominations resulted in 43 wins\n|-\n| Most nominations for a television franchise at a single ceremony\n| Star Trek\n| 14 nominations\n| 2022/23\n| Nominations resulted in 5 wins\n|}\nCriticism\nThe Saturn Awards has been criticized for having broadened its scope, nominating and awarding prestige movies genre awards (sci-fi, fantasy, or horror) and thereby stretching the meanings of the genres too far.Nathaniel Rogers. [http://thefilmexperience.net/blog/2014/2/26/nominations-for-everyone-saturn-awards.html «Nominations for Everyone!» — Saturn Awards]. The Film Experience, February 26, 2014\n\"I think the Saturn Awards have lost focus. You're a genre award. You're supposed to be about fantasy, sci-fi and horror. That's your whole goddamn raison d'être\".\nMyles McNutt. [http://cultural-learnings.com/2010/02/19/whats-my-genre-again-the-insanity-of-the-saturn-awards/ What’s my Genre Again?: The In(s)anity of the Saturn Awards]. Cultural Learnings, February 19, 2010.\n\"The problem is that, over time, the Saturn Awards have stretched the meaning of genre so far that it legitimately has no meaning.  Rather than seeming like a legitimate celebration of science fiction, fantasy or horror, the Saturn Awards read like an unflattering and at points embarrassing collection of films and television series which reflect not the best that genre has to offer, but rather a desperate attempt to tap into the cultural zeitgeist while masquerading as a celebration of the underappreciated.\nFrancisco Salazar.

Latinpost, March 5, 2015\n\"However, sometimes the Saturn Awards choose prestige films and ignore some of the more important science fiction, fantasy and horror films of the year.\"\nNotes\nYear-by-year results\nThe year indicates the year of release of the films eligible.\n* 1972: 1st Saturn Awards\n* 1973: 2nd Saturn Awards\n* 1974–1975: 3rd Saturn Awards\n* 1976: 4th Saturn Awards\n* 1977: 5th Saturn Awards\n* 1978: 6th Saturn Awards\n* 1979: 7th Saturn Awards\n* 1980: 8th Saturn Awards\n* 1981: 9th Saturn Awards\n* 1982: 10th Saturn Awards\n* 1983: 11th Saturn Awards\n* 1984: 12th Saturn Awards\n* 1985: 13th Saturn Awards\n* 1986: 14th Saturn Awards\n* 1987: 15th Saturn Awards\n* 1988: 16th Saturn Awards\n* 1989–1990: 17th Saturn Awards\n* 1991: 18th Saturn Awards\n* 1992: 19th Saturn Awards\n* 1993: 20th Saturn Awards\n* 1994: 21st Saturn Awards\n* 1995: 22nd Saturn Awards\n* 1996: 23rd Saturn Awards\n* 1997: 24th Saturn Awards\n* 1998: 25th Saturn Awards\n* 1999: 26th Saturn Awards\n* 2000: 27th Saturn Awards\n* 2001: 28th Saturn Awards\n* 2002: 29th Saturn Awards\n* 2003: 30th Saturn Awards\n* 2004: 31st Saturn Awards\n* 2005: 32nd Saturn Awards\n* 2006: 33rd Saturn Awards\n* 2007: 34th Saturn Awards\n* 2008: 35th Saturn Awards\n* 2009: 36th Saturn Awards\n* 2010: 37th Saturn Awards\n* 2011: 38th Saturn Awards\n* 2012: 39th Saturn Awards\n* 2013: 40th Saturn Awards\n* 2014: 41st Saturn Awards\n* 2015: 42nd Saturn Awards\n* 2016: 43rd Saturn Awards\n* 2017: 44th Saturn Awards\n* 2018–2019: 45th Saturn Awards\n* 2019–2020: 46th Saturn Awards\n* 2021–2022: 50th Anniversary Saturn Awards\n* 2022–2023: 51st Saturn Awards\n* 2023–2024: 52nd Saturn Awards\nSee also\n* Hugo Award\n* Nebula Award\n* Scream Awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
