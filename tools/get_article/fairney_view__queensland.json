In the , Fairney View had a population of 221 people.\nHistory\nThe locality takes its name from a pastoral property called Fairney Lawn (also written as Fairnie Lawn) operated by grazier Joseph North in 1841. It was also the name of the railway station opened in June 1884 on the now closed Brisbane Valley railway line. Queensland Railways Department records indicate that the meaning of the name Fairney View is view of ferns\".\nIn June 1872, a German Lutheran Church was opened near the bridge over Fairney Brook on the road to Wivenhoe (the present Fairney View Fernvale Road, approx ). It was low-lying land and the church was badly flooded on two occasions, once in 1893 when the water was over  above the building and on a second time when the water reached the roof. On Saturday 5 September 1903, St Peter's Lutheran Church was relocated and re-opened at a less flood-prone and more central location (332 Fernvale Road, ). However, due to the age of the building, a lot of the material in the old building had to be replaced. The church is now closed and has been converted to a private home.\nTenders were called for the construction of a school building in Fairney View in October 1895. Fairney View Provisional School opened on 20 January 1896 under the direction of teacher Miss Harris. It became Fairney View State School on 1 January 1909. It closed in 1967. It was at 20-30 Randalls Road ().\nDemographics\nIn the , Fairney View had a population of 223 people.\nIn the , Fairney View had a population of 221 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Fairney View.
