Although first elected to the state senate in 1854, Winslow had a spectacular rise to Democratic Party leadership and became Speaker of the senate that year.\nWinslow was serving as Speaker of the North Carolina Senate in 1854 when Governor David S. Reid resigned, having been elected to the Senate by the legislature. According to the amendments passed at the Convention of 1835, if a governor died or left office, the Speaker of the Senate was to assume the post (the lieutenant governor position was not created until the ratification of the Constitution of 1868). Winslow graduated from the University of North Carolina. After being elected to a vacant U.S. Senate seat and with almost one month left in his gubernatorial term, Governor David S. Reid handed the gubernatorial position to Winslow on December 6, 1854.  Winslow served in this position until Thomas Bragg was inaugurated on January 1, 1855. He then served in the United States House of Representatives from March 1855 to March 1861.\nWinslow was a slave owner.\nWinslow was a native of Fayetteville, North Carolina, which is also where he died.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=W000640 Congressional Biography]"
