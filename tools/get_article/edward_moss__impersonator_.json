Moss entered a company talent contest and won; over time Moss decided to focus on doing Jackson exclusively for a living.\nEarly life\nMoss was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, on July 11, 1977. While an employee at McDonald's in the early 1990s, his co-workers took notice of his resemblance to pop singer Michael Jackson. In 1994, Moss entered an employee talent contest impersonating the singer and won the competition. It was at this time that he decided to become a Jackson impersonator professionally.\nCareer\nMoss has stated it only takes him 30–45 minutes to transform himself into Michael Jackson. His impersonation skills have led to work in countries outside of North America including the Philippines, Bahrain, New Zealand, and Japan. In July 2009, Moss went on a world tour with his Tribute to Michael Jackson show. For four years, Moss performed as Jackson at Horizons Casino Hotel in Lake Tahoe. He performed as a Michael Jackson impersonator at Canobie Lake Park in Salem, New Hampshire for many years.\nMoss is also the only known Jackson impersonator to have had no plastic surgery to augment his appearance to more resemble the singer. When hired to perform at a venue in Asia, Moss' manager had to have staff act as bodyguards for him as the audience attending had reached mob levels.\nIn 1996, Moss met Michael Jackson while performing his impressionist act in Hollywood, California. Reportedly, Jackson told Moss, \"You look really good.\" Moss has impersonated Jackson in a number of movies, including the third and fourth Scary Movie films and Date Movie. Moss also appeared as Michael Jackson on E! Entertainment, Sky News, and Sky 1's reenactment of the Michael Jackson Trial.\nA number of Jackson's fans reportedly criticized Moss and his performances as making fun of the singer. Moss denies suggestions that he exploits and portrays Jackson in a negative manner.\nFilmography\nFilm\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Film\n!Role\n!class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n|-\n| 2003\n| Scary Movie 3\n| MJ Alien\n|\n|-\n| 2005\n| 101 Even Bigger Celebrity Oops\n| Michael Jackson\n| TV documentary\n|-\n| 2006\n| Date Movie\n| Michael Jackson Impersonator\n|\n|-\n| 2006\n| Scary Movie 4\n| MJ Alien\n|\n|-\n| 2006\n| ''Don't Be Scared\n| Michael Jackson\n|\n|-\n| 2009\n| Bamboo Shark\n| Michael Jackson Impersonator\n|\n|}\nTelevision\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Film\n!Role\n!class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n|-\n| 2000\n| The Steve Harvey Show\n| Michael Jackson Impersonator\n| Episode: \"I Believe I Can Lie\"\n|-\n| 2001\n| Nikki''\n| Michael Jackson Impersonator\n| Episode: \"I'll Kick Your Ass\"\n|-\n| 2002\n| MADtv\n| Michael Jackson Impersonator\n| Season 8 Episode 9\n|-\n| 2003\n| Nip/Tuck\n| Mr. Diamond\n| Episode: \"Nanette Badcock\"\n|-\n| 2005\n| The Michael Jackson Trial\n| Michael Jackson\n| Lead Role: 18 episodes\n|}\nAwards and nominations\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
