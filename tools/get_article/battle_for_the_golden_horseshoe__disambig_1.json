The winner of the game receives the Golden Horseshoe Trophy, which was also created in 2004 for the inaugural game.\nDue to a misunderstanding, both schools constructed a trophy for the rivalry and brought it to the inaugural game. The teams decided that the rivalry would adopt the trophy created by the winner of that game; UC Davis won 36–33 and was therefore allowed to make its trophy the official one to be exchanged in all subsequent meetings.\nUC Davis won the trophy in 2004, 2005, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2014, 2017, 2018, 2019, March 2021, October 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025 while Cal Poly took it in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2016. UC Davis leads the all-time series 29–20–2.\nThere is also controversy regarding the addition of gems to the trophy after each win. The Mustang Maniacs (today known as the Stang Gang after a student vote), the student group who holds the trophy while it is under Cal Poly's control, added blue and green gems to the trophy from 2006 to 2008. But when the Aggie Pack regained control of the trophy in 2009, they removed the gems, wishing to keep the trophy in its original condition.\nBoth programs are based in California, and both are primarily members of the non-football sponsoring Big West Conference, while their football teams both play within the Big Sky Conference.\nAdditionally, there are many key differences between the two institutions: UC Davis is located in northern California and is a member of the University of California system, while Cal Poly is located in southern California and is part of the California State University system, giving the rivalry an element of culture clash.\nThe initial game in 1939 in Davis was broadcast all the way back to the Central Coast via Sacramento-area radio station 1500 AM KFBK. Some 200 Cal Poly supporters, including the band, made the trip north for the first matchup between the \"so-called brother institution(s)\".\nUpon resumption of the rivalry in 1976, the first post-World War II installment in the series was initially billed as the Aggie Bowl, given the \"strong agriculture-oriented curriculums at both universities,\" per the San Luis Obispo Tribune.\nThis balance of similarities and differences has given the rivalry a basis in respect between both institutions for their academic statures as well as often recruiting the same players. After being hired by Army, former Cal Poly head coach Rich Ellerson compared the spirit of the Mustangs' rivalry with UC Davis to the rivalry between Army and Navy, commenting to the Times Herald-Record: \"We had a rivalry at Cal Poly with UC Davis, and I always would try to invoke the kind of rivalry we have with Army-Navy: a rivalry that's founded on respect as opposed to disdain.\"\nGame results\n| team2 = UC Davis / Northern Branch\n| team2style =\n| November 4, 1939 | Davis, CA | UC Davis| 28 | Cal Poly| 0\n| November 16, 1940 | San Luis Obispo, CA | Cal Poly| 20 | UC Davis | 7\n| November 20, 1976 | San Luis Obispo, CA | Cal Poly| 26 | UC Davis | 14\n| November 11, 1978 | Davis, CA | #6 UC Davis | 29 | #3 Cal Poly| 22\n| September 29, 1979 | San Luis Obispo, CA | Cal Poly| 31 | UC Davis | 10\n| September 28, 1980 | Davis, CA | Cal Poly| 28 | UC Davis | 25\n| October 17, 1981 | San Luis Obispo, CA | Cal Poly | 30 | UC Davis | 0\n| October 9, 1982 | Davis, CA | UC Davis | 24 | Cal Poly | 0\n| October 8, 1983 | San Luis Obispo, CA | #4 UC Davis | 24 | #9 Cal Poly | 14\n| September 29, 1984 | Davis, CA | UC Davis | 10 | Cal Poly | 6\n| September 28, 1985 | San Luis Obispo, CA | #7 UC Davis | 34 | Cal Poly | 21\n| September 20, 1986 | Davis, CA | #4 UC Davis | 32 | Cal Poly | 21\n| October 3, 1987 | San Luis Obispo, CA | #18 Cal Poly | 41 | #12 UC Davis | 0\n| October 29, 1988 | Davis, CA | Cal Poly | 21 | #17 UC Davis | 21\n| October 28, 1989 | San Luis Obispo, CA | Cal Poly | 28 | #12 UC Davis | 21\n| October 6, 1990 | Davis, CA | Cal Poly | 19 | UC Davis | 0\n| September 14, 1991 | San Luis Obispo, CA | UC Davis | 31 | #17 Cal Poly | 28\n| October 10, 1992 | Davis, CA | Cal Poly | 31 | UC Davis | 31\n| September 11, 1993 | Davis, CA | UC Davis | 37 | Cal Poly | 26\n| October 15, 1994 | San Luis Obispo, CA | Cal Poly | 32 | #16 UC Davis | 31\n| November 11, 1995 | Davis, CA | UC Davis | 34 | Cal Poly | 31\n| November 12, 1996 | San Luis Obispo, CA | Cal Poly | 17 | #12 UC Davis | 13\n| September 6, 1997 | Davis, CA | Cal Poly | 20 | #7 UC Davis | 19\n| October 3, 1998 | San Luis Obispo, CA | #7 UC Davis | 34 | Cal Poly | 24\n| October 23, 1999 | Davis, CA | #8 UC Davis | 31 | Cal Poly | 24\n| October 21, 2000 | San Luis Obispo, CA | #1 UC Davis | 63 | Cal Poly | 28\n| October 20, 2001 | Davis, CA | Cal Poly | 31 | #10 UC Davis | 28\n| October 26, 2002 | San Luis Obispo, CA | #5 UC Davis | 28 | Cal Poly | 14\n| November 8, 2003 | Davis, CA | Cal Poly | 18 | UC Davis | 14\n| October 30, 2004 | San Luis Obispo, CA | UC Davis | 36 | #11 Cal Poly | 33\n| October 29, 2005 | Davis, CA | UC Davis | 20 | #10 Cal Poly | 13\n| October 7, 2006 | San Luis Obispo, CA | #5 Cal Poly | 23 | #16 UC Davis | 17\n| October 13, 2007 | Davis, CA | #22 Cal Poly | 63 | UC Davis | 28\n| November 15, 2008 | San Luis Obispo, CA | #3 Cal Poly | 51 | UC Davis | 28\n| November 6, 2009 | Davis, CA | UC Davis | 23 | Cal Poly | 10\n| November 13, 2010 | San Luis Obispo, CA | UC Davis | 22 | #19 Cal Poly | 21\n| November 5, 2011 | Davis, CA | UC Davis | 24 | Cal Poly | 17\n| September 22, 2012 | San Luis Obispo, CA | Cal Poly | 28 | UC Davis | 20\n| November 2, 2013 | Davis, CA | Cal Poly | 34 | UC Davis | 16\n| November 15, 2014 | San Luis Obispo, CA | UC Davis | 48 | Cal Poly | 35\n| November 13, 2015 | Davis, CA | Cal Poly | 55 | UC Davis | 38\n| October 22, 2016 | San Luis Obispo, CA | #17 Cal Poly | 21 | UC Davis | 16\n| October 28, 2017 | Davis, CA | UC Davis | 31 | Cal Poly | 28\n| October 20, 2018 | San Luis Obispo, CA | #10 UC Davis | 52 | Cal Poly | 10\n| October 12, 2019 | Davis, CA | #24 UC Davis | 48 | Cal Poly | 24\n| March 20, 2021 | Davis, CA | #21 UC Davis | 73 | Cal Poly | 24\n| October 23, 2021 | San Luis Obispo, CA | #10 UC Davis | 24 | Cal Poly | 13\n| October 29, 2022 | Davis, CA | UC Davis | 59 | Cal Poly | 17\n| September 30, 2023 | San Luis Obispo, CA | #20 UC Davis | 31 | Cal Poly | 13\n| October 12, 2024 | Davis, CA | #6 UC Davis | 56 | Cal Poly | 10\n| October 4, 2025 | San Luis Obispo, CA | #9 UC Davis | 34 | Cal Poly | 27\n}}\nSee also\n* List of NCAA college football rivalry games\nReferences\n}}"
