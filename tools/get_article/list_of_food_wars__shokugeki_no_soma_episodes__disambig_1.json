The Aldini brothers head out for a trip to Tokyo Tower, where other students such as Alice, Ryo, and the boys from Polar Star Dormitory, with the exception of Sōma, are visiting too. Afterwards, they encountered a pretentious and disenchanted Urara working in a cosplay restaurant, before bumping into the girls from Polar Star Dormitory and have lunch together at a traditional Japanese restaurant. When Megumi requests cheese with her rice, an old man scoffs at the Aldini brothers for not respecting Japanese culture and he requests a food battle with Takumi who insists on dueling alongside his brother. The former's food, although nostalgic, is lacking in skill compared to the Aldini brothers', and he confesses that Takumi reminded him of his daughter's fiancé, a blonde-haired foreigner, whom he objected strictly against her marrying. After a long day, the brothers return home.\n| LineColor       = EAECF0\n}}\n| ShortSummary    = This episode takes place sometime before the second season, before the Autumn Elections Preliminaries. Erina is at a loss for what to do during summer vacation after finishing her schedule early for the day, so Alice takes her to a public pool. There, Alice enjoys watching Erina embarrass herself with wearing an old coat, a bathing suit in public, and admitting that she admires someone. Alice also attempts to educate Erina on the concept of love despite not knowing about it herself. In the end, Erina decides to focus on perfecting her cooking instead of understanding love. Meanwhile, the girls at Polar Star Dormitory are practically dying from the summer heat and stress for the Autumn Elections Preliminaries, and make a few failed attempts to cool down until the boys, including the Aldini brothers and Ikumi, arrive and take them to a cool stream where they eat shaved ice, and then barbeque. Likewise, Jun is prepared to pass out from heatstroke until Hayama generously makes her some cold porridge with soup.\n| LineColor       = EAECF0\n}}\n| ShortSummary    = This episode takes place sometime after the second season after the first years completed their Stagiaire assignments. The Polar Star dorm residents, along with the Aldini brothers, Ikumi, Kurokiba, and Hayama take a trip to the hot springs inn where Megumi did her Stagiaire. Arriving at the Inn, Megumi and Isshiki showcased their table tennis finesse. With all of the Inn's cooks suffering accidents, the Polar Star gang and the others took over the kitchen for the arriving guests: Erina, Alice, and Hisako; who are impressed by the finely crafted meal supposedly made by amateurs, not knowing it is made by Tōtsuki students. Yukihira, intrigued by the legendary fish dubbed the 'River Master' in the nearby river, invite Kurokiba and Hayama to a fishing match, only to be dragged along in the water and coming back empty-handed; leaving behind a disgruntled Takumi who tries hopelessly to catch up to them. Later at night, Megumi inadvertently met Erina in the hot springs bath, realizing that the meal that she and the others cooked is for Erina.\n| LineColor       = EAECF0\n}}\n| ShortSummary    = This episode takes place after the Stagiaire event and just before the start of the third season. The Autumn Election quarter-finalists meet the Elite Ten Council at the annual Autumn Leaves Viewing event, excluding Erina, who sits with her fellow freshmen. With the exception of Megumi, the antagonism between the first years are apparent, until the Elite Ten shows up; displaying a much more tense resentment towards each other. Immediately, Soma extends a Shokugeki challenge to all of them, but they simply laugh it off, all except the Eight Seat, Kuga Terunori, who jokingly asks Soma to try and show some skill that outshines him cooking-wise for him to accept a challenge. The Fourth Seat, Akanegakubo Momo, made them all a sweet treat for the meeting, which gave the freshmen a glimpse of how far ahead the Elite Ten chefs are. Nonetheless, taking this experience to heart, they became much more persevered, and Soma looks for and awaits the opportunity for Kuga to live up to his word.\n| LineColor       = EAECF0\n}}\n| ShortSummary    = Bundled with the 29th volume of the Shokugeki no Soma manga.
