The plot takes place in a futuristic post-apocalyptic Earth, where battles are fought with mechs called Standing Tanks (STs) and the winner takes control of the world. A young man named Mike Anderson participates in the Battle Game to face the ruthless champion Anubis and avenge his father's death.\nThe player acts as the gunner of the ST Falcon piloted by Anderson, and the main objective of the game is to take on Anubis and his subordinate chiefs in a series of nine one-on-one fights. The player can attack enemies using rapid fire by holding down the fire button, energy bolts, bombs, and a variety of limited-use special items. Energy bolts are charged when the player is not firing and are fired once a power meter fills, but is limited to a single shot. The player can counter enemy fire by intercepting their projectiles. Some enemy attacks can only be deflected by shooting energy bolts.\nEach enemy ST has its own attack patterns and destructible weak points that the player must exploit to inflict damage depending on how powerful their shot is. The player wins if the enemy ST's energy is depleted first, but the game is over if the rival depletes the player's energy or if the stage is played for ten minutes. When the player completes the game, they will be given a cheat code that, when input at the title screen, unlocks multiple difficulty levels. In addition, the game also has a time trial mode where the player must defeat enemies to achieve the best time possible and a two-player mode.\nDevelopment and release\nBattle Clash was created by Team Battle Clash, a group within Intelligent Systems that developed games for the Super Scope light gun, made up of Nintendo R&D1 staff responsible for light gun shooters such as Duck Hunt and ''Hogan's Alley.

Nintendo Powers three reviewers found the game fun, highlighting the enemy mechs and sound effects, but noted its lack of depth. Super Pros Mark Wynne considered it a decent attempt at a Super Scope game. He felt that the \"tongue-in-cheek\" plot translated well into the large enemy sprites, but said its sound department was weak. Chris Buxton of Total!'' commented favorably on the game's visuals, but criticized its forgettable soundtrack, very simple gameplay, and low difficulty. Electronic Games Marc Camron praised the game for its graphical presentation, smooth gameplay, lack of slowdown, and variety of modes, but found the audio to be unremarkable and faulted its easy difficulty.\nGameFans five reviewers commended its colorful graphics, sound, and screen-filling bosses, but criticized the gameplay for lack of diversity and felt that the game did not take advantage of the Super Scope. Joypads Nini Nourdine gave the game favorable remarks for its immersive sense of action, fast parallax scrolling, and music, but saw the lack of originality as a shortcoming. Joysticks expressed his disappointment with the game, finding it to be boring and uninteresting. Power Plays Michael Hengst pointed out the game's lack of variety, writing that \"In the long run, the primitive shooting of Battle Clash is certainly no guarantee of long-lasting motivation\".

Player Ones Olivier Scamps called it a very playable title, praising its varied bosses and action, but pointed out its easy difficulty. Sami Souibgui and Marc Lacombe of Consoles + celebrated the game's overall production values but criticized its repetitive action. Super Gamer labelled it as a nice-looking but shallow shooter game. Hardcore Gaming 101s David DeRienzo highlighted the enemy sprites for their animations and high level of detail, while also praising the game's special effects and catchy music. Retro Gamer considered Battle Clash to be a great showcase for the Super Scope, while Destructoids Zoey Handley regarded it as one of the few games worth playing for the peripheral.\nLegacy\nA sequel to Battle Clash titled ''Metal Combat: Falcon's Revenge was developed by the same team at Intelligent Systems, and published by Nintendo in North America in December 1993 and in Europe in May 1994. The game was only released in Western regions, as the Super Scope proved to be less popular in Japan. The ST Falcon was later included as a Spirit in Super Smash Bros.
