An Orchard laboratory information system tracks, stores, and updates details about a patient during a provider visit.\nHistory\nOrchard Software was founded in 1993 by Rob Bush, Ben Bush, and Jeffrey Kain. In September 2019, Rob Bush retired as CEO. Orchard Software was then acquired by Francisco Partners, a private equity firm based in San Francisco, California, and Billie Whitehurst was named CEO in October 2019.\nIn 2021, Orchard Software acquired Corwen, LLC. to expand its molecular testing. The molecular software automates sample tracking, orchestrates laboratory workflows and instruments, and automatically interprets and converts complex genetic analysis data into reportable results.\nSoftware Products\nOrchard Software has two core products, Orchard Harvest and Orchard Enterprise. Both products are used by laboratories that serve hospitals, physician offices, public health centers, reference labs, universities and student health centers, veterinary clinics, pain management clinics, and toxicology labs.\nOrchard Harvest\nA laboratory information system that accepts physician orders, routes the patient and order data for the collected specimen to the correct analyzing machine that performs the diagnostic test and then delivers human-readable results back to physicians and patients.\nOrchard Enterprise\nA laboratory information system that accepts large volumes of complex physician orders, routes the patient data for the collected specimens to the correct analyzing machine, and then delivers human-readable results back to physicians and patients.\nPartnerships\nTribe AI\nIn late 2024, Orchard Software partnered with Tribe AI to use general AI and large language models to improve the efficiency of Orchard’s lab report generation. The goal of the partnership was to deliver a lab report generation interface that would simplify the process for Orchard end-users, while also ensuring accurate reports.\nBabson Diagnostics\nIn September 2024, Orchard Software worked with Babson Diagnostics to enhance Babson’s BetterWay blood testing service, which uses a novel, FDA-approved capillary blood collection system. The capillary blood collection method enables local pharmacies to draw blood for routine testing. Orchard’s software supports Babson’s operations by tracking and reporting the patient’s blood samples.\nPurdue University Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory\nOrchard worked closely with Purdue University’s Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory to increase Indiana’s capacity for COVID-19 testing during the height of the pandemic in 2020. Orchard also partnered with several university health centers around the United States to implement rapid COVID-19 testing.\nRecognition and Awards\nOrchard Software, as an employer, has been named a top workplace by several organizations including a Great Place to Work and the VETS Indexes Recognized Employer.
