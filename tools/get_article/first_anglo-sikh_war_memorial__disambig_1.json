British military troops in Punjab numbered 86,023 men with 116 guns. 45,500 men armed with 98 guns were in the hill stations of Subathu and Kasauli, with 60,000 Sikh Soldiers. With more than 10,000 Sikhs killed, British won the battle and effective power went into the hands of Colonel Henry Lawrence, which also helped them to occupy Kasur. Maharani Jind Kaur continued as the regent and Raja Lal Singh as servant of Maharaja Duleep Singh.\nSee also\n*Anglo Sikh war memorial\nReferences"
