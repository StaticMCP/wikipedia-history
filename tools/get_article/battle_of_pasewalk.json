After two failed attacks on the town and several skirmishes outside, the Prussian force, after seven hours of fighting, retreated as the night approached.\nCasualties on both sides were severe, as Sweden had suffered 500 men in losses, many of them captured by Prussian troops taking the nearby redoubts. However, the Prussians suffered 300 men lost while attempting to storm the main Swedish army at Pasewalk.\nReferences"
