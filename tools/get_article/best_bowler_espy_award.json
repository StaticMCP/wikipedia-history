      "text": "# Best Bowler ESPY Award\n\nThe Best Bowler ESPY Award has been presented annually since 1995 to the best ten-pin bowler, irrespective of gender, adjudged to be the best in a given calendar year of those contesting the sport professionally in the United States.  To date, the award has only been presented to male bowlers.\nBetween 1993 and 2004 the award voting panel comprised variously fans; sportswriters and broadcasters, sports executives, and retired sportspersons, termed collectively experts; and ESPN personalities, but balloting thereafter has been exclusively by fans over the Internet from amongst choices selected by the ESPN Select Nominating Committee.\nThrough the 2001 iteration of the ESPY Awards, ceremonies were conducted in February of each year to honor achievements over the previous calendar year; awards presented thereafter are conferred in June and reflect performance from the June previous. The award wasn't awarded in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nList of winners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"white-space: nowrap;\"\n!Year\n!Bowler\n!Nation ofcitizenship\n|-\n|1995\n|Norm Duke\n|\n|-\n|1996\n|Mike Aulby\n|\n|-\n|1997\n|Bob Learn Jr.\n|\n|-\n|1998\n|Walter Ray Williams, Jr.\n|\n|-\n|1999\n|Walter Ray Williams, Jr.\n|\n|-\n|2000\n|Parker Bohn III\n|\n|-\n|2001\n|Walter Ray Williams, Jr.\n|\n|-\n|2002\n|Pete Weber\n|\n|-\n|2003\n|Walter Ray Williams, Jr.\n|\n|-\n|2004\n|Pete Weber\n|\n|-\n|2005\n|Walter Ray Williams, Jr.\n|\n|-\n|2006\n|Walter Ray Williams, Jr.\n|\n|-\n|2007\n|Norm Duke\n|\n|-\n|2008\n|Norm Duke\n|\n|-\n|2009\n|Norm Duke\n|\n|-\n|2010\n|Walter Ray Williams, Jr.\n|\n|-\n|2011\n|Jason Belmonte\n|\n|-\n|2012\n|Sean Rash\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|Pete Weber\n|\n|-\n|2014\n|Pete Weber\n|\n|-\n|2015\n|Jason Belmonte\n|\n|-\n|2016\n|Jason Belmonte\n|\n|-\n|2017\n|Jason Belmonte\n|\n|-\n|2018\n|Rhino Page\n|\n|-\n|2019\n|Norm Duke\n|\n|-\n|-\n|2020\n| colspan=2 align=center|Not awarded due to the COVID-19 pandemic\n|-\n|2021\n|Tom Daugherty\n|\n|-\n|2022\n|Kyle Troup\n|\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n*Professional Bowlers Association\n*Professional Women's Bowling Association\n*United States Bowling Congress\nNotes\nReferences\n*"
