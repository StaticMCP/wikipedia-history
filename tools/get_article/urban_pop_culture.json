Urban pop culture tends to be more cosmopolitan and liberal than mainstream culture, but is not without its own complex mores, reflecting, for example, the parent societies' ambivalence to sexuality.\nImpact on popular media\nThe impact of traditional popular media is more evident today than it has ever been. Since 1995, the number of nationally aired television commercials and popular sitcoms that use props, references, or slang from Inner cities continues to grow. Big screen movies are also other examples of how urban pop culture is impacting traditional pop culture. The hit movie Tropic Thunder is filled with references, images, and jokes that are common amongst the youth in Brooklyn, New York City and Los Angeles, California. Urban pop culture has also infiltrated the mainstream world of fashion, music, and even politics. During an interview former president George W. Bush was asked how he felt about a comment rapper Kanye West made about his administration's response efforts to Hurricane Katrina, and the former president included in his response that he was \"not a hater\"; a term that originated in New York City, and that is used mostly by rappers and youth.\nImpact of Hip-Hop\nUrban pop culture is now glorified and well-known as hip-hop. The Bronx neighborhood of New York City was the birthplace of early hip-hop music in the 1970s. It began as a cooperative effort by intersecting Black, Latino, and Caribbean American youth groups during block parties, which were neighborhood events where DJs played soul and funk music. Traces back to traditional African American styles of music, Motown, and funk.\nImpact on fashion\nAlong with Urban pop culture came the influence on the fashion industry. For a period of time, hip hop and urban pop culture were seen as a lower-class lifestyle. With the rise of hip hop and other genres came back your clothes, Chunky sneakers, and outward expression of brand logos. Within the fashion industry, urban pop culture was not recognized as something luxurious. Throughout the years, we see artists and figures within the community become recognized. For example, ASAP Rocky with Dior. Streetwear was the Gateway for marginalized communities to have a space within luxury and fashion.\nInternational influence\nKorea\nIn recent years, the rise of Korean pop culture has increased drastically. formerly known as K-pop, is influenced by mainstream hip-hop culture, reggae, and soul styles of music. K-pop artists are seen collaborating with large hip-hop influencers such as Nicki Minaj and SNOOP DOGG. The K-pop identity intersects with the American Urban identity. There is a rise in fashion trends that are commonly found in urban areas within the United States. Hairstyles and dancing are included as well.\nLatin America\nWithin Latin America, the use of Afrobeats and hip hop styles that are found commonly within urban areas of the United States and inner cities is becoming more popularized. Modern reggaeton intersects with modern rap and hip hop. The embracing of traditional features within oneself is also something that has become more popularized within Latin America.\nSee also\n* City Lore\n* Urban contemporary music\nReferences\nSources\n* Burt Glinn. 2001.
