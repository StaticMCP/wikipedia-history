      "text": "# Ōtani ware\n\nis a type of Japanese pottery most famously known for its large size. Ōtani is made in the part of Naruto, Tokushima known as Ōtani.\nHistory\nIn 2003, Ōtani pottery was designated as a national traditional handicraft.\nCharacteristics\nThe potter's wheel used in the production of Ōtani pottery is known as a 'nerokuro,' literally a 'lying potter's wheel.' One person must lie on their side and turn the wheel with their feet. The potter and the assistant must have perfect timing in order to create a successful product. Ōtani pottery is the only pottery in Japan that still uses this technique.\nThe large containers were used to hold indigo dye, a specialty of the region.\nThere are also many small bowls, tea ceremony tools, vases, cups, plates, and other forms of pottery made at Ōtani.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* http://www.tsci.or.jp/ooasa/ootaniyaki.html\n\n---\n\n## Otani ware\n\n#REDIRECT Ōtani ware"
