Occupying a full city block, it is a massive four-story brick building, with a central eight-story tower on its Markham Street facade. Built in 1926, it is despite its utilitarian use (now as a mixed-use space), a fine example of Venetian Gothic architecture, and a reminder of the city's long history as an important transportation hub.\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Little Rock, Arkansas\nReferences"
