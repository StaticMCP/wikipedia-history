Part of the longer Taff Trail (National Cycle Network Route 8), this section was enhanced with heritage interpretation in 2015 by Sustrans and Cardiff Council to highlight the industrial, coal, and iron history of the South Wales Valleys. It features 28 interpretive panels, audio points via the Taff Trail app, and links to museums and preserved sites.\nThe route is fully paved or compacted, suitable for families, cyclists, and most wheelchair users. It passes through urban parks, former industrial zones, and green corridors, promoting education on the South Wales Coalfield and the Industrial Revolution in Wales. In 2024, the full Taff Trail recorded over 500,000 users, with this heritage section contributing significantly to Cardiff’s £4.1 million annual tourism from walking/cycling routes.\nHistorical Context\nThe River Taff powered Wales’ industrial boom. From the 1780s, ironworks like Melincrythan and Merthyr Tydfil used waterwheels, while coal from the Rhondda was shipped via the Glamorganshire Canal (parallel to the trail). Cardiff Docks, opened 1839, became the world’s largest coal exporter by 1913, shipping 13 million tonnes annually. The trail interprets this via panels on figures like the Marquess of Bute, who built the docks, and the 1831 Merthyr Rising.\nDecline followed WWII; regeneration from the 1980s transformed the route into a greenway. \"The Taff Trail follows the river through a mix of urban and rural landscapes, passing historic sites and modern landmarks,\" states Sustrans.\nRoute Description\nThe linear route starts at Cardiff Bay Barrage and ends at Pontypridd’s Ynysangharad War Memorial Park. Elevation gain: 45 m. Average time: 4–5 hours walking, 1.5 hours cycling.
