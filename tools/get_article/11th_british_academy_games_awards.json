Paul Tassi of American business magazine Forbes claimed that the British Academy Video Games Awards \"might be [his] favorite show worldwide right now\", praising the \"sheer breadth and diversity of their award categories, and what they choose to honor\". Tassi went on to praise winning games such as The Vanishing of Ethan Carter (Game Innovation) and League of Legends (Persistent Game). Oliver Cragg of newspaper The Independent welcomed the strong presence of \"creative indie titles\" at the ceremony. A review written by GameCentral for newspaper Metro, however, went as far as to state that \"we’re not sure we agree with any of the awards, except for Alien Isolation and David Braben\", criticising \"nonsense\" such as a win for Minecraft, which was originally released years previously.\nThe majority of negative reactions to the ceremony related to Destiny winning the BAFTA for Best Game. Adam Rosser of BBC Radio 5 Live explained that \"There was an audible ripple of surprise in the press room as Destiny took the best game Bafta\", noting that the game had been \"criticised in many quarters for ... suffering from a sparsely populated game world and repetitive gameplay\". Some commentators supported the result, however: GamesRadar+, who named Destiny'' their game of the year, claimed that \"it's good to see Bungie's masterpiece getting the attention it deserves\". Entertainment Weeklys Jonathon Dornbush concluded that \"despite its flaws, Destiny has demonstrated why it’s tough to put the game down, and may be worth revisiting for those who initially wrote the game off\", while Forbes writer Paul Tassi claimed that Dragon Age: Inquisition was arguably the \"definitive\" game of the year.\nArguably one of the most surprising results was in the Sports category, where independent title OlliOlli beat out many bigger releases such as FIFA 15. Matt Kamen of Wired described this as a \"shocking win\", and Mark Langshaw of Digital Spy similarly dubbed it \"a shock\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://awards.bafta.org/award/2015/games 11th BAFTA Video Games Awards page]"
