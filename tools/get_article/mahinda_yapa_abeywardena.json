He was the Speaker of the Parliament of Sri Lanka from 2020 to 2024.\nPolitical career\nHe first entered parliament in 1983 as part of the Hakmana United National Party and has been active in politics for more than 30 years.\nMahinda Yapa Abeywardena was a young MP when he openly criticised the 1987 Indo-Sri Lanka Accord for establishing a new provincial councils system in Sri Lanka. He along with Chandrakumara Wijeya Gunawardena, the member for Kamburupitiya voted against the bill in Parliament becoming the only two government members who voted against it. He was later removed by the then President J. R. Jayewardene from his Parliamentary seat for violation of the party rules by not voting for the bill.\nHe later joined hands with Gamini Dissanayake and Lalith Athulathmudali (who were also against the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord) as they too quit United National Party and formed the Democratic United National Front or aka 'Rajaliya-front'. Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena then contested for Southern Provincial Council under DUNF and won. He was then elected as the opposition leader of the Southern Provincial Council in 1993, and he became the Chief Minister of the Southern Provincial Council in 1994. Elected twice as the Chief Minister he was in office from 1994 to 2001. He is said to be one of the most successful Chief Ministers from the south for developing the infrastructure that was neglected for more than 5 years due to the dark era of the country.\nHe left office to contest in the 2001 general elections and become an opposition MP and served until 2004. After the 2004 General elections, he became the Deputy Minister of Healthcare and later the Cabinet Minister for Cultural Affairs & National Heritage. After the 2010 General Elections, he was appointed as the Minister of Agriculture. Having been in office as the Minister of Agriculture for several years he was elected Vice Chairman at the 38th session of the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations FAO Conference held in Rome, Italy in 2013. He was again appointed as the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs in 2015 for a brief period until he resigned and joined the opposition.\nHe is a representative of Matara District in the Parliament of Sri Lanka. He resides in Kalubowila, Dehiwala.\nNo-confidence motion\nAbeywardena who was a Rajapakse ally was mostly criticized by the opposition and media for acting biased from the speaker's seat. On 5 March 2024, the main opposition party Samagi Jana Balawegaya handed over a no-confidence motion against him claiming his actions to failure to protect the constitution by signing the Online Safety Bill and ignoring the Supreme Court’s recommendations pertaining to Sections 13, 17, 20, 33 (6), 34 (1), 35 (1), 21, 22 and 33. This was the first no-confidence motion against a Speaker of Parliament in the history of Sri Lanka. He was also criticized for being blatantly violated at the constitutional council to appoint inspector general of police, when we did not have the voting authority, but cast his vote.\nSee also\n* Cabinet of Sri Lanka\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.parliament.lk/en/members-of-parliament/directory-of-members/viewMember/53 Parliament of Sri Lanka profile]\n}}"
