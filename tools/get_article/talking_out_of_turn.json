      "text": "# Talking Out of Turn\n\n\"Talking Out of Turn\" is a 1981 single written by John Lodge and first released by the Moody Blues  on their 1981 album Long Distance Voyager. It was also released as the third single from the album in November 1981 with  \"Veteran Cosmic Rocker\" on the B-side.\nThe song lasts more than seven minutes long.  It became a minor hit in the United States, reaching number 65 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 60 on Cash Box''. It did better in Canada, where it reached number 27.\nMusic and lyrics\nThe instrumentation is augmented by the New World Philharmonic Orchestra, with an arrangement scored by producer Pip Williams and keyboardist Pat Moraz.  Moraz also used a music sequencer to create the \"spronging\" sound that serves as the song's musical hook, which Williams felt gives the song a modern sound. Music journalist Geoffrey Freakes described Moraz' intro to the song as sounding like his former band Yes and described Justin Hayward's guitar solos as being \"almost histrionic by his standards.\" At the end of the song, violins prominently play a variation on the tune of the chorus.\nThe Star Press critic Kim Teverbaugh described the lyrics as being \"about love slipping away.\" Lodge said:\nWilliams called it \"An absolute favorite of mine and one of the best [John Lodge] songs ever.\"\nReception\nBillboard called it a \"soothingly melodic song highlighted by John Lodge's vocal.\"  Record World said that \"space-age synthesizers introduce Justin Hayward's relaxed vocal\" and commented on the \"rich harmony choruses.\"\nAllMusic critic Dave Connolly called it a \"winning number.\" Upon the album release, Teverbaugh said that it \"features what is probably the best use of strings on a song this year\" and also praised Justin Hayward's \"stinging guitar [runs]\" that punctuate almost every line. Ottawa Citizen critic Bill Provick said that it deserved to be a hit single and that \"Plush without being mushy,it takes on a marvelously haunting air under repeated listenings with a fine chorus that lingers on nicely in one's head.\" Sacramento Bee critic Bob Sylva called it a \"moving ballad\" with a \"sweet lyric\" and \"expressive, expert guitar work by Justin Hayward\", but also found it to be \"a tad too long and repetitive.\" Daily Press critic Mike Diana said that \"the Moody's go south of the border for laughs and some of Lodge's useless blathering.\" Roanoke Times writer Ben Cromer called it \"syrupy and downright boring.\" News-Democrat critic Roger Schlueter criticized the \"unimaginative lyrics.\"\nOther appearances\n\"Talking Out of Turn\" was included in the set list at most of the Moody Blues' live concerts throughout the 1980s. Subsequently, it was played live occasionally, with Lodge playing acoustic guitar.\nThe instrumental final minute of the song closes the first hour of The Mike Malloy Show each weekday evening.\nChart history\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1981–82)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|Canada RPM Top Singles\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|27\n|-\n|US Billboard Hot 100\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|65\n|-\n|US Cash Box'' Top 100\n|align=\"center\"|60\n|-\n|}\nPersonnel\n* John Lodge – lead vocals, 12-string acoustic guitar, bass\n* Justin Hayward – backing vocals and acoustic & electric guitars\n* Ray Thomas – backing vocals\n* Patrick Moraz – Polymoog, Yamaha CS80, vocoder and Minimoog\n* Graeme Edge – drums, overdubbed cymbals and Simmons drums\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
