Its conclusion contains the famous phrase that:\nNevertheless, the court did not find for the applicant, who had been fined for publishing a book deemed to be obscene.\nFacts\nRichard Handyside, proprietor of \"Stage 1\" publishers, purchased British rights of The Little Red Schoolbook, written by Søren Hansen and Jesper Jensen and published, as of 1976, in Denmark, Belgium, Finland, France, West Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland, as well as several non-European countries.\nIts chapter on pupils contained a 26-page section concerning \"Sex\". Handyside sent out several hundred review copies of the book, together with a press release, to a selection of publications from national and local newspapers to educational and medical journals. He also placed advertisements for the book. The book became subject of extensive press comment, both favourable and not.\nOn 31 March 1971, 1,069 copies of the book were provisionally seized together with leaflets, posters, showcards, and correspondence relating to its publication and sale. On 1 April 1971, 139 more copies were seized. About 18,800 copies of a total print of 20,000 copies were missed and subsequently sold.\nOn 8 April, a magistrates' court issued two summonses against Handyside for having in his possession obscene books for publication for gain. Handyside ceased distribution of the book and advised bookshops accordingly but, by that time, some 17,000 copies were already in circulation.\nOn 1 July 1971, Handyside was found guilty of both offences and fined £25 on each summons and ordered to pay £110 costs. His appeal was rejected.\nProceedings before the European Court of Human Rights\nThe application was lodged by Handyside in 1972.\nIn 1975, the European Commission of Human Rights had adopted its report on the case, finding no violations of Convention rights, and specifically articles 10, 17, and P1-1 by a majority (no violation of article 18 was found unanimously).\nIn 1976, court's chamber relinquished jurisdiction in favour of the plenary court.\nJudgment\nUsing the margin of appreciation doctrine, the court held by thirteen votes to one that the interference in Handyside's freedom of expression was both prescribed by law, having a legitimate aim and necessary in a democratic society, thus there was no violation of article 10 ECHR. Importantly, the case bore considerable development for the doctrine of the margin of appreciation. The Court reasoned:\n}}\nJudge H. Mosler disagreed and filed a dissenting opinion, considering that violation did take place due to interference not being necessary.\nThe court had also held unanimously that Handyside's property rights (article 1 of protocol 1) were not violated. Judge M. Zekia filed a concurring opinion in this question.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId=695376&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECtHR judgment]\n*[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=open&documentId=803266&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 Report of the European Commission of Human Rights]"
