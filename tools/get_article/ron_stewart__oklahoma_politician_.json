      "text": "# Ron Stewart (Oklahoma politician)\n\nRon Stewart is an American politician who has served in the Oklahoma House of Representatives representing 73rd district since November 2024.\nCareer\nStewart is a citizen of the Choctaw Nation and of Muscogee Freedmen descent. He worked as a firefighter and paramedic with the Tulsa Fire Department for 18 years. He also owns a small office building he rents to businesses.\nOklahoma House\nStewart ran for the Oklahoma House of Representatives' 73rd district to succeed Regina Goodwin, who retired to run for the Oklahoma Senate's 11th district. He faced Darrell Knox in the Democratic primary and was endorsed by Jabar Shumate. He won the June primary election and the general election was cancelled since no non-Democratic candidates filed for the district.\nIn February 2025, despite himself being a Choctaw citizen, Stewart introduced Bill 1118 in the Oklahoma House, that would \"terminate any agreements, compacts and funds of the state of Oklahoma possessed by the tribes if they do not grant fair and equal rights to their freedman citizens.\" As the Cherokee Nation grants citizenship to their freedmen descendents, the bill is explicitly targeted at the Muscogee, Seminole, Chickasaw, and the Choctaw. In an article for the Tulsa World, he claimed the intention of his bill was \"not to force tribes to change their policies, but to force us to have a courageous and constructive conversation.\"\nReferences"
