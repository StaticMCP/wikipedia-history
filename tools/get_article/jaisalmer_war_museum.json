The inauguration of the Museum took place in the Golden Jubilee Commemoration Year of the 1965 India Pakistan War.\nConcept\nThe Jaisalmer War Museum was conceptualised to display India's rich military history and showcase real war efforts as they happened in the past. The Jaisalmer War Museum aims to promote greater awareness of the sacrifice made by heroes of the Indian Army, in particular, and Indian Armed Forces in general.\nChronology\nThe idea of establishing a War Museum at Jaisalmer in the state of Rajasthan was mooted by Lieutenant General Bobby Mathews, AVSM, VSM, General Officer Commanding, Konark Corps, with a view to showcase India's military history and war time experiences. Jaisalmer district was chosen for its rich martial traditions and for being witness to numerous battles including the famous Battle of Laungewala in 1971. The task of constructing and setting up the Jaisalmer War Museum on an area of flat, barren ground, within the Jaisalmer Military Station, was subsequently undertaken by the Desert Corps of the Indian Army, under the guidance of Lieutenant General Mathews.\nLaungewala Hall\nThe Hall showcases the progression of the Battle of Laungewala as it took place on the night of 4 December 1971. The Hall also displays Indian Army operations on Eastern and Western Sectors during Indo-Pak War 1971. The 106mm RCL Gun displayed in the Central Foyer had a vital role in stopping the initial armour assault during the Battle of Laungewala.\nIndian Army Hall\nThe Indian Army hall showcases the wars fought in 1947-48, 1965 and 1999 (Kargil). The Hall also displays arms and ammunition captured and equipment used during various wars by the Indian Army. Various facets of the role of Indian Army in national development, disaster relief and aid to civil authorities are well documented in the Indian Army Hall.\nGallery\nFile:The Entrance Gate from NH-15, Jaisalmer War Museum.png|Entrance Gate from NH-15\nFile:Panaromic view of Laungewala Hall, Jaisalmer War Museum.png|Laungewala Hall\nFile:A panaromic view of the Indian Army Hall, Jaisalmer War Museum.png|Indian Army Hall\nFile:Siachen Warrior, Jaisalmer War Museum.png|Siachen Warrior\nFile:The Indian Army Cycle Warriors of WW I.png|WWI Indian Army Cycle Warriors\nFile:Depiction of an Artillery Gun team during Operation Vijay, 1999.png|Artillery Gun team during Operation Vijay, 1999\nFile:Genesis of the Indian Army, Jaisalmer War Museum.png|Genesis of the Indian Army\nFile:Weapons on display in the Indian Army Hall, Jaisalmer War Museum.png|Weapons in the Indian Army Hall\nFile:War equipment on display, Jaisalmer War Museum.png|War equipment\nFile:Captured enemy tanks, Jaisalmer War Museum.png|Captured enemy tanks\nFile:Audio Visual Hall, Jaisalmer War Museum.png|Audio Visual Hall\nReception\nThe Museum has been well received by the local population and the media.\nThe museum is open all year round.
