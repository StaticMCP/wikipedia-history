This was the first movie that Henry Hathaway (director of the original True Grit) directed.\nFilmed on location in Red Rock Canyon State Park in California, Heritage of the Desert provided Randolph Scott with his first starring role. Released by Paramount Pictures, the film is a remake of Paramount's successful silent version from 1924 which utilised early two-strip technicolor. One of hundreds of Paramount films made between 1929 and 1949, tied up in legal limbo by Universal which controls them.\nPlot\nBased on the 1910 novel The Heritage of the Desert by Zane Grey, the film is about a rancher whose spread includes the only way out of the valley where an outlaw is hiding a huge herd of stolen cattle. When the outlaw decides to challenge the rancher's claim to the land, the rancher stays one step ahead of him and hires a surveyor to remap and confirm the property lines.\nCast\n* Randolph Scott as Jack Hare\n* Sally Blane as Judy\n* J.
