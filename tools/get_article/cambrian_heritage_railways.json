It operates trains on two stretches of line: between Oswestry–, and between –.\nFormed after the 2009 merger of the Cambrian Railways Society (CRS) and the Cambrian Railways Trust (CRT), it aims to reinstate the infrastructure required to operate trains from Gobowen to Llynclys Junction (for Pant) and to Blodwel.\nCambrian Heritage Railways also operates the Cambrian Railways Museum in the Oswestry railway station's former goods depot. Displays include photographs, signs, lamps, signal box fittings and artefacts related to the history of the Cambrian Railways.\nHistory\nIn 1972, a group of enthusiasts established the Cambrian Railways Society, which obtained a lease from BR over the former Oswestry goods yard and Oswestry South Signalbox. The CRS established a museum in the former CR goods shed and acquired either directly, or through members, a number of steam and diesel engines plus associated rolling stock. In 1997, BR agreed to allow CRS to run trains under a Light Railway Order to Middleton Road, over a track of  in length. The CRS then purchased the freehold of Weston Wharf goods yard and shed with the help of the Heritage Lottery Fund. After quarry trains finished in 1988, the CRS obtained further agreement from BR to run occasional works/inspection trains (i.e. non-passenger carrying, non-revenue earning) over the line to Blodwel.\nIn 1998, to secure the trackbed and return trains to the residual CR lines, a wider community group of the CRS, Oswestry Council and local business people formed the Cambrian Railways Trust, to acquire the railway between Gobowen and Blodwel. Once secured, the CRT would hand over the legal agreement to the CRS to actually run trains. In 1997, the CRT obtained funding to carry out a business study of the plans and subsequently agreed to purchase the track from Railtrack. By 2001, planning permission had been obtained for the entire project, along with a supporting business plan and funding.\nHowever, after government-owned company Network Rail replaced Railtrack, they stopped negotiations and broke off the deal, stating that they would only deal with a local council. As a result, the CRS withdrew from the CRT and went back to new direct negotiations with Network Rail. After negotiations failed for a second time, the CRS established a third base on part of the Nantmawr branch at Llanddu Junction.\nThe enthusiasts left in CRT decided to embark on their own project, having been offered the freehold of the trackbed between Llynclys and Pant. After obtaining European Union grant aid through Oswestry Borough Council's tourism initiative, the trackbed was purchased by the council and leased to the CRT. From 2003/4, the CRT began rebuilding the track bed, which allowed trains to run from July 2005. Further grants from DEFRA and the EU allowed this small operation to expand, in both track as well as rolling stock assets. This culminated in the building of Llynclys South station.\nIn 2005, the council bought the semi-derelict Oswestry railway station, refurbishing it with grant aid to provide both a visitor and small business centre. It established the Oswestry Station Building Trust to manage the building and provide information on the old CR. Also in 2005 the CRT obtained via match-funding an HLF grant to establish a new business plan to reinstate the railway between Gobowen, Llynclys and Blodwel.\nAfter completion of the study, the CRT proposed a merger with the CRS and the Oswestry Station Building Trust. This would enable: the assets of all three organisations to be merged; duplication of effort in restoring the railway to be removed; a revenue stream which would enable such efforts to continue; and a resultant organisation capable of obtaining monies to restore the railway at an earlier date. This was agreed to in 2009, resulting in the formation of the new trust company, Cambrian Heritage Railways'.\nThrough a ballot at an Extraordinary General Meeting held at Oswestry railway station on 20 November 2009, members of both the CRS and CRT agreed that:\n*Every member of the CRS and CRT automatically becomes a member of the recently formed Cambrian Heritage Railways (CHR) Ltd\n*The CRT and CRS work towards transferring assets from the CRT to CHR Ltd.; and\n*Various functions of both groups be combined to avoid duplication of costs and efforts.\nOperations\nThe CHR currently operates trains on two stretches of line: between –, and between – on the former CRT Llynclys South to Pant line.\nThe CHR has moved the museum collections of the CRS into Oswestry station, while retaining the former goods shed as an engine and rolling stock restoration point. CHR is also restoring more of the railway infrastructure in Oswestry to operational condition, and since 2006 has restored the former Oswestry South Signal Box, thanks to a £22,000 grant from the Oswestry Visitor Facilities Infrastructure fund.\nThe first steam passenger services ran on the CHR on 24 August 2007, with a DMU trailer coach worked by ex-Hams Hall Peckett No. 1738/1928 on loan for two weekends from the Kingfisher Line. It was the first steam locomotive at Llynclys since the closure of the Oswestry-Welshpool section of the Cambrian in 1964.\nExtension developments\nThe Cambrian Heritage Railway is extending and repairing track from Llynclys South northwards towards Oswestry to enable trains to run into the former Cambrian Railway headquarters at Oswestry. The line between Llynclys Junction and the A483 level crossing at Weston on the Oswestry bypass was largely cleared and was visited by HM Railways Inspectorate in September 2009 with recommendations made.\nAdditional working-party activities have concentrated on the eastern edge of Dolgoch housing estate between Porth-y-waen and Llynclys and the A483 road bridge at Llynclys. Efforts are soon expected to be directed from the Dolgoch housing estate west towards Blodwel, which will link up with an already cleared section at Porth-y-waen.\nRecent work has concentrated on reinstating track from then railhead south of Oswestry station, to Weston Wharf, where there is a craft brewery and other recreational facilities. Before this extension was realised, work was required prior to track being re-laid: the replacement of the Middleton Road Footbridge; lowering of the trackbed under Gasworks Bridge; and the replacement of the Cattle Creep girders beyond Travis Perkins.\nBy December 2018, ballast was laid from the current railhead to Gasworks Bridge and from the Cattle Creep north to near the bridleway crossing at Travis Perkins. Concrete sleepers were laid from the railhead to where the sewer passes under the track, at which point steel sleepers were laid. Concrete sleepers had also been laid for about 200m north from the Cattle Creep. Work progressed, using mechanical help, in spacing and aligning the sleepers.\nEarly in 2019, a contractor fixed the rail-bearing chairs to the concrete slab under Gasworks Bridge. Work on Gasworks Bridge was completed and trains can run under it. Track has been laid at Weston Wharf after the rolling stock that was stored there had been moved. Sections for the new station at Weston Wharf were delivered and installed. The extension to Weston was completed and opened for service on 2 April 2022.\nT&WA Order\nThe CHR applied for a Transport & Works Act Order for transfer of Network Rail's residual rights to itself and this was granted on 28 February 2017. This permits the CHR to reopen the route from Gobowen to Blodwel Quarry, subject to level crossings of the A5 and A483 being replaced by a tunnel and overbridge respectively.\nStations of the Cambrian Heritage Railways\nCambrian Railway (Oswestry)\n* (future interchange for commuter services to the National Rail network)\n*\n*\n*\n*Llynclys North (located at the exact site of Llynclys Junction, this will be the replacement station site to the former  station site as well as the future junction station towards Blodwel)\n*\n*\nCambrian Railway (Llynclys)\n*Gobowen (future interchange for commuter services to the National Rail network)\n*Park Hall Halt\n*Oswestry\n*Weston Wharf\n* (current northern terminus)\n* (current southern terminus)\nLocations and map\n|52.8611|-3.0499 | | | |name=Oswestry Station}}\n|52.8414|-3.0429 | | | |name=Weston Wharf Station}}\nNot Open Yet\n|52.8092|-3.0629 | | | |name=(Former) Llynclys Station}} Closed\n|52.8078|-3.0638 | | | |name=Llynclys South Station}}\n|52.8006|-3.1111 | | | |name=Blodwell Junction Station}} Closed\n|52.8107|-3.0826 | | | |name=Porthywaen Halt}} Closed\n|52.7985|-3.0697 | | | |name=Penygarreg Lane Halt}}\nLocomotives\nThe locomotive fleet currently based on the line is listed below.\nOswestry–Weston Wharf section\nSteam Locomotives\n*Andrew Barclay Sons & Co. 0-6-0ST no. 885 of 1900.
