Nigel Horton began his career at Kings Norton and went on to represent England. Nick Baxter has represented The Barbarians, England Students, England Sevens, Worcester Warriors, Pertemps Bees, and Stourbridge.\nCounty boundary changes and housing development forced the club to move away from Bells Lane in 1973, and members worked hard to raise sufficient funds to purchase 12½ acres of agricultural land. A two-storey clubhouse and three rugby pitches were laid out.\nHaving weathered the initial difficulties, the new 2001/2 committee put together a three-year action plan designed to ensure survival and put the foundations for progress in place. Many of the goals it set for itself were achieved well ahead of schedule, and a revised plan had to be swiftly prepared. A ground-leveling scheme involving landfill was completed in 2003; this will eventually provide an extra small pitch ideal for youth rugby.\nKings Norton RFC play an active and important part in the local community, running 3 Senior Men's teams including a Veterans, they also have a thriving junior section which offers rugby for as young as Under-6 through to Under-16's. There is also a growing Girls rugby division within the club.\nThey also have strong links to local schools and colleges, providing sponsorship and coaching to teams from as many as 9 schools, whilst holding annual and monthly tag-tournaments for all ages.\nPlayers of all ages and abilities are welcome to KNRFC.\nSenior training is Tuesday and Thursday, 7:30pm start.\nJuniors of all ages is Sunday, 10:15am\nClub honors\n*North Midlands Vase winners (2): 2005–06, 2006-07\nReferences\nSee also\n* [https://www.pitchero.com/clubs/kingsnorton/ Kings Norton RFC website]"
