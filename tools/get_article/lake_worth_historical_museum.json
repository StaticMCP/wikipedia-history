The museum is located on the second floor of the Old Lake Worth City Hall at 414 Lake Avenue and is currently open on Wednesday and Friday from 1:00-4:00&nbsp;p.m.\nExhibits\nDisplays include hundreds of photos of the history of the City including downtown businesses, the municipal beach, churches, municipal buildings and parks.\nTextile exhibits show visitors how the pioneers dressed and \"modern conveniences\" such as the ice box and the wringer washer reveal how early residents lived and worked. Items on display range in size from the very large (such as the telephone switchboard from a hotel) to the much smaller (such as the collection of cameras and medical instruments). Display cases maintained by local Finns, Poles and Lithuanians are highlights of the heritage exhibits.\nHistorical maps\n1928 Sanborn maps book (updated 1940; 1947) depicts most of the City, block by block, house by house. Photos of each page can be found at [https://picasaweb.google.com/102852068852013368843/LakeWorthFloridaSanbornMaps    Map Images].\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.lakeworth.org/visitors/museums/ Lake Worth Historical Museum]"
