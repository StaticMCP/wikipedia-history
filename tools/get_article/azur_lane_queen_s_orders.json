It was later revealed to be an original video animation (OVA) in September 2022. The OVA, consisting of two episodes, was released on July 27, 2023, on Blu-ray; the animation was initially due for a May 10 release but was delayed due to technical difficulties. The OVA is animated by Yostar Pictures and written by Yū Yamashita, with Masahide Yanagisawa, Yuzo Hirata and Niimura Kana designing the characters, and Daisuke Horita composing the music. The OVA's theme song is \"Bloomin'\" by Queen Elizabeth (Sumire Uesaka).\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
