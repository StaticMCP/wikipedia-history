The number of awards expanded to include 'Players' Player of the Season' (as well as Fans' Player), Goal of the season and Women's Player of the season, as well as a number of other awards for academy players, technical staff and fans other outstanding services to the club.\nAwards ceremony\nAwards dinner\nSince the introduction of the awards dinner, the awards have been presented after the end of the Premier League season, usually at the start of May but held at any point during the month.
