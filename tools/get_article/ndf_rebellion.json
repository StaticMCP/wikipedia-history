The National Democratic Front (NDF) was supported in its rebellion by South Yemen and Libya. The NDF enjoyed various successes throughout the early phases of the conflict, although its foreign support dwindled after the peace treaty between North and South Yemen following the 1979 border war.\nThere were several attempts at ceasefires between the government and the NDF. Kuwait managed to facilitate the signing of a ceasefire between the government and the NDF on 26 November 1981, although hostilities re-erupted in December 1981. Later, the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) was able to mediate a ceasefire agreement on 3 April 1982, but hostilities began again later that same month, with the NDF capturing Juban. Government forces in turn attacked NDF positions in Juban in the following month and retook the territory.\nMay 1982 and the defeat of the rebellion\nSouth Yemeni support for the NDF diminished under the presidency of the less overtly militant Ali Nasir Muhammad, and their support for the NDF finally ended in May 1982. Dhamar, a major NDF stronghold, sustained major damage during the 1982 North Yemen earthquake. The NDF was eventually defeated by a reorganized North Yemeni Army in conjunction with the pro-government Islamic Front, allowing the North Yemeni government to finally establish control over the North-South border region.\nSee also\n*List of wars involving Yemen\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
