He was educated at Charterhouse School, before going up to Exeter College, Oxford. While at Oxford, he made his debut in first-class cricket for the Gentlemen of England against Oxford University in 1879 at Oxford. The following season he played first-class cricket for Oxford University, making five appearances and gaining a blue. He made an additional first-class appearance in 1880 when he played for the Gentlemen of Kent against the Gentlemen of England at Canterbury. In seven first-class matches, Colebrook scored 161 runs at an average of 13.41, with a high score of 34 not out. After graduating from Oxford, he became a priest in the Church of England. He died without issue at Canterbury in August 1939. His nephews Kenneth Hutchings, Frederick Hutchings and William Hutchings all played first-class cricket, with Kenneth playing at Test level for England.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
