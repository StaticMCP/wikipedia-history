She belonged to the British Royal Navy's Transport Board and was based at Port Jackson. There she made voyages for the colonial government along the east coast of Australia with goods and troops. She made one voyage to Ceylon for merchandise and transporting military convicts from Ceylon to Australia. She returned to England in 1817 and the Navy sold her in 1818.\nCareer\nGovernor Lachlan Macquarie on 30 April 1810 requested the British Government supply the colony with two brigs (colonial ships) that would not be subject to the\ncontrol of the Admiralty. The British government provided Kangaroo and Emu. The American privateer Holkar, captained by J. Rolland, captured Emu in 1812 on her outward-bound voyage.\nLieutenant Charles Jefferys (or Jeffreys), received a letter of marque on 1 March 1813.

She returned with merchandise, passengers and a number of military convicts, arriving in Sydney on 7 February 1816.\nOn 14 April 1816 Kangaroo again carried 40 male and 60 female convicts to Van Diemen's Land.\nOn 5 August 1816 Kangaroo left Port Jackson with 50 male convicts each to Port Dalrymple Hobart.\nGovernor Lachlan Macquarie sent Kangeroo back to England after he determined that she was unsuitable for the colony. She left on 9 April 1817. Amongst her passengers were the Maori chiefs Tītore and Tui (also known as Tuhi or Tupaea. They visited Professor Samuel Lee at Cambridge University and assisted him in the preparation of a grammar and vocabulary of Māori, which was published in 1820 as the First Grammar and Vocabulary of the New Zealand Language.\nFate\nThe \"Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy\" offered the \"Kangaroo brig, of 203 tons\", \"lying at Deptford\", for sale on 13 August 1818.\nCitations\nReferences\n*\n*"
