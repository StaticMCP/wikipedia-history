It was founded on 2 August 2010 and is one of the few ethnic minority parties to have formed an alliance with the Union Solidarity and Development Party, a move which has damaged the party's legitimacy amongst some Kachin people. The party currently had two representatives in the Union Hluttaw (2010-2015), Daw Doi Bu and U Hkyet Thing Nan, representing the Injanyang constituency and Myitkyina Constituency. Since April 2018, the UDPKS is in the merging process of becoming one Kachin Party, Kachin State Party, with Kachin State Democracy Party, Kachin Democratic Party and Kachin National Congress through the support from civil society organizations in Kachin State.\nReferences"
