The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film was created in 1956 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to honour non-English-speaking films produced outside the United States. The award is handed out annually, and is accepted by the winning film's director, although it is considered an award for the submitting country as a whole. Countries are invited by the Academy to submit their best films for competition according to strict rules, with only one film being accepted from each country.\nFor the 39th Academy Awards, nineteen films were submitted in the category Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Romania submitted a film to the competition for the first time. The five nominated films came from Czechoslovakia, France, Italy, Poland and Yugoslavia.\nFrance won for the seventh time with A Man and a Woman by Claude Lelouch, which also won for Best Story and Screenplay – Written Directly for the Screen, alongside nomination for Best Director and Best Actress (Anouk Aimée).\nSubmissions\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!
