GameSpy called the CCG mechanics decent and panned the weak single-player campaign mode and bad presentation. GameZone gave the game 5 out of 10 and wrote, \"Battle for Atluma is a good package for any lover of the card game, but it doesn’t offer anything special to draw outsiders into the experience.\" GamesRadar+ cited the accessibility, custom decks, and campaign mode as positives while taking issue with the lack of Warhammer aesthetics, simplistic gameplay, and card text readability issues.\nReferences"
