Since 2018, the HDG is also responsible to establish the imperative mandate for the vote on international scheduling by member state of the EU at the Commission on Narcotic Drugs.\nThe HDG engages and closely collaborates with other EU institutions like the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction and Europol.\nThere are frequent meetings of EU countries' national drugs coordinators held as part of HDG meetings. In addition, the HDG regularly meets with delegates from other regions and third countries within the EU's area of interest (Russia, Turkey, the Western Balkans, the United States within a so-called \"Transatlantic Dialogue\", Western Africa, Andes Community, and with countries from Latin America and the Caribbean within the \"Technical Committee EU/LAC\").\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/preparatory-bodies/horizontal-working-party-drugs/ HDG page on the website of the Council]"
