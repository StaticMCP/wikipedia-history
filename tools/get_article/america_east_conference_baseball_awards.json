Currently, it names a Coach, Pitcher, Player, and Rookie of the Year. With the exception of Rookie of the Year, which was added in 1996, the awards date to the 1990 season, the conference's first season of baseball. Through the 1996 season, the awards were known as the major awards of the North Atlantic Conference, the America East's former name.\nThrough the end of the 2019 season, Stony Brook has won 21 major awards, the most of any school in the conference. Maine has the second highest total, with 20. Three other schools have at least ten: Binghamton (19), Delaware (17), and Vermont (10).\nIn the conference's 25–year history, a single team has swept the awards six times. Three instances came before 1996 (when the conference Rookie of the Year was added as the fourth award): Central Connecticut in 1990 and Delaware in 1992 and 1995. Since 1996, Stony Brook swept the awards in 2011 and 2012, and Hartford did so in 2018.\nCoach of the Year\nThe conference's Coach of the Year award is presented annually to its most outstanding baseball coach, as chosen by a vote of the conference's coaches at the end of the regular season. The award was first presented in 1990 and was known as the North Atlantic Conference Coach of the Year award through the 1996 season, after which the conference adopted its current name.\nIn 2014, Stony Brook's Matt Senk won the award for the third time, after the Seawolves went 33–16 in the regular season and won the America East's regular season title. Senk won four awards in five years from 2011 to 2015. 2014 was the sixth consecutive season in which the award was presented to the coach whose team won the conference's regular season title.\nBinghamton head coach Tim Sinicki has won the most Coach of the Year awards, with six.\nMaine is the only school to have multiple coaches win the award. Paul Kostacopoulos won it in 1997 and 2001, and Steve Trimper won it in 2013.\nWinners by season\nThe following is a table of the award's winners in each season since it was inaugurated in 1990.
