I. Sawyer Heritage Air Museum is a military aviation museum located at the Marquette Sawyer Regional Airport near Marquette, Michigan focused on the history of K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base.\nHistory\nThe museum was founded in 1993 by the Air Force Association Lake Superior Chapter 283 to preserve a number of aircraft on display at K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base following an announcement that the base would close. Without a sponsoring organization, the aircraft would be transferred to other locations by the Air Force. The museum was originally located in a gymnasium, but later moved to the Silver Wings Recreation Center.\nThe museum dedicated a new memorial in 2023.\nCollection\nAircraft\n* Boeing B-52D Stratofortress\n* Convair F-106A Delta Dart\n* General Dynamics FB-111A Aardvark\n* Lockheed T-33\n* McDonnell F-101B Voodoo\nOther\n* ADM-20 Quail\nSee also\n* List of aviation museums\n* Wurtsmith Air Museum\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.uppermichiganssource.com/2022/11/16/help-preserve-military-history-ki-sawyer-heritage-air-museum Help Preserve Military History at K.I.
