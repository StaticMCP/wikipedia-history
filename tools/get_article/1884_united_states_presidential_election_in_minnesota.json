Voters chose seven representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nMinnesota was won by Republican nominee, James G. Blaine, over the Democratic nominee, Grover Cleveland. Blaine won the state by a margin of 21.91%.\nWith 58.78% of the popular vote, Minnesota would prove to be Blaine's second strongest victory in terms of percentage in the popular vote after Vermont.\nAs of 2020, this remains the last time that a Republican presidential nominee would win a majority of the vote in Minnesota while losing nationally. This is also the first time since statehood that the state voted for the losing candidate.\nResults\n}}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Minnesota\nReferences"
