Even before the production of this film, there was a demand to make a biographical film of Bangabandhu as a state initiative. Actor Raj from East Pakistan announced to make a film about him titled Bangabandhu in 1970. In an interview given to the weekly Chitrali in 1988, Farooque revealed his plan to make a film about Mujib. It was reported by India Today in 2008 that Abdul Gaffar Chowdhury planned to make a film about Bangabandhu titled The Poet of Politics. It was rumored that it would be directed by Shyam Benegal and Amitabh Bachchan would be cast as the main character in the film. However, the film was not made. In 2010, Vibgyor Films had planned to make a film about Bangabandhu in Hollywood. It was learned that the shooting of the film was scheduled to start in 2011. Giasuddin Selim wanted to make a film based on The Unfinished Memoirs, an autobiography book of Mujib, but he backed out due to lack of budget. On 3 December 2015, the then Minister of Cultural Affairs named Asaduzzaman Noor officially announced the Hasina government desire to make a biopic of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. He also said that his ministry has discussed the matter with the Prime Minister and she has given the green signal. Later, Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, informed to the Bangladeshi prime minister named Sheikh Hasina the desire to produce a film on the life of her father by his government. His proposal was liked by her. However, in that time, Hasina suggested to Modi that Bangladesh should jointly produce the proposed film with India. On 17 August 2016, Venkaiah Naidu, the then information minister of India, declared the acceptance of the proposal to assist the production of the biographical film of Bangabandhu by the then information minister of Bangladesh Hasanul Haq Inu. On 8 April 2017, in the presence of Sheikh Hasina at the Hyderabad House in New Delhi, Narendra Modi officially announced the joint-production of the film.\nDevelopment\n}}\nOn 27 August 2017, an agreement was signed between the Government of Bangladesh and India in the capital of India. One of the purposes of the agreement was to make a film on Bangabandhu. On 18 March 2018, the Government of Bangladesh announced that the preliminary work of making the film would start from that year. A film committee was formed with 19 people from Bangladesh and India to implement the film project. The coordinator of the committee was the additional secretary of the Ministry of Information of Bangladesh. Hasanul Haq Inu organized several meetings regarding Bangabandhu's biopic during his tenure as Information Minister. Film directors and experts participating in the meetings gave their opinion in favor of directing the film by any director of the country. So it was initially decided that the film would be directed by Nasiruddin Yousuff. But the film committee chose Shyam Benegal as the director when three directors from India were nominated in July 2018}} Shyam Benegal accepted the offer to direct the film as he felt that the main character of the film was an interesting character in his time.}} On 27 August 2018, Tarana Halim officially announced his name as the director of the film on behalf of the Government of Bangladesh. In 2019, it was announced that a three-member expert team from Bangladesh would be formed to assist the film's director. It was decided that the team would include a historian, an acquaintance of Mujib and an experienced film personality. Sheikh Hasina initially did not want to be included in the production but Benegal later forced her. On 1 April 2019, Shyam Benegal visited Bangladesh to discuss the film project with Sheikh Hasina and film associates. The budget of the film was set at  ৳40 crore at a meeting held in New Delhi on 7 May 2019. But it was learned later from Nuzhat Yeasmin, one of executive producers of the film that the budget of this film is ৳83 crore. as of June 2021}} Bangladesh has given ৳50 crore of the budget and India has given ৳33 crore.

On 6 October 2019, the director talked with Sheikh Hasina in a meeting at New Delhi for the film. Later another film related agreement was finalised on 14 January 2020. Shyam Benegal further said that this is a Bengali nationalist film. Sheikh Hasina wanted the language of the film to be in English or Hindustani or Urdu. But Shyam Benegal decided to make the film in Bengali, the state language of Bangladesh. Benegal does not know Bengali, for this reason he had to enlist the help of translators. Two years later its official title was announced. The director gave the name to the film as the meaning of Mujib is significant.\nCharacter\nCharacter development of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was a difficult task for Benegal. As steadfast as Mujib was to his political ideals and movements, he gave importance to his family And he was more of a family man than all the important personalities of the Indian subcontinent. And so his life is presented in this film from an emotional point of view. The director said that Mujib will be portrayed in a balanced manner in the film.\nWriting\nAtul Tiwari planned to visit Bangladesh in May 2019 as part of his film research. Piplu Khan was his helper and research related assistant. Atul Tiwari visited Bangladesh with Shama Zaidi on 19 May and investigated the biopic related historical places.

Some famous film related figures of Bangladesh criticized it. Among the critics were Gias Uddin Selim, Farooque, Mahmud Didar and Khijir Hayat Khan. Nasiruddin Yousuff thinks that it would have been better if the director of the film was Bangladeshi. Abul Hayat and Toukir Ahmed were positive in this regard. However, Shyam Benegal pointed out that the biopic of Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the Indian nation, was made by a foreigner. On the other hand, Kaushik Ganguly thinks it is a simple matter because Bangabandhu is like Kazi Nazrul Islam who is the wealth of both India and Bangladesh. According to Syed Borhan Kabir, Benegal was a talented director in his early life but it is not possible for him to give any good films in this era.\nCasting\nAlthough Jannatul Sumaiya Heme's name was on the list published by BFDC, the director did not include her name on his own list.

Jyotika Jyoti complained on social media that although she was selected for acting twice, she was dropped due to corruption in the Bangladesh part of the production team. Jyotika Jyoti also said that when he contacted Shyam Benegal to find out why he was dropped, he informed her that since he was told that she was busy with other work, he dropped her. After the release of the trailer of the film, Shuvoo received negative response. The trailer captured his weak performance which the people of Bangladesh could not accept.

The trailer was criticised for many issues. Hashibur Reza Kallol, a filmmaker, criticised the trailer. But Kingshuk Chaterjee, a history professor from the University of Calcutta, hinted that it is normal because even Gandhi and Jinnah could not escape criticism.

He also wanted to make it clear that he is more interested in calling it a teaser than a movie trailer. He also indirectly acknowledged the flaws in the trailer.\nPolitics\nJawad Antu of Somoy TV thinks that since Sheikh Mujibur Rahman is the idol of Bangladesh Awami League, a group of people in Bangladesh have unreasonably criticized its trailer, thinking it is a propaganda film of the political party. According to Deep Halder of ThePrint, Sheikh Hasina released the hastily produced film to impress the citizens for the 2024 Bangladeshi general election which will not actually help her in politics.\nHistoricity\nFilm personality Mir Shamsul Alam Babu pointed that while the second trailer showed the present Arts faculty building of Dhaka University, it was in the area of Dhaka Medical College Hospital in 1947. He found discrepancies between the scenes of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's return to his homeland in 1972 shown in the film with the historical account. Although Bangabandhu's residence had only two rooms in 1961, the trailer shows Mujib's family entering the entire two-story building.
