It is just outside the Joshua Tree National Park, in the U.S. state of California.\nThe dwelling is a modern, unique in design, and has been featured in numerous architectural books and magazines. The cubic shape, with trapezoidal openings, mirrors the surrounding landscape, which is dominated by fragmented monzogranite boulders. Building colors also reflect the surroundings with an orange gazebo found on some boulders and flowers. A drab olive from shrubs and cacti and blue colors mimic distant ridgelines and the sky.\nNotes and references\nSide from hillside above dwelling.\n*Modern American Houses by Clifford A.
