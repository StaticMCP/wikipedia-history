The clash arose from territorial disputes and a struggle for influence in the Nazran region.\n| place             = Nazran region, North Caucasus, Ingushetia\n| result            = Ingush Victory\n| territory         = Mountain Ingush began to descend to Nazran, The raids on Nazran were stopped.\n| combatant1        =  Kabardian Principality\n| combatant2        =  Nazranian Ingush\n| commander1        =  Albast Elzheruko\n| commander2        =\n| strength1         = unknown\n| strength2         = 100 + horsemen\n| casualties1       = unknown\n| casualties2       = unknown\n}}\nThe Nazran region had been uninhabited since around 1730, when the Kabardians left it.\nBefore the resettlement of the Kartskhal to new lands nearby, Kabardians had lived in small settlements.\nBattle\nTwo Kabardian princes, Albast and Elzharko, were unwilling to release the Ingush settlers from rent and organized an attack on the village of Kartskhal to seize livestock and agricultural produce. the episodes of this conflict ended with the Ingush, led by Kartskhal, calling upon more than 100 armed horsemen from nearby mountain villages, achieving a brilliant victory over the princely forces and thereby defending their right to their land\nAttacks by Kabardians, Chechens, Nogais, and Kumyks were frequent in these areas, plundering the settlers, taking livestock and produce. For defense, Kartskhal built a tall wooden two-story tower on four pillars, which could hold more than a hundred people. A guard was always stationed in the tower. The settlement was surrounded by a trench, with only one gate and a secret entrance to the trench. Secret trenches were dug 50 steps away from the trench and along the banks of the Nazranka and Sunzha rivers.\nWhen the Chechens, having learned that Kartskhal had taken possession of a place which they considered to be in dispute between them and the Kabardians, went to war against him and, having lost this battle, fled; the Ingush set out in pursuit of them with naked sabers in their hands, as a result of which the Chechens were driven back by the Ingush as far as the Nitty-khoy-khi River.\nReferences"
