Bhamidipati became a trendsetter in the field of humor playwriting.\nBhamidipati not only translated some English farces into Telugu but also wrote original prahasanas (farces) in Telugu. His prahasanas are considered to be the best of type even today.\nEarly life\nBhamidipati's father Narsavadhanulu was a Vedic scholar, but Bhamidipati developed a love for literature at a young age. In that era, many theatre organizations competed for awards in Parishat competitions in verse drama. Bhamidipati, belonging to a poor family was one of the Parishat's beneficiaries. That helped him to get through his graduation. \"Drama stood by me and hence I shall do something for drama\" was his motto and he began writing plays, especially for students.\nThough he joined the government service, economic and family conditions forced him to work as a teacher at Rajahmundry. Bhamidipati did his M.A in Mathematics and retired as headmaster of Veeresalingam High School, Rajahmundry.\nHe was in the company of great scholars, including legendary literary figures like Madhunapantula Satyanarayana, Chilakamarthi Lakshmi Narasimham, Sripada Krishnamurthy Sastry and Kasi Krishnamacharyulu. But the influence of Raghupathi Venkataratnam Naidu was more. Yet, Bhamidipati was a great fan of English plays and literature. His professor Cooldre's observation that ‘poetry and music were not different’ made Bhamidipati sit and think. He began researching various works that resulted in his writing of Andhra Padyanataka Pathanam.\nWorks\n*Bhamidipati Kameswararao Rachanalu-Vol.1 (Subject: HUMOUR - SATIRE, Year of Publication: 2008)\n*Bhamidipati Kameswararao Rachanalu-2 (Subject: ESSAYS - ANTHOLOGY, Year of Publication: 2010)\n*Bhamidipati Kameswara Rao Rachanalu-4 (Subject: PLAYS, Year of Publication: 2011)\n*Prahasanaalu( Subject: PLAYS, Year of Publication: 2012)\n*Thyagaraja Atmavicaram,1949\n*Bataa khani\nBook on Bhamidipati\nSahitya Akedemi commissioned Tallavajhula Patanjali Sastry(who is a noted short story writer and is also known for his works on tribal life and culture, theatre, cinema, and music.) to write a book on Bhamidipati Kameswara Rao and the book was published recently.\n[http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/powerful-playwright/article3841887.ece Powerful playwright – The Hindu]\nIn the book, author Patanjali Sastry gives a detailed picture of the life of Bhamidipati from 1897, his birth year, till he died in 1958.\nAuthor Patanjali Sastry says that apparently, Bhamidipati told his son Radhakrishna, who later became a film scriptwriter; that he committed a mistake in adapting Moliere in his works and asked his son never to follow other's works if he wanted to leave his impression on his work.\n\"Though he wrote comedies, he remained an introvert and never smiled even when someone cracked a joke,\" informs Patanjali Sastry.\nBhamidipati was greatly influenced by Gurajada Appa Rao’s works, especially for its modernity and use of spoken regional dialect.\nViswanatha Satyanarayana had declared that Bhamidipati was the first and greatest humor playwright ever.\nJayapur Maharaja accorded him the title of ‘Hasya Brahma’.\nAuthor Patanjali Sastry reveals how Bhamidipati never allowed his subject to be made as a film.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
