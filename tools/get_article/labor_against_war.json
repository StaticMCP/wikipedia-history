      "text": "# Labor Against War\n\nLabor Against War is the name of a political group within the Australian Labor Party.\nIt was started in 2023 as a grassroots movement organised against the AUKUS security pact. It describes itself as a \"grassroots network of labor members and unionists opposed to Australia being dragged into another US-led war\".\nThe convenor of the group is Marcus Strom, a unionist and former media advisor to Ed Husic.\nThe group has attempted to organise branches of the Labor Party in passing resolutions condemning AUKUS and the proposed nuclear submarine program. It has been associated with party-conference motions that have opposed the alliance.\nReferences"
