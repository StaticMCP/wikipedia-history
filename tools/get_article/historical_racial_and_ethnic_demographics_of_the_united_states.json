In addition, tax lists and other reports provided additional data and information about the racial demographics of the Thirteen Colonies during this time period.\nPeople have been enumerated by race in every United States census since the first one in 1790. Collection of data on race and ethnicity in the United States census has changed over time, including addition of new enumeration categories and changes in definitions of those categories.\nHistorical trends\nHistorical estimates of the pre-Columbian 1492 population of what is now the United States vary dramatically, ranging from only 900,000 to upwards of 18 million, with the majority of estimates falling between 2 million and 5 million. However, it is universally agreed upon by historians that the Indigenous population underwent a large decline following European contact, primarily due to Old World diseases to which natives lacked immunity, as well as violent conflict and genocide committed by European settlers. By 1800, the Native American population within the modern-day borders of the United States had declined to around 600,000, compared to a combined white and black population of over 5 million at the time. The Native American population continued to decline steadily over the course of the 19th century, reaching a low of around 250,000 between 1890 and 1900.\nThe transatlantic slave trade had its roots prior to the discovery of the Americas. By 1471, Portuguese navigators hoping to tap the fabled Saharan gold trade had reconnoitered the West African coast as far as the Niger Delta, and traded European commodities for local crafts as well as slaves, the latter which turned out to be highly lucrative. By 1490, more than 3,000 slaves a year were transported to Portugal and Spain from Africa. Following the Spanish discovery of the New World in 1492, Spanish and Portuguese sailors began transporting enslaved Africans to their new colonies in the Caribbean, marking the start of the transatlantic slave trade. The first permanent British settlement in what would become the United States was established at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. The first African slaves were imported to the colony of Jamestown around the year 1620, marking the beginning of the slave trade in what would become the United States. In the period between 1620 and 1866, around 388,000 slaves in total were shipped to British colonies in Northern America. African Americans (Blacks) made up almost one-fifth of the United States population in 1790, but following the US abolition of the slave trade in 1808, their percentage of the total U.S. population declined in almost every census until 1930, when they reached a low point of just under 10% of the population. From at least 1790 until the start of World War I, the overwhelming majority (around ninety percent) of African Americans lived in the Southern United States. In addition, before 1865, the overwhelming majority of African Americans were slaves. The Great Migration throughout the 20th century (starting from World War I) resulted in more than six million African Americans leaving the Southern U.S. (especially rural areas) and moving to other parts of the United States (especially to urban areas) due to the greater economic/job opportunities, less anti-black violence/lynchings, and a smaller amount of segregation/discrimination there. Due to the Great Migration, many large cities outside of the former Confederacy (such as New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, and Cleveland) experienced huge increases in the African American percentage of their total population.\nWhites (including Non-Hispanic Whites) have historically made up the overwhelming majority (usually between eighty and ninety percent) of the total United States population, with African-Americans making up the overwhelming majority of the non-white population for most of the nation's history. The United States historically had few Hispanics and Asians, especially before the late 20th century. Most Asian Americans historically lived in the Western United States. The Hispanic and Asian populations of the United States have rapidly increased in the late 20th and 21st centuries, following the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which repealed racially motivated national origin quotas that had severely limited immigration from countries outside of Northwestern Europe. The rise of Asian and Hispanic populations, and declining immigration from Europe in the late 20th century, has seen a commensurate decline in the share of non-Hispanic Whites in the country, from over 83% of the population in 1970 to around 58% in 2020. The Native American population has seen a significant rise since 1970, the first census year where respondents could self-identify their own race instead of having it assigned by an enumerator, as individuals of partial Native American descent who were previously classified by enumerators as white or black began to self-identify as Native American. The Native American population rose from around 600,000 in 1970, to over 3 million in 2020, further buoyed by immigration from Indigenous Mexican and other Indigenous Latin American communities, with around a third of the Native American population in 2020 identifying as Hispanic. The African American percentage of the U.S. population slowly increased between 1940 and 1990, after reaching a low point of less than 10% in 1930. However, since 1990, the share of African American population has held mostly steady at around 12% of the population, seeing a slight decline in the 2020 census.\nHistorical data for all races and for Hispanic origin (1610–2020)\nThe United States census enumerated Whites and Blacks since 1790, Asians and Native Americans since 1860 (though all Native Americans in the U.S. were not enumerated until 1890), \"some other race\" since 1950, and \"two or more races\" since 2000. The category of Pacific Islanders (including Native Hawaiians) was enumerated separately from Asians for the first time in 2000. Mexicans were automatically counted as White in every census from 1790 to 1960, except for 1930, unless individually deemed by enumerators as being \"definitely Indian or of other non-white races.\" Hispanics of all races (as well as the Non-Hispanic White population) have been enumerated as an ethnic category since 1970. Some earlier estimates of the Hispanic population exist, with the population of White Hispanics estimated by the Census Bureau based on the \"white population of Spanish mother tongue\" in the 1940 census. Limited estimates for the Hispanic (and Non-Hispanic White) population were also made for certain years before 1940 (as well as for 1950 and 1960).\nThe Census Bureau has announced that for the upcoming 2030 Census, the 'race' and 'ethnicity' categories will be combined into one question, meaning that Hispanics will be classified in the same way as the already recognized racial categories, rather than as a separate ethnic classification as they were from 1970-2020. Additionally, the Census Bureau has also announced the introduction of a new \"Middle Eastern or North African\" racial category for the 2030 census. Middle Eastern Americans were historically counted as White on every census from 1950-2020.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Racial and Ethnic Demographics of the Thirteen Colonies (Total Numbers) Between 1610 and 1750\n|-\n!Race/Ethnic Group||1610||1620||1630||1640||1650||1660||1670||1680||1690||1700||1710||1720||1730||1740||1750\n|-\n!Total Population\n!350\n!2,302\n!4,646\n!26,634\n!50,368\n!75,058\n!111,935\n!151,507\n!210,372\n!250,888\n!331,711\n!466,185\n!629,445\n!905,563\n!1,170,760\n|-\n!White\n!350\n!2,282\n!4,586\n!26,037\n!48,768\n!72,138\n!107,400\n!144,536\n!193,643\n!223,071\n!286,845\n!397,346\n!538,424\n!755,539\n!934,340\n|-\n!White (%)\n!100.0%\n!99.1%\n!98.7%\n!97.8%\n!96.8%\n!96.1%\n!95.9%\n!95.4%\n!91.9%\n!88.9%\n!86.4%\n!85.2%\n!85.5%\n!83.4%\n!79.8%\n|-\n!Black (also called Negro)\n!0\n!20\n!60\n!597\n!1,600\n!2,920\n!4,535\n!6,971\n!16,729\n!27,817\n!44,866\n!68,839\n!91,021\n!150,024\n!236,420\n|-\n!Black/Negro (%)\n!0.0%\n!0.9%\n!1.3%\n!2.2%\n!3.2%\n!3.9%\n!4.1%\n!4.6%\n!8.1%\n!11.1%\n!13.6%\n!14.8%\n!14.5%\n!16.6%\n!20.2%\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Racial and Ethnic Demographics of the Thirteen Colonies and the United States (Total Numbers) Between 1760 and 1840\n|-\n!Race/Ethnic Group||1760||1770||1780||1790||1800||1810||1820||1830||1840\n|-\n!Total Population\n!1,593,625\n!2,148,076\n!2,780,369\n!3,929,214\n!5,308,483\n!7,239,881\n!9,638,453\n!12,860,702\n!17,063,353\n|-\n!White\n!1,267,819\n!1,688,254\n!2,204,949\n!3,172,006\n!4,306,446\n!5,862,073\n!7,866,797\n!10,532,060\n!14,189,705\n|-\n!White %\n|79.6\n|78.6\n|79.3\n|80.7\n|81.1\n|81.0\n|81.6\n|81.9\n|83.2\n|-\n!Black (also called Negro)\n!325,806\n!459,822\n!575,420\n!757,208\n!1,002,037\n!1,377,808\n!1,771,656\n!2,328,642\n!2,873,648\n|-\n!Black/Negro %\n|20.4\n|21.4\n|20.7\n|19.3\n|18.9\n|19.0\n|18.4\n|18.1\n|16.8\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Racial and Ethnic Demographics of the United States (Total Numbers) Between 1850 and 1920\n!Race/Ethnic Group||1850||1860||1870||1880||1890||1900||1910||1920\n|-\n!Total Population\n!23,191,876\n!31,443,321\n!38,558,371\n!50,155,783\n!62,947,714\n!75,994,575\n!91,972,266\n!105,710,620\n|-\n!White\n!19,553,068\n!26,922,537\n!33,589,377\n!43,402,970\n!55,101,258\n!66,809,196\n!81,731,957\n!94,820,915\n|-\n!Black\n!3,638,808\n!4,441,830\n!4,880,009\n!6,580,793\n!7,488,676\n!8,833,994\n!9,827,763\n!10,463,131\n|-\n!American Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut\n!\n!44,021\n!25,731\n!66,407\n!248,253\n!237,196\n!265,683\n!244,437\n|-\n!Asian and Pacific Islander\n!\n!34,933\n!63,254\n!105,613\n!109,527\n!114,189\n!146,863\n!182,137\n|-\n!Hispanic (of any race)\n!116,943\n!155,000\n!\n!393,555\n!\n!503,189\n!797,994\n!1,286,154\n|-\n!Non-Hispanic White\n!19,438,451\n!\n!\n!43,065,679\n!\n!66,374,317\n!81,043,248\n!93,604,612\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Racial and Ethnic Demographics of the United States (Total Numbers) Between 1930 and 2020\n!Race/Ethnic Group||1930||1940||1950||1960||1970||1980||1990||2000||2010||2020\n|-\n!Total Population\n!122,775,046\n!131,669,275\n!150,697,361\n!179,323,175\n!203,210,158\n!226,545,805\n!248,709,873\n!281,421,906\n!308,745,538\n!331,449,281\n|-\n!White\n!110,286,740\n!118,214,870\n!134,942,028\n!158,831,732\n!178,119,221\n!188,371,622\n!199,686,070\n!211,460,626\n!223,553,265\n!204,277,273\n|-\n!Black\n!11,891,143\n!12,865,518\n!15,042,286\n!18,871,831\n!22,539,362\n!26,495,025\n!29,986,060\n!34,658,190\n!38,929,319\n!41,104,200\n|-\n!American Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut\n!332,397\n!333,969\n!343,410\n!551,669\n!795,110\n!1,420,400\n!1,959,234\n!2,475,956\n!2,932,248\n!3,727,135\n|-\n!Asian and Pacific Islander\n!264,766\n!254,918\n!321,033\n!980,337\n!1,526,401\n!3,500,439\n!7,273,662\n!10,641,833\n!15,214,265\n!20,576,015\n|-\n!Some other race\n!\n!\n!48,604\n!87,606\n!230,064\n!6,758,319\n!9,804,847\n!15,359,073\n!19,107,368\n!27,915,715\n|-\n!Two or more races\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!6,826,228\n!9,009,073\n!33,848,943\n|-\n!Hispanic (of any race)\n!\n!2,021,820\n!3,231,409\n!5,814,784\n!8,920,940\n!14,608,673\n!22,354,059\n!35,305,818\n!50,477,594\n!62,080,044\n|-\n!Non-Hispanic White\n!\n!116,261,189\n!131,805,405\n!153,217,498\n!169,622,593\n!180,256,366\n!188,128,296\n!194,552,774\n!196,817,552\n!191,697,647\n|-\n!Non-Hispanic  Black\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!22,084,428\n!26,401,173\n!29,216,293\n!33,947,837\n!37,685,848\n!39,940,338\n|-\n!Non-Hispanic  Native\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!768,251\n!1,325,655\n!1,793,773\n!

The combined taxed and non-taxed Native American population in the United States was 339,421 in 1860, 313,712 in 1870, and 306,543 in 1880.\nc Data on race from the 2000 and 2010 U.S. censuses are not directly comparable with those from the 1990 census and previous censuses due, in large part, to giving respondents the option to report more than one race.

had African Americans compose 35% or more of their total population(s), with three of them (Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina) even having an African American majority at certain periods in their history. In contrast, the African American percentage of the total population in other parts of the U.S. (outside of the South) was historically almost always in the single digits (0.0% to 9.9%). Even after the Great Migration, no or almost no U.S. state outside of the Southern U.S. has ever had an African American percentage of its total population be greater than 16%. The Black proportion has declined since the 1990s due to gentrification and expanding opportunities, with many Blacks moving to Texas, Georgia, Florida, and Maryland and others migrating to jobs in states of the New South in a reverse of the Great Migration.\nFile:Black_Americans_1790_County.png|1790\nFile:Black_Americans_1800_County.png|1800\nFile:Black_American_1810_County.png|1810\nFile:Black_Americans_1820_County.png|1820\nFile:Black_Americans_1830_County.png|1830\nFile:Black_Americans_1840_County.png|1840\nFile:Black_Americans_1850_County.png|1850\nFile:Black_Americans_1860_County.png|1860\nFile:Black_Americans_1870_County.png|1870\n{|class=\"wikitable

However, some U.S. states had previously emancipated some or all of their Black population. The table below shows the percentage of free Blacks as a percentage of the total Black population in various U.S. regions and U.S. states between 1790 and 1860 (the blank areas on the chart below mean

become a minority (that is, less than half of the total U.S. population) during the 2040s, resulting in a plurality. In December 2012, the U.S. Census Bureau projected that 2043 would be the year in which the U.S. would become a majority minority nation, with no single ethnic classification constituting a majority of the population.  By 2060, Hispanic Americans are projected to account for about one-third of the total U.S. population.

refer to mothers of that race, not the children. Most non-white babies of non-Hispanic white mothers are either Hispanic or black, and non-Hispanic black mothers occasionally have Hispanic children. On the other hand, all children born to Hispanic mothers, even if the mothers are white Hispanic, are counted as Hispanic.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n! style=\"width:80pt;\"|Average population (x
