Justices Mohammad Anwarul Haque, Mirza Hussain Haider, Nazrul Islam Chowdhury, Sheikh Rezowan Ali, and Syed Mohammad Dastagir Husain of the nine were confirmed as permanent judges of the High Court Division.\nIn 2009, Anwar and Justice Kamrul Islam Siddiqui refused to hear a petition related to cantonment residence of former prime minister Khaleda Zia as they had handled documents related to the property. In February 2011, Anwar and Justice Syed Abu Kowser Md Dabirush-shan gave a split verdict on a petition challenging the legality of the 1974 agreement regarding prisoner of war from the Bangladesh Liberation War signed by Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. Haque dismissed the petition while Syed Abu Kowser Md Dabirush-shan sought an explanation from the government on why the treaty should not be declared illegal.\nAnwar died on 25 May 2024 in Square Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh.\nReferences"
