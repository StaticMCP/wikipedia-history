After Dan's adoptive mother died, his birth mother married his adoptive father, David Stewart, and mother and son were reunited.\nDan was married to heroines Liz Talbot and Kim Reynolds, as well as the more villainous Susan Burke. A love quadrangle with Dan, Susan, Liz and Dan's brother Paul was a cornerstone of the show's storylines for many years.\nThe character of Dan died of a brain tumor. Dan's daughters, Emily Stewart and Betsy Stewart, figured prominently into subsequent stories on As the World Turns.\nReferences\nExternal links"
