It has been given annually since 2006, with the latest&mdash;the 10th edition&mdash;of the award-giving ceremony having been held in May 2018. The awards are decided by a jury, consisting of noted film-makers, critics and technicians, while winners in a separate category named \"Favourite awards\" are chosen by public voting. The awards have been sponsored by Reliance Mobile, Univercell and Close Up. After the last ceremony was the 10th Vijay Awards in 2018, the Vijay Awards were cancelled due to past controversies and waning public interest.\nHistory\nThe first edition of the awards was held to select the most popular artists, however not for any particular work or year. In the first year of the awards, viewers were asked to choose their all time favourite film and artists in nine categories - Favourite Hero, Heroine, Film, Director, Music Director, Playback Singer Male/Female, Villain and Comedian - while 10 Jury Special Awards were also introduced. The format was completely reworked for the following year and from 2008 onwards, the works of the preceding year were honoured, with the majority of prizes being selected by a committee, while awards in five categories (Favourite Hero, Heroine, Film, Director and Song) chosen by public voting. The award for Favourite Song was introduced in 2008.\nAwards\nJury Awards\n* Best Film\n* Best Director\n* Best Actor\n* Best Actress\n* Best Supporting Actor\n* Best Supporting Actress\n* Best Comedian\n* Best Villain\n* Best Debut Actor\n* Best Debut Actress\n* Best Music Director\n* Best Cinematographer\n* Best Editor\n* Best Art Director\n* Best Male Playback Singer\n* Best Female Playback Singer\n* Best Lyricist\n* Best Dialogue Writer\n* Best Story, Screenplay Writer\n* Best Choreographer\n* Best Stunt Director\n* Best Make Up\n* Best Costume Designer\n* Best Find of the Year\n* Best Crew\n* Contribution to Tamil Cinema\n* Vijay Award for Entertainer of the Year\n* Chevalier Sivaji Ganesan Award for Excellence in Indian Cinema\n* Vijay Special Jury Award\nFavourite awards\n* Favourite Hero\n* Favourite Heroine\n* Favourite Film\n* Favourite Director\n* Favourite Song\n* Favourite Music Director (2006 only)\n** A R Rahman\n* Favourite Villain (2006 only)\n** Prakash Raj\n* Favourite Comedian (2006 only)\n** Vivek\n* Favourite Playback Singer (Male) (2006 only)\n** S.
