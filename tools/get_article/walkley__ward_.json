It lies north-east of Crookes and south of Hillsborough.\nNetherthorpe\nNetherthorpe () is a council estate lying south-east of the Ponderosa open space.  Originally an area of working-class Victorian terraces, it was reconstructed in the 1960s as an area of tower blocks and medium-rise flats with a few houses.  In the late 1990s the tower blocks were reclad and many of the other flats demolished and replaced by modern housing.\nUpperthorpe\nUpperthorpe () lies north-west of the Ponderosa open space and south east of Walkley. Building in the area began in the late Georgian period, from which the former infirmary (now offices) and a few houses survive. Construction continued, with many large Victorian houses and a car-free late-20th-century housing estate surviving. The Kelvin Flats were a landmark in the area, of similar design to now listed Park Hill, but were demolished in the early 1990s. The area is served by the Infirmary Road Sheffield Supertram stop.\nSee also\n* Sheffield City Council\n* Sheffield City Council elections\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.stthomaschurch.org.uk St Thomas' Church, Philadelphia, Sheffield]"
