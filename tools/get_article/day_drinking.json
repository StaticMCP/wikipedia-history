It was released in June 2014 as the lead single from their sixth studio album, Pain Killer. Little Big Town debuted the song on the CMT Music Awards on June 4, 2014.\nContent\n\"Day Drinking\" is a mid-tempo song about not wanting to wait until later or needing a reason to have some drinks, so the song's narrator suggests they do a little \"day drinking.\" The song was written by three members of the band (Karen Fairchild, Phillip Sweet, and Jimi Westbrook) with Barry Dean and Troy Verges. Of the song's inception, Fairchild said: \"We didn't know it really, but with 'Day Drinking,' we had a blast that day because we were drinking and writing songs. We left it alone, then a couple of weeks later, Barry Dean and Troy Verges sent us a souped up work tape of what we had done. Then, we thought this is very fun and very cool.\"\nComposition\nThe song is set in the key of E Mixolydian.\nCritical reception\nMatt Bjorke of Roughstock complimented the song's production, saying that it \"benefit[s] from Joyce's strong guitar solo and percussive production tendencies which only enhance the summery good time vibes of the lyrics of 'Day Drinking.'\" Bob Paxman of Country Weekly highlighted the song's \"first-rate production\" and vocals. He awarded the song a B+ rating, saying that while \"[it] will hardly be remembered for its depth, but like a vacation cruise, it’s the perfect summer getaway.\"\nMusic video\nThe music video for \"Day Drinking\" made its premiere on June 25, 2014, courtesy of People.com. It opens with the band members stuck in a traffic jam, before they get out of their vehicle, a red Cadillac convertible, and proceed to walk down the highway. Others follow suit and they all end up at a beach where fun festivities commence while alcohol beverages are consumed. Scenes for the video were shot in the Miami Beach, Florida area.\nChart performance\n\"Day Drinking\" debuted at number 32 on the U.S. Billboard Country Airplay chart and at number 22 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart for the week of June 21, 2014. It also debuted at number 87 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart.
