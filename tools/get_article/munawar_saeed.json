He migrated to Pakistan in 1960 after doing his B.Sc from the Aligarh Muslim University. He is a relative of the poets Rais Amrohvi and Jaun Elia.\nCareer\nAfter settling in Karachi, Pakistan, he started working on stage and Radio Pakistan. In 1967, when a television station was established in Karachi, he started working in TV dramas. In 1969, he was offered an Urdu film Ghar Damaad from Lollywood.
