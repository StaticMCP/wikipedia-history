In the , the locality of Banana had a population of 348 people.\nGeography\nBanana is located at the intersection of the Dawson and Leichhardt highways,  west of the shire's administrative centre, Biloela.\nHistory\nGangalu (Gangulu, Kangulu, Kanolu, Kaangooloo, Khangulu) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Gangula country. The Gangula language region includes the towns of Clermont and Springsure extending south towards the Dawson River.\nIn 1853, James, Norman and Charles Leith-Hay established the Rannes pastoral lease and Banana was an outstation of this property. Banana became its own squatting leasehold sheep station property in 1855 with the Leith-Hays and Thomas Holt holding the licence. In 1855 a group of Aboriginal people attacked Banana Station wounding five people and stealing 3,000 sheep. In April 1858, a number of Aboriginal people in an unprovoked attack, murdered 4 men at Camboon and had stolen a carbine, gun powder and balls, and some axes. They then proceeded to attack the sheep station at Banana resulting in three shepherds being wounded. While the shepherds were defending themselves, an Aboriginal man was killed. Native Police troopers were deployed to patrol the area and a 1859 map shows a police station marked on the planned site for Banana.\nThe name Banana derives from an old dun-coloured working bullock, called Banana, used by local stockmen to help them when herding some of the wilder cattle into the yards.\nThe post office at Banana was established on 1 September 1861, and the first township allotments were offered for sale in that same year.\nIn 1887, there was a minor gold rush at Banana, increasing the population by a few hundred people.\nBanana Provisional School opened on 18 September 1871 and was upgraded to Banana State School on 16 February 1874. The school closed in 1935, but reopened on 25 January 1960.\nIn 1880, the local government area Banana Division (later the Shire of Banana) was established with its headquarters in Banana (taking its name from the town). However, in 1930 the shire headquarters became Rannes and the shire offices were physically relocated from Banana to Rannes. Since 1946, the shire has its headquarters in Biloela.\nThe mobile library service commenced in 2004.\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Banana had a population of 627 people.\nIn the , the locality of Banana had a population of 377 people.\nIn the , the locality of Banana had a population of 356 people.\nIn the , the locality of Banana had a population of 348 people.\nEconomy\nThe beef industry is still a mainstay of the town and area, along with coal and agriculture.\nEducation\nBanana State School is a government primary (P-6) school for boys and girls at 32-36 Bramston Street (). In 2012, there were 37 students enrolled with 3 teachers (2.5 full-time equivalent).\nThere are no secondary schools in Banana; the nearest government secondary schools are Moura State High School in neighbouring Moura to the west and Biloela State High School in Biloela to the east.\nAmenities\nBanana has a Uniting Church at 39 Bowen Street (Leichhardt Highway) at the corner with North Street ().\nBanana Shire Council operate  a fortnightly mobile library service to Banana and the school.\nThe Banana branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association meets at 123 Bramston Street.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://onesearch.slq.qld.gov.au/permalink/61SLQ_INST/dls06p/alma996907694702061 Annual reports Banana Hospitals Board], State Library of Queensland"
