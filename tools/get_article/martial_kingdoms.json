The plot is based on wuxia novels and set in the wulin (martial artists' community) of 16th-century China. It has a sequel, Martial Kingdoms 2, which was released in 2007.\nGameplay\nThe player chooses one from 13 martial arts organisations to play as, and must conquer the others to rule the wulin (martial artists' community) and win the game. At the start of the game, each organisation controls at least one base out of 20, all located on a map of China. An organisation is conquered when it loses all its bases or when its leader is killed.\nThere are different ways for an organisation to increase its strength and power:\n* Recruiting and training new members\n* Taking control of unoccupied bases or conquering bases controlled by other organisations, so as to acquire more resources such as gold, wood and iron ore.\n* Upgrading its factories to produce weapons, equipment and medicine of better quality\n* Discovering and learning more powerful skills through studying and gaining experience from battles\n* Forming alliances with other organisations\n* Attracting special characters (seven in total) to join the organisation\nThe player can manage members and arrange their daily schedules to determine how much time each member spends on a certain task (e.g. collecting resources, making items, training) and what skill the member will be learning.\nPlot\nThe game is set in 16th-century China during the reign of the Jiajing Emperor of the Ming dynasty. Deceived by the corrupt chancellor Yan Song, the emperor fears that the martial artists' community will pose a threat to him. He sends the secret police to stir up conflict among the various organisations in the hope that they will destroy each other.\nThere are four storylines that the player can choose from. In each storyline, the number of bases occupied by each organisation at the beginning is different and some organisations appear only in certain storylines.
