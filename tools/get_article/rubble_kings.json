A great movement towards peace, about really courageous people overcoming seemingly impossible odds and rising to love. Although I didn't grow up in that situation, I can understand that idea, and I think it's important that we all reach outside our own realms of experience and try to understand what people are going through and the things they have to overcome. It was really something I wanted to get involved with and support in any way I can.\nReception\nOn the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a 73% rating based on 15 reviews. Metacritic gave the film a 62 out of 100 based on 11 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\nDaniel M. Gold of The New York Times described the film as \"a fascinating, valuable work of social, music and New York history, a celebration of a peaceful revolution by those who helped birth it.\"\nRonnie Scheib of Variety wrote: \"Cramming a lot of anecdotes, urban lore and frenzied movement into a mere 71 minutes, Nicholson's  imperceptibly builds to an unexpected, revelatory climax.\"\nSoundtrack\n}}\nWith a mix of rap and instrumental compositions, Little Shalimar (Torbitt Schwartz)'s music captures the essence of the varied sounds emerging from the Bronx during the 1970s.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
