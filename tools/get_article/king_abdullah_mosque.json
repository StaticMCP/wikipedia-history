It was opened in 2003 and covers an area of . The mosque is named after King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz and its construction was primarily funded by Prince Al Waleed bin Talal.\nOverview\nIn 2003, Spazio restaurant was established with assistance from Prince Al Waleed bin Talal on the 77th floor of the Kingdom Centre.\nAs the number of customers to the restaurant grew, the absence of a place of worship led the administration to build a mosque. In October 2003, Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdulaziz established the Prince Abdullah Mosque as an annex to the restaurant.  The construction of the mosque was funded by Prince Al Waleed bin Talal. Following the enthronement of Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdulaziz as the new monarch in 2005, the mosque was renamed to King Abdullah Mosque.\nIn 2010, following the inauguration of Burj Khalifa in Dubai, the BBC and other media outlets reported the presence of a mosque on either the 158th or 154th floor of the Burj Khalifa skyscraper, reportedly making that supposed mosque the world's most elevated mosque at  above ground level. However, the claim of a mosque in the Burj Khalifa skyscraper was met with rebuttal from Emaar Properties, leaving the King Abdullah Mosque to retain its title.\nSee also\n}}\n* Islam in Saudi Arabia\n* List of mosques in Saudi Arabia\n* List of things named after Saudi kings\nReferences"
