When he returned, he set up a workshop in Zaltbommel, where he taught the painter Gerard Hoet. Houbraken, who received his information from Hoet himself, claimed he had been Hoet's teacher in Zaltbommel for a year before he moved to smaller quarters where he could no longer receive pupils at his home. In his biography of Van Poelenburch, Houbraken claimed that after teaching Hoet, he became a jeweller who travelled to Spain, where he later died.
