While every World Cup had a ranking of the run scorers, the first time an award was given was in 1975. If there is more than one player with the same number of runs both of them are awarded with the Golden Bat. India is the only country whose players have won the Golden Bat a record 5 times (Sachin Tendulkar in 1996 & 2003, Rahul Dravid in 1999, Rohit Sharma in 2019 and Virat Kohli in 2023).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Top runscorer\n|-\n!|World Cup\n!scope=col style=\"background-color: gold\" |Winner\n!|Runs\n|-\n|1975|| Glenn Turner||333\n|-\n|1979|| Gordon Greenidge||253\n|-\n|1983|| David Gower||384\n|-\n|1987|| Graham Gooch||471\n|-\n|1992|| Martin Crowe||456\n|-\n|1996|| Sachin Tendulkar||523\n|-\n|1999|| Rahul Dravid||461\n|-\n|2003|| Sachin Tendulkar||673\n|-\n|2007|| Matthew Hayden||659\n|-\n|2011|| Tillakaratne Dilshan||500\n|-\n|2015|| Martin Guptill||547\n|-\n|2019|| Rohit Sharma||648\n|-\n|2023||  Virat Kohli||765\n|-\n|2027|| ||\n|-\n|2031|| ||\n|-\n|}\nGolden Ball\nThe Golden Ball Award goes to the top wicket taker of the ICC World Cup.
