Brown supported the album with a North American tour.\nThe album was nominated for a Grammy Award, in the \"Best Traditional Blues Album\" category.\nProduction\nThe album was produced by Jim Bateman and Brown. Brown included four instrumental tracks and played fiddle as well as guitar. Michelle Shocked duetted with Brown on \"I Will Be Your Friend\". \"Better Off With the Blues\" is a cover of the Delbert McClinton song; \"C-Jam Blues\" is a version of the Duke Ellington composition. \"Alligator Eating Dog\" is a novelty song that includes sound effects.\nCritical reception\n|rev3 = The Encyclopedia of Popular Music\n|rev3score =\n|rev4 = Los Angeles Daily News\n|rev4score =\n|rev5 = The Republican\n|rev5score =\n}}\nThe Chicago Tribune wrote: \"Lively Texas jump blues (fleshed out by a hot big-band-styled horn section and Brown's delightfully idiosyncratic guitar and violin work) is at the heart of the album, but the always eclectic Brown mixes it up with some sweet slow blues, a bit of funk, even a country ballad.\" The Telegram & Gazette stated that the album \"features fleet-fingered jazzy blues solos and pungent country-flavored riffs over a swinging horn section.\"\nGuitar Player called Brown \"a master arranger [who] writes horn parts that add texture, melody, and excitement.\" The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette determined that Brown's \"eclectic music is firmly planted in Texas swing blues, but still manages some magical meandering.\"\nAllMusic wrote that \"Brown's vocals, which feature consistently intelligent lyrics ... are part of the music rather than the entire show; he even gives his obscure backup horns chances to solo.\"\nTrack listing\nReferences"
