The archives are primarily serving municipalities of Leskovac, Vlasotince, Crna Trava, Lebane, Bojnik, and Medveđa. The archives were established in 1954 and their current name was introduced in 1959. Since 1973, the archives are located in the building of the old medical centre. In 2024, the institution got involved in court case in which one employee raised complaint for workplace mobbing against the director.\nSee also\n* List of archives in Serbia\n* State Archives of Serbia\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.istorijskiarhivleskovac.co.rs/ Official website]"
