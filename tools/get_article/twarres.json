Their songs are primarily lush, harmonic vocal pop with a focus on acoustic instrumentation such as pianos and violins. Their debut single \"Wêr bisto\" won the audience's award at the 1999 Frisian Song Contest. The band has one platinum certified album and single respectively.\nBand history\nMirjam Timmer and Johan van der Veen performed in a talent show under the name Twarres. This led to the duo's success, and in 2000 they scored a hit in the Netherlands and Flanders with the song \"Wêr Bisto\" recorded in their native West Frisian. They followed this success with the singles \"She Couldn't Laugh\", \"Children,\" and \"I Need To Know.\" Their debut album, Stream, went platinum.\nAt the end of 2003 Twarres held their last concert. In August 2006 Twarres announced that a reunion would take place, most probably during 2007 or early 2008. A comeback album by Twarres was scheduled for the early spring of 2008. On 15 August 2007, it was announced that for health reasons Johan van der Veen would leave the band. He was replaced by Auke Busman who also left later. In August/September 2009 Dutch radio station Q-music organised a talent competition to look for \"the new Johan\". The jury was formed by Mirjam, Johan and some others. On 11 September 2009, the competition was won by Joost Bloemendal.\nIn 2006, Mirjam Timmer, singer and guitarist of Twarres, also started a solo career under the name \"Mir\". Her solo album entitled Files from London was released in 2006.\nAs of 2017, Twarres was a trio comprising Timmer and brothers Julian and Kristian Dijkstra. The 2016 single \"Fûgelfrij\" was recorded by these band members. In 2017, it was announced though that Julian Dijkstra would leave the band.\nBand members\n*Mirjam Timmer (born July 1, 1982) – vocals and guitar\n*Kristian Dijkstra (born April 26, 1988) – vocals\nOther band members\n*Gregor Hamilton – keyboard\n*Peter Krako – guitar\n*Serge Bredewold – bass\n*Sietse Huisman – drums\n*Yfke de Jong – violin\nDiscography\nAlbums\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10.5em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:15.5em;\"| Details\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\"| Peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"|Certifications\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| NL\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| BE (FL)\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| BE (WA)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Wêr Bisto\n|\n* Released: 1999\n* Format: Demo CD\n| — || — || — ||\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Stream\n|\n* Released: 2001\n* Format: Studio album\n| 1 || 1 || 8 || NL: Platinum\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| CD2\n|\n* Released: 2002\n* Format: Studio album\n| 29 || 10 || 25 ||\n|-\n| colspan=\"17\" style=\"font-size:85%\"| \"—\" denotes an album that did not chart or was not released in that territory.\n|}\nSingles\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"|Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"|Year\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\"|Peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"|Certifications\n|-\n| scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\" | NL 40\n| scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\" | NL 100\n| scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\" | BE (FL)\n| scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\" | BE (WA)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"Wêr Bisto\"\n| 2000\n| 1 || 1 || 1 || 6\n| NL: Platinum\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"She Couldn't Laugh\"\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 2001\n| 4 || 6 || 4 || 32\n| rowspan=\"11\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"Children\"\n| 20 || 18 || 23 || 6\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"This Is How It Is\"\n| — || — || — || (67)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"I Need to Know\"\n| 2002\n| 46 || 51 || 43 || (61)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"Tell Me\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2003\n| — || — || — || —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"I'll See You\"\n| 44 || 24 || — || —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"De Juste Snaar\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2011\n| — || — || — || —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"Heart of Glass\"\n| — || — || — || —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"Fugelfrij\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2016\n| — || — || — || —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"She Won't Let Go\"\n| — || — || — || —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"Tink Oan My\"\n| 2017\n| — || — || — || —\n|-\n| colspan=\"18\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |\n|}\nNotes and references\n;Notes\n;References\nExternal links\n*[http://www.mirmusic.nl/ Mirmusic]"
