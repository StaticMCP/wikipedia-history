It was formerly included in the \"Old World warbler\" assemblage. The species was first described by Robert Swinhoe in 1860.\nIt breeds from eastern Mongolia and south-eastern Russia to eastern China and Japan,\nand winters in Southeast Asia.\nThe black-browed reed warbler is similar and closely related to the more common and widespread Eurasian reed warbler. The bird spends its time foraging close to the ground inside undisturbed reed beds.  Like many other wetland birds, it is of conservation concern owing to habitat loss due to the destruction of native marsh vegetation and its replacement by rice paddies and fishponds.\nReferences"
