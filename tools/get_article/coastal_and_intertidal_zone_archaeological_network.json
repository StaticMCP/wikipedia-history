The project's main host is the Museum of London Archaeology with project partners the Council for British Archaeology and the Nautical Archaeology Society. The project is sponsored by the Heritage Lottery Fund, The National Trust, The Crown Estate, and Historic England.\nThe project is currently led by Gustav Milne, an Honorary Senior Lecturer at the UCL Institute of Archaeology. The team, as of October 2018, consisted of nine with all additional support to archaeology projects being provided by volunteers.\nIn 2018 they won the Arts, Culture, and Heritage prize at the Charity Awards 2018 – the Civil Society Media's annual awards programme to recognise organisations for their commendable charitable work and were granted further backing by the Heritage Lottery Fund beyond their initial three year funding cycle.\nIn addition to archaeological digs arranged by CITiZAN, the organisation arranges open days at historical locations to inform people of their work and methods in archaeology.\nIn 2018 CITiZAN team members joined the Channel 4 program Britain at Low Tide for its second series.\nIn 2022, CITiZAN ran a project at Mersea Island to record 60 years of peoples memories and documenting past industries damage that had led to the island's erosion.\nIn 2024, the Archaeology Data Service published the CITiZAN archives, a record of over 6,000 images, plus archaeology Datasets collated by CITIZAN since its inception.
