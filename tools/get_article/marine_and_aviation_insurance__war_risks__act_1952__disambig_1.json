This enables the Government of the United Kingdom to provide war risk insurance cover in emergency circumstances, which might not otherwise be available except at prohibitive premium rates. This, in turn, ensures that should hostilities occur, or even on the threat of hostilities, ships and aeroplanes will not be held up, or the trade of the country interfered with, due to lack of insurance.\nReferences"
