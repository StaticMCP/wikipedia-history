Its heartland was the area previously occupied by the Unetice culture, and its territory included parts of Germany, the Czech Republic, Austria, Switzerland, the Carpathian Basin, Poland and France. It was succeeded by the Late Bronze Age Urnfield culture and part of the origin of the Italic and Celtic cultures.\nArtefacts and characteristics\n, 16th-14th century BC]]\nThe Tumulus culture is distinguished by the practice of burying the dead beneath burial mounds (tumuli or kurgans).\nIn 1902, Paul Reinecke distinguished a number of cultural horizons based on research of Bronze Age hoards and tumuli in periods covered by these cultural horizons are shown in the table below (right). The Tumulus culture was prevalent during the Bronze Age periods B, C1, and C2. Tumuli have been used elsewhere in Europe from the Stone Age to the Iron Age; the term \"Tumulus culture\" specifically refers to the South German variant of the Bronze Age. In the table, Ha designates Hallstatt. Archaeological horizons Hallstatt A–B are part of the Bronze Age Urnfield culture, while horizons Hallstatt C–D are the type site for the Iron Age Hallstatt culture.\nThe Tumulus culture was eminently a warrior society, which expanded with new chiefdoms eastward into the Carpathian Basin (up to the river Tisza), and northward into Polish and Central European Únětice territories.\nSome scholars see Tumulus groups from southern Germany as corresponding to a community that shared an extinct Indo-European linguistic entity, such as the hypothetical Italo-Celtic group that was ancestral to Italic and Celtic. This particular hypothesis, however, conflicts with suggestions by other Indo-Europeanists. For instance, David W. Anthony suggests that Proto-Italic (and perhaps also Proto-Celtic) speakers could have entered Northern Italy at an earlier stage, from the east (e.g., the Balkan/Adriatic region).\nCulture\n, Germany,  (reconstruction)|305x305px]]\nSettlements\nThe culture's dispersed settlements consisted of villages or homesteads centered on fortified structures such as hillforts. Significant fortified settlements include the Heuneburg, Bullenheimer Berg, Ehrenbürg, and Bernstorf. Fortification walls were built from wood, stone and clay. The massive 3.6m-wide wall surrounding the plateau of the Ehrenbürg resembled later murus gallicus fortifications known from the Iron Age. 'Cyclopean' stone fortifications topped with wooden battlements were constructed  at the large hillfort of Stätteberg in Bavaria.\nTrade\nTumulus culture societies traded with those in Scandinavia, Atlantic Europe, the Mediterranean region and the Aegean. Traded items included amber and metal artefacts. From the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age there is evidence for the use of weighed metal as form of payment or money. Weighing equipment has been found in central Europe dating from c. 1400 BC onwards.\nMetalwork\nThe Bronze Hand of Prêles from Switzerland, dating from the 16th-15th century BC, is a unique find from the Tumulus culture period. Described as \"the earliest metal representation of a human body part ever found in Europe\", it may have been a ritual object, or mounted on a standard like similar metal hands known from the Iron Age, or possibly a prosthesis. It was found in a grave along with a bronze hair-ring, pin and dagger. The hand had a golden bracelet or cuff decorated with solar motifs.\nCalendar\nGolden hats from Schifferstadt in Germany and Avanton in France, dating from the late Tumulus period (c. 1400 BC), may have been worn by elite religious figures, described as 'oracles' or 'king-priests' by researchers. The patterns of ornaments or symbols on the hats are thought to represent calendars, as on the later and more elaborate Berlin Gold Hat, which may encode knowledge of the luni-solar Metonic cycle. Some researchers have suggested that a Venus calendar is encoded on the Schifferstadt hat and later Ezeldorf and Berlin gold hats. Gold discs from the Czech Republic, dating from c. 1650-1250 BC, feature similar ornaments and are thought to represent simpler calendars. Identical 'ritual objects' from Haschendorf in Austria and Balkåkra in Sweden may also date from the Middle Bronze Age and have been interpreted as solar calendars. Simple numerals on the objects in the form of lines and dots represent assembly instructions for the objects. Similar 'counting marks' were also used by craftsmen in the production of swords. The repeated use of numbers 10, 20, 30 in the construction of the Balkåkra and Haschendorf objects suggests the use of a ten-digit system.\nGallery\nFile:Gentleman, Bronze Age, 15th century BC, replica - Naturhistorisches Museum Nürnberg - Nuremberg, Germany -DSC04215.jpg|alt=|Bronze Age dress, 15th century BC, Germany\nFile:Molzbach 1.jpg|The Girl from Molzbach, Germany, c. 1300 BC\nFile:Wetteraumuseum Grab BZ Woelfersheim.jpg|Grave goods from Wölfersheim, Germany\nFile:Middle Bronze Age swords, 1600-1400 BC.png|Bronze swords, 1600-1400 BC\nFile:Middlebronze3.jpg|alt=|Burial goods, 1400 BC\nFile:Hortfund Bronzezeit.JPG|Bronze & gold items, Germany,\nFile:Bronze spiral ornaments, Tumulus culture.png|Bronze spiral arm ornaments, c. 1500 BC\nFile:ALB - Goldarmband Nassenheide.jpg|Gold bracelet from Nassenheide, Germany\nFile:Gobelets - Man - Saint-Germain-en-Laye - 27 mars 2017.jpg|Gold artefacts, France,\nFile:Golden decorated disc, 1800-1300 BC, Museum of Western Bohemia, 187791.jpg|alt=Gold disc, Czech Rep., 1650-1250 BC.|Gold disc, Czechia, c.1650 BC.\nFile:Eschenz gold cup 1.jpg|Gold cup from Eschenz, Switzerland,\nFile:Speyer-2009-historisches-museum-026.jpg|Schifferstadt gold hat, Germany, .\nFile:Cône d'Avanton, musée des Antiquités Nationales, 2010-03-26.jpg|Avanton gold hat, France,\nFile:Museum für Vor- und Frühgeschichte Berlin 019.jpg|Gold artefacts, Germany, 14th c.
