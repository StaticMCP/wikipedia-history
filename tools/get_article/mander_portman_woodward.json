The majority of students take two-year A-level courses. The chairman of the Governors is Steve Boyes. The CEO of the company is Spencer Coles, the former chief operating officer of Regent's University London.\nHistory\nThe school was formed in its current structure in 1973 by Robert Woodward, Rodney Portman and Nicholas Mander with the aim of applying University of Cambridge-style tutorial teaching to school age students. MPW teaches in small groups (fewer than 10 students per class). Mander Portman Woodward also offers Easter Revision courses for GCSE, AS and A level students from other schools. The London and Birmingham colleges are part of the CIFE group. MPW produce a range of books including 'Getting into...' guides, 'How to complete UCAS' and 'A-Z of surviving exams'.\nResults and destinations\nAt each MPW college in 2020 the most commonly achieved (modal) A level grade was A/A* and over 50% of examination entries were at this level.\nThe colleges are also successful in terms of value-add, which measures the distance travelled by students at A level relative to where they were at GCSE,  and in their improvement of retake student grades, as reported by the Times. and Sunday Times.\nIn 2023, 35.6% of students at MPW London scored A*-A for A Levels. In the same year (2023), 24.6% of students at MPW Birmingham scored A*-A for A Levels. MPW Birmingham's 2023 A-Level grades were below the national average, in which 26.5% of students achieved an A*-A across England.\nCurriculum\nThe majority of students take A level courses. A small cohort each year take GCSE/IGCSE courses. One-year university foundation programmes are available for international students. The AQA Extended Project Qualification (EPQ) is available to students wishing to take this alongside their other studies usually in year 12.\nFull A level and GCSE courses are taught over two years, 18 months or an intensive one-year short course. An increasing number of students also join MPW at the end of year 12 either to complete the courses that they have started at their previous schools or to begin a new set of subjects. There are 43 subjects available and no timetable restrictions.\nCo-curricular\nExtra-curricular provision is available at all three colleges. Sport is popular; other options include charity fund-raising, student council and Duke of Edinburgh award.\nEaster Revision\nEaster Revision courses are taught in London, Birmingham and Cambridge for three weeks in March/April; MPW's status as a revision course provider was described by the Daily Telegraph as \"quasi-legendary\". Current students attend the courses, which are also available to external students; over 1600 join the colleges each year for Easter Revision. The courses are designed to prepare students for GCSE, AS and A level examinations the following summer.\nLondon\nThe college is in South Kensington on the road of Queen's Gate.
