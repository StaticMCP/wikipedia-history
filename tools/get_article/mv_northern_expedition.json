She sails daily on the Inside Passage route connecting Prince Rupert and Port Hardy.\nHistory\nOn August 18, 2006 BC Ferries awarded the contract to build a replacement vessel for  to Flensburger Schiffbau-Gesellschaft shipyard in Flensburg, Germany (the same shipyard awarded the contract for the three new  ferries).  Shortly thereafter it was determined that the new ship would be named Northern Expedition and that BC Ferries' other northern vessel (the recently purchased Sonia, the replacement for the sunken ) would be named .\nThe keel of the vessel was laid on June 16, 2008 and she was launched on September 25, 2008. Sea trials took place in the Baltic Sea east from Danish island Bornholm between January 7–9, 2009. The vessel left Germany on January 30, 2009 bound for British Columbia via the Panama Canal.  Northern Expedition completed her  journey on March 6, 2009, passing Victoria and Vancouver before arriving in Departure Bay at Nanaimo for post-voyage inspection.\nNorthern Expedition entered service on May 18, 2009 along the Inside Passage route between Prince Rupert and Port Hardy.  She joined Northern Adventure in BC Ferries' northern fleet and allowed for the retirement of Queen of Prince Rupert.\nAmenities\nNorthern Expeditions four passenger decks feature:\n*55 staterooms\n*the Canoe Cafe\n*the Vista Restaurant\n*the reserved seating Aurora Lounge\n*the Raven Lounge, which features 3 large-screen TV's\n*the Passages Gift Shop\n*a children's play area\n*multiple non-reserved seating lounges\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.bcferries.com/about/newbuild/newbuildprogram.html BC Ferries Newbuild Program]\n* [http://www.bcferries.com/about/newbuild/northern_expedition/index.html BC Ferries Northern Expedition Updates]\n| title  = BC Ferries northern flagship\n| years  = 2007–present)}}\n| after  = }}\n}}"
