Sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens and architect Stanford White collaborated on the memorial, which was completed in 1896. It is located in Fairmount Park, along Kelly Drive, near the Girard Avenue Bridge.\nHistory\nPresident Garfield was shot by an assassin in Washington, D.C., on July 2, 1881, and died of his wounds at the White House on September 19. Later that year, the Fairmount Park Art Association (which became the Association for Public Art) initiated a fundraising campaign to erect a monument to him in Philadelphia. This was the second monument to be commissioned by the Association, which selected Augustus Saint-Gaudens in 1889 to design and create the work.\nCast in 1895, the monument was formally dedicated on May 30, 1896 by Mayor Charles F. Warwick.
