Shortly after World War I began, the ship participated in the Battle of Antivari in the Adriatic Sea and helped to sink an Austro-Hungarian protected cruiser. She spent most of the rest of the war blockading the Straits of Otranto and the Dardanelles to prevent German, Austro-Hungarian and Turkish warships from breaking out into the Mediterranean. Diderot briefly participated in the occupation of Constantinople after the end of the war. She was modernized in 1922–1925 and subsequently became a training ship. The ship was condemned in 1936 and later sold for scrap.\nDesign and description\nAlthough the s were a significant improvement from the preceding , they were outclassed by the advent of the dreadnought well before they were completed. This, combined with other poor traits, including the great weight in coal they had to carry, making them rather unsuccessful ships, though their numerous rapid-firing guns were of some use in the Mediterranean.\nDiderot was  long overall and had a beam of  and a full-load draft of . She displaced  at deep load and had a crew of 681 officers and enlisted men. The ship was powered by four Parsons steam turbines using steam generated by twenty-six Belleville boilers. The turbines were rated at  and provided a top speed of around . Diderot, however, reached a top speed of  on her sea trials. She carried a maximum of  of coal which allowed her to steam for  at a speed of .\nDiderots main battery consisted of four 305mm/45 Modèle 1906 guns mounted in two twin gun turrets, one forward and one aft. The secondary battery consisted of twelve 240mm/50 Modèle 1902 guns in twin turrets, three on each side of the ship. A number of smaller guns were carried for defense against torpedo boats. These included sixteen  L/65 guns and ten  Hotchkiss guns. The ship was also armed with two submerged  torpedo tubes. The ship's waterline armor belt was  thick and the main battery was protected by up to  of armor. The conning tower also had 300&nbsp;mm thick sides.\nWartime modifications\nDuring the war 75&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft guns were installed on the roofs of the ship's two forward 240&nbsp;mm gun turrets. During 1918, the elevation of the 240&nbsp;mm guns was increased which extended their range to .\nCareer\nConstruction of Diderot began on 26 December 1906 by Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire in Saint-Nazaire and the ship was laid down on 20 October 1907. She was launched on 19 April 1909 and was completed on 1 August 1911. The ship was assigned to the First Division of the First Squadron (escadre) of the Mediterranean Fleet when she was commissioned. The ship participated in combined fleet maneuvers between Provence and Tunisia in May–June 1913 and the subsequent naval review conducted by the President of France, Raymond Poincaré on 7 June 1913. Afterwards, Diderot joined her squadron in its tour of the Eastern Mediterranean in October–December 1913 and participated in the grand fleet exercise in the Mediterranean in May 1914.\nWorld War I\nIn early August 1914, the ship cruised the Strait of Sicily in an attempt to prevent the German battlecruiser  and the light cruiser  from breaking out to the West. On 16 August 1914 the combined Anglo-French Fleet under Admiral Auguste Boué de Lapeyrère, including Diderot, made a sweep of the Adriatic Sea. The Allied ships encountered the Austro-Hungarian cruiser , escorted by the destroyer , blockading the coast of Montenegro. There were too many ships for Zenta to escape, so she remained behind to allow Ulan to get away and was sunk by gunfire during the Battle of Antivari off the coast of Bar, Montenegro. Diderot subsequently participated in a number of raids into the Adriatic later in the year and patrolled the Ionian Islands. From December 1914 through 1917, the ship participated in the distant blockade of the Straits of Otranto while based in Corfu. In May 1918, Diderot became flagship of the First Division of the Second Squadron and was transferred that month to Mudros with her sister ships,  and , to prevent Goeben from breaking out into the Mediterranean and remained there until the end of the war.\nPostwar\nAfter the Armistice of Mudros was signed on 30 October between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire, the ship participated in the early stage of the occupation of Constantinople from 12 November to 12 December. Diderot was based in Toulon throughout 1919 and was modernized in 1922–25 to improve her underwater protection. The ship became a training ship in 1927 and was condemned on 17 March 1937; sold to M. Gosselin-Duriez on 30 July 1937 for 3,557,010 FF, she arrived at Dunkirk for breaking up on 31 August.\nNotes\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*  [http://le.fantasque.free.fr/php3/ship.php3?page_code=danton CUIRASSE Danton]"
