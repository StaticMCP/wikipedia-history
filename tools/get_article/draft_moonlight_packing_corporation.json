The company specializes in the production, packing, and distribution of stone fruit, including peaches, plums, and nectarines, grown across more than 20,000 acres in California and Washington.\nHistory\nMoonlight was founded by Russ Tavlan, an agricultural entrepreneur based in Reedley, California. Starting from a small operation, Tavlan grew Moonlight into a vertically integrated farming and packing enterprise. The company gained industry recognition for its consistent fruit quality and rapid cold-chain logistics.\nMoonlight's acquisition of approximately 5,000 acres from Prima Wawona in 2024 was a transformative moment. Prima Wawona had long been recognized as the largest peach grower in the United States. With this strategic acquisition, Moonlight is now widely regarded as the largest peach farming operation in the U.S. with Sun Pacific to purchase approximately 5,000 acres of farmland and packing facilities from Prima Wawona, with the transaction valued at $91 million. Tavlan said he and Berne Evans were \"honored to buy a large share of property from legacy farming families.\"\nOperations\nMoonlight currently farms over 20,000 acres of stone fruit and citrus across California’s Central Valley and Washington. Its packing facilities are known for high-efficiency pre-cooling and shipping operations, which allow fruit to be shipped within 24 hours of harvest. \"Moonlight Packing: 24-Hour Cold Chain Commitment\". Internal business communication.\nThe company employs approximately 9,000 workers across its farming, packing, and distribution operations.\nAcquisitions and Licensing\nIn 2014, Moonlight was awarded a licensing agreement from Sun World International, granting access to exclusive fruit varieties developed by the breeder.\nMarket and Branding\nMoonlight-branded produce is distributed nationally and is found in many major retailers. The company is known for its focus on freshness and high visual standards in packing. In-store photos and user-generated content on social media platforms have highlighted consumer engagement with the Moonlight brand. Moonlight’s brand presence has been highlighted in national grocery chains and covered in trade media.\nPhilanthropy\nMoonlight Packing Corporation and its founder Russ Tavlan have contributed to various charitable organizations. Tavlan was honored at the annual Food Industries Circle luncheon hosted by City of Hope in 2016 for his contributions to cancer research charities.\nExternal Links\n[https://www.moonlightcompanies.com Official Website]"
