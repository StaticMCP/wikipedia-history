At the time Dr. Schinzel made no conclusion of the hereditary pattern of this syndrome but similarities between  cases reported by year 2000 seem to suggest autosomal or x-linked recessive inheritance or possibly a dominant mutation caused by mosaicism as causes of this syndrome.\nReferences\n* Johns Hopkins University: [https://omim.org/entry/203550 OMIM, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, MIM ID 203550]\nExternal links\n-->\n|  ICDO            =\n|  OMIM            = 203550\n|  DiseasesDB      =\n|  MedlinePlus     =\n|  eMedicineSubj   =\n|  eMedicineTopic  =\n|  MeSH            = C537051\n|  GeneReviewsNBK  =\n|  GeneReviewsName =\n|  Orphanet        = 1005\n}}"
