The venue of this season was moved to CAA Centre in Brampton, Ontario.\nProduction\nRon MacLean returns as host, with Canadian singer Keshia Chanté joining as the new co-host. Previous host and judge Kurt Browning is the \"Elite Battle Expert\" this season acting as a correspondent, and provides colour commentary throughout the series. The judging panel saw a complete overhaul this season, with the additions of Olympic ice dancing gold medalist Scott Moir, Olympic ice hockey gold medalist and season 5 runner-up Natalie Spooner, and Junior Canadian figure skating champion Elladj Baldé. For the first time in the series' history, a record three female ice hockey players and three male figure skaters, were cast as contestants this season, besting the number of two female ice hockey players in season 5.\nBecause of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, there is no live studio audience for the taping of the season. Instead, viewers were encouraged to sign up to become \"virtual audience\" members to attend the tapings of the series, and have a livestream video of themselves broadcast via screens placed in the audience sections of the arena, to the effect of having these viewers being in the actual audience inside the arena.\nThe season premiere date was originally scheduled for October 15, 2020. On October 7, 2020, all training and pre-production was halted, after a member of the production team was tested positive for COVID-19. The season premiere is then postponed and rescheduled for October 22, 2020.\nRatings\nThe rescheduled season premiere on October 22, 2020 was broadcast up against the 2020 United States presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. The debate brought in over 3 million viewers and was the top rated television program of the week. The Battle of the Blades premiere drew in 455,000 viewers. For the first time in the history of the series, the season premiere did not place in the Top 30 for the weekly most watched television programs in Canada.\nCouples\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!
