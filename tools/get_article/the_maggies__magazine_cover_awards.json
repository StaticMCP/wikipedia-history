Initiated by online magazine and newspaper subscription company, iSUBSCRiBE, The Maggies aim to raise the profile of the entire magazine industry.\nOriginally started in the UK in September 2009, the Maggie Awards were also launched in Australia and New Zealand in June 2010. The Maggies recognize those covers that resonate most strongly with the general public, encapsulate the passion of the subject matter, capture the spirit of the previous year and provoke the most debate.\nHello! magazine in the UK referred to the Awards as “...the magazine industry’s answer to The Oscars.”\nA panel of magazine industry heavyweights are picked for the panel of judges who shortlist the nominated covers, selecting five titles per category, which are then put to public vote via The Maggies website.\nPast Magazine Cover of the Year Winners\nQ magazine featuring Lily Allen and a couple of black panthers was crowned Magazine Cover of the Year in the inaugural awards in the UK.  The 2010 awards saw 8 category winners and one overall winner, with the September 2009 issue of GQ taking this honour, with a seductive image of Sienna Miller on the cover.\nPast Category Winners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
