One reason given for Trump winning counties in Appalachian Ohio in the 2016 Ohio Republican primary was Democratic voters opposed to free trade who had voted in the Republican primary. In general exit polls by CNN showed Ohio Democratic voters with slightly less support for Clinton than the national average, and Trump receiving higher support among Democratic voters in Ohio than Mitt Romney had in the 2012 election.\nHillary Clinton had relatively low support in Appalachia from Democratic voters. In interviews with The Guardian, Appalachian Democrats voting for Trump cited concerns about NAFTA and coal mining. An exit poll showed Donald Trump receiving 22% of the Democratic vote in Kentucky, a state Clinton had won overwhelmingly in the 2008 presidential primary. Elliott County, Kentucky, which had the longest unbroken streak of voting Democrat of any county in the United States, went for Trump. Some Appalachian states, such as Tennessee and West Virginia, did not have exit polls.\nOverall CNN exit polls indicated Clinton received 89% of the Democratic vote, compared with House Democrats receiving 92% of the Democratic vote. The difference between percentage of Republicans voting for a Republican representative and voting for Trump was six points. The Democrats who voted for Trump have been labelled \"Trumpocrats\".\nThere were also Democratic voters who favored Jill Stein. In Oregon, Stein received one percent of the Democratic vote according to CNN exit polls, equal to the total for all third-party voting among Democrats in 2012.\nProminent Democrats who supported other candidates\nThis list also includes people who left the Democratic Party in 2016.\nDemocrats for Trump\n* Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots\n* David Clarke, Sheriff of Milwaukee County\n* Michael T.
