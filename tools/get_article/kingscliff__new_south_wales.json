Together with the villages of Chinderah and Fingal, it is a tourist destination that provides beach and estuary access for swimming, surfing, fishing and water sports.\nIts main street, Marine Parade, contains many cafes, shops and accommodation located directly across from Kingscliff beach and creek. The town also has two primary schools and a state high school.\nAn oceanway allows pedestrians and cyclists to move from the historic centre of town out to the emerging new communities along the Tweed Coast in a sustainable manner.\nKingscliff was the home to Peter and Jeremy Oxley who formed the 1980s band, The Sunnyboys.\nA scene from the film Aquamarine was filmed on Marine Parade in late 2007.\nThe main Kingscliff beach has been severely affected by erosion, with portions of the caravan park and beachside carparks being threatened or reclaimed by the sea. In December 2014, the state environment ministry announced it would split with Tweed Shire the $300,000 cost of an environmental impact study for a plan to build a 500-metre seawall and fill in the beach with imported sand.\nIn March 2016 work began on the Kingscliff Foreshore Revitalisation Project which will be rolled out in 3 stages. Stage 1 involves building a new seawall to save the Cudgen Headland Surf Life Saving Club, Kingscliff Beach Holiday Park and Kingscliff Beach Bowls Club from erosion. Stage 2 is to refurbish Kingscliff Beach Holiday Park, meaning a roll back of camping facilities with a focus on cabins. Stage 3 will be focused on creating a more community oriented space for tourists and locals alike with the development of Kingscliff Central Park. The park is expected to become the new social hub of Kingscliff and make the transition from the main street to the beach more streamlined. It will also result in far better beach views for businesses on Marine Parade.\nHistory\nThe town takes its name from a proximate estate. Originally known as Sutherland Point and then Cudgen Headland, it was established in 1926 as Kingscliff. It developed into a small seaside resort and abides as a popular tourist destination.\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2016 census of Population, there were 7,464 people in Kingscliff.\n* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 3.8% of the population.\n* 78.9% of people were born in Australia.

The club competes in the Gold Coast Premier League, where it has been one of the leading sides for the past few decades.\nThere are many bike paths for local cyclists through the parks along Kingscliff's beaches. The neighbouring locality of Salt, part of the small town of Casuarina, is accessible via a bike path.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
