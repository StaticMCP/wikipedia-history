      "text": "# Phorward\n\nPhorward is a mini-album by the Scottish band The Shamen. It was released in 1989 on Moksha Records. It was billed as a \"mini album\" because the original vinyl release had only six tracks.\nBackground\nOn the CD version, DJ Eddie Richards remixed tracks including \"You Me and Everything\", \"Reraptyouare\", \"Splash 2\", and \"Phorward\", further expanding the musical impact the mini-album made on the acid house scene.
