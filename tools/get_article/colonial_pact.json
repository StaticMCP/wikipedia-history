Examples of known pacts are the one between Portugal and Brazil (colony), and countries in Europe that had colonies in America.\nThe colonial pact limited the economic activities of the colonial elite. On the one hand, the colonized could only sell their products to merchants approved by the colonizing nation, which did not guarantee them good prices. On the other hand, the prohibition of manufacturing in the colonies prevented the colonial elite from investing in a different sector than the agrarian.\nBrazil\nIn Brazil, an example of a colonial pact occurred with the exploitation of brazilwood. Sebastian, then king of Portugal, declared brazilwood exploitation a monopoly of the Portuguese, meaning that no one could extract brazilwood without permission from the Portuguese crown and the payment of taxes. This monopoly lasted until the Portuguese royal family came to Brazil in 1808. Soon after they docked, John VI, prince regent, opened the Brazilian ports to friendly nations.\nReferences"
