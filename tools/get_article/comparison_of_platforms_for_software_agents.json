      "text": "# Comparison of platforms for software agents\n\nThere several platforms for software agents or also agent development toolkits, which can facilitate the development of multi-agent systems. Hereby, software agents are implemented as independent threads which communicate with each other using agent communication languages. Below is a chart intended to capture many of the features that are important to such platforms.\nComparison of platforms\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sort-under\"\n|+ Agent-based modeling toolkit comparison\n|-\n!
