Akishev. The area of the settlement was determined, the structure of city fortifications was studied, a complex of material culture of the 9th  to 10th centuries was identified – ceramic dishes, items of local handicraft production, and imported products were also found. The walls had typical cities of Semirechye design, initially at a distance of 3&nbsp;m from each other were constructed of two parallel stone walls with a height of 2&nbsp;m, the clutch was used large rounded stones, bonded with clay mortar, the space between them were filled with clay, and above the wall was built up with layers of clay with thickness up to 20&nbsp;cm Clay taken on both sides of the wall, but mostly outside, resulting in front of the wall formed a moat. The city was medium-sized, with no more than 2,200 inhabitants.
