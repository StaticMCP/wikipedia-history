The All-Star game has not been held in various years: 1979 and 1987 due to the 1979 Challenge Cup and Rendez-vous '87 series between the NHL and the Soviet national team, respectively, 1995, 2005, and 2013 as a result of labor stoppages, 2006, 2010, and 2014 because of the Winter Olympic Games, and 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The franchise has yet to host one of the games.\n* Selected by fan vote\n* Selected by Commissioner\n* All-Star Game Most Valuable Player\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\"\n|+Arizona Coyotes franchise players and coaches selected to the NHL All-Star Game\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" | Game\n!scope=\"col\" | Year\n!scope=\"col\" | Name\n!scope=\"col\" | Position\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| References\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 32nd\n|1980\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 33rd\n|1981\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 34th\n|1982\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 35th\n|1983\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 36th\n|1984\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" | 37th\n|rowspan=\"3\" |1985\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 38th\n|1986\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 39th\n|1988\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 40th\n|1989\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 41st\n|rowspan=\"2\" |1990\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n| (Did not play)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 42nd\n|1991\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 43rd\n|1992\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" | 44th\n|rowspan=\"3\" |1993\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 45th\n|1994\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 46th\n|1996\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 47th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |1997\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 48th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |1998\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"5\" | 49th\n|rowspan=\"5\" | 1999\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 50th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2000\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 51st\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2001\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 52nd\n|2002\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 53rd\n|2003\n|No Coyotes selected\n|—\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 54th\n|2004\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 55th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2007\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 56th\n|2008\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 57th\n|2009\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 58th\n|2011\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 59th\n|2012\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 60th\n|2015\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 61st\n|2016\n| However, as a result of the trade, Scott wore a generic jersey, and was not a representative for Arizona; Arizona, as a result of trading away its only All-Star, was the only team not represented in the events.}}\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 62nd\n|2017\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 63rd\n|2018\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 64th\n|2019\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 65th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2020\n| (Did not play)\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|}}\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 66th\n|2022\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 67th\n|2023\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 68th\n|2024\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nAll-Star Game replacement events\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\"\n|+Winnipeg Jets players and coaches selected to All-Star Game replacement events\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" | Event\n!scope=\"col\" | Year\n!scope=\"col\" | Name\n!scope=\"col\" | Position\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| References\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |\n|1987\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nCareer achievements\nHockey Hall of Fame\nThe following is a list of Arizona Coyotes who have been enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\"\n|+Arizona Coyotes franchise players and personnel inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame\n! scope=\"col\" |Individual\n! scope=\"col\" |Category\n! scope=\"col\" |Year inducted\n! scope=\"col\" |Years with Coyotes franchise in category\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |References\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Builder\n|2004\n|2000–2007\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2001\n|1996–1998\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2001\n|1981–1990\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2015\n|1990–1993\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|1983\n|1972–1980\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2009\n|2005\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|1986\n|1981–1983\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2017\n|1992–1996\n|\n|}\nFoster Hewitt Memorial Award\nOne member of the Coyotes organization has been honored with the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award.
