North Vietnam, South Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand and the United States all issued awards and decorations to their personnel during, or after, the conflict.\nSouth Vietnam as a country ceased to exist after North Vietnam's victory in the Vietnam War. Therefore, the country of South Vietnam's awards and decorations are considered obsolete. With the fall of South Vietnam, that country's official records of who received which awards disappeared. Records or evidence of awards were sometimes maintained by U.S. military units or in an award recipient's service record, so those may be available to an award recipient looking for confirmation of a (defunct) foreign country award received.\nDespite being obsolete, earned foreign South Vietnam decorations and awards remain authorized for US military members who received awards. If an award recipient no longer possesses an original award, companies or individuals have available for purchase South Vietnam's military insignia and awards.\nSouth Vietnam\nSenior leadership decorations\n*National Order of Vietnam\n**  Grand Cross\n**  Grand Officer\n**  Commander\n**  Officer\n**  Knight\n*Vietnam Distinguished Service Order\n**  Army First Class Ribbon\n**  Army Second Class Ribbon\n**  Navy First Class Ribbon\n**  Navy Second Class Ribbon\n**  Air Force First Class Ribbon\n**  Air Force Second Class Ribbon\nHeroism decorations\n* Vietnam Military Merit Medal\nCommon decorations\n*Vietnam Gallantry Cross\n**  Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm Ribbon\n**  Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Gold Star Ribbon\n**  Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Silver Star Ribbon\n**  Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Bronze star Ribbon\n*Vietnam Civil Actions Medal\n** 80px First Class Ribbon\n**  Second Class Ribbon\n*80px Vietnam Campaign Medal\nUnit citations\n*80px Vietnam Presidential Unit Citation\n*80px Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation\n*80px Vietnam Civil Actions Unit Citation\nOther awards\n*  Vietnam Special Service Medal\n*Vietnam Armed Forces Honor Medal\n**  First Class Ribbon\n**  Second Class Ribbon\n*Vietnam Staff Service Medal\n**  First Class Ribbon\n**  Second Class Ribbon\n*Vietnam Air Gallantry Cross\n** Vietnam Air Gallantry Cross with Gold Wing Ribbon\n** Vietnam Air Gallantry Cross with Silver Wing Ribbon\n** Vietnam Air Gallantry Cross with Bronze Wing Ribbon\n*Vietnam Navy Gallantry Cross\n** Vietnam Navy Gallantry Cross with Gold Anchor Ribbon\n** Vietnam Navy Gallantry Cross with Silver Anchor Ribbon\n** Vietnam Navy Gallantry Cross with Bronze Anchor  Ribbon\nNorth Vietnam\n*  Ho Chi Minh Order\n* Defeat American Aggression Badge\n* Vietnam Liberation Order\nUnited States\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\"\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" |Medal of Honor\n|-\n|center\n|-\n|100px\n|-\n|}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\"\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Distinguished Service Cross(Navy Cross, Airforce Cross)\n|-\n|center\n|-\n|100px\n|-\n|}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\"\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" |Silver Star\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" |Legion of Merit\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" |DistinguishedFlying Cross\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" |MeritoriousService Medal\n|-\n|center\n|center\n|center\n|center\n|-\n|100px\n|center\n|100px\n|100px\n|-\n|}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\"\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" |Bronze Star Medal\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" |Purple Heart\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" |Air Medal\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" |Vietnam Service Medal\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" |Armed ForcesExpeditionary Medal\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" |National DefenseService Medal\n|-\n|\n|\n|center\n|center\n|center\n|center\n|-\n|100px\n|100px\n|center\n|center\n|center\n|100px\n|-\n|}\nSeveral decorations (Distinguished Flying Cross, Bronze Star Medal, Air Medal, Commendation Medal, Joint Service Commendation Medal) may be awarded for valor, or for merit. Awards for valor recognize bravery in action against an enemy and have an attached \"V\" device valor device. Awards for merit recognize service.\nThe Commendation Medal was another decoration of the Vietnam War, issued frequently in various versions by the different branches of the US armed forces.\nAustralia and New Zealand\nAustralia and New Zealand awarded British and Commonwealth orders and decorations to their servicemen in Vietnam, including the Distinguished Service Order and the Military Cross\nAustralia and New Zealand jointly developed and instituted the Vietnam Medal (though separate Royal Warrants were issued). The obverse of the medal displays an effigy of Queen Elizabeth II, the reverse shows a man standing between two spheres, a symbolic representation of the ideological struggle. The ribbon incorporates the colours of the three armed services (red, navy blue, and sky blue), and the national colours of Vietnam (red and yellow).\nIn 1992, Australia struck the Vietnam Logistic and Support Medal. The medal was intended to recognise the Australian servicemen and civilians who provided support for Australian troops. The qualifying criteria for the Medal are service of one day or more as a member or crew of a ship or aircraft operating in the prescribed area of operations of Vietnam in support of Australian forces, or service of one day or more within the prescribed area of operations of Vietnam while attached to a unit or organisation in support of Australian forces. It has been awarded to military personnel, Qantas crews, civilian medical personnel, and Embassy staff.\nAustralia awarded four Victoria Crosses during the Vietnam War, two posthumously.\nAustralian servicemen were also awarded a number of individual US and South Vietnamese awards, and the following unit citations:\n* HMAS Hobart – US Navy Unit Commendation\n* HMAS Perth – US Navy Unit Commendation, US Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation\n* Clearance Diving Team 3 – US Presidential Unit Citation, Two US Navy Unit Commendations and one US Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation\n* 817 Naval Air Squadron – US Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation\n* AATTV – Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation, US Meritorious Unit Commendation, US Presidential Unit Citation\n* 1 RAR – US Meritorious Unit Commendation, Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation and Unit Citation for Gallantry\n* 3 RAR – Unit Citation for Gallantry\n* 'D' Coy, 6 RAR – US Presidential Unit Citation\n* 8 RAR – Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation\n* No. 2 Squadron RAAF - Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation, USAF Outstanding Unit Award\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20020602163116/http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/about/medal_descriptions/campaign.html Australian Government Campaign Medals page]\n* [http://medals.nzdf.mil.nz/category/c/c4.html New Zealand Defence Force Vietnam Medal Page]\nvi:Bảo quốc Huân chương"
