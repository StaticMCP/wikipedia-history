It lies on the B2115 road  west of Haywards Heath. The name Warninglid is believed to originate from two words, Werna and Gelad (meaning \"Werna's Path\".) It is in the civil parish of Slaugham.\nAt the centre of the village is a crossroads, and there sits the Half Moon public house. A nearby village - Handcross - provides the post office and convenience store for the locals.  Over the last quarter century the village has won the Best-Kept Village competition three times.\nThere is one school serving Warninglid, namely Warninglid Primary School. The school teaches 60 students and is led by Headteacher Marion West.\nReferences\nExternal links"
