The predecessor school President Kennedy School and\nCommunity College was judged outstanding by Ofsted in December 2023.\nHistory\nThe school was founded in 1966 with Dr J. M. Frost the first headmaster. It was originally to be called either Rookery Farm School or Holbrook High, but the assassination of U.S. President John F Kennedy during the approval stage resulted in the school being named after President John F. Kennedy. The school marked the 50th anniversary of John F. Kennedy's assassination with a series of special assemblies and debates led by its History Department. The school is located in the north-west of Coventry and includes the Holbrooks and Whitmore Park areas of the city.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.pks.coventry.sch.uk/ President Kennedy School]\n* [http://www.coventry.gov.uk Coventry City Council]"
