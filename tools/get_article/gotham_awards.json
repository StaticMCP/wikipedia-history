First presented in 1991, the awards were originally created to showcase and honor films made primarily in the Northeastern United States.\nName\nThe name \"Gotham,\" () a nickname for New York, was first popularized by native son Washington Irving in an 1807 issue of Salmagundi.\nScope\nIn 2004, the awards' scope expanded significantly from a regional to a national and international focus. The number of award categories increased from six to nine, and eligibility was broadened to include films from Los Angeles, California, and international locations.\nVenue\nHaving outgrown previous venues in Manhattan, the 17th Annual Gotham Awards ceremony was held for the first time in the Brooklyn borough on November 27, 2007. The gala took place at Steiner Studios in the Brooklyn Navy Yard and was \"promoted nationally via a partnership with The New York Times and locally via broadcast on WNYE.\"\nCategories\nCurrent categories\n* Tribute Award: since 1991\n* Bingham Ray Breakthrough Director Award: since 1991 (formerly the Open Palm Award until 2002, and the Breakthrough Director Award from 2003 to 2012)\n* Breakthrough Performer: since 1998 (known as the Award for Breakthrough Actor until 2020; not awarded in 2023)\n* Best Feature: since 2004\n* Best Documentary: since 2004\n* Spotlight on Women Filmmakers \"Live the Dream\" Grant: since 2011\n* Appreciation Award: since 2015\n* Made in NY Award: since 2016\n* Best International Feature: since 2020\n* Outstanding Lead Performance: since 2021\n* Outstanding Supporting Performance: since 2021\n* Best Director: since 2024\n* Best Original Screenplay: since 2025\n* Best Adapted Screenplay: since 2025\nFrom 1991 to 2002, the Tribute Award (also called Career Tribute) was presented as a single Lifetime Achievement Award.
