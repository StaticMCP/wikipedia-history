The latter year he was raised to the peerage as Baron Harewood, of Harewood in the County of York. In 1812 he was further honoured when he was made Viscount Lascelles and Earl of Harewood, in the County of York.\nPersonal life\nOn 12 May 1761, Lascelles was married to Anne Chaloner (–1805), a daughter of Thomas Chaloner of Guisborough and Mary Finny.
