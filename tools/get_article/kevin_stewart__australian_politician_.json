During his period in office, Stewart held a range of ministerial portfolios, including as Minister for Health and Local Government.\nHis brother, Frank Stewart, was a member of the Australian House of Representatives representing Lang and later Grayndler between 1953 and 1979, also for Labor.\nEarly career and background\nKevin Stewart was born in Belmore, New South Wales. His father, Patrick Francis Stewart was a public servant. Both Kevin and Frank Stewart were educated at Christian Brothers' High School, Lewisham and De La Salle College, Marrickville.\nA member of the ALP from the early age of 17, Kevin was employed by the New South Wales Government Railways from 1944 till his election to parliament. He was an official in the Australasian Transport Officers' Association.\nPolitical career\nStewart defeated Arthur Tonge, the sitting member for Canterbury, in Labor pre-selection and was subsequently elected as the member at the 1962 general election. With the election of the Wran government in 1976, Stewart became the Minister for Health. He retained this position until 1981. His term of office was marked by an attempt to redistribute health resources away from the inner city of Sydney and to  areas of New South Wales with rapidly growing populations, particularly the western suburbs of Sydney.\nStewart subsequently served as Minister for Youth and Community Services (1981–1983), Minister for Mineral Resources (1983–1984) and Minister for Local Government (1984–1985). He retained this seat until he was obliged to resign from parliament in 1985 after being appointed New South Wales Agent-General in London, where he served until 1988.\nIn the 1989 Australia Day honours list, Stewart was made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO).\nStewart died age 77 in Sydney in August 2006.\nCanterbury Bankstown Bulldogs (Rugby League)\nPatrick Francis Stewart, the father of both Kevin and Frank Stewart, was the founding president of the Canterbury Bankstown Leagues Club. The Stewart family's members have been long-term supporters of the Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs. In recognition of this support, the grandstand at Belmore Sports Ground (the former home ground of the club) is named the \"Stewart Stand\" after Patrick, Frank, and Kevin Stewart.\nFollowing an incident where Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs football club was stripped of all points in the National Rugby League competition for breach of the salary cap, Kevin Stewart was appointed chairman of the board in 2002. This appointment was made in an attempt to restore the clubs' reputation. For his service to rugby league, on 8 February 2000 he was awarded the Australian Sports Medal.\nReferences\n&nbsp;"
