Zakho is a Kurdish city of over 50,000 inhabitants. People in the Zakho district of the Duhok Governorate attacked the military bases, stormed government buildings and took control of the town on 13 March. However, the victory came at a cost, as civilians were killed by forces of Saddam Hussein’s regime during clashes at certain military and intelligence sites in the city. The town was recaptured by government forces on 1 April.\nReferences"
