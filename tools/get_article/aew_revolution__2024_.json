      "text": "# AEW Revolution (2024)\n\nThe 2024 Revolution was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by All Elite Wrestling (AEW). It was the fifth annual Revolution and took place on Sunday, March 3, 2024, at the Greensboro Coliseum in Greensboro, North Carolina, marking AEW's first PPV to be held in North Carolina. The event hosted the final match in Sting's nearly 40-year career, and was held at the same venue in which he had faced Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at Clash of the Champions I in March 1988, which is considered to be the match that established Sting as a top wrestler in the industry.\nEleven matches were contested at the event, including two on the \"Zero Hour\" pre-show. The main event was Sting's retirement match in which he and Darby Allin defeated The Young Bucks (Matthew Jackson and Nicholas Jackson) in a tornado tag team match to retain the AEW World Tag Team Championship, and as a result, Sting retired undefeated in AEW. In another prominent match, Samoa Joe defeated \"Hangman\" Adam Page and Swerve Strickland in a three-way match to retain the AEW World Championship. The event also saw the return of Kyle O'Reilly, who had been out with an injury since June 2022, as well as Will Ospreay's first match as a member of the AEW roster, defeating Konosuke Takeshita on the undercard.\nProduction\nBackground\nin Greensboro, North Carolina, marking All Elite Wrestling's first pay-per-view event to be held in North Carolina.]]\nRevolution is a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event held annually by All Elite Wrestling (AEW) since 2020—it was originally held in late February but moved to early March in 2021. It is one of AEW's \"Big Four\" PPVs, which also includes Double or Nothing, All Out, and Full Gear, their four biggest domestic shows produced quarterly.\nThe 2024 Revolution was confirmed by AEW wrestler and wrestling veteran Sting on the October 18, 2023, episode of Dynamite. Sting recapped how he had his AEW debut match at the 2021 Revolution, which was a cinematic tag team street fight with tag partner Darby Allin, and then announced that he would have the final match in his nearly 40-year career at the 2024 Revolution. During the November 29 episode, the fifth Revolution event was confirmed to be held on March 3, 2024, at the Greensboro Coliseum in Greensboro, North Carolina, the same venue in which Sting famously faced Ric Flair at Clash of the Champions I in March 1988, which was produced by the National Wrestling Alliance's Jim Crockett Promotions. Flair also confirmed he would be in Sting's corner for the match. This was also AEW's first PPV to be held in North Carolina.\nTickets for the event went on sale on December 15, 2023. According to WrestleTix on X, over 13,000 tickets were sold within the first week. Wrestling journalist John Pollock added that AEW had to revise production plans in order to meet fan demand and the company opened up as many seats as possible.\nStorylines\n| footer_align = centre\n| alt1 =\n}}\nRevolution featured professional wrestling matches that were the result of pre-existing feuds and storylines, with results predetermined by AEW's writers. Storylines were produced on AEW's weekly television programs, Dynamite, Collision, and Rampage, and the YouTube series, Being The Dark Order.\nAfter Sting and Darby Allin's victory at Dynamite: Homecoming on January 10 and with Revolution quickly approaching, Tony Schiavone asked Sting who his final opponent would be. Before Sting could answer, The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) interrupted in their first appearance since Full Gear in November 2023. The two teams subsequently stared each other down, with the commentators implying that The Young Bucks wanted to challenge Sting and Allin for Sting's final match. The following week, The Young Bucks, now preferring to be called Matthew and Nicholas Jackson, said they would be taking their roles as AEW executive vice presidents (EVP) more seriously, and said that while they respected Sting, it was time to say goodbye. Later, Allin recapped that he and Sting were undefeated as a tag team and declared that they would end their story together as AEW World Tag Team Champions. They subsequently won the title on the February 7 episode, but after the match, they were brutally attacked by The Young Bucks, who also attacked Sting's sons Garrett Borden and Steven Borden Jr. After The Young Bucks's tag team victory the following week, they subsequently became the number one ranked tag team. As they were about to attack Schiavone post-match, Allin made the save; Sting was absent due to the previous week's attack. Allin criticized Matthew and Nicholas, stating they no longer cared about the original goal of AEW and only cared about themselves. Allin then accepted that he and Sting would defend the AEW World Tag Team Championship against The Young Bucks, which was scheduled as a tornado tag team match at Revolution.\nAt Worlds End on December 30, 2023, Adam Cole was revealed to be the man in the devil mask that had been targeting MJF over the prior few months. The devil's masked men were also revealed to be Roderick Strong, Matt Taven, Mike Bennett, and Wardlow. On the following episode of Dynamite, the group dubbed themselves the Undisputed Kingdom and laid out their goals, which included Strong capturing the AEW International Championship. Two weeks later, Strong, Bennett, and Taven confronted International Champion Orange Cassidy after his match. Cassidy offered to immediately defend the title against Strong, who denied and proposed that the match take place at Revolution, which was later made official.\nIn September 2023, Swerve Strickland and \"Hangman\" Adam Page entered into a feud which saw Strickland gain victories over Page in a singles match at WrestleDream in October and in a Texas Death match at Full Gear in November. After Samoa Joe won the AEW World Championship at Worlds End on December 30, he appeared at Dynamite: Homecoming on January 10, 2024; Strickland and Page were among those who confronted Joe and laid claim to the title. After Strickland and Page went undefeated through January and were placed first and second in the title contendership rankings, a match between the two was scheduled for the February 7 episode of Dynamite to determine who would challenge Joe at Revolution. Their match went to a 30-minute time limit draw; as a result, both men were declared number one contenders with Joe in turn scheduled to defend the AEW World Championship against both in a three-way match.\nOn the January 3 episode of Dynamite, former Total Nonstop Action Wrestling wrestler Deonna Purrazzo confronted \"Timeless\" Toni Storm's associate Mariah May, and officially announced that she was signed to AEW. Purrazzo then made her intentions clear that she was going after Storm's AEW Women's World Championship, talking about how they were friends when they started in wrestling together and even got matching ankle tattoos. Purrazzo then quickly moved up the rankings to become the number one contender to face Storm for the championship at Revolution.\nAt Worlds End, Eddie Kingston became the inaugural AEW Continental Champion, which also made him the Continental Crown Champion by holding the new title with his ROH World and NJPW Strong Openweight Championships. During the tournament itself, he defeated Bryan Danielson to secure his spot in the final. On the January 20 episode of Collision, Kingston teamed with Ortiz in a losing effort against Danielson and Claudio Castagnoli; after the match, Danielson spit in Kingston's face. Over the weeks, Danielson continued to show Kingston disrespect by flipping him off backstage or immediately coming out for his own matches whenever Kingston was celebrating his own victories, one of which was against Bryan Keith and led to Keith receiving an AEW contract. On the February 10 episode of Collision, Kingston challenged Danielson to a match at Revolution for the Continental Crown Championship, with an added stipulation that if Kingston won, Danielson would have to shake Kingston's hand out of respect.\nEvent\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ Other on-screen personnel\n!Role\n!Name\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" |Commentators\n|Excalibur\n|-\n|Nigel McGuinness\n|-\n|Taz\n|-\n|Tony Schiavone\n|-\n|Stokely Hathaway\n|-\n|Don Callis\n|-\n|Jim Ross\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Ring announcers\n|Justin Roberts\n|-\n|Dasha Gonzalez\n|-\n|rowspan=6|Referees\n|Aubrey Edwards\n|-\n|Bryce Remsburg\n|-\n|Paul Turner\n|-\n|Rick Knox\n|-\n|Stephon Smith\n|-\n|Brandon Martinez\n|-\n|Interviewer\n|Lexy Nair\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Pre-show hosts\n|Renee Paquette\n|-\n|RJ City\n|}\nPre-show\nThere were two matches that took place on the Revolution: Zero Hour pre-show.

The Greensboro Coliseum was chosen as the location for Sting's retirement match as it was where Sting faced Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at Clash of the Champions I in March 1988, which is considered to be the match that established Sting as a top wrestler in the industry.]]\nThe main event was Sting's retirement match, in which he and Darby Allin (accompanied by Ric Flair and Sting's sons, Garrett Borden and Steven Borden Jr.) defended the AEW World Tag Team Championship against The Young Bucks (Matthew Jackson and Nicholas Jackson) in a tornado tag team match. Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat served as the special guest timekeeper for the match, while Sting's sons were dressed up as two of his previous personas: Garrett as the red, white, and blue Surfer Sting (the same gear Sting wore when he defeated Flair for his first world title in 1990) and Steven as the red and black nWo Wolfpac Sting. Sting came out to one of his previous entrance songs, Metallica's \"Seek & Destroy\", which prompted a positive reaction from the audience, who also sang along to the song's chorus (\"Searching, seek & destroy!\"). Sting and Darby Allin also came out to Seek & Destroy at the previous year's All In event.\nIn the opening stages, Allin delivered a suicide dive to The Bucks. Allin and Sting then delivered stereo Stinger Splashes to The Bucks and Sting's sons, Garrett and Steven, also delivered Stinger Splashes to the Bucks.

Sting and Allin then delivered a military press slam/Coffin Drop combination to Matthew. Nicholas then performed a Falcon Arrow to Allin through a table off the stage. Sting attempted a Scorpion Death Drop, but Matthew escaped and delivered a superplex to him off the stage. The Bucks then performed a double powerbomb to Allin onto a ladder. Allin delivered a Code Red to Matthew and a Stundog Millionaire to Nicholas. Sting then set up two panes of glass on top of chairs. Allin then placed Nicholas on the glass panes and attempted to deliver a diving senton off a ladder to Nicholas through the glass on the chairs, but Matthew pulled Nicholas away and Allin crashed through the glass and chairs.\nIn the ring, Nicholas hit Sting with a low blow and powerbombed him through the table, but Sting got up and The Bucks tossed him through a glass pane. Matthew then delivered another low blow to Sting and a Scorpion Death Drop for a two count. Matthew attempted to collect the title belt to attack Sting with, but Steamboat thrusted his throat. The Bucks then delivered double superkicks to both Flair and Steamboat. Matthew then hit Sting with the title belt for a two count. The Bucks then delivered double superkicks to Sting, but Sting responded with a Scorpion Death Drop to Nicholas, but Matthew broke up the pin attempt. The Bucks then delivered the EVP Trigger to Sting for a nearfall. The Bucks performed another EVP Trigger to Sting for a one count. The Bucks delivered another double superkick to Sting and attempted the Tony Khan (TK) Driver, but Allin stopped it and threw Nicholas through a table. Sting delivered a Scorpion Death Drop to Matthew for a two count. Allin then hit a Coffin Drop to Matthew and Sting locked in the Scorpion Death Lock on Matthew, forcing Matthew to tap out, with Sting and Allin retaining the titles. As a result of this win, Sting retired undefeated in AEW as well as champion. The event ended with confetti showering over Sting and Allin as they posed with the belts, with Sting thanking Greensboro, Flair, and Allin as well as everyone else involved in the event.\nReception\nThe event received critical acclaim for its match quality and Sting's retirement, with the Ospreay-Takeshita bout singled out for notable praise.\nErik Beaston of Bleacher Report graded the show an A, saying \"There were two legitimate Match of the Year contenders here in Kingston vs. Danielson and Ospreay vs. Takeshita, and everything else ranged from good to great. Most importantly, the show was sold on the back of Sting's retirement match and the main event lived up to expectations. The greatest avenger in wrestling history once again thwarted the plans of the evil and unjust, sending fans home happy and bringing an end to his career. Everything that hit did, mostly, and the result was a great way to kick off the company's PPV slate here in 2024\".\nReviewing the event for 411MANIA, Thomas Hall generally praised the event, particularly the main event, the Ospreay-Takeshita bout, and the FTR/BCC match. He summed up the event as \"where the good was excellent, and the worst was still fine.\" Steve Cook, also writing for the same website, echoed Hall's praise, stating \"Sting got to go out on his own terms, as he should have. As long as that happened I was going to rate this show way too high for some people to handle.\" He noted that AEW still has some problems to sort out, but that \"this particular night went as well as possible.\"\nDave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter rated the ten-man tag match and the Statlander and Willow vs. Hart and Blue match 2 stars (the lowest rated matches on the card), the TNT Championship match 3.75 stars, the Continental Crown Championship match, the BCC&ndash;FTR bout and the main event AEW World Tag Team Championship match 4.75 stars, the All-Star Scramble 3.25 stars, The International Championship match 4 stars, the AEW Women's World Championship match 2.75 stars, the Ospreay-Takeshita match 5.75 stars (the highest rated match on the card), and the AEW World Championship triple threat match 4.5 stars.\nDuring the event, Allin performed a jump from a ladder to a glass panel. The spot was harshly criticized by PWInsider's Dave Scherer, pointing that \"AEW crossed a line that should never, ever be crossed\". Eric Bischoff also complained about the spot, stating that \"it didn't do anything at all for the match\". Tony Khan answered these complains, pointing the security and planification before the spot took place.\nAftermath\nDuring the post-event media scrum, AEW president Tony Khan announced that due to Sting's retirement, the AEW World Tag Team Championship was vacated and there would be a tournament to crown new champions. The tournament would culminate at Dynasty, where the Young Bucks would defeat FTR in a ladder match to hold the AEW World Tag Team Championships for a record-setting third time.\nOn the following episode of Dynamite, Wardlow was scheduled to receive his AEW World Championship match against Samoa Joe the following week at Dynamite: Big Business, where Joe retained.\nResults\n|match1 = The Bang Bang Scissor Gang (Max Caster, Anthony Bowens, Billy Gunn, Austin Gunn, Colten Gunn, and Jay White) defeated Jeff Jarrett, Satnam Singh, Jay Lethal, Willie Mack, and Private Party (Isiah Kassidy and Marq Quen) (with Sonjay Dutt and Karen Jarrett) by pinfall\n|stip1  = 12-man tag team match\n|time1  = 12:25\n|note1  = pre\n|match2 = Kris Statlander and Willow Nightingale defeated Julia Hart and Skye Blue by pinfall\n|stip2  = Tag team match\n|time2  = 13:30\n|note2  = pre\n|match3 = Christian Cage (c) (with Killswitch, Mother Wayne, and Nick Wayne) defeated Daniel Garcia by pinfall\n|stip3  = Singles match for the AEW TNT Championship\n|time3  = 16:50\n|match4 = Eddie Kingston (c) defeated Bryan Danielson by pinfall\n|stip4  = Singles match for the Continental Triple Crown Championship\n|time4  = 19:45\n|match5 = Wardlow (with Adam Cole, Mike Bennett, and Matt Taven) defeated Chris Jericho, Powerhouse Hobbs, Lance Archer (with Jake Roberts), Hook, Brian Cage (with Prince Nana), Magnus, and Dante Martin by pinfall\n|stip5  = All-Star Scramble match\n|time5  = 15:45\n|match6 = Roderick Strong defeated Orange Cassidy (c) by pinfall\n|stip6  = Singles match for the AEW International Championship\n|time6  = 12:45\n|match7 = Blackpool Combat Club (Jon Moxley and Claudio Castagnoli) defeated FTR (Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler) by technical submission\n|stip7  = Tag team match\n|time7  = 21:50\n|match8 = \"Timeless\" Toni Storm (c) (with Mariah May and Luther) defeated Deonna Purrazzo by pinfall\n|stip8  = Singles match for the AEW Women's World Championship\n|time8  = 12:15\n|match9 = Will Ospreay defeated Konosuke Takeshita by pinfall\n|stip9  = Singles match\n|time9  = 22:00\n|match10 = Samoa Joe (c) defeated \"Hangman\" Adam Page and Swerve Strickland (with Prince Nana) by submission\n|stip10  = Three-way match for the AEW World Championship\n|time10  = 19:40\n|match11 = Sting and Darby Allin (c) (with Ric Flair, Garrett Borden, and Steven Borden, Jr.) defeated The Young Bucks (Matthew Jackson and Nicholas Jackson) by submission\n|stip11  = Tornado tag team match for the AEW World Tag Team Championship\n|time11  = 21:03\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
