The examination covers the involvement of African Americans in conflicts with indigenous populations, the dynamics between African Americans and immigrants, and the U.S. government's concerns about the allegiance of African Americans. He also explores the heavy reliance of the U.S. on African American soldiers along the border and how this resulted in a struggle between white supremacy and national security.\nThe book is arranged chronologically into chapters, each looking at a different and progressive aspect of African American life along the border.\nReviews\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nCitation\n*\nAbout the author\nGerald Horne is Moores Professor of History and African American Studies at the University of Houston.\nSee also\n* Becoming Mexican American: Ethnicity, Culture, and Identity in Chicano Los Angeles, 1900-1945\n* Cannery Women, Cannery Lives: Mexican Women, Unionization, and the California Food Processing Industry, 1930-1950\nReferences\nNotes\nCitations\nExternal links\n* [https://nyupress.org/9780814736739/black-and-brown/ Book page at NYU Press]"
