By entering the question and answer of the test in Cram, the application presents the information in test or flashcard format, which then allows the user to study the entered information at any time.\nApart from the core functionality of Cram, other features of the application include the use of images and sound that are integrated on the flashcard and practice tests as they study and test database that allows the user to download and share tests with other users.\nCram also provides functions to study from an iPhone with flashcards and multiple-choice tests.\nCram is available as shareware, which will block itself after creating five tests with five questions each.\nSee also\n* List of flashcard software\nReferences\n*[http://www.softpedia.com/reviews/mac/Cram-Review-118724.shtml 'Cram - Study at the Speed of Light'], Softpedia, August 10, 2009\n*[http://cram.en.softonic.com/mac 'Enhance your knowledge and improve your studying'], Softonic, August 11, 2009\n*[http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-10057995-12.html 'Cram for tests on your iPhone'] , CNET, October 3, 2008\n*[http://mac.appstorm.net/reviews/cram-the-mac-study-assistant/ 'Cram: The Mac Study Assistant'] , Mac AppStorm, June 8, 2009"
