With a career spanning over three decades, Cararas has contributed to numerous projects across rock, pop, punk, metal, hip-hop, and country genres. He is known for his versatility in both studio and live performance settings.\nEarly life\nCararas developed an interest in music at the age of seven after discovering a Sears Silvertone guitar in his father's attic. As a teenager, he immersed himself in music, spending countless hours recording with a Teac 4-track tape recorder. By age 18, he was involved in various aspects of the music industry, including operating studios, teaching music, performing in bands, and working as a session musician.\nIn 1991, he and longtime friend Chris Randels relocated to Dallas, Texas, marking the beginning of Cararas's professional journey.\nEarly Career and New Orleans Period (1996–2005)\nIn 1996, Cararas relocated to New Orleans to establish his own recording studio. In May 1998, he found a temporary home at the historic Fontainebleau Hotel, which had recently been renovated by Cyril Neville into a music rehearsal facility. Cararas converted one of the rooms (once occupied by artists with whom he would later collaborate, Better Than Ezra) into a modest recording studio. Initially intended for his band's rehearsals and recordings, the studio soon attracted other musicians, allowing him to refine his skills as a producer and engineer.\nIn New Orleans, Cararas was a member of The Dispensers, an eccentric punk band known for its energetic live shows that blended rock, orchestral and avant-garde elements. His role as a guitarist contributed to the band's dynamic sound and local popularity.\nWhile in New Orleans, Cararas forged influential collaborations, including work with:\n* Cowboy Mouth\n* Juvenile, the hip-hop legend\n* Brian Wilson, of Beach Boys fame\n* Jhelisa, the soulful British singer\nStudio Ventures\nIn 2003, Cararas co-founded Truck Farm Studios with Danny Kadar, Trina Shoemaker, and Dave Pirner of Soul Asylum. Managed by former Kingsway Studio manager Karen Brady, this studio served local and touring musicians, providing a space for collaboration and recordings.\nParadigm Park Studios: In 2004 Cararas and Kadar established this studio in New Orleans, further cementing his role in the city's vibrant music scene by providing recording, mixing, and production services to a variety of artists. The studio was located in a newly constructed building initially intended to house the official Grammy Museum. After funding for the project was lost, the building was sold to local mastering and audio forensics engineer Parker Dinkins. Dinkins hired venerable studio designer, Vincent Van Haaff to design the studio. Located at 600 N Carrollton Ave. in the City Park area of New Orleans, the studio building fell victim to Hurricane Katrina.\nIn November 2005, after leaving New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, Cararas partnered with Brian Yaskulka at the notable 7th Productions recording studios, located in historic Security Trust and Savings on 6381 Hollywood Blvd, from 2005 to 2013. The building also was host to legendary producers and artists, John Rzeznik, Glen Ballard and Dave Stewart.\nDuring his time in New Orleans Cararas had collaborations with Cowboy Mouth, Juvenile, Brian Wilson, and Jhelisa.\nIn 2005, after Juvenile left Cash Money Records to sign a lucrative deal with Atlantic Records, Cararas was contacted by label president Mike Caren to work with Juvenile on his new album 'Reality Check'. 'Who's Your Daddy', 'Stick Fork' and several other unreleased songs were born from this time.\nTransition to Los Angeles (2005-Present)\nThe devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 prompted Cararas to move to Los Angeles. There, he developed a co-op 7th Level Productions Studios with Brian Yaskulka and became a producer at Central Command Studios. In LA, he expanded his portfolio, working on projects for film, television, and various artists.\nIn 2010, Cararas produced a cover of Ozzy Osbourne's 'Goodbye to Romance' with Alex Mercier, released on Jack Osbourne's\nSchweet Records. Later that year, Cararas co-wrote the main theme song with Brett Boyett for the Jack Osbourne-produced reality show, Alpha Dogs. The song was originally intended for Ozzy to perform; however, health concerns and his commitment to the production of the Black Sabbath album \"13\"  prevented him from completing the track. The original demo vocalist stepped in to complete the recording for the show.\nIn 2011 his friendship with composer and Cinderella drummer Fred Coury led to them creating in-game music for the LA Kings hockey team alongside fellow collaborator Peter Amato. A video for the song produced by Cararas, 'We Salute You' was created by renowned videographer Mike Savage to honor the first responders and healthcare workers at the height of the COVID-19 era.\nDuring the same years he produced Nick Lachey's 'Last One Standing', the fight song for the Cincinnati Bearcats during the 2011 Big East tournament. The track served as an anthem for the team's competitive spirit.\nIn 2011, at the request of industry legend and then manager Lisa Roy, Stewart mastered the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards compilation album featuring Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga, Paramore, Bruno Mars, Rihanna, John Mayer, etc.\nCararas' production partnership with Jason Charles Miller has yielded numerous projects across various genres. Among their most recognized collaborations is their work on Billy Ray Cyrus's 2016 album Thin Line, where they co-produced seven tracks. The album reached No. 49 on the Billboard Country Albums chart. One of the standout tracks, a cover of the classic 'Tulsa Time,' was later remixed to feature Noah Cyrus and included on Cyrus's follow-up album Set the Record Straight (2017).\nBeyond their work with Cyrus, Cararas and Miller have collaborated with multiple artists in songwriting and production roles. Their track 'Reckless' was featured on the soundtrack of the MX vs. ATV All Out video game franchise, and their song 'Pray for Me'—alongside Brett Boyett—was used in the reality television series Deadliest Catch.\nIn 2016, Stewart co-wrote the song 'Old Scarecrow' for Jason Charles Miller's album \"In the Wasteland\", featuring Charlie Starr. Stewart was responsible for writing the original guitar riff that first introduced the song that inspired a new version later released on BlackBerry Smoke's album 'You Hear Georgia'. The song was co-written by Cararas, Miller, Charlie Starr of Blackberry Smoke, and Rickey Medlocke of Lynyrd Skynyrd.\nStewart's participation in the gaming world includes collaborations with Bardic Inspiration, Legends of the Multiverse, Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms, People of Note, Critical Role, and mixing the  'Close in the Distance' live-band version from Final Fantasy XIV.\nIn 2020, Have and the Have Nots, featuring Cararas, Sam Koltun (Faster Pussycat, Godsmack, Dorothy), Johnny Martin (LA Guns) and Alex Kane (Life, Sex and Death) is a band that emerged during the COVID lockdown in Los Angeles creating metal mashups of traditional holiday songs with other thematic, metal songs. Featured guests have included 80's pop star, Tiffany and Warrant vocalist, Robert Mason.\nIn 2023 Cararas produced 'The Dread' for George Lynch's project, The Banishment's debut album featuring Jason Charles Miller. The album marked a departure from Lynch's signature style, known for his work with Dokken and Lynch Mob. Instead this album explored darker, socio-political themes with a more aggressive, industrial-metal approach.\nCararas's long friendship and collaborations with Frankie Clarke and Frankie and the Studs have resulted in cowriting many songs and producing music including 'The Naughty List' for Rodney Bingenheimer and the 2025 debut album,  'Life's a Glitch' and singles: 'Bimini', 'Monster', 'Not This Time', 'Losing You', 'Headrush', 'Here I Lie', as well as the non-album single, 'Drain Me'. The album, produced by Gilby Clarke, also includes a cover of the Shocking Blue song 'Venus', featuring vocals from Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong.\nReturn to Live Performance\nIn 2024, Cararas returned to the stage serving as a guitarist for the Burton C. Bell's solo band, formerly of Fear Factory. Bell performed the first concert with his solo band on June 13, 2024, at 1720 in Los Angeles, California. The show included new interpretations of songs spanning Bells's career.\nSetlist for this showcase:\n*  Anti-Droid (live debut)\n*  Dog Day Sunrise\n*  Drive Boy, Shooting\n*  Technical Exorcism (live debut)\n*  Ghost Heart\n*  Descent\n*  Du hast\n*  Replica\n*  Scapegoat\nCararas also co-produced and mixed the single 'Technical Exorcism' with Burton C.
