The name of the title was changed to Hero of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic in 1960. It was awarded 31 times to some Czechoslovak war heroes, to the general and later president Ludvík Svoboda, to the Czechoslovak president Gustáv Husák, to the Czech cosmonaut Vladimír Remek, to various Soviet generals and marshals, and to Leonid Brezhnev. The never-awarded 32nd medal has been given to the Czech National Museum.\nThe title was awarded by the government to honor extraordinary merits for the republic connected with a heroic achievement or repeated achievements.\nThe Hero was always also awarded the Order of Klement Gottwald in similar fashion to how a Hero of the Soviet Union was also always awarded the Order of Lenin, a Hero of the People's Republic of Bulgaria was also awarded the Order of Georgi Dimitrov, and a Hero of the German Democratic Republic was also awarded the Order of Karl Marx.\nThe medal was worn on the left breast side above all the Czechoslovak awards or their ribbons, always in natura and in front of the Gold Star of the .\nThe title was canceled as a result of the 1989 Velvet Revolution, when the government of the new Czech and Slovak Federative Republic on 7 October 1990 enacted a law setting up a new, de-communized honors system. No new awards of the title have been permitted thenceforth, but existing awardees were (and are) still permitted to wear their medals.\nRecipients\n*Josef Frank\n*Gustáv Husák (3 times)\n*Ludvík Svoboda (3 times)\n*Vladimír Remek\n*Jan Šverma\n*Vendelín Opatrný\n*Karol Šmidke\n*Vladimír Clementis\n*Leonid Iljich Brezhnev (3 times)\n*Ivan Stepanovich Konev\n*Karel Klapálek\n*Andrei Antonovich Grechko\n*Ivan Ignatevich Jakubovski\n*Dmitriy Fjodorovich Ustinov\n*Matvej Vasiljevich Zacharov\n*Jurij Viktorovich Romanenko\n*Georgi Michajlovich Grechko\n*Alexei Alexandrovich Gubarev\n*Kiril Semjonovich Moskalenko\n*Andrey Yeryomenko\n*Dmitriy Danilovich Leljusenko\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.vyznamenani.net/?page_id=17 Gold Star of the Hero of Czechoslovak Socialist Republic] (in  Czech with pictures)"
