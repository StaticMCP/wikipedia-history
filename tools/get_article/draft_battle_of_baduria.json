The Muslims reciprocated but the melee remained inconclusive; complaints were filed at the Baduria police station by both sides and eventually, the subdivisional magistrate of Barasat dismissed the issue but only after getting a declaration from the peasants about committing to peace.\nBuoyed up by the lack of any punishment for Krishnadeva, fellow Zamindars — Ramnarayan Nag Chaudhuri of Taragonia and Guru Prasad Chowdhury of Nagarpur — instituted similar tax-regime on their subjects and imprisoned dissenters. The peasants organised themselves and sued the Zamindars but to little avail. This led Titu to advocate for a full-fledged armed resistance against what he felt to be the nexus of Zamindars and Company; Atis Dasgupta, a scholar of peasant rebellions in early colonial India, notes that here onward, what was essentially a socio-religious agitation against misrule of Hindu zamindars morphed into a political-economic class-struggle against British rule.\nConfrontations with the Company and Zamindars\nTitumir shifted his base from Chandpur to Narikelberia, and began organizing an armed militia. In October 1830, one of his declarations proclaimed him to be the natural sovereign of the country, who — rather than the Company — had a unilateral right of remittance on local revenues collected by zamindars; a Muslim landholder was raided in the same month for having disobeyed him.\nOn 31 October, Titumir set out to avenge a Bengali Hindu zamindar called Krishnadeva along with 300 armed followers; his residence was ransacked, establishments of Hindu moneylenders in the local market were set on fire, and a cow was slaughtered in front of a Hindu temple in an act of desecration to avenge the previously mentioned demolition of the mosque. In response, the Hindu zamindars, outraged at the inflammatory activities of the Muslims formed an alliance with the British indigo planters to render mutual assistance in case of assaults by Titumir's militia. Soon Kaliprasanna Mukherjee, the zamindar of Habra-Gobardanga and a key member of the alliance, was targeted and though Davies, manager of a nearby plantation at Mollahati, came to aid with about 200 men, they were soundly defeated. Davies escaped narrowly and was sheltered by Debnath Roy, the zamindar of Gobra-Gobindapur; this precipitated a confrontation between Titumir's militia and Debnath's forces at Laughati in Nadia, where the latter was killed. Several Indigo plantations were subsequently set on fire.\nThe month of November was replete with such cases and the local police proved to be of little use in the face of increasing peasant resistance; many of the Zamindars fled to Kolkata. The Commissioner of the Presidency Division was solicited to tackle the situation, and accordingly, on 15 November 1830, Alexander, the Joint Magistrate of Barasat — along with Ramram Chakraborti, Officer-In-Charge of Baduria Thana — set out for Titumir with a force of 120 policemen. Outnumbered by a 500-strong militia, they were defeated; Alexander barely escaped to a neighboring village while Ramram perished alongside 14 others.\nReferences"
