It is a Grade II listed building. It is now used an arts and community centre called Kingswood Arts.\nIn 1811 William Vizard, the solicitor to Caroline of Brunswick in her future failed divorce from George IV, was granted a 63-year lease for Kingswood Lodge. When Vizard returned to his native Gloucestershire in 1831, others were granted the property leases.\nFrom 1891 the house was owned by John Lawson Johnston (inventor of Bovril) who extended the house and remodelled the facade including adding battlements. Johnston acquired the nickname Mr Bovril and because of its castellated features Kingswood became known locally as Bovril Castle. Some remaining garden features from this era are thought to have been installed by James Pulham and Son.\nIn the First World War Kingswood was used as a convalescent home for wounded Canadian soldiers. At this time it came to the notice of Lady Vestey who was doing social work in connection with the soldiers housed there. In 1919 her husband Sir William Vestey was granted an 80-year lease and in 1921 when he was raised to the peerage he became Baron Vestey of Kingswood in the County of Surrey. Kingswood was the Vesteys' main home until William's death.\n(centre), 24 May 1917.

Lord Vestey's estate had by then been developed into a large residential area, with the grounds occupied by houses, flats and shops. In 1965 it became the property of the London Borough of Southwark. It underwent substantial refurbishment in the 1980s and 1990s, and was subsequently used for conferences, meetings and civil marriages.\nIn the grounds in front of Kingswood House there are still some remains of the Pulham features. In 2005 a tapestry was made by over 100 local residents depicting the history of the house. In 2011 a blue plaque was erected on the side of the building to commemorate John Lawson Johnston and his residence there.\nLibrary\nFrom 1956 to 2020, whilst run as a public building by the local council, the house housed a public library. An opening ceremony was hosted by actor Peter Ustinov and the then Camberwell mayor Alderman John Evans, who used the opportunity of the library to read up on Ustinov, saying: \"I looked up 'Who’s Who' and anyone who wants to know something about our distinguished visitor can find it in the library.\"\nIt was remarked at the ceremony that the house was now \"as it should be\", for the community and \"not something reserved for one select and privileged family\".\nIn the 1960s, the house was used to store the then Camberwell borough's library service reserve stock collection.\nIn 1993 the library was threatened with closure, with the suggestion that it could move into a space at the Seeley Drive shops. The community ran a Save the Library campaign, gathering 720 signatures in a petition.\nBetween 2014 and 2019 the library's funding was cut to nearly half, from £23,885 to £12,618. The library in the house closed in 2020 at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2023, a new Kingswood Library opened opposite the house at a shop unit on Seeley Drive.\nPresent day\nIn 2022, [https://www.kingswoodarts.com/ Kingswood Arts] ( a CIC subsidiary of Hartshorn Hook Enterprises) took over the venue as an arts centre. The whole building has now been restored and opened to the public as a performing arts centre, with a cafe and regular events, starting from April 2023.\nReferences\nExternal links\nhttp://www.fokwh.co.uk Friends of Kingswood House website]\n* [https://www.kingswoodarts.com/ Kingswood Arts]\nKingswood Arts website\nFurther reading\n* Patrick Darby, Kingswood: A History of the House and its Estate (Dulwich Society, 1999)"
