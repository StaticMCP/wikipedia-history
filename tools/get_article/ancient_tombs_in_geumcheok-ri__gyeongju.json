On January 21, 1963, they were designated Historic Site of South Korea No. 43.\nThe site has 52 tumulus tombs of various sizes. Most of them are round mounds, but one has two round mounds that are connected to each other. They are consistently smaller than the tombs at Daereungwon. Many of them have yet to be excavated. Two of them that were partially destroyed were excavated in 1952, and gold and jade artifacts were recovered. In 1976, small tombs of the complex were discovered for the first time. In 1981, several tombs that were unknowingly destroyed during the construction of a private house were excavated. They are believed to house various lower-level nobles of Silla.\nReferences"
