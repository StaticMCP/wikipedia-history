He also built his home and established a post office. He is believed to have named the area Drayton after Drayton, Somersetshire, England, where his father Charles Alford was the vicar.\nDrayton continued to be the primary settlement in the region until the town of Toowoomba was established four miles to the north-east, whereupon the centre of population rapidly moved to the newer settlement owing to its better access to water and favourable growing conditions. By 1905, the Australian Handbook stated that the town \"may now almost be considered a suburb of Toowoomba\".\nThe Drayton National School (later Drayton State School) established on 16 August 1851. It is one of the oldest state primary schools in Queensland.\nOne of the oldest buildings in the Drayton area is the Royal Bull's Head Inn.
