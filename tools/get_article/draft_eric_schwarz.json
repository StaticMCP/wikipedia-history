Based in Boston, MA, Schwarz has spent his life challenging education systems to provide more experience and value for students. Schwarz has authored or co-authored several books on the state of education in America and what nonprofits, such as Citizen Schools and CFSI, can do to uplift otherwise disadvantaged youth. Eric led the development of Citizen Schools to be responsive to changing educational needs, wants, and to address a growing opportunity gap between low-income students and their wealthier peers.\nEarly Life\nEric’s father, Fritz Schwarz, a Harvard Law School graduate, was a successful corporate lawyer and successor of the FAO Schwarz family in New York City. Eric’s mother, Marian Lapsley Cross, was a descendant of Quaker activists and New England businessmen and taught English at Benjamin Franklin High School in East Harlem. Marian continued her education to get a PhD in linguistics, while Fritz joined the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore. Schwarz has two sisters, Adair and Eliza Schwarz.\nWhen Eric approached nursery school age, his parents and their friends started the West Side Montessori School. It was the “first school in the city to include both low-income students with public subsidies and full-paying families like ours”.\nEducation\nSchwarz attended the University of Vermont, earning his B.A in History and Political Science in 1983, after a gap semester working for U.S Senator Gary Hart during his senate re-election campaign in the Fall of 1980. Schwarz began working full-time for Hart during his last semester at UVM, serving as the national student director for Hart's 1984 Presidential run. Schwarz attributes his desire to provide experiential learning and internship opportunities to his time working with Senator Hart.\nCareer\nSenator Gary Hart\nSchwarz interned with Senator Gary Hart during his 1984 Presidential run, where he states he started out doing tasks such as mowing lawns and penny-counting, but quickly rose to lead voter outreach efforts on college campuses in Vermont. Schwarz took a gap semester from UVM after this summer internship to continue working with Senator Hart as the National Student Director.\nCity Year\nSchwarz served as the Executive Director at City Year from 1990-1994.\nCitizen Schools\nSchwarz began his career in the nonprofit sector by cofounding the educational nonprofit Citizen Schools in 1995 with Ned Rimer, with the core belief that everyone in a community should be involved in education, not just parents and teachers. Citizen Schools engaged volunteers from all aspects of life, from chemists, NASA scientists, bankers, and even home sewers, mentors educate and connect with middle schoolers to provide career advice, support, and community.\nSince its inception, Citizen Schools has engaged over 50,000 students, 17,000 volunteers, and partnered with 650 educators nationwide, all collaborating to transform the educational model into one that provides opportunities for all students. Citizen Schools was awarded Fast Company magazine’s Social Capitalist Award in 2004, 2006, 2007, and 2008, and the Skoll Foundation’s Skoll Award in Social Entrepreneurship in 2005.\nCollege for Social Innovation\nSchwarz is the co-founder and CEO of College for Social Innovation (CFSI), a nonprofit located in Boston, Massachusetts, that provides college-aged students with internship experiences in the social impact sector. The organization provides internships through two programs, Semester in the City and Semester for Impact. Schwarz has been continuously vocal about the need for Colleges and Universities to provide a more substantial and impactful education to students by providing hands-on and experiential learning experiences, such as internships or co-ops. Schwarz largely attributes his drive and interest in education to his own internship experience with Senator Gary Hart.\nCFSI partners with several colleges and universities in the New England area, including the University of New Hampshire, Colby College, and the University of Vermont.\nReferences"
