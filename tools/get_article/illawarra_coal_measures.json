This stratum is up to 150 metres thick. Formed in the Late Permian, it comprises shale, quartz-lithic sandstone, conglomerate rocks, and chert, with sporadically carbonaceous mudstone, coal and seams of torbanite. Coal mining of these measures remains a significant commercial enterprise to the present day. One of the abandoned coal mines in the Blue Mountains is now a tourist attraction.\nSee also\n* Sydney Basin\n* Hawkesbury sandstone\n* Mittagong Formation\n* Ashfield Shale\n* Narrabeen group\nReferences"
