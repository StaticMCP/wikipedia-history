National referendums are very rare as there are no provisions concerning referendums in the Constitution of the Czech Republic, except for \"referendum concerning the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union\" and the only national referendum in the Czech Republic was 2003 Czech European Union membership referendum. Local referendums are most common. As of 27 February 2018 there has been 269 local referendums since 2006. There hasn't been any regional referendum in the Czech Republic so far.\nList\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Date !! Topic !! Level !!
