This was the first large-scale strategic bombing during World War II and the first attack on the German interior - it inflicted little damage. Just 24 of 96 bombers dispatched to Ruhr Area power stations and refineries found the target area, setting several oil plants on fire.\n|-\n|\n| Oil installations in Ruhr\n|  6 Handley Page Hampden and 6 Vickers Wellington bombers attacked Ruhr oil targets.\n|-\n|\n| Hamburg-Harburg\n|  48 Hampdens attacked Hamburg oil installations.\n|-\n|\n| Bremen\n|  24 Armstrong Whitworth Whitley bombers attacked Bremen oil installations.\n|-\n|\n| \"Oil refineries\"\n|  24 Wellington, 24 Whitleys, and 12 Hampdens attacked oil refineries and railways in Germany and troops in Belgium.\n|-\n|\n| Leipzig/Leuna\n|  35 Hampdens were recalled due to bad weather, but one failed to receive the recall and bombed the Leuna oil refinery, 30 miles west of Leipzig.\n|-\n|\n| Bremen\n|  Hampdens bombed oil refineries near Bremen. In the course of the raid, a tail gunner on a No. 10 Squadron RAF Whitley shot down the first German fighter by the RAF in World War II.\n|-\n|\n| Hamburg-Harburg refineries\n|  Hampdens attacked oil refineries near Hamburg.\n|-\n|\n| Bremen\n|  The Bremen oil refinery was bombed.\n|-\n|\n| Hamburg-Harburg refineries\n|  Hamburg oil refineries were bombed.\n|-\n|\n| oil targets\n|  24 Whitleys and 6 Hampdens bombed \"oil and communication targets in Germany\".\n|-\n|\n| Frankfurt oil depot\n|  The Frankfurt oil depot was attacked with 400 bombs.\n*\n*\n*\n*  Frankfurt also had a Naxos Union grinding wheel plant.\n|-\n|\n| Leipzig/Leuna\n|  Leuna bombed.\n|-\n|\n|  Chiefs of Staff\n| The Future Strategy report predicted \"Germany's oil stocks might be exhausted--and Germany's situation disastrous--by June 1941.\"\n|-\n|\n|  Antwerp\n|  43 Wellingtons bombed an oil depot near Antwerp.

On July 10, Hermann Göring had met with experts on how to repair the Russian Maykop oil facilities (Germany also reassembled an oil facility in Kherson, in Ukraine). and Nazi Germany began occupation in August.\n|-\n|\n|  Bucharest\n|  The VVS bombed the oil installations.\n|-\n|\n|  Ploiești\n|  The Soviet Union's VVS bombed the oil installations.\n|-\n|\n|\n| The US \"Enemy Oil Committee\" was established as a counterpart to the British \"Technical Sub-Committee on Axis Oil\" (Hartley Committee).\n|-\n|\n|  Hartley Committee\n| The Axis Oil Position in Europe, November 1942 estimated that Romanian oil fields contribute 33% of Axis supplies.\n|-\n|\n|   Joint Intelligence Subcommittee\n| The German Strategy in 1943 predicted Nazi Germany will have increased domestic oil supplies in mid-1943.\n|-\n|\n|\n| A German armoured column within 30 miles of the Soviet Sixth Army near Stalingrad had to retreat due to having fuel for only 15 miles. At his HQ company Christmas party, Erwin Rommel received a miniature oil drum as a gift (containing captured British coffee).\n|-\n|\n|  C/AS Management Control\n| After Hap Arnold created the United States Army Air Forces Committee for Operations Analysis (COA) on December 9, 1942,[https://books.google.com/books?id=rVVeO4B985wC&pg=PA11] to develop a plan for strategic bombing, the COA's initial Western Axis Oil Industry report listed the following order of strategic importance: hydrogenation facilities (15 plants), refineries (29 plants), lubrication plants, coker units, Fischer-Tropsch facilities, tetraethyllead facilities, and oilfields/pipelines.\n|-\n|\n|\n| The Axis Oil Position (C.C.S. 158) at the Allied Casablanca Conference identified it would be \"remote\" for Nazi Germany to retain the Maikop oil fields. However, \"even if the whole of the Romanian production were knocked out early in the year, [Germany] would still have enough for operations in 1944 [but the destruction of] two tetraethyllead factories… would hamstring the production of German aviation fuel\" (Brehon Somervell). Nazi Germany destroyed the Maikop facilities prior to withdrawing.\n|-\n|\n|   Combined Chiefs of Staff\n| C.C.S. 166/1/D identified oil facilities as the 4th bombing priority.\n|-\n|\n|  C/AS Management Control\n| The COA's comprehensive plan identified the strategic bombing objective was to \"bring about a high degree of destruction in a few really essential industries than to dissipate bombing efforts over a large number of targets [in] many industries.\" 19 vital industries were identified: Petroleum was 3rd (39 targets), \"Synthetic rubber and rubber tires\" were 6th (12 targets) and \"Coking plants\" were 10th (89 targets). In particular, destruction of 13 hydrogenation plants and 12 Ploesti refineries would reduce \"German petroleum resources\" by 90%.\n|-\n|\n|\n| \"We must, therefore, apply [bombardment] to those specially selected and vital targets which will give the greatest return.\" (Arnold to Carl Spaatz)\n: AAFRH-3:  (p. vii: Arnold to Spaatz, April 10, 1943)\n: AAFRH-10:  (p. 84)\n: AAFRH-18:\n: AAFRH-19:  (available at the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library in the \"Collection of 20th Century Military Records, 1918-1950 Series I\"; Historical Studies Box 35).\n: AAFRH-22:  (also available in Box 35)\n|-\n|\n| Pölitz\n| 339 bombers attacked the Stettin railyards, the Pölitz oil refinery, and Swinemünde. The Pölitz synthetic oil plant had been added to the Area Bombing Directive on February 14, 1942 (one day before it was issued), and a subcamp of Sachsenhausen near Pölitz provided forced labor.\n|-\n|\n|   CCS\n| The CBO \"Eaker\" plan was approved and confirmed oil targets as the 4th primary objective (\"contingent upon attacks against Ploesti\").\n|-\n|\n| Bochum benzene plant\n|  Battle of the Ruhr bombings of the Bochum coal-producing center northwest of Essen damaged its \"extensive coke, gas, benzol, and iron, and steel plants.\" In 1943, the 466th bombed Bochum targets on March 29, May 13, October 9, and November 4. After a 92 BG mission to Bochum on August 12, 1943, 342 RAF aircraft also accurately bombed Bochum on September 29/30, 1943 when the German radar controller mistakenly directed fighters to Bremen, 150 miles away.\n|-\n|\n|  Ploiești\n| The Advisory Council submitted the Air Attack on Ploesti (\"SOAPSUDS\") bombardment plan, which the Trident Conference subsequently considered. On June 6 the plan was deemed \"an important and desirable operation\", and the \"Planning committee\" first met on June 25 (Uzal Girard Ent predicted losses of 75 aircraft). Training began on July 20/22 and ended July 29.\n|-\n|\n|  Bari\n| Wellingtons of the Northwest African Strategic Air Force bombed the \"Bari, Italy oil refinery\".\n|-\n|\n| Gelsenkirchen (Nordstern)\n|  At the end of the first phase of the Combined Bomber Offensive, during the Battle of the Ruhr 473 aircraft unsuccessfully bombed Gelsenkirchen due to cloud and failure of Oboe equipment.\n|-\n|\n| Gelsenkirchen (Nordstern)\n|  In one of the last large raids of the Battle of the Ruhr, 418 aircraft unsuccessfully  - due to misplaced marking - attacked Gelsenkirchen.\n|-\n|\n|  Brazi\n|  Operation Tidal Wave bombed the Creditul Minier refinery in Brazi.\n|-\n|\n|  Câmpina\n|   Operation Tidal Wave bombed the Steaua Română refinery in Câmpina.\n|-\n|\n|  Ploiești\n|  Operation Tidal Wave bombed the Astra Română, Columbia Aquila, and Unirea Orion refineries at Ploiești (four Medals of Honor were awarded for the US Bomber pilots and four Order of Bravery to the Bulgarian fighter pilots to shoot them down)\n|-\n|\n|  Ploiești\n|  Operation Tidal Wave bombed the Astra Română and Concordia Vega refineries at Ploiești (one Medal of Honor was awarded). The Enemy Oil Committee subsequently appraised that Operation Tidal Wave bomb damage at Ploiești caused \"no curtailment of overall product output\".\n|-\n|\n| Bochum\n|  Diverting from the Gelsenkirchen target, B-17 \"Ain't It Gruesome\" bombed Bochum. An unexploded 20&nbsp;mm shell struck the boot of Captain Clark Gable, a gunnery observer on his third operational flight Gable's footage is in the FMPU's propaganda film Combat America.\n|-\n|\n| Recklinghausen\n|  183 B-17's are dispatched to synthetic oil installations at Bochum, Gelsenkirchen and Recklinghausen\n|-\n|\n| Gelsenkirchen\n|  The 384 BG bombed the Gelsenkirchen \"oil refinery\".\n|-\n|\n| Gelsenkirchen\n|  Mission 121: 229 of 323 B-17s bombed 495 tons on the marshalling yard and oil plants.\n|-\n|\n| Gelsenkirchen (Scholven/Buer)\n| 96 of 328 B-17s bombed 238 tons on the \"Hydrier Werke Scholven A.G.\" (damaged) and the Gelsenkirchener Bergwerke (missed). Gelsenkirchener Bergwerke plants were also at Duisburg-Hamborn (BRUCKHAUSEN Benzol Plant) and Dortmund. A Gelsenkirchen target was also attacked on November 19, and Gelsenkirchen Mission 134 on November 19 was rerouted to bomb the German-Dutch border due to malfunctioning blind-bombing PFF equipment in bad weather.\n|-\n|\n|  Hartley Committee\n| \"losses of oil stocks … caused by Allied attacks during the first eight months of 1943 [were] 400,000 tons. … Approximately 75 per cent of Roumanian crude is a waxy, viscous oil which becomes solid at temperatures below 69\" degrees (J.I.C (43) 480).\n|-\n|\n| Ludwigshafen–Oppau\n| The 351 BG bombed the explosives factory at Oppau. Prior to May 1944, explosives production was 99,000 metric tons/month, but in December 1944, the amount had dropped to 20,500; and after October 1944, German explosives were 20% rock salt. The Mannheim-Ludwigshafen area was bombed in late 1943 to prevent recovery from previous bomb damage. The Mannheim aircraft plant was bombed on October 19, 1944, and Mannheim had a Daimler Benz truck plant.\n|-\n|\n| Ludwigshafen\n| 1,000 tons of bombs dropped on Ludwigshafen, and the 447 BG bombed the Ludwigshafen oil refinery. In addition to the nearby Oppau plants, Ludwigshafen targets included a small synthetic oil plant and an oil refinery that used the dehydrogenation process to improve \"gasoline quality\". Dr. Wurster of the Ludwigshafen Military Government was the \"managing director of Oppau and Ludwigshafen.\" Ludwigshafen targets were subsequently bombed by the 8AF on March 2, March 31, and May 27.\n|-\n|\n|  Fiume\n| The 317 BS bombed the oil refinery. Circa January 1944, the Enemy Oil Committee identified that Italian refining had ceased in August 1943. Italian refineries were at Fiume (Ramsa plant), La Spezia, Leghorn, Trieste (Aquila & SIAF plants), and Venice.\n|-\n|\n|\n|  Budapest, Sofia, Bucharest, and Vienna were identified as second priority objectives for 15AF \"area attack\".\n|-\n|\n|\n| \"To reduce output … to virtually zero in the six months following 1 March requires the destruction of 23 synthetic plants (about 3.3 million tons) and 31 refineries (about 3.7 million tons) [which] currently account for over 90 per cent of total Axis refinery and synthetic oil output\" (Plan for Completion of Combined Bomber Offensive). The \"German oil situation is extremely vulnerable to the scale of attack contemplated, and that the results of any appreciable damage to production would be disastrous.\" (US Petroleum Attache, March 6).\n|-\n|\n|   SHAEF\n| Although Spaatz's claimed \"''We believe attacks on transportation will not force the German fighters into action. We believe they will defend oil to their last fighter plane',\n:\n: 1943-12-27:  (quoted by Mets note 51, pp. 191,383)\n: 1944-02-03:\n: 1944-01-21:\n: 1944-02-15''':\n:: Col. Richard D.

Portal had tried to move Harris away from area bombing to join in the attacks on oil. ... the recommendation that emerged was a gigantic attack on Berlin\")\n: 1944-09-23:  became the secondary priorities. (quoted by Mets note 23, pp. 260,393)\nDwight D. Eisenhower decided that \"apart from the attack on the GAF,[German air force] the transportation plan was the only one which offered a reasonable chance of the air forces making an important contribution to the land battle during the first vital weeks of OVERLORD\". Control of all air operations was transferred to Eisenhower on April 14 at noon.\n|-\n|\n|  Ploiești\n|  230 bombers bombed Ploiești for the 1st time in 8 months, beginning the \"1944 Ploesti Campaign\" (April 5-August 19: 5,674 sorties, 13,559 bomb tons, 254 aircraft lost). The 5th BW and 47th BW bombed the Ploeşti marshalling yards and adjacent oil facilities, and the 451 BG bombed the Ploiești oil refineries and marshalling yard [http://libraryautomation.com/nymas/usaaf7.html]  (marshalling yards were next to an oil plant.) The Ploeşti marshalling yards were bombed on April 15 by the 15th AF and on April 24, by the 32nd BS, when the first use of the \"Mickey\" (H2X radar) was against Ploeşti.\n|-\n|\n|\n| Bad winter weather had reduced Wehrmacht fuel consumption, and Luftwaffe fuel supplies were 574,000 tonnes. \"Whereas in 1939 our hydrogenation plants were producing 2 million metric tons equivalent of petroleum (including automobile fuel), the construction of new facilities up to 1943 provided an increase to 5.7 million metric tons, and the facilities scheduled for this year will raise the yearly output to 7.1 million metric tons.\" (Albert Speer to Adolf Hitler).\n|-\n|\n|  Ploiești\n|  34 B-24s of the 450 BG targeted the marshalling yards and bombed the \"Vega Oil Refinery\".\n|-\n|\n| Salzbergen synthetic oil plant\n|  The \"Hydrierwerke Salzbergen\" was attacked.\n|-\n|\n|\n| By May 1944, only 1.1% of Allied bombs had been used on oil targets.\n|-\n|\n|  Ploiești\n|  The marshalling yards and oil refineries were bombed. B-24s also bombed the Braşov450 BG & Ploiești marshalling yards on May 6.\n|-\n|\n| Bruges, Belgium\n|  12 Bostons achieved near misses at an oil depot at Bruges.\n|-\n|\n| Leipzig/Böhlen\n|  Mission 353 was the 1st trial raid on oil targets to test the claim that the Luftwaffe would defend oil targets in Germany more than they had defended transportation targets. RLV fighters put up their largest force ever, but five synthetic oil plants were successfully attacked with 1,718 tons of bombs. A diversionary raid made on the Zwickau aircraft depot faced 200 Luftwaffe fighters\n|-\n|\n| Merseburg\n|  Mission 353: The 384 BG bombed Merseburg.\n|-\n|\n| Lützkendorf\n|  Mission 353: 87 planes hit oil facilities at Lützkendorf near Leipzig, which had a small Wintershall crude oil refinery (100,000 tons/yr), a hydrogenation unit for blending gasolines, and a Fischer-Tropsch plant to process heavier gasoline cuts from synthesized oil. Plants were at .\n|-\n|\n| Zeitz\n|  Mission 353\n|-\n|\n| Brüx, Czechoslovakia\n|  Mission 353 bombed Brüx. On December 15, 1942, Sudetenländische Treibstoffwerke AG (STW) had begun output of synthesized fuel from brown coal () at the Maltheuren plant at Brüx.\n|-\n|\n|  Bad Zwischenahn, Germany\n|  First combat test flights of the Messerschmitt Me 163B rocket-powered interceptor fighter by Erprobungskommando 16, intended for defense of petroleum/oil/lubricants industry targets.\n|-\n|\n|  Ploiești (Concordia Vega)\n|  The 464 BG bombed the Concordia Vega refinery.\n|-\n|\n|\n| Daily output of aircraft fuel had dropped from 5,850 to 4,820 metric tonnes; but the reserve of 574,000 tonnes was expected to last 19 months. On \"'May 12 ... the technological war was decided. ...with the attack ... upon several fuel plants ... a new era in the air war began. It meant the end of German armaments production\" (Speer). \"In my view the fuel, Buna rubber, and nitrogen plants represent a particularly sensitive point for the conduct of the war, since vital materials for armaments are being manufactured in a small number of plants… The enemy has struck us at one of our weakest points. If they persist at it this time, we will soon no longer have any fuel production worth mentioning\" (Hitler). By May 28, fuel production had returned to the level prior to the May 12 raids. The \"economic air raids [using] wise planning [by] the enemy began ... in the last half or three-quarters of a year\" before December 1944. \"Before that he was, at least from his standpoint, committing absurdities\" (Speer, December 1, 1944)\n|-\n|\n|  Ploiești (Româno-Americană)\n|  The No. 205 Group RAF bombed the Româno-Americană refinery.\n|-\n|\n| Leipzig/Leuna\n|  Mission 376 dispatched a record force of 1,282 bombers against plants and refineries, losing 50 including 400 in the 2nd trial attack of oil targets. 63 B-24s bombed Merseburg/Leuna, and Leuna resumed partial production on June 3 and reached 75% of capacity in early July.\n|-\n|\n| Lützkendorf\n|  The 486 BG again bombed Lützkendorf.\n|-\n|\n| Magdeburg/Königsberg, Bavaria\n|  Mission 376: 105 B-17s bombed an oil dump at Königsburg/Magdeburg. A Königsberg target was also bombed on June 20 (Mission 425), and Magdeburg also had a Junkers Jumo 211 engine plant (the 487 BG bombed the Magdeburg airplane factory on August 5, 1944.)\n|-\n|\n| Magdeburg/Rothensee\n|  Mission 376: 55 B-17s bombed oil industry at Magdeburg/Rothensee. Bohlen-Rotha, Magdeburg-Rothensee, Ruhland-Scwarzheide (a 1937 Fischer-Tropsch plant), & Zeitz-Troglitz were the 4 plants (3 were for Bergius hydrogenation) of Braunkohlen Benzin AG (Brabag), which was formed on October 26, 1934. The Brabag subsidiary of Gesellschaft für Mineralölbau GmbH (established November 1936) designed the plants based on licensed information from other oil companies.\n|-\n|\n| Ruhland–Schwarzheide\n|  Mission 376: 38 B-17s bombed an oil target at Ruhland/Schwarz-Heide.\n|-\n|\n| Zeitz\n|  Mission 376: 187 B-24s bombed \"Zeitz-Tröglitz\". KZ Tröglitz was a subcamp of Buchenwald\n|-\n|\n| Pölitz\n|  Mission 379: 224 B-24s bombed an oil terminal at Pölitz. \"Poelitz/Stettin\" was a synthetic plant, and on May 13, clouds had forced 272 B-17s (Mission 355) dispatched to oil targets in W Poland to bomb Stettin () and Stralsund.\n|-\n|\n|  Ploiești\n|  Ploiești was bombed.\n|-\n|\n| Ludwigshafen\n|  The 447 BG bombed the oil refinery.\n|-\n|\n|\n| The 485 BG bombed the  Refinery. \"Lumina Petromina\" was an additional Romanian refinery not in Ploiești or Bucharest.\n|-\n|\n|\n|The intelligence annex to the field order for the May 31 Ploiești mission stated \"Successful attacks on [the aircraft factories at the] Wiener-Neustadter complex have raised oil to high priority. …destruction of remaining active capacity of Ploesti will create [a] critical situation for [the] entire Axis war effort and make possible further important inroads through attacks in Austria, Hungary, Yugoslavia and Italy. [The] Eighth Air Force has now damaged all but 2 of the major synthetic plants in its area making it possible for Fifteenth [Air Force] to destroy sufficient refinery and synthetic capacity to [reduce total] production close to 75 percent. Destruction of vital installations in targets selected will immobilize Ploesti capacity for several months.\"\n|-\n|\n|  Ploiești\n| 32 B-24s of the 450 BG attacked the \"Româno-Americană Oil Refinery\", but failed due to the smoke screens. The 450 BG also bombed the Româno-Americană refinery on June 6, 24, & July 15; and the Concordia Vega refinery on July 9, 22\n|-\n|\n|\n| A May 5 decoded message stated anti-aircraft artillery was being moved to Pölitz and Blechhammer, and one on June 5 indicated the Luftwaffe was short of fuel. British intelligence concluded that the bombing of oil targets would be \"crippling\" in 3–6 months. Romanian production had been reduced from 200,000 tons in February to 40,000 in June.\n|-\n|\n|\n| Spaatz ordered that \"the primary aim of the Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces would be to deny oil to the enemy\".\n|-\n|\n|  Ploiești (Dacia Română-485 BG, Româno-Americană-450 BG)\n|  In the 1st large-scale American attempt to use a dispersed bomber force to spread out fighter defenses in Romania, Ploiești was bombed (the 485 BG bombed the Dacia Română oil refinery). Additional B-17s, including some Soviet-based for Operation Frantic, attacked the Galați Airdrome: \"most oil from Ploesti must be shipped west over [the] Danube for refining.\" (annex of intelligence report)\n|-\n|\n|  Porto Marghera\n|  Porto Marghera oil storage bombed.\n|-\n|\n|  Trieste\n|  B-24s bombed an oil refinery at Trieste.\n|-\n|\n|  Ploiești\n| 36 P-38s dive-bombed 3 Ploiești oil refineries by flying under the smoke screens.\n|-\n|\n|  Constanța\n|  B-24s bombed an oil installation at Constanța.\n|-\n|\n|  Giurgiu\n|  The 461 BG bombed the Giurgiu oil storage. 80 miles southeast of Ploiești, Giurgiu was \"the most important transshipment point in Europe\".\n|-\n|\n|  Smederevo\n|  The 485 BG bombed the  oil refinery.\n|-\n|\n| Gelsenkirchen (Nordstern)\n|  The 1st RAF oil target bombing following the June 3 British Air Staff request for RAF Bomber Command to attack Ruhr oil plants halted Nordstern production (1,000 tons/day of aviation fuel) for several weeks.
