It ran weekly on Saturday nights on the ABC.\nIt was one of the most prestigious radio serials in the country at the time. According to the ABC Annual Report of 1956–57, \"This was designed to tell in lively dramatic form the story of the nation's development in the latter half of the nineteenth century. It was felt that the events of history, brought to life through the trials and tribulations of an imaginary family, could be depicted with greater clarity and colour in the form of a dramatic serial than is possible in the pages of a book of reference. Such proved to be the case and many enquiries about a possible re-broadcast of the serial were received.\"\nPremise\nThe life of English colonists in Sydney from 1856 to 1900.\nAdaptations\nNiland and Park adapted it into television scripts but they were never filmed.\nReferences"
