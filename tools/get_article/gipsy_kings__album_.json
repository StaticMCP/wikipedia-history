The US and European versions of this album are identical except in some cases the song order may differ. The Japanese version released in 1995 includes an alternate version of \"Vamos a Bailar\". The song \"Inspiration\" from this album famously appeared in the season five episode of Miami Vice, \"World of Trouble\", in June 1988.\nThe album was their first to reach a worldwide audience, going gold across France, the UK, the US and other countries. In 1988, Gipsy Kings was released in the US and it spent 40 weeks on the Billboard 200, one of very few Spanish language albums to do so.\nTrack listing\nJapanese Bonus Tracks\nSingles\n* Bamboléo (31 March 1988)\n* Djobi Djoba (25 October 1988)\n* Bem, Bem, Maria (25 February 1989)\n* Un Amor (29 July 1989)\n* Tu Quieres Volver (26 September 1989)\n* A Mi Manera (December 1989)\nPersonnel\n;Gipsy Kings\n*Nicolas Reyes — lead vocals, rhythm guitar\n*Tonino Baliardo — lead and rhythm guitars\n*André Reyes — rhythm guitar, backing vocals\n*Jacques \"Max\" Baliardo — rhythm guitar\n*Jahloul \"Chico\" Bouchikhi — rhythm guitar, handclaps\n*Maurice \"Diego\" Baliardo — rhythm guitar, handclaps\n*Paul \"Pablo\" Reyes — rhythm guitar\n;Additional Personnel\n*Dominique Perrier — synthesizer; arrangements (tracks 1, 3, 5, 12)\n*Gerard Prévost — bass, synthesizer; arrangements (tracks 2, 4, 6–9, 10, 11)\n*Claude Salmieri — drums\n*Marc Chantereau — percussion\nCharts and certifications\nChart performance\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1987-1989)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|Australian ARIA Albums Chart\n|align=\"center\"|2\n|-\n|Austrian Albums Chart\n|align=\"center\"|20\n|-\n|Dutch Albums Chart\n|align=\"center\"|22\n|-\n|Norwegian Albums Chart\n|align=\"center\"|14\n|-\n|New Zealand Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|20\n|-\n|Swedish Albums Chart\n|align=\"center\"|23\n|-\n|Swiss Albums Chart\n|align=\"center\"|23\n|}\nYear-End charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1989)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|Australian ARIA Albums Chart\n|align=\"center\"|21\n|}\nSales and certifications\n}}\n}}\nSee also\n* List of best-selling Latin albums\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.discogs.com/Gipsy-Kings-Gipsy-Kings/master/64204 Gipsy Kings] at Discogs\n*[http://www.gipsykings.net/VamosABailar/Discography.html# Gipsy Kings]  at gipsykings.net"
