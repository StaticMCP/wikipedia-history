In 816, the Tibetans attacked Uyghur territory. In 821, Tibetans were attacked. Tibet did an incursion into Tang territory and sacked the Tang capital.\nAfter a limited Tibetan incursion into Tang territory, the Tang dynasty promised marriage alliances to the Uyghur and Tibetan rulers. These marriages, as well as a Tang-Tibetan peace treaty, were finalized in 822.\nSigners\nOn November 8, 821, a Tang delegation left for Tibet to sign the treaty. The treaty was signed between the Emperor of Tibet, Ralpachan, and the Emperor Muzong of Tang.\nConsequences\nThe treaty helped stabilize political, military, and trade relations between Tibet and the Tang dynasty. Thus the treaty delimited the border between the two empires and the Tang recognized the occupation of Gansu by the Tibetans.\nIn 823, a stele known as the Tang-Tibet Treaty Inscription was erected in front of the main gate of the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa and of which there are two other copies, one in the capital of the Tang dynasty in Chang'an at the Emperor's Gate, and the other at the Tibetan-Tang border on Mount Meru. The terms of the treaty of the alliance are inscribed therein. Peace was thus assured for almost twenty years.\nReferences"
