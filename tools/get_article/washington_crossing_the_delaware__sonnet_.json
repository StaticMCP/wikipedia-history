      "text": "# Washington Crossing the Delaware (sonnet)\n\n\"Washington Crossing the Delaware\" is a sonnet that was written in 1936 by David Shulman. The title and subject of the poem refer to the scene in the 1851 painting Washington Crossing the Delaware by Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze. The poem is noted for being an anagrammatic poem – in this case, a 14-line rhyming sonnet in which every line is an anagram of the title.\nText\nSee also\n*George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E7D81339F934A35757C0A960958260 A letter to The New York Times] ([https://archive.today/20130130075115/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/07/books/l-alphabet-dancer-057061.html archived]) from author David Shulman (April 7, 1996)"
