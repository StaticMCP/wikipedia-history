The ceremony was scheduled one week later than usual to avoid a clash with the 2006 Winter Olympics. During the ceremony, AMPAS presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 24 categories honoring films released in 2005. The ceremony, televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by Gil Cates and directed by Louis J. Horvitz. Actor Jon Stewart hosted the show for the first time. Two weeks earlier in a ceremony at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California held on February 18, the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement were presented by host Rachel McAdams.\nCrash won three awards, including Best Picture. Other winners included Brokeback Mountain, King Kong, and Memoirs of a Geisha with three awards and Capote, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, The Constant Gardener, Hustle & Flow, March of the Penguins, The Moon and the Son: An Imagined Conversation, A Note of Triumph: The Golden Age of Norman Corwin, Six Shooter, Syriana, Tsotsi, Walk the Line, and Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit with one. The telecast garnered nearly 39 million viewers in the United States.\nWinners and nominees\nThe nominees for the 78th Academy Awards were announced on January 31, 2006, at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in the Academy's Beverly Hills headquarters by Sid Ganis, president of the Academy, and actress Mira Sorvino. Brokeback Mountain earned the most nominations with eight total; Crash, Good Night, and Good Luck, and Memoirs of a Geisha tied for second with six nominations each. All five Best Picture nominees received corresponding Best Director nominations (the fourth occurrence in Oscar history since the Best Picture nominees roster was limited to five films).\nThe winners were announced during the awards ceremony on March 5, 2006. Crash was the first Best Picture winner since 1976's Rocky to win only three Oscars and the first Best Picture winner since 1981's Chariots of Fire to not win Best Director or any of the acting categories. Best Director winner Ang Lee became the first non-Caucasian winner of that category. For this first time since the 34th ceremony in 1962, all four acting winners were first-time nominees. At age 20, Keira Knightley was the second-youngest Best Actress nominee for her performance as Elizabeth Bennet in Pride & Prejudice. Best Supporting Actor winner George Clooney was the fifth person to receive acting, directing, and screenwriting nominations in the same year and the first person to achieve this feat for two different films. By virtue of his nominations for both Memoirs of a Geisha and Munich, composer John Williams earned a total of 45 nominations tying him with Alfred Newman as the second most nominated individual in Oscar history. \"It's Hard out Here for a Pimp\" became the second rap song to win Best Original Song and the first such song to be performed at an Oscars ceremony.\nAwards\n, Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay co-winner|alt=Paul Haggis in in 2013]]\n, Best Director winner|alt=Ang Lee in 2016]]\n, Best Actor winner|alt=Philip Seymour Hoffman in 2011]]\n, Best Actress winner|alt=Reese Witherspoon in 2014]]\n, Best Supporting Actor winner|alt=George Cloone in 2016]]\n, Best Supporting Actress winner|alt=Rachel Weisz in 2018]]\n, Best Foreign Language Film winner|alt=Gavin Hood in 2015]]\n, Best Live Action Short Film winner|alt=Martin McDonaugh in 2012]]\nWinners are listed first, highlighted in boldface, and indicated with a double dagger ().\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n* 'Crash&nbsp;– Paul Haggis and Cathy Schulman, producers'\n** Brokeback Mountain&nbsp;– Diana Ossana and James Schamus, producers\n** Capote&nbsp;– Caroline Baron, William Vince and Michael Ohoven, producers\n** Good Night, and Good Luck&nbsp;– Grant Heslov, producer\n** Munich&nbsp;– Kathleen Kennedy, Steven Spielberg and Barry Mendel, producers\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n* 'Ang Lee&nbsp;– Brokeback Mountain'\n** Bennett Miller&nbsp;– Capote\n** Paul Haggis&nbsp;– Crash\n** George Clooney&nbsp;– Good Night, and Good Luck\n** Steven Spielberg&nbsp;– Munich\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Philip Seymour Hoffman&nbsp;– Capote as Truman Capote'\n** Terrence Howard&nbsp;– Hustle & Flow as DJay\n** Heath Ledger&nbsp;– Brokeback Mountain as Ennis Del Mar\n** Joaquin Phoenix&nbsp;– Walk the Line as Johnny Cash\n** David Strathairn&nbsp;– Good Night, and Good Luck as Edward R.

However, in an article published in The New York Times, it was stated that 2005 host Chris Rock would not return to host the show. According to a statement released by his publicist, \"He didn't want to do it in perpetuity, He'd like to do it again down the road.\" Furthermore, many media outlets speculated that several AMPAS members felt uncomfortable with Rock's disparaging comments about Colin Farrell, Jude Law, and Tobey Maguire. Initially, Cates sought actor and veteran Oscar host Billy Crystal to host the ceremony again. However, Crystal declined the offer citing his commitment to his one-man comedy show 700 Sundays.\nIn January 2006, Cates announced that actor, comedian, and talk show host Jon Stewart, who had previously hosted two consecutive Grammy Awards ceremonies in 2001 and 2002, was chosen as host of the 2006 telecast. Cates explained the decision to hire him saying, \"My wife and I watch him every night. Jon is the epitome of a perfect host — smart, engaging, irreverent and funny.\" In a statement, Stewart expressed that he was honored to be selected to emcee the program, jokingly adding, \"Although, as an avid watcher of the Oscars, I can't help but be a little disappointed with the choice. It appears to be another sad attempt to smoke out Billy Crystal.\"\nSeveral other people and companies participated in the production of the ceremony. Bill Conti served as musical supervisor for the telecast. Media firm The Ant Farm produced a thirty-second trailer promoting the broadcast featuring clips highlighting past Oscar winners to the tune of the song \"Our Lives\" by The Calling. Previous Oscar hosts such as Whoopi Goldberg and Steve Martin, and actors Mel Gibson, George Clooney, Halle Berry appeared in an opening comedic sketch. Actor Tom Hanks participated in a pre-taped comedic sketch lampooning Oscar speeches. Stephen Colbert (host of The Colbert Report, the sister program of Stewart's The Daily Show) narrated two different mock attack ads lampooning both the intense campaigning and lobbying during Oscar season put forth by film studios and political advertising during elections. Violinist Itzhak Perlman performed excerpts from the five nominees for Best Original Score.\nBox office performance of nominated films\nWhen the nominations were announced on January 31, the field of major nominees favored independent, low-budget films over blockbusters. The combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees when the Oscars were announced was $186 million with an average gross of $37.3 million per film. Crash was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees with $53.4 million in domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by Brokeback Mountain ($51.7 million), Munich ($40.8 million), Good Night and Good Luck ($25.2 million), and finally Capote ($15.4 million).\nOf the top 50 grossing movies of the year, 35 nominations went to 13 films on the list. Only  Walk the Line (19th), Cinderella Man (41st), Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (45th), and Crash (48th) were nominated for Best Picture, Best Animated Feature, or any of the directing, acting, or screenwriting. The other top 50 box office hits that earned nominations were Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (1st), Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2nd), The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe (3rd), War of the Worlds (4th), King Kong (5th), Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (7th), Batman Begins (8th), March of the Penguins, (26th), and Memoirs of a Geisha (47th).\nCritical reviews\nSome media outlets received the broadcast positively. St. Louis Post-Dispatch television critic Gail Pennington praised Stewart's performance as host writing that he \"did the Oscars proud Sunday night, turning in a four-star hosting performance that unfortunately made the rest of the show seem sluggish by comparison.\" Film critic Roger Ebert said that Stewart was \"on target, topical and funny,\" and added, \"He was as relaxed, amusing and at home as Johnny Carson.\" Columnist Ray Richmond of The Hollywood Reporter commented, \"He seemed at times nervous and self-conscious, but on the whole, Stewart delivered with just the right balance of reverence and smugness.\"\nOthers media publications were more critical of the show. Television critic Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that Stewart was more \"amusing than funny\". He added, \"Many of his jokes fell flat with the stars in the Kodak Theatre, and his tendency to bow down before celebrities quickly grew tiresome.\" Tom Shales from The Washington Post commented, \"It's hard to believe that professional entertainers could have put together a show less entertaining than this year's Oscars, hosted with a smug humorlessness by comic Jon Stewart, a sad and pale shadow of great hosts gone by.\" Moreover, he derided the \"piles and piles and miles and miles of clips from films present and past\" writing that it \"squandered the visual luster\" of the ceremony. Associated Press television critic Frazier Moore remarked, \"Stewart, usually a very funny guy, displayed a lack of beginner's luck as first-time host...His usually impeccable blend of puckishness and self-effacement fell flat in the service of Oscar.\" He also criticized the decision to play music over the winner's acceptance speeches calling it \"distracting and obnoxious.\"\nIn retrospective commentary, Crashs win for Best Picture over Brokeback Mountain has become \"one of the most notorious [decisions] in modern Academy history\" and a source of \"earnest bafflement from critics\". Rankings by several publications and critics have called Crash one of the worst or most controversial Best Picture winners.\nRatings and reception\nThe American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 38.94 million people over its length, which was an 8% decrease from the previous year's ceremony. Additionally, the show earned lower Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 23.0% of households watching over a 35 share. Furthermore, it garnered a lower 1849 demo rating with a 13.9 rating among viewers in that demographic.\nIn July 2006, the ceremony presentation received nine nominations at the 58th Primetime Emmys. The following month, the ceremony won four of those nominations for Outstanding Art Direction for a Variety, Music Program, or Special (Roy Christopher and Jeff Richman), Outstanding Directing for a Variety, Music, or Comedy Program (Louis J. Horvitz), Outstanding Main Title Design (Renato Grgic, Alen Petkovic, Kristijan Petrovic, and Jon Teschner), and Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Variety, Music, or Animation Series or Special (Patrick Baltzell, Robert Douglass, Edward J. Greene, Jamie Santos, and Tom Vicari).\n\"In Memoriam\"\nThe annual \"In Memoriam\": tribute was presented by actor George Clooney.

However, following protests from pro-Israeli groups in the United States, the Academy decided to designate it as a submission from the Palestinian Authority, a move that was decried by the film's director Hany Abu-Assad. During the awards ceremony, the film was eventually announced by presenter Will Smith as a submission from the Palestinian territories.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://oscar.go.com/ Academy Awards Official website]\n* [http://www.oscars.org/ The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Official website]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/user/Oscars Oscar's Channel]  at YouTube (run by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences)\n;News resources\n* [https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/entertainment/2006/oscars_2006/default.stm Oscars 2006]  BBC News\n* [http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2006/academy.awards/ Academy Awards coverage]  CNN\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/pages/movies/redcarpet/ Oscars 2006 - The Academy Awards]  The New York Times\n;Analysis\n* [http://www.filmsite.org/aa05.html 2005 Academy Awards Winners and History]  Filmsite\n* [https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000003/2006 Academy Awards, USA: 2006]  Internet Movie Database\n;Other resources\n*"
