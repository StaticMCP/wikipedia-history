The Sturt Highway crosses the locality which is bounded by the Thiele Highway on the northwest, Roseworthy and Gomersal Roads on the north and the North Para River on the south.\nKingsford's boundaries were established in May 1995 for the \"long-established name,\" which is derived from the “Kingsford homestead.”  The principal land use in the locality is agriculture.\nThe Kingsford homestead survives and is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register; it is also notable as a location in the Australian television series, McLeod's Daughters.  Kingsford is located within the federal Division of Barker, the state electoral district of Light and the local government area of the Light Regional Council.\nReferences"
