Hawaii voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote. The state of Hawaii has four electoral votes in the Electoral College, following reapportionment due to the 2020 United States census in which the state neither gained nor lost a seat.\nHawaii is a Pacific island state with its culture distinct from that of the U.S. mainland and its population has an Asian American plurality, unique among the 50 states. Hawaii has only voted Republican in two presidential elections since gaining statehood, in 1972 and 1984; nevertheless, its support for the Democratic Party has gradually declined after reaching a peak in 2008.\nAlthough Harris won the state comfortably, Donald Trump received the highest vote percentage for a Republican since 2004, narrowing the margin by over 6% compared to 2020.\nHawaii is just 23% White, and has the highest percentage of Asian Americans of any state, highlighting the swing of Asian voters towards Republicans in this election, though Harris still won Asian voters overall. This was also the first time since 2004 that the Democratic candidate failed to receive 60% of the vote in all of Hawaii's counties.\nPrimary elections\nDemocratic caucuses\nThe Hawaii Democratic caucuses were held on March 6, 2024.\nRepublican caucuses\nThe Hawaii Republican caucuses was held on March 12, 2024, alongside primaries in Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, and Washington.\nGeneral election\nThe Democratic Party of Hawaii attempted to disqualify the \"ballot access petition\" for Kennedy's newly created party, the We the People Party, on the November ballot, though the state Democratic Party was unsuccessful.\nPredictions\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Source\n!Ranking\n!As of\n|-\n| align=left | The Cook Political Report\n|\n|December 19, 2023\n|-\n| align=left | Inside Elections\n|\n|April 26, 2023\n|-\n| align=left | Sabato's Crystal Ball\n|\n|June 29, 2023\n|-\n| align=left | Decision Desk HQ/The Hill\n|\n|December 14, 2023\n|-\n| align=left | CNalysis\n|\n|December 30, 2023\n|-\n| align=left | CNN\n|\n|January 14, 2024\n|-\n| align=left | The Economist\n|\n|June 12, 2024\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |538\n|\n| June 11, 2024\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |RCP\n|\n| June 26, 2024\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | NBC News\n|\n|October 6, 2024\n|}\nPolling\nJoe Biden vs. Donald Trump\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-datatable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;line-height:17px\"\n|- valign=bottom\n!

Trump's margin was the best out of his three runs, having increased in every consecutive election. Trump's increased success in Hawaii was attributed by local political scientists to Hawaii's extremely high cost of living, with former blue-collar plantation households in Western Oahu posting some of Trump's strongest gains in the state. As the only state with a plurality of Asian ethnicity, Hawaii was affected by a large national shift to the right among Asian-American voters, especially Filipino Americans, who represent one of the largest Asian groups in Hawaii. Filipino Americans shifted to Trump in part cause of concern of China's Navy being close to the Philippines in the South China Sea and perceived Biden and the Democratic Party as ineffective against China's aggression.\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Hawaii\n* 2024 United States presidential election\n* 2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries\n* 2024 Republican Party presidential primaries\n* 2024 United States elections\nNotes\nPartisan clients\nReferences"
