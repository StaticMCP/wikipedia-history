Both schools are members of the Patriot League.\nOrigin of the Cup\nThe Ram–Crusader Cup was instituted in 1951 to honor the memory of Major Frank W. Cavanaugh. The idea for the Cup came from William P. Walsh, at the time, a Holy Cross undergrad.  Walsh was working at a summer camp headed by then Fordham head coach, Ed Danowski, when hearing that the Rams and Crusaders were restarting their series.  Despite being enrolled at Holy Cross, Walsh grew up on Long Island as a Fordham football fan.  The summer camp counselor approached his boss and suggested inaugurating a trophy in honor of Major Frank Cavanaugh.  The \"Iron Major” spent three seasons as head coach of Holy Cross (1903-1905) where he had a 19–10–2 record, and six at Fordham (1927-1932) where he had a 34–14–4 record and also elevated the program to college football's highest level.  Danowski, who had captained Cavanaugh's last team while a quarterback for the Rams, looked forward to the trophy game and enthusiastically predicted Fordham would “pin back the ears” of the Crusaders.  Instead, it was Holy Cross easily prevailing in a 54–20 blowout.  John Cavanaugh, son of the Hall of Fame coach, later made the post-game trophy presentation to Holy Cross.  Contests staged in 1952, '53 and '54 were all far closer affairs but each also ended with Holy Cross victories.  When Fordham terminated their football program following the 1954 season the Cup was put on hiatus.\nReturn of the Cup\nAlthough Holy Cross never terminated their own program, from about the early 1950s to the early 1980s they played a mostly regional schedule at a lower Division I level with only mixed results. In 1982 they moved down to I-AA status where, under Coach Rick E. Carter and later Mark Duffner, fortunes quickly changed.  From 1982 to 1991 they finished with a Top-20 national ranking every year but one. Meanwhile, after years without a team, and later, years as a club team, followed by years as a D-III team, Fordham finally elevated their own program to the I-AA level for the 1989 season.  The Rams officially joined the Patriot League (then still known as the Colonial League) the following season thus allowing them to resume their series with Holy Cross.\n36 years had passed since their last gridiron encounter but once again it was Holy Cross dominating with a 48–0 conquest.  The Worcester school kept their monopoly on the \"Iron Major Cup\" until Fordham finally broke through with a win in 1995.  It started a run where the Rams won 15 of 22. Since then, Holy Cross is currently on a seven-game winning streak and leads the Ram–Crusader Cup series, 23–15.  They also lead the all-time series 34–25–2 which dates back to 1902, a year before Cavanaugh began patrolling Holy Cross’ sidelines.\nThe 2016 game was played on November 12, at Yankee Stadium, where in front of 21,000+ fans, Fordham routed Holy Cross, 54–14. This marked Fordham's first game at The Stadium since 1946 and the first encounter between the schools at a professional venue since 1954. Previous Cups were staged in Ireland (1991) and Bermuda (1995).\nGame results\n| team2 = Holy Cross\n| team2style =\n| November 8, 1902 | New York | Fordham | 0 | Holy Cross | 17\n| November 20, 1905 | New York | Fordham | 5 | Holy Cross | 27\n| November 3, 1906 | Worcester | Fordham | 5 | Holy Cross | 8\n| November 29, 1906 | New York | Fordham | 6 | Holy Cross | 15\n| November 2, 1907 | Worcester | Fordham | 35 | Holy Cross | 0\n| November 28, 1907 | New York | Fordham | 35 | Holy Cross | 0\n| November 20, 1909 | New York | Fordham | 9 | Holy Cross | 5\n| November 15, 1913 | Worcester | Fordham | 0 | Holy Cross | 60\n| October 23, 1915 | New York | Fordham | 9 | Holy Cross | 0\n| November 18, 1916 | Worcester | Fordham | 40 | Holy Cross | 0\n| October 20, 1917 | New York | Fordham | 12 | Holy Cross | 0\n| November 18, 1922 | Worcester | Fordham | 0 | Holy Cross | 28\n| November 10, 1923 | New York | Fordham | 7 | Holy Cross | 23\n| October 25, 1924 | Worcester | Fordham | 0 | Holy Cross | 13\n| November 7, 1925 | New York | Fordham | 17 | Holy Cross | 0\n| November 6, 1926 | Worcester | Fordham | 7 | Holy Cross | 7\n| November 5, 1927 | New York | Fordham | 2 | Holy Cross | 7\n| October 28, 1928 | Worcester | Fordham | 19 | Holy Cross | 13\n| October 19, 1929 | New York | Fordham | 7 | Holy Cross | 0\n| October 18, 1930 | Worcester | Fordham | 6 | Holy Cross | 0\n| October 17, 1931 | New York | Fordham | 6 | Holy Cross | 6\n| November 22, 1947 | Worcester | Fordham | 0 | Holy Cross | 48\n| November 13, 1948 | Worcester | Fordham | 6 | Holy Cross | 13\n| October 6, 1951 | Worcester | Fordham | 20 | Holy Cross | 54\n| October 4, 1952 | Worcester | Fordham | 7 | Holy Cross | 12\n| November 21, 1953 | Worcester | Fordham | 7 | Holy Cross | 20\n| November 13, 1954 | New York | Fordham | 19 | Holy Cross | 20\n| November 10, 1990 | New York | Fordham | 0 | Holy Cross | 48\n| November 16, 1991 | Limerick | Fordham | 19 | Holy Cross | 24\n| November 21, 1992 | Worcester | Fordham | 13 | Holy Cross | 21\n| November 20, 1993 | Worcester | Fordham | 12 | Holy Cross | 28\n| October 29, 1994 | New York | Fordham | 21 | Holy Cross | 31\n| October 28, 1995 | Hamilton | Fordham | 17 | Holy Cross | 10\n| November 2, 1996 | New York | Fordham | 28 | Holy Cross | 0\n| November 22, 1997 | Worcester | Fordham | 28 | Holy Cross | 12\n| November 14, 1998 | Worcester | Fordham | 13 | Holy Cross | 10\n| November 13, 1999 | New York | Fordham | 14 | Holy Cross | 37\n| November 18, 2000 | Worcester | Fordham | 20 | Holy Cross | 27\n| November 17, 2001 | New York | Fordham | 24 | Holy Cross | 21\n| November 9, 2002 | Worcester | Fordham | 37 | Holy Cross | 27\n| November 8, 2003 | New York | Fordham | 49 | Holy Cross | 28\n| October 2, 2004 | Worcester | Fordham | 42 | Holy Cross | 35\n| October 29, 2005 | New York  | Fordham | 24 | Holy Cross | 20\n| September 30, 2006 | Worcester | Fordham | 21 | Holy Cross | 28\n| November 3, 2007 | New York | Fordham | 24 | Holy Cross | 21\n| November 8, 2008 | Worcester | Fordham | 17 | Holy Cross | 38\n| October 31, 2009 | New York | Fordham | 27 | Holy Cross | 41\n| October 2, 2010 | Worcester | Fordham | 31 | Holy Cross | 36\n| November 19, 2011 | New York | Fordham | 21 | Holy Cross | 41\n| October 27, 2012 | Worcester | Fordham | 36 | Holy Cross | 32\n| November 2, 2013 | New York | Fordham | 32 | Holy Cross | 30\n| September 27, 2014 | Worcester | Fordham | 45 | Holy Cross | 16\n| October 17, 2015 | New York | Fordham | 47 | Holy Cross | 41OT\n| November 12, 2016 | New York | Fordham | 54 | Holy Cross | 14\n| November 4, 2017 | New York | Fordham | 20 | Holy Cross | 42\n| November 10, 2018 | Worcester | Fordham | 13 | Holy Cross | 17\n| November 16, 2019 | New York | Fordham | 27 | Holy Cross | 49\n| March 27, 2021 | Worcester | Fordham | 24 | Holy Cross | 34\n| November 13, 2021 | New York | Fordham | 24 | Holy Cross | 52\n| October 29, 2022 | Worcester | Fordham | 52OT | Holy Cross | 53\n| October 28, 2023 | New York | Fordham | 47 | Holy Cross | 49\n| October 12, 2024 | Worcester | Fordham | 16 | Holy Cross | 19\n| September 27, 2025 | New York | Fordham | 26 | Holy Cross | 21\n}}\nSee also\n* List of NCAA college football rivalry games\nReferences"
