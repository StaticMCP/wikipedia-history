The scheme consists of two skyscrapers that completed in 2020, is one of the tallest residential developments in London and the United Kingdom.\nWith over 70% of the flats priced at over £1.5 million, and penthouses priced at over £5 million, Wardian London is considered to be the most expensive residential development in East London. Occupants will also be members of The Wardian Club and have exclusive access to amenities including 24 hours concierge, spa & gym, 25-metre heated swimming pool, cinema, business centre, restaurants, shops and observation deck.\nIn 2023, Wardian was awarded the Silver Award for Best Luxury Development at the What House? Awards, as a recognition of EcoWorld Ballymore's emphasis on biophilia at the scheme and a celebration of its efforts in introducing nature to a dense built environment.\nBackground and design\nOriginal plans\nPrior to the current scheme, developer Ballymore had been granted planning permission for a 525,000 sq ft office development on the same site. This proposal consisted of two towers of 26 and 16 storeys. Building work got as far as completing part of the basement before Ballymore abandoned the scheme due to a lack of tenancy agreements.\nNew proposal\nIn 2013, Ballymore applied for new planning permission for two, residential-led towers designed by Glenn Howells Architects in the Isle of Dogs, just south of Canary Wharf.  The scheme was granted planning permission on 6 November 2014 by councillors at Tower Hamlets council.\nThe two towers are 55 and 50 storeys. The East Tower is the larger of the two skyscrapers and rises to  in height while the West Tower reaches , making them two of the tallest residential buildings approved in London and in the United Kingdom. The skyscrapers are linked at their base by a podium. In total, the development will provide 766 residential apartments.\nIn 2015, the development name was changed from Arrowhead Quay to Wardian London.\nSale\nIn January 2015, Ballymore announced a deal with Malaysian property investment company, Eco World, in which Ballymore sold Wardian London to Eco World as well as two other schemes, namely, Embassy Gardens and phase two of its London City Island development for £428m. This created a holding company known as Eco World-Ballymore Holding Company Limited. Ballymore own 25 per cent of the company and Eco World own the remaining 75 per cent. However, Ballymore will continue to manage the three schemes within the new company.\nConstruction\nConstruction for the two towers topped out in August 2019, with the first residents moving in during early 2020. Final construction of the development is due to be complete in early 2021.\nFile:Wardian London 2018.png|July 2018\nFile:Wardian London 2019.png|July 2019\nFile:WardianEastCanaryWharf.jpg|August 2020\nFile:Wardian Tower East.png|East Tower, September 2020\nLocation\nThe skyscrapers are located east of 163 Marsh Wall on the Isle of Dogs, to the immediate south of Canary Wharf's commercial district.
