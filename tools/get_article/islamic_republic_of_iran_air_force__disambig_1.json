The present air force was created when the Imperial Iranian Air Force was renamed in 1979 following the Iranian Revolution. The IRIAF was heavily involved in the Iran–Iraq War, carrying out major operations like Operation Kaman 99, Operation Sultan 10, the H-3 airstrike, and the first attack on a nuclear reactor in history, Operation Scorch Sword.\nAfter eight years of aerial combat in that conflict, the IRIAF has the second highest claimed number of fighter aces in the region, exceeded only by the Israeli Air Force; as many as seven IRIAF pilots claimed more than six kills, mostly achieved in the F-14 Tomcat. Veterans of the Iran–Iraq War formed the core of the IRIAF command. Due to its outdated equipment and lack of spare parts for its aircraft due to international sanctions, the IRIAF was unable to counter Israeli air strikes during the Iran–Israel War, with no reports of its fighter jets being deployed, which gave Israel air superiority over Iran.\nHistory\nIn February 1979, the IRIAF came into being when the former Imperial Iranian Air Force (IIAF) was renamed following the Islamic Revolution in Iran. The British publishing company Orbis' Warplane partwork magazine seems to indicate the renaming did not actually take place until after the Iran–Iraq War had broken out.\nThis \"new\" Iranian air force largely inherited the equipment and structure of the former IIAF, losing most of its leading officers in the course of post-revolutionary chaos, as well as due to the prosecution of those considered as loyal to the Shah, pro-U.S. or elsewhere by the new government in Tehran.\nDue to strained relations with the West, Iran had to procure new equipment from Brazil, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. Since the Revolution, the exact composition of the IRIAF has been hard to determine. Many aircraft belonging to the Iraqi Air Force took refuge in Iran during the Persian Gulf War in 1991, and many were put into service with the IRIAF or taken apart for spare parts.\nDue to the continuous spare parts shortages faced by the air force, a decision was made in the late 1980s to develop a local aerospace industry to support the air force.\nIn 2002, Iran with the co-operation of Ukraine, successfully started the manufacture of the Iran-140, a licence-built version of the Antonov An-140 transport aircraft. Simultaneously, Iran began construction of two domestically produced fighters, upgraded using technology from the F-14 Tomcat and the F-5 Tiger II. The fighters have been named the Azarakhsh and the Shafaq.\nSince then, Iran has also become self-sufficient in the manufacture of helicopters. Iran claims that it is capable of producing the U.S. AH-1 Cobra gunship. Iran produces Bell Helicopter Bell 212 and Bell 206 helicopters in serial production. These are known respectively as the Shabaviz 2-75 and the Shabaviz 206.\nIran–Iraq War (1980–88)\nA series of purges and forced retirements resulted in the manpower of the airforce being halved between February 1979 and July 1980, leaving the IRIAF ill-prepared for the Iran–Iraq War, also called the \"1st Persian Gulf War\". The sudden Iraqi air strikes against eight major Iranian airbases and four other military installations, launched on the afternoon of 22 September 1980, came as a complete surprise and caused a shock in the IRIAF.\nOn 23 September 1980, the Iranians retaliated with Operation Kaman 99, which involved 206 F-4, F-5 and F-14 aircraft. In that operation, 40 F-4 Phantoms, armed with Mark 82, Mark 83 and Mark 84 bombs and AGM-65 Maverick missiles, took off from Hamadan. After refueling mid-air, the Phantoms reached the Iraqi capital Baghdad, where they attacked the al-Rashid, al-Habbaniyah and al-Kut airbases. Meanwhile, eight more F-4s took off from Tehran and launched a second attack on the al-Rashid airbase.\nIran proceeded to launch 58 F-5E Tiger IIs from Tabriz, which were sent to attack Mosul Airbase. After the attack on Mosul Airbase, another 50 F-5Es were dispatched to strike Nasiriyah Airbase, which was heavily damaged.\nAs all 148 Iranian F-4s and F-5s had been sent for a bombing raid on Iraq, 60 F-14 Tomcats were scrambled to defend Iranian airspace against a possible Iraqi retaliation. Iranian F-14s managed to down 2 Iraqi MiG-21s (1 MiG-21RF and 1 MiG-21MF) and 3 Iraqi MiG-23s (MiG-23MS). An Iranian F-5E also shot down an Iraqi Su-20 during the operation. Iraqi MiG-23s managed to down 2 F-5Es, while Iraqi MiG-21s downed 2 F-5Es. The Iraqis also shot down one of their own Il-76MD strategic airlifters with a SA-3 SAM.\nThe Iraqis were well prepared for the attack, and had flown most of their air force to other Arab countries, such as Saudi Arabia. This made sure that most of the Iraqi Air Force survived the operation.\nSaddam Hussein and the Iraqi military were dealt a heavy blow when Iranian Air Force vulnerabilities failed to materialize. All Iraqi air bases' near Iran were out of order for weeks and, according to Iran, Iraq's aerial efficiency was reduced by 55%. This allowed Iranians to regroup and prepare for the upcoming Iraqi invasion.\nAlthough the readiness rates of the IRIAF significantly increased in the following months, its overall role and influence declined, as the clerical government prioritized resources for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) militias, and simultaneously attempted to develop a separate air arm for the IRGC.\nDespite limitations and sanctions, the IRIAF achieved a successful kill rate in air-to-air combat against Iraqi jets. In air-to-air engagements, Iran's kill ratio was roughly 5:1, which was surpassed by the Israelis against Syria in 1982 and the US in the Gulf war in 1991. It got to the point where Iraq ordered its pilots to avoid air-to-air engagements, especially with the F-14.\nAfter the successful liberation of most Iranian areas captured by the Iraqis in the first half of 1982, the situation of the IRIAF changed completely. From an air arm that was offensive by nature, it was largely relegated to air defense and relatively infrequent bombing attacks against targets of industrial and military significance inside Iraq. Simultaneously, the IRIAF had to learn how to maintain and keep operational its large fleet of U.S.-built aircraft and helicopters without outside help, due to American sanctions. Relying primarily on antiquated equipment purchased from the US in the 1970s, the Iranians began establishing their own aerospace industry.\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force]]\nFrom 1984 and 1985, the IRIAF found itself confronted by an ever-better organized and equipped opponent, as the Iraqi Air force—reinforced by deliveries of advanced fighter-bombers from France and the Soviet Union—launched numerous offensives against Iranian air bases, military bases, industrial infrastructures, power plants, oil-export hubs, and population centers. These became better known as \"The Tanker War\" and \"The War of the Cities\".\nTo defend against an increasing number of Iraqi air strikes, the IRIAF leaned heavily on its large fleet of Grumman F-14 Tomcat interceptor fighters. Tomcats were mainly deployed in defense of the strategically important Khark Island, the main hub for Iranian oil exports, and Tehran. Over 300 air-to-air engagements against IQAF fighters, fighter-bombers, and bombers, were fought in these areas between 1980 and 1988.\nConfronted with the fact that it could not obtain replacements for equipment lost in what became a war of attrition against Iraq, the IRIAF remained defense-orientated for the rest of the conflict, conserving its surviving assets as a \"force in being\". From mid 1987, the IRIAF found itself confronted with U.S. Navy fighters over the Persian Gulf. A number of confrontations between July 1987 and August 1988 stretched available IRIAF assets to the limit, exhausting its capability to defend Iranian air space against Iraqi air strikes.\nWith this brutal air fight during 8 consecutive years, many Iranian fighter pilots claimed world records during the war, such as General Yadollah Khalili, who holds the worldwide record of the longest straight flight in a fighter plane, having flown an F-14 non-stop for 11 hours, aerial refuelling 8 times during the process. Fereydoun Ali Mazandarani was the first pilot to aerial refuel an F-14 in a night environment.\nAs a result of this war, the IRIAF developed proven tactics and skillful battle tested pilots, becoming one of the most experienced air arms in the region.\nThe most notable Iranian fighter pilots were Fereydoun Ali Mazandarani, Fazlollah Javidnia, Jalil Zandi and Shahram Rostami. Other notable pilots include, Hossein Khalatbari, Abbas Doran, Hassan Harandi, Abolfazl Mehreganfar, Ghafour Jeddi, Abbas Babaei and Ali Eghbali Dogahe among many others.\nPost Iran–Iraq War\nHercules, 2010]]\nImmediately after the end of the Iran–Iraq War, the IRIAF was partially rebuilt through limited purchases of MiG-29 fighters and Su-24 bombers from the Soviet Union, and F-7M and FT-7 fighters from China. While providing needed reinforcement to the Iranian Air Force, these types never replaced the older, U.S.-built F-4 Phantoms, F-14s (the IRIAF is now the only air arm in the world using the fighter), or F-5s. Instead, the IRIAF continued its efforts to keep these types in service, and began a number of projects to refurbish and upgrade them.\n1990s\nDuring the 1991 Persian Gulf War, numerous Iraqi pilots flew Iraqi Air Force aircraft to Iran to avoid destruction by coalition forces. The Iranians impounded these aircraft and never returned them, putting them in service in the IRIAF and claiming them as reparations for the Iran–Iraq War. The aircraft included several Mirage F1s, MiG-23s, MiG-29s, Su-20s, Su-22Ms, Su-24s, Su-25s and a number of Il-76s, including the secret, one-off AEW-AWACS Il-76 \"ADNAN 1\" prototype.\nEven after the cease-fire with Iraq, the IRIAF carried out several air raids against Kurdish bases in northern Iraq. The first raid was conducted using eight F-4s armed with rockets and cluster bombs on 6 April 1992 against People's Mujahedin of Iran's Camp Ashraf. During this event one F-4 was shot down by either insurgent or Iraqi military AAA. Both pilots, Lt. Col Amini and Cpt. Sharifi, were captured, and freed in 1998. Despite threats of response, Iraq was not able to retaliate due to its own fight against Kurdish separatist guerrillas and the Western-imposed no-fly zones that crippled and limited its air force's operations.\nIn 2007, Iraq asked Iran to return some of the scores of Iraqi fighter planes that flew there ahead of the Gulf War in 1991. In 2014, Iran was receptive to the demands and was working on refurbishing an unspecified number of jets. In late 2014, Iran returned 130 military aircraft to Iraq.\n2000s\nIn 2006, after Iranian media published a series of reports suggesting that Venezuela was interested in selling its 21 F-16 Fighting Falcons to Iran, a Hugo Chavez adviser confirmed to the Associated Press that \"Venezuela's military is considering selling its fleet of U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets to another country, possibly Iran, in response to a U.S. ban on arms sales to President Hugo Chávez's government\". In response, Sean McCormack, a U.S. State Department spokesperson, warned Venezuela that \"without the written consent of the United States, Venezuela can't transfer these defense articles, and in this case F-16s, to a third country\".\n, 2014]]\nAccording to Moscow Defense Brief, Russia delivered 6 Su-25UBK ground attack fighter-trainers, 12 Mi-171Sh military transport helicopters, 21 Mi-171 transport helicopters, and 3 Mi-17B-5 medical helicopters to Iran between 2000 and 2006. A $700&nbsp;million repair and modernization program of the IRIAF MiG-29 and Su-24 fighters was also completed.\nOn 22 September 2009, an IRIAF Il-76 collided with an F-5E shortly after an annual parade in Tehran and crashed near Varamin, killing all seven people on board.\n2010s\nAt the end of 2014, there was evidence that the IRIAF was involved in the 2014 military intervention against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. A video released by Aljazeera seemed to show an Iranian F-4 Phantom II bombing some ISIS buildings in Diyala Governorate.\nOn August 26, 2018, an F-5F crash-landed near Dezful, killing the pilot and injuring the co-pilot.\nOn 25 December 2019, an MiG-29 crashed in the Sabalan mountains.\n2020s\nThe IRIAF air fleet is aging, some aircraft are more than 40 years old, and this has led to several crashes. In June 2021, another F-5F crashed near Dezful, killing both crew. In February 2022, a F-5F crashed into a school in Tabriz, killing both crew and a person on the ground. In May 2022, two Chinese-built Chengdu J-7 crashed east of Isfahan, killing the pilots.\nSince the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Iran and Russia have formed closer relations, with Iran supplying Russia with loitering munitions such as the HESA Shahed 136. Subsequently, Russia has begun to supply Iran with more advanced weapon systems, namely the Yakovlev Yak-130 jet trainer, with the first two delivered in September 2023.\nIran–Israel War\nDue to ageing and outdated equipment, the IRIAF was unable to counter the Israeli Air Force (IAF) during the June 2025 Iran–Israel War, enabling the IAF to achieve air superiority over Iran; there was no sign that IRIAF fighter jets even left the ground. Initial waves of airstrikes by the Israeli Air Force reportedly destroyed two parked F-14 Tomcats, while another Israeli airstrike the following week destroyed three more parked F-14s, according to Israeli sources. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) produced evidence that it destroyed what was reportedly the IRIAF's sole operable aerial tanker, a KC-707 parked at Mashhad Shahid Hasheminejad International Airport, about  from Israel; this is possibly the farthest strike ever undertaken by the IDF. An expert interviewed by The New York Times said that the destruction of the tanker would have little immediate effect because the IRIAF had not recently been conducting aerial refueling.\nOn 22 June 2025, the United States conducted airstrikes against Iranian nuclear facilities using multiple B-2 Spirit bombers of the United States Air Force and Tomahawk missiles launched from an unnamed United States Navy submarine. No response by the IRIAF was detected, US officials said.\nStructure\nNote: former outdated Jane's Sentinel estimate of units 1993 data (Source: Jane's Sentinel, Islamic Republic of Iran, 1993, – not complete) has now been replaced by newer 2019 data.\nThe IRIAF's composition has changed very little since 1979. There were limited relocations and unit disbandments in the late 1980s (F-4D/E and F-14 fleet at Shiraz and Mehrabad). Deployments during the war with Iraq were mainly temporary. In 1985, a major reorganization of existing air-defense SAM and AAA units took place. There were not any major reorganizations in the 1990s.\nIranian airforce equipment, capabilities, and performance strongly influenced the development of the Iraqi Air Force (IQAF) in the 1980s, and the United Arab Emirates Air Force in the 1990s.\nIn 2013, the Iranian authorities changed their command structure, relating to tactical air bases, military installations, and civil airports. Almost all airfields previously designated as being of some strategic importance for contingency scenarios, have now been made suitable for combined military and civilian usage.\nThis is in accordance with the IRIAF operating small composite units spread out all over Iran, easy to relocate at very short notice, instead of the former, large fixed-based units. All dual-use airfields have basic cross-service capabilities to handle all IRIAF aircraft. The main facilities for logistics and technical overhaul remain concentrated at some larger airfields.\nIran has been under sanctions since 1979, with Iran servicing and overhauling its own military and civilian aircraft. In 2015, less tension in international relations led to a decrease in the sanctions, and the Iranian government was able to order a new fleet of civilian aircraft, replacing the aged types.\nJane's 360 military capabilities assessment 2019\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Usage\n!Location\n!Aircraft\n|-\n|Ahmadi\n|Reserve airfield\n|29°05′57″N 51°02′07″E\n|none\n|-\n|Araz\n|Reserve airfield\n|39°06′40″N 45°20′02″E\n|none\n|-\n|Bandar Abbas\n|Combined Mil/Civ airfield\n|27°13′05″N 56°22′40″E\n|Composite unit F-4 Phantom II; F-7 Airguard\n|-\n|Bandar e Jask\n|Combined Mil/Civ airfield\n|25°39′11″N 57°47′51″E\n|Maritime patrol flight Lockheed P-3F Orion\n|-\n|Birjand\n|Combined Mil/Civ airfield\n|32°53′53″N 59°15′58″E\n|Unknown composite unit\n|-\n|Bishe Kola\n|Combined Mil/Civ airfield\n|36°39′18″N 52°20′58″E\n|HESA Shahed 278 light utility helicopter flight\n|-\n|Bushehr\n|Combined Mil/Civ airfield\n|28°56′41″N 50°50′04″E\n|Composite unit F-4;Grumman F-14 Tomcat; UAV's\n|-\n|Chahbahar\n|Combined Mil/Civ airfield\n|25°26′41″N 60°22′55″E\n|Composite unit Dassault Mirage F1; F-4\n|-\n|Darrahi\n|Reserve airfield\n|29°22′33″N 51°04′03″E\n|none\n|-\n|Dezful\n|Combined Mil/Civ\n|32°25′57″N 48°24′07″E\n|Composite unit Northrop F-5; F-7 Airguard\n|-\n|Firuzabad\n|Army aviation base\n|35°31'43\"N 51°30'26\"E\n|Composite helicopter unit Shahed 278\n|-\n|Gorreh\n|Reserve airfield\n|29°54′25″N 50°25′43″E\n|none\n|-\n|Hamadan\n|Combined Mil/Civ airfield\n|35°12′37″N 48°39′12″E\n|Composite unit F-4; F-7\n|-\n|Hesa\n|Aircraft manufacturer\n|32°55′44″N 51°33′40″E\n|tech/log/maintenance plant\n|-\n|Isfahan / Badr\n|Army aviation; tech overhaul base\n| 32°37′16″N 51°41′49″E\n|Composite helicopter units\n|-\n|Isfahan / international\n|Combined Mil/Civ\n|32°45'10\"N 51°52'44\"E\n|Composite unt F-14; Mikoyan MiG-29\n|-\n|Isfahan / Sahid Vatanpour\n|Army aviation; logistics base\n|32°34′09″N 51°41′12″E\n|Composite helicopter unit\n|-\n|Kashan\n|Combined Mil/Civ airfield\n|33°53′43″N 51°34′37″E\n|Composite fighter flights\n|-\n|Kerman\n|Airbase\n|30°15′57″N 56°57′34″E\n|Composite fighter/attack aircraft\n|-\n|Kermanshah\n|Airbase\n|34°20′45″N 47°09′29″E\n|Composite unit Sukhoi Su-24; Sukhoi Su-25\n|-\n|Kharg Island\n|Combined Mil/Civ airfield\n|26°31′33″N 53°58′52″E\n|Composite unit Antonov An-74; Harbin Y-12 aircraft; Mil Mi-17 helicopters; UAV's\n|-\n|Kish\n|Airbase\n|26°31′33″N 53°58′52″E\n|Composite fighter unit\n|-\n|Manzariyeh\n|Army aviation base\n|34°59′02″N 50°48′22″E\n|Embraer EMB 312 Tucano  trainer/light attack\n|-\n|Mashhad\n|Combined Mil/Civ airfield\n|36°14′07″N 59°38′38″E\n|Composite unit F-4; F-5\n|-\n|Masjed Soleyman\n|Airbase\n|31°59′58″N 49°16′16″E\n|Composite unit F-14; F-4\n|-\n|Mehrshahr\n|Training base\n|35°46′34″N 50°52′51″E\n|Training Pilatus PC-6 Porter; Embraer 312\n|-\n|Omidiyeh\n|Combined Mil/Civ airfield\n|30°49′51″N 49°32′35″E\n|Unknown composite units\n|-\n|Shiraz\n|Combined Mil/Civ airfield; logistics; tech overhaul\n|29°32′11″N 52°35′18″E\n|Composite unit Ilyushin Il-76 airlift; P-3F maritime patrol; Su-24 attack; Bell 214 light utility\n|-\n|Soga\n|Combined Mil/Civ airfield\n|37°37′40″N 56°10′23″E\n|Composite airlift unit Lockheed C-130H Hercules; Boeing 707\n|-\n|Tabriz\n|Combined Mil/Civ airfield\n|38°07′44″N 46°14′24″E\n|Composite unit F-5; F-14; Boeing CH-47 Chinook\n|-\n|Tehran / Doshan Tappeh\n|Training/logistics base\n|35°42'00\"N 51°28'22\"E\n|Training/conversion Chengdu F-7; Northrop F-5B; Mirage F-1BQ\n|-\n|Tehran / Ghale Morghi\n|Closed\n|35°38′41″N 51°22′51″E\n|None\n|-\n|Tehran / Mehrabad\n|Combined Mil/Civ airfield; logistics; tech overhaul\n|35°41′19″N 51°18′46″E\n|Composite unit MiG-29; Su-24; Boeing 707; C-130; Fokker F27 Friendship; CH-47\n|-\n|Urmia\n|Combined Mil/Civ airfield\n|37°40′15″N 45°04′19″E\n|Composite unit helicopter / transporter aircraft\n|-\n|Zahedan\n|Combined Mil/Civ airfield\n|29°28′29″N 60°54′22″E\n|Composite unit F-4; F-5; Su-24\n|}\nA 1993 Jane’s Sentinel report listed Iran's air bases and the types of aircraft stationed at each. Mehrabad (TAB 1) was the largest, hosting a mix of fighters (F-5, F-7, F-14, MiG-29), transport planes (C-130, Il-76), and commercial jets. Other major bases included Tabriz, Shiraz, Isfahan, and Bandar Abbas, each with squadrons of U.S.- and Chinese-made fighter jets and transport aircraft. Some bases, like Ghale Morghi (TAB 11), were used for pilot training. Many aircraft types were spread across bases, including older F-4 Phantoms, F-5s, F-7s, and transport planes like the C-130.\nCommanders\n* 1923–1924, Reza Mizani\n* 1924–1930, Ahmad Nakhjavan\n* 1930–1931, Ahmad Mirza-Khosravani\n* 1931–1932, Ahmad Nakhjavan\n* 1931–1933, Sadegh Koupal\n* 1933–1937, Ahmad Nakhjavan\n* 1937–1941, Ahmad Mirza-Khosravani\n* 1941 (caretaker), Karim Buzarjomehri\n* 1942, Majid Firouz\n* 1942–1943, Mohammad Nakhjavan\n* 1943, Sharafeddin Ghahremani\n* 1943, Majid Firouz and Mir-Mohammad Mohanna (co-commanders)\n* 1943, Ahmad Nakhjavan\n* 1943, Mir-Mohammad Mohanna\n* 1943–1944, Mohammad-Hossein Firouz\n* 1946–1947, Mohammad-Hossein Amidi\n* 1947–1948, Hedayatollah Gilanshah\n* 1948–1949, Mir-Mohammad Mohanna\n* 1949–1950, Mehdi Sepahpour\n* 1950–1951, Nouri Alaei\n* 1951–1952, Mehdi Sepahpour\n* 1952–1953, Hedayatollah Gilanshah\n* 1953–1954, Mohammad Moeini\n* 1954–1957, Hedayatollah Gilanshah\n* 1957–1975, Mohammad Amir Khatami\n* 1975–1977 Fazael Tadayon\n* 1977–1979, Amir Hossein Rabii\n* 1979, Kiumars Saghafi\n* 1979, Saeed Mehdiyoun\n* 1979, Shapour Azarbarzin\n* 1979, Asghar Imanian\n* 1979–1980, Amir-Bahman Bagheri\n* 1980–1981, Javad Fakoori\n* 1981–1983, Mohammad-Hossein Moeinpour\n* 1983–1986, Houshang Seddigh\n* 1986–1995, Mansour Sattari\n* 1995–2001, Habib Baghaei\n* 2001–2004, Reza Pardis\n* 2004–2006, Karim Qavami\n* 2006–2008, Ahmad Meyghani\n* 2008–2018, Hassan Shahsafi\n* 2018–2021, Aziz Nasirzadeh\n* 2021–present, Hamid Vahedi\nAircraft\nCurrent inventory\nIranian Air Force Grumman F-14A Tomcat (remix).jpg|An F-14A Tomcat of the IRIAF\nIRIAF Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-29A (9-12A) at Dezful.jpg|A MiG-29 sits on the tarmac at Dezful Airport\nCH-47 Iran Air Force (remiex).jpg|An Iranian CH-47C Chinook\nC-130E Iran Air Force THR May 2011.jpg|An Iranian C-130E\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

In 2014, Iran was receptive to the demands and was working on refurbishing an unspecified number of jets. In late 2014, Iran returned 130 military aircraft to Iraq.\nReported future expansion plans\nIn October 2020, a 13-year long UN arms embargo imposed on Iran was lifted. However, the poor state of Iran's finances and the threat of American sanctions on those trading with Iran made it unlikely that Tehran would make large foreign orders for military equipment. In November 2023, deputy defense minister Mehdi Farahi said that plans had been finalized for the Iranian armed forces to receive Sukhoi Su-35s, Yakovlev Yak-130s and Mil Mi-28s.\nThere have been reports that the IRIAF would be interested in the following aircraft for its modernization program:\n* Su-30: In 2007, it was reported that Israeli defense officials were investigating a potential Iran–Russia deal, in which Iran would pay $1&nbsp;billion for a dozen squadrons’ worth of Su-30 jets. Iran and Russia have both denied this and have rejected these claims as propaganda. In September 2008, a dozen Su-30s were seen in a broadcast of the Mehr News Agency. The report reads: \"In this joint maneuver of the IRIAF and the AFAGIR which is called the 'Guardians of the Nations Skies' the Air Forces of Iran have tested domestically developed systems as well as newly purchased systems (from Russia and China).\" The purchase of this fighter would improve Iranian air force capability significantly, as it would be able to cover almost the entire Middle East from Iranian territory.\n* Su-35: In 2016, Iran was reportedly interested in this aircraft in order to obtain a crucial edge over its potential rivals in the region.\n* J-10: In 2007, the Russian news agency Novosti reported that Iran had signed a deal with China to buy two squadrons/24 of J-10 fighter planes, with Russian-made AL-31FN engines. The total cost of the planes is estimated at $1&nbsp;billion, and deliveries are expected between 2008 and 2010. China denied that it had agreed to sell its home-grown fighter jets to Iran, saying no talks had taken place. Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao told reporters: \"It's not true, it is an irresponsible report, China has not had talks with Iran on J-10 jets.\" In 2025, after the Iran–Israel war, the Iranian air force pushed to acquire the Chinese J-10C instead of the Russian Sukhoi Su-35 due to delays in its delivery by Russia and due to the J-10C's performance in the 2025 India–Pakistan conflict.\nFacilities\n}}\nIn the last several years several new airfields have been constructed in central- and eastern Iran. Some of these facilities have since seen full-scale deployments of IRIAF units, and it now appears that at least two became permanent \"Tactical Fighter Bases\" (TFBs). These are the first such bases established since 1979.\nExcept new airfields, with Chinese support, the IRIAF constructed a number of new early warning radar sites around Iran. Its ability to control the national airspace remains limited—mainly due to the rugged terrain and lack of airborne early warning assets.\nAside from maintaining 17 TFBs, the IRIAF operates numerous temporary detachments on several minor airfields around Iran. Ex-Iraqi Mirage F.1EQs, usually based at TFB.14, near Mashhad, were frequently seen over the Persian Gulf in 2005 and 2006.\nMajor operations\n* Iran–Iraq War\n** Operation Kaman 99, Iran's biggest air raid during the Iran–Iraq war, with a strength of more than 140 aircraft.\n** Operation Scorch Sword, a 1980 Iranian airstrike on an Iraqi nuclear reactor under construction.\n** H-3 airstrike, The IRIAF's boldest operation in Iraq.\n** Operation Morvarid, a successful joint operation by the IRIAF and the Islamic Republic of Iran Navy in the Persian Gulf against the Iraqi Air Force and Navy.\n** Operation Sultan 10, an operation to disrupt delivery of new French fighter planes to the Iraqi Air force and the associated training of personnel, during the Iran–Iraq war.\nRanks\nCommissioned officer ranks\nThe rank insignia of commissioned officers.\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n|}\nOther ranks\nThe rank insignia of Iranian non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel.\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n|}\nSee also\n* Air force history of Iran\n* F-14 Tomcat operational history\n* Iranian aerial victories during the Iran–Iraq war\n* Iraqi aerial victories during the Iran–Iraq war\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
