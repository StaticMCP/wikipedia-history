It portrays the Russian performance artist Gena Marvin, who attracts the attention of the public and the government of her country with her provocative works, in which she transforms her own body into gigantic, menacing silhouettes.\nIt had its world premiere at the South by Southwest on March 11, 2023, and was released on June 14, 2024 in United States by Greenwich Entertainment.\nThe series won a 2024 Peabody Award. It was shortlisted in Best Documentary Feature Film at the 97th Academy Awards on 17 December 2024, but was not nominated.\nContent\nGena Marvin, a queer artist hailing from a small Russian town, creates otherworldly costumes from junk and tape to protest the government in Moscow. At just 21, having grown up on the harsh streets of Magadan, a former Soviet gulag outpost, she stages radical public performances that blend art and activism. Through these often dark, strange, and evocative displays, Gena aims to challenge perceptions of beauty and queerness while highlighting the harassment faced by the LGBTQ+ community. These performances, deeply rooted in her subconscious, come at a significant personal cost.\nShe is known for her provocative works that always create a buzz. During a photo shoot with her friend, she dons a gigantic silhouette outfit. However, when she enters a grocery store in this attire, the employees ask her to leave, deeming it inappropriate and comparable to lingerie.\n}}\nThe documentary also explores her complex relationship with her grandparents, who appear to be loving toward Gena but are puzzled by her artistic and unconventional tendencies.\nCast\n* Gena Marvin\nProduction\nThe film is directed by Agnija Galdanova, who met Gena Marvin in 2019 while researching for a planned documentary.
