The diary was passed on to his son and after his death in 1995 eventually turned up at an auction in Northumberland in 2005.\nThe diaries were bought by an amateur historian, Shaun Sewell for £300. Two years later the BBC television programme The Antiques Roadshow visited Alnwick Castle in Northumberland and Sewell, who was only in the area for a cricket match, took the diaries along. They were featured on the programme and alerted the interest of 12 publishers. HarperCollins won an auction for the rights and the first volume, covering the period 1913 to 1918 was published in September 2008, with a foreword by the broadcaster and historian Andrew Marr.\nThe diaries cover the day-to-day lives of his working-class family in Glasgow, their trials and tribulations. He also records the minutiae and privations of their everyday life and the city of Glasgow. He also writes about his thoughts on the news of the day and the way they were affected by World War I. The diaries are written in a copperplate script, with some passages in Latin and French, illustrated with his own idiosyncratic drawings.\nThe paperback was released on Thursday 28 May 2009.\nIn 2010 a sequel was released called ''Tommy's Peace: A family diary 1919–1933'' written by Livingstone, covering an everyday life in the inter-war period.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080922161801/http://www.harpercollins.co.uk/Contents/Title/Pages/default.aspx?objId=41463 Official Harper Collins page]"
