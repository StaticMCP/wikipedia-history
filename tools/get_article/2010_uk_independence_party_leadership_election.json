Lord Pearson of Rannoch had been leader of the party since the previous leadership election, less than a year earlier. Jeffrey Titford was appointed interim leader during the summer by the UKIP National Executive Committee. Nigel Farage won the election with over 60% of the vote.\nCandidates\nAll candidates required support from 51 members of UKIP in order to appear on the ballot.

Gerard Batten initially intended to stand, but withdrew and gave his support to Congdon. Lord Monckton also was considering standing but decided not to run.\nResults\nNigel Farage won with 60.5% of the vote.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n! colspan=\"5\"|UK Independence Party Leadership election, 2010\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 190px\"|Candidate\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 100px\"|Votes\n! style=\"width: 40px\"| %\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n| style=\"width: 230px\" |  Nigel Farage\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|   6,085\n| align=center |\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 60.5%\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n| style=\"width: 230px\" | Tim Congdon\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 2,037\n| align=center |\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 20.3%\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n| style=\"width: 230px\" | David Campbell Bannerman\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1,404\n| align=center |\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 14.0%\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n| style=\"width: 210px\" | Winston McKenzie\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 530\n| align=center |\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 5.3%\n|-\n|-  style=\"background:#f6f6f6; text-align:right;\"\n| colspan=\"3\"|Turnout\n||  10,056\n|| 65.1%\n|- style=\"background:#f6f6f6;\"\n| colspan=\"5\"   | Nigel Farage elected as Leader\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.ukip.org Official UKIP website]\n* [http://www.timcongdon4ukip.com Tim Congdon's campaign website]"
