His co-host for the first half of the show was Porsche Lynn while Ona Zee co-hosted the last half. Randy West opened the show with a song, “We Put the X in Sex”, the lyrics of which contained names of several actors and actresses.\nSeveral other people were involved with the production of the ceremony. The live show was produced by Gary Todd while musical direction was undertaken by Mark J. Miller. A VHS videotape of the show was also published and sold by VCA Pictures, which was produced and directed by S. Marco DiMercurio.\nThere were several new categories this year, including Female Performer of the Year, Male Performer of the Year, Best Gonzo Video and Best Amateur or Pro-Am Video series.\nChameleons was announced as both the top selling movie and the top renting movie of the year.\nCritical reviews\nHustler magazine was critical of the awards, pointing out the Best Marketing Campaign award went to a video that wasn't released in 1992, and adding, “No matter. The AVN show isn't about accuracy. The annual exercise is a tuxedo-clad circle-jerk from AVN to all its advertisers. The joke is watching so many smut peddlers and performers take it seriously.”\nCheri magazine was more charitable, calling the awards “the porn industry's biggest party of the year.”\nSee also\n* AVN Award for Best Actress\n* AVN Award for Best Supporting Actress\n* AVN Award for Male Foreign Performer of the Year\n* AVN Award for Male Performer of the Year\n* AVN Award for Female Foreign Performer of the Year\n* AVN Female Performer of the Year Award\n* List of members of the AVN Hall of Fame\nNotes\nRandy Spears was announced as the winner of Best Supporting Actor—Film in VCA Pictures' VHS videotape of the awards show, and a clip featuring him in The Secret Garden is shown. Cheri magazine also reported Spears as the winner of this category. However, Adult Video News magazine reported that the category was won by Joey Silvera for his role in Face Dance, Parts 1 & 2. AVN has repeated this in its lists of past winners published online and in subsequent awards show official programs. AVN did not report whether an error was made at the show, so it may be an error in their publications.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Adult_Video_News_Awards/ Adult Video News Awards]  at the Internet Movie Database\n*\n*\n*"
