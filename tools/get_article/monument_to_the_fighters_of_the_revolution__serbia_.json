It is dedicated to the National Hero of Yugoslavia Stevan Filipović and to the Partisan fighters from the Valjevo region who fought in the National Liberation War during World War II.\nThe monument was inspired by a famous photograph capturing Filipović’s final moments, in which he defiantly raised his fists and addressed the gathered crowd before his execution on 22 May 1942. The sculpture was created by the Serbian sculptor Vojin Bakić.\nSituated on the plateau of Vidrak Hill overlooking the city of Valjevo, the monument dominates the surrounding landscape and is visible from the town below. The area around the monument has been landscaped as a memorial park. Before its construction, the site was home to an old municipal and military cemetery, where soldiers and hospital staff who died from typhus during the early years of World War I had been buried. Several of these older gravestones remain visible near the monument today.\nBakić’s work was officially unveiled on 23 October 1960. It is protected as a cultural monument. From an artistic standpoint, this sculpture marks a significant stage in Bakić’s creative development, following his break with socialist realism. It reflects his transition toward abstraction, characterized by the crystallization of form and an exploration of cubist principles. The Monument to Stevan Filipović is considered one of the artist’s most iconic and influential works.\nReferences"
