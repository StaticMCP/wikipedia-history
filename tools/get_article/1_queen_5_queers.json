A revival of the 2009-2014 MTV Canada series 1 Girl 5 Gays, the series features a panel of LGBTQ people talking about LGBTQ issues, moderated by drag queen Brooke Lynn Hytes. According to Hytes, the series represents a broader and more diverse array of participants than the original, which focused almost entirely on the perspectives of gay men.\nThe series debuted on December 9, 2021. Panelists appearing on the series have included choreographer Hollywood Jade, comedian Tricia Black, actor and athlete Harrison Browne, fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi, advocate and dancer Raymond Johnson-Brown, and musician and writer Our Lady J.\nReferences"
