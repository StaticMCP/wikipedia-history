In the , Kings Creek had a population of 55 people.\nGeography\nThe creek Kings Creek enters the locality from the north-east (Nobby / Nevilton) and flows south-west across the locality, exiting to the south-west (Ryeford / Clifton); it is a tributary of the Condamine River.\nThe Felton Clifton Road enters locality from the north (Nobby) and exits to the south (Clifton). The South Western railway line runs immediately east and parallel to the road. The district was once served by the now-closed Kings Creek railway station which was immediately north of the crossing of the line over the creek ().\nThe land is relatively flat and the land use is predominantly crop growing with some grazing on native vegetation.\nHistory\nThe locality takes its name from the creek, which was named after pastoralist Joseph King of the Pilton and Clifton pastoral runs during the  1840s.\nIn September 1883, tenders are called for the erection of a provisional school in King's Creek. King's Creek Provisional School opened on 4 February 1884. In November 1900, it became King's Creek State School. It closed on 30 April 1931. It was on the eastern side of the road and railway (approx ).\nAn undated map shows allotments for sale in the township of King's Creek (), situated on the \"Clifton Estate\". The allotments were adjacent to the South-Western railway line, close to King's Creek railway station, and the watercourse King's Creek. In June 1885, all of the allotments at the new township of King's Creek were sold but there was limited interest in the farm sites outside the town as the prices were thought to be too high. The township failed to develop; that land is now used for farming.\nIn December 1906, a Methodist church was opened at Kings Creek.\nKings Creek has a history of fossil finds over the years. In 1936, a prehistoric jaw bone was found. In 2013, a late Pleistocene tooth was found in 2013 and attributed to Quinkana (an extinct species of crocodile). It was most similar to fragmentary teeth from Quinkana foritrostrum, but was not attributed to any species because of a lack of complete specimens.\nDemographics\nIn the , Kings Creek had a population of 72 people.\nIn the , Kings Creek had a population of 55 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Kings Creek. The nearest government primary schools are Nobby State School in neighbouring Nobby to the north and Clifton State School in neighbouring Clifton to the south.
