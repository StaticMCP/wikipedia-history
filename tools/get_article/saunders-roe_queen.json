It was intended for the carriage of passengers on intercontinental flights, especially between Great Britain and Australia. No prototype was built because of a lack of funding.\nDesign and development\nBefore the Second World War, the British aircraft manufacturer Saunders-Roe (often known as Saro) had initiated plans for transatlantic seaplanes. In 1939 the firm planned a machine of 85 to 90 tons, but the start of the war altered priorities.\nWhen Saro resumed in 1943, the studies had grown to 150 tons and ultimately became the Saunders-Roe Princess, of which only three were built.\nDespite this failure, Saro was contacted by J. Dundas Meenan, consulting engineer from the firm Heenan, Winn & Steel, on behalf of the Peninsular & Oriental (P & O) shipping company. He was interested in a plane that could carry at least 1,000 passengers under the conditions of comfort of an ocean liner. Saro proposed project P.192, a 670-ton seaplane powered by 24 Rolls-Royce RB.80 Conway jet engines with  of thrust each. The aircraft was designed to have flown at a cruising speed of  and an altitude between . Its range would have been . The route between London and Sydney had already been planned, via Cairo, Karachi, Calcutta, Singapore and Darwin (Australia).\nThe fuselage would have had 5 decks with passengers divided into 6 person compartments with seats that could convert into berths for the night, in a similar fashion to railway carriages. First class passengers would have had their own bars, dining rooms and washrooms. A galley would have served all decks via freight elevator. The crew was to have consisted of 7 flight crews with their own rest quarters, and 40 cabin crew, as well as a steward as on a liner.\nThe engines were installed away from the hull to avoid spray ingestion on takeoff and landing. They were to have been supplied with air\nthrough intakes in the leading edge of the wing during flight, and another set of intakes on the top of the wing while on the water.\nWater rudders facilitated manoeuvring on the water.\nNeither P & O nor the government were willing to finance the project, it did not go beyond the stage of the drawing board.\nSpecifications (Queen)\n|prime units?=imp\n|genhide=\n|crew= 7 crew and 40 cabin stewards\n|capacity= 1,000 passengers\n|length m=\n|length ft=318\n|length in=\n|length note=\n|span m=\n|span ft=313\n|span in=\n|span note=\n|height m=\n|height ft=55\n|height in=9\n|height note=\n|wing area sqm=\n|wing area sqft=5,019\n|wing area note=\n|aspect ratio=\n|airfoil=\n|empty weight kg=\n|empty weight lb=\n|empty weight note=\n|gross weight kg=\n|gross weight lb=\n|gross weight note=\n|max takeoff weight kg=\n|max takeoff weight lb=1500500\n|max takeoff weight note=\n|fuel capacity=\n|more general=\n|eng1 number=24\n|eng1 name=Rolls-Royce Conway\n|eng1 type=turbofan engines\n|eng1 kw=\n|eng1 hp=\n|eng1 shp=\n|eng1 kn=\n|eng1 lbf=18500\n|eng1 note=\n|perfhide=\n|max speed kmh=\n|max speed mph=\n|max speed kts=\n|max speed note=\n|cruise speed kmh=720\n|cruise speed mph=\n|cruise speed kts=\n|cruise speed note=at\n|stall speed kmh=\n|stall speed mph=\n|stall speed kts=\n|stall speed note=\n|never exceed speed kmh=\n|never exceed speed mph=\n|never exceed speed kts=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|minimum control speed kmh=\n|minimum control speed mph=\n|minimum control speed kts=\n|minimum control speed note=\n|range km=4800\n|range miles=\n|range nmi=\n|range note=\n|ferry range km=\n|ferry range miles=\n|ferry range nmi=\n|ferry range note=\n|endurance=\n|ceiling m=12200\n|ceiling ft=\n|ceiling note=absolute\n|g limits=\n|roll rate=\n|glide ratio=\n|climb rate ms=\n|climb rate ftmin=\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude=\n|wing loading kg/m2=\n|wing loading lb/sqft=\n|wing loading note=\n|disk loading kg/m2=\n|fuel consumption kg/km=\n|fuel consumption lb/mi=\n|power/mass=\n|thrust/weight=\n|more performance=\n|avionics=\n}}\nReferences\n*James Gilbert: Meistens flogen sie doch; Schweizer Verlagshaus Zürich 1978 (Seiten 221–223)."
