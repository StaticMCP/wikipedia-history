      "text": "# Lullay, mine liking\n\n, Oxfordshire.]]\n\"Lullay, mine liking\" is a Middle English lyric poem or carol of the 15th century which frames a narrative describing an encounter of the Nativity with a song sung by the Virgin Mary to the infant Christ. The refrain is an early example of an English lullaby; the term \"lullaby\" is thought to originate with the \"lu lu\" or \"la la\" sound made by mothers or nurses to calm children, and \"by\" or \"bye bye\", another lulling sound (for example in the similarly ancient Coventry Carol).\nThere are a number of surviving medieval English verses associated with the birth of Jesus which take the form of a lullaby, of which this is probably the most famous example. Written by an anonymous hand, the text is found uniquely in Sloane MS 2593, a collection of medieval lyrics now held in the British Library.\nOriginally intended to be sung, no evidence of the work's musical setting survives, and since its rediscovery and the musical possibilities suggested by the text have led to diverse interpretations by numerous composers including Philip Stopford, Edgar Pettman, Peter Warlock, R. R. Terry, Gustav Holst, Ronald Corp, David Willcocks, Philip Lawson, Thomas Hewitt Jones, and Richard Rodney Bennett.\nThese are sometimes titled \"I saw a fair maiden\" whereas \"Myn Lyking\" is used in the versions by R.R. Terry and Ronald Corp (as the first of the latter's Three Medieval Carols).\nText\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=\"370\"|Middle English original spelling\n!width=\"370\"|Middle English converted\n!width=\"370\"|English modernisation\n|-\n|Refrain\nLullay, myn lykyng, my dere sone, myn swetyng,\nLullay, my dere herte, myn owyn dere derlyng.\n|\nRefrain\nLullay, mine Liking, my dere sone, mine sweting,\nLullay, my dere herte, mine own dere derling.\n|\nRefrain\nLullay, mine Liking, my dear Son, mine Sweeting,\nLullay, my dear heart, mine own dear darling.\n|-\n|\nI saw a fayr maydyn syttyn and synge,\nSche lullyd a lytyl chyld, a swete lordyng,\nRefrain\n|\nI saw a fair maiden, sitten and singe,\nSche lulled a litel child, a swete lording.\nRefrain\n|\nI saw a fair maiden, sitting and sing,\nShe lulled a little child a sweet lording:\nRefrain\n|-\n|\nThat eche lord is that that made alle thinge,\nOf alle lordis he is lord, of alle kynges kyng.\nRefrain\n|\nThat eche lord is that that made alle thinge;\nOf alle lordes he is Lord, of alle Kinges king.\nRefrain\n|\nThat very lord is He that made all things\nOf all lords He is Lord (and) King of all king.\nRefrain\n|-\n|\nTher was mekyl melody at that chyldes berthe,\nAlle tho wern in hevene blys thei made mekyl merthe,\nRefrain\n|\nThere was mekel melody at that childes berthe;\nAlle tho wern in hevene bliss, they made mekel merthe.\nRefrain\n|\nThere was mickle (much) melody at that Child's birth,\nAll that were in heaven's bliss, they made mickle mirth.\nRefrain\n|-\n|\nAungelebryt thei song that nyt and seydyn to that chyld,\n\"Blyssid be thou, and so be sche that is bothe mek and myld\".\nRefrain\n|\nAungele bright they song that night, and seiden to that child,\n\"Blessed be thou, and so be sche that is bothe meke and mild.\"\nRefrain\n|\nAngels bright they sang that night and saiden to that Child,\n\"Blessed be Thou, and so be she that is both meek and mild.\"\nRefrain\n|-\n|\nPrey we now to that chyld, and to his moder dere,\nGrawnt hem his blyssyng that now makyn chere.\nRefrain\n|\nPrey we now to that child, and to his moder dere,\nGraunt hem his blessing that now maken chere.\nRefrain\n|\nPray we now to that Child, and to His mother dear,\nGrant them His blessing that now maken cheer.\nRefrain\n|}\nSee also\n* List of Christmas carols\nReferences"
