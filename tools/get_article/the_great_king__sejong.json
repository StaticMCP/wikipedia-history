Considered the greatest king in Korean history, Sejong created Hangul, the Korean alphabet. The series aired on KBS from January 5 to December 7, 2008, on Saturdays and Sundays at 21:30 for 86 episodes. Episodes 1 to 26 aired on KBS1, and episodes 27 to 86 aired on KBS2.\nPlot\nBorn as the third son, Chungnyeong was far from ascending the throne. His early years were turbulent as Joseon faced political tensions from both within and abroad. Eventually, the young prince finds himself living in a private residence outside of the palace and experiences the everyday life of commoners until he is a young man. After his ascension to the throne, Chungyeong (now called King Sejong) stabilizes the newly born country and gives rise to a blooming culture. In the process he invents Hangul, the Korean writing system.\nCast\nMain\n*Kim Sang-kyung as Grand Prince Chungnyeong / King Sejong the Great\n**Kim Do-hyun as child Grand Prince Chungnyeong\n**Lee Hyun-woo as young Grand Prince Chungnyeong\n*Kim Young-chul as King Taejong;
