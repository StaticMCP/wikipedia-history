An application (app, application program, software application) is any program that can be categorized as application software. Application is a subjective classification that is often used to differentiate from system and utility software. such as snapchat\nThe abbreviation app became popular with the 2008 introduction of the iOS App Store, to refer to applications for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Later, with the release of the Mac App Store in 2010 and the Windows Store in 2011, it began to be used to refer to end-user software in general, regardless of platform.\nApplications may be bundled with the computer and its system software or published separately. Applications may be proprietary or open-source.\nTerminology\nMeaning program and software\nWhen used as an adjective, application can have a broader meaning than that described in this article. For example, concepts such as application programming interface (API), application server, application virtualization, application lifecycle management and portable application refer to programs and software in general.\nDistinction between system and application software\nThe distinction between system and application software is subjective and has been the subject of controversy. For example, one of the key questions in the United States v. Microsoft Corp. antitrust trial was whether Microsoft's Internet Explorer web browser was part of its Windows operating system or a separate piece of application software.  As another example, the GNU/Linux naming controversy is, in part, due to disagreement about the relationship between the Linux kernel and the operating systems built over this kernel. In some types of embedded systems, the application software and the operating system software may be indistinguishable by the user, as in the case of software used to control a VCR, DVD player, or microwave oven. The above definitions may exclude some applications that may exist on some computers in large organizations. For an alternative definition of an app:  see Application Portfolio Management.\nKiller application\nA killer application (killer app, coined in the late 1980s) is an application that is so popular that it causes demand for its host platform to increase. For example, VisiCalc was the first modern spreadsheet software for the Apple II and helped sell the then-new personal computers into offices. For the BlackBerry, it was its email software.\nSoftware suite\nAs software suite consists of multiple applications bundled together. They usually have related functions, features, and user interfaces, and may be able to interact with each other, e.g. open each other's files. Business applications often come in suites, e.g. Microsoft Office, LibreOffice and iWork, which bundle together a word processor, a spreadsheet, etc.; but suites exist for other purposes, e.g. graphics or music.\nWays to classify\nAs there so many applications and since their attributes vary so dramatically, there are many different ways to classify them.\nBy legal aspects\nProprietary software is protected under an exclusive copyright, and a software license grants limited usage rights. Such applications may allow add-ons from third parties.\nFree and open-source software (FOSS) can be run, distributed, sold, and extended for any purpose. FOSS software released under a free license may be perpetual and also royalty-free. Perhaps, the owner, the holder or third-party enforcer of any right (copyright, trademark, patent, or ius in re aliena) are entitled to add exceptions, limitations, time decays or expiring dates to the license terms of use.\nPublic-domain software is a type of FOSS that is royalty-free and can be run, distributed, modified, reversed, republished, or created in derivative works without any copyright attribution and therefore revocation. It can even be sold, but without transferring the public domain property to other single subjects. Public-domain software can be released under a (un)licensing legal statement, which enforces those terms and conditions for an indefinite duration (for a lifetime, or forever).\nBy platform\nAn application can be categorized by the host  platform on which it runs. Notable platforms include operating system (native), web browser, cloud computing and mobile. For example a web application runs in a web browser whereas a more traditional, native application runs in the environment of a computer's operating system.\nThere has been a contentious debate regarding web applications replacing native applications for many purposes, especially on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Web apps have indeed greatly increased in popularity for some uses, but the advantages of applications make them unlikely to disappear soon, if ever. Furthermore, the two can be complementary, and even integrated.\nHorizontal vs. vertical\nApplication software can be seen as either horizontal or vertical.  Horizontal applications are more popular and widespread, because they are general purpose, for example word processors or databases. Vertical applications are niche products, designed for a particular type of industry or business, or department within an organization. Integrated suites of software will try to handle every specific aspect possible of, for example, manufacturing or banking worker, accounting, or customer service.\nBy purpose\nThere are many types of application software:\n; Enterprise: Addresses the needs of an entire organization's processes and data flows, across several departments, often in a large distributed environment.  Examples include enterprise resource planning systems, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, data replication engines, and supply chain management software. Departmental Software is a sub-type of enterprise software with a focus on smaller organizations or groups within a large organization. (Examples include travel expense management and IT Helpdesk.)\n; Enterprise infrastructure: Provides common capabilities needed to support enterprise software systems. (Examples include databases, email servers, and systems for managing networks and security.)\n; Application platform as a service (aPaaS): A cloud computing service that offers development and deployment environments for application services.\n; Knowledge worker: Lets users create and manage information, often for individual projects within a department, in contrast to enterprise management. Examples include time management, resource management, analytical, collaborative and documentation tools. Word processors, spreadsheets, email and blog clients, personal information systems, and individual media editors may aid in multiple information worker tasks.\n; Content access: Used primarily to access content without editing, but may include software that allows for content editing. Such software addresses the needs of individuals and groups to consume digital entertainment and published digital content. (Examples include media players, web browsers, and help browsers.)\n; Educational: Related to content access software, but has the content or features adapted for use by educators or students. For example, it may deliver evaluations (tests), track progress through material, or include collaborative capabilities.\n;  Simulation: Simulates physical or abstract systems for either research, training, or entertainment purposes.\n; Media development: Generates print and electronic media for others to consume, most often in a commercial or educational setting. This includes graphic-art software, desktop publishing software, multimedia development software, HTML editors, digital-animation editors, digital audio and video composition, and many others.\n; Engineering: Used in developing hardware and software products. This includes computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided engineering (CAE), computer language editing and compiling tools, integrated development environments, and application programmer interfaces.\n; Entertainment: Refers to video games, screen savers, programs to display motion pictures or play recorded music, and other forms of entertainment which can be experienced through the use of a computing device.\nTaxonomy\nThis section is a taxonomy of application types with each section a grouping of application purpose.\nInformation worker\n* Accounting software\n* Data management\n** Contact manager\n** Spreadsheet\n** Database software\n* Documentation\n** Document automation\n** Word processor\n** Desktop publishing software\n** Diagramming software\n** Presentation software\n** Email\n** Blog software\n* Enterprise resource planning\n* Financial software\n** Banking software\n** Clearing systems\n** Financial accounting software\n** Financial software\n* Field service management\n**Workforce management software\n* Project management software\n** Calendaring software\n** Employee scheduling software\n** Workflow software\n* Reservation systems\nEntertainment\n* Screen savers\n* Video games\n** Arcade video games\n** Console games\n** Mobile games\n** Personal computer games\n* Software art\n** Demo\n*** 64K intro\nEducational\n* Classroom management\n* Reference software\n* Sales readiness software\n* Survey management\n* Encyclopedia software\nEnterprise infrastructure\n* Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps)\n* Business workflow software\n* Database management system (DBMS)\n* Digital asset management (DAM) software\n* Document management software\n* Geographic information system (GIS)\nSimulation\n* Computer simulators\n** Scientific simulators\n** Social simulators\n** Battlefield simulators\n** Emergency simulators\n** Vehicle simulators\n*** Flight simulators\n*** Driving simulators\n** Simulation games\n*** Vehicle simulation games\nMedia development\n* 3D computer graphics software\n* Animation software\n* Graphic art software\n** Raster graphics editor\n** Vector graphics editor\n* Image organizer\n* Video editing software\n* Audio editing software\n** Digital audio workstation\n* Music sequencer\n** Scorewriter\n* HTML editor\n* Game development tool\nHardware engineering\n* Computer-aided engineering\n* Computer-aided design (CAD)\n* Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM)\n* Finite element analysis\nSoftware development\nMuch of the software used to develop software is classified as utility instead of application software, but classification of types of programs is subjective.\n* Integrated development environment\n* Game development tool\n* License manager\n* Version control\nSee also\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
