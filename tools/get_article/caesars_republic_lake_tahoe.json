It has 742 rooms and suites as well as six restaurants and a casino with  of space. It also has a video arcade, wedding chapel, pool, convention center and a full-service health club. It is owned by Vici Properties and operated by Caesars Entertainment.\nHistory\nHarvey's was originally opened in 1944 and operated by Sacramento meat wholesaler Harvey Gross and his wife Llewellyn. They opened the first high rise tower and an 11-story, 197-room hotel in Nevada just across the state line from South Lake Tahoe, California in 1963.\nThe hotel suffered an explosion from a bomb on August 27, 1980, that left a crater three stories deep when it was detonated by the FBI. (The area around the hotel had been cleared and no one was injured.)  The bomb caused an estimated $18&nbsp;million ($&nbsp;million in ) in damages.  Parts of Harvey's casino reopened within 48 hours, and the fully repaired and renovated hotel reopened in May 1981. The bomb was placed by John Birges, a heavily in-debt Fresno landscaper who had lost at least $1&nbsp;million at casinos in Stateline and was hoping to extort $3&nbsp;million from the bomb threat. He was convicted and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, where he died from liver cancer in 1996.\nIn 1983, Harvey Gross died at the age of 78; however, the company continued to operate under family management. In 1985, Harveys sold Harvey's Inn, northeast of Stateline, which reopened as the Lakeside Inn. The 18-story, $74&nbsp;million, glass \"Lake Tower\" opened in 1986, the same year the trademark \"Wagon Wheel\" was replaced on the 11-story tower with the current Harveys brand.\nIn early 1992, Harveys entered a bidding war with Hilton Hotels Corporation over the right to buy Bally's Reno, which opened on May 3, 1978, as MGM Grand Reno (now Grand Sierra Resort). Harveys announced an agreement on a $71&nbsp;million deal, only to see Hilton up the ante to $73&nbsp;million and assumption of Bally's debt. Several weeks later, after considering even higher bids, a federal bankruptcy court settled the matter by approving Hilton's final $83&nbsp;million offer.\nAfter going public on February 15, 1994, Harveys began new projects including a joint venture with Hard Rock America for an $80&nbsp;million casino in Las Vegas, which it later sold its interest in 1997 and then a casino resort in Central City, Colorado. A riverboat casino-convention center in Council Bluffs, Iowa, followed in early 1996.\nIn the late 1990s, Bill Cosby was signed on as the spokesman for Harveys.  This included putting the actor's likeness on several of the casino chips and recording several specials at the casino.\nIn 1999, Colony Capital bought a controlling interest in Harveys Casino Resorts. Harveys announced on April 24, 2001, that it would be acquired by Harrah's Entertainment (later Caesars Entertainment) for $625&nbsp;million.\nOn October 6, 2017, ownership of the property was transferred to Vici Properties as part of a corporate spin-off, and it was leased back to Caesars Entertainment.\nOn July 1, 2025, Harveys Lake Tahoe will be branded as Caesars Republic Lake Tahoe.The current $160 million renovation. Guests will see changes to the casino floor, hotel lobby and other areas with new carpeting, lighting, tables, chairs and digital displays. The resort is also remodeling all of the rooms in the Remus Tower and will introduce butler service for select suites in both of the hotel towers. The renovations at Caesars Republic Lake Tahoe will complete in mid-2026.\nReferences\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*"
