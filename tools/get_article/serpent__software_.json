It is under development at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland since 2004.  Serpent was originally known as Probabilistic Scattering Game (PSG) from 2004 to the first pre-release of Serpent 1 in October 2008. The development of Serpent 2 was started in 2010. The current stable version Serpent 2.2.0 was released in May 2022.\nSerpent was originally developed to be a simplified neutron transport code for reactor physics applications. Its main focus was on group constant generation with two-dimensional lattice calculations. Burnup calculation capability was included early on. Nowadays Serpent is used in a wide range of applications from the group constant generation to coupled multi-physics applications, fusion neutronics and radiation shielding. In addition to the original neutron transport capabilities, Serpent is able to perform photon transport.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://serpent.vtt.fi/serpent/ Official website]\n* [https://serpent.vtt.fi/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page On-line user manual of Serpent 2]\n* [https://serpent.vtt.fi/serpent/publications.htm List of publications related to Serpent]"
