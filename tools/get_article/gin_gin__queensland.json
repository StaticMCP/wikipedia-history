In the , the locality of Gin Gin had a population of 1,139 people.\nGeography\nGin Gin is located on the Bruce Highway, approximately 51&nbsp;km west of Bundaberg and 370&nbsp;km north-west of Brisbane, the state capital.\nBundaberg–Gin Gin Road (State Route 3) runs east from the Bruce Highway, and Gin Gin–Mount Perry–Monto Road runs west from the highway.\nHistory\nGureng Gureng (also known as Gooreng Gooreng, Goreng Goreng, Goeng, Gurang, Goorang Goorang, Korenggoreng) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Gureng Gureng people. The Gooreng Gooreng language region includes the towns of Bundaberg, Gin Gin and Miriam Vale extending south towards Childers, inland to Monto and Mt Perry.\nThe town name Gin Gin may have derived from a local Aboriginal word, possibly from the Kabi \"kwin kwin\", or \"chin chin\" (a scrub), or \"gwin gwin\" (red soil).\nEuropean settlement of the region began in 1848 when Gregory Blaxland Jnr (son of the explorer Gregory Blaxland) together with William Forster brought their flocks of sheep up from their squatting leases on the Clarence River. The pastoral run they selected extended all the way to the coast and they called it Tirroan. The modern town of Gin Gin is located close to where the original homestead was constructed. The local Aboriginal people murdered Blaxland in August 1850 and two shepherd boys the year previously. Two large massacres of Aboriginal people were conducted by local squatters and their stockmen as punitive measures for these deaths.\nAbout 1851, Arthur and Alfred Henry Brown bought Tirroan from William Forster and renamed the run Gin Gin. The Brown Brothers previously owned a pastoral property called Gin Gin in Western Australia.\nThe run was later purchased by Sir Thomas McIlwraith, who was Premier of Queensland three times between 1879 and 1893.\nThe Gin Gin district is nicknamed Wild Scotsman Country due to the capture of one of Queensland's few bushrangers, James Alpin McPherson, in the area on 30 March 1866. McPherson, who went by the same nickname, was captured at Monduran Station,  north of town.\nGin Gin Post Office opened on 15 March 1875.\nThe town was first surveyed in 1880.\nGin Gin Provisional School opened on 26 June 1882.

Gin Gin State Pre-School opened on 25 October 1977 and closed in 2006 when it was absorbed into Gin Gin State School.\nIn 1887, 8,900 ha of land were resumed from the Gin Gin pastoral run. The land was offered for selection for the establishment of small farms on 17 April 1887.\nThe Gin Gin Library opened in 1992.\nDemographics\nAt the , Gin Gin had a population of 892.\nIn the , Gin Gin had a population of 1,190 people.\nIn the , the locality of Gin Gin had a population of 1,053 people.\nIn the , the locality of Gin Gin had a population of 1,139 people.\nHeritage listings\nGin Gin has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* Mulgrave Street: Gin Gin railway station\n*Northern corner of Village Lane and Kookaburra Park Drive, Kookaburra Park Eco Village (): Allen Brothers' Slab Hut\nEconomy\nGin Gin, like Bundaberg, is heavily dependent on the sugar industry, with sugarcane plantations dotted throughout the area.
