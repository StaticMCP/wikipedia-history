It flourished from 5000 to 4000 BC, ending with phase IV, e.g., in Bohemia represented by the 'Jordanow/Jordansmühler culture'. It is followed by the Funnelbeaker culture/TrB culture and the Baden culture. The eponymous type site is at Lengyel in Tolna county, Hungary.\nDescription\n, reconstruction|225x225px]]\nThe Lengyel culture was preceded by the Linear Pottery culture and succeeded by the Corded Ware culture. In its northern extent, overlapped the somewhat later but otherwise approximately contemporaneous Funnelbeaker culture. Also closely related are the Stroke-ornamented ware and Rössen cultures, adjacent to the north and west, respectively.\nSubgroups of the Lengyel horizon include the Austrian/Moravian Painted Ware I and II, Aichbühl, Jordanów/Jordanov/Jordansmühl, Schussenried, Gatersleben, etc.\nIt is a wide interaction sphere or cultural horizon rather than an archaeological culture in the narrow sense.\nIts distribution overlaps with the Tisza culture and with Stroke-Ornamented Pottery (STK) as far north as Osłonki, central Poland.\nLengyel pottery was found in western Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Poland, and Slovenia. Several Sopot culture finds in Croatia and Hungary were dated to the same general periods as the Lengyel culture finds.\nInfluence in pottery styles is found even further afield, in parts of Germany and Switzerland.\nAgriculture and stock raising (mainly cattle, but also pigs, and to a lesser extent, ovicaprids) was practiced, though many wild faunal remains have also been recovered. Settlements consisted of small houses as well as trapezoid longhouses. These settlements were sometimes open, sometimes surrounded by a defensive ditch.\nThe Lengyel people also practiced mining. A 2025 archaelogical study of a chert mining field in the Krumlov Forest of the Czech Republic, one of the largest in Europe, reported the graves of two adult sisters and an infant within a mine shaft. The women's skeletons bore signs of vertebral degeneration and early arthritis consistent with the heavy labor associated with mining.\nInhumation was in separate cemeteries, in the flexed position with apparently no preference for which side the deceased was laid out in.\nLengyel sites of the later period show signs of the use of copper in form of beads and hammered ribbons, marking the dawn of the Chalcolithic period in Central Europe.\nIt was associated with the cover-term Old Europe by Marija Gimbutas, though may have been undergone \"kurganization\" by the Proto-Indo-Europeans and become integrated into the successor Globular Amphora culture.\nArchaeogenetics\nAccording to archaeogenetic studies, its population had no or negligible amount of Indo-European steppe ancestry.\nLipson et al. (2017), Narasimshan et al. (2019) and Patterson et al. (2022) detected in nine individuals from Hungary ascribed to the Lengyel culture the Y-Haplogroups H, H-P96, I2a2a-S6635, I2a1a1b-S21825, G2a2a1-PF3148, J2a1a2b-Z6055, C1a2-V86, and E1b1b1a1b1-L618. mtDNA extracted were various subclades of U8b1a2b, N1a1a, T2b, H and H44, J1c, W1. According to ADMIXTURE analysis they had approximately 85-98% Early European Farmers, 4-12% Western Hunter-Gatherer and 0-3% Western Steppe Herders-related ancestry.\nGallery\nFile:Moravian painted pottery.jpg|Lengyel painted pottery sherds\nFile:Museum Quintana - Lengyelkultur Gefäß.jpg|Lengyel pottery.\nFile:Linz Schlossmuseum - Lengyel-Kultur Gefäß.jpg|Lengyel pottery\nFile:Neolithic pottery, Museum of Western Bohemia, 187697.jpg|Lengyel pottery\nFile:Oslonki burial with copper goods, Lengyel culture.jpg|Burial with copper items, Oslonki, Poland, 4100 BC\nFile:020210808 Neolithic copper ax, 4150-3500 BC, Danubian culture, Kraków Zakrzów.jpg|Copper axe, Poland,  BC\nFile:Mitteleuropäische Neolithische Keramik aus 4500 v.
