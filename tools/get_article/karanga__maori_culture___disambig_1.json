It is an exchange of calls that forms part of the pōwhiri, a Māori welcoming ceremony. It takes place as a visiting group moves onto the marae or into the formal meeting area. Karanga are carried out almost exclusively by women and in Māori language, and are initiated by the tangata whenua or hosts, and responded to by the visitors.\nKaranga follow a particular format in keeping with protocol. This includes exchanging greetings, paying tribute to the dead (especially those who have most recently died), and referring to the reason for the groups' coming together. It has an important function in building connections between tangata whenua and manuhiri (guests), and setting the agenda for the gathering.The karanga continuously strengthens the relationship between the physical and spiritual realms...
