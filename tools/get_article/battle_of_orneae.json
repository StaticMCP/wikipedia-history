The stronghold was left with a strong garrison that they then ordered to harass Argolis.\nAfter the withdrawal of the Spartan army, the Athenians sent a force of 40 triremes and 1,200 hoplites to aid the city of Argos in expelling the garrison and taking the city.\nThe Argive/Athenian army then took Orneae by storm, both taking the city and being able to expel the garrison, and execute some of the exiles. The rest were driven out from the city of Orneae.\nReferences"
