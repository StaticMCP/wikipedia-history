The award is sponsored by the Canadian Organization for Development through Education (CODE), a Canadian charitable organization devoted to literacy and education, and philanthropist William Burt, and administered by the Canada Council. Several other organizations, including the Assembly of First Nations, the Métis National Council, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the National Association of Friendship Centres and the Association of Canadian Publishers, are also involved in the award's administration.\nAnnounced in 2012, the award was presented for the first time in 2013.\nThe award presents a first prize of $12,000, a second prize of $8,000 and a third prize of $5,000 annually. In addition to the prize money, CODE purchases 2,500 copies of each of the prize-winning titles, for free distribution to indigenous community libraries, schools and community centres across Canada as part of the foundation's literacy program.\nIn June 2019, CODE announced that in addition to the existing award for English language literature, it will be expanded to incorporate a second award for works published in indigenous languages.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n!Year\n!Category\n!Author\n!Title\n!Result\n!Ref.\n|-style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n! rowspan=\"3\" |2013\n! rowspan=\"3\" |\n|\n|Indian Horse\n|Winner\n|\n|-\n|\n|As I Remember It\n|Second\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|As Long As the Rivers Flow\n|Third\n|-style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n! rowspan=\"3\" |2014\n! rowspan=\"3\" |\n|\n|Tilly, a Story of Hope and Resilience\n|Winner\n|\n|-\n|\n|The Inconvenient Indian: A Curious Account of Native People in North America\n|Second\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|They Called Me Number One\n|Third\n|-style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n! rowspan=\"3\" |2015\n! rowspan=\"3\" |\n| and Sean Qitsualik-Tinsley\n|Skraelings: Arctic Moon Magick\n|Winner\n|\n|-\n|\n|Grey Eyes\n|Second\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|Lightfinder\n|Third\n|-style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |2016\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n|  and Kelly Mellings\n|The Outside Circle\n|Winner\n|\n|-\n| and David Carpenter\n|The Education of Augie Merasty\n|Honour\n|\n|-style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n! rowspan=\"3\" |2017\n! rowspan=\"3\" |\n|\n|The Break\n|Winner\n|\n|-\n|\n|The Mask That Sang\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Finalist\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|Those Who Run in the Sky\n|-style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n! rowspan=\"3\" |2018\n! rowspan=\"3\" |\n|\n|The Marrow Thieves\n|Winner\n|\n|-\n|\n|Fire Song\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Honour\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n| and Monique Gray Smith\n|The Journey Forward: Two Novellas on Reconciliation\n|-style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n! rowspan=\"6\" |2019\n! rowspan=\"3\" |English Language\n|\n|Moccasin Square Gardens\n|Winner\n|\n|-\n|\n|The Case of Windy Lake\n|Honour\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|Those Who Dwell Below\n|Finalist\n|-style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Indigenous Language\n| with Soloman Ratt (trans.)\n|Inconvenient Skin\n|Winner\n|\n|-\n| with Blandina Tulugarjuk (Inuktitut trans.)\n|Those Who Run in the Sky\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Finalist\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n| with K.
