Introduction\nClimate change is one of the global challenges of the 21st century, profoundly reshaping ecosystems, economies, and societies. Extreme weather events are becoming increasingly frequent and severe, disrupting the stability of traditional risk management mechanisms and putting enormous pressure on the insurance market (Tucker, 1997). As climate risks exceed predictable thresholds, many regions and industries face the possibility of ineffective insurance coverage, raising urgent questions about agricultural resilience, industrial stability, and the evolving role of government in managing systemic risks (Cole & Xiong, 2017).\nAgriculture is particularly vulnerable as crop yields, livestock production, and overall food security largely depend on stable climate conditions (Mârza et al., 2015). Insurance has long been a core tool for farmers and agricultural conglomerates, providing a buffer against volatility and enabling people to access credit (Kostyuchenko et al., 2015). However, the increase in premiums and underwriting restrictions have increasingly weakened the feasibility of insurance as a safety net (Fraisse et al., 2006).\nAfterwards, there were fruit waves and various industries related to agriculture. The food processing, logistics, and input supply industries face higher costs and greater uncertainty (Serrano et al., 2025). Financial institutions adjust their lending practices based on climate risk, making credit more difficult to obtain, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (Liu et al., 2025); Ma et al., 2024). At the same time, as production shifts to regions with lower climate risks, structural changes are evident, and the market concentration of larger companies with stronger adaptability is also increasing (Nugroho et al., 2023; Alam et al., 2022).\nGovernments around the world are being caught up in this dynamic and forced to take on greater responsibility in stabilizing the agricultural insurance market. They face a dual challenge of providing immediate support through regulation, incentives, and public-private partnerships, while cultivating long-term resilience (Rouhanizadeh et al., 2020; Ogunleke and Idowu, 2025). The visual evidence from the Food and Agriculture Organization further emphasizes these challenges, as climate risk hotspot mapping highlights the areas most vulnerable to systemic agricultural vulnerability (FAO, 2020, 2016). This article examines these interrelated challenges and explores ways to implement adaptive strategies in the increasingly uncertain future of insurance itself.\n2. Impact on farmers\n2.1 Significant Increase in Economic Pressure\nThe rise in climate risk has forced insurers to make substantial payouts, which in turn has driven a sharp increase in agricultural insurance premiums. Recent studies indicate that in drought-prone regions, the average premium in 2023 was more than 35 percent higher than in 2019 (Barratt et al., 2025). Rising insurance premiums hinder risk-sharing, as illustrated by contract price dynamics under different incentive constraints (Figure 1) (Bulte & Lensink, 2023). Large farms are often able to maintain coverage despite reduced profitability, while smaller producers face greater difficulty in absorbing these costs.\nHowever, small and medium farmers are in a more fragile financial position, with high premiums beyond their means, and many of them are forced to forego insurance. Without insurance coverage, farmers must bear the losses caused by extreme weather conditions themselves. Once a disaster strikes, it can lead to serious cash flow problems, build up debt, and even force farmers out of production (Varshney et al., 2023). This phenomenon has exacerbated inequality in agricultural operations, with the gap between large agricultural enterprises and small farmers widening further.\n2.2 Increased risks to production and livelihoods\nClimate change has led to increasingly frequent extreme weather events in Australia, including prolonged droughts, flash floods, extreme heat, and heat waves, reflecting broader global warming trends (Figure 2) ( CSIRO, 2022).These climate anomalies directly increase multiple risks, such as crop yield reductions, livestock deaths, and water shortages (Kumar et al., 2023). Insurance should help farmers obtain financial compensation after disasters and resume production. However, many farmers lost this crucial financial buffer when premiums rose sharply or insurance companies stopped offering coverage.\nWithout insurance protection, farmers must bear the high costs of natural disasters on their own. For example, extreme flooding in eastern Queensland in 2023 resulted in widespread flooding of sugarcane and vegetable growing areas (Singh, 2023). Many farmers face severe cash shortages due to their inability to obtain compensation, which forces them to reduce their planting areas or abandon high-value crops. Over time, farmers often reduce their investments in the face of climate risks due to financial pressures, which in turn leads to lower yields and unstable incomes. This constitutes a vicious cycle that weakens the overall resilience of agricultural systems in the context of climate change.\n2.3 Widening Wealth Gap in Rural Areas\nChanges in the insurance market have had an uneven impact on different types of farmers. Large commercial farms usually have more resources, so they can afford high insurance costs and recover production more quickly after a disaster. In contrast, small and medium farmers lack sufficient funds and reserves to afford high insurance premiums and are more likely to face long-term losses when a disaster happens. This disparity has exacerbated the trend toward centralisation in agricultural production, which has led to changes in the industrial and social structures of rural areas.\n2.4 Psychological Stress and Social Impact\nThe uncertainty of climate risks and the lack of insurance coverage have had a significant impact on the mental health of farmers. Research shows that in drought affected areas of New South Wales, with approximately 40% of farmers reporting issues such as anxiety, sleeplessness, and depression (Varshney et al., 2023). Farmers lack sufficient financial buffers in high risk environments, which can lead to feelings of helplessness and negative expectations about the future. Some farmers therefore choose to abandon agricultural production, leading to rural depopulation and weakening community resilience and regional economic development potential.\n3. Impacts on Industry\n3.1 Direct Impact: Rising Costs and Risk Transfer\nInsurance is the main tool for food companies to manage risks. By transferring risks to insurance companies, agriculture companies reduce their risk costs (Kostyuchenko et al., 2015). In the risk rating of food companies by insurance experts, operational risks and market risks are rated as high risk, while technological risks and policy-related risks are rated as medium risk (Mârza et al., 2015). In the supply chain, food processing and transportation are downstream of farming and must directly bear the rising costs of agriculture. Climate instability directly leads to unstable agricultural yields and severe price fluctuations. The rise in insurance costs must also be shared by the companies purchasing products. Extreme weather directly affects the transportation of agricultural products. Higher premiums increase transport costs. Without insurance, delays and cargo damage must be borne directly by companies.\n3.2 Indirect Impact: Financing Difficulty and Related Industries\nThe development of small and medium-sized processing factories and agricultural cooperatives relies on loans. More production uncertainties caused by climate change reduce the income and debt repayment ability of agricultural companies, increasing their credit risk. Insurance can reduce credit risk through its compensation mechanism for economic losses to transfer risks (Liu et al., 2025). If severe climate instability causes financial institutions to give agricultural companies high-risk ratings, insurance refusals and stronger credit constraints may occur (Ma et al., 2024). This may break the capital chain of companies and limit further development. Industries with higher requirements for timeliness, such as fruits, vegetables, and dairy products, may find it hard to attract more capital investment due to unstable returns, which hinders expansion. Surrounding industries such as fertilizer, seeds, and agricultural machinery in the agricultural supplies industry are also influenced. Rising farming costs squeeze spending on fixed investment and supporting facilities. Reduced demand may cause a negative cycle.\n3.3 Industrial Structure Change: Concentration and Relocation\nSevere climate change places higher demands on basic agricultural infrastructure and intelligent automated farming. Developing countries may suffer more competitive disadvantages (Nugroho et al., 2023). Agricultural production may shift toward regions with lower climate risks or to more developed areas, a dynamic visually underscored by FAO's climate risk screening and portfolio risk-rating map for GEF-funded projects (Figure 3.) (FAO, 2020). Under this trend, multinational corporations will take more proactive measures (Abara et al., 2023). These include climate analysis, early regional planning, supporting suppliers in adapting to climate change, and practicing sustainable production. On the other hand, climate risks increase physical costs for many regional small and medium-sized enterprises, damaging their operations and profitability (Serrano et al., 2025). Shortage of funds, limited liquidity, and lack of data and expertise are the main factors restricting the development of SMEs (Alam et al., 2022). Bankruptcy or exit of SMEs may cause industries to concentrate toward large companies. While industries face mounting pressures from climate risks and insurance challenges, governments are increasingly drawn into the insurance market to stabilize agricultural production and mitigate systemic risks.\n4. Impacts on Government\n''4.1 The Government's Financial Burden''\nAs climate risks intensify, the government's involvement in the agricultural insurance market becomes increasingly critical. When insurance companies raise premiums or withdraw from underwriting, governments are often compelled to assume a greater share of responsibility, which places added strain on public resources.\nOne major pressure stems from the need to subsidise insurance costs. By providing subsidies, governments can ease the financial burden on farmers facing rising premiums, though this approach simultaneously heightens fiscal expenditures. For instance, the Australian government has extended such support to farmers in high-risk regions. However, questions remain about the long-term sustainability of these measures (Fraisse et al., 2006).\nProvide post-disaster assistance: After extreme climate events occur, the government usually offers post-disaster assistance to help farmers resume production. This kind of assistance usually includes cash subsidies, loan incentives and infrastructure reconstruction, etc. However, with the frequent occurrence of disasters, the financial pressure on governments will continue to increase. Without effective preventive measures and adaptation strategies, the burden of post-disaster assistance may not be sustainable (Rouhanizadeh et al., 2020).\n4.2 Adjustments to Government Policies and Regulations\nTo cope with the changes in the insurance market, the government needs to adjust existing policies and regulations to ensure the sustainability of agricultural insurance. Several measures can be considered. One option is to formulate new insurance regulations in which the government encourages insurance companies to adopt more flexible pricing mechanisms, particularly in high-risk areas and regions significantly affected by climate change. For example, insurers could be required to adjust premiums based on climate change trends so that they better reflect actual levels of risk (Tucker, 1997).\nAnother approach is to promote climate-adaptive investment. The government can introduce policies that encourage farmers to adopt technologies such as drip irrigation and drought-resistant crops. These technologies reduce reliance on insurance and enhance resilience to climate variability. The Food and Agriculture Organization emphasizes that certain agricultural sectors should be prioritized in adaptation planning, which highlights the importance of targeted government support (Figure 2) (FAO, 2016). At the same time, the government can lower adoption costs for farmers by offering tax incentives or subsidies (Ogunleke & Idowu, 2025).\nThe government can strengthen disaster warning and risk management by using climate models and big data to give early alerts about climate risks and provide useful information to help farmers prepare in advance. For example, by collaborating with meteorological agencies, the government can deliver more accurate weather forecasts and risk assessments, which assist farmers in choosing suitable crops or implementing appropriate disaster prevention measures (Fraisse et al., 2006).\n4.3 Promote Public-private Cooperation\nThe government can also promote innovation in the agricultural insurance market by inviting private companies to take part in reforms. One option is to develop climate index insurance together with insurers. In this type of product, payouts are based on measures such as rainfall or temperature instead of direct loss checks. These products are seen as clear, fast in paying claims, and less costly, which makes it possible to cover more farmers (Cole & Xiong, 2017).\nPublic-private partnership for risk sharing: The government and insurance companies can jointly assume the insurance liability for high-risk areas and reduce the compensation pressure on one party by establishing a risk-sharing mechanism. This can not only maintain the sustainable development of insurance companies, but also ensure that farmers can still be protected when encountering extreme weather (Tucker, 1997).\n5. Conclusion\nClimate change poses unprecedented challenges to agriculture, industry, and government policies. Extreme weather events are becoming increasingly frequent and severe, putting enormous pressure on the insurance system and making insurance costs increasingly high or difficult to obtain. For small and medium-sized farmers, higher insurance premiums and lower coverage mean greater financial pressure, higher production risks, and more severe inequality. The impact on mental health further indicates that climate risk is not only an economic risk, but also a social risk.\nThe agricultural industry is also facing rising costs, unstable supply chains, and financing difficulties. Small and medium-sized businesses are especially at risk.  As production moves to safer areas, large corporations have expanded their dominant position. This concentration has raised concerns about the fairness, strong, and inclusiveness of the entire food system.\nGovernments of various countries need to play a central role in balancing emergency relief with long-term strategies. Subsidies and post disaster assistance provide short-term stability, but require deeper changes, climate friendly investments, and better warning systems to maintain lasting strength. Collaborating with private companies can more fairly share risks and protect the groups with the highest risks.\nUltimately, the idea of an uninsured future reflects a broader reality. Insurance alone cannot absorb the escalating climate risks. Sustainable response measures will require financial instruments, technological innovation, and coordinated governance to protect livelihoods and build resilience in an uncertain climate.\nReference\nAbara, O., Ikechukwu, O.
