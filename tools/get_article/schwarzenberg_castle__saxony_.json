It was based on a medieval fortification and together with St. George's Church dominates the scene of the large county town of Schwarzenberg in Saxony's district of Erzgebirgskreis.\nConstruction history\nThe castle was probably founded in the 12th century as a fort and was the original base for the settlement of Schwarzenberg and its vicinity. The former castle was given its present appearance by a conversion into a hunting lodge for the Electorate of Saxony from 1555 to 1558. In 1851-1852, its keep and south wing were raised, and in 1875-1876, an office building extension was added.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Georg Dehio: Handbuch der Deutschen Kunstdenkmäler Sachsen: II.
