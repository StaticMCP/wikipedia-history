In the , Frazerview had a population of 36 people.\nGeography\nFrazerview is located in the Fassifern Valley farming area to the west of Cunningham Highway.  Part of the south-eastern boundary of Frazerview is marked by Warrill Creek, a tributary of the Bremer River. Frazer Creek rises in the north-west of the locality and flows south-east where it becomes a tributary of Warwill Creek ().\nThe Cunningham Highway passes briefly through the south-east of the locality, entering from the east (Kalbar) and exiting to the south-east (Fassifern).\nFrazerview has the following mountains:\n* Kangaroo Mountain in the east of the locality () rising to  above sea level\n* Mount Fraser in the west of the locality ()\nThe land use is predominantly grazing on native vegetation with some irrigated farms in the south-east of the locality near to Warrill Creek. The western end of the locality around Mount Fraser is undeveloped bushland.\nHistory\nMount Fraser was named by botanist and explorer Allan Cunningham on 26 August 1828, after Charles Fraser who was the Colonial Botanist of New South Wales from 1821 to 1831. It is presumed that the creek and locality name are derived from the mountain, albeit with a variant spelling.\nFrazerview State School was opened on 25 November 1915.  Three days later the school was destroyed by fire.  It was re-opened one year later and continued to educate children until December 1975 when the school was closed due to low attendance rates with the remaining students transferred to Engelburg State School in Kalbar (later renamed Kalbar State School. It was at 420 Frazerview Road ().\nDemographics\nIn the , Frazerview had a population of 34 people.
