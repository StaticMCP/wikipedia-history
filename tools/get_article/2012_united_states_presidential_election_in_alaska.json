Alaska voters chose three electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote pitting incumbent Democratic President Barack Obama and his running mate, Vice President Joe Biden, against Republican challenger and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and his running mate, Congressman Paul Ryan.\nPrior to the election, all leading news organizations considered this a state Romney would win, making Alaska a safe red state. Romney won the state of Alaska with 54.80% of the vote, while Obama received 40.81%. This was the first time since 1968 that a Democrat received more than 40% of the vote in Alaska. No Democrat has won Alaska since it was won by Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964.\nAlthough Romney easily won its three electoral votes, it was one of six states to swing toward Obama relative to 2008, when Alaska was won with a 21.5% margin of victory by Republican nominee John McCain running with the incumbent governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin, as his vice-presidential candidate. Obama closed his margin of defeat by 7.55% compared to his 2008 loss, thereby making it the state with the strongest Democratic gain in 2012.\nObama also flipped seven boroughs and census areas that he had lost in 2008. As of the 2024 election, this is the last election in which Haines Borough voted for the Republican candidate.\nCaucuses\nDemocratic caucuses\nThe Alaska Democratic caucuses were held from April 10 to 14, 2012, with the state party convention being held from May 11 to 13. Precincts within House Districts combined to hold caucuses to pledge delegates to the State Convention. Obama ran mostly unopposed (with the exception of Randall Terry, who was on the ballot but received no votes) and consequently received all of the 500 popular votes and 24 delegates.\n-->\n| delegate_count2 = 0\n| popular_vote2 = 0\n| percentage2 = 0.00%\n| image_size = x125px\n| color1 = 1E90FF\n| color2 = 000000\n| votes_for_election = 24 Democratic National Convention delegates (19 pledged, 5 unpledged)The number of pledged delegates won is determined by the popular vote\n}}\nRepublican caucuses\nThe Alaska Republican caucuses were held Super Tuesday, March 6, 2012. The presidential preference poll portion of the caucuses was scheduled between 4 pm and 8 pm local time (which is 8 pm to midnight EST) at locations across the state and one caucus in Washington, D.C.\nSimilar to the 2012 Nevada caucuses, the results of the presidential preference poll will be used to directly and proportionately apportion 24 national convention delegates among the candidates. Another 3 super delegates are unbound and not determined by the caucus results.\n{| class=wikitable\n|- style=\"background:#eee; text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=\"4\" | 2012 Alaska Republican presidential caucuses\n|- style=\"background:#eee; text-align:center;\"\n!
