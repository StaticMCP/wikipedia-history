After the death of Ala al-Din Tekish in 1200, his son Alā' al-Din Muhammad succeeded him. Upon this, Ghiyath al-Din requested his brother, Muhammad of Ghor, to make preparations from India to attack the Khawarazmians. Muhammad of Ghor arrived from India with a large army, including elephants. Now prepared, Ghiyath al-Din and Muhammad of Ghor entered Khorasan with their army, capturing Nishapur, Merv, Sarakhs, Tus. The Ghurid forces expanded as far as Gorgan and Bistam. Kuhistan, a stronghold of Isma'ilis, was also campaigned against by Muhammad of Ghor, where their holdings were plundered, leading to all of Khorasan being brought under Ghurid control.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*https://en.unesco.org/silkroad/sites/default/files/knowledge-bank-article/vol_IVa%20silk%20road_the%20ghurids.pdf\n*[https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=wOzeDwAAQBAJ&lpg=PT3&dq=qara%20khitai%20ghurid%20balkh&pg=PT24#v=onepage&q=qara%20khitai%20ghurid%20balkh&f=false The Chronicle of Ibn al-Athir for the Crusading Period from al-Kamil fi'l-Ta'rikh.
