The first rulers of the newly established region were kings of the Franks. The Latin construction \"Lotharingia\" evolved over time into \"Lorraine\" in French, \"Lotharingen\" in Dutch and \"Lothringen\" in German. After the Carolingian kingdom was absorbed into its neighbouring realms in the late ninth century, dukes were appointed over the territory. In the mid-tenth century, the duchy was divided into Lower Lorraine and Upper Lorraine, the first evolving into the historical Low Countries, the second became known as the Duchy of Lorraine and existed well into the modern era.\nKings of Lotharingia\n*Lothair II (855–869)\nCharles the Bald claimed Lotharingia on Lothair's death and was crowned king in Metz, but his brother Louis the German opposed his claim and in 870 the Treaty of Mersen divided Lotharingia between the two brothers and subsequently their sons. In 880, the Treaty of Ribemont gave the whole of Lotharingia to Louis the Younger, son of Louis the German.\n*Charles the Bald (869–870), also king of West Francia and Italy, and Carolingian emperor\n*Louis the Younger (880–882), also king of Saxony and Bavaria\n*Charles the Fat (882–887), also king of West Francia, East Francia, Alemannia, Aquitaine and Italy, and Carolingian emperor\n*Arnulf of Carinthia (887–895), also king of East Francia and Italy, and Carolingian emperor\n*Zwentibold (895–900)\n*Louis the Child (900–911), also king of East Francia\n*Charles the Simple (911–923), also king of West Francia\nIn 925, Lotharingia was subsumed into East Francia.\nDukes of Lotharingia\n*Gebhard (903–910)\n*Reginar (910–915)\n*Gilbert (915–939)\n*Henry (939–940)\n*Otto (942–944)\n*Conrad (944–953)\n*Bruno, Archbishop of Cologne (953–965)\nIn 959, Lorraine was divided into two districts, Lower and Upper Lorraine, each governed by a margrave, under Bruno. Upon Bruno's death in 965, these two margraves were recognised as dukes of Lower and Upper Lorraine, respectively. The two duchies remained separate, following separate pathways, except for the period between 1033 and 1044.\nDukes of Lower Lorraine\n:Note that the numbering of the dukes varies between sources.\nMatfriding dynasty\n*Godfrey I (959–964)\n*Richer I (964-972)\nAfter the death of Richer, the duchy was directly administrated by the holy emperor until the arrival of Charles I\nCarolingian dynasty\n*Charles I (977–991)\n*Otto I (991–1012)\nHouse of Ardennes–Verdun\n*Godfrey II (1012–1023) (also known as Godfrey I)\n*Gothelo I (1023–1044) (also duke of Upper Lorraine)\n*Gothelo II (1044–1046)\nHouse of (Ardenne–) Luxembourg\n*Frederick I (1046–1065)\nHouse of Ardennes–Verdun\n*Godfrey III the Bearded (1065–1069) (also known as Godfrey II, previously duke of Upper Lorraine)\n*Godfrey IV (1069–1076) (also known as Godfrey III)\nSalian dynasty\n*Conrad (1076–1087)\nHouse of Boulogne (Ardennes–Bouillon)\n*Godfrey V \"of Bouillon\" (1087–1100) (also known as Godfrey IV), one of the leaders of the First Crusade and the first ruler of the Kingdom of Jerusalem\nHouse of Limburg 20px\n*Henry I (1101–1106)\nHouse of Leuven 20px\n*Godfrey VI  (1106–1129) (also known as Godfrey I of Leuven)\nHouse of Limburg 20px\n*Waleran (1129–1139)\nHouse of Leuven 20px\n*Godfrey VII(1139–1142) (also known as Godfrey II of Leuven)\n*Godfrey VIII (1142–1190) (also known as Godfrey III of Leuven)\n:Disintegrates.
