When Thersander died on Mysia in the Trojan War, Peneleos acted as regent for Tisamenus until he came of age. Little is known about his rule. He was succeeded by his son Autesion.\nNote\nReferences\n* Pausanias, Description of Greece with an English Translation by W.H.S. Jones, Litt.D., and H.A. Ormerod, M.A., in 4 Volumes.
