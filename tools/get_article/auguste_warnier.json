career in Algeria.\nAt first he was a Saint-Simonian and was sympathetic to the local population.\nHe thought the Berbers had Germanic blood and a civilization derived from Roman and Christian origins, so could readily adapt to French civilization.\nHe had no respect for the Arab \"intruders\".\nLater he took the view that the indigenous people had destroyed the once-fertile environment of Algeria, became a proponent of French colonization and opposed the \"Arab Kingdom\" policy of Napoleon III.\nIn his last years he was a Representative in the National Assembly for the Province of Algiers.\nHe was responsible for a law that allowed expropriation of land or forced sale to colonists.\nEarly years (1810–34)\nAuguste Hubert Warnier was born on 8 January 1810 in Rocroi, Ardennes.\nHis parents were Jean-Louis Warnier (1774–1814), Lieutenant in the 6th line regiment and Knight of the Legion of Honour, and Marie Salomé Victoire Seguin (c. 1789–1849).\nHe received a classical education in Reims.\nHe studied medicine in Paris.\nAfter passing his medical examinations he was in turn attached to the Val-de-Grâce military hospital in Paris and the military hospital in Lille.\nBy 1831 he was a military doctor.\nHe was named assistant surgeon in Douai in 1832.\nJuly Monarchy (1834–48)\nWarnier was sent to Oran during the cholera outbreak of 1834.\nIn Algeria he studied the customs and language of the Arabs while serving with the ambulances of the Army of Africa.\nIn 1835 he was cited for his role in the fighting at Mostaganem for having recovered, alone, a dying soldier from the field of battle.\nWarnier joined the Service des Affaires Arabes in 1837 and served in Mascara until 1839 treating the indigenous people and fighting cholera.\nIn the process he gained a solid understanding of Arab society.\nWarnier served with the consul Eugène Daumas in Mascara, and Daumas wrote to his commanding officer in Oran saying he was a congenial and talented assistant.\nHe was praised for his medical skill, his humanity and his knowledge of Algeria and its peoples.\nIn 1838  he was a member of the mission sent to the Emir Abdelkader after the Treaty of Tafna. }}\nIn 1839 he completed his medical studies and received a doctorate in medicine from the University of Montpellier.\nWarnier and Joanny André Napoléon Perier were the two physicians on the Scientific Commission for the Exploration of Algeria, which operated from 1840 to 1842 and resulted in the publication of 39 volumes on a range of subjects.\nWarnier met the Saint-Simonian leader Prosper Enfantin, whom he befriended, and became one of Enfantin's most faithful collaborators.\nAs a Saint-Simonian he earned hostility from some quarters, praise from others.\nIn 1843 Warnier represented the government to prisoners captured at the Battle of the Smala.\nHe was attached to the maritime expedition to Morocco in 1844, and sent almost daily reports to Enfantin who published them in his newspaper Algeria.\nHe was in charge of negotiating the Treaty of Tangiers (1844).\nHe was promoted to Officer of the Legion of Honour on 17 October 1844.\nHe was then director of civil affairs in Oran.\nIn an official publication in 1847 Warnier and Ernest Carette(fr) wrote positively about the nomads, although later Warnier would support colonialism.\nWarnier considered that the local people formed three groups: 1 million were Berbers who spoke the Berber language.\n1.2 million were Arab-speaking Berbers and 500,000 were pure Arabs or other minorities such as Turks and Moors.\nDaumas was among those who thought the Kabyle people, the largest Berber group, were partly Germanic in origin, had formerly been Christians and had not been fully converted to Islam.\nIn an 1865 book Warnier extended this theory to cover all Berbers.\nThe cross-like tattoos on the faces of many Kabyles was taken as evidence.\nWarnier believed that the Berber civilization had evolved from Roman and Christian traditions, and the Berber speakers, in particular, had escaped the pernicious influence of the Arabs and could adapt to French civilization.\nThe Arab intruders, in his view, had never established anything of value and would remain alien nomads.\nSecond Republic and Second Empire (1848–70)\nin 1864, aged about 24]]\nDuring the French Second Republic Warnier was a member of the council of the government of Algeria in 1848–49.\nHe returned to private life, and in 1850 founded the Atlas newspaper.\nThis was suppressed after the coup d'état of 2 December 1851.\nWarnier was one of the last companions of Père Enfantin, and stayed as a colonist in the Sahel of Algiers Province.\nDuring the Second French Empire Warnier created a large agricultural establishment on the banks of the old Lake Alloula.\nFor many years Warnier was a strong supporter of projects to open up the Sahara.\nHe helped Henri Duveyrier, son of one of his and Enfantin's friends.\nDuveyrier was Warnier's guest in 1857 at his home in Kandouri, a suburb of Algiers, where he met Oscar MacCarthy.\nOn 8 March 1857 Duveyrier and MacCarthy left on a five-week trip to Laghouat and back.\nDuveyrier was fascinated by the Tuaregs he met on this trip and the next year gave an account of Tuareg customs to the Berlin Oriental Society.\nLater Duveyrier made an unsuccessful attempt to reach Tuat, which was stopped by the Tuaregs at El Goléa.\nDuveyrier left in May 1859 and after an exhausting journey returned to Warnier's house on 5 December 1861, emaciated and delirious with fever.\nBy the early 1860s Warnier was no longer associated with the army or the Saint-Simonians, but had become a spokesman for the colons.\nHe had retired from the army in 1861.\nHis ''L'Algérie devant le Sénat (1863), a collection of his articles from L'Opinion Nationale'', laid out the principles for colonization of Algeria by civilian settlers.\nIt was widely read in France, and was followed by several other books along the same lines.\nIn 1862 he was the doctor and confidant of Sheikh Othman during his trip to France.\nSheikh Othman was leader of the religious Iforas tribe of the Kel Ajjer and had been Duveyrier's host in 1859.\nWarnier gained great prestige among the settlers since he and Jules Duval(fr) in Paris were leaders of a group opposed to the emperor's Arab Kingdom policy. }}\nIn 1869 Warnier and Jules Duval wrote that, \"In their rebellions against our authority, the indigènes are able to distinguish between the colon and the solder.\"\nThey said the government downplayed this fact since it would undermine the justification for the \"exceptional\" military regime.\nWarner tried to fight the government in Algeria and published several brochures on the subject.\nWarnier was skeptical about Napoleon's 1865 sénatus-consulte that defined conditions for native Algerians to become French citizens.\nHe wrote in 1865,\n}}\nWarnier thought the imperial government was sacrificing the interests of the French settlers in favour of the Arab aristocracy, which wanted to prevent progress and maintain their feudal control.\nHe provided proof, based on crop production and taxes paid, that one settler was worth ten indigenous people.\nIn 1865 Warnier blamed the nomads for destroying the Algerian environment, writing that the land was \"long ago a sort of terrestrial paradise ... today this land is a sterile desert.\"\nThird Republic (1870–75)\nAfter the fall of the empire, on 5 September 1870 Warnier became Prefect of Algiers.\nHe resigned from this position to run as candidate for the National Assembly in Algiers on 17 February 1871, but was defeated.\nWarnier ran again in the same department on 9 July 1871 after the resignation of Giuseppe Garibaldi and this time was elected.\nHe was also a General counselor of the province of Algiers from August 1870.\nIn the Assembly he sat with the left, voted against the bishops' petition, against the resignation of Adolphe Thiers, against the septennate and against the ministry of Albert, 4th duc de Broglie.\nThe government of the French Third Republic reversed the policy of Napoleon III and gave strong support to the French colonists in Algeria.\nThe Algerian revolt of 1871–72 was crushed and the Algerians were subsequently repressed.\nWarnier used the narrative of destruction of the environment by the local people to justify the 1873 settlers' property law that took his name.\nThe \"Loi Warnier\" accelerated the alienation of the peasantry of Algeria from their lands.\nIslamic Law no longer applied to landholdings.\nThe law facilitated forced purchase or confiscation of land by the colonists.\nWhile deputy, Warnier introduced Hippolyte Mircher to the future explorer of French Africa Paul Soleillet.\nWarnier also introduced Soleillet to Léon Cremieux, president of the Israelite Alliance of Algeria, who had obtained French citizenship for Algerian Jews.\nAuguste Warnier died in office on 15 March 1875 in Versailles, Yvelines.\nThe fungus Lenzites warnieri is named after him.\nIt was found growing on the trunks of elms in Warnier's Kandouri property. }}\nPublications\nPublications
