His reign ended with the collapse of the Western Xia as forces of the Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan overran and conquered it following the defiance of earlier emperors.\nThe Mongols gave Li Xian the name Shidurghu (Mongolian:, Chinese: 失都兒忽), meaning \"simple, right, just\", and in 18th century European sources he is referred to as Schidascou or Shidaskû from his Mongolian name.\nReign\nHe was a nephew of his predecessor Emperor Xianzong. Faced with the threat of the Mongols, Li Xian and his officials rallied around the capital Zhongxing, trying to use its large walls to hold off the Mongol cavalries. However, Zhongxing suffered from a massive earthquake, which resulted in pestilence and food shortage. In 1227, Li finally surrendered to the Mongol Empire. In August 1227, the Mongols killed Li Xian and his entire family out of fear that the Western Xia would rebel again over the death of Genghis Khan.[https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E6%96%B0%E5%85%83%E5%8F%B2/%E5%8D%B7003 《新元史》卷三《太祖本纪下》]记载：“（元太祖二十二年）秋七月，帝驻跸清水县之西江。壬午，帝疾甚。已丑，崩于灵州。……。西夏主来朝，托言帝有疾，不能见，令于帐外行礼。越三日，诸将遵遗命杀之。西夏亡。 ”节选自《新元史》卷三《太祖本纪下》  His death marked the end of the Western Xia dynasty.\nAfter the fall of the Western Xia, the Mongol army discussed the massacre of the city, but finally, under the strong advice of the Mongol general Tsa Han (), who was from Tangut, the people of Zhongxingfu were prevented from being massacred, and Tsa Han then went into the city to pacify the people and soldiers therein, so that the people left behind by the Western Xia could be preserved.《元史》卷120《察罕传》，相关记载：“众方议降，会帝崩，诸将擒夏主杀之，复议屠中兴，察罕力谏止之，驰入，安集遗民。” [http://www.guoxue.com/shibu/24shi/yuanshi/yuas_120.htm 《]元史·察罕传》\nReferences"
