Recordists' names contain at least three of the same letter (not true, as the only engineer whose name has three letters is Bobby Burg). Singers always have a W in their names (vocalist Kidwell & bassist Newton). The difference between the number of consonants and vowels in the names of Instrument Players is never four or five. Producers are also Recordists as well as Backup Singers. Singers made the Artwork. The person whose name contains the greater number of consonants wrote the lyrics (meaning Kidwell; his name contains nine consonants).\nReferences"
