The inspection system is administered by the New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA).  Most vehicles with a gross mass under  that are used on public roads are required to undergo a WoF test, with the frequency depending on the age of the vehicle. New vehicles have a WoF issued at first registration that is valid for three years, then annually thereafter.  Vehicles first registered anywhere on or after 1 January 2000 must undergo a WoF test annually; pre 2000 vehicles must undergo a WoF test every six months until they reach the 40th anniversary of their first registration anywhere, after which eligible motor vehicles are then only subject to annual inspection.\nVehicles over , passenger service vehicles (taxis, buses, shuttles, etc.), and rental vehicles do not have a Warrant of Fitness. Instead, these vehicles must possess a Certificate of Fitness (CoF). The CoF test is similar to the WoF test, but must be undergone every six months regardless of the age of the vehicle, unless a different inspection interval has been specified by the Transport Agency, or it is an eligible privately owned motorhome which are on a twelve month CoF.   Brand new rental cars will also initially be issued with a twelve month CoF.\nA WoF test checks tyre condition, brake condition, structural condition, lights, glazing, windscreen wipers and washers, doors, seat belts, airbags (if fitted), speedometer, steering and suspension, exhaust, and fuel system. A vehicle must meet certain criteria in each category to pass the Warrant of Fitness. Many local car repair garages throughout New Zealand are authorised to perform testing and to issue Warrants of Fitness.\nEach vehicle used on public roads must display a Warrant of Fitness sticker on the drivers side edge of the windscreen, or in the case of vehicles not fitted with a windscreen, in a convenient location preferably close to the rear number plate. The sticker indicates that the vehicle passed its last WoF inspection, and shows when the next inspection is due. The current stickers display on the outside 2 holes punched, one through a number on the side indicating the month due (e.g. a hole through the number 4 indicates the next test is due in April) and one punched through the number on the bottom indicating the year due (e.g. a hole through the numbers 18 indicates the next test is due in 2018). On the inside, the sticker shows the full date of when the next inspection is due, the vehicle registration number, and the issuing agent stamp.\nA vehicle with a current WoF can still be inspected by a police officer and ordered unroadworthy. If a vehicle lacks a WOF sticker, or its WOF is expired, the driver is liable for a NZ$200 fine. If a vehicle is found parked on a public road without a valid WoF sticker, the fine may be also issued by a parking warden.\nSee also\n* VTNZ (a vehicle inspection company)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.nzta.govt.nz/vehicle/warrants-certifications/index.html Warrants and certifications] at the New Zealand Transport Agency"
