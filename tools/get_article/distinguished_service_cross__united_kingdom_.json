The award was formerly also awarded to members of armed forces of other Commonwealth countries.\nThe DSC is \"awarded in recognition of an act or acts of exemplary gallantry during active operations against the enemy at sea.\" Since 1979, it can be awarded posthumously.\nHistory\nThe award was originally created in 1901 as the Conspicuous Service Cross, for award to warrant and subordinate officers, including midshipmen, ineligible for the Distinguished Service Order. It was renamed the Distinguished Service Cross in October 1914, eligibility being extended to all naval officers (commissioned and warrant) below the rank of lieutenant commander.\nFrom March 1915, foreign officers of equivalent rank in allied navies could receive honorary awards; in August 1916, bars were introduced to reward further acts of gallantry meriting the Cross, with a silver rosette worn on the ribbon when worn alone, to denote the award of each bar. During World War I, officers of the Merchant and Fishing Fleets had been awarded the DSC, and their eligibility was legally clarified by an order in council in 1931.\nWorld War II saw a number of changes. In December 1939, eligibility was extended to Naval Officers of the rank of Commander and Lieutenant-Commander. In April 1940, equivalent ranks in the Royal Air Force serving with the Fleet could receive the DSC, and, from November 1942, so could those in the Army aboard defensively equipped merchant ships.\nSince the 1993 review of the honours system, as part of the drive to remove distinctions of rank in awards for bravery, the Distinguished Service Medal, formerly the third-level decoration for ratings, has been discontinued. The DSC now serves as the third-level award for gallantry at sea for all ranks, not to the standard required to receive the Victoria Cross or the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross.\nThe DSC had also been awarded by Commonwealth countries; however, by the 1990s, most of these—including Canada, Australia, and New Zealand—were establishing their own honours systems and no longer recommended British honours.\nRecipients are entitled to the post-nominal \"DSC\".\nDescription\nThe DSC is a plain silver cross with rounded ends, with a width of  and with the following design:\n* The obverse has a circular centre containing the Royal Cypher of the reigning monarch at the time of award surmounted by a crown.\n* The reverse is plain apart from the hallmark, and the ribbon is attached via a hallmarked silver ring. From 1940, the year of issue was engraved on lower limb of cross, and since 1984 it has been awarded named to the recipient.\n* The ribbon has three equal stripes of dark blue, white, and dark blue.\n* The ribbon bar denoting a further award is plain silver, with convex ends and a central crown.\nRecipients\nNumbers awarded\nSince 1901 at least 6,658 Crosses and 603 bars have been awarded.
