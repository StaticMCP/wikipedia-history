It is a two-story structure, finished in vertical board siding and brick. Its street-facing east facade has small windows, while the western facade is almost all glass, providing view over the valley to the west. The house was built in 1959 to a design by Arkansas architect Warren Segraves for his family's use, and is a good example of Mid-Century Modern residential architecture. Its most distinctive feature is a series of diamond-shaped panels that give the roof an accordion shape.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Washington County, Arkansas\nReferences"
