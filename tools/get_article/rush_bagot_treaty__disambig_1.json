It was ratified by the United States Senate on April 16, 1818, and was confirmed by Canada, following Confederation in 1867.\nThe treaty provided for a large demilitarization of lakes along the international boundary, where many British naval arrangements and forts remained. The treaty stipulated that the United States and British North America could each maintain one military vessel (no more than 100 tons burden) as well as one cannon (no more than eighteen pounds) on Lake Ontario and Lake Champlain. The remaining Great Lakes permitted the United States and British North America to keep two military vessels \"of like burden\" on the waters armed with \"like force\". The treaty, and the separate Treaty of 1818, laid the basis for a demilitarized boundary between the U.S. and British North America.\nHistory\n]]\nThe origins of the Rush–Bagot Treaty can be traced to diplomatic efforts following the War of 1812, as both Great Britain and the United States sought to reduce military tensions and avoid a costly arms race on the Great Lakes. Initial discussions began when U.S. Secretary of State James Monroe instructed John Quincy Adams in 1815 to propose mutual disarmament to the British government. Although early negotiations stalled, the British government eventually authorized Sir Charles Bagot, its minister in Washington, to resume talks. a correspondence of letters between Acting United States Secretary of State Richard Rush and the British Minister to Washington Sir Charles Bagot, which were exchanged and signed on April 27 and 28, 1817. After the terms of the notes were agreed upon by Rush and Bagot, the Rush–Bagot Agreement was unofficially recognized by both countries. On April 6, 1818, it was submitted to the United States Senate and formally ratified on April 16, 1818. The treaty eventually led to the Treaty of Washington of 1871, which completed disarmament. The United States and Canada agreed in 1946, through an exchange of diplomatic notes, that the stationing of naval vessels for training purposes was permissible provided each government was fully notified in advance.\nIn 2004, the U.S. Coast Guard decided to arm 11 of its small cutters stationed on Lake Erie and Lake Huron with M240 7.62 mm machine guns. The U.S. decision was based on a climbing number of smuggling operations as well as the increased threat of terrorist activity after the September 11, 2001, attacks. The Canadian government decided that the armament did not violate the treaty, as the guns were to be used for law enforcement rather than military activities. Canada reserved the right to arm its law enforcement vessels with similar weapons.\nMilitary installations\n, Royal Military College of Canada, Kingston, Ontario\nHMCS Stone Frigate, located at the Royal Military College in Kingston, Ontario, was constructed during 1820 to store part of the dismantled British fleet from the War of 1812, which had been dismantled pursuant to the Rush–Bagot Treaty.\nThere are still military facilities near or next to the Great Lakes:\n* Canada\n** ASU London Niagara-on-the-Lake Rifle Range at 1848 Lakeshore Avenue, Niagara-on-the-Lake: former rifle training centre, closed 2010 and transferred to Parks Canada, site of landing by American forces during War of 1812 (Battlefield of Newark May 25–27, 1813)\n** ASU London,  London, Ontario: Original Wolseley Hall/Barracks closed after 2012 with local Primary Reserve units supported by ASU Toronto are now housed at Captain Neil Logistics Facility\n** Canadian Forces College, Toronto: general staff college\n** CFB Borden, Borden, Ontario: former training airbase, now Canadian Forces training centre, home to Regular Forces and Primary Reserve units\n** CFB Kingston, Kingston, Ontario: HQ to 1 Wing, CF training centre, HMCS Stone Frigate, HMCS Cataraqui Naval Reserve / Royal Canadian Sea Cadets base and home to Regular Forces and Primary Reserve units\n** CFB Trenton, Trenton, Ontario: largest airbase in Canada, home to 7 Transport Squadron including VIP transport, home to Regular Forces and Primary Reserve units (8 Wing), Joint Rescue Coordination Centre Trenton staffed with Canadian Coast Guard\n** CFD Mountain View, Prince Edward County, Ontario: storage of retired RCAF aircraft and also used as glider school for Royal Canadian Air Cadets units\n** Col J.

The U.S. and the British agreed to joint control over the Oregon Territory.  The Rush–Bagot Agreement laid the foundation for the world's longest international boundary&mdash;8,891 kilometres (5,525&nbsp;mi), and the longest demilitarized border in the world.\nAlthough the treaty had caused difficulties during World War I, its terms were not changed. Similar problems occurred before World War II, but Secretary of State Cordell Hull wanted to preserve the agreement because of its historical importance. In 1939 and 1940, Canada and the United States agreed to interpret the treaty so that weapons could be installed in the Great Lakes but could not be operable until the ships left the Lakes. In 1942, the United States, by then having entered the war and allied with Canada, successfully proposed that until the end of the war weapons could be completely installed and tested in the Lakes. After discussions in the Permanent Joint Board on Defense, in 1946, Canada similarly proposed to interpret the agreement as permitting using ships for training purposes if each country notified the other.\nPlaques\nRush–Bagot Treaty plaque at Kingston, Ontario\nAn Ontario Heritage Trust plaque in Kingston, Ontario recognizes the Rush–Bagot Agreement\n(). A plaque also stands at the former site of the British Legation in Washington, D.C. () where the agreement was negotiated.
