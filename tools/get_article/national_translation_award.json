Since 2015 the prize has been awarded separately in categories of prose and poetry. Established in 1998, the NTA is the only prize for a work of literary translation into English to include a full evaluation of the source language text. As of 2023 the award is worth $4,000 given to the translator. The award is usually given to translations of previously untranslated contemporary works or first-time translations of older works, but important re-translations have also been honored. The winning translators and books are featured at the annual conference of the American Literary Translators Association.\nThe ALTA also awards the Lucien Stryk Asian Translation Prize, Italian Prose in Translation Award, the Spain-USA Foundation Translation Award, the ALTA First Translation Prize, and the ALTA Travel Fellowships.\nWinners\nNational Translation Award 2007-2014\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|- bgcolor=\"#505050\"\n!Year\n!Genre\n!Translator\n!Work\n!Language\n|-\n|2007\n|Prose\n| Joel Agee\n| The Selected Writings of Friedrich Dürrenmatt by Friedrich Dürrenmatt (University of Chicago)\n| German\n|-\n|2008\n|Drama\n| Richard Wilbur\n| The Theatre of Illusion by Pierre Corneille (Harvest Books)\n| French\n|-\n|2009\n|Poetry\n| Norman R.
