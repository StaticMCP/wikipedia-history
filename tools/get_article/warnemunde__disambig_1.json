In 1323  lost its autonomous status as it was purchased by the city of Rostock in order to safeguard the city's access to the Baltic Sea. It was not until the 19th century that  began to develop into an important seaside resort.

Some of these signs are over a kilometre apart, and the total length of the ' is close to 6&nbsp;km (5,870m). The model includes Pluto and has not been updated since Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet. Walking along the  allows hikers to get an intuitive idea of the relative distances between the orbits of the planets and the Sun.\nClimate\nThe district of  has a Baltic-influenced oceanic climate (Cfb) according to the Köppen climate classification system.\n|source 2 = Météo Climat Infoclimat\n}}\nCulture and sport\nThere are a lot of musicians and bands in  who are involved in cultural events.\n*\n*\n*\n*Irish Coffee\n*Heide Mundo\nSport\nBecause of the weak current and good sailing conditions,  is a major sailing area in Germany.
