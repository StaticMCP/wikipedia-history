Scholar Nicole Wolf, for instance, argues that Indian documentary cinema has long existed in a \"double bind\", first shaped by British colonial governance and later by foreign funding.\nThe introduction of motion pictures in India started with the Lumière Brothers' public screenings in Bombay in 1896. Soon after that, Indian pioneers like Harishchandra Sakharam Bhatwadekar (Sewa Dada) and Hiralal Sen began filming real-life events, such as social gatherings and political protests. These initial filmmaking efforts by Indians were closely connected to traditional public performances and popular culture, contributed to what scholars have termed \"cultural performance\". During early 1910s and 1920s, prior the term \"Documentary\" gain currency, Indian filmmakers produced wide range of films categories as \"educational\", \"topical\" and \"public utility\" films. These films, supported by British authorities and local governments, generally covered the topic such as sanitation, agriculture, and public health to advance colonial agendas of modernisation and public welfare. During the 1930s and early 1940s, several documentary films were made that addressed political themes, especially those related to Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian independence movement. These films were censored or confiscated by the British colonial authorities. Fragments of these works, preserved in archival records, attest to the politically engaged nature of pre-Independence documentary cinema.\nThe beginning of World War II heralded the creation of a number of British-Indian film institutions, including the Films Advisory Board (1940–1943), the Army Film Centre (1941), the Information Films of India (1943–1946), and the Indian News Parade (1943–1946). While often described as propagandistic wartime institutions, these bodies also made films on non-military subjects, such as health, education and rural development. Individuals such as Ezra Mir and V. Shantaram played important role in shaping the direction of these institutions.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Wartime Film Institutions in Colonial India Source:  &\n! scope=\"col\" | Institution\n! scope=\"col\" | Year Established\n! scope=\"col\" | Purpose\n! scope=\"col\" | Key Figures / Notes\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Films Advisory Board (FAB)\n| 1940\n| Produced propaganda films supporting British war efforts in India.\n| Headed by J.B.H.

Following India's independence, the state itself became the major creator of documentary filmmaking through its formation of the Films Division in 1948. Placed within the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, the Films Division was meant to be an official organ to visually express the postcolonial nation-state's aspirations.\nThe Films Division initially functioned on a two-winged system: production and distribution. The subjects were chosen in consultation with different government ministries and finalized at annual inter-ministerial meetings. While initially it hired professional filmmakers, leadership later came to be wielded by members of the Indian Administrative Service, many of whom had little or no filmmaking experience. Indian directors such as Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen, Shyam Benegal, K.A. Abbas, and Sukhdev, either began their careers or collaborated with the Films Division during 1950s–60s era. By the middle of the 1960s, the Division was printing as many as 40,000 films every year, released to more than 200 first-run picture houses, with a circulation system geared to serve almost all of the nation's theaters. Theme wise, films were categorized into various areas such as Art and Culture, Citizenship and Reform, Defense and International Affairs, and most prominently, Development and Planning, which constituted over one-third of its output. Films like Where the Desert Blooms (1962) and A Symbol of Progress (1965) promote Nehru's ideas for India.\nPolitical scientist Srirupa Roy argued that Films Division projected a \"statist vision of nationhood\", where the state became both the subject and the narrator of national identity. Through standardized voice-overs, repeated visuals, and institutional logos, the Division, Roy notes, forged a recognizable \"sound and sight of the state.\" By the 1970s, Films Division began to face criticism for its formulaic approach, and its failure to reflect political unrest or marginalized voices. These tensions created the conditions for the emergence of independent documentary filmmaking later that decade.  Despites its role as state propaganda unit, the Films Division also produced some of the experimental films. Directors such as S.N.S. Sastry (I Am Twenty, 1967), Pramod Pati (Explorer, 1968), and T.A. Abraham (Face to Face, 1967) used non-linear, self-referential modes that challenged official narratives. In subsequent decades, Joshy Joseph continued to make such film like  Wearing the Face (2000), which critiques state power within  institutional limits.\nIndependent documentry\nSince the late 1970s, India has seen a movement of independent documentary filmmaking, developed outside the institutional framework of the Films Division. This movement was directly related to social and political activism. It involved filmmakers such as Anand Patwardhan, Goutam Ghose, and Tapan Bose, who made documentaries that challenged state discourses and exposed human rights abuses.\n, one of the most recognised independent documentry filmmaker, speaking at the ViBGYOR Film Festival in 2011]]\nOne of the earliest examples of this emerging independent practice was Hungry Autumn (1974), directed by Goutam Ghose, which documented the famine in West Bengal. It was  followed by Waves of Revolution (1975), directed by Anand Patwardhan during the Emergency. This film documented Jayprakash Narayan movement in Bihar and was produced outside the regular channels under heavy censorship. His later films, including Bombay: Our City (1985), In the Name of God (1992), and Father, Son, and Holy War (1995), continued to explore themes of social injustice and rising Hindu nationalism, and they often faced censorship and legal challenges, notably with War and Peace (2002). Today, Anand Patwardhan is widely regarded as one of the most influential and pioneering figures in the Indian independent documentry scene.\nShyam Benegal's early documentaries such as A Child of the Streets (1967) and Quest for a Nation (1970) examined the aspirations and struggles of a newly independent India. Rakesh Sharma's Final Solution (2004) critically addressed the 2002 Gujarat riots. Saba Dewan's trilogy: Delhi-Mumbai-Delhi (2006), Naach (2008), and The Other Song (2009) explored cultural histories of women performers, while Leena Manimekalai's Mathamma (2002) highlighted caste and gender oppression.\nOver the last few decades, according to Shweta Kishore, the meaning of \"independent\" documentary in India has evolved. Kishore notes that originally it referred to films produced wholly outside state agencies such as the Films Division. However, independent filmmakers currently work with a variety of actors ranging from state institutions, NGOs, and private donors to international institutions. For example, Anand Patwardhan, who has often faced state censorship, has also earned institutional awards, as in the 2014 Films Division Lifetime Achievement Award given to him. These developments indicate a more complex relation between dissent and legitimacy within the space of independent documentary cinemas. Film scholar Camille Deprez notes that, after the 1990s, state bodies support independent filmmakers through a \"policy of greater openness\".\nPost 1990s developments\nNotable documentaries\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
