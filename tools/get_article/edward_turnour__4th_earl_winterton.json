The 4th Earl also had one of the finest beagle packs of the time, rivaled only by those of Prince Albert and the Rev. Phillip Honeywood, from whose pack the entire line of modern beagles is descended.\nHe was commissioned as Captain of the 6th (Petworth) Sussex Rifle Volunteer Corps on 26 April 1860.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
