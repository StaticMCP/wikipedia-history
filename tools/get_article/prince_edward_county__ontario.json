Its coastline on Lake Ontario’s northeastern shore is known for Sandbanks Provincial Park, sand beaches, and limestone cliffs. The Regent Theatre, a restored Edwardian Opera  House, sits at the heart of the town of Picton on the Bay of Quinte. Nearby Macaulay Heritage Park highlights local history through its 19th-century buildings. In 2021, Prince Edward County had a census population of 25,704. Prince Edward County is a single-tier municipality and a census division of the Canadian province of Ontario.\nHistory\nSettled by indigenous peoples, the county has significant archeological sites. These include the LeVescounte Mounds of the Point Peninsula complex people, built about 2000 years ago.\nThe county was created by Upper Canada's founding lieutenant-governor John Graves Simcoe on July 16, 1792.  It was named after Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent (the fourth son of King George III and father of Queen Victoria) who was commander-in-chief of British North America.\nShortly after the American Revolution, the Crown made land grants to some of the earliest United Empire Loyalists to encourage their settlements in Ontario and provide compensation for property lost in the Thirteen Colonies.  The county was originally composed of three townships named in honour of three of George III's daughters.\nFor many years Prince Edward County has been closely associated with the wholly mainland Hastings County. Its longtime militia unit has been The Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment (locally known as the Hasty Ps), whose most famous member was Farley Mowat. This noted author wrote two books about  his experiences with the Hasty Ps during the Second World War's Italian Campaign:  The Regiment and a subsequent account, And No Birds Sang.\nOn January 1, 1998, the Town of Picton, the villages of Bloomfield and Wellington, and the townships of Ameliasburgh, Athol, Hallowell, Hillier, North Marysburgh, Sophiasburgh, and South Marysburgh amalgamated to form a new municipality with the official legal name of Prince Edward County. Each of the former municipalities is now a ward.\nFormer municipalities\nThe following are former municipalities:\n*Ameliasburgh, named after Princess Amelia, youngest daughter of George III\n*Athol\n*Bloomfield\n*Hallowell, named after Captain Benjamin Hallowell (1723–1799)), eminent Loyalist, formerly of Boston. He was the father-in-law of Chief Justice John Elmsley.\n*Hillier, organized in 1823, and named after Major George Hillier, military secretary to Sir Peregrine Maitland.\n*North Marysburgh, surveyed in 1785 and settled by Loyalist veterans, some of Hessian birth. Named for Princess Mary, Duchess of Gloucester and Edinburgh, one of George III's daughters.\n*Sophiasburgh, named for Princess Sophia, one of George III's daughters. Surveyed in 1785 and 1787, settled by Loyalists from Nova Scotia and the Mainland.\n*South Marysburgh, also named for Princess Mary, Duchess of Gloucester and Edinburgh, one of George III's daughters.\n*Picton, named for Sir Thomas Picton\n*Wellington, named after Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington\nGeography\nMap of Prince Edward County\nPrince Edward County is located in Southern Ontario on a large irregular headland or littoral at the eastern end of Lake Ontario, just west of the head of the St. Lawrence River. This headland (officially named Prince Edward County in 1792) is surrounded on the north and east by the Bay of Quinte. As the Murray Canal now connects the bay to Lake Ontario across the only land connection, the county is technically an island.  Murray Canal is crossed by two, 2-lane swing bridges, the western one on County Road 64, and at the eastern end, the County Road 33 bridge.  Bay of Quinte is crossed by two, 2-lane bridges of about 850m length – one carrying Provincial Highway 62 near Belleville and the other about 24&nbsp;km east carrying Provincial Highway 49 near Deseronto.\nClimate\nThe county's relatively mild humid continental climate (Dfb) due to the influence of Lake Ontario has led to the establishment of about 50 vineyards and close to 30 wineries; as a result, Prince Edward County is one of Ontario's designated viticultural areas.  The lake effect from Lake Ontario results in heavier snowfall than in neighbouring counties. July is the hottest month and January is the coldest month.\n|date=July 2012\n}}\nLandscape\n.]]\nPrince Edward County is a community encompassing approximately , with over  of shoreline (including inland lakes and bordered by Lake Ontario) with beaches and limestone rich soil.\nCommunities\nPrince Edward County includes the population centres of Picton and Wellington and the communities of Albury, Ameliasburg, Bloomfield, Carrying Place, Cherry Valley, Consecon, Cressy, Demorestville, Fawcettville, Glenora, Hillier, Lake on the Mountain, Milford, Mountain View, Northport, Rednersville, Rosehall, Rossmore, Salmon Point, Sophiasburgh, Waupoos, Waupoos Island, West Lake, Woodrous, and Yerexville.\nDemographics\n|1996| 25,046\n|2001| 24,901\n|2006| 25,496\n|2011| 25,258\n|2016| 24,735\n|2021|25,704}}\nIn the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Prince Edward County had a population of  living in  of its  total private dwellings, a change of |24735|1}} from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of  in 2021.\nAttractions\nMusic festivals\nPrince Edward County is home to the Music at Port Milford Chamber Music Academy & Festival, Classical Unbound Festival, the PEC Jazz Festival, and the Prince Edward County Chamber Music Festival.\nMusic at Port Milford, established in 1987 is said to bring together promising young musicians for a chamber music summer camp and festival on the shores of South Bay. In the summer, PEC also hosts the Classical Unbound Festival, with performances of classical music in unconventional venues and contexts by Canadian musicians, and the Jazz Festival in the month of August. Some of Canada's most prolific jazz musicians gather in the county for this festival.\nVacationing\nPrince Edward County has become a vacation destination with Sandbanks Provincial Park, and Ontario's newest VQA wine Appellation as the twin centrepieces of the tourism industry. Hotels, motels and bed & breakfast accommodations are abundant.\nWater activities\nPrince Edward County's main water attractions are said to be its white sand beaches. Together, Sandbanks Provincial Park, North Beach Provincial Park attract over 600,000 visitors yearly. There are numerous campgrounds throughout the County which allow tourists to enjoy water-sports such as those offered through Westlake Wakeboarding School, kayaking, canoeing, tubing, and more.\nSkateboarding and BMXing\nBeside the historic Crystal Palace is the County Youth Park.  While the region is known for a large retirement community, young people come to the County to visit the skatepark and playground located in the corner of the Picton Fairgrounds property (which also holds the Picton Arena, the Prince Edward Curling Club & Crystal Palace). For example, the YoungLife youth event \"Road Rage\" had teens of all ages visiting skateboard parks across Ontario and then entering their homemade skateboarding video into a contest; Picton was one of their stops.\nDining\nPrince Edward County in recent years has said to have become a top culinary destination, from the historic Black River Cheese Company which started operations in 1901 to the new LEED-certified, award-winning Fifth Town Artisan Cheese Factory.\nThe county held the annual Great Canadian Cheese Festival from 2010 through 2017. This festival, held at the Picton Fairgrounds in June, had cheese-makers from all across Canada who offered more than 125 artisan cheeses for tasting and purchase. The festival also included non-cheese related artisan foods such as breads and condiments, wine, cider and craft beer. It has been on hiatus since 2018.\nWith an increasing number of cultural activities — in part due to the emigration of top artists and chefs to the area – like the \"Taste\" celebration or \"Six Barrels for Six Chefs\", the County has created a niche in the new Creative Economy. “It's yet another point of pride for Prince Edward County, which has become the gastronomic capital of Ontario — a fertile island bursting with vineyards, organic farms and a community of artists and chefs. Tucked into the \"golden triangle\" between Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa, it is the province's newest Designated Viticultural Area, which helps identify the origin of a wine and its grapes.” (The Globe and Mail)\nBirding\nEvents also include the Spring Birding Festival; Prince Edward County Authors' Festival; the County Jazz Festival, a summer event; the Prince Edward County Music Festival (a chamber music series) held on the same fall weekend as the Prince Edward County Studio and Gallery Tour; \"Music at Port Milford,\" a summer music festival and school for string students from 12–18 years old, and an annual season of professional theatre produced by Festival Players of Prince Edward County.\nTheatre\nOne of the few surviving art-deco movie houses in Ontario, Picton's downtown Regent Theatre, is host to a variety of plays, musicals and art movie screenings throughout the year. Prince Edward County has a live comedy scene with Taste That! producing regular improv and sketch comedy shows throughout the County since 2015, and the annual Comedy Country festival that pairs local acts with professional comedians from across Canada.  Theatre companies include: the County Stage Company, Prince Edward Community Theatre and The Marysburgh Mummers.\nWineries, distilleries, and cider\nPrince Edward County is home to many wineries, distilleries, and hard-cider companies.

Devils Wishbone Winery, Domaine Darius, Exultet Estates, Grange of Prince Edward Estate Winery, Gravel Hill Vineyards, Half Moon Bay Winery, Harwood Estate Wineyard, Hillier Creek Estates, Hinterland Wine Company, Hubbs Creek Vineyard, Huff Estates Winery, Karlo Estates, Keint-he Winery & Vineyard, Lacey Estates Winery, Lighthall Vineyards, Norman Hardie Winery, Rosehall Run, Sandbanks Winery, Stanners Vineyard, Sugarbush Vineyard, Thirty Three Vines Winery, Three Dog Winery, Trail Estate Winery, Traynor Family Vineyard, and Waupoos Estates Winery and Vineyard.\nSports\nHockey\nWellington Dukes, located in the village of Wellington, 15 kilometers west of Picton in Prince Edward County, are a prominent fixture in the II-tier league. Over the past twelve seasons, the Wellington Dukes consistently secure top positions in their league.\nThe Prince Edward Community Centre at 375 Main Street serves as the home arena for the Picton Pirates Junior C Hockey Team, known as the \"Patcheyes.\" The Picton Pirates, founded in 1989, participate in the Eastern Ontario Junior C Hockey League.\nPicton claimed the 2011 Empire \"B\" Junior C Championship by defeating the Amherstview Jets 4–3 and the defending champions, Napanee Raiders, 4–2 in best-of-seven series. In 2013, the Pirates added to their legacy by winning the Ontario Hockey Association's Schmalz Cup, solidifying their Junior C supremacy in the province with a five-game victory over the Essex 73's.\nSailing\nPrince Edward County boasts over 500 kilometers of shoreline, offering numerous sheltered harbors and boating facilities. The region's rich sailing history is preserved at the Mariners Park Museum in South Marysburgh. Additionally, Picton is home to the Archives and Collections Society which houses an extensive collection of documents related to the Great Lakes, maritime history, and navigation.\nThe Prince Edward County Yacht Club, situated in Picton Harbour, offers a junior sailing program for youngsters aged 10–18, utilizing monohull dinghies for on-water instruction. The program is led by CYA certified instructors, and so successful participants receive CYA certificates.\nFor those seeking sailing adventures, County Sailing Adventures provides daily cruises departing from Waupoos Marina, offering access to some of the finest freshwater sailing grounds globally. Visitors can sail to the edge of the Marysburgh Vortex or anchor off Little Bluff for lunch and a refreshing swim.\nGovernment\n| zoom =9\n| caption = Map of Prince Edward County, showing the towns, villages and townships of its ten wards.\n| minimap=file\n| mini-file = Ontario Locator Map.svg\n| mini-width = 79\n| mini-height = 77\n| minipog-x = 68| minipog-y = 56| scalemark = 76\n| map-data=Q385085\n| mark-coord =  | label=Picton| label-pos=right| mark-size=6| label-size=0|label-color=#665555 |mark-title=Picton, Ontario| mark-image=Picton, Prince Edward County 2010 54.jpg\n| label1=Bloomfield| mark-coord1=|label-color1=soft grey|label-size1=10| mark-size1=6| label-pos1=right| mark-title1=Bloomfield, Ontario\n| label2= Wellington| mark-coord2=| mark-title2=Wellington, Ontario\n| label3=Ameliasburgh| mark-coord3=| label-pos3=left| mark-title3=Ameliasburgh Township, Ontario\n| label4=A T H O L| mark-coord4=| label-pos4=top| mark-size4=0| label-size4=8| label-color4=dark red| mark-title4=Athol, Prince Edward County, Ontario\n| label5=H A L L O W E L L| mark-coord5=|label-pos5=top| mark-size5=0| label-size5=8| label-color5=dark red| mark-title5=Hallowell, Ontario\n| label6=Hillier| mark-coord6=| mark-title6=Hillier, Ontario\n| label7=S O U T H| labela7=M A R Y S B U R G H | mark-coord7=|label-pos7=bottom| mark-size7=0| label-size7=8| label-color7=dark red| mark-title7=South Marysburgh Township, Ontario\n| label8=N O R T H| labela8=M A R Y S B U R G H | mark-coord8=|label-pos8=right| mark-size8=0| label-size8=8| label-color8=dark red| mark-title8=North Marysburgh Township, Ontario\n| label9=S O P H I A S B U R G H | mark-coord9=|label-pos9=top| mark-size9=0| label-size9=8| label-color9=dark red| mark-title9=Sophiasburgh Township\n| mark-coord11= | label11=L a k e   O n t a r i o| label-angle11=-7|label-color11=soft blue|mark-size11=0|mark-title11=none\n| mark-coord12= | label12=Bay of Quinte| label-angle12=-6|label-color12=soft blue|label-size12=9| mark-size12=0|mark-title12=none\n| mark-coord14= | label14=Prince| labela14=Edward| labelb14=Bay| label-angle14=0|label-color14=soft blue|label-size14=9| mark-size14=0|mark-title14=none\n| mark-coord15= | label15=Adolphus Reach| label-angle15=-37|label-color15=soft blue|label-size15=9| mark-size15=0|mark-title15=none\n| arc-coordA= | arc-textA=Wellington Bay| arc-text-colorA=soft blue| arc-text-sizeA=9|arc-angleA=35|\narc-gapA=2.5| arc-radiusA=0.22\n}}\nDespite the official name, Prince Edward is not a county by the standard Ontario definition. It is a single-tier municipal government and handles all municipal services.  The former county seat and current council hall is located at the Shire Hall, in Picton. Officially, the area is the smallest single-tier municipality in Ontario and consists of the merged governments of the original county and the 10 former towns, villages and townships, that governed the area until 1997.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
