He was honorary secretary of the Institute of Sculptors circa 1861.\nEarly life\nEdward Bowring Stephens was born in Exeter, the son of James Stephens (1777&ndash;1849), a statuary mason. His middle name may relate to a familial tie with the prominent Bowring family of Exeter, descended from local wool merchants, a member of which was Sir John Bowring (1792&ndash;1872), Governor of Hong Kong, whose marble bust was sculpted by Stephens and is now in the collection of the Devon and Exeter Institution, Exeter., Stephens' early master: \"Bicton, seat of the Right Hon'ble Lord Rolle. J. Gendall delt. London, R Ackermann\". Engraving, c.1820]]\nStephens began his artistic training as a pupil of the Exeter-based draughtsman and landscape painter John Gendall (d.1865), who gave classes at his premises at 'Mol's Coffee House'. In 1835, aged 20 he moved to London to become a pupil of the sculptor Edward Hodges Baily (1788–1867). In 1836 he was admitted as a student of the Royal Academy and in 1837 gained a silver medal at the Society of Arts for a small original model of Ajax defying the Gods. His first exhibits were in 1838 at the Royal Academy, of Narcissus, An Arcadian Nymph, Maternal Love, and a bust. The next year he sent for exhibit Diana and another bust. Early in 1839 he travelled to Rome, Italy, where he stayed for three years and gained valuable experience.\nCareer\nby E. B. Stephens, before the Magistrate's court, Tavistock. Erected by public subscription, 1864]]\nIn about 1842 Stephens returned from Italy to London and in 1843 was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Academy for a small relief work of The Battle of the Centaurs and Lapithæ. At about this time he gained a commission for a life-size statue in marble of John Rolle, 1st Baron Rolle (d.1842), of Bicton House near Exeter. The work is signed \"1844\", and may therefore have been posthumous. The bust remains on display in Bicton House in 2013. In 1845 he assisted in the decoration of the summer pavilion at Buckingham Palace and sent two of his group sculptures the Great Exhibition of 1851, where they attracted notice: Satan Vanquished and Satan tempting Eve, for a chimneypiece at Buckingham Palace. In 1864 Stephens was elected an associate of the Royal Academy, but possibly in the mistaken belief on the part of the members that he was Alfred Stevens, the sculptor of the Wellington monument in St. Paul's Cathedral, London. He exhibited many works at the Royal Academy, including busts, statues and groups, frequently of contemporary Devon notables.\nPromotes Exeter School of Art\nStephens promoted the establishment of the School of Art which opened in Queen Street, Exeter, in 1854. Its transformation into a city museum was the result of a local initiative following the death of Prince Albert in 1861 when in the following year at a public meeting in the Exeter Guildhall chaired by the mayor it was agreed \"desirable to erect a memorial in the City of Exeter to His late Royal Highness the Prince Consort\". The result was the Royal Albert Memorial Museum, in Queen Street, Exeter, opened in 1868, which incorporated adjuncts for the study of art, science and literature. One of its original curators, who acquired for it many of the early exhibits, was Stephens' old master John Gendall, who however died in 1865 before the opening. In 1862 Stephens offered to the planned museum plastercast copies of any his works they \"thought worthy of acceptance\". He also offered to execute a memorial statue of the Prince without charge for his labour, the museum committee to pay for the materials only. At the museum's opening the resultant statue was in situ within an aedicule on the landing of the grand staircase, where it remains in 2013. Following the death of John Gendall in 1865, Stephens tried unsuccessfully to raise public funds to purchase for the museum from Gendall's widow his collection of prints and paintings. Following Stephens' death in 1882 the Earl of Devon also tried without success to organise the purchase for the museum of his work The Bathers.\nMarriage\nOn 24 July 1845 at Crediton, Devon, Stephens married Jane Harris Emes (b. 1814), the daughter of James Emes, a serge manufacturer of Crediton. She was living in 1871, listed in that year's census with the occupation \"Sculptor's Wife\". His London address was Cirencester Place, Fitzroy Square, then 1a Hampstead Street, Fitzroy Square and finally 110 Buckingham Palace Road, Pimlico.\nDeath\nHe died at his London home, 110 Buckingham Palace Road, on 10 Nov. 1882. His final exhibit at the Royal Academy was shown posthumously in 1883.\nWorks\nBusts\nKG, Lord Lieutenant of Devon\"'', Marble bust by Edward Bowring Stephens, 1861; Memorial Hall, West Buckland School, Devon]]\nThe subjects of his busts included: Lord Palmerston, Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 10th Baronet Henry Phillpotts, Bishop of Exeter, William Courtenay, 11th Earl of Devon (at Powderham Castle), Hugh Fortescue, 2nd Earl Fortescue and Rev.

Miller, Esq., MD; The Dean of Exeter; General Gage John Hall (1832-1854); W.S. Kelsall, Esq.\nMonumental statues in Devon\nOne of his earliest works were the two identical life-size seated statues in white marble of John Rolle, 1st Baron Rolle (d.1842), one dated 1843 at Lupton House, Brixham, the other dated 1844 at Bicton House, Lord Rolle's seat. Many of his life-size standing statues were made to adorn the streets of his native city of Exeter. These included Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 10th Baronet (1862), now in Northernhay Gardens, beneath the castle walls; Hugh Fortescue, 2nd Earl Fortescue (1863), erected in the centre of the Castle Yard of Exeter Castle, since removed to the grass verge; William Courtenay, 11th Earl of Devon (1880/81) originally in Bedford Circus, since moved to Northernhay Gardens, whose deceased wife Elizabeth Fortescue he also sculpted as a recumbent effigy in Powderham parish church, with a plaster-cast in the chapel at Powderham Castle, Devon.

It now stands at the entrance of Northernhay Gardens, Exeter. It was made in 1875, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1876, and was purchased by public subscription for display in Bedford Circus, Exeter, where it was unveiled on 30 August 1878, on a granite plinth surrounded by decorative iron railings made by Garton and King. However, it did not remain there long and after a proposed move in 1800 to London Inn Square was rejected its new home was decided on as Northernhay Gardens, below the walls of Exeter Castle, where it was unveiled on 8 October 1880 and where it remains today, without railings. Its place in Bedford Circus was taken by Stephens' statue of William Courtenay, 11th Earl of Devon, which too was later moved to Northernhay Gardens. Stephens produced two other versions of The \"Deers talker\": a small bronze signed and dated \"E B Stephens ARA, 1878\" and inscribed by the foundry \"J L Thomas & Co, Exeter\", measuring 30.5&nbsp;cm by 31&nbsp;cm (12\" by 12 1/4\"), exhibited in 1876 as no.1435. This was sold at Sotheby's, London on 2 November 2001, lot 249,\nand a marble figure exhibited in 1873 as no.1504.\nFile:The Deer Stalker in Northernhay Gardens.jpg|E. B.
