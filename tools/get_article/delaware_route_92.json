The route runs from DE&nbsp;100 near Montchanin east to U.S. Route&nbsp;13 (US&nbsp;13) in Claymont. The road is a two-lane rural road between the western terminus and US&nbsp;202, passing through Brandywine Creek State Park and the Brandywine Valley section of First State National Historical Park. East of US&nbsp;202, DE&nbsp;92 is a four-lane divided highway called Naamans Road that passes through suburban areas to the north of Wilmington, with an interchange at Interstate&nbsp;95 (I-95) in Claymont. DE&nbsp;92 was first built as a state highway east of US&nbsp;202 during the 1920s and 1930s. By 1968, the route was designated onto its current alignment. In the 1990s, DE&nbsp;92 east of US&nbsp;202 was widened into a divided highway.\nRoute description\nDE&nbsp;92 begins at the intersection with DE&nbsp;100 and Adams Dam Road near Montchanin. The route runs northeast on two-lane undivided Thompson Bridge Road, crossing Wilson Run and passing through farmland to the north of Brandywine Creek State Park. The road continues into forested areas of the state park, crossing the Brandywine Creek. After the state park, DE&nbsp;92 heads into areas of fields and woods within the Brandywine Valley section of First State National Historical Park. The state route leaves the park and continues northeast along Ramsey Road before curving to the north, passing near farmland. The route turns east onto Beaver Valley Road, widening into a four-lane divided highway as it passes south of business parks and north of the Brandywine Campus of Wilmington University before it intersects US&nbsp;202 in Brandywine.\nPast the US&nbsp;202 intersection, DE&nbsp;92 becomes Naamans Road and passes to the south of the Brandywine Town Center shopping center, where a park and ride lot is located, as it continues into residential and commercial areas and intersects Shipley Road. Past the Brandywine Town Center, the route heads through neighborhoods in Brandywine Hundred and has a junction with Grubb Road before it runs to the south of Concord High School and intersects Ebright Road, which goes north to Ebright Azimuth (the highest point in Delaware) and into Pennsylvania. After this, the road comes to an intersection with DE&nbsp;261 in Ways Corner.\nFarther east, DE&nbsp;92 reaches a junction with the northern terminus of DE&nbsp;3 in Hanbys Corner. Past the Darley Road intersection, the route passes north of a church that is home to a park and ride lot. From here, the road intersects Carpenter Station Road in Carpenter, where there is a park and ride lot on the southeast corner, before it crosses over CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision railroad line on a bridge and turns to the east-southeast. The route heads into business areas in Claymont and comes to a diamond interchange with I-95 at the northern terminus of I-495; the southbound exit at this interchange is from I-495 while the other ramps connect directly with I-95. After the I-95 interchange, DE&nbsp;92 passes to the south of the former Tri-State Mall and crosses Naamans Creek before it has a westbound right-in/right-out intersection with the southern terminus of DE&nbsp;491. Past this intersection, the route turns southeast and has a junction with Ridge Road before ending at US&nbsp;13 south of the Robinson House.\nDE&nbsp;92 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 30,848&nbsp;vehicles at the Harvey Road intersection to a low of 6,643&nbsp;vehicles at the Creek Road intersection. The portion of DE&nbsp;92 east of US 202 is part of the National Highway System.\nHistory\nBy 1920, what is now DE&nbsp;92 originally existed as a county road, with the portion east of Foulk Road proposed to become a state highway. The state highway between Foulk Road and Philadelphia Pike was completed four years later. By 1931, the portion of road between Grubb Road and Foulk Road was upgraded to a state highway. The state highway portion was extended west to Concord Pike by 1936.\nBy 1968, DE&nbsp;92 was designated onto its current alignment between DE&nbsp;100 and US&nbsp;13, with the easternmost portion replacing what had been designated a part of US&nbsp;13&nbsp;Bypass. DE&nbsp;92 was widened into a divided highway by 1997 between US&nbsp;202 and DE&nbsp;261 and between DE&nbsp;3 and DE&nbsp;491. Two years later, the road was upgraded to a divided highway between DE&nbsp;261 and DE&nbsp;3.\nMajor intersections\n|notes=Western terminus\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=Northern terminus of DE&nbsp;3\n}}\n|notes=Exit 11 on I-95\n}}\n|notes=Westbound exit and entrance; southern terminus of DE&nbsp;491\n}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus\n}}\nSee also\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.aaroads.com/guides/de-092/ DE&nbsp;92 at AARoads.com]\n* [https://www.alpsroads.net/roads/de/de_92/ Delaware Roads - DE&nbsp;92]"
