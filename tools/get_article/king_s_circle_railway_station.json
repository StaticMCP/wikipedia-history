King's Circle and Matunga stations are next to each other albeit the latter is on the Central line. It is named after the King's Circle Park, which was named after George V, the King-Emperor. The trains passing through King's Circle station are only the ones going to Bandra, Andheri and Goregaon from CSMT or Panvel and vice versa. In March of 2024 re-naming the station Tirthankar Parshvanath after Parshvanatha received official approval, though it is unclear when or if this has happened.\nSee also\n*Maheshwari Udyan, Mumbai\n*Mumbai Suburban Railway\nReferences"
