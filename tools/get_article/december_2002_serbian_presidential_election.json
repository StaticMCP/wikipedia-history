They followed elections in September and October which were invalidated due to voter turnout not meeting the 50% requirement. Although the legal requirement of a turnout of at least 50% of registered voters was dropped for the second round of this election, turnout in the first round was below 50%, invalidating the election before a second round.\nDuring the election the Socialist Party of Serbia supported Vojislav Šešelj, the leader of Serbian Radical Party, while New Serbia supported Vojislav Koštunica and the Democratic Party of Serbia.\nResults\nReferences"
