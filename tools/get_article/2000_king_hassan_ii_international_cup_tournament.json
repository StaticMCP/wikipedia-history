It took place in the summer of 2000, less than a week before the Euro 2000. Matches were held on 4  and 6 June 2000 in Morocco. Host nation Morocco, France (who went on to win the Euro the following month), Japan and Jamaica participated in the tournament, and all matches took place at the Stade Mohamed V, home of Moroccan clubs Raja Casablanca and Wydad Casablanca. The tournament was played in a cup format, with only four games played (two semi-finals, a final and a third-place match).\nThe last edition of the Hassan II Trophy tournament was won by France after beating Morocco in the final 5-1.\nParticipating teams\n* (host)\n*\n*\n*\nResults\n|2 (2)| (pen)|2 (4)\n|4 June||1||0\n|6 June||5||1\n|6 June||4||0}}\nSemifinals\n|report = [https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/euro2000/teams/france/777250.stm Report]\n|score = 2-2\n|team2 =\n|goals1 = Morishima Nishizawa\n|goals2 = Zidane Djorkaeff\n|stadium = Stade Mohamed V, Casablanca\n|attendance = 40,000\n|referee = Abderrahim El Arjoun (Morocco)\n|penalties1 = Nakata Miura Inamoto Nanami\n|penaltyscore = 2-4\n|penalties2 =  Djorkaeff Anelka Henry Leboeuf\n}}\n----\n|report = [https://www.11v11.com/matches/morocco-v-jamaica-04-june-2000-268314/ Report]\n|score = 1-0\n|team2 =\n|goals1 = Zerouali\n|goals2 =\n|stadium = Stade Mohamed V, Casablanca\n|attendance = 40,000\n|referee =\n}}\nThird place match\n|score = 4-0|\n|team2 =\n|report = [https://www.11v11.com/matches/japan-v-jamaica-06-june-2000-268316/ Report]\n|goals1 = Jo A.
