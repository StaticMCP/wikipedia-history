      "text": "# 2004 New Mexico Democratic presidential caucuses\n\nSenator John Kerry, the frontrunner for the nomination, won the 2004 New Mexico Caucus on Mini-Tuesday, February 3, 2004, by a landslide.  weeks ago before the election, third place finisher Howard Dean was leading former army general Wesley Clark 16% to 18%. Kerry got the endorsement of Lieutenant Governor of New Mexico Diane D. Denish. Wesley Clark got the most endorsements out of anyone. He got Mayor of Santa Fe Larry Delgado, candidate for offices Roberto A. Mondragon, congressional candidate Richard Romero and the Albuquerque Tribune. Governor Howard Dean got an endorsement from former Oklahoma senator Fred Harris and former governor Toney Anaya. Joe Lieberman yet again faced another disappointing showing in the primaries.\nResults\n{| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-----\n! bgcolor=\"#ffc0c0\" | Candidate\n! bgcolor=\"#ffc0c0\" | No. State Delegates\n! bgcolor=\"#ffc0c0\" | Percentage\n! bgcolor=\"#ffc0c0\" | Potential National delegates\n|-----\n| John Kerry || 19,154   || 36.30 || 14\n|-----\n| Wesley Clark || 10,992 || 20.83 || 8\n|-----\n| Howard Dean || 9,416 || 17.84 || 4\n|-----\n| John Edwards || 5,410 || 10.25 || 0\n|-----\n| Dennis Kucinich || 2,427  || 4.60 || 0\n|-----\n| Joe Lieberman || 1,306 || 2.48 || 0\n|-----\n|}\nReferences"
