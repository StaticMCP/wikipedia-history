Directed by Robert F. McGowan, the two-reel short was released to theaters in July 1923 by Pathé Exchange. The short was filmed alongside Why Worry?, a feature comedy produced by Roach and starring Harold Lloyd, who makes a cameo appearance in Dogs of War as himself.\nPlot\nNear West Coast Studios in Hollywood, the gang is waging a street war against a rival group of kids; their ammunition primarily consisting of old vegetables. The battle is halted when Mary is called to act in one of the West Coast films. The rest of the gang tries to crash the studio gates and get a role in the picture, but the casting director throws them out. Farina manages to sneak into the studio, however, prompting the other kids to sneak in after him. Several chases throughout the property then ensue and the gang eventually escapes - with a little help from Harold Lloyd.\nFile:Erniemorrison.jpg|Sunshine Sammy at war\nFile:Mickeydaniels.jpg|Mickey Daniels is a \"genrel\"\nFile:Marykornman.jpg|Mary Kornman is the troops' nurse\nFile:Joe Cobb.jpg|Joe Cobb wants to earn \"fi'\" dollars\nFile:Jackie Condon.jpg|Jackie Condon\nFile:Allen Hoskins as Farina (1923).jpg|Farina in Dogs of War!\nCast\nThe Gang\n* Joe Cobb as Joe\n* Jackie Condon as Jackie\n* Mickey Daniels as Mickey\n* Jack Davis as Jack\n* Allen Hoskins as Farina\n* Mary Kornman as Mary\n* Ernest Morrison as Ernie \"Sunshine Sammy\"\nAdditional cast\n* Andy Samuel as Rival gang member\n* George \"Freckles\" Warde as Rival gang member\n* Gabe Saienz as Rival gang member\n* Elmo Billings as Rival gang member\n* Harold Lloyd as himself\n* Jobyna Ralston as herself\n* Roy Brooks as Studio receptionist\n* Sammy Brooks as Studio crew member\n* Bob Davis as Truck driver\n* Dick Gilbert as Studio guard\n* William Gillespie as Studio director\n* Clara Guiol as Studio actress\n* Wallace Howe as Actor around the lot\n* Walter Lundin as Harold Lloyd's cameraman\n* Joseph Morrison as Studio assistant director\n* Fred Newmeyer as Harold Lloyd's cameraman\n* Charles Stevenson as Studio actor\n* Leo White as Actor around the lot\n* Charley Young as Studio cameraman\nNotes\n* When the television rights for the original silent Pathé Our Gang comedies were sold to National Telepix and other distributors, several episodes were retitled.
