Canvas screens were erected around the ground in 1892 to prevent people watching matches without paying. In 1893 a match was played against Wisbech Town under electric lights. A stand was built in 1896, although it was demolished in 1905, replaced by a 500-seat wooden grandstand built at a cost of £250. In the mid-1950s the Supporters Club installed terracing for 4,000 and 780 seats on the northern side of the pitch. In 1955 the wooden stand was sold to a company in Spalding and a new grandstand seating 1,400 with a terraced paddock holding 3,000 was built at a cost of £27,000 and opened by then FIFA President and FA Chairman Arthur Drewry on 18 August 1956.\nFloodlights were installed in 1963 and used for the first time in a Culey Festival Cup match against Cambridge City on 25 September.\nHonours\n*National League\n**National League North champions 2019–20\n*Northern Premier League\n**Division One South champions 2012–13\n*Norfolk Senior Cup\n**Winners 2016–17\nRecords\n*Best FA Cup performance: Second round, 2020–21, 2022–23\n*Best FA Trophy performance: Third round, 2012–13\n*Best FA Vase performance: Semi-finals, 2010–11\n*Biggest victory: 10–1 vs Raunds Town, United Counties League Premier Division, 1 January 2011\nSee also\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.kltown.co.uk Official website]"
