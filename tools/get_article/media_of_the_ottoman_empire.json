The earliest was printed in September 1795 by the Palais de France in Pera (now Beyoğlu), during the embassy of Raymond de Verninac-Saint-Maur. It was issued fortnightly under the title \"Bulletin de Nouvelles\", until March 1796, it seems. Afterwards, it was published under the name \"Gazette française de Constantinople\" from September 1796 to May 1797, and \"Mercure Oriental\" from May to July 1797. Its main purpose was to convey information about the politics of Post-Revolutionary France to foreigners living in Istanbul; therefore, it had little impact on local population.\nIn 1800, during the French occupation of Egypt, a newspaper in Arabic, Al-Tanbih (The Alert), was planned to be issued, with the purpose of disseminating in Egypt the ideals of the French Revolution. It was founded by the general Jacques-François Menou, who appointed Ismail al-Khashab as its editor. However, there is doubt the newspaper was actually ever printed. Menou eventually capitulated after Alexandria was besieged by British forces in 1801.\nIn 1828, Khedive of Egypt Muhammad Ali ordered, as part of the drastic reforms he was implementing in the province, the local establishment of the gazette Vekâyi-i Mısriyye (Egyptian Affairs), written in Ottoman Turkish in one column with an Arabic translation in a second column (Ottoman Turkish text was in the right one and Arabic text in the left one). It was later edited in Arabic only, under the Arabic title \"Al-Waqaʾiʿ al-Miṣriyya\" (The Egyptian Affairs).\nThe first official gazette of the Ottoman State was published in 1831, on the order of Mahmud II. It was entitled \"Le Moniteur ottoman\", perhaps referring to the French newspaper Le Moniteur universel. Its weekly issues were written in French and edited by Alexandre Blacque at the expense of the Porte. A few months later, a firman of the sultan ordered that a Turkish gazette be published under the named \"Takvim-i Vekayi\" (Calendar of Affairs), which would be effectively translating Le Moniteur ottoman, and issued irregularly until November 4, 1922. Laws and decrees of the sultan were published in it, as well as descriptions of court festivities.\nThe first non-official Turkish newspaper, Ceride-i Havadis (Register of Events), was published by an Englishman, William Churchill, in 1840. The first private newspaper to be published by Turkish journalists, Tercüman-ı Ahvâl (Ottoman Turkish: Interpreter of Events), was founded by İbrahim Şinasi and Agah Efendi and issued in October 1860; the owners stated that \"freedom of expression is a part of human nature\", thereby initiating an era of free press as inspired by the ideals of 18th century French Enlightenment. In the meantime, the first private newspaper written solely in Arabic, ''Mir'at al-ahwal, had been founded by a Syrian poet, Rizqallah Hassun, in 1855, but it had been suspended a year later by Ottoman authorities because of its critical tone regarding their policies. Subsequently, several newspapers flourished in the provinces. A new press code inspired by French law, Matbuat Nizamnamesi'', was issued in 1864, accompanied by the establishment of a censorship office.\nWhen Sultan Abdulhamid II revoked the constitution, Ottomans established newspapers based in foreign countries as they felt they could no longer operate freely in the empire. Elisabeth Kendall, author of \"Between Politics and Literature: Journals in Alexandria and Istanbul at the End of the Nineteenth Century,\" wrote that therefore by the 1880s \"purer cultural journalism\" became the focus of publications that remained in the imperial capital.\nBy city\nThe Ottoman capital, Constantinople (now Istanbul), was the centre of the press activity.\nIn 1876 there were forty-seven journals published in Constantinople. Most were in minority and foreign languages, and thirteen of them were in Ottoman Turkish. Many newspapers in non-Muslim minority and foreign languages were produced in Galata, with production in daylight hours and distribution at nighttime; Ottoman authorities did not allow production of the Galata-based newspapers at night.\nKendall wrote that Constantinople by the 1870s lacked specialised literary journals found in Alexandria, Egypt. What journals that were in Constantinople had a general focus, and Kendall stated that the potential audience base being \"extremely limited\" frustrated the development of these journals. An 1875 stamp duty caused, in Kendall's eyes, \"more marginal\" ones to vanish.\nAfter the fall of the Ottoman Empire Constantinople, now Istanbul, remained the centre of Turkish journalism.\nTurkish\nVekayi-i giridiyye, a newspaper published in Ortoman Egypt after 1830, was the first newspaper in the Turkish language in the empire. It also had a bilingual Turkish-Greek version.\nOttoman Turkish publications included:\n* Alemdar – Anti-CUP newspaper, eventually became the organ of the Friends of England Association\n* Amele Gazetesi – Organ for the Socialist Workers' Federation\n* Anadolu Ajansı – \"Anatolia Agency,\" Newspaper agency for the Turkish nationalist movement\n* Aydede – Periodical under Refik Halit Karay\n* Aydınlık – Organ of the Communist Party of Turkey\n* Basiret – Conservative anti-Western pan-Islamist newspaper\n* Cerîde-i Havâdis – which included a supplement called Ruzname Ceride-i-Havadis.

Demetrius Nicolaides also applied to make his own Karamanli publication, Asya'' (\"Asia\"), but was denied.

The publications were also active in the eastern Mediterranean Sea area.\nNon-Muslim ethnic minorities in the empire used French as a lingua franca and therefore used these publications. In addition French businesspeople and vocational workers used French-language media to get in touch with clients in the empire. French-language journalism was initially centred in Smyrna but by the 1860s it began shifting towards Constantinople. In addition, newspapers written in other western European languages had editions in French or editions with portions in French. In the history of the empire over 400 titles of periodicals were partially or entirely in the French language, with about 66% fully in French and the rest with other languages; the total includes about 131 titles from Ottoman Egypt. Takvim-i Vekayi had versions in French.\nNon-Muslim ethnic minorities in the empire used French as a lingua franca and therefore used these publications. In addition French businesspeople and vocational workers used French-language media to get in touch with clients in the empire.\nLorans Tanatar Baruh of SALT and Sara Yontan Musnik of the National Library of France stated that the post-1918 Ottoman government favored the French-language media.
