Having just married Finnish princess, Signe in Finland he was slain by king of the Danes, Gram who crashed the wedding. His murder compelled his retainers to join forces with Gram's enemy, Swipdag, who eventually killed him in battle. Later, Swipdag's grandson was named Henry probably after Henry, poetically this Henry was killed by a son of Gram and Signe, Hading.\nText\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Gesta Danorum, Book One\n|-\n|''But, while much busied with a war against Norway, which he had taken up against King Swipdag for debauching his sister and his daughter, he heard from a messenger that Signe had, by Sumble's treachery, been promised in marriage to Henry, King of Saxony.\n|-\n|And as he spoke he leapt up from where he lay, and there he cut Henry down while at the sacred board and the embraces of his friends, carried off his bride from amongst the bridesmaids, felled most of the guests, and bore her off with him in his ship. Thus the bridal was turned into a funeral; and the Finns might learn the lesson, that hands should not be laid upon the loves of other men.\n|-\n|After this SWIPDAG, King of Norway, destroyed Gram, who was attempting to avenge the outrage on his sister and the attempt on his daughter's chastity. This battle was notable for the presence of the Saxon forces, who were incited to help Swipdag, not so much by love of him, as by desire to avenge Henry.''\n|}\nReferences"
