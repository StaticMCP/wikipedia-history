Blake High School is a public magnet high school, with an emphasis on the arts, in Tampa, Florida, United States. It is operated by the School District of Hillsborough County. Originally opened in 1956 as a school for African-Americans, it was integrated as a junior high school after the end of segregation. The current building opened in 1997, when Blake again became a high school.\nHistory\nDon Thompson Vocational High School opened as a segregated school for African-Americans in 1956. It was soon renamed Howard W. Blake Comprehensive High School in honor of Howard Wesley Blake, an African-American educator and educational activist from Tampa.\nThe original Blake High School closed after the 1970–71 school year as Hillsborough County Public Schools desegregated. It reopened in the following year as Blake 7th Grade Center, an integrated school that only taught one grade level of students. In the early 1990s, the school housed students from 7th through 9th grade and was renamed Blake Junior High School, a middle school. This school closed in 1996, and the old building was demolished soon thereafter.\nMagnet school\nIn the fall of 1997, the Blake name was transferred to Blake High School, a new high school housed in a new building opened as a magnet school for the visual, communication and performing arts.\nThe 2007–2008 school year marked Blake's 10th anniversary as a magnet school. Part of the celebration was organized by the school's Magnet Arts Coordinator. Her event for the anniversary featured Blake alumni from the previous ten years, and included gallery pieces and performances by artists such as Ari Richter and Chicago's star of Wicked, Dan'yelle Williamson.\nThe school performed the play Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind and the choir and symphony orchestra performed the Requiem by Mozart.\nAcademic standards\nBlake Accelerated Curriculum Program is an online high school magnet program in the school district of Hillsborough County.
