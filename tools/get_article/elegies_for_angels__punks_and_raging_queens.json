The work features songs and monologues inspired by the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt and Edgar Lee Masters' Spoon River Anthology.  Each of the monologues is written from the perspective of characters who've died from AIDS and the songs represent the feelings of friends and family members dealing with the loss.\nThe piece was developed in the late 1980s and was originally titled \"The Quilt.\"  It was originally produced in 1989 by the TWEED [https://www.tweedtheater.org/new-works-festival New Works Festival] at the Ohio Theatre in Soho in NYC, where the new title was adopted.  It was subsequently produced off-off Broadway in 1990 by TWEED's artistic director Kevin Malony and Justin Ross at RAPP Arts Center in Manhattan's East Village.
