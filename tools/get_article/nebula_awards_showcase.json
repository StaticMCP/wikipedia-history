      "text": "# Nebula Awards Showcase\n\nNebula Award Showcase is a series of annual science fiction and fantasy anthologies collecting stories that have won or been nominated for the Nebula Award, awarded by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA), a nonprofit association of professional science fiction and fantasy writers founded in 1965 by Damon Knight as the Science Fiction Writers of America.\nTitle and numbering variations\nThe series has changed title a number of times over the years, with volumes 1-11 and 16-17 called Nebula Award Stories, v. 12-15 Nebula Winners, v. 18-33 Nebula Awards (v. 18-19 with the initial article The), and v. 34 onward Nebula Awards Showcase (v. 45 with the initial article The). Individual volumes are usually distinguished from each other by a volume number or year designation; both have sometimes been used for variant editions of the same volume. In general, numerical designations predominated for the first thirty-three volumes, year designations for the thirty-fourth through fifty-third volumes, and numerical designations again since.\nTiming\nMost volumes follow the pattern of being published the year following the award period (ie. Nebula Awards Showcase 2008 (#42) covers the 2007 Nebula Awards and was published in 2008). There have, however, been exceptions.\n1980 saw publication of both Nebula Winners Thirteen in February and Nebula Winners Fourteen in August, and in 1983 there was another case of double publishing, with Nebula Award Stories Seventeen in August and The Nebula Awards #18 in October.\nThere was also occasional delays in publication; sixteen months elapsed between the issuing of Nebula Awards 21 (1986) and Nebula Awards 22 (1988) (both edited by George Zebrowski), and there was a three year delay between Nebula Awards Showcase 55 (2021) and Nebula Awards Showcase 56 (2024), followed by the catch-up publication of no less than four volumes in 2025; Nebula Awards Showcase 57, Nebula Awards Showcase 58, Nebula Awards Showcase 59, and Nebula Awards Showcase 60.\nEditors and publishers\nThe series has frequently changed editors and publishers.\nAside from 1985–1997, when each editor edited three volumes in a row, and 2025, when four volumes were edited by one editor, the customary practice has been for every volume to have a different editor, or occasionally a pair of editors. The editors to date (each of one volume, unless otherwise indicated) have been Brian W. Aldiss (co-editor), Kevin J. Anderson, Poul Anderson, Catherine Asaro, Isaac Asimov, Greg Bear, Gregory Benford, Lloyd Biggle, Jr., Michael Bishop (3 volumes), James Blish, Ben Bova, John F. Carr (co-editor), Julie E. Czerneda, Jack Dann (2 volumes), Ellen Datlow, Samuel R. Delany, Gordon R. Dickson, Gardner Dozois, Bill Fawcett, James E. Gunn, Joe Haldeman, Harry Harrison (co-editor), Frank Herbert, Kij Johnson, James Patrick Kelly (co-editor), John Kessel (co-editor), Damon Knight, Stephen Kotowych (4 volumes), Nancy Kress, Mercedes Lackey, Ursula K. Le Guin, Vonda N. McIntyre, Silvia Moreno-Garcia, James Morrow (3 volumes), Frederik Pohl, Jerry Pournelle (co-editor), Marta Randall, Mike Resnick, Kim Stanley Robinson, Pamela Sargent (3 volumes), Nibedita Sen, Robert Silverberg (2 volumes), Clifford D. Simak, Catherynne M. Valente, Kate Wilhelm, Connie Willis, Jane Yolen, George Zebrowski (3 volumes), and Roger Zelazny. Starting with v. 56 (2024), the SFWA announced it and future volumes were being edited by its own Publications Committee. However, in the event only that volume was issued as edited by SFWA, Inc.; the next four volumes being edited by Stephen Kotowych.\nThe publishers for the first American editions (usually, though not always, the first editions worldwide) have been Doubleday (v. 1-6), Harper & Row (v. 7-15), Holt, Rinehart and Winston (v. 16-17), Arbor House (v. 18-19), Harcourt Brace Jovanovich (v. 20-26), Harcourt Brace (v. 27-33), Harcourt (2000–2001), Roc/New American Library (2002–2010), Tor Books (2011), Pyr (2012–2018), Parvus Press (2019), and SFWA, Inc. (v. 54-60).\nContent\nThe contents of each volume are variable, but usually include an editorial introduction and the stories that won the Nebula Awards for Best Novella, Best Novelette and Best Short Story for the year covered and a selection of stories that were nominated but did not win. Also often included are excerpts from the books that won the Nebula Award for Best Novel and Andre Norton Award, the poems that won the Rhysling Award and Dwarf Stars Award for the year covered (dated for the year published rather than the year awarded, unlike the Nebulas), tributes to prominent recently deceased authors and authors voted Grand Master and Author Emeritus (together with representative pieces by them), surveys of the literature and films of the year covered, and lists of Nebula winners and nominees from previous years.\nThe series\nPublication date and volume editor follow each title.\n# Nebula Award Stories 1965 (1966) (Damon Knight)\n# Nebula Award Stories Two (1967) (Brian W.
