Abuses may be of verbal or physical nature. According to the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, antisemitism is no \"elementary component of left-wing extremism\", however is still occurring. Since the Halle synagogue shooting in 2019 and the COVID-19 pandemic, Antisemitism has increasingly entered public discussion. The October 7 attacks committed by Hamas and the resulting Gaza war have caused increased tensions between Muslims and Jews in Germany and a spike in antisemitic hate crimes or assaults. The election of the far-right AfD into the Bundestag in 2017 has stirred controversy due to some of the party's leaders expressing their wish to \"move on\" from Germany's Culture of Remembrance (Erinnerungskultur).\nContext\nIn 1998, Ignatz Bubis, a leader of the German Jewish community, pointed to a \"spreading intellectual nationalism\" that made him fear a revival of German antisemitism. Others point to Germany's growing Muslim population, both the Turkish \"guest workers\" who began to arrive in the 1950s, and the large wave of migrants from Muslim countries who arrived during the European migrant crisis that began in 2015. In 2002, the historian Julius Schoeps said that \"resolutions by the German parliament to reject antisemitism are drivel of the worst kind\" and \"all those ineffective actions are presented to the world as a strong defense against the charge of antisemitism. The truth is: no one is really interested in these matters. No one really cares.\"\nExtent\n. Characterization of Israeli policies as apartheid is denounced as antisemitic in Germany.]]\nA 2012 poll showed that 18% of the Turks in Germany think of Jews as inferior human beings. A similar study found that most of Germany's native born Muslim youth and children of immigrants have antisemitic views.\nIn 2014, antisemitic activities in Germany prompted the German Chancellor Angela Merkel to lead a rally in Berlin against antisemitism in Germany. In that same year, about 3,500 people rallied in front of the Frankfurt City Hall to protest against a wave of antisemitic incidents in Germany.  A few hundred of the protesters were from the Kurdish-Israeli Friendship Association.  According to the JTA, \"Merkel expressed her support for the event in a letter.\"\nThe number of crimes against Jews and Jewish institutions continued to increase in 2018. In a 2018 survey conducted by the European Union, 85% of Jewish respondents in Germany said that antisemitism was a \"very big\" or \"fairly big\" issue, and 89% said that antisemitism had become a worse problem in the last five years. In February 2019, crime data released by the government for 2018 and published in Der Tagesspiegel showed a yearly increase of 10%, with 1,646 crimes linked to a hatred of Jews in 2018, with the totals not finalised as yet. There was a 60% rise in physical attacks (62 violent incidents, vs 37 in 2017). Germany also reported a new record of cases linked to hatred of Jews in 2020, with 2,275 crimes with an antisemitic background until the end of January 2021.\n|width=368\n|caption=Perpetrators of antisemitistic verbal harassment and physical assault. Characterisation of antisemitic attackers as reported by Jewish victims. An attacker may belong to more than 1 group.\n}}\nA June 2024 survey  found that antisemitism in Germany was very high, citing an enormity of \"extreme violence\", with as much as an 83% spike in antisemitic incidents when compared to the preceding year. In 2023 alone, 5,164 antisemitic offenses were recorded by the Federal Police. Furthermore, according to Germany's Federal Association of Departments for Research and Information on Antisemitism (RIAS) reporting and support network, since 7 October 2023, there has been an average of 32 antisemitic incidents per day in Germany, up from an average of seven in 2022. According to a separate report by RIAS, 1,383 antisemitic incidents were recorded in Berlin alone during the first half of 2024. This amounts to an average of seven to eight incidents per day. It is the highest number of reported antisemitic incidents in Berlin in a single year since documentation began.\nIn November 2024, Berlin's police chief, Barbara Slowik, warned Jewish and LGBT residents of the city to be more careful in Arab-majority neighborhoods of the city where locals often have sympathy for terrorist groups. In these neighborhoods, there has been an increase in antisemitic and racist incidents, which is why she advises, \"who wear a kippah or are openly homosexual or lesbians to be more attentive\".\nAccording to a report by the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), Germany recorded 1,047 antisemitic crimes, including two attempted murders, in the first three months of 2025.\nCharacteristics of antisemites in Germany\nAs per German police statistics, over 90 percent of antisemitic incidents are committed by \"followers of the farright\". However, government officials and Jewish community leaders doubt the figure, because cases with unknown perpetrators and some kinds of attacks get automatically classified as \"farright\".\nA 2017 study on Jewish perspectives on antisemitism in Germany by Bielefeld University found that individuals and groups belonging to the extreme right and extreme left were equally identified as perpetrators of antisemitic harassment and assault by survey participants, while the largest part of the attacks were committed by Muslim assailants. The study also found that 70% of the participants feared a rise in antisemitism due to immigration, citing the antisemitic views of some of the refugees. A study among Jews, published by the European Union in 2018, has also listed Muslims as the biggest perpetrators of antisemitic incidents in Germany. 41% of such attacks were committed by extremist Muslims, 20% by far-right and 16% by far-left extremists. In its 2017 summary, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) concluded that antisemitic rhetoric spread by Islamist organizations posed a significant challenge to the contemporary peaceful and tolerant society of Germany.\nIncidents\nIn January 2017, a German court in Wuppertal upheld the 2015 decision of a lower court which deemed an attempt by three Muslim attackers to burn down a synagogue in 2014 on the anniversary of the Kristallnacht \"a means of drawing attention to the Gaza conflict with Israel\". The offenders were not sent to prison. The German regional court ruled that the actions of the three perpetrators were \"governed by anti-Israelism and not antisemitism\". The attackers subsequently received suspended sentences. Green Party MP Volker Beck protested the ruling, saying: \"This is a decision as far as the motives of the perpetrators are concerned. What do Jews in Germany have to do with the Middle East conflict? Every bit as much as Christians, non-religious people or Muslims in Germany, namely, absolutely nothing. The ignorance of the judiciary toward antisemitism is for many Jews in Germany especially alarming.\"\nDr. Moshe Kantor, president of the European Jewish Congress, said:\nIn 2018, an Arab Israeli who wore a kippah was assaulted. The incident was recorded and the video went viral.\nIn 2018, the Echo Music Prize was awarded to rappers who featured antisemitic clichés in their lyrics. As a result of protests from artists and the press, the award was discontinued.\nOn 9 October 2019, a lone gunman attacked a synagogue in Halle during the Yom Kippur, while two doors of the synagogue were damaged when improvised explosives set off. The attacker shot dead a man and a woman near a Turkish kebab shop.\nIn September 2021, German police averted a possible Islamic attack on a synagogue in Hagen during Yom Kippur services, arresting four people including a 16-year-old Syrian youth.\nDuring an April 2023 pro-Palestine protest, observers recorded numerous antisemitic chants, including \"Death to the Jews\". The Berlin Police have confirmed they are investigating charges of Volksverhetzung; two pro-Palestine rallies planned for the following weekend were cancelled.\nOn 18 October 2023, 11 days after the Hamas-led October 7 massacres that killed over 1,200, a Berlin synagogue was firebombed with molotovs following the Gaza war by two masked men. Since the escalation of the Gaza war in October 2023, there has been a surge in antisemitic incidents on a scale unseen in years.\nOn 2 February 2024, a pro-Palestinian college student in Berlin assaulted a Jewish classmate to the point of hospitalization following an altercation over the Israel-Hamas war. According to the German police, the Jewish student was punched repeatedly in the face until he fell to the ground after which was he was kicked while lying on the floor. The attackers subsequently fled the scene. The victim suffered facial fractures, while the attacker was located and arrested. The victim is reportedly a grandson of Amitzur Shapira, an Israeli athletics coach murdered by the Black September terrorists in the 1972 Munich massacre.\nOn 5 April 2024, an unknown individual threw an incendiary device at the door of a synagogue in the northern city of Oldenburg, causing a small blaze and minor damage. German police have offered a cash reward for information about the arson attack.\nAccording to a Jewish Independent article on 21 May 2024, Jewish parents living in Berlin's suburbs started enrolling their kids at Jewish schools in Mitte, Berlin due to fears of rising antisemitism. The children of the parents concerned are enrolled at the schools closest to where they live, but they passed up the automatic registration for their children's local high school in favour of sending them to a school far from their place of residence for the alleged reason that it was protected by an Israeli guard, German policemen and an enclosed wall, while there are usually no guards at Berlin schools.\nIn late June 2024, an Israeli couple in their early 20s was assaulted in Berlin's Potsdamer Platz after being heard speaking Hebrew by an Arabic speaking assailant. The assailant shouted abuses at them, threw a bottle and a chair at the woman, followed by punches on the man who rose in her defense. The assailant fled the scene afterwards.\nOn 5 September 2024, the 52nd anniversary of the 1972 Munich massacre, a suspected terrorist opened fire at the Israeli consulate and adjacent Nazi Documentation Centre in Munich before being shot dead by police.\nIn August 2024, German Senator Joseph Chialo was attacked by pro-Palestinian protesters following his initiative to stop funding organizations working to present antisemitic content in the country. Following this attack, Dr. Felix Klein, Germany's Federal Government Commissioner for Jewish Life in Germany and the Fight against Antisemitism, expressed concern about the \"tsunami\" of hostility toward Jews since October 7, the worst it has been since 1945.\nOn 7 October 2024, 10 memorial stones engraved with details of certain Holocaust victims, were torn from their spots. The day was also the first anniversary of the Hamas-led October 7 massacre. Authorities suspected the vandalism to have been carried out by immigrants from Muslim-majority countries.\nIn September 2025, a shop owner in Flensburg posted an antisemitic sign on his door reading “Jews are forbidden entry here, Nothing personal, not even antisemitism - I just can’t stand you”. The incident drew comparisons to Nazi Germany’s antisemitic laws. The owner claimed he opposed the war in Gaza and therefore barred entry to all Jews. After public criticism the sign was removed, though local media reported it was later displayed inside the store.\nResponses\nIn October 2024, Felix Klein, Germany's Commissioner for Jewish Life and the Fight against Antisemitism, said that \"open and aggressive antisemitism\", which is a \"poison for social cohesion\", was \"stronger than at any time since 1945\". Also in October 2024, Thomas Strobl, Interior Minister of Baden-Württemberg, reassured the Jewish community that they will be protected amid rising antisemitism.\nIn September 2025, in a speech delivered at the reopening of the Synagogue on Reichenbachstraße in Munich, Chancellor Friedrich Merz was moved to tears as he emphasized that antisemitism had never disappeared from Germany and that, after the Holocaust, the Nazi period was suppressed rather than confronted with due acknowledgment of guilt. He pledged to combat all forms of antisemitism and, with reference to migration, declared: \"Since October 7, it has become undeniable: in politics and society we have closed our eyes for far too long to the fact that among those who have come to Germany in recent decades, a part were socialized in countries where antisemitism is virtually a state doctrine and where hatred of Israel is taught to children already in school. Since then, we have been experiencing a new wave of antisemitism - both in its old and in new forms. That is why I promise: this Federal Government and I declare war on every form of antisemitism in Germany\".\nSee also\n* Secondary antisemitism\n* Antisemitism in Europe\n* Anti-antisemitism in Germany\n* Timeline of antisemitism in the 21st century\n* Antisemitism in 21st-century France\n* Antisemitism in 21st-century Italy\n* Antisemitism in contemporary Austria\n* Antisemitism in contemporary Belgium\n* Antisemitism in contemporary Hungary\n* Geography of antisemitism\n* Germany–Israel relations\nReferences"
