The book was first published in 1901 by Ulrico Hoepli in Milan.\nThe book, with 3 maps and about 500 pages, was intended to be easy to read and appealing to the general reader of Italian. Hoepli published the second, third, and fourth editions in 1905, 1920 and 1928. In the book, Villari's main focus is on the Teutonic invasions of the 3rd through 6th centuries A.D.\nIn 1902 Fisher Unvwin published a 2-volume translation (The Barbarian Invasions of Italy) by Linda Villari, the wife of Pasquale Villari.\n}}\n}}\nReferences"
