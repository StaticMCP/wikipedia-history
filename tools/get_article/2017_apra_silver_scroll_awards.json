This was the first time the awards had been hosted in Dunedin.\nDunedin-born musician and long-listed songwriter Shayne Carter was the musical director for the event. His duties included arranging the five shortlisted songs to be covered by different musicians in a new style.\nSilver Scroll award\nThe Silver Scroll award celebrates outstanding achievement in songwriting of original New Zealand pop music. The short list of finalists was announced on 24 August.\nThe 2017 shortlist is notable for all five songs having been performed and written by female artists, though four male cowriters are among the nominees. The nominees include two previous Silver Scroll winners: Bic Runga who won in 1996 for \"Drive\", and Ella Yelich-O'Connor and co-writer Joel Little who won in 2013 for \"Royals\".\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=\"34%\" | Songwriter(s)\n!
