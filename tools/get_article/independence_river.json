Situated north of the Moose River and south of the Beaver River, it begins in Herkimer County and flows west into Lewis County, toward its confluence with the Black River in Watson, north of Lyons Falls and just south of Lowville.\nThe Independence was named by surveyor/engineer Pierre Pharoux in 1794, in honor of the national holiday.\nWhitewater Paddling\nThe Independence is considered an excellent run by whitewater kayakers and canoeists, with a long Class-V rapid called the \"Fat Lady\" near its end. In contrast to the nearby Beaver and Moose, the Independence has no dams; thus, its suitability for paddling is entirely dependent on rain.\nSee also\n*List of New York rivers\nReferences"
