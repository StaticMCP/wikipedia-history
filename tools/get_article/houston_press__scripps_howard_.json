Under the leadership of founding editor Paul C. Edwards (1911–16), Marcellus E. Foster, known as \"Mefo\" (1927–37), and George Carmack (1946–64), the newspaper developed a reputation for flashy stories about violence and sex and for exposés of political malfeasance. It ceased publication in 1964.\nHistory\nThe Houston Press was first issued September 25, 1911, from a plant at 709 Louisiana Street, for 1 cent a copy. For the first 58 days, the Press had no advertising; its management asserted that its circulation had yet to warrant investment of any advertiser's money.\nNotable former staff members included Walter Cronkite, who later became the CBS news anchor; Thomas Thompson, author of Hearts and Blood and Money; Donald Forst, later editor of Newsday and The Village Voice; Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and biographer Vance Trimble; columnists Sig Byrd (\"The Stroller\") and Carl Victor Little (1894–1959) (\"By The Way\"); gossip columnist Maxine Mesinger; and television crusader Marvin Zindler, who once worked there as a photographer covering crime stories. Joseph Agris, who became Zindler's biographer, called the Houston Press \"a paper that, by journalistic standards, had no standards at all\" and Clyde Waddell who was a chief photographer in 1943.\nClosure of the Press in 1964\nIn 1963, the year before it closed, the Press had an average daily circulation (Monday–Saturday) of 90,400, and employed 320 people. On March 20, 1964, editor Carmack and business manager Ray L. Powers announced that the newspaper, plant, and facilities had been sold to the larger of its two rivals, the Houston Chronicle, for $4.5&nbsp;million (equivalent to $&nbsp;million in ). The Press had never missed a publication since it was founded. Following the closure of the Press, two Houston daily newspapers remained, the morning Houston Post and the evening Houston Chronicle (1964 average daily circulation of 226,600). Houston, before the closing of the Press, had been the only city west of the Mississippi River with more than two daily newspapers.\nHouston Press selected personnel\nEditors\nIn its 52-year history The Press had six editors:\n*  and, in 1943, was appointed to Stanford's Board of Trustees, serving as President of the Board from 1948 to 1953. Edwards was editor of the San Francisco News from 1932 until his death. }}\n*  Gold Viron Gribble Sanders; aka Gold Vernon Sanders; 1891–1975) never used his first name, \"Gold,\" until later in life. }}\n*  }}\n*\n*\n*  }}\nManaging editors\n*  }}\n*  William Dudley Davis; 1901–1931) died July 10, 1931, of injuries after his automobile struck a bus. }}\n*\n*\nJournalists\n*  Luther Sigman Byrd; 1909–1987), born in Blanket, Texas, wrote a popular daily column for the Press, \"The Stroller\", which led to a book, ''Sig Byrd's Houston'' (1955; Viking Press). His beat covered venues and neighborhoods that included Congress Avenue, the Segundo Barrio, Catfish Reef (the 400 block of lower Milam Street), the Bayou of the Buffalo Fish, Pearl Harbor (the corner of Hill and Lyons), The Big Casino (not Houston's oldest saloon at 908 Congress Avenue  \"But  the new Big Casino, on Preston Avenue.\" ), and Vinegar Hill (red-light district, between Prairie and Congress Avenue). In 1951, he left the Press for the Houston Chronicle. In Laura Flanders review of Bill Minutaglio and W. Michael Smith's book, Molly Ivins: A Rebel Life (2009), she cited the authors' admiration of Byrd, \"Over at the Houston Press, gumshoe reporter Sigman Byrd was 'out-Breslin[ing] Jimmy Breslin [of the New York ] in terms of celebrating working-class heroes.\" John Nova Lomax, writer for the current Houston Press, called Byrd, \"Houson's King of True-Life Noir\" (metaphor, simile and narrative). Byrd's grandson, Sigman Mercer Byrd, Jr. (born 1964), is a writer. }}\n*  and later, a reporter for Scripps-Howard bureau covering events at the Texas State Capitol.  He left in 1936 to join KCMO in Kansas City. }}\n*\n*  }}\n* ; 1907–1993), born in Mineral Wells, began her newspaper career sometime before 1932 as a reporter for the Press. She married George Burnett Carmack October 24, 1943, at Fort Riley, Kansas, while George was serving in the Army as a Captain. }}\nArtists, illustrators, cartoonists\n*  }}\n*  Edward Livingston Franklin; 1921–2006), a self-taught artist, born in Chireno, Texas, after World War II, by the late 1940s, joined the art department of the Press. He did illustration work, and a few cartoons. During the mid-1950s, The Saturday Evening Post, Argosy, and True published his work. }}\nBusiness managers\n*  was, on the inaugural masthead of September 25, 1911, identified as Business Manager. By 1918, he was with the Cincinnati Post. For Scripps-Howard, from about 1922, he became the Business Manager for the Warren Tribune Chronicle and had also been associated with newspapers in Toledo, Cleveland, and Denver (1914). }}\n*  Anyse Sue White) are the namesakes of the Frank W. and Sue Mayborn School of Journalism at the University of North Texas. }}\n*  In 1936, he was promoted to Advertising Director, and, in 1939, to Business Manager. Born in Barrington, Illinois, he had, in 1919, as a freshman, attended the University of Minnesota. In 1922, he earned a B.S. degree in General Business from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. }}\nHouston Press buildings\nBeginning May 1913, the Press moved from 709 Louisiana Street to a new building at Capitol Avenue and Bagby Street. In 1928, the Houston Press erected a $500,000 (estimated equivalent of $}} in ) two-story,  building (which formally opened February 14, 1928) at the corner of Rusk and Chartres Streets (2001 Rusk Street). It was designed in an Italianate-style by Howell & Thomas, a Cleveland firm.\n* [https://planning.clevelandohio.gov/landmark/arch/thickDetail.php?pageNum_Recordset1=1&totalRows_Recordset1=2&buildID=8190&keepThis=true&TB_iframe=true&height=630&width=700 2 photos]\nSelected articles\n*  |last1=Byrd |first1=Sigman |author-link1= |date=October 1, 1947 |title=Those Flowering Shrubs Do Her Inspire – So of Making Rhymes She Doesn't Tire |url=https://archive.org/details/19501030ByrdSigASonOfIsraelPutsMazlOnTheTrailOfABluebird.HoustonPressHoustonOctober301950Page15/1947-10-01%20-%20Byrd%2C%20Sig%20%22Those%20Flowering%20Shrubs%20Do%20Her%20Inspire%20--%20So%20of%20Making%20Rythmes%20She%20Doesn%27t%20Tire%22%20%20-%20Strolling%20In%20Houston%20-%20Houston%20Press%2C%20%5BHouston%5D%201%2C%20October%201947%2C%20Pages%201%20%26%206 |work=Houston Press |language=en-US |access-date=May 14, 2021 |via=Internet Archive }}\n*  |last1=Byrd |first1=Sigman |author-link1= |date=October 2, 1947 |title=Doctor Fears for America; Her Soil Is Fed by the Wrong Type of 'Monopolistic' Fertilizer |url=https://archive.org/details/19501030ByrdSigASonOfIsraelPutsMazlOnTheTrailOfABluebird.HoustonPressHoustonOctober301950Page15/1947-10-02%20-%20Byrd%2C%20Sig%20%22Doctor%20Fears%20for%20America%3B%20Her%20Soil%20is%20Feed%20By%20the%20Wrong%20Type%20of%20%27Monopolistic%20Fertilizer%22%20Houston%20Press%2C%20%5BHouston%20Press%2C%20%5BHouston%5D%202%2C%20October%201947%2C%20Pages%201%20%26%206 |work=Houston Press |language=en-US |access-date=May 14, 2021 |via=Internet Archive }}\n*  |last1=Byrd |first1=Sigman |author-link1= |date=October 3, 1947 |title=Proud Sam Houston Walks on Soil in Full Uniform, But Busy Historians Fail to Stare |url=https://archive.org/details/19501030ByrdSigASonOfIsraelPutsMazlOnTheTrailOfABluebird.HoustonPressHoustonOctober301950Page15/1947-10-03%20-%20Byrd%2C%20Sig%20%22Proud%20Sam%20Houston%20Walks%20on%20Texas%20Soil%20in%20Full%20Uniform%20but%20Busy%20Houstonians%20Fail%20to%20Stare%22%20Houston%20Press%2C%20%5BHouston%5D%203%2C%20October%201947%2C%20Pages%201%20%26%208 |work=Houston Press |language=en-US |access-date=May 14, 2021 |via=Internet Archive }}\n*  |last1=Byrd |first1=Sigman |author-link1= |date=October 4, 1947 |title=Jim Dudley Lifts Bray's Bayou Drawbridge, Hopes Young 'Gad-About' Never Gets His Job |url=https://archive.org/details/19501030ByrdSigASonOfIsraelPutsMazlOnTheTrailOfABluebird.HoustonPressHoustonOctober301950Page15/1947-10-04%20-%20Byrd%2C%20Sig%20%22Jim%20Dudley%20Lifts%20Braes%20Bayou%20Drawbridge%2C%20Hopes%20Young%20Gad-About%20Never%20Gets%20His%20Job%22%20Houston%20Press%2C%20%5BHouston%5D%204%2C%20October%201947%2C%20Pages%201%20%26%203 |work=Houston Press |language=en-US |access-date=May 14, 2021 |via=Internet Archive }}\n*  |last1=Byrd |first1=Sigman |author-link1= |date=October 6, 1947 |title='Take a Card,' Phones Mysterious Howard; 'It's the Nine of Diamonds – Right?'
