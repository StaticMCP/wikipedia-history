Carlos Zelaya from Dead Press! rated the album positively calling it: \"With New Empire, Vol. 2, Hollywood Undead won't exactly convert a new audience, but they will satisfy their existing fanbase. Continuing to grow their sound and embrace the hip-hop styles that they've invariably influenced, Hollywood Undead close out the year with an ambitious and revitalised approach to their sound.\" Distorted Sound scored the album 5 out of 10 and said: \"It was honestly surprising to hear a mostly lifeless album emerge from a group as full of piss and vinegar as HOLLYWOOD UNDEAD is. Credit is due to the band for attempting to get involved with the times and recognising what is popular now, but the execution leaves much to be desired. It's time to regroup and re-plan the strategy for the next record. They're sniffing out the right track, but they have some thinking to do when the artists they want to join go much harder lyrically and musically than they do.\"\nWriting for Kerrang!, Jake Richardson gave the album an overall positive review, saying: \"If you've never liked this band, then there's little here that's likely to convert you, but for those already on board, New Empire, Vol. 2 is a more than satisfying confirmation that, a decade-and-a-half after they started, Hollywood Undead still have something to offer.\" James Holder of Rock Sins rated the album 7 out of 10 and said: \"New Empire, Vol. 2 is Hollywood Undead just as they've always been, and that's just the way they like it.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from AllMusic.\nHollywood Undead\n* Jorel \"J-Dog\" Decker – vocals, guitars, bass, keyboards, programming, composition\n* Dylan \"Funny Man\" Alvarez – vocals, composition\n* George \"Johnny 3 Tears\" Ragan – vocals, bass, composition\n* Jordon \"Charlie Scene\" Terrell – vocals, guitars, composition, production\n* Daniel \"Danny\" Murillo – vocals, keyboards, programming, guitars, bass, composition\nAdditional musicians\n* Hyro the Hero – guest vocals on track 2, composition\n* Killstation – guest vocals on track 5\n* Tech N9ne – guest vocals on track 6, composition\n* Jacoby Shaddix of Papa Roach – guest vocals on track 10\n* Spencer Charnas of Ice Nine Kills – guest vocals on track 10\n* Ghøstkid – guest vocals on track 11\n* Kurt92 – guest vocals on track 12\n* Luke Holland – drums\nAdditional personnel\n* Matt Good – production, engineering, mastering, mixing, composition\n* Ted Jensen – engineering\n* Ian Dietrich, Chris Nilsson and Andrew Purcell – management\n* Darren Craig – art direction\n* Randall Leddy – layout\nReferences"
