There is insufficient material available for further verification and study.\nBuretsu was a son of Emperor Ninken and his mother is . His name was . He had no children.\nBuretsu's reign\n]]\nBuretsu's contemporary title would not have been tennō, as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō. Rather, it was presumably , meaning \"the great king who rules all under heaven\". Alternatively, Buretsu might have been referred to as  or the \"Great King of Yamato\".\nBuretsu is described as an extremely wicked historical figure. The Nihonshoki describes the 11-year-old Buretsu, in 500, cutting open the stomach of a pregnant woman and observing the embryo. In addition to his acts of personal cruelty, during his reign the general welfare of the nation declined severely. According to the Tenshō, supposedly compiled by Fujiwara no Hamanari, Buretsu was admonished by Ōtomo no Kanamura. Nihonshoki likened his debauchery to Di Xin of the Shang dynasty, but the record in Kojiki has no such indication. There are several theories on this difference. Some believe that this was to justify and praise his successor Emperor Keitai, who took over under questionable circumstances, not having been in a position of immediate succession. In history textbooks available before and during World War II, the negative parts of Buretsu's record were intentionally omitted.\nIf Emperor Keitai began a new dynasty as some historians believe, then Buretsu is the last Emperor of the first recorded dynasty of Japan.\nThe actual site of Buretsu's grave is not known. The Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (misasagi) at Nara.\nThe Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Buretsu's mausoleum. It is formally named Kataoka no Iwatsuki no oka no kita no misasagi.\nConsorts and children\n*Empress:\n**Children: None\nSee also\n* Emperor of Japan\n* List of Emperors of Japan\n* Imperial cult\n* Prince Junda, dispatched to Japan after a Korean emissary was taken hostage at Buretsu's initiative\nNotes\nReferences\n* Aston, William George.
