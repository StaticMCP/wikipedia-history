It has been described as the only monument in the history of warfare to have been erected by a victorious army for its adversaries, as the British were reportedly impressed with the valour of the Gorkhas. The structure falls under the aegis of the Archaeological Survey of India. Every year, a fair is held at the site to commemorate the soldiers and to celebrate Gorkha culture and history. The Gorkha rule in Uttarakhand, also known as \"Gorkhyani\" or the \"Khukri Raj,\" occurred from roughly 1790 to 1815.\nReferences"
