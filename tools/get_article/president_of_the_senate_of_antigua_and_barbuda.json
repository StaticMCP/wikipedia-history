Prior to conducting any other business, the Senate must elect a senator to serve as president when it convenes following a general election.\nIf the position of president becomes vacant at any point before the next dissolution of Parliament, the Senate must elect a new senator to serve in that capacity as soon as is practically possible. Prior to conducting any other business besides electing the President at the Senate's first session following a general election, the Senate shall elect a senator to serve as Vice-President. If the position of Vice-President becomes vacant at any point before the next dissolution of Parliament, the Senate shall, as soon as is practically possible, elect another senator to fill the position. A senator cannot be elected by the Senate to be President or Vice-President if they are also serving as a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary. When the Presidency is vacant, the Senate is not allowed to conduct any activity (except from the election of a President).\nIf the business before the Senate in that meeting makes the Attorney-General's presence desirable, the President, Vice-President, or other member presiding in the Senate may request that the Attorney-General attend that meeting. When such a request is made, the Attorney-General may participate in the meeting solely for the purpose of explaining the matters before the Senate in that meeting.\nList of presidents\nThis is an incomplete list of the presidents of the Senate of Antigua and Barbuda:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Entered office\n!Left office\n|-\n|Hon.
