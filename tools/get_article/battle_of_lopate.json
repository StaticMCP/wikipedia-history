In early October 1796, when the Battle of Krusi occurred, a unit was organized, consisting of the soldiers from the mentioned towns. This unit attacked the mountains of Morača (Mount Lopatice, near Lopate) against the tribespeople of Trebjesa, Morača and Rovci. The unit suffered noticeable casualties. According to available sources, both sides lost about forty people.\nSee also\n*Battle of Martinići\n*Battle of Krusi\nReferences"
