He played college football for the Miami Hurricanes  before transferring to the Rutgers Scarlet Knights and signing with the Baltimore Ravens as an undrafted free agent in 2018. Edwards's nickname is \"Gus the Bus\"; being known for his large size and \"physical\" run style.\nEarly life\nEdwards was born in Liberia during the First Liberian Civil War, which tore the country apart and killed many civilians. Gus moved to the United States at the age of five along with his family. He attended and played high school football at Tottenville High School.\nEdwards was named as a three-star recruit by ESPN, 247Sports.com, Rivals.com, and Scout.com. After initially verbally committing to Syracuse, a coaching change caused him to rescind his commitment and reopen his recruitment. He eventually committed to Miami to play college football.\nCollege career\nEdwards played college football at the University of Miami from 2013–2016 and for the Rutgers Scarlet Knights in 2017 as a graduate transfer.\nCollege statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align: center; font-weight:bold;\" | Gus Edwards\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align: center; font-weight:bold;\" | Rushing\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align: center; font-weight:bold;\" | Receiving\n|-\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Year\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | School\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Conf\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Class\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Pos\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | G\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Att\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Yds\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Avg\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | TD\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Rec\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Yds\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Avg\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | TD\n|-\n| 2013\n| Miami (FL)\n| ACC\n| FR\n| RB\n| 9\n| 66\n| 338\n| 5.1\n| 5\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n|-\n| 2014\n| Miami (FL)\n| ACC\n| SO\n| RB\n| 10\n| 61\n| 349\n| 5.7\n| 6\n| 2\n| 44\n| 22.0\n| 0\n|-\n| 2015\n| Miami (FL)\n| ACC\n| JR\n| RB\n| colspan=\"12\"| Did not play due to injury\n|-\n| 2016\n| Miami (FL)\n| ACC\n| SR\n| RB\n| 10\n| 59\n| 290\n| 4.9\n| 1\n| 1\n| 9\n| 9.0\n| 0\n|-\n| 2017\n| Rutgers\n| Big Ten\n| SR\n| RB\n| 12\n| 164\n| 713\n| 4.3\n| 6\n| 13\n| 103\n| 7.9\n| 1\n|-\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | [https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/gus-edwards-1.html Career]\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Overall\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\" |\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | 350\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | 1,690\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | 4.8\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | 18\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | 16\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | 156\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | 9.8\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | 1\n|}\nProfessional career\n}}\nBaltimore Ravens\n2018\nEdwards signed with the Baltimore Ravens as an undrafted free agent on 4 May 2018.
