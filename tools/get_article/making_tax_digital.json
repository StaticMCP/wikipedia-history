      "text": "# Making Tax Digital\n\nMaking Tax Digital (MTD) is a UK government initiative that sets out a vision for the 'end of the tax return' and a 'transformed tax system', announced in 2015 and originally intended to be in place by 2020. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) states that the main goal of MTD is to make tax administration more effective, more efficient and simpler for taxpayers.\nThe changes are expected apply to a wide range of taxpayers, including most businesses, micro-businesses, self-employed people and landlords, as well as individual taxpayers. The first mandatory use of digital methods was for Value Added Tax, beginning in April 2019 for many businesses and organisations. Making Tax Digital for Income Tax Self-Assessment (MTD for ITSA) has been delayed until 2026.\nDescription\nBusinesses and individuals (or their agents) will be required to keep digital records of transactions, and send quarterly updates to HMRC. For income tax, the quarterly updates will provide the totals of income and expenses, and an end-of-period statement must be submitted for each tax year. This statement must be submitted by the 31 January following the end of the tax year, and may include accounting adjustments and claims for reliefs or allowances.\nUnder MTD, taxpayers will send HMRC summaries of their income and expenditure at least four times a year. HMRC says this will enable a more ongoing and accurate projection of tax due, as opposed to the current system of one tax bill at the end of the year. To do this, taxpayers will need to integrate their accounts with software in some way. HMRC's 2017 consultation response stated that spreadsheets can be used if they can meet with HMRC's technical requirements, although many taxpayers will use more comprehensive accounting software instead.\nTimescale for implementation\nA government paper in March 2017 stated that Value Added Tax (VAT) would become the first tax to move to the digital system in April 2019, but would only be mandatory for businesses and landlords with turnover above the VAT threshold (at that time £85,000). The government had stated in 2015 that 99% of VAT returns were already being made online. MTD was removed from the 2017 Finance Bill ahead of the June general election, leading to speculation that the programme had been dropped. In July the government confirmed the 2019 timetable, and stated that it would be at least two further years before digital records would begin for other taxes.\n, the past and future deadlines for the start of mandatory digital filing are as follows.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Tax\n!Start of mandatory MTD\n|-\n|VAT\n|\n|-\n|Income Tax and\nNational Insurance\n|\n|-\n|Corporation Tax\n|July 2025 HMRC confirmed that it will no longer proceed with plans for Making Tax Digital for Corporation Tax.\n|}\nExemptions\nFor Value Added Tax, VAT Notice 700/22 outlines that claims for exemption from MTD can be made on grounds which include:\n* Where it is not practical to use digital tools, for reasons such as age, disability or location\n* Where a business is run entirely by practising members of a religious society (or order) whose beliefs are incompatible with using electronic methods.\nThe same notice allows charities running fundraising events to bundle onto one invoice all supplies received, and the same for all supplies made. An example is given of a church fete run by volunteers.\nProprietary software\nThe software currently available and/or suggested by HMRC for MTD are proprietary and closed-source. Even current \"bridging software\" solutions are closed-source although they would allow users to continue using spreadsheets (which can be open-source like LibreOffice Calc or Google Sheets or already owned by many tax payers like Microsoft Excel) and then use these bridging software to submit the data to HMRC.\nWhile HMRC's focus is on compliance and functionality, the implications of relying almost exclusively on closed-source, commercial solutions for a mandatory public service have drawn significant criticism from various stakeholders concerned with fairness, transparency, and public value.\nTaxpayer advocacy groups (like LITRG), some digital rights advocates, and even implicitly, parliamentary bodies like the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are critics when they highlight issues of oversight and value for money in government IT projects.\nProfessional accounting bodies (e.g., ICAEW, ACCA, ATT, CIOT), small business associations, and the Public Accounts Committee have raised a number of issues.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/making-tax-digital/overview-of-making-tax-digital Overview of Making Tax Digital] – HMRC, updated December 2022\n* [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-making-tax-digital-for-income-tax Using Making Tax Digital for Income Tax] – HMRC, updated January 2023\n* [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-software-that-works-with-making-tax-digital-for-income-tax Find software that works with Making Tax Digital for Income Tax] - HMRC, updated August 2025"
