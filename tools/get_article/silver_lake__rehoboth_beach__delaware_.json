The two lakes were formed by receding glaciers, and now serves as a bird refuge.\nDescription\nBoth lakes were formed during the end of the last ice age, from runoff from the retreating Wisconsin glaciation. Silver Lake was among the lakes formed by this process.\nOf the two bodies, Silver Lake is larger. The smaller Lake Comegys was formed in the early 19th century when pollution from a local tannery sealed off a far end of Silver Lake, isolating the new body of water. Both lakes are notably close to the nearby Atlantic Ocean, and are considered to be the closest freshwater lakes to the Atlantic Ocean in the United States. The pair are also the only natural freshwater lakes in the state of Delaware. During the age of sail Silver Lake was used by passing ships to replenish their supply of fresh water.\nBoth lakes are fed by runoff and underground springs. In the 1920s the DuPont Company used dynamite to help drain sediment buildup in the lakes.\nIn 1933, the state of Delaware established both lakes as state bird refuges. Delaware passed a resolution in 2004 declaring both lakes to be natural treasures of Delaware, citing the lakes' unique proximity to the Atlantic and their status as the only natural freshwater lakes in the state. The lakes are also managed by Save Our Lakes Alliance3, a local non-profit.\nReferences"
