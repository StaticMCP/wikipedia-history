The inter-branch league operates under the supervision of Hockey New Brunswick and Hockey PEI.\nHistory\nThe league was created by Hockey New Brunswick and Hockey PEI in 2002 to provide a more competitive development league for both provinces.  The new league replaced the existing major midget leagues in both provinces.  Both branches continue to operate their respective minor midget leagues as feeder leagues for the major midget league.\nUpon its formation, it was decided that the league would have six teams &ndash; four from New Brunswick and two from PEI.  The five of the six original teams are still in the league today while the Kensington Wild joined in the 2013–2014 season.\nTeams\nCurrent\n: Charlottetown Knights\n: Fredericton Caps\n: Kensington Wild\n: Moncton Flyers\n: Northern Moose\n: Saint John Vitos\nFormer\n: Cornwall Superior Thunder\nChampionship\nThe team finishing with the best record during the regular season is named league champion.\nSeparate playoffs are held for the New Brunswick and PEI teams.  The New Brunswick teams play in a two-round playoff to compete for their provincial championship, with the two PEI teams face each other in a playoff series for their championship.  The respective provincial champions qualify for the Telus Cup Atlantic Regional Championship, where they compete for a berth in the national championship.\nChampions\n*2002-03 Fredericton\n*2003-04 Fredericton\n*2004-05 Fredericton\n*2005-06 Saint John\n*2006-07 Charlottetown\n*2007-08 Moncton\n*2008-09 Moncton\n*2009-10 Miramichi\n*2010-11 Fredericton\n*2011-12 Moncton\n*2012-13 Moncton\n*2013-14 Moncton\n*2014-15 Moncton\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.nbpeimajormidget.com League Website]"
