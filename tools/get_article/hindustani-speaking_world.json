This includes countries and territories where in its various forms (including Standard Hindi and Standard Urdu), serves as an official, administrative, cultural, or widely spoken language.\nBackground\n, one of the earliest writers in the Urdu Language.]]\nThe Hindustani language emerged as a result of the historical interactions between various linguistic and cultural groups in the Indian subcontinent. It developed during the medieval period, influenced by the languages of the Indo-Aryan family, Iranian, Arabic, and Turkic languages, particularly during the Mughal Empire. The language has two standardized forms: Hindi, which is written in the Devanagari script, and Urdu, which is written in the Perso-Arabic script. Both forms share a significant amount of vocabulary and grammar, making them mutually intelligible.\nBefore 1947, the British Raj officially recognized Hindustani (which was equated with Urdu). In the post-independence era, however, the term Hindustani has gone out of use and is accorded no official status by either the Indian or Pakistani governments. Rather, the language is officially recognized by its two main standardized registers, Hindi and Urdu.\nThis idea of the Hindustani language as \"unifying language\" or \"fusion language\" that would be \"above\" communal and religious differences throughout the subcontinent was supported by Mahatma Gandhi, since it was not perceived to be a part of the Hindu community or the Muslim community like in the case of Hindi and Urdu respectively, and was also perceived to be a simpler language for people to learn. The translation from Urdu into Hindi (or the reverse) is mostly done by simply transliterating from both scripts or translation which is typically necessary for religious and literary texts.\nStatistics\nAs of 2023, Hindi and Urdu combined are the 3rd-most-spoken language in the world after English and Mandarin with 843 million native and second-language speakers, as per Ethnologue. The number of Hindi-Urdu speakers was 300 million in 1995, placing Hindustani as the third-most spoken language globally.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable col2right\"\n|+Native speakers of Hindustani by country\n!Country or territory\n!Number of Native speakers\n!%\n!Status\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Notes & References\n|-\n|\n|829,000\n|2%\n|Minority Language\n|\n|-\n|\n|460,000\n|37.6%\n|Official Language (Hindi)\n|\n|-\n|\n|79,539\n|6.1%\n|Minority Language\n|Bhojpuri is considered a dialect of Hindustani.\n|-\n|\n|579,119,824\n|48%\n|Official Language (Hindi)Scheduled Language (Urdu)\n|Total native speakers of Hindi & Urdu.\n|-\n|\n|22,332,193\n|9.3%\n|National Language (Urdu)\n|\n|-\n|\n|441,000\n|4.2%\n|Court Language (Hindi)\n|\n|-\n|\n|321,465\n|0.9%\n|Minority Language\n|\n|-\n|\n|61,000\n|4.4%\n|Minority Language\n|Trinidadian Hindustani\n|-\n|\n|54,000\n|1.9%\n|Minority Language\n|\n|-\n|\n|150,000\n|24%\n|Minority Language\n|Sarnámi Hindustáni\n|-\n|\n|6,000\n|1.9%\n|Minority Language\n|\n|-\n|\n|870,399\n|3%\n|Minority Language\n|Awadhi and Bhojpuri are considered separate in Nepal's Census.\n|-\n|\n|845,000\n|2.1%\n|Minority Language\n|\n|-\n|\n|221,684\n|0.8%\n|Minority Language\n|\n|-\n|\n|84,000\n|1.6%\n|Minority Language\n|\n|-\n|\n|344,654\n|0.5%\n|Minority Language\n|\n|-\n|\n|1,372,802\n|0.4%\n|Minority Language\n|\n|-\n!Total\n!484,630,000\n!5.9%\n!-\n!-\n|}\nGeographical distribution\nAsia\nPakistan\n, Delhi, depicting Hindi (top) and Urdu (bottom-left).]]\nIn Pakistan, Urdu serves as the National language and is spoken by approximately 9% of the population as a first language, while it is understood by a much larger segment of the population, serving as the nation's Lingua franca.
