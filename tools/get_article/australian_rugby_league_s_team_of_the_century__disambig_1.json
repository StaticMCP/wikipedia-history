The list was released in February 2008.\nFrom this list a \"Team of the Century\" was selected  – a team of 17 Australian players considered to be the best of all time in each position (plus four interchange/reserves and a coach). This illustrious line-up was announced in Sydney on 17 April 2008.\n{|class = \"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Team of the Century\n! No. !! colspan=2|Name !! Position !! Clubs !! State !! Era !!
