During the ceremony, AVN presented AVN Awards (commonly referred to as the Oscars of porn) in 89 categories honoring the movies released during the period December 1, 1993 to November 30, 1994. The ceremony was produced by Gary Miller, Mark Stone and Marco Polo.

Other winners included Dog Walker and Shame with five each.

Shame, an avant-garde western, earned ten nominations while Body & Soul and The Dinner Party had nine apiece.\nThe winners were announced during the awards ceremony on January 7, 1995.

His co-host for the first half of the show was Dyanna Lauren while Tera Heart co-hosted the last half of the show.\nMidway through the show, AVN executive editor Gene Ross introduced a montage of scenes of humorous moments from a variety of movies, \"Great Moments in Adult Video History\", featuring actor Randy West and dozens of others.\nSeveral other people were involved with the production of the ceremony. Gary Miller and Mark Stone served as producer and director for the show while Marco Polo served as director of the broadcast. Stone also served as musical director.\nThere were several new categories for this year's awards show, including: Best Ethnic-Themed Video, Best Special Effects, the Hot Vidéo Award (Best European Release), Most Outrageous Sex Scene and a couple more awards in gay categories.\nJohn Wayne Bobbitt: Uncut was announced as the movie with the most sales and also the most rentals over the 12 months.\nA VHS videotape of the show was also published and sold by VCA Pictures, which had hardcore clips of the winning movies interspersed with the awards presentations. A softcore version was made available on VHS for promotional purposes by NightVision.\nCritical reception\nThe show received a mixed reception from media publications. Erotic X-Film Guide called the show \"a gala, star-studded event equal in glitz and glamor to any mainstream film awards show\". However, Oui magazine and Adult Cinema Review said the video montage didn't work and some of the other entertainment was long, boring and tedious.\nIn Memoriam\nAVN publisher Paul Fishbein shared a moment of remembrance for industry performers who died over the past 12 months:\n* Jack Baker\n* Moana Pozzi\n* Michel Ricaud\n* Savannah\n* Joey Stefano\nSee also\n* AVN Award for Best Actress\n* AVN Award for Best Supporting Actress\n* AVN Award for Male Performer of the Year\n* AVN Award for Male Foreign Performer of the Year\n* AVN Award for Female Foreign Performer of the Year\n* AVN Female Performer of the Year Award\n* List of members of the AVN Hall of Fame\nNotes\nThe wrong winner was announced at the show. Adult Video News magazine corrected the mistake: \"A program misprint and the fact that Tammi Ann's name was inadvertently dropped, might have caused some confusion in this category. Buttslammers 3 was announced from the program dais, however Buttslammers 4 is the official winner.\"\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Adult_Video_News_Awards/ Adult Video News Awards]  at the Internet Movie Database\n*\n*\n*"
