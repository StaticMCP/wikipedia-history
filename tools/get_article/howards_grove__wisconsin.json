Howards Grove began as two unincorporated communities: Millersville and Howards Grove. They united as one village in 1967, forming the longest municipality name in the state (Howards Grove–Millersville), before it was shortened to Howards Grove by referendum in 1972. In the year 1846, the first immigrants started to make an appearance and settled in the surrounding wilderness which was named the town of Herman. Sheboygan, which was ten miles from where they had settled, was their main source of supplies. The main occupation of this area since the 1840s has been farming. The farming community had always had a focus on growing oats and wheat but as early as November 29, 1899, the Sheboygan Telegram noted that there had been a change in operation. The focus was changed to dairy farming. Today, farming still rules the community.\nGeography\nIntersection of Wisconsin Highway 32 and 42\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which,  of it is land and  is water.\nDemographics\n}}\nAs of 2000, the median income for a household in the village was $59,032, and the median income for a family was $65,243.
