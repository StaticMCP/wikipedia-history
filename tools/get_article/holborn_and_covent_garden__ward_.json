The ward was first used in the 2002 elections. It returns three councillors to Camden London Borough Council. The ward covers some parts of Covent Garden and Holborn in Central London. The boundary of the ward was revised in 2022, which removed some streets north of New Oxford Street and transferred them to Bloomsbury. The ward has only returned councillors standing as Labour Party candidates.\nList of councillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! Term\n!
