He made his provincial debut for Wellington in 2001, then played with Bay of Plenty from 2003 to 2005.\nStewart was capped twice by Samoa in 2005, debuting as the team's fullback in the one-off Test against Australia at Stadium Australia in Sydney. His other appearance came in Nuku'alofa against Tonga.\nIn 2006, Stewart joined English club Coventry and had his time at the club cut short when he tested positive for ephedrine, receiving a two-year ban by the International Rugby Board, later reduced to 18-months. He has claimed that the positive test was the result of a training supplement he had taken.\nStewart made a return to provincial rugby in 2009, playing again for Wellington.\nSee also\n*List of Samoa national rugby union players\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
