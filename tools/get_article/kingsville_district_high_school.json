Enrollment is 656 students. KDHS feeder schools are Harrow Public School, Kingsville Public School and Jack Miner Public School. The school is the \"Home of the Cavaliers\".\nHistory\nThe school opened in 1921 at its present location after a fire destroyed Essex District High School. There were then three teachers and about 100 students.\nIn 1953, a new building was erected on the site, with additions in 1954, 1963, 1967 and 1972.\nIn 2016 Harrow District High School closed and merged with Kingsville District High School.\nIn June 2016, Kingsville District High School students held a Pride flag raising ceremony to recognize June as LGBT Pride Month. The school was one of the first in the district to raise a pride flag.\nFuture\nIn April 2016, the Ministry of Education announced funding for a $44-million JK-to-g 12 school to be located in Kingsville. The new school would consolidate students from Kingsville District High School, Harrow District High School, Kingsville Public School, and Jack Miner Public School, and may be the most expensive school the province has ever built.\nIn 2021, the project was tendered over budget. In March 2022, the Ministry of Education announced the full $59 million to complete the project. The school was expected to open in 2024.\nSee also\n* Education in Ontario\n* List of secondary schools in Ontario\nReferences"
