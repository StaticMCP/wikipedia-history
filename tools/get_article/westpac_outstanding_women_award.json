Since its inception in 2002, when it was called the Westpac Women in Business Award, the Award has recognized the achievements of individual women in multiple categories. Each category awardee then becomes a finalist for the overall WOW Award. In the face of acknowledged gender inequity in the country, the WOW Awards call attention to the crucial and highly skilled work done by women across a number of sectors. The winner of the WOW Award receives a grant to pursue a formal education, professional mentoring, opportunities for professional learning and networking at an Australian Executive Women's Leadership symposium, and a cash prize. The WOW Awards support the belief that investment in women leads to stronger economic outcomes for a nation as a whole, and strives to provide role models for the girls and women of the country.\nIn 2025, after a five-year hiatus, [https://www.westpac.com.pg/ Westpac Papua New Guinea] relaunched its [https://www.westpac.com.pg/westpac-outstanding-women-awards/ Westpac Outstanding Women Awards]  with a renewed strategy aimed at promoting gender equality and leadership development.
