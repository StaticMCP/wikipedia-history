H. Riddell, he was born in October 1845 at Carlton-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire. He was educated at Uppingham School, after which he became a banker and served as a justice of the peace. Riddell played first-class cricket on four occasions, making his first-class debut for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Nottinghamshire at Lord's in 1870. He played a first-class match for the Gentlemen of the North in the same year against the Gentlemen of the South at Beeston. He made two further first-class appearances in 1871, playing one match each for the MCC and the Gentlemen of the North. Across his four first-class matches, Riddell scored 89 runs with a high score of 36, in addition to taking two wickets with his right-arm medium-fast bowling. He died at Lincoln in October 1898.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
