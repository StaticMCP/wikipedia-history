Winners also receive support and mentoring sessions from Channel 4's commissioning teams and comedy department.\nThe award was created to honour the memory of Sean Lock, who passed away from cancer in 2021. Fellow comedian and close friend Bill Bailey worked closely with Channel 4 to create the award. Bailey said, \"I am delighted that Channel 4 have created The Sean Lock Comedy Award. It's a way to honour Sean's memory and to inspire others to pursue their own unique comic brilliance.\"\nThe inaugural winner of the award in 2023 was Eric Rushton. The following year, the award was given to Harriet Dyer.\nReferences"
