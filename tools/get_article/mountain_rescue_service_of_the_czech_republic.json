It is a part of the integrated rescue system in the Czech Republic.\nHistory\nOn 24 March 1913 two skiers died in Krkonoše. Bohumil Hanč participated in a 50&nbsp;km long ski race and Václav Vrbata, his friend, came to cheer on him. During the race Hanč became exhausted and so Vrbata gave him his jacket to keep him warm. Both of these men died of hypothermia and this day is known as the Day of the Mountain Rescue Service of the Czech Republic.\nIn virtue of this incident was the Mountain Rescue Service in Krkonoše founded. It happened on 12 May 1935.\nLater on, in 1948 was Mountain Rescue Service founded in Jeseníky, the same year also in Šumava, 1949 in Orlické hory, 1951 in Beskydy, 1954 in Jizerské hory and finally 1955 in Krušné hory.\nOn 1 December 1954 Mountain Rescue Service became one united organisation. All volunteer teams were transferred into this organisation. Regional committees were established to control over its members.\nOn 21 June 1968 Mountain Rescue Service joined IKAR (International Mountain Rescue Services Federation) and UIAA (Union Internationale des Associations d´Alpinisme).\nSince 2004 Mountain Rescue Service is under Ministry of Regional Development.\nStructure\nAs stated before, Mountain Rescue Service operates in 7 districts.
