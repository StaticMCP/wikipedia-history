It was one of the 16 original municipal wards created in Liverpool in 1835 under the Municipal Corporations Act.\nOverview\nSt. Paul’s ward was one of the 16 original municipal wards created in Liverpool in 1835 under the Municipal Corporations Act. It was listed alongside others such as Everton & Kirkdale, Vauxhall, and Exchange. It elected three councillors, like the other original wards. The ward remained in place until April 1895, when ward boundaries were expanded and restructured, removing St. Paul’s from the list of active wards. The name “St. Paul” ward refers to a parish or church-dedicated area; such naming was common for wards in Liverpool in the 1800s, often taking names of prominent churches or parishes. Over time, boundary revisions and reorganisations (especially mid-20th century) led to the ward being abolished or merged with adjacent wards. Among the Liverpool electoral ward changes, many wards named after churches like St. Paul were removed or merged in general reorganisations around 1953.\nElections\n1835\nPolling place : At Mather's Baths, corner of St. Paul's-square and Virginia-street\n1836\n1837\n1838\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Time\n! colspan=\"2\" | George Wright\n! colspan=\"2\" | Christopher Rawdon\n|-\n!
