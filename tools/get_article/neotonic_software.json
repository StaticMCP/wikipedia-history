Google acquired the company in April 2003, bringing its Trakken CRM product in-house where it was still in use as recently as March 2009.\nThe company also developed the ClearSilver web templating language and the Archive email web archive. ClearSilver is open source and is used by several Google products and other projects such as Trac.  The ideas behind Archive formed the basis for Google Groups.\nPrior to Neotonic Software, David Jeske and Brandon Long worked together at eGroups and at Yahoo on Yahoo! Groups.  Both also attended the University of Illinois.\nReferences"
