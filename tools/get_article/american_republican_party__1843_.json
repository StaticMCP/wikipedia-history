This convention changed the name to the Native American Party and drafted a legislative program calling for a 21-year period preceding naturalization and other sweeping reforms in the immigration policy of the United States, as well as mandating the use of the Protestant King James Bible in public schools.\nDespite some initial success of the party, it lost public support following the Philadelphia nativist riots of 1844 during which American Republican Party members were involved in burning down two Catholic churches.\nIts founders included Lewis Charles Levin, Samuel Kramer, \"General\" Peter Sken Smith, James Wallace, and John Gitron.\nSee also\n* Free Soil Party\n* Know Nothing Party\n* [https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=IT9EAQAAMAAJ&hl=en&pg=GBS.PP1 The Crisis!: An Appeal to Our Countrymen, on the Subject of Foreign Influence in the United States!], a book published by the General Executive Committee of the American Republican Party in 1844 to describe the organization's anti-immigrant message.\nReferences\nSources\n* Adams, James Truslow.
