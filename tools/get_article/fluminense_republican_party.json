Its principal representative was the Florianist Nilo Peçanha, President of the Republic from 1909 to 1910. The moderate wing, led by governor and senator José Thomaz da Porciúncula, and linked to the São Paulo directorate was hostile to Florianism and did not support him.\nIn common with all of the parties of the República Velha, the PRF was abolished shortly after the inauguration of the Estado Novo by Decree-Law No. 37, 2 December 1937."
