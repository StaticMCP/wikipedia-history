      "text": "# Reported military losses during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus\n\nOn 20 July 1974, the armed forces of Turkey invaded the northern portion of the Republic of Cyprus in response to the Greek military junta-backed 1974 Cypriot coup d'état that took place on the island against the country's democratically elected president, Archbishop Makarios III. The initial phase of the Turkish invasion, commonly referred to as \"Attila-1\", lasted until 24 July 1974, after which the offensive faltered and a ground war ensued.\nOn 14 August 1974, the Turkish armed forces in northern Cyprus had been sufficiently reinforced to the extent that they were able to launch a second major offensive, \"Attila-2\", which expanded the area under its control to approximately 38% of the land mass by 18 August 1974 and the end of hostilities by cease fire.\nAttila 1 Offensive (20–23 July 1974)\n20 July 1974\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

One vessel was destroyed by air attack, and the other by artillery from a Turkish destroyer.\n|-\n| Artillery || 25-pounder || Cyprus National Guard || 182 Artillery Battalion || Lapithou-Kyrenia highway || 2 || This battalion lost two artillery pieces in a road accident whilst moving to their firing positions in the opening hour of the invasion.\n|-\n| Medium Tank || T-34/85 || Cyprus National Guard || 251 Infantry Battalion || Five Mile Beach (Pentemili) in Kyrenia || 5 || Five vehicles were seconded to the 251 Infantry battalion from the 23 Medium Tank Battalion prior to 15 July 1974 to support the aspects of the coup in Kyrenia and guard against a Turkish landing there. All five were lost in an assault on the Turkish beachhead (four were destroyed by infantry-portable light anti-tank weapons, the fifth was abandoned with mechanical failure).\n|-\n| Armoured Personnel Carrier || M113 || Turkish Army || 230 Mechanised Infantry Regiment (28 Division) || Five Mile Beach (Pentemili) in Kyrenia|| 2 || 20 M113 APCs of the 230 Mechanised Infantry Regiment (minus one battalion) were landed in the initial amphibious assault on Pentemili. With the Turkish tanks unable to wade ashore, a Greek Cypriot attack with tanks forced the M113s to attempt to support a confrontation. Consequently, the T-34 tanks destroyed two of the M113s with shots of 85mm HVAP ammunition.\n|-\n| Anti-Tank Weapons || Recoilless Rifles || Turkish Army || \"Cakmak\" Special Strike Force ||Five Mile Beach (Pentemili) in Kyrenia || 2 || A heavy initial attack by Greek Cypriot T-34s with infantry support inflicted the destruction of two crew-served recoilless rifle nests – one an M40A1 106mm and the other an M18A1 57mm.\n|-\n|Medium Tank || T-34/85 || Cyprus National Guard || Boufas Battle Group || Morphou-Kyrenia road, Kyrenia || 1 || A battle group (task force) led by Lt.Col Kostantinos Boufas included 3 T-34/85s sent from Morphou (23 Medium Tank Battalion).

Two T-34s were destroyed by Turkish air attack, and a third became trapped in obstacles and was abandoned. The example was captured intact by Turkish forces.\n|-\n| Armoured Personnel Carrier || BTR-152V1 || Cyprus National Guard || 286 Mechanised Infantry Battalion || Kontemnos, Nicosia || 6 || In an attempt to circumnavigate the Geunyeli highway junction to Kyrenia, a 286 battalion convoy of armoured vehicles attempted to pass through Kontemnos village.

The towed gun was left at the intersection of the Mia Millia to Dikomo intersection, it was set up and fired against the Turkish F-100s that strifed the nearby camp. It was abandoned by retrieving National Guard forces there. The Austin with the quad 50 was parked just east of the main gate to the HQ company camp of 361 Infantry battalion at Syhari. Only 3 of the 4 barrels worked and it fired at the same F-100s that the 14.7 fired at. It was also abandoned there by the retreating National Guard forces as it was immobile.\n|-\n|General purpose vehicle || Bedford || Cyprus National Guard || 181 Artillery Battalion || Syhari Village, Nicosia || 2 || Two general purpose vehicles were destroyed in the 10.30hrs air-attack at Syhari village.\n|-\n| Artillery || 25-pounder || Cyprus National Guard || 185 Artillery Battalion ||Camp Andrew Karvos, Athalassas || 5 || A Turkish air attack was launched against this National Guard base in Nicosia at 05.20hrs.
