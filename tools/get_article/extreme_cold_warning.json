Thus a temperature of  with no winds would not require a warning be issued. Under the new system the extreme cold warning is issued based on either the temperature or the wind chill being a certain value for at least two hours. The values range from  temperatures to  in parts of the Arctic.\nOn October 1, 2024, the NWS replaced the \"wind chill warning\" with the \"extreme cold warning.\" The standards governing issuance are set by local NWS offices. The step below an extreme cold warning is an \"extreme cold watch,\" which itself replaced the \"wind chill watch\" in October 2024.\nCanada\nAn extreme cold warning is issued when the following temperatures are expected to last for at least two hours, which different regions have different criteria for:\n*South-Central Ontario and Southwestern Ontario issued at\n*Southeastern Ontario, the Southern Interior of British Columbia, the British Columbia Coast and Atlantic Canada (excluding Labrador) issued at\n*Quebec (excluding northern Quebec) issued at\n*Northern Ontario (excluding the far north), Central Interior of British Columbia and the Prairies (Alberta, southern Manitoba, southern Saskatchewan) issued at\n*Far northern Ontario, northern Manitoba (excluding northeastern Manitoba), northern Saskatchewan, Northern Interior of British Columbia and Labrador issued at\n*Northern Quebec (excluding Nunavik) issued at\n*Yukon, Northwest Territories (excluding Paulatuk, Sachs Harbour, Ulukhaktok), Baffin Island, and northeastern Manitoba issued at\n*Nunavik issued at\n*Northwest Territories (Paulatuk, Sachs Harbour, Ulukhaktok only) and Nunavut (excluding Baffin Island) issued at\nUnited States\nIn the United States an extreme cold warning was an experimental weather warning issued by the National Weather Service  in North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota. The warning was issued if the temperature fell to  or colder with a wind of less than . It was an experimental advisory for when the air temperature was dangerously cold, but the wind was too little to warrant a Wind Chill Watch or Warning.\nThe Extreme Cold Warning was used from January 10, 2011 to April 15, 2011. It was discontinued beginning with the 2011-12 winter storm season. Only five Extreme Cold Warnings were issued in that period: one for Burleigh County, three for areas outside of the Bismarck–Mandan metropolitan area, and one for West Glacier, Montana\nIn a partner webinar on October 30, 2018, the National Weather Service announced that based on survey feedback, the Extreme Cold Warning and the Wind Chill Warning will be consolidated into the Extreme Cold Warning, meaning that this product would once again be issued on a regular basis. This change was hinted to take effect sometime in 2021, accounting for NWS software upgrades. This was confirmed at the AMS 2024 meeting in January 2024.\nIn October 2024, the NWS officially implemented these changes to its wind chill and hard freeze warnings, watches, and advisories (WWAs) as part of its \"Hazard Simplification initiative.\" The goal of these WWA name changes, per the NWS, is \"simplifying a suite of cold weather forecast products to improve messaging of winter hazards and provide better decision support.\" The changes include:\nExtreme Cold Consolidation and Renaming\n*Wind Chill Watch was renamed to Extreme Cold Watch\n*Wind Chill Warning was renamed to Extreme Cold Warning\n*Wind Chill Advisory was renamed to Cold Weather Advisory\nFreeze Consolidation\n*Hard Freeze Watch was renamed to Freeze Watch\n*Hard Freeze Warning was consolidated to Freeze Warning\nLocal NWS offices will still determine the standards governing the issuance of such WWAs.\nExample of an Extreme Cold Warning (United States)\nURGENT - WEATHER MESSAGE\nNational Weather Service Twin Cities/Chanhassen MN\n451 PM CST Mon Jan 20 2025\nMNZ054-056>060-062-064>070-073>077-082>085-091>093-210700-\n/O.UPG.KMPX.CW.Y.0002.000000T0000Z-250121T1800Z/\n/O.EXA.KMPX.EC.W.0001.000000T0000Z-250121T1800Z/\nLac Qui Parle-Chippewa-Kandiyohi-Meeker-Wright-Hennepin-Ramsey-\nYellow Medicine-Renville-McLeod-Sibley-Carver-Scott-Dakota-\nRedwood-Brown-Nicollet-Le Sueur-Rice-Watonwan-Blue Earth-Waseca-\nSteele-Martin-Faribault-Freeborn-\nIncluding the cities of Chanhassen, Waseca, Mankato, Fairmont,\nVictoria, Albert Lea, Olivia, St James, Hastings, Owatonna,\nGaylord, Minneapolis, Granite Falls, Willmar, Monticello,\nMadison, Litchfield, Hutchinson, Montevideo, Faribault, Chaska,\nSt Peter, Le Sueur, New Ulm, Redwood Falls, St Paul, Shakopee,\nand Blue Earth\n451 PM CST Mon Jan 20 2025\n...EXTREME COLD WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON CST TUESDAY...\n* WHAT...Dangerously cold wind chills as low as 37 below.\n* WHERE...Portions of central, east central, south central,\nsouthwest, and west central Minnesota.\n* WHEN...Until noon CST Tuesday.\n* IMPACTS...The dangerously cold wind chills could cause frostbite\non exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes.\nPRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...\nPersons are urged to stay indoors until conditions improve.

However, areas to the north, in the vicinity of the Yellowhead, will continue with the bitterly cold temperatures into Wednesday morning.\nTemperatures are expected to moderate for most by Thursday.\nExtreme cold puts everyone at risk.\nRisks are greater for young children, older adults, people with chronic illnesses, people working or exercising outdoors, and those without proper shelter.\nWatch for cold related symptoms: shortness of breath, chest pain, muscle pain and weakness, numbness and colour change in fingers and toes.\nCover up. Frostbite can develop within minutes on exposed skin, especially with wind chill.\nIf it’s too cold for you to stay outside, it’s too cold for your pet to stay outside.\nOutdoor workers should take regularly scheduled breaks to warm up.\nExtreme cold warnings are issued when very cold temperatures or wind chill creates an elevated risk to health such as frost bite and hypothermia.\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
