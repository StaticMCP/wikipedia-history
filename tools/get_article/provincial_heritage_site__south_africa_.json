The designation was a new one that came into effect with the introduction of the Act on 1 April 2000 when all former national monuments declared by the former National Monuments Council and its predecessors became provincial heritage sites as provided for in Section 58 of the Act.\nBoth provincial and national heritage sites are protected under the terms of Section 27 of the NHRA or legislation of the relevant province and a permit is required to work on them.  Provincial heritage sites are declared and administered by the relevant provincial heritage resources authority whilst national heritage sites are the responsibility of SAHRA.\nKwaZulu-Natal is the only province to have its own heritage legislation and provincial heritage sites are known as either 'heritage landmarks' or 'provincial landmarks' depending upon whether they are privately or government owned.\nMost provincial heritage sites are still marked with an old national monuments badge, but provincial heritage resources authorities in KwaZulu-Natal, the Northern Cape and Western Cape have developed their own badges.\nList of Heritage sites by province\nThe lists have been split up by province. Some districts have been split off from their province for site performance reasons.\n* List of heritage sites in Eastern Cape\n* List of heritage sites in Albany\n* List of heritage sites in Graaff-Reinet\n* List of heritage sites in Port Elizabeth\n* List of heritage sites in Free State\n* List of heritage sites in Gauteng\n* List of heritage sites in KwaZulu-Natal\n* List of heritage sites in Pietermaritzburg\n* List of heritage sites in Limpopo\n* List of heritage sites in Mpumalanga\n* List of heritage sites in North West\n* List of heritage sites in Northern Cape\n* List of heritage sites in Colesberg\n* List of heritage sites in Kimberley\n* List of heritage sites in Richmond\n* List of heritage sites in Victoria West\n* List of heritage sites in Western Cape\n* List of heritage sites in Paarl\n* List of heritage sites in Simonstown\n* List of heritage sites in Stellenbosch\n* List of heritage sites in Swellendam\n* List of heritage sites in Table Mountain\n* List of heritage sites in the Cape\n* List of heritage sites in Tulbagh\n* List of heritage sites in Worcester\n* List of heritage sites in Wynberg\nSee also\n* List of heritage sites in South Africa\n* Heritage objects (South Africa)\n* South African Heritage Resources Agency\n* Amafa aKwaZulu-Natali\n* Heritage Western Cape\n* National Monuments Council (South Africa and Namibia)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.sahra.org.za/ South African Heritage Resource Agency]\nProvincial Heritage Resources Authorities:\n* [http://www.heritagekzn.co.za/ KwaZulu Natal - Amafa/Heritage KwaZulu Natal]\n* [http://www.HWC.org.za Western Cape - Heritage Western Cape]\n* [http://www.heritagefreestate.co.za/ Free State - Heritage Free State]\n* [http://www.ecphra.org.za/ Eastern Cape - Eastern Cape Provincial Heritage Resources Authority]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130121082039/http://www.mpumalanga.gov.za/dept/scr.htm Mpumalanga - Mpumalanga Provincial Heritage Resources Authority]\n* [http://www.sac.limpopo.gov.za/ Limpopo - Limpopo Heritage Resources Authority]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131115220723/http://www.nwpg.gov.za/dsac/ North West - North West Provincial Heritage Resources Authority]\n* [http://www.northern-cape.gov.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=321 Northern Cape - Ngwao-Boswa Jwa Kapa Bokone]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130630063501/http://www.sacr.gpg.gov.za/Pages/Heritage,Museums,GeographicalNamesandLanguage.aspx Gauteng - Provincial Heritage Resources Authority Gauteng]\n* [http://196.35.231.29/sahra/default.aspx Searchable database of protected sites, objects and shipwrecks]"
