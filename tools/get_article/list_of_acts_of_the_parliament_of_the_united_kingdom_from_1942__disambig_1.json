For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3. c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\n5 & 6 Geo. 6\nContinuing the seventh session of the 37th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 12 November 1941 until 10 November 1942.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 5 & 6 G. 6.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and for purposes connected therewith.}}\n|  }}\n-\n|  or the Defence (Finance) Regulations (Isle of Man), 1939.|note4= }}\n|  with amendments, and to provide for the prospective repeal of the Ministers of the Crown (Emergency Appointments) Act, 1939.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  as respects the war years.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  interests arising under certain concurrent leases, and for purposes connected therewith.|note4= }}\n-\n|\n|\n|  }}\n| renamed to |public|23|24-06-1942|repealed=n|maintained=y|An Act to make provision in connection with the appointment of a Minister of Works and Planning, to provide for the transfer to that Minister of the functions and property of the Commissioners of Works, of the functions and property of the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, and of functions of the Minister of Health in relation to town and country planning;
