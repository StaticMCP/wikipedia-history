As in several species of chameleons in the genus Bradypodion, the Smith's dwarf chameleon can use its color-changing ability to actively camouflage itself depending on the vision of the specific predator species (for example, bird or snake) by which it is being threatened.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://vmus.adu.org.za/vm_search.php?database=sarca&URL=http://sarca.adu.org.za&Logo=images/sarca_logo.png&Headline=Southern%20African%20Reptile%20Conservation%20Assessment&Records_per_page=25&Use_main_filter=0&User_id=&Full_name=&query_id=&Vm_number=&recNo=&numRows=&start=&option=sp_map Search for Distribution of Bradypodion taeniabronchum]"
