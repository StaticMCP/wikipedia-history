Foreman has deep integration to configuration management software, with Ansible, Puppet, Chef, Salt and other solutions through plugins, which allows users to automate repetitive tasks, deploy applications, and manage change to deployed servers.\nForeman provides provisioning on bare-metal (through managed DHCP, DNS, TFTP, and PXE-based unattended installations), virtualization and cloud. Foreman provides comprehensive, auditable interaction facilities, including a web frontend, a command line interface, and a robust REST API.\nHistory\nInitial development on Foreman started in July 2009 under a different project name. The initial release 0.1 was committed in September 2009 by Ohad Levy.\nAvailability\nForeman is targeted on Linux operating systems, but users reported successful installations on Microsoft Windows, BSD, and macOS.\nThe core Foreman team maintains repositories for various Linux distributions: Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (and derivatives such as CentOS), Debian, and Ubuntu.\nPlugins\nForeman comes with freely available plugins to increase functionality. All plugins are available on GitHub.\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | Date\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | Version\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | Changes and additions\n|-\n| 14 October 2013\n| 1.3.0\n| Improvements were made in the installation process, API, scalability, existing hosts mapping to compute resources, and more.
