      "text": "# Shadows of the Empire Planets Guide\n\nShadows of the Empire Planets Guide is a 1996 role-playing game supplement published by West End Games for Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game.\nContents\nShadows of the Empire Planets Guide is a supplement in which concise descriptions are provided for four featured worlds—Rodia, Bothawi, Kothlis, and Vergesso—each with local details and one or more scenario hooks. Rodia is a jungle world linked to Greedo, Bothawi and Kothlis offer insight into the espionage-driven Bothan culture, and Vergesso serves as a chaotic pirate haven perfect for encounters. Overall, the guide combines setting summaries with adventure seeds.\nPublication history\nShannon Appelcline noted that in its final years, \"West End Games still had just one successful game, Star Wars – which had just been reprinted in a revised second edition (1996). The Star Wars line was even enjoying something of a renaissance, with some very innovative material going to press, notably the DarkStryder Campaign (1996), which took a darker look at the Star Wars universe. West End was also happily supporting the ever-growing 'expanded universe' by printing books like the Shadows of the Empire Planets Guide (1996) and the Tales of the Jedi Companion (1996).\"\nReception\nAndrew Rilstone reviewed Shadows of the Empire Planets Guide for Arcane magazine, rating it a 6 out of 10 overall, and stated that \"It's a nice little book that could form the basis for a fun campaign.\"\nReviews\n*Dragon #238\nReferences"
