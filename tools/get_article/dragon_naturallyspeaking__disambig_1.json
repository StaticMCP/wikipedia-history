It runs on Windows personal computers. Version 15 (Professional Individual and Legal Individual), which supports 32-bit and 64-bit editions of Windows 7, 8 and 10, was released in August 2016.\nFeatures\nDragon NaturallySpeaking uses a minimal user interface.  As an example, dictated words appear in a floating tooltip as they are spoken (though there is an option to suppress this display to increase speed), and when the speaker pauses, the program transcribes the words into the active window at the location of the cursor. (Dragon does not support dictating to background windows.) The software has three primary areas of functionality: voice recognition in dictation with speech transcribed as written text, recognition of spoken commands, and text-to-speech: speaking text content of a document. Voice profiles can be accessed by different computers in a networked environment, although the audio hardware and configuration must be identical to those of the machine generating the configuration. The Professional version allows creation of custom commands to control programs or functions not built into NaturallySpeaking.\nHistory\nDr. James Baker laid out the description of a speech understanding system called DRAGON in 1975.\nIn 1982 he and Dr. Janet M. Baker, his wife, founded Dragon Systems to release products centered around their voice recognition prototype. He was President of the company and she was CEO.\nDragonDictate was first released for DOS, and utilized hidden Markov models, a probabilistic method for temporal pattern recognition. At the time, the hardware was not powerful enough to address the problem of word segmentation, and DragonDictate was unable to determine the boundaries of words during continuous speech input. Users were forced to enunciate one word at a time, clearly separated by a small pause after each word. DragonDictate was based on a trigram model, and is known as a discrete utterance speech recognition engine.\nDragon Systems released NaturallySpeaking 1.0 as their first continuous dictation product in 1997.\nThe company was then purchased in June 2000 by Lernout & Hauspie, a Belgium-based corporation that was subsequently found to have been perpetrating financial fraud. Following the all-share deal advised by Goldman Sachs, Lernout & Hauspie declared bankruptcy in November 2000. The deal was not originally supposed to be all stock and the unavailability of the Goldman Sachs team to advise concerning the change in terms was one of the grounds of the Bakers' subsequent lawsuit. The Bakers had received stock worth hundreds of millions of US dollars, but were only able to sell a few million dollars' worth before the stock lost all its value as a result of the accounting fraud. The Bakers sued Goldman Sachs for negligence, intentional misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty, which in January 2013 led to a 23-day trial in Boston. The jury cleared Goldman Sachs of all charges. Following the bankruptcy of Lernout & Hauspie, the rights to the Dragon product line were acquired by ScanSoft of Burlington, Massachusetts, also a Goldman Sachs client. In 2005 ScanSoft launched a de facto acquisition of Nuance Communications, and rebranded itself as Nuance.\nAs of 2012, LG Smart TVs included voice recognition feature powered by the same speech engine as Dragon NaturallySpeaking. In 2014, following the discontinuation of DragonDictate for Mac, a product dating back to Nuance's 2010 purchase of MacSpeech Dictate, NaturallySpeaking gained Mac compatibility, though Mac support was later terminated in 2018.\nIn 2021, Microsoft announced plans to acquire Nuance, and therefore Dragon NaturallySpeaking. The acquisition completed in March 2022.\nVersions\n{| Class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Dragon Naturally Speaking Version\n!Release date\n!Editions\n!Operating Systems Supported\n|-\n|1.0\n|April 1997\n|Personal\n|Windows 95, NT 4.0.\n|-\n|2.0\n|November 1997\n|Standard, Preferred, Deluxe\n|Windows 95, NT 4.0\n|-\n|3.0\n|October 1998\n|Point & Speak, Standard, Preferred, Professional (with optional Legal and Medical add-on products)\n|Windows 95, 98, NT 4.0.\n|-\n|4.0\n|August 4, 1999\n|Essentials, Standard, Preferred, Professional, Legal, Medical, Mobile\n|Windows 95, 98, NT 4.0 SP3+.\n|-\n|5.0\n|August 2000\n|Essentials, Standard, Preferred, Professional, Legal, Medical\n|Windows 98, Me, NT 4.0 SP6+, 2000.\n|-\n|6.0\n|November 15, 2001\n|Essentials, Standard, Preferred, Professional, Legal, Medical\n|\n|-\n|7.0\n|March 2003\n|Essentials, Standard, Preferred, Professional, Legal, Medical\n|Windows 98SE, Me, NT4 SP6+, 2000, XP.\n|-\n|8.0\n|November 2004\n|Essentials, Standard, Preferred, Professional, Legal, Medical\n|Windows Me (Only Standard and Preferred editions), Windows 2000 SP4+, Windows XP SP1+.\n|-\n|9.0\n|July 2006\n|Standard, Preferred, Professional, Legal, Medical, SDK client, SDK server,\n|Windows 2000 SP4+, XP SP1+.\n|-\n|9.5\n|January 2007\n|Standard, Preferred, Professional, Legal, Medical, SDK client, SDK server\n|Windows 2000 SP4+, XP SP1+, Vista (32-bit).\n|-\n|10.0\n|August 7, 2008\n|Essentials, Standard, Preferred, Professional, Legal, Medical\n|Windows 2000 SP4+, XP SP2+ (32-bit), Vista (32-bit).
