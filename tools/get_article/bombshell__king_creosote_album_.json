I've got a daughter now, she's 8 and there's a song \"Church as Witness\" about a fall out she and I had, and yeah, there's others coming from a sort of older period in time just about all different things really. They are some comedy things on there. A lot of it I suppose is relationship based and then I suppose there's \"You've No clue Do You?\" which is a kind of a \"who-done-it?\" in the grand \"Cluedo\" tradition.\nTrack listing\n#Leslie\n#Home In A Sentence\n#You've No Clue Do You\n#Cowardly Custard\n#Church As Witness\n#There's None Of That\n#Nooks\n#Now Drop Your Bombshell\n#Admiral\n#Cockle Shell\n#Spystick\n#At The WAL\n#And The Racket They Made\nReferences"
