The team was not affiliated with FIFA or UEFA and therefore could not compete for the FIFA World Cup or the UEFA European Championship. The LPR team had been a member of CONIFA, although it later withdrew.\nHistory\nThe Luhansk Football Union was founded on October 4, 2014. FC Zorya Luhansk alumnus Anatoliy Kuksov coached the team prior to his death in January 2022. The LPR team took part in the 2018 CONIFA World Football Cup qualification but failed to make it through to the finals. Sascha Düerkop, general secretary of CONIFA, stated that he did not agree with the LPR team politically — comparing them negatively with the Chagossians — but that \"that was not the point\" and they were allowed to compete. CONIFA were criticised for supporting \"Russia-backed separatism.\" The LPR team was scheduled to take part in the 2019 CONIFA European Football Cup but later withdrew. After the Russian annexation of the LPR the team ceased to exist.\nInternational results\n|time         =\n|event        =\n|round        = Friendly\n|team1        =\n|team2        =\n|score        = 1–0\n|aet          =\n|goals1       =\n|goals2       =\n|stadium      = Republican Stadium, Sukhumi\n|attendance   =\n|referee      =\n|report       =\n|penalties1   =\n|penaltyscore =\n|penalties2   =\n|size=75%|result       = L\n}}\n|time         =\n|event        =\n|round        = Friendly\n|team1        =\n|team2        =\n|score        = 4–1\n|aet          =\n|goals1       =\n|goals2       =\n|stadium      = Metalurh Stadium, Donetsk\n|attendance   =\n|referee      =\n|report       =\n|penalties1   =\n|penaltyscore =\n|penalties2   =\n|size=75%|result       = L\n}}\n|time         =\n|event        =\n|round        = Friendly\n|team1        =\n|team2        =\n|score        = 3–1\n|aet          =\n|goals1       =\n|goals2       =\n|stadium      = Avanhard Stadium, Luhansk\n|attendance   =\n|referee      =\n|report       =\n|penalties1   =\n|penaltyscore =\n|penalties2   =\n|size=75%|result       = W\n}}\n|time         =\n|event        =\n|round        = Friendly\n|team1        =\n|team2        =\n|score        = 1–1\n|aet          =\n|goals1       =\n|goals2       =\n|stadium      = Metalurh Stadium, Yenakiieve\n|attendance   =\n|referee      =\n|report       =\n|penalties1   =\n|penaltyscore =\n|penalties2   =\n|size=75%|result       = D\n}}\n|time         =\n|event        =\n|round        = Friendly\n|team1        =\n|team2        =\n|score        = 4–3\n|aet          =\n|goals1       =\n|goals2       =\n|stadium      = Avanhard Stadium, Luhansk\n|attendance   =\n|referee      =\n|report       =\n|penalties1   =\n|penaltyscore =\n|penalties2   =\n|size=75%|result       = W\n}}\n|time         =\n|event        =\n|round        = Friendly\n|team1        =\n|team2        =\n|score        = 2–0\n|aet          =\n|goals1       =\n|goals2       =\n|stadium      = Guram Tskhovrebov Stadium, Tskhinvali\n|attendance   =\n|referee      =\n|report       =\n|penalties1   =\n|penaltyscore =\n|penalties2   =\n|size=75%|result       = L\n}}\nSee also\n* Donetsk People's Republic national football team\nNotes\nReferences"
