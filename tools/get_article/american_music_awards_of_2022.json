Starting in 2025, the ceremony aired on CBS and streamed on Paramount+.\nBackground and broadcast\nOn September 15, 2022, Dick Clark Productions (DCP) and ABC announced that the 50th American Music Awards (AMAS) would be held on November 20 at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, with Jesse Collins executive producing the show together with Dionne Harmon and Jeannae Rouzan-Clay, and Larry Klein as producer. Tickets for the show went on sale on October 7 via AXS.com. Nominations were revealed on October 13. The show aired live on ABC and was made available for streaming the day after on Hulu.\nThe ceremony recorded the lowest-ever viewership in the history of the awards, with an audience of 3.3 million. It earned a 0.6 demo rating, marking a significant drop compared to the previous year's 3.8 million audience and 1.0 rating.\nPerformances\nPerformers were announced on October 31 and November 14, 2022. D-Nice served as the house DJ. Yola, GloRilla, Dove Cameron, and Anitta made their AMAs performance debuts at the show. Pink performed twice: first as the show's opening act, and later to sing \"Hopelessly Devoted to You\" in tribute to Olivia Newton-John following her death in August 2022. As the recipient of the inaugural Song of Soul award, Yola performed her song \"Break the Bough\", from the 2022 film Elvis.  Stevie Wonder and Charlie Puth performed a special extended medley of select Lionel Richie songs in honor of the singer being the year's Icon Award recipient. They were eventually joined onstage by several other artists including Ari Lennox, Melissa Etheridge, Yola, and Smokey Robinson. Though Tems, WizKid, and Richie were originally announced as performers, they did not perform on the show.\nOn November 21, Chris Brown shared a video clip on Instagram of a rehearsal for a tribute performance he had originally prepared for the show in honor of the 40th anniversary of Michael Jackson's Thriller (1982). Brown revealed that it had been cancelled by the AMAS \"for reasons unknown\" the day before the show was set to air. In response, a spokesperson for DCP stated that the cancellation was due to \"creative direction\" and not any fault of Brown's. He would have been joined by Ciara for the performance.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ List of musical performances\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Artist(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Song(s)\n|-\n| Pink\n| \"Never Gonna Not Dance Again\"\n|-\n| Bebe Rexha\n| \"I'm Good (Blue)\"\n|-\n| Anitta\n| \"Envolver\"\"Lobby\"\n|-\n| Carrie Underwood\n| \"Crazy Angels\"\n|-\n| GloRillaCardi B\n| \"Tomorrow\"\n|-\n| Imagine Dragons\n| \"Bones\"\"Enemy\"\n|-\n| Pink\n| Olivia Newton-John Tribute\"Hopelessly Devoted to You\"\n|-\n| Lil Baby\n| \"In a Minute\"\"California Breeze\"\n|-\n| Yola\n| \"Break the Bough\"\n|-\n| Dove Cameron\n| \"Boyfriend\"\n|-\n| Stevie WonderCharlie Puth\n| Lionel Richie Tribute\"Three Times a Lady\"\"Easy\"\"All Night Long (All Night)\"\"Say You, Say Me\"\"Brick House\"\"Jesus is Love\"\"We Are the World\"\n|}\nPresenters\nWayne Brady was announced as the show's host on October 24.
