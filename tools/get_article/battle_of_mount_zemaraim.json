About 500,000 Israelites were said to have lain dead after this single engagement, though most modern commentators consider the numbers to be either wildly exaggerated or symbolic, and some have even questioned its fundamental historicity.\nBiblical narrative\nAccording to the scripture, the friction all began when the late king Rehoboam increased the royal taxes throughout the Kingdom of Israel after Solomon died in about 931&nbsp;BC. This created discontent among all the Israelite tribes of the kingdom, excepting Judah and Benjamin, and the people's discontent soon became a rebellion when the king, against the advice of the elders, refused to lessen the burdens of royal taxation. The ten northern tribes of Israel eventually broke up from the kingdom and made a new Kingdom of Israel with the former fugitive and exile Jeroboam as king, provoking a civil war. Rehoboam then went to war against the new kingdom with a force of 180,000 soldiers, but was advised against fighting his brethren, so he returned to Jerusalem.\nEver since the unified kingdom was divided, there had been constant border issues between the two parties, and both attempted to settle them. Abijah succeeded to the throne after the death of his father Rehoboam, and attempted to reunite all of Israel, including Judah, under his rule. According to biblical sources, Abijah had an army of 400,000, all of them handpicked or conscripted, and Jeroboam had 800,000 warriors.\nBefore the battle, Abijah addressed the armies of Israel, urging them to submit and to let the Kingdom of Israel be whole again. Abijah then rallied his own troops with an address to all the people of Israel:\nHowever, his plea to Jeroboam was not heeded. Jeroboam had set up an ambush to come from the rear of Abijah's army, so that the latter's army would be fighting on his army's front and rear, executing a giant pincer movement. All of the soldiers of Judah pleaded to God for help, and then the priests blew the trumpets. Abijah was quick in countering this move made by Jeroboam; he ordered his warriors to fight bravely and countered the pincer movement executed by Jeroboam to his warriors, almost utterly crushing the latter's huge army.\nKing Abijah and the warriors of Judah who were under his command had won, killing 500,000 Israelite warriors in the process. The rest of the Israelite army fled from the battlefield heading back north, and the forces of Judah then staged a relentless pursuit against them, taking the cities of Bethel, Jeshanah and Ephron during the ensuing pursuit. The factor for Judah's success in the battle is mainly attributed to Abijah and his troops' devotion to their God.\nJeroboam was crippled by this severe defeat to Abijah and thus posed little threat to the Kingdom of Judah for the rest of his reign; however, despite being victorious, Abijah failed to reunify Israel and Judah.\nHistoricity\nMost modern historians consider the numbers to be either wildly exaggerated or symbolic, and some have even questioned the battle's fundamental historicity. A chronology proposed by Edwin Thiele suggests the battle would have taken place around 913&nbsp;BC.\nYohanan Aharoni, in his book The Carta Bible Atlas, claims that the battle of Mount Zemariam was actually part of the fratricidal war that lasted throughout the reigns of Rehoboam, Abijah, and Asa. According to him, most of the battles took place in the territory of the tribe of Benjamin, including the battle of Mount Zemariam.\nIn Rabbinic literature\nDespite the miraculous victory described in the Bible, Rabbinic literature criticizes Abijah's actions in this war. Regarding the verse that appears at the end of the war \"Jeroboam did not regain power during the time of Abijah. And the Lord struck him down and he died.\" (2 Chronicles 13:20), Rabbi Samuel ben Nahman said \"You think that Jeroboam was struck down, but no, it was Abijah who was struck down.\" The Midrash lists three sins of Abijah for which he was struck, according to this interpretation. Rabbi Johanan bar Nappaha said that by referring to Jeroboam's rebellion against Rehoboam as a rebellion of \"villains\" (בני בליעל) even though Ahijah the Shilonite took part in it, he humiliated Ahijah. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said that Abijah sinned in his speech describing the sins of the Kingdom of Israel, because in doing so he publicly shamed the people of Israel. Another opinion refers specifically to Abijah's activities after the victory, and criticizes the fact that after the conquest of Beth El, Abijah did not destroy the golden calf that Jeroboam had set up there.\nIn addition, Abijah's is described as cruel. The Rabbinical text interpreted \"a great blow\" (2 Chronicles 13:17) to mean that Abijah was not satisfied with killing the Israelite warriors, but also ensured that the bodies could not be identified.\nSee also\n*Battle of Qarqar\n*Northern Kingdom of Israel\n*Kingdom of Judah\n*Neo-Assyrian Empire\n*List of battles before 301\n* List of Israelite civil conflicts\nReferences"
