The Duke of Jägerndorf, a Protestant leader in Silesia, decided to restore Protestant power in the Bohemian kingdom. In the northeastern part of nearby Moravia, Protestant Wallachians fought against Roman Catholics, and further east in Slovakia (Upper Hungary) Protestants attempted to ally with forces of Hungarian prince Gabor Bethlen.\nAt Neutitschein, a strong Catholic force was assembled and engaged the Protestant forces which had occupied towns and castles in Silesia and northern Moravia. During the battle, a huge fire started and all suburbs of Neutitschein burned down. This fire prevented the Catholic forces to successfully defend the town and only a small part of them, led by Jean de Gauchier, escaped to Olomouc (Olmütz), leaving northern Moravia under Protestant control.  Yet, since the Protestant forces were unable to conquer Olomouc and occupy all of Moravia, the Duke of Jägerndorf decided to move to Slovakia to join forces with Gabor Bethlen.\nReferences\n* Radek Fukala.
