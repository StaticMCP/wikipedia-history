Per the 2020 census, the population was 1,713, up from 1,698 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Pensacola&ndash;Ferry Pass&ndash;Brent, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.\nHistory\nCentury was founded in 1901 as a sawmill company town, and named because 1901 was the first year of the 20th century. A post office has been in operation at Century since 1901. It was officially incorporated as the Town of Century in 1945.\nGeography\nThe approximate coordinates for the Town of Century is located on the Florida Panhandle at  (30.977648, –87.261500).\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which  is land and , or 3.69%, is water.\nCentury is located in the western highlands of Florida. This physiographic province of the northern Gulf Coast region is made up of sand, silt, and clay hills. These highlands are deeply incised by creeks and rivers. Century is located on the western edge of the Escambia River floodplain. A small portion of the town (the eastern side) is within the floodplain itself. Most of the community, however, is located above the floodplain on level to gently sloping hillsides.\nCentury's roadway network is highly irregular. It does not conform to the state of Florida's section, township and range survey system, for two reasons. The first is because Spanish land grants were issued along the Escambia River in the 16th and 17th centuries. These boundaries established a unique survey system that contorted east-to-west survey boundaries once Florida became a state and a state survey system was adopted, at which time previously existing survey systems were \"grandfathered\" in. The second reason for an irregular roadway and property boundary system is due to the community originally being built around the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (now the CSX railway). Automobile highways were eventually constructed, and closely paralleled the railway. U.S. Route 29 (US 29), a more modern highway, was constructed and moved many of the commercial operations west of the small original core of the community (now mostly located within the Alger-Sullivan Lumber Company Residential Historic District).\nUS 29 is used by residents of Escambia County to reach points north. Alabama State Route 113 leads north from the state line to Interstate 65 and provides the area with a route to Montgomery, Birmingham and Atlanta. From a southbound perspective, Century is en route between these major cities and the coastal beaches at Pensacola Beach and Perdido Key in Florida.\nCentury is the western terminus of State Road 4, which leads east to the communities of Jay, Munson, Baker, and Milligan.\nFresh water supplies are abundant, with water being withdrawn as groundwater from the local sand and gravel aquifer.\nIn 1970, oil was discovered in the nearby community of Jay. Oil was also discovered near the town of Century, especially to its northeast. Oil became important to the local economy during the last quarter of the 20th century.\nOn March 17 1970 , Chiles began the walk starting in Century, a small town in Escambia County along the Alabama state line. He initially headed east along State Road 4, toward Tallahassee.\nGravel and sand is mined in open pits in and near Century. These natural mineral deposits are essential to supporting the construction industries in nearby Pensacola and Mobile, especially for use as aggregate materials in concrete.\nTimber and pulpwood are other valuable natural commodities of the area. Nearby papermills at Cantontment, and Brewton, Alabama, provide a market for cut pulpwood.  Timber processing is conducted by another industry about  south of Century.\nClimate\nThe climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild winters. According to the Köppen climate classification, the Town of Century has a humid subtropical climate zone (Cfa).\nDemographics\n2010 2020\n}}\n2020 census\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+Century town, Florida – Racial and ethnic composition\n!Race / Ethnicity (NH = Non-Hispanic)\n!Pop 2010\n!Pop 2020\n!% 2010\n!% 2020\n|-\n|White (NH)\n|669\n|631\n|39.40%\n|36.84%\n|-\n|Black or African American (NH)\n|948\n|948\n|55.83%\n|55.34%\n|-\n|Native American or Alaska Native (NH)\n|7\n|11\n|0.41%\n|0.64%\n|-\n|Asian (NH)\n|8\n|2\n|0.47%\n|0.12%\n|-\n|Pacific Islander or Native Hawaiian (NH)\n|0\n|11\n|0.00%\n|0.64%\n|-\n|Some other race (NH)\n|0\n|14\n|0.00%\n|0.82%\n|-\n|Mixed race or Multiracial (NH)\n|47\n|67\n|2.77%\n|3.91%\n|-\n|Hispanic or Latino (any race)\n|19\n|29\n|1.12%\n|1.69%\n|-\n|Total\n|1,698\n|1,713\n|100.00%\n|100.00%\n|}\nAs of the 2020 United States census, there were 1,713 people, 739 households, and 413 families residing in the town.\nAs of the 2010 United States census, there were 1,698 people, 699 households, and 449 families residing in the town.\n2000 Census\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 1,714 people, 680 households, and 448 families residing in the town.
