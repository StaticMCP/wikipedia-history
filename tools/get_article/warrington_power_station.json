The power station was initially developed by the Warrington and District Electric Light and Power Company Limited, this was taken over by Warrington Corporation, which operated the power station prior to the nationalisation of the British electricity supply industry in 1948. It was redeveloped several times to meet the increased demand for electricity.\nHistory\nWarrington and District Electric Light and Power Company Limited was registered in January 1898 to generate and supply electricity to Warrington. A provisional order under the Electric Lighting Acts, the , was granted by the Board of Trade and was confirmed by Parliament through the Electric Lighting Orders Confirmation (No. 11) Act 1898 (61 & 62 Vict. c. xciv). The power station was built in Howley, Warrington (). Equipment was added to meet the rising demand for electricity; by 1922 it had a generating capacity of 7,750&nbsp;kW.\nFrom the establishment of the Warrington Corporation Tramways in 1902 the power station supplied electric current to tram system. The trams were decommissioned in 1935.\nWarrington power station became a selected station in the North West England and North Wales Electricity Scheme. It was part of one of three national grid rings in the northwest. Other stations on the Warrington ring were Ribble (Preston), Southport, Lister Drive (Liverpool) and Westwood (Wigan).\nNew plant was installed and the output of the power station was uprated in 1940, 1944, 1946 and 1952.\nThe British electricity supply industry was nationalised in 1948 under the provisions of the Electricity Act 1947 (10 & 11 Geo. 6. c. 54). The Warrington electricity undertaking was abolished, ownership of Warrington power station was vested in the British Electricity Authority, and subsequently the Central Electricity Authority and the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB). At the same time the electricity distribution and sales responsibilities of the Warrington electricity undertaking were transferred to the North Western Electricity Board (NORWEB).\nWarrington power station was closed on 29 October 1979.\nEquipment specification\nBy 1923 the plant comprised boilers delivering 193,000&nbsp;lb/h (24.3&nbsp;kg/s) of steam to:\n* 1 × 1,000&nbsp;kW steam turbo-alternator AC\n* 1 × 2,000&nbsp;kW steam turbo-alternator AC\n* 1 × 3,000&nbsp;kW steam turbo-alternator AC\n* 2 × 250&nbsp;kW reciprocating engines with DC generator\n* 1 × 500&nbsp;kW reciprocating engine with DC generator\n* 1 × 750&nbsp;kW reciprocating engine with DC generator\nThese machines gave a total generating capacity of 7,750&nbsp;kW comprising 6,000&nbsp;kW of alternating current (AC) plus 1,750&nbsp;kW of direct current (DC).\nThe following electricity supplies were available to consumers:\n* 440 & 380 Volts, 3-phase, 50&nbsp;Hz AC\n* 250 & 220 Volts, 3-phase, 50&nbsp;Hz AC\n* 460 & 230 Volts DC\nPlant in 1940–52\nIn 1940 the old plant had a capacity of 12 MW; new plant with a generating capacity of 20 MW was installed. This was followed by extensions of 20 MW (1944), 20 MW (1946) and 30 MW (1952). The old plant was decommissioned in March 1949.\nBy 1954 the plant comprised:\n* Boilers:\n** 5 × Simon Carves 200,000&nbsp;lb/h (25.2&nbsp;kg/s) boilers, steam conditions were 425 psi and 825&nbsp;°F (29.3 bar and 441&nbsp;°C), steam was supplied to:\n* Generators:\n** 3 × 20 MW English Electric turbo-alternator (commissioned 1940, 1944 and 1946)\n** 1 × 30 MW Brush Ljungstrom (commissioned December 1952)\nThe total generating capacity was 90 MW at 6.6 kV.\nCondenser cooling water was drawn from the adjacent River Mersey.\nOperations\nOperating data 1921–23\nThe electricity supply data for the period 1921–23 was:\nWarrington power station supply data 1921–23\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Electricity  Use\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Units\n! colspan=\"3\" |Year\n|-\n!1921\n!1922\n!1923\n|-\n|Lighting  and domestic\n|MWh\n|730\n|858\n|1,055\n|-\n|Public  lighting\n|MWh\n|73\n|86\n|86\n|-\n|Traction\n|MWh\n|656\n|632\n|624\n|-\n|Power\n|MWh\n|8,877\n|7,075\n|10,232\n|-\n|Bulk  supply\n|MWh\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|-\n|Total  use\n|MWh\n|10,337\n|8,652\n|12,048\n|}\nElectricity Loads on the system were:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Year\n|1921\n|1922\n|1923\n|-\n!Maximum  load\n!kW\n|5,365\n|5,413\n|5,870\n|-\n!Total  connections\n!kW\n|11,538\n|12,247\n|13,227\n|-\n!Load  factor\n!Per  cent\n|27.0\n|22.6\n|28.4\n|}\nRevenue from the sale of current (in 1923) was £92,474; the surplus of revenue over expenses was £51,584.\nOperating data 1946\nIn 1946 Warrington power station supplied 161,474 MWh of electricity; the maximum output load was 60,258&nbsp;kW.
