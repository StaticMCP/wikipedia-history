Organised by Matchroom Sport, the event featured 128 players and was played as three rounds of roundrobin groups of four, before a bestoffive final. It was the fifth edition of the ranking version of the Championship League, and the first ranking tournament of the 202425 season.\nShaun Murphy was the defending champion, having defeated Mark Williams 30 in the final of the previous ranking edition of the tournament,}} but he was knocked out in Stage 2.\nAli Carter won his sixth ranking title, defeating Jackson Page 31 in the final. There were 95 century breaks made during the tournament, the highest being a 142 made by Wu Yize.\nFormat\nThe competition began with 32 rounds of group matches with each group consisting of four players. Two groups were played to a finish every day using a twotable setup in the arena. The groups were contested using a roundrobin format, with six matches played in each group. All matches in group play were played as bestoffour , with three points awarded for a win and one point for a draw. Group positions were determined by points scored, frame difference and then headtohead results between players who were tied. Places that were still tied were then determined by the highest  made in the group. If the highest break was also tied, the next highest break made by the players was used.\nThe 32 players that topped the group tables qualified for the group winners' stage, consisting of eight groups of four players. The eight winners from the group winners' stage qualified for the two final groups, with the final taking place later on the same day.}}\nParticipants\nA number of top ranked players opted to miss the event, including world number one Mark Allen.
