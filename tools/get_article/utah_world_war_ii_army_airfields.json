However the other USAAF support commands (including Air Technical Service Command (ATSC)) commanded airfields in support roles.\nIn addition to AAF airfields, Dugway Army Air Field was established at Dugway Proving Ground, which had been established by the Chemical Warfare Service to test chemical attacks and defences. It is now Michael Army Airfield.\nMany of the airfields were converted into municipal airports, some were returned to agriculture and several were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.\nMajor Airfields\nAir Technical Service Command\n* Hill Field, Clearfield\n: Ogden Air Depot, 12 January 1939-3 January 1955\n: 482nd Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron, 2 January 1943-1 April 1944\n: 4135th Army Air Force Base Unit, 1 April 1944-28 August 1948\n: Now Hill Air Force Base\n:: Hinckley Field, Ogden\n:: Sub-base of Hill AAF\n:: Now: Ogden-Hinckley Airport\nArmy Air Forces Training Command\n* Kearns Army Air Base\n: Army Air Forces Replacement Training Center/Army Air Forces Basic Training Center No.5, 1 May 1942-30 September 1943\n: Army Air Forces Overseas Replacement Depot, 20 July 1942-30 April 1944\n: Assigned to Second Air Force, 1 October 1943\n: 363rd Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron, 1 October 1943-24 March 1944\n: Operational airfield of Kearns Army Air Base (AAFTC)\n: Now South Valley Regional Airport\n* Salt Lake City AAB/APT, Salt Lake City, Utah\n: Joint Use USAAF/Civil Airport as freight terminal\n: Now: Salt Lake City International Airport\n* Wendover Field, Wendover, Utah\n: Was: Wendover Air Force Base (1947-1965)\n: Now: Wendover Airport\n:: Auxiliary fields: (Delle AF Aux , Knolls CAA , Low Flight Strip)\n::: Note: Delle was reported to have had an \"asterisk\" type layout, runways under 2000' in length.
