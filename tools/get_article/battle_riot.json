      "text": "# Battle Riot\n\nBattle Riot is an annual professional wrestling event produced by Major League Wrestling (MLW). The inaugural event took place on July 19, 2018.\nThe event is named after the Battle Riot match, a multi-competitor match type in which wrestlers are eliminated until one is left and declared winner. The match begins with two participants in the ring. Another fighter then enters every minute until 40 wrestlers have joined the match. Competitors are eliminated by either pin, submission, or going over the top rope and having both feet touch the venue floor. The declared winner of the Battle Riot match receives a future title shot for the MLW World Heavyweight Championship.\nThe first two, and fourth, events served as television tapings for MLW Fusion. The first and second events were broadcast as special episodes of Fusion, with the second event airing live on Bein Sports USA.\nThe third, fourth, and sixth events have been presented as standalone specials, equivalent to a pay-per-view; with matches from the third event also being taped for the MLW Fusion: Alpha miniseries. The fifth event was a television taping for MLW Underground Wrestling on Reelz, and aired as a special episode on April 25, 2023; it would be the show's penultimate episode before its cancellation. A \"Special Edition\" of the telecast was streamed on May 18 for FITE+ subscribers as part of MLW's partnership with the streamer.\nDates, venues and winners\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 0 auto\"\n|style=\"background:#FBB; width:2em\"|\n|Aired Live\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!#\n!Event\n!Date\n!City\n!Venue\n!Main event\n!Winner\n!Entry No.\n|-\n|1||Battle Riot I||July 19, 2018||rowspan=\"2\"|Queens, New York||rowspan=\"2\"|Melrose Ballroom||40-man Battle Riot match||Tom Lawlor||5\n|- style=\"background: #FBB;\"\n|2||Battle Riot II||April 5, 2019||40-man Battle Riot match||LA Park||29\n|-\n|3||Battle Riot III||July 10, 2021||Philadelphia, Pennsylvania||2300 Arena||41-man Battle Riot match||Alexander Hammerstone||35\n|-\n|4||Battle Riot IV||June 23, 2022||Queens, New York||Melrose Ballroom||40-man Battle Riot match||Jacob Fatu||28\n|-\n|5||Battle Riot V||April 8, 2023||Philadelphia, Pennsylvania||2300 Arena||40-man Battle Riot match||Alex Kane||1\n|- style=\"background: #FBB;\"\n|6||Battle Riot VI||June 1, 2024||Atlanta, Georgia||Center Stage||40-man Battle Riot match||Matt Riddle||31\n|- style=\"background: #FBB;\"\n|7||Battle Riot VII||April 5, 2025||Long Beach, California||Thunder Studios Arena||40-man Battle Riot match for the MLW World Heavyweight Championship||Matt Riddle||25\n|-\n|8||Battle Riot VIII||January 29, 2026||Kissimmee, Florida||Osceola Heritage Park||TBD||TBA||TBD\n|}\nChampionship match for winner\n: – Championship victory\n: – Championship match loss\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+\n!\n!Winner\n!Event\n!Year\n!Championship match\n|-style=\"background:#c3fdb8;\"\n|\n|!scope=\"row\"|Tom Lawlor\n|SuperFight\n|2018\n|Lawlor defeated Low Ki for the MLW World Heavyweight Championship.\n|-style=\"background:#fbb;\"\n|\n|!scope=\"row\"|L.
