Elections were held the first Tuesday after November 1 and terms began in Dover on the first Tuesday in January. This date was January 1, 1875, which was two weeks before the beginning of the first administrative year of Governor John P. Cochran.\nCurrently the distribution of the Senate Assembly seats was made to three senators for each of the three counties. Likewise the current distribution of the House Assembly seats was made to seven representatives for each of the three counties. The actual population changes of the county did not directly affect the number of senators or representatives at this time.\nIn the 78th Delaware General Assembly session both chambers had a Democratic majority.\nLeadership\nSenate\n* Charles C.
