General Chun Doo-hwan was the only candidate, and was elected unopposed.\nChoi was to serve for the remainder of the 1978–1984 term of longtime president Park Chung-hee, who had died in 1979 and been replaced by him. However, Chun subsequently decided to stage a coup and end the Fourth Republic and draft a new constitution, which was promulgated in October 1980 after being approved in a referendum. The first presidential election under the new constitution was held in February 1981, and Chun was elected by an overwhelming majority under controversial circumstances.\nBackground\nAfter the assassination of the military dictator President Park Chung-hee in October 1979, Prime Minister Choi Kyu-hah was elected president in the December 1979 elections. However, General Chun Doo-hwan staged the Coup d'état of December Twelfth and effectively took control of the government, making President Choi a figurehead. However, on 16 August 1980, following the Coup d'état of May Seventeenth, Chun removed Choi from office so he could become president himself.\nResults\nIn order to be elected, a candidate had to receive the vote of over 50% of the incumbent members of the National Conference for Unification. With 2,540 delegates present, Chun had to receive at least 1,271 votes to be elected. He received 2,524 votes, 99.37% of the total possible.\nElectors by province and city\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n!Province/City\n! style=\"width:60px; \" |Electors\n! style=\"width:60px; \" |Vacant\n! style=\"width:60px; \" |Total\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Seoul\n|388\n|3\n|391\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Busan\n|145\n|0\n|145\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Gyeonggi\n|315\n|4\n|319\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Gangwon\n|148\n|3\n|151\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |North Chungcheong\n|129\n|2\n|131\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |South Chungcheong\n|229\n|6\n|235\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |North Jeolla\n|202\n|1\n|203\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |South Jeolla\n|308\n|4\n|312\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |North Gyeongsang\n|367\n|12\n|379\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |South Gyeongsang\n|282\n|8\n|290\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Jeju\n|27\n|0\n|27\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n| align=\"left\" |Total\n|2,540\n|43\n|2,583\n|}\nReferences"
