When Ingeborg's brother King Erik Eriksson died in 1250, though a child, Valdemar was elected king and crowned the following year in the cathedral at Linköping. During the first sixteen years of Valdemar's reign, it was Birger Jarl who was the real ruler. Birger Jarl had been the de facto ruler of Sweden from 1248, before the reign of Valdemar, even under King Erik Eriksson. Valdemar's mother and King Erik Eriksson were children of King Erik Knutsson and Rikissa of Denmark.\nAfter Birger's death in 1266 Valdemar eventually came into conflict with his younger brother Magnus Birgersson (later known as Magnus Ladulås), Duke of Södermanland, over taxation and personal matters.\nIn 1260, Valdemar married Sophia, the eldest daughter of King Eric IV of Denmark and Jutta of Saxony. Valdemar also had a relationship with his sister-in-law Jutta. In 1272, Princess Jutta visited Sweden and became Valdemar's mistress. The affair resulted in a child born in 1273. The following year, Jutta was placed in a convent and Valdemar was forced to make a pilgrimage to Rome to ask for the absolution of the Pope.\nValdemar was deposed by his brother Magnus after the Battle of Hova in Tiveden on 14 June 1275. Magnus was supported by his brother Eric Birgersson, Duke of Småland, and King Eric V of Denmark, who provided Danish soldiers. Magnus was elected King of Sweden at the Stones of Mora.\nIn 1277, Sophia separated from her spouse and returned to Denmark. That year, Valdemar managed to regain provinces in Götaland in the southern part of the kingdom and was called the Duke of Götaland. However, Magnus regained them about 1278. In 1288 Valdemar was imprisoned by King Magnus in Nyköping Castle (Nyköpingshus) and lived openly with mistresses, possibly new wives, in comfortable confinement.\nFamily\nValdemar married Sofia of Denmark (died 1286) in 1260 and they separated in 1277. After their separation, Valdemar is said to have married multiple times. He had six children:\n# Ingeborg, Countess of Holstein; spouse of Gerhard II, Count of Holstein-Plön.\n# Erik (12721330), riksråd of Sweden and Norway\n# Marina (); spouse of Rudolf II, Lord of Diepholz (married 1285)\n# Rikissa (; died c. 1292); spouse of Przemysł II of Poland\n# Katarina (died 1283)\n# Margareta, abbess at Skänninge convent.\nFootnotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n* 1499 |date=2007 |publisher=Natur och kultur |isbn=978-91-27-02631-5 |publication-place=Stockholm |language=sv}}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
