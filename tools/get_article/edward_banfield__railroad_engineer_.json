He was the first General Manager of the British-owned Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway between 1865 and 1872, founded in Argentina by Edward Lund in 1862. Banfield died in 1872, and the Southern Railway named the actual train station in his honour in 1873. The town of Banfield in Buenos Aires Province, which grew up till becoming a city, inherited that name. The professional Argentine football club Club Atlético Banfield with headquarters there, also carries his name.\nIn 1872, he felt ill, and ended as General Manager, returning to London with his wife Jane, and their daughter, Elizabeth, born in 1871 in Argentina. He died in London that same year and his daughter on 5 February 1874, age 2. They are buried, along with his wife, in St. Erth, Cornwall, in the old churchyard by St. Erth Church in a family chest tomb.\nSee also\n*Rail transport in Argentina\nReferences\n*H.R.Stones, British Railways in Argentina 1860-1948, P.E.Waters & Associates, Bromley, London, England, 1993."
