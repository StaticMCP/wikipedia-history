      "text": "# Kingkel languages\n\nKingkel is a putative small branch of the Pama–Nyungan family in Queensland, consisting of:\n*Bayali\n*Dharumbal.\nThe two languages are not close.\nBowern (2011) reclassified Darumbal as a Maric language, but did not address Bayali. Bouckaert, Bower, and Atkinson (2018), based on more data and languages of the region, classify Darumbal as a sister of Mbabaram (and therefore related to Maric languages, though as the first to branch off within that group). Bayali is grouped with the Waka-Kabi languages to the south.\n]]\nReferences"
