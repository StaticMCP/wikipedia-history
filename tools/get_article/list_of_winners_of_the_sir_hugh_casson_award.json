The name ironically honours British architect Sir Hugh Casson. Column author Gavin Stamp (who wrote under the pseudonym \"Piloti\") explained in 2015 that \"he [Casson] would turn up – take a fee – for giving evidence at public inquiries to recommend the demolition of buildings: a trade I despise\". Stamp noted that Casson would sometimes mention his office as Vice-Chairman of The Victorian Society when arguing for the demolition of Victorian buildings. The medal of the award uses a sketch of Casson which is a self-portrait.\nFollowing Stamp's death in December 2017, although the \"Nooks and Corners\" column continued under a new author, the Sir Hugh Casson Award was discontinued.\nWinners\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year !!Building !!City !!Architect !!Comment !!Reference\n|-\n|1982 ||Ismaili Centre ||London || Casson, Conder and Partners || \"lumpishness, banality, repetitiveness and repulsiveness of texture\" || Eye 549 p.&nbsp;7\n|-\n|1983 ||Fire Station, Shaftesbury Avenue || London || Richard Seifert and Partners || \"It is tawdry fancy-dress architecture, without life or imagination\" || Eye 575 p.&nbsp;7\n|-\n|1984 ||Renault Centre || Swindon || Foster and Associates || \"You can tell the Renault Centre is a whizzy High-Tech building because it is painted bright yellow\" || Eye 602 p.&nbsp;9\n|-\n|1985 ||Lloyd's building || London || Richard Rogers and Partners || \"a great glazed grey warehouse ... how astonishingly naive it is as architecture\" || Eye 627 p.&nbsp;7\n|-\n|1986 ||Clore Gallery, Tate Britain || London || James Stirling || \"a vast hole-in-the-wall entrance, a gratuitous neo-Constructivist unsupported corner\" || Eye 653 p.&nbsp;9\n|-\n|1987 ||Police Station at Buckingham Palace || London || Property Services Agency || \"ugly, obtrusive, insensitive, banal\" || Eye 679 p.&nbsp;7\n|-\n|1988 ||Skylines Village, Isle of Dogs || London || Maxwell Hutchinson || \"a 45-degree triangle on its side ... hyped-up mediocrity\" || Eye 706 p.&nbsp;9\n|-\n|1989 ||The Mound || Edinburgh || Allies and Morrison || \"a series of pointless, pretentious structures\" || Eye 733 p.&nbsp;9\n|-\n|1990 ||Concert Hall || Glasgow || Sir Leslie Martin || \"a building which looks as if it was designed in 1950 in, say, Bulgaria\" || Eye 757 p.&nbsp;9\n|-\n|1991 ||Sainsbury Wing, National Gallery || London || Robert Venturi || \"the elaborate and expensive camp joke\" || Eye 784 p.&nbsp;9\n|-\n|1992 ||United Kingdom pavilion, Expo '92 || Seville || Nicholas Grimshaw || \"a showy, pretentious exterior with nothing behind it\" || Eye 810 p.&nbsp;11\n|-\n|1993 ||Maitland Robinson Library, Downing College || Cambridge || Quinlan Terry || \"a gauche and vulgar essay in misunderstood Greek Classicism\" || Eye 836 p.&nbsp;7\n|-\n|1994 ||Principal's Lodgings, Harris Manchester College || Oxford || Peter Yiangou || \"illiterate red-brick neo-Georgian\" || Eye 862 p.&nbsp;9\n|-\n|1995 ||Faculty of Law || Cambridge || Foster and Partners || \"a long extruded half-cylinder of glass and stainless steel\" || Eye 888 p.&nbsp;7\n|-\n|1996 ||House for an Art Lover || Glasgow || Charles Rennie Mackintosh || \"[an] unreal design by [a] long dead architect\" || Eye 914 p.&nbsp;12\n|-\n|1997 ||Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre || Glasgow || Foster and Partners || \"a triumphant betrayal of all that modern architecture was meant to stand for\" || Eye 940 p.&nbsp;9\n|-\n|1998 ||Buchanan Galleries || Glasgow || Legge Ericsson, Jenkins and Marr || \"a triumph of barbarism, vulgarity, ineptitude\" || Eye 967 p.&nbsp;9\n|-\n|1999 ||Millennium Dome || London || Richard Rogers and Partners || \"a huge circular plastic tent ...
