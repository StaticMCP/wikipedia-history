For simplicity British Guiana is used in the article.\nThe tournament was restricted to Amateurs. This excluded many of the leading black cricketers who were often Professionals.\nOrigins\nA tournament between Barbados, British Guiana and Trinidad took place in 1891. Each team played the other, and then there was a final between the leading two teams. During this tournament a suggestion was made by Hon. Aucher Warner that there should be a regular series of matches between the three colonies to be played alternately at each colony.\nBy the time of the next tournament in 1893, a cup had been subscribed for but British Guiana were unable to take part, Barbados being winners again. This 1893 match is regarded as the first proper tournament.\nBarbados as winners of the 1893 tournament were automatic finalists for the 1895 tournament, the other two teams playing to decide who would play them. The same procedure was used in the subsequent tournaments.\nDue to travel costs and logistics of travelling to the other colonies, Jamaica never took part in the Inter-Colonial Tournament.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Series !! rowspan=2 | Dates !! rowspan=2 | Season !! colspan=2 | Finalists !! rowspan = 2 | Hosts !! rowspan=2 | Venue\n|-\n!
