They are:\n*''1. \"Shakespeare's Kingdom\"\n*2. \"The Islands (A Song of New Zealand)\"\n*3. \"The Blue Mountains (A Song of Australia)\"\n*4. \"The Heart of Canada\"\n*5. \"Sailing Westward\"\n*6. \"Merchant Adventurers\"\n*7. \"The Immortal Legions\"\n*8. \"A Song of Union\"\nNos. 1 - 7 are for solo singer with accompaniment.\nNo. 2 \"The Islands\", No. 5 \"Sailing Westward\", and three other poems by Noyes: \"Indian Dawn\", \"The Cape of Good Hope\" (for South Africa) and \"Gloriana\" (Queen Elizabeth I) were also arranged for chorus SATB and have the same musical accompaniment.\nNo. 7 \"The Immortal Legions\" was also arranged for chorus SATB.\nNo. 8 \"A Song of Union\"'' is a part-song for chorus SATB written for but not actually performed in the Pageant.\nThree movements from Elgar's \"The Crown of India\" were included in the Pageant, representing \"The Early Days of India\": the Introduction, the March of the Mogul Emperors and the Crown of India March.\nElgar composed his Empire March for the same occasion, and it was at that time considered part of the Pageant of Empire.  However the Empire March was not performed then and Elgar's Imperial March took its place.\nThe orchestral scores and parts for all the songs with the exception of \"Immortal Legions\" and the \"March\" have been lost, but they have been orchestrated by conductor Martin Yates and recorded complete on Dutton Epoch by Baritone Roderick Williams with the BBC Concert Orchestra conducted by Martin Yates.\nRecordings\n* The CD with the book Oh, My Horses!
