Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States the primary, originally scheduled for March 17, 2020, was moved and voting by mail was designated as the sole voting form and extended until April 28, 2020, with April 27 being the final deadline for a ballot to have been received and postmarked by the post. Hand-dropping the mail-in ballot on April 28 was also possible.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2;margin-bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:0.2em 0.4em\" |2020 Ohio Republican primary\n!Candidate\n!Votes\n!%\n!Delegates\n|-\n|\n|713,546\n|100.00\n|82\n|-\n|- style=\"background-color:#F6F6F6\"\n!
