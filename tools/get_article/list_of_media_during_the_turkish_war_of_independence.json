The Turkish National Movement in Anatolia culminated in the formation of the Grand National Assembly (GNA; ) by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and his colleagues. After the end of the Turkish–Armenian, Franco-Turkish and Greco-Turkish fronts (often referred to as the Eastern Front, the Southern Front, and the Western Front of the war, respectively), the Treaty of Sèvres was abandoned and the Treaties of Kars (October 1921) and Lausanne (July 1923) were signed. The Allies left Anatolia and Eastern Thrace, and the Grand National Assembly of Turkey (which remains Turkey's primary legislative body today) declared the Republic of Turkey on 29 October 1923.\nDuring this period, an important amount of newspapers and magazines published in region supported the Turkish National Movement. Initially, because of the occupation of city, the mass media in Istanbul was unable to write subjects such as Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, Kuva-yi Milliye, War of Independence and Grand National Assembly of Turkey. Some newspapers even openly supported the occupation by trying to convince the people to not resist. There were also many newspapers and magazines owned by minorities who mostly supported a mandate rule over Anatolia and named Kuva-yi Milliye \"irresponsible gangs\".\nList\nMedia that was in support of the Turkish National Movement\nConstantinople\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! align=\"left\" |Name\n! align=\"left\" |Center\n! align=\"left\" |Type\n! align=\"left\" |Frequency\n! align=\"left\" |Notes\n|-\n|Ahvâl\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Irregular\n|\n|-\n|Akbaba\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Twice per week\n|\n|-\n|Akşam\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Daily\n|Formed by Necmettin Sadak and Ali Naci\n|-\n|Alay\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Weekly\n|Formed by Ercüment Ekrem Talu and Aka Gündüz\n|-\n|Asildar\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Daily\n|\n|-\n|Asker Hocası\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Biweekly\n|\n|-\n|Aydede\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Weekly\n|\n|-\n|Âyine\n|Constantinople\n|Magazine\n|\n|\n|-\n|Aydınlık\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Weekly\n|\n|-\n|Beşer ve Tabiat\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Weekly\n|\n|-\n|Bugün\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Monthly\n|\n|-\n|Büyük Mecmua\n|Constantinople\n|Magazine\n|Biweekly\n|\n|-\n|Cadı\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Twice per week\n|\n|-\n|Ceride-i Havadis\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Daily\n|\n|-\n|Ceride-i Şikâyât\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Weekly\n|\n|-\n|Dergâh\n|Constantinople\n|Magazine\n|Biweekly\n|\n|-\n|Dersaadet\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Daily\n|\n|-\n|Diken\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Weekly\n|\n|-\n|Edebî Mecmua\n|Constantinople\n|Magazine\n|Weekly\n|\n|-\n|Efkâr-ı Umumiye\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Biweekly\n|\n|-\n|Fırtına\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Weekly\n|\n|-\n|Güleryüz\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Weekly\n|Launched by Sedat Simavi\n|-\n|Habl-i Metin\n|Constantinople\n|Magazine\n|Weekly|\n|-\n|Hâdisât\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Daily\n|\n|-\n|Halk Sadâsı\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Daily\n|\n|-\n|Hukuk-ı Beşer\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Daily\n|\n|-\n|İdrâk\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Daily\n|\n|-\n|İfhâm\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Daily\n|\n|-\n|İkdam\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Everyday\n|Established by Yakup Kadri Karaosmanoğlu, Hüseyin Cahit (Yalçın) and Hüseyin Rahmi\n|-\n|İleri\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Daily\n|Established by Celal Nuri İleri\n|-\n|İstiklâl\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Irregular\n|\n|-\n|Karagöz\n|Constantinople\n|Magazine\n|Biweekly\n|It published 4785 issues between the Second Constitutional Era and 1955 and supported the Turkish National Movement.\n|-\n|Memleket\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Daily\n|\n|-\n|Millî Mecmua\n|Constantinople\n|Magazine\n|Biweekly\n|\n|-\n|Minber\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Daily\n|\n|-\n|Müşterek Newspaper\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Daily\n|\n|-\n|Resimli Newspaper\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Weekly\n|\n|-\n|Sebilürreşad\n|Istanbul-Kayseri-Ankara\n|Constantinople\n|Irregular\n|Established by Mehmet Akif (Ersoy)\n|-\n|Servet-i Fünun\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper-Magazine\n|Weekly\n|\n|-\n|Tanin\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Daily\n|Formed by Hüseyin Cahit\n|-\n|Tercüman-ı Hakikat\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Everyday\n|\n|-\n|Tevhid-i Efkâr (Tasvîr-i Efkâr)\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Daily\n|\n|-\n|Türk Dünyası\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Weekly\n|\n|-\n|Vakit\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Daily\n|Established by Ahmet Emin Yalman and Mehmet Asım Us\n|-\n|Vatan\n|Constantinople\n|Newspaper\n|Daily\n|\n|-\n|Yarın\n|Constantinople\n|Magazine\n|Weekly\n|\n|-\n|Yeni Mecmua\n|Constantinople\n|Magazine\n|Weekly\n|\n|}\nAnatolia\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! align=\"left\" |Name\n! align=\"left\" |Center\n! align=\"left\" |Type\n! align=\"left\" |Frequency\n! align=\"left\" |Notes\n|-\n|Ferda\n|Adana\n|Newspaper\n|Twice every week\n|\n|-\n|Hayat\n|Adana\n|Newspaper\n|Thrice every week\n|\n|-\n|Millî Mefkure\n|Adana\n|Magazine\n|Once every 15 days\n|\n|-\n|Tok Söz\n|Adana\n|Newspaper\n|Everyday\n|\n|-\n|Adapazarı\n|Adapazarı\n|Newspaper\n|Once every week\n|\n|-\n|Afyon'da Nur\n|Afyonkarahisar\n|Magazine\n|Once every month\n|\n|-\n|İkâz\n|Afyonkarahisar\n|Newspaper\n|Everyday\n|\n|-\n|Söz Birliği\n|Afyonkarahisar\n|Newspaper\n|Irregular\n|\n|-\n|Amasya'da Emel\n|Amasya\n|Newspaper\n|Once every week\n|\n|-\n|Ana Türk Yurdu\n|Ankara\n|Magazine\n|Once every 15 days\n|\n|-\n|Anadolu Duygusu\n|Ankara\n|Magazine\n|Once every 15 days\n|\n|-\n|Anadolu Terbiye Mecmuası\n|Ankara\n|Magazine\n|Once every month\n|\n|-\n|Anadolu'da Peyâm-ı Sabah\n|Ankara\n|Newspaper\n|Once every week\n|\n|-\n|Anadolu'da Yeni Gün\n|Ankara\n|Newspaper\n|Everyday\n|It was later renamed to Cumhuriyet\n|-\n|Anavatan Mecmuası\n|Ankara\n|Magazine\n|Once every 15 days\n|\n|-\n|Bozkurt\n|Ankara\n|Magazine\n|Once every week\n|\n|-\n|Hakimiyet-i Milliye\n|Ankara\n|Newspaper\n|Everyday\n|Established by Atatürk in 1920.
