Two councilmen would be elected from each ward each year.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|John H. Flynn\n|1874\n|Julius C. Watkins\n|-\n|1875\n|John S. Garmany\n|}\nIn late 1875, an ordinance passed where each year one councilman would be elected from each ward for a two-year term. The first year, 1876 just had one citywide alderman and a single councilman from each ward and they would be fully staffed two years later.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Even year elections\n!Year\n!Odd year elections\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Dr. Samuel Hape\n|1876\n|none\n|-\n|1877\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Charles K.

The Fourth lost the entire Peachtree St corridor leaving a district of working class citizens: Germans and Jews to the north and Blacks to the south. Before 1910, the ward had become almost exclusively Black centered on Sweet Auburn and a large portion of it was destroyed in the Great Atlanta fire of 1917.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Even year elections\n!Year\n!Odd year elections\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|William H.
