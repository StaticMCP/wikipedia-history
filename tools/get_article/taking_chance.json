Kevin Bacon's portrayal won him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie, among others.\nTaking Chance premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 16, 2009, and aired on HBO in the United States on February 21, 2009. The film received generally favorable reviews from critics. At the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards, it earned ten nominations, such as Outstanding Television Movie and Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or Movie for Bacon, and won one for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Miniseries or a Movie.\nPlot\nThe movie is based on the recollections of U.S. Marine Lt. Col Michael Strobl, a real person, who accompanied the remains of Lance Corporal Chance Phelps, a Marine fatally wounded by gunfire near Baghdad during the Iraq War, from Dover Air Force Base to Dubois, Wyoming in April 2004. He attended both Phelps's funeral and his memorial service, and wrote an essay about the entire experience, the emotions he felt and the people he met. It was published in the blog Blackfive on 23 April 2004 and was circulated widely on the Internet.\nCast\n* Kevin Bacon as Lieutenant Colonel Michael Strobl\n* Nicholas Reese Art as Nate Strobl\n* Blanche Baker as Chris Phelps\n* Tom Bloom as Navy Chaplain\n* Guy Boyd as Gary Hargrove\n* James Castanien as Robert Orndoff\n* Gordon Clapp as Tom Garrett\n* Mike Colter as Master Gunnery Sergeant Demetry\n* Henry Coy as Marine Driver\n* Joel de la Fuente as Ticketing Agent\n* Liza Colón-Zayás as Ticketing Agent\n* Ann Dowd as Gretchen\n* Tate Ellington as A.V.

On Metacritic it has a score of 76 out of 100 based on 16 reviews. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 57% rating based on reviews from 7 critics.\nOne review from The Baltimore Sun, said that it \"... is one of the most eloquent and socially conscious films the premium cable channel has ever presented,\"  and USA Today, said \"A small, almost perfectly realized gem of a movie, Taking Chance is also precisely the kind of movie that TV should be making.\" On the other end is Slant Magazine, saying \"Instead of well-drawn characters or real human drama, we are presented with a military procedural on burial traditions. The film desperately wants the viewer to shed tears for its fallen hero without giving a single dramatic reason to do so.\"\nThe film was the most-watched HBO original in five years, with over two million viewers on the opening night, and more than 5.5 million on re-airings. Critics often attribute this success to its apolitical nature, not directly depicting nor offering an opinion of the Iraq War.\nFormer Secretary of Defense Robert Gates wrote in his 2014 memoir Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War that the film had an \"important impact\" on his decision to allow the media access to the transfer of fallen service members at Dover Air Force Base in February 2009. During a White House press conference in 2017, former White House Chief of Staff and Retired Marine Corps General John F. Kelly, who was next to Chance when he was killed and is the father of First Lieutenant Robert Kelly who was killed in action in Afghanistan, recommended that the Washington press corps watch the film in order to understand the solemnity and dignity of the process of returning fallen military service members to their families.\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
