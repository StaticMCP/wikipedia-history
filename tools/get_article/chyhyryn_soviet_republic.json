The Ataman dispersed the administration of the existing directorate in the city and declared the creation of an independent state, the \"Chyhyryn Soviet Republic\". The head of the republic, and all the rebel forces, was Kotsur.\nKotsur began his rule with class terror. On his orders the bourgeois and government officials were shot. 60 suspicious persons were also arrested in Chyhyryn. Kotsur's detachments carried out punitive actions against kulak villages and landowners' estates as well as arranging contributions, and confiscations, of food for the needs of the revolution.\nDue to the robberies of Kotsur's detachments in March 1919, the residents of the villages of Ositnyazhka and Tsybuliv rebelled against the authority of the ataman.\nGovernance\nThe main form of government in the republic were free city and village councils. In some settlements, revolutionary committees were created but they did not have real power.\nTerritory\nAt the time of the proclamation of the republic, the rebels controlled the territory of Chyhyryn - Kamianka - Subbotov - Yanichi - Novosel'tsy - Ivanovka and several surrounding farms.\nSee also\n* Aftermath of World War I\n* Rat (council)\nFurther reading\n* Savchenko V.
