This culture permeates various sectors, including public services, law enforcement, and political institutions. It has been a subject of criticism for perpetuating elitism, inequality, and systemic corruption.\nBackground\nThe roots of VIP culture in Pakistan can be traced back to the colonial era, where a hierarchical system was established, favoring the elite. Post-independence, this system persisted, with political leaders, bureaucrats, and military officials often receiving special privileges.\nThe legacy of feudalism and centralized power structures has perpetuated a hierarchy where state resources are treated as private entitlements for the elite.\nManifestations of VIP culture\nTraffic disruptions\nVIP movements frequently lead to road blockades, causing significant inconvenience to the public. For instance, in December 2015, a 10-month-old girl died in Karachi after her father was denied entry to a hospital due to security protocols for a political leader's visit.\nPreferential treatment in public services\nIn public hospitals, VIP patients often receive immediate attention, while ordinary citizens face long waits. A protest by young doctors in Lahore in 2017 highlighted this issue, demanding an end to the preferential treatment of VIPs in government hospitals.\nGovernance and politics\nPoliticians and high-ranking officials frequently benefit from state resources, security details, and other privileges unrelated to their official duties. These perks are often justified under the guise of protocol or national importance, despite being misused for personal convenience.\nSecurity protocols\nHigh-profile individuals are accompanied by armed security personnel, often traveling in luxury vehicles. The trend of using SUVs such as Toyota Land Cruiser Prado and Vigo Champ for VIP security has grown due to increasing security concerns.\nAirport protocols\nVIPs often bypass standard procedures at airports, receiving expedited services. In 2018, the Pakistani government announced a ban on VIP protocols at airports to curb this practice.\nPublic criticism and protests\nPublic frustration over VIP culture has led to numerous protests. In October 2014, citizens in Karachi protested against the disruptive effects of VIP movements on daily life.\nThe excessive focus on providing VIP protection sometimes diverts critical resources from broader security needs, potentially endangering public safety.\nGovernment measures and reforms\nVarious administrations have pledged to dismantle VIP culture. In 2015, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government announced that no VIP would be allowed to disrupt traffic flow. Similarly, in 2024, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government banned free accommodation for VIPs in government rest houses, aiming to ensure equitable access for all citizens.\nSee also\n* Corruption in Pakistan\nReferences"
