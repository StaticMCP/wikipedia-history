An insurgent unit under Zygmunt Jordan clashed with a detachment of the Imperial Russian Army. The battle ended in Russian victory.\nOn 20 June 1863 insurgent unit of Zygmunt Jordan crossed the Vistula, the river which marked the border between Galicia (Austrian Partition of Poland) and Congress Poland (Russian Partition). Polish insurgents were divided into two columns. One was attacked by Russian infantry near the village of Gace. Several Poles died, and the survivors retreated to Galicia.\nSecond column (350 infantry and 50 cavalry) clashed with Russians in the folwark of Komorów. Since the detachment of the Imperial Russian Army was much stronger and better equipped than the insurgents, Polish forces were pushed back towards the Vistula, and then to Galicia. The battle was terminated due to a thunderstorm.\nAll together, some 200 rebels were killed; some by the Russians, others drowned in the Vistula. 72 rebels were buried in a mass grave at a cemetery in Beszowa.\nSources\n* Stefan Kieniewicz: Powstanie styczniowe.
