Since 2018, categories included:\n• Best Single Article/Story\n• Best Profile\n• Best Commentary\n• John M. Higgins Award for Best In-Depth/Enterprise Reporting\nSpecial topic categories reflecting the major news stories of the previous year have also been added each year since 2018.\nJohn M. Higgins Award\nThe John M. Higgins Award for Best In-Depth/Enterprise Reporting was established by the Newhouse School in December 2011 to honor the late Broadcasting & Cable business editor, who died in 2006. The award is supported by a financial gift from Discovery Communications and Time Warner Cable and carries a $5,000 cash prize. Each of the remaining awards carries a $1,000 cash prize.\nNominations & Judging\nNominations for the Mirror Awards are made online each year beginning in December. The competition is open to anyone who conducts reporting, commentary or criticism of the media industries.
