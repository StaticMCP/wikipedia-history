Rediff.com's review concluded that \"Chella's directorial debut lacks originality and is a hotch potch of celebrated scripts of the past. Malini Mannath of Chennai Online wrote \"With an absurd script, insipid narration, and with neither the role nor the performance working out here for him, it's like Ajith has lost whatever ground he'd gained with his splendid performance in 'Varalaru'\". Lajjavathu of Kalki wrote this is director Chella's debut film. The screenplay could have been more intense. Since the stories of revenge have already been seen in many different ways in many films and it is not told in a new way in Aalwar, we could not able to connect with the film. Cinesouth wrote \"Ajith believes that he's god incarnate and vanquishes the bad guys with superhuman strength. It's not that spiritual as much as it's a downslide in the screenplay. Chella could have paid more attention to making the story and screenplay more compact and credible\". Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu wrote \"So what if Ajit is out of Bala's `Naan Kadavul'? In `Aazhwar' he dons the attire and apes the appearance of the Gods, claiming he is one, thus adding a touch of religiosity to his vengeance spree and also sending a message across. Thrill plays a solid part in the sequences where the hero is on the verge of getting nabbed by the police for his bloody actions. But much of `Aazhwar' is so very similar to what you have seen in cinema all along that it begins to appear clichéd\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
