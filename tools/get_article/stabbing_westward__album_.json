It is their first album to be produced by Ed Buller and released on Koch Records. The album was released on May 22, 2001. The album shows a change in direction for the band. The album's songs are much less heavy and aggressive, while the industrial focus has given way to a more melodic sound. Before the album was released, lead singer Christopher Hall said in an interview that Stabbing Westward wrote great pop-rock songs, but the band had always ended up making them ugly by adding effects and screaming, etc. On this album, he claimed, they decided to write what they wanted, regardless of fan expectation. \"The Only Thing\" is a love song for Christopher Hall's wife.\nThe album did well in Australia, but ultimately failed to sell worldwide.\nTrack listing\nThere is a US release that was a Best Buy exclusive. This package contains a bonus disk featuring previously unreleased acoustic versions of \"So Far Away\" and \"Wasted\". On the second disk, there is a misprint: it says \"Perfect\" instead of \"Wasted\". This two-disc set was only available at Best Buy stores in 2001 and only during the first week of its release.\nPersonnel\nStabbing Westward\n* Christopher Hall – vocals\n* Derrek Hawkins – guitar, acoustic guitar\n* Jim Sellers – bass, baritone guitar\n* Walter Flakus – keyboards, synthesizer, programming\n* Andy Kubiszewski – drums, vibraphone, marimba, synthesizer, acoustic guitar\nAdditional\n* Ed Buller – production, engineer\n* Kent Matcke – editing, engineer\n* Enrique Gonzales – editing, assistant engineer\n* Howie Weinberg – mastering\n* Tom Lord-Alge – mixing\n* Matthew Welch – photography\n* Paul McMenamin – art direction, design, artwork (CD package)\n* Scott Rivera – artwork (design assistance)\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Chart performance for Stabbing Westward\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2001)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (ARIA)\n| 97\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard 200\n| 47\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Independent Albums (Billboard)\n| 2\n|}\nReferences"
