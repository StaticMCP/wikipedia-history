The college is situated on three campuses in Warrnambool, located at the end of the Great Ocean Road in Victoria's Western District. The college is co-sponsored by the Sisters of Mercy who established St Ann's College in 1872 and the Congregation of Christian Brothers who founded St Joseph's Christian Brothers' College in 1902. Emmanuel College was the result of an amalgamation of the two colleges in 1991.\nGeography\nEmmanuel College is located in Warrnambool, approximately 256.7 kilometres west of Melbourne on the Southern Ocean. The Ardlie Street (McAuley) Campus is home to Year 7, 8 and 10 students and is on approximately  of land that incorporates Emmanuel's Agricultural Skills Centre and the Gothic Revival St Ann's Chapel (1888).\nHistory\nSt Ann's College\nThe Sisters of Mercy had purchased the property \"Wyton House\" and established their convent and \"A Day and Boarding School for Young Ladies\" by July 1872 on the present site of the Ardlie Street Campus. The dedication of their chapel in 1888 resulted in the school's name becoming St Ann's College. The college was offering to prepare students for matriculation by the late 19th century. The college's junior school (kindergarten to grade 6) had been phased out by 1975 and its boarding school had closed by 1978. From this point until its amalgamation in 1991, St Ann's was a day school, providing its girls with a years 7–12 curriculum.\nSt Ann's Day is celebrated annually in July in the grounds of Emmanuel College where  St Ann's Old Collegians celebrate  Mass in  the St Ann's Chapel followed by lunch. The Chapel  is adjacent to the small St Ann's Garden where a  marble statue of Saint Ann was donated by old collegians in 1958.   Sir Fletcher Jones donated the original garden.\nSt Joseph's Christian Brothers' College\nThe Christian Brothers opened a private day school for boys in 1902 on the corner of Jamieson Street and Banyon Street, Russells Creek, Warrnambool. 16 boys enrolled, \"ranging from grade 3\" – the level at which its junior school commenced – and up \"to matriculation\" (year 12). The school was known as both 'St Mary's High School' and 'The Monastery' in its early years. In 1911, the purchase of the Canterbury Road grounds, previously the Hohenlohe Ladies' College, saw the establishment of St Joseph's Christian Brothers' College. The new grounds were officially opened on January 12, 1912 in the presence of Archbishop Carr and the Premier, John Murray.  For many decades the school maintained its primary school, enrolling boys at grade 3. By 1987 \"the long tradition of combined primary and secondary education\" had drawn to a close and the college provided its boys with a years 7–12 curriculum.\nSt Ann's College and CBC amalgamated in 1991 to become the co-educational Emmanuel College.\nThe Wesley-CBC cricket team remained active as of 2019.\nHouse system\nEach house is named after a significant person in the college's history. Sporting competitions are held between them each year.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! House\n! Colour\n!
