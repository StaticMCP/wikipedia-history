The tunnel itself is  long although one source gives the length as  and the up portal is 278 miles 16 chains from London according to the mileposts. Situated just above the River Fowey, Brownqueen Tunnel is in the same area as \"Brownqueen Wood\", a small forested area of about .\nSouth of the tunnel, trains pass Restormel Castle, one of the four chief Norman castles of Cornwall. To the north of the tunnel are the historic Glynn House and Bodmin Parkway station.\nConstruction\nThe tunnel opened on 4 May 1859, when the Cornwall Railway opened between  and , and is still in use today.\nThis is one of five tunnels on the Cornwall Railway, all of which are lined with masonry and topped by brickwork at the crown of the arch. This tunnel passes through  of hard greenstone which the builders were able to drill and blast through using nine tons of powder (because dynamite had not yet been invented).\nSuicide of Silvanus Trevail\nOn 7 November 1903, the architect Silvanus Trevail committed suicide in the toilet of a train in the tunnel. Trevail caught the 11.40 up train from Truro, having purchased a third class ticket, a peculiar event as he typically travelled first class. At Par railway station he was witnessed leaving his seat and going to the toilet. As the train entered the Brownqueen tunnel, Trevail shot himself; when the train stopped at Bodmin Road, a porter was called, and Trevail’s body was found lying across the toilet.\nEtymology\nThe name \"Brownqueen\", which applies to both the tunnel and the forest around it, is a modern corruption of the old Cornish term \"Brow Gwyn\", meaning \"white mound\". It is also spelled \"brownquin\", and can be translated as \"white hill\".\nExternal links\n* [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2195662 View from the tunnel top]\nReferences"
