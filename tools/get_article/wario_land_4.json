It is the fourth installment in the Wario Land subseries of the Wario series. It was released in Japan in August 2001 and November 2001 internationally. In the game, Wario has to gather four treasures to unlock a pyramid and save Princess Shokora from the Golden Diva. The game received acclaim for its graphics and gameplay.\nGameplay\njumps between platforms on the Monsoon Jungle level of the Emerald Passage.

After an Entry Passage that serves as a tutorial for the game, there are four main passages: the Emerald, Ruby, Topaz, and Sapphire Passages. The Emerald Passage is themed around nature. The Ruby Passage is themed around mechanics and technology. The Topaz Passage is themed around toys, games, and other \"playtime\" ideas. The Sapphire Passage is themed around horror and danger, prominently involving ghosts and the like. Every passage contains four levels and culminates in a boss fight. After these four main passages is the \"Final\" Golden Pyramid, which serves as a recap of these four themes and houses the Golden Passage level and the final boss.\nEach level contains four jewel pieces, found in boxes scattered throughout, that need to be collected. Finding all jewel pieces within a passage unlocks access to the boss. The player must also find a creature called a Keyzer, which will unlock the door to the next level. The player can also collect treasure that increases their score in the form of coins that are dropped by enemies and floating crystals.\nWario begins every level by jumping through a Vortex that then closes behind him. It can only be reopened by finding a Switch located somewhere in the level. When the Switch is pressed, a timer will appear, forcing the player to get back to the beginning as quickly as possible. If the timer finishes counting down, the player's score will begin to rapidly deplete, resulting in Wario being kicked from the stage and losing all collectables if it reaches zero. Switches can also make certain blocks appear or disappear, often making the player take a completely different path to the Vortex.\nUnlike previous entries, Wario now has a health meter that depletes when he takes damage. If Wario loses all health, the player must start the level over, losing all collectables they had found.\nEvery Passage ends with a boss, which must be defeated within a time limit. Players can optionally use medals gained from playing minigames to buy an item that deals damage to the boss before the fight begins.\nPlot\nWario is reading the newspaper when he notices an article about a mysterious pyramid found deep in the jungle. The legend related to the pyramid is that of Princess Shokora, ruler of the pyramid, who was cursed by the money-crazed Golden Diva. As he enters it, he finds a black cat and chases it. Doing so, he falls down a precipice and is stuck inside the pyramid.\nExploring the pyramid, Wario has to fight several bosses, each of whom is in possession of items Princess Shokora once wore. After completing these passages, Wario gains access to the innermost part of the pyramid, which ends up being the stronghold of the Golden Diva. Wario meets the cat again, who turns out to be Princess Shokora herself. Wario defeats the Golden Diva and exits the pyramid with all the treasure he has acquired.\nUpon their escape, Shokora is restored to her true form—this may be a brattish child, a female version of Wario, a Peach-like princess, and, ultimately, a superheroine-like princess (what form Shokora is restored to depends on the total number of treasure chests Wario had acquired from the other bosses prior to facing the Golden Diva as well as how quickly each boss, the Golden Diva included, is defeated—if he took too long to defeat any of them, some of these chests will be withheld). Shokora gives Wario a kiss on the cheek and ascends to the sky as Wario watches. After she leaves, Wario grabs his loot, and the ending implies that he went off to celebrate by going to an all-you-can-eat steak buffet.\nRe-releases\nWario Land 4  was included in the list of Game Boy Advance games that were available for download by the Nintendo 3DS Ambassador Program since December 16, 2011.

Nintendo Power stated: \"It's polished variety paired with a mishmash of moves, which makes Wario Land 4 fun through and through.\"\nWario Land 4 was a runner-up for GameSpots annual \"Best Game Boy Advance Game\" and, among console games, \"Best Platform Game\" awards.

Antonball Deluxe (2021), Pizza Tower (2023), and Antonblast (2024) were all directly inspired by Wario Land 4, as confirmed by their respective developers, with Pizza Tower and Antonblast'' incorporating their own takes on Wario's transformations and the game's level-end escape segments (the latter known as \"Pizza Time\" in Pizza Tower and \"Happy Hour\" in Antonblast). While Antonball Deluxe incorporated the shoulder-bash ability renamed as the \"clutch\".\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.nintendo.co.jp/n08/awaj/index.html Official website] (in Japanese)\n*\n*"
