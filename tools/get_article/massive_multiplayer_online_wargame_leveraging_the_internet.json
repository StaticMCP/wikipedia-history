The MMOWGLI Project ended in 2018 and is no longer active.\nOverview\nMMOWGLI was launched by ONR and the Naval Postgraduate School in order to blend gaming and social media tools and to crowdsource solutions. It was initially launched with an application addressing a piracy scenario off the coast of Somalia.  The idea received coverage from national news media. More than 16,000 users registered from various national security communities, academia and the general public.  Round one of MMOWGLI gameplay started on May 31, 2011 with 2,000 players, and resulted in over 800 players registering and exchanging ideas.\nSee also\n* MMORPG\n* Government crowdsourcing\n* United States Navy\nReferences\nExternal links\nOrganizational websites\n* [http://portal.mmowgli.nps.edu/game-wiki/-/wiki/PlayerResources/About+MMOWGLI Official website]\n:* [https://mmowgli.nps.edu/evtp/reports/IdeaCardChain_Evtp.html Idea Card Chains Report, Edge Virtual Training Program (evtp)].
