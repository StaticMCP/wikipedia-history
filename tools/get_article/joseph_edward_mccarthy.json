He served as the sixth bishop of the Diocese of Portland in Maine from 1932 until his death in 1955.\nBiography\nEarly life\nJoseph McCarthy was born on November 14, 1876, in Waterbury, Connecticut. He attended the  College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts.  McCarthy was ordained to the priesthood in Paris by Bishop Félix-Jules-Xavier Jourdan de la Passardière for the Archdiocese of Hartford on July 4, 1903. McCarthy then taught Greek and French at St. Thomas Seminary in Bloomfield, Connecticut.\nBishop of Portland\nOn May 13, 1932, McCarthy was appointed bishop of Portland by Pope Pius XI. He received his episcopal consecration at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Portland on August 24, 1932, from Bishop Maurice F. McAuliffe, with Bishops John  Nilan and John Peterson serving as co-consecrators. McCarthy's consecration was the first to be broadcast by radio in the United States.\nDuring the Great Depression of the 1930s, McCarthy used his power as a corporation sole to remove the burden of debt by offering the property holdings as security for a successful bond issue. By 1936 he had stabilized the financial situation of the diocese.\nIn 1938, McCarthy purchased the former Portland home of railroad executive Morris McDonald as his official residence. He opened numerous elementary schools, high schools, and colleges during his tenure. He received Daniel Feeney as an auxiliary bishop in 1946, delegating much of the administration of the diocese to Feeney due to his own declining health.\nPersonal life\nMcCarthy was an opponent of vivisection and was an honorary vice-president of the New England Anti-Vivisection Society.\nHe died in Portland, Maine, on September 8, 1955, at age 78. He is buried in Waterbury.\nReferences"
