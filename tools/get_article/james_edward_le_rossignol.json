His father was born on the Jersey Channel Islands.\nHe was educated at the Montreal High School and Huntington academy.\nHe went on to McGill University in Montreal, Leipzig University in Germany and Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, earning a B.A., Ph.D., and LL.D. In 1898, he married Jessie Katherine Ross.\nLe Rossignol was a professor of economics at the University of Denver in 1907.\nHe was appointed professor of economics at the University of Nebraska in 1911, and director of the School of Commerce  from 1913 to 1919.\nIn 1919, he was appointed dean of the College of Business Administration.\nHe wrote works on economics as well as several books of short stories and the novel Jean Baptiste (1915).\nLe Rossignol died on 4 December 1959.\nWritings\nLe Rossignol's 1901 Monopolies Past and Present, said to \"provide an historical introduction to the study of monopolies for the use of busy men\", covered  ancient monopolies, gilds, exclusive trading companies, patents, municipal monopolies, railways and capitalistic monopolies. A reviewer said that \"it seems to be tolerably well adapted to the needs of the larger constituency for which it was designed.\"\nThe book was criticized for poor coverage of joint stock undertakings and development of the business corporation.\nIt presented the standard arguments for industrial combinations.\nA review of Le Rossignol's 1907 Orthodox Socialism said, \"One of our ablest writers on economics here defines broadly the creed of socialism, and points out its weaknesses. Strikes, labor unions, the struggle of mass with class, and the perpetual questions of wages and profit come in for their share of intelligent attention. The book is worth pondering over by every earnest voter\".\nTalking of Karl Marx's theory of value, La Rossignol wrote, \"Orthodox socialists are deeply concerned to prove it true, for if it can be shown that all values are created by labor alone, it must surely follow that all should belong to the hand and brain that created them.\"\nLe Rossignol was at the University of Denver when he published his 1910 book on State Socialism in New Zealand, co-authored with William Downie Stewart Jr, a barrister in Dunedin, New Zealand.\nA reviewer said the authors had achieved their very laudable aim of showing the \"workings of the various social experiments as they are without exaggeration of concealment.\"\nThe reviewer called the book \"an illuminating study of the remarkable series of instructive experiments in socialistic legislation, for which New Zealand has become conspicuous, together with that Australian Commonwealth, which is its nearest neighbour.\"\nPeter Haworth and his wife Bobs Cogill Haworth jointly illustrated Le Rossignol's The Habitant Merchant (1939), a collection of short stories.\nBibliography\nNon-fiction\n* (1892).
