Other things compared have included financial bubbles, chatshows and reality television. In The Irish Times, Kevin Courtney observed that \"many organisations are also stuck in limbo, destined to keep lurching on without ever achieving their stated goal. That’s because their real goal is simply to carry on regardless.\" The Cold War infrastructure has also been compared to a self-licking ice cream cone, given that expensive projects continued to be financed long after world communism had ceased to pose a viable threat.\nRichard Hoggart used the term to describe certain United Nations programmes.\nFranklin C. Spinney used the term to refer to the military–industrial complex.\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/dictionary/self_licking_ice_cream_cone/ Double-Tongued Dictionary, \"self-licking ice cream cone\", accessed April 2010] (containing extensive cites of usage)"
