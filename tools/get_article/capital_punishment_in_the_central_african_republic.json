Prior to its abolition in law, the nation was considered \"Abolitionist in Practice.\" The country carried out its last executions, of six unnamed men, in January 1981.\nIn 2018, Roland Achille Bangue-Betangai, the Chairman of the Legislation Committee of the Parliament of the Central African Republic, introduced a bill to abolish the death penalty in the country. In March the following year, the Speaker of the National Assembly, Laurent Ngon-Baba, created a joint committee to examine the bill.\nReferences"
