The qualifying period is usually the 12 months from the beginning of September to the end of August. The 2012 awards were presented at the Hyatt Regency Hotel on 3 November 2012 by Craig Smart from Channel 10 and Emmy Kubainski from Channel 7. The 2012 awards were hosted by The West Australian media workers Kate Ferguson and Daniel Hatch. The 2011 awards were presented by Matt Tinney and Narelda Jacobs at the Pan Pacific Hotel in Perth on 5 November 2011.\nThe most prestigious individual awards are the Daily News Centenary Prize (informally known as the Gold Award or the WA Journalist of the Year), which, like the Gold Walkley, is presented to the stand-out winner of all the awards; the Arthur Lovekin Prize in Journalism; and the Clarion Prize, which is awarded for outstanding achievement by a member of the Australian Journalists Section of the WA Branch of the MEAA.\nJournalists to have been highly successful have been Steve Pennells (19 awards), Gary Adshead (19), Paige Taylor (17), John Flint (17), Sean Cowan (14), and Colleen Egan (9). Pennells, Egan and Flint have also won Walkley Awards.\nAdshead has won four WA Journalist of the Year awards and Cowan three, though they shared two of those, while Egan and Victoria Laurie have each won two, one of which was shared.\n1987 winners\n* Centenary Prize: Martin Saxon, Sydney Morning Herald\n* PPC Prize: Mark Thornton, The West Australian.\n* PPC Suburban: Cathy Munro, Post
