Production of the Century began in 1967, and the model received only minor changes until redesigns in 1997 and 2018.\nThe Century derived its name from the 100th birthday of Sakichi Toyoda (born 14 February 1867), the founder of Toyota Industries. It is often used by the Imperial House of Japan, the Prime Minister of Japan, senior Japanese government leaders, and high-level executive businessmen. The Century is comparable in purpose to the Austin Princess/Daimler DS420, Cadillac Series 70, Mercedes-Maybach, Hongqi, Rolls-Royce Phantom, and Russian ZIL limousines.\nThe first-generation Century was available with only a V8 engine (the third post-war Japanese-built sedan so-equipped) at its introduction in 1967 until a full platform redesign in 1997. The second generation was only installed with a Toyota-designed and -built V12, an engine bespoke to the Century, until 2018, when the power-train reverted to a V8 with the addition of Toyota's hybrid technology.\nWhile the Century is a premium, full-size luxury sedan, it is not available at Japanese Lexus dealerships; it can only be purchased at specifically identified Toyota Store locations. The Century does not feature Toyota's typical oval logo on any of its badges; instead, it uses a phoenix logo unique to the Century. The gold phoenix logo is called the  or  from Sinospheric mythology, representing the Imperial House of Japan, and the image can be found throughout Asia, such as the Kinkaku-ji in Kyoto.\nThe exterior styling of the Century has, with some modifications, remained unchanged since its introduction, primarily due to its perception as denoting conservative success. Its appearance is iconic in Asian countries and is usually painted black. The closest Japanese competitor was the Nissan President, with a similar status reputation although, during the 1960s and 1970s, the high market positioning was also shared with the Mitsubishi Debonair. In the 1970s, two other Japanese competitors introduced large sedans — the Isuzu Statesman de Ville and the Mazda Roadpacer (both derived from General Motors-Australia products) — which were short-lived.\nThe Century nameplate introduced the SUV body style in 2023. The nameplate was spun off into a separate brand in 2025.\nFirst generation (G20/G30/G40; 1967)\n| production = November 1967 – March 1997\n| designer = Kenya Nakamura\n| assembly = Japan: Susono, Shizuoka (Kanto Auto Works)\n| engine =\n| powerout =\n| transmission =\n| length =  (standard)\n|  (L-type)\n|  (limousine)\n}}\n| width =\n| height =\n| weight =\n| wheelbase =  (standard)\n|  (L-type)\n|  (limousine)\n}}\n}}\nThe original Century was based on the 1964 Crown Eight, which featured the 2.6&nbsp;L V8 Toyota V engine, and appeared almost two years after the October 1965 introduction of the 4-liter Nissan President. Apart from minor cosmetic changes and engine upgrades, the design remained largely untouched during its 30-year production run. This appearance has also inspired the designs of subsequent versions, as it remains desired by its clientele. The Century used an electromagnetic door latch that integrated a door lock, and the interior and exterior door handles were electrically operated. The Crown Eight used a button for interior use to release the latch mechanism, while the Century provided a conventional door release handle that remained electrically operated.\nThe 1967 Century was equipped with an upgraded version of the Crown Eight engine, the 3.0&nbsp;L 3V. 1973 saw the introduction of the 3.4&nbsp;L 4V, replaced by the 4V-U two years later, benefitting from the installation of emission control technology Toyota called \"TTC\". Only column shifters were available at first, with a manual being the base option. The manually shifted versions (Type A and Type B) were discontinued in 1973 and August 1974 respectively. The 3.4-liter V8 received fuel injection in November 1978 (4V-EU), enabling the car to meet the 1978 Emissions Standards. This also meant that the chassis code was changed, to VG35. The engine was once again changed to the 4.0&nbsp;L 5V-EU in November 1982 (VG40), along with an all-new exterior appearance. Note that the 3V, 4V, and 5V do not refer to the number of valves in the engine but simply denote model names in the Toyota V engine range. On the \"C\" pillar there is a badge in blue with a gothic-style \"C\" for Century with a label \"V8\" below. The suspension used trailing arms for the front and rear wheels with airbag support springs.\nIn 1971, automatic climate control became available, an innovation. Along with the change of engine in April 1973 (VG21) a host of other changes took place. The electromagnetic locks were updated, and taillights were changed from a three-bulb sequential turn signals, adding an amber turn signal bulb on the outer edge and front disc brakes. In September 1987, the Century received another light makeover, changing from a hydraulically operated three-speed to an electronically operated four-speed automatic transmission. A floor-mounted shifter became available on a model called the D-type, which also had front bucket seats rather than a full-width bench. The grille received detail changes and the cornering lamps were integrated into the headlight surrounds.\nDuring Japan's Bubble Economy, sales of the Century doubled (from 1,027 in 1985 to 2,117 in 1989). The Century sedan wasn't enough for those heady days, and in October 1989, the Century Limousine appeared. This was  longer for an overall length of , on a  wheelbase, approximately the same dimensions as a Cadillac de Ville series, Lincoln Town Car, Mercedes-Benz S-Class, or a Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit. The Limousine also received a standard padded vinyl roof and an opera window in the centre pillar, where the stretch was placed. It also uses 150&nbsp;mm wider rear doors, for a more balanced design and ease of entry. An annual production of 60 was planned. As of September 1990, there was also an L-type stretched version of the Century sedan — length is  with a wheelbase of ; this model uses the same larger rear doors as were fitted to the Century Limousine. In December 1992, the Century received its last makeover, with some very minor changes taking place in late 1994.\nA Century with a GT45 gas turbine and electric motor was shown as the Century gas turbine hybrid concept vehicle at the 1975 Tokyo Motor Show.\nChassis codes\n* VG20: 3.0&nbsp;L 3V V8, 1967&ndash;1973\n* VG21: 3.4&nbsp;L 4V V8, 1973&ndash;1975\n* VG30: 3.4&nbsp;L 4V-U V8, 1975&ndash;January 1977\n* C-VG30: January 1977&ndash;November 1978 (1977 Emissions Standards)\n* E-VG35: November 1978&ndash;1982 (1978 Emissions Standards)\n* VG40: 4.0&nbsp;L 5V-EU V8, 1982&ndash;1997\n* VG45: 4.0&nbsp;L 5V-EU V8 (L-type) 1990&ndash;1997\nFile:Toyota-Century-102.jpg|1982 VG40 Century\nFile:Toyota Century Chiba2a.JPG|1982 VG40 Century rear\nFile:1990 Toyota Century (27248794332).jpg|1990 VG40 Century\nFile:Plush!

This model is powered by a 5.0&nbsp;L 1GZ-FE V12, rated at  in Japanese models and  at 5200 rpm in export models. Torque was rated at  at 4000 rpm for both Japanese and export versions. It was initially equipped with a 4-speed A342E automatic, until a 6-speed \"intelligent\" transmission arrived in 2005. The suspension was upgraded to double wishbone control arms for the front and rear wheels with airbag support springs. The Century remains the first and only Japanese front-engine, rear-wheel-drive production car equipped with a V12, and it has Toyota's first V12 engine.\nThis generation no longer offered a selection of  level of equipment preferred, and has either a floor-mounted or column-mounted transmission selector. From 2003 through 2004, the V12 engine was briefly offered with the ability to use CNG fuel.\nToyota began limited official exports of the G50 Century to Europe and Asian markets including China and the Middle East in November 1998, positioning it as an executive car for company and government officials. About 100 left-hand drive cars were produced for export, with some going to the United States for promotional and testing purposes. Several were in use as corporate cars for Toyota's North American executives. , the G50 remains the only generation of the Century sedan to have officially been exported and sold outside of Japan.\nThe Century was Toyota's most luxurious model at its inception in 1967, and maintained this status throughout the 20th century. Today, it is positioned above the Lexus line-up, and is the most luxurious and prestigious Toyota. In contrast to other luxurious cars (such as the Maybach or Rolls-Royce), the Century has not been positioned and marketed as a sign of wealth or excess. Marketing literature states roughly that, \"the Century is acquired through persistent work, the kind that is done in a plain but formal suit.\"\nLike other cars in the top of the luxury class, the Century is designed with the rear passengers in mind. Hence, the rear seats recline and the front passenger seat (in right-hand drive cars only) has a fold-down center section so that a passenger in the back may stretch their feet forward. The rear seats are equipped with a massage system. The doors are equipped with a soft-close mechanism, allowing the door to pull itself completely closed electrically when the latch makes contact with the striker.\nThe Century was priced at  – approximately . In comparison, the base price for the full-size luxury 2008 Lexus LS 460 is approximately  (), with the LS 600h L at  ().\nThe second generation Century was discontinued on 4 February 2017, after almost 20 years of production. 9,573 vehicles were built from 1996 (the launch year was 1997) to the final figure of 100 cars in 2016.\nToyota Century (rear), Paris, France.jpg|Century rear\n1997_Toyota_Century_03.jpg|1997 Century driver's seat. Note that the steering wheel design was later adopted for various Toyota models throughout the 2000s.\n1GZ-FE.jpg|1GZ-FE V12\nToyota Century in Vancouver BC.jpg|Century imported for use in Canada\nCentury Royal (G51; 2006)\n| engine =\n| transmission = 6-speed automatic (6 Super ECT)\n| length =\n| width =\n| height =\n| weight =\n| wheelbase =\n}}\nThe Century Royal is the official state car currently used by the Emperor of Japan, being a specially prepared Century, a one-off  () custom car. This special version has wool cloth upholstery, internal granite entry steps and Japanese washi paper headlining for the passenger compartment, as well as undisclosed security measures. The front passenger compartment is upholstered in leather.\nThe suspension consists of double wishbones for both the front and rear wheels, supplemented by air-bag support springs. The engine used is the 5.0&nbsp;L-V12 shared with the standard Century with power rated at  and  of torque at 4000 rpm. For various state functions, additional conventional Century sedans are used with a designated \"Imperial\" number roundel.\nThe limousine stretches around 20 feet in length and 6.5 feet across.\nChassis codes\n* GZG50: 5.0&nbsp;L 1GZ-FE V12\n* GZG50L: 5.0&nbsp;L 1GZ-FE V12 (LHD export)\n* GZG50R: 5.0&nbsp;L 1GZ-FE V12 (RHD export)\n* GZG51: 5.0&nbsp;L 1GZ-FE V12 (Century Royal)\nin a conventional Century, labeled Imperial 8]]\nThird generation (G60; 2018)\n| designer = Masato Tanabe\n| body_style =\n| platform = Toyota N platform\n| related = Lexus LS 600h L (UVF46)\n| engine =\n| motor =  1KM AC synchronous\n| powerout =  (petrol engine)\n|  (combined system output)\n}}\n| transmission = eCVT\n| drivetrain = Power-split (THS II)\n| wheelbase =\n| length =\n| width =\n| height =\n| weight =\n}}\nThe third generation Century was unveiled at the October 2017 Tokyo Motor Show. The car then went on sale on 22 June 2018, with prices starting from  (approximately  at June 2018 exchange rates) to the top grade Century Limousine at . The Century's production is limited to 50 per month, and it is built in a \"nearly hand-made\" fashion. Unlike the previous generation, the G60 Century is no longer available outside of the Japanese market due to the G50's failure to sell overseas.\nIt shows that its appearance was influenced by the Century Royal, which was produced at the request of the Japanese Imperial Household Agency to be used by senior members of the Imperial House of Japan in 2006. The full model update maintains the visual tradition of the Century model, while incorporating appropriate technological upgrades and advances such as Toyota Safety Sense P-series collision avoidance support, and Toyota T-Connect. The traditionally installed side-view mirrors above the front wheels, a standard feature that started with the first generation, have been replaced with door mounted units, incorporating turn signal lights.\nAs with previous generations, rear passenger comfort and convenience is made a priority. The rear seats have a recline feature, with integrated heaters and massage function, as well as an adjustable power leg rest for the rear seat opposite the driver. The sound system comes standard with 20 speakers. A 20-inch LCD screen is installed for rear seat passengers that let occupants control many aspects and features as a convenience as well as playing video content. The standard upholstery fabric continues to be offered in three color choices using 100% wool with a unique heather pattern, with leather remaining available optionally in two different color combinations. Both upholstery choices include two different wood inlay selections. The transmission selector, which on previous generations was either floor mounted or steering column installed, is now only available on the floor.\nThe powertrain is Hybrid Synergy Drive including the 2UR-FSE 5.0-litre V8 petrol engine, maintaining the displacement of the prior V12 engine but adding an electric drive system for fuel economy improvement to , compared to the prior generation's . The powertrain package is the same as the 2008-2017 Lexus LS 600h & LS 600h L; however, as the fifth-generation LS does not feature this powertrain, it is now unique to the Century. The suspension has been upgraded from the previous double wishbone to a multi-link suspension with supplemental air bags to further enhance ride quality. Toyota first displayed a hybrid engine in the Century at the 1975 Tokyo Motor Show in the Century gas turbine hybrid, with a GT45 gas turbine and electric motor.\nChassis codes\n* UWG60: 5.0&nbsp;L 2UR-FSE V8\nProduction transfer\nFrom 1967 to 2020, the Century was assembled at the Higashi-Fuji plant (Susono, Shizuoka) owned by Kanto Auto Works and its successor Toyota Motor East Japan. On 10 December 2020, Toyota Motor East Japan ceased car production at Higashi-Fuji and Toyota moved the Century assembly operations to Toyota City's Motomachi plant.\nFile:Toyota Century SIDE.jpg|Century side\nFile:Toyota Century BACK SIDE.jpg|Century rear\nFile:Toyota Century GRMN.jpg|Century GRMN\nFile:Toyota Century GRMN rear.jpg|Century GRMN rear\nFile:The interior of Toyota CENTURY (DAA-UWG60-AEXGH).jpg|Century interior\nFile:Toyota CENTURY (DAA-UWG60-AEXGH) interior.jpg|Century rear passenger area\nFile:Toyota Century at Mibu, Tokyo 2020 torch relay.jpg|2020 Olympic Torch Relay Century Pace Car (2021)\nCentury SUV (G70; 2023)\n| assembly = Japan: Tahara, Aichi (Tahara plant)\n| Shin Numoto, Takaaki Katou and Yutaro Yamamoto (interior)\n}}\n| class = Full-size luxury crossover SUV\n| body_style = 5-door SUV\n| layout = Transverse front-engine, four-wheel-drive (E-Four Advanced)\n| platform = TNGA: GA-K\n| related =\n| engine =\n| motor =\n| powerout =  (2GR-FXS engine)\n|  (5NM motor)\n|  (1YM motor)\n|  (combined system output)\n}}\n| transmission = eCVT\n| drivetrain = Plug-in\n| battery = 51-Ah lithium-ion\n| electric_range =\n| wheelbase =\n| length =\n| width =\n| height =\n| weight =\n| sp = uk\n}}\nThe Century-badged SUV model was unveiled on 6 September 2023. It is built on the front-wheel drive-based GA-K platform shared with the North American market Grand Highlander and the Lexus TX. A 3.5-litre 2GR-FXS V6 engine with plug-in hybrid drivetrain is standard. Development was led by Yoshikazu Tanaka as chief engineer, along with Design Division General Manager Tatsuya Sonoda. In its marketing materials and official releases, Toyota avoided the 'SUV' label to the vehicle. The company described it simply as the \"New Century\", and according to Tanaka, a \"new concept for chauffeur-driven mobility.\" He explained that the G70 Century adopts this body style to maximise backseat space. In January 2024, Toyota unveiled a unique Century SUV convertible model during the Grand Sumo Tournament in Tokyo, designed to accompany athletes during Sumo competitions in Japan. The idea of this vehicle was proposed by former yokozuna Hakuhō, who has close relationships with Toyota's chairman Akio Toyoda. On 23 June 2025, the Century SUV received a dimming feature for rear passenger windows.\nFile:Toyota Century 20231120 Part 3 (cropped).jpg|Rear view\nFile:Osaka Mobility Show 2023 (21) - TOYOTA CENTURY (6LA-GRG75-CNXGB).jpg|Interior\nMarkets\nJapan\nThe Century SUV launched in Japan on 6 September 2023, with orders beginning the same day. In Japan, the SUV is sold alongside the G60 sedan at select Toyota dealerships employing specialized sales and service staff called \"Century Meisters\".\nChina\nThe Chinese-market version of the Century SUV was introduced at Auto Guangzhou 2023 on 17 November 2023. Slated to be sold through the Lexus dealer network as an imported model, it is the first Century model to officially be exported and sold outside of Japan with a left-hand drive configuration since the G50 sedan, which was discontinued in 2017.\nChassis codes\n* GRG75: 3.5&nbsp;L 2GR-FXS V6\nCentury coupe concept (2025)\nThe Century nameplate was also used on a lifted coupe concept in 2025.\nFile:Century Coupe front right.jpg|Century coupe front view\nFile:Century Coupe rear right.jpg|Century coupe rear view\nFile:Century Coupe interior.jpg|Century coupe interior\nSee also\n* Century (marque)\n* Official state car\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://members.iinet.net.au/~stepho/concept.htm#gt45 Toyota concept cars]\n* [http://archive.tokyo-motorshow.com/eng/show/history/history_21.html 1975 Tokyo Motor Show]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnV1PZnVG7E Century Royal in an Escorted Convoy]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ44S92VwhM Another view of the Century Royal in another Escorted Convoy]"
