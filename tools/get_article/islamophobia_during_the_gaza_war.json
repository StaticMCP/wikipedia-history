We are seeing how Israel is currently working to crush the Talibani mentality in Gaza. They are taking the correct measures to ensure their targets are finished.\" In Indian politics, the term \"Taliban\" (in reference to the Tehrik-i-Taliban) is largely synonymous with Islamism in general, and has been used as an expression by Hindu nationalists to deride Indian Muslims.\nEurope\nFrance\nIn November 2023, the French Council of the Muslim Faith stated that it had received threats in the wake of the October 7 attacks. The council also claimed that 14 mosques had been vandalized.\nUnited Kingdom\nIn the United Kingdom, Member of Parliament Zarah Sultana called for a ceasefire, to which Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told her to call Hamas and the Houthis to deescalate the situation. Sultana responded shortly after that, \"This is an Islamophobic trope – as if by being Muslim, I am responsible for Hamas and the Houthis.\" In February 2024, hate crimes against Muslims in the UK had risen by 140 percent compared to the year prior.

According to the NYPD, the assailants shouted anti-Muslim slurs during the attack.\nOn 14 October, an Illinois man stabbed a 6-year-old Muslim Palestinian-American boy, Wadea Al-Fayoume, and his mother, Hanaan Shahin.

The same month, a cartoon in the Detroit News depicted Rashida Tlaib with an exploding pager following the 2024 Lebanon pager explosions. In response, Tlaib stated, \"This racism will incite more hate + violence against our Arab & Muslim communities\". The Council on American–Islamic Relations called on the U.S. Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism Ambassador Deborah Lipstadt to be fired after she joked \"Do you want a beeper?\" when asked about perceptions that Israel was weaker after the 7 October attacks. Ryan Girdusky, a conservative commentator, was banned from CNN after telling Mehdi Hasan \"I hope your beeper doesn’t go off\" after Hasan stated he supported Palestinians.\nIn October 2024, Ahmed Ghanim, an Arab American Democratic politician, stated that he was forcibly removed from a Kamala Harris rally in Michigan, stating, \"They keep saying they want the Muslims and the Arabs, but we aren’t even welcome at an event\".\nIn October 2024, a 23-year-old woman was indicted for second-degree assault as a hate crime, third-degree assault as a hate crime, and second-degree aggravated harassment for a unprovoked attack with pepper spray on a Muslim Uber driver on the Upper East Side in New York City.\nOn 22 May 2025, the Nueces Mosque in Austin, Texas was vandalised when an unknown person spray-painted symbols of the Star of David around the building.\nCanada\nOn 28 January 2024, assailants threw rocks at a mosque in Mississauga, Ontario, leading Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to call the acts \"cowardly, disturbing, and unacceptable\".

By comparison, the average number of weekly Islamophobic incidents prior to 7 October averaged 2.5 per week. Executive director of Islamophobia Register Australia, Sharara Attai, said that she believed that the number of Islamophobic incidents was higher than 133 and that Islamophobia and other hate crimes were often under-reported. In addition, the Victorian Police recorded 12 Islamophobic incidents between 7 October and 9 November, resulting in one arrest.\nBy 2 December, the number of Islamophobic incidents recorded by the Islamophobia Register had risen by 13-fold to 230 incidents over a period of seven weeks. Notable incidents included a young Christian boy being called a \"terrorist\" for his Palestinian ethnicity, Muslim women having their hijabs yanked off, and Arab and Muslim Australians being doxed, receiving death threats, and dismissed from their jobs for expressing pro-Palestinian viewpoints or attending pro-Palestine rallies.\nIn mid-September 2025 Aftab Malik, the special envoy to combat Islamophobia, released his report on a national framework to combat Islamophobia.
