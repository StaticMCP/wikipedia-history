The SDWG is the leading intergovernmental forum promoting cooperation, coordination and interaction among the Arctic States, Arctic Indigenous Peoples and other Arctic inhabitants on common Arctic issues, in particular on issues of sustainable development and environmental protection in the Arctic. It's main function is to advance sustainable development and improve environmental, economic and social conditions of Indigenous peoples and Arctic communities.\nStructure\nSDWG is led by a Chairmanship that rotates between Arctic Council Member States every two years with the current chair being held by Inga Nyhamar of Norway. Arctic States and Permanent Participants participate in the work, and Observers are invited to participate at SDWG meetings.\nThe SDWG is also supported by two subsidiary expert groups.\n* The Arctic Human Health Expert Group (AHHEG) pursues efforts to increase awareness and visibility of health concerns of circumpolar residents in the field of health research. AHHEG also works to expand health and education networks.\n* The Social, Economic and Cultural Expert Group (SECEG) supports work to advance research in the development of sustainable and integrated approaches emerging in the circumpolar region.\nCooperation\nSDWG works in partnership with The Arctic Council's five additional working groups to construct its strategic plans and suggest mechanisms for their implementation. The five additional working groups of the Arctic Council are:\n# Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP)\n# Conservation of Arctic Flora & Fauna (CAFF)\n# Emergency Prevention, Preparedness & Response (EPPR)\n# Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment (PAME)\n# Arctic Contaminants Action Program (ACAP)"
