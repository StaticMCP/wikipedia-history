The trade agreement would be the third FTA to cover Mexico–UK trade, superseding the Mexico–UK Trade Continuity Agreement, extending the deal to cover financial, creative, digital, services and digital trade.\nHistory\nFrom 1 July 2000 until 30 December 2020, trade between Mexico and the United Kingdom was governed by the Mexico–European Union Free Trade Agreement, while the UK was a member of the European Union. Following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the UK and Mexico signed a continuity trade agreement on 15 December 2020, based on the EU free trade agreement; the agreement entered into force on 1 June 2021.\nOn 20 May 2022, Mexico and the United Kingdom announced their intentions start talks on a modernised free trade agreement; the agreement will supersede Mexico–United Kingdom Trade Continuity agreement.\nNegotiations\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ MUKFTA Round of Negotiations\n|-\n!
