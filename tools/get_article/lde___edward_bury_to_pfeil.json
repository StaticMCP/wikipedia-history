They were given the names EDWARD BURY, DRACHE, ADLER and PFEIL.\nThe locomotives were retired between 1847 and 1854.\nTechnical features\nThe boiler was rivetted from several sections. The outer firebox was furnished with a dome that projected a long way forward over the boiler barrel and acted as the steam collection space. The two spring balance safety valves were located on the outer firebox. Two piston pumps provided boiler feedwater; they were driven via an eccentric cam from one of the axles.\nThe steam cylinder was based on English construction principles and located inside under the level of the axles which meant it required an expensive and heavy cranked axle. The engine drove the second coupled axle. The steam engine was probably fitted with a simple Stephenson valve gear without a steam expansion stage, which would not have permitted any control of steam admission.\nThe locomotives did not have their own braking equipment. Braking could only be achieved using a hand-operated screw brake on the tender.\nSee also\n*Royal Saxon State Railways\n*List of Saxon locomotives and railbuses\n*Leipzig–Dresden Railway Company\n-->\nSources\n*\n*\n*"
