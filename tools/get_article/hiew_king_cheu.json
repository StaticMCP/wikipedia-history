He was a member and deputy president of Parti Gagasan Rakyat Sabah (PGRS) from 2019.\nHiew was the Member of the Sabah State Assembly for the constituency of Luyang, sitting in the assembly for Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) - Barisan Nasional (BN) after being an independent a while in 2013. From 2008 to 2013 he was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Kota Kinabalu constituency in Sabah, representing the opposition Democratic Action Party (DAP).\nHiew had contested the federal Kota Kinabalu seat in the 2002 by-election and 2004 Malaysian general election losing on each occasion. He won the seat in the 2008 election. In a four-way election, he narrowly defeated Christina Liew of fellow opposition party PKR and Barisan Nasional's Chin Teck Meng. The election was regarded as an unexpected loss by the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition.\nHiew relinquished his federal seat in 2013, instead contesting, and winning, the State Assembly seat of Luyang. In September 2013, he resigned from the DAP to become an independent in the State Assembly due to his defiance of the party in supporting Lajim Ukin over Wilfred Bumburing to be the leader of the opposition in the assembly.\nHiew joined the Malaysian Chinese Association in 2014 after an invitation by the party in June that year. In 2017 while in MCA, he received the datukship award from Sabah governor Juhar Mahiruddin Up to 2018 and the fall of Barisan Nasional governments, he was a member in Sabah's MCA, the second largest BN component.\nIn 2019, Hiew had joined Parti Gagasan Rakyat Sabah (PGRS) and was elected its deputy president.\nHiew died from lung cancer in Kota Kinabalu, on 15 October 2024, at the age of 72.\nElection results\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:95%\"\n|+ Parliament of Malaysia\n!|Year\n!|Constituency\n!colspan=2|Candidate\n!|Votes\n!|Pct\n!colspan=2|Opponent(s)\n!|Votes\n!|Pct\n!|Ballots cast\n!|Majority\n!|Turnout\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2002\n|rowspan=2|P150 Gaya\n|rowspan=2  |\n|rowspan=2|Hiew King Cheu (DAP)\n|rowspan=2 align=\"right\" |3,716\n|rowspan=2|16.81%\n| |\n| (SAPP)\n|align=\"right\" |15,639\n|70.76%\n| rowspan=\"2\" |22,100\n| rowspan=\"2\" |11,923\n| rowspan=\"2\" |44.71%\n|-\n| |\n|Christina Liew (keADILan)\n|align=\"right\" |2,613\n|11.82%\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2004\n| rowspan=\"5\" |P172 Kota Kinabalu\n| rowspan=\"2\"  |\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Hiew King Cheu (DAP)\n| rowspan=\"2\" align=\"right\" |5,187\n| rowspan=\"2\" |20.68%\n| |\n|Yee Moh Chai (PBS)\n|align=\"right\" |15,993\n|63.77%\n| rowspan=\"2\" |25,078\n| rowspan=\"2\" |10,806\n| rowspan=\"2\" |58.16%\n|-\n|  |\n|Christina Liew (PKR)\n| align=right|3,492\n|13.92%\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2008\n| rowspan=\"3\"  |\n| rowspan=\"3\" | (DAP)\n| rowspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" |9,464\n| rowspan=\"3\" |33.78%\n|  |\n|Christina Liew (PKR)\n| align=\"right\" |9,358\n|33.40%\n| rowspan=\"3\" |28,017\n| rowspan=\"3\" |106\n| rowspan=\"3\" |64.09%\n|-\n|  |\n|Chin Tek Ming (PBS)\n| align=right|8,420\n|30.05%\n|-\n|  |\n|Kong Yu Kiong (IND)\n| align=right|341\n| align=right|1.22%\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:95%\"\n|+Sabah State Legislative Assembly\n!|Year\n!|Constituency\n! colspan=\"2\" |Candidate\n!|Votes\n!|Pct.\n! colspan=\"2\" |Opponent(s)\n!|Votes\n!|Pct.\n!|Ballots cast\n!|Majority\n!|Turnout\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2013\n| rowspan=3 |N16 Luyang\n| rowspan=\"3\"  |\n| rowspan=\"3\" | (DAP)\n| rowspan=\"3\" align=right|11,213\n| rowspan=\"3\" |70.78%\n|  |\n|Agnes Shim Tshin Nyuk (MCA)\n| align=right|2,537\n|16.02%\n| rowspan=\"3\" |15,841\n| rowspan=\"3\" |8,676\n| rowspan=\"3\" |78.70%\n|-\n| bgcolor =  |\n|Melanie Chia Chui Ket (SAPP)\n| align=right|1,694\n|10.69%\n|-\n| bgcolor =  |\n|Jafery Jomion (STAR)\n| align=right|259\n| align=right|1.63%\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |2020\n| rowspan=5|N21 Luyang\n| rowspan=\"5\" bgcolor= blue |\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Hiew King Cheu (PGRS)\n| rowspan=\"5\" align=right|62\n| rowspan=\"5\" align=right|0.36%\n|  |\n| (DAP)\n| align=right|15,510\n|89.62%\n| rowspan=\"5\" |17,306\n| rowspan=\"5\" |14,521\n| rowspan=\"5\" |66.45%\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\" |\n|Gee Tien Siong (SAPP)\n| align=right|989\n| align=right|5.71%\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"\" |\n|Anthony Linggian (LDP)\n| align=right|279\n| align=right|1.61%\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"\" |\n|Wilson Chang Khai Sim (PCS)\n| align=right|1.61\n| align=right|1.10%\n|-\n|  |\n|Chin Ling Ling (IND)\n| align=right|97\n| align=right|0.56%\n|}\nHonours\nHonours of Malaysia\n*\n**  Commander of the Order of Kinabalu (PGDK) – Datuk (2017)\nReferences"
