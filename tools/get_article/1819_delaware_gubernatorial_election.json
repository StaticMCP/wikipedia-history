Incumbent Federalist Governor John Clark was unable to seek re-election due to term limits. State Senator Henry Molleston ran as Clark's successor, winning the Federalist nomination. He faced Manaen Bull, Clark's 1816 opponent, and the Democratic-Republican nominee. Molleston won by a fairly wide margin, but died on November 11, 1819, prior to assuming office. State Senate President Jacob Stout became Governor and a special election was held in 1820.\nGeneral election\nResults\n}}\nReferences\nBibliography\n* }}\n*\n*"
