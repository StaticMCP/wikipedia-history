It is traditionally played at Stadium Australia. The Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs won the first three clashes, but St. George Illawarra won the following two. The Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs however won the two following encounters.\nThe game was the first of two on the holiday when it started, but due to the scrapping of Monday night football it is now the centrepiece event on the King's Birthday Holiday. The match traditionally kicks off at 4pm. The game is the centrepiece of the long weekend's big lineup each year.\nIn 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the match was moved to Bankwest Stadium and played behind closed doors.\nHead to head\nCanterbury-Bankstown v St George Illawarra (2015–2021)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Team\n!Played\n!Games won\n!Draws\n!Games lost\n!Points For\n!Points Against\n!Point Difference\n|-\n| Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs\n|7\n|5\n|0\n|2\n|157\n|96\n|+61\n|-\n| St. George Illawarra Dragons\n|7\n|2\n|0\n|5\n|96\n|157\n| -61\n|}\nCanterbury-Bankstown  v Parramatta (since 2022)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Team\n!Played\n!Games won\n!Draws\n!Games lost\n!Points For\n!Points Against\n!Point Difference\n|-\n| Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs\n|3\n|2\n|0\n|1\n|68\n|56\n|+12\n|-\n| Parramatta Eels\n|3\n|1\n|0\n|2\n|56\n|68\n|–12\n|}\nResults\n2015\nCanterbury\n|score      = 29 – 16\n|team2      =  St George Illawarra\n|goals1     = Tries:\nCurtis Rona '7, Josh Morris '20, Tim Lafai '62, Tim Browne '66, Sam Kasiano '76\nGoals:\nTrent Hodkinson '22, '77, Moses Mbye '63, '68.\n|goals2     = Tries:\nGareth Widdop '32, '46, Peter Mata'utia '57.\nGoals:\nGareth Widdop '34, '47\n|stadium    = ANZ Stadium\n|location   = Sydney\n|attendance = 27,291\n|nobars     = 1\n}}\n2016\nCanterbury\n|score      = 34 – 16\n|team2      =  St George Illawarra\n|goals1     = Tries:\nSam Perrett '15,\nMichael Lichaa '29,\nMoses Mbye '31,\nCurtis Rona '57,\nWill Hopoate '60,\nJosh Reynolds '70.\nGoals:\nKerrod Holland '29, 32', '60, '70\n|goals2     = Tries:\nKurt Mann '10, '48,\nTyson Frizell '37.\nGoals:\nGareth Widdop '11, '38\n|stadium    = ANZ Stadium\n|location   = Sydney\n|attendance = 20,153\n|nobars     = 1\n}}\n2017\nCanterbury\n|score      = 16 – 2\n|team2      =  St George Illawarra\n|goals1     = Tries:\nJosh Morris '54, Michael Lichaa '69, Marcelo Montoya '74\nGoals:\nMoses Mbye '55, '71\n|goals2     = Tries:\nGoals:\nGareth Widdop '21\n|stadium    = ANZ Stadium\n|location   = Sydney\n|attendance = 24,083\n|nobars     = 1\n}}\n2018\nCanterbury\n|score      = 16 – 18\n|team2      =  St George Illawarra\n|goals1     = Tries:\nAdam Elliott '17, Will Hopoate '44, Brett Morris 47'\nGoals:\nMoses Mbye '18, '48\n|goals2     = Tries:\nEuan Aitken '2, Tariq Sims '8, Nene Macdonald '34\nGoals:\nGareth Widdop '34, '56, '66\n|stadium    = ANZ Stadium\n|location   = Sydney\n|attendance = 21,376\n|nobars     = 1\n}}\n2019\nCanterbury\n|score      = 12 – 36\n|team2      =  St George Illawarra\n|goals1     = Tries:\nRaymond Faitala-Mariner '2, Kieran Foran '69\nGoals:\nNick Meaney '3, '70\n|goals2     = Tries:\nMikaele Ravalawa '9, '72, Corey Norman '13, Jonus Pearson '26, Ben Hunt '53, Zac Lomax '60\nGoals:\nZac Lomax '10, '15, '28, '55, '61, '74\n|stadium    = ANZ Stadium\n|location   = Sydney\n|attendance = 16,003\n|nobars     = 1\n}}\n2020\nCanterbury\n|score      = 22 – 2\n|team2      =  St George Illawarra\n|goals1     = Tries:\nAdam Elliott 19', Nick Meaney 50', Reimis Smith 70'\nGoals:\nNick Meaney 20', 26', 32', 51', 71'\n|goals2     = Tries:\nGoals:\nZac Lomax 3'\n|stadium    = Bankwest Stadium\n|location   = Sydney\n|attendance = 0\n|nobars     = 1\n}}\n2021\nCanterbury\n|score      = 28 – 6\n|team2      =  St. George Illawarra\n|goals1     = Tries: Jake Averillo 28', 41', Jeremy Marshall-King 51'.
