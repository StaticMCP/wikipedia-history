Grant in 1874, Martha's Vineyard has been a popular vacation site for presidents. Presidents who have taken a vacation there include John F. Kennedy, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama.\nThe presidential vacations can be risky in terms of popularity and practical safety:\n* John Adams was criticized for spending time caring for his ailing wife.\n* The longest vacation by any United States president was James Madison. Madison was at the end of his presidency, when he took a four-month vacation from sometime during June 1816 until sometime during October 1816.\n* James Garfield was shot while leaving Washington for his vacation.\n* Theodore Roosevelt was criticized for leaving Washington for months at a time.\n* Franklin Roosevelt was criticized for spending time on his yacht.\n* George W. Bush was often criticized by Democrats for taking long vacations to his ranch in Crawford, Texas, during the Iraq war.\n* Barack Obama's vacations have been scrutinized by the media. During the 2007–2012 recession he was criticized for vacationing at Martha's Vineyard.\n* President Donald Trump: In May 2019 Trump was criticized for various expenses; such as, golf trips having cost taxpayers at least $102 million in extra travel and security expenses, trips to Florida having cost $81 million, his trips to New Jersey costing $17 million, his 2018 two days in Scotland costing at least $3 million, and $1 million for a trip to his resort in Los Angeles. During most of his presidency, he used the concept of \"working-vacations\" to justify most of his trips, especially after making remarks such as \"I would not be a president who took vacations. I would not be a president that takes time off.\"\n* Joe Biden: According to a CNN article dated October 17, 2022,  \"Biden has spent more than a quarter of his time working from his home state of Delaware, either at his house in Wilmington or his Rehoboth Beach property.\"\nKnown totals\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n|-\n!
