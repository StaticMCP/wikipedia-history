Levi was very active during the educational reforms in the United States, having proposed several new courses to replace the traditional ones.\nBiography\nLevi was born in New York City in 1916. He earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Columbia University in 1942 as a student of Joseph Fels Ritt. Soon after obtaining his degree, he became a researcher on the Manhattan Project.\nAt Wesleyan University he led a group that developed a course of geometry for high school students that treated Euclidean geometry as a special case of affine geometry. Much of the Wesleyan material was based on his book Foundations of Geometry and Trigonometry.\nHis book Polynomials, Power Series, and Calculus, written to be a textbook for a first course in calculus, presented an innovative approach, and received favorable reviews by Leonard Gillman, who wrote \"[...] this book, with its wealth of imaginative ideas, deserves to be better known.\"\nLevi's reduction process is named after him.\nIn his last years, he tried to find a proof of the four color theorem that did not rely on computers.\nHe died in New York City in 2002.\nSelected publications\nBooks\n* Elements of Algebra (Chelsea Publishing Company, 1953, 1956, 1960, 1961)\n* Elements of Geometry (Columbia University Press, 1956)\n* Foundations of Geometry and Trigonometry (Prentice-Hall, 1956 and 1960)\n* Fundamental Concepts of Mathematics (1957)\n* Modern Coordinate Geometry: A Wesleyan Experimental Curricular Study (co-authored with C.
