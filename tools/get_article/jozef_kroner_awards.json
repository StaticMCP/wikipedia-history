For lasting contribution to the world of theatre (lifelong work), and for the most remarkable achievement in the area of theatre, film, television, radio or the art of dubbing.\nIn 2001-2005 awards were presented in Bratislava, but since 2006 they have been presented in the Jozef Gregor Tajovský Theatre in Zvolen. From 2004 the Jozef Kroner Foundation extended the scope of the Jozef Kroner Awards by including amateur actors. Awards in this category are presented on the occasion of Scenic Harvest in Martin.\nWinners\n* Ladislav Chudík\n* Andrej Mojžiš\n* Jozef Dóczy\n* Milan Sládek\n* Karol L Zachar\n* Elo Romančík\n* Leopold Haverl\n* Emília Vášáryová\n* Emil Horváth\n* Marián Geišberg\n* Eva Krížiková\n* Milan Kiš\n* Ivan Vojtek Sr\n* Vladimír Rohoň\n* Mária Kráľovičová\n* Eugen Libezňuk\n* Kveta Stražanová\n* Dušan Jamrich\n* Božidara Turzonovová\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.nocka.sk Official website]\n* [http://www.kroner.sk/ Alliance of the Kroner's Natives]"
