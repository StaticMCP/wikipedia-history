It involved a re-distribution of electorates as a result of the separation of Victoria, which had 6 seats in the previous council, and the expansion of the council from 24 elected members to 36 elected members representing 31 electorates. The major changes were the addition of 8 pastoral districts and the separate representation for the northern regions of what would later become Queensland. These had previously been a part of the single district of Gloucester, Macquarie, and Stanley and from 1851 were covered by the separate districts of Stanley, Stanley Boroughs and the pastoral districts of Moreton, Wide Bay, Burnett, and Maranoa. The other 8 additional seats were distributed among the nineteen counties of New South Wales.\nIn 14 out of 31 districts the candidate was elected unopposed, including all eight pastoral districts, which were seen as representing the interests of squatters.\nIn 1856 the unicameral Legislative Council was abolished and replaced with an elected Legislative Assembly and an appointed Legislative Council.\nThere would not be another general election for the Legislative Council until 1978.\nResults by district\nArgyle\n}}\nBathurst\n}}\nEastern Camden\n}}\nWestern Camden\n}}\nClarence and Darling Downs\n}}\nCook and Westmoreland\n}}\nCumberland\nTwo members to be elected\n}}\nCumberland Boroughs\n}}\nDurham\nTwo members to be elected\n}}\nGloucester and Macquarie\n}}\nKing and Georgiana\n}}\nLachlan and Lower Darling\n}}\nLiverpool Plains and Gwydir\n}}\nManeroo\n}}\nMoreton, Wide Bay, Burnett, and Maranoa\n}}\nMurray and St Vincent\n}}\nMurrumbidgee\n}}\nNew England and Macleay\n}}\nNorth Eastern Boroughs\n}}\nNorthumberland and Hunter\nTwo members to be elected\n}}\nNorthumberland Boroughs\n}}\nParramatta\n}}\nPhillip, Brisbane and Bligh\n}}\nRoxburgh and Wellington\n}}\nSouthern Boroughs\n}}\nStanley Boroughs\n}}\nStanley\n}}\nCity of Sydney\nThree members to be elected\n}}\nSydney Hamlets\n}}\nWellington and Bligh\n}}\nWestern Boroughs\n}}\nReferences"
