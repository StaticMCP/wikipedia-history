It was unveiled on 1 May 1955 after more than  years of work, and was the world's largest representation of Stalin. The sculpture was demolished in late 1962.\nHistory\nBackground\nThe structure was commissioned after the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia seized power in Czechoslovakia in 1948 with Soviet backing.  It was designed to showcase Stalinist ideology and was constructed on an elevated site on Letna Hill in Letná Park, overlooking the city centre of Prague.\nConstruction and inauguration\nThe monument was located on a huge concrete pedestal on the flattened Letna Hill, which can still be visited in Letná Park. It was the largest group statue in Europe, measuring  high and  long. The monument weighed 17 million kilograms, and consumed thirty thousand granite slabs.\nForced labour was used during the monument's construction. In 2021, archaeological excavations in Letná Park uncovered the foundations of a labour camp which housed workers involved in the monument's construction. According to historical documents, the camp consisted of three wooden barracks, each accommodating up to 40 inmates in eight-person rooms, with minimal facilities. The laborers were described as soldiers and individuals deemed politically unreliable by the communist regime.\nThe monument was officially unveiled on May 1, 1955. It was officially titled \"A Monument to Love and Friendship.\" The sculptor was Otakar Švec, who killed himself a few days before the unveiling.\nDemolition\nStalin died in March 1953, two years before the unveiling of the monument, and the process of de-Stalinization began shortly after its completion. The monument, therefore, became a liability to the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. As ordered by the Soviet Union, it was taken down with  of explosives.  The remains of the statue are stored in chambers beneath the site.\nLater use of site\n, a view from the East]]\nIn 1990, pirate radio station Radio Stalin operated from a bomb shelter beneath the statue's plinth. The same shelter was also the home of Prague's first rock club in the early 1990s. Since 1991, the marble pedestal has been used as the base of a giant kinetic sculpture of a metronome. In 1996, the pedestal was briefly used as a base for a  statue of Michael Jackson as a promotional stunt for the start of his HIStory World Tour. A billboard promoting Civic Democratic Party leader Václav Klaus was erected on the site during the Czech parliamentary elections of 1998 but was removed soon after due to high winds.\nA green plaque below the metronome reads:\nMetronome\nLetenské sady\nThe Metronome, the work of sculptor\n, was erected in\n1991 atop the massive stone plinth that\noriginally served as the base\nfor the monument to Soviet leader Josef\nVissarionovich Stalin.\nWork began on Prague's Stalin monument\ntowards the end of 1949, and in May 1955,\nit was finally unveiled. The largest group\nsculpture in Europe during its existence,\nthe monument had a reinforced-concrete\nstructure faced with 235 granite blocks,\nweighing 17,000 tonnes and costing\n140 million crowns to complete.\nThe gigantic composition, by sculptor\nOtakar Švec and the architects\nand  his wife Štursa, did not tower for long\nover the medieval centre of Prague:\nin connection with Soviet criticism\nof Stalin's \"cult of personality,\" the work\nwas dynamited and removed towards the end\nof 1962.\nThe City of Prague has been considering several options for redevelopment of the site for years, including a plan to build an aquarium. The remaining socle is a popular meeting point for skateboarders and other people.\nSee also\n*Stalin Monument (Budapest)\n*Socialist realism\n*List of tallest statues\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100911030444/http://www.spottedbylocals.com/prague/former-stalins-monument Article from Prague local about Stalin monument]\n* [http://www.peterlind.org/o/#Letná_Park_Stalin_pirat_radio 1990 Bomb shelter housing Stalin Club and pirat radio station], photo by Peter Lind"
