      "text": "# A Working Man Can't Get Nowhere Today\n\n'A Working Man Can't Get Nowhere Today' is a studio album by American country music singer Merle Haggard and the Strangers, released in 1977. Even though Haggard had moved to the MCA label, Capitol created this release from tracks previously recorded in 1975 and 1976.\nRecording and composition\nThe album was the result of some shrewd marketing on Capitol's part, playing off Haggard's previous #1 hit \"Workin' Man Blues\" and his reputation as the \"Poet of the Common Man\" by dressing him up on the cover as a hardhat worker sitting at a bus stop with a lunch box and dangling cigarette.  The concept was timely, considering the Carter-era oil crisis that was engulfing the country, and is reflected in the self-penned title track.  Despite a short running time of twenty-four minutes, the assembled LP includes several high quality cuts that, remarkably, did not make their original albums.  Foremost of these is \"Running Kind,\" a song that Haggard had recorded in Nashville in 1975 and would become a concert favorite.  In his 1999 memoir My House of Memories, Haggard titled one of the chapters after the song and stated, \"I later wrote 'The Runnin' Kind,' a song that, in essence, says I've always been running, for no particular reason. There is a restlessness in my soul that I've never conquered...\" Another outtake is \"Goodbye Lefty,\" his touching tribute to his hero Lefty Frizzell, who died in 1975. \"Blues for Dixie\" and especially the cover of Hank Williams' \"Moanin' the Blues\" feature a breezy, feel-good energy that was largely absent on his final Capitol releases.  Perhaps the most curious track on the album is its closer \"I'm a White Boy.\"  In his 2013 book on Haggard The Running Kind, biographer David Cantwell describes it as \"an aggrieved-feeling white reply to James Brown's 'Say It Loud - I'm Black and I'm Proud,' with Haggard shouting \"I'm proud! And white! And I got a song to sing!\"\nCritical reception\n|rev2 = ''Christgau's Record Guide\n|rev2Score = A−\n|rev4 = The Rolling Stone Album Guide''\n|rev4score =\n}}\nAllMusic critic Eugene Chadbourne stated in his review: \"This is one of this country legend's well thought-out combinations of hardcore traditional material from Hank Williams and the Delmore Brothers, combined with his own brilliant songwriting from some of his tried and true perspectives...\" Music critic Robert Christgau also rated the album highly, writing \"These are powerful pieces whether you like them or not, rendered with passionate sympathy and a touch of distance—his strongest in years.\" The Rolling Stone Album Guide called the album \"as tough a set of country blues as was released in the '70s.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n* Merle Haggard – vocals, guitar\nThe Strangers:\n*Roy Nichols – lead guitar\n*Norman Hamlet – steel guitar, dobro\n* Tiny Moore – mandolin\n* Ronnie Reno – guitar\n* Mark Yeary – piano\n* James Tittle – bass\n*Biff Adam – drums\n*Don Markham – saxophone\nwith\n* Tommy Collins– guitar\n* David Kirby – guitar\n* Dennis Hromek – bass\n* Johnny Gimble – fiddle\nand\n* Al Bruno – guitar\n*Hargus \"Pig\" Robbins – piano, organ\n*Glen D.
