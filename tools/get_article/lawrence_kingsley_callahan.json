He served on exchange duty with the Royal Flying Corps, receiving advanced training as a fighter pilot and attached to 85 Squadron when it went to war on the Western Front. He flew Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a fighters to his first three triumphs, on 16 June, 13 July, and 24 July 1918. He then switched to No. 148 Squadron and its Sopwith Camels for his last two victories, when he destroyed Fokker D.VII fighters on 3 and 28 October 1918.\nElliott White Springs's Warbirds memoirs of No. 85 Squadron featured Callahan.\nPost World War I\nCallahan returned to the military for World War II, joining the U.S. Army Air Corps. This term of service took him to duty with the 12th U.S. Air Force in Oran, Algeria.\nHonors and awards\nDistinguished Flying Cross (DFC)\nFor gallantry and skill. On 28 October 1918, this officer, whilst leading his flight, attacked a formation of seven Fokkers and after firing a short burst at one EA, sent it down completely out of control NW of Jenlain, and drove another EA off the tail of one of his flight. His flight in this fight accounted for six EA crashed and one out of control without losing a machine, a result largely due to his skilful leading. On another occasion he engaged a formation of EA over Esnes and succeeded in shooting down several of the EA which crashed near Esnes. This officer has accounted for seventeen EA crashed and one driven down out of control; he has proven himself an exceptionally fine patrol leader and has at all times displayed gallantry, initiative and devotion to duty of the highest order.\nSee also\n* List of World War I flying aces from the United States\nReferences\nBibliography\n*Above the Trenches: A Complete Record of the Fighter Aces and Units of the British Empire Air Forces 1915-1920 Christopher F.
