The website's critical consensus reads, \"The Warrior Queen of Jhansi has a fascinating real-life character at its center, but her story is ill-served by this heavy-handed adaptation.\" On Metacritic, the film had a weighted average score of 27 out of 100, based on 9 reviews, indicating \"generally unfavourable reviews\".\nLeslie Felperin of The Guardian gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, calling it an \"impressive drama\" where \"Bhise brings an undeniable charisma to the central role\" and a \"rousing, passionate bit of film-making on a reasonably epic scale, with a cast of hundreds deployed for some big dusty battle scenes, which are duly impressive.\"\nRachit Gupta of The Times of India gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars, stating that \"with its heavy dialogue approach and constant attempt to showcase the characters as righteous, the film plays out like a costume drama.\" He did, however, praise the film's production value, particularly the casting. Joe Leydon of Variety lamented that \"Unfortunately, despite some impressively executed battle sequences and a few aggressively colorful supporting performances, The Warrior Queen of Jhansi is too tepidly sincere to consistently excite or amuse.\" Jeannette Catsoulis, writing in The New York Times, said that \"[the movie] is so dedicated to lionization and so declamatory in tone that it almost repels engagement,\" but praised \"the gifted Devika Bhise\" and that \"the movie's costumes, though, are exquisite and its star swings a sword like a champ.\"\nFilm reviewers noted anachronisms in the scenario. For example, the character of Saleem Khan who advises Queen Victoria is based on Mohammed Abdul Karim, who did not become her advisor until 30 years later.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
