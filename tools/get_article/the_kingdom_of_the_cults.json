As of 2019, the book is in its sixth updated edition (hardback ).\nSummary\nMartin examines a large number of new religious movements; included are major groups such as Christian Science, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Jehovah's Witnesses, Armstrongism, Theosophy, the Baháʼí Faith, Unitarian Universalism, and Scientology, as well as  minor groups such as Swedenborgianism and Rosicrucianism, plus various New Age and groups based on Eastern religions. The beliefs of other world religions such as Islam and Buddhism are also discussed.\nMartin covers each group's history and teachings, contrasting them with those of mainstream Protestant Christianity. In an appendix titled \"The Puzzle of Seventh-day Adventism,\" Martin partially rehabilitated the reputation of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in the midst of the ongoing Evangelical-Adventist controversy.\nIn contrast with some standard secular definitions of the word, Martin narrowly defines a cult in theological terms as \"a group of people gathered about a specific person—or person's misinterpretation of the Bible,\" while admitting that in spite of \"distorting Scripture\" such groups' beliefs may contain \"considerable truths\" that have biblical support but have become de-emphasized by mainstream Christianity, such as divine healing and prophecy.\nInfluence and reception\nBy 1989, The Kingdom of the Cults had sold over 500,000 copies and was one of the ten best-selling American spiritual books. The book has been described as being regarded by evangelicals as \"the authoritative reference work on major cult systems for nearly 40 years.\" However, it has been criticized by members of some of the groups it discusses, particularly Mormons, who object that their faith should be labeled a \"cult\".\nThere have been several editions over the years with some changes. In the 1985 edition the Nation of Islam was not mentioned, and in the 2003 edition it was put back in a chapter on Islam itself. After Martin's death, a revised and expanded edition was issued that listed Ravi K. Zacharias as \"general editor.\"\nReferences\n*."
