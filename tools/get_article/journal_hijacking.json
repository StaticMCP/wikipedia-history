Typically, the imposter journal sets up a fraudulent website for the purpose of offering scholars the opportunity to rapidly publish their research online for a fee. The term hijacked journal may refer to either  the fraud or the legitimate journal. The fraudulent journals are also known as \"clone journals\". Similar hijacking can occur with academic conferences.\nBackground\nIn 2012,  cyber criminals began hijacking print-only journals by registering a domain name and creating a fake website under the title of the legitimate journals.\nThe first journal to be hijacked was the Swiss journal Archives des Sciences. In 2012 and 2013, more than 20 academic journals were hijacked. In some cases, scammers find their victims in conference proceedings, extracting authors' emails from papers and sending them fake calls for papers.\nThere have also been instances of journal hijacking wherein hijackers  take over the journal's existing domain name after the journal publisher neglects to pay the domain name registration fees on time.\nList of hijacked journals\nThere are several hundred documented cases of journal hijackings; hijacked journals with existing Wikipedia articles include:\n* Academy of Management Annals\n* Arctic\n* Australian Journal of Herpetology\n* Aut Aut\n* Bothalia: African Biodiversity & Conservation\n* British Journal of Canadian Studies\n* Bulletin of Hispanic Studies\n* Chelonian Conservation and Biology\n* ''Comptes Rendus de l'Académie Bulgare des Sciences\n* Entomologist's Gazette\n* Epistemologia\n* Iheringia\n* International Journal of Central Banking\n* International Journal of Multicultural Education\n* Jökull\n* Journal of Interdisciplinary Cycle Research\n* Journal of Natural Products\n* The Journal of Psychology\n* Journal of Psychology & Theology\n* Journal of Scientific Temper\n* Journal of the IEST\n* Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology\n* Jundishapur Journal of Microbiology\n* Levant\n* Natural History\n* The Nautilus\n* Novy Mir\n* Organization Development Journal\n* Positif\n* Pragmatics\n* Preslia\n* Research-Technology Management\n* Salmagundi\n* Scandia\n* Social Evolution & History\n* Specialusis Ugdymas\n* Sylwan\n* The Veliger\n* Wulfenia\n* Ymer''\nSee also\n* :Category:Hijacked journals\n* Cybersquatting\n* Confidence trick\n* Passing off\n* Predatory open access publishing\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* American librarian Jeffrey Beall's [https://web.archive.org/web/20151207233414/http://scholarlyoa.com/other-pages/hijacked-journals/ hijacked journal and authentic journal list]\n* [https://retractionwatch.com/2022/05/29/want-to-know-whether-that-journal-is-scamming-you-introducing-the-retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker/ Hijacked Journal Checker]"
