The club currently competes in the Thai League 3 Central region, the third tier of the Thai football league system.\nHistory\nSingburi Warriors Football Club was founded in 2025 and entered the 2025 Thailand Semi-pro League, a national qualifying competition organized by the Football Association of Thailand. The club won the Central region title in its inaugural season, securing automatic promotion to the 2025–26 Thai League 3 Central Region.\nAhead of the 2025–26 season, the club introduced a new logo and appointed Parinya Jaruhaeti as head coach. Kongphop Songkrasin, the father of Thailand national team player Chanathip Songkrasin, was also appointed as the club's technical director. During the pre-season period, Singburi Warriors signed Piyakit Eangprayoon to strengthen the squad for their first professional campaign. However, during the early stage of the Thai League 3 campaign, the club parted ways with Parinya Jaruhaeti following a series of unsatisfactory results.\nStadium and locations\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
