Featuring the former's daughter, North West, the song was first released as a promotional track on February 7, 2024, exclusively on Instagram, YouTube, and X. The song was later released on streaming services on February 8 as the second single from the duo's collaborative album, Vultures 1 (2024). The song was written by West and his daughter North, along with Ty Dolla Sign, Chicagoland musician Mamii, Quentin Miller, and Ant Clemons. It was produced by both West and Ty Dolla Sign, alongside Camper, Dom Maker, Edsclusive, James Blake, and Swizz Beatz.\nBackground and release\n\"Talking\" was first previewed during the Vultures Rave event at Miami, Florida on December 12, 2023. Only including North's verse, the preview later became a viral sound on content platform TikTok. The song served as North's debut as a musical artist. On December 29, DJ Pharris previewed the song's second half on his radio show, WPWX Power 92 Chicago, which came after speculation that the unreleased track \"Everybody\" would be released as a single. The broadcast consisted of a loop of the \"Once Again\" portion, and gained attention online due to DJ Pharris shouting out the fictional character Jonesy from Fortnite near the end, which fans and publications misinterpreted as part of the track.\nThe music video was teased on January 24, 2024 by West via Instagram, who posted a treatment created by North for the songs visuals. West officially released the song alongside its music video on February 7, 2024. It was later added to streaming services the next day.\nComposition\nA hip-hop song with Jersey club elements, the first half of the song focuses on West's daughter, North. Over production provided by West and English singer James Blake, North introduces herself as \"your bestie, miss, miss westie\". North's verse is often described as a \"catchy ear worm\" with fun and confident lyricism.\nThe \"Once Again\" portion of the song switches the main artist from North to Ty Dolla Sign. In his verse, Ty Dolla Sign expresses his worries for his daughter, hoping that he has been a good role model for her while asking if there's any way to stop her from growing old. He ends his verse by vowing to break his predetermined destiny, putting in the hard work to ensure his daughter has a better life than his. West's only appearance is towards the songs outro, repeating the chorus from \"Once Again\".\nCritical reception\nWriting for Billboard, Michael Saponara ranked \"Talking\" as the fifth best song on Vultures 1. Saponara praised North for \"[cooking] up an earworm of a chorus that will easily be stuck in listeners’ heads for the weeks to come.\" He emphasizes Ty Dolla Sign's candidness on the track, expressing his concerns for his daughter \"[in the] hopes she's properly prepared with the tools to take on the world.\" Saponara concludes that only someone like West could've \"churn[ed] a positive fatherhood anthem into a rap hit.\"\nMusic videos\nThe first music video, released alongside the \"Talking\" promotional single, is directed by Italian film directors Damiano and Fabio D'Innocenzo. Matteo Cocco handled the video's cinematography. The video shows shots of West and his daughter North, who is depicted getting her hair braided by a group of stylists. Ty Dolla Sign and his daughter, Jailynn Griffin, also appear.\nOn April 30, 2024, a music video directed by North West was released. The video was co-directed by Aus Taylor, who had worked on multiple visuals for Vultures 1, including photographing the cover art; cinematography was handled by Karim Belkasemi. It reuses the original treatment written by North in January. The visual focuses on North and her friends, hanging out while wearing Vultures-themed merch.\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Chart performance for \"Talking\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2024)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA)\n| 66\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia Hip Hop/R&B (ARIA)\n| 19\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Iceland (Tónlistinn)\n| 16\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Italy (FIMI)\n| 96\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Latvia (LAIPA)\n| 20\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Lithuania (AGATA)\n| 37\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ)\n| 32\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Poland (Polish Streaming Top 100)\n| 58\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Sweden (Sverigetopplistan)\n| 69\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| UK Streaming (OCC)\n| 83\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
