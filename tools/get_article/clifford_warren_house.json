The -story gambrel-roofed Cape style house was built c. 1695.  It is five bays wide, with a large central chimney.  The house is believed to be the third on the property, which was granted to Richard Warren in 1627.  Its most notable resident was probably James Warren, a noted political opponent of British rule and a Major General in the Continental Army.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Plymouth County, Massachusetts\nReferences"
