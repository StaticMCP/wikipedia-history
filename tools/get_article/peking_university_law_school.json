Its parent institution, Peking University, is the first national university in modern China. In 1898, China's young emperor Guang Xu and his supporters initiated the \"Hundred Days' Reform\", the reform was an attempt to modernize China by reforming its government, economy, and society. The short-lived reform saw the establishment of the Imperial University of Peking, which started offering law courses in 1902. It was one of only two law schools not to be closed during the upheaval of the Cultural Revolution in 1966–1976.\nOn May 24, 2003, in the case of Sun Zhigang, three graduate students at the law school, Xu Zhiyong, Teng Biao and Yu Jiang submitted a proposal regarding the Measures of Custody and Repatriation for Urban Vagrants and Beggars to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, citing concerns that the provisions restricted personal freedom of citizens and contradicted with the civil rights protection clauses of the Constitution. The proposal urged the committee to conduct a review of the provisions' constitutionality. The State Council of China formally revoked the Measures of Custody and Repatriation for Urban Vagrants and Beggars on June 20, 2020. This case has been regarded as a landmark case of China's civil rights protection movement.\nIn 2005, three professors and three graduate students at the law school filed the first public interest litigation in China, asking the Heilongjiang Higher People's Court to fine the defendant PetroChina a total of 10 billion Yuan to set up a public fund to restore the environment of the Songhua River, which was seriously polluted by an explosion of a Diphenyl Plant owned by PetroChina. However, the court refused to accept the case citing political concerns.\nIn 2009,  the Faculty of Law of Peking University banned the university's students from expressing any support for Charter 08, which was an appeal made to the Chinese government for greater democracy and for respect for human rights.\nPeriodicals\n*Peking University Law Journal\n*Peking University Law Review\nNotable faculty\n]]\n* Zhang Qianfan (born 1964): constitutional law, comparative constitution, Chinese constitution, constitutional theory\n*He Weifang (born 1960): history of western legal ideology, legal theory, comparative law, judiciary, foreign legal history\n*Jiang Shigong (born 1967): jurisprudence, constitutional law, Hong Kong legal studies, legal sociology\n*Wang Jiancheng (born 1962): criminal procedure law, evidence law\nNotable alumni\n]]\nPeking University Law School has alumni that include the former Premier of China Li Keqiang.
