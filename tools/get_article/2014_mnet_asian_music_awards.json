He raps: \"It's been a year, MAMA. Because you set such a large table/awards, you hand it out generously so your children don't fight\". Observers saw that the performance was meant to criticize the award committee for giving out awards to popular artists too easily, even when there are more technically qualified artists for the award.\nThe reception of the performance was mostly positive. CNN Indonesia wrote that \"2014 became an unforgettable MAMA event for K-Pop fans, especially Big Bang fans\" when \"G-Dragon openly satirized the award ceremony on stage.\" In an article published by Yahoo! News Taiwan prior to the 2020 awards, an observer believed it to be one of the most legendary stages in MAMA history.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://mama.interest.me Mnet Asian Music Awards]  official website"
