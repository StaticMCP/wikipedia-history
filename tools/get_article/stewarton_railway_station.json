The station is managed by ScotRail and is on the Glasgow South Western Line.\nHistory\nThe station was opened on 27 March 1871 by the Glasgow, Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway. The station closed on 7 November 1966, however it reopened on 5 June 1967. In April 2007 a 'Ticket Issuing Machine' was installed in recognition of the relatively high passenger levels.\nOperations to reinstate a second line between Lochridge Junction near Stewarton and Lugton started in 2008.  During the upgrade work (on 27 January 2009), a bridge crossing the A735 road south of the station collapsed as an oil train was passing over it, resulting in several tank wagons in the consist derailing and catching fire.  No-one was hurt in the accident; the line was closed between Barrhead and Kilmarnock for three weeks whilst the tankers were recovered and the damaged bridge rebuilt (the structure had already been scheduled for replacement as part of the re-doubling project prior to the accident).\nWhen the work was completed in September 2009, the second platform was reinstated, the pedestrian underpass re-opened and full disabled access provided. An overspill car park opened on 31 January 2012, accessed from platform 2.\nStewarton opened for goods traffic on 23 March 1871 and closed on 5 October 1964. It handled general goods as well as livestock and horseboxes.\nThe station lay  south of the old terminus, Glasgow Saint Enoch.\nThe station has been adopted (2015) by the staff and clients of Hansel Village near Symington and they also maintain the displays of planted flowers on the platforms.\nServices\n2008/2009\nThe station had a basic hourly service each way (including Sundays) to Glasgow and , with some southbound trains continuing to either  or  and Stranraer.\nFrom December 2009\nSince 13 December 2009 the station has had a basic half-hourly service each way to Glasgow and ; some trains run as express services from  non-stop to/from Glasgow Central in the May 2016 timetable. The Sunday service is hourly and now serves local stations beyond Barrhead northbound (except Crossmyloof).\nSome southbound trains continue to either , ,  or Stranraer.\nA ticket machine is located on Platform 2.\nFrom December 2012 all trains on a Sunday use Platform 1 only as does the 5.31am Glasgow bound weekday train.\n2016 floods\nIn January 2016 a number of Virgin Trains were re-routed via Kilmarnock due to flood damage to a bridge on the Glasgow to Carlisle main line near Lockerbie. The full regular half-hourly service was suspended for a time and replaced with an hourly during off peak times.\nGallery\nFile:Stewartonstation.jpg|Stewarton station as it was in July 2005, looking towards Glasgow\nImage:Stewarton railway station entrance.JPG|The entrance to Stewarton railway station\nImage:Stewarton railway station shelter.JPG|Stewarton station infrastructure with the old underpass visible\nImage:Stewarton railway station old underpass.JPG|The old pedestrian underpass as excavated during platform building works in 2009\nImage:Stewarton railway station and train.JPG|Stewarton station in 2008 with a train heading to Kilmarnock\nFile:Looking towards Kilmarnock, Stewarton Station.JPG|Looking towards Kilmarnock in 2010\nImage:Stewarton railway station - south view.JPG|Stewarton station facing towards Kilmarnock with track doubling work in evidence\nFile:Stewarton Station platform construction works.JPG|Platform construction works under way in 2009\nFile:Stewarton station new underpass 2010.JPG|New underpass to Platform 2 in 2010\nFile:Stewarton railway station - car park 2.JPG|The new car park that opened on 31 January 2012\nReferences\n*Butt, R.
