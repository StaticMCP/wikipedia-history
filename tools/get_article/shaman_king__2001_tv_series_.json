      "text": "# Shaman King (2001 TV series)\n\n| last_aired   =\n}}\nShaman King is an anime television series based on the manga of the same name written by Hiroyuki Takei. The series is directed by Seiji Mizushima and co-produced by TV Tokyo, NAS, and Xebec. At an early stage of anime production, Takei himself helped the anime's staff. However, he soon left the staff due to his time limitations as he was working on the manga. In September 2020, Mizushima commented that the original anime material presented in the latter half of the show was not something he did on his own accord, and it was requested from Shaman King's original publisher Shueisha. The 64 episodes were aired between July 4, 2001 and September 25, 2002 on TV Tokyo in Japan. While originally faithful to the manga, eventually the anime deviated from the original storyline as the manga was still being serialized at the time. As a result, the later half of episodes are completely unrelated to the manga, with a separate definite conclusion created for the 2001 series. 4Kids Entertainment obtained the rights to broadcast the Shaman King anime in the United States, where it premiered on FoxBox on September 6, 2003.\nThe episodes were collected into 16 DVD compilations by King Records in Japan and released between October 30, 2001, and January 22, 2003. The DVDs were later collected and released in three box sets between August 27, 2008, and December 25, 2008. Two DVD compilations of the English adaptation have been released by Funimation between October 19, 2004, and March 29, 2005, in an uncut form. In June 2020, it was announced that the series would be streamed on Full Anime TV and Bonbon TV services in Japan.\nFrom episodes 1–34, the opening theme is \"Over Soul\" by Megumi Hayashibara while the ending theme is \"Trust You\" by Hayashibara. From episodes 35–64, the opening theme is \"Northern Lights\" by Megumi Hayashibara while the ending themes are  by Hayashibara and  by Yūko Satō. Several CDs that contain the theme music and other tracks have been released by King records.\n__TOC__\nEpisodes\n| altdate    = 12\n| altdateT   = English air date\n| episodes   =\n| AltDate             = September 6, 2003\n| ShortSummary        = Going back home after another day of school, thirteen-year-old student Manta Oyamada decides to take a shortcut through a cemetery. On the way, he is horrified to meet a boy surrounded by spirits. On the next day, Manta's friends don't believe his story. Moreover, the boy, introduced as Yoh Asakura, turns out to be their new colleague, but denies having met Manta, strengthening his friends' disbelief. Manta decides to photograph Yoh with the ghosts at the cemetery. However, vandal Ryu of the Wooden Sword and his gang have taken over the spot. Ryu destroys a grave belonging to legendary samurai Amidamaru against his friend's advice that it could curse them. Manta makes his presence accidentally known and gets beaten up. On the next day, Yoh finally admits ghosts are real and takes a bruised Manta to the cemetery to confront Ryu and his gang. By embodying the spirit of Amidamaru, who feels humiliated following his grave's vandalizing, Yoh easily defeats Ryu and two of his thugs, expelling the gang from the cemetery for good.\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = September 13, 2003\n| ShortSummary        = Yoh wants the spirit of Amidamaru to be his guardian spirit, but he refuses because he is waiting for someone and can't leave the cemetery. Yoh tries to find out who the samurai is waiting for and decides to visit a local museum where Amidamaru's sword, Harusame, is kept. They learn from the museum's janitor that legend has it that the sword cries every night and a haunting voice can be heard. Yoh and Manta investigate and find out that Mosuke, the sword's forger and Amidamaru's close friend, is the one who cries. He explains that the two boys grew up 600 years ago in a war-torn Japan. When they became adults, they were hired by a Daimyō. However, he eventually ordered Amidamaru to kill Mosuke so that no other Harusame could be forged. Instead, he told Mosuke to flee. Mosuke asked for Harusame and promised to return it as the best katana ever in the next night. However, someone overheard the conversation and the Daimyō sent several soldiers to kill Amidamaru, who slayed them all and became a legend for it. However, without his Harusame, he eventually died. Feeling guilty for Amidamaru's death and embarrassed for Harusame's ruined state, Mosuke now spends his death crying over the sword. With the help of Yoh, who embodies him, Mosuke is finally able to restore Harusame and leaves to the world of the dead. Yoh delivers the sword to Amidamaru, who also decides to leave the living world. However, Ryu returns to the cemetery seeking revenge. Amidamaru aborts his trip and helps Yoh defeat the vandal again. Afterwards, Amidamaru decides to stay and become Yoh's ally. Harusame is returned to the museum and its restoring is regarded as a miracle.\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = September 20, 2003\n| ShortSummary        = Manta finds out a sinister shaman, Tao Ren, is in town. Yoh eventually meets him and Ren mocks him for treating Amidamaru as a friend before challenging him to a fight. That night, at another cemetery, Ryu and his friends try to make it a new place to hang out, but Ren arrives and beats them all. Yoh intervenes just in time to save Ryu and the two fight. Yoh is too much for Ren, who decides to use 100% of his power. Unable to unleash his full power as well, Yoh is easily knocked out. During the fight, Ryu is able to see their guardian spirits as blurs.\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = September 27, 2003\n| ShortSummary        = Yoh is able to partially dodge Ren's attack, but ends up with a broken arm. Ryu's gang force Ren away and take Yoh to the hospital. While recovering, Yoh has memories of him as a child being taught early shaman skills by his grandfather. Later, Yoh confronts Ren again. Still unable to achieve 100%, he tells Amidamaru to flee before Ren makes him his guardian spirit. However, Amidamaru refuses to abandon Yoh. Their strong bond finally allows them to use their full power. As a result, Yoh defeats Ren, but succumbs to exhaustion and is taken back to the hospital. Meanwhile, a girl is shown wandering the streets.\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = October 4, 2003\n| ShortSummary        = The girl seen in the end of the previous episode is revealed to be Yoh's cold and harsh fiancée, Kyōyama Anna. She decides to coach Yoh for the upcoming Shaman Fight, which happens every 500 years, scheduled to take place in Tokyo this time. Her methods seem abusive, but the training comes in handy when Yoh defeats three jiangshi sent by Ren's sister, Jun, who promises to take Yoh down.\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = October 11, 2003\n| ShortSummary        = Manta brings Yoh, Anna and Amidamaru to watch a movie about his idol, the late Kung-Fu fighter Lee Pai-Long who died mysteriously 17 years ago and had his body stolen in the middle of the funeral. As they leave the cinema, Jun confronts them personally with one of her jiangshi, which Yoh easily defeats again. Jun then reveals her main jiangshi: Lee Pai-Long himself. Jun explains he was killed to serve the Tao family and his corpse, re-embodied with his own spirit and fully controlled by her, was given to her as a birthday gift. Eventually, Yoh manages to reawaken Lee's emotions, but Jun still manages to control him. Yoh can't overpower Lee Pai-Long and Amidamaru blames their improvised sword. Jun threatens Manta, who abandons Yoh and leaves the spot.\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = October 18, 2003\n| ShortSummary        = It is revealed that Manta left the place to search for a better sword for Yoh to use. He eventually stumbles upon a gang of vandals whose leader carries a wooden sword. He asks them for the weapon, and they respond by beating him up. However, Ryu rescues Manta and takes him to Yoh, who borrows Ryu's sword and is now able to fight toe-to-toe with Pai-Long. Eventually freed from his enslavement, Pai-Long goes berserk and aimlessly attacks Jun and Yoh. To fight him, Anna summons the spirit of Pai-Long's late master, Shamon, who embodies Yoh and brings his pupil back to his senses. Pai-Long's spirit is removed from his corpse and freed to go by Jun, but he asks to be her jiangshi again, now willingly, which she accepts.\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = October 25, 2003\n| ShortSummary        = After witnessing Yoh's fight against Pai-Long, Ryu of the Wooden Sword decides that he wants to become a Shaman too. He asks Yoh to be his mentor, but Anna hires him as their housekeeper, instead. Meanwhile, Gei Yin, another shaman under the Tao family, arrives from China to have a go against Yoh. Jun refuses her help and tries to force her out of their apartment, but Gei's Yugai easily subdues Lee Pai-Long. Later, Gei faces off against Yoh in a park, but Yoh manages to destroy Yugai. In China, Ren's father is seen raising an army of jiangshi.\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = November 1, 2003\n| ShortSummary        = Yoh and Manta find an Ainu traveler called HoroHoro passed out by a snowman (though it's summer) and take him home, where Anna allows him to stay provided he helps keeping the house. Later, HoroHoro reveals he can also see spirits and that he's come to Tokyo to fulfill his dream of creating a vast field of petasites where the koro-pok-guru, spirits of his people's folklore, could live. He used to sell Ainu handicraft for a living, but he had all his pieces stolen. Anna worries that he might be a shaman trying to eliminate opponents before the start of the Shaman Fight. When they attempt to investigate, HoroHoro goes missing. They find him outside fighting a group of jiangshi with his koro-pok-guru guardian spirit, Kororo, embodied in his snowboard. Yoh joins the fight and HoroHoro finishes them off. Later, he explains he suspected they had stolen his things and tracked them to Yoh's house, where he watched them from afar until he passed out due to hunger. However, Anna explains they were simply sent by the Tao family to kill Yoh. HoroHoro later finds his belongings at a police station where he learns they were confiscated so they would not block the sidewalk. Still having nowhere to go, he returns to Yoh's house.\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = November 8, 2003\n| ShortSummary        = Ryu believes he'll never be able to become a Shaman and doesn't go to Yoh's place for his duties. In order to cheer him up, Muscle Punch, one of his friends, takes the gang to an abandoned bowling place, where they intend to establish their \"best place\", a place where they can hang out. Ryu rejects the place, however, for being too far from a train station and lacking a convenience store. Still, they decide to have a go at bowling. When Yoh and Manta come check the place looking for him, he hides in the female restroom, where he is possessed by the spirit of Tokageroh (Gecko). Meanwhile, Yoh, Manta and Amidamaru sense the place is haunted and advise everyone to leave it once they find Ryu. Big Ball, another friend of Ryu, says no business in that area succeeds due to a curse. Ryu emerges from the restroom as a ruthless bandit and takes his gang to the museum where Harusame is kept, intending to steal it. Manta spies on them and ends up kidnapped. Ryu takes him and his reluctant gang to Yoh's house, where Tokageroh reveals himself and says he wants revenge on Amidamaru for killing him 600 years ago.\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = November 15, 2003\n| ShortSummary        = Threatening Manta, Tokageroh forces Yoh into a fight in which he eventually unveils Amidamaru's own Harusame, much to everyone's surprise. Anna soon realizes the only way of saving Manta is by incapacitating Ryu' body, which could kill him, or by destroying the sword. Amidamaru has a memory of his poor and troubled childhood as a member of a group of orphans who lived by themselves. After seeing many of his low-quality katanas destroyed in battle by Amidamaru, Mosuke decided to make a fine sword using his late father's blade. Amidamaru cries with such gesture and says it is raining in spite of the spring season, which is the origin of the sword's name (spring rain). Back to the present, Tokageroh tries to kill Manta, but Ryu's friends rescue the boy, hold Ryu still and try to make him come back to his senses, to no avail. Having lost his hostage, Tokageroh now uses Ryu himself as a hostage. Inspired by Ryu's gang, Amidamaru and Yoh realize Harusame is not as important as Ryu and destroy it. Tokageroh still attempts a final move, but Ryu's unprepared body succumbs to the exhaustion of being embodied. Sensing all Tokageroh ever wanted was some friends, Yoh lends him his own body for him to do what he pleases. Everyone is shocked to see that Tokageroh will attempt to kil Yoh, but he gives up and cries when he realizes someone is willing to die for him.\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = November 22, 2003\n| ShortSummary        = After breaking Amidamaru's sword, Ryu becomes even more depressed out of guilty. Everyone is surprised when he announces he's able to perfectly see Amidamaru, and Anna explains his shaman powers were awakened following Tokageroh's possession. Ryu's gang look for a way of cheering Ryu up while he works hard at the house to pay for Tokageroh's wrongs. Meanwhile, the spirits that live in the house are gone and Anna, Yoh and HoroHoro sense a strong presence. A man wearing a bird mask is shown in a tree close to the house. The group decide to use Anna's powers to bring Mosuke back to the living world and embodies it on Ryu so they can restore the sword once again. Soon afterwards, the bird-masked man generates three warriors to challenge Yoh, who gets the chance to use his new weapon: the spiritual Harusame, forged by Mosuke and generated by the spiritual force of Yoh. With the new sword, Yoh easily defeats the three warriors. Anna explains they were shikigamis sent by Asakura Mikihisa, Yoh's father. Ryu and his gang leave with the former willing to follow his own path temporarily. As he rides away on his bike, Ragou, the star that signals the beginning of the Shaman Fight, descends from the sky and Mikihisa offers to be his coach.\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = November 29, 2003\n| ShortSummary        = An Apache-like female elder figure is seen in a cave instructing ten similar male figures about the upcoming Shaman fight. Later, Yoh is invited by one of these mysterious figures for a test to be allowed in the Shaman Fight. Later at a park, the man introduces himself as Silva, hailing from the Patch tribe and one of the ten Shaman Fight priests. He explains that the only thing Yoh needs to do in order to enter the championship is to hit him once within 10 minutes. This task proves to be a real challenge for Yoh, since Silva has five different animal spirits with him and uses a different technique to unleash their powers. Soon, Yoh realizes Silva has his spirits embodied in objects all over his body and decides to give it a try by embodying Amidamaru in Harusame, giving birth to his very own Over Soul, with which he manages to hit Silva. Exhausted, Yoh learns that keeping an Over Soul consumes furyoku, the energy by which a Shaman's power is measured, which explains why he feels so tired. Yoh is given the oracle, an electronic device used as a bracelet where all information regarding the championship is uploaded. Soon after Silva leaves, Yoh is informed of his first opponent: HoroHoro.\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = December 6, 2003\n| ShortSummary        = HoroHoro's sister, Pirika Usui, pays him a visit at Yoh's house. When she finds out her brother is living with his first Shaman Fight opponent, she takes him off the place to stay with her at a camp nearby. Now alone with Yoh and Manta, Anna intensifies her fiancée's training. Two weeks later, Yoh, HoroHoro and their companions meet by a skyscraper where the battle is going to happen. The fight, overseen by Silva and Kalim (the priest who tested HoroHoro), will only end when one of them becomes unable to Over Soul. HoroHoro is surprised by Yoh's ability, but Pirika reminds him of his dream of saving the koro-pok-guru, which gives him strength to prepare his special attack, the All-Swallowing Avalanche. After the final clash, HoroHoro seems to be the winner, but Yoh emerges from under the snow safe and well, while HoroHoro's Over Soul ends, which makes him lose the match. Later, Anna and Manta comfort Pirika by explaining HoroHoro still have two battles. Meanwhile, Yoh and HoroHoro amicably have a bath together and promise to have a rematch.\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = February 14, 2004\n| ShortSummary        = HoroHoro skips his training to pay Yoh a visit, but Pirika captures him and goes bitter on Yoh for defeating her brother and \"messing their dream\". Yoh melancholically realizes only one person will be Shaman King. His second opponent is an eerie figure called Faust VIII and the fight is arranged at a catholic cemetery. Meanwhile, Silva takes Anna to dinner and asks her to make Yoh forfeit the match, explaining that Faust killed his previous opponent by continuously attacking him even after he was unable to Over Soul and despite a priest's intervention. Back at the cemetery, Faust reveals his medium - a full skeleton under his coat with a bullet hole on its forehead. He explains he is a necromancer and a descendant of Faust and that he was a doctor who found great pleasure in saving people's lives, but was unable to beat death, which motivated him to go after the Shaman King title. Manta comments that reviving the dead might be impossible, which infuriates Faust. The doctor takes control of the countless skeletons buried around him and have them kidnapp Manta and subdue Yoh. Manta is attached to a cross and Faust uses his powers to explore inside Manta's body while Manta is awake. Yoh breaks free from the bones and promises to take Faust down.\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = February 21, 2004\n| ShortSummary        = Faust's skeletons can easily rebuild themselves, which causes Yoh to waste his furyoku with endless waves of enemies while the doctor continues to harass Manta. When the match officially begins, Yoh's already too tired. Faust eventually explains he wants to be Shaman King specifically to resurrect his late wife Eliza – the one whose skeleton he carries under his coat. They first met as kids, when Eliza had an incurable disease. After 20 years of researching, Faust found a cure and they married, opening a small medical center later. However, she was murdered by a criminal one night. Frustrated with his inability to bring her back to life, Faust explored his ancestor's writings and found out about the Shaman Fight. Silva, already overseeing the match, wonders why the calm Yoh is so angry and Anna explains Manta is Yoh's first non-shaman friend, and that he has always been rejected in his town due to his family's tradition as shamans, an activity associated with the devil nowadays. Back to the fight, Faust lets go of his skeletons and concentrates all his furyoku on Eliza's skeleton, eventually materializing her. She proves to be way above Yoh's league, specially because of his low furyoku. Silva explains Faust did not use more than 1% of his furyoku to control all those skeletons, and that kidnapping Manta and using the bones to distract Yoh was all a plan to weaken his opponent, who is actually stronger than him. Yoh eventually calls Eliza a doll, which infuriates Faust. The doctor unleashes the full power of Eliza on Yoh and later assembles every bone around to create a gigantic skeleton to crush Yoh. Tao Ren emerges and takes Faust out with just one hit, explaining he doesn't want anybody to kill Yoh because he is his next opponent.\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = February 28, 2004\n| ShortSummary        = Due to Ren's interference, Yoh loses his match. In an attempt to prevent Manta from getting harmed again, Yoh ends their friendship. Later, Manta and Ryu accidentally meet by Yoh's house and read a note informing they left home for some time. Ryu invites Manta for a journey on his bike to search for Yoh and they head to Izumo, Yoh's hometown. A car is seen following them. Later, at a convenience store, Ryu secretly confronts the occupants of the car that's been following them and learns they are two shamans, a little girl and a woman, who attack him on sight. Tokageroh joins Ryu and they have a very brief fight with them, but Mikihisa intervenes and ends it. Yoh's father congratulates Ryu and advises him to fix a ripped sleeve, which reveals an oracle under it. In Izumo, Yoh meets Yohmei, his grandfather, and asks him for a way to get stronger in time for his fight with Ren. Yohmei tells him there is a way, but it may cost his life. Later, he takes him to the entrance of a dark cave. Yoh's training simply consists of following the cave's only path to the other side of it. On his way, he will be deprived of light and sound. Yoh understands and starts his journey, which is expected to last for seven days. Meanwhile, a pink-haired girl accompanied by the spirits of a fox and a raccoon predicts disaster will be brought on Yoh by two persons, \"one small and one big\".\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = March 6, 2004\n| ShortSummary        = Tamao, Ponchi and Konchi (the girl and the spirits seen at the end of the previous episode) decide to confront the \"big and small\". Ryu and Manta finally make it to Izumo and head to a local temple to ask for directions to Asakura's estate. However, Tamao, believing them to be the threats to Yoh, confronts them, but Anna intervenes and clears up the misunderstanding. Manta meets Yohmei, who explains Yoh's training and its risks. Meanwhile, Ryu, who was left at the temple, is greeted by Mikihisa, who takes him to the cave. Ryu gives it a try, but gives in within minutes. Tamao predicts the moment when Yoh is going to exit the cave and heads to the location with Manta, Anna, Yohmei and Amidamaru. The two girls who fought Ryu in the previous episode, now introduced as Elly and Milly, also reach the location and try to block the cave's entrance. However, Yoh still manages to emerge from it alive. Using his new Over Soul, in which Amidamaru is able to communicate with him, Yoh easily dispatches the girls. Meanwhile, HoroHoro is seen defeating an unknown rival in his third Shaman Fight match, which qualifies him for the next stage.\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = March 13, 2004\n| ShortSummary        = Silva and Kalim discuss Yoh and Ren's upcoming battle. Meanwhile, Tamao pays Yoh and Anna a visit to support the former. When the battle starts, the boys seem to be even. However, Ren unleashes his full furyoku, which makes his Over Soul evolve and become much bigger and stronger than Yoh's. With the help of Amidamaru, experienced in facing bigger rivals as a kid, Yoh eventually manages to dodge Bason's attacks. Having memories of his dark childhood and angry at Yoh's tranquility, Ren intensifies his attacks. Meanwhile, Jun is seen trying to convince her father, Tao En, to free Ren from the Tao family's commitments.\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = March 20, 2004\n| ShortSummary        = Jun tells her father that Ren is a gentle boy and has seen too many horrible things as Tao's heir. She also says Yoh's kind and warm heart will eventually make Ren lose despite their power difference. En rejects her words and has her imprisoned. Meanwhile, Yoh learns how to unleash the full power of his Over Soul, making it as big and strong as Ren's and securing himself a draw which qualifies both to the next stage. Later, everyone including Ren celebrate at Yoh's house. Realizing his ways were wrong, Ren decides to confront his father, the source of all his hatred, in China. It all goes downhill, though, and Bason heads back to Japan to ask Yoh for help.\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = March 27, 2004\n| ShortSummary        = Bason explains how Ren took a beating from a mind-controlled Lee Pai-Long and was subsequently imprisoned by En. He only escaped because Ren ordered him to do so before En could turn him into another of his puppets. Anna disallows them to go help Ren stating that the Tao family is too dangerous. Meanwhile, Ryu is seen defeating an opponent in a Shaman Fight overseen by Yoh's father and one of the Ten priests. A group of spirits at the cemetery where Yoh first met Amidamaru are seen being attracted to a pair of heavy metal musicians. That night, Yoh, Manta, and HoroHoro sneak away from Yoh's house to rescue Ren. On their way, they cut through the cemetery and meet the heavy metal duo, who are introduced as BoZ brothers and state they have cleansed the cemetery from spirits. Tamao arrives with her spirits, who laugh at the duo's attire. They start to play a song that contains a Buddhist pray in its lyrics, which sends Ponchi, Konchi, Amidamaru and Bason to paradise. They also imprison Kororo, which cannot be sent to paradise for being a natural spirit. Meanwhile, they use a small army of little spirits to hold HoroHoro and Yoh and mention a certain person named Hao. Ryu emerges and defeats the duo, saving Yoh's group and finally revealing himself as a capable shaman bonded with Tokageroh. The battle is overseen by a female trio, who report the outcome to a boy sitting next to a large, red, humanoid creature. After the fight, Anna has all spirits from the cemetery plus Amidamaru, Bason, Ponchi and Konchi return to the living world. In their prison cell, Ren tells Jun he will confront his father again.\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = April 3, 2004\n| ShortSummary        = En's wife asks him about his next steps now that their children are being punished. Meanwhile, Yoh, Manta, HoroHoro, Ryu and Bason reach the Tao family's main house. On their way to rescue Ren and Jun, they are stopped by the five jiangshi who are known as the Five Deities - five powerful warriors with altered bodies. Ryu is easily knocked out by one of them, but HoroHoro reveals his new Over Soul and holds his own against them. Ryu awakes safe and well and also reveals his new Over Soul, allowing Yoh and Manta to proceed to the dungeon where Ren and Jun are being kept. Later, they are seen defeating four of the dolls and are about to confront the fifth one. Yoh rescues Ren, who feels ready to take on his father again. However, Pai-Long emerges controlled by En and attacks the group in his evolved, dragon-like form. Since he is too important to Jun, Yoh and Ren figure a way of defeating him without destroying his corpse. The boys head back to Ryu and HoroHoro, only to find them defeated by the last jiangshi.\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = April 10, 2004\n| ShortSummary        = Yoh and Ren are no match for the most powerful of the Five Deities. HoroHoro and Ryu wake up but even the four combined are still incapable of beating the jiangshi, who uses Pai Long's movements in combat. Manta deduces he is Shamon and the jiangshi confirms it. When he tries to finish Yoh off, Pai Long stops him and confronts his master's corpse, defeating it with just one hit. Afterwards, Ren and Jun go face their father and try to prevent Yoh and his friends from going with them, but they insist. En sends an army of jiangshi to fight them, but the dolls are easily defeated by the quintet. En keeps sending more dolls until he calls them off and has Ren come face him once and for all. Yoh and the others are struck with awe by En's size. HoroHoro and Ryu attack him, but En simply vanishes and reappears behind them, leaving his opponents mystified with his abilities.\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = April 17, 2004\n| ShortSummary        = Yoh, Ren and the others try to figure out how En manages to prolong members of his body, teleport from one point to another within the room and regenerate himself. However, they end up easily overcome. Eventually, they deduce En's current form is just an Over Soul and decide to keep attacking him to exhaust his furyoku. Once he is weak enough, Ren applies a final hit to finally destroy his Over Soul, revealing En's true form: one of a normal-sized man. En explains how the Tao clan has served China's emperors until new war technologies were introduced and their shamanic powers were deemed evil and they were expelled from Beijing. Such betrayal is the reason behind his hatred. He also shows them his guardian spirits are the souls of all his ancestors. En attempts one final attack on Ren, but his son's confidence of mind proves able to defeat him. Exhausted, he still tries to fight, but his wife and father emerge and tell him to stop. Later, everyone has dinner together and Ren's grandfather reverberates En's speech about China's betrayal, but says Ren and Jun have broken free of Tao's duties. Meanwhile, En's spirits comfort him and say a new era is dawning for the Tao family. On the next day, the group heads back to Japan.

Yoh hangs out with Anna and then with Manta; HoroHoro enjoys some time with Pirika, who gives him an Ikupasu she crafted herself; Ryu reads a farewell collective gift handwritten by his gang; and Ren talks to Bason about the upcoming fights. Meanwhile, Silva is warned by Kalim that Hao – the person mentioned by Zenryou in episode 21 – is in town. He meets him, who is revealed to be the boy seen later in that episode. Silva says he is very bold to \"show up again\" and Hao explains he \"exists since too long\" and that it is because of him that Silva was born. Meanwhile, they notice a group of white-dressed figures watching them from afar. On the next day, Yoh, HoroHoro and Ryu head to an airport where Ren awaits them with a jet. Manta meets them there to say goodbye. Hao shows up and provokes them, easily defeating the four with his spirit, the gigantic Spirit of Fire. He tells Yoh to get stronger for him, the \"future king Hao\", and leaves carrying a group of partners.\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = September 18, 2004\n| ShortSummary        = The quartet's airplane crashes in the desert, but they safely land using their Over Souls. They deduce the jet's engine was attacked by a shaman. Meanwhile, a group of five female shamans, including Elly and Milly, are revealed to be the ones behind the attack. Amidamaru spots a city far in the distance and tells them it will take one day of walk to reach it. Eventually, the group meets SUV driver Billy, who gives them a ride to the town. There, they ask for directions to the Patch Village, but nobody knows a thing. One of the five ladies lures them to an ambush where they introduce themselves (besides Elly and Milly, the group is also formed by Sally, Lilly, and Sharona) and admit to being the ones behind the jet's sabotage, explaining the rules say nothing about eliminating adversaries prior to the official matches. However, Silva emerges and says if a fight is overseen by one of the Ten Priests, the losers may be disqualified. Yoh's group easily avoid the ladies' attacks and respond with a combined attack that intentionally misses them so they are scared, but unharmed. Realizing their power difference, the ladies flee, preventing a disqualification. Later, Ren appoints Yoh as the group leader and they get a ride from Billy once again.\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = September 25, 2004\n| ShortSummary        = A green-haired boy is seen attacking three shamans with his dowsing pendulum. After the third attack, he says to himself he needs to find strong allies \"in order to defeat Hao\". Later, the five ladies, who have observed him before, ask him to join them, but he easily defeats them and says he has no interest in shamans weaker than himself. Before leaving, Milly tells him about Yoh's group, who are still looking for information leading to the Patch Village. The boy eventually finds Ryu and introduces himself as Lyserg Diethel, a shaman from the United Kingdom looking for strong allies before he proceeds to the next stage of the Shaman Fight with his guardian spirit, the small fairy Morphine. Initially mistaking him for a girl, Ryu takes Lyserg to the others, but Ren and HoroHoro are against admitting a complete stranger in the team. Lyserg forces them into a fight to test them and has memories of Hao standing inside his burning house by his parents' bodies eight years before. Stating he needs strong allies to defeat \"him\", Lyserg easily takes Ren and HoroHoro out, destroying their weapons in the process. Yoh ignores him and helps them walk to the hospital, but Lyserg insists on carrying on with the fight. Yoh easily destroys his glass pendulum, but he replaces it with a stronger one made of crystal and heads for his special attack. Yoh asks him who is he really fighting and Lyserg notices Yoh's look is identical to Hao's. Lyserg is defeated and frustrated, but Yoh nevertheless invites him to accompany them to the hospital so he can explain the reason behind his seek for allies.\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = October 2, 2004\n| ShortSummary        = The three shamans attacked by Lyserg in the beginning of the previous episode decide to join forces to get revenge on him. They are approached by Zenryou, who give them a small cage as a gift from \"someone\" to help them fight Lyserg. Meanwhile, Lyserg tells Yoh, Ryu, Ren and HoroHoro his story. Morphine was given to him as a kid, but she was locked inside a cage - the one in possession of BoZ Brothers- and he was tasked by his father, a Sherlock Holmes-like detective, with finding the key. As he was finally locating the key - which he uses as his crystal pendulum - inside the Big Ben, Hao visited his parents and asked them to join him for the upcoming Shaman Fight. They refused and Lyserg's father tried to arrest Hao for his alleged killings, but he responded by killing them and burning the house. When Lyserg arrived, he threw Morphine's cage on Hao, but Spirit of Fire caught it and they left. Despite the tragedy, Ren is still reluctant about accepting him as a member. Later, Milly tells him a trio of shamans are coming for him. Lyserg sneaks away from Yoh's group to face them alone, but Morphine ends up trapped within her cage. Ren rescues Lyserg with Bason incorporated in his body following his spear's destruction and says he will help because the \"leader\" has decided he is a new member of the group. HoroHoro joins the fight and reminds him that he had a partner all the time: Morphine. Ryu and Yoh arrive and Lyserg has the chance to recover his spirit. The trio ends up defeated and is later burned by Hao, who wonders if Yoh got stronger. Using his dowsing abilities, Lyserg deduces they should head to Southwestern United States.\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = October 9, 2004\n| ShortSummary        = While walking across a frozen canyon filled with shamans amidst a heavy blizzard storm, Yoh and the others find the five ladies from episode 26 frozen and take shelter in a cave with them. Eventually, Lyserg's pendulum senses Hao's presence and they find him by the cave entrance inside some kind of invisible shield that prevents the blizzard from touching him and his followers, which impresses them all. Hao once again tells Yoh to get stronger and leaves. Sharona, Elly, and Sally join Hao's group, while Milly and Lilly stay behind. Lyserg is feeling down after witnessing Hao's nature-controlling power, but HoroHoro says no one can simply control the environment. Trying to cheer Lyserg up, Ryu tells him how he became a Shaman: after much insistence from Mikihisa, Yohmei agreed to train Ryu as long as he ascended to the top of Mount Sentsuuzan and came back alive, but he warned him of Yamata no Orochi, saying the spirit takes the form of the river and creates devastating floods. On his journey, overseen by Mikihisa, Ryu eventually came across an army of spirits sided with Orochi. Unable to feel connected to Ryu, Tokageroh left him to fight them alone. Later, a flood came towards Ryu. Tokageroh reunited with him and Ryu managed to hold the wave with his Over Soul. Back to the present, the group leaves the cave as the blizzard ceases. With her Over Soul, Lilly sees Hao tossing her three friends on the frozen river and using his spirit to create a gigantic wave to erase all shamans left behind. Using his special attack, Ryu manages to hold the wave and the group join forces to put an end to it and save the shamans caught by it, including the ladies. Meanwhile, Yohmei glances at a book called \"Chou Senji Ryakketsu\" and says it is \"wishing Hao\". He sends a Shinigami to Anna to deliver a message.\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = October 16, 2004\n| ShortSummary        = Yoh and the others walk through a forest. Nearby, Milly has an argument with her friends and runs into the woods, where she is eventually attacked by Krysler, a shaman using the spirit of a spider. Stating he failed the initial Shaman Fight test, he steals her oracle bell, believing he will be granted a place in the Shaman Fight in the process. Yoh's group eventually find her and decide to help her retrieving her oracle bell. Meanwhile, Hao watches from afar and is in turn watched from afar by Mikihisa, who sends a message. The group locates Krystal, but he enters a bus. Using his Over Soul, Ryu manages to get them a lift from Billy in the middle of the woods. They finally catch Krystal, but the oracle bell is destroyed in the fight. Krystal takes Milly hostage in one final attempt of obtaining an oracle, but the girl's friends rescue her. Soon after, Silva comes flying and gives Milly a new oracle bell, explaining the oracle will only work for the person it was granted and it can be replaced if damaged. In Japan, Anna asks Manta to take her to Osorezan, where they are greeted by dozens of itakos. meanwhile, Mikihisa's message has been delivered to Yohmei and Kino accompanying him.\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = October 23, 2004\n| ShortSummary        = While attempting to have Billy come to give them another ride, Ryu and his friends are watched by a couple of small lightball-like spirits. They head to an abandoned town and join several other spirits who restore the city. Later, an elder couple gives them a ride and propose they stay overnight. The couple is revealed to be dolls controlled by the spirits, who spend the night secretly messing with Yoh's group. Meanwhile, Hao contemplates interfering in Yoh's \"play\", while Mikihisa watches from afar. In the morning after, the couple admits they realized Yoh and the others were shamans and asks them to investigate some \"monsters\" inhabiting the town's mines who occasionally come down to harm citizens. Joined by the five ladies, the group heads to the mine, where they reveal to the girls that there are no evil monsters and the couple is not real and that everything is just a made-up story by spirits who are possibly just looking for some fun. The monsters finally show up and engage in a friendly fight. Soon after, Hao materializes and burns some of the spirits, warning Yoh to stop playing and get stronger so he can \"end the cycle\". Hao then heads to a forest and demands Mikihisa to reveal himself, to no avail. He then asks him to deliver \"that\" to Yoh as soon as possible, so Yoh can reach the \"strength of a thousand years ago\". Following another encounter with the much more powerful Hao, Lyserg is frustrated again. In Japan, Anna performs a ritual that recovers a large pearl necklace called 1080 from the bottom of a lake.\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = October 30, 2004\n| ShortSummary        = Following another failed attempt to summon Billy, Ryu and the others are starving. Concerned with it, HoroHoro checks a nearby forest for food. He eventually meets a shaman called Allen, who is not taking part of the Shaman Fight and spends his days protecting the local animals and trees. When some trucks and bulldozers come deforest the place for a future resort, Allan destroys the machines, but HoroHoro eventually stops him and says violence is not the right response. When the vehicles return for a second time, Allan's attempts to stop them cause a huge wildfire. They try to put the fire out, to no avail. HoroHoro suggests they destroy a part of the forest to stop the fire from spreading, but Allan is reluctant. HoroHoro then incorporates Kororo in the Ikupasu Pirika gave him, developing a new Over Soul with the power to destroy some trees and put the fire out simultaneously. Later, he returns to his friends with a large piece of meat, but asks them to \"return nature's gift\". The group cleans the forest fire site and plants several new trees. Allan finally understands it is OK for humans to be part of the cycle of nature. Meanwhile, one of Hao' followers talks to him about Yoh. In Japan, Anna takes part of a purification ritual and asks Yohmei about the next step, which, according to him, \"already began 13 years ago\".\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = November 6, 2004\n| ShortSummary        = Hao orders Ashil, the follower seen talking to him in the previous episode, to kill \"one or two\" of Yoh's friends so he becomes wiser and angrier. Bill Burton is sent along to keep Yoh himself from taking part of the fight and getting harmed. As the pair leaves, Opacho, another of Hao's followers, remarks \"their\" presence. Even alone, Ashil fights Ryu, Horohoro, Ren and Lyserg with ease. He also reveals that Yoh is Hao's descendant, shocking everyone. After Yoh manages to break through Burton's defense and join the battle, Ashil decides to have him and his friends terminated, but he is suddenly killed by a beam of light. Some white-dressed shamans - the ones seen in episode 25 - emerge next to a gigantic, robotic, angel-like creature and a blond man introduces them as the X-Laws, a sect devoted to erasing Hao and his followers from Earth. They even invite Yoh's group to join them, but Yoh refuses due to Ashil's cold-blooded execution. Later, Opacho asks Hao about the X-Laws and Hao replies he will allow them to do what they want. In Japan, Yohmei reveals Hao dates back to a thousand years ago when every Asakura member gave their best to defeat him, though it was too late, for he had already mastered god-like abilities, allowing him to manipulate his own life and reincarnate at will. Yohmei explains Asakura's purpose is to defeat Hao. He asks Anna to deliver the Chou Senji Ryakketsu, the book containing Hao's initial techniques, to Yoh.\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = November 13, 2004\n| ShortSummary        = meanwhile In Japan, Yohmei explains that if Yoh manages to master Chou Senji Ryakketsu's teachings, he will reach Hao's power level of a thousand years ago. However, he explains the book is sealed and protected by Zenki and Kouki, two Shikigami loyal to Hao. Tamao accidentally breaks the seal and sets both creatures free, but Anna quickly learns how to tame them. Back to the United States, Hao bleeds as a result of his Shikigami's defeat and remarks he didn't imagine anyone in the Asakura family could have such power. Meanwhile, Sharona is attacked by Tilda, a former school colleague and eternal rival, and has her guardian ghost, Enra Enra, stolen. Yoh's group reaches a Hot Spring district where they discuss the X-Laws and Yoh's supposed link to Hao. There, Tilda tries to lure each of them to an ambush using Enra-Enra's power of assuming anyone's form, but her cover is blown in every attempt, except when she manages to lure Lyserg using an image of an X-Laws' member Marco. However, Sharona and her friends arrive and defeat Tilda, retrieving Enra-Enra.

Somewhere else, the man seen in the end of the previous episode is seen again next to the spirit of the leader of Boris' parents killers. Later, Yoh and the others find a church where they plan to spend the night and Ryu watches a vampire movie. He ends up attacked by the man, who is revealed to be an actual vampire. Meanwhile, the X-Laws, aware of the presence of a follower of Hao in the area, isolate the town. Concerned with Lyserg, Milly enters the city, followed by Elly, but the rest is prevented from following them. Ren deduces Ryu was attacked by a shaman sent by Hao, but Tokageroh rejects the idea, stating that the attacker vanished in the air, which is not a human ability. Suddenly, Ryu awakes as a vampire and tries to attack Milly and Elly, but HoroHoro stops him with ice. Later, Lyserg mentions the story of Bram Stoker's Dracula, which Ren rejects as pure fiction. However, the church's priest tells the story of Vlad Dracula, the man who inspired the novel's title character. Later, the boys take turns in watching over Ryu. Lyserg approaches the X-Laws and asks them how to save Ryu, but the blond man replies that, in order to defeat Hao, he must stop regretting his beloved ones' death and even his own. Meanwhile, the ice keeping Ryu melts much before expected following a sabotage by a spirit working for the priest, who is revealed to be a shaman serving the vampire. Ryu breaks free and attacks HoroHoro, curing himself but turning his friend into a vampire. Following his conversation with the X-Laws, Lyserg emerges and attempts to kill HoroHoro, but Yoh stops him. Lyserg them asks Yoh to promise him he will kill him if he ever becomes a vampire. The priest lures Milly and Elly to a catacomb where he attempts to kill them, but he ends up killed by the vampire, who discards him as only human. Yoh and the others reach the place and the vampire introduces himself as Boris Tepes Dracula. He is capable of vanishing and materializing with incredible speed and eventually bites Lyserg. Meanwhile, the X-Laws march towards the church. In Japan, the elder woman seen with Yohmei at the end of episode 30 emerges and is revealed to be Kino, Yohmei's wife, and Yoh's grandmother.

Yoh and Ren join them to defeat the vampire while Milly and Elly head back outside where the X-Laws reveal their plan to exterminate everyone inside the cinema so that Boris is erased. However, the Lilly Five group (as Yoh now calls the five ladies) join forces to stop them following Milly's concern with Lyserg's possible death. Back inside, Ren deduces Boris is just a human with shamanic capabilities, explaining he just uses his guardian spirit to control other people and fool others into believing they are vampires, which explains why he can only control one victim at a time. Lyserg captures Yoh and Boris' guardian ghost, Blamuro, manifests himself. Boris corners Yoh's friends in a way that they must either stand still and die or escape and have Yoh bitten by Lyserg as a response. A third option would be to simply kill Lyserg and save Yoh. However, Yoh allows himself to be bitten and reveals he was embodied by Amidamaru, who subdued Blamuro when he attempted to take control of Yoh. Ren goes further on his deductions and realize Boris uses blood as a medium for spirits of bats, and his blood-soaked mantis the secret behind his ability to vanish. Ren finishes him off, but Blamuro stays to defend his master, to everyone's surprise. Blamuro explains he chased and killed Boris' parents out of obsession with defeating Vlad Dracula's descendants and being regarded as a hero. After realizing they were just ordinary humans, he spent his next years searching for Boris. He eventually found him as an adult standing by Hao and was killed to become his guardian ghost, which he happily accepted. Boris says he always thought he controlled Blamuro against his own will and leaves for the church, where he is attacked by the X-Laws. but Yoh defends him, saying he has his own reasons and justice is not about killing. He eventually says they are just like Hao, which infuriates them and ignites a lethal-force reaction. However, Boris sacrifices himself for Yoh and the X-Laws leave with their new recruit, Lyserg. By the church entrance, they find the Lilly Five passed out following the fight with the X-Laws, and Ryu tries to show him how cruel they can be towards Milly. as Lyserg replies that they received such treatment for being weak and ultimately leaves with his new group.

They end up meeting Chocolove, an Afro-American shaman who offers himself to be their new member since most shamans are travelling in groups to raise their chances of survival. He also says he is good in finding information, reveals he knows all their names and introduces Mick, the Jaguar, as his guardian spirit, which allows him to use its fine speed. However, he tells lots of unfunny jokes and does not seem strong, which causes the team to be reluctant about allowing him in the group. Chocolove explains he wants to be the Shaman King in order to become the world's greatest comedian and make it a better place with \"the winds of laughter\". Suddenly, Zenryou emerge and attack Yoh's group, but are easily and repeatedly dispatched by Ren. The group realizes something's wrong when they keep coming back after multiple defeats, showing inhuman endurance. Ren realizes they will have to kill both opponents to end the fight. Chocolove has a memory of his master back in New York City ending a hostage situation by simply telling the criminal a joke, which eventually caused him to peacefully surrender. Some time later, the master fell ill and died, leaving Mick as Chocolove's guardian spirit. Back to the present, Chocolove uses Mick's senses to uncover Peyote, one of Hao's followers. It is revealed that Zenryou are actually unconscious and their bodies are being controlled by Carlos and Juan, two Mariachis who are now Peyote's spirits. Chocolove dodges Zenryou's attacks and reaches Peyote, who reveals several other spirits: Antonio, José, Pancho, Zapata and Miguel. However, Chocolove uses his special attack, Ayers Rock, to make Peyote's spirits laugh and become vulnerable, allowing Ryu and HoroHoro to dispatch him. Later, Chocolove reveals a person named Lilirara lives in town and knows the location of the Patch Village. Meanwhile, the blond X-Laws member tells Lyserg he will take him to the clan's leader, Jeanne.

However, she tells them to go back home because the Patch prists lied to them and are organizing another Shaman Fight despite the \"tragedy\" brought during the previous one. Using the power of five Seminoa spirits, she has the group feel the pain they felt 500 years ago without actually hurting their bodies. At the boys' request, she uses her power to allow them to witness the Seminoa's memories of the last Shaman Fight 500 years ago. The group soon finds out the Seminoa fought and were killed by Hao's second and previous incarnation, which strongly resembled Silva. Looking for clues leading to the Patch Village, Yoh's group ask Lilirara to repeatedly send them back to the warrior's memories so they can collect as many info as possible. The group eventually questions why the warriors are willing to revive their own painful deaths over and over, and the Seminoa respond by engaging in a fight with them. Yoh and his friends manage to defeat them and they head to the other world, freeing Lilirara from the Seminoa obligations. On their way, they give them tips leading to the Patch Village. At the airport, Anna explains she invited Faust to join Yoh's group because he is strong and will become the doctor of the future Funbari Hot Spring she plans to build.

Soon later, Anna and her group stumble upon him and he explains he wants the Chou Senji Ryakketsu to be delivered as fast as possible to Yoh so he can become stronger and aid him in the future.

Meanwhile, from within her iron maiden, Jeanne tells Marco of the X-Laws he must check on Yoh before he comes into contact with Hao's power. In another dimension, the group travels through the mind and memories of the first incarnation of Hao, where he shows them his abilities and explains how shamans and normal humans are different and how humans are incapable of feeling, understanding and respecting the Earth's nature. In the end, he bestows them with his power. Meanwhile, Hao meets Manta next to the training site and gives him similar explanations, which disturbs Manta, since he is only human. The group comes back visibly shook-up. Suddenly, Jeanne, Lyserg and the blond X-Laws member drop from the sky and the latter puts the group to a sudden test, hitting them outright. The iron maiden face opens, revealing the face of a little girl inside, who smiles and closes the face again. The group easily blocked the attack using their new, powerful and still shadowy Over Souls. Following the brief fight, Hao comments to himself on Yoh's strength and everyone is excited with their new powers. Anna gives Yoh a small ancient sword sent by Yohmei.

Yoh contemplates his new sword while Amidamaru is still seemingly disturbed with something. Suddenly, he instinctively points the way to the Patch Village. Before they move, however, the female trio emerges and challenges them once again. Yoh, Ren and Ryu accept the challenge and this time the girls are easily overcome, despite the boys just using their ordinary Over Souls. Realizing the boys are much stronger, the girls unleash their Over Souls at full power, growing them to a gigantic size. The boys respond by revealing their new, also gigantic Over Souls and the two younger girls are defeated with just one hit each by Ren and Ryu. Yoh, however, is initially unable to precisely control his new over Soul against the older woman. Using his new sword combined with Harusame, however, he is able to finally defeat his opponent. Amidamaru feels he could become even greater and seems to be finally OK. At her church, Jeanne reveals her face again with another happy smile. The girls are visibly frustrated with their defeat, and Anna explains they will always be limited by Hao, while Yoh is free to grow endlessly. Hao suddenly materializes and congratulates Yoh on his evolution. He also says he will soon retrieve Yoh's body, which \"belongs to him\", and says farewell to his \"little brother\", shocking everyone.

However, Hao was born already too powerful and avoided the attack, severely burning Mikihisa in the process (which explains his bird mask). Before leaving, he warned them Yoh was his other half and he would return to retrieve it one day. Despite this, the family was happy, since Yoh's sacrifice was avoided. Meanwhile, Amidamaru starts a process of evolution after which he will reach a sacred spirit status. The X-Laws appear and Lyserg invites Yoh's group to join them to compensate for their sin of acquiring Hao's power and help Jeanne built the Gate of Babylon, which, according to them, will erase all evil from the Earth, including Hao.

Then, Jeanne tells the blond X-Laws member (now introduced as Marco) she is willing to meet Yoh personally to try and change him. Meanwhile, Yoh and the others reach a town filled with Shaman Fight participants. At a bar, Ren questions why so many shamans are gathered peacefully and a shaman next to them explains the town is being visited by many God-class Shamans and nobody would want to end up fighting one of them. He also says the Shaman King must be perfect in everything. Ren is disturbed and leaves, only to be approached by Hao and offered a place in his group, which he refuses. HoroHoro, Chocolove and Manta catch up with Ren and Hao leaves. The group is then mistaken for Hao's followers and attacked by two shamans accompanying the one who spoke to Ren before. He shows up and clears up the misunderstanding. Everyone notices a commotion nearby and find the Egyptian shamans shown in the beginning of the episode, now identified as the Niles, subduing Zenryou and intending to use them as baits to attract and defeat Hao. When the Niles' leader, Anatel, starts speaking in the name of God, Jeanne, Marco and Lyserg intervene and reprehend him for doing so. Anatel challenges them for a battle and Lyserg easily destroys Nahkt's and Khafre's (Anatel's best friends) over Souls and overpowers the trio's leader. After a bitter speech by Lyserg about justice which shocks his former teammates, Anatel breaks free and unleashes his over Soul formed by 10,000 feathers embodied by the souls of the ones who built the Pyramids. Unable to attack all feathers, Lyserg decides to apply lethal force in Anatel, but Yoh tells him not to do so and the attack stops. Lyserg tries to blame Morphine but Marco and Jeanne believe he hesitated. Jeanne then decides to personally finish the battle and finally steps out of her iron maiden. Everyone is shocked to see she is just a little girl embraced by thorny roots. She explains she chose to be trapped in the cage and to be continually pierced by the thorns so that she suffers for the sins of humankind and is given the strength to make the world a better place in return. Using her gigantic guardian spirit, Shamash, she easily subdues the Niles and offers them a chance of repentance. They refuse and are consequently executed. Later, Marco punishes Lyserg and says he deliberately stopped the attack after hearing Yoh.\n| LineColor           = 50A6C2\n}}\n| AltDate             = February 19, 2005\n| ShortSummary        = A little boy named Pino flees from a group of people who want to offer him to Badb and takes shelter inside an ice cave, where he meets the goddess in its crow form and is asked if he wants her to be his.

They are annoyed with Yoh's group talking about their recently increased powers and challenge them for a fight. Ryu, Faust and a reluctant Yoh become their opponents. The Icemen launch a combined attack, but Faust blocks it with his new Over Soul, Mephisto E. He then explains Anna has brought Eliza's spirit back in its whole form, allowing him to finally reunite with her. His purpose of life fulfilled, he swore loyalty to her and Yoh out of gratitude. Ryu also manages to block a combined attack and explains he will also protect Yoh and help him become Shaman King because he believes Yoh will create a better world.

Yoh tries to break the shield while a voice tells him to go away until he suddenly wakes up again next to Silva, who welcomes him to the Patch village. Yoh meets his friends (including Anna, Manta, Jun and Tamao, who reached the location via other means) and Hao approaches them, explaining that the column of light is the Great Spirit, an entity that gathers all formless souls and serves both as the source and final destination of all spirits on Earth. Goldva (the female leader of the Patches) announces the rules of the Second Round and all shamans must form groups of three in order to compete. Yoh teams up with Ryu and Faust and Ren forms a trio with HoroHoro and Chocolove. Yoh's friends also remind him of how he broke through the shield and found out the tree was just an illusion for the Great Spirit to bless him, an experience all his five friends had too.

Anna names Yoh's group as Funbari Onsen (in reference to the future hotel she plans to build), while Ren registers his group with HoroHoro and Chocolove as The Rens without consulting them, much to their dislike. Meanwhile, Jun is attacked by the two kids, but Ren and Gei - who is revealed to be their older sister - intervene and stop them. Gei explains she wants revenge on Ren for having rejected his responsibilities as Tao's heir, which lead to her being discarded by the family, and says she will do so in their match, scheduled for the day after. Later, Jun remarks that by giving up on Tao's legacy, she and Ren have led many people to lose their positions and that they are indeed traitors to many. As the battle starts, Ren tells his partners to stay back and barely defends himself, allowing several hits by Team Noroshi. Yoh deduces he is allowing his body to take all the hatred from Gei's heart. Ren finally apologizes to them and promises to extinguish all their hatred once he becomes Shaman King.

The team discusses the situation while a frog-faced humanoid figure stands above their room, unbeknownst to them. Meanwhile, Nichrom and several shamans are seen flocking to a temple where they bow before Nyorai, who is accompanied by three fighters.

Fudou tries to capture Amidamaru, who offers no resistance. Amidamaru explains he was out of control just after death and had his spirit pacified and his grave crafted by a figure using Fudou's powers, which is why he is not willing to fight her back and even agrees with her that he possessed Yoh and forced him to fight. Yoh replies that they are actually friends and that Yoh lends his body to Amidamaru in exchange for his power. Fudou then orders the Mosuke-possessed Manta to attack them.
