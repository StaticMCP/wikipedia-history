A short heritage railway line is operated by the Nelson Railway Society.  Several shops operate in the museum, selling bakery and other artisan foods, as well as locally made arts & crafts.\nHistory\nFounders Heritage Park was set up largely by community effort via Founders Inc. in 1977 and opened to the public in 1986. The buildings it houses are a mix of donated original buildings and historic replicas constructed with the help of local companies. Most of the historic collections have been donated by Nelson residents.\nThe ownership and management of the park transferred to Nelson City Council in 1995. The park also hosts events such as craft and book fairs.\nSee also\n* List of New Zealand railway museums and heritage lines\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.founderspark.co.nz/ Founders Heritage Park]"
