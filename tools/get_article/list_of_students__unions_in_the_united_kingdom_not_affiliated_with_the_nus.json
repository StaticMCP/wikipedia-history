Around five per cent of student unions in the UK are not affiliated with the NUS, including 2 students' unions (8%) who represent Russell Group Universities (the Aldwych Group). Some of the institutions have disaffiliated from the NUS, whereas others such as those in the previous Scottish Ancients Group (see: Coalition of Higher Education Students in Scotland) have never been affiliated.\nDurham Students' Union voted to disaffiliate in March 2010 but subsequently voted to reaffiliate in January 2011. Oxford University Student Union was reported as having voted to disaffiliate in 2014, but this was overturned after voting irregularities were uncovered. Four unions voted to leave the national body in 2016 Lincoln, Newcastle, Hull and Loughborough (Lincoln later rejoined but has since again disaffiliated).\nIn 2022, Reading University Student Union voted to leave the national body  citing a lack of representation and concerns over the direction of the NUS.
