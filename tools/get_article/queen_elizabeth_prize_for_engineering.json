The prize was launched in 2012 by a cross-party group consisting of David Cameron, Nick Clegg, and Ed Miliband, then respectively Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition of the United Kingdom. The £500,000 prize, and 3D printed trophy, are awarded annually in the name of Queen Elizabeth II (the prize was biennial until 2021).\nThe prize is run by the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering Foundation, a charitable company. The Foundation is chaired by Sir Patrick Vallance, with Yewande Akinola, John Hennessy, Anji Hunter, Robert Langer, Professor Sir Jim McDonald and Dame Anne Richards serving as trustees. The QEPrize is funded by donations from the following international companies: BAE Systems, BP, GSK, Hitachi Ltd., Jaguar Land Rover, National Grid, Nissan Motor Corporation, Shell, Siemens UK, Sony, Tata Consultancy Services, Tata Steel and Toshiba.\nThe Prize\nThe Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering is awarded for engineering-led advances that are judged to be of tangible and widespread benefit to the public. The foundation invites nominations from the public, engineering and science academies, universities, research organisations, and commercial organisations from anywhere in the world; self-nomination is not permitted, and the prize is not awarded posthumously.\nThe judging panel works from the information provided in the nomination, comments from referees and any additional information required in order to establish which nomination most fully meets the following prize criteria:\n# What is it that this person has done (or up to five people have done) that is a ground-breaking innovation in engineering?\n# In what way has this innovation been of global benefit to humanity?\n# Is there anyone else who might claim to have had a pivotal role in this development?\nThe winner(s) of the QEPrize are announced every year by the Chairman of the QEPrize Foundation. In the first four prize cycles, this announcement was held at the Royal Academy of Engineering and was attended by members of the British Royal Family. The QEPrize award ceremony takes place in the same year as the announcement. The QEPrize trophy is designed by the winner of the Create the Trophy competition, presented to the winner(s) by a member of the Royal Family. In the first two prize cycles, the trophy was presented by the Queen. In subsequent cycles, the trophy has been presented by the King, formally the Prince of Wales.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 40px;\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 130px;\" | Invention\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 130px;\" | Recipient(s)\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 130px;\" | Nationality\n! scope=\"col\"  | Notes\n|-\n! rowspan=\"5\" |2013\n| rowspan=\"5\" |The Internet and the World Wide Web\n|Robert Kahn\n|\n| rowspan=\"5\" |The inaugural prize was awarded to the five engineers responsible for the creation of the Internet and the World Wide Web.
