The cemetery contains 46 known Commonwealth war graves, 1 Czech grave, and 1 unknown British grave.\nHistory\nThe majority of the soldiers interred in the cemetery were killed in June and July 1944 as the Allies pushed south of Bayeux and then south-west to encircle Caen. Many casualties were involved in fighting around Tilly-sur-Seulles.\nThe graveyard has two chaplains interred in it; Reverend Cecil James Hawksworth and Reverend Gerard Nesbit and the grave of the youngest British soldier killed in Normandy, 16-year-old Private Jack Banks of the Durham Light Infantry.\nThis cemetery was the first Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery in France to have a Cross of Sacrifice erected.\nLocation\nThe cemetery is on the D.6, 9 kilometres south-east of Bayeux, close to the commune of Choain.\nGallery\nFile:FranceNormandieChouainCimetiereMilitaire.jpg|Gravestones in Jerusalem cemetery\nFile:Chouain - CWGC - soldat tchèque.JPG|Grave of Czech soldier\nFile:Chouain - CWGC - Jack Banks.JPG|Grave of 16-year-old Private Banks\nFile:Jerusalem War Cemetery -11.JPG|Cross of Sacrifice\nSee also\n* American Battle Monuments Commission\n* UK National Inventory of War Memorials\n* German War Graves Commission\n* List of military cemeteries in Normandy\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Shilleto, Carl, and Tolhurst, Mike (2008).
