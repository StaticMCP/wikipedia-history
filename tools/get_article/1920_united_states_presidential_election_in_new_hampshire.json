Harding\n| after_party = Republican Party (United States)\n}}\nThe 1920 United States presidential election in New Hampshire took place on November 2, 1920, as part of the 1920 United States presidential election which was held throughout all contemporary 48 states. Voters chose four representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nNew Hampshire voted for Republican nominee, Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio, over the Democratic nominee, Governor James M. Cox of Ohio. Harding ran with Governor Calvin Coolidge of Massachusetts, while Cox ran with Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt of New York.\nHarding won New Hampshire by a margin of 20.45%. His victory in the New England states was helped by the local popularity of his running mate, Calvin Coolidge, a traditional New England Yankee born in the small-town of Plymouth Notch in neighboring Vermont, who had started his political career in neighboring Massachusetts as its governor. Despite this, New Hampshire would be Cox's second-strongest antebellum free state after Indiana by popular vote percentage and the third-strongest after Indiana and Cox's Ohio in terms of percentage margin.\nNew Hampshire voted 5.72% more Democratic than the nation at-large – which is the most Democratic relative to the nation that New Hampshire has ever voted since the Republican Party was founded. Although Cox carried no counties, Hillsborough and longtime national bellwether Coös would prove his strongest counties in New England.\nResults\n}}\nResults by county\n{|width=\"70%\" class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |County\n! colspan=\"2\" |Warren Gamaliel HardingRepublican\n! colspan=\"2\" |James Middleton CoxDemocratic\n! colspan=\"2\" |Eugene Victor DebsSocialist\n! colspan=\"2\" |Margin\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Total votes cast\n|- bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"\n! #\n! %\n! #\n! %\n! #\n! %\n! #\n! %\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  | Belknap\n|  | 5,628\n|  | 61.74%\n|  | 3,464\n|  | 38.00%\n|  | 23\n|  | 0.25%\n|  | 2,164\n|  | 23.74%\n|  | 9,115\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  | Carroll\n|  | 4,214\n|  | 64.73%\n|  | 2,279\n|  | 35.01%\n|  | 17\n|  | 0.26%\n|  | 1,935\n|  | 29.72%\n|  | 6,510\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  | Cheshire\n|  | 6,644\n|  | 65.83%\n|  | 3,374\n|  | 33.43%\n|  | 74\n|  | 0.73%\n|  | 3,270\n|  | 32.40%\n|  | 10,092\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  | Coös\n|  | 6,114\n|  | 54.45%\n|  | 4,985\n|  | 44.40%\n|  | 129\n|  | 1.15%\n|  | 1,129\n|  | 10.06%\n|  | 11,228\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  | Grafton\n|  | 9,650\n|  | 61.10%\n|  | 6,102\n|  | 38.63%\n|  | 42\n|  | 0.27%\n|  | 3,548\n|  | 22.46%\n|  | 15,794\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  | Hillsborough\n|  | 23,040\n|  | 54.44%\n|  | 18,736\n|  | 44.27%\n|  | 546\n|  | 1.29%\n|  | 4,304\n|  | 10.17%\n|  | 42,322\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  | Merrimack\n|  | 12,748\n|  | 58.28%\n|  | 8,976\n|  | 41.04%\n|  | 148\n|  | 0.68%\n|  | 3,772\n|  | 17.25%\n|  | 21,872\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  | Rockingham\n|  | 13,811\n|  | 67.29%\n|  | 6,582\n|  | 32.07%\n|  | 132\n|  | 0.64%\n|  | 7,229\n|  | 35.22%\n|  | 20,525\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  | Strafford\n|  | 8,700\n|  | 60.37%\n|  | 5,643\n|  | 39.15%\n|  | 69\n|  | 0.48%\n|  | 3,057\n|  | 21.21%\n|  | 14,412\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  |Sullivan\n|  | 4,647\n|  | 64.35%\n|  | 2,521\n|  | 34.91%\n|  | 54\n|  | 0.75%\n|  | 2,126\n|  | 29.44%\n|  | 7,222\n|-\n!Totals!!95,196!!59.84%!!62,662!!39.39%!!1,234!!0.78%!!32,534!!20.45%!!159,092\n|}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in New Hampshire\nReferences"
