The Cholas had then captured 12,000 Sinhalese and took them to South India. Pujawaliya mentioned that the captives were deployed in manual work in Kaveri river, India.\nKing Gajabahu I, the son of King Vanakatissa, who succeeded his father, was furious over this matter and he invaded the Chola kingdom in South India to bring back his people.\nThe invasion of the Chola\nGajabahu is said to have walked across the Palk Strait by beating the water with a huge iron mace and invaded the Chola capital, struck terror into the king of Chola and seated himself on the throne like a king. Gajabahu demanded that the Cholas return back the 12000 Sinhalese and provide an equal number of Chola people. The Chola King had no choice but to comply with Gajabahu’s request.\nAftermath\nGajabahu brought 12,000 Cholas as slaves to Sri Lanka. They were settled in Alutkuruva, Egodatiha, Harasiya pattuva, Hevaheta, Megodatiha, Pansiya - pattuva, Tumpane, Udunuwara and Yatinuwara. His own men were sent home as free men to their respective families.\nGajabahu was also able to recover Buddhas bowl relic which was taken by invaders Previously and also brought Goddess pattini jewelled anklet.\nLegacy\nThe exploits credited to him in Chola country matched that of 'Rajavali' written later further embellished the story. Pattini cult is mentioned only after him. But the fact that a Tamil poem( Chilappathikaram )500 years after his time, singled out Gajabahu's name, indicates that his fame had reached South India. King Cenkuttuvan mentioned in the poem was a contemporary of the Chola King Karikala who is said to have constructed the dykes of the Kaveri river, by Kings whom he had subdued. Therefore it can be assumed that Karikala and Cenkuttuvan were rivals. Gajabahu when he invaded India to get his people working under Karikala, would have found a friend in Cekuttuvan of Chera. Pujavali also records that Gajabahu took effective measures of guarding the coast of Sri Lanka to prevent any hostile action from South India, which would mean that he developed the naval powers of his kingdom. The name 'Gaja' bahu (elephant arm) is quite uncommon in Sri Lanka. It could be a fact that he really earned it by prowess in war.\nLegend or a Real event\nSir Senerath Paranavithana response on the event “ Gajabahu is the only king of ancient Ceylon who has found a place in early Tamil literature, and it is not impossible that he undertook an expedition to South India. At any rate, his military prowess is attested by his title of Gajabahu (whose arm is of the strength of an elephant), by which he is better known than by his personal name of Gamani Abhaya”\nAccording to Sir Krishnaswami Aiyangar “ When we come to Gajabahu, the Mahavamsa itself has not much to say about his connection with India, but the other chronicles of Ceylon do state that he found it necessary to go to war, as on a previous occasion the Tamils invaded the island and carried away as many as twelve thousand inhabitants of Ceylon to work \" in the city of the Kaveri.\" This story seems to have relation to the building of the magnificent city of Kaveripattanam or Puhar by the Chola king Karikala. While there may be much that is historical in this body of Ceylon tradition, we cannot say we are on sure historical ground ; but from Karikala backwards, we have the names of some of the Chola rulers and references to some of their wars in classical Tamil literature itself”\nAccording to Sir William Meyer “  There is a belief that as a measure of retaliation for the Chola invasion of Ceylon by Karikala, the Ceylon king Gajabahu (A.D. 174-96) took 12,000 captives of war to Ceylon, and settled them in the island. The places in which they were setiled are stated to have been Harispattu, Tumpane, Alutukuruwa, Udunuwara, Yatinuwar, Sarasiya pattuva etc.' There is no reason to disbelieve the historicity of this account of the settlements given by the Rajavaliya, although the number of people settled was perhaps exaggerated”\nAccording to Sir V Kanakasabhai “ The Mahawansa was composed in the fifth century A. D. and the Dipavanso still earlier ; and both these historical works mention Gajabahu I. It appears that during the reign of his father  crooked nosed Tissa, a Chola king had invaded Ceylon, and carried away several thousands of captives ; and that in retaliation Gajabahu invaded the Chola dominions soon after his accession to the throne in a. d. 143 The tradition is that the captives were carried away to work on the banks of the river Kaviri, which were then under construction. This is quite in accordance with later Tamil poems and inscriptions\" which speak of Karikal Chôla as the king who commenced the construction of the high banks along both sides of the bed of the Kaviri. The construction of the Kaviri banks which extended along its course to a distance of about 100 miles from its mouth, was an undertaking of such magnitude that it could not have been completed during the reign of Karikal. The Chôla King, who invaded Ceylon in order to procure captives to work at the banks, might have been therefore Karikal or his immediate successor. This tradition is further evidence of the fact that Chenkudduva Chera was contemporary with Gajabahu I. who lived in the early part of the second century A. D.”\nMajority of historians consider this as a real event but some information regarding this event might be exaggerated.\nReferences"
