He was also a frequent contributor to the magazine White Dwarf during his first stint at the company.\nIn May 2014, Ward left Games Workshop and worked for a time as a novelist. He returned to Games Workshop in 2016; his two year hiatus was allegedly due to him receiving many death threats over his writing.\nBibliography\n* A Matter of Belief (novella, 2014)\n* Brazen Dreams (short story, 2015)\n* The Bargain (short story, 2015)\n* Frostgrave: Second Chances: A Tale of the Frozen City (novel, 2017)\n* Frostgrave: Oathgold: A Tale of the Frozen City (novel, 2018)\n* Legacy of Ash (novel, 2019)\n* Legacy of Steel (novel, 2020)\n* Legacy of Light (novel, 2021)\nGames Workshop\n* Army Book: Daemons of Chaos (2008)\n* Warhammer 40,000 Rulebook, 5th Edition (2008)\n* Codex: Space Marines (2008)\n* Codex: Blood Angels (2010)\n* Warhammer Fantasy Rulebook, 8th Edition (2010)\n* Codex: Grey Knights (2011)\n* Army Book: Dark Elves (2012)\n* Army Book: Daemons of Chaos (2013)\nVideo games\n* Warhammer: End Times – Vermintide (2015)\n* Warhammer: Vermintide 2 (2018)\n* Battlefleet Gothic: Armada 2 (2019)\n* Warhammer 40,000: Darktide (2022)\nReferences\n* Priestley, Rick; et al.
