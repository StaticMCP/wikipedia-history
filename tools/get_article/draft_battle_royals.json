Utilizing basic card decks and dice common to Dungeons and Dragons or other dice games.\nThe overall idea is to have a duel style game that is easy to set up and learn. With only eighteen rules, introduction is a quick process and players may be able to be proficient in two or three Sessions.\nStructure\nSet up requires separating cards into their respective suits with face cards in their own stack. Primary stats consist of Hearts(&#x2665;)as Hit points, Spades(&#x2660;) as Defense points and Diamonds(&#x2666;)as Attack points. Clubs(&#x2663;)are used to determine which player may take their turn by way of highest card, turns are NOT sequential and players may not have a turn for multiple draws. Three face cards are drawn by each player from their respective deck and then one of each \"stat\"(&#x2666;&#x2665;&#x2660;) cards is drawn for each unit, each unit must have one of each stat to be considered ready for battle. Players then draw the top card from the \"chance\"(&#x2663;) or clubs deck, the player with the high card decides their attacking unit and the target enemy unit. The attacking unit must defeat the defending units defense(&#x2660;) rating, the difference is the applied to hit points as damage. A unit is defeated when hit point reach zero, once defeated the unit is placed in the graveyard&#x1f9b4;. The game ends when one player stands the victor, or annihilation by world monster.\nUnits\nUnits have a bonus to their stats based upon suit and rank. All units have special abilities which will be covered further on.\nThe Kings.&#x2666;&#x2665;&#x2663;&#x2660;+3\nKing units have a plus three to the suit which they belong, exception in the king of clubs who has a bonus to attack points. On player turn the king may draw another stat card of the suit it belongs to.\nThe Queens.&#x2666;&#x2665;&#x2663;&#x2660;+2\nQueen units have a plus two to the suit they belong, exception in the queen of clubs which has a bonus to defense points. On player turn the queen may summon a dead king from the graveyard allowing drawing three more stat cards for the queen. The king is undead and provides no bonus itself.\nThe Jacks.&#x2666;&#x2665;&#x2663;&#x2660;+1\nJack units have a plus one to the suit they belong, exception in the jack of clubs which has a bonus to hit points. On player turn the jack may parry on the roll of Twenty side dice if it is attacked, eleven or more is a parry.\nThe Joker.\nJoker units are world monsters, players may opt to not have joker in play, the world monster fights all players in order of lowest health to highest. When drawn the monster is placed in the center of all players and steals the top card of each stat deck from all players, thus the monster strength grows with the number of players. If the monster is not strong enough to defeat a units defense, fifty percent is reflected back to the monster.\nRules\nHistory\nThe Rules have Changed overtime, the first version had the potential to end in stalemate due to a lack of inequality.
