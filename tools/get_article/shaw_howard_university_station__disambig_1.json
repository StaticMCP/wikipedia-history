The station primarily serves Washington's Shaw neighborhood, the home of Howard University.\nThe station is located within the neighborhood of the same name in the Northwest quadrant of the city, on 7th Street between R and S Streets. It lies just outside the defined boundaries of the Shaw Historic District, which encompasses much the area to the southwest.\nTransit-oriented development\nLike other stations along the stretch of the Green Line between  and , Shaw has been revitalized by transit-oriented development, increasing economic development, residential density, and—controversially—accelerating the pace of gentrification.\nAmong other projects, Progression Place and CityMarket at O catalyzed development in the area in the early 2010s. The former occupies previously vacant land on the same block as the northern entrance to the station. It contains  of office space (with the UNCF being the anchor tenant), 205 apartments labeled as \"7th Flats,\" and  of retail.\nCityMarket at O, located between 7th, 9th, O, and P Streets NW, renovated the long-neglected O Street Market and added  of retail and 629 residential units.\nHistory\nPart of the original Metro plan, the station was initially referred to simply as \"Shaw\". It opened on May 11, 1991, as part of a northward extension of the Green Line from Gallery Place–Chinatown to U Street. The central route under 7th Street, below which the station sits, was added in 1967 primarily to serve the \"inner city.\" The downtown segment of the line was initially projected to open in September 1977, but the first Green Line stations did not open until 1991. While a cut-and-fill tunnel for the Green Line was built under 7th Street and U Street, maintaining vehicle traffic and pedestrian access on those streets was difficult.\nOn May 7, 2023, the northeastern terminus of the Yellow Line was truncated from  to , following its reopening after a nearly eight-month-long major rehabilitation project on its bridge over the Potomac River and its tunnel leading into . Thus, it no longer services this station. Some Yellow Line service is expected be re-extended to Greenbelt in December 2025.\nStation layout\nLike most underground Metro stations, Shaw–Howard University is an island-platformed station lying directly below street level. There are two entrances, one to the north at the corner of 7th and S Streets and the other to the south on R Street between 7th and 8th Streets. The station features the 22-coffer \"waffle\" ceiling vault design among , , , , and .\nReferences\nExternal links\n* The Schumin Web Transit Center: [https://web.archive.org/web/20110524195332/http://transit.schuminweb.com/transit/wmata/green-line.php?station=E02 Shaw–Howard Univ Station]\n* [https://www.google.com/maps/@38.9146297,-77.0219478,3a,75y,127.55h,88.19t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1smhns5w6RBlqkvht0OIXQ3A!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en S Street entrance from Google Maps Street View]\n* [https://www.google.com/maps/@38.912635,-77.0227462,3a,75y,34.11h,87.16t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sp3wTz1YfLdT8HiXA8HUOOQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en R Street entrance from Google Maps Street View]"
