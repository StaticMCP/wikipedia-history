Edwin Booth, a Cos Cob, Connecticut resident, is said to have acted in that theater. The nearby Grand Opera House, which stood on the site of the Palace Theatre, burned down as well.\nThe Alhambra Theatre was on what is currently called Washington Boulevard, which later sprang up and was in operation as early as 1909. It provided \"High-Class Vaudeville\", namely due to its lack of profanity. In 1914, Emily Wakeman Hartley founded the Stamford Theatre at the corner of what is now Atlantic Street and Tresser Boulevard. Wakeman became manager of the theater, which hosted many famous performers of the day. Most notably in 1924, Humphrey Bogart acted in a supporting role in the comedy, ''Fool's Gold. In 1927, Bela Lugosi starred in Dracula: The Vampire Play'' four years before he played the same role in the film. George Gershwin's first Broadway show, La La Lucille played in the theater in 1919, and in 1921, the Al Jolson-produced play, Lei Aloha opened at the theater, six years before Jolson's debut in The Jazz Singer. In 1928, the theater advertised a Sunday performance of the \"World's Greatest Pianist\", Sergei Rachmaninoff, calling him simply \"Rachmaninoff\".\nCurrent theatre and film venues\n*'Stamford Center for the Arts: The Palace Theatre, originally opened as a vaudeville house in 1927 and gradually fell into disrepair and disuse, reopened as a restored, nonprofit theater in 1983. It was joined in 1992 by the Rich Forum, another downtown venue. Both have been run by the Stamford Center for the Arts. In 2005, the Palace Theatre completed a major renovation. With the depth doubled behind the stage to about , the 1,600-seat theater can now present more technically ambitious productions such as full-fledged Broadway musicals.\n*Rich Forum: Built-in 1992, the Rich Forum has served as a pre-Broadway house for numerous shows including Voices in the Dark, Fortune's Fool, and More to Love. Since 2009, the Rich Forum has served as the studio for The Jerry Springer Show, Maury, and The Steve Wilkos Show, among other NBCUniversal shows.\n*Curtain Call Inc. presents plays and other entertainment at the Sterling Farms Theatre Complex, 1349 Newfield Ave. Its venues and types of entertainment there include the Kweskin Theatre and Shakespeare in the Park.\n*[http://www.avontheatre.org/ Avon Theatre Film Center], a nonprofit movie house focusing on classic, alternative, and art films, opened in the former Avon Theatre on Bedford Street in 2004.\n*Bowtie Theatres has two movie houses in Stamford with 15 movie screens: the Landmark and the Majestic.\n*In Springdale, the two-screen , run by Garden Homes Cinemas of Stamford, has second-run films.\n*Mill River Park and Commons Park in Harbor Point both have summer \"Movies in the Park\" lineups\nMusic and dance\n*[http://www.stamfordsymphony.org/ Stamford Symphony Orchestra] In a typical season, the SSO gives five pairs of classical concerts and three pops concerts at the 1,586-seat Palace Theatre, as well as a concert for elementary school students and a family concert series.

In 1967 the orchestra was revived and became fully professional by 1974, when Skitch Henderson was appointed music director.

It established the first small planetarium between New York and Boston in 1941 when it had a 6-inch (wide) telescope and a dome made of wood slats and cardboard. In the 1950s, the museum had to move again when Interstate 95 was built, and it went to a  site at the northern end of town. It has a collection of works by Gutzon Borglum, the sculptor of Mount Rushmore, who was a Stamford resident for a decade.\n:\n::The nature center's farm includes llamas, pigs, and sheep.
