From 1906 to 1915, the \"Crickets\" played as members of the Southern Michigan League for the duration of the league, winning the 1913 league championship. The Battle Creek Crickets teams hosted their home minor league games at Athletic Park.\nHistory\n1906 season\nAfter minor league baseball began in Battle Creek in 1895, with the Battle Creek \"Adventists,\" who played the season as members of the Class B level Michigan State League, the Crickets were immediately preceded by the 1902 Battle Creek \"Cero Frutos,\" who played one season in returning to the Michigan State League.\nOn January 29, 1906, the Southern Michigan League was formed at a meeting in held in Battle Creek. Joe Jackson, the sports editor of the Detroit Free Press newspaper was named as league president. The schedule called for each team to play three league games a week, with a salary limit of $800 per month per team. On February 19, 1906, the National Commission awarded the Michigan cities of Jackson and Kalamazoo to the newly formed Southern Michigan League, after the existing Interstate Association had first claimed the Kalamazoo franchise for that league.\nIn 1906, the Battle Creek Crickets became charter members of the six–team Class D level Southern Michigan League, also called the \"Southern Michigan Association\". The Jackson Convicts, Kalamazoo White Sox, Mount Clemens Bathers, Saginaw and Tecumseh Indians teams joined Battle Creek in beginning league play on May 6, 1906.\nOn May 5, 1906, Battle Creek beat the \"Burroughs Adding Machine\" team from Detroit by the score of 9-2. There were an estimated\n1,000 fans at Battle Creek. At their home opener on May 15, 1906, the Crickets defeated beat Kalamazoo 7-4 in front of 2,400 fans.\nDuring the season, on June 27, 1906, Battle Creek manager George Black, was arrested in Mt. Clemens for allegedly punching Umpire O’Connor. An arbiter refused to file a complaint against Black, so the case was dismissed.\nBattle Creek began the season playing poorly. On July 16, 1906, after their poor start, Battle Creek released almost its entire roster, keeping only three players: Jack Landry, Mike Keveney and Waddell. Battle Creek then acquired some players from the folded Flint Vehicles, following the demise of the Interstate Association weeks earlier. Despite the team's performance on the field, Battle Creek had the league’s best attendance totals, often exceeding attendance of 2,000 for Sunday games.\nOn July 18, 1906, after the Southern Michigan League began league play, the Saginaw team was added to the league. Saginaw was given a record of 15-20 when added to the league, with Battle Creek then given an identical record to Saginaw. On July 21, 1906, the Battle Creek record of 4-38 was expunged and the reorganized team was awarded a record of 15-20 on July 22. The teams' records were adjusted to enhance league balance and competitiveness. The Battle Creek and Saginaw teams were granted an “average start on an even basis,” where both teams’ won-loss records were recalculated using an average of the league’s standings - a record halfway between the first and last place clubs.\nIn their first season of play, the Crickets ended the 1906 season with the adjusted record of 39–56 to place fifth in the final Southern Michigan League standings. Managed by Cal Wenger, Joe Ganzel, Mo Meyers and George Black, Battle Creek finished 26.0 games behind the first place Mount Clemens Bathers. Mount Clemens (69-34) was followed by the second place Kalamazoo White Sox (63–41), who were followed by the Tecumseh Indians (57–47), Jackson Convicts (52–52), Battle Creek Crickets (39–56) and Saginaw (34–60).\n1907 to 1910 seasons\nThe Battle Creek Crickets continued play in the 1907 eight-team Southern Michigan League and placed third in the standings as the league expanded to eight teams. During the 1907 season, shortstop/manager William \"Curly\" Henderson was suspended for the remainder of the season on suspicion of purposefully throwing a game with a wild throw to George Deneau playing first base. Henderson claimed that the ball went only a foot above Deneau's head and should have been caught. The Crickets ended the season with a record of 63-49 playing the season under managers Henderson and George Deneau. The Tecumseh Indians won the league championship as the league played the remainder of the season with seven teams after Jackson folded during the season.\nOn April 26, 1908, the Battle Creek Crickets played their first exhibition game against the local Battle Creek Independents team.\nIn the 1908 Southern Michigan League standings, Battle Creek placed fifth in the eight-team league as the Jackson Convicts returned to play. Jackson and Battle Creek would play in every season of the league. Battle Creek ended the season with a record of 62–63, led by returning player/ managers William Henerson and George Deneau. The Crickets finished the season 10.5 games behind the first place Saginaw Wa-was, as the league held no playoffs.\nThe Crickets finished last in the eight-team 1909 Southern Michigan League, which held no playoffs.
