In 1969, the choir led to the establishment of the Newark Boys Chorus School. The group tours regularly in the United States and abroad.\nDebut\nThe chorus was formed with the New Jersey Symphony who needed “angels’ voices” for the “Dance of the Snowflakes” in their production of Tchaikowsky’s “The Nutcracker”. It was James R. McCarthy who undertook the task and found 66 “angels” for use in the production. On December 26, 1966, the chorus finally joined the New Jersey Symphony and the Garden State Ballet in a complete production of the Nutcracker.\nThe chorus’s debut performance at Newark Symphony Hall was so successful and received such critical acclaim, that additional performances were demanded, which ultimately led to the opening of the Newark Boys Choir School on September 15, 1969. In September 1972, the school adopted the name Newark Boys Choir, which later became the Newark Boys Chorus School.\nPerformances and guest appearances\nThe group's music includes traditional classical music, spirituals, folk music, and jazz.

The chorus is also involved in many boychoir festivals across the east coast including The Georgia Boy Choir Festival, the Maryland State Boychoir Festival, and Keystone State Boy choir's  B1K (Boy choir of One-thousand), a boychoir festival which consist of one thousand male singers, most of whom are a part of boy choirs throughout the United States.\nIn the 1970s  the group commissioned works by Gian Carlo Menotti and Peter Mennin which premiered at Alice Tully Hall. and recorded the Blue Öyster Cult song, \"The Golden Age of Leather\", on their album Spectres. In October 2007, the Chorus sang in the first public performance at the new Prudential Center.
