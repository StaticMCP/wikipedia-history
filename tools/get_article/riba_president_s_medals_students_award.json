Participation is by direct invitation only to over 500 schools of architecture located in 100 countries. Schools are invited to nominate up to 2 entries for the Bronze Medal, up to 2 entries for the Silver Medal, and 1 entry for the Dissertation Medal. In 2024, a record 372 entries were received from 118 schools located in 36 countries.\nHistory\nThe RIBA President's Medals have been awarded annually since 1836, the year when George Godwin was awarded the Honorary Silver Medal for his essay 'Nature and Properties of Concrete, and its Application to Construction up to the Current Period'. Medals are awarded in three categories: the Bronze Medal for best design project at RIBA Part 1 or equivalent; the Silver Medal for best design project at RIBA Part 2 or equivalent; and the Dissertation Medal (written during either Part 1 or Part 2). The judges also award up to five commendations in each category, the Awards for Sustainable Design, and the Serjeant Awards for Excellence in Drawing.\nAs the RIBA's oldest awards (preceding the Royal Gold Medal, formally established in 1848), the RIBA President's Medals embody the RIBA's commitment to architecture and the education of individuals into understanding architecture's wider social benefits.\nJudging\nAn international jury of architects, designers and artists select the winners from entries submitted by schools of architecture worldwide. Former judges include Cedric Price, David Adjaye, David Chipperfield, Denys Lasdun, Daniel Libeskind, Ian Ritchie, Michael Hopkins, Simon Hudspith, Eva Jiricna, Will Alsop, Bob Allies, Kazuyo Sejima, Patrick Schumacher, Ken Shuttleworth, Benedetta Tagliabue, Ian Davidson, Bruce McLean, Odile Decq, Lella Vignelli, Farshid Moussavi, Nanako Umemoto, Nathalie de Vries, Eric Parry, Vicky Richardson, Ellen Van Loon, Catherine Slessor, Harriet Harriss, Hamza Shaikh, and Julia B. Bolles-Wilson.\nCeremony\nThe winners receive their awards from the RIBA President at a ceremony held at the RIBA in early December of each year. Guest speakers have included Norman Foster, Richard Rogers, Mark Lawson, Richard MacCormac, Paul Smith, Martha Schwartz, and Alex James.\nExhibition\nAn exhibition of winning work and selected entries is exhibited at the RIBA HQ in London for two months before touring throughout the UK and internationally. Over the last few years, and after closing in London, the President's Medals exhibition has been displayed in the UK (Belfast, Bournemouth, Canterbury, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leicester, Liverpool, Newcastle, and Plymouth) and also travelled internationally to Australia, Bulgaria, Chile, China, Cyprus, Egypt, Finland, France, Hong Kong, Kuwait, India, Ireland, Lebanon, Malaysia, Oman, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. The touring of the exhibition is made possible by the generosity of art galleries and schools of architecture that partner with the RIBA to display the exhibition.\nWinners\nSilver Medal:\n* 2024: Joe
