The surprised Apaches, led by Mangas Coloradas, were quickly defeated in a short close quarters action. Four warriors were killed, and an unknown number were wounded. The settlers' casualties are unknown, if any at all. Thirteen women and children were captured and several warriors fled, leaving their families behind. Mangas Coloradas survived. The Americans recovered some of their livestock.\nSee also\n*American Indian Wars\n*Capture of Tucson (1862)\nReferences\n*Cochise, Ciyé \"The First Hundred Years of Nino Cochise\"  New York: Pyramid Books 1972\n*Lavender, David.
