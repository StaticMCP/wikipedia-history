The boundaries varied over time, but in general the parish stretched east from London Bridge past Tower Bridge to St Saviour's Dock. Southwark St Olave and St Thomas replaced the civil parish in 1896. It was abolished in 1904 and absorbed by Bermondsey parish.\nBoundary changes\nSouthwark St Olave formed part of the ancient Borough of Southwark. Part of its area was split off around 1550 to create Southwark St Thomas, corresponding to the hospital of the Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1733, part of area was used to create Southwark St John Horsleydown.\nAdministration\nThe parish became, with St John Horsleydown and St Thomas, part of the St Olave Poor Law Union and in 1855 it became part of the St Olave District of the Metropolis. It was absorbed by the County of London in 1889.\nIn 1896 St Olave was abolished as a civil parish and was combined again with Southwark St Thomas to form Southwark St Olave and St Thomas. In 1900 the combined parish became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Bermondsey and was abolished in 1904, with its former area absorbed into the Bermondsey civil parish, as was that of St John Horsleydown.\nThe ecclesiastical parish of St Olave was abolished in 1947, and then formed part of Southwark St Olave and St John.\nNotable people\nAgnes Cowper was born here in about 1559 and lived here and in a surrounding parish. She is notable because a detailed account of her life was recorded. She died after 1619.\nSee also\n* Tooley Street is the main thoroughfare of the parish and that article covers much of the secular history of the area\nReferences"
