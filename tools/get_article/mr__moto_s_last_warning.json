A contemporary review said, \"The improbable story is made faintly plausible, and definitely thrilling as a result of Peter Lorre's acting in the main part.\"  It is an original story featuring the character created by John P. Marquand.\n''Mr. Moto's Last Warning'' is the only Mr. Moto film in the public domain.\nPlot\nThe British Navy in Port Said is making plans for naval manoeuvres with the French fleet. Plans are delayed because the British Secret Service has been warned of possible sabotage. On a ship docking in Port Said is Madame Delacour, wife of the French naval admiral. Delacour and her daughter Marie are befriended by the charming Eric Norvel, the goofy Rollo Venables, and someone posing as Mr. Moto. Norvel reveals his true nature when the ship docks and he lures Mr. Moto to his death. This \"fake\" Mr. Moto turns out to be a fellow agent of Mr. Moto, posing as a curio dealer, Mr. Kuroki.\nNorvel takes Delacour and Venables to a variety show featuring Fabian the Great, a ventriloquist. Fabian is the leader of the gang of saboteurs, which includes Hakim, Captain Hawkins, Danforth, and Norvel. Danforth is actually a British Secret Service agent named Burke. Moto listens in on their conversation and is almost captured, but Burke helps him escape. Norvel is given the task of learning from Delacour when the French fleet is due at Port Said.\nThe suspicious Fabian thinks that Kuroki may actually be Mr. Moto. Fabian enlists his girlfriend Connie, who is unaware he is an agent, to follow Mr. Moto the next day. She sees Moto visit the Port Commandant's office where he learns of the salvage ship \"The Vulcan\" captained by Hawkins.\nFabian also discovers that Danforth is the secret agent, Burke.  Fabian lures Burke to \"The Vulcan\" and reveals his plan to blow up the French fleet and blame the British.  He then kills Burke by trapping him in a diving bell.  Norvel gets the information needed and tells Fabian at the theater.  Connie overhears the conversation and threatens to call the Port Commandant, but Fabian convinces her to go along with him.\nHakim tries to kill Moto with a bomb, but Moto escapes the explosion and follows Hakim to a warehouse.  Moto enlists Venables to help, but Venables is tricked by Norvel.  After a fight, Moto and Venables are tied in sacks and thrown into the ocean, but not before Moto tricks Hawkins and grabs a piece of sharp metal.  Connie can't bear to see this violence and goes to call the police.  Fabian knocks her out and proceeds with his plans.\nMoto escapes underwater and frees Venables, who goes to the police.  Norvel dives down to await a signal from Fabian but Moto overpowers him and prematurely detonates the explosives meant to destroy the French fleet.  Resurfacing, Moto fights with Fabian but Connie shows up and shoots Fabian.  Moto discovers the saboteur's plans in Fabian's dummy but never reveals to the audience which country tried to engineer a war between France and England.\nCast\n*Peter Lorre as Mr. Kentaro Moto (a.k.a.

The Los Angeles Times gave the film \"faint praise\" saying it was \"routine\".\nHome media\nThis film, along with Mr. Moto in Danger Island, ''Mr. Moto's Gamble, Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation and (as a DVD extra) The Return of Mr. Moto, was released on DVD in 2007 by 20th Century Fox as part of The Mr. Moto Collection, Volume Two''.\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
