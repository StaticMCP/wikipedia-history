A defender, primarily a left-back, he began his career with Tottenham Hotspur and was part of the 1990 winning FA Youth Cup side, but was released without breaking into the first-team, having spells with Leyton Orient, Doncaster, Mansfield and Barnet.\nAfter retirement from the football league due to injury, Hackett played for two seasons in non-League football before going into coaching where he was assistant manager at Waltham Forest, Fisher Athletic and Erith & Belvedere.\nHe then moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada to further his coaching career and worked for Glen Shields Soccer Club as an Academy Director. He returned to England and was the Academy manager / Centre Of Excellence Manager at Dagenham & Redbridge. Hackett was promoted to first-team assistant manager, along with Darren Currie, in February 2013 when his former Leyton Orient team-mate Wayne Burnett took over as manager of Dagenham.\nIn December 2015, following the sacking of manager Burnett, Hackett and Currie became caretaker managers of Dagenham & Redbridge losing their first game in charge, on 26 December, 3–0 at home to Cambridge United.\nManagerial statistics\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n|+ Managerial record by team and tenure\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Team\n!rowspan=2|From\n!rowspan=2|To\n!colspan=5|Record\n!rowspan=2|\n|-\n!!!!!!!!!\n|-\n|align=left|Dagenham & Redbridge (caretaker)\n|align=left|21 December 2015\n|align=left|31 December 2015\n|\n|-\n!colspan=3|Total\n!—\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
