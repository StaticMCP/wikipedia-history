It is awarded to the top member of the NBL Canada's executive committee, including the owners of the teams. The recipient is chosen by the league commissioner. It is one of two business awards given by the NBL, the other being New Franchise of the Year. Since its inception, the London Lightning have had two executives that have been selected, owner Vito Frijia in  and general manager Taylor Brown in . London is the only team in the league that has had more than one of its front office members win the award.  Kimo Blanco of the Moncton Miracles was the first woman to be honored; in 2019–20 Melissa Melnychuk became the second.\nThe award is named after the late Ian R. Fowler, a Moncton city employee that played a major role in developing sport teams in the city, including the Miracles.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" summary=\"Season (sortable), Player (sortable), Position (sortable), Nationality (sortable) and Team (sortable)\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Season\n!scope=\"col\"| Executive\n!scope=\"col\"| Nationality\n!scope=\"col\"| Team\n!scope=\"col\"|Selected by\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n| Summerside Storm\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n| Moncton Miracles\n| Andre Levingston\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n| London Lightning\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n| London Lightning\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n| Windsor Express\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n| Cape Breton Highlanders\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n| St. John's Edge\n| Audley Stephenson\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n| Sudbury Five\n| Audley Stephenson\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n| KW Titans\n| Audley Stephenson\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
