It has a masthead sloop rig, with a bowsprit; a plumb stem; a vertical, walk-through transom; a lifting, transom-hung rudder controlled by a wheel and a lifting keel with a weighted bulb, actuated by an electric winch. It displaces  and carries  of ballast.\nThe walk-through transom has a swimming ladder and a hot and cold shower.\nThe boat has a draft of  with the keel extended and  with it retracted, allowing operation in shallow water or ground transportation on a trailer.\nThe boat is fitted with a Japanese Yanmar 3YM30  diesel engine for docking and maneuvering. The fuel tank holds  and the fresh water tank has a capacity of .\nThe design has sleeping accommodation for six people, with a double \"V\"-berth in the bow cabin, a U-shaped dinette table that forms a double berth and an aft cabin with a double berth on the port side. The galley is located on the starboard side just forward of the companionway ladder. The galley is L-shaped and is equipped with a two-burner stove and a double sink. A navigation station is opposite the galley, on the starboard side. The head is located just aft of the bow cabin on the port side.\nThe design has a hull speed of .\nOperational history\nIn a 2020 review in Blue Water Sailing, Sandy Parks wrote, \" The 32RK has one signature design feature that makes it uniquely suitable for cruising in areas with a lot of shallow water and for sailors who want to trailer their boats. The RK in its name stands for 'retracting keel' which enables you to lower the keel to whatever depth you want, within reason, and to raise it again when the water starts to get thin. A simple electric winch raises and lowers the keel.\"\nSee also\n*List of sailing boat types\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160901223708/http://www.seawardyachts.com/32rk Official website archives] on archive.org"
