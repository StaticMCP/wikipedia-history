Unlike the previous election, this was an open primary and every citizen was able to vote as far as pledge written membership to the party before casting the vote.\nThree-time candidate and party’s founder Ottón Solís declined run for president for the fourth time opening the opportunity for new leaderships and the presidential nomination in one of Costa Rica’s major parties. Four candidates were able to enroll their names; former deputy and vice presidential candidate Epsy Campbell, then deputy and former President of the Legislative Assembly Juan Carlos Mendoza,  former deputy Ronald Solís  and college professor Luis Guillermo Solís. None of the Solis were related. Other aspirants were businesswoman and former vice presidential nominee Monica Segnini, lawmaker Claudio Monge and former candidate in the previous primary and future ambassador in Washington Román Macaya, but all dropped their candidacies for different reasons.\nContrary to all expectations Luis Guillermos Solís won the election with 35% of the votes, only 113 votes more than Mendoza. Campbell, who was by far the frontrunner in all previous polls, achieved only 25% of the vote, and Solís Bolaños received 4%. Solís was declared PAC’s presidential candidate and would eventually won the 2014 presidential race in both rounds.\nSee also\n* 2014 Costa Rican general election\n* Social Christian Unity Party presidential primary, 2013\nReferences"
