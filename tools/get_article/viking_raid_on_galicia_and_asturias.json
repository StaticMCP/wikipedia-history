Many longships were lost in the attack and the fleet retreated to Aquitaine.\nRaid\nIn 844, the Vikings, who at that time infested all the maritime provinces of Europe, made a descent at A Coruña, and began to raid the countryside, burning and pillaging. King Ramiro I of Asturias marched against them with a potent army, managed to rout the invaders with a prodigious slaughter, took many of them as prisoners, and burned the best part of their fleet. Ramiro's reception frightened the Viking raiders, so raiding parties no longer troubled the parts of Spain that were under the king's control.\nSee also\n* Viking raid on Seville\n* Sack of Santiago de Compostela\nReferences"
