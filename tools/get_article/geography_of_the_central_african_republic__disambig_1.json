It is bordered by  Cameroon, Chad, Sudan, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo. Much of the country consists of flat, or rolling plateau savanna, about  above sea level. In the northeast are the Fertit Hills, and there are scattered hills in the southwestern part of the country. To the northwest is the Karre Mountains (also known as Yade Massif), a granite plateau with an altitude of .\nAt , the Central African Republic is the world's 45th-largest country (after Somalia). It is comparable in size to Ukraine.\nMuch of the southern border is formed by tributaries of the Congo River, with the Mbomou River in the east merging with the Uele River to form the Ubangi River. In the west, the Sangha River flows through part of the country. The eastern border lies along the edge of the Congo-Nile watershed.\nIn the Central African Republic forest cover is around 36% of the total land area, equivalent to 22,303,000 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, down from 23,203,000 hectares (ha) in 1990. In 2020, naturally regenerating forest covered 22,301,000 hectares (ha) and planted forest covered 2,000 hectares (ha). Of the naturally regenerating forest 9% was reported to be primary forest (consisting of native tree species with no clearly visible indications of human activity). For the year 2015, 91% of the forest area was reported to be under public ownership and 9% private ownership. In 2021, the rate of deforestation in the Central African Republic increased by 71%. The forest is highly diverse and includes commercially important species of Ayous, Sapele and Sipo.\nClimate\nThe climate of the Central African Republic is generally a tropical savanna climate (Köppen Aw), although there are areas with a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen Am) and in the north there is also a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen BSh). There is a wet season and a dry season, and the temperature is hot throughout the year. The northern areas are subject to harmattan winds, which are hot, dry, and carry dust. The tip of the northern regions have been subject to desertification. The remainder of the country is prone to flooding from nearby rivers. About one third of the Central African Republic's population do not have access to clean water.\n| source 2 = Danish Meteorological Institute (sun only)\n}}\n|source 2= Climate Bossangoa - Central African Republic for rainfall totals , ''Étude méthodologique pour l'utilisation des données climatologiques de l'Afrique tropicale for sunshine hours''\n}}\n|source 2= ''Climate : N'Délé for rainfall totals'', ''Étude méthodologique pour l'utilisation des données climatologiques de l'Afrique tropicale for sunshine hours''\n}}\n}}\nNotes\nTopography of Central African Republic.\nLocation:\nCentral Africa, north of Democratic Republic of the Congo\n; Area comparative\n:* Slightly smaller than Somalia\n:* Slightly larger than Ukraine\n:* Australia comparative: slightly more than  the size of New South Wales\n:* Canada comparative: slightly smaller than Manitoba\n:* United Kingdom comparative: slightly more than 2 times the size of the United Kingdom\n:* United States comparative: approximately  smaller than Texas\n:* EU comparative: approximately  larger than Spain\nLand boundaries:\ntotal:\n5,920&nbsp;km\nborder countries:\nCameroon 901&nbsp;km, Chad 1,556&nbsp;km, Democratic Republic of the Congo 1,747&nbsp;km, Republic of the Congo 487&nbsp;km, Sudan 174&nbsp;km and South Sudan 1,055&nbsp;km\nCoastline:\n0&nbsp;km (landlocked)\nTerrain:\nvast, flat to rolling, monotonous plateau; scattered hills in northeast and southwest\nElevation extremes:\nlowest point:\nOubangui River 335 m\nhighest point:\nMont Ngaoui 1,420 m\nNatural resources:\ndiamonds, uranium, timber, gold, petroleum, hydropower\nLand use:\narable land:\n2.89%\npermanent crops:\n0.13%\nother:\n96.98% (2012 est.)\nIrrigated land:\n1.35&nbsp;km2 (2003)\nTotal renewable water resources:\n144.4&nbsp;km3 (2011)\nFreshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural):\ntotal:\n0.07&nbsp;km3/yr (83%/17%/1%)\nper capita:\n17.42 m3/yr (2005)\nNatural hazards:\nhot, dry, dusty harmattan winds affect northern areas; floods are common\nEnvironment — current issues:\ntap water is not potable; poaching has diminished its reputation as one of the last great wildlife refuges; desertification\nEnvironment — international agreements:\nparty to:\nBiodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Nuclear Test Ban, Ozone Layer Protection, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands\nsigned, but not ratified:\nLaw of the Sea\nGeography — note:\nlandlocked; almost the precise center of Africa\nExtreme points\nThis is a list of the extreme points of the Central African Republic, the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.\n*Northernmost point - unnamed location in the Aoukal river on the border with Chad, Vakaga Prefecture\n*Easternmost point - unnamed location immediately East of the tripoint with South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo and south of the town of Ezo in South Sudan, Haut-Mbomou Prefecture\n*Southernmost point - the tripoint with Cameroon and the Republic of Congo, Sangha-Mbaéré Prefecture\n*Westernmost point - unnamed location on the border with Cameroon west of the town of Koundé in Central African Republic near Cameroon's Lokoti to Garoua Boulai road, Nana-Mambéré Prefecture\nReferences\npt:República Centro-Africana#Geografia"
