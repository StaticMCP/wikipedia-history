The locality is within the Fitzroy River drainage basin.\nThe Capricorn Highway passes through the northernmost part of the locality from Anakie Siding to Willows.\nThe Snake Range National Park () lies within the locality to the east. It is .\nThe predominant land use is grazing on native vegetation.\nHistory\nLochington pastoral station obtained a mail service on 1 January 1937.\nLockington Provisional School opened 23 January 1961 on land that was once part of Lockington pastoral station, and became Lockington State School at a new site in January 1965. The school closed 14 December 1979 due to low student numbers, but reopened in January 1991, as Lochington State School (a new spelling of the name).\nOn 17 April 2020, the Queensland Government re-drew the boundaries of localities within the Central Highlands Region by replacing the locality of The Gemfields with three new localities of Rubyvale, Sapphire Central and Anakie Siding (around the towns of Rubyvale, Sapphire, and Anakie respectively). This included adjusting the boundaries of other existing localities in the Region to accommodate these changes; Lochington lost a small portion of land to the north to the new Anakie Siding, lost a strip of land from its north-eastern edge mostly to Gindie but gained a small piece of land from Minerva, with the overall effect of reducing the area of the locality from . As a consequence of these changes, the boundary between Lochington and Minerva/Gindie more closely follows the course of the Nogoa River.\nDemographics\nIn the , Lochington's population was deemed to be too low to be reported separately and was combined with neighbouring Willows which had a reported population of 308 people.\nAt the , Lochington had a population of 57 people.\nIn the , Lochington had a population of 128 people.\nEducation\nLochington State School is a government co-educational primary (Prep to Year 6) school at the Lochington pastoral homestead at 101 Lochington Access Road (). In 2013, the school had 3 students (from the same family) and 1 teacher. In 2016, enrolment was 10, in 2017, eight, and in 2018, seven. In 2021, enrolment was six, including three students in their Prep year.\nThere are no secondary schools in Lochington. The nearest government secondary school is Springsure State School (to Year 10) in Springsure to the east. However, for students in most of Lochington, the distance to Springsure would be too great for a daily commute. Aso, there are no nearby schools offering education to Year 12. The alternatives are distance education and boarding school.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*  — via [https://onesearch.slq.qld.gov.au/permalink/61SLQ_INST/tqqf2h/alma997643424702061 State Library of Queensland].
