The film stars Bryan Leung, Casanova Wong and Fung Hak-on. Leung plays the character of the historical figure, Leung Jan (or Leung Tsan), a well-known early practitioner of the Wing Chun style of kung fu. Leung's association with Wing Chun can be considered as the equivalent of Wong Fei-hung's association with the Hung Gar style.\nAlong with The Prodigal Son, Warriors Two is considered one of the best martial arts film displaying the authentic version of the Wing Chun style. Despite the title, Warriors Two is not a sequel. Rather it refers to the two main warriors of the film, and the literal translation of the Hong Kong title is \"Mr. Tsang and Cashier Hua\".\nPlot\nMr. Tsan is a doctor and master of Wing Chun who can trace his martial lineage back to the style's founder. He is grudgingly persuaded by Fei Chun, his lead student, to teach kung fu to Cashier Hua, a patient hiding out at his residence. Hua had previously overheard a businessman named Mo and several of his men plotting to take over the town by killing the head of the town. Unfortunately, Hua made the mistake of warning Mo's wormy henchman, Master Yao and a trap was set that nearly cost the poor cashier his life. Whilst in hiding, Hua sends Fei Chun to warn the town head. Ignores the advice, the town head is later attacked by Mo's men, although it is unclear whether he escapes or is killed after a protracted fight.\nMeanwhile, Tsan runs Hua through an elaborate series of Wing Chun training sessions before he falls victim to a vicious trap set by Mo who has learned of Hua's whereabouts. With nothing left to lose, Hua, Fei Chun, and Tsan's niece split up to use specific Wing Chun styles against Mo's leading fighters. Trouble mounts when it is discovered that Fei mixed up the fighter's names and each of Tsan's students have to improvise in order to win against their opponents.\nCast\n* Bryan Leung - Leung Jan/Master Tsang\n* Sammo Hung - Kei Cheun\n* Casanova Wong - Cashier Wah\n* Dean Shek - Master Yao\n* Fung Hak-on - Mo\n* Lee Hoi-sang - Iron Fist\n* Lau Kar-wing - Town Chief's Bodyguard\n* Tiger Yang - Thunder Pai\n* Yeung Wai - Tiger\n* Chin Yuet-sang - Leung's Student/Twin Swordsmen (2 roles)\n* Mang Hoi - Leung's Student/Twin Swordsmen (2 roles)\n* Billy Chan - Thunder's Men\n*  - Rip off Kei\n* Eric Tsang - Rip off Kei\n* Lam Ching-ying - Thunder's Men\n* Yuen Biao - Thunder's Men\n* Wellson Chin - Thunder's Men\n* Chung Fat - Assassin Beggar\n* Mars - Thunder's Men\n* Choe Mu Ung - Town's Chief\nSee also\n*List of Hong Kong films\n*Sammo Hung filmography\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20141115032008/http://www.martiallife.com/index.php/component/content/article/9-martial-arts-movie/69-warriors-two-1978-one-of-the-most-authentic-wing-chun-movie-ever.html Review] at martiallife.com"
