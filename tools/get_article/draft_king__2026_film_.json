Reportedly produced by Pathaan director Siddharth Anand and Gauri Khan, the project was also reported to cast Suhana Khan in her feature film debut. Titled King, production was claimed by reports to commence in November 2023. Although the title King was initially acquired by Sajid Nadiadwala, as he had began a film in 2017 starring Hrithik Roshan directed by Kabir Khan which did not materialize, he gave the rights to Red Chillies Entertainment. The initial filming schedule was to take place from November to March 2024, as Khan could later focus on Tiger vs Pathaan, but the plan was not followed. Later, the filming was postponed to January 2024. However, that plan was also not followed. In August 2024, Khan confirmed the project at Locarno Film Festival in Switzerland. The following December, Siddharth Anand was announced to replace Sujoy Ghosh due to unknown reasons. The film is reportedly inspired by 1994 French film Léon: The Professional.\nCasting\nShah Rukh Khan and his daughter Suhana Khan were confirmed to be part of the film in February 2024. Thus, this would be Suhana's debut film in Bollywood. Earlier, reports indicated that Khan was cast for an extended cameo appearance however it was later confirmed to be a full fleding role. SRK would reportedly play the role of a sleek and deadly assassin while Suhana's character would be a protege under him.\nIn July 2024, Abhishek Bachchan was cast as the film's main antagonist. In August 2024, Abhay Verma joined the cast for a pivotal role. Deepika Padukone was confirmed to be a part of the film in April 2025. Thus, marking her fifth collaboration with Khan after Om Shanti Om (2007), Happy New Year (2014), Pathaan (2023) and Jawan (2023). As Padukone was busy with her personal life, she had earlier declined the role with makers approaching Sonam Bajwa, Katrina Kaif and Preity Zinta for the same. But later, on Khan's request and some schedule changing, Padukone was cast in the film. Arshad Warsi also joined the cast in the same month.\nAnil Kapoor and Jackie Shroff joined the cast in May 2025. This will also mark the trio's (Khan, Kapoor and Shroff) second collaboration after Trimurti (1995). In the same month, Rani Mukerji joined the cast as Suhana's mother in the film, this also marks her reunion with SRK after 19 years. Jaideep Ahlawat confirmed his role in June 2025. In the same month, Raghav Juyal and Saurabh Shukla were confirmed to be part of the film.\nFilming\nThe film's shoot was set to begin in early 2025, however it was delayed after Anand re-worked on the film's script work.\nPrincipal photography began in Mumbai's Mehboob Studios in May 2025. In June 2025, an intense jail action sequence was shot along with SRK at the same location along with 200 stunt performers. Sets resembling foreign jails were constructed. During the shoot while performing some stunts, Raghav Juyal suffered a leg injury. In July 2025, while performing some action sequences in Golden Tobacco Factory in Vile Parle, Khan also suffered from a muscular injury and had to travel to USA for immediate medical attention, thus pushing shoot by a month.\nThe film's second schedule began in September 2025, with shooting taking place in Warsaw, Poland.\nSoundtrack\nThe film's soundtrack is composed by Anirudh Ravichander. This will mark his second collaboration with Khan after Jawan (2023).\nAs per rumours, British singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran may contribute a Hindi-language track for the film, potentially marking his debut as a playback singer in Indian cinema. This speculation stems from Sheeran's appearance with Shah Rukh Khan and Arijit Singh in the music video \"Sapphire\" and his related social media activity. Stebin Ben with Alka Yagnik duet song Untitled in the film. However, no official confirmation has been made.\nSee also\n* List of Hindi films of 2026\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movie/king/ King] at Bollywood Hungama"
