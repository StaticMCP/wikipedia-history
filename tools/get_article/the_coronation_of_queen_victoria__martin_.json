It depicts a view of the interior of Westminster Abbey during the Coronation of Queen Victoria  on 28 June 1838. Victoria had succeeded her uncle William IV to the throne the previous year.\nMartin had built his reputation on his epic pictures of biblical scenes such as ''Belshazzar's Feast and The Seventh Plague of Egypt. This picture marked a change of pace for him, recording a scene of recent history.  It is now in the collection of Tate Britain in London, having been acquired in 1946.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Herrmann, Luke. Nineteenth Century British Painting.
