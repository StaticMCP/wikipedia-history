Established in 1980, the arboretum has 300 species of local rainforest trees grown from seeds and cuttings collected from the surrounding forests.\nIt is open every day of the year and access is free.\nHistory\nThe Mullumbimby district is in the heart of what was once the Big Scrub, 900 square kilometres of predominantly sub-tropical rainforest, on the Mount Warning caldera. Botanically, this region is known as the MacPherson–Macleay Overlap - an area of eastern Australia where tropical and temperate zones overlap: the wetter slopes typically have tropical vegetation and the drier, cooler, open parts have temperate vegetation.\nThis area has been inhabited for many thousands of years by people of the Bundjalung nation. For the last 150 years, colonisation, forestry, and clearing for agriculture decimated the Big Scrub and other areas of lowland rainforest leaving only small remnants of the original forests on steep slopes and less accessible places.\nIn 1980, the Byron Flora and Fauna Conservation Society, a group of local residents led by Russ and Beryl Maslen, was given responsibility and some support by the local council to design and establish a park on what had been a weedy horse-paddock that had been earmarked for a caravan park. The aim of establishing the park was to collect in one area a wide and representative selection of the flora native to the area.\nOn 7 June 1980 the mayor of Mullumbimby, Alderman Stan Robinson, planted the first tree in the arboretum, a Red Cedar, symbolically launching Brunswick Valley Heritage Park.\nSince its inception volunteers have established and maintained the park. They have propagated and planted trees native to the local area, and the arboretum now boasts 300 local species including 40 species with a conservation status.\nManagement of the park is now overseen by [http://brunswickvalleylandcare.org.au/ Brunswick Valley Landcare].\nLocation\nBrunswick Valley Heritage Park is a  riverside park in the township of Mullumbimby. Access to the arboretum is from Brunswick Terrace and Tyagarah Street; access to the boat ramp and children's playground is via Mill Street on the north side of town.\nGallery\nFile:Bangalow Palms in Heritage Park.jpg| Bangalow Palms, 2014\nFile:Fern in Brunswick Valley Heritage Park.jpg| Tree fern, 2015\nFile:Brunswick Valley Heritage Park 03.jpg|Entry to the Brunswick Valley Heritage Park, 2025\nFile:Heritage Park volunteers.jpg| Volunteers, 2014\nFile:Brunswick Valley Heritage Park 02.jpg|Pathway at the Brunswick Valley Heritage Park, 2025\nSee also\n* Bundjalung people\n* List of Australian place names of Aboriginal origin\n* Northern Rivers\n* List of botanical gardens in Australia\nExternal links\n* [http://brunswickvalleylandcare.org.au/ Brunswick Valley Landcare Inc]\n* [http://www.byron.nsw.gov.au/ Byron Shire Council]\nReferences"
