However, urban planning and \"parking lots\" are listed municipal functions under Article 243W and the Twelfth Schedule, which states may devolve to city/municipal governments; city governments then implement these functions in practice.\nNational policy guidance\nAt the national level, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs issues policy guidance (for example, the National Urban Transport Policy, 2014) and model instruments that states and cities can adopt or adapt.\nTherefore, parking policy is not an omnibus national law, but rather a combination of central guidance, state legislation, and municipal rules / policies. The scope of powers (for example, to fix parking fees, regulate on-street parking, designate parking zones) typically resides at municipal or other local body levels under state law.\nBuilding and planning instruments\nBuilding regulations are another policy tool that regulates parking and they are operationalised through state/ULB building bye‑laws. The union government of India has issued model building / bye-laws (e.g. Model Building Bye-Laws, 2016) which include parking norms These byelaws can include parking standards such as  Equivalent Car Space (ECS), a simple unit used in Indian building and parking codes to size and count parking consistently across vehicle types and parking layouts. In practice, \"parking standards (ECS norms and related provisions)\" tell a project how many ECS it must provide, how big each space and aisle should be, and what supporting features ( such as ramps, signage, EV chargers, accessible bays) are required. The model byelaws were prepared \"for the guidance of the State Governments, Urban Local Bodies, Urban Development Authorities,\" serving as templates for adoption/amendment.\nState and municipal implementations\nSection 117 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 lets state governments (or authorities they authorize), after consulting local bodies, decide where vehicles may park or halt. On national highways, the Central Government or the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) can designate such places. For example, in 2019, the Government of NCT of Delhi notified the Delhi Maintenance and Management of Parking Places Rules, creating an apex committee and mandating Parking Management Area Plans (PMAPs) with pricing, inventory, and enforcement mechanisms.\nTechnology and enforcement\nPolicies and rules related to the technological aspects of parking envisage digital payments, inventorying of legal spaces, signage and markings, and penalties or impoundment for violations. Some cities have been deploying mobile apps and automated systems for efficient parking management.\nReferences"
