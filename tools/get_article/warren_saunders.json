A batsman and occasional wicket-keeper, he played 35 first-class matches for New South Wales between 1955–56 and 1964–65.\nAlthough Saunders was a consistent scorer for New South Wales, he never scored a century. In January 1964, he top-scored in both innings against Victoria, making 87 and 98. He retired from first-class cricket during the 1964–65 season to concentrate on his insurance business. However, he continued to play for St George in Sydney Grade Cricket, reaching 10,000 runs for the club in 1971–72.\nSaunders died on 1 March 2023, at the age of 88.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
