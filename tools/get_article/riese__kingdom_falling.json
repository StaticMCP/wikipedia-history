The series is about a traveller named Riese, who flees across the wartorn lands of Eleysia with her wolf, Fenrir. Hunted by a terrifying religious group, The Sect, Riese must evade the assassins that have been sent to kill her and discover their true objective.\nProduction\nRiese is co-created by Ryan Copple and Kaleena Kiff, and produced by Galen Fletcher and Nicholas Humphries.  Production of the first five episodes was completed on  Sept. 2, 2009. The first chapter went online during the fall of 2009 and was very successful, so that a second chapter was developed. This drew Syfy's attention: Syfy digital owned by NBC Universal decided to buy the broadcasting rights.\nThe cast of Riese includes actors and actresses from other notable science fiction and fantasy television series, such as Stargate and Sanctuary Amanda Tapping; Sanctuary Ryan Robbins and Emilie Ullerup; Stargate Universe Patrick Gilmore and Peter Kelamis; Stargate Atlantis Ben Cotton; Battlestar Galactica Alessandro Juliani and Smallville Allison Mack.\nSyfy started airing Riese on October 26, 2010 with a new name: Riese: Kingdom Falling.\nOn November 30, 2010, Space announced that Riese will start airing on spacecast.com early in 2011, making Canada the first country after the United States to air the complete webseries.\nRiese has been noted for its usage of the Red One, a digital cinematography camera. It is also one of the first live action sci-fi web series to feature the steampunk genre. Production-value wise, it has been compared to the web efforts of Sanctuary and features a cast of top Sci-Fi actors from a variety of shows. It is also one of the first dramatic web series to incorporate animals as one of their cast ensemble.\nCharacters & organizations\n*Riese (Christine Chatelain) – daughter of Empress Kara and King Ulric of Eleysia, a fugitive since Amara's coup.\n*Fenrir (Tundra) – Riese's companion, a wolf, formerly of the royal bodyguard.\n*The Narrator (Amanda Tapping, Riese: Kingdom Falling only)\n*Empress Amara (Sharon Taylor) – cousin of the late queen.
