As set forth in the Constitution of the Czech Republic, however, cases of constitutionality, administrative law and political jurisdiction are heard by other courts.\nAlong with the Supreme Administrative and Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court forms a triumvirate of courts at the summit of the Czech judiciary. It is situated on Burešova Street 20, Brno.\nThe Supreme Court sits in panels consisting of a Chairman and two judges or it sits in Grand Panels () of the Divisions.\nThe Divisions analyse and evaluate legally effective decisions of lower courts.\nThe Criminal Division () consists of the judges of the Supreme Court, who apply substantive and procedural criminal law.\nThe Civil and Commercial Division () is responsible for ensuring uniformity and lawfulness in the decision-making of courts in civil proceedings. It does so in extraordinary appeal proceedings against decisions of courts of appeal and within its non-decision-making jurisdiction by providing standpoints.\nThe Grand Panel of the Division () decides cases referred to it by divisions.\nThe Plenum () discusses the Supreme Court's Rules of Procedure and adopts standpoints on the courts decision-making.\nReferences"
