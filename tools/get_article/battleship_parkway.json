The roadway itself is a four-lane divided highway for most of its length.  It is very susceptible to flooding and is usually submerged during hurricane storm surges. The Battleship Parkway is home to Battleship Memorial Park and to many of the Mobile area's more prominent seafood restaurants.\nHistory\nIt was constructed in 1926 as a series of raised earthen embankments and concrete bridges.  It was the only road connection between Mobile and Baldwin counties over Mobile Bay until the construction of the nearby Jubilee Parkway in 1978.\nIn 2007 a  turtle chainlink fence was constructed along part of the causeway to protect the Alabama red bellied cooter from traffic.\nSee also\n*\n*\nReferences"
