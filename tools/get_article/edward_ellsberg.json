He was widely known as \"Commander Ellsberg\".\nEarly years\nEllsberg was born in New Haven, Connecticut, and grew up in Colorado. He was one of the very few Jews who were accepted into the United States Naval Academy, which graduated him with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1914. He earned his Master of Science degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1920. He received an honorary Eng.D. from  University of Colorado at Boulder in 1929.\nFirst service with the U.S. Navy\nEllsberg was commissioned in the navy in 1914 and served on active duty until 1926. He became an expert in undersea salvage and rescue. In 1926, he raised the navy submarine, S-51. For that success he was promoted to the rank of commander by an Act of Congress and awarded the Distinguished Service Medal by the Navy Department, since which time he has been popularly known as \"Commander Ellsberg\", regardless of his rank. Ellsberg described the raising of the S-51 in his 1929 book, On the Bottom.\nOn June 1, 1918, Ellsberg married Lucy Buck. In letters to her he signed his name as \"Ned\". Lucy Ellsberg bore their daughter Mary on  29 August 1921.\nReturn to civilian status\n'' (1933), adapted from Ellsberg's novel Pigboats]]\nAfter leaving active duty, Ellsberg worked for the Tide Water Oil Company and began writing books about his exploits and about historical events.\nIn December 1927, Ellsberg volunteered for active duty to rescue survivors trapped in the sunken submarine S-4. The rescue efforts failed and Ellsberg returned home in early January 1928.\nEllsberg's 1931 book, Pigboats, inspired the 1933 movie, Hell Below, starring Robert Montgomery, Robert Young, Walter Huston, and Madge Evans.\nHis book Hell on Ice was adapted for an episode of Orson Welles's The Mercury Theatre on the Air that aired October 9, 1938, on CBS Radio. An adaptation was also presented on Welles's The Mercury Summer Theatre of the Air, broadcast August 9, 1946.\nWorld War II naval service\nImmediately after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Ellsberg rejoined the navy. His first assignment was to conduct salvage operations at the newly liberated port of Massawa, Eritrea. Working in beastly heat with virtually no staff and poor administrative support, Ellsberg salvaged a large floating dry dock and several of the ships that had been sunk to block the harbor.\nEllsberg returned the port to operation and the ships salvaged were added to the Allies' merchant fleets. During his work in Massawa, Ellsberg reported to the Lend Lease coordinator in Cairo, Egypt, US Army Major General Russell Maxwell. Ellsberg renamed the SS Liebenfels, a large German freighter, salvaged and refitted at Massawa, the General Russell Maxwell. He described the salvage of the port of Massawa in his book Under the Red Sea Sun. Ellsberg was promoted to captain by presidential order on June 19, 1942. The next year he was awarded the Legion of Merit by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in honor of his salvage efforts in Massawa.\nIn Under the Red Sea Sun, Ellsberg complained that the American contractor that was assigned to give him administrative support was very unhelpful, but he did not name that company.  The company, Johnson, Drake & Piper, itself claimed credit for clearing the port in the privately printed book, \"Middle East War Projects of Johnson, Drake & Piper, Inc., for the Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army, 1942–1943\" (New York: Johnson, Drake & Piper, Inc., 1943). That book contains photographs and drawings showing wartime projects around the Middle East.\nFrom Massawa, Ellsberg went to North Africa to become Principal Salvage Officer in that theater. He worked under Admiral Andrew Cunningham, the British officer commanding naval forces in the area. Ellsberg's activities were detailed in his book No Banners, No Bugles.\nEllsberg, worn out from constant work, was ordered home in early 1943 to recuperate.\nAfter a time inspecting ship construction activities, Ellsberg was sent to England in time for the Normandy Invasion, where he was instrumental in setting up the Mulberry harbour off the Normandy Beach. He also prepared 89 damaged or superannuated ships for scuttling to make artificial harbors. That operation gained him great admiration in Britain where he was appointed an honorary Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). Ellsberg described his experiences in his book, The Far Shore.\nRetirement\nHe rose to the rank of rear admiral before he retired from active duty in 1951 to enjoy Maine and Florida with his wife of 33 years. He continued to write, to lecture, and to consult on engineering projects. He died in 1983 at the age of 91, and is buried in Willimantic, Connecticut.\nDecorations\nRear Admiral Ellsberg's ribbon bar:\n{| style=\"margin:1em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|colspan=\"3\"|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!1st Row\n|colspan=\"6\"|Navy Distinguished Service Medal\n|colspan=\"6\"|Legion of Merit with Gold Star\n|-\n!2nd Row\n|colspan=\"3\"|World War I Victory Medal\n|colspan=\"3\"|American Campaign Medal\n|colspan=\"3\"|European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with two service stars\n|-\n!3rd Row\n|colspan=\"3\"|World War II Victory Medal\n|colspan=\"3\"|Officer of the Order of the British Empire\n|colspan=\"3\"|Ecuador Order of Abdon Calderón, 1st Class\n|-\n|}\nPublications\nWriting was an Ellsberg hobby.
