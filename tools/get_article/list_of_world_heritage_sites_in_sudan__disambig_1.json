Red dots are the two cultural sites, green dots are the two components of the natural site.|alt=Map of Sudan showing the locations of the WHS}}\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites are places of importance to cultural or natural heritage as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972. Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Sudan accepted the convention on 6 June 1974. There are three World Heritage Sites in Sudan, with a further 15 on the tentative list.\nThe first site to be listed to in Sudan was Jebel Barkal and its associated sites in 2003. The site of Meroë were listed in 2011 and the site Sanganeb Marine National Park and Dungonab Bay – Mukkawar Island Marine National Park in 2016. The latter is a natural site while the first two are listed for their cultural significance. Sudan has served one term on the World Heritage Committee.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\"| Site\n! class=\"unsortable\"  style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\"| Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\"| Location (state)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Gebel Barkal and the Sites of the Napatan Region\n|\n| Northern\n| 2003\n| 1073; i, ii, iii, iv, vi (cultural)\n| The archaeological area in Nubia comprises sites from the Napatan (900 to 270 BCE) and Meroitic (270 BCE to 350 CE) cultures of the Kingdom of Kush.
