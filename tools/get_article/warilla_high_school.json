The school is operated by the NSW Department of Education.\nOverview\nThe school is located in the suburb of Barrack Heights and there were suggestions of renaming the school to reflect the change in primary feeder schools (Flinders Public School, Warilla Public School, Shellharbour Public School, and Barrack Heights Public School). In early to late 2009 Warilla High underwent a major reconstruction with the funding of six new Science Labs. The school celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2015.\nAs of 2010 Warilla High School had an enrolment of over 1,200 students making it one of the largest high schools in the region.\nPrincipals\nThe following individuals has served as principal of Warilla High School.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"; style=\"text-align: center\";\n|-\n!
