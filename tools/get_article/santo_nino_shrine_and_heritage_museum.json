It was formerly owned by the Marcos family and now houses a museum.\nIt was built from 1979 to 1981 by then-First Lady and wife of President Ferdinand Marcos, Imelda Marcos. It was among the 20 presidential palaces built during the Martial law era. The property was sequestered by the Philippine government as part of a campaign to recover the Marcos family's ill-gotten wealth. The former residential building was converted to a museum under the management of the Presidential Commission on Good Government and features the collection of Imelda Marcos, as well as artifacts related to the Santo Niño, the city's patron saint.\nIn 2013, the museum was damaged by Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda). It was later renovated.\nSee also\n*People's Park in the Sky\nReferences"
