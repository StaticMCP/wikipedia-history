The developers of the original The King of Fighters fighting game series SNK provided Seto directions in the making of the comic. In contrast to previous The King of Fighters comics, Zillion is mostly an original story. It is set 1998, which is somewhat \"free\" in terms of the official storyline.\nAndy Seto claims that given that it was 1998, the Japanese team at SNK required me to write a story about that period. When working with SNK he has have much less freedom in my choices and has to have to get their approval first before doing anything. In contrast Zillion gave Seto more freedom. In particular Seto's favorite characters are the two leads Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami, though he also has preferences for the guest characters Mai Shiranui and Blue Mary who originate from Fatal Fury.\nThe series was published in China for forty-five volumes all written by Andy Seto. The first volume was released on February 1, 1999. ComicsOne published some issues to Western regions alongside Seto's other work, Crouching Tiger & Hidden Dragon. In France, the comic was published by TONKAM. An artbook titled The Illustrations Of The King Of Fighters Zillion was also released in 2000.\nReception\nThe public praised the work which made the author glad for global audiences accepting his work for the first time in contrast to previous works that were only published in Hong Kong. Atomix claims the comic helped to explore more the consequences of the Orochi story arc not seen in gaming. Manga News said the aesthetically appealing despite relying on a very basic narrative. Nevertheless, Manga News enjoyed the fight sequences that represent the impact The King of Fighters marked on the world.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.manhuagui.com/comic/4884/ The King of Fighters Zillion in Manhuagui]"
