On graduation in 2006 he founded Redfern Natural History Productions in Poole, Dorset to conduct natural history research, publishing, filming and eco-tours.\nCareer\nWork in natural history\nStewart McPherson is the author of around 30 volumes published by his own company and concerned with natural history, largely focusing on carnivorous plants. He has co-discovered a number of species (including the much publicised Nepenthes&nbsp;attenboroughii) and has formally described around 35 carnivorous plant taxa.\nHe has a wife named Karen Battat and two children, Louis (12) and Jasmine (9). He is a member of the IUCN SSC Carnivorous Plant Specialist Group. He documented each species in full detail in its natural habitat, taking seven years with many expeditions in the tropics of Southeast Asia, Africa and South America. Over time he has transitioned  towards TV presenting and natural history writing.\nHe set up \"Ark of Life\" to conserve species on the brink of extinction, initially among carnivorous plant groups.\nTelevision presenting\nMcPherson has appeared in several documentaries, including a conservation documentary on the lost world tepui sandstone plateaux of southern Venezuela and the borderlands of northern Brazil and western Guyana. A 2011 documentary Mountain with No Name was set on Palawan in the Philippines, where he discovered new species of flesh-eating plants on a previously unexplored mountain. An earlier 2010 film documented the discovery of Nepenthes leonardoi.\nHis most recent series for the BBC was \"Britain's Treasure Islands\", a series of three episodes in which he visited all of Britain's 14 overseas territories, travelling  in the process. Working with cameraman Simon Vacher, he discussed the natural history of each location and history of British settlement. The series was focused on the natural history of the UK Overseas Territories, particular the most impressive wildlife populations and migrations.\nIn British Antarctica and South Georgia he retraced the expedition of Ernest Shackleton, and made a rare visit to the Chagos Archipelago and Pitcairn Island. The series was filmed in 2012-2014, broadcast on BBC Four in 2016 and repeated in 2018 and 2019.\nAwards\nIn 2012 McPherson was the first recipient of the David Given Award for Excellence in Plant Conservation.\nPublished work\n* [https://www.youtube.com/user/redfernexpeditions/videos Video channel, Redfern Productions]\n*McPherson, S.R. 2023.
