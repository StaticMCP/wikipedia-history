It was released on September 23, 2008 via his own record label Martyr Inc, with distribution by Hickory Records/Sony/ATV Music Publishing. This album sees Everlast moving away from hip hop in favor of alternative rock and blues. The album peaked at number 15 on the Swiss music charts, number 61 in Germany, number 78 on the U.S. Billboard 200, and number 132 in France.\nThe record included singles and videos for \"Letter Home from the Garden of Stone\", which was available for free download via martyr-inc.com in December 2007, a DJ Muggs-produced cover track of Johnny Cash's \"Folsom Prison Blues\", which was released to download on August 19, and the final \"Stone in My Hand\", which debuted on the martyr-inc.com website on October 28, 2008 and later made its appearance in 2011 film Drive Angry. All the tracks from the album were written and produced by Keefus Ciancia and Everlast himself, except for \"Naked\" produced by DJ Lethal, and \"Folsom Prison Blues\".\nTrack listing\n| length1 = 3:24\n| title2 = Folsom Prison Blues\n| writer2 = John R.
