It was created to promote and honour Canadian writers of Italian descent.  There are $1000 prizes for poetry (at least 20 poems), fiction (minimum 50 pages) and short fiction (minimum 8000 characters). A fourth \"special category\" prize has been given out since 2006.\nWorks are eligible if published from January 1 of one year to March 31 of the next year.  Submissions must be from Canadian citizens or permanent residents of 16 or older who have at least one parent or grandparent born in Italy, and can be in Italian, English or French. The Prize is named after the Italian Jesuit missionary Francesco Giuseppe Bressani.\nThe Prize was discontinued in 1995, but the Italian Cultural Centre appointed a new F.G. Bressani Committee in 2000 when it was reinstated.\nWinners\n1986\n*From the Frontier to the Little Italies: The Italians in Canada 1800-1941 by Robert F.
