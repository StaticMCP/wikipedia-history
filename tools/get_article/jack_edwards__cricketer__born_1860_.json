He hit his highest score the following summer (65 against the touring English team) before he was transferred to Bendigo in his job as a bank clerk.\nEdwards had a strong defence and was a fine fieldsman. His selection for the tour of England in 1888 was prompted by his heavy scoring in club matches. In the three Test matches on the tour he made three ducks in six innings, achieving an average of 9.60, batting in the middle order in all three matches. Edwards did only a little better in first-class cricket overall, playing in 51 matches and scoring 961 runs at an average of 13.72.\nHe died after illness compounded by a nervous breakdown.\nSee also\n* List of Victoria first-class cricketers\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/5122.html Cricinfo article on Jack Edwards]"
