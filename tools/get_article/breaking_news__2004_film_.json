The film premiered out of competition at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.\nPlot\nThe Hong Kong Police finds itself in a public relations crisis after a disastrous shootout and the scene of a police officer surrendering in apparent fear to the mobsters was captured and telecast by the local media. Inspector Cheung and his crew are assigned to the task of catching these mobsters, led by the intelligent and resourceful Yuan.\nIn the meantime, Superintendent Rebecca Fong leads an effort on the part of the Hong Kong Police to mislead the media and salvage the reputation of the police team. She sees the chance in a raid on the mobsters hiding out in an apartment, while Inspector Cheung leads his own team to search for the mobsters, with many gunfights breaking out in between. While the police are evacuating the apartment, Yuan accidentally rescues another team: the killer Chun and his companions. Yuan and Fong use the media to wage a propaganda war.\nYuan and Chun finally decide to create chaos. They escape from the apartment after freeing the remaining residents of the apartment, having a gunfight with the police during the chaos with the death of their companions. Cheung and Fong see through their trick and followed Yuan. Yuan takes Fong as a hostage and goes to the place where Chun goes to assassinate the target, and acts in his place, but Cheung and other police officers follow Fong's tracker and rush to the scene, which makes the assassination impossible. Fong says that she would not let this \"show\" be messed up in her hands. Yuan knows that the defeat is inevitable, so he decides to expose himself and is shot dead by the police. The police promotes Cheung and Fong as the heroes of this \"show\".\nAt the end of the story, the killer Chun takes Yuan's place in hijacking the cash withdrawal vehicle and is also shot dead.\nCast\n* Richie Jen as Yuen, an intelligent criminal\n* Kelly Chen as Superintendent Rebecca Fong\n* Nick Cheung as Senior Inspector Cheung of District Crime Squad\n* Eddie Cheung as Chief Superintendent Eric Yeung\n* Benz Hui as Sergeant Hoi, subordinate of Inspector Cheung\n* Lam Suet as Yip, hostage\n* You Yong as Chun\n* Ding Haifeng as Lung\n* Li Haitao as Chung\n* Simon Yam as Asst.
