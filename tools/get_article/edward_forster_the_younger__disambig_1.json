He received a commercial education in the Netherlands, and entered the banking-house of Forster, Lubbocks, Forster, & Clarke.\nForster took up botany in Epping Forest at age 15. With his two brothers he later cultivated in his father's garden almost all the herbaceous plants then grown, and contributed county lists of plants to Gough's edition of Camden (1789). He was one of the early fellows of the Linnean Society, founded in 1788, was elected treasurer in 1816, and vice-president in 1828. With his brothers he was one of the main founders of the Refuge for the Destitute in Hackney Road.\nDeath and legacy\nForster resided mainly at Hale End, Walthamstow, but at the time of his death was at the Ivy House, Woodford, London. He died of cholera, 23 February 1849, two days after inspecting the Hackney Road Refuge on the occasion of an outbreak of the disease. He was buried in the family vault at Walthamstow. At his death his library and his herbarium, collected in many parts of England, were sold. Robert Brown bought the herbarium and presented it to the British Museum.\n, named for Edward Forster]]\nThe species Luzula forsteri was named for Forster.\nWorks\nIn 1817 Forster had printed a catalogue of British birds. Subsequently he concentrated on plants. He printed papers on critical species of British plants in the Transactions of the Linnean Society, the Annals and Magazine of Natural History, and The Phytologist.\nForster collected material on the flora of Essex. Several species described by him were in the Supplement to English Botany'' (1834).\nFamily\nIn 1796 Forster married Mary Jane, only daughter of Abraham Greenwood, who died in 1846 without surviving issue.\nNotes\n;Attribution"
