Shortly after his accession in 1606, Jahangir sent an army of 20,000 cavalry to attack Mewar. Parviz was only the figurative commander while in reality the de facto commander was Jahangir who directed Asaf Khan. Amar led a hard-fought battle to defend his territory, and personally killed the Mughal commander Sultan Khan and his horse by spear which went through both. Reportedly, Asaf Khan retreated from the battlefield. Both Amar and Asaf Khan claimed victory in an inconclusive battle.\nBattle\nAfter Jahangir became emperor, he sent his son Parviz Mirza with an army of 20,000 cavalry to conquer Mewar. Parviz was supported by experienced commanders like Asaf Khan, and he was joined by Sagar, a claimant to the throne. Jahangir instructed Parviz not to harm the territory if the local ruler—the Rana—and his eldest son, Karan, came to offer their loyalty. In March 1606, news arrived that Parviz had successfully forced Amar out of Mandal. However, when Khusrsu’s rebellion broke out, Jahangir ordered Parviz to return to the capital, leaving the military campaign to his officers. Before Parviz received the recall order, Amar began negotiations and proposed that one of his younger sons should serve Parviz instead of himself or his eldest son, Kama. Parviz agreed and brought Amar’s younger son, Bagha Singh, to Lahore to meet Jahangir. Yet, nothing significant resulted from Bagha Singh’s visit because shortly afterward, Jahangir appointed Mu‘izz-ul-Mulk Bakshi to lead the army against the Maharana.\nSee also\n*Battle of Haldighati\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*"
