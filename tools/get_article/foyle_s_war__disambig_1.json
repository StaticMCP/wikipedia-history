It began broadcasting on ITV in October 2002. ITV director of programmes Simon Shaps cancelled ''Foyle's War'' in 2007, but Peter Fincham (Shaps's replacement) revived the programme after good ratings for 2008's fifth series. The final episode was broadcast on 18 January 2015, after eight series.\nDescription\nDetective Chief Superintendent Christopher Foyle (Michael Kitchen), a widower, is quiet, methodical, sagacious, scrupulously honest and frequently underestimated by his foes. Many of his cases concern profiteering, the black market and murder, and he is often called on to catch criminals who are taking advantage of the confusion created by the war. Although Foyle often comes up against high-ranking officials in the British military or intelligence services who would prefer that he mind his own business, he seeks justice tenaciously. Throughout the series, he is assisted by his driver, Samantha \"Sam\" Stewart (Honeysuckle Weeks), and Detective Sergeant Paul Milner (Anthony Howell).\nThe first six series are set during the Second World War in Hastings, Sussex, England. In series seven, Foyle works after retirement for MI5 on Cold War espionage. The stories are largely self-contained. There are some running plot strands, primarily involving the career of Foyle's son Andrew Foyle (Julian Ovenden) – a fighter pilot in the Royal Air Force – or Foyle's relationships with minor characters. Each episode runs for 90 to 100 minutes, filling a two-hour time slot on ITV when commercials are included.\nProduction\nIn a newspaper article and an interview accompanying the series one DVD set, Horowitz explained that he was seeking a name which evoked the early 1940s. He thought of Foyles bookshop in London's Charing Cross Road, once known for its archaic business practices and its owner, Christina Foyle; Christopher was the nearest male name to Christina. After Christina Foyle's death, control of Foyles passed in 1999 to her nephew Christopher. Christopher Foyle made a cameo appearance in the episode \"Bad Blood\", although his scene was cut from PBS airings in the US.\nThe series is also notable for its attention to historical detail, and the drama is frequently moved along by historical events of the Second World War. Horowitz considered that to honour the veterans of the war it was important to get the details correct. As the series progressed, he became more interested in the \"murder mystery\" format than the portrayal of history and exploration of the Home Front. Nevertheless, the Imperial War Museum is credited in an advisory capacity in some episodes. St Just, in Croft Road, Hastings, was used as the location for Foyle's home.\nCancellation and revival\nAfter five series, ''Foyle's War'' was cancelled abruptly by ITV director of programmes Simon Shaps. This forced Horowitz to discard scripts set during most of 1943 and 1944, resulting in time jumps of nine months to a year between episodes; previous series had gaps of a month at most. In April 2008, the presumed final episode, \"All Clear\" (during which the end of the war is announced) was broadcast.\nOn 9 April 2008, however, ITV announced that it was negotiating with Horowitz and Greenlit Productions to revive the series and continue Foyle's adventures beyond VE Day; some media observers saw high viewing figures for the penultimate episode (a 28-percent audience share) on 13 April as strengthening the case for continuing. When the audience figures for the final episode were released (28 percent and an average of 7.3 million viewers), ITV confirmed that it had entered \"early discussions\" with Horowitz and Greenlit. The negotiations led to ''Foyle's War'' recommissioning for an additional three series. Series six began filming in February 2009 and premiered on UK television on 11 April 2010. Series seven was filmed in Ireland and London from late August to December 2012, and was broadcast in the UK in March and April 2013. Series eight, three two-hour episodes, aired in the UK in January 2015.\nFoyle's Last Case\nEven after this second cancellation, Horowitz continued to hold out hope for some sort of revival, spin-off around Honeysuckle Weeks's character, or even just some Christmas specials.\nAn example of the latter concept was even developed by Horowitz as ''Foyle's Last Case, an exclusive two-part Christmas short story for The Daily Mail newspaper, published there on the 22 and 23 December 2018.\nEpisodes\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 100%;\"\n|+\n!

Series 1-8 are available for streaming on Acorn TV and occasionally on Netflix (the latest run in 2014–2017) via paid subscription. Acorn Media contracted Cre-a-TV to repackage Foyle's War'' in two-part episodes to run in PBS's time slots. The episodes were fed by satellite to the public television system by former PBS affiliate KCET in Los Angeles (now an independent station), and public TV stations began rebroadcasting the series in the fall of 2011. Each episode was aired in two parts, each in a one-hour time slot (usually separated by a week), and each part ran for about 50 minutes.\nAwards\n''Foyle's War'' was nominated in the Best Production Design category for the 2003 BAFTA Television Awards, and won a Lew Grade Award for Best Entertainment Programme that year. The series was nominated for the 2004 BAFTA Best Drama Series award. That year, Honeysuckle Weeks was nominated for the 10th National Television Awards' Most Popular Newcomer award.\nMedia\nDVD releases\nIn the UK, the first four series of ''Foyle's War were released as two two-disc DVDs per series, with two episodes each and episode titles instead of series numbers. In March 2007, UK and US distributor Acorn Media began re-releasing series 1–3 as four-disc DVDs for the UK (as they had in the US) and labelling them with series numbers. A complete box set of the series is available.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:99%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |DVD series/sets !! rowspan=\"2\" |TV series !! rowspan=\"2\" |Episodes !! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:100px;\" |Originally aired !! colspan=\"4\" style=\"width:550px;\" |DVD release\n|-\n! style=\"width:25%;\" |UK (Region 2) !! style=\"width:25%;\" |US (Region 1) !! style=\"width:50px; text-align:center;\" | Discs\n|-\n| 1\n| 1\n| 4\n|\n| Re-released 7 March 2007\n| 11 March 2003\n| 4\n|-\n|2\n| 2\n| 4\n|\n| Re-released: 12 March 2007\n| 20 July 2004\n| 4\n|-\n|3\n| 3\n| 4\n|\n| Re-released: 11 June 2007\n| 1 November 2005\n| 4\n|-\n| 4\n| 4\n| 4\n|\n| Re-released: 11 June 2007\n| 17 July 2007\n| 4\n|-\n| 5\n| 5\n| 3\n|\n| 28 April 2008\n| 5 August 2008\n| 3\n|-\n| 6\n| 6\n| 3\n|\n| 26 April 2010\n| 1 June 2010\n| 3\n|-\n| 7\n| 7\n| 3\n|\n| 15 May 2013\n| 24 September 2013\n| 3\n|-\n| 8\n| 8\n| 3\n|\n| 19 January 2015\n| 14 April 2015\n| 3\n|}\nBlu-ray releases\nAll but the last two series have been released on Blu-ray in Australia (all discs are region-free). While it may appear the \"complete collection\" box set includes seven seasons, there are only the first six series included. This is due to Icon entertainment releasing parts 1 & 2 of series four as seasons 4 & 5 respectively. Hence after the fourth season the Australian season numbering is one greater than the series that is included in the release.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:99%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Blu-ray seasons/sets !! rowspan=\"2\" |TV series !! rowspan=\"2\" |Episodes !! rowspan=\"2\" |Originally aired !! colspan=\"4\" |Blu-ray release\n|-\n!
