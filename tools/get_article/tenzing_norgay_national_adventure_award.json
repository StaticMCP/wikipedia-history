In its initial year, twenty-two awards were presented, the highest so far for a single year. Nineteen of these awards were given to the 1993 Indo-Nepalese Women's Everest Expedition led by Bachendri Pal. The expedition created four world records at the time including the largest number of mountaineers (eighteen) from a single expedition and the largest number of women (seven) from a single country to scale Everest. In 2017, ten awards were presented, out of which six were given to the members of Navika Sagar Parikrama (circumnavigation of the globe). They were an all women Indian Navy officers sailing team for the circumnavigation of the globe, on board the Indian Navy Sailing Vessel Tarini (pictured), led by Lieutenant Commander Vartika Joshi. Chandraprabha Aitwal (pictured) is the only double recipient of the award, once in 1994 in the category of land adventure for being part of the 1993 Indo-Nepalese Women's Everest Expedition and the second time in 2009 in the category of lifetime achievement in the discipline of mountaineering. Before this award was introduced, the Arjuna award was also given for adventure sports and mountaineering; eight people have won both awards. Five expedition members of India's first successful bid to Mount Everest in 1965, Nawang Gombu, Gurdial Singh, Mohan Singh Kohli, H. P. S. Ahluwalia and Sonam Wangyal were awarded the lifetime achievement awards in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2017 respectively. They were all awarded the team Arjuna award in 1965. Bula Choudhury was awarded the Arjuna award in 1990 in the field of swimming and was presented with the adventure award in 2002 for lifetime achievement in the disciple of open water swimming.\nOver the years, a number of firsts and records in the adventure activities have been awarded. In the field of mountaineering, Love Raj Singh Dharmshaktu (awarded in 1999) has gone on to climb Everest seven times, the highest for an Indian. Arunima Sinha (awarded in 2014) became the world's first female amputee to scale Everest. Twins Tashi and Nungshi Malik (awarded in 2015) became the first twins in the world to complete Seven Summits and Explorers Grand Slam. Anshu Jamsenpa (awarded in 2017) is the fastest female double summiteer of Everest, doing so in five days. In the field of sailing, Dilip Donde (awarded in 2010) became the first Indian to circumnavigate the globe under sail solo and unassisted. Abhilash Tomy (awarded in 2012) bettered the record by being the first Indian to do it non-stop. In the field of skydiving, Rachel Thomas (awarded in 1994) became India's first female skydiver and Shital Mahajan (awarded in 2005) was the youngest woman to jump over both the poles. The award for lifetime achievement for year 2023 was awarded to Umesh Zirpe, for leading eight successful expeditions to eight 8000 m high mountains and for dedicating his life for mountaineering.\nControversies\nThe initial publication on 21 August 2020 of the 2019 awardees list had the name of mountaineer Narender Singh Yadav in the category of land adventure. His name in the list of awardees created controversy in the mountaineering circles in India and abroad. On 23 August, the Katmandu-based daily Kantipur published the photo that Singh had submitted to the authorities in Nepal as proof of reaching the Everest summit in 2016. The article explained how the photo in question was morphed. Several mountaineers pointed out the inaccuracies in the photo including the oxygen mask not having a pipe, no reflections on his sunglasses, flags he carried being still despite the high winds, no headlamps on his head and him wearing a helmet which is not worn by climbers on their summit day. His team leader Naba Kumar Phukon, rescue team member Lakhpa Sherpa and senior mountaineer Debashis Biswas attested to the fact that Singh never made it to the top of Everest and had to be helped down after getting stranded at the Balcony at 8,400&nbsp;m (27,600&nbsp;ft). Tenzing Norgay's son Jamling Norgay took up the matter and raised the issue with Indian Mountaineering Foundation. Soon after that, the Sports Ministry opened a probe into the claims, withholding the award on 28 August and in the list of awardees attending next day's ceremony, Singh's name was omitted. Jamling Norgay and Bachendri Pal expressed displeasure that such a person was even considered for the award in the first place. Jamling further noted that the awards should not be simply awarded to the Everest climbers, but to those who inspire other adventure seekers by scaling new peaks, exploring new routes and promoting adventure in general.\n}}\nExternal links\n*  (Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, India)"
