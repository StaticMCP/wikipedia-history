In March the party elected as its president Jean Alingué Bawoyeu, who had just left the position of Prime Minister. In the parliamentary election of 1997 the party took 4 seats and initially supported the president Idriss Déby. Before the parliamentary elections, between 1995 and 1997, the Prime Minister was Koibla Djimasta, himself of the UDR. During the previous presidential elections held in 1996 the party's candidate, Alingué, gained most of his votes in his native Tandjilé Prefecture, where he obtained the 39.69% of the popular vote, but also came second in the capital N'Djamena, where he took 16,52%.\nIn the following parliamentary election held in 2002, the UDC boycotted the vote as it believed there weren't sufficient guarantees of a free and fair election, in particular having requested to redo the electoral register.[http://www.afrique-express.com/archive/CENTRALE/tchad/tchadpol/245auxurnes.htm UNDR Saleh Kebzabo Jean Bawoyeu Alingue Ibni Oumar Mahamat Saleh]\nReferences"
