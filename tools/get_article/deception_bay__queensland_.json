The bay is shallow.  It contains some seagrass beds.\nGeography\nDeception Bay is in the most north-western part of Moreton Bay, north of the Redcliffe Peninsula and south of Bribie Island. The Caboolture River flows into the bay.  Increased urban development has seen the river bring sediment loadings into the bay.\nHistory\nIn 1823, John Oxley originally named it Pumice Stone River believing it was a river because it was very shallow. Its present name refers Oxley being deceived by its appearance.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
