The film portrays the life of Li Xin, a general of Qin, from his childhood as an orphan through his military career during the Warring States period of ancient China.\nKingdom was released nationwide on April 19, 2019, and it was screened in North America by Funimation in Q3 2019. Three sequels have been released: Kingdom 2: Far and Away (2022), Kingdom 3: The Flame of Destiny (2023) and Kingdom 4: Return of the Great General (2024).\nPlot\nOrphaned by war, Xin is sold as a slave to a small village, where he befriends Piao, another slave. Growing up, Xin and Piao train together, dreaming of escaping their low status and eventually becoming great generals. Chang Wen Jun visits their village in search of soldiers to aid the king Ying Zheng, but he will only accept Piao. Some time later a mortally wounded Piao appears at Xin's house, warning him that Ying Zheng's brother, Cheng Jiao, has started a power struggle and urging him to go to a point marked on a map he gives him. Xin sets off immediately, not knowing that his village has been set on fire and all the villagers murdered by Cheng Jiao's army.\nAt the meet-up point, Xin finds Ying Zheng, the king of Qin, where they are ambushed by a skilled Shukyou assassin. Xin realizes that Piao was accepted into the army to serve as Ying Zheng's double due to his bearing a resemblance to the king. Xin kills the assassin and the two escape through a mountain path with help from He Liao Diao, a mountain tribe child who had accompanied the bandits that had previously ambushed Xin. As the three reach the bamboo forest, they are attacked by another assassin. Despite blaming Ying Zheng for Piao's death, Xin defeats the assassin but is poisoned by one of his darts. The three take refuge at an ancient summer resort to help Xin recuperate, while Xin learns that Piao had voluntarily sacrificed himself to serve Ying Zheng, and about Ying Zheng's bitter rivalry with Cheng Jiao, his brother.\nYing Zheng's remaining army finally arrive at the summer resort, including Chang Wen Jun, who was previously assumed to have been killed by General Wang Qi. The army is outnumbered by Cheng Jiao's army of 80,000 soldiers, while Ying Zheng admits that Lü Buwei, the only person who can outmatch him, is also after the throne. Ying Zheng's chooses to seek out help from the Mountain Tribe, a former ally of the Qin royal family that had been betrayed 400 years ago. As they rise into the mountains, they are captured by the Mountain Tribe and brought forth to the chieftain, Yang Duan He. Yang Duan He orders Xin to be beheaded to test Ying Zheng's loyalty, but Xin's dedication to Ying Zheng's goal and mannerisms impress her, after which she announces that the Mountain Tribe will be affiliated with the Qin royalty again.\nYing Zheng's army arrives at the royal palace disguised as part of the Mountain Tribe, under the pretense of helping Cheng Jiao fight against Lü Buwei. Jie Shi, Cheng Jiao's advisor, allows only 50 people inside, and 10 of them to meet with Cheng Jiao. Just inside the gates, Ying Zheng initiates an attack, while Xin, Diao, and Bi use the underground passageway to reach the throne room and assassinate Cheng Jiao. Xin's group is intercepted by Zuo Ci, Ying Zheng's former general, who sends Lang Kai the Executioner after them. Xin kills Lang Kai with the help of the Mountain Tribe, and when they reach Cheng Jiao's room, Zuo Ci defeats Xin's group. Just when it seems Zuo Ci will succeed in killing the exhausted Xin, Xin's memory of Piao and belief in his own dreams brings him renewed strength and he kills Zuo Ci. Cheng Jiao's council flees, but Diao gouges out Jie Shi's eye with a dart and is stabbed by him before he dies. While Diao is safe thanks to wearing armor, Cheng Jiao uses their distraction to escape.\nIn the courtyard, Cheng Jiao confronts Ying Zheng, but is easily defeated. Ying Zheng spares Cheng Jiao, but beats him up to punish him for the suffering he caused. General Wang Qi and his army appear in the courtyard where he asks Ying Zheng what he will do as king and threatens to behead him if he does not provide a satisfactory answer. Ying Zheng vows to unite China under the Warring States period, even using force as a means to ensure that there would be peace in the future. Satisfied with his answer, General Wang Qi allies with Ying Zheng and orders Cheng Jiao's remaining army to retreat. With the battle won, Xin revels in the glory of making both his and Piao's dreams come true.\nCast\n* Kento Yamazaki as Li Xin (Shin)\n**Riku Ōnishi as young Xin\n* Ryo Yoshizawa as Piao (Hyou) and Ying Zheng (Eisei)\n**Ryōka Minamide as young Piao\n* Kanna Hashimoto as He Liao Diao (Ten)\n* Masami Nagasawa as Yang Duan He (Youtanwa)\n* Kanata Hongō as Cheng Jiao (Seikyou)\n* Shinnosuke Mitsushima as Bi\n* Masahiro Takashima as Lord Changwen (Shoubunkun)\n* Jun Kaname as Teng\n* Shinnosuke Abe as Ba Jiō\n* Wataru Ichinose as Ta Jifu\n* Tak Sakaguchi as General Zuo Ci (General Saji)\n* Ami 201 as Lang Kai\n* Yuhei Ouchida as Dun\n* Jun Hashimoto as Muta\n* Naomasa Musaka as village chief\n* Motoki Fukami as Vicious Scarlet\n* Takashi Ukaji as Wei Xing\n* Masaya Kato as Si Shi\n* Renji Ishibashi as Jie Shi\n* Takao Osawa as General Wang Qi (General Ouki)\nProduction\nProduction took place in Japan, and the filming occurred in China and Japan during April 2018.\nOn April 18, 2018, Hara tweeted a movie-ized cover illustration promoting the manga's move to the big screen.
