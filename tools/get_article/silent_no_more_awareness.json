It operates in collaboration with Priests for Life and Anglicans for Life to raise awareness about the negative impact of abortion.\nPosition and aims\nThe Silent No More Awareness Campaign has previously promoted the disproven abortion–breast cancer hypothesis, which suggests a connection between abortion and breast cancer. It has joined with other groups in protesting any modifications to the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.\nPublic notability\nSilent No More marchers at the 2013 March for Life (Washington, D.C.)\nAlveda King, niece of Martin Luther King Jr., frequently speaks on behalf of Silent No More. King herself has had two abortions and has spoken critically about the link between racism and abortion, referring to them as \"evil twins, born of the same lie\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.silentnomoreawareness.org Campaign Website]"
