Its catchment area included the Regierungsbezirk (administrative district) Posen and Regierungsbezirk Liegnitz from the Province of Silesia.\nThe Corps served in the Austro-Prussian War. During the Franco-Prussian War it was assigned to the 3rd Army.\nIn peacetime the Corps was assigned to the VIII Army Inspectorate but joined the 5th Army at the start of the First World War.  It was still in existence at the end of the war in Armee-Abteilung C, Heeresgruppe Gallwitz on the Western Front.  The Corps was disbanded with the demobilisation of the German Army after World War I.\nAustro-Prussian War\nV Corps fought in the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, seeing action in the Battle of Königgrätz.\nFranco-Prussian War\nDuring the Franco-Prussian War the Corps joined the 3rd Army.  It saw action in the opening battles of Weissenburg and Wörth, in the Battle of Sedan and in the Siege of Paris.\nPeacetime organisation\nThe 25 peacetime Corps of the German Army (Guards, I - XXI, I - III Bavarian) had a reasonably standardised organisation. Each consisted of two divisions with usually two infantry brigades, one field artillery brigade and a cavalry brigade each.  Each brigade normally consisted of two regiments of the appropriate type, so each Corps normally commanded 8 infantry, 4 field artillery and 4 cavalry regiments. There were exceptions to this rule:\n:V, VI, VII, IX and XIV Corps each had a 5th infantry brigade (so 10 infantry regiments)\n:II, XIII, XVIII and XXI Corps had a 9th infantry regiment\n:I, VI and XVI Corps had a 3rd cavalry brigade (so 6 cavalry regiments)\n:the Guards Corps had 11 infantry regiments (in 5 brigades) and 8 cavalry regiments (in 4 brigades).\nEach Corps also directly controlled a number of other units. This could include one or more\n:Foot Artillery Regiment\n:Jäger Battalion\n:Pioneer Battalion\n:Train Battalion\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\"\n|+Peacetime organization of the Corps\n!

Divisions received engineer companies and other support units from the Corps headquarters.  In summary, V Corps mobilised with 25 infantry battalions, 9 machine gun companies (54 machine guns), 8 cavalry squadrons, 24 field artillery batteries (144 guns), 4 heavy artillery batteries (16 guns), 3 pioneer companies and an aviation detachment.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\"\n|+Initial wartime organization of the Corps\n!
