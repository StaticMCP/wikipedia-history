The synagogue was \"built in 1921 to replace an earlier synagogue that was destroyed by fire.\" In 2002 the building was acquired by Haven Ministries and used as a non-denominational Pentecostal church.\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.\nHistory\nEstablished as a congregation in 1894, as Beth Israel or Temple Israel, the initial wooden synagogue, at 10 South Fairview Avenue, was constructed in 1900. Destroyed by fire on December 18, 1920, a replacement synagogue building located in the Oakley Park subdivision was completed in September 1922, located on the same site (as the street had been renamed). It is a two-story, rectangular, steel frame and brick building in the Classical Revival style. The front gable façade features an elaborate main entry with Ionic order stone columns. The synagogue closed in 2001.\nSubsequent to having closed as a synagogue, the building has been used as a Pentecostal church since 2002, occupied by Haven International Ministries.\nReferences"
