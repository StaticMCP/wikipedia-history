Cinema Crazed criticized the acting while praising the \"focus on characterization and engrossing scenarios\" which created \"an entertaining and interesting horror hybrid for the whole family!\". Scott Weinberg of FEARnet also reviewed the movie, stating that it was \"An admirable little indie that earns points for keeping a poker-straight face throughout all the craziness.\" Bryan Senn noted that the film's premise, which combined the genres of horror and war, had promise but that \"turned out to be a cinematic bridge too far, as its ambition far outstrips its abilities.\" Massawyrm of Ain't It Cool News reviewed the movie, stating that they weren't quite sure what to make of it and that \"Horrors of War is a film that is woefully out of its depth, a film so ambitious, so determined, and yet so big that its low budget simply cannot support it. \"\nSee also\n*\nList of zombie Nazi films\nNotes\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
