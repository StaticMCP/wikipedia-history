The law partially came into effect on 16 June 2017, and fully in effect on 1 May 2019 after the accession and enthronement of the new emperor, Naruhito.\nBackground\nAccording to the Imperial Household Law, the Emperor is \"on throne until death\". The Abdication Law, however, provides legal basis for the abdication of Akihito and the accession of Crown Prince Naruhito, and was described by the Chief Cabinet Secretary as \"setting up precedents for the future\".\nAkihito reportedly revealed his intention to abdicate on 22 July 2010 in a Palace Meeting, admitting his parents' illnesses in their later years, including cancer of Emperor Hirohito and dementia of Empress Kōjun, had impacted him hugely.\nNHK, a major Japanese public broadcaster, reported on 13 July 2016 and citing officials of Imperial Household Agency, that \"His Majesty the Emperor had expressed his intention to abdicate for Crown Prince Naruhito in the coming few years\". The Agency initially rejected the report as \"impossible\" and \"unrealistic\".\nOn 8 August, the Emperor made his second-ever televised address to the public. Akihito said his declining health means it is difficult to fulfil his duties, which strongly indicated his wish to abdicate as he was barred from making political statements according to the constitution. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the government would take the remarks seriously and discuss what could be done.\nLegislation\nThe cabinet convened 14 meetings on \"reducing the burden of Emperor's duties\" in 2016 and 2017. On 21 April 2017, the final report of the meetings was published which recommended the enactment of new law by the National Diet. The proposed bill would allow Akihito to abdicate and be conferred the title of \"Emperor Emeritus\", while Empress Michiko, wife of Akihito, will be called \"Empress Emeritus\". Both will retain the title of \"Majesty\". The Imperial Household Agency will be reformed by creating \"Department of Emperor Emeritus\" and \"Department of Crown Prince\".\nAll parliamentary parties were invited to send representatives over drafting of the bill by virtue of Article 1 of the Constitution, which said \"The Emperor shall be the symbol of the State and of the unity of the People, deriving his position from the will of the people with whom resides sovereign power.\"\nThe bill was agreed by the cabinet in the meeting on 19 May 2017, and was sent to the National Diet on the same day. Following discussion in a committee of the House of Representatives on 1 June, the bill was passed in the House of Representatives with a simple majority on the next day - noticeably that no independent member or parties indicate objection.\nThe House of Councillors, the upper house, then established the \"Special Bills Committee on the Law for Special Exception of the Imperial House Law concerning Abdication, etc. of Emperor\" for further discussion. The Councillors passed the bill on 9 June without objection, but the Liberal Party abstained from the vote, saying the abdication should be handled by the amendment to the Imperial Household Law. The law came into effect on 16 June.\n{|\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Bill for Special Exception of the Imperial House Law concerning Abdication, etc. of EmperorHouse of Representatives vote\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"| Party !!
