The attacks resulted in the success of Inong Balee forces and the death of de Houtman.\nBackground\nIn 1599, Dutch expedition commander Cornelis de Houtman arrived at the port of Aceh. The Sultan met him peacefully until de Houtman insulted him. The Dutchman had clashed with the Banten Sultanate in northwest Java. Upon his arrival in Aceh he hijacked many Aceh ships. Malahayati attacked the Dutch trader's ships by order of Sultan Alauddin Ri'ayat Syah.\nBattle\nMalahayati led her Inong Balee Army in response to the Dutch challenge and after several violent battles she avenged her husband's death by Dutch forces. On 11 September 1599 the Inong Balee forces attacked and Malahayati successfully expelled the two Dutch ships. Malahayati killed de Houtman in a duel and imprisoned Frederick de Houtman.\nAftermath\nAfter Cornelis got killed by Malahayati, his brother Frederick de Houtman was imprisoned by the Sultan. After this battle, the Inong Balee armies stormed many of the Dutch forts during the Second Dutch Expedition to the East Indies to force the Dutch to sign a treaty.\nLegacy\nBecause of the Acehnese victory in this battle, Malahayati is considered to be the first modern woman admiral.\nIn November 2017, President Joko Widodo awarded her honorary National Hero of Indonesia.\nReferences"
