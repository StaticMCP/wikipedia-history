German troops in Italy often massacred civilians in retaliation for partisan activity.\nTo a lesser extent, war crimes were committed by the National Republican Army (fascist Italian army), usually against Italian partisans, such as at the Salussola massacre, where 20 partisans were executed. Partisans, in retaliation, sometimes also massacred captured Fascist soldiers, like at the Rovetta massacre.\nList of massacres\nA list of massacres of either more than 100 victims or international notability:\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:120px;\"|Name\n! style=\"width:65px;\"|Date\n! style=\"width:120px;\"|Location\n! style=\"width:30px;\"|Deaths\n! style=\"width:120px;\"|Perpetrators\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Notes\n|-\n|Lake Maggiore massacres\n|September & October 1943\n|Lago Maggiore\n|56\n|1st SS Panzer Division\n|Murder of 56 predominantly Italian Jews despite strict German orders not to carry out any violence against civilians, also noted for the controversial court case in West Germany in the late 1960s.\n|-\n|Boves massacre\n|19 September 1943\n|Boves\n|23\n|1st SS Panzer Division\n|Massacre of 23 civilians in retaliation of the capture of two German soldiers despite the two having been freed in exchange for the promise that no reprisal against civilians would be carried out.
