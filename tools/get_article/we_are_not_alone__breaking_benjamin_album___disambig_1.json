It was released on June 29, 2004. Three singles were released from the album, \"So Cold\", \"Sooner or Later\", and the full-band version of \"Rain\". The album's name is a reference to a James Hilton novel of the same name. We Are Not Alone sold 48,000 copies in its first week and was certified platinum by the RIAA on June 13, 2005. It was the first Breaking Benjamin album to receive a Parental Advisory label.\nA Live EP was released with limited editions of the album, containing live recorded versions of \"Sugarcoat,\" \"Water,\" \"Medicate,\" and \"Next to Nothing\" from their first album Saturate.\nWe Are Not Alone is the last studio album to feature drummer Jeremy Hummel. The track \"Firefly\" was featured in the 2004 video games WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw and WWE Day of Reckoning.\nAccording to AllMusic critic Johnny Loftus, the album stylistically incorporates early Tool's sound through post-grunge's more accessible melodics.\n| total_length  = 42:51\n}}\n| title12       = Ordinary Man\n| length12      = 3:31\n| title13       = Lady Bug\n| length13      = 3:03\n| total_length  = 49:25\n}}\nPersonnel\n;Breaking Benjamin\n* Benjamin Burnley – lead vocals, rhythm guitar\n* Aaron Fink – lead guitar\n* Mark James Klepaski – bass guitar\n* Jeremy Hummel – drums and percussion (except on \"Rain\")\n;Additional musicians\n* David Bendeth – additional keyboards\n* Billy Corgan – additional guitar on \"Forget It\"\n* Wayne C.
