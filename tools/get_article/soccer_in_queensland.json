It is the most participated team sport in the state with 341,917 players in 2024 just under a third of which are female. The game in Queensland is administered by the peak body, Football Queensland, together with several subordinate zone councils, each representing regions of Queensland.\nHistory\nThe Brisbane Football Club (Queensland's first football club) formed in 1866 under Australian Rules football rules but dabbled in both soccer and rugby football for much of its history, but appears to have been involved in many of the early soccer matches in Brisbane from 1867 to 1870.\nThe earliest mention of matches under London Association rules is a July 1867 match Between Brisbane FC and the Volunteer Artillery World eleven. Volunteer Artillery later switched to Australian rules.\nBrisbane FC also played soccer at Woogaroo (now Goodna), west of Brisbane, in 1875 against the inmates and warders of the Woogaroo Lunatic Asylum.\"\nThe following year at a meeting at the Railway Hotel, Petrie Terrace in April 1876, a new club was being formed in Brisbane to play under London Association rules is made with the intention of starting a neighbourhood league.\nThe Anglo-Queensland Football Association (a predecessor of Football Queensland) began in 1884. The Brisbane Courier reported in early May 1884:\n:''A MEETING of those favourable to the \"Association\" game of football as played in the home countries was held at the Australian Hotel last night ... [I]t was resolved that it was desirable to form an Anglo-Queensland Football Association, and as a beginning the meeting formed the first club, the name selected being \"St. Andrew's Football Club.\" ... It was announced that already from twenty-seven to thirty promises to join the club had been received, and it was resolved to play a practice match tomorrow afternoon, if possible, in the Queen's Park.''\nThe first fixture match was played on 7 June 1884, on the Pineapple Sportsfield (now part of Raymond Park), Kangaroo Point (refer to History of association football in Brisbane, Queensland for more information).\nBy 1886, the game had spread west to Ipswich and then to other regional centres.\nAdministration of football in Queensland\nFootball Queensland\nFootball Queensland was preceded by a number of organisations:\n* 1884-1889: Anglo-Queensland Football Association\n* 1890-1919: Queensland British Football Association\n* 1920-1927: Queensland Football Association\n* 1928-1939: Queensland Soccer Council\n* 1940-1961: Queensland Soccer Football Association\n* 1962-2005: Queensland Soccer Federation\n* 2006-Present: Football Queensland\nQueensland Zones\nThe game is administered locally by zone councils:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Zone\n![https://footballqueensland.com.au/zones/ Site]\n|-\n|Football Queensland Central Coast\n|[https://fqcentralcoast.com.au/]\n|-\n|Football Queensland Darling Downs\n|[https://fqdarlingdowns.com.au/]\n|-\n|Football Queensland Far North & Gulf\n|[https://fqfarnorthgulf.com.au/]\n|-\n|Football Queensland Metro North & South\n|[https://www.fqmetro.com.au/]\n|-\n|Football Queensland North\n|[https://fqnorth.com.au/]\n|-\n|Football Queensland South Coast\n|[https://fqsouthcoast.com.au/]\n|-\n|Football Queensland Sunshine Coast\n|[https://fqsunshinecoast.com.au/]\n|-\n|Football Queensland Whitsunday Coast\n|[https://websites.mygameday.app/assoc_page.cgi?c=1-9337-0-0-0]\n|-\n|Football Queensland Wide Bay\n|[https://fqwidebay.com/]\n|}\nParticipation\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Registered players\n|-\n| 2021/22 || 211,923\n|-\n| 2023/24 || 217,749\n|}\nNational representation\nNational Soccer League (NSL) 1977-2004\nThere were a number of Queensland teams that played in the now defunct National Soccer League.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

However, the Fury team withdrew from the competition after season 2010-11, citing financial difficulties. Gold Coast United also left the A-league after the 2011-12 season. They have now reformed in August 2017 and currently compete in the National Premier Leagues Queensland.\nClub competitions\nQueensland statewide competitions\nThe Queensland State League (QSL) was established in 2008 to provide a second tier competition between the A-League and the Queensland regional competitions.  The QSL consisted of a single division, comprising nine teams without provision for promotion or relegation.\nIn 2013 the QSL was replaced by the National Premier Leagues Queensland (NPL Qld) which forms a division within the National Premier Leagues (NPL).  The winner (top of the table after the regular season) enters a national finals series against the winners of the other NPL divisions.  In 2018 the NPL Queensland will introduce promotion from and relegation to, a new league the Football Queensland Premier League.\nRegional competitions\nBelow the NPL Qld there are local competitions run in each of the zones.\nWomen's football\nBrisbane Roar have a team in the national W-League that represent Queensland's female footballers.\nSee also\n* Football Queensland\n* History of association football in Brisbane, Queensland\n* Association football in Australia\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.footballqueensland.com.au/ Football Queensland official website]"
