      "text": "# Draft:Rock House Trail (Hocking Hills)\n\nRock House is a naturally formed sandstone \"cave\" located in Hocking Hills State Park, Perry County, Ohio, and is the only true cave in the park's trail system.\nGeology & Description\nThe structure is a tunnel-like corridor carved into Blackhand sandstone along a 150-foot cliff. Its interior corridor extends approximately 200 feet, with a ceiling height of around 25 feet and several natural “window” openings.\nHistory\nEvidence suggests use by prehistoric Indigenous peoples (e.g., rock ovens known as \"hominy holes\") and later as shelter for pioneers and rumored hideout for outlaws, lending the site folklore significance.\nTrail access\nThe accessible loop trail is approximately 0.5 miles, from a picnic-area trailhead, with moderate elevation change etched by stone steps carved into the cliff. It is pet-friendly with daylight-only access.\nRecreation & Significance\nPopular for hiking, geology enthusiasts, historical interpretation, and photography—the Rock House is considered a signature feature among the seven primary scenic areas of Hocking Hills, attracting significant visitor traffic annually.\nSee also\n* Hocking Hills State Park\n* Cantwell Cliffs State Nature Preserve\n* Conkles Hollow State Nature Preserve\nReferences"
