He was a member of the House of Lords from 1994 to 1999.\nLife\nEducated at Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford, and Newcastle Polytechnic, Carlisle is the son of Charles Howard, 12th Earl of Carlisle.\nA member of the Howard family and a kinsman of the Duke of Norfolk, he is also a co-heir to the baronies of Greystock and Clifford.\nHe was commissioned as an officer into the 9th/12th Royal Lancers regiment of the British Army, retiring with the rank of Major.\nAs Viscount Morpeth, he unsuccessfully contested Easington in the 1987 general election and Leeds West in the 1992 general election as well as Northumbria in the 1989 European elections for the Liberal Democrats.\nHaving lost his automatic right to a seat in the House of Lords under the House of Lords Act 1999, Carlisle has stood as a Liberal Democrat in By elections to the House of Lords; his best performance was finishing a distant second to Labour's Viscount Hanworth in the 2011 by-election to replace Lord Strabolgi.\nCarlisle is an academic and commentator on Baltic States matters, having lived for some time in Tartu, Estonia. The President of Estonia has appointed him a Knight 1st Class of the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana.
