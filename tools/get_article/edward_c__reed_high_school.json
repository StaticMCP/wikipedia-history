Reed High School is a public secondary school in Sparks, Nevada and is one of three public high schools run by the Washoe County School District within the city of Sparks. The school was founded in the winter of 1974 to accommodate the growing population of students at Sparks High School's campus.\nHistory\nEdward C. Reed High School is named after Judge Edward C. Reed, Jr., a Senior United States District Judge for the District of Nevada. Before being appointed to the bench in 1979, Judge Reed was a Washoe County School Board Member from 1956 to 1959, and President of the School Board from 1959 to 1977.\n1976 was the first graduating class for Reed High. Sparks High School had a large influx of students prior to the opening of Reed High, that the school ran three shifts of students, with Seniors and Junior arriving for First period, Sophomores for Second Period, and Freshman arriving for Third Period.\nWhile the school was being built, the district held a vote of future students on what to name the school. Although students decided that the alliteration of Reed Raiders sounded best, the Reed Conquistadors was also a popular choice - garnering the second most votes.\nAs of 2025, a current expansion project is beginning, with it expected to be finished by somewhere in 2027.\nAcademics\nAs of the 2014–2015 school year, Edward C. Reed High School was unranked in the U.S. News & World Report national rankings of the best high schools.  The school's Advanced Placement (AP) participation was 45%, with a 54% pass rate.  The school exceeded both district and state average scores in subject proficiency in both English and mathematics.  As of 2015–2016, the school's test scores were very slightly above the state average in all subjects, but not significantly so.  AP participation had fallen to 19%, and SAT/ACT participation was at 32%.  The average graduation rate was 81%.  The average class size was 28.\nAthletics\nReed High School has a rich history in athletics winning numerous zone and state titles.

The year was capped off by two playoff wins (The first year of the playoff system) over perennial champions (Reno and Wooster) and a loss in the state championship game to Gorman 14–12 (11–1). It was also the first time a team from the North was represented in the title game by a team other than Reno or Wooster in more than 20&nbsp;years. That team, 36 players strong, saw eight seniors receive football scholarships from Division 1 through JC schools. It was the beginning of a long winning tradition in football.  Most notably kicker Mike Biselli who still holds the record for longest FG made 67 yards. He went on to become a three-year starter for the Stanford Cardinal. In 2004 the Reed Raiders defeated the McQueen Lancers 21–13 for their second Regional Championship, only to lose to Las Vegas High school in the first round of the state championship playoff.\nCross Country\nNorthern Nevada Championship Streak\nDuring the 2011 season the Reed Raiders were league champions and state runner up to Bishop Gorman of Las Vegas.
