The ward has existed since the May 2002 local elections and covers most of the Haverstock and Chalk Farm areas.\nIn 2018, the ward had an electorate of 9,115. The Boundary Commission projects the electorate to rise to 9,355 in 2025.\nHistory\nThe ward has been represented by three Labour Party councillors since the 2014 election.\nUpon its creation for the 2002 election, the seat elected three Labour councillors. After John Dickie resigned as a councillor in 2003, a by-election was held for the vacant position, which was won by Jill Fraser, a Liberal Democrat, with the Labour candidate coming second. She retained her seat in the 2006 election and was elected alongside two Labour candidates. Labour councillor Roy Shaw resigned his position in 2007 due to ill health, and in the subsequent by-election, Matt Sanders, a Liberal Democrat, was elected over the Labour candidate.\nCouncillor Syed Hoque defected from the Labour Party to join the Liberal Democrats in 2009, leaving the ward represented by three Liberal Democrats. Hoque's death in 2010 resulted in the 2010 election in Haverstock being delayed from 6 May to 25 May. The Liberal Democrats held all three seats.\nLabour regained all three seats in the 2014 election, defeating the incumbent Liberal Democrats, and retained their seats in the 2018 election. In 2019, Abi Wood stood down as a councillor, triggering a by-election held on the same day as the 2019 United Kingdom general election. The by-election was won by the Labour candidate, Gail McAnena Wood.\nThe ward will undergo minor boundary changes for the 2022 election.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=\"2\"|Term\n!Councillor\n!Party\n|-\n|style=\"background:\"|\n|2014–2022\n|Alison Kelly\n|Labour\n|-\n|style=\"background:\"|\n|2014–2022\n|Abdul Quadir\n|Labour\n|-\n|style=\"background:\"|\n|2019–2022\n|Gail McAnena Wood\n|Labour\n|}\nCamden council elections since 2022\nThere was a revision of ward boundaries in Camden in 2022.\n2022 election\n}}\n2002–2022 Camden council elections\n2019 by-election\n}}\n2018 election\n}}\n14.8\n}}\n12.9\n}}\n14.4\n}}\n7.2\n}}\n12.7\n}}\n1.1\n}}\n12.0\n}}\n2.4\n}}\n1.6\n}}\n0.9\n}}\n2.4\n}}\n1.6\n}}\n8.9\n}}\n2014 election\n}}\n6.3\n}}\n2010 election\n}}\n2007 by-election\n}}\n0.2\n}}\n3.0\n}}\n0.4\n}}\n3.2\n}}\n2006 election\n}}\n2003 by-election\n}}\n22.0\n}}\n15.8\n}}\n0.1\n}}\n9.4\n}}\n4.8\n}}\n2002 election\n}}\nReferences"
