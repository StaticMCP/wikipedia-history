In the , Sandgate had a population of 4,926 people.\nThe town became a popular destination for the people of Brisbane in the early 20th century and remains popular due to its coastline, including Lovers Walk along the bay between Sandgate and neighbouring Shorncliffe as well as Moora Park and Beach.\nGeography\nSandgate is situated on the coastline, along Bramble Bay part of Moreton Bay. The western border of the suburb is marked by the Gateway Motorway.\nThe Shorncliffe railway line (part of the Queensland Rail City network) enters the suburb from the south-west (Deagon) and exits to the south (Shorncliffe) with Sandgate railway station in Chubb Street off Rainbow Street () serving the suburb.\nThe Deagon Wetlands are in the west of the suburb (); they are part of the North East Wetlands of Brisbane.\nDowse Lagoon is in the centre of the suburb (). It was officially named on 15 November 1975 after Thomas Dowse who settled in the Sandgate area in 1853. Einbunpin Lagoon is a smaller lagoon to the south-east of Dowse Lagoon ().\nHistory\nThe Turrbul people inhabited the seashore, the creeks and lagoons from Nudgee Beach to the Pine River. They were a branch of the clan of the Yugarabul speaking people. This larger clan inhabited the area from North Brisbane and along the coastline of Nudgee, Sandgate to Caboolture. In their language the local Turrbal clan called their coastal land \"Warra\" meaning \"an open sheet of water\". This land is now called Shorncliffe, Sandgate and Brighton. Their existence depended upon their knowledge of the seasons and their surroundings. Spears, nullas and boomerangs were used in hunting and woven nets for fishing.\nThe British settlers originally called the area Cabbage Tree Creek (after the creek).\nThe town was named Sandgate by James Burnett, an early surveyor in the region after the seaside town of Sandgate in Kent, England. Sandgate in Kent had a military camp, Shorncliffe Camp, on top of the cliffs adjacent to it. Sandgate in Brisbane has an adjacent suburb called Shorncliffe named after the camp in Kent, again by Burnett, after the similarity of the cliffs.\nLand in Sandgate became available on 9 November 1853, allowing a small seaside settlement to develop. One of the first structures built at Sandgate was a Native Police barracks, from where officers such as the Frederick Wheeler conducted punitive raids against local aboriginals.\nOn 25 May 1872, Robert Travers Atkin, a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, died at Sandgate following an illness of some months. At his request, he was buried in Sandgate on the crest of the rise on which he had enjoyed sitting under the shade of the trees and looking out onto Moreton Bay. His will provided £50 to build a church beside his grave. This church was the first St Margaret's church (and is now used as the rectory). A monument was erected to his memory by the members of the Hibernian Society of Queensland, of which he was vice-president.\nIn August 1873, a public meeting was held to establish a school. There were about 50 school-age children in Sandgate and nearly £70 was donated towards the establishment of a school. Sandgate State School opened on 15 September 1873 under teacher William R. Barfoot in the chapel of the first Baptist Church in Loudon Street (not to be confused with the Sandgate Baptist Church in Flinders Street which opened in 1887). The first permanent school building opened in 1874.\nBy 1874, coach services connected Sandgate to Brisbane.\nIn December 1879, allotments in the Town of Sandgate were auctioned by John Cameron. A map advertising the auction states the land available was subdivisions 1 to 14, of allotments 8, 9, 10 and part of 7, Sec. 3, Town of Sandgate. The map shows allotments bordered by Friday, Yundah and Kate Streets, now in Shorncliffe.\nIn January 1880, a plan of subdivisions 1 to 32 of Portion 73, Town of Sandgate, was advertised for sale, with interested persons to apply to William Potts, Queen Street, Brisbane. The map advertising the sale includes the location of the proposed railway terminus, and situates the proposed subdivisions between a lagoon and the esplanade. Newspaper advertisements describe the proposed subdivisions as \"choice marine villa sites\".\nOn 29 April 1880, Sandgate was proclaimed a municipality known as the Borough of Sandgate. The Local Authorities Act 1902 replaced all Divisions and Boroughs with Towns and Shires, creating the Town of Sandgate on 31 March 1903. This new status meant a town council was formed to guide the development of the local area. Initially, the council chambers were located in Shorncliffe. However, following a fire which destroyed the council chambers in 1910, a much larger town hall was opened in 1911. The Sandgate Town Hall was extensively renovated in 2011 to mark the 100th anniversary of the hall. The Sandgate Town Council, which operated from 1880 to 1925, had to provide a range of services for the growing community. These included a fire department, ambulance, and sanitation facilities, as well as maintaining roads and regulating local development. In October 1925 the Town of Sandgate was amalgamated into the City of Brisbane.\nA Church of England was built in Signal Row on the corner of Yundah Street (), then the centre of the developing town. It was opened and dedicated on Sunday 12 December 1880 by Bishop Matthew Hale. It was a timber church  and able to accommodate 150 people. It was designed by architect FDG Stanley and built by contractors Woodward and Betts of Brisbane. In September 1886 it was announced that it would be dedicated to St Nicolas, the patron saint of sailors and sea-farers, a common practice in seaside towns. In 1887 it was enlarged which involved re-orienting the building on the block so the chancel was to the south rather than to the original east. In 1930 the undercroft was enclosed with bricks to form a church wall. The church closed in 1988. The Queensland Government purchased the church and incorporated it into Shorncliffe State School but subsequently demolished it due to extensive termite damage. Its stained glass windows were preserved and are now in St Margaret's Anglican Church.\nThe first Catholic Church was opened on 25 September 1881. It was a small brick building which remains in use as the office of the Sacred Heart Primary School.\nThe coming of the railway in 1882 promoted more rapid development of the Sandgate area. Travel to Brisbane by train could be completed in less than half an hour.\nOn 12 August 1882 the Garden Estate, Sandgate was advertised for auction by James R. Dickson. An estate map shows the 61 blocks making up the estate at the area bounded by Rainbow and Friday Streets.\nThe Sandgate Baptist church opened on the corner of Cliff Street and Flinders Parade in 1887. It has since undergone multiple restorations, yet has continued to remain in its original structure. It is no longer operating as a church, being now used as a child care centre.\nOn Sunday 25 September 1892, the new Sacred Heart Catholic Church was opened and blessed by Cardinal Francis Moran assisted by Archibshop of Brisbane Robert Dunne. The former church building was to be used to establish a school.\nSacred Heart Catholic School opened on Monday 23 January 1893 in the former church. It opened with an initial enrolment of 50 students was operated by three Sisters of Mercy from the All Hallows' Convent in Fortitude Valley. The first principal was Sister Mary Borgia. The school also provided boarding facilities for some years. A purpose-built school building was constructed in 1920. The school provided secondary education until 1980 when St John Fisher College opened in neighbouring Bracken Ridge. In 1995 principal Sister Mary O'Donoghue retired and Glenda Honan was appointed as the first lay principal.\nLand for a Methodist church was purchased in Brighton in 1914. In January 1917, a small Sunday school was opened on the site. In 1919, a Methodist church building was relocated from Killarney (where it had opened in 1902) to the Brighton site, where it was erected and officially opened on Saturday 5 June 1920. On Saturday 2 December 1939, 500 people attended the opening of a new church building by Reverend F. A. Malcolm, the President of the Methodist Conference. The previous church was relocated to the rear of the site to be used as a Sunday school hall. In 1977, the church joined in the amalgamation that created the Uniting Church in Australia becoming the Brighton Uniting Church. The church at 41 Deagon Street () was closed circa 1999, and was later sold and the church and hall (the former church) were converted into a house. It is now within the suburb boundaries of Sandgate. It is listed on the Brisbane Heritage Register.\nOn 27 December 1920, 33 building sites in the Nashville Heights Estate were advertised for auction by Lyons & Coaldrake. A map showing the allotments, which are in the area currently bounded by Alexandra Street, Nash Street, Darling Street and Borella Street, notes the blocks' proximity to the Sandgate Central Station, beach, state school and post office.\nSandgate boasted clean beaches that were a popular weekend destination, with thousands of people visiting from Brisbane to escape the heat. Boating, swimming and golf were the most common sporting activities. Moora Park () was the location for dances and open-air films.\nSandgate Library opened in 1952 with a major refurbishment in 1996.\nThe Sandgate Little Theatre Group was established in 1958. They perform in the Sandgate Town Hall. Now known as Sandgate Theatre Incorporated, this community theatre group hosts Brisbane's longest running community theatre festival, the Yarrageh Drama Festival, which is held in August and September each year at the town hall.\nSandgate Infants State School was separated from Sandgate State School in 1955. It was amalgamated back into Sandgate State School in 1971.\nSandgate District State High School opened on 26 January 1959. Due to delays in the construction of the first school building, the first classes were taught in the Sandgate Town Hall.\nSandgate Opportunity School opened on 26 April 1960. It was later renamed Sandgate Special School. It closed on 15 December 1995.\nIn June 1990, the Uniting Church in Australia congregations of Boondall, Brighton, Sandgate and Shorncliffe decided to amalgamate. Their new Sandgate Uniting Church in Deagon was opened  in Sunday 20 November 1994.\nDemographics\nIn the , Sandgate had a population of 4,626 people, 51.4% female and 48.6% male.
