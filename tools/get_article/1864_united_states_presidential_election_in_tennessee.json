The state legislature chose 10 electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. However, due to Tennessee’s prior secession and allegiance to the Confederacy, all votes from the state were rejected.\nTennessee voted for the National Union candidate, incumbent Republican President Abraham Lincoln. The state (along with Louisiana) chose electors for the election after being captured early in the American Civil War. However, due to issues related to the Civil War, their votes were rejected.\nThe Chicago Tribune reported that about 30,000 votes were cast for Lincoln and 5,000 for Democratic candidate George B. McClellan, but that many ballot boxes were destroyed by Confederate guerrillas and thus the exact number was not known. In marked contrast, Anne H. Hopkins and William Lyons claim Lincoln won 99.2% of 17,264 votes cast in Tennessee, without specifying the exact number of votes for either ticket.\nIf these figures are taken to be correct or even remotely close to correct, then Lincoln's share of the total vote is the best Republican performance ever in Tennessee for a presidential election.\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Tennessee\nFootnotes\nReferences"
