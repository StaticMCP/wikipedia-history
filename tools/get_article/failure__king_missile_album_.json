However, Lollipop Magazine's Scott Hefflon wrote that \"while subtly clever at times, Failure provides no instant gratification such as 'Detachable Penis' [and] 'Jesus Was Way Cool,'\" and \"certainly has its moments, but the musical noodling is distracting and there're only a few \"must-have\" tracks here.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nAdapted from the Failure liner notes.\nKing Missile\n* Bradford Reed&nbsp;– pencilina, piano, organ, synthesizer, drums, percussion, backing vocals, engineering, photography\n* Charles Curtis&nbsp;– cello, guitar, backing vocals\n* Sasha Forte&nbsp;– violin, viola, bass guitar, backing vocals, production\n* John S.
