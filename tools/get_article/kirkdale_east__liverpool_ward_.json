The Kirkdale East ward was created as a single-member ward from the north-eastern corner of the former Kirkdale ward. The ward boundaries follow Spellow Lane, Walton Lane, Everton Valley, Kirkdale Road, Smith Street, Westminster Road, behind Antonio Street to the junction with Cambridge Road cutting across to Carisbrooke Street.}}\nNotes\nReferences"
