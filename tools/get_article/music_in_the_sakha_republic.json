Its most distinctive national instrument is the khomus, a lamellophone.\nThe Yakut people are a large ethnic group in Sakha. They are known for an epic poem called Olonkho. This epic is performed a cappella, generally at festivals, always by one man alone. The timbre and tone of the singer reveal the roles of the different characters.\nThe Republic has been represented in the Turkvision Song Contest since 2013, participating under the name Yakutia in the Turkvision Song Contest.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160612221641/http://doydu.sakhaopenworld.org/ Orto Doydu] - Sakha Cultural Portal, has a collection of songs and music in MP3 and lyrics (in Sakha)\n* [http://khatylaev.sakhaopenworld.org/ German and Klavdia Khatylaev] - Sakha Music\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20010515021140/http://pages.ykt.ru/dups/ DUPSY group] - ethnomusic based an ancient Sakha melodies"
