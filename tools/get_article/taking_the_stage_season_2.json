It continued to follow the trials and tribulations of students at SCPA.  This season the series changed it format from 1 hour episodes, to a 30-minute format, despite a couple of episodes. It has been confirmed by several students from the class of 2010 that the cast of this season were not in fact real students of the school, excluding Tyler Nelson, who graduated and returned to reprise his role in season 1. MTV found them in various states and they were hired to act in a \"situational reality\" series. In this season, unlike last, the cast is interviewed so the viewer can hear their thoughts during the show unlike last season where the viewer had to rely on simply conversations, facial expressions, and the soundtracks.\nThis is the final season of the series.\nCast\nThe following is a list of cast members presents in this season.\n*  Main Cast Member\n*  Secondary Cast Member\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:silver\"\n!
