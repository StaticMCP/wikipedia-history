Voters chose twelve representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President. Kentucky had gained four electors compared to the previous election in 1808.\nKentucky cast twelve electoral votes for the Democratic-Republican candidate and incumbent President James Madison over the other Democratic-Republican and Federalist supported candidate DeWitt Clinton. The electoral votes for Vice president were cast for Madison's running mate Elbridge Gerry from Massachusetts. The state was divided into three electoral districts with four electors each, whereupon each district's voters chose the electors.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1812 United States presidential election in Kentucky\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#008000; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic-Republican\n| James Madison (incumbent)\n| align=\"right\" | 8,501\n| align=\"right\" | 95.2%\n| align=\"right\" | 12\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#F0F071; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic-Republican/Federalist\n| DeWitt Clinton\n| align=\"right\" | 433\n| align=\"right\" | 4.8%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | Totals\n| align=\"right\" | 8,934\n| align=\"right\" | 100.0%\n| align=\"right\" | 12\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Kentucky\nNotes\nReferences"
