Starring David Oyelowo, Lupita Nyong'o, and Madina Nalwanga, the film depicts the life of Phiona Mutesi, a girl living in Katwe, a slum of Kampala, the capital of Uganda. She learns to play chess and becomes a Woman Candidate Master after her victories at World Chess Olympiads.\nAdapted from an ESPN magazine article and book by Tim Crothers, the film was produced by Walt Disney Pictures and ESPN Films. Queen of Katwe was screened at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival. The film had a limited release in the United States on September 23, 2016, before a general theatrical release on September 30. It received positive reviews from critics and was nominated for many awards, winning a few of them.\nPlot\nLiving in Katwe, a slum in Kampala, Uganda, is a constant struggle for 10-year-old Phiona Mutesi (Madina Nalwanga), her mother Nakku Harriet (Lupita Nyong'o) and younger members of her family. She and her younger brother help their mother sell maize in the market. She also helps care for her baby brother. Her world changes one day when she meets Robert Katende (David Oyelowo) at a missionary program. Katende coaches football and teaches children to play chess at a local center. Curious, Phiona approaches and learns the game. She becomes fascinated with the game and soon becomes a top player in the group under Katende's guidance.\nHer coach, over the initial opposition of the local chess authorities, takes her and the team to a national school level tournament at a prestigious local school. The group initially finds itself ill at ease among the other participants and the more affluent surroundings.  However, their talent wins the day and Phiona comes in first place.\nThe film then proceeds to trace the ups and downs of success at competitions and tournaments for Phiona and her fellow Pioneers.  The struggles of life in Katwe are ever present and Phiona hopes that chess will provide a means of escape from Katwe for her and her family.\nPhiona leads the Uganda team at the Chess Olympiad in Russia, confident that she will become a Grandmaster, securing the necessary finances to lift her family out of poverty.  However, the competition proves too tough, and she yields to her Canadian opponent.\nPhiona returns to Katwe, dejected and doubting her abilities.  However, with the support of Coach Katende and the people of Katwe, she returns to chess, ultimately succeeding to the extent that she can purchase a home for her family.\nCast\n* Madina Nalwanga as Phiona Mutesi\n* David Oyelowo as Robert Katende\n* Lupita Nyong'o as Nakku Harriet\n* Martin Kabanza as Mugabi Brian\n* Taryn \"Kay\" Kyaze as Night, Phiona's older sister\n* Ronald Ssemaganda as Ivan\n* Ethan Nazario Lubega as Benjamin\n* Nikita Pearl Waligwa as Gloria Nansubuga, Phiona's friend\n* Edgar Kanyike as Joseph\n*Esther Tebandeke as Sara Katende\n*Peter Odeke as Mr. Barumba\n*Sheebah Karungi as Shakira\n*Joanitta Bewulira-Wandera as Mrs. Gali\n*Maurice Kirya as Theo\n*Ntare Mwine as Tendo,\n*Gladys Oyenbot as Shopkeeper\n*Rehema Nanfuka Nurse\n*Sarah Kisawuzi as Katende's Grandmother\n*Richard Tuwangye as Dez\n*Joel Okuyo Prynce as Ggaba Merchant\n*Russel Savadier as Russian Chess Official\n*Zohran Mamdani as Bookie Student\n*Aaron Moloisi as Rwabushenyi Official\n*Carina Nel as Kagramanov, a Canadian player\n*Maggie Benedict as Chess Federation Secretary\n*Rori Motuba as Christine Namaganda\n*Rayan Ssewanyana as Chess Pioneer\nProduction\nQueen of Katwe is a biographical sports drama film\nDevelopment\nTim Crothers wrote the book ''The Queen of Katwe: A Story of Life, Chess, and One Extraordinary Girl's Dream of Becoming a Grandmaster'', which chronicled Phiona Mutesi's life. Published by ESPN in 2012, it was optioned that same year by Walt Disney Pictures. Tendo Nagenda, Walt Disney Studios' senior creative executive, who is from a Ugandan ethnic group, developed the project into production. With executive approval from studio president Sean Bailey, Nagenda went to visit Mira Nair at her Ugandan home to recruit her to direct a film about Mutesi. Nair was captivated by the story, stating, \"I have always been surrounded by these local stories but hadn’t done anything in Uganda since 1991. I love any story about people who make something from what appears to be nothing.\"\nNair directed the film with the script written by William Wheeler. Mira Nair met with Mutesi, her mother Harriet, and the chess group run by coach Robert Katende. She invited screenwriter William Wheeler to come to Kampala to conduct interviews with the principal figures as a foundation for a screenplay. Nair filmed a high-concept short and presented it to Disney, to alleviate the studio's concerns about the film being entirely set in Africa.\nWheeler believed that the film could fit within the Disney tradition of films about \"underdog\" sports stories, noting that:\n\"we were trying to ... gently expand the idea of what a 'Disney film' could be. Disney was very open to wanting to tell an aspirational story about someone from someplace that is not at all familiar to Western audiences ... this could really fit into one of the things that they do very well – which is telling sports underdog stories and finding the ways the story naturally intersects with that genre of film.\"Nair described Queen of Katwe as \"a radical film for Disney in many ways.... It has beauty and barbarity side-by-side.\" In January 2015, Disney studio chairman Alan F. Horn greenlit the film into production for US$15&nbsp;million.\nNair's son, Zohran Kwame Mamdani, is listed as third assistant director on the IMDb entry for the film.\nCasting\nIn January 2015, David Oyelowo and Lupita Nyong'o were cast as Robert Katende and Harriet Mutesi, respectively. They were Nair's first choices for the roles. Nyong'o said that she had decided to play the part after reading the script's first ten pages, saying \"It was the first time I felt really awakened by a script and super challenged.\" Oyelowo immediately accepted the role, seeing the film as a \"subversive work\", given the lack of diversity in contemporary American cinema. Nair said that finding an actress to play Phiona was the most difficult. The casting search lasted from July to December 2014 and the production team auditioned nearly 700 girls. The casting director found Madina Nalwanga in a community dance class. The 15-year-old Ugandan dancer was cast as Phiona.\nNair's son Zohran featured as an extra (\"Bookie student\") in the film.\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began in April 2015. The film was shot in the Katwe slums in Kampala, Uganda and in Johannesburg, South Africa. More than one hundred Ugandans were hired as extras for the street scenes; eighty had no prior experience with cameras. Nair set up an acting boot camp to help prepare the children for their scenes. Most professional Ugandan actors settled for roles as extras, including Gladys Oyenbot who acted as Lupita's stand-in double.\nNair and cinematographer Sean Bobbitt used different visual approaches for the various matches which Mutesi plays. Katende, who was present at the shoot, designed the games, while Nair and Bobbitt worked on each shot. The chess scenes were complicated because the call sheet contained actual chess moves. Nair and editor Barry Brown cut the scenes to create some drama. Production wrapped in June 2015 after 54 days of shooting.\nMusic\nQueen of Katwe (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)}}\nThe musical score for Queen of Katwe was composed by Alex Heffes. Heffes added that \"It's a very thematic and gentle score that is more orchestral than something like Roots, although it's set in Africa [...] There are plenty of authentic Ugandan needle drop tracks in the film to set the scene so the score could concentrate more on the music story telling.\"\nLinda Cohen, along with Nair's son Zohran, were music supervisors on the film, for which they were nominated for the Guild of Music Supervisors Award for Best Music Supervision for Films Budgeted Under $25 Million. One of Zohran's songs, performed with his friend Ugandan rapper HAB, under his rapper pseudonym Young Cardamom, \"#1 Spice\", featured in the film. Zohran also curated and produced the soundtrack.\nAlicia Keys wrote and recorded the song \"Back to Life\" for the film; it was released on September 9, 2016, by RCA Records.\nThe official soundtrack album was released on September 23 by Walt Disney Records, with its deluxe edition also releasing the same day.\nEconomic benefit\nThe film reportedly injected 29.5 million Ugandan Shillings into Kampala's economy and created employment for 400 people.\nRelease\nQueen of Katwe had its world premiere at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival on September 10. Disney held the corporate premiere at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood on September 20, with another screening at the Urban World Festival on September 22. The African premieres were held in Kampala on October 1 and Johannesburg on October 5. The film had its European debut at the 2016 BFI London Film Festival on October 9.
