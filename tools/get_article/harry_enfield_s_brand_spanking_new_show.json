It was first broadcast on Sky 1 in 2000 for one series.\nThe series followed Enfield's first project ''Harry Enfield's Television Programme. Seven years later, Enfield returned with Harry and Paul'', once again on the BBC. Enfield admitted in 2010 that he didn't give the series his full attention, as he was involved in the editing of Kevin & Perry Go Large at the same time as the show's production, so the show suffered as a result.\nA compilation of some of the best sketches from the series was released on DVD in 2002.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
