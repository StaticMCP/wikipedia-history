After the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922, it was not represented in the UK Parliament, as Laois was no longer part of the United Kingdom.\nBoundaries\nThis constituency comprised the western part of Queen's County now known as County Laois.\nThe Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 defined the division as including the Baronies of Clandonagh, Clarmallagh, Maryborough West, Tinnahinch, and Upper Woods, and that part of the Barony of Portnahinch contained within the parish of Ardea.\nMembers of Parliament\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member!!Party\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 1885\n| Arthur O'Connor a\n| Irish Parliamentary Party\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 1886\n| Stephen O'Mara\n| Irish Parliamentary Party\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 1886\n| William Archibald Macdonald\n| Irish Parliamentary Party\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 1892\n| Eugene Crean\n| Irish National Federation\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 1900\n| William P.
