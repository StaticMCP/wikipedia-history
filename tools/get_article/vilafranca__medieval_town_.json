The phenomenon assumed particular characteristics in north-central Italy, with multiple \"Villanuova\".\nThese new settlements did not arise spontaneously, but were always the result of the initiative of the territorial lords or, in most cases, of ordinary citizens who proceeded to found a Vilafranca or a Vilanova to extend their control over the territory. and increase their income. In most cases, the main reason for the new foundation was political, but military or economic reasons related to territorial control could also be involved. The new foundations were not always successful. During the Middle Ages there were cases of bankruptcy that can be attributed to various reasons, including: lack of commitment and planning by the institutions; lack of cohesion among the inhabitants of the new community. The founder of the new settlement encouraged, or sometimes forced, the peasants to settle in the new settlements by granting them less heavy taxation or even tax exemption for a certain period of time, hence the name vilafranca.\nAlthough unique models cannot be produced for these new foundations, archaeologists have found some recurring features in these new settlements. They are planned settlements, often inspired by the mother city, with an orthogonal plan and generally defended by a wall; The internal plot, quite regular, has a central square, around which the main buildings (such as the town hall and the church) and houses are built, built in rows and in lots pre-established at the time of design.\nThese villages usually consisted of no more than 200 houses and many of them disappeared with the agrarian crisis of the fourteenth century.\nEquivalent place names\n* Equivalent place names of Vilafranca in other languages are: villafranca (Italian), villefranche (French), vilafranca (Portuguese), villafranca (Spanish), Freistadt, Freiburg/Freiburgo, Fristrup, Freyburg (German).\n* Equivalent place names of Vilanova in other languages are: villanuova (Italian), villeneuve (French), vilanova (Portuguese), villanueva (Spanish), Freistadt, Freiburg/Freiburgo, Fristrup, Freyburg (German)\nReferences\nBibliography\n* P.
