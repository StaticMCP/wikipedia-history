According to Armenian medieval chronicles, these incursions triggered military action by the Bagratuni king to secure his southwestern borders.\nBattle\nWhile precise troop figures and the emir’s name are not preserved, the chronicles assert that Ashot III led a royal force into the Aghdznik region in 959. In the ensuing confrontation, Armenian forces achieved a decisive victory, inflicting heavy casualties upon the Arab contingent. This outcome effectively ended the threat from the emirate for several years.\nAftermath\nAs a result of the victory at Aghdznik, Ashot III consolidated his authority over southwestern Armenian provinces and secured vital trade and military routes along the Araxes. This success also contributed to the overall stability that facilitated Armenia's golden age under Bagratuni royal patronage.\nLegacy\nThe Battle of Aghdznik is commemorated in Armenian historiography as a symbolic assertion of indigenous royal power over external Arab influence. It also prefigures the political consolidation that made Ani a flourishing medieval capital.\nReferences"
