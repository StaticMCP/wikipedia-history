These wards replaced 72 older wards, and were themselves replaced by a set of 22 wards for the fourth general election in 2007.\nThe Highland Council (Comhairle na Gaidhealtachd in  Gaelic) had become a local government authority in 1996, when the two-tier system of regions and districts was abolished and the Highland region became a unitary council area, under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994. The first Highland Council election, however, was one year earlier, in 1995. Until 1996 councillors shadowed the regional and district councils and planned for the transfer of powers and responsibilities. Elections to the council are normally on a four-year cycle, all wards being contestable at each election.\nFor the periods 1995 to 1999 and 1999 to 2007, each ward elected one councillor by the first past the post system. In 2007, this arrangement was replaced with one of multi-member wards, each electing three or four councillors by the single transferable vote system, to produce a form of proportional representation.\nThe wards used from 1995 to 1999 had been subdivisions of eight council management areas, with councillors elected from each area forming an area committee. The wards created in 1999, however, were not exactly subdivisions of the management areas, management area boundaries were not adjusted to take account of new ward boundaries and, therefore, area committees ceased to be exactly representative of areas for which they were named and for which they took decisions.\nIn 2007, the management areas were replaced with three new corporate management areas, each consisting of a whole number of the new multi-member wards.\nLists of wards, 1999 to 2007\nWards are listed by management area to which linked for area committee purposes.\nBadenoch and Strathspey wards\nThere were five wards related to the Badenoch and Strathspey management area:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Letters patent refer, however, to the 'Town of Inverness' and, although there is a former 'royal burgh' which had defined boundaries, there is no 'town' with such boundaries.\n'Urban Inverness', below, refers to the area centred on the former royal burgh and generally urban in character during the 1999 to 2007 period.\nThere were 23 wards related to the management area:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
