The story starts in the spring of 1948, when Hasil works in the kitchen of the National Security Corps in Zvonková as a cook. He is twenty-four years old. He experienced the war in a German labor camp and among partisans. He is not interested in politics at all, but the rapidly closing borders, the fear of the World War III and his ability to transfer through the Šumava mountains from East to West predestined him to become a smuggler. David Jan Žák's novel is based on Hasil's memories, eyewitness accounts and archive documents.\nCast\n*Oskar Hes as Josef Hasil\n*Jan Nedbal as Bohumil Hasil\n*Halka Třešňáková as Rozálie Hasilová\n*Vojtěch Vodochodský as Zdeněk Vyleta\n*Jan Hájek as František Vávra\n*Jana Pidrmanová as Anna Vávrová\n*Gabriela Heclová as Marie Vávrová\n*Jan Jankovský as Antonín Podzimek\n*Kryštof Mucha as Václav Kott\n* as Vlasta, Josef's lover\n*Judit Bárdos as Klára, Josef's lover\n*Denis Šafařík as Mlíčňák\n*Petr Forman as hlídač Jaromír\n*Jaroslav Plesl as second lieutenant Machart\n*Jiří Zeman as Egon Brodský\n*Daniela Hirsch as Anna Bezcená\nProduction\nSeason 1\nFilming took place from March to May 2022, and the crew completed 25 filming days at locations in the Central Bohemian, Plzeň and South Bohemian regions.
