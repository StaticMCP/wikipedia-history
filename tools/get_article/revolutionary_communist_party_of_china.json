The party's members fled from mainland China after the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of China seized power in 1949, and its activities have since been limited to Hong Kong. Since 1974, the party has been legally active as the October Review, its official publication.\nPerformance in elections\nLegislative Council elections\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|- align=center\n!
