During his career at the Morton he raised hybrid elms, maples, planes, poplars and mulberries. He also traveled extensively, making  a total of five expeditions to China, and three to the former Soviet Union. Ware remained a  Research Associate of the Morton Arboretum until 2009.\nElm research\nWare soon realized the potential of disease-resistant Asiatic elms as urban trees, leading a party of Morton botanists and horticulturists to northern China in 1990, followed by participation in the USDA-sponsored expedition to China in 1995. Through contacts established with the Chinese, Ware was to receive regular consignments of elm seed from 1990, which greatly enhanced the Morton Arboretum's elm collection.\nPersonal life\nWare married, in 1955, June (née Gleason) (d. 2010), who bore him four sons.\nDeath\nGeorge Ware died of complications arising from pancreatic cancer at Holy Cross Hospital in Chicago on 4 July 2010.\nEponymy\nThe hybrid oak Quercus × warei (Quercus robur f. fastigiata × Quercus bicolor), commonly known as the 'Long Oak', was named for him.\nHonors and awards\n* Gold Seal Award of the National Council of State Gardens (1994)\n* American Foresters' Urban Forestry Research Awards (1997)\n* Hutchinson Medal, Chicago Botanic Garden (1997)\n* Norman J Colman Award, American Nursery and Landscape Association (1996)\n* Award of Merit, Illinois Arborist Association (1996)\n* Award of Merit, American Public Gardens Association (2001)\n* Liberty Hyde Bailey Award, American Horticultural Association (2002)\n* Conservation leadership Award, Openlands Association (2005)\n* L C Chadwick Award for Arboricultural Research, International Society for Arboriculture (2008)\nSelected publications\n* Ware, G.
