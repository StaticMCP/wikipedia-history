The mission, part scientific inquiry and part reconnaissance for a potential invasion, was ultimately thwarted by the vast and impassable Sudd swamp in what is now South Sudan.\nHistory\nAround 61 AD Emperor Nero sent a small group of praetorian guards to explore the sources of the Nile in Africa. The Roman legionaries navigating the Nile from southern Egypt initially reached the city of Meroë and later moved to the Sudd, where they had difficulties going further.\nSeneca wrote about this exploration and detailed that the sources were from a big lake in central Africa, south of the Sudd. Other Roman historians, such as Pliny, suggest that the exploration was also done in order to prepare a conquest of Ethiopia by Nero's legions. However, the death of Nero prevented further explorations of the Nile as well as a possible Roman conquest south of Roman Egypt.\nSome historians suggest that the Roman legionaries of Nero possibly reached the Murchison Falls in Uganda, but this is controversial.\nAccounts of Seneca and Pliny\nAccounts are found in Seneca the Younger's Naturales quaestiones, VI.8.3 and Pliny the Elder's Natural History, VI.XXXV, p.&nbsp;181-187:\nThe Roman legionaries navigating the Nile from southern Egypt initially reached the city of Meroe and later moved to the Sudd, where they had difficulties going further.\nSeneca wrote De Nubibus, in the book Naturales Quaestiones, that gave details about a Neronian expedition to the caput mundi investigandum (to explore the top of the world) in 61/62 AD. In this book he recorded what two legionaries told him about their discovery of the caput Nili (the origin of the Nile River): \"ibi vidimus duas petras, ex quibus ingens vis fluminis excidebat…ex magno terrarum lacu ascendere…\" (\"We saw two huge rocks, from which the power of the [Nile] river went out in a powerful way....\" [The Nile river] comes from a very huge lake of the [African] lands).\nSome modern historians, such as Giovanni Vantini and D'Ambrosio, argue that this place is the Murchison Falls in northern Uganda, meaning that the Romans may have reached equatorial Africa. The expedition from Roman Egypt reached the area of Jinja in Uganda, according to Vantini.\nThis lake, according to Vannini, could only be Lake Victoria, the largest lake in Africa. The only river that outflows from this lake is the White Nile (named the \"Victoria Nile\" when exits the lake), that in Jinja (Uganda) goes north toward the Murchison Falls.\nIndeed, the Murchison Falls is a waterfall on the Nile that breaks the Victoria Nile, which flows across northern Uganda from Lake Victoria to Lake Kyoga and then to the north end of Lake Albert in the western branch of the East African Rift. At the top of Murchison Falls, the Nile forces its way through a gap in the rocks only  wide, and tumbles , then flows westward into Lake Albert.\nThe outlet of Lake Victoria sends around 300 cubic meters per second (11,000&nbsp;ft3/s) of water over the falls, squeezed into a gorge less than  wide: these falls are similar in shape to the ones described by the legionaries.\nIndeed, Vantini wrote in the magazine Nigrizia, in 1996, that the legionaries completed a journey of exploration of more than 5,000&nbsp;km from Meroe to Uganda: a remarkable achievement done using small boats in order to bypass the Sudd, a huge swamp full of dangerous Nile crocodiles.\nHistorian David Braund wrote, in 2015, that Nero's expedition to the Nile's sources probably opened a new route toward the Indian Ocean, bypassing the dangers of piracy in the Red Sea area while allowing future Roman commerce toward India and Azania.\nConsequence of the exploration\nThe account of the expedition was certainly known – a few decades later – to the Roman merchants who resided in Egypt. Indeed, Diogene, a Roman merchant who lived between 70 and 130 AD, returning from one of his voyages, sailed along the Sinus Arabicus (the Red Sea) and, after having touched Adulis and Rhapta (near the border between Tanzania and Mozambique), he marched into the interior of the continent, up to two large lakes behind which rose the snow-capped mountains from where he thought the Nile was born. He called the snow-capped peaks of the Meru and Kilimanjaro mountains the \"Mountains of the Moon\"; Lake Victoria, Lake Eyasi and Lake Natron the \"Lakes of the Moon\"; and those territories corresponding to the current Serengeti National Park the \"Highlands of the Moon\".\nThe Romano-Phoenician Marinus of Tyre also told the story of Diogene's journey, as did Claudius Ptolemy, who attested that in the center of the African continent there were certainly those large lakes fed by the \"Mountains of the Moon\" from which the Nile emerged.\nSee also\n* Romans in sub-Saharan Africa\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Emma Buckley, Martin Dinter.
