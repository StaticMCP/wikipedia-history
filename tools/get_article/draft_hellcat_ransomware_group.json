The group targets government agencies, critical infrastructure, and corporations with highly sophisticated cyberattacks, employing double extortion tactics by encrypting systems and threatening to leak stolen data. Hellcat is known for exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities, using infostealer malware targeting Jira credentials, and employing humiliation tactics, such as demanding ransoms in unconventional forms (e.g., baguettes) to pressure victims. The group is associated with BreachForums and Anonymous Palestine.\nHistory\nHellcat was formed in mid-2024 on BreachForums, initially named \"ICA Group\" before adopting its current name to avoid confusion with another entity. The group rapidly gained notoriety by launching sophisticated attacks leveraging zero-day exploits on high-profile organizations, including Schneider Electric, The Knesset, and Jaguar Land Rover. Its ransomware payloads share similarities with the Morpheus ransomware group, suggesting possible collaboration or shared tools.\nTactics and Techniques\nHellcat employs highly sophisticated tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), as documented by cybersecurity researchers. Key methods include:\n* Initial Access: Exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in software like Jira and PAN-OS, alongside spear-phishing and infostealer malware (e.g., Raccoon, LummaStealer) to steal credentials.\n* Persistence: Deploying backdoors and modifying system settings to maintain access.\n* Data Exfiltration: Transferring stolen data via Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) or cloud services.\n* Encryption: Using ransomware payloads that leverage the Windows Cryptographic API, leaving ransom notes in system directories.\n* Humiliation Tactics: Demanding ransoms in unconventional forms to generate media attention and pressure victims.\nNotable Attacks\nHellcat has conducted several high-profile cyberattacks, including:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Victim !! Date !! Details\n|-\n| Schneider Electric || November 2024 || Exfiltrated 40GB of data, demanded $150,000, partly in baguettes.\n|-\n| The Knesset || November 2024 || Stole 64GB of sensitive data.\n|-\n| Barbados Revenue Authority || January 2025 || Breached vehicle registration database, exposing vehicle and owner data.\n|-\n| Orange Group || February 2025 || Exfiltrated 6.5GB of data from Romanian operations, including 380,000 email addresses.\n|-\n| Jaguar Land Rover || March 2025 || Breached via stolen Jira credentials, exfiltrated gigabytes of data.\n|-\n| Dell || March 2025 || Leaked employee data.\n|}\nRansom demands range from 0.5 Bitcoin (approximately $48,756) to $350,000, communicated via email and platforms like GitHub.\nMembership\nHellcat's members operate under pseudonyms, with some details identified by cybersecurity researchers:\n* Pryx (Adem): Founder, reportedly based in the United Arab Emirates, active on BreachForums and X (@holypryx). Linked to the Barbados Revenue Authority breach.\n* Rey (Saif): Based in Amman, Jordan, associated with Anonymous Palestine and the Orange Group breach.\n* Grep: Involved in attacks on Dell and CapGemini.\n* IntelBroker: Active in data breaches, including a significant breach at Los Angeles International Airport.\nCybersecurity firm KELA has shared member profiles with law enforcement in the United States, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.\nInfrastructure\nHellcat coordinates through dark web forums like BreachForums and uses encrypted communication tools, including XMPP and Tox. Their leaks site, now defunct, was accessible via Tor. The group employs anonymous VPS rentals paid with cryptocurrency.\nLaw Enforcement and Mitigation\nThe FBI is investigating Hellcat, particularly for their use of infostealers in attacks like Jaguar Land Rover. The Barbados Defence Force's Cyber Unit confirmed Pryx's involvement in the Barbados Revenue Authority breach. Recommended mitigation strategies include:\n* Deploying EDR tools to detect infostealer activity.\n* Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) on systems like Jira.\n* Adopting Zero Trust security models and maintaining offline backups.\nSee also\n* Ransomware\n* Cybercrime\n* BreachForums\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes/ransomware FBI Ransomware Guidance]"
