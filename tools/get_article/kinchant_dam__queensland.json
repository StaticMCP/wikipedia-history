In the , Kinchant Dam had a population of 183 people.\nGeography\nThe water storage facility named Lake Kinchant created by the Kinchant Dam is wholly within the locality. The dam is built on Sandy Creek to provide irrigation and town water. However most of the water in the lake does not come from Sandy Creek but is pumped from the Pioneer River at Mirani Weir into an  channel into the lake.\nMount Kinchant is in the south-west of the locality () and rises to  above sea level. Much of the mountain is within the Mount Kinchart Conservation Park.\nThe locality is  south-west of Mackay via the Bruce Highway, Peak Downs Highway, North Eton Road, Marian – Eton Road (State Route 5) and Kinchant Dam Road.\nHistory\nFrancis Charlton Kinchant (1790–1815) was killed in the Battle of Waterloo. His middle name (Charlton) was his grandmothers maiden surname. While it may not have been a well-used given name, his heroic death may have inspired another Kinchant (not necessarily a relative) to name his son “Francis Charlton”. In 1856 a man named Francis Charlton Kinchant arrived in Australia. On 18 March 1867 he married Jane Martin in Mackay, supposedly the first wedding in that town. His connection to the Mackay district is unknown but it is likely that Mount Kinchant was named for him. He died in Mackay in 1913.\nThe dam was built in 1977.\nDemographics\nIn the , Kinchant Dam had a population of 123 people.\nIn the , Kinchant Dam had a population of 183 people.\nEducation\nKinchant Dam Outdoor Education Centre is an Outdoor and Environmental Education Centre at 685 Kinchant Dam Road ().
