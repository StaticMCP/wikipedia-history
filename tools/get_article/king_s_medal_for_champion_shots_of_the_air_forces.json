One medal each can be awarded to the champion shot of annual small arms marksmanship competitions held by the Air Forces of the United Kingdom and those member countries of the British Commonwealth whose Governments desire to take part in the grant of the award.\nThe Air Forces of countries that took part at some stage include the United Kingdom's Royal Air Force, the Royal Australian Air Force, the Royal Canadian Air Force, the Royal New Zealand Air Force and the Royal Rhodesian Air Force. Today, only the United Kingdom and New Zealand still award the medal.\nOrigin\nThe Medal for the Best Shot in the British Army, Infantry, was instituted by Queen Victoria in 1869 and was awarded from 1870 to 1882 to the best shot of the annual Army shooting competition. In 1923 the medal was re-introduced by King George V and designated the King's Medal for Champion Shots in the Military Forces. It could now be awarded to the champions of Army marksmanship competitions, held under battle conditions, at annual central meetings in the United Kingdom, the British Dominions, Colonies and India.\nAll contenders for the King's/Queen's Medal for Champion Shots in the Military Forces have to be serving members of the Regular Army, Army Emergency Reserve, Territorial Army, or Local Militia and Volunteer Forces in the countries concerned. Members of independent Naval and Air Forces, while not excluded from the competition, could therefore not be awarded the medal even though they won the championship. This happened to an Air Force shot twice, in Canada in 1938 and in Rhodesia in 1962.\nInstitution\nThe '''Queen's Medal for Champion Shots of the Air Forces''' was instituted by Queen Elizabeth II on 12 June 1953. Only one medal, or a clasp only, is granted annually in each of the Air Forces of the United Kingdom and those member countries of the British Commonwealth whose governments desire to take part in the grant of the award. Apart from the United Kingdom, the Dominions of Australia, Canada and New Zealand and the Colony of Rhodesia all took part at some stage, but only the United Kingdom and New Zealand still award the medal.\nEvery medal is awarded with a clasp, inscribed with the year of award and attached to the medal's suspension bar. Holders of the medal who qualify for a subsequent award, are awarded a clasp only, to be worn on the ribbon of the original medal and attached to the original or previous clasp. When medals are not worn, the award of second or further clasps are denoted on the ribbon bar by a silver rosette to denote the award of each additional clasp.\nAward criteria\nThe medal is awarded to the champion shot of the annual championship meeting of each respective Air Force, held under service rifle championship conditions. All medal contenders have to be actual serving members of the Regular Air Forces of the respective countries.\nOrder of wear\nIn the order of wear prescribed by the British Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood, the King's Medal for Champion Shots of the Air Forces takes precedence after the King's Medal for Champion Shots in the Military Forces and before the Cadet Forces Medal.\nParticipating countries\nThe tables below list the known recipients of the medal in the respective participating countries.\nUnited Kingdom\nIn the United Kingdom, the first Royal Air Force championship to compete for the medal took place in 1953 and was won by Senior Technician J.E.P.P. Witts of RAF Stafford. The championship took place annually since then, except in 1991 when no competition was held as a result of the Gulf War. The record for the most wins of the Air Force medal is held by Chief Technician J.T. Prictor, who won the championship for the fourteenth time in 2009.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible\" \"\n!scope=\"row\";|Year\n!scope=\"row\";|Rank\n!scope=\"row\";|Initials\n!scope=\"row\";|Surname\n!scope=\"row\";|Squadron or Formation\n|-\n|1953\n|SAC (T)\n|J.E.P.P.\n|Witts\n|RAF Stafford\n|-\n|1954\n|Sgt\n|C.H.\n|Greenlee\n|RAF Ballykelly\n|-\n|1955\n|Cpl Tech\n|B.R.\n|Creasey\n|RAF Wahn\n|-\n|1956\n|Sqn Ldr\n|C.C.\n|Willott OBE\n|RAF West Malling\n|-\n|1957\n|Flt Lt\n|M.\n|Gill\n|RAF Little Rissington\n|-\n|1958\n|Wg Cdr\n|P.E.H.\n|Thomas AFC\n|RAF Hornchurch\n|-\n|1959\n|Wg Cdr\n|P.E.H.\n|Thomas AFC (2)\n|RAF Hornchurch\n|-\n|1960\n|Sqn Ldr\n|D.H.\n|Young\n|RAF Hemswell\n|-\n|1961\n|WO\n|F.\n|Flanaghan\n|RAF Chigwell\n|-\n|1962\n|Chf Tech\n|B.R.\n|Creasey (2)\n|RAF West Raynham\n|-\n|1963\n|SAC (T)\n|D.J.\n|Limby\n|RAF Geilenkirchen\n|-\n|1964\n|Flt Lt\n|R.S.\n|Hassell\n|RAF Lindholme\n|-\n|1965\n|Cpl\n|R.N.\n|van Gelderen\n|RAF Gaydon\n|-\n|1966\n|Cpl\n|R.N.\n|van Gelderen (2)\n|RAF Gaydon\n|-\n|1967\n|Chf Tech\n|H.J.\n|Dillon-Lee\n|RAF Wattisham\n|-\n|1968\n|Sgt\n|R.N.\n|van Gelderen (3)\n|RAF Gaydon\n|-\n|1969\n|Sgt\n|R.N.\n|van Gelderen (4)\n|RAF Gaydon\n|-\n|1970\n|Sgt\n|R.N.\n|van Gelderen (5)\n|RAF Gaydon\n|-\n|1971\n|Sgt\n|R.N.\n|van Gelderen (6)\n|RAF Gaydon\n|-\n|1972\n|Sgt\n|R.N.\n|van Gelderen (7)\n|RAF Gaydon\n|-\n|1973\n|Flt Lt\n|G.\n|Cox\n|\n|-\n|1974\n|Chf Tech\n|D.D.\n|Watt\n|RAF Honington\n|-\n|1975\n|Sgt\n|P.A.\n|Moss\n|RAF Sealand\n|-\n|1976\n|Sgt\n|P.A.\n|Moss (2)\n|RAF Sealand\n|-\n|1977\n|Sgt\n|P.A.\n|Moss (3)\n|RAF Sealand\n|-\n|1978\n|Sgt\n|P.A.\n|Moss (4)\n|RAF Sealand\n|-\n|1979\n|Chf Tech\n|A.A.\n|Thompson\n|\n|-\n|1980\n|MAE\n|I.\n|Wilkinson\n|RAF Lyneham\n|-\n|1981\n|Cpl\n|P.W.\n|Raymond\n|RAF Abingdon\n|-\n|1982\n|Cpl\n|J.A.\n|Wyles\n|\n|-\n|1983\n|Flt Lt\n|D.P.\n|Calvert\n|\n|-\n|1984\n|Cpl\n|J.T.\n|Prictor\n|RAF Honington\n|-\n|1985\n|Cpl\n|P.W.\n|Raymond (2)\n|RAF Abingdon\n|-\n|1986\n|Cpl\n|J.T.\n|Prictor (2)\n|RAF Honington\n|-\n|1987\n|Cpl\n|I.L.\n|Vosper\n|RAF Cottesmore\n|-\n|1988\n|Cpl\n|J.T.\n|Prictor (3)\n|RAF Bruggen\n|-\n|1989\n|SAC\n|I.D.E.\n|Brown\n|RAF Catterick\n|-\n|1990\n|Sgt\n|J.T.\n|Prictor (4)\n|No. 9 Squadron RAF, RAF Bruggen\n|-\n|1992\n|FS\n|M.W.\n|Silver BEM\n|No. 19 Squadron RAF, RAF Aldergrove\n|-\n|1993\n|Sgt\n|P.\n|Barry\n|RAF Valley\n|-\n|1994\n|Sgt\n|D.B.\n|Vick\n|RAF Honington\n|-\n|1995\n|Sgt\n|J.T.\n|Prictor (5)\n|No. 9 Squadron RAF, RAF Bruggen\n|-\n|1996\n|Flt Lt\n|L.F.\n|Smith\n|No. 72 Squadron RAF, RAF Aldergrove\n|-\n|1997\n|Sgt\n|J.T.\n|Prictor (6)\n|No. 9 Squadron RAF, RAF Bruggen\n|-\n|1998\n|Flt Lt\n|L.F.\n|Smith (2)\n|Engineering Wing, RAF Coningsby\n|-\n|1999\n|Sgt\n|J.T.\n|Prictor (7)\n|RAF Kinloss\n|-\n|2000\n|Chf Tech\n|J.T.\n|Prictor (8)\n|MOD London, RAF Uxbridge\n|-\n|2001\n|Chf Tech\n|J.T.\n|Prictor (9)\n|MOD London, RAF Uxbridge\n|-\n|2002\n|Chf Tech\n|J.T.\n|Prictor (10)\n|RAF Cottesmore\n|-\n|2003\n|Chf Tech\n|J.T.\n|Prictor (11)\n|RAF Cottesmore\n|-\n|2004\n|Flt Lt\n|C.\n|Allen\n|RAF Wittering\n|-\n|2005\n|Sqn Ldr\n|L.F.\n|Smith (3)\n|5001 Squadron, RAF Stafford\n|-\n|2006\n|Chf Tech\n|J.T.\n|Prictor (12)\n|5131 (BD) Squadron, RAF Wittering\n|-\n|2007\n|Chf Tech\n|J.T.\n|Prictor (13)\n|5131 (BD) Squadron, RAF Wittering\n|-\n|2008\n|Flt Lt\n|D.B.\n|Vick (2)\n|RAF Honington\n|-\n|2009\n|Chf Tech\n|J.T.\n|Prictor (14)\n|5131 (BD) Squadron, RAF Wittering\n|-\n|2010\n|Sqn Ldr\n|L.F.\n|Smith (4)\n|HQ Air Command, RAF Halton\n|-\n|2011\n|Sqn Ldr\n|D.B.\n|Vick (3)\n|RAF Regiment, RAF Honington\n|-\n|2012\n|Sgt\n|P.\n|Hunter\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|Cpl\n|R.\n|Jamieson\n|RAF Regiment\n|-\n|2014\n|Cpl\n|R.\n|Jamieson (2)\n|RAF Regiment\n|-\n|2015\n|Cpl\n|R.\n|Jamieson (3)\n|RAF Regiment\n|-\n|2016\n|Sgt\n|A.\n|Lilley\n|RAF Waddington\n|-\n|2017\n|Cpl\n|M.\n|Keightley\n|RAF Northolt\n|-\n|2018\n|Sgt\n|A.\n|Lilley (2)\n|RAF Waddington\n|-\n|2019\n|FS\n|P.A.D.\n|Guard\n|RAF Odiham\n|-\n|2022\n|Cpl\n|N.\n|Webb\n|RAF Stafford\n|-\n|2023\n|Cpl\n|K.\n|Mitchell\n|RAF Northolt\n|-\n|2024\n|Cpl\n|N.\n|Webb (2)\n|RAF Lossiemouth\n|-\n|2025\n|WO\n|A.\n|Lilley (3)\n|RAF Waddington\n|-\n|}\nAustralia\nThe first Royal Australian Air Force championship to compete for the medal took place in 1956 and the first medal to an Australian was won by Warrant Officer C.E.P.

Gilpin of Thornhill Air Base, a member of the Royal Rhodesian Air Force. Despite protests from the Army commanders, the Minister of Defence presented Gilpin with the Army medal. As a result of the controversy, Rhodesia sought and was granted the Crown's permission to introduce the Queen's Medal for Champion Shots of the Air Forces. The first Royal Rhodesian Air Force championship to compete for the Air Force medal took place in 1963, but the first medal award was backdated to 1962 and the first two medals were presented in December 1963, one to Gilpin and the other to the Air Force champion for 1963, Flight Lieutenant W.J. Geeringh. Gilpin's 1962 Army medal was returned and the 1962 Army runner-up, Inspector D. Hollingworth, was awarded a second clasp to his existing medal.\nThe championship took place annually from then until 1968, even after Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence on 11 November 1965, until Rhodesia severed its ties with the British Crown on 2 March 1970 and, in that same year, instituted the President's Medal for Shooting of the Security Forces.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible\" \"\n!scope=\"row\";|Year\n!scope=\"row\";|Rank\n!scope=\"row\";|Initials\n!scope=\"row\";|Surname\n!scope=\"row\";|Squadron or Formation\n|-\n|1962\n|Cpl Tech\n|B.T.\n|Gilpin\n|Thornhill Air Base\n|-\n|1963\n|Flt Lt\n|W.J.\n|Geeringh\n|RRAF\n|-\n|1966\n|Cpl\n|G.\n|Dartnell\n|Thornhill Air Base\n|-\n|1968\n|Flt Lt\n|W.J.\n|Geeringh (3)\n|RRAF\n|-\n|}\nDescription\nThe medal was struck in silver and is a disk,  in diameter, with a raised rim on each side and suspended from a straight silver bar.\n;Obverse\nThe obverse bears the effigy of Queen Elizabeth II and is circumscribed \"ELIZABETH II DEI GRATIA REGINA F. D.\", reading around from the top. The effigy was designed by sculptor Cecil Thomas OBE and was used on a number of medals.\n;Reverse\nThe reverse shows Hermes, the mythological messenger of the gods, mounted on the back of a hawk in flight, with a javelin in his right hand and in his left a caduceus, two snakes wrapped around a winged staff. The image is circumscribed “THE QUEEN'S MEDAL FOR CHAMPION SHOTS OF THE AIR FORCES”. The reverse of the medal was designed by British sculptor Sir Bernard Sindall.\n;Clasp\nSince the medal can be won multiple times, each subsequent award is indicated by the award of another clasp, which displays the year of the subsequent award. The clasps are designed to be attached to the suspender and to each other with rivets, in roller chain fashion. When medals are not worn, the award of second and subsequent clasps are denoted by silver rosettes on the ribbon bar. Since it is impossible to sew more than four rosettes onto a single ribbon bar and since several champions have won the award more than five times, gold rosettes were introduced to provide for situations where more than five championships have been won.\n;Ribbon\nThe ribbon is 32 millimetres wide and dark crimson with a 3 millimetres wide dark blue band, a 3 millimetres wide light blue band and a 3 millimetres wide dark blue band on each edge.\nReferences"
