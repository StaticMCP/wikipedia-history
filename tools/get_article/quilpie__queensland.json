In the , the locality of Quilpie had a population of 530 people.\nThe town is the administrative centre of the Quilpie Shire local government area. The town of Toompine is also within the locality.\nThe economy of the area is based on the grazing and mining industries. The area has one of the largest deposits of boulder opal in the world, and also has extensive deposits of gas and oil.\nGeography\nQuilpie is in Channel Country on the banks of the Bulloo River. It is on the Diamantina Developmental Road,   west of Charleville,  west of Toowoomba and  west of the state capital, Brisbane. Quilpie is the administrative centre of the Quilpie Shire.\nThe town of Quilpie is in the north of the locality, while the smaller town of Toompine () is in the south of the locality.\nQuilpie has quite a few trees but sometimes drought takes over and the landscape can become dry and desolate.\nHistory\nQuilpie is believed to lie on the border of the Bunthamurra and Margany Indigenous Australian tribal areas.\nMargany (also known as Marganj, Mardigan, Marukanji, Maranganji) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Margany people. The Margany language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Quilpie Shire, taking in Quilpie, Cheepie and Beechal extending towards Eulo and Thargomindah, as well as the properties of Dynevor Downs and Ardoch.\nThe township of Toompine was surveyed in 1870. The name Toompine is an Indigenous language word meaning leech.\nGoombie State School opened on Goombie Station (north of the town of Quilpie at ) on 27 January 1875 and closed on 9 December 1977.\nToompine Provisional School and Duck Creek Provisional School both opened in 1900. In 1901, they became half-time schools (meaning they shared a single teacher between the two schools). Toompine Provisional School closed in July 1902, enabling Duck Creek Provisional School to revert to full-time status. Due to low student numbers, Duck Creek Provisional School closed in 1905.\nQuilpie was gazetted as a town in 1917 owing to the Western railway line that was laid down from Brisbane. It takes its name from the Indigenous Australian word for stone curlew, quilpeta. The name was proposed by pastoralist James Hammond of Tenham Station. The Queensland Railways Department mistakenly named the railway station Quillpill. The town and station name were standardised to Quilpie on 16 June 1917 by the Governor in Council.\nQuilpie State School opened on 10 September 1918. The school began offering secondary education in 1966. On 5 December 2008, it was renamed Quilpie State College.\nThe first post office was opened in 1921. Two years later the telephone reached Quilpie .\nA fire destroyed a block of the main street in 1926. With no town water the residents watched helplessly.\nIn 1927, the first court house was established.\nPrior to 1930, Quilpie was within the Shire of Adavale, headquartered at Adavale. However, the decision to route the railway line through Quilpie rather than Adavale had led to a population drift away from Adavale making Quilpie the larger town. On 17 July 1930, there was a re-organisation of local government in the district, resulting in the abolition of the Shire of Adavale and the creation of the Shire of Quilpie with Quilpie as its headquarters.\nSt Finbarr's Catholic Church was officially opened and dedicated on Sunday 14 December 1930 by the Bishop of Toowoomba, James Byrne. It was built from timber. In 1972, it was replaced with a brick church designed by W. Durack.\nA bore was sunk into the Great Artesian Basin in 1933. It provided drinking water for the town and between 1952 and 1963 the hot water was used to generate electricity for the town.\nOn 15 October 1936, St Matthew's Anglican Church was officially opened and dedicated by Bishop Dixon. It was built from timber and could seat 100 people. The church bell was donated by the people of Cunnamulla.\nSt Finbarr's Catholic School opened in early 1950, shortly after the arrival in January 1950 of three Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart, Sisters Macrina, Carmel and Magdalen. By the end of 1950, over 60 children were enrolled. A boarding school for boys and girls was opened in 1951. The first lay teacher, Michael West, was appointed in 1983. When the boarding facility closed in 2008, it was the last rural Catholic primary boarding school in Queensland. In 2009, the first lay principal, Aaron Wells, was appointed and the administration of the school passed from the Sisters to the Catholic Education Office of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Toowoomba who operate the school in the Mary MacKillop tradition (MacKillop being the founder of the Sisters of St Joseph).\nFrom 1954 to 1994, The Westlander was split at Charleville. the Quilpie Section (3Q02) was known as the \"Flying Flea\" and it consisted of two passenger carriages, a guards van and power van. Both 3Q02 and 3V02 were withdrawn in 1994 and replaced by TrainLink bus services.\nThe current Quilpie Public Library building opened in 2005.\nDemographics\nIn the , the town of Quilpie had a population of 645 people.
