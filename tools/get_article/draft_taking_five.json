The film stars Alona Tal, Daniella Monet, Christy Carlson Romano, Bart Johnson, Marcus T. Paulk and The Click Five.\nBackground and production\nThe storyline for Taking Five caught the attention of producers Kat Hantas and Chesley Seals. Hantas recalled, \"This was not your typical tween movie where the new kid at the school tries to fit in.\" Reminiscent of Beatlemania, it asks the question, \"What would you do if you had your favorite band in your house for a weekend?.\" Once casting began, they wanted to find musicians who could act as it was essential that \"the band feel authentic,\" according to director Andrew Waller.\nDirected by Andrew Waller, the film was shot in Salt Lake City and at Juan Diego Catholic High School in Draper, Utah and Hillcrest High School in Midvale, Utah. Speaking about how the movie came together, bassist Ethan Mentzer stated, \"The idea was sort of proposed to us, and was tossed around for a long time before it became a reality. It was one of those things where it was like, we'll believe that we're going to do it when we're doing it. And then one day we ended up in Salt Lake City filming.\" It was shot in 2006, where filming ended in November.\nPlot\nCast\n* Alona Tal as Devon Thompson\n* Daniella Monet as Gabby Davis\n* Christy Carlson Romano as Danielle Thompson\n* Bart Johnson as Mark Thompson\n* Marcus T.

The movie was released in theaters on September 9, 2007, and was released to DVD on September 9, 2008.\nCritical reception\nJoly Herman of Common Sense Media gave the film two stars out of five, writing \"Tween movies can be so much better than this sorry attempt. Sure it has some eye candy – like cute girls who drool over their favorite boy band and the handsome boy band playing as a favor at a high school. The members of Click Five play the pop band 5 Leo Rise, and as novice actors, they seem to waver between being jaded and being playful... There are no deep moments here or surprises – just some stagy scenes where the actors try to pull off the lukewarm script. Kind of like a sugar high that drops as quickly as it came on.\"\nReflecting on the movie, Mentzer said \"It was a fun thing to do, [but] I don't know that we're necessarily banking on that movie to be a big career thing.\" Similarly, keyboardist Ben Romans stated they \"had no business being in a movie.\" However, Romans noted that he and the band \"enjoyed the experience. But I think that we probably should be making records.\"\nMusic\nTaking Five features the song \"Kidnap My Heart\" performed by the Click Five, \"Postcard from Hollywood\" by Eric Dill and \"Friday Night\" (originally by the Click Five from Greetings From Imrie House) by Christy Carlson Romano.\nReferences"
