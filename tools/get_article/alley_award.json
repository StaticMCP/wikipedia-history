Officially organized under the aegis of the Academy of Comic Book Arts and Sciences, the award shared close ties with the fanzine Alter Ego magazine. The Alley is the first known comic book fan award.\nThe Alley Awards were tallied for comic books produced during the previous year. The Alley statuette — a likeness of the comic strip character Alley Oop — was initially sculpted by Academy member Ron Foss out of redwood, from which \"plaster duplications\" were made to be handed out to the various winners.\nHistory\nThe Alley Award traces its origin to \"a letter to Jerry dated October 25, 1961\" by Roy Thomas, in which he suggested that Jerry Bails' fanzine Alter-Ego, which had debuted in March 1961, create an award for fandom's \"favorite comic books in a number of categories\".\nInitially suggested as the \"Alter-Ego Award\", the name evolved into the Alley Award after comic strip caveman Alley Oop, since, as Thomas reasoned, \"surely a caveman had to be the earliest superhero chronologically\". Comics historian Bill Schelly notes that no one \"bothered to ask the NEA [newspaper] syndicate for permission to utilize V. T. Hamlin's comic strip character\".\nBy the awards' third year, the number of ballots received had become so overwhelming that Bails called for a fan get-together at which votes could be tabulated by group effort. This gathering of Midwestern fans, held in March 1964 at the Detroit-area home of Bails, was dubbed the \"Alley Tally\", and its success provided inspiration for the organizing of comic book fan conventions that began soon afterward.\nResults of the voting were published in the comics fanzines On the Drawing Board / The Comic Reader  The Alley Awards themselves were given out from 1962 to 1970 (for comics published 1961–1969, respectively), with comic strip awards added in 1967 (for calendar year 1966). The awards were presented at all three Academy Cons from 1965 to 1967. The final three years' awards were presented at Phil Seuling's New York Comic Art Convention.\nAfter the dissolution of the Alleys, from 1971 to 1974 the Comic Art Convention presented the Goethe Awards/Comic Fan Art Awards.\nWinners\n1961\nSource\n*Best Regularly Published Comic Book - Justice League of America &nbsp;(DC Comics)\n*Best Adventure Hero(ine) Having Own Comic Book - Green Lantern &nbsp;(DC Comics)\n*Best Adventure Hero(ine) Not Having Own Comic Book - Hawkman &nbsp;(DC Comics)\n*Best Supporting Character - Elongated Man &nbsp;(DC Comics)\n*Best Cover - The Flash #123, \"Flash of Two Worlds\" &nbsp;(DC Comics)\n*Best Single Issue - The Flash #123, \"Flash of Two Worlds\" [by Gardner Fox & Carmine Infantino] &nbsp;(DC Comics)\n*Best Artist (Pencil or Ink) - Carmine Infantino\n*Best Story - The Flash #123, \"Flash of Two Worlds\" &nbsp;(DC Comics)\n*Best Adventure-Hero Group - Justice League of America &nbsp;(DC Comics)\n*Hero or Heroine Most Worthy of Revival - The Spectre &nbsp;(DC Comics)\n*Worst Comic Book Currently Published - Wonder Woman &nbsp;(DC Comics)\n1962\n*Best Comic Book of the Year - Fantastic Four &nbsp;(Marvel Comics)\n*Best Editor of a Comics Group - Julius Schwartz &nbsp;(DC Comics)\n*Best Script Writer - Gardner Fox\n*Best Pencil Artist - Carmine Infantino\n*Best Inker - Murphy Anderson\n*Best Hero - Hawkman &nbsp;(DC Comics)\n*Best Group of Heroes - Fantastic Four &nbsp;(Marvel Comics)\n*Best Villain - Sub-Mariner (Fantastic Four) &nbsp;(Marvel Comics)\n*Best Supporting Character - The Thing (Fantastic Four) &nbsp;(Marvel Comics)\n*Best Short Story - \"Origin of Spider-Man\" by Stan Lee & Steve Ditko, Amazing Fantasy #15 &nbsp;(Marvel Comics)\n*Best Book-Length Story - \"The Planet that Came to a Standstill\", by Gardner Fox & Carmine Infantino, Mystery in Space #75 &nbsp;(DC Comics)\n*Best Single Comic Book Cover - The Brave and the Bold #42, by Joe Kubert &nbsp;(DC Comics)\n*Comic Most in Need of Improvement - Batman &nbsp;(DC Comics)\n*Hero/Heroine Most Worthy of Revival - The Spectre &nbsp;(DC Comics)\n\"Ama\" (Fan) Division\n*Comic Fanzines of 1961/62 - Alter-Ego, edited by Jerry Bails & Roy Thomas\n*Special Projects - Index to All Star Comics, by Jerry Bails\n*Articles - \"The Light of Green Lantern\", by Jerry Bails\n*Features - \"Profiles on Collectors\", by Biljo White\n*Strip - \"Bestest League of America\", by Roy Thomas\n*Fiction - \"The Reincarnation of The Spectre\", by Roy Thomas\n1963\nSource\nPro Categories\n*Best Editor - Stan Lee &nbsp;(Marvel Comics)\n*Best Writer - Stan Lee\n*Best Artist - Carmine Infantino\nBest Comics Categories\n*Adventure Hero - The Amazing Spider-Man &nbsp;(Marvel Comics)\n*General Fantasy - Strange Adventures &nbsp;(DC Comics)\n*Mundane Fiction - Sgt.
