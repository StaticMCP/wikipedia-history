His claims were largely unsuccessful, however, as Pizarro was succeeded as governor by Cristóbal Vaca de Castro, despite claims from his brother Gonzalo Pizarro, whose claims to join arms against the Almagristas and \"El Mozo\" largely remained unanswered.\nBattle\nDesperate not to face the same fate as his father after the battle of Las Salinas, Diego de Almagro II gathered an army of supporters.  Vaca de Castro met and defeated de Almagro's army outside Huamanga (Ayacucho) at Chupas, on 16 September 1542, the year following Pizarro's murder.  1200 Spaniards fought in the battle.  Vaca de Castro's forces killed 200 Almagristas, and hanged many more later that day. De Almagro fled to Cuzco and tried to seek refuge at Manco Inca's residence in Vitcos. But he was caught on September 16, 1542 and was executed on the city plaza of Cuzco after a brief trial.\nReferences"
