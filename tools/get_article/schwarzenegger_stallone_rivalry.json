Stallone later spoke out in an interview with Variety, saying that Schwarzenegger laughed at him when Rocky lost in several categories. Finally, when Rocky won Best Motion Picture – Drama, Stallone threw a bowl of flowers at Schwarzenegger.\nPopularity\nThe rival actors attacked each other in the press, and they often tried to surpass the other with more on-screen killings and larger weapons. In an October 1985 interview with The News of the World, Schwarzenegger apparently insulted Stallone (who was considered a much bigger star at the time) by alleging that Stallone uses body doubles in a few of his films, and that one \"would be angry at hearing their name in the same breath\" as the Rocky actor.\nIn November 1985, Rocky IV, starring Stallone, opened with a $20 million weekend, with Rocky's rival, Ivan Drago, a muscular villain with a strange accent perceived to be a facsimile of Schwarzenegger.\nIn February 1988, The News of the World ran a story by journalist Wendy Leigh with the headline: \"Hollywood Star's Nazi Secret.\" The article claims Schwarzenegger is a closet Hitler-lover with \"fervent Nazi and anti-Semitic views.\" His father, Gustav, the article alleges, was responsible for rounding up Jews to put them in concentration camps. Leigh's source was claimed to be Stallone. While Schwarzenegger's father did indeed voluntarily apply to join the Austrian National Socialist Party on 1 March 1938 and held allegiance to Nazi Germany during World War II, there is no evidence to support Gustav rounding up Jews or directly participating in war crimes. Gustav Schwarzenegger's Nazi links were revealed in 1990, two years after the accusation; however, Arnold, who was born two years after the fall of the regime, has always fervently denounced them. Wendy Leigh later claimed her source for the story, Stallone, also paid for her legal fees when Schwarzenegger sued for libel; the newspaper apologized late in 1989 and agreed to pay damages.\nIn September 1988, the New York Post reported that Stallone and his entourage entered a nightclub, saw a picture of Schwarzenegger on the wall, and demanded its removal, or else Stallone would leave. The owner handed the picture of Schwarzenegger over to Stallone's minders, who then destroyed it.\nIn March 1990, Stallone read an unauthorized biography by the aforementioned Wendy Leigh about Schwarzenegger's Nazi family, difficult childhood, and use of steroids in his teens. Stallone, according to Leigh, was so pleased after reading the first draft that he remarked \"Reading this is better than getting four blow jobs\". Schwarzenegger has subsequently admitted to taking steroids while bodybuilding, and he also mentioned his father was indeed an abusive alcoholic.\nMentions in film\nIn Twins, Schwarzenegger's character makes fun of a Rambo poster that he sees on the wall, implying with a hand gesture that he had bigger muscles than Stallone's depiction of Rambo. Stallone responded in the movie Tango & Cash, in which he beat up a man who looked like Schwarzenegger. Stallone later admitted that he imagined Schwarzenegger while shooting the scene. In Last Action Hero, a Terminator 2 poster was shown with Stallone's face, and Schwarzenegger's character compliments his performance in a tongue-in-cheek manner. In Demolition Man (1993), Stallone’s John Spartan wakes up in the future to find that Arnold Schwarzenegger has a Presidential Library, due to a Constitutional amendment that allowed citizens born outside the United States to run for office.\nIn an interview with Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show, Stallone stated that Schwarzenegger once tricked him into doing the critically reviled 1992 film Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot.  Schwarzenegger later admitted to this in an interview with Jimmy Kimmel on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, saying:\nDemise and legacy\nThe rivalry ended in the late 1990s when both actors' impact on the box office had reduced significantly. At the turn of the millennium, The Hollywood Reporter said that the pair were ideating a joint acting venture. Schwarzenegger also invited Stallone for multiple inaugurations during his time as the Governor of California; as a gesture of goodwill, Stallone had donated $15,000 to Schwarzenegger's re-election campaign in 2005. The pair also starred in four movies together: The  Expendables, The Expendables 2, The Expendables 3, and Escape Plan. Additionally, Schwarzenegger also had an uncredited cameo appearance in The Expendables.\nIn the 2023 Netflix documentary series Arnold, which chronicles the life and career of Schwarzenegger, Stallone reflects on their long-running rivalry, acknowledging that Schwarzenegger ultimately surpassed him in box-office success and cultural prominence, stating:\n:\"He wanted to be number one. Unfortunately, he got there.\"\nSee also\n*Vulgar auteurism – several of their films are in this article\n*Blockbuster cinema\n*Indiewood – several of their films are also in this article\n*Ben Affleck and Matt Damon\nReferences"
