      "text": "# Edward Ward (businessman)\n\nEdward Ward (1770s?December 22, 1837) was a businessman and politician of the United States. Originally from Virginia,  Ward was land owner and Tennessee state legislator. Ward bought Andrew Jackson's second plantation, the 640-acre Hunter's Hill, from him for $10,000 in 1804. Ward served as president of the Clover Bottom Jockey Club, reportedly won $500 in gold off Andrew Jackson in a bet on a fight between gaffed cocks, and along with Jackson was involved in land speculations in the vicinity of Huntsville, and Florence, Alabama. In 1809, Ward bought  of land in western Madison County, Alabama for over .\nWard served three terms in the Tennessee legislature. In the wake of the Panic of 1819, Jackson and Ward opposed an act for the relief of debtors, and \"addressed a memorial of protest to the assembly which that body refused to accept on the ground that its language was disrespectful to the lawmakers. The memorial did, in fact, charge the members who voted for the loan office act with perjury since they had taken an oath to support the Constitution of the United States, and now assented to a law which made something beside gold and silver a tender in payment of debts.\"\nHe ran for governor but lost the 1821 Tennessee gubernatorial election to William Carroll. Ward was brutally murdered in 1837 by four of his nephews. An account of the murder was included in American Slavery As It Is (1839) as an instance of depraved violence that the editors sought to associate with slave ownership.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*  |editor-last2=MacPherson |editor-first2=Sharon}}&nbsp;"
