The station is located in the Kentron district and exits at Nalbandyan and Aram Streets and Main Avenue. Nearby are Republic Square, the first and third buildings of the Government of Armenia, handicraft fair Vernissage, and the National History Museum of Armenia.\nThe station is named after Republic Square. Until 1992, it was called Lenin Square.\nStation design\nThe station is characterized by a unique design, unparalleled in Soviet or international metro construction. The main architectural element is the pylons, noticeably tapered in width and of considerable depth. This configuration creates the illusion of an arched column, especially when viewed from the central part of the station. However, unlike traditional column-based stations, the design is based on a pylon layout, where the visual effect of arching is achieved through the specific geometry of the supporting elements.\nThe station was designed by architects Jim Torosyan and Mkrtich Minasyan. Their project was awarded the State Prize of the Armenian SSR in 1983. The main constructor of the station is Henzel Hakobyan, the project was constructed by Arbak Hovhannisyan.\nGallery\nHanrapetEntrance.JPG| Main entrance of the station\nRepublic Square Metro Station Fountains in Yerevan 2019-06-20v2.jpg| Fountains of the station\nRepublic Square station of Yerevan metro from air topmost view, retouched.jpg|Station's view from the air\nReferences"
