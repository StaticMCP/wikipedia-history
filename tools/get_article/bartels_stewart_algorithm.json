Bartels and G.W. Stewart in 1971, it was the first numerically stable method that could be systematically applied to solve such equations. The algorithm works by using the real Schur decompositions of A and B to transform  AX - XB = C into a triangular system that can then be solved using forward or backward substitution. In 1979, G. Golub, C. Van Loan and S. Nash introduced an improved version of the algorithm, known as the Hessenberg–Schur algorithm. It remains a standard approach for solving  Sylvester equations when X is of small to moderate size.\nThe algorithm\nLet X, C \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}, and assume that the eigenvalues of A are distinct from the eigenvalues of B. Then, the matrix equation  AX - XB = C has a unique solution. The Bartels–Stewart algorithm computes X by applying the following steps:\n1.Compute the real Schur decompositions\n: R = U^TAU,\n: S = V^TB^TV.\nThe matrices R and S are block-upper triangular matrices, with diagonal blocks of size 1 \\times 1 or 2 \\times 2.\n2. Set F = U^TCV.\n3. Solve the  simplified system RY - YS^T = F, where Y = U^TXV. This can be done using forward substitution on the blocks. Specifically, if s_{k-1, k} = 0, then\n: (R - s_{kk}I)y_k = f_{k} + \\sum_{j = k+1}^n s_{kj}y_j,\nwhere y_k is the kth column of Y. When s_{k-1, k} \\neq 0, columns [ y_{k-1} \\mid y_{k}]  should be concatenated and solved for simultaneously.\n4. Set X = UYV^T.\nComputational cost\nUsing the QR algorithm, the  real Schur decompositions in step 1 require approximately 10(m^3 + n^3) flops, so that the overall computational cost is  10(m^3 + n^3) + 2.5(mn^2 + nm^2).\nSimplifications and special cases\nIn the special case where B=-A^T and C is symmetric, the solution X will also be symmetric. This symmetry can be exploited so that Y is found more efficiently in step 3 of the algorithm.\nThe Hessenberg–Schur algorithm\nThe Hessenberg–Schur algorithm replaces the decomposition R = U^TAU in step 1 with the decomposition H = Q^TAQ, where H is an  upper-Hessenberg matrix. This leads to a system of the form  HY - YS^T = F that can be solved using forward substitution. The advantage of this approach is that H = Q^TAQ can be found using  Householder reflections at a cost of (5/3)m^3 flops, compared to the 10m^3 flops required to compute the real Schur decomposition of A.\nSoftware and implementation\nThe subroutines required for the Hessenberg-Schur variant of the Bartels–Stewart  algorithm are implemented in the SLICOT library. These are used in the MATLAB control system toolbox.\nAlternative approaches\nFor large systems, the \\mathcal{O}(m^3 + n^3) cost of the Bartels–Stewart algorithm can be prohibitive. When A and B are sparse or structured, so that linear solves and matrix vector multiplies involving them are efficient, iterative algorithms can potentially perform better. These include projection-based methods, which use Krylov subspace iterations, methods based on the alternating direction implicit (ADI) iteration, and hybridizations that involve both projection and ADI.  Iterative methods can also be used to directly construct low rank approximations to X when solving AX-XB = C.\nReferences"
