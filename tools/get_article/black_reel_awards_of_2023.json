During the ceremony, FAAAF presented the Black Reel Awards in 24 categories. The film nominations were announced on December 15, 2022.\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever and The Woman King led the film nominations with fourteen each, with the latter winning a total of six awards, the most wins by any film, including Outstanding Film.\nWith her third win for Outstanding Costume Design for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Ruth E. Carter became the most awarded technical award winner in Black Reel Awards history. Actress Angela Bassett became the first woman to win an acting and honorary award in the same year; she won for her work in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and also received the Sidney Poitier Trailblazer Award, recognizing her career of acting excellence.\nThe 7th Annual Black Reel Awards for Television nominations were announced on June 15, 2023; the performance categories were merged into gender neutral ones while five technical categories were added. The miniseries The Best Man: The Final Chapters received 18 nominations, becoming the most nominated program in a single year in the history of the awards. The ceremony was initially scheduled for August 14, 2023, but due to the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes, the ceremony was delayed and rescheduled for January 16, 2024, combining both the film and television ceremonies.\nRepresentatives for the Foundation for the Augmentation of African-Americans in Film (FAAAF) explained that temporarily rescheduling the television awards \"gives the opportunity for the resolution of the strikes to occur and allow for the presence and participation of all the honorees\".\n\"The best part about recognizing excellence in anything is giving those who have done the work the opportunity to shine,\" stated Tim Gordon, the Black Reel Awards' founder and executive director. \"We felt announcing the winners on our site or in a press release would not appropriately honor the fantastic work of those in our entertainment community,\" he concluded.\nFilm winners and nominees\n{| class=wikitable width=\"100%\"\n! width=\"50%\"| Outstanding Film\n! width=\"50%\"| Outstanding Director\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|\n* 'The Woman King – Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Cathy Schulman and Julius Tennon, producers'\n** Black Panther: Wakanda Forever – Kevin Feige and Nate Moore, producers\n** Devotion – Molly Smith, Rachel Smith, Thad Luckinbill and Trent Luckinbill, producers\n** Nope – Jordan Peele and Ian Cooper, producers\n** Till – Keith Beauchamp, Barbara Broccoli, Whoopi Goldberg, Michael Reilly and Thomas Levine, producers\n| valign=\"top\"|\n* 'Gina Prince-Bythewood – The Woman King'\n** Elegance Bratton – The Inspection\n** Chinonye Chukwu – Till\n** Ryan Coogler – Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\n** Jordan Peele – Nope\n|-\n! width=\"50%\"| Outstanding Actor\n! width=\"50%\"| Outstanding Actress\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|\n* 'Jeremy Pope – The Inspection as Ellis French'\n** John Boyega – Breaking as Lance Corporal Brian Brown-Easley\n** Sterling K.
