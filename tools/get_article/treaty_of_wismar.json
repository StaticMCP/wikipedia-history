The accord was negotiated for Sweden by Lord High Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna, Count of Södermöre who was regent for Christina, Queen of Sweden. The signatories agreed to unite forces against the Habsburgs, with France attacking on the left bank of the Rhine River and Sweden fighting in Silesia and Bohemia. The Treaty of Wismar was eventually ratified in 1638 by the Treaty of Hamburg.\nSee also\n*List of treaties\nReferences\nRelated reading\n*Parker, Geoffrey; Adams, Simon (1997)  ''The Thirty Years' War (Routledge. 2 ed.)\n*Tryntje Helfferich, translator (2009) The Thirty Years War: A Documentary History''\t(Hackett Publishing Company, Inc.)\nExternal links\n*[http://www.uni-mannheim.de/mateo/camenaref/cmh/cmh413.html The Later Years of the Thirty Years' War (1635-1648) - Chapter XIII]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071010051258/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=218412 Count Axel Gustafsson of Oxenstierna]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070116005940/http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/swedhis/swed1630.htm Chronology of Sweden]"
