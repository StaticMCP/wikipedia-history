The nominees were determined by a team of judges employed by Mediacorp; winners are selected by a majority vote from the entire judging panel.\nSince its inception, the award was given to six hosts. Quan Yi Fong is the most recent and final winner in this category for her performance in Where to Stay. Belinda Lee is the only host to win in this category twice. Guo Liang and Bryan Wong were nominated on five occasions, more than any other host. Guo also holds the record for the most nominations without a win.\nThe award was discontinued from 2016 as all performances in the hosting category (variety, info-ed) were shifted to the newly formed Best Programme Host category.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
