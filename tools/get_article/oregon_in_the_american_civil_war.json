The state's governor, John Whiteaker, was pro-slavery and opposed to Oregon's involvement in the conflict. As such, it was only in late 1862 with a new governor that the state raised any troops: the 1st Oregon Cavalry served until June 1865.\n[[File:Molalla_Flag_(1861).png|center|thumb|Unique American flag bearing a bald eagle, 7 white stripes and 6 red ones. With the motto \"the whole republic\" in the bottom white stripe, 1861]]\nDuring the Civil War, emigrants to the newfound gold fields in Idaho and Oregon continued to clash with the Paiute, Shoshone and Bannock tribes of Oregon, Idaho and Nevada until relations degenerated into the bloody 1864–1868 Snake War. The 1st Oregon Volunteer Infantry Regiment was formed in 1864 and its last company was mustered out of service in July 1867. Both units were used to guard travel routes and Indian reservations, escort emigrant wagon trains, and protect settlers from Indian raiders. Several infantry detachments also accompanied survey parties and built roads in central and southern Oregon.\nOregon's second United States Senator, Col. Edward Dickinson Baker was killed while leading Union troops at the Battle of Ball's Bluff near Leesburg, Virginia on October 21, 1861. His death in battle occurred exactly one month after another Oregonian, Captain James W. Lingenfelter of Company B, 71st Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment, was killed while on the picket line. In civilian life, Captain Lingenfelter had been a practicing attorney in Jacksonville, Oregon. He had been visiting in the East when the war started and enlisted to serve with Colonel Baker.\nOregon regiments in the Civil War\n* 1st Oregon Cavalry\n* 1st Oregon Volunteer Infantry Regiment\n* Mountain Rangers (Oregon Militia)\n* Washington Guards (Oregon Militia)\n* Fenian Guards (Oregon Militia)\n* Zouave Cadets (Oregon Militia)\n* Marion Rifles (Oregon Militia)\nCivil War posts, Oregon\n* Fort Dalles, Oregon, (1850–1867)\n* Fort Yamhill, Oregon (1856–1866)\n* Fort Hoskins, Oregon, (1857–1865)\n* Siletz Blockhouse, Oregon (1858–1866)\n* Camp Baker, Oregon (1862–1865),\n* Camp Barlow, Oregon, (1862)\n* Camp Clackamas, Oregon, (1862)\n* Post at Grand Ronde Indian Agency or Fort Lafayette, Oregon 1863,\n* Fort Klamath, Oregon, (1863–1890)\n* Fort at Point Adams, Oregon  (1863–1865)\n* Fort Stevens, Oregon  (1865–1947)\n* Camp Alvord, Oregon (1864–1866)\n* Camp Dalgren, Oregon (1864)\n* Camp Henderson, Oregon, 1864–1866\n* Camp Lincoln, Oregon 1864\n* Camp Maury, Oregon 1864\n* Camp Russell, Oregon 1864–1865\n* Camp Watson, Oregon 1864–1869\n* Camp Colfax, Oregon, 1865, 1867\n* Camp Currey, Oregon  1865–1866\n* Camp Logan, Oregon (1865–1868)\n* Camp Lyon, Oregon (1865–1869)\n* Camp Polk, Oregon (1865–1866)\n* Camp on Silvies River, Oregon (1864?)\n* Camp Wright, Oregon (1865–1866)\n* Old Camp Warner, Oregon (1866–1867)\n* Camp Warner, Oregon (1867–1874)\nSee also\n*Pacific Coast Theater of the American Civil War\n*Idaho in the American Civil War\n*Montana in the American Civil War\n*Washington in the American Civil War\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Carter, Bryan Anthony. \"Frontier Apart: Identity, Loyalty, and the Coming of the Civil War on the Pacific Coast\" (PhD.
