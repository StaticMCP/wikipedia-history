In the episode \"Senior Center Showdown\", Barry failed to buy a unit, but he was given a credit of $30.00, because he later bet his day's budget on a game of bridge, and won. In many cases, the values of items are estimates made on the spot by the cast members, and are not necessarily actual profits or losses. Some of the episodes were not aired in the order that they were filmed. Therefore, the * column in each season's episode list indicates the sequential order of that episode.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|-\n!rowspan = \"2\"|\n!rowspan =

Cerritos before he came.\n* 2 It was revealed at the end of the episode that despite not spending any money at the auction, Barry bet his entire budget for the day at a bridge tournament, which earned him a profit of $30.00.\n* 3 Darrell bought a unit for $400.  And after he looked through the unit for profitable items, he soon gives it to Dave for free because he thought there was no money to be made on the unit.  Later after Dave gets the unit, he ends up making money on the unit he got from Darrell.\n* 4 Although Dave did not attend the auction in Riverside, Barry donated a collection of fur coats to him, as he did not wish to keep/sell them. Dave made an overall profit of $648.00 on the collection of coats.\n* 5 This locker was bought by Dave's son, Dave Hester Jr.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130315113615/http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/tv/storage-wars/episode-guide/EP01341345?aid=zap2it Storage Wars Zap2it Episode List]"
