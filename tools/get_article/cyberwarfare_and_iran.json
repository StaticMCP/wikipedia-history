Being both a victim and wager of cyberwarfare, Iran is considered an emerging military power in the field. Since November 2010, an organization called \"The Cyber Defense Command\" (; Gharargah-e Defa-e Saiberi) has been operating in Iran under the supervision of the country's \"Passive Civil Defense Organization\" (; Sazeman-e Padafand-e Gheyr-e Amel) which is itself a subdivision of the Joint Staff of Iranian Armed Forces.\nIran has been the target of cyberattacks, including the Operation Olympic Games (Stuxnet) attack by the United States and Israel on its nuclear facilities.\nAccording to a 2014 report by Institute for National Security Studies, Iran is \"one of the most active players in the international cyber arena\". In 2013, a Revolutionary Guards general stated that Iran has \"the 4th biggest cyber power among the world's cyber armies.\" According to a 2021 report by a cyber-security company, \"Iran is running two surveillance operations in cyber-space, targeting more than 1,000 dissidents\". As of 2024, Iran's cyber activities have advanced, particularly in their precision and intelligence-gathering capabilities, allowing for more accurate and targeted attacks against Israel. Following directives from Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei after the October 7 attacks, cyber operations expanded, including joint efforts with Hezbollah. Despite these advances, Iran's cyber capabilities still fall short of Israel's, with Iranian hackers' skills being likened to those of mid-level organized crime gangs. However, Israeli officials remain concerned that Iran could rapidly enhance its capabilities, particularly through potential cooperation with Russia.\nBackground\nNIN\nIranian cyber defense system - digital fortress part of national information network (national internet) - is developed for thwarting attacks and engaging attackers. In November 2022, the Iranian Majlis Islamic Consultative Assembly recommended a Passive Defence Incorporation.\nAttacks against Iran\nIn June 2010, Iran was the victim of a cyber-attack when its nuclear facility in Natanz was infiltrated by the cyber-worm 'Stuxnet'.  A combined effort by the United States and Israel, Stuxnet destroyed perhaps over 1,000 nuclear centrifuges and, according to a Business Insider article, \"[set] Tehran's atomic programme back by at least two years.\" The worm spread beyond the plant to allegedly infect over 60,000 computers, but the government of Iran indicates it caused no significant damage. Iran crowdsourced solutions to the worm and is purportedly now better positioned in terms of cyber warfare technology. No government claimed responsibility for the worm. The cyber-worm was also used against North Korea.\nEvents\n* In October 2013, media reported Mojtaba Ahmadi, who served as commander of the \"Cyber War Headquarters\" was found dead wounded by bullets in Karaj.\n*  November 2018: The Iranian telecommunication minister Mohammad-Javad Azari Jahromi accuses Israel of a failed cyberattack on its telecommunications infrastructure, and vows to respond with legal action.\n*October 2021: An attack paralyzed gas stations across the country, preventing users from purchasing fuel using state-issued cards and digital billboards displaying antigovernment messages\n*In September, October and November 2022, Iranian state networks and emails came under attack by Anonymous and other hacking groups acting in solidarity with Iranian protestors.\n*In the year 2023 several government ministries were fully hacked by multiple people including Ministry of Science research and technology on September 23.

The motive for the attack is unknown but experts suggested that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps could be using cyberwarfare to undermine the Iran nuclear deal.\n2022\n*  January 2022: The website of Israel's Jerusalem Post newspaper and the Twitter account of Maariv newspaper are hacked by suspected Iranian hackers. The website's content was replaced with a threat to target the Shimon Peres Negev Nuclear Research Center, and an apparent reference to Qasem Soleimani who was assassinated exactly two years earlier in Baghdad, Iraq.\n*  March 2022: Large-scale cyberattacks were launched against multiple Israeli government websites, allegedly by Iran as retaliation for failed Mossad operations, though neither the attack attribution nor the purported Mossad operations could be confirmed as of March 2022.

The group had been using OpenAI services to research evasion techniques, write and refactor code, and create phishing campaign content.\n*April 2024 Israel secrets published by Iranian website,\n*In June 2024, Iranian-backed hackers, identified as Mint Sandstorm (also known as Charming Kitten or APT35), targeted a high-ranking official from a U.S. presidential campaign with a spear-phishing attack. The hackers used a compromised email account to send a malicious link.\n*July 2024 MuddyWater increased the cyber attacks in the Middle East.\n*On August 9, 2024, Microsoft reported that Iran has intensified its interference in the US elections by launching fake news sites and conducting hacking attempts. According to a Washington Post report, Iranian-operated news networks, such as Nio Thinker and Savannah Time, aim to polarize American voters by promoting extreme viewpoints. Microsoft also detailed a spear-phishing attack conducted by Iranian hackers targeting a US presidential campaign. This group used a compromised email account to attempt unauthorized access to sensitive information. Another Iranian group also managed to breach an account belonging to a county government employee in a swing state.\n*In September 2024, U.S. authorities revealed that Iranian hackers had accessed and distributed stolen information from Trump's campaign to individuals linked to Biden's re-election effort, aiming to disrupt the election. Despite Iran's denial of involvement, officials suggested the intent was to erode public confidence in the electoral process.\n*Also in September 2024, Swedish authorities revealed that a cyber group called Anzu, operating under Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), were responsible for hacking into a Swedish text messaging service in July 2023, taking over passwords, usernames and other tools, and sending thousands of messages calling Swedes \"demons\" and bearing instructions to exact vengeance upon Koran burners. Iran denied the accusation, though the investigation by the Swedish Prosecution Authority managed to identify the individual hackers responsible for the data breach. In a statement by Justice Minister Gunnar Stromme it was said that the goal was to destabilise Sweden or increase polarisation, and the security service warned that Iran is among those seeking to create division and bolster their own regimes.\nOn October 30 FBI and Treasury released a cybsecurity threat advisory related in relation to Emennet Passargad.\nIn November 2024 ClearSky revealed an Iranian \"dream job malware\" APT TA455 doing an op using North Korean shared methods targeting US defence sector.\nIranian state-sponsored hackers, identified as TA455 (also known as APT35 and Charming Kitten), have been conducting a cyber espionage campaign targeting the aerospace industry since September 2023, using tactics similar to those of North Korean threat actors. The campaign involves creating fake recruiter profiles on LinkedIn and using malicious domains to lure victims into downloading malware known as SnailResin. Victims are enticed to open ZIP files disguised as job-related documents, which have a low antivirus detection rate. The malware is deployed through DLL side-loading attacks, closely mirroring techniques used by North Korean hackers. Researchers suggest that the Iranian hackers may have adopted these methods from North Korea, particularly given the malware's initial association with North Korean groups like Kimsuky and Lazarus. TA455 employs Cloudflare to obscure its command-and-control domains and encodes command and control data on GitHub to blend in with legitimate web traffic, making tracking their infrastructure difficult. The primary targets of this campaign are aerospace professionals, with the goal of infiltrating networks within the aerospace, aviation, and defense sectors, particularly in the Middle East, including Israel, the UAE, and potentially Turkey, India, and Albania. The goal appears to be espionage and data exfiltration from these high-value targets in the aerospace sector.\nThe UK and US have jointly issued a warning about ongoing spear-phishing attacks conducted by cyber actors affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). These sophisticated attacks target individuals connected to Iranian and Middle Eastern affairs, including government officials, think tank personnel, journalists, activists, and those involved in US political campaigns. The attackers use social engineering techniques to impersonate trusted contacts, aiming to gain access to victims' personal and business accounts. They often use fraudulent login pages to obtain credentials, allowing them to access sensitive information and manipulate email accounts. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and its US counterparts are urging at-risk individuals to follow mitigation steps and utilize free cyber defence services to protect themselves. Paul Chichester, NCSC Director of Operations, emphasized the persistent nature of this threat and the importance of remaining vigilant, particularly for those in sensitive sectors.\nDecember\n*FBI's Donald Trump appointment director Kash Patel successfully hacked.\n*Cotton Sandstorm : Meta reported that they had successfully detected and taken down 48 accounts belonging to IRGC posing as anti west activists part of an influence op\nMarch 2025\nLabDookhtegan launched a cyberattack against Iranian oil rigs jamming their comms and electronic guidance systems and crippling and disrupting satellite network connectivity of 116 ships.\nCodebreakers hackers released entire database records of bank sepah from upto 1925.\nIranians hacked public announcement speakers from an Israeli kindergarten.\nIn the January 30th Iranians failed to hack Gemini accounts product of Google.\nIn February Minister of intelligence hacked 2 terabytes of data from Israeli police.\nIn March a 30000 ddos bot network was discovered originating in Iran.\n*30 million users of Mobile Communications of Iran hacked .\nApril 2025\nIn April Iranian regime reported a cyber attack on regime infrastructure.\nMay 2025\nUnit42 discovered an Iranian APT35 sponsored fake german Mega Model agency fashion Modeling website collecting user data on behalf of fake AI generated identity Shir Benzion.\nIn May 14 Prana group hack revealed masked identity of Majiz Azami , owner of Sepeher Energy Jahan and its subsidiary Energy Hamta Pars , a front company for Iranian Armed Forces Staff to be using Qatari's help to smuggle 65 million barrels of oil worth $4.2bn.
