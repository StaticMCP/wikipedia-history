This clan traced its lineage to its first ancestor, Lakanna, who descended from the plateau approximately six generations ago. Lakanna was a prominent figure, celebrated as a warrior, skilled cattlekeeper, and honey hunter, embodying the values and traditions of the Mmari clan.\nWithin the sociopolitical structure of Siha, each clan was assigned specific roles that contributed to the community's cohesion and security. The Mmari clan was particularly noted for its leadership in raids, a responsibility that underscored their martial prowess and strategic importance. These raids often served to acquire resources, protect territory, and assert the clan's influence within the region.\nThe cultural practices and traditions of the Mmari clan were deeply rooted in their historical lineage and their connection to the land. They engaged in various agricultural and pastoral activities, relying on cattle herding and farming as key components of their livelihood in Siha. The clan's identity was further enriched by oral traditions that celebrated their ancestry and narrated the exploits of their forebears, particularly Lakanna.\nMmari rulers of Siha\nMangi Saiye was the first ruler of Siha. Saiye, a member of the Mmari clan in Komboko mtaa, was a notable warrior who learned combat tactics from the Warush after being captured and raised by them. Upon returning to his community, he reassured his people about the Warusha threat, teaching them defensive strategies, including trench digging and spear techniques.\nSaiye led the Siha people in their first raids, successfully crossing the Lawati River and returning with cattle. He later assisted Mang’aro in attempting to reclaim the Machame throne, but his forces were ambushed by King Ndesserua's warriors. Most of Saiye's men were killed, and he himself perished in the battle, which is now named after him. Saiye is remembered as Siha's first great warrior, and his legacy is reflected in local sayings that caution against the reckless use of force.\nMangi Ngalami, Saiye's cousin, was the second and final ruler of Siha. He came to power shortly after the death of the renowned warrior and Mangi Saiye, and the Siha Kingdom was plunged into a state of chaos, primarily due to the lack of strong leadership. With the absence of effective governance, only elderly men of Siha remained to oversee various segments of the territory, leading to fragmentation and instability within the community. During this tumultuous period, clan elders of Siha country took on the responsibility of managing different areas, but their authority was limited and often challenged.\nIn time, the elders elected Ngalami of the Mmari clan as the new Mangi (king). Ngalami was a relative of Saiye and shared a similar age and background, also residing in Komboko. His election marked a significant moment in Siha’s leadership, as he represented continuity with the previous lineage while bringing a fresh perspective to governance.\nInitially, Ngalami established his authority over most of the Siha region, excluding the chiefdom of Samake. His jurisdiction extended across the lower mitaa, which included Komboko, Mrau, Wanri, and Mae, as well as potentially influencing the adjacent upper mitaa of Maene and Kichicha. Under his rule, the region experienced a period of relative peace, allowing for some stability in local governance and community life. This tranquility fostered a sense of unity among the clans, although challenges remained from external threats and internal disputes.\nHowever, Ngalami's leadership was ultimately cut short in the late nineteenth century when he was executed by the Germans during a significant event known as the great hanging in old Moshi. This execution marked a pivotal moment in Siha's history, as Ngalami was the last elected leader from the Mmari dynasty. His death signified not only the end of his rule but also the conclusion of a lineage that had played a crucial role in shaping the region's identity and governance.\nNgalami's legacy endures in the collective memory of the Siha people, who remember him as a leader who navigated a challenging period in their history. His rise and fall illustrate the complexities of leadership in a time of upheaval and the importance of strong governance in maintaining social order. The transition from Ngalami's leadership to subsequent forms of governance reflected the ongoing evolution of political structures within the Siha area during the 20th century. His heir was his eldest, Barnabas Mmari who fled to Akheri in Arusha during the British colonial occupation.\nNotable people of the Mmari clan and dyansty\n* Dora Mmari Msechu, former ambassador, direct decendant of Ngalami.\nReferences"
