The dynasty was founded by Sri Gupta in late 3rd century CE, but Chandragupta I is credited as the real founder of the empire. The empire lasted until 550 CE. The factors for the downfall of the empire were Hunnic invasions, dynastic dissensions, taxes, internal rebellions and decentralization.\nThe Gupta Empire was vast and covered most of the Indian subcontinent. Chandragupta I, Samudragupta, Chandragupta II and Skandagupta were some of its mightiest rulers. It brought about a golden era to the region, resulting in technological advancements and cultural improvements. Gupta emperors generally used the title Maharajadhiraja.\nFamily tree\n3rd Century|boxstyle_A01=border-color:#FFD700}}\n3rd–4thCentury|boxstyle_A01=border-color:#FFD700}}\n319-335/50|boxstyle_A01=border-color:#FFD700}}\n335/50-375|boxstyle_A01=border-color:#FFD700|\nA02=Kacha(4)r.  4th Century|boxstyle_A02=border-color:#FFD700}}\n375–415|boxstyle_A01=border-color:#FFD700|\nA02=Ramagupta(6)r.  4th Century|boxstyle_A02=border-color:#FFD700}}\n415–455|boxstyle_A01=border-color:#FFD700}}\n455–467|boxstyle_A01=border-color:#FFD700|\nA02=Purugupta(9)r.  467–473|boxstyle_A02=border-color:#FFD700}}\n473–476|boxstyle_A01=border-color:#FFD700|\nA02=Budhagupta(11)r.  476–495|boxstyle_A02=border-color:#FFD700|\nA03=Narasimhagupta(12)r.  495–530|boxstyle_A03=border-color:#FFD700}}\n530–540|boxstyle_A01=border-color:#FFD700}}\n540–550|boxstyle_A01=border-color:#FFD700}}\nList of rulers\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=2 | Ruler!!Reign (CE)!!Notes\n|-\n|Sri-Gupta I|||||| Founder of the dynasty.\n|-\n|Ghatotkacha||||280/290–319 CE||Second king of Gupta Dynasty\n|-\n|Chandra-Gupta I||||319–335 CE||His title Maharajadhiraja (\"king of great kings\") suggests that he was the first emperor of the dynasty. It is not certain how he turned his small ancestral kingdom into an empire, although a widely accepted theory among modern historians is that his marriage to Licchavi princess Kumaradevi helped him extend his political power.\n|-\n|Samudra-Gupta||||335–375 CE||Defeated several kings of northern India, and annexed their territories to his empire. He also marched along the south-eastern coast of India, advancing as far as the Pallava kingdom. In addition, he subjugated several frontier kingdoms and tribal oligarchies. His empire extended from Ravi River in the west to the Brahmaputra River in the east, and from the Himalayan foothills in the north to central India in the south-west; several rulers along the south-eastern coast were his tributaries.\n|-\n|Kacha||||mid 4th century CE|| Rival brother/king, possibly an usurper, there are coins who attest him as ruler; possibly identical with Samudra-Gupta.\n|-\n|Rama-Gupta||||||\n|-\n|Chandra-Gupta II Vikramaditya||||375–415 CE|| Continued the expansionist policy of his father Samudragupta: historical evidence suggests that he defeated the Western Kshatrapas, and extended the Gupta empire from the Indus River in the west to the Bengal region in the east, and from the Himalayan foothills in the north to the Narmada River in the south.\n|-\n|Kumara-Gupta I||||415–455 CE|| He seems to have maintained control of his inherited territory, which extended from Gujarat in the west to Bengal region in the east.\n|-\n|Skanda-Gupta||||455–467 CE||It is stated that he restored the fallen fortunes of the Gupta family, which has led to suggestions that during his predecessor's last years, the Empire may have suffered reverses, possibly against the Pushyamitras or the Hunas. He is generally considered the last of the great Gupta Emperors.\n|-\n|Puru-Gupta||||467–473 CE||\n|-\n|Kumara-Gupta II Kramaditya||||473–476 CE||\n|-\n|Buddha-Gupta||||476–495 CE||He had close ties with the rulers of Kannauj and together they sought to run the Alchon Huns (Hunas) out of the fertile plains of Northern India.\n|-\n|Narasimha-Gupta Baladitya||||495–530 CE||\n|-\n|Kumara-Gupta III||||530–540 CE||\n|-\n|Vishnu-Gupta Candraditya||||540–550 CE||\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* Gupta Empire\n* Gupta era\n* Later Gupta dynasty\n* Middle kingdoms of India\n* List of monarchs of Magadha\nReferences"
