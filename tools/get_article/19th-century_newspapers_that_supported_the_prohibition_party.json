The Delaware, Ohio Signal, established in 1873, claimed to be the oldest distinct Prohibition Party paper in the world.\nHistory\nIt was difficult to draw the line between papers that advocated prohibition in a nonpartisan way, and those that advocated the Prohibition Party method. The former would include nearly all the religions papers, and many Republican and Democratic papers. This list draws the line distinctly on the support of the Prohibition Party. A few of the papers were merely local newspapers that did not devote much space to political discussion or news, but did favor the Prohibition Party when they did speak.\nList of newspapers\nThe list, substantially, was published in the Voice of June 30, 1892, with the request that any person noticing any errors or omissions communicate with the author. Several corrections and additions were received, and the information added. In three or four cases, papers were referred to as omitted, without any information as to price, circulation, etc. in such cases, if the paper was not in any of the newspaper annuals, it was omitted, there not being time for correspondence. No Prohibition Party paper of any considerable prominence was omitted from the list.—\nCalifornia\n* Voice, Los Angeles, California\n* Redlands Daily Facts, Redlands, California\n* The Pacific Ensign, San Francisco, California\n* Prohibitionist, San Jose, California\nColorado\n* Bulletin, Denver, Colorado\nConnecticut\n* New England Home, Hartford, Connecticut\n* Review, Groton, Connecticut\n* Banner, Highland Park, Connecticut\nFlorida\n* Mid-Florida Herald, Midland, Florida\nGeorgia\n* Southern Star, Atlanta, Georgia\n* Southern Agent (m.), Atlanta, Georgia\n* Times, Demorest, Georgia\nIllinois\n* Lancet, Bloomington, Illinois\n* Advance, Bunker Hill, Illinois\n* Lever, Chicago, Illinois\n* The Union Signal, Chicago, Illinois\n* State Sentinel, Decatur, Illinois\n* Friend of Home, Effingham, Illinois\n* Patrol, Geneva, Illinois\n* News, Joliet, Illinois\n* Truth, Monmouth, Illinois\n* Spectator, Oquawka, Illinois\n* Patriot, Quincy, Illinois\n* Monitor, Rockford, Illinois\n* Best Words, Shelbyville, Illinois\n* Liberator, Springfield, Illinois\n* Journal, Vienna, Illinois\nIndiana\n* Crystallizer, Goshen, Indiana\n* Phalanx, Indianapolis, Indiana\n* Organizer, Indianapolis, Indiana\n* Standard, Leesburg, Indiana\n* Times, Logansport, Indiana\n* Home (m.), New Albany, Indiana\n* Prohihition Era, Princeton, Indiana\n* Enterprise, Richmond, Indiana\nIowa\n* News (d).
