It was fought by Pomerania-Stettin against the Margraviate of Brandenburg and Pomerania-Wolgast. The war was won by Brandenburg, with them annexing Uckermark.\nThe war\nBetween 1409 and 1411, duke Swantibor III, ruler of Pomerania-Stettin, had been appointed the margrave of Mittelmark. In 1411, Sigismund, the margrave of Branderburg, had appointed Frederick I, as the new margrave of Mittelmark. However, Swantibor had never recognized the decision and Fredrick's claim to the area, insisting that he was the rightful ruler. In 1412, Swantibor III had been recognized by part of the Mittlemark nobility, as their sovereign ruler. In October 1412, Pomerania-Stettin had attacked the Mittelmark, in the Margraviate of Brandenburg. Brandenburg had been allied with Pomerania-Wolgast, and used a mercenary knight army from Franconia. Stettin forces were commanded by dukes Casimir V and Otto II, sons of Swantibor III, as well as by Kaspar Gans.\nOn 24 October 1412, both sides had fought in the battle on the Kremmer Levee, over the flooded flatlands near the village of Kremmer. The Franconian forces of Brandenburg were commanded by Johannes von Hohenlohe, Kraft von Lentersheim, and Philipp von Utenhofen. All three of them died in the battle, being pushed from the levee and drowning in the water. The battle was won by Stettin forces.\nIn 1414, Brandenburg had conquered Uckermark. On 16 December 1415, when Frederick I and the dukes of Wolgast, had signed a treaty with the dukes of Stettin, ending the war.\nNotable battles\n* Battle of Kremmer Levee\nCitations\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Edward Rymar, Wojny i spory pomorsko-brandenburskie w XV-XVI w.
