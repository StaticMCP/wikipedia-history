The war has been characterized by the use of armoured warfare;  drone warfare, especially the use of Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 and Israeli loitering munition Harop drones; heavy artillery; rocket attacks; and trench warfare. It has also featured the deployment of cluster munitions, which are banned by the majority of the international community but not by Armenia or Azerbaijan: Azerbaijan states that Armenia has deployed cluster munitions against civilians, and international third parties have confirmed evidence of Azerbaijan's use of cluster munitions against civilian areas of Nagorno-Karabakh. A series of ballistic missile attacks have inflicted mass civilian casualties in Ganja, Azerbaijan, while civilian residences and infrastructure in Stepanakert, and elsewhere have been targeted, inflicting casualties and causing extensive damage.\nThe conflict is also marked by extensive social media campaigning - some of which is alleged to be \"inauthentic\" - and widespread misinformation, exacerbated by the low number of journalists that have access to the frontline. This phenomenon has been characterized as an information war concurrent to the physical battles on the ground. Facebook has claimed to have removed a number of Facebook and Instagram accounts and pages that were involved in \"co-ordinated inauthentic behavior\".\nThe amount of territory contested is relatively restricted, but the war has expanded beyond the borders of Nagorno-Karabakh due to the level of conflict and kind of munitions deployed and spilled over international borders.
