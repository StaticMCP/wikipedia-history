The battle saw the rearguard of the United Liberating Army of Peru commanded by Antonio José de Sucre suffer a minor defeat at the hands of the vanguard of the Royal Army of Peru commanded by Jerónimo Valdés. According to Sucre his losses were 300 men, some artillery and other pieces of equipments.\nThe rearguard, formed by the Rifles battalion, composed of British volunteers under the command of Colonel Arthur Sandes, was overtaken by Royalist forces. In the engagement, the Rifles lost a third of their force, including their second-in-command, Major Thomas Duchbury, who was killed in action.\nThe Royalist lost 30 men in the engagement.\nThe following day, the Patriot forces of Sucre defeated the pursuing Royalists at the plains of Tambo Cangallo.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
