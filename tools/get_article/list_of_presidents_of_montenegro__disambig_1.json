Prior to 1974, Montenegro's head of state was the speaker (president) of the Montenegrin parliament.\nThe President (Predsjednik) is directly elected to a five-year term and is limited by the Constitution to a maximum of two terms. In addition to being the Commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces, the President has the procedural duty of appointing the Prime Minister with the consent of the Parliament, and has some influence on foreign policy. The President's office is located in the Blue Palace, in the former royal capital Cetinje.\nMontenegro as part of Yugoslavia (until 1992)\nParties:\n|Independent|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Communist Party / League of Communists|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Democratic Party of Socialists|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\nStatus:\nPeople's Republic of Montenegro (1945–1963)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2|\n! rowspan=2| Portrait\n! width=30% rowspan=2| Name\n! colspan=3| Term of office\n! rowspan=2| Political Party\n|-\n!
