It was designed to maximize munitions output and brought private companies supplying the armed forces under the tight control of the newly created Ministry of Munitions, under David Lloyd George. The policy, according to J. A. R. Marriott, was that:\nThe law imposed very strong regulations on wages, hours and employment conditions. It was a penal offence for a worker to leave his current job at such a \"Controlled Establishment\" without the consent of his employer, which in practice was \"almost impossible\" to obtain. The Clyde Workers' Committee was established to oppose the act.\nThe Munitions Act was a response to the Shell Crisis of 1915 when inadequate supplies of artillery shells and other munitions contributed to a political crisis for prime minister H. H. Asquith and the formation on 17 May 1915 of a coalition government of all three major parties.\nThe act forbade strikes and lockouts and replaced them with compulsory arbitration. It set up a system of controlling war industries. It established munitions tribunals that were special courts to enforce good working practices. It suspended, for the duration, restrictive practices by trade unions. It limited labour mobility between jobs. The courts ruled the definition of munitions to be broad enough to include textile workers and dock workers. The law was repealed in 1919, but similar legislation took effect during the Second World War.\nAs promised in 1915, under the Restoration of Pre-War Practices Act 1919, the main features of the law were abolished regarding manning arrangements (in particular employment of women and unskilled workers), closed shop agreements, restriction of overtime and apprenticeship rules.\nSee also\n* History of the United Kingdom during World War I\n* Defence of the Realm Act 1914\n* Munitionette\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://sites.scran.ac.uk/redclyde/redclyde/rc105.htm Page from the Munitions of War Act, 1915]\n* [https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1915/jul/01/clause-4-controlled-establishments House of Commons debate on the Act, 1 July 1915]\n* [https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/lords/1916/jan/13/munitions-of-war-amendment-bill House of Lords debate on the Act, 13 January 1916]"
