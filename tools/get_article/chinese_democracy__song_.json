It was released as a radio single on October 22, 2008 and was released on the iTunes Store on November 9, 2008. It was primarily written by Axl Rose and Josh Freese. It was the band's first single of original material since \"Estranged\" was released in 1994 as the final single off the 1991 album Use Your Illusion II.\nCommercially, \"Chinese Democracy\" charted well in most territories. It was particularly successful in Scandinavian countries, topping the Norwegian Singles Chart and reaching number three in Sweden and Finland. The song reached the top 20 in Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and Switzerland, as well as number 27 on the UK Singles Chart and in Flemish Belgium and New Zealand. In North America, the song reached number 10 in Canada and number 34 in the United States. The song reached number five on the US Mainstream Rock chart.\nOrigins\nThe song began development in late 1998 and continued until the album’s release in 2008, spanning a 10-year period. Former drummer Josh Freese revealed in a 2021 interview with the Appetite for Distortion podcast that he wrote most of the foundational music for the track. “There are a few things that I really had a big hand in writing, such as the title track, Chinese Democracy, I wrote the music for it,” Freese said. He also recalled that the song was once titled “Smells Like Josh Spirit,” after someone pointed out that its sound was somewhat similar to Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit.”\nPrior to the song being released as a single, \"Chinese Democracy\" had been played live by Guns N' Roses on their Chinese Democracy Tour in 2001, 2002, 2006 and 2007.\nThe final line of the song was originally \"like if your ass were your head, you can tell\", but was ultimately changed to \"when their arms reach out for your help\".\nAxl Rose introduced the band's first live performance of the song in Las Vegas, Nevada on January 1, 2001 with the following:\n}}Before the album’s release, former guitarist Bumblefoot made significant modifications to the track, contributing new guitar parts to the intro and verse sections and incorporating a heavier, more nu-metal influenced sound. Axl Rose also recorded an additional layer of vocals during the final stages of production, further refining the song’s overall tone and texture.\nReception\nThe song has received a mostly positive reception from critics. It was played over 4 million times on Myspace in one day. Spin Magazine noted that with \"a thick, muscular four-chord riff and that Axl banshee wail, only the most stubbornly jaded will manage to suppress the goosebump reflex\", but criticized it for being \"hook-free\".\nThe Los Angeles Times, on the other hand, described Axl as \"the most ambitious hard rocker of the late 20th century\" and though also noting that \"the chorus is just an extension of the verses\" and that the song therefore \"doesn't behave the way radio-friendly singles usually do\", still stated that \"the refrain sticks after several listens\". Ultimately, the Los Angeles Times concluded that the song \"brings back a passionate weirdness that the hard rock airwaves have lacked\", also comparing it to David Bowie's \"I'm Afraid of Americans\", noting that \"Both songs have a suffocated quality, as if their makers are pushing through smoke to express these thoughts. It's the sound of florid, romantic rockers aiming for something cold and modern\".\nPopwatch noted that not \"even the greatest GNR song ever conceived could possibly be worth so sustained a buildup\" and echoed the sentiment that the chorus of the song \"feels like the buildup to a great refrain, but turns out to really be the refrain\", while MenStyle.com suggested that, judging amongst the leaked songs, \"Chinese Democracy\" was a curious choice for lead single, suggesting that \"Madagascar\" or \"There Was a Time\" would have been superior.\nA review on the site Zimbio argued that \"no matter how I wanted to hate this song, I can't\", describing the tune as \"better than some songs on Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II\" and declared that \"if you can put your bias aside, you will find this song isn't bad\" and that \"it does make me excited to hear the rest of the album\".\nThe then former Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash reacted positively to the song upon release, saying \"That sounds cool. It's good to hear [Axl Rose's] voice again, y'know\".\nThe song was the official theme of WWE's Armageddon 2008 pay-per-view.\nLive performances\n\"Chinese Democracy\" has been played live at most Guns N' Roses shows since the first Chinese Democracy Tour in 2001. With each tour, the performances drastically changed, gaining more background structure and guitar parts, along with a second solo akin to the album version. From 2009 to 2014, the song was used exclusively as the show opener.  The song continues to be played even after the pre-Chinese Democracy members, Slash and Duff McKagan, have rejoined.\nPersonnel\nCredits are adapted from the album's liner notes.\n'''Guns N' Roses\n* Axl Rose – lead vocals, keyboards\n* Paul Tobias, Ron \"Bumblefoot\" Thal and Richard Fortus – rhythm guitar\n* Robin Finck and Buckethead – lead guitar, rhythm guitar\n* Tommy Stinson – bass, backing vocals\n* Frank Ferrer – drums\n* Dizzy Reed – keyboards, backing vocals\n* Chris Pitman – sub bass, keyboards, backing vocals\nAdditional credits'''\n* Guitar solos – Robin Finck, Buckethead\n* Intro – Eric Caudieux, Caram Costanzo\n* Arrangement – Axl Rose, Paul Tobias, Sean Beavan\n* Digital editing – Eric Caudieux, Caram Costanzo, Axl Rose, Sean Beavan\n* Additional guitar processing – Chris Pitman\nCharts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (2008)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA Charts)\n| 54\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nCertifications\nReferences"
