These awards were conferred after a competitive selection process, which commenced in late June every year and culminated in the announcement of the awards on the eve of the International Youth Day on 12 August. The Ministry of Youth Affairs was dissolved in 2010. Since 2019,  the Youth for Pakistan organization confers National Youth Awards along similar lines.\nHistory\nThe awards were instituted in 2007, and were awarded annually. Advertisements are placed in leading dailies of Pakistan in late June asking for nominations. These nominations then underwent a process of thorough scrutiny by a team which includes educationists, researchers etc., in addition to the governmental personnel. After multiple rounds of meetings for this selective and transparent selection process, the awards were announced by the Ministry on 12 August every year.\nObjective and categories\nThe main objective of the National Youth Awards, as dictated by the policy directives of the Ministry of Youth Affairs of the Government of Pakistan, was to \"Recognize the achievements of the young people in their lives and of volunteers working for the welfare and development of the youth\".\nThere are different categories in which the awards are given. The awards are given to individuals who have excelled in the fields of Literature; Culture; Education; Science & Technology; Sports; Business; Community Service; Media; Qirat and Na`at; Management Science; Agriculture; Computer Science and Information Technology; Environment; Technicians, Paramedics  and skilled workers. In addition, there are awards for Special Youth and the Jinnah Youth Award for Organizations & Personnel working for the welfare of the youth.\nThere are no fixed numbers of awards that are conferred every year. For the year 2008, there were 35 awards that were handed out, for this year round i.e. 2009, there were only 25 awards given. The Awards are meant to encourage and garner as broad participation as possible, without placing any limitations on applications. However, the awards are only given to those who have proven their outstanding academic and extra-curricular achievements. When the awards-conferring body feels that there are no applications that merit the award for a particular category, no award is given in that category, regardless of the number of potential applications.\nEligibility and benefits of the award\nAny Pakistani National aged 15–29 is eligible to apply for the National Youth Awards. There is no age limit for the Jinnah Youth Award. The Award, in addition to a certificate and a shield, is accompanied by PKR 50,000 for each recipient.\nNational Youth Awards 2008\nNames of award winners for 2008\n{| class = \"wikitable\"\n|-\n!No. !!
