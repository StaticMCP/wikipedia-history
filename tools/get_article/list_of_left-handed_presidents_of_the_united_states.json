While there have been 47 presidencies, only 45 individuals have served as president. Two presidents have served non-consecutive terms: and thus, Grover Cleveland is numbered as both the 22nd and 24th U.S. president, and Donald Trump is numbered as both the 45th and 47th U.S. president.}} who have held the office of United States president have been left-handed. Only one U.S. president prior to the 20th century was known to be left-handed. Since World War II there have been fourteen U.S. presidents and six of them have been left-handed.\nVarious theories about why left-handers are overrepresented among U.S. presidents have been proposed. Biologist Amar Klar studied handedness and determined that left-handed people \"...have a wider scope of thinking\". In a 2019 Journal of Neurosurgery article Nathan R. Selden argued that since left-handed people are right-hemisphere–dominant individuals, this might make presidents, \"more effective leaders or at least more effective political candidates\". A University of British Columbia psychology professor, Stanley Coren, authored the book The Left-Handed Syndrome, in which he claimed that \"left-handers actually have a profile that works very well for a politician\". In a 2021 Business Insider article titled, \"From Barack Obama to Julius Caesar, here are 12 world leaders who were left-handed\" reporters Alexandra Ma and Talia Lakritz state, \"According to some research, lefties may be more creative, be better at 'divergent thinking' – generating new ideas based on existing information – and face challenges better.\"\nMedical researcher Jonathan Belsey argued that, given a 13% prevalence of left-handedness, the long-term average is not statistically high, but rather has a p-value of 0.77, and that even the post-1881 prevalence has a 0.10 likelihood of occurring by chance.\nLeft-handed presidents of the United States\n* James A. Garfield (March 4, 1881 – September 19, 1881) was ambidextrous; he was the only known left-handed president prior to the 20th century.\n* Harry S. Truman (April 12, 1945 – January 20, 1953) was left-handed as a child, he wrote with his right hand and used his left for most other activities.\n* Gerald Ford (August 9, 1974 – January 20, 1977) was left-handed.\n* Ronald Reagan (January 20, 1981 – January 20, 1989) was naturally left-handed, but wrote with his right hand.\n* George H. W. Bush (January 20, 1989 – January 20, 1993) was left-handed. All three major candidates for president in 1992 were left-handed; Bill Clinton won.\n* Bill Clinton (January 20, 1993 – January 20, 2001) is left-handed.\n* Barack Obama (January 20, 2009 – January 20, 2017) is left-handed.\nOther presidents who demonstrated left-handed ability\n* Thomas Jefferson (March 4, 1801 – March 4, 1809) was right-handed, but after an injury to his right wrist, he wrote with his left hand. He was said to have been ambidextrous, and he could write equally well with either hand.\n* Woodrow Wilson (March 4, 1913 – March 4, 1921) was right-handed but after a stroke Wilson was able to use his left hand to write \"perfectly legible well-formed characters\". His ability was called \"remarkable neurologically\".\n}}\nNotes\nFurther reading\n* [https://thejns.org/view/journals/j-neurosurg/131/1/article-p320.xml Right brain?
