Drawn from previously unissued recordings found in the Julius Hemphill Archive at the Fales Library of New York University, and compiled by Marty Ehrlich, the album presents Hemphill in a variety of mostly live solo and group contexts recorded over a period of thirty years, beginning in 1977, and also includes a disc on which he conducts his compositions. The album was released on CD by New World Records in 2021, and each of the discs is also available as a digital download.\nReception\n}}\nMark Corroto of All About Jazz called the album an \"important document,\" and wrote: \"The music leaves you convinced... that Julius Hemphill deserves his place among the greatest musical minds of the 20th century.\"\nDownBeat's Peter Margasak stated that the album \"goes a long way in filling out the complex story of this multifaceted artist whose breadth and vision were seriously short-changed by the recording industry,\" and praised the \"astonishing small-group work\" heard on many of the tracks.\nWriter Richard Williams described the album as \"an extraordinarily rich piece of musical archaeology which covers many aspects of Hemphill's art at satisfying length,\" and commented: \"Throughout the listener is struck by how effectively Hemphill was able to blend free blowing with structured composition. Some of his themes have the intensity of bebop leavened with the humour of Monk, but with a down-home flavour that was Hemphill's own. Whether on alto or soprano, he was a stunningly fluent improviser who took off from a space between Charlie Parker and Ornette Coleman and headed out into his own territory.\"\nIn a review for NPR Music, Kevin Whitehead stated that the album is \"sprawling, a little uneven and with variable sound quality,\" and therefore not \"an ideal introduction to Julius Hemphill's music.\" However, he suggested that because \"Hemphill was one of the key jazz composers of the late 20th century,\" \"his music should be part of any informed listener's jazz education.\"\nSeymour Wright of The Wire noted that the album \"offers a fresh view and... insight into [Hemphill's] oeuvre,\" and remarked: \"Hemphill's music sounds fantastic. Beautiful, often see-sawing, compositions draw together, and stack and balance, long meaningful lines that can flip from horizontal to vertical, from flat out to a full stop, and back. Solid, and often slow, rhythms work up and build open, multilayered spaces for solo dialogue and exchange. And crucially, the groups Hemphill assembled to play his music involve utterly distinct, and now definitive, instrumental voices.\"\nWriting for Point of Departure, Bill Shoemaker commented: \"Throughout his life and for years after, there was the sense that we had only seen the tip of the iceberg, that there was so much more to Hemphill's music that went unheard. This revealing, richly rewarding collection confirms this... Hemphill was singular, as The Boyé Multi-National Crusade for Harmony makes plain. The rub remains that he had so much more music to make than his time allowed. Yet, the half glass Hemphill left is to be cherished, especially now, 25 years after his passing.\"\nThe Free Jazz Collective's Gary Chapin stated that the album \"fills a real need,\" and wrote: \"Like other greats of this music, Hemphill's genius included finding partners who could see the connection between interpretation and great improvisational voice. Both Bakida (sic) Carroll and Olu Dara, just for two examples are essential voices in Hemphill's work. No one else could add to the pieces in the way that they did.\"\nIn an article for Dusted Magazine, Michael Rosenstein remarked: \"Hemphill's discography was never extensive, and most of what he put out is now out of print. Which makes this expansive boxed set... invaluable... Any of these discs, taken separately, would be a welcome addition to Hemphill's discography. Taken together, they provide a wide-ranging, illuminating view even to those who've long immersed themselves in his music.\"\nSeth Colter Walls of The New York Times noted that the album \"showcases Julius Hemphill's work as a composer, saxophonist and flutist on the boundary between jazz and classical styles,\" and stated that the variety of music \"show[s] how thoroughly he adapted and reinvigorated\" his early influences.\nDisc 1 - The Boyé Multi-National Crusade for Harmony I\n;Track listing\n# \"Dear Friend\" – 17:37\n# \"Zuli\" – 18:21\n# \"Band Introduction\" – 0:44\n# \"At Harmony\" – 12:31\n# \"Air Rings\" – 12:32\n# \"Dimples: Fat Lady on Parade\" – 12:34\n*Tracks 1–4 were recorded in Toulouse, France, on December 6, 1980.
