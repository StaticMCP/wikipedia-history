The LCI and PRT were both part of the reunified Fourth International. The International recognised the PSR as its Portuguese section.\nIn 1998 Party renamed itself in order to join with some other left-wing parties in founding the Left Bloc ( or BE). The organisation retained the acronym (PSR) and became a civil society organisation under the name Revolutionary Socialist Political Association (Associação Política Socialista Revolucionária (APSR)). The original party, a member of the Fourth International, was however officially dissolved in 2008.\nThe historical leader of the PSR is Francisco Louçã, who would become leader of the Left Bloc.\nThe party had never achieved parliamentary representation before the merger in the Left Bloc, although it may be considered the 3rd or 4th biggest left-wing party in the country.\nHistory\n1970s\nAccão Comunista\nThe Internationalist Communist League () was a Trotskyist political party in Portugal. LCI was founded in 1973. It became the Portuguese section of the reunified Fourth International. LCI published Acção Comunista, and, for young people, \"Toupeira Vermelha\". In 1978 LCI merged with PRT to form the Revolutionary Socialist Party.\nIn 1979, the Party ran in a legislative election for the first time, achieving 0.6% of the voting.The next year, another legislative election took place and the Party achieved 1.0% of the votes.\n1980s\nIn 1983, the Party ran in the legislative election in coalition with the People's Democratic Union (Portuguese: União Democrática Popular or UDP) in some constituencies, receiving 0.4% in those constituencies and 0.2% in the others.\nIn 1985, after some splits, the Party gained a new life, mainly due to its anti-militaristic and anti-racist campaigns and in that year's election, the PSR got 0.6% of the vote. In 1987, the Party contested the first European Election held in Portugal, achieving 0.5%, and in the legislative election, achieving 0.51%.\nAlso in 1987, the Party started publishing of the Combate (Struggle) monthly newspaper.\nAt the elections for the European Parliament of 1989, the PSR received 0.8%.\n1990s\nIn the legislative election of 1991 got 1.12%, the best result in the Party's history, ran for the last time in an election in 1995, achieving 0.6%.\nMerging into Left Bloc\nIn 1998, the party formed a permanent coalition with the People's Democratic Union, the Politics XXI and the Left Revolutionary Front, creating the  (Left Bloc). In 2005, in the last congress in the party's history, it changed its status from a party to a political \"association\", which disappeared in 2013.\nElectoral results\nAssembly of the Republic\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n!Election\n! width=\"155px\" |Leader\n!Votes\n! %\n!Seats\n!+/-\n!Government\n|-\n!1979\n|\n|36,978\n|0.6 (#9)\n|}}\n|\n|\n|-\n!1980\n|\n|60,496\n|1.0 (#8)\n|}}\n|0\n|\n|-\n!1983\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" |with UDP\n|}}\n|0\n|\n|-\n!1985\n|\n|35,238\n|0.6 (#8)\n|}}\n|0\n|\n|-\n!1987\n| rowspan=\"3\" align=left|Francisco Louçã\n|32,977\n|0.6 (#7)\n|}}\n|0\n|\n|-\n!1991\n|64,159\n|1.1 (#6)\n|}}\n|0\n|\n|-\n!1995\n|37,638\n|0.6 (#6)\n|}}\n|0\n|\n|}\nEuropean Parliament\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n!Election\n! width=\"155px\" |Leader\n!Votes\n! %\n!Seats\n!+/-\n|-\n!1987\n|\n|29,909\n|0.5 (#9)\n|}}\n|\n|-\n!1989\n|\n|31,775\n|0.8 (#8)\n|}}\n|0\n|-\n!1994\n|align=left|Helena Lopes da Silva\n|17,780\n|0.6 (#7)\n|}}\n|0\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links"
