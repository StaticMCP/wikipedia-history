      "text": "# Timeline of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season\n\nThe 2001 Atlantic hurricane season was an above-average Atlantic hurricane season in which fifteen named storms formed.|group=\"nb\"}} The season officially began on June&nbsp;1 and ended on November&nbsp;30, dates that conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The season's first tropical cyclone, Tropical Storm Allison, formed on June&nbsp;5 while the season's final system, Hurricane Olga, dissipated on December&nbsp;6.\nThe season produced seventeen tropical depressions, of which fifteen intensified into tropical storms, nine became hurricanes, and four strengthened into major hurricanes.|group=\"nb\"}} The two most significant storms of the year, in terms of loss of life and damage, were Tropical Storm Allison and Hurricane Michelle. Forming over the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, Allison produced widespread heavy rainfall along its path (most notably across Texas and Louisiana), killing 41 people and inflicting $9 billion (2001&nbsp;USD) in damage. Following the season, Allison became the first tropical storm to have its name retired by the World Meteorological Organization. Hurricane Michelle was the most intense cyclone of the 2001 season, with winds reaching 140&nbsp;mph (220&nbsp;km/h). The storm's impacts extended from the Caribbean Sea to the Bahamas and were most severe in Cuba, cementing its status as one of the costliest cyclones on record there.\nThis timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. It includes information that was not released throughout the season, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not initially warned upon, has been included.\nTimeline\nJune\nJune&nbsp;1\n*The 2001 Atlantic hurricane season officially begins.\nJune&nbsp;5\n*12:00&nbsp;UTC (7:00&nbsp;a.m. CDT) – Tropical Storm Allison develops from an area of low pressure about 120&nbsp;mi (195&nbsp;km) south of Galveston, Texas.\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (1:00&nbsp;p.m. CDT) – Tropical Storm Allison attains peak winds of 60&nbsp;mph (95&nbsp;km/h) roughly 30&nbsp;mi (50&nbsp;km) south of Freeport, Texas.\n*2100&nbsp;UTC (4:00&nbsp;p.m. CDT) – Tropical Storm Allison makes landfall near Freeport, Texas, with winds of 50&nbsp;mph (85&nbsp;km/h).\nJune&nbsp;6\n*06:00&nbsp;UTC (1:00&nbsp;a.m. CDT) – Tropical Storm Allison weakens to a tropical depression approximately 25&nbsp;mi (40&nbsp;km) northeast of Houston, Texas.\nJune&nbsp;10\n*00:00&nbsp;UTC (7:00&nbsp;p.m. CDT, June&nbsp;9) – Tropical Depression Allison transitions into a subtropical depression about 25&nbsp;mi (40&nbsp;km) south-southeast of Freeport, Texas.\nJune&nbsp;11\n*02:00&nbsp;UTC (9:00&nbsp;p.m. CDT, June&nbsp;10) – Subtropical Depression Allison makes a second and final landfall near Morgan City, Louisiana, with winds of 35&nbsp;mph (55&nbsp;km/h).\n*06:00&nbsp;UTC (1:00&nbsp;a.m. CDT) – Subtropical Depression Allison intensifies into a subtropical storm roughly 25&nbsp;mi (40&nbsp;km) west of New Orleans, Louisiana.\n*12:00&nbsp;UTC (7:00&nbsp;a.m. CDT) – Subtropical Storm Allison attains a minimum barometric pressure of 1000&nbsp;mbar (hPa;
