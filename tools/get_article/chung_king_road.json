      "text": "# Chung King Road\n\nChung King Road, along with Chung King Court containing a water fountain in its center, is a pedestrian street complex in the northwest corner of Chinatown, Los Angeles, United States. This street is a part of \"New Chinatown\", built in the 1930s and 1940s, and was the location of mostly Chinese specialty shops, importers of Chinese art objects, and Chinese benevolent associations. In the late 1990s many of the storefronts were sitting unused, and several of them were converted into art galleries and art studios. With its nearly weekly schedule of art gallery exhibition openings, Chung King Road is now one of the centers of art and nightlife in Downtown Los Angeles. Annual events include Chinese New Year and the Golden Dragon Parade, The Moon Festival, KCRW's Chinatown Summer Nights, the closing party of LA's Design Week and the Perform! Now! Festival.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://la.curbed.com/archives/2009/06/ask_curbed_where_do_the_architects_live.php Curbed LA- Where do Architects Live?]\n* [http://www.latimes.com/features/la-hm-jeevanjee31-2009jan31,0,3343459.story LA Times - Courtyard home in L.A.'s Chinatown]\n* [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=travel&res=9E01E7D61F3CF930A35755C0A9679C8B63 NY Times - OUT THERE: Chinatown Reborn As a Bohemian Outpost]"
