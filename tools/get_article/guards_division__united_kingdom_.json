The division served on the Western Front for the duration of the First World War. The division's insignia was the \"All Seeing Eye\".\nThere was also a Guards Division in the Second World War which was formed on 12 June 1945 from the Guards Armoured Division which had undergone reorganisation.\nHistory\nFirst World War\nFormation\nIn July 1915, during the First World War (1914&ndash;1918), George V approved the formation of a Guards Division and in August 1915 the division was formed at Lumbres, near St Omer, France.\nThe 4th (Guards) Brigade was transferred complete from the 2nd Division and redesignated as the 1st Guards Brigade; the 2nd Guards Brigade was formed with two battalions from England and two more transferred from 1st (Guards) Brigade, 1st Division; and the 3rd Guards Brigade likewise with two more battalions from England and two transferred from 20th Brigade, of the 7th Division. Soon after formation, each brigade formed a machine gun (M.G.) company of 16 machine guns, and between March and May 1916 each brigade was also provided with a Trench Mortar (T.M.) Battery of eight 3\" Stokes Mortars.\nThe division was provided with three artillery brigades When grouped together they formed brigades, in the same way that infantry battalions or cavalry regiments were grouped together in brigades. At the outbreak of the First World War, a field artillery brigade of headquarters (4 officers, 37 other ranks), three batteries (5 and 193 each), and a brigade ammunition column (4 and 154) had a total strength just under 800 so was broadly comparable to an infantry battalion (just over 1,000) or a cavalry regiment (about 550). Like an infantry battalion, an artillery brigade was usually commanded by a lieutenant colonel. These figures refer to brigades of three 6-gun batteries; artillery brigades of Kitchener's Army were reorganized on a four 4-gun basis in January and February 1915, so strengths would be approximately unchanged. Artillery brigades were redesignated as regiments in 1938.}}LXXIV, LXXV and LXXVI Brigades, RFA each of four batteries of four 18 pounder gunsfrom the 16th (Irish) Division and a howitzer brigadeLXI (Howitzer) Brigade, RFA of four batteries of four 4.5\" howitzersfrom the 11th (Northern) Division which remained in England when the division was posted to Gallipoli.  16th (Irish) Division also provided the Divisional Ammunition Column, two field companies of Royal Engineers and the signal company (Royal Engineer Signals Service).  The third field company joined from 7th Division. The pioneers were the 4th Battalion, Coldstream Guards which joined from England on 18 August.\nWar service\nIn 1915, the Guards Division took part in the Battle of Loos (26 September8 October) and Hohenzollern Redoubt (1819 October).\nIn 1916, it fought in the later stages of the Battle of the Somme, in particular the Battle of Flers–Courcelette (1516 and 2022 September), the Battle of Morval (2528 September), and the Capture of Lesboeufs (25 September).\nIn 1917, it saw action in the Battle of Passchendaele (or the Third Battle of Ypres) including the Battle of Pilckem Ridge (31 August2 July), the Battle of Poelcappelle (9 October), and the First Battle of Passchendaele (12 October). It then took part in the Battle of Cambrai (24 November3 December).\nperched on a wrecked gun outside a German concrete blockhouse on the outskirts of Houthulst Forest, Belgium, 9 October 1917.]]\nIn February 1918, British divisions on the Western Front were reduced from a 12-battalion to a 9-battalion basis (brigades from four to three battalions). As a result, the 4th Guards Brigade was formed on 8 February 1918 by taking a battalion from each of the brigades:\n* 3rd Battalion, Coldstream Guards from 1st Guards Brigade\n* 2nd Battalion, Irish Guards from the 2nd Guards Brigade and\n* 4th Battalion, Grenadier Guards from the 3rd Guards Brigade.\nThe 4th Guards Brigade was transferred to the 31st Division at noon on the same day.  On 25 February, the pioneer battalion4th Battalion, Coldstream Guards was reorganized from a four-company to a three-company basis.\nis seen receiving the flag, 14 November 1918.]]\n1918 saw the return of the war of movement. It had to withstand the German Army's Spring Offensive in the\nFirst Battles of the Somme (125 March) then switched over to counter-attack in the Second Battles of the Somme (2123 August), the Second Battle of Arras (26 August3 September), the Battles of the Hindenburg Line (12 September12 October), and in the Final Advance in Picardy including the battles of the Selle and of the Sambre.  Its final action was the Capture of Maubeuge on 9 November.  It ended the war with VI Corps in the British Third Army.\nPost-war\nAt the Armistice of 11 November 1918, the division was in and around Maubeuge, and on 17 November it regained 4th Guards Brigade which was broken up and the battalions returned to their original brigades. The next day it began the march on Germany and crossed the frontier on 11 December. By 19 December it had reached the Cologne area. Units started returning to England on 20 February 1919 and the last had completed the move by 29 April.\nSecond World War\nThe Guards Division was reformed during the Second World War on 12 June 1945 by the reorganization and redesignation of the Guards Armoured Division. The division retained all of its original units, but with some changes:\n* 5th Guards Armoured Brigade (three armoured battalions and one motorized infantry battalion) was converted to infantry as 5th Guards Brigade\n* 32nd Guards Infantry Brigade remained unchanged except that 2nd Battalion, Welsh Guards (originally the reconnaissance unit of the Guards Armoured Division) was converted to infantry and joined the brigade\n* 2nd Household Cavalry Regiment was transferred from XXX Corps on 12 June 1945 as the new reconnaissance unit\n* 6th Guards Tank Brigade (three tank battalions) was converted to infantry as 6th Guards Brigade and joined the division on 19 June\n* 92nd (5th London) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery joined the division on 12 June from 5th Infantry Division as the third field artillery regiment to match three infantry brigades\nMajor-General Sir Allan Adair remained in command of the reorganized division. In January 1947, the division was disbanded.\nOrders of battle\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible\" style=\"width:100%; background:transparent;\"\n!colspan=3 | Orders of Battle – August 1915, November 1918, June 1945\n|-\n|colspan=3 |\n;On formation, August 1915}}\n**LXXIV Brigade Ammunition Column\n* LXXV Brigade, RFA\n**A, B, C and D Batteries\n**LXXV Brigade Ammunition Column\n* LXXVI Brigade, RFA\n**A, B, C and D Batteries\n**LXXVI Brigade Ammunition Column\n* LXI (Howitzer) Brigade, RFA\n**A (H), B (H), C (H) and D (H) Batteries\n**LXI (H) Brigade Ammunition Column\n* Divisional Ammunition Column\n|rowspan=3 | Mounted Troops\n* Household Cavalry Division Squadron\n* Household Cavalry Cyclist Company\nRoyal Engineers\n* 55th, 75th and 76th Field Companies\n* Guards Divisional Signal Company\nPioneers\n* 4th Battalion, Coldstream Guards\nMedical\n* 3rd, 4th and 9th Field Ambulances, RAMC\n* 46th Mobile Veterinary Section, AVC\nGuards Divisional Train, ASC\n* 11th, 124th, 168th and 436th Companies\n|- valign=top\n| 2nd Guards Brigade\n* 3rd Battalion, Grenadier Guards\n* 1st Battalion, Coldstream Guards\n* 1st Battalion, Scots Guards\n* 2nd Battalion, Irish Guards\n*\n|- valign=top\n| 3rd Guards Brigade\n* 1st Battalion, Grenadier Guards\n* 4th Battalion, Grenadier Guards\n* 2nd Battalion, Scots Guards\n* 1st Battalion, Welsh Guards\n* 3rd Guards Brigade M.G.
