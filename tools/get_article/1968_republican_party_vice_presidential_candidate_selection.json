After winning the Republican presidential nomination at the 1968 Republican National Convention, former Vice President Richard Nixon convened a series of meetings with close advisers and party leaders such as Strom Thurmond in order to choose his running mate. Nixon ultimately asked the convention to nominate Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew as his running mate. By a large margin, Agnew won the vice presidential nomination on the first ballot over Michigan Governor George W. Romney, who was supported by a faction of liberal Republicans. Nixon chose Agnew because he wanted a centrist who was broadly acceptable to the party, had experience with domestic issues, and appealed to Southern voters (to counter the third party candidacy of former Alabama Governor George Wallace). The Nixon–Agnew ticket defeated the Humphrey–Muskie ticket, and also won re-election in 1972, defeating the McGovern–Shriver ticket. However, Agnew was forced to resign as vice president in 1973 due to a controversy regarding his personal taxes.\nDespite being his running mate in 1960, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. was not considered as a potential running mate for Nixon in 1968.\nPotential running mates\nFinalists\nFile:Spiro Agnew.jpg|alt=|\nFile:John Volpe 1972 (cropped).jpg|\nFile:Robert Finch, 1967.jpg|\nFile:RogersClarkBallardMorton (cropped).jpg|\nPotential\nFile:George H.
