He was the elder son of Edward Fawcett, an equerry to the Prince of Wales (King Edward VII) and the older brother of explorer Percy Fawcett. He was educated at Newton Abbot College in Devon and was a Queen's Scholar at Westminster School from 1880.\nFawcett converted to Buddhism, having taken the pansil (the lay follower vow to the Five Precepts) while with Henry Steel Olcott in Ceylon (modern Sri Lanka) in January 1890. He was an associate of Russian occultist Helena Blavatsky, leading theoretician of the esoteric religious movement Theosophy.  He assisted her in her writing and in compiling quotations from scientific works for The Secret Doctrine and particularly the parts of second volume on the topic of evolutionary hypotheses. Fawcett joined the editorial staff of The Theosophist, the monthly journal of the Theosophical Society and wrote correspondence for the magazine Lucifer.\nAs a science fiction author, Fawcett published his first fantasy novel Hartmann the Anarchist in 1893. He published two adventure novels in the 1890s.  His 1894 novel Swallowed by an Earthquake drew favourable comparisons in London to the works of Jules Verne.\nHe also authored multiple books on philosophy, including The Riddle of the Universe in 1893 on the metaphysical concept of Monadology. In the preface to his 1909 essay, The Individual and Reality, Fawcett concedes to having abandoned Monadology in favour of the metaphysical philosophies of Idealism\nFawcett married his cousin, Mary Blanche Violet Jackson (1872-1928) in 1896, and they lived principally in Switzerland for many years.\nFawcett devoted his life to mountaineering and philosophy. During this time, his philosophy centered around the idea that imagination was the fundamental reality of the universe. Fawcett and his wife became the first people to ascend the Mer de Glace by automobile in 1909.\nFawcett returned to England and in 1947, he married his second wife, Vera Sibyl Elise Dick-Cunyngham, nee Pryce, widow of George Dick-Cunyngham.
