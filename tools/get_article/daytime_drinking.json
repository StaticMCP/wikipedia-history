But when he gets there, he finds that not only have none of them showed up, but the tiny seaside town is shuttered - no shops are open, no tourists are around, the beach is freezing, and there's no cell phone signal. Unable (and reluctant) to return to Seoul, he finds himself in the company of some very unusual locals and, subject to the rigid rules of Korean drinking culture, on an increasingly strange odyssey nursing a never-ending hangover.\nUshering in a new era of independent filmmaking in South Korea, Daytime Drinking is a comedy in the spirit of Stranger Than Paradise and Sideways, but with a distinctly Korean twist.\nCast\n* Song Sam-dong as Hyeok-jin\n* Yuk Sang-yeop as Gi-sang\n* Kim Gang-hui as Next-door woman\n* Lee Ran-hui as Ran-hui\n* Shin Un-seop\n* Tak Seong-jun\nFestivals\n* Jeonju International Film Festival 2008\n* Locarno International Film Festival 2008\n* Toronto International Film Festival 2008\n* Vessoul Asian Film Festival 2009\n* Asian Hot Shots Berlin 2009\n* International Film Festival Rotterdam 2009\n* SXSW Film Festival 2009\n* Maryland Film Festival 2009\n* Hong Kong International Film Festival 2009\n* Wisconsin Film Festival 2009\n* Singapore International Film Festival 2009\n* Fantasia Festival 2009\n* Seattle International Film Festival 2009\nAwards\n* JJ-Star Award / Audience Critics' Award - Jeonju International Film Festival 2008\n* Special Mention of the Jury / NETPAC Award - Locarno International Film Festival 2008\n* INALCO Jury Award - Vessoul Asian Film Festival 2009\nInternational releases\nThe film was picked up for general release in the United Kingdom by Inclusionism Films in 2011.
