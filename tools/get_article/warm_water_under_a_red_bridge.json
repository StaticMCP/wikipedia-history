This was Imamura's last feature film. It was entered into the 2001 Cannes Film Festival. Warm Water Under A Red Bridge focuses on the troubles of a Japanese \"everyman\" who finds a new life with an unusual woman in a small fishing village. Imamura's last film contains considerable commentary on the search for happiness.\nPlot\nYosuke is a salaryman who has been laid off from his job at an architectural firm in Tokyo and is undergoing marital difficulties.  When his old friend dies, he travels to the small fishing town of Himi, Toyama to find a treasure that the old man had hidden in a house there decades before. He does not find what he expects, but takes a job with local fishermen and becomes romantically involved with a woman with an exaggerated proclivity towards female ejaculation.\nCast\n* Kōji Yakusho as Yosuke Sasano\n* Misa Shimizu as Saeko Aizawa\n* Mitsuko Baisho as Mitsu Aizawa\n* Mansaku Fuwa as Gen\n* Isao Natsuyagi as Masayuki Uomi\n* Yukiya Kitamura as Shintaro Uomi\n* Hijiri Kojima as Mika Tagami\n* Toshie Negishi as Tomoko Sasano\n* Sumiko Sakamoto as Masako Yamada\n* Gadarukanaru Taka as Taizo Tachibana\n* Mickey Curtis as Nobuyuki Ohnishi\n* Takao Yamada as Kazuo Namamura\n* Katsuo Nakamura as Takao Yamada\n* Kazuo Kitamura as Taro\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://rottentomatoes.com/m/warm_water_under_a_red_bridge/ Warm Water Under a Red Bridge] at Rotten Tomatoes\n* Mes, Tom.
