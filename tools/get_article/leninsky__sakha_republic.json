As of the 2010 Census, its population was&nbsp;1,866.\nHistory\nIt was founded in 1926 as a gold-mining base and was known as Nizhne-Stalinsk () until 1962. The name referred to Joseph Stalin, with the \"Nizhne-\" part meaning lower, to differentiate it from the now disappeared settlements of Sredne-Stalinsk and Verkhne-Stalinsk further upstream. Urban-type settlement status was granted to it in 1932.\nAdministrative and municipal status\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, the urban-type settlement of Leninsky is, together with one rural locality (the selo of Yakokut), incorporated within Aldansky District as the Settlement of Leninsky. As a municipal division, the territories of the Settlement of Leninsky and the Settlement of Lebediny are incorporated within Aldansky Municipal District as Leninsky Urban Settlement.\nEconomy\nGold mining in Leninsky stopped in 1998.\nThe Amur–Yakutsk Mainline railway passes nearby, as does the A360 Lena Highway to Yakutsk.\nReferences\nNotes\nSources\n*Official website of the Sakha Republic.
