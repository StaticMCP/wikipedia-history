It is the third  volume in his extensive Dray Prescot series of sword and planet novels, set on the fictional world of Kregen, a planet of the Antares star system in the constellation of Scorpio. It was first published by DAW Books in 1973.\nThe Dray Prescot series is made of several cycles of novels, each cycle essentially forming a series within the series. In addition to being the third volume in the series as a whole, Warrior of Scorpio is also the third volume in the Delian Cycle and, like the second volume, is set on the fictional continent of Turismond and the Mediterranean Sea-like Eye of the World.\nThe 52 completed novels of the Dray Prescot series were written by Bulmer between 1972 and 1997, when a stroke stopped his writing, also the later Dray Prescot books, after 1988, were originally only published in German. The series is in the spirit of Edgar Rice Burroughs John Carter of Mars series.\nPlot summary\nThe events of the book follow on directly from The Suns of Scorpio when Dray Prescot was taken away in the decisive moment of the slave uprising against the Overlords of Magdag. He resists the feared teleportation back to Earth but finds himself instead in a different location on Kregen. He makes the acquaintance of Seg Segutorio, a bowman from the continent of Loh, thereby beginning a life-long friendship. Seg works at the time as slave at a farm in the region of Proconia, in the east of the Eye of the World. Moments later the farm is attacked by semi-human, lizard-like Sorzart warriors which Prescot takes as the reason for him having been sent there rather than returned to Earth after he, as he presumes, failed to fulfil the Star Lords plans correctly in Magdag. Prescot manages to save the female owner of the farm, her child and Seg from the raiders.\nAfter taking the women and child to safety and being incarcerated Seg and Prescot escape in a small boat. Attempts to head for Sanurkazz are thwarted by sudden storms, making it clear to Prescot that the Star Lords do not wish for him to go there. He learns that Seg was captured and enslaved after fighting for Pattelonia, the chief city of Proconia and ally of Sanurkazz as a mercenary. On the way the two come to a merchant ship from Pattelonia, damaged by storm and attacked by a galley from Magdag. Prescot uses the confusion of the battle to liberate the galley slaves and attack the crew of the galley. Heavily outnumbered the crew is defeated but Prescot learns that the sinking merchant ship has Delia trapped on board. He succeeds in rescuing her and learns that she has been heading for Magdag to find him. Once more he now tries, with Seg, Delia and one of her ladies-in-waiting, Thelda, to head for Sanurkazz but once again a sudden storm forces him eastwards, to Pattelonia.\nIn Pattelonia, Prescot meets his friend and fellow Kroziar, Pur Zenkiren, who wishes him to lead the army in the east against the forces of Magdag but Prescot explains that he is physically prevented from doing so. Instead, Prescot, Delia, Seg and Thelda head to a secret location where Delia had the flying boat, called a voller, hidden away after she arrived from Vallia in it.

In the city they rescue one of the fabled Wizards of Loh instead, Lu-si-Yuong, and Prescot reluctantly leaves after learning that Delia was not there. Returning to Hiclantung, Prescot and Seg are forced to rescue Thelda from the queen.\nDray Prescot agrees to march with the queen's army against the Ullars and their allies, the city of Harfnar.
