It teaches the principles of modern software engineering, together with the tools, methods, and techniques that support their application. The current Director of Software Engineering Programme is Professor Jim Davies\nHistory\nThe Programme has its origins in the industrial courses presented by the Computing Laboratory—the computing science department of the University of Oxford—during the 1980s.\nCourses\nThe Programme offer a variety of courses, each addressing a different aspect of software engineering, which are organized into three themes, namely:\n# Software Engineering Methods\n#Software Engineering Tools\n#Software and System Security.\nAwards\nThe courses offered by the Programme may be used as credit towards a master's degree (MSc) from University of Oxford. There are two Masters' awards available: the MSc in Software Engineering, and the specialised MSc in Software and Systems Security. Both awards require the successful completion of 10 courses, together with a Masters'-level project and dissertation.\nPeople\nMost of the courses are taught by University lecturers, with assistance from dedicated teams of researchers and administrators.
