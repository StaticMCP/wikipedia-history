It runs from 29 to 33 Donegall Place to 32 Fountain Street.\nHistory\nThe arcade and the building above it were designed by James McKinnon in 1880, for developer George Fisher.\nIn 1919 it was acquired by Frederick W. Henry, who operated the adjacent Carlton Cafe & Restaurant at 25-27 Donegall Place.\nIn the 1930s, Hobart & Heron Architects carried out alterations for then resident Austin Reed Ltd. The monogram \"AR\", in reference to the company, is still visible today on the third floor of the Donegall Place façade. The same architects carried out further works in 1937, following fire damage. The architectural firm still exists today as Hobart Heron.\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, the arcade was owned by Prudential Portfolio Managers Ltd. In 1987 they refurbished the building façades and installed canopies over the Donegall Place and Fountain Street entrances. They carried out further refurbishment works during 1994.\nThe building gained Grade B1 listed status in June 1993.\nIn August 2002, John H. Lunn (Jewellers) Ltd, trading as Lunn's Jewellers acquired Queen's Arcade and the adjacent building at 25-27 Donegall Place. The company had been started in the arcade nearly 50 years beforehand.\nIn September 2024, Lunn's announced that they would be expanding into the building that formerly housed Carlton Cafe and most recently Oasis.\nGallery\nSee also\n* Architecture of Belfast\n* North Street Arcade\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.queensarcadebelfast.com/ Official web site]\n* [http://www.futurebelfast.com/property/queens-arcade/ Queen's Arcade on Future Belfast]"
