His first broadcasting job was in the late 1960s with KMSC radio (now KMJQ) in the Houston suburb of Clear Lake City, Texas. He later moved to KTRH, where he hosted a nighttime call-in show. While in Houston, he also worked at CBS television affiliate KHOU-TV, where he was a news anchor and hosted shows.

While at the station, he served as its entertainment editor and as a weatherman. He also worked on The Baxters, an experimental sitcom produced by Norman Lear, and was lead host on the variety show On Stage America.\nEdwards appeared as a correspondent Entertainment Tonight for one season, and moved to KABC-TV in 1984. At KABC-TV, he hosted A.M. Los Angeles, first with Cristina Ferrare followed by Tawny Little, along with Hollywood Closeup and an afternoon show, 3:30. Edwards also hosted  talk radio programs for then-radio sister station KABC-AM, with both the Steve Edwards Show and Sports Talk.\nEdwards returned to local television in 1993, when he began hosting Live in L.A., an infotainment program on KCAL-TV, before becoming an anchor and host of Fox-owned KTTV's Good Day L.A. in 1995.\nThrough the years Edwards has been the host of many unsold pilots including game shows, variety shows and talk shows.  Three game show pilots featuring Edwards as host included Get Rich Quick! in 1977 for Bob Stewart and ABC, Pandemonium in 1979 for Jay Wolpert and CBS, and a 1990 pilot of a potential syndication run of the mid-80s NBC game show Scrabble.  Neither of these three pilots were picked up.\nAwards and honors\nEdwards has received the Governor's Award from the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20171026111150/http://www.foxla.com/about-us/anchors-and-reporters/steve-edwards Steve Edwards' FoxLA bio at Internet Wayback Machine]\n*"
