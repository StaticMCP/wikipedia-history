      "text": "# Vice President of Ghana\n\n[http://www.presidency.gov.gh Presidency.gov.gh] [http://www.ghana.gov.gh Ghana.gov.gh]\n}}\nThe vice president of Ghana is the second-highest officer in the Government of Ghana. The vice president, together with the president of Ghana, is directly elected by the people through popular vote to serve a four-year term in office. The vice-president is the first person in the presidential line of succession, and would ascend to the presidency upon the death, resignation, or removal of the president. The current vice-president is Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang, who took office on 7 January 2025, under President John Mahama. She is the first female vice president in Ghana's history.\nEligibility\nThe provisions of article 62 of the 1992 Constitution apply to a candidate for election as vice-president. The candidate must be:\n*(a) a citizen of Ghana by birth\n*(b) attained the age of thirty-five years or above\n*(c) be otherwise qualified to be elected a Member of Parliament, except that the disqualifications set out in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of clause (2) of article 94 of this Constitution shall not be removed, in respect of any such person, by a presidential pardon or by the lapse of time as provided for in clause (5) of that article.\nThe president and vice president are elected on a single ticket; all presidential candidates must lodge the name of their running mate when filing for election.\nIf the president dies, resigns, or is permanently incapacitated, the vice-president automatically ascends as president for the balance of the term. A vice-president who ascends to the presidency before half of the presidential term expires is only allowed to run for a single full term. If more than half of the term has expired, he can run for two terms, whether successive or separated.\nThis provision has been used once, when John Mahama ascended to the presidency after the death of the president, John Atta Mills, in July 2012. He was elected president in his own right that December, and was allowed to run for reelection in 2016 since he had ascended with only six months remaining in Mills' term.\nOath of office\nThe vice-president of Ghana must be sworn in by the chief justice before the citizens of Ghana at Independence Square in Accra. The vice-president-elect must repeat the following:\n\"I,(name) having been elected to the office of Vice-President of the Republic of Ghana, do (in the name of the Almighty God swear) (solemnly affirm) that I will be faithful and true to the Republic of Ghana; that I will at all times preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the Republic of Ghana; and I dedicate myself to the service and well-being of the people of the Republic of Ghana and to do right to all manner of persons.\nI further (solemnly swear) (solemnly affirm) that should I at any time break this oath of office, I shall submit myself to the laws of the Republic of Ghana and suffer the penalty for it. (So help me God).\"\nDuties\nThe duties of the vice-president of Ghana are:\n* presiding over various meetings in the absence of the president\n* acting president when the president is out of the country\nThe vice-president is also a member of\n* The National Security Council\n* The Armed Forces Council\n* The Police Service Council\n* The Prisons Service Council\nList of vice-presidents of Ghana (1979–present)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%;text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Portrait\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Name\n! colspan=\"3\" |Term of office\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Political party\n! rowspan=\"2\" |President\n|-\n!Took office\n!Left office\n!Time in office\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white\" | 1\n|\n| Joseph W.S. de Graft-Johnson\n|  1979\n|  1981\n|\n| People's National Party\n| Hilla Limann\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white\" | 2\n|\n| Kow Nkensen Arkaah\n|  1993\n|  1997\n|  years\n| National Convention Party\n| rowspan=2|Jerry Rawlings\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white\" | 3\n|\n| John Atta Mills\n|  1997\n|  2001\n|  years\n| National Democratic Congress\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white\" | 4\n|\n| Aliu Mahama\n|  2001\n|  2009\n|  years\n| New Patriotic Party\n| John Kufuor\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white\" | 5\n|\n| John Mahama\n|  2009\n|  2012\n|\n| National Democratic Congress\n| John Atta Mills\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white\" | 6\n|\n| Kwesi Amissah-Arthur\n|  2012\n|  2017\n|\n| National Democratic Congress\n| John Mahama\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white\" | 7\n|\n| Mahamudu Bawumia\n|  2017\n|  2025\n|  years\n| New Patriotic Party\n| Nana Akufo-Addo\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white;\" | 8\n|\n| Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang\n|  2025\n| Incumbent\n|\n| National Democratic Congress\n|John Mahama\n|}\nVice presidents by time in office\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; border:1px #AAAAFF solid\"\n|-\n!Rank\n!Vice president\n!Political party\n!Total time in office\n!Cause of end of term\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|1\n|Aliu Mahama\n|New Patriotic Party\n|\n|Natural expiration\n|-\n|Mahamudu Bawumia\n|New Patriotic Party\n|\n|Natural expiration\n|-\n!3\n|Kwesi Amissah-Arthur\n|National Democratic Congress\n|\n|Natural expiration\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|4\n|Kow Nkensen Arkaah\n|National Convention Party\n|\n|Natural expiration\n|-\n|John Atta Mills\n|National Democratic Congress\n|\n|Natural expiration\n|-\n!6\n|John Mahama\n|National Democratic Congress\n|\n|Death of John Atta Mills\n|-\n!7\n|Joseph de Graft-Johnson\n|People's National Party\n|\n|Deposed\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"lightgreen\"\n!8\n|Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang\n|National Democratic Congress\n|\n|In office\n|}\nDemographics\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
