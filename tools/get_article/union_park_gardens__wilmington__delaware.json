The term \"Union Park\" comes from the name of the amusement park once located on the site of the neighborhood. \"The Gardens\" name originates from the English Garden Suburb movement of the late 19th Century. \"A curved parkway, open spaces, a variety of architectural styles and materials, and the garden-like setting were essential in creating the warm, inviting atmosphere which remains to this day.\"\nOn February 27, 1922, the Emergency Fleet Corporation \"received $1,573,231 for Union Park Gardens, Wilmington, Del., which was sold recently by the Gerth's Realty Experts,\" according to an article in the New-York Tribune. \"The property sale consisted of all 503 houses, four stores, one store and apartment, one six-family apartment house, one brick building with one store and one apartment and two tracts of ground.\" The average house sold for $3,000 each.\nUnion Park Gardens Historic Marker.\nStreet layout of Union Park Gardens in Wilmington, Delaware.\nWorld War II\nSeven Union Park Garden residents were killed in action during World War II while serving in the United States military.
