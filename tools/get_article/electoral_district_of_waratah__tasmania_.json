It centred on the town of Waratah in western Tasmania.\nThe seat was created in a redistribution ahead of the 1897 election from the southern part of the Wellington electorate, which had been a two-member seat until the election. The seat was abolished when the Tasmanian parliament adopted the Hare-Clark electoral model in 1909. Its final member, John Earle, successfully stood for the multi-member seat of Franklin and, shortly after the 1909 election, became Tasmania's the first Labor premier, albeit of an unstable minority government which lasted a week. He regained the Premiership in 1914 and held it for two years, before gaining a seat in the Australian Senate.\nMembers for Waratah\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Member!!Party!!Term\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| Charles Hall\n| &nbsp;\n| 1897–1903\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| George Gilmore\n| &nbsp;\n| 1903–1906\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| John Earle\n| Labour\n| 1906–1909\n|}\nReferences\n*\n*\n* Parliament of Tasmania (2006).
