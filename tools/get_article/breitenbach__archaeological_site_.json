The occupations date to the early Upper Palaeolithic and more specifically belong to the Aurignacian cultural complex. Breitenbach is currently the biggest open-air settlement site in western Eurasia dating to this time period. Overlying the Palaleolithic deposits are the remains of a younger settlement that has been dated to the Neolithic.\nPalaeolithic settlement\nSignificance\nThe open-air site Breitenbach is located at the northern boundary of the Aurignacian oikumene, from which only few sites are currently known. It is also one of the few Aurignacian open-air sites known from Central Europe&nbsp;– knowledge about modern human spatial behaviour and subsistence practices during the Aurignacian derives primarily from  cave sites. The extent of the settlement is estimated between 8,000 and 10,000&nbsp;square meters&nbsp;– this is very unusual for this period and foreshadows the large open-air settlements of the Gravettian known from eastern Europe. As a late representative of the Aurignacian, Breitenbach is of supra-regional interest in understanding the dynamics of the Aurignacian-Gravettian transition. It also promises insight to spatial organisation and subsistence practices of hunter-gatherer groups during the time of the initial occurrence of the “complete set” of behaviourally modern characteristics.\nLocation\nThe village Breitenbach is part of Wetterzeube municipality and is located approximately 6&nbsp;km south of the town of Zeitz. The archaeological site near the old cutting mill (“Schneidemühle”) is situated along the eastern bank of the river Aga, a small tributary of the White Elster river. The site is located on the slopes of a gentle promontory that, coming from a north-westerly direction peters out in a south-easterly direction.\nDiscovery and excavations\nThe site was discovered in the spring of 1925 by the local school teacher E. Thiersch. In the process of extending an existing storage yard adjacent to the mill, large numbers of bones had already been discovered and discarded since the autumn of 1924. First sondages by H. Hess von Wichdorff and A. Götze took place in 1925 and large scale archaeological excavations exposing 400&nbsp;square meters were conducted by N. Niklasson and F. Wiegers in 1927. Unusual for the time, Niklasson and Wiegers employed a grid system, which allows for a reconstruction of the horizontal find distribution. A smaller geological sondage took place in 1962, followed by a small archaeological campaign in 2004. Since 2009 a collaborative effort headed by the MONREPOS Archaeological Research Center and Museum for Human Behavioral Evolution of the Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum Mainz, the State Office for Heritage Management and Archaeology of Saxony-Anhalt and Leiden University has resumed large scale excavations.\nChronometric dates\nSeveral 14C dates (AMS) place the occupations at Breitenbach between 23,990±180 (OxA-11964) and 28,380±170 (OxA-11889) years ago. Using the calpal software, these dates translate into 26,883±401 to 30,824±338 calendar years ago. This renders Breitenbach a very late representative of the Aurignacian tradition, as the Gravettian is well represented in Central and Eastern Europe at this time (see above).\nSite organization and structures\nAt Breitenbach there is evidence for spatially differentiated activity zones, with foci of specific activities. This is suggested by the presence of large stone manuports, imported and intentionally arranged sandstone slabs, pits and hearths. The sandstone slabs in particular hint at repeated longer-term occupations. Four high-lithic concentrations were tentatively labelled as “lithic workshops”. Burned bone and lithics occur in large numbers. The find horizon is well-pronounced and appears quite distinct from the over/underlying layers. These characteristics suggest a repeated, more permanent settlement behaviour that hitherto was only known from the Gravettian.\nFinds\nAurignacian artefact production is characterised by an increasing inclusion of bone and antler as raw materials and also the production of non-utilitarian objects. The Breitenbach lithic inventory (n=737) is made exclusively of Baltic flint and shows a high prevalence of keeled, simple and nosed scrapers, as well as various types of burins. In addition to the lithic implements a small number of worked bone tools, as well as non-utilitarian objects in the form of several perforated Arctic fox canines, an incised rib fragment and a piece of worked ivory have also been described.\nFaunal remains\nSince well-preserved faunal remains from Aurignacian open-air sites are rare, the relatively good preservation of the faunal materials is noteworthy. Together with the open-air site Lommersum, Breitenbach is the only Aurignacian open-air site in northern Central Europe known to have a faunal inventory. The Breitenbach faunal remains have to date only been partially described and are currently undergoing more detailed analysis. The site is primarily known for its mammoth remains, which initially alerted Thiersch to the presence of an archaeological site. Also occurring in numbers at the site are the remains of horse, reindeer and to a lesser extent those of woolly rhino, hyena, wolf, lion, Arctic fox and Arctic hare.\nNeolithic settlement\nA Neolithic settlement, belonging to the Linear Pottery Culture (c. between 7.500–5.500&nbsp;years ago) overlying the Palaeolithic layer was first recognized during geological sondages by Hess von Wichdorff in 1927(3). He noted surface finds and the outlines of several living structures. During the course of the investigation, large numbers of pottery shards and several lithic axes were recovered. The Neolithic settlement is currently excavated by the State Office for Heritage Management and Archaeology Saxony-Anhalt.\nLiterature\n*Groiß, J.T. 1987.
