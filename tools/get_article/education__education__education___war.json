It was produced by Ben H. Allen III, and is the first Kaiser Chiefs album recorded with new drummer Vijay Mistry, formerly of fellow leeds band and opening act Club Smith.  The album's name is partly a reference to a line in a famous 1996 speech by Tony Blair where he emphasised the importance of education, and partly referencing the controversial Iraqi war in which he involved the UK.\nProduction and release\nEducation, Education, Education & War is the first album featuring the new Kaiser Chiefs drummer, Vijay Mistry, formerly of Club Smith, after Nick Hodgson left the group in December 2012. Three songs were co-written with Fraser T Smith (known for his work with Adele and Sam Smith) and the album was produced by Ben H. Allen III (who has previously worked with Gnarls Barkley, Animal Collective, and Deerhunter), and recorded at The Maze Studio in Atlanta. It was mixed by Michael Brauer (My Morning Jacket, Coldplay) at Electric Lady Studios in New York City in November 2013.\nThe album was released in the United Kingdom on 31 March 2014 through Fiction Records/Caroline International/Universal Music as a standard CD, LP (with a bonus 7\" single), and digital download. In the United States, it was released on 1 April 2014 through ATO Records. On 6 January 2014, the album became available for pre-order on iTunes, with a free download of the song \"Bows & Arrows\".\nPromotion\nOn 5 December 2013, Kaiser Chiefs released a song titled \"Misery Company\" onto their SoundCloud account. The song had previously been performed live during the band's 2013 summer tour.\nOn 3 January 2014, \"Bows & Arrows\" premiered on Rolling Stone magazine's website, and on 6 January 2014, the song was released as a single in France. According to singer Ricky Wilson, it was recorded in a studio under a McDonald's restaurant in Islington, and bassist Simon Rix came up with its title. Wilson said:I liked the idea that bows and arrows are pretty useless on their own but when you get them together, they can be quite formidable. A bit like us lot, really. I love being in a band. It's daft to think you can do it alone. It's about not being afraid of emotion. It can be the strongest weapon we have. What's wrong with a load of blokes admitting they need each other? [It's] a sliver of hope through all the futility and loss on the record. You can also dance to it.On 13 February 2014, the first single for the album was released, titled \"Coming Home\" in the UK.\nOn 19 March 2014, Kaiser Chiefs released a 15-minute video on YouTube which contained 1:30-long clips of each of the ten songs off the album.\nOn 26 May 2014, the second single, \"Meanwhile Up in Heaven\", was released in the UK.\nOn 24 June 2014, the third single, titled \"My Life\", was released in the UK.\nCritical reception\n| rev1 = Aesthetic Magazine\n| rev1Score =\n| rev2 = AllMusic\n| rev2Score =\n| rev3 = Alternative Press\n| rev3Score =\n| rev4 = Clash\n| rev4Score = 5/10\n| rev5 = Consequence of Sound\n| rev5Score = C\n| rev6 = The Guardian\n| rev6Score =\n| rev7 = Mojo\n| rev7Score =\n| rev8 = musicOMH\n| rev8Score =\n| rev9 = PopMatters\n| rev9Score =\n| rev10 = Rolling Stone\n| rev10Score =\n}}\nEducation, Education, Education & War received mixed reviews from music critics.
