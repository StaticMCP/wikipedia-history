He was best known for his 1924 debate with William Jennings Bryan on the topic of biological evolution and serving as a scientific consultant to Clarence Darrow before the 1925 Scopes trial.\nEarly life and education\nEdward Loranus Rice was born in Middletown, Connecticut, March 18, 1871, to William North Rice and Elizabeth Wing (Crowell) Rice. He received his A.B. degree from Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, in 1892. He earned two doctoral degrees, including a Ph.D. in zoology in 1895, at the University of Munich and a Sc.D. in 1927, from Wesleyan University.\nAcademic career\nRice began his 50 consecutive years of teaching as assistant professor at Wesleyan University in 1896. He soon became a professor of biology and geology at Allegheny College 1896-98 before becoming a professor of biology at Ohio Wesleyan University in 1898 and serving until his retirement in 1941. He served as acting president of Ohio Wesleyan University from 1938 to 1939. After his retirement he returned to teaching as a war emergency professor at Ohio Wesleyan from 1942 to 1945. He was visiting professor at Ohio State University Lake Laboratory on Lake Erie at Cedar Point, Sandusky Bay during the summers of 1905, 1906, 1908, 1909, and 1912.\nRice was honored with membership in Phi Beta Kappa society, Sigma Xi, and the Eclectic Society. He elected a fellow of American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) of which he was vice president and chairman of the Biological Sciences Section in 1903. He held memberships in American Society of Naturalists, American Genetic Association, American Association of Anatomists, and American Society of Zoologists. He was a fellow in the Zoology Section, and president of the Ohio Academy of Sciences from 1906 to 1907, and served as secretary from 1912 to 1923.\nLike his father William North Rice, Rice was most noted for his work to reconcile scientific observations with religious faith. At the 1924 meeting of the AAAS, he debated William Jennings Bryan on biological evolution and was a scientific consultant for Clarence Darrow before the 1925 Scopes trial. He is also well known for authoring a textbook, An Introduction to Biology in 1935, and he contributed numerous papers to scientific journals.\nSelected publications\n* Rice, E.L.
