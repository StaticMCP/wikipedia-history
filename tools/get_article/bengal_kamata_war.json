As a result of the conflict the Khen dynasty was overthrown and the Bengal Sultanate extended its domain up to the Hajo in what is present day western Assam by 1502. Nevertheless, the Sultanate administration was removed in about ten years by the Assamese Bhuyans led by Harup Narayan.\nInvasion\nThe conquest was instigated by Sachipatra, a Brahmin whose son was executed by King Nilambar for his promiscuity with the queen. In 1499, Sultan Alauddin Husain Shah dispatched an army under the command of Shah Ismail Ghazi to conquer Kamata. Ghazi's forces besieged the Kamatapur fort and destroyed the city. Hussain Shah imprisoned Nilambar of Kamata and ended the reign of the Khen dynasty. Though Kamatapur fell in 1498, Hussain Shah was able to annex up to Hajo not before 1502.\nAftermath\nThe region was brought under the administration of Sultanate governors in Hajo. Hussain Shah minted coins with the proclamation \"conqueror of Kāmrū, Kamata, Jajnagar and Urisa\". He also publicly inscribed the victory at a stone in Malda. The Sultan appointed his son, Shahzada Danyal, as the governor of the newly conquered region; that reached up to Hajo and intended to expand to Central Assam. Daniyal later fell to the Assamese Bhuyans within Hussein Shah's lifetime and his rule ended.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*"
