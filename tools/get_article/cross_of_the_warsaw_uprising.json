It consisted of a captured German Iron Cross, with a pre-war 1 złoty coin pinned to it in the centre over the swastika; the reverse side of the coin, showing the Polish eagle, was displayed, to which was added a kotwica and the inscription \"1944\". It was awarded for killing an SS officer in combat and made during quieter periods in between the fighting.\nThis cross should not be confused with the Warsaw Uprising Cross (Warszawski Krzyż Powstańczy) established in 1981.\nSee also\n* Warsaw Uprising\n* Home Army\n* Polish resistance movement in World War II\n* Polish contribution to World War II\n* Operation Tempest\n* Wola massacre\n* Ochota massacre\n* Robinson Crusoes of Warsaw\n* Warsaw Insurgents Cemetery\n* Warsaw Uprising Museum\n* Warsaw Uprising Monument\n* Little Insurgent Monument\n* Monument to Victims of the Wola Massacre\nReferences"
