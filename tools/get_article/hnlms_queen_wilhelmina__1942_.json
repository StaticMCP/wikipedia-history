The ship was built in the United States as PC 468 and originally meant to be commissioned into the United States Navy. On 30 April 1942, however, the vessel was gifted by the President of the United States to the Netherlands and soon after named Queen Wilhelmina. It served in the RNLN between 1942 and 1963. In 1963 the Queen Wilhemina was loaned to the Nigerian Navy and named Ogoja. Two years later, in 1965, this loan was turned into a gift.\nDesign and construction\nQueen Wilhelmina was built at George Lawley & Son in the United States. The ship was laid down originally as PC 468 for the United States Navy on 1 January 1942 and belonged as submarine chaser to the PC 461 class. On 30 April 1942 PC 468 was launched and gifted to the Netherlands by the American President Roosevelt. A few months later, on 6 August 1942, the ship was officially handed over to the Royal Netherlands Navy by the American government and commissioned as Queen Wilhelmina. The ceremony at the Washington Navy Yard was attended by many officials, including Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands and President Roosevelt.\nService history\nAfter Queen Wilhelmina was transferred on 6 August 1942 to the Royal Netherlands Navy, it was immediately put under American operational command. The ship was based at Key West and operated during the Second World War in the Caribbean. On 11 October 1942 Queen Wilhelmina arrived at Curaçao and began escorting convoys. As a result of distinguishing itself by successfully escorting several convoys in the West Indies the ship was nicknamed Queen of the Caribbean.\nAfter the end of the Second World War the Queen Wilhelmina patrolled for some time the waters of the Dutch provinces Zeeland and South-Holland to inspect Dutch fishers and prevent Belgian fishers from fishing in Dutch territorial waters.\nIn 1953, the ship was put into reserve.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
