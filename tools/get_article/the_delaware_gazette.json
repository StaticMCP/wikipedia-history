It is owned by AIM Media Midwest.\nThe newspaper is published on weekday and Saturday mornings and is the only daily newspaper in Delaware County, Ohio. The paper's circulation in 2004 was approximately 8,000 daily.\nIn addition to the daily newspaper, the Gazette newsroom also publishes The Sunbury News, a weekly newspaper in nearby Sunbury, Ohio, and provides commercial printing and website management services.\nHistory\nThe Delaware Gazette was founded as a weekly newspaper in 1818, by Abram Thomson and a partner. In 1834, Thomson bought out his partner and from that time until 2004, the newspaper was owned and managed by members of the Thomson family. The Gazette published its first edition as a daily newspaper January 10, 1884.\nIn June 2004, W.D. \"Tom\" Thomson II, the great-great-grandson of Abram Thomson, sold the Gazette to Brown Publishing Company of Cincinnati.  At the time of its sale, the newspaper had been owned by a single family longer than any other newspaper in America.\nAt the time, Thomson family members said they had not been under pressure to sell the newspaper, and chose to sell it to Brown because it, too, was a longstanding family-owned business:\n\"We had a hell of a ride,\" said Gazette vice president Chip Thomson. \"I'm at peace.\"\nBrown declared bankruptcy and was reconstituted as Ohio Community Media in 2010.  The company, including the Gazette, was purchased for an undisclosed sum in 2011 by Philadelphia-based Versa Capital Management.\nIn 2012 Versa merged Ohio Community Media, former Freedom papers it had acquired, Impressions Media, and Heartland Publications into a new company, Civitas Media. Civitas Media sold its Ohio papers to AIM Media Midwest in 2017.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.delgazette.com The Delaware Gazette]\n* [http://www.facebook.com/delawaregazette The Delaware Gazette on Facebook]\n* [https://twitter.com/delgazette The Delaware Gazette on Twitter]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120530000518/http://www.ohcommedia.com/ Ohio Community Media]"
