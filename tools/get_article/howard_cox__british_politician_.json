Cox stood in the 2024 London mayoral election, representing Reform UK. In early 2025, Cox left Reform UK on \"free speech grounds\".\nFairFuelUK\nCox founded the FairFuelUK pressure group in 2010. The campaign claimed to have saved drivers over £200bn in planned tax hikes in duty and VAT. FairFuelUK claims its funding comes from regular donations from supporters and in the past has come from Logistics UK, the Road Haulage Association, the RAC, Association of Pallet Networks, UKLPG and others.\nIn 2022, it was found that Cox, who was at that time part of the \"All-Party Parliamentary Group for Fair Fuel for UK Motorists and UK Hauliers\", was also a director of a company called Ultimum, which markets a fuel additive. Cox denied any conflict of interest. Ultimum Ltd was dissolved in December 2022.\nPolitical career\n2024 London mayoral and Assembly elections\nOn May 10, 2023, Cox announced his candidacy for the 2024 London mayoral election, representing Reform UK. Cox's positions included scrapping the Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) and refunding all fines and fees collected in the 2023 outer expansion of the ULEZ.\nCox finished in 5th place, gathering 3.1% of the total votes.\nAt the concurrent London Assembly election, Cox was Reform's second-placed candidate on the Londonwide list.\nHe was not elected, with top candidate Alex Wilson becoming the party's sole  member in the Assembly.\n2024 general election\nOn 28 May 2024, at Reform UK's campaign launch for the July general election, Cox announced that he would be running in the Dover and Deal constituency.\nHe finished runner up to the successful Labour candidate, Mike Tapp. In total, Cox polled 11,355 votes (23.8%), pushing the Conservatives into third place.\nResignation from Reform UK and subsequent activity\nIn October 2024, Cox was at odds with the party leadership over his support of far-right activist, Tommy Robinson. The disagreements between Cox and Reform came after a rally on 26 October, which was held in response to Robinson being remanded in custody after breaching a court order prohibiting him from spreading false statements about a Syrian refugee.\nRichard Tice, deputy leader of Reform, distanced himself from both Robinson and the supporters, telling GB News that the party \"wants nothing to do with all of that lot\".\nCox, in response, said to broadcaster Dan Wootton: \"This week, unfortunately, Richard … said I want nothing to do with Tommy Robinson or his lot. It’s a bit sad because I’m a good friend of Richard and we are close but that was wrong … I am one of that lot. Nigel actually did contact me privately and he just simply said Richard went over the top.\"\nIn early January 2025, Cox announced that he had left Reform UK.\nIn a subsequent interview, he claimed that a senior member of the party had told him not to mention Tommy Robinson, or risk being expelled from Reform. Expanding on this, Cox said: \"Now there's what I call a dictatorship, and you can quote me on that. I believe Reform UK is a dictatorship, and it doesn't allow people to think.\"\nHe again reiterated his support for Robinson's work in highlighting the Grooming gangs scandal, and described him as a \"political prisoner.\"\nIn April 2025, Cox revealed that he had joined the Integrity Party, a splinter group from Reform, including members such as ex-deputy leader Ben Habib. Habib would go on to launch Advance UK in late June 2025, with Cox subsequently joining the party. In addition to this, he became a member of The College, part of Advance UK's governing body.\nPersonal life\nCox is married and has one child.\nReferences"
