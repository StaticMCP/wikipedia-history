This timeline is for use with the article on environmental determinism.\nFor the history of humanity's influence on the environment, and humanity's perspective on this influence, see timeline of history of environmentalism.\nSee List of periods and events in climate history for a timeline list focused on climate.\nPre-Holocene (1.5 Ma)\nThe time from roughly 15,000 to 5,000 BCE was a time of transition, and swift and extensive environmental change, as the planet was moving from an Ice age, towards an interstadial (warm period). Sea levels rose dramatically (and are continuing to do so), land that was depressed by glaciers began lifting up again, forests and deserts expanded, and the climate gradually became more modern. In the process of warming up, the planet saw several \"cold snaps\" and \"warm snaps\", such as the Older Dryas and the Holocene climatic optimum, as well as heavier precipitation. In addition, the Pleistocene megafauna became extinct due to environmental and evolutionary pressures from the changing climate. This marked the end of the Quaternary extinction event, which was continued into the modern era by humans. The time around 11,700 years ago (9,700 BC) is widely considered to be the end of the old age (Pleistocene, Paleolithic, Stone Age, Wisconsin Ice Age), and the beginning of the modern world as we know it.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!colspan=\"2\"| Year(s)\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Event(s)\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Start\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|End\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|c. 2,588,000 BC\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|c. 12,000 BC\n|Pleistocene era\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|c. 21,000 BC\n|Recent evidence indicates that humans processed (gathered) and consumed wild cereal grains as far back as 23,000 years ago.\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|c. 20,000 BC\n|Antarctica sees a very rapid and abrupt 6&nbsp;°C increase in temperatures\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|c. 19,000 BC\n|Last Glacial Maximum/sea-level minimum\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|c. 20,000 BC\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|c. 12,150 BC\n|Mesolithic 1 period\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|c. 17,000 BC\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|c. 13,000 BC\n|Oldest Dryas stadial (cool period) during the last Ice age/glaciation in Europe.\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|c. 13,000 BC\n|Beginning of the Holocene extinction.

Carpenter has suggested that droughts of equal severity to those of the 1950s in Greece, would have been sufficient to cause the Late Bronze Age collapse.  The cause may have been a temporary diversion of winter storms north of the Pyrenees and Alps.  Central Europe experienced generally wetter conditions, while those in the Eastern Mediterranean were substantially drier.
