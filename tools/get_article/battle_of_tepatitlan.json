The government army was composed of 500 soldiers and 4,000 militia. The Cristeros were victorious but their leader Father Jose Reyes Vega was killed.\nAccording to Jean Meyer, the battle was on April 19.  Fr. Vega commanded three regiments in a pincer movement which enveloped six Federal units.  On the other hand, Moisés González Navarro confirms that Fr. Vega was killed in the battle, but he states that it occurred on April 20.\nReferences"
