Finding the wind direction unfavourable for entering the harbour the ship headed north to Newcastle and dropped anchor in the harbour.  A strong current dragged the ship on the 22 April and it hit the rocks so violently that the stern shattered and it filled instantly, breaking up in a few hours. The crew and much of the cargo of pork being carried was saved but the ship was destroyed.\nReferences"
