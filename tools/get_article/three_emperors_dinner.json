It consisted of 16 courses with eight wines served over eight hours.\nOverview\nThe Three Emperors Dinner was prepared by chef Adolphe Dugléré at the request of King William I of Prussia who frequented the cafe during the Exposition Universelle. He requested a meal to be remembered and at which no expense was to be spared for himself and his guests, Tsar Alexander II of Russia, plus his son the Tsarevitch (who later became Tsar Alexander III), and Otto von Bismarck.\nThe name \"Three Emperors Dinner\" is something of a misnomer and apparently was applied retrospectively (apparently in analogy to the Battle of the Three Emperors), as only Alexander II bore the title of Emperor at the time. Wilhelm I would not be proclaimed Kaiser (Emperor) until 1871, whereas Alexander III would only ascend the Imperial Russian throne in 1881 after his father's assassination.\nThe cellar master, Claudius Burdel, was instructed to accompany the dishes with the greatest wines in the world, including a Roederer champagne in a special lead glass bottle, so Tsar Alexander could admire the bubbles and golden colour.\nThe banquet consisted of 16 courses with eight wines served over eight hours. The cost of the meal was 400 francs per person (over €9,000 in  prices). The high price of the wines served contributed to the high price of the meal.\nAt 1 o'clock in the morning, Tsar Alexander is reported to have complained that the meal had not contained foie gras. Burdel explained that it was not the custom in French cuisine to eat foie gras in June. The following October, he was sent three terrines of foie gras made by Dugléré as a gift.\nThe table used for the banquet and a copy of the menu is on display at La Tour d'Argent restaurant in Paris.\nMenu\nThe menu included the following, among the 16 courses:\n{| align=right border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"40\"  style=\"text-align:center; margin-left:1.6em;\"\n|-\n| MENU\nPotages\nImpératrice\nFontanges\nRelevés\nSoufflé à la reine\nFilets de sole à la vénitienne\nEscalope de turbot au gratin\nSelle de mouton purée Bretonne\nEntrées\nPoulet à la portugaise\nPâté chaud de cailles\nHomard à la parisienne\nDigérer\nSorbets au champagne\nRôts\nCanetons à la rouennaise\nOrtolans sur canapés\nEntremets\n''Aubergines à l'espagnole\nAsperges en branches\nCassolette princesse\nDessert\nBombe glacée\nFruit\nVINS\nMadère retour de l'Inde 1810\nXérès 1821\nChâteaux d'Yquem 1847\nChambertin 1846\nChâteaux Margaux 1847\nChâteau Latour 1847\nChâteaux Lafite 1848\nChampagne Roederer frappé\n|}\nPotage impératrice'' consists of a chicken stock thickened with tapioca and finished with egg yolks and cream, to which poached rounds of chicken forcemeat, cockscombs, cocks' kidneys and green peas are added.\nPotage fontanges is a purée of fresh peas diluted with consommé with the addition of a chiffonade of sorrel and sprigs of chervil.\nSoufflé à la reine is a chicken soufflé with truffles\nSauce vénitienne is a sauce of white wine, tarragon vinegar, shallots and chervil, mounted with butter and finished with chopped chervil and tarragon.\nSelle de mouton purée Bretonne is saddle of mutton with a purée of broad beans bound with Breton sauce.\nPoulet à la portugaise is whole chicken roasted with a covering of adobo paste consisting of tomato, red bell pepper, garlic, origanum, paprika, cayenne pepper, brown sugar, lemon juice, white wine, chicken stock and olive oil, stuffed with tomato flavoured rice.\nPâté chaud de cailles is warm pâté of quail.\nHomard à la parisienne is lobster cooked in court bouillon, cut into slices and glazed with aspic, with a garnish of tomatoes stuffed with a macédoine of vegetables, dressed with a mixture of mayonnaise and aspic and garnished with sliced truffle.\nCanetons à la rouennaise is a dish of roast duckling stuffed with forcemeat.

It took six months to plan and required some changes due to key ingredients and wines no longer being available. Even using the nearest modern equivalent ingredients and wines, the cost of the meal was AUS$7,500 per person. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation broadcast the documentary Three Emperors Dinner about the original banquet and the modern recreation in 2003.\nSee also\n* Manchu-Han Imperial Feast\n* Banquet of Chestnuts\n* List of dining events\n* Nobel Banquet\nGallery\nReferences\n}}"
