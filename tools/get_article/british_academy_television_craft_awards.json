The top six programmes and/or individuals in each category are chosen by television voting members and Chapter members in three rounds, to make up the jury shortlist. The shortlist then goes forward to a jury, who decides the top four final nominees and the winners.\nCeremonies\nIn the following table, the years correspond to the year the ceremony took place, and are held for achievements of the previous year (e.g. the 2000 awards are celebrated for television productions of 1999).\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Venue\n! scope=\"col\" | Location\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Host\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n! 2000\n| scope=\"row\" |30 April\n| 195 Piccadilly\n| Westminster\n| Gabby Logan\n|\n|-\n! 2001\n| scope=\"row\" |22 April\n| Sadler's Wells Theatre\n| Islington\n| Liza Tarbuck\n|\n|-\n! 2002\n| scope=\"row\" |12 May\n| Savoy Hotel\n| Westminster\n| Harry Enfield\n|\n|-\n! 2003\n| scope=\"row\" |11 May\n| rowspan=\"6\"|The Dorchester\n| rowspan=\"8\"|Mayfair\n| rowspan=2|Alistair McGowan\n|\n|-\n! 2004\n| scope=\"row\" |16 May\n|\n|-\n! 2005\n| scope=\"row\" |8 May\n| rowspan=2|Jon Culshaw\n|\n|-\n! 2006\n| scope=\"row\" |19 May\n|\n|-\n! 2007\n| scope=\"row\" |22 April\n| Jon Snow\n|\n|-\n! 2008\n| scope=\"row\" |11 May\n| Claudia Winkleman\n|\n|-\n! 2009\n| scope=\"row\" |17 May\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Hilton Hotel, London\n| Alexander Armstrong\n|\n|-\n! 2010\n| scope=\"row\" |23 May\n| Christine Bleakley\n|\n|-\n! 2011\n| scope=\"row\" |8 May\n| rowspan=\"9\"|The Brewery\n| rowspan=\"9\"|City of London\n| Stephen Mangan\n|\n|-\n! 2012\n| scope=\"row\" |13 May\n| Alan Davies\n|\n|-\n! 2013\n| scope=\"row\" |28 April\n| rowspan=8|Stephen Mangan\n|\n|-\n! 2014\n| scope=\"row\" |24 April\n|\n|-\n! 2015\n| scope=\"row\" |26 April\n|\n|-\n! 2016\n| scope=\"row\" |24 April\n|\n|-\n! 2017\n| scope=\"row\" |23 April\n|\n|-\n! 2018\n| scope=\"row\" |22 April\n|\n|-\n! 2019\n| scope=\"row\" |28 April\n|\n|-\n! 2020\n| scope=\"row\" |17 July\n| rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Virtual\n|\n|-\n! 2021\n| scope=\"row\" |24 May\n| Gbemisola Ikumelo\n|\n|-\n! 2022\n| scope=\"row\" |24 April\n| rowspan=\"3\" |The Brewery\n| rowspan=\"3\" |City of London\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Mel Giedroyc\n|\n|-\n! 2023\n| scope=\"row\" |23 April\n|\n|-\n! 2024\n| scope=\"row\" |28 April\n| Stacey Dooley\n|\n|}\nCategories\nCurrent awards\nAs of 2021, the awards include twenty-one competitive categories:\n* Costume Design\n* Director: Factual\n* Director: Fiction\n* Director: Multi-Camera\n* Editing: Factual\n* Editing: Fiction\n* Emerging Talent: Factual\n* Emerging Talent: Fiction\n* Entertainment Craft Team\n* Make-Up & Hair Design\n* Original Music\n* Photography: Factual\n* Photography & Lighting: Fiction\n* Production Design\n* Scripted Casting\n* Sound: Factual\n* Sound: Fiction\n* Special, Visual & Graphic Effects\n* Titles & Graphic Identity\n* Writer: Comedy\n* Writer: Drama\nA Special Award is also presented, at the discretion of the Television Committee, which \"honour[s] an individual or a team of craftspeople for outstanding creative contribution in the craft sector.\"\nDiscontinued awards\n* Originality (from 1986 to 1999)\n* Innovation (from 2000 to 2002)\n* New Media Developer (from 2006 to 2007)\n* Interactive Innovation (from 2006 to 2010)\n* Digital Creativity (from 2011 to 2017)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.bafta.org/television/craft-awards/ TV Craft section of BAFTA Awards Database]"
