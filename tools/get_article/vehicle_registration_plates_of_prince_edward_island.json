The first Prince Edward Island licence plate that complied with these standards was issued six years beforehand, in 1950.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Image\n!Dates issued\n!Description\n!Slogan\n!Serial format\n!Serials issued\n!Notes\n|-\n|\n|1919\n|Dark blue serial on light blue porcelain plate; vertical \"PEI\" at right\n|none\n|1234\n|1 to approximately 1000\n|\n|-\n|\n|1920\n|Embossed white serial on green plate with border line; vertical \"PEI\" at right\n|none\n|1234\n|1001 to approximately 2500\n|First embossed plate.\n|-\n|\n|1921\n|Embossed black serial on white plate with border line; vertical \"PEI\" at right\n|none\n|1-234\n|3-001 to approximately 4-800\n|\n|-\n|\n|1922\n|Embossed orange serial on black plate with border line; vertical \"PEI\" at right\n|none\n|1-234\n|5-001 to approximately 7-200\n|\n|-\n|\n|1923\n|Embossed white serial on black plate with border line; \"P.E.I. 1923\" at left\n|none\n|1-234\n|1-001 to approximately 3-300\n|First dated plate.\n|-\n|\n|1924\n|Embossed black serial on light green plate with border line; \"P.E.I. 1924\" at left\n|none\n|1-234\n|4-001 to approximately 6-500\n|\n|-\n|\n|1925\n|Embossed red serial on white plate with border line; vertical \"P.E.I.\" and \"1925\" at left and right respectively\n|none\n|1-234\n|5-001 to approximately 7-900\n|\n|-\n|\n|1926\n|Embossed white serial on red plate with border line; \"P.E.
