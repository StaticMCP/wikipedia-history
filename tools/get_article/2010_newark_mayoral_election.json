Elections for all seats on the nine member Municipal Council of Newark were held the same day. A runoff election, if necessary, would have taken place. Elections in the city are non-partisan and candidates are not listed by political party. Incumbent Mayor  Cory Booker avoided a runoff and was re-elected to his second term in office.\nBooker would not serve out the entirety of his second term. In 2013, after having won the October&nbsp;16 special election for U.S. senator, Booker resigned as mayor and was sworn in on October&nbsp;31 as the junior U.S. senator from New Jersey. Luis A. Quintana, long-term member of the Municipal Council, replaced him as interim mayor. In 2019, he mounted a campaign to participate in 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.\nResults\nIf no candidate had received 50% of the vote, the race would have continued to a run-off between the top two candidates from the first round.\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links"
