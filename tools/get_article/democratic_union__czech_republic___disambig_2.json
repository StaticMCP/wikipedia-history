It existed since 1994 and was dissolved in 2002 when it merged with\nFreedom Union.\nHistory\nThe party first participated in 1996 legislative election but failed to reach 5% threshold. The party later joined Four-Coalition.\nDEU merged with Freedom Union in 2000, and Freedom Union changed its name to Freedom Union – Democratic Union. Members of DEU founded a relatively independent platform, whose members later tried, unsuccessfully, to take over the leadership. Platform then left the party and established Democratic Union of the Czech Republic (DEU ČR).\nElection results\nChamber of deputies of the Czech Republic\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Year\n! Vote\n!
