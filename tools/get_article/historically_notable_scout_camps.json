Each Scouting association runs its own camp. For example, in the United States, a number of national camps are run by the Boy Scouts of America, and the local councils run the greatest number of camps. The two most important factors in establishing notability are the age of the camp, and its impact on the local community or country where it is located.\nOldest Boy Scout Camps of the BSA\nIn the United States, summer camps were an important part of 20th century culture.
