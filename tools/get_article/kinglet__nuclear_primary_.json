Allegedly, only the W47Y2 version of the warhead. The W47Y1 was .}} was converted to the Mod 3 design using Kinglet.\nDesign\nThe Kinglet device was approximately  in diameter,  in length and weighed approximately .\nThe device was of the two-point design. Two-point devices only require two detonators to fire the whole device, compared to earlier nuclear weapons that required tens of detonators.\nCharacteristics of the warheads that used Kinglet are:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|+ Kinglet primary based nuclear weapons\n|-\n!Warhead\n!Max Yield\n!Diameter\n!Length\n!Weight\n|-\n|W47Y2 Mod 3\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|W55\n|, but also describe it as being a \"mid-kiloton weapon\" and based on the same  Hardtack Olive device that became the W58 warhead.}}\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|W58\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* List of nuclear weapons\n* Teller-Ulam design\n* Tsetse primary\n* Python primary\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n* [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.2968/057002015 Beware the old story] by Chuck Hansen, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, March/April 2001 pp. 52-55 (vol. 57, no. 02)\n*http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Weapons?Allbombs.html\n*The History of the UK.
