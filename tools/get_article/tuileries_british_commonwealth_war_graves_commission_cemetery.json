The chimneys of the tile works were very visible and provided a means for the opposing side to calibrate their shells. This led to the cemetery itself being heavily shelled and the sites of most of the original graves were lost. Most of the gravestones are positioned around the edges of the otherwise empty-looking cemetery, and are marked \"known to be buried in this cemetery\", with the default additional phrase \"Their glory shall not be blotted out\", a line suggested by Rudyard Kipling.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=cr&CRid=2161155 Tuileries British Cemetery] at Find a Grave"
