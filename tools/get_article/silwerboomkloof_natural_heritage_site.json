The rare Silvertree (Leucadendron argenteum) is a striking, silver-coloured tree of the Protea family, and this reserve conserves a forest of them. The iconic Silvertree is actually indigenous to the eastern slopes of Table Mountain, making the population at Silwerboomkloof a bit of an isolated anomaly.\nThis  reserve encloses a section of “Granite Fynbos” and “Renosterveld” and a total of around 220 species of plant have been recorded.\nFile:Copy of Leucadendron argenteum - Silvertree- foliage 4.JPG|The shiny silver foliage of the rare \"Silvertree\" protea.\nFile:Silverleaf tree - Silwerboomkloof reserve Cape Town.jpg|A Silvertree growing on the slopes of Silwerboomkloof.\nSee also\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences"
