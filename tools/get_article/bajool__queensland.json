In the , the locality of Bajool had a population of 447 people.\nGeography\nBajool is located on the Bruce Highway, 35&nbsp;km south of Rockhampton and 74&nbsp;km north of Gladstone. Eight-Mile Creek flows to the east of the town.\nThe North Coast railway line enters the locality from the west (Marmor) and exits to the north (Midgee) with two railway stations serving the locality (from north to south):\n* Archer railway station ()\n* Bajool railway station, serving the town ()\nThe Bruce Highway runs almost parallel and immediately south of the railway line, except that it bypasses the town to the west.\nThe locality has the following mountains:\n* Beschs Hill ()\n* Mount Gindiwarra ()\n* Mount Helen ()\n* Mount Hopeful ()\n* Mount Kelly ()\n* Mount Mccamley ()\nHistory\nThe town takes its name from the Bajool railway station which was named by the Queensland Railways Department in 1903 using the Aboriginal name for the lagoon on the Archer brothers' property Gracemere. The name of the lagoon  has also been written as Padgole and Badul. It has been suggested that the meaning of the name was Big Fella water hole or stop here.\nA provisional school opened on 12 March 1888 at Eight Mile Creek under teacher Mr Beck (brother of J. Beck, chairman of the Fitzroy Shire Council); it closed in 1892. The school reopened on 30 September 1895 with teacher Michael Donovan, but closed again on 18 September 1896. On 5 February 1900, a part-time provisional school was established in a private home at a short-lived mining field called San Jose with 10 students under teacher William MacLean. On 2 September 1902,  another part-time school was opened in conjunction at the home of Mr H. Cross in Bajool with 6 students. In August 1903, the two part-time schools were combined into Bajool Provisional School with 31 students in another building on Cross's property. In 1903 the school closed for a while and the land it was using was resumed for the railway line from Gladstone to Rockhampton. However, the railway enabled Bajool to grow. The school re-opened on the southern side of Mill Street in late 1904, and became Bajool State School in 1909.\nUlam Upper Provisional School opened circa 1892. On 1 January 1909, it became Ulam Upper State School.  It closed circa 1961.\nIn 1892, local people in South Ulam applied for a school as there were 21 children in the area. However, disagreements as to the size and location of the school site delayed obtaining government approval. By December 1893, the school building was completed, having been fully funded by local people as they received no government money. Ulam South Provisional School opened on 22 January 1894. On 1 January 1909, it became Ulam South State School. It closed in 1925. It was on a  site at 1385 South Ulam Road near the junction with Comerford Road ().\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Bajool had a population of 543 people.\nIn the , the locality of Bajool had a population of 455 people.\nIn the , the locality of Bajool had a population of 447 people.\nEducation\nBajool State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 54-60 Toonda Street ().
