Although the Great Powers intervened to force an armistice, the terms of the Treaty were revised in Dutch favour, to create the Treaty of Twenty-Four Articles. It was to those revised terms that the Dutch were to appeal at the end of the decade, in order to obtain the Luxemburg/Limburg territory allocated them therein, but previously retained still under Belgian control.\nA new Conference saw the Eighteen Articles succeeded by the Treaty of London, incorporating the Treaty of the Twenty-Four Articles of October 1831.\nSee also\n*Benelux\n*List of treaties\n*Rattachism\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/archives.gb/dossiers/140ministres.gb/monarjui/chrono.html Chronology: The July Monarchy (1830 - 1848)]\n*"
