      "text": "# Towards the Republic\n\nTowards the Republic, also known as For the Sake of the Republic and Zou Xiang Gong He (), is a Chinese historical television series first broadcast on China Central Television (CCTV) in China from April to May 2003. The series is based on events which occurred in China in the late 19th century and early 20th century, and led to the collapse of the Qing dynasty and the founding of the Republic of China. Because the series portrayed historical issues to which the current Chinese government remains politically sensitive, the series has been subjected to censorship in mainland China.\nPlot\nThe series concentrates on various important events of the late Qing dynasty and Republican era in the late 19th century and early 20th century in China, including the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Hundred Days' Reform (1898), the Boxer Rebellion (1900), and the 1911 Revolution.\nThe series narrates historical events and portrays the private lives of key political figures such as Li Hongzhang, the Guangxu Emperor, Yuan Shikai and Sun Yat-sen. There are monarchists, reformers and revolutionaries who provide different answers to addressing the deteriorating situation of the Qing dynasty but all these answers point towards a common goal – to restore China as a sovereign, international and independent power.\nCast\nLead roles\n* Wang Bing as Li Hongzhang\n* Lü Zhong as Empress Dowager Cixi\n* Ma Shaohua as Sun Yat-sen\n* Sun Chun as Yuan Shikai\n* Li Guangjie as Guangxu Emperor\nSupporting roles\n* Xu Min as Yikuang (Prince Qing)\n* Jiang Nan as Empress Dowager Longyu\n* Zheng Tianyong as Prince Gong\n* Hao Zi as Zaizhen\n* Hao Bojie as Zaize\n* Asiru as Consort Zhen\n* Ge Zhijun as Ronglu\n* Zhang Ju as Weng Tonghe\n* Liao Bingyan as Zhang Zhidong\n* Jia Yiping as Tieliang\n* Wen Haibo as Sheng Xuanhuai\n* Liu Weiming as Zhang Jian\n* Tian Xiaojie as Gu Hongming\n* Han Yingqun as Ma Sanjun\n* Su Mao as Deng Shichang\n* Li Yonggui as Li Lianying\n* Ma Xiaoning as Xiaodezhang\n* Zheng Tianyong as Qu Hongji\n* Sun Ning as Kang Youwei\n* Zhang Han as Liang Qichao\n* Li Chuanying as Huang Xing\n* Qiao Lisheng as Song Jiaoren\n* Zheng Yu as Xu Shichang\n* Cai Wei as Li Yuanhong\n* Ma Lun as Duan Qirui\n* Yang Junyong as Ying Guixin\n* Li Yi as Zhao Bingjun\n* Yao Gang as Feng Guozhang\n* Han Zaifen as Shen Yuying\n* Yano Koji as Emperor Meiji\n* Hirata Yasuyuki as Itō Hirobumi\n* Nakamura Bunpei as Itō Sukeyuki\n* Kuwana Waku as Mutsu Munemitsu\n* Kamitani as Komura Jutarō\n* J. René Godin as Alfred von Waldersee\n* Hoshino Akiraka as Saigō Tsugumichi\nCensorship\nThe politically sensitive issues which likely triggered the heavy censorship of the series included issues such as the more sympathetic and complex portrayal of Empress Dowager Cixi, Yuan Shikai and Li Hongzhang, who are usually portrayed in a negative light in official Chinese historiography. Historically accurate but politically inconvenient quotes, such as Sun Yat-sen's speech on inequality and the suppression of democracy, were cut from the series.\nThe censorship has significantly reduced the length of some episodes. The final episode was cut to nearly half of its original duration of 50 minutes, and the series was reorganised from scripted 60 to aired 59 episodes. The censors also blocked plans for a rerun. The censorship, however, did not prevent the international distribution of the series on VCD and DVD (these versions also suffered less from censorship than the version aired on CCTV).\nReception\nThe series has been very popular in China. The debate caused by the series, as well as its censorship and issues for discussion, have been compared to a similar event in 1988 involving another documentary television series River Elegy. River Elegy drew criticism for presenting a controversial view on Chinese culture, and is seen as a factor that influenced the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. Issues raised in discussions include questions on the extent to which artists are permitted to reinterpret history, and the degree to which certain portrayal of historical figures and events is dictated by politics rather than science. As a consequence of the controversy caused by this series, the Central Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist Party began an analysis of \"the accuracy with which historical figures are represented in television dramas\".\nSee also\n* 1911 (film)\n* 1911 Revolution (TV series)\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*  [https://web.archive.org/web/20160129074915/http://sun.sino.uni-heidelberg.de/representations/gonghe/gonghe.html Synopsis]\n* Matthias Niedenführ, \"Re-writing history on Chinese TV: The series Zouxiang Gonghe (The road to the Republic)\" in International Textbook Research no 1 (2005): 79–90.\nExternal links\n*\n*  [http://data.ent.sina.com.cn/tv/1406.html Towards the Republic] on Sina.com\n*  [http://www.cctv.com/teleplay/special/zxgh/01/index.shtml Towards the Republic official page] on CCTV website"
