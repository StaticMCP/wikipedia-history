Through his mother, Catherine Sheffield, he was a grandson of King James II.\nThe legitimate son of John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby, he succeeded his father in 1721. He matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford in 1732 and died of consumption in Rome in 1735. As he never married and left no issue, the dukedom became extinct upon his death. The family estates, including Normanby Park, devolved upon his illegitimate half brother Charles Herbert Sheffield.\nNotes\nReferences\n*"
