The crusades was a series of wars and a religious, political, and military endeavor mainly fought between the Muslims and the Crusaders, but it also involved some Anti-Crusade Christians, Pagan tribes and other states and entities against the Papal Authority. Even after the Fall of Acre the crusaders continue their crusades against Muslim and other entities by some historians but it began to decline due to the Protestant Reformation, but some historians believed that it continued until 1699 when the Great Turkish War ended which some historians called it the “last crusade.”\nCrusaders\nState actors\n* Papal States\n* Byzantine Empire (Sometimes)\n* Kingdom of Jerusalem\n* Principality of Antioch\n* County of Tripoli\n* Holy Roman Empire\n* Kingdom of France\n* Kingdom of England\n* Kingdom of Hungary\n* Latin Empire\n* Kingdom of Thessalonica\n* Duchy of Athens\nMuslims and other non-crusaders\nState actors\nMuslims\n* Seljuk Empire\n* Fatimids Caliphate\n* Abbasid Caliphate\n* Zengid Dynasty\n* Sultanate of Rum\n* Ayyubid Sultanate\n* Mamluk Sultanate\n* Ottoman Empire\nNon-Crusader Christians\n* Byzantine Empire (Sometimes)\n* Empire of Nicaea\n* Empire of Cyprus\nNon-State actors\n* Cathars\nSee Also\n* Crusades\n* List of crusades\n* Struggle for Constantinople\n* Fall of Constantinople\n* European Wars of Religion\nReferences"
