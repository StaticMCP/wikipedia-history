It is a two-lane uncontrolled access highway that runs nearly the entire length of the province, from Tignish to Souris. Route 2 was recognized as the first numbered highway in the province in 1890, when it opened between Charlottetown and Summerside.\nIt passes through the cities of Summerside and Charlottetown and roughly parallels the former primary railway line through the province, which was abandoned in 1989.\nThe highway was first paved in the 1950s with many upgrades in recent decades. A perimeter arterial highway (ring road) across the northern and eastern part of Charlottetown was constructed as part of Route 2 in the 1990s with funding from a $200 million federal adjustment fund for road construction after the railway was abandoned. This section of road was extended to Upton Road and is now signed for Route 1 (the Trans-Canada Highway), although Route 2 uses a small portion of the arterial highway between the Malpeque Road and St. Peter's Highway.\nNames\nRoute 2 is commonly called the \"All Weather Highway,\" as it was one of the first roads in Prince Edward Island to be open for traffic in all seasons. In June 2002, premier Pat Binns designated the highway the \"Veterans Memorial Highway\". Transportation minister Don MacKinnon said that the designation honoured the highway's vital role in the Second World War, when it provided \"a transportation link to the military facilities of CFB Summerside and the air training facility in Mount Pleasant\".\nRoute 2 has several local names:\n* Souris Road (Souris to Route 4 at Dingwells Mills)\n* St. Peter's Highway (Dingwells Mills to Charlottetown)\n* Malpeque Road (Charlottetown to Hunter River); the Malpeque Road alignment continuing thereafter on the Old Princetown Road\n* New Annan Road (Kensington to Summerside)\n* Western Road (Summerside to Tignish)\nMount Pleasant diversion\nThe portion of the highway running through the farming hamlet of Mount Pleasant west of Summerside was diverted for several years during the 1940s with the establishment of an air force base named RCAF Station Mount Pleasant. The base was closed following World War II and the \"Western Road\" was returned to its original alignment which currently runs along the former flight line and tarmac of the air force base. The diversion road constructed around the base is still in use as a local public road.\nMajor intersections\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    = Western terminus\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    = Intersections offset;  concurrency\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    = Roundabout\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    = Roundabout\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    = West end of Route&nbsp;12 concurrency\n}}\n|notes    = East end of Route&nbsp;12 concurrency\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    = Roundabout\n}}\n|notes    = Intersections offset;  concurrency\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    = West end of Route&nbsp;110 concurrency\n}}\n|notes    = East end of Route&nbsp;110 concurrency\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    = Intersections offset;  concurrency\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    = Intersections offset;  concurrency\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    = Intersections offset;  concurrency\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    = West end of Route&nbsp;256 concurrency\n}}\n|notes    = East end of Route&nbsp;256 concurrency\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    = Route&nbsp;2 branches east onto Perimeter Highway; west end of Route&nbsp;1 concurrency\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    = Route&nbsp;2 branches east onto St.&nbsp;Peters Road; east end of Route&nbsp;1 concurrency; displaced left turn\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    = West end of Route&nbsp;260 concurrency\n}}\n|notes    = East end of Route&nbsp;260 concurrency\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    = West end of Route&nbsp;313 concurrency\n}}\n|notes    = East end of Route&nbsp;313 concurrency\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    = Eastern terminus; roadway continues as Route&nbsp;16\n}}\nReferences"
