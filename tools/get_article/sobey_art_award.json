      "text": "# Sobey Art Award\n\nThe Sobey Art Award is Canada's largest prize for young Canadian artists. It is named after Canadian businessperson and art collector Frank H. Sobey, who established The Sobey Art Foundation. It is an annual prize given to an artist 40 and under who has exhibited in a public or commercial art gallery within 18 months of being nominated. A jury consisting of an international juror and representatives of galleries from the West Coast and the Yukon, the Prairies and the North, Ontario, Quebec and the Atlantic Provinces creates a longlist of 25 artists, five from each region. The jury meets to select the winner and four other finalists, one from each region.\nThe Sobey award has attracted controversy in the past. Annie Pootoogook became the first Inuk artist to win the prize in 2006, despite the Sobey foundation failing to recognize her native Nunavut and the Northwest Territories as regions of significant cultural production. The award has 2017 was the first year to see the shortlist dominated by women and also the first year that more than one Indigenous artist was shortlisted.\nUp to 2013, a total of $70,000 in prize money was awarded each time the prize was presented; $50,000 to the winner and $5,000 to the other four finalists. In 2014 the total was increased to $100,000 with $50,000 to the winner and $12,500 to the other four finalists. In 2017, the money awarded to longlisted artists was increased from $500 to $1,000. In 2018, the prize money increased once again, to a total of $240,000; $100,000 to the winner, $25,000 for each of the other four finalists, and $2,000 for each short-listed artist.\nThe award was presented biennially until 2006 at which point it became an annual award. From its inception until 2015, the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia organized and administered the Sobey Art Award and its accompanying exhibition.  The National Gallery of Canada assumed responsibility for the award in 2016. In 2020, Sobey Art Foundation and the National Gallery of Canada decided to distribute the cash award among the 25 finalists rather than just one winner. This was a response to the financial hardships suffered by artists because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year!!Winner!!Region\n|-\n| 2002 || Brian Jungen || West Coast and Yukon\n|-\n| 2004 || Jean-Pierre Gauthier || Quebec\n|-\n| 2006 || Annie Pootoogook || Prairies and the North\n|-\n| 2007 || Michel de Broin || Quebec\n|-\n| 2008 || Tim Lee || West Coast and Yukon\n|-\n| 2009 || David Altmejd || Quebec\n|-\n| 2010 || Daniel Barrow || Prairies and the North\n|-\n| 2011 || Daniel Young & Christian Giroux || Ontario\n|-\n| 2012 || Raphaëlle de Groot || Quebec\n|-\n| 2013 || Duane Linklater || Ontario\n|-\n| 2014 || Nadia Myre || Quebec\n|-\n| 2015 || Abbas Akhavan || Ontario\n|-\n| 2016 || Jeremy Shaw|| West Coast and Yukon\n|-\n| 2017 || Ursula Johnson || Atlantic\n|-\n| 2018 || Kapwani Kiwanga || Ontario\n|-\n| 2019 || Stephanie Comilang || Ontario\n|-\n| 2020 || Michele Di Menna, Tsēmā Igharas, Carmen Papalia, Joseph Tisiga, Zadie Xa (West Coast and Yukon), Asinnajaq, Jason de Haan, Luther Konadu, Amy Malbeuf, Freya Björg Olafson (Prairies and the North), Bambitchell, Sara Cwynar, Georgia Dickie, Jagdeep Raina, Catherine Telford Keogh (Ontario), Adam Basanta, Moridja Kitenge Banza, Manuel Mathieu, Caroline Monnet, Sabrina Ratté (Quebec), Jordan Bennett, Melanie Colosimo, Graeme Patterson, Lou Sheppard, D’Arcy Wilson (Atlantic)\n|-\n| 2021 || Laakkuluk Williamson Bathory || Prairies and the North\n|-\n| 2022 || Divya Mehra || Prairies and the North\n|-\n| 2023 || Kablusiak ||Prairies and the North\n|-\n|2024\n|Nico Williams\n|Quebec\n|}\nSee also\n* Sobey family\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
