They were supplemented by specially-equipped aircraft flown by No. 100 Group RAF, which operated modified Halifaxes, Liberators and Fortresses carrying various jammers such as Carpet, Airborne Cigar, Mandrel, Jostle, and Piperack.\nList of electronic-warfare aircraft\nExamples of modern aircraft designed or modified for EW include:\nof the US Air Force]]\n]]\n* Antonov An-12BK-PPS (Soviet Union)\n* Antonov An-26REP (Soviet Union)\n* Boeing EA-18G Growler (United States)\n* Denel TP1 Oryx EW (South Africa)\n* Douglas C-47TP EW (South Africa)\n* Douglas EA-3 Skywarrior (United States)\n* Douglas EB-66 Destroyer (United States)\n* Douglas EF-10B Skyknight (United States)\n* Embraer R-99 (Brazil)\n* General Dynamics/Grumman EF-111A Raven (United States)\n* IAI 202B Arava (Israel)\n* Ilyushin Il-22PP (Soviet Union) / (Russia)\n* Kawasaki EC-1 (Japan)\n* L3Harris EA-37B Compass Call (United States)\n* Kawasaki RC-2 (Japan)\n* Lockheed EC-130H Compass Call (United States)\n* Mil Mi-8PP (Soviet Union)\n* Northrop Grumman EA-6B Prowler (United States)\n* Tornado ECR (Germany / Italy)\n* Shaanxi Y-8EW (China)\n* Shaanxi Y-8-GX1 (China)\n* Shaanxi Y-9-GX11 (China)\n* Shaanxi Y-9LG (China)\n* Shaanxi Y-9DZ (China)\n* Shenyang J-15D (China)\n* Shenyang J-16D (China)\n* Sukhoi Su-24MP (Soviet Union)\n* Tupolev Tu-16RM-2 (Soviet Union)\n* Yakovlev Yak-28PP (Soviet Union)\n* Dassault Falcon 20 (Pakistan)\n* Saab Globaleye (Sweden)\n* Hava Soj (Turkey)\nReferences"
