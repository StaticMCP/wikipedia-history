It is one of three high schools in the Brandywine School District. There was a total of 1,014 students enrolled in the fall for the 2024–2025 school year. Jeffrey Lawson is the current principal of Concord High School.\nIts attendance boundary includes: parts of the City of Wilmington, and a small section of Ardentown.\nHistory\nCHS opened in 1967 in response to a rapidly rising population that produced too many students for Brandywine High School, then in the Alfred I. duPont District, to handle on its own. Upon opening, it was located on the same campus as Hanby Junior High and taught only ninth and tenth grades. Construction on CHS' own building was delayed due to a worker strike and did not open until January 1970, an entire semester after the planned date and still without its gym, auditorium, and swimming pool completed. During the delay, CHS was forced to leave Hanby and move temporarily into Brandywine High School's building; the two schools taught on a rotating basis: BHS students attended in the morning and CHS students attended in the afternoon.\nAthletics\nConcord is a member of Flight B of the Blue Hen Conference in the Delaware Interscholastic Athletic Association (DIAA); the Raiders compete in Class 2A, District 1 for football.
