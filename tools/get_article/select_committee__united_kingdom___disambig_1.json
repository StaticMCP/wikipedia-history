Committees may be constituted as \"sessional\" committees&nbsp;– i.e. be near-permanent&nbsp;– or as \"ad-hoc\" committees with a specific deadline by which to complete their work, after which they cease to exist.\nHouse of Commons select committees are generally responsible for overseeing the work of government departments and agencies, whereas Lords select committees look at general issues, such as the constitution or the economy. Select committees are also one of Parliament's mechanisms for holding the private sector to account.\nFollowing the 2024 United Kingdom general election, most of the new chairs of the 26 select committees were elected in September 2024.\nSome English local authorities also have a select committee system, as part of their Overview and Scrutiny arrangements.\nHow select committees work and governing rules\nCommittees often open investigations, called inquiries, into topics within their remit. As part of these inquiries they gather information from government officials and interested people, groups, and organisations. At the end of inquiries they often publish a report with their findings. The government must issue a written response to each select committee report.\nSelect committees in the House of Commons are governed by the Standing Orders. The powers of departmental select committees are set out in standing order 152.\nPolitical parties divide committee chair positions based on their number of seats in the House of Commons. Party managers negotiate which party chairs each committee. By tradition, the Public Accounts Committee is led by a member of the opposition party, while a member of the governing party leads the Treasury Select Committee. Committee membership reflects each party’s size in the House, and members are elected within their parties.\nTypically, a departmental committee has 11 members, though some, like Public Accounts, are larger.\nThe Osmotherly Rules set out guidance on how civil servants should respond to parliamentary select committees.\nFollowing general elections, chairs and members of select committees have to be reappointed.\nCommittees have no legal power to compel people to appear before them. Rupert Murdoch and Mike Ashley are two examples of witnesses who initially declined before agreeing to appear. Mark Zuckerberg, for example, declined to appear in front of a committee at all.\nTypes of select committees\nHouse of Commons select committees\nFollowing the dissolution of parliament that preceded the 2024 election, all select committees were disbanded. The House of Commons allocated which parties would hold each Chair in advance of the summer recess on 30 July 2024. Nominations for Chairs ran until 9 September. Ballots took place on 11 September.\nDepartmental select committees\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Committee\n! colspan=\"3\" |Chair\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Responsibility\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Name\n!Since\n|-\n|Business and Trade Select Committee\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Liam Byrne\n|2023\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |Department for Business and Trade and related bodies\n|-\n|Culture, Media and Sport Committee\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Caroline Dinenage\n|2023\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |Department for Culture, Media and Sport\n|-\n|Defence Select Committee\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Tan Dhesi\n|2024\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |Ministry of Defence\n|-\n|Education Select Committee\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Helen Hayes\n|2024\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |Department for Education and related bodies\n|-\n|Energy Security and Net Zero Select Committee\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Bill Esterson\n|2024\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |Department for Energy Security and Net Zero and related bodies\n|-\n|Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Alistair Carmichael\n|2024\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and associated bodies\n|-\n|Foreign Affairs Select Committee\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Emily Thornberry\n|2024\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and associated bodies\n|-\n|Health and Social Care Select Committee\n| style=\"background:\" |\n|Layla Moran\n|2024\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |Department of Health and Social Care and related bodies\n|-\n|Home Affairs Select Committee\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Karen Bradley\n|2024\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |Home Office and related bodies\n|-\n|Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Florence Eshalomi\n|2024\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government\n|-\n|International Development Select Committee\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Sarah Champion\n|2020\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and associated bodies\n|-\n|Justice Select Committee\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Andy Slaughter\n|2024\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |Ministry of Justice, related agencies including the Crown Prosecution Service, and other agencies that report to the Lord Chancellor\n|-\n|Northern Ireland Affairs Committee\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Tonia Antoniazzi\n|2024\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |The work of the devolved government and the Northern Ireland Office\n|-\n|Science, Innovation and Technology Committee\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Chi Onwurah\n|2024\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |Government Office for Science, Department for Science, Innovation and Technology and related bodies\n|-\n|Scottish Affairs Committee\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Patricia Ferguson\n|2024\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |The work of the devolved government and the Scotland Office\n|-\n|Transport Select Committee\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Ruth Cadbury\n|2024\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |Department for Transport\n|-\n|Treasury Select Committee\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Meg Hillier\n|2024\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |Treasury and HM Revenue and Customs\n|-\n|Welsh Affairs Select Committee\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Ruth Jones\n|2024\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |The Wales Office and UK Government policies which impact Wales\n|-\n|Women and Equalities Select Committee\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Sarah Owen\n|2024\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |The Government Equalities Office and policies which affect equality law and policy\n|-\n|Work and Pensions Select Committee\n| style=\"background:\" |\n|Debbie Abrahams\n|2024\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |Department for Work and Pensions\n|}\nCross-cutting select committees\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!

In the sixteenth century, committees revised bills and considered constitutional and religious questions.\nThe committees system was further developed during the mid-1960s by Richard Crossman as Leader of the House of Commons.\nThe modern system of departmental select committees in the UK came into being in 1979, following the recommendations of a 1978 Procedure Select Committee report. It recommended the appointment of a series of select committees covering all the main departments of state, with wide terms of reference, and with power to appoint specialist advisers as the committees deemed appropriate. It also suggested that committee members should be selected independently of the party whips, as chosen by the Select Committee of Selection. The fourteen new committees began working in 1980 after the 1979 general election.\nSince then, Parliament has organised House of Commons committees into three main types:\n* Departmental committees: Each committee scrutinises a specific government department. For example, the Education Select Committee watches over the Department for Education.\n* Cross-cutting committees: These committees focus on broader topics that don’t belong to any single department. For example, the Science and Technology Select Committee, and Women and Equalities Select Committee.\n* Domestic committees: These committees manage issues within Parliament itself, like procedures and standards.\nIn July 2005, the Administration Select Committee was created to replace five previous committees. It covers services in the House, including catering, the House of Commons Library, digital services, and visitor services.\nSometimes, committees from the House of Commons or joint standing committees (which include members of both Houses) review individual bills in detail. Most bills go to public bill committees. Before 2006, these were called standing committees.\nIn 2009, the Wright Committee was formed to improve the procedures and relevance of Parliament. Changes made based on the committee's recommendations included limiting the number of members per committee to 11, requiring those members and chairs to be appointed to their positions by the House, and a reduction in the number of committees.\nThe Backbench Business Committee was created in 2010 as a non-ministerial committee to cover non-government business, following recommendations from the Reform the House of Commons report under the Wright Committee.\nSince June 2010, most committee chairs are elected by the whole House. Before this, each party appointed members and chose chairs within the group.\nImpact and influence\nSelect committees recommendations often focus on changes to government policy. One study estimates that 30–40% of select committee recommendations become policy.\nIn popular culture\nA select committee evidence session is featured in season 3, episode 5 of Industry. In the episode, Robert is sent to represent Pierpoint as part of the committee's inquiry into the collapse and bailout of Lumi, a green energy tech company.\nA 2015 select committee inquiry into the Horizon computer system features in Mr Bates vs The Post Office.\nSee also\n*Parliamentary committees of the United Kingdom\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/committees/ How Parliament works: Committees] UK Parliament\n*[https://committees.parliament.uk/ UK Parliament: Committees]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071211221436/http://www.unlockdemocracy.org.uk/wiki/index.php/Central_Lobby#Select_Committees/ Democracywiki] Unlock Democracy"
