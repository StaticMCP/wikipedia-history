Concerning the building of the battleship Yamato, the film is based on a manga by Norifusa Mita. It is a fictionalized telling of the political maneuvers, specifically pertaining to budget and cost issues, that led to the decision to build the Yamato. The film was dubbed into various languages and distributed worldwide.\nPlot\nRear Admiral Shigetarō Shimada and Vice Admiral Tadamichi Hirayama of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) propose to build the super-battleship. Admirals Yamamoto and Nagano, who support aircraft carriers, recruit Tadashi Kai to find faults with the proposal. Kai is an autistic mathematics prodigy obsessed with geometry.\nKai uses copied blueprints, extrapolations from the design of the battleship Nagato, and shipbuilding procurement data from personal connections, to show that the steel for the new battleship will cost twice the amount estimated by Hirayama, the designer. Hirayama admits to misreporting the cost to get the ship approved, and intended to compensate the shipbuilders by overpaying on future cruisers. Hirayama withdraws the proposal when Kai finds a flaw in the design. The aircraft carrier proposed by Yamamoto's faction is approved instead.\nAfterwards, Hirayama tells Kai the real reason for the new battleship. Hirayama believes that Japanese militarism makes war inevitable, and that Japan will destroy itself fighting this unwinnable war. Hirayama intends the battleship to embody Japan's collective spirit to make its loss so traumatizing that Japan will surrender before being invaded. Kai, a pacifist, reluctantly agrees to perfect the battleship design, which becomes the .\nKai attends Yamamoto's inspection of Yamato two months after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Kai — knowing the ship's sacrificial fate — cannot join in the jubilation.\nCast\n* Masaki Suda as Lt.
