The program was heard on the Sirius XM Public Radio station at XM channel 121 and Sirius channel 205, and was also available on [https://web.archive.org/web/20080807160512/http://xmro.xmradio.com/ XM Radio Online] and [http://www.sirius.com/siriusinternetradio Sirius Internet Radio].\nDescription and history\nThe show's host and namesake, Bob Edwards, was a Peabody Award-winning member of the National Radio Hall of Fame. Edwards was once the co-host of National Public Radio's All Things Considered and hosted NPR's Morning Edition for \"nearly 25 years\" from the first episode to April 30, 2004 when he was reassigned to another position within NPR, despite email objections from more than 50,000 listeners. Edwards left his new assignment almost immediately, as Hugh Panero, CEO of XM Radio, offered Edwards a daily show.\nThe Bob Edwards Show continued the tradition of interviewing interesting people in all walks of life that Edwards exemplified on Morning Edition, but now in long form. Edwards told the NewsHour with Jim Lehrers Terrance Smith, \"The longest interview I could do on the air for Morning Edition was eight minutes. Now I can interview someone for up to an hour. So it's a freer, more open, more relaxed and enjoyable conversation. The program's really about conversation.\" The show's first broadcast was on October 4, 2004, staffed by experienced public radio veterans. The first program included weekly political commentator Washington Post columnist David S. Broder, USA Today Supreme Court reporter Joan Biskupic, former CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite, and Eugene Robinson, author of Last Dance in Havana. Additional guests included US President Jimmy Carter, activist Ralph Nader, historian Simon Schama, journalist Mike Wallace, musician Bonnie Raitt, and basketball coach Phil Jackson.\nSirius XM Radio also produced the compilation program Bob Edwards Weekend, distributed by Public Radio International for use by \"terrestrial\" public radio stations. It premiered on January 7–8, 2006, consisting of re-edited interviews from the weekday program.\nThe show's last live episode aired on September 26, 2014. Public Radio International, which paid Sirius XM to broadcast the show on weekends, continued to air reruns, but no longer does.\nAwards and recognition\nIn 2006, interviews with musicians earned The Bob Edwards Show the Deems Taylor Award from ASCAP. The program received a Gabriel Award from the Catholic Academy for Communication Arts Professionals (CACAP) for an interview with Father Gregory Boyle, a Jesuit priest who works with Latino gang members in east Los Angeles. The show earned its second Gabriel Award in 2007 for Exploding Heritage, a documentary about mountaintop removal coal mining in Appalachia. Exploding Heritage also received the National Press Club's Robert L. Kozic Award for environmental reporting, a New York Festivals Gold World Medal for best program on the environment, and an award from the Society of Environmental Journalists.\nIn 2008, the show received an Edward R. Murrow Award from the Radio-Television News Directors Association and a New York Festivals/United Nations Gold Award for a documentary, The Invisible: Children Without Homes. The documentary also was honored by the Journalism Center on Children and Families and by the CACAP. In 2009, the show received a Sigma Delta Chi Award from the Society of Professional Journalists for the documentary Stories from Third Med: Surviving a Jungle ER. The documentary also earned the show its third Gabriel Award. In 2013, Bob's program was awarded a Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award for the documentary, An Occupational Hazard: Rape in the Military.\nPersonnel\nHost\n*Bob Edwards (2004–2014)\nExecutive producer\n* Mark Schramm (2004–2005)\n* Tish Valva (2005–2007)\n* Steve Lickteig (2007–2011)\n* Ed McNulty (2011–2014)\nProduction staff\nSource:\n*Dan Bloom\n*Chad Campbell\n*Andy Danyo Kubis\n*Ed McNulty\n*Cristy Meiners\n*Ariana Pekary\n*Geoffrey Redick\n*Shelley Tillman\n*Kim Dawson\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061110041438/http://www.xmradio.com/onxm/features/bob-edwards-show.xmc Official website] (archived) at xmradio.com\n* [http://www.bobedwardsradio.com/ Bob Edwards Radio]\n* [http://www.bobedwards.info/ Discussion forum for The Bob Edwards Show] at BobEdwards.info — includes complete calendar of guests to date, staff bios, and photos\n* [http://www.bobedwards.info/bio.php Bob Edwards Biography] at BobEdwards.info"
