Voters chose 15 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nMassachusetts voted for the National Republican candidate, incumbent president John Quincy Adams, over the Democratic candidate, Andrew Jackson. Adams won Massachusetts by a landslide margin of 60.97%.\nWith 76.36% of the popular vote, Adams' home state would prove to be his second strongest victory in the 1828 election after neighboring Rhode Island. This would be the last election until 1976 that the incumbent president lost reelection but won his home state.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1828 United States presidential election in Massachusetts\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#F0F071; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | National Republican\n| John Quincy Adams (incumbent)\n| align=\"right\" | 29,836\n| align=\"right\" | 76.36%\n| align=\"right\" | 15\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic\n| Andrew Jackson\n| align=\"right\" | 6,012\n| align=\"right\" | 15.39%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#c0c0c0; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | N/A\n| Other\n| align=\"right\" | 3,226\n| align=\"right\" | 8.26%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | Totals\n| align=\"right\" | 39,074\n| align=\"right\" | 100.0%\n| align=\"right\" | 15\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Massachusetts\nReferences"
