In the , Gilberton had a population of 31 people.\nGeography\nThe land is flat and low-lying, being less than  above sea level. It is well-watered by a number of creeks. Most of the land use is growing sugarcane with a small area of grazing on native vegetation in the west of the locality.\nDemographics\nIn the , Gilberton had a population of 25 people.\nIn the , Gilberton had a population of 31 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Gilberton. The nearest government primary schools are Woongoolba State School in neighbouring Woongoolba to the east, Ormeau State School in Pimpama to the south, and Norfolk Village State School in neighbouring Ormeau to the south-east. The nearest government secondary schools are Beenleigh State High School in Beenleigh to north-east and Ormeau Woods State High School in neighbouring Ormeau to the south-east.\nAmenities\nThere are a number of parks in the area, including:\n* Goldmine Park ()\n* Prairie Reserve ()\nEnvironmental issues\nGilberton has acid sulphate soil in naturally water-logged conditions. The lowering of the water table due to drainage work on the Pimpama River allows oxidisation of the iron sulfide to create sulphuric acid which can, in turn, enable the release of iron, aluminium and other heavy metals, doing damage to both the natural and built environment. Application of lime to neutralise low pH levels and the maintenance of broad shallow drains to reduce oxidisation are used to mitigate the problem.\nCoomera Connector\nThe Coomera Connector will connect Gold Coast suburbs from Coomera to Carrara with a multi-modal urban arterial road by 2031. It is proposed to reserve a land corridor from Coomera to Stapylton for future extensions; on current plans, this land corridor will pass through Gilberton near the confluence of Sandy Creek and Halfway Creek.\nReferences"
