The only defunct jurisdiction without proper current successor see, Diocese of Bikoro, is nevertheless preserved in its heir Mbandaka-Bikoro's title.\nThere is an Apostolic Nunciature to the Democratic Republic of Congo as papal diplomatic representation (embassy-level), in the national capital Kinshasa.\nCurrent Latin dioceses\nEcclesiastical Province of Bukavu\n* Metropolitan Archdiocese of Bukavu\n**Diocese of Butembo-Beni\n**Diocese of Goma\n**Diocese of Kasongo\n**Diocese of Kindu\n**Diocese of Uvira\nEcclesiastical Province of Kananga\n* Metropolitan Archdiocese of Kananga\n**Diocese of Kabinda\n**Diocese of Kole\n**Diocese of Luebo\n**Diocese of Luiza\n**Diocese of Mbujimayi\n**Diocese of Mweka\n**Diocese of Tshilomba\n**Diocese of Tshumbe\nEcclesiastical Province of Kinshasa\n* Metropolitan Archdiocese of Kinshasa\n**Diocese of Boma\n**Diocese of Idiofa\n**Diocese of Inongo\n**Diocese of Kenge\n**Diocese of Kikwit\n**Diocese of Kisantu\n**Diocese of Matadi\n**Diocese of Popokabaka\nEcclesiastical Province of Kisangani\n* Metropolitan Archdiocese of Kisangani\n**Diocese of Bondo\n**Diocese of Bunia\n**Diocese of Buta\n**Diocese of Doruma-Dungu\n**Diocese of Isangi\n**Diocese of Isiro-Niangara\n**Diocese of Mahagi-Nioka\n**Diocese of Wamba\nEcclesiastical Province of Lubumbashi\n* Metropolitan Archdiocese of Lubumbashi\n**Diocese of Kalemie-Kirungu\n**Diocese of Kamina\n**Diocese of Kilwa-Kasenga\n**Diocese of Kolwezi\n**Diocese of Kongolo\n**Diocese of Manono\n**Diocese of Sakania-Kipushi\nEcclesiastical Province of Mbandaka-Bikoro\n* Metropolitan Archdiocese of Mbandaka-Bikoro\n**Diocese of Basankusu\n**Diocese of Bokungu-Ikela\n**Diocese of Budjala\n**Diocese of Lisala\n**Diocese of Lolo\n**Diocese of Molegbe\nSee also\n* Catholic Church in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\n* List of Catholic dioceses (structured view)\nSources and external links\n* [http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/country/CD.htm GCatholic.org - date for all sections].\n* [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/country/cd.html Catholic-Hierarchy entry]."
