Henry C. Nicking, who was a barber, had this house built in 1854.  It is one of the oldest houses in the city, and one of a very few that was constructed using sandstone.  The general architectural style is a stripped-down version of the Greek Revival style, but a rear addition gives it a saltbox appearance. It features a symmetrical facade, side gable roof,    limestone lintels and window sills, and cornice returns on the front.  The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.\nReferences"
