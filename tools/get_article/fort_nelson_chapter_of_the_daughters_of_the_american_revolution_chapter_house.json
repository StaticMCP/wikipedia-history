It was built in 1935, and is a -story, Colonial Revival style frame building.  The building appears much like a 20th-century adaptation of a wood-frame Tidewater House.  It features a central entrance sheltered by a Classical overhang supported by scrolled brackets.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.\nReferences"
