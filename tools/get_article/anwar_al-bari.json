      "text": "# Anwar al-Bari\n\nAnwar al-Bari sharh Sahih al-Bukhari () is a 19-volume Urdu commentary on Sahih al-Bukhari. It was compiled by Ahmad Rida Bijnori, drawing from the teachings of Anwar Shah Kashmiri. This commentary features the original Arabic text of Sahih al-Bukhari alongside a literal Urdu translation, enhancing its accessibility to a wider audience. It provides biographical information about hadith scholars and narrators in the transmission chains, as well as delves into various facets of Islamic jurisprudence and theology. The work extensively defends the validity of the Hanafi school of jurisprudence. The compiler, however, only completed the commentary up to the end of the Book of Prayer, accompanied by a discussion on the final chapter concerning Imaan (faith) and Tawhid (monotheism).\nBackground\nAhmad Rida Bijnori's educational journey from 1923 to 1926 took him to Darul Uloom Deoband, where he specialized in the study of Hadith under the guidance of Anwar Shah Kashmiri. This period marked a significant closeness between him and his mentor. In 1929, he actively participated in the activities of Jamia Islamia Talimuddin and continued his service there until 1932. Throughout this period, he transcribed Anwar Shah Kashmiri's teachings. The original Urdu manuscript was then handed over to Anwar Shah Kashmiri for a thorough review and, later, it found its way into publication in eight volumes by Maktab-i-Nashir al-'Ulum in Deoband.\nFeatures\nThe inaugural volume of this literary creation spans 240 pages. This volume includes concise biographical portrayals of approximately 150 Hadith Scholars. In the second volume, the narrative shifts toward the biography of Muhammad al-Bukhari, unveiling succinct biographical depictions of those integral to the chain of narrators in the realm of Hadith transmission.\nIn this work, readers will find the inclusion of the original Arabic text of Sahih al-Bukhārī, coupled with a literal Urdu translation thoughtfully designed to make the contents more accessible to a diverse readership. The compiler's methodology transcends the confines of Anwar Shah Kashmiri's guidance and insights. It embraces the collective wisdom of Deobandi scholars such as Hussain Ahmad Madani and Shabbir Ahmad Usmani, infusing the composition with a richer tapestry of knowledge.\nThe exploration of scholarly viewpoints pertaining to the scientific and Hadith skills of Abu Hanifa forms a core theme, substantiated by a compelling and articulate defense of these perspectives. The work elaborates on various facets of Abu Hanifa's scholarly and Hadith expertise while simultaneously offering an astute analysis of the viewpoints and assessments put forth by distinguished scholars. This exposition is grounded in unambiguous and rigorous evidence. Additionally, this work delves into in-depth discussions on a myriad of issues, coupled with the occasional critique of divergent jurisprudential perspectives. Scholarly engagement with alternative legal schools is also a recurrent feature.\nReception\nMohd Kaleem, a doctoral candidate at Aligarh Muslim University, has remarked that this book serves as a crucial resource for students of Hadith. What sets it apart is its comprehensive explanations, which also lend it the character of a substantial reference work. The commentary on Bukhari Sharif exemplifies the unwavering commitment of Deoband scholars to the study of Hadith and its associated disciplines.\nSee also\n* Deobandi hadith studies\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n* Anwar al-Bari sharh Sahih al-Bukhari at Internet Archive"
