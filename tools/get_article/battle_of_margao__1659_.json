The battle resulted in a decisive victory for the Portuguese.\nBackground\nIn the 1650s, the Dutch East India Company developed friendly ties with the Sultanate of Bijapur and encouraged it to attack Portuguese holdings in India. In 1654, Abdulla Hakim, with Dutch support, led an invasion into the Portuguese territories of Bardes and briefly put the supply of food into Goa in jeopardy, however, the forces of Bijapur were repelled.\nFollowing this conflict, treaties were reaffirmed between the Sultanate and Kingdom of Portugal in 1655. However, in 1659, Ali Adil Shah II again attempted to recapture Portuguese territories in Goa, launching another invasion led by Abdulla Hakim into the Velhas Conquistas.\nThe Battle\nIn 1659, Abdulla Hakim led the Bijapur forces into the Velhas Conquistas. However, Luís de Mendonça Furtado responded the invasion with an expedition to Margão. The Bijapur forces were defeated, suffering between 400 and 500 casualties, and they were forced to retreat. Ali Adil Shah II temporarily abandoned his efforts to seize Portuguese territories in Goa.\nSee also\n*Portuguese India\n*Adil Shahi–Portuguese conflicts\nReferences"
