It was centered on Ōtawara Castle in what is now part of the city of Ōtawara, Tochigi. Ōtawara was ruled through all of its history by the Ōtawara clan.\nHistory\nThe Ōtawara clan was a branch of the Nasu clan, and was one of the seven Gōzoku samurai bands of the Nasu region of northern Shimotsuke Province. In 1590, when Toyotomi Hideyoshi called upon the Nasu clan to assist in his plan to destroy the Hōjō clan at the Battle of Odawara, the Nasu refused his summons; however, Ōtawara Harukiyo went against his overlord and pledged allegiance to Hideyoshi. In return, he was awarded a 7,000 koku holding.  In 1600, Ōtawara Harukiyo pledged his forces to Tokugawa Ieyasu and fought a rear-guard action against the Uesugi clan while Ieyasu was at the Battle of Sekigahara. In return for this action, he was awarded another 5,000 koku and was thus admitted into the ranks of the daimyō.\nThe Ōtawara continued to rule these holdings until the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate. The 3rd daimyō, Ōtawara Takakiyo, gave 1,000 koku to his younger brother, reducing the domain to 11,000 koku. During the Bakumatsu period, the 12th daimyō, Ōtawara Hirokiyo, established a domain academy. The final daimyō, Ōtawara Kazukiyo sided with the imperial forces in the Boshin War, and his castle attacked by pro-Tokugawa Aizu Domain in May 1868.\nAfter the Meiji restoration, he was made a viscount (shishaku) in the kazoku peerage system.\nAfter the abolition of the han system in July 1871, Ōtawara Domain became part of Tochigi Prefecture.\nThe domain had a population of 12,535 people in 2397 households, of which 608 were samurai per a census in 1870.\nHoldings at the end of the Edo period\nAs with most domains in the han system, Ōtawara Domain consisted of several discontinuous territories calculated to provide the assigned kokudaka, based on periodic cadastral surveys and projected agricultural yields.\n*Shimotsuke Province\n**1 villages in Tsuga District\n**7 villages in Haga District\n**58 villages in Nasu District\n**13 villages in Shioya District\nList of daimyō\n{| class=wikitable\n! #||Name || Tenure || Courtesy title || Court Rank || kokudaka\n|-\n|colspan=6 | Ōtawara clan (tozama) 1600-1871\n|-\n||1||||1842–1858|| Bizen-no-kami (備前守)|| Junior 5th Rank, Lower Grade (従五位下)||12,000 koku\n|-\n|2||||1858–1871||Bizen-no-kami (備前守)|| Junior 5th Rank, Lower Grade (従五位下)||12,000 koku\n|-\n||3||||1842–1858|| Yamashiro-no-kami (山城守)|| Junior 5th Rank, Lower Grade (従五位下)||12,000 ->11,000 koku\n|-\n|4||||1858–1871||Bizen-no-kami (備前守)||Junior 5th Rank, Lower Grade (従五位下)||11,000 koku\n|-\n|5||||1858–1871||Izumi-no-kami (泉守)|| Junior 5th Rank, Lower Grade (従五位下)||11,000 koku\n|-\n||6||||1842–1858|| Bizen-no-kami (備前守)|| Junior 5th Rank, Lower Grade (従五位下)||11,000 koku\n|-\n|7||||1858–1871||Hida-no-kami (飛騨守)|| Junior 5th Rank, Lower Grade (従五位下)||11,000 koku\n|-\n|8||||1858–1871||Izumo-no-kami (出雲守)|| Junior 5th Rank, Lower Grade (従五位下)||11,000 koku\n|-\n|9||||1858–1871||Yamashiro-no-kami (山城守)|| Junior 5th Rank, Lower Grade (従五位下)|| 11,000 koku\n|-\n||10||||1842–1858||Yamashiro-no-kami (山城守)|| Junior 5th Rank, Lower Grade (従五位下)|| 11,000 koku\n|-\n|11||||1858–1871||Hida-no-kami (飛騨守)|| Junior 5th Rank, Lower Grade (従五位下)||11,000 koku\n|-\n|12||||1858–1871||Izumo-no-kami (出雲守)|| Junior 5th Rank, Lower Grade (従五位下)||11,000 koku\n|-\n|13||||1858–1871||Hida-no-kami (飛騨守)|| Junior 5th Rank, Lower Grade (従五位下)||11,000 koku\n|-\n|14||||1858–1871||Hida-no-kami (飛騨守)|| Junior 5th Rank, Lower Grade (従五位下)||11,000 koku\n|}\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~me4k-skri/han/kantou/ootawara.html   Ōtawara on \"Edo 300 HTML\"]\nNotes"
