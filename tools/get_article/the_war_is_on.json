The video is set in a large office building in Tokyo where all the workers wear a creepy mask, which are akin to that of which is worn by Michael Myers in the Halloween films. As the song progresses, the band members are individually surrounded by a whole room worth of workers wearing these masks around a circular table which surrounds the band members one by one, as if they are about to be interrogated. As the song culminates, the band defies the group of cult-like workers by jamming the rest of the song in the room as it turns to darkness.\nAs of October 2025, the music videos for \"The War Is On\" has a cumulative total of over 2.3 million views on YouTube.\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\nColdrain\n* Masato Hayakawa – lead vocals, lyricist, programming\n* Ryo Yokochi – lead guitar, programming, composition\n* Kazuya Sugiyama – rhythm guitar, programming\n* Ryo Shimizu – bass guitar\n* Katsuma Minatani – drums, percussion\nAdditional personnel\n* David Bendeth – producer, mixing, arrangement\n* Ted Jensen – mastering\n* Brian Robbins – audio engineer, mixing engineer, editing\n* Michael Milan – electronic programming, engineer, editing\n* John Bender – engineer, vocals, vocal arrangements\n* Dan Graziano – editing\n* Mike Lisa – editing\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Release history and formats for \"The War Is On\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Region\n!scope=\"col\"|Date\n!scope=\"col\"|Format\n!scope=\"col\"|Label\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Japan\n| 25 July 2013\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|VAP\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| International\n| 13 May 2014\n|\n|}\nReferences"
