She was the wife of the river-god Scamander,  and a principal ancestor of the royal house of Troy.\nAccording to Diodorus Siculus, and the mythographer Apollodorus, she was the mother, by Scamander, of Teucer, who was the first to rule as a king over the region known later as Troy. In addition to a son, Apollodorus goes on to mention two daughters of Scamander, presumably also by Idaea, Callirrhoe and Strymo.  Callirrhoe became the wife of Tros, the eponymous hero of Troy and the Trojans. and Strymo, the wife of Laomedon the king of Troy, and father of Priam the king of Troy during the Trojan War.\nNotes\nReferences\n* Apollodorus, Apollodorus, The Library, with an English Translation by Sir James George Frazer, F.B.A., F.R.S. in 2 Volumes, Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press, London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1921. .
