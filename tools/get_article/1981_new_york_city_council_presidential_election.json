Velella.\nDemocratic primary\nCandidates\n*Carol Bellamy, incumbent Council President since 1978\nResults\nBellamy was unopposed in the September primary, and her name did not appear on the ballot. Manhattan Borough President Andrew Stein and his primary opponent David Dinkins both sought to tie themselves to the popular Bellamy.\nGeneral election\nCandidates\n* Carol Bellamy, incumbent Council President since 1978 (Democratic and Liberal)\n* Margaret T. Chiffriller, cook and housekeeper at Queen of Peace Roman Catholic Church in Kew Gardens Hills (Right to Life)\n* Guy Velella, Assemblyman from the Bronx (Republican and Conservative)\nCampaign\nBellamy, who won the presidency in an upset in the 1977 election, was broadly popular in 1981. Before even announcing her re-election bid, she stated, \"I make no bones about wanting to run for Governor someday,\" and was critical of Governor Hugh Carey. The New York Times framed her campaign as a springboard to future statewide office. Villela conceded that his campaign was \"a long shot\", but claimed that Bellamy should be doing more to utilize the ombudsman responsibilities of the presidency.\nMargaret T. Chiffriller, running on the Right to Life ticket, ran a single-issue advocacy campaign focused on opposition to abortion.}}\nReferences"
