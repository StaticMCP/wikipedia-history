Among other roles, she carried coolies between India and Trinidad. She was wrecked c.1865.\nCareer\nEliza Stewart first appeared in ''Lloyd's Register in 1845 with Henderson, master, Stewart & Co., owners, and trade Newport–Ceylon\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Eliza Stewart would have ridden out the typhoon but the British iron bark John Laird drifted against her and drove her against Dos Hermanos. Eliza Stewart was so damaged that she had to discharge her cargo of sugar for Shanghae to effect repairs.\nEliza Stewart carried coolies from India to Trinidad in three voyages. She left Calcutta prior to 5 February 1851 with 159 men, 12 women, and seven children and infants, for a total of 178 persons. She landed 176 on 23 April.\nEliza Stewart also carried coolies from Trinidad back to India when their five-year terms of indenture were up. A bounty scheme gave the immigrants $50 if they extended their term in Trinidad by five years. Although most Indians brought over remained in Trinidad, some would return home with substantial savings. On 31 May 1851 Eliza Stewart carried 20 back to Calcutta. The fare was £20 per person: £10 for Trinidad to Greenock, and £10 for Greenock to Calcutta.\nEliza Steward arrived at Trinidad again on 30 April 1852 with 183 immigrants, three having died on the voyage. Lastly, on 13 May 1853 Eliza Stewart landed 214 immigrants, six having died on the voyage.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Master\n! Owner\n! Trade\n| Home port\n!
