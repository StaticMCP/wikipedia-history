His 1850 opponent, former State Representative Peter F. Causey, ran as the American Party candidate, and faced former Kent County Sheriff William Burton, the Democratic nominee. Causey ultimately defeated Burton by a slim, but decisive, margin.\nGeneral election\nResults\nReferences\nBibliography\n* }}\n*\n*\n* Delaware House Journal, 65th General Assembly, 1st Reg. Sess.
