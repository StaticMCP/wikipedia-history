Owner of the restaurant is the Levi Lassen Foundation.\nHistory\nIn 1912, vegetarian hotel-restaurant Pomona opened on the Molenstraat. Some years later, it changed its name to Parkhotel. By then the hotel had made her name with the famous restaurant Queens Garden. After the purchase of the adjacent \"Hotel De Zalm\", in 1968, the name was changed into Parkhotel De Zalm. During the extensive renovation in 1986, the name was reverted to Parkhotel. That renovation also signalled the end of the former Queens Garden/Queens Room when the restaurant was split into two rooms: \"Garden Room\" and \"Park Room\".\nSee also\n*List of Michelin starred restaurants in the Netherlands\nReferences"
