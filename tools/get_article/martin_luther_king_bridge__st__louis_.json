Opened in 1951, the bridge serves as traffic relief connecting the concurrent freeways of Interstate 55, Interstate 64, and U.S. Route 40 with the downtown streets of St. Louis. It was renamed for King in 1968 after the national civil rights leader was assassinated that year.\nHistory\nThe bridge was built across the Mississippi River in 1951 as the '''Veterans' Memorial Bridge''' to relieve congestion on the MacArthur Bridge to the south. Built as a toll bridge, it was owned by the City of East St. Louis. At one time, it carried U.S. Route 40 and U.S. Route 66 across the river. In 1967, the bridge fell into disrepair after the (free) Poplar Street Bridge was completed; traffic moved to the new bridge, resulting in declining toll revenues needed for maintenance. In the 21st century, it is considered an important contributor to satisfying the transportation needs of the region and enhancing the ambiance of the historic St. Louis riverfront.\nEventually, ownership was transferred dually to the Missouri and Illinois departments of transportation. The bridge was renamed after Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, after the national civil rights leader's April 1968 assassination in Memphis, Tennessee.\nIn 1987, the states removed the toll for travel across the bridge.\nA bi-state project for about $24 million to renovate the bridge, at the behest of local civic and government leaders, was carried out in the late 1980s.\nIn the spring of 1989, the rebuilt bridge was reopened.\nIn June 1990, the lighting of the bridge was completed by the St. Louis Port Authority.\nOn October 12, 2009, the bridge was closed in order to reduce the old four-lane configuration down to three wider lanes, install a waterproofing membrane over the bridge surface, and to install a concrete barrier to separate eastbound traffic from westbound. Over the previous six years, there had been 38 serious accidents, including several involving fatalities. The $1.4 million project was aimed at eliminating these head-on collisions in the future. The bridge re-opened on October 21, 2009.\nAfter the new Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge opened in February 2014 across the river, daily traffic volume on the King bridge had decreased by 40% by April 2014 to 12,700 daily. This was one of the goals of construction of the new bridge: to distribute traffic more widely among the bridges and associated roadways, improving traffic patterns.\nIn October 2018, the bridge was closed to all traffic to allow an extensive rehabilitation project to take place. Among other things, this project would replace the deck surface and put a fresh coat of pavement on the roadway, as well as replacing the extensively deteriorated eastern approach spans, and repainting the entire bridge. The bridge was originally expected to reopen to traffic in January 2019. However, due to flooding, the date of reopening was pushed to summer of 2020. The bridge eventually reopened on August 19, 2020.\nGallery\nFile:MLK Memorial Bridge.jpg|The bridge in 2004\nFile:Martin Luther King Bridge from Lacledes Landing, Sep 2012.jpg|The bridge in 2012\nFile:I-70 in downtown St. Louis.jpg|The interchange between Interstate 44 and the bridge, in the middleground\nRoute 799\nThe Missouri half of the bridge is designated as unsigned Route 799 by the Missouri Department of Transportation.\nSee also\n* List of crossings of the Upper Mississippi River\n* McKinley Bridge\n* Eads Bridge\n* Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://bridges.midwestplaces.com/mo/st-louis-city/king/ Bridge info] at Historic Bridges of the Midwest.\n*[https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=38.631287,-90.179&spn=0.025311,0.041757&t=h maps.google.com] zoomed in, hybrid mode"
