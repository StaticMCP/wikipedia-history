As a result of a long struggle, the Persians finally defeated the Romans and captured Armenia.\nBackground\nAs a result of the previous war (572–591), the Sassanids lost most of the lands in the Caucasus, and rolled back to the east. However, Byzantine enterprises emptied the treasury, and besides, a crisis began in the country due to the murder of Maurice and usurpation of power by the Phocas. Armenia was supposed to become the main theater of military operations at the beginning of the war, since it had a complex geography and a strong system of forts, besides, the Persians needed to return the territory that had previously been taken away by Byzantium.\nInvasion\nIn 603, the Sassanids invaded with large forces on the territory of Byzantium, the first point was the city of Dara, which fell in 605. The Iranian commander Dzuan Veh wanted to continue his success, but was defeated in a battle with the Romans near Yerevan. At the same time, the Roman commander Germanus also died as a result of an unfortunate skirmish near the city of Constantine. Already in 605, the Persians were able to inflict another decisive defeat on the Greeks by massacring the captured camp. Over the next few years, neither side could gain a foothold in the territory, until finally, the Persians inflicted two defeats on the Romans at Theodopolis, and after a while they forced the city to surrender. By 610, all of Armenia had been conquered by the Sassanids. Their success was accompanied by the fact that the best Roman commander Narses rebelled against Phocas and supported the Iranians.\nAftermath\nAll attempts to stop the Persians were in vain, they took a break only when they reached a certain peak of possible conquests, located near Chalcedon, which was located a few miles from Constantinople. In the future, Byzantium will try to go on the offensive, but it will suffer a serious defeat in Battle of Antioch (613) and begin to lose territories again. Until by the 620s, he will not recover and will not be able to inflict a number of severe defeats on the Persians.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\nNotes"
