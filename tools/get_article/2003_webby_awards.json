      "text": "# 2003 Webby Awards\n\nThe 7th Annual Webby Awards were held in San Francisco, California on June 5, 2003. Due to budget cutbacks made in response to the 2002 Internet bubble, the decision was made to hold this year's ceremony partially online. This would be the last year that the Webbys would be presented in California prior to their relocation in New York City. For this award ceremony, the business category was expanded with the addition of a new award for \"Best Online Businesses.\" This award would be presented for \"sites that excel at achieving fundamental business goals such as increasing sales lead generation or enhancing customer loyalty and retention, marketplace impact and innovation.\"\nNominees and winners\n:(from [https://web.archive.org/web/20140429062637/http://www.webbyawards.com/winners/2003])\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
