The forces of an alliance of Irish led by the High King Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair defeated an Anglo-Norman expedition led by the Earl Richard \"Strongbow\" de Clare and forced the English army to retreat.\nAccording to the Annals of the Four Masters (English translation):\nM1174.10\nThe Earl led an army to plunder Munster; King Roderic marched with another army to defend it against them. When the English had heard of Roderic's arrival in Munster, for the purpose of giving them battle, they solicited to their assistance the Galls Ostmen of Dublin; and these made no delay till they came to Thurles. Thither came Donnell O'Brien and the Dalcassians, the battalion of West Connaught, the great battalion of the Sil-Murray, besides numerous other good troops left there by the King, Roderic. A brave battle was fought between the English and Irish at this place, in which the English were finally defeated by dint of fighting. Seventeen hundred of the English were slain in this battle, and only a few of them survived with the Earl, who proceeded in sorrow to his house at Waterford. O'Brien returned home in triumph.\nMichael Hogan (1828–1899), an Irish poet, known as the “Bard of Thomond” described the Irish victory at Thurles as follows:\nThe war-fires light gleamed red all night, along the mountain gloom.\nKing Dónal’s men are up again, from Limerick to Slieve Bloom.\nFrom glen and wood, the bone and blood of his fierce and fearless clan,\nIn wild array, at dawn of day, o’er Ormond’s plains swept on.\nFrom Waterford the Norman hoarde to the plains of Ikerrin came.\nIn vengeful haste the land to waste with sword and destroying flame.\nLeft and right with sweeping might, the headlong hosts engaged\nAnd life ne’er bled, in a strife so red, while that combat of bloodhounds raged.\nBut as the heave of the mad sea wave is barred by the crag filled shore,\nSo that iron tide, on Durlas’s side, was stopped by King Donald Mór.\nThere’s revelry high and boisterous joy from Cashel to Shannon’s shore,\nAnd Luimneach waits to open the gates, for her conquering Donald Mór.\nReferences"
