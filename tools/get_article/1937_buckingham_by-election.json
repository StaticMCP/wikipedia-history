He had been headmaster at Wolverton County Secondary School. He had been Chairman of the constituency Liberal association and had been elected as the association's President. He was an executive member of the Home Counties Liberal Federation.\nResult\nThe result was a victory for the Conservative candidate John Whiteley, who was elected with a majority of over 5,000 votes.  Whiteley died in office six years later, triggering another by-election.\nSee also\n* List of United Kingdom by-elections\n* Buckingham constituency\n* 1943 Buckingham by-election\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*"
