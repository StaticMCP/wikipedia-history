It was the first modern municipal election in Warsaw, as well as the first local election in Poland after the Russian retreat. The electorate was divided into six curiae, each with 15 seats in the council. As a pre-electoral pact was reached for four out of the six curiae, voting was held only in the Third Curia (intellectuals) and the Sixth Curia (general public). In the Sixth Curia, to which most voters belonged, the winners were the National Democracy on the Polish side and the Folkists on the Jewish side. Per Jesse Kaufmann (2015) \"the election brought to the fore the question of Polish-Jewish relations and triggered an attempt on part of the occupiers to limit Jewish influence while maintaining a facade of strict impartiality\".\nBackground\nOn July 1, 1915, the German authorities issued call for convening City Councils in occupied Poland based on Prussian model, to replace system of Citizens Committees put in place under Russian rule. On August 6, 1915, the  overtook functions of the city government. The Warsaw Citizens Committee eventually approached the German authorities asking for elections, and on March 23, 1916, the German occupation authorities agreed that the Citizens Committee would be replaced by an elected City Council.\nFurthermore, during the spring of 1916, the city boundaries of Warsaw were expanded with suburbs being integrated into the city – on the Vistula River left bank; Czerniaków, Siekierki, Szopy, Mokotów, Ochota, Czyste, Wola, Koło, Powązki, Bielany, Marymont, Buraków and Słodowiec, on the right bank; Golędzinów, Żerań, Szmulowizna, Bródno, Pelcowizna, Targówek, Kawęczyn, Grochów, Saska Kępa, Kamionek and Gocławek. Through the incorporation of these areas into the city, the area of Warsaw grew from 32.75 square kilometres to 114.83 square kilometres. Under German rule, the city was divided into 26 militia commissariat districts.\nCitizens Committee draft ordinance\nThe Warsaw Citizens Committee held several extraordinary meetings in April 1916, to discuss a draft electoral ordinance for the City Council election. The most extensive of these meetings occurred on April 16, 1916. At the meeting Piotr Drzewiecki called for a fixed quota for Jewish members of the City Council, to avoid a potential Jewish majority. Zdzisław Lubomirski, installed by the German authorities as mayor of Warsaw, called for measures to restrict the  numbers of Jews that could participate in the election in order to guarantee the Polish character of the City Council. Others criticized Lubomirski's propositions, stating that such measures would cause embarrassment to Poland internationally. Samuel Dickstein, a Jewish assimilationist, rejected the argument that Jews would constitute a unified political bloc. In the end the proposals calling for restricting Jewish participation were voted down with 8 votes in favour, 15 against and 1 abstention.\nPrussian electoral system and voter registry\nThe German occupation authorities ultimately rejected the Warsaw Citizens Committee April 1916 draft electoral ordinance, and instead opted for an electoral ordinance based on the Prussian system of separate and unequal curiae. On May 28, 1916, the German occupation authorities issued a bulletin with the provisions for the election of the Warsaw City Council. The electoral regulation mixed a system of curiae with proportional election (except in the Third Curia). The new City Council would have 90 seats. Candidates had to be men over the age of 30 years, with \"spotless moral and political reputation\" and fluent Polish language skills. Voting rights were given to men aged over 25 years. Moreover, a small number of wealthy and educated women were given the right to vote, albeit only through a male proxy. The German authorities divided the voters into six curiae, with each of the curiae being allotted 15 seats in the City Council. On June 4, 1916, Warsaw residents began entering their names in electoral rolls of the six curiae. Initially interest in the election was low, but the electoral campaign soon captured the attention of the city. All in all by late June 1916, there were a total of 82,223 registered voters.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=2|Curia\n!Number of registered voters\n!% of registered voters\n|-\n|First Curia\n|Real estate owners (landlords)\n|5,674\n|6.90%\n|-\n|Second Curia\n|Trade or industrial license (patent) payers, i.e. representatives of heavy industry and large commercial concerns\n|1,283\n|1.56%\n|-\n|Third Curia\n|Intellectuals, subdivided into six groups – 1st group – Roman Catholic clergy (1 seat), 2nd group – lawyers (3 seats), 3rd group – tutors, teachers and school inspectors (3 seats, with one of the seats reserved for faculty of Warsaw University), 4th group – physicians, dentists, veterinarians and pharmacists (3 seats), 5th group – engineers and technicians with higher education (3 seats, with one seat reserved for faculty of Warsaw Technical College), 6th group – students and others with higher education who did not belong to any of the other five groups of the Third Curia (2 seats)\n|2,345\n|2.85%\n|-\n|Fourth Curia\n|Trade or industrial license (patent) payers (at a lower rate than 2d Curia members), i.e. representatives of craft-based industries, smaller merchants and small businesses\n|16,050\n|19.52%\n|-\n|Fifth Curia\n|Payers of housing tax in Warsaw (in 1915 and 1916)\n|5,794\n|7.05%\n|-\n|Sixth Curia\n|Registered inhabitants of Warsaw who did not fulfill any of the criteria of the first five Curiae, i.e. the working class\n|51,077\n|62.12%\n|}\nThe city was divided into 52 electoral districts.

In particular the Polish right-wing was worried about the Fourth Curia (merchants and artisans) where Jews were expected to dominate the vote. The announcement of the electoral ordinance prompted a campaign of harsh attacks against Jewish candidates in  (a newspaper linked to National Democracy). The attacks were especially targeted at the assimilationists, questioning their Polish credentials. Gazeta Poranna 2 Grosze was somewhat more conciliatory in its tone towards the Orthodox Jews, arguing that the Orthodox Jews did not get involved in Polish affairs and that they were \"always remembering that this is a Polish country, not a Polish-Jewish country.\"\nThe two Polish committees\nThe Central National Electoral Committee (Centralny Narodowy Komitet Wyborczy, abbreviated 'CNKW'), a coalition of right-wing forces that included the National Democratic Party, National Workers Union, the Christian Democratic Party and independents, called for a City Council that could function as City Parliament and would serve function as a model for the country. As it would be the first elected body in Poland and as the assembly of the Polish capital, they hoped the City Council would be able to function as a national council in the process of moving toward independence.\nAnother bloc was the Central Democratic Electoral Committee (Centralny Demokratyczny Komitet Wyborczy, CDKW), a coalition of leftist and centrist parties of the \"independence camp\". They denounced anti-semitism but their agitation als included anti-Jewish slogans, calling to struggle against the threat posed by \"Litvaks and Jewish social democracy\".\nLaunch of the Association of Jewish Voters\nOn June 14, 1916, the Jewish parties established their own electoral committee, the Association of Jewish Voters. Before the beginning of World War I the Zionists had been the major Jewish faction in the city. But in August 1915, part of the Zionist leadership left the Kingdom of Poland. Weakened after the departure of their leaders, the Warsaw Zionists agreed to making an electoral alliance with other Jewish sectors. The Association of Jewish Voters was formed, including Orthodox Jews, Hasidim, neo-assimilationists and non-partisan independents.\nThe following day, the assimilationists published a proclamation in the press, calling on Warsaw residents to vote according to political views and that a separate Jewish electoral campaign should be avoided, in the name of Polish patriotism. It affirmed that the electoral regulation did not provide for any separate curiae based on nationality. About one hundred individuals signed the appealed, including Samuel Dickstein, , Michał Bergsohn, ,  and .\nPolish-Jewish pact\nLargely, due to efforts by the assimilationists, there was a rapprochement between the Association of Jewish Voters and the Central Democratic Electoral Committee, and the two blocs moved towards a consensus solution on the divisions of City Council seats. Eventually the Central National Electoral Committee got on board as well, and on June 30, 1916, an agreement was reached between the two Polish electoral committees (Central National Electoral Committee and Central Democratic Electoral Committee) and the Association of Jewish Voters. The pact divided the seats in the First, Second, Fourth and Fifth Curiae; 26 seats for the National Electoral Committee, 19 seats for the Democratic Electoral Committee and 15 seats for the Jews (12 to the Association of Jewish Voters and 3 to the Bolesław Eiger group).  --> As the joint Polish-Jewish slate derived from this pact was the sole candidate list in the First, Second, Fourth and Fifth Curiae, no voting was conducted in these Curiae.\nIn these negotiations, the Association of Jewish Voters had settled for a conservative number of Jewish seats. They wanted to avoid a repeat of the aftermath of the 1912 Duma election, which had been used by the National Democracy to spark Polish-Jewish conflict. In 1912, Jews in Warsaw had supported a Polish socialist candidate, and after the election there had been a backlash with boycott of Jewish businesses in the city.\nThe signing of the pact was celebrated with a reception, with the participation of several German Jews from the occupation administration. Jewish press outlets such as Der Hajnt lauded the pact, stating that for the first time Jews were recognized as political partners. On the Polish side, the liberal publication  celebrated the pact as new union of citizens and beginning of harmony between communities. Among the deputies that would be elected from the quota of the Association of Jewish Voters were Zionists (Farbstein, Poznański, Seideman), assimilationists (Eiger, Kirszrot, Weisblat, Natanson), neo-assimilationists (Berenson, Goldflam, Mutermilch), Orthodox (Dawidsohn, Prywes, Wagmajster) and independents (Szereszowski, Truskier).\nSome Jewish national activists perceived the Polish-Jewish pact as a betrayal and decided to contest the Sixth Curia election in order to \"save Jewish honor\". A stormy meeting was held at the premises of the Association of Jewish Writers and Journalists on Tłomackie Street, during which the Jewish Popular Electoral Committee ('Folkskomitet') was founded. The committee was headed by Noach Pryłucki. For the Folkists the real percentage of Jewish voters in the first five curiae were much greater than the proportion of Jewish seats allocated through the Polish-Jewish pact (the Folkists desired that 35% of the City Council seats be allocated to Jews). The Polish-Jewish pact was also rejected by some Orthodox Jews.\nThird Curia election\n) where the Third Curia vote took place July 10-12, 1916]]\n]]\nWhilst there were attempts to agree on compromise candidate lists for the Third Curia, eventually competing candidacies emerged in some groups within the curia. The voting for the elections in the Third Curia was held July 10-12, 1916 at the City Hall (Jabłonowski Palace).\nFirst Group – Catholic Clergy\nThe vote in the Catholic clergy group held under supervision of Imperial Electoral Commissar Jaraczewski on July 12, 1916.

Other candidates in the fray had been Klimek (121 votes) and Sosnowski (12 votes). In the subgroup for faculty at Warsaw University there were 32 registered voters, out of whom 30 voted. University rector Józef Brudziński was elected with 28 votes. One vote was cast for Dean  (who was elected as one of the alternate members, with 32 votes) and one vote was cast for Professor .\nFourth Group – Medical\nOn July 8, 1916, the Democratic Physicians Committee met and agreed to endorse the candidatures of Dr. Witold Chodźko and Dr. Klemens Pawlikowski. In the fourth group (physicians, dentists, veterinarians and pharmacists) the counting of votes cast was completed at 9 p.m. on July 10, 1916. Out of 544 eligible voters, 458 had cast their ballots. Jan Rutkowski was elected from a subgroup of pharmacists, receiving 557 votes. Among the physicians the democratic candidate Dr. Witold Chodźko was elected with 379 votes whilst the national candidate  was elected with 224 votes.

Out of 293 eligible voters, 265 cast their votes. The election in the fifth group was quiet, without competition between different parties. The architect  was elected with 260 votes and the engineer Antoni Ponikowski was elected with 248 votes. The other candidates were the engineer  (19 votes, however he was elected as an alternate member of the City Council with 309 votes), the engineer J. Strassburger (2 votes) and the architect  (1 vote, however he was elected alternate member with 71 votes). In the subgroup of the faculty at Warsaw Technical College there were 11 registered voters, out of whom 10 voted. All 10 votes were cast in favour of the engineer , who was elected deputy.\nSixth Group – Intellectuals\non July 9, 1916]]In the sixth group, which gathered students and other residents with higher education who did not belong to any of the other five groups of the Third Curia, the counting of votes cast was completed at 8 p.m. on July 10, 1916. Out of 591 eligible voters, 466 had cast their ballots. There were three candidate lists for this group – the list of the Central Democratic Electoral Committee with two candidates, the list of Władysław Studnicki which also had a democratic-independence orientation and the list of the Central National Electoral Committee with a single candidate. The democratic candidate Artur Śliwiński was elected with 312 votes. The sole Central National Electoral Committee candidate  was elected with 359 votes. Studnicki got 102 votes and  got 151 votes.\nSixth Curia election\n50,549 Warsaw residents were listed as voters of the Sixth Curia. Six candidate lists were in the fray. The Central Democratic Electoral Committee backed List I of the Polish Socialist Party – Revolutionary Faction (PPS-Frakcja). List II was put forth by the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (SDKPiL, Marxist Social Democracy).\nThe General Jewish Labour Bund formed an electoral bloc together with the Polish Socialist Party – Left (PPS-Lewica). The Bund had encountered some difficulty to draft a list of candidates due to the requirements of age (candidates had to be at least 30 years old) and Polish language fluency. The Bund used the electoral campaign to rally against nationalism and antisemitism, arguing that antisemitism functioned as a tool used by Jewish bourgeois nationalists to defend their class interests. Bund called for Jewish cultural rights, the right to use Yiddish language in interaction with government institutions and recognition of Yiddish schools.  The Poale Zion didn't contest the election but supported the Bund/PPS-Lewica socialist bloc.\nList IV was put forth by the Folkskomitet. Whilst the Folkists opposed the Polish-Jewish pact, they didn't wish to sabotage it as such and thus contested only the Sixth Curia election. The Folkist electoral campaign had a confrontational tone. The Folkist press appeals called on Jewish voters to reject the assimilationists', Zionists' and Orthodox aspirations to illusory peace with the Poles. The newspapers Der Moment and Warszewer Togblat were supportive of Folkist electoral campaign, whilst on the other end of the Jewish political spectrum articles in Der Hajnt repeatedly labelled Pryłucki as an opportunist and a liar.\nList V was the list of the National Workers Committee. List VI was the list of the Association of Jewish Voters, which did not raise Jewish national demands in their electoral campaign (rather supporting equal civil and religious rights in general).\nThe voting days were tumultuous, with many manifestations occurring.  reported that Sixth Curia voters were harassed by political campaigners across the city. Nowa Gazeta wrote that \"[v]ery heated, sometimes passionate agitation is taking place in front of election offices, especially in working-class districts and in districts with a predominant Jewish population. Delegates of various parties distribute their proclamations by the hundreds. Also noteworthy are the large cardboard placards held on sticks. Scouts with the words \"4\" on their caps cause a certain sensation in Jewish districts.\"\nOverall, the voting closed at 8 p.m. on July 14, 1916, but in some instances where voters presented late voting extended by a few minutes. There were two commissions to count the votes and compile the result, one led by Imperial Electoral Commissar Jaraczewski and one led by his deputy Dziembowski. Members of the commissions included Marek Borkowski, Antoni Wysocki, count Roger Łubieński, Wł. Tomaszewski, Adolf Weisblat, Dr. Witold Chodźko, Leonard Tallen-Wilczewski, Goldstein, , Paweł Nowicki, Wł. Śląski and Tomasz Arciszewski. All in all, 36,781 valid votes were cast which represented 72% of the electorate. The invalid votes were around 1,300 in total.\nPryłucki and the Folkskomitet were the big winners among the Jewish parties in the Sixth Curia election. Gazeta Poranna 2 Grosze decried the election result as an 'extreme victory' for Jewish nationalism. The four Folkists elected to the City Council were Pryłucki, Samuel Hirszhorn, B. Efron and the painter Abram Eisenberg. The sole Socialist Bloc candidate elected belonged to PPS-Lewica, leaving the Bund without representation in the City Council.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Results in the election for the Sixth Curia of the Warsaw City Council, 1916\n!List\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats won\n|-\n|List V – National Democracy and allies\n|13,988\n|38.03%\n|7\n|-\n|List IV – Folkskomitet\n|8,611\n|23.41%\n|4\n|-\n|List I – Polish Socialist Party – Revolutionary Faction\n|5,916\n|16.08%\n|2\n|-\n|List III – General Jewish Labour Bund and Polish Socialist Party – Left\n|3,711\n|10.09%\n|1\n|-\n|List II – Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania\n|2,631\n|7.15%\n|1\n|-\n|List VI – Association of Jewish Voters\n|1,924\n|5.23%\n|0\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Results in the Sixth Curia by Electoral District\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed sortable\"\n!
