Kingship in Macedonia, its earliest attested political institution, was hereditary, exclusively male, and characterized by dynastic politics.\nInformation regarding the origins of the Argeads, Macedonia's founding dynasty, is very scarce and often contradictory. The Argeads themselves claimed descent from the royal house of Argos, the Temenids, but this story is viewed with skepticism by some scholars as a fifth century BC fiction invented by the Argead court \"to 'prove' Greek lineage\". It is more likely that the Argeads first surfaced either as part of a tribe living near Mount Bermion who, possibly under the authority of Perdiccas, subjugated neighboring }} or, according to Herodotus, were of a Doric race that originally resided in Pindus. During their reign, Macedonia would not only come to dominate Greece, but also emerge as one of the most powerful states in the ancient world with the conquest of the Persian Empire under Alexander the Great. However, Alexander's untimely death in 323 BC triggered a series of civil wars and regents for his young son Alexander IV, ultimately leading to the Argead dynasty's demise.\nCassander, the ostensible regent of Macedonia, murdered Alexander IV in 310 and installed the Antipatrids as the ruling house. His dynasty was short-lived, however, as his death in 297 triggered a civil war between his sons that further destabilized the kingdom. The following decades saw a rapid and violent succession of Diadochi from various dynasties, each vying for the Macedonian throne. This chaos continued until the death of Pyrrhus in 272 and the accession of the Antigonids under Antigonus II Gonatas.\nFollowing decades of continuous conflict, the Antigonids saw the temporary renewal of the kingdom's fortunes, but were destroyed by Rome after Perseus' defeat at the battle of Pydna in 168 BC.\nArgead dynasty ( – 310 BC)\nLegendary\nThere are two separate historical traditions relating the foundation of Macedonia and the Argead dynasty. The earlier, documented by Herodotus and Thucydides in the fifth century BC, records Perdiccas as the first king of Macedonia. The later tradition first emerged around the beginning of the fourth century BC and claimed that Caranus, rather than Perdiccas, was the founder. Aside from Satyrus, who adds Coenus and Tyrimmas to the list, Marsyas of Pella, Theopompos, and Justin all agree that Caranus was Perdiccas' father. Furthermore, Plutarch claimed in his biography of Alexander the Great that all of his sources agreed that Caranus was the founder. This unhistorical assertion, like the Argive connection, is rejected by modern scholarship as court propaganda, possibly intended to diminish the significance of the name 'Perdiccas' in rival family branches following Amyntas III accession.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\"\n|+\n! width=\"17%\" !scope=\"col\" |Name\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"17%\" |Reign\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"28%\" |Succession\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"38%\" |Life details\n|- style=height:6em\n!scope=row style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA;\"|Caranus\n|Unknown\n|According to various ancient authors, either the son, brother, or relative of the Argive king Pheidon\n|\n|- style=height:6em\n!scope=row style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA;\"|Coenus\n|Unknown\n|Son of Caranus\n|\n|- style=height:6em\n!scope=row style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA;\"|Tyrimmas\n|Unknown\n|Son of Coenus\n|\n|}\nHistorical\nHerodotus mentions the names of the five kings preceding Amyntas I, but provides no other information. Consequently, the reign dates and activities of the early Argead kings can only be guessed at. By allowing thirty years for the span of an average generation and counting backwards from the beginning of Archelaus' reign in 413 BC, British historian Nicholas Hammond estimated that the dynasty began around 650 BC. Amyntas I and his son Alexander I are the earliest kings for which we have any reliable historical information, and even then, only in the context of their relationships with Achaemenid Persia and Greeks.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\"\n|+\n! width=\"17%\" !scope=\"col\" |Name\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"17%\" |Reign\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"28%\" |Succession\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"38%\" |Life details\n|- style=\"height:6em\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA;\" |Perdiccas I\n|}}\n|According to various ancient authors, either the son of Caranus or Tyrimmas\n|Conquered Macedonia after settling near Mount Bermion.\n|- style=\"height:6em\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA;\" |Argaeus I\n|}}\n|Son of Perdiccas I\n|Possibly established the cult of Dionysus in Macedonia.\n|- style=\"height:6em\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA;\" |Philip I\n|}}\n|Son of Argaeus I\n|\n|- style=\"height:6em\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA;\" |Aeropus I\n|}}\n|Son of Philip I\n|\n|- style=\"height:6em\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA;\" |Alcetas\n|}}\n|Son of Aeropus I\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |\n|- style=\"height:6em\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA;\" |Amyntas I\n| – 498/7\n|Son of Alcetas\n| Unknown – 498/7First king for which there is reliable historical information; vassal of Darius I from 512.\n|- style=\"height:6em\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA;\" |Alexander I \"Philhellene\"\n|498/7 – 454(43 years)\n|Son of Amyntas I\n|Unknown – 454 Intensified Macedon's relationship with Greece following Persian withdrawal in 479.\n|- style=\"height:6em\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA;\" |Perdiccas II\n|454 – 413(41 years)\n|Son of Alexander I\n|Unknown – 413 Fought both for and against Athens during the Peloponnesian War; died probably of natural causes.\n|- style=\"height:6em\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA;\" |Archelaus\n|413 – 399(14 years)\n|Son of Perdiccas II\n|Unknown – 399 Moved center of kingdom from Aegae to Pella; either murdered in a personal revenge plot or killed in a hunting accident by his lover Craterus.\n|- style=\"height:6em\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA;\" |Orestes\n|399 – 398/7(3 years)\n|Son of Archelaus\n|Unknown – 398/7 Minority reign until removal in 398/7; possibly murdered by Aeropus II, his guardian, but facts are uncertain.\n|- style=\"height:6em\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA;\" |Aeropus II}}\n|398/7 – 395/4(3 years)\n|Son of Perdiccas II\n|Unknown – 395/4 Died of illness\n|- style=\"height:6em\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA;\" |Amyntas II \"the Little\"\n|394/3(Several months)\n|Son of Menelaus, Alexander I's second son\n|Unknown – 394/3 Probably ruled at the same time as Pausanias; sources for reign are few, but likely murdered by the ruler of Elimiotis, Derdas.\n|- style=\"height:6em\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA;\" |Pausanias\n|394/3\n(Several months)\n|Son of Aeropus II\n|Unknown – 394/3 Probably ruled at the same time as Amyntas II; sources for reign are few, but likely murdered by Amyntas III.\n|- style=\"height:6em\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA;\" |(1st reign)Amyntas III\n|393(Less than a year)\n|Great grandson of Alexander I through his third son, Amyntas\n|Unknown – 369 Held kingdom together despite multiple Illyrian invasions; died of natural causes.\n|- style=\"height:6em\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA;\" |Argaeus II\n|393?(disputed)\n|Pretender to the throne installed by the Illyrians under Bardylis; possibly the son of Archelaus However, not all historians are in agreement and the claim remains largely unverifiable.}}\n|Unknown Expelled by Amyntas III with Thesallian help.\n|- style=\"height:6em\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA;\" |(2nd reign)Amyntas III\n|393 – 369(18 years)\n|Great grandson of Alexander I through his third son, Amyntas\n|Unknown – 369 Held kingdom together despite multiple Illyrian invasions; died of natural causes.\n|- style=\"height:6em\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA;\" |Alexander II\n|369 – 368(2 years)\n|Eldest son of Amyntas III\n| – 368(aged 22)Assassinated by Ptolemy of Aloros following Theban military intervention under Pelopidas.\n|- style=\"height:6em\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA;\" |Ptolemy of Aloros\n|368 – 365(3 years; disputed) The confusion stems from contradictory comments by our primary sources: Plutarch refers to Ptolemy as a regent in Pelopidas, yet Diodorus refers to him as king.
