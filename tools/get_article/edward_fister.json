He died at home in New Jersey on February 8, 2003.\nHe was a pioneer in the development of radar, worked on the electrification of the GG-1, and worked on the rocket and bomb proximity fuse.\nLife\nEdward Fister was born to William Franklin Fister and Hannah Dugan Fister. He was their only surviving child. After growing up in Atlantic City, he graduated from Villanova University in 1937 with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering.[http://www.villanova.edu/advance/alumni/about/awards/alumni.htm Alumni Medal] He was awarded the Villanova Alumni Medal. He also was awarded the Westinghouse Science Award. His first job was with the Pennsylvania Railroad in Altoona, Pennsylvania on the electrification project to support the world's fastest engine, the GG-1.  After briefly working with the Atlantic City Electric Company, he began to work in 1940 with the Signal Corps in the pre-war years.  He eventually became Director of Development at the Signal Corps Engineering Laboratories(called CECOM[http://www.monmouth.army.mil/CELCMC/ CECOM – Communications and Electronics Command]  now). He had worked there for 34 years when he retired in 1974. He worked diligently on the then-new and revolutionary invention, radar. Mr Fister was responsible for making the inventions of the laboratory and theoretical breakthroughs come to life and onto the battlefield. His work on this was inconceivably important, considering that radar was what helped Britain win the Battle of Britain.\nThe War Department awarded him the Commendation for Meritorious Civilian Service and the Citation reads:  For outstanding performance of assigned tasks and for initiative in directing and expediting engineering work performed by the Signal Corps on the rocket and bomb proximity fuse.\" signed by Major General H.C.
