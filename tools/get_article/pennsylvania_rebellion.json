Manager Rick Bertagnolli resigned following a 2–10 start, citing 'personal reasons.'  Assistant coach Stacey Rice, was named to replace him.\nThe Rebellion's inaugural season ended with 9–39 record, finishing in last place.\n2015\nOn January 14, the Rebellion announced that the head coach of the Netherlands women's national softball team, Craig Montvidas, was hired as the Rebellion's coach.  On January 26, Steve Zavacky was promoted to general manager.\nThe team missed the playoffs, finishing in last place.\n2016\nThe team missed the playoffs, finishing in last place.\nOn January 16, 2017, the NPF announced that the ownership of the Pennsylvania Rebellion would be dissolving the team, effective immediately.
