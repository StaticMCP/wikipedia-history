This can include wildcat strikes, which are done without union authorisation, and slowdown strikes, where workers reduce their productivity while still carrying out minimal working duties. It is usually a response to employee grievances, such as low pay or poor working conditions. Strikes can also occur to demonstrate solidarity with workers in other workplaces or pressure governments to change policies.\nTimeline\nContinuing strikes from 2014\n* 2014–2016 Oromo protests\nJanuary\nFebruary\n* 2015 United Steel Workers Oil Refinery strike\nMarch\nApril\nMay\nJune\nJuly\nAugust\nSeptember\n* 2015 Australia women's national soccer team strike, 2-month strike by Australia women's national soccer team players.\n* 2015 Munnar Plantation strike, 9-day strike by women workers at the Munnar Kannan Devan Hills Plantations Limited, Kerala.\nOctober\n* Stethoscope Revolution, in Morocco.\nNovember\n* 2015 Kohler strike\n* 2015 Romanian protests\nDecember\nStatistics\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, the number of working days lost to strikes in the UK in 2015 was the second-lowest per year since 1891, largely due to a wave of public sectors having occurred earlier in 2014. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were twelve major work stoppages (involving at least 1000 workers) in the United States in 2015. According to Employment and Social Development Canada, there were 61 work stoppages in Canada in 2015, almost all in the public sector, with around 80% of the working days lost occurring in Québec.\nReferences"
