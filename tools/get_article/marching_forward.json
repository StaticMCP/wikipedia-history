      "text": "# Marching Forward\n\nMarching Forward () was the first Taiwanese Hokkien pop album released by Taiwanese singer Lim Giong and sold more than 400,000 copies. The album brought up rock music style, breaking the traditional melancholy style of Taiwanese pop music, and was regarded as one of the representative works of the new Taiwanese song movement. In addition to winning the Best Vocal Album Producer Award at the 3rd Golden Melody Awards, the album's eponymous title track, \"Marching Forward,\" also won the Best Song of the Year Award.\nRecording\nThe album was recorded in 1989 and was co-produced by Bobby Chen and Jonathan Lee, with Lim Giong, Lee Cheng-Fan (), Kay Huang (), and Lo Hung Wu () as the main arrangers, and most of the lyric writing was done by Lim Giong. There are also Bobby Chen, Xu Xin-Yi (), Kuo Shu-Ling (), Lin Wei () and others who co-wrote some songs with Lim Giong. The album \"Marching Forward\" was officially released in vinyl and cassette versions on December 7, 1990, and compact disc version was released on January 17, 1991.\nCritical reception\nAccording to music critic Weng Jiaming (), \"Marching Forward shows the conflicts, thoughts and emotional transformations of Taiwanese provincial children growing up in the countryside and adjusting to the city life. Although the criticism is not deep enough, at least it is a sincere expression of the young Taiwanese generation's experience of the reality of society.\"\nTrack listing\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Track\n!Title\n!Lyrics\n!Compose\n!Arrangement\n|-\n|1.\n|Ordinary people 平凡老百姓\n|Lim Giong\n|Lim Giong\n|Lee Cheng-Fan\n|-\n|2.\n|Marching Forward 向前走\n|Lim Giong\n|Lim Giong\n|Hung Wu\n|-\n|3.\n|No Vibration 未振未動\n|Lin Yu\n|Lim Giong & Lin Wei\n|Lee Cheng-Fan\n|-\n|4.\n|Letter To You 給你的信\n|Xu Xin-Yi\n|Lim Giong\n|Lee Cheng-Fan\n|-\n|5.\n|The Person In Dream 夢中人\n|Bobby Chen & Lim Giong & Kuo Shu-Ling\n|Bobby Chen\n|Kay Huang\n|-\n|6.\n|The Snack Vender 黑輪伯仔\n|Bobby Chen & Lim Giong\n|Bobby Chen & Lim Giong\n|Kay Huang\n|-\n|7.\n|Sky & Land 天和地\n|Lim Giong\n|Lim Giong\n|林強\n|-\n|8.\n|Shining 閃閃爍\n|Lim Giong\n|Lim Giong\n|Lee Cheng-Fan\n|-\n|9.\n|Lion In The Forest 深山林內有獅\n|Lim Giong\n|Lim Giong\n|Kay Huang\n|-\n|10.\n|This Matter 這款的代誌\n|Bobby Chen & Lim Giong\n|Bobby Chen & Lim Giong\n|Kay Huang\n|}\nAwards\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Award Ceremony\n!Awards\n!Title\n!Result\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |The 3rd Golden Melody Awards\n|Song of the Year\n|Marching Forward - Lim Giong\n|Won\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Best Lyrics in Dialect Award\n|Marching Forward - Lim Giong\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Marching Forward - Lim Giong\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Music Video\n|Marching Forward - Rock Records\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Album Producer\n|Marching Forward - Bobby Chen, Jonathan Lee, Terry Chou, Lo Hung Wu\n|Won\n|}\nReferences"
