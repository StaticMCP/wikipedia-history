In the first century B.C.  conquered Kalinga and Kosala. During the reign of Kharavela, the third king of Mahameghavahana dynasty, South Kosala became an integral part of the kingdom. He patronised Jainism, but did not discriminate against other religions. He is known by his Hathigumpha inscription.\nSouth Kosala was later conquered by Gautamiputra Satakarni of the Satavahana dynasty in the early part of the 2nd century CE and remained in their possession up to the second half of the 2nd century CE. It was during the second and third century CE, the Meghas or Meghavahanas reappeared in the political scene and regained their suzerainty over South Kosala. Samudragupta during his Dakshinapatha expedition, defeated Mahendra of Dakshina Kosala who probably belonged to the Megha dynasty according to a speculation. As a result, the South Kosala during the fourth century A.D, became a part of the Gupta empire.\nList of rulers\nThe Hathigumpha inscription describes the following rulers. It does not directly mention the relationship between Mahameghavahana and Kharavela, or the number of kings between them. Some historians have interpreted the inscription to create the following hypothetical family tree:\nKharavela\nThe third ruler of the dynasty, Khārabēḷa, conquered much of India in a series of campaigns at the beginning of the common era. Kaḷingan military might was reinstated by Khārabēḷa: under Khārabēḷa's generalship, the Kaḷinga state had a formidable maritime reach with trade routes linking it to the then-Simhala (Sri Lanka), Burma (Myanmar), Siam (Thailand), Vietnam, Kamboja (Cambodia), Borneo, Bali, Samudra (Sumatra) and Jabadwipa (Java). Khārabēḷa led many successful campaigns against the states of Magadha, Anga, the Satavahanas and the South Indian regions ruled by the Pandyan dynasty (modern Andhra Pradesh) and expanded Kaḷinga as far as the Ganges and the Kaveri.\nThe Kharavelan state had a formidable maritime empire with trading routes linking it to Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Borneo, Bali, Sumatra and Java. Colonists from Kaḷinga settled in Sri Lanka, Burma, as well as the Maldives and Maritime Southeast Asia. Even today Indians are referred to as Keling in Malaysia because of this.\nAlthough religiously tolerant, Khārabēḷa patronised Jainism, and was responsible for the propagation of Jainism in the Indian subcontinent but his importance is neglected in many accounts of Indian history. The main source of information about Khārabeḷa is his famous seventeen line rock-cut Hātigumphā inscription in the Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves near Bhubaneswar, Odisha. According to the Hathigumpha inscription, he attacked Rajagriha in Magadha, thus inducing the Indo-Greek king Demetrius I of Bactria to retreat to Mathura.\nBranches of Mahameghavahana Dynasty\nThe Sada dynasty who ruled form Amaravati region in their inscription from Guntapalli describe themselves as Maharaja of Kalinga Mahisaka countries belonging to Mahameghavahana family.\n: Kausalaka Mahendra) in Line 19 of the Allahabad Pillar inscription of Samudragupta (r.350-375 CE)]]\nMeghas of Dakshina Kosala -During the reign of Kharavela, the third king of Mahameghavahana dynasty, South Kosala became an integral part of the Kalinga,from there originated the Kosala branch of the Mahameghavahana dynasty.\nMahendra a king of Dakshina Kosala,was often identified with the Meghas of Kosala, who ruled over Kosala from the 3rd century AD to the 6th century AD.\nAdministration\nThe Maha meghavahanas had a organised political structure under the rule of Emperor Kharavela in the 2nd half of the 1st century BC. The Hathigumpha Inscription mentions that the king himself learnt lekha (writing) , rupa(coinage), ganana(accountancy), vavahara(law) and vidhi(administration) and acquired mastry over different branches of learning so as to proficient in statescraft. The inscription mentions different army and state officials such as:\n* Mahamad\n* Nagara Akhadamsa ( City Judge)\n* Kamma\n* Chaulakamma\n* Padamulika\nThe inscription mentions the regular collection and remission of taxes by the government.
