She had a very close race with ''Neptune's Car, and ended her days in the coolie trade.\nConstruction\nWestward Ho! had long, very sharp ends, with concave lines. Her frame was of white oak, and planking of hard pine. She was copper fastened, with yellow metal sheathing. The hull was painted black, the inside buff relieved with white, the waterways blue.\nThe finish work below decks was quite fancy, with rosewood, mahogany, carvings, gold ornamentation, and paneled mirrors. Some of the cabins had stained glass windows with Venetian blinds. The figurehead was a Native American warrior giving chase.\nVoyages\nWestward Ho! made a very fast passage to San Francisco between January&nbsp;12 and April&nbsp;22, 1855, under Capt. Johnson. She arrived in San Francisco just 100&nbsp;days and 18&nbsp;hours from Boston Light. One day later, the clipper Neptune’s Car left Sandy Hook, New York. She arrived in San Francisco one day after Westward Ho!, after a passage of 100&nbsp;days, 23½&nbsp;hours.\nIn 1856, Westward Ho! brought 800 coolies from Swatow to Callao, for work in the guano deposits. Westward Ho! caught fire on , at anchor in Callao.\n}}\nExternal links\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=rZQBAAAAYAAJ&dq=clipper+%22westward+ho%22&pg=PA364 Description of coolie trade in Peru in the time of Westward Ho! and Winged Racer'']"
