He started his journey in Ladakh and continued to Gilgit. He made it to Gilgit in time to join the fight in 1891 when the British forces led by Colonel Algernon Durand began a military campaign against the smaller states of Hunza and Nagar. He also served as a correspondent for The Times during this time. In addition, he was temporarily appointed as an officer-in-charge of some native troops.\nA scanned copy of the book is available in Wikimedia Commons and the rare books section of the Government of India's Indian Culture portal.\nGallery\nReferences"
