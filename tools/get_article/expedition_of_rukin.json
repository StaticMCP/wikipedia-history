Rukin told one Cossack:\n}}\nRukin decided to negotiate. The Kazakhs cajoled him with words about the excellent attitude towards the prisoners and asked him to lay down his arms, the whole squad understood that this was stupid because A similar case occurred in 1717, when an entire detachment died due to the general's excessive credulity, however, Rukin was adamant when the Cossacks came out of hiding a whole crowd piled on them and killed almost everyone, taking 3 people prisoner. Rukin himself decided to shoot himself out of grief.\nAftermath\nThe victory over the detachment inspired the majority of the population of the peninsula, and the rebels began to attack local settlements, in particular the military capital Fort Alexandrovsky.\nRukin was scalped and sent along with the prisoners into slavery to the Khan of Khiva, after the campaign of 1873 they were released.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
