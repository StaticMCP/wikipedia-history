The premier division currently features thirteen teams from as far north from Noosa on the Sunshine Coast, throughout the Brisbane Metropolitan Area and as far south as Palm Beach on the Gold Coast near the New South Wales border. The league's headquarters is located in Brisbane.\nHistory\nPrior to formation of the QFL, a precursor existed in the form of the Queensland Football Association (QFA) between 1880 and 1890. However poor alignment with the Victorian Football Association, a failure to secure intercolonial tests and its failure to rein in the popularity of rugby saw its ultimate demise. Following a decade long hiatus in the sport, Australian rules saw renewed interest during the Federation of Australia and fans in Queensland at the turn of the century regrouped floating the idea of a new competition that would endure in the state.\nThe Queensland Football League (QFL) was formed in July 1903 at a meeting with 50 present at the South Brisbane Cycling Club and a total of 150 signed on as members. Unlike the previous league which affiliated with the VFA, this new body decided to affiliate with the Victorian Football League. Practice matches were held in August that year in the Botanical Gardens and attracted large crowds and interest. The first premiership was held in 1904 with most games being played at Queen's Park, a sporting facility within the grounds of the Brisbane Botanic Gardens.\n, 1907. Locomotives defeated Wynnum by 40 points]]\nFrom 1905 to 1914 games were regularly played at the Brisbane Cricket Ground. Clubs included Brisbanes, Locomotives, Ipswich, Citys, Valleys, South Brisbane, North Brisbane, West Brisbane and Wynnum.\nBetween 1915 and 1919 the competition went into recess owing to World War I.\nIn 1926 Melbourne brewery Old Court Whisky donated the trophy to the competition. The first winner was Brisbane.\nIn August 1927 at a meeting of the Australian National Football Council it was decided that each of the state leagues were to include the words 'Australian National' in their names.  Accordingly, the QFL was renamed the Queensland Australian National Football League (QANFL) and football continued a steady growth in Brisbane.\nin the 1930s]]\nYeronga and Taringa fielded senior sides in the league for the first time in 1931, both having an immediate impact and finishing runner up in the years to follow.\nIn 1964 the QANFL dropped the 'National' reference to their name and became the Queensland Australian Football League (QAFL), a limited liability company.\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, the QAFL saw a boom in popularity, boosted by televised matches it saw crowds of 500 to several thousand attending blockbuster matches, modest in comparison to attendances drawn in traditional football states but significant nonetheless. The QAFL and the Gold Coast league both competed directly with the VFL for local marketshare in 1982.\nBrisbane Bears VFL licence and QAFL-Cronin Consortium\nWith its popularity increasing, the QAFL began to seek a VFL licence. In 1985 the QAFL had decided that pushing for a Melbourne-based club to relocate to Brisbane. However, after several failed attempts to relocate Melbourne clubs including Fitzroy and Richmond, it soon became evident that the VFL's preference was a new licence.\nIn 1986 the QAFL formed a consortium with Paul Cronin for a new VFL licence and the consortium won its bid for a new Brisbane based club. However the QAFL fell out with the Christopher Skase backed Brisbane Bears when the decision was made to base the new club at Carrara on the Gold Coast instead of the QAFL's preferred venue, the Brisbane Cricket Ground. The decision would begin a bitter and long protracted battle between the QAFL and the Bears which was not resolved until 1991.\nThe admission of the Brisbane Bears and to have the club based on the Gold Coast had a huge impact on the QAFL's crowds, with attendances falling from an average of 500 to just 50. Combined with the Bears poor on field and off field performances, the QAFL was severely weakened over the following years resulting in its voluntary liquidation in 1999.\n2000: Restructure\nIn 2000 the QSFL was replaced by a new organisation, AFL Queensland (AFLQ). The new premiership competition was called the AFLQ State League.\nRecent history\nIn November 2010 the AFL Queensland's Premier Division merged with AFL Canberra to form the North East Australian Football League, featuring all of its previous teams as well as the Gold Coast Suns and Brisbane Lions reserve teams in the Northern Conference of the league.\nAs a result, the QAFL was disbanded in favour of localised competitions throughout Queensland. The structural changes to the North East Australian Football League (NEAFL) competition at the end of the 2013 season resulted in several clubs being relegated from the NEAFL, giving rise to a rebirth of the QAFL. As of 2014, there are 10 clubs who compete in the QAFL, most of which are based in South-East Queensland. After spending the 2021 season in the VFL, Aspley rejoined the QAFL in time for the 2022 season.\nSeasons and venues\n* 1904–1912:Queen's Park, Alice Street (now part of the City Botanic Gardens)\n* 1905–1914:Brisbane Cricket Ground, Exhibition Ground\n* 1920–1959:Perry Park, Bowen Hills; Exhibition Ground\n* 1959–1971:Brisbane Cricket Ground\n* 1972–1989:Windsor Park\n* Exhibition Ground was used for some games including the 1950 interstate carnival\nClubs\nThe Queensland Australian Football League operates on a single table system, with no divisions, conferences nor promotion and relegation from other leagues.\nCurrent clubs\n{| class=\" wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:left;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Club\n! rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" |Colours\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Nickname\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Former league(s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Years in QAFL\n! colspan=\"2\" |QAFL Premierships\n|-\n!
