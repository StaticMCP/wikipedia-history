The organisation was intended to foster the Free Software community in Ireland, and to continue this legal and political work in a coherent manner.\nActivities\n* IFSO has been involved in organising several public lectures on Free Software, Software Patentability and other related topics.\n* It has lobbied on the subject of the EU Software Patents directive, and other elements of European and Irish legislation.\n* It has worked to raise awareness and promote the use of Free Software (for example, by participating in Software Freedom Day)\nStructure\nAlthough IFSO is a membership organisation, with a committee to provide structure, formal membership is considered less important than an individual's willingness to participate and take initiative. IFSO frequently collaborates with related organisations.\nExternal links\n* [http://www.ifso.ie The IFSO website]\n* [http://www.ifso.ie/projects/swpats.html IFSO project: software patents]\n** [http://www.ifso.ie/documents/ifso-2005-11-18.html Transcript from an IFSO event \"Preventing Software Patents: How and Why\"]\n* [http://www.ifso.ie/projects/gplv3.html IFSO project: GPLv3]\n* [http://www.ifso.ie/projects/promotion.html IFSO project: promotion]\n* [http://www.fsfeurope.org Free Software Foundation Europe]\n* [http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/02/28/1442241 Slashdot story on two GPLv3 talk transcripts published by IFSO]"
