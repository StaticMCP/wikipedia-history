Six seaplanes had joined the group under the command of Major Herbert Boy, while General Alfredo Vásquez Cobo went aboard the Córdova to request a meeting with the gunboats Cartagena and Santa Marta, which could not happen because the Putumayo Detachment was carrying out operations in the Güeppi area.\nOn February 11, 1933, General Alfredo Vásquez Cobo sent a speedboat to Tarapacá with an ultimatum in the hands of Lieutenant Jorge Hernández addressed to Lieutenant Gonzalo Díaz, commander of the Peruvian garrison. The Colombian emissary returned without a written response, but with a verbal response: Lieutenant Gonzalo Díaz stated that he would reject by force any attempted military occupation of Tarapacá.\nBattle\nIn the morning hours of February 14, the Córdova suffered an attack by a Peruvian air squadron, which provoked the response of the Colombian air squadron that was anchored nearby, without direct combat.\nIn the afternoon hours of February 14, Colombian forces advanced near Tarapacá to undertake the armed operation the following day. At six o'clock in the morning of February 15, the Colombian fleet began a bombardment as did the air force on the Peruvian garrisons, and three hours later the troops disembarked, which upon arriving at the fort found no trace of their Peruvian counterpart. Lieutenant Gonzalo Díaz had fled with his men at night through the Cotuhé River leaving behind supplies, ammunition and weapons, among them 2 Krupp 75mm cannons. Immediately after, General Alfredo Vásquez Cobo located a battalion of 300 men in Tarapacá and installed a support base there for subsequent operations.\nReferences"
