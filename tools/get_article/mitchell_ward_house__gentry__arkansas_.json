Its main block is an L-shaped wood-frame structure, with a cross-gable roof, and a large gable above the porch in the crook of the L.  The three front-facing gable ends have decorative Folk Victorian jigsawn trim and different styles of siding, and the porch features turned posts, a spindled balustrade, and a decorative frieze.  The interior has also retained all of its original woodwork.  The house was built in 1897, and is one of the finest Queen Anne/Folk Victorian houses in the city.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.\nSee also\n*Mitchell House (Gentry, Arkansas)\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Benton County, Arkansas\nReferences"
