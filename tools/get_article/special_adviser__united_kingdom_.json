They differ from impartial civil servants in that they are political appointees.\nSpecial advisers are paid by the government and appointed under Section 15 of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010. There are four pay bands for special advisers.\nBackground\nSpecial advisers were first appointed from 1964 under the Harold Wilson's first Labour government to provide political advice to Ministers and have been subsequently utilised by all following governments.\nCode of conduct\nAdvisers are governed by a code of conduct which goes some way to defining their role and delineates relations with the permanent civil service, contact with the media and relationship with the governing party, inter alia:the employment of special advisers adds a political dimension to the advice and assistance available to Ministers while reinforcing the political impartiality of the permanent Civil Service by distinguishing the source of political advice and support [...] Special advisers are employed to help Ministers on matters where the work of Government and the work of the Government Party overlap and where it would be inappropriate for permanent civil servants to become involved. They are an additional resource for the Minister providing assistance from a standpoint that is more politically committed and politically aware than would be available to a Minister from the permanent Civil Service.The rules for their appointment, and status in relation to ministers, are set out in the Ministerial Code.\nNumber and cost of special advisers\nNumber\nThere is no legal limit on the number of special advisers, although the current total is less than it was under Tony Blair. The government had previously accepted calls, made in 2000 by the Neill Committee on Standards in Public Life, for such a legal cap. By 2002, however, the government had altered its position, saying in response to the Wicks Committee report on standards in public life that \"the Government does not believe that the issue of special advisers can be considered as a numerical issue. The issue is about being transparent, about accountability and about roles and responsibilities, as well as about numbers\".\nCost\nThe total cost of special advisers in 2006–07 was £5.9 million, which has since increased to £15.9 million in 2022-2023.\nThere are four pay bands for special advisers.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Special adviser pay bands, July 2023\n!Name\n!Pay band\n|-\n|PB4\n|£102,000 – £145,000\n|-\n|PB3\n|£73,000 – £102,000\n|-\n|PB2\n|£57,000 – £84,000\n|-\n|PB1\n|£40,500 – £53,000\n|}\nCurrent Pay Band 4 special advisers\nAs of 31 March 2025, there were 128.67 full-time equivalent special advisers working for the government.\nAs of July 2025, the following advisers were included in a government list of special advisers in Pay Band 4:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Appointing minister\n!

In 2021, Berry published a spoof diary, Staggering Hubris, written in Hubris' voice, purporting to tell the \"real story\" of the chaos behind the scenes as the British government attempted to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.\nIn 2024, former special adviser Dan Corry published a book of short stories featuring special advisers, Tales of the Unelected.\nSee also\n* Special adviser (Norway)\n* [https://www.gov.uk/government/government-efficiency-transparency-and-accountability UK Government efficiency, transparency and accountability] page, which includes regular reports listing special advisers\nFootnotes\nExternal links\n*[http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/special-advisers-guidance Guidance - Special Advisers: code of conduct] Current version; updated as required"
