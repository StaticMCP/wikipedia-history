They reached the height of their popularity from 1996 to 1999. The band went on hiatus in 2001 and reunited in 2008.\nThe Republica sound was described by the band as \"technopop punk rock\". The current line-up consists of Saffron (vocals), Tim Dorney (keyboards), and Johnny Male (guitar).\nHistory\n1994–1997: Beginnings, debut album and international success\nFormer Flowered Up keyboardist Tim Dorney met producer/engineer Andy Todd while both musicians were working in the studio for the band Soul Family Sensation. The two decided to form Republica as an electronic-oriented outfit. They recruited singer Saffron, who was an actress at one point, performing for two years in London's Starlight Express. She also appeared in the video for Chesney Hawkes' hit \"The One and Only\" and in the video for N-Joi's single \"Mindflux\". She was also lead vocalist on N-Joi's hit \"Anthem\" in 1990. Republica's first lineup was rounded out with Alix Tiernan on drums and Mick Pirie on bass.\nRepublica released their first single \"Out of This World\" in 1994, followed by the single \"Bloke\" in March 1995. After the music video for \"Bloke\" was filmed, Johnny Male joined the band on guitar. Male was an acquaintance of Dorney and Todd, since Male was formerly a member of Soul Family Sensation. Their television debut occurred in April that same year, on the program The White Room. Pirie departed from the band later that year. In April 1996, their single \"Ready to Go\" became their first to chart on the UK Singles Chart, when it reached No. 43. Their debut album Republica was released in the United States in July 1996 and reached No.&nbsp;4 in the UK Albums Chart after being released there in 1997. \"Ready to Go\" was re-released in remixed form, with a rock-oriented sound. This version became their signature single and reached No.&nbsp;13. The fourth single, \"Drop Dead Gorgeous\", reached No.&nbsp;7. To promote Republica, the band brought in Bow Wow Wow founder David Barbarossa on drums as Tiernan switched to strictly percussion (although Tiernan eventually departed in 1996).\nThe group attracted positive press coverage. Emerging after a wave of female-fronted rock bands (such as Elastica, Lush, Sleeper, Echobelly and Kenickie), they had, like Curve and Garbage, a notably more aggressive and electronic sound. In 1997, they contributed a cover of \"Are 'Friends' Electric?\" to the Gary Numan tribute album Random. That same year, Saffron performed vocals for the Prodigy's \"Fuel My Fire\" from their album The Fat of the Land. By early 1998, when Barbarossa and Todd left the band, Republica continued as a trio.\n1998–2001: Speed Ballads and dissolution\nThe band's second album, Speed Ballads, was released in 1998 and reached No.&nbsp;37 in UK Albums Chart. Its lead single, \"From Rush Hour With Love\", peaked at No.&nbsp;20 in UK Singles Chart. The band suffered when their label, Deconstruction Records, folded shortly after the release of Speed Ballads. Deconstruction's back catalogue was swallowed up by BMG and Speed Ballads was never released in the United States. In 2001, Republica went on hiatus. On their official site it was posted the message \"Republica are not recording at this time\".\n2002–2009: Hiatus\nIn 2002 BMG released the compilation Ready to Go: The Best Of against the band's wishes. After the band went on hiatus, Saffron worked with the Cure, appearing on the single \"Just Say Yes\" from their Greatest Hits album. She also collaborated with Junkie XL for his 2003 album Radio JXL: A Broadcast from the Computer Hell Cabin. In September 2008, Republica reunited at Windsor at a Contra Mundum concert. They played \"Ready to Go\", \"Drop Dead Gorgeous\" and a cover of \"You Got the Love\".\n2010–2020: Reunion, sporadic performances and new material\nIn early 2010, Republica performed a string of gigs. They also issued a remixed version of \"Ready to Go\" entitled \"Ready to Go 2010\". In June 2010 the remix was released and reached No.&nbsp;1 on the Upfront Club chart. The track has been produced by Andy Gray and Alan Moulder. In October 2010, the band performed a comeback gig at O2 Academy Islington followed by several dates in Eastern Europe and the Middle East in 2011. They performed at GuilFest in July 2012.\nThe band released a new EP, Christiana Obey, and also recorded a session for Brentwood radio station Phoenix FM in April 2013. A joint 20th anniversary tour with the band Space took place in the spring of 2014. In October and early November 2014, Republica toured the UK in support of the Boomtown Rats \"Ratlife\" tour and took the opportunity to premiere some new material. Friday 29 May 2015 saw the public debut of more new material when Republica performed at the \"Under The Bridge\" venue in Chelsea, London, with support from Tenek and Kenelis. A deluxe edition of Republica was released on 28 February 2020 on Cherry Red Records.\n2021–present: Damaged Gods\nThe band released a new single, \"New York\" in November 2023, from their upcoming studio album Damaged Gods scheduled to be released in the spring of 2025, their first in 27 years, on Armalyte Industries. The second single off the album, \"Hallelujah\", was released 28 June 2024.\nIn June 2024, Saffron announced that Steve Hewitt, former drummer of Placebo and Six by Seven, had joined Republica as the band's live drummer.\nMembers\nCurrent members\n* Saffron – lead vocals, tambourine, guitar (1994–2001, 2008–present)\n* Tim Dorney – keyboards (1994–2001, 2008–present)\n* Johnny Male – guitar, bass (1995–2001, 2008–present)\nCurrent touring members\n* Steve Hewitt – drums (2024–present)\nFormer members\n* Andy Todd – keyboards, guitar, bass (1994–1998)\n* Mick Pirie – bass (1994–1995)\n* Alix Tiernan – drums, percussion (1994–1996)\n* David Barbarossa – drums, percussion (1996–1998)\nFormer touring members\n* Pete Riley – drums (1998–2001)\n* Nigel Champion – drums (2008–2012)\n* Conor Lawrence – drums (2012–2024)\n* Timm Hamm – bass (2013–2015)\nTimeline\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:4\nScaleMajor = increment:3 start:1995\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1995\nColors =\nid:lvocals value:red        legend:Lead_vocals\nid:guitar  value:green      legend:Guitar\nid:bass    value:blue       legend:Bass\nid:keys    value:purple     legend:Keyboards\nid:drums   value:orange     legend:Drums\nid:perc    value:claret     legend:Percussion\nid:studio  value:black      legend:Studio_album\nid:EP      value:gray(0.6)  legend:EP\nid:bars    value:gray(0.95)\nBackgroundColors = bars:bars\nLineData =\nlayer:back color:studio\nat:07/30/1996\nat:10/01/1998\ncolor:EP\nat:03/14/2013\nBarData =\nbar:Saffron    text:Saffron\nbar:Male       text:Johnny Male\nbar:Pirie      text:Mick Pirie\nbar:Dorney     text:Tim Dorney\nbar:Todd       text:Andy Todd\nbar:Tiernan    text:Alix Tiernan\nbar:Barbarossa text:David Barbarossa\nPlotData =\nwidth:11\ncolor:lvocals\nbar:Saffron    from:start      till:11/17/2001\nbar:Saffron    from:09/15/2008 till:end\ncolor:guitar\nbar:Male       from:03/03/1995     till:11/17/2001\nbar:Male       from:09/15/2008 till:end\ncolor:bass\nbar:Pirie      from:start      till:11/11/1995\ncolor:keys\nbar:Dorney     from:start      till:11/17/2001\nbar:Dorney     from:09/15/2008 till:end\nbar:Todd       from:start      till:03/01/1998\ncolor:drums\nbar:Tiernan    from:start      till:07/01/1996\nbar:Barbarossa from:07/01/1996     till:03/01/1998\ncolor:perc\nbar:Tiernan    from:07/01/1996      till:10/30/1996\nwidth:3\nbar:Todd       from:start      till:03/01/1998 color:guitar\nbar:Tiernan    from:start      till:07/01/1996 color:perc\nbar:Barbarossa from:10/30/1996      till:03/01/1998 color:perc\nbar:Male       from:11/11/1995 till:11/17/2001 color:bass\nbar:Male       from:09/15/2008 till:end        color:bass\nwidth:7\nbar:Todd       from:start      till:03/01/1998 color:bass\n}}\nSide projects and collaborations\n* Saffron performed vocals for the Prodigy's \"Fuel My Fire\" from their 1997 album The Fat of the Land.\n* Saffron wrote and performed vocals for Deepsky's \"Smile\" from their 2002 album In Silico.\n* Saffron recorded the songs \"Crusher\", \"Spirits\" and \"Beauty Never Fades\" on Junkie XL's 2003 album Radio JXL: A Broadcast from the Computer Hell Cabin.\n* In 2001 Saffron worked with the Cure on the single \"Just Say Yes\" for their Greatest Hits.
