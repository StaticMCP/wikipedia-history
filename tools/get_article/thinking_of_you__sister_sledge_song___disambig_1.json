It was originally recorded for their third album, We Are Family (1979), and was included as the B-side to their UK top 20 single \"Lost in Music\". \"Thinking of You\" was written and produced by Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards, and, like many Sister Sledge hits, was built on the rhythmic foundations of their guitar and bass line arrangements.\nChart performance\nSister Sledge's 1983 album Bet Cha Say That to All the Girls had failed to chart in any of the major territories. The belated issue in 1984 of \"Thinking of You\" peaked at number 11 on the UK Singles Chart and number 20 in Ireland, reviving interest in the group in both countries, paving the way for a re-issue of \"Lost in Music\" in September 1984, when it reached number four in the UK, and their only UK number one hit, \"Frankie\", in June 1985. \"Thinking of You\" was remixed in 1993 after the success of the \"We Are Family\" remix, reaching number 17 in the UK, number 21 in Ireland, and number 88 in Australia in 1994.\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1984)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|Ireland (IRMA)\n|align=\"center\"|20\n|-\n|UK Singles (OCC)\n|align=\"center\"|11\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1993–94)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|Australia (ARIA)\n|align=\"center\"|88\n|-\n|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100)\n|align=\"center\"|54\n|-\n|Ireland (IRMA)\n|align=\"center\"|21\n|-\n|UK Singles (OCC)\n|align=\"center\"|17\n|-\n|UK Airplay (Music Week)\n|align=\"center\"|15\n|-\n|UK Club Chart (Music Week)\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n!Chart (1984)\n!Position\n|-\n|UK Singles (Gallup)\n|align=\"center\"|81\n|}\nCertifications\nCover versions\n2 Brothers on the 4th Floor, a Dutch rap duo, released a cover version in 1997 titled \"I'm Thinkin' of U\".\nAustralian singer Lisa Maxwell also covered \"Thinking of You\" on her album Wish in 1997 (NZ number 50 and Japan's J-Wave chart number eight.)\nBlacknuss (featuring vocals by Nai-Jee-Ria) released a house version of the song in 2000.\nPaul Weller covered this song on his 2004 album, Studio 150.
