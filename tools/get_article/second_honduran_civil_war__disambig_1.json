This was the first conflict in Honduras where airplanes were used for aerial bombardment, and new war tactics inherited from the First World War were employed.\nBackground\nPost First Civil War government (1919–1924)\nGeneral Rafael López Gutiérrez, who had become President of Honduras, annulled the result of the 1919 general elections for president. The candidates in 1919 were Dr. Juan Ángel Arias Boquín for the “Arismo” Movement of the Honduran Liberal Party, Dr. Policarpo Bonilla, former president of the nation and candidate of the “Constitutional Liberal Party,” and Doctor Tiburcio Carias Andino, candidate of the National Party of Honduras. López Gutiérrez, not satisfied with the results, ordered that the National Congress could not resolve by ruling in favor of the virtual winner who would be Carias Andino by obtaining the majority of votes and as the candidate of the National Party.\nLópez attempt to stay in power\n, leader of the United Rebel Army during the First Honduran Civil War of 1919, attempted to stay in power, to the disapproval of half of the Liberal Party members, and the complete disapproval of the National Party.]]\nOn January 30, 1924, the settlement plan between the Liberal Party and the National Party was deemed to have failed. These conversations were known as \"Plan Paz Barahona\".\nAs there was no agreement, General Tiburcio Carías and the Dr. Juan Ángel Arias, together with 15 Cariístas and 18 Aristas from the Chamber of Deputies, supported Dr. Miguel Paz Barahona to be president of the nationcountry in the National Congress of Honduras. As such, General Tiburcio Carias Andino secretly left the capital, Tegucigalpa, at 7:00&nbsp;p.m., along with him several armed and leftist friends of his. His departure was interpreted as a signal to begin a war, and during the night, others left the capital to join the ranks of the newly formed \"Revolution\". January 31, 1924, was the last day of the Constitutional Government. The National Congress held a session in the afternoon, with the assistance of the Diplomatic Corps, but there was not enough quorum and the session was adjourned at 5:00&nbsp;p.m. Later, another session was held to select a president, or even a presidential designate, at the last minute, but there was still no quorum. At 9:00&nbsp;p.m., the National Congress adjourned indefinitely. President López Gutiérrez proclaimed himself dictator the next day, on February 1, 1924.2\nMembers of the opposing Liberal Party and the National Party saw López Gutiérrez as a threat to democracy in Honduras and national security, since the General commanded and managed the Armed Forces of Honduras at will.

Meanwhile, López Gutiérrez declared a \"state of siege\" and mobilizeds his troops.\nInternational reaction\nOn February 27, 1924, the governments of China, Spain, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy demanded the United States government to protect its citizens living in Honduras. At the time the country experienced an economic boom that led many Chinese, European (Spaniards, French, Italian, Jewish), and Arab immigrants to arrive to Honduras.
