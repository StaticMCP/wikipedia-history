But, another source says the palace and a flower garden was built by a Tamil king named Koolanghai in 104&nbsp;AD.\nThere were two main roadways and four temples at the four gateways that have now been destroyed. The rebuilt temples that exist now do not match their original locations which instead are occupied by churches erected by the Portuguese. The center of the city was Muthirai Santhai (market place) and was surrounded by a square fortification around it. There were courtly buildings for the kings, Brahmin priests, soldiers and other service providers in the palace premises. The old Nallur Kandaswamy temple functioned as a defensive fort with high walls. In general, the palace and the city was laid out like the traditional temple towns in South India.\nDestruction\nThe Jaffna Palace was significantly damaged during the Portuguese conquest of the Jaffna kingdom. The fall of Cankili II, the last of the ruling dynasty at the hands of a 5,000 men-strong Portuguese invaders inevitably meant the fall of the Jaffna throne.\nOver the next 40&nbsp;years, the Portuguese destroyed Hindu temples in the region, the royal repository of all literary output of the kingdom. Yamuna Eri, Cankili Thoppu archway, Ruins of the foundation of the Cankilian Thoppu and Mantri Manai are few of the only remaining parts of the palace apart from several small monuments that dot the compound.\nGallery\nFile:Statue of king Cankili II.JPG|Sangiliyan Statue\nFile:Cankilian Thoppu.JPG|Cankili Thopu, facade of the palace\nFile:Wood carving (Mantri Manai).JPG|Wood carving at Mantri Manai\nFile:Front top (Mantri Manai).JPG|Front top\nFile:Rear (Mantri Manai).JPG|Rear side\nFile:Indoor silhouette (Mantri Manai).JPG|Indoor, silhouette of the entrance\nFile:Inside (Mantri Manai).JPG|Inside, rear entrance and well\nReferences"
