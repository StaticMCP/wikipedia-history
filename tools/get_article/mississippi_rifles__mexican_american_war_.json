      "text": "# Mississippi Rifles (Mexican–American War)\n\n(watercolor painted  1860)]]\n, as manufactured by Eli Whitney in 1849 (U.S. Military Service Institute via Smithsonian Online)]]\nThere were three distinct groups known as Mississippi Rifles that responded to governor Albert Gallatin Brown's call for volunteers to supplement the forces of the regular army during the Mexican–American War.\n* The 1st Mississippi Rifles, led by future U.S. Senator and CSA president Jefferson Davis, had a glorious victory at the Battle of Buena Vista.\n* The 2nd Mississippi Rifles, commanded by Colonels Reuben Davis and Charles Clark, had a tragicomic war experience. The unit was beset by a horrific smallpox outbreak that killed scores; even the ones who were not killed outright suffered horribly just the same (the camp doctor reported pustules infested with maggots). The remainder of their service was both intensely boring and chaotic, the chaos being fueled by the battalion's poor training, deficient leadership, and the youthful exuberance of the soldiery. and William Faulkner's great-grandfather William Clark Falkner was shot while allegedly on a trip to visit the ladies. Later, back in Mississippi, Falkner Bowie-knifed to death a fellow veteran of the Mississippi Rifles, the brother of the man who made the allegation, Thomas C. Hindman (also a Rifles vet and future Confederate-American). }}\n* Anderson's Rifles, also known as the Mississippi Battalion, could fairly be called the third string of the Mississippi Rifles in the Mexican–American War. They make almost no appearances in the military and cultural histories of the conflict; they were briefly on garrison duty in Tampico.\n1st Regiment\nThe original 10 companies of the 1st Mississippi Rifles, as originally mustered:\n* Company A: Yazoo Rifles - Capt. John M. Sharp\n* Company B: Wilkinson Volunteers - Capt. Douglas H. Cooper\n* Company C: Vicksburg Southrons - Capt. John Willis\n* Company D: Carroll County Volunteers - Capt. Bainbridge D. Howard\n* Company E: State Fencibles - Capt. John L. McManus\n* Company F: Lafayette Volunteers - Capt. William Delay\n* Company G: Raymond Fencibles - Capt. Reuben Downing\n* Company H: Vicksburg Volunteers - Capt. George Crump\n* Company I: Marshall Guards - Capt. James H. R. Taylor\n* Company K: Tombigbee Volunteers - Capt. Alexander K. McClung\n2nd Regiment & Anderson's Rifles\nAccording to the Mississippi Encyclopedia, \"The 2nd Mississippi Rifles and Anderson's Battalion of Mississippi Rifles were raised as the result of later federal calls for troops. Neither unit participated in major combat operations...\" In regard to the latter group, a biography of the group's commander, another future Confederate named J. Patton Anderson, states \"In answer to the governor's call, Anderson organized a company of volunteers from the regiment of Mississippi militia in DeSoto County. He was elected captain. There is little information in records or newspapers regarding this battalion...\" According to a newspaper account of October 20, 1847, \"A battalion of five companies of riflemen from Mississippi, called out in July, has not yet been organized. It is supposed that it will be raised, and its strength may be estimated at 400.\" Anderson contracted malaria during his Mexican War service, and it caused him continuing health problems for the remainder of his life.\nSee also\n*List of United States military and volunteer units in the Mexican–American War\n* 155th Infantry Regiment (United States)\n* Hilliard P.
