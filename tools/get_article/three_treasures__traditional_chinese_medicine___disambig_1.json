They are also known as ,  and  (; \"essence, breath, and spirit\").\nThe French sinologist Despeux summarizes:\n, , and  are three of the main notions shared by Taoism and Chinese culture alike. They are often referred to as the Three Treasures ( ), an expression that immediately reveals their importance and the close connection among them. The ideas and practices associated with each term, and with the three terms as a whole, are complex and vary considerably in different contexts and historical periods.|}}\nEtymology and meaning\nThis Chinese name  originally referred to the Daoist \"Three Treasures\" from the Daodejing, chapter 67: \"pity\", \"frugality\", and \"refusal to be 'foremost of all things under heaven'\". It has subsequently also been used to refer to the  and  and to the Buddhist Three Jewels (Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha). This latter use is misleading, however, as the Three Jewels in Buddhism is a completely different philosophy. The Buddha is the teacher, the Dharma is the teaching, and the Sangha is the community. The Three Jewels of Buddhism are the external supports for achieving realization, while the Three Treasures of Daoism are interior qualities or attitudes to be cultivated.\nIn long-established Chinese traditions, the \"Three Treasures\" are the essential energies sustaining human life:\n*  () \"nutritive essence, essence; spirit, sperm, seed; extract; refined, perfected yin in nature, lower abdominal cavity\"\n*  () \"vital energy, life force; breath, air, vapor; vitality, vigor; attitude, abdominal cavity\"\n*  () \"spirit; soul, mind; god, deity; supernatural being and yang in action, upper thoracic cavity\"\nThis  ordering is more commonly used than the variants  and .\nNeidan\n'', a Daoist text on internal alchemy published 1615.

In particular, it emphasizes the so-called Three Treasures ( ), namely, vital essence (jing ), subtle breath ( ), and spirit ( ).|}}\nFrederic H. Balfour's brief 1884 essay about the \"Imprint of the Heart\" () contains the earliest known Western reference to the Three Treasures:\nFour stages\nIn  (\"internal alchemy\") practice, transmuting the Three Treasures is expressed through the sequence:\n#  ()\n#: \"laying the foundations\"\n#  ()\n#: \"refining essence into breath\"\n#  ()\n#: \"refining breath into spirit\"\n#  ()\n#: \"refining spirit and reverting to emptiness\"\nSanyuan\nBoth , Neo-Confucianism and Traditional Chinese Medicine distinguish the between \"pre heaven\" ( ), referring to what is innate or natural, and \"post heaven\" ( ), referring to what is acquired in the course of life.\nThe former are the \"three origins\" ( ):\n# \"Original essence\" ( )\n# \"Original breath\" ( )\n# \"Original spirit\" ( )\nXing\nThe Huainanzi () relates  and  to   (\"form; shape; body\"):\n] is the residence of life; the  fills this life while  controls it.
