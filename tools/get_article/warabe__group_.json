The group consisted of Atsumi Kurasawa, Tomoko Takabe and Mami Takahashi and made the first appearance in the show in September 1982. Warabe's major hit was the song \"\"Moshimo Ashita ga...\" (\"If tomorrow...\") which topped the Oricon Singles Chart for six weeks.\nIn June 1983, the weekly magazine Focus published a photograph of Tomoko Takabe allegedly smoking on her bed.  Following the incident she was suspended, and took part in the program on the phone expressing her remorse and singing \" Medaka no Kyôdai\"; her segment of the show recorded a massive 42 percent share of viewers. She was supposed to return but two months later Takabe's ex-boyfriend, who had provided the photo to the magazine, committed suicide, and she decided to withdraw from the program and from the group. The two remaining members eventually disbanded the group in 1985.\nGroup members\n* Atsumi Kurasawa (, born 20 April 1967), nicknamed Kanae.\n* Tomoko Takabe (, born 27 August 1967),  nicknamed Nozomi.\n* Mami Takahashi (, born 20 September 1967), nicknamed Tamae.\nDiscography\n;Albums\n* 1983 : Nozomi, Kanae, Tamae - Medaka no Kyôdai\n* 1984 : Moshi mo Ashita ga...\n* 1995 : Medaka no Kyôdai (Compilation)\n* 2011 : Imokin Trio & Warabe - Golden Best (Compilation)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
