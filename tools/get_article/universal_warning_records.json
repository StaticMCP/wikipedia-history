Universal Warning produces and releases independent music from local and national bands, as well as produces music videos, live concerts for DVD and digital transmission as well as music documentaries, primarily from the indie, punk, and hardcore genres.\nHistory\nThe label was established in the Spring of 2000 by founders Tim Martinkovich, Mike Varga, and Clint Weiler.  The three met while studying at Kutztown University.  The label was created as a foundation for the partners' punk-alternative band The Covert Agency and to promote area acts that the partners appreciated.\nAfter releasing a compilation of regional Pennsylvanian bands entitled The Warning Compilation during the founders last year in Kutztown, Martinkovitch moved the label and started their first office in Denver Colorado in Summer 2001.

Later that year the label branched out and began signing artists as far south as Louisiana, where Victim of Modern Age ruled the Lafayette scene.\nIn the Spring of 2008, Weiler left his position as publicist for the label to pursue free lance work and business ventures including a bobble head company called Aggronautix.\nSince its foundation in 2000, Universal Warning Records has had offices in Denver, Colorado, Richmond, Virginia and Royersford, Pennsylvania\nTo date, the label has released 19 CDs, 4 records, and 4 DVDs and filmed nearly 100 live shows including Earth Crisis and Sick of it All.\nIn May 2011, Universal Warning Records had its 10-year anniversary and the upstart of two new label imprints Fast Break Entertainment and Candy Colored Dragon.\nIndustry relationships\n* Universal Warning Records got their start releasing music by working with Ryan Fennical and his Marshalls Creek area recording studio.\n* The label has had a close relationship with popular Philadelphia indie rockers The Jazz June and their subsequent incarnation Snakes & Music, having released albums and DVDs by the band.\n* Universal Warning Records media has been distributed by Initial Records, Revelation Records, Lumberjack Distribution, Revolver, Very, Choke, Music Video Distributors, Carrot Top, and Hostile City Distribution.\n* Founder Mike Varga also owned Grata Video and produced or worked on videos and DVDs for Andrew W.K., DEVO, Dr. Dog and The Queers\nDiscography\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
