It resulted in MUP victory.\nBattle\nThe battle started as a Yugoslav response to the killing of a Serbian policeman who was killed by Albanians while conducting a house-to-house search for arms in which one Albanian woman and several others were beaten by Yugoslav forces.\nOn 28 January at 11:30 p.m., a large group of KLA soldiers encountered a police patrol near the village of Bistražin while crossing the Erenik river. In the exchange of fire, two police officers, Dragan Vukmanović and Goran Jović were wounded, and three KLA members were killed. After that, the police began searching for the terrorist group.\nAt 6:30 a.m. on 29 January, about a dozen police officers set out to Rugovo, on the Đakovica - Prizren road, to arrest KLA soldiers who had attacked the police the previous day. As they approached the house of Xhevdet Berisha, fire was opened, killing Predrag Raković (21). A clash ensued, in which the police eliminated the entire KLA group there. The fighting resulted in the deaths of 19 KLA soldiers. 1 MUP was killed and 2 were wounded.\nAfter the conflict, the Serbian authorities invited observers from the Kosovo Verfication Mission, who had the opportunity to see what happened. A forensic group composed of Serbian and Belarusian forensic experts conducted an analysis of the bodies of the killed KLA soldiers. The International monitors found that Serbian claims of the Albanians killed being members of the KLA were innacurate as most killed were in civilian clothing.\nReferences\n:Category:Conflicts in 1999\n:Category:Military operations of the Kosovo War\n:Category:Battles involving FR Yugoslavia\n:Category:1999 in Kosovo"
