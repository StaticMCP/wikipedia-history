On August 7, 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Chen to a seat on the United States District Court for the Northern District of California vacated by the resignation of Martin Jenkins. On October 15, 2009, the Senate Judiciary Committee advanced his nomination by a 12–7 vote. On December 24, 2009, the U.S. Senate returned Chen's nomination to the president. Senator Dianne Feinstein in an interview published in the San Francisco Chronicle on December 29, 2009 reiterated her support for Judge Chen and her hope that the President would renominate Judge Chen for the U.S. District Court.\nPresident Obama renominated Chen in January 2010, and the Senate Judiciary Committee approved his nomination on February 4, 2010. On August 5, 2010, the U.S. Senate again returned Chen's nomination for failure to confirm him. President Obama renominated Chen to the seat on September 13, 2010 and again on January 5, 2011. On May 10, 2011, the United States Senate confirmed Chen by a 56–42 vote. He received his judicial commission on May 12, 2011. Since being confirmed as a District Judge, Chen has been a prolific writer, authoring a number of major opinions.

On June 21, 2012, the charity fraud case of Carreon v. Inman et al, which has achieved some prominence on the Internet, was assigned to Chen.\nJudge Chen presided over the trial in a case brought by Food and Water Watch et al. against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) relevant to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and water fluoridation\n. On September 24, 2024, Judge Chen found for the plaintiff, ordering the EPA to mitigate the risk per TSCA regulations. He wrote in his decision that \"the Court finds that fluoridation of water at 0.7 milligrams per liter (“mg/L”) – the level presently considered “optimal” in the United States – poses an unreasonable risk of reduced IQ in children.\" He further wrote: \"This order does not dictate\nprecisely what that response must be. Amended TSCA leaves that decision in the first instance to\nthe EPA. One thing the EPA cannot do, however, in the face of this Court’s finding, is to ignore\nthat risk.\"\nSee also\n* Barack Obama judicial appointment controversies\n* List of Asian American jurists\n* List of first minority male lawyers and judges in California\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n|years=2011–2022}}"
