It connects the Malecón with Habana del Este in Havana, Cuba.\nHistory\nThe Vía Monumental, at the time known as the Avenida Monumental (Monumental Avenue), was officially known as Highway 2–19, around the 1960s.\nCharacteristics\nIt has six lanes, with  lanes, and a central divider. The speed limit on most sections is .\nConstruction\nDuring the 1950s, the towns in eastern Havana weren't connected to the main city. There was no adequate road to pass near there. The Vía Blanca had just been built, which connected Havana and the tourist center of Varadero with Matanzas, Guanabacoa, Regla, Diez de Octubre, Marianao and San Miguel del Padrón. One of the first ideas to build a road was to cross the Bay of Havana. Two proposals were made: a bridge and a tunnel. For the bridge it was a problem, because if a hurricane occurred the bridge would likely collapse. Then a tunnel, instead, would be a better option, 12 meters below sea level, allowing any ship to cross the entrance channel. Since 1954, construction of this road began, which passed through Casablanca, the Reparto Camilo Cienfuegos, the Villa Panamericana, Cojímar and Berroa.\nRoute\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"4\" |Vía Monumental\n|-\n|Exit\n|km\n|Municipio\n|Notes\n|-\n|Havana Tunnel\n|0\n|Old Havana, Habana del Este\n|Part of Circuito Norte\n|-\n|Road of Morro\n|\n|Habana del Este\n|Part of Circuito Norte\n|-\n|Road of Astilo\n|\n|Habana del Este\n|Part of Circuito Norte\n|-\n|Naval Roundabout\n|\n|Habana del Este\n|Part of Circuito Norte\n|-\n|Baragua Roundabout\n|\n|Habana del Este\n|Part of Circuito Norte\n|-\n|Avenida Vía Túnel\n|\n|Habana del Este\n|Part of Circuito Norte\n|-\n|Rotonda de Alamar\n|\n|Habana del Este\n|Part of Circuito Norte\n|-\n| 2–I–3 (Circuito Norte / Vía Blanca)\n|\n|Habana del Este\n|Part of Circuito Norte\n|-\n|Zona Industrial Berroa\n|\n|Habana del Este\n|\n|-\n| 2–131 (Independencia Este)\n|\n|Guanabacoa\n|\n|-\n| A2\n|\n|Guanabacoa\n|\n|-\n| 2–191 (Road to Peñalver) (no exit, enter only)\n|\n|Guanabacoa\n|\n|-\n| A1\n|\n|Guanabacoa, Cotorro, San José de las Lajas\n|\n|-\n| 2–241 (Road of Alberro)\n|\n|Cotorro, San Jose de las Lajas\n|\n|-\n|  2–N–1 (Carretera Central / Calle 101) / 2–400 (Calle 100)\n|\n|Cotorro\n|\n|}\nThis road has  bordering the entire east of Havana, where it is part of the Circuito Norte from the tunnel to the intersection with Vía Blanca, in Berroa.\nReferences"
