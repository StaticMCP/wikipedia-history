The cause was a dispute over revenue from oil extraction in nearby Obioku village by Shell Nigeria, which was claimed by both Nembe Bassambiri and by the village of Odioma. In October 2004, Iwowari conducted elaborate ceremonies to mark the end of the crisis.\nIn January 2009, thugs supporting an unpopular political candidate invaded the Bassambiri community. Early reports said over 40 people might have died, the King's palace had been barred with palm fronds signifying danger fortunately he was not hurt. After things had settled down, just one body was found floating in a canal, although there were many injuries. The state governor invited Iwowari and local leaders to a meeting to find a solution to the conflict.\nIn April 2010, the Bayelsa State government attempted once more to resolve the ongoing discord between the Bassambiri and Ogbolomabiri communities, bringing together Ralph Michael Iwowari MEIN VII, Amanyanabo of Nembe-Bassambiri with Edmund Daukoru, Amanyanabo of Nembe Kingdom and other chiefs to find a solution. After the meeting, both kings said they were optimistic that the differences between the two feuding communities could be resolved.\nHe died in 2013 and was buried on 30 November 2014.\nReferences"
