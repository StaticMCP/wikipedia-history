The river is crossed by both the Bruce Highway and North Coast railway line. From source to mouth, the river descends  over its  course.\nThe Styx River is wide at its mouth, resulting in a tidal bore at certain times. Much of the river valley remains natural leaving the water quality in a healthy state.\nSee also\n}}\n*\nReferences"
