It is found in the dry Fynbos and Renosterveld shrub vegetation, in the centre of the Western Cape province, South Africa.\nDescription\nA medium-sized dwarf chameleon, with a relatively robust build and a long prehensile tail, it can grow up to 15&nbsp;cm in length. It is generally grey-olive in colour, but individuals have been found that vary.\nNatural range\nThis species occurs in the Little Karoo, and the surrounding mountain ranges, within the Western Cape, South Africa.\nIt is recorded as far west as the border of the Cederberg mountains, and as far east as Uniondale. In the south it occurs near the coast in the area of Robertson and on the Agulhas plain.\nHabitat\nIt prefers the fynbos vegetation, unlike some other species of dwarf chameleons that are forest-dwellers. It is particularly adapted to dry fynbos, renosterveld and is even found in the transition zones to arid succulent Karoo vegetation. DNA evidence suggests the Robertson chameleon may have diverged from the forest-dwellers several million years ago, coinciding with the retreat of the forests and the spread of dry fynbos.\nSources\n* Tolley K. and Burger M. 2007.
