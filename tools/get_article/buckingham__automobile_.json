The company had made cars under the Chota name from 1912.\nHistory\nThe first cars were a 746&nbsp;cc cyclecar and a 1492&nbsp;cc V-twin-engined light car both previously sold as Chotas. The engines were to Buckingham's own design  and were water-cooled.\nProduction was suspended during World War I and during the conflict Captain Buckingham, the company owner, gained fame as the inventor of the tracer bullet, which was used against airships.\nIn 1920 he returned to car production with a new model using an air-cooled version of the pre war V-twin engine but now with a capacity of 1096&nbsp;cc, a two-speed gearbox and belt drive to the rear axle. A three-speed gearbox was fitted from 1922 with shaft drive and a rear axle incorporating a differential. Front suspension was by a transverse leaf spring and the rear by quarter elliptic leaf springs. The two-seat bodies were made by the coachbuilder Charlesworth.\nA coupé version was called the \"Palace\".\nFrom 1922 to 1923 manufacture of the car was undertaken by Alvis but it is estimated that they only made about 30 of the cars.\nPopular culture\n*The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, 1959's \"The Buckingham\" (S07•E32) episode in which Ricky and David buy one and later regret the high costs and low gas mileage. The vehicle in fact was not a Buckingham, but rather a 1939 Lagonda V12 drophead coupé, the most expensive car at 1939's 40th Anniversary of the New York International Motor Show, which the Ozzie filmmakers misidentified as a Buckingham.\nSee also\n* List of car manufacturers of the United Kingdom\nReferences\nOther sources\n*David Burgess Wise, The New Illustrated Encyclopedia of Automobiles.\nExternal links\n*[http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/images/4/4b/Im19191108CyCar-Buckingham.jpg November 1919 advertisement]"
