Enshrined in the 1848 Swiss Constitution in Article 12 was a prohibition on the acceptance of honours and titles by Swiss citizens. In the current Swiss constitution there is no specific prohibition on titles and orders, however there is a statute that covers the prohibition previously covered by Article 12.\nThe Swiss military maintains a system of awards which recognize length of service, training, sports, and mission participation.\nAward ribbons\nLength of Service Decorations\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=3| Length of Service Decoration\n|-\n! style=\"width:60px;\"| Emblem\n! style=\"width:335px;\"| Name\n!
