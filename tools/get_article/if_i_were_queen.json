It is based on a short story by Du Vernett Rabell. FBO handled the distribution of the film. It is not known whether the film currently survives.\nThe title of the film may have been changed from that of the original short story because it bears slight resemblance to the Fox film If I Were King, which had come out a couple years before.\nCast\n*Ethel Clayton as Ruth Townley\n*Andree Lejon as Oluf\n*Warner Baxter as Vladimir\n*Victory Bateman as Aunt Ollie\n*Murdock MacQuarrie as Duke of Wortz\n*Genevieve Blinn as Sister Ursula\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
