The Castilian force was ambushed and destroyed.\nBackground\nAlmoravids continued to harass Toledo under the Almoravid prince, Tashfin bin Ali, the son of Ali ibn Yusuf, who governed Al-Andalus from Granada in the years 1128–1138. The Almoravids took Colmenar de Oreja as their base in the east and Calatrava la Vieja in the south. Almoravid forces raided Tagus and tried to isolate Toleda; however, they did not attempt to hold on to the forts they captured; instead, they destroyed them. At the south, Calatrava was governed by Al-Faraj. Another Almoravid commander, Ali, was the governor of Santisteban del Puerto.\nBattle\nIn 1131, the two generals launched a raid against Toledo with a cavalry force. They made their way to Toledo secretly at night and began setting up ambushes in the outskirts. In the early morning of the next day, a few Almoravid horsemen appeared before the castle of Alamín, near Escalona. The Almoravids made a ruse, attempting to steal cattle in the countryside and flee to provoke the Castilians. The governor of Toledo, Gutierre Armíldez, who was at Alamín Castle, set out with a force of 40 knights to pursue them. The Almoravids emerged from their positions and ambushed the Castilians. A fierce battle ensued. Gutierre Armíldez was killed alongside the majority of his men. Another notable knight, Muño Alfonso, was captured alongside others.\nAftermath\nMuño was sent to Cordoba and imprisoned, but days later, he was able to ransom himself with gold, silver, horses, and many weapons. Muño would be notable later in waging campaigns against the Almoravids.\nReferences\nSources\n*Richard Fletcher & Simon Barton (2000), The World of El Cid, Chronicles of the Spanish Reconquest.[https://books.google.com/books?id=GDMoa4EzrcMC&dq=Aceca+1130&pg=PA210]\n*Derek W.
