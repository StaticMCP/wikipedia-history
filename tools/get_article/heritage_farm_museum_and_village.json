Originally conceived as a location to house and display the private collection of A. Michael \"Mike\" and Henriella Perry, Heritage Farm has expanded into an entire Appalachian Frontier Village that was recently named West Virginia's first Smithsonian-affiliated museum.\nHistory\nIn 1973, co-founders Mike and Henriella Perry decided to relocate from Huntington city proper to a farmhouse on the outskirts of town in Harveytown. Their interest was piqued by the old wooden logs they discovered beneath the walls of their house. Their efforts to understand the tools and techniques involved in building a cabin, coupled with their hobby of antiquing, led to the genesis of what would become Heritage Farm. Originally a private collection housed in a nearby barn, they soon began to accumulate authentic old structures and materials that they felt would convey an appreciation for everyday life in Appalachia from the 19th century to the present. Heritage Farm in its current sense began with the first \"May Festival\" on May 4, 1996. This event was the only day the village was open on an annual basis until 2006.\nCurrently, Heritage Farm welcomes guests from May through October on Fridays and Saturdays. In December, 4 evenings are designated as \"Christmas Village,\" during which the buildings are decorated with lights and holiday activities are available.\nMuseums\nHeritage Farm has seven main museum buildings:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
