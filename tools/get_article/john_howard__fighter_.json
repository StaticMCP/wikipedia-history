A professional competitor since 2004, Howard has formerly competed for the International Fight League, the Ultimate Fighting Championship, CES MMA, the Cage Fury Fighting Championships and Professional Fighters League.\nBackground\nHoward was born and raised by his mother, Laurette, along with his sister in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, where he still resides to this day. Howard got into fights often while growing up. In high school, Howard played football and basketball. He found martial arts after going to a Job Corps to get his high school diploma, where he learned grappling from a freestyle grappler. Later on in his career, he has become well known for his wrestling skills and takedowns in MMA despite not having any background in it. After graduating, Howard began training at a local gym. Howard once sparred against Tamerlan Tsarnaev, a boxer, when the two trained at Wai Kru Mixed Martial Arts in Boston.\nNickname: \"Doomsday\"\nHoward's nickname, \"Doomsday,\" was given to him by his longtime friend Henry Ainslie during a car ride as they discussed powerful comic book villains and potential fighter aliases. After joking around, the name \"Doomsday\" — inspired by the infamous character who killed Superman — stuck. In his first official fight, the announcer mistakenly introduced him as \"John, The Doomsday,\" which was later corrected to the now-famous \"John 'Doomsday' Howard.\"\nTraining\nOver the course of his career, Howard has trained with top-tier coaches and teams around the world. His training includes time in Thailand, Brazil, and across the United States. He has been affiliated with several notable gyms:\n* Ginsberg Academy Jujitsu – Cambridge, MA\n* Waikru MMA – Allston, MA\n* Sityodtong Muay Thai / MMA – Somerville, MA\n* Team Grudge – Denver, CO\nNotable coaches and training partners include:\n* John Allen\n* David Ginsberg\n* Mark Nardone\n* Nate Marquardt\n* Scott Ream\n* Eric Grossman\n* Jorge Rivera (retired UFC fighter)\n* Alexandre \"Alex\" Costa (Gracie Barra Boston)\nLegacy and Entrepreneurship\nOn March 1, 2025, Howard opened his own training facility, the Doomsday Defense Dojo in South Easton, Massachusetts. The gym is one of the only known Black-owned mixed martial arts schools in the region. It serves as a community space and training academy for youth, adults, and aspiring professional fighters. In addition to MMA instruction, the gym offers fitness programs and self-defense classes.\nSpeaking on the launch of his dojo, Howard said, “Opening Doomsday Defense Dojo is a dream come true — not just for me, but for my community. This isn’t just about fighting; it’s about building confidence, protecting yourself, and breaking cycles. I want kids, adults, everyone who walks in that door to feel seen, strong, and ready for life.”\nAdvocacy and Representation\nIn 2016, Howard was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder at age 33. The diagnosis, which followed a series of neurological tests, gave him clarity about many of his life experiences. “Now a lot of stuff in my life makes sense,” Howard said in an interview. “It makes sense why I do certain things. Even to this day.”\nFollowing the diagnosis, Howard has used his platform to advocate for neurodivergent athletes. Through public speaking, media interviews, and inclusive programming at his dojo, he works to break stigma and encourage others to embrace their uniqueness. His gym offers sensory-friendly training and promotes martial arts as a tool for building confidence and communication for individuals on the spectrum.\nMixed martial arts career\nUltimate Fighting Championship\nHoward made his UFC debut on January 31, 2009, against Chris Wilson at UFC 94, winning via split decision.\nHe then faced Tamdan McCrory at UFC 101.
