      "text": "# Battles of Alashiya\n\nThe Battles of Alashiya were a series of two naval engagements and one joint land and naval operation fought between the Hittite Navy and the Hittite Army of the Hittite Empire and the Alashiyan Navy and Alashiyan Army of the Kingdom of Alashiya (Cyprus); they took place between 1275 BC and 1205 BC.\nHistory\nThe Hittite Empire had laid claim to the Kingdom of Alashiya, located in modern-day Cyprus, since the late 14th century BC. In 1370 BC, the Hittites were attacked by the forces of Lukka and Kizzuwatna, later known in ancient history as the regions of Lycia and Cilicia. This attack provoked the Hittites into sending an invasion force against Alashiya on three occasions between 1275 BC and 1205 BC. The Hittite Navy engaged the Alashiyan fleet off the coast of Cyprus whilst the Hittite Army engaged Alashiyan land forces on the beach under the command of Great King Suppiluliuma II. The Battles of Alashiya were one of the earliest series of sea battles in recorded history; they resulted in a Hittite victory.\nFootnotes\nBibliography\n* Connolly, Peter; Gillingham, John; Lazenby, John (2016).
