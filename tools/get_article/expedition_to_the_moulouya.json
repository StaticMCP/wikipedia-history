They scored a victory at Sidi Bel Abbess and seized the city of Tlemcen.\nFollowing the seizure of Tlemcen, Arudj Reis made conquests in the eastern lands of Morocco. He pushed his conquests to the Moulouya. He captured and garrisoned Tibda, Oujda and Debdou. He then conducted raids in the lands of the Beni Snassen and forced the Beni Amer and Beni Snassen to recognise his authority and imposed a tribute on them.\nAfter these successes, the Spanish sought to take back Tlemcen and restore a client ruler, this ultimately resulted in the Fall of Tlemcen (1518).\nReferences"
