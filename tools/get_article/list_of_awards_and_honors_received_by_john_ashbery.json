Video of the event is included below.]]\nAmerican poet John Ashbery (1927–2017) received numerous awards, nominations, grants, fellowships, and other honors in his lifetime. He was generally regarded as the most-honored poet of his generation and one of the most-honored American writers of any era.\nHe received his first award, the 92nd Street Y Discovery Prize for unpublished poets, in 1952. Four years later, W. H. Auden selected him as the winner of the Yale Series of Younger Poets Competition, resulting in the publication of his debut poetry collection Some Trees. His 1975 collection Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror became the first book to win a Pulitzer Prize, a National Book Award, and a National Book Critics Circle Award. To date, Ashbery remains the only writer to attain the achievement, which has been called the \"Triple Crown\" of American literature.\nBeyond prizes and awards, Ashbery was a recipient of several monetary grants and fellowships that provided crucial support for his literary ambitions and travel. As a Fulbright scholar, he moved to France in 1955 to study French poetry and teach. He continued to live in the country for nearly a decade thereafter. Years later, the people of France conferred several honors in recognition of his lifelong engagement with French poetry and culture, most notably by making him an officer of the national Legion of Honor. In 1985 he received a MacArthur Fellowship—an unconditional cash prize informally known as the \"Genius Grant\"—allowing him to quit his job as a professor and write poetry full-time. He also received two Guggenheim Fellowships and two grants from the National Endowment for the Arts. Poems by Ashbery were often anthologized among the year's best.\nAshbery had acquired a reputation as a prolific prize-winner by the early 1990s.}} According to James F. English's 2004 book The Economy of Prestige, Ashber had received more awards than any other poet in the world. English counted 45 awards for Ashbery, followed by Irish poet Seamus Heaney at 30 awards and fellow American poet Adrienne Rich at 25 awards. David Lehman observed that Ashbery also held a lead over the novelist John Updike, winner of 39 awards, and therefore Ashbery likely stood as the most-honored of any living American writer—at least in terms of sheer quantity of awards.1, fn.2 — these footnotes clarify that Lehman was citing English's book)}} Although he was considered a perennial contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature over the last three decades of his life—and almost certainly the leading candidate among American poets during that period—he never became a Nobel laureate.\nAccolades for individual works\n92Y Discovery Prize\nin 2019]]\nThe Discovery Prize is an award given to poets who have not yet published their debut book. It is given out annually by the 92nd Street Y (also called 92Y), a cultural and community center in Manhattan run by the Young Men's Hebrew Association (now called the Jewish Community Center).\n(30:21)\n:April 3, 1952 – Via SoundCloud\n----\nAshbery's reading at the 92nd Street Y from the night he received his first literary award, the Discovery Prize.\n}}\nAshbery received the Discovery Prize on April 3, 1952, as the winner of what was then called the Poetry Center Introductions contest. He shared the award with Harvey Shapiro and Gray Burr. The contest that year had hundreds of competing applicants and was judged by John Malcolm Brinnin, Kimon Friar, and Richard Wilbur. It was Ashbery's first literary award. He gave a reading of sixteen poems at the award ceremony—his first since graduating college. When asked to judge the Discovery Prize competition in 2014, he replied, \"I'll have to say yes, since the contest was the beginning of my poetry career, a mere 52 years ago.\"\nALA Notable Books\nSince 1944, the American Library Association (ALA) has compiled annual lists of Notable Books for adults. The winners are selected by the Notable Books Council, a subgroup within the ALA's Reference and User Services Association (RUSA), which also makes other award decisions. The criteria, as described in 2012, are:\n}}\nBooks written by Ashbery have been listed three times: once in 1978 for Houseboat Days, again in 1982 for Shadow Train, and a final time in 2012 for his translation of the French poet Arthur Rimbaud's Illuminations.\n!\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1978\n| Houseboat Days\n| rowspan=\"3\" | ALA Notable Book\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1982\n| Shadow Train\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2012\n| Illuminations\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|}\n\"Best-of\" anthologies\nIn general, Ashbery was among the top 25 most frequently anthologized American poets of the latter half of the 20th century.1}} In most cases, literary anthologies either attempt to define a set of \"canonical\" works or collect writings united by a common characteristic such as historical time period, region, author identity, genre, etc. Although inclusion in such anthologies can be considered prestigious, they are not understood to be \"prizes\" or \"awards\" per se. The following anthologies were competitive selections of the previous year's \"best\" poetry, as judged by an editor or panel of editors.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"table-layout: fixed; margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Poem\n! scope=\"col\" | Anthology\n! scope=\"col\" | Series\n! scope=\"col\" | Compiling editor or nominator\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1970\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1977\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1988\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"10\" |\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1989\n| ...\"}}\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1990\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1991\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1992\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1993\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1994\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1997\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" | 1998\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n| Three poems:\n* \"Baked Alaska\"\n* \"Myrtle\"\n* \"The Problem of Anxiety\"\n| ]]}}\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Some Trees\" |Five poems from Some Trees(1956):\n* \"The Instruction Manual\"\n* \"The Young Son\"\n* \"Some Trees\"\n* \"The Painter\"\n* \"The Pied Piper\"\n|\n| Yale Series of Younger Poets Competition\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2001\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"5\" |\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2002\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2004\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2005\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 2006\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 2008\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n| (2007):\n* \"Someone You Have Seen Before\"\n* \"Token Resistance\"\n* \"Chapter II, Book 35\"\n* \"Memories of Imperialism\"\n* \"The New Higher\"\n* \"Interesting People of Newfoundland\"}}\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2009\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"7\" |\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2010\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2011\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 2013\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2014\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2017\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2019\n| data-sort-value=\"Some Threes\" |Three poems from Some Trees(1956):\n* \"A Boy\"\n* \"Errors\"\n* \"Answering a Question in the Mountains\"\n|\n| Yale Series of Younger Poets Competition\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|}\nBorestone Mountain Poetry Awards\nanthology included Ashbery's poem \"Soonest Mended\".]]\nThe Borestone Mountain Poetry Awards were a nonprofit literary foundation and annual poetry anthology series released between 1949 and 1977. The Borestone Mountain Poetry Awards anthologies collected the editors' selections of the best original English-language poems of no more than 100 lines published the preceding year in literary magazines. After making an initial selection, the editors read poems with the names of the author and original publication removed and assigned scores. The authors of the three highest-scoring poems received cash prizes and were designated as First, Second, and Third place in the anthology.\nAshbery's poem \"Soonest Mended\", first published in The Paris Review and included in his collection The Double Day of Spring(1970), was chosen for Best Poems of 1969: Borestone Mountain Poetry Awards 1970. It did not receive one of the top three placements.\nPushcart Prize\nPublished annually since 1976, the Pushcart Prize anthologizes the best writing from independently published periodicals including poetry, fiction and nonfiction. Ashbery's poem \"All Kinds of Caresses\" appeared in The Pushcart Prize, II: Best of the Small Presses. It was nominated by the Chicago Review, the same journal in which it was first published. Ashbery was also a contributing editor for that volume and nominated Douglas Crase's \"Cuylerville\" and James Schuyler's \"Song\". Joan Murray and other Pushcart editors also selected the poem for The Pushcart Book of Poetry: The Best Poems From Three Decades of the Pushcart Prize(2006).\nThe Best American Poetry\nThe Best American Poetry series launched in 1988 and is edited by David Lehman. Each year, a different guest editor selects 75 of the year's best American poetry published the preceding year. Ashbery was the guest editor for the first volume, The Best American Poetry 1988, in which he selected his own \"One Coat of Paint\". Between 1989 and 2017, poems of his were chosen 20 times. Three of those poems were included again in The Best of the Best American Poetry 1988–1997, which compiled Harold Bloom's selections from the 750 poems in the first ten years of the series. His poem \"Wakefulness\", originally chosen in the 1998 volume, was selected by Robert Pinsky for The Best of the Best American Poetry: 25th Anniversary Edition(2013).\nAnthologies related to other awards\nAshbery's debut collection Some Trees was chosen as the 52nd winner of the Yale Series of Younger Poets Competition and published by Yale University Press in 1956. Five poems from the book were subsequently included in The Yale Younger Poets Anthology, edited by George Bradley and published in 1998: \"The Instruction Manual\", \"The Young Son\", \"Some Trees\", \"The Painter\", and \"The Pied Piper\". Later, three poems from Some Trees—\"A Boy\", \"Errors\", and \"Answering a Question in the Mountains\"—were chosen for the series' 2019 centennial anthology Firsts: 100 Years of Yale Younger Poets, edited by Carl Phillips. See the section on the Yale Series of Younger Poets Prize below.\nSix of Ashbery's poems were included in The Griffin Poetry Prize 2008 Anthology because his book Notes from the Air: Selected Later Poems was shortlisted for the international Griffin Poetry Prize. He ultimately won that year's international prize. See the section on the Griffin Prize below.\nBingham Poetry Prize\nThe Bingham Poetry Prize was an award given by the literary magazine Boston Book Review. now defunct Boston Book Review ('not to be confused with the Boston )\" ...}}}}}} Established in 1993, the Boston Book Review published ten issues annually until it ceased publication in 2000 and, around 1997–98, reportedly had the third-highest circulation of any American book review periodical. Along with the magazine's Fisk Fiction Prize and Rea Non-Fiction Prize, the Bingham Poetry Prize was an annual award to \"celebrate excellent literary accomplishments\" that had been published the previous year. Each of the three awards carried a cash prize of $1,000.\nAshbery was a co-winner of the Bingham Poetry Prize for The Mooring of Starting Out: The First Five Books of Poetry, a compilation of his early work. Judged by Jorie Graham, the 1998 prize was also awarded to Frank Bidart, who won for his collection Desire.\n!\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1998\n| The Mooring of Starting Out: The First Five Books of Poetry\n| The Bingham Poetry Prize\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|}\nGriffin Poetry Prize\nin 2008.]]\nThe Griffin Poetry Prize is an annual Canadian literary award established in 2000 by the Griffin Trust for Excellence in Poetry \"to serve and encourage excellence in poetry written in or translated into English anywhere in the world.\" A cash prize is split between winners in two categories: one Canadian and one international author.\nAshbery won the 2008 Griffin Poetry Prize for Notes from the Air: Selected Later Poems.

The award was accompanied by a $300 cash prize. The foundation first gave out awards in 1959 for poetry published in 1957 and 1958.\nThe second awards were announced in March 1960 for poetry published in 1959, though the announcement did not mention Ashbery. However, he did receive a Longview Foundation Award for two poems, \"How Much Longer Will I Be Able to Inhabit the Divine Sepulcher ...\" and \"April Fool's Day\", both of which had been published in Big Table Volume 1, Number 3 (1959). The judges were Saul Bellow, Louise Bogan, Charles Boni, Alfred Kazin, Thomas B. Hess, and Henri Peyre.

The awards, currently administered by the National Book Foundation, have been organized by a variety of groups throughout their history. The National Book Award for Poetry has been bestowed annually since 1950, except for a hiatus between 1984 and 1990. Ashbery won the award once and was a finalist three times.\nIn 1967, the National Book Committee named Rivers and Mountains as a poetry finalist. It was selected by a judges panel of W. H. Auden, James Dickey, and Howard Nemerov. In 1976, Ashbery won the award—and its cash prize of $1,000—for Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror. The poetry judges were Babette Deutsch (who was also the panel's chairperson), John Malcolm Brinnin, and James Scully. The awards were administered by the National Institute of Arts and Letters for the first time that year, following the surprise disappearance of the National Book Committee.\nWhen Ashbery was a finalist in 1982 for Shadow Train, the awards were run by the Association of American Publishers and had been renamed the American Book Awards—a change introduced in 1980 that lasted until 1987, when they reverted to the former title. Ashbery received his fourth and final nomination for Where Shall I Wander in 2005, by which time the National Book Foundation coordinated the awards. As a finalist, Ashbery received a $1,000 cash prize and a bronze medal; winners received $10,000 and a bronze statuette.\n!\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1967\n| Rivers and Mountains\n| rowspan=\"2\" | National Book Award for Poetry\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1976\n| Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1982\n| Shadow Train\n| National Book Award for Poetry (presented as the American Book Award for Poetry)\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2005\n| Where Shall I Wander\n| National Book Award for Poetry\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|}\nNational Book Critics Circle Award\nbecame the first book to win the National Book Critics Circle Award for Poetry.]]\nAshbery won the inaugural National Book Critics Circle Award for Poetry and was nominated another four times.

The award is given by the National Book Critics Circle, an association of editors and critics founded in 1974 in New York City. According to Ashbery, the award itself was \"almost invented\" for him.10}} In an interview with Mark Ford, Ashbery recalled an exchange reportedly sparked by a negative review for his Self-Portrait in The New York Review of Books:\n10}}}}\nThe National Book Critics Circle nominated three more of his original collections: Houseboat Days in 1977, A Wave in 1984, and April Galleons in 1987.

His first, in 1963, was the Harriet Monroe Memorial Prize of $100 for five poems in that year's June issue. That year's prize winners were decided by a panel of Wallace Fowlie, Joseph Wiley, and then-editor Henry Rago. Three years later, the same three judges awarded Ashbery the Union League Civic and Arts Foundation Poetry Prize of $100 for the poem \"Fragment\", published in February 1966. The prize was sponsored by the Union League Club of Chicago.\nIn 1974 he received the Frank O'Hara Prize, named in memory of his friend and fellow poet Frank O'Hara, who had died in 1966. The award and its $500 cash prize recognized poems from the November 1973, April 1974, and August 1974 issues, which included the title poem from Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror and others that would appear in the same collection. He received the $300 Levinson Prize, named for the attorney Salmon Levinson and created by an endowment of his family, in 1977 for poems in the April and August issues.

Ashbery won the Pulitzer for Poetry in 1976 and was a finalist in 1993.]]\nThe Pulitzer Prizes have been administered by Columbia University since 1917 and are currently awarded in 21 categories for accomplishments in journalism, literature, and music. Columbia first awarded an informal Poetry Prize in 1918 and formally introduced the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1922. The winner of a Pulitzer Prize for Poetry receives a certificate and a cash prize. Although the value of the cash prize has steadily increased throughout the years, it has been considered fairly low within the field of literary awards throughout most of its history. However, the award's high public prestige and associated rise in sales have outpaced other awards with higher cash prizes.\nSelf-Portrait in a Convex Mirror won the 1976 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry. At that time, the award's cash prize was $1,000. The book was unanimously selected by a jury of Anthony Hecht, Richard Howard, and Mark Strand, who also shortlisted Buried City by Howard Moss, The Western Approaches by Howard Nemerov, and Tales Told by Fathers by John Hollander. In the jury's report to the Pulitzer Advisory Board, Hecht wrote:\n... Ashbery has responded to those impulses of recuperation, of recurrence and reversion which poetry incarnates, observing its beginning and endings by a prosody of intermittence and collage rather than by any such conventional markings as rhyme or refrain.}}\nAshbery was a finalist in 1993 for Hotel Lautréamont, nominated by a jury of Frank Bidart, Bonnie Costello, and Charles Wright. Louise Glück won that year for The Wild Iris, while James Merrill's Selected Poems 1946–1985 was also nominated.\n!\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1976\n| Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Pulitzer Prize for Poetry\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1993\n| Hotel Lautréamont\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|}\nShelley Memorial Award\nNamed for the English Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792–1822), the Shelley Memorial Award was established in 1929. It is administered by the Poetry Society of America (PSA) and awarded on the basis of \"genius and need\". The three-person jury is appointed by the president (chancellor) of the University of California, Berkeley, the president of Radcliffe College, and the PSA board of directors.\nIn 1973, Ashbery and Richard Wilbur were both awarded the Shelley Memorial Award. He received a cash prize of $1,800. The award was granted in recognition of his collection Three Poems(1972).\n!\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1973\n| Three Poems\n| Shelley Memorial Award\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|}\nSWR-Bestenliste\nSüdwestrundfunk (SWR) is a German public broadcasting corporation with television and radio stations. SWR releases the  (Best List), a monthly ranking of recently released books as scored by a jury of critics. SWR's predecessor Südwestfunk (SWF) began the Bestenliste in 1976, when it was conceived as an alternative to Der Spiegels strictly sales-based booklist.\nGerman translations of Ashbery's poetry have appeared on the Bestenliste twice. Ein weltgewandtes Land, a bilingual edition of the collection A Worldly Country with translations by multiple German poets, ranked in first place on the December 2010 list with 69 points. Flussbild, a bilingual edition of Flow Chart with a German translation by  and Uda Strätling, ranked tenth in May 2013 with 29 points.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"table-layout: fixed; margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Book\n! scope=\"col\" | List\n! scope=\"col\" | Rank\n! scope=\"col\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2010\n| Ein weltgewandtes Land\n| SWR-Bestenliste\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2013\n| Flussbild and Uda Strätling}}\n| SWR-Bestenliste\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|}\nYale Series of Younger Poets Prize\n1956}}\n| alt1 =\n| image2 = Some Trees.jpg\n| caption2 =\n| alt2 =\n| footer = W. H. Auden selected Ashbery as the winner of the Yale Series of Younger Poets Competition in 1955. As a result, Yale University Press published Ashbery's first collection, Some Trees, with a foreword by Auden.}}}}\nEstablished in 1919, the Yale Series of Younger Poets Competition is the longest-running poetry prize in the United States. It began as a competition to recognize undergraduate poets at Yale University before expanding to accept any poets under the age of 30 (and later, 40) who had not yet published their first book. Each year, Yale University Press publishes the winner's debut book of poetry.\nThe preliminary round of the contest is judged by a team of editors, mostly graduate students, who pass on their recommendations to an editor selected by the board of Yale University Press. The editor is typically a leading figure in poetry who is not necessarily otherwise associated with Yale. W. H. Auden judged the competition between 1946 and 1958, a run considered to be the best in the competition's history due to the high number of winners who went on to acclaimed and noteworthy careers in poetry. Alongside Ashbery, some of the highly regarded winners selected by Auden include James Wright, Adrienne Rich, W. S. Merwin, and John Hollander.\nAshbery won the 1955 Younger Poets Competition, but only following a complicated and somewhat unfavorable process. Both he and Frank O'Hara, his friend and a fellow Harvard alumnus, were eliminated by the first round judges. However, Auden found himself dissatisfied with all of the twelve manuscripts that he had been given. He asked Ashbery and O'Hara to resubmit their poems directly to him and, a week later, decided he preferred Ashbery's submission. He named Ashbery the winner despite his own personal reservations about the avant-garde style and influence from surrealism in Ashbery's poetry, which he found alienating and often nonsensical. Ashbery's debut poetry collection, Some Trees, was published in 1956 with a foreword by Auden.\nPoems from Some Trees have been subsequently included in two anthologies related to the Younger Poets series; see the section on \"best-of\" anthologies above.\n!\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1955\n| Some Trees\n| Yale Series of Younger Poets Prize\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|}\nGrants and fellowships\nAshbery received several grants and fellowships that provided monetary support for his creative output as a writer.

He frequently visited  during those years and, after his Fulbright expired, continued to live there until 1965.}}\nHoping to live in France, Ashbery applied for the Fulbright Program multiple times starting in 1950. He was rejected five times. However, he was accepted into the program in 1955 after an initial rejection because another applicant decided to withdraw. He lived in Montpellier and translated French poetry. As part of his Fulbright project, he translated works by Jules Supervielle, Paul Éluard, and Francis Ponge, which much later appeared in his Collected French Translations. His Fulbright was extended for a second year, during which he taught American studies in Rennes. According to his own recollection in 2014, his monthly stipend had been about $135 (equivalent to about $ in , adjusted for inflation). After the grant expired, he moved to Paris and lived there until 1965.\nPoets' Foundation\nThe Poets' Foundation—not to be confused with the Chicago-based Poetry Foundation—was an anonymously funded organization in New York. Ashbery received two grants from the Poets' Foundation: one in 1960, the other in 1964. The amounts Ashbery received from the foundation are not publicly known; other poets reportedly received grants ranging from $500 to $1,500 in the early-to-mid 1960s. John Wieners received $1,500 in 1962. Philip Whalen received $500 in 1962 and, according to Whalen, Ron Loewinsohn received $1,000 in 1964.}}\nIngram Merrill Foundation\nAmerican poet James Merrill established the Ingram Merrill Foundation in the 1950s. Merrill was a son of businessman Charles E. Merrill, who co-founded the investment and wealth management company Merrill Lynch. After the deaths of both his father and mother in 1956, Merrill received a substantial inheritance. He used the money to fund his own creative endeavors and to create the foundation, which provided grants to writers and artists until its dissolution in 1996. Though Merrill was a foundation board member, the foundation ostensibly made its grant-making decisions on an independent basis without his influence. He relied on this formal separation from the foundation to preserve normal social relations with other artists; he did not want to appear to be granting favors to friends, or to put others in the awkward position of personally asking him for funding. However, in practice Merrill retained final authority over the foundation's actions. He relied on the advice of colleagues like John Hollander and Irma Brandeis .\nAshbery received grants from the Ingram Merrill Foundation in 1962 and 1972. It is not known how much money Ashbery received from the foundation, but its typical grant sizes ranged from about $4,000 to $6,000. The foundation reportedly awarded a grant of $4,000 to Helen Adam, a Scottish poet, in June 1964. American poet Elizabeth Bishop received $5,000 from the foundation in December 1968.}}\nGuggenheim Fellowships\nGuggenheim Fellowships, disbursed by the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation since 1925, are grants intended \"to help provide Fellows with blocks of time in which they can work with as much creative freedom as possible.\" Individuals are selected for fellowships through an application process. The amount of a grant varies depending on the foundation's budget, the scope of the applicant's creative project, and the extent of other financial resources available to the fellow.\nStarting in 1955, Ashbery applied for a Guggenheim Fellowship eleven times.91)}} He was named a fellow two times—first in 1967, then in 1973. While the amounts of money he received through the program are not publicly known, the program's average grant sizes in those years were $7,430 and $11,252, respectively. He used the proceeds of his first fellowship to travel to Europe in 1968, visiting Pierre Martory in Paris then Switzerland and Italy with his mother. The second fellowship allowed him to delay taking a job teaching at Brooklyn College until 1974 so he could focus on writing poetry in the meantime. His poetry collections The Double Dream of Spring(1970) and Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror(1975) include notes of acknowledgement to the Guggenheim Foundation.\nNational Endowment for the Arts (NEA)\nIn fiscal year 1969, he received a publication award of $500 from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). The award was given in recognition of his poem \"Spring Day\", first published in a 1967 issue of The Paris Review, and resulted in the poem's inclusion in The American Literary Anthology, Volume 2. Vance Bourjaily, Robert Duncan, Albert Guerard, Mark Harris, Philip Roth, Anne Sexton, Roger Shattuck, John Simon, and Louis Simpson.\nIn 1975, he applied for a Composer–Librettist grant from the NEA along with the modernist composer Elliott Carter. Their collaboration resulted in the musical piece Syringa, set to Ashbery's poem of the same name and several texts in Greek. Although Ashbery wrote several original libretti for Carter, the composer was inspired by the previously published \"Syringa\" and chose to use it instead. As such, Ashbery did not ultimately contribute new writing to the composition. Nevertheless, his grant—in the amount of $4,350—was not revoked.\nRockefeller Foundation\nThe Rockefeller Foundation is a large American private foundation. In 1971, it launched a yearly program of writing grants for a \"playwright-in-residence\" program, pairing a writer together with a theater with the goal of staging an original production. Eight or nine playwrights were chosen each year based on nominations taken from theaters and from the panel of judges followed by deliberation of the judges; applications were not accepted. Each playwright would receive $8,500 outright with an additional $500 for relocation expenses, while each designated theater would receive $4,000. There were little to no conditions placed upon receipt of the grant—according to The New York Times, one grant-winning playwright used the money to purchase a Ferrari sports car.\nAlthough best known for poetry, Ashbery was also involved in theater early in his career and wrote several experimental plays, most of which were published together in the 1978 book Three Plays. He had largely abandoned dramatic writing by the time his first poetry collection was published in 1956. In an October 1978 interview, he described an untitled dramatic \"work-in-progress\" of about 100 pages that he had been developing, on and off, for several years. However, his final new play was To the Mill, published in 1960 as part of The Hasty Papers magazine edited by Alfred Leslie. It is not clear what became of the \"work-in-progress\".\nJack Larson, an actor and writer, nominated Ashbery and two others for the Rockefeller Foundation's playwright-in-residence program in 1978. In December 1978, the Rockefeller Foundation announced Ashbery and eight playwrights would receive grants under the program, though he was the only one listed without a paired theater. The New York Times announced the grant awards three months later, but still listed Ashbery only as \"theater to be determined\". It does not seem to be the case that he ultimately worked with a theater under the \"playwright-in-residence\" program, but he did receive the grant.\nMacArthur Fellowship\nIn 1985, the MacArthur Foundation named Ashbery as one of 25 new MacArthur Fellows. Colloquially known as the \"genius\" grant, the fellowship is given to \"outstandingly talented and creative people\" so that they may \"pursue whatever they believe is important and relevant\", without conditions or limitations on how they spend the grant money. At the time, each fellow received between $155,000 and $300,000 over the course of five years, with higher value based on age. Between 1985 and 1990, Ashbery received $272,000, or $54,400 a year. Because of the MacArthur Fellowship, he was able to quit his jobs as a professor at Brooklyn College and as an art critic at Newsweek.\nWallace Stevens fellowship\nThe Wallace Stevens fellowship, named for American poet Wallace Stevens, was a program of the Timothy Dwight College at Yale University. It was established in 1976 by an anonymous donation from a fellow from the college. An annual program, the fellowship invited a prominent poet to come to the college and give readings of their work. The first Wallace Stevens fellow was Richard Eberhart, who was in residence at the college at the time. Ashbery was appointed to the fellowship in 1985.\nHonors for cumulative or lifetime achievement\nThe following awards and honors were bestowed in recognition of Ashbery as an individual, either for lifetime achievement or the cumulative sum of his literary career and oeuvre.\nAcademic honors\nAshbery received several honors from universities and academic institutions.\nHonorary degrees\nAshbery completed his formal education in 1951 with an M.A. at Columbia. He briefly considered going for a PhD, even beginning work on a dissertation about the life of French poet Raymond Roussel, but abandoned the project before completion.\nWhile the M.A. was the highest degree he attained through schooling, he received honorary degrees at the DLitt (Doctor of Letters) level from the following universities and colleges:\n* The University of Rochester (1994)\n* Harvard University (2001)\n* Pace University (2003)\n* Yale University (2008)\n* Middlebury College (2012)}}\nAccademia dei Lincei\nIn 2006, Ashbery was elected a foreign member of the Italian Accademia dei Lincei in Rome. He had previously received its prestigious Antonio Feltrinelli International Prize; see the section on the Feltrinelli Prize below.\nBard College\nBard College is a private liberal arts college in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. Ashbery—who was appointed as the Charles P. Stevenson Jr., Professor of Languages and Literature at Bard in 1990—received several honors from the college:\n*In 1983, Ashbery was named the winner of Bard's Charles Flint Kellogg Award in Arts and Letters. The annual award recognizes a person who has made \"a significant contribution to the American artistic or literary heritage.\"\n*Since 1995, the college has a recurrent reading event called the John Ashbery Poetry Series named in his honor.\n*At the occasion of the poet's 80th birthday in 2007, Ann Lauterbach held a weekend-long celebration at the college and the college's biennial literary journal Conjunctions dedicated a \"special birthday anthology\" issue to him. The issue, edited by Peter Gizzi and Bradford Morrow, featured personal essays from writers responding to Ashbery's poetry and reprinted some of his rare early writings.\nBrandeis University\nThe Creative Arts Awards of Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts recognizes \"active American artists\" with honors in three categories: the Creative Arts Medal, for lifetime achievement; the Creative Arts Citation, for \"mid-career\" achievement; and the Special Award for Notable Achievement in the Creative Arts, for an artist who has made \"singular cultural contributions\".\nIn May 1989, Ashbery received the Creative Arts Medal for Poetry at the 33rd Creative Arts Awards. The ceremony took place at the Guggenheim Museum in New York. The Brandeis Review said he was \"credited with creating the most original and influential poetic mode of our time.\" Other medalists that year were Louise Bourgeois for sculpture, Jonas Mekas for film, Mel Powell for music.\nDeerfield Academy\nIn 1984, Ashbery received the Heritage Award from the Deerfield Academy Alumni Association. He began attending the Massachusetts college-preparatory boarding school in 1943, published poetry in its student newspaper, The Deerfield Scroll, and graduated in 1945. Each year, the Heritage Award recognizes \"a Deerfield alumnus or alumna whose professional and personal achievements represent a special contribution to the betterment of society.\" Other noteworthy recipients have included diplomat Rick Barton, meteorologist Kerry Emanuel, physician Caldwell Esselstyn, architect Hugh Hardy, writer and television producer Budd Schulberg, and executive Alan Hassenfeld.\nHarvard University\nAshbery received several honors from his undergraduate alma mater, Harvard, and from organizations related to the school:\n*In 1979, he was named the Phi Beta Kappa Poet at Harvard and was inducted as a member. Founded as a fraternity in 1776, Phi Beta Kappa (ΦΒΚ) is an academic honor society with chapters throughout the United States. Its Harvard chapter, chartered in 1779, was the longest-running chapter when it merged into a broader Massachusetts chapter in 1995. Chosen annually, the Phi Beta Kappa poet gives a reading during commencement week events; other Phi Beta Kappa poets at Harvard have included W. H. Auden, Robert Frost, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Robert Lowell, and Wallace Stevens. Ashbery later judged the first Phi Beta Kappa poetry competition in 2001, awarding a $10,000 prize and bronze medal to Kenneth Koch from a field of 200 applicants.\n*Ashbery was selected to give the Charles Eliot Norton Lecture for the 1989–90 academic year. Named for Charles Eliot Norton, the annual lecture series on poetry—defined broadly enough to include poetic expressions like music and architecture—is considered one of the most highly prestigious of the hundreds at Harvard. Each of his six lectures surveyed the work of an under-appreciated \"minor\" poet from whom he had taken inspiration: they were John Clare, Thomas Lovell Beddoes, Raymond Roussel, John Wheelwright, Laura Riding, and David Schubert. These lectures were later published by Harvard University Press in the book Other Traditions(2000).\n*The Signet Society is an exclusive literary society at Harvard. Ashbery joined as an undergraduate, completing his initiation by performing an original Henry James parody titled \"Return of the Screw\". Other noteworthy members who pursued poetry include James Agee, Conrad Aiken, T. S. Eliot, and John Updike. The Signet Society Medal for Achievement in the Arts has been awarded on an annual basis since 1937. Ashbery was named a Signet Medalist in 2001. He was subsequently named the honorary poet of the Signet Society Annual Dinner in 2006.\n*In 2009, Ashbery received the Harvard Arts Medal at that year's Arts First festival at the university. According to Harvard Magazine, the award \"celebrates alumni and faculty members whose excellence in the arts has served education or the public good.\" After an introduction by fellow Harvard alum John Lithgow, Ashbery discussed his work with scholar Daniel Chiasson and then received the medal from the university president, Drew Gilpin Faust.\nNew York University\nIn May 2011, the New York University Center for French Civilization and Culture conferred its Medal of Honor to Ashbery.\nPasadena City College\nIn 1985, Ashbery was named the Poet of the Year at Pasadena City College, a public community college in Pasadena, California. Since 1975, the Poet of the Year designation has been made by the college's literary journal Inscape.\nAmbassador Book Award\nIn 2008, Ashbery received an Ambassador Book Award for Lifetime Achievement from the English-Speaking Union of the United States. He was recognized in part for his recently published book Notes from the Air: Selected Later Poems.\nAmerica Award in Literature\nThe America Award in Literature has been presented annually by Douglas Messerli's Los Angeles-based publishing company Green Integer since 1994. Considered an alternative to the Nobel Prize in Literature, it has been decided by a rotating panel that has included Messerli, Will Alexander, Luigi Ballerini, Charles Bernstein, Peter Constantine, Peter Glassgold, Deborah Meadows, Martin Nakell, John O'Brien, Marjorie Perloff, Dennis Phillips, Joe Ross, Jerome Rothenberg, Paul Vangelisti, and Mac Wellman. Ashbery received the award in 2008.\nAmerican Academy of Achievement Golden Plate\nThe American Academy of Achievement presents the Golden Plate to about 25 individuals at its annual International Achievement Summit. Launched in 1961, the award is given in recognition of achievement in one of five categories: the arts, public service, science & exploration, business, and sports. Ashbery received a Golden Plate in 1987. He was the second poet to receive the award, following Theodore Roethke.\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Letters Gold Medal for Poetry\nEvery year since 1909, the American Academy of Arts and Letters has awarded two of its Gold Medals recognizing lifetime achievement, rotating between the following paired categories: \"Belles Lettres and Criticism\" and \"Painting\"; \"Biography\" and \"Music\"; \"Fiction\" and \"Sculpture\"; \"History\" and \"Architecture (including Landscape Architecture)\"; \"Poetry\" and \"Music\"; and \"Drama\" and \"Graphic Art\". Ashbery received the gold medal for Poetry at a ceremony in Harlem on May 21, 1997, before an audience of 700. The other gold medal recipient that year was the composer Gunther Schuller.\nAntonio Feltrinelli International Prize\nThe Feltrinelli Prize is an annual award given by the Italian Accademia dei Lincei in Rome. The award rotates each year to recognize achievement within one of a variety of categories, which include literature, arts, and sciences. In 1992, Ashbery became the first poet to win the Feltrinelli Prize in 15 years. He received a cash prize in Italian lire of ₤200 million, which at the exchange rate of the time was worth about $150,000.\nBest of Brooklyn (\"BoBi\") Award\nSince 2007, the annual Brooklyn Book Festival has presented its Best of Brooklyn (or \"BoBi\") Award to \"an author whose body of work exemplifies or speaks to the spirit of Brooklyn.\" Ashbery received the award in 2010. He also read poetry and spoke on a panel with the first \"BoBi\" winner, Paul Auster.\nFile:Paul Auster John Ashbery BBF 2010 Shankbone.jpg|Ashbery speaking on a panel with previous \"BoBi\" Award winner Paul Auster\nFile:Ashbery (Best of Brooklyn).jpeg|Ashbery accepts the \"BoBi\" Award.

It is awarded by the Yale University Library to a living American poet, or poets, in recognition of either \"the best collection published in that period, or for a body of poetry written over several years.\" Both Ashbery and Fred Chappell received the Bollingen Prize in 1985. Each poet received $2,500. They were chosen by a jury that included Annie Dillard, Richard Howard, and Louis D. Rubin Jr.\nAccording to some recent sources, including the Flow Chart Foundation and the Poetry Foundation website's biography of Ashbery, he received the Bollingen Prize for his collection A Wave. However, The Yale University Library Gazette did not mention A Wave in its announcement and instead cited the two poets \"for their body of work.\" Contemporaneous sources reporting on the Bollingen announcement, such as The New York Times and Poetry magazine, also described it as a cumulative award recognizing his work published to date and did not mention A Wave.\nCommon Wealth Award for Literature\nThe Common Wealth Award of Distinguished Service recognizes accomplished individuals in eight fields: dramatic arts, government, invention, literature, mass communications, public service, science, and sociology. Winners receive a cash prize and a trophy. The awards are funded by the Common Wealth Trust, established by the estate of Ralph Hayes.

During his lifetime, he was a leading contender for the prize among American poets. the scholar Solveig Daugaard claimed he was \"repeatedly mentioned as runner-up candidate for the Nobel\"; and according to his Poetry Foundation biography, he was \"[c]onsidered for many years to be the leading U.S. candidate for the Nobel.\" The satirical newspaper The Onion even ran a Nobel-themed article with Ashbery as its subject, with the headline \"Fucking Pathetic John Ashbery Actually Thinks He Has Shot at Nobel Prize in Literature This Year\". The Guardians Justine Jordan said the article \"pok[ed] fun at every writer's perennial secret fantasy of getting That Call from the Academy.\"}}\nIt is not known whether Ashbery was ever formally nominated for the prize or, if so, how many times he was nominated or how far he may have gotten in the process. Nomination records are kept secret for fifty years, after which time they may become available to the general public. Because he was last eligible for the prize in 2016, having died in 2017, records covering the full span of his eligibility will not be publicly available until at least 2067.\nAt the time of Ashbery's death, no writer had won the Nobel for literary work that is universally, uncontroversially recognized as \"American poetry\".Eliot's status as an \"American poet\" is debatable. Though born in St. Louis, Missouri, he always had deep ties to England because his elite family was the Boston Brahmin branch of the upper-class Eliots of Britain. By the time he won the Nobel, he had been living in England for 30 years and had become a British citizen. David Orr said it \"seems as reasonable to call him an English writer who was born in America as an American writer who lived in England.\" Similarly, Richard Gray wrote that Eliot \"was and was not an American writer precisely because the confluence of cultures required him, he believed, to make a deliberate choice. He was an American by birth and an Englishman by force of will.\"Miłosz and Brodsky both became American citizens while living in exile from Poland and Russia, respectively, and their literary works were intimately tethered to the cultures and languages of their countries of origin. Neither writer identified as primarily American; Miłosz declared \"I am a Lithuanian to whom it was not given to be a Lithuanian,\" while Brodsky said \"I am Jewish—a Russian poet and an English essayist.\"\n*\"Poet\": When American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan won the Nobel in 2016, the committee officially recognized him \"for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.\" The decision to grant the award to Dylan sparked debate about whether his lyrics could rightly be considered \"poetry\" or even \"literature\" at all. Critics also debated whether Dylan deserved or needed the Prize given his wealth, fame, and comparatively enormous audience: his listenership of millions far exceeds the typical readership of a Nobel laureate. In an article about the discussions surrounding Dylan's Nobel win, Orr quipped: \"One would think, after all, poets might be put off by the idea that songwriters can be poet enough to win a prize in literature, when the implied relationship is so clearly a one-way street. (John Ashbery will be waiting a long time for his Grammy.)\"}} Following Ashbery's death, New York Times critic Dwight Garner said the Nobel Committee's failure to recognize Ashbery ranked among its major oversights in American poetry, alongside its omissions of Elizabeth Bishop, Robert Frost, Wallace Stevens, Frank O'Hara, and John Berryman.\nThough he never spoke of it publicly, there is some indication he contemplated winning the Nobel and hoped to achieve it. In a sympathetic remembrance of Ashbery after his death, writer Eileen Myles mentioned that she \"heard that he really wanted a Nobel Prize.\"}}\nFactors that may have affected Ashbery's odds to win the Nobel\nAshbery was the subject of public Nobel speculation as early as 1995, when Swedish publisher  dropped his name to the Associated Press as a candidate under discussion. Other members of the Swedish literati generally predicted a Nobel was due for a poet, a European, or possibly a European poet. Ultimately, Irish poet Seamus Heaney won that year.\n{| class=\"wikitable floatleft sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin: 0.5em 1.4em 1.3em 0; font-size:90%;\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\"| Ashbery's Nobel odds2009–2016\n!

Ladbrokes' odds are regularly cited in the press, as Noble recipients are notoriously difficult to predict given the wide field of potential candidates, who are often obscure to the general public. Per Ladbrokes, Ashbery had his best odds to win in 2010, at . Those odds placed him below E. L. Doctorow (at ), above Philip Roth and Maya Angelou (both at ), and on par with the Polish poet Adam Zagajewski.\nLiterary commentators believed Ashbery's Nobel prospects were boosted by his relative preeminence in his field. It stood to reason that if any poet—especially an American one—were to receive a Nobel in a given year, he would have been among the most probable choices. In 2008, David Orr wrote in The New York Times that, among American poets, only Ashbery and Adrienne Rich enjoyed \"international reputations conceivably large enough to interest Nobel jurors\" at that time. The same year, the Swedish scholar Kerstin Lundberg Hahn commented that it had been a long time since a Nobel had gone to a poet—the last had been Heaney in 1995—and he named Ashbery, Adunis (a Syrian), and Les Murray (an Australian) as probable winners for poetry.\nOn the other hand, Ashbery's chances may have been dampened by his avant-garde style, which diverged from the universalism favored by the Nobel Committee. Ange Mlinko commented that  year that the Nobel committee passes over poet John Ashbery for a socially responsible novelist, it proves that the prize for literature is just an arm of the Peace Prize, rather than–like the Nobels for physics or chemistry–a prize for radical discovery in the field.\" According to Charles North, Ashbery was hindered because, \"unlike most of those who have won the prize,\" he was \"not perceived as engagé\"—that is, he was not perceived to be seriously engaged as a writer with any pressing moral or political causes; nonetheless, North wrote, there was \"no [other] writer whose poems are more engaged with what it means to be human.\" Jeffrey Gray claimed there is a symbolic expectation that a Nobel winner will embody their national literature, and Ashbery was not necessarily an obvious choice to represent American literature as a whole:\n}}\nAshbery was also openly gay, and his sexuality may have influenced Nobel deliberations. Alfred Corn, a gay American poet and friend of Ashbery, noted in an obituary for The Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide that he had won \"every prize you can think of except for the Nobel, which almost never goes to gay writers.\" Eileen Myles, an American writer and lesbian, suggested in Out magazine that Ashbery's heightened aestheticism and open homosexuality made him an improbable fit for the committee's restrained sensibilities:\n[A]nyone who knew his work also knew it was unlikely he could receive the Nobel Prize for Literature since there was no reason to give such a lofty international award to him. And that him definitely has a little gay twist. Have Nobel prizes gone to known gay aesthetes before[?]\"}}\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\nBibliography\n*\n* }}\n*\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n*\n*}}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* }}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* }}\n* }}\n*\n*\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* }}\n* }}\n*\n*\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n*\n*\n* }}\n* |ref=}}\n* |isbn=0-89950-643-7 }}\n*\n*\n* }}\n*\n*\n* |isbn=978-3-11-023007-9 }}\n* |lccn=2002449246 }}\n* }}\n*\n* }}\n*\nAcademic and literary journals\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* or BombMagazine.org as a web page }}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*}}\n*}}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nMagazines, newspapers and websites\n* |access-date=September 23, 2019 }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* |access-date=September 11, 2019 }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* |ref= }}\n* |ref= }}\n* }}\n* |ref= }}\n* |ref= }}\n* }}\n* |ref= }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* |access-date=October 29, 2019 }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n*\n*}}\n*\n*\n* |url-status=live }}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* }}\n* }}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* }}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* |ref= }}\n* |ref= }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* |ref= }}\n* |ref= }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* |ref= }}\n* |ref= }}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*}}\n* }}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* }}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* }}\n*\n*\n* |access-date=September 11, 2019 }}\n*\n*\n*\n* }}\n*"
