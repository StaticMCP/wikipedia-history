Notes\n|-\n|January 2000\n|Lola Shenkoya\n|Body not found\n|Shenkoya, a 27-year-old computing graduate, disappeared from Ealing Broadway on 3 January 2000. Police believe her to have been killed by serial sex offender and suspected serial killer Andrzej Kunowski, who murdered a 12-year-old girl nearby in 1997 and is also the prime suspect in the murder of Elizabeth Chau, who disappeared from almost the exact same location as Shenkoya some months earlier. Kunowski was questioned over both disappearances, but no concrete evidence was found to link either of them to him before he died in prison in 2009.\n|-\n|January 2000\n|Roger Ormsby\n|Manchester\n|Ormsby's body was in the driver's seat of his BMW when it was discovered burning in an alley in Whalley Range on 5 January 2000. The 35-year-old businessman had been shot in the back of his head.\n|-\n|January 2000\n|Gabriel Egharevba\n|Manchester\n|17-year-old Egharevba was shot when he and a friend were being chased by two men on motorcycles whilst riding their bicycles through Longsight on 12 January 2000. Detectives thought it was a case of mistaken identity.\n|-\n|January 2000\n|Martin Lavelle\n|Attacked in Willesden, London, died in hospital in Oxford\n|48-year-old Lavelle, an Irishman living in Willesden, was assaulted close to his bedsit in Meyrick Road at nighttime on 4 January 2000. A friend then saw him lying in that road and took him home, where he was found collapsed two days later by friends who had broken in after he had failed to answer his door.\nFollowing his admission to a nearby hospital, Lavelle's condition deteriorated enough for him to require an intensive care bed, but the apparent unavailability of such beds in London led to him being moved to a hospital in Oxford on 17 January. Severe head injuries were the cause of the robbery victim's death on 22 January.\n|-\n|January 2000\n|Lee King\n|Middlesbrough\n|King, a 32-year-old petty criminal described as a \"likable rogue\", was shot dead in Park End on 28 January 2000. A love rival was acquitted of his murder in February 2001. The suspect had also been charged with the murder of Kevin Richardson in the same area of Middlesbrough in 1993, but the charge over that death was dismissed at the magistrates' court level owing to lack of evidence.\n|-\n|February 2000\n|Bill Malcolm\n|Manor Park, London\n|Malcolm, a 46-year-old with convictions for sexual offences against children, was shot in the head on the doorstep of his Manor Park flat in a suspected case of vigilantism on 17 February 2000.\n|-\n|March 2000\n|Brian Harris\n|Brixton, London\n|25-year-old Harris was shot dead at his home in Brixton on 11 March 2000. The case was probed by Operation Trident, a Metropolitan Police unit dealing with black-on-black crime.\n|-\n|March 2000\n|Craig Mirfield\n|Leeds\n|Mirfield, a 34-year-old car dealer, was shot in his car in Gipton, Leeds, on 15 March 2000 while trying to drive away from a gunman. A man was prosecuted for Mirfield's murder, but his trial ended early due to reservations about the reliability of the two main witnesses.\n|-\n|March 2000\n|Terry Gibson\n|Barnet, London\n|53-year-old Gibson, a landscape gardener with business interests, was shot dead outside his home in Moxon Street, Barnet, on 16 March 2000. Police believed the crime to have been a contract killing.\n|-\n|April 2000\n|David Dann\n|Attacked in Blackheath, London, died in hospital\n|24-year-old Dann was shot from behind just after midnight on 4 April 2000. He and a friend he was with then separated and the offender pursued Dann, who was struck by a total of three bullets before being pronounced dead in hospital at 12:46 a.m.\n|-\n|April 2000\n|Sarah Benford\n|Body not found\n|14-year-old Benford vanished in April 2000 and although her body has never been found, her disappearance is being treated as a murder. Benford was described by police as a \"troubled teenager\"; she was in care and ran away from Welford House children's home in Welford Road, Northampton on 4 April. She visited her mother in Kettering on 6 April and there were various other sightings of her in Kettering that day. In 2003, a number of people were arrested and properties were searched, but then the investigation stalled. In 2016, police searched woods near Warkton in Northamptonshire – an area known to have been used by acquaintances of Benford for storing stolen goods and other items.\n|-\n|May 2000\n|Nicola Ray\n|Body not found\n|Ray has not been seen since she parted company with a friend in Basildon, Essex, in the early hours of 2 May 2000 following a night out. She was 29 or 30 years old at the time. Ray's fiancé was arrested twice on suspicion of her murder, but neither arrest led to any charges.\n|-\n|May 2000\n|Frank McPhee\n|Maryhill, Glasgow\n|McPhee, a 51-year-old gangster himself twice acquitted of murder, was shot by a sniper in a block of flats opposite his own as he returned home on 10 May 2000.\n|-\n|May 2000\n|Cheryll Grover\n|Newbury, Berkshire\n|Grover, 21, was last seen alive by a visitor to her home on Audley Close, Turnpike, Newbury, at 10:30 p.m. on Friday 12 May 2000. She spoke to a friend on the telephone at 2:35 a.m. on Saturday 13 May, but efforts made by her estranged husband to contact her later that same day came to nothing. Concerned for Grover's welfare, he and his mother visited Grover's home at 3:30 p.m. and he climbed the drainpipe to reach the first floor bedroom window. Inside, Grover was found dead in her bedroom, having been strangled with a dressing gown cord. Police suspected that she had been selling drugs from her home and an appeal led to a number of people coming forward. A 32-year-old man was arrested but released without charge.\nAlthough Grover's death was investigated as a murder, the inquest returned an open verdict. In May 2006, Thames Valley Police announced that her death was being reviewed by a cold case team.\n|-\n|May 2000\n|Clifton Bryan and Dennis Wilson\n|Leeds\n|The bodies of 29-year-old Bryan and 32-year-old Wilson were found in a car in Leeds on 15 May 2000. Scientific evidence revealed that they had been shot dead in a house in Manchester before being taken out of the city. In 2001 a man was cleared of the killings, which were thought to have been gang-related.\n|-\n|June 2000\n|Jaap Bornkamp\n|Attacked in New Cross, London, died in hospital\n|52-year-old Bornkamp, a Dutchman who lived in the Norbury area of south London and worked as a florist, was stabbed in an attack believed to have been homophobic while walking along New Cross Road with a male companion in the early hours of 4 June 2000.\n|-\n|June 2000\n|Shkelquim Brakka\n|King's Lynn, Norfolk\n|Brakka died on 4 June 2000 from a stab wound received outside a nightclub. A person charged with the 26-year-old Kosovan's murder was cleared at trial.\n|-\n|June 2000\n|Kellie Pratt\n|Body not found\n|Pratt became a sex worker to help pay for a drug habit after moving to Great Yarmouth from her home city of Newcastle in 1998. She was last seen on the phone standing outside a pub in the red-light district of Norwich on 11 June 2000, and soon afterwards the 28-year-old told an associate who had phoned her that she was with a client whose identity has not been established. Pratt's disappearance has led to a police murder investigation despite the fact that her body has not been discovered. A link has been suggested to serial East Anglia prostitute killer Steve Wright.\n|-\n|June 2000\n|Karen Chandler\n|Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire\n|A cause of death could not be established for 40-year-old Chandler because her car was set alight with her body inside. Police charged a man in his 60s with her murder. At the trial, the prosecution alleged that he killed Chandler because he was infatuated with her but saw no chance of a relationship developing. The man acknowledged that he was riding his bicycle on Salisbury Plain on the day she disappeared (20 June 2000) but denied any involvement in her death. With the evidence against him being entirely circumstantial, the jury found him not guilty.\n|-\n|June 2000\n|Menelik Robinson\n|Clapton, London\n|Robinson was driving along Upper Clapton Road on 25 June 2000 when two motorcycles forced him to stop. A passenger then dismounted and shot the 20-year-old several times.\n|-\n|July 2000\n|Mark Corley\n|Near Bolam, County Durham\n|Corley, a 23-year-old from Grantham in Lincolnshire, disappeared on 7 July 2000, and his remains were discovered in a rural area of County Durham in December. He had been shot in the head. Five men were due to go on trial in early 2002, but a judge called off the trial after finding that police had unlawfully bugged conversations between those men and their solicitors.\n|-\n|July 2000\n|Iwona Kaminska\n|Body not found\n|Kaminska, a 20-year-old Polish woman, disappeared after leaving her workplace in Hammersmith, London, on 13 July 2000, and investigators came to believe she had been murdered. Two other young women had disappeared from the street in Ealing four miles away over the previous 15 months, and Polish serial sex offender and suspected serial killer Andrzej Kunowski, who died in 2009 and, in 1997, had murdered a 12-year-old girl near where Kaminska was last seen, was to become the prime suspect in those cases.\n|-\n|July 2000\n|Beatrice Wilson\n|Poole, Dorset\n|Wilson, 74, was knifed to death in her sheltered accommodation on 21 July 2000. A boy who was 15 at the time of the killing was charged with her murder. The prosecution claimed at the subsequent trial that he killed Wilson while burgling her flat and later confessed to a friend. The jury acquitted him.\n|-\n|August 2000\n|Greg Watson\n|Attacked in North Kensington, London, died in hospital\n|21-year-old Watson was knifed in Kensal Road on 28 August 2000 when his female cousin was accosted and he tried to defuse the situation. He died soon after the nighttime stabbing, which Crimewatch later showed low-quality CCTV footage of and which occurred at the time of the Notting Hill Carnival.\n|-\n|August 2000\n|Ronald Fuller\n|Attacked in Grays, died in hospital in Basildon (both in Essex)\n|30-year-old Fuller was shot twice in the head and twice in the chest outside his bungalow on 29 August 2000 by a man who left the scene on a motor scooter.\n|-\n|August 2000\n|Abdul Bhatti\n|Attacked in Notting Hill, London, died in hospital\n|28-year-old Bhatti was punched and kicked at the Notting Hill Carnival at around 7:30 p.m. on 28 August 2000 after intervening when a friend was being assaulted by a mob, and died on the evening of 29 August. Nine men were jailed for taking part in the violence that culminated in the fatal attack, but no one has been convicted of Bhatti's murder.\n|-\n|September 2000\n|Susan Kelly\n|Liverpool\n|38-year-old Kelly was a sex worker in Liverpool when she was murdered on the night of 3–4 September 2000. Her body was found in an alley off Blessington Road, Anfield, and she had suffered a number of violent injuries, including a cut throat, six broken ribs and a broken nose. A man was cleared of Kelly's murder in 2003 and others have since been arrested and released.\n|-\n|September 2000\n|Clifford Clarke\n|Uppingham, Rutland\n|The body of the former plumber and hospital porter was discovered in his flat by his brother on 10 September 2000. He had been stabbed in the chest and neck, and it was noted at the inquest that his death could have occurred between two and four days prior to his body being found. Fifteen years after the 56-year-old's murder, two men were arrested in connection with it, but to date no one has been charged with the crime.\n|-\n|September 2000\n|Thomas Ramsey\n|Manchester\n|16-year-old Ramsey was shot twice – once in the head, once in the neck – in a park in Levenshulme, Manchester, on 19 September 2000. His crime boss was acquitted of his murder but convicted of the murder of a man from another gang. Ramsey had been acquitted himself of the October 1999 murder of Judah Dewar – a murder linked to Ramsey due to the discovery of one of his fingerprints at the scene.\n|-\n|September 2000\n|Vicky Glass\n|Danby, North Yorkshire\n|21-year-old Glass went missing from Middlesbrough town centre on 24 September 2000. Her body was found 20 miles away in a stream on the North York Moors approximately six weeks later. Glass was a sex worker at the time of her death. In 2018, a specialist police team was set up to revisit the murders of Glass, Donna Keogh and Rachel Wilson. A Home Office review of all three cases said: \"It is generally accepted that initial enquiries and investigations were inadequate.\" Cleveland Police believe there could be a link to serial prostitute killer Steve Wright, whose known victims were all found in streams or near water. In September 2021, police announced a re-investigation by a historical crimes unit into Glass's murder. This announcement came two months after Wright's arrest for another historical murder: that of Victoria Hall in 1999.\n|-\n|October 2000\n|Alan Decabral\n|Ashford, Kent\n|40-year-old Decabral was shot dead on 5 October as he sat in the passenger seat of a car in a busy car park. It happened six months after he gave evidence that helped convict Kenneth Noye of a fatal road-rage attack, and the idea that the gunman was acting on Noye's orders was considered. However, it has also been noted by detectives investigating the case that the shooting could have been carried out because of a disagreement with an associate in the criminal world.\n|-\n|October 2000\n|Raymond Isaacs\n|Attacked in Hounslow, London, died in hospital\n|Isaacs, 21, was set upon by about 10 people after leaving a Hounslow café on 16 October 2000. He was punched, kicked, stabbed in the leg, and fatally stabbed in the heart. Some of those people were found guilty of offences relating to the incident, but nobody has been found guilty of Isaacs's killing.\n|-\n|October 2000\n|Clay Benjamin\n|Liverpool\n|24-year-old Benjamin was stabbed in the heart while at a blues party in Toxteth on 21 October 2000. A man in his 30s was cleared of his murder.\n|-\n|October/November 2000\n|Manokumar Kumar\n|Edmonton, London\n|31-year-old Kumar's arm was almost severed in a fatal axe attack at his home on North Road, Edmonton, at some point between 29 October and 1 November 2000. Described as a gangster, he and a man who was to be charged with his murder had been using stolen credit cards to buy things at petrol stations. When that man was on trial, the prosecution advanced the theory that the attack had been committed because the two had fallen out over their fraudulent activities, but the trial was halted and the man had the charges against him dropped.\n|-\n|November 2000\n|Kenneth Beagle\n|Romford, London\n|55-year-old Beagle was from Billericay in Essex and had convictions for drug dealing and kidnapping. He was shot in the head at point-blank range at about 10:05 p.m. on 1 November 2000 while paying for a parking ticket in the car park of a hospital in Romford, and was thought to have gone there after taking a telephone call made solely for the purpose of luring him to the spot to kill him.\n|-\n|November 2000\n|Wade Hewitt\n|Attacked in Barking, London, died in hospital\n|26-year-old Hewitt was stabbed in the abdomen when two youths approached him on the upper deck of a bus travelling through Barking in the early hours of 3 November 2000. The youths then alighted and ran off, and Hewitt died the following day.\n|-\n|November 2000\n|Garfield Nandram\n|Attacked in Tottenham, London, died in hospital\n|27-year-old Nandram, a hairdresser from Stamford Hill, was shot once in the face in Croydon House just before 10 p.m. on 5 November 2000.\n|-\n|November 2000\n|Steve Jindu\n|Greenford, London\n|25-year-old Jindu, a warehouse driver, was found stabbed to death on Horsenden Hill on 14 November 2000. He had last been seen three days previously, when he visited a wine bar in Ealing by himself and went outside to use his mobile phone several times whilst at the establishment.\n|-\n|November 2000\n|Vincent Clay\n|Salford, Greater Manchester\n|Two men shot 27-year-old Clay while he was talking to his girlfriend in Amersham Street, Salford, on 14 November 2000. He had been charged with leading a prison riot and acquitted in 1999 of an attempted murder with a samurai sword. A man was put on trial for Clay's murder, it being claimed that he had taken part in the crime in revenge for Clay stealing his car, but the court was informed on the second day of the hearing that the prosecution would not be offering any more evidence.\n|-\n|December 2000\n|Zoe Parker\n|Chelsea Harbour, River Thames, London\n|24-year-old Parker was last seen with two men in Hounslow, west London, on 6 December 2000. She had learning difficulties and no fixed address, staying with friends and at hostels in various places such as London, Colchester and Bournemouth. Parker was known to engage in sex work. Shortly before her death she changed her name to Cathy Dennis.\nThe upper part of Parker's body was discovered in the River Thames on 17 December; her body had been sawn in half before being dumped in the river, and it is not known what happened to the lower half. Police suspect she could have been a victim of Anthony Hardy (the \"Camden Ripper\"), who dismembered his known victims after killing them in a nearby area between January and December 2002.\n|-\n|December 2000\n|Anthony Rose-Windon\n|Clapton, London\n|25-year-old Rose-Windon was shot after leaving a nightclub on Lower Clapton Road, Clapton, on 16 December 2000, and died after crawling to neighbouring Kenninghall Road.\n|-\n|December 2000\n|Douglas McPherson\n|Attacked in Hackney, London, died in hospital\n|42-year-old McPherson died four days after a Boxing Day attack in which he was battered with a baseball bat in the London Tavern when four men in balaclavas entered the Hackney pub. A man who was evicted from there earlier that day for hogging the punch was arraigned on a murder charge for allegedly being one of the assailant's accomplices. Only one witness could place him at the crime scene, however, and his mother – a judo expert – testified that she was holding him down at home at the time of the beating to prevent him from going back out to cause further trouble. The defendant was cleared and claimed that his missing half-brother was involved in the killing.\n|-\n|January 2001\n|Andrew Williams\n|Peckham, London\n|On 29 January 2001, 30-year-old Williams was killed in Peckham and a friend was seriously injured there in an early hours street shooting preceded by an altercation with a group of other men. The victims had just left a nightclub in the vicinity when the trouble began.\n|-\n|February 2001\n|Akbal Brar\n|Attacked in Hayes, London, died in hospital\n|On 3 February 2001, 21-year-old Brar was in his parked car with a male friend in the passenger seat when a man appeared suddenly on foot and shot him after the passenger had started talking to another unknown man. No motive behind the incident was established.\n|-\n|February 2001\n|Peter Beaumont-Gowling\n|Newcastle\n|Beaumont-Gowling had not long been out of prison for money laundering when he was shot dead on Valentine's Day on the doorstep of his flat in Jesmond. Two suspects caught on CCTV were never identified. A theory developed that the 52-year-old had been killed for refusing to compensate people for money not received by them as a consequence of over £500,000 in drug money being seized at the time of his arrest.\n|-\n|March 2001\n|Ian Dowling\n|Grantham, Lincolnshire\n|39-year-old Dowling, a road maintenance worker, was shot in the heart and lungs on the doorstep of his home in Grantham on 15 March 2001. In 2003, his lover's husband was imprisoned for conspiracy to murder after standing accused of recruiting contract killers, but in 2005, judges at the Appeal Court deemed his conviction unsafe and quashed it because police had bugged conversations between him and his solicitor.\n|-\n|March 2001\n|David Williamson\n|Attacked in North Yorkshire, died in hospital in Leeds\n|On 26 March 2001, 58-year-old Williamson was found unconscious with a fractured skull a few hundred yards from his home in Sutton-on-the-Forest after he was struck from behind with a blunt instrument following a visit to a pub at nearby Huby. Although a judge deemed a man's murder confession inadmissible, a later threat by that man to kill a garage attendant resulted in him being sent to Rampton Secure Hospital for an indefinite period in 2005.\n|-\n|March 2001\n|Stuart Lubbock\n|Roydon, Essex\n|Lubbock, 31, died during a party at the home of entertainer Michael Barrymore on 31 March 2001. Initially his death was treated as an accidental drowning, but an inquest found he had suffered injuries consistent with sexual assault. In a documentary, Barrymore: The Body in the Pool, shown on Channel 4 on 6 February 2020, Detective Chief Inspector Stephen Jennings of Essex Police stated that mistakes had been made in the original investigation and that he believed Lubbock had been raped and murdered.\n|-\n|April 2001\n|Rebecca Hall\n|Bradford, West Yorkshire\n|19-year-old Hall, a sex worker with a four-month-old son, went missing from her home in Little Horton, Bradford, on 13 April 2001. Her body was found in Thornton Street on 26 April; she had suffered severe head injuries. In January 2019, police arrested a 37-year-old woman and then released her under investigation. Hall's murder has also been linked to Bradford serial killer Stephen Griffiths, who lived  from where she was found dead. He was interviewed by police about her murder in 2010 but refused to answer any of their questions.\n|-\n|April 2001\n|Corey Wright and Wayne Henry\n|Clapton, London\n|20-year-old Wright was a passenger in 19-year-old Henry's car when shots were fired at the vehicle as it was being driven away from the Chimes nightclub in Clapton on Saturday 21 April 2001, killing both of them. Wright had been convicted along with five other youths of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm against Kingsley Iyasara, a 16-year-old boy beaten and fatally shot in the Finsbury Park district of London in 1997.\n|-\n|May 2001\n|Don Banfield\n|Body not found\n|63-year-old Banfield went missing from his home in the northwest London suburb of Harrow on 11 May 2001. In April 2012 his wife and daughter, having earlier pleaded guilty to forgery, conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, were convicted of his murder after being accused of lying about seeing him in 2008 and being found to have gained financially from his disappearance. However, they were released on appeal in July 2013 – even though a lawyer representing the mother at that hearing acknowledged that the likelihood was that Banfield was murdered by one or other of the women – as they were convicted under joint enterprise and the appeal judges ruled that there was insufficient evidence to prove that they acted together to kill him.\n|-\n|May 2001\n|Andre Jan Aylward\n|London\n|27-year-old Aylward was driving his black E28 5 Series BMW along Valleyfield Road in Streatham at around 2:10 a.m. on 12 May 2001 when six bullets were fired at it from a handgun. After the shooting, he lost control of the car and crashed. He had been hit twice in the head and neck and was taken to King's College Hospital, where he died at around 4:00 a.m.\nA grey 7 Series BMW had been seen next to Aylward's vehicle a few minutes before he was shot and the police said that they were seeking to identify it. It was thought that the attack might have been a case of road rage or mistaken identity. The police also said that they had found nothing in Aylward's background to suggest that he had been involved in any criminal activity. The murder was featured on Crimewatch in July 2001.\n|-\n|May 2001\n|Stephen Lawlor\n|Liverpool\n|34-year-old Stephen Lawlor was shot dead close to his Netherley residence as he left a party on 19 May 2001. Five months later his brother Tony Lawlor was shot dead in this area of Liverpool too. Peter Clarke was convicted of Stephen's murder in December 2001 but found not guilty after being retried at Manchester Crown Court.\n|-\n|May 2001\n|Richard Rayner\n|Bow, London\n|Rayner, a 43-year-old plumber from Millwall in east London, was shot at the River Bank Cafe in Bow on 25 May 2001. A man who initially walked away from the scene then ran towards the A12 and possibly got onto a motorcycle.\n|-\n|26 May 2001\n|Keith Rogers\n|Died in hospital in Harlow in Essex from the effects of a fire in Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire\n|40-year-old Rogers managed to escape the fire at his first-floor flat by jumping from a window but died in hospital four weeks later from organ failure caused by smoke inhalation. The fire had been started in the early hours of 29 April by igniting petrol that had been poured through the flat's letterbox.\n|-\n|May 2001\n|Hasan Mamali and Sami Mustafa\n|Islington, London\n|23-year-old Mamali was shot in the back of a car and 26-year-old Mustafa was shot after getting out of it in a bid to escape on 27 May 2001. Police are yet to trace the driver or the front seat passenger, both of whom abandoned the vehicle a short distance away with Mamali still in the back. Mamali and Mustafa were Turkish Cypriots who investigators thought might have been hoping to secure a drug deal.\n|-\n|June 2001\n|Christopher Hewitt\n|Bristol\n|18-year-old Hewitt, a Jamaican who had recently arrived in Britain, was stabbed outside a pub on All Hallows Road, Easton, Bristol, on 10 June 2001 in an incident thought to have involved up to several assailants. Many people witnessed the incident but did not come forward.\n|-\n|June 2001\n|Jody Burns\n|Attacked in Runcorn, Cheshire, died at Whiston Hospital\n|27-year-old Burns sustained a fatal head injury during a disturbance in Runcorn town centre in the early hours of 15 June 2001. The disturbance involved up to 60 people and he was said to have been trying to act as peacemaker. Police charged five men with violent disorder relating to the brawl, but nobody has been charged with Burns's murder.\n|-\n|July 2001\n|Mithat Lleshi\n|Northampton\n|23-year-old Albanian Lleshi and a 28-year-old friend from the same country were set upon by a group of six men and stabbed outside the Grosvenor Centre on 7 July 2001. The older victim survived his injuries. It was believed that the group was made up of fellow Albanians and in 2005 three men were arrested in Albania in connection with the incident, but a Northamptonshire Telegraph article from 2017 has Lleshi's murder as one of the county's still-unsolved crimes.\n|-\n|July 2001\n|Oguzhin Ozdemir\n|South Tottenham, London\n|Ozdemir was kidnapped before being found shot dead next to the River Lea on 14 July 2001. His phone had been used earlier that day to warn friends of his that the 26-year-old, a small-time drug dealer who owed money, would be killed if the people holding him hostage did not receive money or goods. Three men involved in the kidnap were handed sentences of between 10 and 14 years in 2005, but none of the sentences was for murder because it had not been determined who had shot Ozdemir.\n|-\n|July 2001\n|Daniel Dale\n|Manchester\n|18-year-old Dale was killed and another youth hit in the hand when shots were fired at their group as they chatted in the street in Miles Platting on the evening of 25 July 2001. A man was found guilty of murder in April 2002, but advances in forensic science led to the quashing of his conviction in 2014.\n|-\n|July 2001\n|Richie Clayton\n|Liverpool\n|30-year-old Clayton, a father-of-two, was shot on Belgrave Road, Aigburth, just before 8:00 p.m. on 25 July 2001.

The car from which the shots were fired – a Ford Mondeo found burnt out in Redbrook Street, Anfield, sometime later – then did a U-turn and he was shot from it again before dying on 13 September. Because the killing followed his brother Peter Clarke being charged with the May 2001 murder of Stephen Lawlor, a revenge attack for the earlier crime was suspected.\n|-\n|September 2001\n|\"Adam\"\n|River Thames, London\n|Unknown boy; also known as the \"Torso in the Thames\" case.\n|-\n|October 2001\n|John Hall and David McIntosh\n|Larkhall, South Lanarkshire\n|The bodies of Hall, 45, and McIntosh, 33, were found at a former scrapyard on 3 October 2001.

Other injuries included bruising and five broken ribs. Several men were charged, one of whom – a man said to have driven a Suzuki Swift away from the scene – agreed ahead of trial to give evidence against the others and plead guilty to conspiracy to assault. In 2004, four of them were convicted of murder and three of conspiracy to assault, but in 2007, their convictions were quashed when the putative Suzuki Swift driver, who disappeared before the 2004 trial and claimed later that threats against him and his family were the reason, was found to lack credibility. At a 2008 retrial, two were convicted of murder and two of manslaughter, but fresh witness evidence in 2011 caused these convictions to be quashed as well. Balasingham was alleged to have insulted an uncle of two of the defendants (who were brothers), and bad feeling stemming from the insult was advanced as a motive for killing him.\n|-\n|16 November 2001\n|Brian Perry\n|Bermondsey, London\n|63-year-old Perry, a taxi firm boss who had helped to launder money from the 1983 Brink's-Mat robbery, died after being hit by three bullets outside his business in Bermondsey at around 1:00 p.m. Two men were charged over his murder and acquitted at their 2006 trial.\n|-\n|16 November 2001\n|Raymond Scott\n|Body not found\n|47-year-old Scott, a self-employed odd-job man, disappeared in suspicious circumstances.

On 28 April 2002, one of Scott's brothers received a \"menacing\" phone call from South Harrow tube station that a detective believed may be significant to the investigation. Footage of the caller at South Harrow station featured on Crimewatch in April 2014.

The culprit entered the shop at around 9:10 p.m. and Pandya took up a piece of wood in an apparent act of self-defence before the shot that killed him was fired.

The driver of the vehicle in which Barnes died was thought to have been the intended target.\n|-\n|March 2002\n|Exmoor Body in the Bag\n|Winsford Hill, Winsford, Somerset\n|The man's badly decomposed corpse was found wrapped in bin bags, a single green bed sheet and a single duvet on 13 March 2002. Also present were a white pillowcase and a stereo wire, which a detective said the victim might have been tied up with. He is thought to have died two to three years before being found, and it is not clear if the body was brought into the UK from overseas. Clay and computer-generated reconstructions of the man's head were shown on Crimewatch in May 2002 in the hope that someone would recognise him, but without success. He was 26 to 36 years old and possibly of Turkish or Indian origin, and a gold chain he was wearing when discovered had a pendant with a verse from the Koran inscribed across it. A funeral for the mystery victim was arranged in 2006.\n|-\n|March 2002\n|Evan Jones\n|Bristol\n|46-year-old Jones, a father-of-two, was punched, kicked and attacked with a chain in busy Stokes Croft – a street in Bristol – at about 11:00 p.m. on 13 March 2002.

Her fully clothed body was found three days later on Podmore Lane at Scarning. A man was arrested in April 2003 because DNA testing had revealed that his samples matched ones taken from Bettles after she had been strangled to death, but although he admitted having picked her up for sex two days before she disappeared, he was later released due to insufficient evidence. In 2012 David Wilson, a criminologist, suggested that serial prostitute killer Steve Wright was likely to have been the culprit, but police said they had found no evidence to link Wright to the crime.\n|-\n|April 2002\n|Aeon Shirley\n|Manchester\n|A member of a rival gang shot 18-year-old Shirley four times on 11 April 2002, piercing his heart with one of the bullets.

Because the assailant appeared not to have gained access using force, detectives believed that it was someone the victim knew. A suspect was arrested but died in a road traffic collision before the evidence was sufficient to charge him.\n|-\n|23 May 2002\n|Zennen Blackburn\n|Manchester\n|A man got out of a car and shot 27-year-old Blackburn dead in Moston late in the afternoon.

According to two friends, he told them who the shooter was before dying, and though one of them would not reveal that person's identity to detectives, the other gave the police a name. The alleged shooter was acquitted because Cope's friends refused to testify and two doctors independently concluded that the nature of his injuries made it highly unlikely that Cope would have been able to communicate by speech seven minutes after sustaining them, as claimed by one of his friends. The acquitted man was himself murdered in 2006.\n|-\n|August 2002\n|Monica Flaherty\n|Bradford, West Yorkshire\n|62-year-old Flaherty, a grandmother who had discovered her murdered daughter's body in 1990, was stabbed in the chest during a street brawl on 3 August 2002 and managed to make her way to her home in Manningham's Priestman Street before dying there.

The disclosure failures concerned information relating to the key prosecution witness.\n|-\n|October 2002\n|Julie Dorsett\n|Walthamstow, London\n|Dorsett, a 33-year-old sex worker, vanished in early October 2002, and her skull and upper body were discovered buried in an allotment in 2008.

The assailant entered the pub, walked up to him and stabbed him a number of times before walking out of the building. Lack of evidence against a man arraigned for murder led to the collapse of his trial the day after it began.\n|-\n|March 2003\n|Andrew Jones\n|Liverpool\n|On 9 March 2003, 18-year-old Jones was punched to the ground in Hanover Street in Liverpool when he encountered a group of people there at night after becoming separated from friends.

Four men charged over his death were accused at their trial of targeting him because of his support for the secretary of Birmingham's main mosque, who was suspected of impregnating the wife of its imam. The two accused of Ali's murder were both found not guilty of that charge, although one of them was, along with the two other defendants, convicted of assaulting and unlawfully imprisoning him.

His two sons said they discovered his body in the property on 11 April 2003 – nothing was missing – and the following year, one of them was tried for his murder but not found guilty. Because there were claims that Colby told people he was now wealthier thanks to money left to him in his aunt's will, an early line of inquiry pursued the theory that the murder was a result of a failed burglary.\n|-\n|May 2003\n|Viola Mead\n|Attacked in Wendover, died in hospital in Aylesbury (both in Buckinghamshire)\n|Mead, 85, of Dobbins Lane in Wendover, was attacked in her home by two men in late April 2003.

Neil McGarthland)\n|Body not found\n|32-year-old Nortrop left his home in Brixham, Devon, on 10 June 2003 to visit a friend in Greenwich or Dartford.

She had given birth to a baby 11 weeks earlier but had recently told the father that she wanted to end their relationship and had started seeing another man. The father was with Putt at her home on the day but claimed she went out to buy cigarettes and never returned, leaving him to care for their child. An inquest in January 2019 noted that police had found a T-shirt with two tiny drops of her blood on it in her loft, and concluded that she had died at the home or nearby on 1 September 2003. The father has been interviewed by police a number of times, but there has never been sufficient evidence to charge anyone.\n|-\n|September 2003\n|Shumin Hussain\n|St Albans, Hertfordshire\n|Hussain, 29, fell to his death from a window of a ninth-floor flat on 7 September 2003 during a fracas in which a number of people were involved.\n|-\n|September 2003\n|Stephen Henry\n|Bristol\n|32-year-old Henry was shot dead in an apparent contract killing during the early hours of 14 September 2003 as he was about to get into his car after leaving a nightclub.

Brodie, who was 19 and is believed to have been the one who pulled the trigger, disappeared soon afterwards, and it is thought that his criminal associates killed him because the robbery had not gone as planned. Brodie had an accomplice when he was in the shop, and in 2005 that man went to prison for Bates's murder, as well as for conspiracy to rob, possession of a firearm with intent to use it and beating her husband with a crowbar.\nIn February 2013, another man who had been jailed for conspiring to rob the shop was charged with Brodie's murder, but failure to gather enough evidence against him led to the charge being dropped in late April of that year.\nPolice made unsuccessful searches for Brodie's remains at a farm and in a canal in Lincolnshire.\n|-\n|October 2003\n|Michael Jones\n|Bermondsey, London\n|53-year-old Jones received 13 gunshot wounds in the early hours of 16 October 2003 at Bromleigh House, Abbey Street, Bermondsey – apparently after answering the door to his home there.

He died that afternoon at Hull Royal Infirmary, the cause of death being a blow to the head. Stock had been out drinking on the night of the attack. His girlfriend and two men were arrested for his murder but later released due to lack of evidence. The case is still open in hope that new information may one day come to light.\n|-\n|November 2003\n|Graham and Carol Fisher\n|Near Wadebridge, Cornwall\n|60-year-old Graham Fisher and his 53-year-old wife Carol were bludgeoned and shot – apparently during a failed burglary – at their bungalow near Wadebridge on 5 November 2003.

His body was found in a barrel in the canal at Clapton later that month. The drug dealer who dumped it there was jailed for four years for attempting to pervert the course of justice, and it was accepted that he played no part in the murder itself. He claimed to have discovered the victim's body in his flat and to have got rid of it because the thought of a police investigation concerned him.\n|-\n|November 2003\n|Sandra Gant\n|Body not found\n|Mother-of-four Gant was last seen leaving an address in Hayes Road, Clacton, Essex, on 15 November 2003. Although she has not been found, Essex Police believe the 48-year-old was murdered.

The petrol was then ignited, and the resulting blaze at the property in the Derby suburb of Mackworth killed Broughton but not his brother. Two youths went on trial in 2004 and were acquitted.\n|-\n|December 2003\n|Evelyn Jackson\n|Manchester\n|97-year-old Jackson was punched and kicked at her flat in the Longsight area of Manchester on 28 November 2003, and her Christmas savings of £1,000 were stolen.

The friends claimed that they and Barrington were first set upon by another group of youths after leaving the party to get some tobacco from his home, and that they took a rake, a copper pipe and a baseball bat from there too in case they needed them to defend themselves whilst heading back. The death of 17-year-old Barrington sparked a murder inquiry, but the police later decided that because he was carrying the rake when assaulted, the inquiry would have to be dropped. His inquest, however, found that he was unlawfully killed nonetheless.\n|-\n|January 2004\n|Danny McDonald\n|Liverpool\n|20-year-old McDonald, a key member of a gang known as the Crocky Crew or the Crocky Young Guns, was in a pub in West Derby on New Year's Day when a masked man walked over to him and shot him and a 19-year-old friend, who survived.

Gordon was from south London; he had been stabbed and his blood was found in a disused restaurant in Brixton.

It was claimed at the trial of three gang members accused of plotting to murder him that they did so because of his refusal to convert to Islam, but the trial came to a premature end when a prosecutor revealed that new evidence meant there was no longer a realistic prospect of any convictions for conspiracy to murder.\n|-\n|June 2004\n|Nicholas Davies\n|Clapham, London\n|A single bullet had penetrated 25-year-old Davies's lungs and heart when he was found lifeless in an alley off Landor Road on 12 June 2004.

The judge voiced concerns over the disclosure process, too.\n|-\n|January 2005\n|Junior Edwards\n|Archway, London\n|30-year-old Edwards died at Whittington Hospital in Archway on the evening of 18 January 2005 about an hour after being found injured in nearby Spears Road following a fight with two men described as being in the 20–30 age bracket.

The attack was said to have been carried out because he was rumoured to have been responsible for the non-fatal shooting of a man the previous month. A man was sentenced to a minimum of 25 years in prison in September 2007 for being complicit in the fatal July 2006 shooting of a suspect in Stanislas's murder.\n|-\n|March 2005\n|Orville Davidson\n|New Cross, London\n|Purley resident Davidson, 25, was found in Knoyle Street, New Cross, on 27 March 2005 (Easter Sunday) after being shot through the heart.

The property was on King Street, Higher Broughton, Salford, and the victims were in an upstairs bedroom when the blaze was triggered by furniture being lit downstairs at around 4:00 a.m. Preston and another woman had a violent row the day before and that woman was said to have later uttered a threat against the pair, but she denied any role in the blaze when she attended their inquest hearing.\n|-\n|June 2005\n|June Thrussell\n|Dagenham, London\n|56-year-old Thrussell was found strangled to death in her home on Friday 17 June 2005 after one of her colleagues had informed the police that she had not turned up for her work as a secretary since Tuesday of that week. A man who had been convicted in 1976 of a murder committed the year before was cleared of Thrussell's murder but went back to prison despite that because there were concerns that he was still a danger to others.\n|-\n|June 2005\n|Troy Robinson\n|Stonebridge, London\n|A group of people were standing outside James Dudson Court in Wyborne Way, Stonebridge, at around 9:45 p.m. on 19 June 2005 when one or more men got out of a car that had just pulled up and randomly fired bullets at them. 19-year-old Robinson was shot in the chest and pronounced dead on arrival at a local hospital; two other men in their late teens received gunshot wounds to their legs and survived. A man was paralysed from the neck down a year later in a shooting suspected to have been a revenge attack for Robinson's murder.\n|-\n|June 2005\n|Bill Marney\n|Crayford, London\n|39-year-old Marney lived in Mill Place in Crayford and was shot outside his home on 23 June 2005 by a man in a dark hatchback that was probably a Rover 45 or a Peugeot.

The murder happened after that of Orville Davidson – a friend of his – in March 2005, and both remain unsolved.\n|-\n|July/August 2005\n|Newton Thompson\n|Paddington, London\n|Thompson was a 61-year-old Australian who was found dead from blows to the head in his room at the Comfort Inn hotel on 1 August 2005. Property belonging to him had been taken, too. Because a child sex abuser who was also from Australia and had also recently come to the UK bore a strong resemblance to Thompson, it was believed that the murder might have been a case of mistaken identity.\n|-\n|August 2005\n|Lucy Hargreaves\n|Liverpool\n|Three masked men armed with a sawn-off shotgun forced their way into 22-year-old Hargreaves's house on Lambourne Road, Walton, on 3 August 2005 while she was asleep on the living room sofa. She was then shot twice in the abdomen and once in the head at point-blank range before petrol was poured at various locations downstairs and ignited. Hargreaves's boyfriend, who it is thought might have been the intended target, escaped from the burning property by jumping with the couple's youngest daughter from an upstairs window. They were asleep upstairs when the perpetrators gained access.\n|-\n|August 2005\n|James Tomlin\n|Shipley, West Yorkshire\n|36-year-old Tomlin went into cardiac arrest and died during the early hours of 15 August after jumping from a bedroom window at his home in Windhill to escape a fire that began when kerosene was poured through the letterbox and ignited. However, it was not heart failure or the fall that caused his death, but the inhaling of smoke and poisonous gasses. Also inside the property were Tomlin's pregnant 26-year-old partner and their two sons, who all escaped and survived. Because the arson attack was a seemingly motiveless crime against a family with no criminal ties, detectives considered it a possibility that the property was not the intended target.\n|-\n|September 2005\n|Kenneth Nunn\n|Whittlesford, Cambridgeshire\n|85-year-old Nunn died in an apparent arson attack on his home in Whittlesford on the night of 6–7 September 2005.

He was last seen alive eight days previously, arguing on his doorstep with a man thought to have been in his 20s. It came to be suspected that the murder of 84-year-old Willis, a bachelor who often tried to make friends by giving money to strangers, might have been a homophobic crime carried out by people who assumed that being a lifelong unmarried man meant he was gay.\n|-\n|October 2005\n|Anthony Cavanagh\n|Liverpool\n|22-year-old Cavanagh was knocked to the ground in a single punch on Saturday 24 September 2005 after bumping into another man in a bar in central Liverpool earlier in the night, and his death occurred in hospital 11 days later. An arrest over Cavanagh's murder was made in 2015, but the arrested man was not charged.\n|-\n|October 2005\n|Nora Tait\n|Doncaster, South Yorkshire\n|Tait was 69 when she was bludgeoned at her home in Stone Close Avenue, Hexthorpe, on 12 October 2005.

Police made a new appeal for information on the 10th anniversary of Tait's murder in 2015.\n|-\n|October 2005\n|Alexandre Marques\n|Luton, Bedfordshire\n|Marques, 61, was last seen at his home in Clanricarde Gardens, Notting Hill, London, on Sunday 16 October 2005. His remains were found on 2 January 2006 on the grass verge of Woodside Road, Luton. CCTV images showed a man using Marques's bank card in west and northwest London shortly after his disappearance. In January 2021, police reported that they had a new forensic lead and that a £20,000 reward was still available.\n|-\n|October 2005\n|Isaiah Young-Sam\n|Birmingham\n|23-year-old Young-Sam and three companions were in a backstreet in Lozells on 22 October 2005 when a group of Asian men confronted them and one of them fatally stabbed him in the chest. Race riots were going on in the area at the time, triggered by an unsubstantiated rumour that Asians had gang-raped a black girl. Two trials resulted in four convictions for Young-Sam's murder, but each conviction was overturned by April 2011.\n|-\n|November 2005\n|Andrea Daly\n|Southend, Essex\n|40-year-old Daly died when her house on Rochford Road, Southend, was set alight at nighttime on 10 November 2005.

Her body was found by canoeists in Priory Lake, Bedford, in January 2006. Garsztka's boyfriend was found guilty of her murder in 2007, but his conviction was quashed in 2009 and he went on to win a libel action against Bedfordshire Police in 2012, being awarded £125,000.\n|-\n|December 2005\n|Hallam Tennyson\n|Highgate, London\n|85-year-old Tennyson, a retired author and former BBC employee, was stabbed to death in his home in Highgate on 21 December 2005 shortly after being filmed by CCTV at two London tube stations.

Not long before that incident, he and one of the car's two passengers (a male friend; the other was Williams-Samuels's sister) had tried unsuccessfully to get into the club, and an altercation with someone at the entrance is said to have occurred. A court acquitted a man of murder in 2008 after the evidence against him was found to be insufficient.\n|-\n|January 2006\n|Ralph Platten\n|Attacked in Sutton, Norfolk, died at the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital\n|A group of men pushed past the 95-year-old war veteran and beat him when he opened his front door on 3 January 2006; he died of heart failure the next day. Five people charged in relation to the incident did not go to court over it because the Crown Prosecution Service found that there was not enough evidence to link any of them to it.\n|-\n|January 2006\n|Subramaniam Sivakumar\n|Willesden, London\n|Likely the victim of a ritual killing, 44-year-old Sivakumar was found dead in his shop with a shoelace around his neck and wounds behind one of his ears on 5 January 2006.\n|-\n|January 2006\n|Richard Zephaniah\n|Basildon, Essex\n|39-year-old Zephaniah was stabbed outside his flat in Bockingham Green, Basildon, on 6 January 2006. Three men were arrested on suspicion of his murder, but in 2007 the Crown Prosecution Service ruled there was insufficient evidence to pursue a prosecution.\n|-\n|January 2006\n|Joyce Sutton\n|Skewen, Wales\n|Sutton, 65, was found dead in her bed at her home in Winifred Road, Skewen, on 11 January 2006.

Police suspected early on in their investigation into his murder that the two people they most wanted to speak to about it (men who were Iraqi nationals, as was Samin) did not live in Leicestershire any longer.\n|-\n|January 2006\n|Sukhwinder Singh\n|Epsom, Surrey\n|27-year-old Singh was strangled and his body left in the car park of Epsom Downs Racecourse, where it was found on the morning of 21 January 2006.

Because he was careful about whom he let in there and no signs of forced entry were found, police thought there was a strong possibility that he knew his attacker(s).\n|-\n|March 2006\n|Jamie Campbell\n|Glasgow\n|Four men were convicted in 2022 of the April 2018 gun murder of Kenneth Reilly in Glasgow's Maryhill area, but one of them was acquitted at the same trial of shooting dead 47-year-old Campbell in the Drumchapel area of the city on 4 March 2006. Lawyers acting for the man acquitted of this offence claimed that another murdered man – gangster Kevin Carroll, who died in 2010 – was Campbell's killer. Campbell and his son were acquitted in 2004 over the January 2003 murder of Kevin Clark. At that trial, the son was accused of killing Clark and Campbell was accused of cutting up the son's football top and tracksuit bottoms.\n|-\n|March 2006\n|Jordan Jackson and Leyla Djemal-Northcott\n|Upper Norwood, London\n|20-year-old Jackson and 21-year-old Djemal-Northcott, Jackson's girlfriend, were shot dead in their flat in Menlo Gardens, Upper Norwood, on 7 March 2006 when Jackson, who was said to have stolen £5,000 from a violent drug dealer, answered the door to two men wearing ski masks. Jackson's brother was shot too but survived, and the girlfriend of this brother, who was likewise at the flat that day, hid from the gunmen and was not found by them. Four men were charged with murder in 2011. Two of the suspects were identical twins, with one alleged to have been one of the shooters and the other to have acted as a lookout, and the police tried to train witnesses to tell them apart by creating sets of virtual twins for those witnesses to study – a measure that a judge found \"intelligent and imaginative\" but \"ultimately deficient\", prompting him to throw the case out.\n|-\n|March 2006\n|Carlton Alveranga and Richard Austin\n|Salford, Greater Manchester\n|Alveranga, 20, and Austin, 19, were recruited to murder David Totton, and entered Salford's Brass Handles pub on Sunday 12 March 2006 to carry out their task. Although Totton was shot, he survived. His assailants were then disarmed and shot dead with their own guns. Alveranga and Austin's clients were convicted of conspiracy to murder in 2007, but the killer or killers of their would-be hitmen remain unidentified.\n|-\n|March 2006\n|Michael Shipton\n|Sheering, Essex\n|Shipton, known as Joe, was 61 when he was found dead at his home in The Plashets, Sheering, on 25 March 2006.

Three men were put on trial, but the judge dismissed the case on the grounds of shortage of evidence. The shooting was witnessed by James Andre Smartt-Ford, a 16-year-old who was himself shot dead in February 2007; his murder also remains unsolved.\n|-\n|April/May 2006\n|Philip Salmon\n|Farnborough, Hampshire\n|Salmon disappeared aged 41 at the end of April 2006 and his burnt corpse was found on a golf course on 16 June. A post mortem failed to establish a cause of death but did find that a flammable liquid was used to help start the fire.\n|-\n|May 2006\n|Aaron Watson\n|Leeds\n|Watson, 27, was shot in the Creation nightclub on Cookridge Street, Leeds, on 1 May 2006, and died from his injuries in hospital nine days later. Police believed his killers were from the Manchester area.\n|-\n|May 2006\n|Luke Durbin\n|Body not found\n|19-year-old Durbin left an Ipswich nightclub on his own in the early hours of Friday 12 May 2006 when he had become separated from a friend, and later tried – unsuccessfully because he did not have any money on him – to get a taxi back to his home in the Suffolk village of Hollesley. CCTV footage showed him walking towards a bus station in Ipswich town centre at around 4:00 a.m., but his movements after then are a mystery. In 2012, two men aged 41 and 26 were arrested on suspicion of being connected with Durbin's murder, but neither was charged. In 2020, it was disclosed that Durbin may have been in debt to drug dealers.\n|-\n|June 2006\n|Neil Davies\n|Neath, Wales\n|27-year-old Davies was stabbed in the chest during a barbecue at his home on Caederwen Road, Neath, on 25 June 2006. His wife stood trial for his murder in 2007 but was found not guilty.\n|-\n|July 2006\n|Ernest Gifford\n|Manchester\n|45-year-old Gifford, a small-time drug dealer, was shot in the thigh by one of three masked men during a robbery bid at his house in Moss Side, Manchester, on 4 July 2006. A man had his murder conviction quashed after arguing that the presence of his DNA on a glove print in the house might have been due to someone borrowing his gloves, and that footprints there that matched the tread of a pair of trainers he owned could not have been his because he did not buy the trainers until after the killing.\n|-\n|July 2006\n|Jim Stanton\n|Liverpool\n|At around 6:00 p.m. on the evening of Monday 24 July 2006, two armed men burst into the car showroom where 58-year-old Stanton worked as a salesman, and opened fire. Although his colleagues managed to escape to safety, Stanton was stuck behind his desk metres from the back wall of the showroom and was shot several times. Merseyside Police suspect that he might not have been the intended target of the attack, and have offered a £20,000 reward for information leading to the convictions of those behind it.\n|-\n|July 2006\n|Beata Bryl\n|Wooburn, Buckinghamshire\n|23-year-old Bryl was captured on CCTV at Leytonstone tube station, east London, on 28 July 2006.

Bryl was originally from Poland and came to the UK in 2003. Her mother believed her daughter was in an unhappy relationship with an older, controlling man.\n|-\n|August 2006\n|Roy Helm\n|Oxford\n|The 40-year-old window cleaner suffered rib fractures and a damaged liver before being found lifeless in his flat on 12 August 2006. A man on trial the following April was alleged to have attacked Helm for calling his girlfriend – who was also Helm's ex-girlfriend – a name, but a defence lawyer said that the girlfriend's description of the assault was at odds with the victim's fatal injuries and that she was the one who inflicted them. The man was acquitted and his girlfriend was not charged with anything in relation to Helm's death.\n|-\n|August 2006\n|George \"Goofy\" Docherty\n|Glasgow\n|46-year-old Docherty, a career criminal once sentenced to seven years in prison for his role in an attempted murder, was repeatedly run over and then stabbed multiple times in a daytime attack in Glasgow's Glenshee Street on 28 August 2006.\n|-\n|September 2006\n|Jessie James\n|Manchester\n|15-year-old James was shot dead in Broadfield Park, Moss Side, in the early hours of 9 September 2006 by a person or people who had been hiding in the bushes. It is believed his murder may have been a case of mistaken identity. Police have been concerned about the lack of witnesses coming forward, possibly due to fear of the repercussions.\n|-\n|September 2006\n|Duncan Frame\n|Thamesmead, London\n|Frame, 52, suffered head injuries and heart failure after getting caught up in a nighttime brawl at the Cutty Sark pub in Thamesmead on Saturday 9 September 2006. Fans of Tottenham Hotspur F.C. and Charlton Athletic F.C. had gathered there, but the latter of these clubs later issued a statement denying that the brawl was to do with football.\n|-\n|September 2006\n|Dean Myles\n|Bristol\n|19-year-old Myles was shot in a Bristol nightclub during a visit to the city from London on Saturday 16 September 2006. Four men faced murder charges at trial, and one of them was acquitted. Because the jury could not reach a verdict on any of the other three, a retrial was sought, but the case against them ended up being dropped because the Court of Appeal would not permit statements from anonymous witnesses to be read out in court in their absence.\n|-\n|September 2006\n|Jason Gale-Bent\n|Attacked in New Cross, London, died in hospital\n|Gale-Bent, 29, was outside with his brother and a friend on 17 September 2006 when a gang of youths who were not known to them approached and attacked him. As well as being beaten, he was hit with an airgun pellet and received two stab wounds, one of which penetrated his heart and was the fatal injury. Police considered the incident to be possibly linked to one involving a man being chased and stabbed in Deptford later on the same day.\n|-\n|September 2006\n|Dean Jeffery\n|Bristol\n|39-year-old Jeffery died on 28 September 2006 after being attacked a week earlier as he walked back to his home near Fishponds Road in Bristol from a trip to a local shop.\n|-\n|October 2006\n|Antoine Smith\n|Clapham, London\n|Two youths on bicycles shot 24-year-old Smith near a pizza takeaway in Clapham on 20 October 2006 in what was thought to have been a gangland slaying.\n|-\n|October 2006\n|David Lees\n|Manchester\n|A silver Vauxhall Vectra was deliberately driven into 23-year-old Lees in Middleton Road, Prestwich, on the night of 27/28 October 2006 after an altercation between his group and a group of Asian men at a petrol station on that road.

He initially survived the attack and was treated in hospital, but was left with brain damage and partial paralysis. In March 2007 Vassell was discharged, but on 27 December 2007 he collapsed at his home in Harringay Road and died. Vassell's case then became a murder one and the Metropolitan Police offered a £20,000 reward to anyone who had information leading to a conviction.\n|-\n|November 2006\n|Jamail Newton\n|Camberwell, London\n|19-year-old Newton was shot several times on 1 November 2006 whilst outside a Camberwell Green nightclub with friends.\n|-\n|November 2006\n|Christopher Elliott\n|Leeds\n|39-year-old Elliott's burnt body was found near Roundhay Road on 20 November 2006 after he was taken from his Bramley flat and battered to death.

It was alleged at trial that he began plotting to kill Van Lill after they fell out whilst on holiday in Van Lill's native South Africa in 2006, with the prosecution also drawing attention to a list found at the defendant's home of methods to kill and ways to get rid of evidence and the body following a killing – a list he maintained was just fantasy and did not contain anything he intended to put into practice. The defence in turn drew attention to the failure of forensic scientists to link him to Van Lill's disappearance, and after more than 12 hours of deliberation, the jury cleared him.\n|-\n|March 2010\n|Nigel Price\n|Southampton\n|58-year-old Price lapsed into a semi-coma following a beating on Southampton Common on 13/14 November 2009, and died on 23 March 2010.

Although the pub was not an establishment Erdmann was known to have visited previously and the decision to murder him appeared to have been a last-minute one, it was nevertheless speculated that it was a decision stemming from disrespect shown by him on an earlier occasion. The opinion of detectives, however, was that he was killed simply because he was from a different part of Salford to the area the pub was in.\n|-\n|September 2011\n|Isobel Dobson\n|Hessle, West Yorkshire\n|Two-year-old Dobson died in a fire at Hessle Farm, Hessle, a hamlet near Wakefield, on 30 September 2011.
