The peacekeeping force is envisaged only to be deployed the moment Ukraine and Russia sign a \"comprehensive ceasefire agreement\" or \"peace deal\" to settle the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War. The initiative, led by the United Kingdom and France, was announced by British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on 2 March 2025, following the 2025 London Summit on Ukraine under the motto \"securing our future\".\nThe stated aim of the initiative is to facilitate the peace negotiation attempts launched and mediated by the United States between Ukraine and Russia in February 2025, by helping to build up strong enough security guarantees for Ukraine to ensure that a potential reached ceasefire or peace deal would be lasting. Besides serving the role as building up a potential peacekeeping force, the coalition have also expressed readiness to increase military support for Ukraine and strengthen economic sanctions against Russia, in the event that the ongoing negotiations for a \"comprehensive ceasefire\" or \"peace deal\" would fail. As of 20 March 2025, the exact shape and function of the coalition was described as still being subject to ongoing planning, but moved into an \"operational phase\".\nHistory\n]]According to a report from Le Monde'', in late November 2024 Paris and London were discussing taking the lead in a coalition to be deployed in Ukraine, on terms not then defined. This was in light of Trump's return to the White House and the prospect of American disengagement from Kyiv. The option of sending \"troops\" to Ukraine, the debate on which French President Emmanuel Macron had launched at a meeting of Kyiv's allies in Paris in February 2024, was strongly opposed by some European countries, led by Germany. This scenario had not been buried however and was revived during the visit of British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer to France for the 11 November Armistice Day ceremonies. On 1 March 2025, Czech president Petr Pavel made a social media post on X, calling for the formation of a coalition of the willing to end the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n| linking_name   = Coalition of the willing (Russo-Ukrainian war)\n|conventional_long_name =\n|native_name   =\n| life_span              = ||present}}\n| era = Russian invasion (UKR, ongoing&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;days)\n| languages_type     =   Political constraints\n| languages      = Populist&nbsp;CoW&nbsp;cabinets\n| loctext = Permanent&nbsp;HQ&nbsp;not&nbsp;established\n| official_languages     =\n| status = (oper.)

Starmer characterised the meeting as addressing a \"once-in-a-generation moment\" for European security, stating that the time had come for decisive action rather than continued deliberation, and officially announced Britain and France would lead a European \"coalition of the willing\" to provide security guarantees to Ukraine and enable peace negotiations with Russia. The announcement came two days after a meeting between Zelenskyy and United States President Donald Trump with Vice President JD Vance at the White House on 28 February.\nOn 11 March 2025, the military chiefs of staff of around 30 European and Commonwealth nations, as well as Japan, met in Paris for talks on the creation of an international security force for Ukraine to maintain peace should a ceasefire come into effect.\nOn 15 March, Starmer held a virtual meeting with leaders from European and Commonwealth nations to assemble the \"coalition of the willing\" to consider options for a \"reassurance force\" to be deployed within Ukraine to deter renewed Russian attacks against the country should a ceasefire be agreed. The meeting gathered the leaders of 26 countries, including several European countries, Ukraine, Turkey, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, as well as representatives from the European Commission and NATO; and was addressed by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Keir Starmer as well as French president Emmanuel Macron, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.\nOn 17 March 2025, a spokesman of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom stated the coalition was expected to grow to \"more than 30 countries\", when military chiefs from the willing countries would be meeting, once again, on 20 March 2025 to discuss the next \"operational phase\" in protecting Ukraine as part of a peacekeeping forceif a deal can be agreed with Russia. The spokesman added: \"The contribution capabilities will vary, but this will be a significant force, with a significant number of countries providing troops and a larger group [of countries] contributing in other ways.\"\nOn 20 March 2025, the exact shape and function of the coalition was described as still being subject to ongoing planning, but moved into an \"operational phase\" marked by the gathering of a meeting of military officials from 31 countries. No final decisions were announced after the meeting, but some media reported the participants had contemplated that the coalition could have two different designs depending on whether or not it should be deployed to defend a ceasefire agreement or a peace deal.\nFive military sub-planning groups (land, sea, air, regeneration and reconstruction) will reconvene the military officials from the 31 countries to continue discussions across three intensive planning days from 24–26 March at the Northwood Headquarters in England.\nThe coalition then met again for a third high-level summit in Paris on 27 March 2025, with an agenda to finalise the plans on how the coalition shall be designed and deployed as a military force to ensure that a potential ceasefire will be lasting for Ukraine. The agenda of the summit included drafting and debating a peace treaty proposal written by the coalition, drafting and debating how the coalition can secure a \"complete ceasefire\" acceptable to Ukraine, bolster aid to Ukraine (with each participating country expected to outline what it is prepared to do), and agreeing on a plan for providing long-term support for the Ukrainian army. The outcome of the meeting was unanimous agreement that:\n* No sanctions against Russia could be lifted as part of a temporary ceasefire agreement.\n* A potential sanctions relief should instead be conditioned on reaching a peace deal.\n* Defense chiefs from Ukraine, France and UK should soon meet in Ukraine to conduct the next stage of the detailed planning for setting up a potential reassurance force (determining the number of soldiers and type of military equipment required to be deployed after a reached peace deal, in order to deter and respond to a subsequently potential renewed Russian aggression).\nOn 24 April 2025, The Times reported that British officials considered deploying a ground force to defend Ukraine too risky and that the plan was likely to be abandoned, with military trainers deployed to Western Ukraine instead. On 29 April 2025, it reported that Europe \"would struggle to put 25,000 troops on the ground in Ukraine\". Lithuania's defense minister Dovile Sakaliene reportedly said \"Russia has 800,000 [troops]. Let me tell you this, if we can't even raise 64,000 that doesn't look weak — it is weak.\"\nOn 17 July 2025, UK defence secretary John Healey  provided an update to the House of Commons on the war in Ukraine revealing command structure, components, and supposed name of the coalition force - Multinational Force Ukraine. The name was confirmed on 17 August in the coalition statement. Joined by NATO military chiefs between 19 and 21 August, coalition planners held virtual meetings on Ukraine with focus on security guarantees design.\nIn addition to summits, the coalition has convened its second ministerial (3 September, NATO HQ, Brussels) and first directors-level (4 November, Madrid) meetings.\nHigh-level meetings\nThe coalition so far held the following number of high-level meetings, in order to help facilitate the peace negotiation attempts aiming to reach a \"comprehensive ceasefire agreement\" or \"peace deal\" to settle the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!\n!Date\n!Host\n!Chair\n!Location\n!ParticipatingNations\n!Ref.\n|-\n!1\n|2 March 2025\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Keir Starmer\n|Lancaster House, London\n| style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n}}\n|\n|-\n! 2\n|15 March 2025\n| Virtual meeting\n| style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n}}\n|\n|-\n! 3\n|27 March 2025\n|\n|Emmanuel Macron\n| Élysée Palace, Paris\n| style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n}}\n|\n|-\n! 4\n|10 April 2025\n|\n|Mark Rutte\n|NATO&nbsp;headquarters, Brussels\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n}}\n|\n|-\n! 5\n|10 May 2025\n|\n|Volodymyr Zelenskyy\n|Kyiv, Mariinskyi Palace\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n}}\n|\n|-\n! 6\n|10 July 2025\n|\n|Keir Starmer\n|Northwood Headquarters, Eastbury\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n}}\n|\n|-\n!7\n|4 September 2025\n|\n|Emmanuel Macron\n|Élysée Palace, Paris\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n}}\n|\n|-\n! 8\n|24 October 2025\n|\n|Keir Starmer\n|Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, Westminster\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n}}\n|\n|}\nBesides of representatives from the participating nations, the following people also attended the above meetings:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Organisation\n! scope=\"col\" | Represented by\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n|-\n|\n| Antonio CostaUrsula von der Leyen\n| President of the European CouncilPresident of the European Commission\n|-\n|\n| Mark Rutte\n| Secretary general of NATO\n|}\nAims\nThe ''raison d'être of the initiative was created by the peace negotiation attempts launched and mediated by the United States between Ukraine and Russia in February 2025, as those negotiations initially did not present or offer Ukraine any substantial security guarantees to defend a potentially reached peace deal; while it was acknowledged that in order to ensure that a potential peace would be lasting for Ukraine then some stronger security guarantees than the pre-existing 1994 Budapest Memorandum'' would be needed, and at the same time became clear that the previously considered proposal to offer Ukraine an immediate membership of NATO as a security guarantee could not be realised. Besides serving the role as building up a potential peacekeeping force, the coalition also expressed readiness to increase military support for Ukraine and strengthen economic sanctions against Russia, in the event that the ongoing negotiations for a \"comprehensive ceasefire\" or \"peace deal\" would fail.\nFour point-plan\nIn a press conference that followed the London summit, Starmer outlined four key components of the coalition's approach:\n# Commitment to maintaining the flow of military aid to Ukraine while increasing economic pressure on Russia through sanctions and other measures.\n# Affirming that any lasting peace agreement must ensure the sovereignty and security of Ukraine, with Ukraine being present at all peace negotiations.\n# Pledging to enhance Ukraine's defensive military capabilities following any peace deal to deter potential future invasions.\n# Development of a \"coalition of the willing\" consisting of multiple countries prepared to defend the terms of any peace agreement and guarantee Ukraine's security afterwards.\nMembership\nThe group consists largely of European and Commonwealth countries (see infobox Allies).\nAustralia was not represented at the 10 April 2025 meeting (see §).\nStarmer publicly announced Japan had joined the Coalition of the Willing on 15 March 2025, however Japan did not joined a high-level coalition meeting until 13 August, when Shigeru Ishiba, Prime Minister of Japan joined the 7th CoW meeting (leaders) by video conference. He also attended the next two virtual meetings.\nDespite being represented in the virtual meeting on 15 March, and the 10 May meeting, New Zealand was not represented in subsequent 27 March and 10 April meetings.\nThe People's Republic of China declared willingness to take part in Ukraine's post-war reconstruction on 18 March, and according to the German newspaper Die Welt, China also contemplated joining the Coalition of the willing if being invited on 22 March. The Chinese Foreign Ministry later officially denied reports that China could ever join the coalition, as partaking in a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine spearheaded by European leaders was viewed to conflict with its policy of neutrality in Russo-Ukrainian War.\n, Albania has satisfied the standard for membership in the Coalition of the Willing by confirming three cabinet-level participations in Coalition summits, with the total number of committed nations at 34 to be confirmed in the meetings to follow.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Albania's Cabinet-Level Participation in CoW Meetings\n!

The missiles will be manufactured in Belfast in Northern Ireland. This complemented a previously announced £2.2 billion loan for military aid to Ukraine backed by frozen Russian assets.\nStarmer emphasised that European countries would need to take primary responsibility for the initiative and \"do the heavy lifting\" and that the agreement would require US backing and Russian involvement. He indicated that the United Kingdom would back its security commitments with \"boots on the ground, and planes in the air\", regarding the possibility of UK and EU direct military presence in Ukraine to carry out a peace enforcement operation.\nPresident of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen emphasised the \"urgent need to re-arm Europe,\" to support such security guarantees after \"a long time of underinvestment\". She suggested that the European Union might need to ease its fiscal rules regarding national debt to facilitate increased defence spending by member states.\nSecretary General of NATO Mark Rutte echoed this sentiment, noting that the meeting demonstrated European countries \"stepping up\" to ensure Ukraine has the resources necessary to \"stay in the fight as long as it has to continue.\"\nRight after the meeting, Finland's president Alexander Stubb said that Norway and Finland are working in support of the drafting of the UK-France-Ukraine peace plan. In addition, he said that the role of the countries that are Russia's neighbours will be different from providing peacekeeping troops.\nOn 30 April 2025, Estonian Prime Minister Kristen Michal offered to contribute \"a company-sized unit (50 to 250 soldiers), including combat troops, instructors, and staff officers\" as part of the \"coalition of the willing\". Portugal has pledged €226 million towards the supply of weapons and military equipment, in addition to training for pilots and drone operators. Denmark has invested in sustainable indigenous Ukrainian production of equipment (the Danish model), made possible through the support of the European Union.\nInternational law and peace enforcement framework for Ukraine\nThe legal architecture for the coalition’s peacekeeping mission is evolving in  the shadow of UN precedent and international law. Deployment is to occur only with a comprehensive, signed ceasefire or peace deal, respecting Ukraine’s sovereignty and the norms prohibiting intervention in active conflicts without host-country consent. Rules of engagement, status of forces, and chain of command are being negotiated in detail, taking lessons from previous 'coalitions of the willing'., the main discussion points in academia on security studies are:\n:;Mandate ambiguity for a reassurance force in Ukraine\n:;Peacekeeping versus peace enforcement\n-Consent and sovereignty\n-Authority to use force\n:;Current proposals and political signals shaping the mandate\n-Coalition commitments: as of early September 2025, 26 countries publicly committed to a reassurance force contingent on a ceasefire or peace deal, signaling breadth of political support but not resolving the legal basis or full operational scope;\n-Force composition and options\n-Willing contributors\n-Security guarantees landscape\n:;Rules of engagement, status of forces, and chain of command\n-Rules of engagement (ROE)\n-Status of forces agreements (SOFAs)\n-Command and control (2C)\n:;Managing the peace enforcement versus peacekeeping tension\n-Mandate drafting\n-Consent architecture: to anchor the mission in Ukraine’s formal invitation and parliamentary authorization (According to Ukraine's Prime Minister’s Office statement on 10 July 2025, Ukraine is ready to issue an invitation to the force and enter into formal agreements with participating nations as and when necessary), complemented by the coalition parliamentary approvals and harmonized national caveats annexed to the mandate. If UNSC authorization is infeasible, transparency and legality via public instruments, SOFAs, and ROE publication (to the extent possible) bolster legitimacy;\n-Escalation ladders and accountability\n:;Practical risks and mitigation steps}}\n,  lack of specific 'reassurance force in Ukraine' legal analysis highlights the risks of ambiguity in force mandate, especially in the context of 'robust peace enforcement' (as opposed to traditional peacekeeping).\nThe Multinational Force–Ukraine (MNF‑U)\nMNF-U is a Coalition's stabilization and peacekeeping future force with 33 nation-contributors, formalized in October 2025  by France and the United Kingdom. Conceived as a rapid deployment force in response to the  ceasefire in Russo‑Ukrainian War, if comprehensively agreed, it is to operate with English as its working language and under extended multinational agreements. Coalition’s expected mandate to support a comprehensive ceasefire and post-war stabilization in Ukraine includes military logistics, training, force generation, naval mine‑clearing, and air policing.\nIts planned command structure is divided between a joint command headquarters in Paris and a coordination headquarters in Kyiv, with a French three‑star commander in Paris and a British two‑star deputy in Kyiv. ,  MNF‑U remains in the planning phase, with deployment to follow the cessation of hostilities. The MNF-U's structure, mandate, and legitimacy have quickly become points of discussion not only among governments but also within the media and academic communities across Europe and beyond.\nSee also\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* August 2025 White House multilateral meeting on Ukraine\n*\nNotes\nReferences"
