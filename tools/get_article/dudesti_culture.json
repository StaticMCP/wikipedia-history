This culture contributed to the origin of both the subsequent Hamangia culture and the Boian culture. It was named after Dudești, a quarter in the southeast of Bucharest.\nSee also\n* Prehistoric Romania\n* Old Europe (archaeology)\n* Prehistoric Europe\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Dudesti culture\n\n#REDIRECT Dudești culture\n\n---\n\n## Dudeşti culture\n\n#REDIRECT Dudești culture"
