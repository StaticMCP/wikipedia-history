With help from their financing, LaGrange purchased two ships, the Joybert  and Philipeau. LaGrange also recruited at least 26 men, free of charge, with the promise of shared plunder. Oliver Morel de La Durantaye and Denis-Joseph Juchereau de La Ferté were known members among his crew. LaGrange also recruited men from the Abenaki tribe, who had also served with him in the Avalon Peninsula campaign. LaGrange took command of the Joybert while French merchant, Claude Pauperet, took command of the Philipeau.\nIn 1704, LaGrange sailed from New France to Newfoundland.\nThe battle\nIn the early morning hours of 18 August, LaGrange and his two ships sailed into Bonavista Harbour. Here there were several ships at anchor, including the 250 ton Pembroke Galley from London, commanded by John Noll and a ship commanded by Captain Michael Gill; an English mariner from Charlestown, Massachusetts.\nUnder the cover of night and fog, LaGrange and his men snuck on to two ships, the Society and William, plundering them and later setting them on fire. They also captured the Pembroke Galley, despite her being an armed vessel with 24 guns and 44 cremen; she was laden down with 2500 quintals of dried cod. LaGrange also ordered for the town of Bonavista to be sacked and burnt. LaGrange also took the captains and crew of the Society and William prisoner.\nWhen day had broke and the fog lifted, the ship commanded by Captain Michael Gill and armed with 14 guns and 24 crewmen, emerged from anchor, ready for battle. Gill and LaGrange then engaged and it was said that the battle had lasted 6 hours. Once members of the local militia got word of the battle, they rallied together and joined the battle from the shore. Gill's ship was crippled but he and the militia drove LaGrange and his ships out, successfully defending the town of Bonavista.\nLaGrange fled with his two ships and the captured Pembroke Galley and returned to New France. 40 leagues off Bonavista, LaGrange set his prisoners free and gave them a boat; they returned to Newfoundland unharmed.\nAftermath\nThe spoils of the battle were divided amongst the crew in Quebec, each crewman received 40 écus. Some of the cod from the Pembroke Galley was also sold in Quebec to lighten the load and prepare for her journey to Europe. The Pembroke Galley was later recaptured by the English somewhere between Bilbao, Spain and La Rochelle, France.\nAs a reward for his exploits, LaGrange was appointed captain of the flute in the king's navy, a position he held for several years.\nCaptain Gill was commended by the Flying Post in London for his defense of Bonavista.\nIn popular culture\n* A ballad recounting the story, titled ''Gill's Fight at Bonavista, was written by George Hoskins of Newfoundland.\n* A ballad recounting the story, titled Skipper Michael Gill, 1704'', was written by A.J. O'Rielly of Newfoundland.\nReferences"
