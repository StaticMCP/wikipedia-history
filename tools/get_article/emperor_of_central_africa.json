Bokassa, who had already ruled the Central African Republic (CAR) as a military dictator since taking power in the 1966 coup d'état, was officially crowned on 4 December 1977 in a lavish ceremony that was estimated to cost the Central African Empire US$20 million (equivalent to $&nbsp;million in ). Although nominally a constitutional monarch, in practice Bokassa ruled with absolute power. For all intents and purposes, the country was still a military dictatorship, as had been the case with the CAR.\nBokassa I attempted to justify his actions by claiming that creating a monarchy would help Central Africa \"stand out\" from the rest of the continent, and earn the world's respect. The coronation consumed one third of the nation's annual budget and all of the French aid that year; France also supplied substantial material support to the ceremony from both public and private sources. Despite generous invitations, no foreign leaders attended the event, although delegations were present, such as Robert Galley and René Journiac for France.\nHis rapprochement to Muammar Gaddafi and his widely publicized repression of internal dissent (culminating in the 1979 Ngaragba Prison massacre) created a rift between Bokassa and the French. The latter decided to depose him through a coup by intelligence service SDECE, codenamed Operation Caban, which took place on 19-20 September 1979. Former president David Dacko was reinstalled and abolished the imperial title.\nList of rulers\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!\n! Portrait\n! Name\n! Reign start\n!

The foundation of the House of Bokassa began in March 1972, when Jean-Bédel Bokassa proclaimed himself marshal and president-for-life of the Central African Republic. Public dissent continually grew over the next few years, surviving a coup attempt in December 1974, and narrowly escaped assassination in February 1976. International support was waning during this period as well, so in response Bokassa dissolved the republican government and established the Central African Revolutionary Council in September 1976.\nOn 4 December 1976, Bokassa instituted a new constitution, naming himself Emperor of the Central African Empire and his son, Jean-Bédel Bokassa Jr., was declared crown prince and heir to the throne. Bokassa maintained a harem of 19&nbsp;women despite converting to Catholicism. His wife Catherine Denguiadé became the Empress of Central Africa.\nNeither the United States nor any European country acknowledged or supported the newly founded monarchy, with the exception of France, whose president, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, held close ties to Bokassa throughout most of his regime (only breaking these ties shortly before the 1979 coup). Pope Paul VI refused to take part in the coronation ceremony.\nBokassa I had 40 children by his 19 wives. Notable among these are:\n* Jean-Serge Bokassa\n* Jean-Bédel Bokassa Jr., pretender to the Imperial Throne, formerly heir\n* Kiki Bokassa, an artist\nOf his grandchildren, those notable include:\n* Jean-Barthélémy Dédéavode-Bokassa, an artist and novelist\nBokassa also adopted several children, three of which were Africans. One of these, however, was born in Vietnam as Martine Nguyễn Thị Bái and became Martine Bokassa upon her adoption.\nGallery\nFile:Imperial Standard of Bokassa I (1976–1979).svg|Imperial Standard of Bokassa I.\nSee also\n* History of the Central African Republic\n* List of heads of state of the Central African Republic\nReferences\n* ."
