Voters chose nine representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for the president and vice president.\nMaine voted for the National Republican candidate, John Quincy Adams, over the Democratic candidate, Andrew Jackson. Adams won Maine by a margin of 19.68%. Adams received eight electoral votes and Jackson received one.\nWith 59.71% of the popular vote, Maine would prove to be Adams' fifth strongest state in the 1828 election after Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont and Connecticut.\nThis was the only time prior to the 2016 election (when Republican nominee Donald Trump received one of the state's four votes) that an electoral vote split occurred in Maine.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1828 United States presidential election in Maine\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#F0F071; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | National Republican\n| John Quincy Adams (incumbent)\n| align=\"right\" | 20,773\n| align=\"right\" | 59.71%\n| align=\"right\" | 8\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic\n| Andrew Jackson\n| align=\"right\" | 13,927\n| align=\"right\" | 40.03%\n| align=\"right\" | 1\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#c0c0c0; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | N/A\n| Other\n| align=\"right\" | 89\n| align=\"right\" | 0.26%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | Totals\n| align=\"right\" | 34,789\n| align=\"right\" | 100.0%\n| align=\"right\" | 9\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Maine\nReferences"
