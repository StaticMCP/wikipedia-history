They married on 14 May 2004 at Copenhagen Cathedral. They have four children: Christian, Isabella, Vincent and Josephine. Since her marriage, she has carried out engagements on behalf of the Danish monarchy, and she serves as patron of over 30 charitable organisations, including the United Nations Population Fund, the European regional office of the World Health Organization, the Danish Refugee Council and Julemærkefonden. She founded her award-winning social organisation, the Mary Foundation, in 2007.\nIn 2019, Mary was made a rigsforstander, which allows her to act as regent when the monarch is abroad. She became the first Australian-born queen consort of any country upon the abdication of her mother-in-law, Queen Margrethe II, on 14 January 2024. She has the additional title of Countess of Monpezat after her husband was given the title in 2008.\nEarly life\nMary Elizabeth Donaldson was born 5 February 1972 at Queen Alexandra Hospital, Hobart, Tasmania. She is youngest of four children to Scottish parents, Henrietta (née Horne), an executive assistant to the vice-chancellor of the University of Tasmania, and John Dalgleish Donaldson, an academic, mathematics professor and member of the Clan Donald. Her paternal grandfather was Captain Peter Donaldson (1911–1978). She was named after her grandmothers, Mary Dalgleish and Elizabeth Gibson Melrose, and was born and raised in Hobart. She has two older sisters, Jane Stephens and Patricia Bailey, and an older brother, John Stuart Donaldson. Her mother died from complications following heart surgery on 20 November 1997, when Mary was 25. In 2001, her father married the British author and novelist Susan Moody (née Horwood).\nDuring her childhood, Mary was involved in sports and other extracurricular activities both at school and elsewhere. She studied music, playing piano, flute, and clarinet, and played basketball and hockey.\nEducation\nMary began schooling at Clear Lake City Elementary School in Houston, Texas, when her father, a professor of applied mathematics, worked at the Johnson Space Center. She then moved to Sandy Bay, Tasmania, from 1975 to 1977. Her primary education, from 1978 to 1983, was at Waimea Heights with her secondary schooling (1984–1987) being at  Taroona High School, and  at Hobart College (1988–1989). She studied at the University of Tasmania from 1990 to 1994, graduating with a combined Bachelor of Commerce and Bachelor of Laws degree on 27 May 1995. From 1994 to 1996, she attended a graduate program and qualified with certificates in advertising from the Advertising Federation of Australia (AFA) and direct marketing from the Australian Direct Marketing Association (ADMA).\nHer native language is English, and she studied French during her secondary education. In 2002, she briefly worked as an English tutor in Paris while dating Crown Prince Frederik. After moving to Denmark and before her marriage, Mary studied Danish as a foreign language at Studieskolen in Copenhagen in 2003.\nCareer\nMary worked for Australian and global advertising agencies after graduating in 1995. Upon graduation she moved to Melbourne to work in advertising. She became a trainee in marketing and communications with the Melbourne office of DDB Needham, taking a position of account executive. In 1996, she was employed by Mojo Partners as an account manager. In 1998, six months after her mother's death, she resigned and travelled to America and Europe. In Edinburgh, she worked for three months as an account manager with Rapp Collins Worldwide; then, in early 1999, she was appointed as an account director with the international advertising agency Young & Rubicam in Sydney.\nIn June 2000, Mary moved to a smaller Australian agency, Love Branding, working for a short time as its first account director. In the (Australian) spring of 2000, she became sales director and a member of the management team of Belle Property, a real estate firm. In the first half of 2002, Mary taught English at a business school in Paris, but upon moving to Denmark permanently, she was employed by Microsoft Business Solutions (5 September 2002 – 24 September 2003) near Copenhagen as a project consultant for business development, communications and marketing.\nPersonal life\nCourtship and engagement\nMary met Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark at the Slip Inn in 2000 during the Summer Olympics in Sydney. Frederik was at the bar with his brother Prince Joachim, his cousin Prince Nikolaos of Greece and Denmark, as well as the then Felipe, Prince of Asturias and Princess Märtha Louise of Norway. Felipe knew Mary's flatmate. Frederik was not identified by her friends as the Crown Prince of Denmark until after they met. They conducted a long-distance relationship and Frederik made several discreet visits to Australia. On 15 November 2001, the Danish weekly magazine Billed Bladet named Mary as Frederik's girlfriend. She moved from Australia to Denmark in December 2001, while she was working as an English tutor in Paris.\nOn 24 September 2003, the Danish court announced that Queen Margrethe II intended to give her consent to the marriage at the State Council meeting scheduled for 8 October 2003. Frederik had presented Mary with an engagement ring featuring an emerald-cut diamond and two emerald-cut ruby baguettes, which are similar to the colour of the Dannebrog. The couple became officially engaged on 8 October 2003.\nMarriage and children\n(Stockholm, June 2013)]]\nMary and Frederik married on 14 May 2004 in Copenhagen Cathedral.

She was previously a dual citizen of Australia and the United Kingdom. Formerly a Presbyterian, she converted to the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Denmark upon marriage.\nAs a native English speaker, Mary's priority from the time of her engagement was to become fluent in Danish, and she acknowledged in several interviews at the time of her engagement and marriage that this was a challenge for her.\nMary and her family reside at Frederik VIII's Palace, one of the four palaces that make up the Amalienborg Palace complex. Since May 2004 they have also resided at the Chancellery House, a building in the park at Fredensborg Palace, during the summer months.\nMary is a keen equestrian and has competed at several dressage events.\nMary is the godmother of, among others, Princess Estelle of Sweden, who was also given the secondary name Mary in her honour, and her nephew, Count Henrik of Monpezat (then Prince Henrik of Denmark).\nQueen consort\nMary became Queen of Denmark upon the abdication of Queen Margrethe II and the subsequent accession of Mary's husband as King Frederik X on 14 January 2024.

Several of these, including a gala dinner at Rosenborg Castle, were cancelled due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but several hundred Danes showed up at Amalienborg's courtyard at noon on Mary's birthday. Rather than stepping out onto Frederik VIII's Palace's balcony as is customary for birthday celebrations in the Danish royal family, Mary and her three oldest children came out onto the courtyard to thank the people who had shown up.

In accordance with the statutes of the Danish Royal Orders, both Mary and her father were granted personal coats of arms, displayed on a stall plate in the Chapel of the Royal Orders at Frederiksborg Castle. The main field of Mary's coat of arms is Or-coloured and shows a MacDonald Gules eagle and a Sable-coloured boat both symbolising her Scottish ancestry. The Chief is Azure-coloured and shows two gold Commonwealth Stars from the arms of Australia, and a gold rose in between, depicting her personal symbol. The shield is surmounted by the Royal Crown of Denmark, and surrounded by the Collar of the Order of the Elephant.\nThe coat of arms of her father, Professor John Donaldson, is almost identical to that of the Queen, but a gold infinity symbol symbolises his career as an Australian mathematician, instead of her gold Rose. Above his shield is instead placed a barred helmet topped with a gules rampant lion, which is turned outward. The lion is derived from the arms of Scotland and also from the arms of Tasmania and Hobart. Both armorial bearings were granted in 2006 and installed in the Chapel of the Royal Orders in 2007.\nFile:Royal Monogram of Princess Mary of Denmark.svg|Royal monogram\nFile:Dual Cypher of Frederik and Mary of Denmark.svg|Joint monogram of Frederik and Mary\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n|-"
