It is named after Mike Kable, an Australian motoring journalist, motorsport publicist, and mentor to young racing drivers. The award is presented to the rookie driver adjudged to have performed the best over the course of their first season in either championship following a vote by a panel of motorsport experts. The recipient receives a sponsorship grant of A$15,000 to help develop themselves. The winner is announced at the series' end-of-season gala in Sydney.\nThe inaugural winner was Matthew White in 2000. The following year, the Stone Brothers Racing driver Marcos Ambrose won the award. Ambrose, James Courtney, Rick Kelly, Scott McLaughlin and Mark Winterbottom are the five recipients who have gone on to win either the Supercars Championship and/or the Bathurst 1000 in their careers. Australian drivers have won 21 times and New Zealanders twice. No one has won more than once; drivers from the second-tier championship have been honoured 14 times and Supercars competitors have won on 7 occasions. The 2023 recipient was Cameron McLeod, who finished in third place in the Super3 Series drivers' standings.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+Mike Kable Young Gun Award winners\n|-\n! scope=col | Year\n! scope=col  class=unsortable | Image\n! scope=col | Winner\n! scope=col | Nationality\n!Series\n! scope=col class=unsortable |\n|-\n|2000\n|\n| scope=row |\n|\n|Konica V8 Lites Series\n|\n|-\n|2001\n|\n| scope=row |\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |V8 Supercars\n|\n|-\n|2002\n|\n| scope=row |\n|\n|\n|-\n|2003\n|\n| scope=row |\n|\n|Konica V8 Supercar Series\n|\n|-\n|2004\n|\n| scope=row |\n|\n|V8 Supercars\n|\n|-\n|2005\n|\n| scope=row |\n|\n|HPDC V8 Supercar Series\n|\n|-\n|2006\n|\n| scope=row |\n|\n|V8 Supercars\n|\n|-\n|2007\n|\n| scope=row |\n|\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Fujitsu V8 Supercar Series\n|\n|-\n|2008\n|\n| scope=row |\n|\n|\n|-\n|2009\n|\n| scope=row |\n|\n|\n|-\n|2010\n|\n| scope=row |\n|\n|\n|-\n|2011\n|\n| scope=row |\n|\n|\n|-\n|2012\n|\n| scope=row |\n|\n|Dunlop V8 Supercar Series\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|\n| scope=row |\n|\n|V8 Supercars\n|\n|-\n|2014\n|\n| scope=row |\n|\n|Dunlop V8 Supercar Series\n|\n|-\n|2015\n|\n| scope=row |\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |V8 Supercars\n|\n|-\n|2016\n|\n| scope=row |\n|\n|\n|-\n|2017\n|\n| scope=row |\n|\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Super2 Series\n|\n|-\n|2018\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|2019\n|\n| scope=\"row\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|2020\n! scope=row colspan=5|\n|-\n|2021\n|\n|\n|\n| Super2 Series\n|\n|-\n|2022\n|\n|\n|\n| Super2 Series\n|\n|-\n|2023\n| —\n|\n|\n| Super3 Series\n|\n|-\n|2024\n| —\n|\n|\n| Super2 Series\n|\n|}\nStatistics\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Winners by nationality\n|-\n! scope=col | Country\n! scope=col data-sort-type=number | Winners\n|-\n! scope=row |\n| 23\n|-\n! scope=row |\n| 2\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Winners by series\n|-\n! scope=col | Series\n! scope=col data-sort-type=number | Winners\n|-\n! scope=row | Super2 Series\n| 15\n|-\n! scope=row | V8 Supercars\n| 7\n|-\n! scope=row | Super3 Series\n| 1\n|}\nSee also\n* Barry Sheene Medal\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
