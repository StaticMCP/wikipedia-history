Voters chose five representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nNew Hampshire voted for Democratic-Republican and Federalist-supported candidate and lieutenant governor of New York DeWitt Clinton over the incumbent Democratic-Republican President James Madison by a margin of 12.22%.\nAlthough Clinton won the state's presidential election, he lost to Madison in the national presidential election, making this the third time New Hampshire voted for a losing candidate in its presidential voting history.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n! colspan=\"6\" |1812 United States presidential election in New Hampshire\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#EA9978; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" |Democratic-Republican/Federalist\n|DeWitt Clinton\n| align=\"right\" |20,286\n| align=\"right\" |55.97%\n| align=\"right\" |8\n|-\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#008000; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" |Democratic-Republican\n|James Madison (incumbent)\n| align=\"right\" |15,907\n| align=\"right\" |43.89%\n| align=\"right\" |–\n|-\n!\n|–\n|Other\n|49\n|0.14%\n|–\n|-\n|- bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" |Totals\n| align=\"right\" |36,242\n| align=\"right\" |100.00%\n| align=\"right\" |8\n|}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in New Hampshire\nNotes\nReferences"
