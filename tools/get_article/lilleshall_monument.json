The construction was originally funded through £933.15s collected from the Duke's tenants. Originally there were two lions and two griffins at each corner, however these were damaged after a violent thunderstorm and were removed.\nThere are two inscribed tablets on the monument, on both the north and south faces. The inscription on the southern side reads \"LET ALL THE ENDS THOU AIMEST AT BE THY COUNTRY'S, THY GOD'S AND TRUTH'S\", a quote from William Shakespeare's play Henry VIII spoken by the character Cardinal Wolsey. This references an exclamation made by the Duke of Sutherland during the 1820 trial of Queen Caroline. It was added in 2013, replacing a previous inscription which was stolen nearly forty years ago.\nThe tablet on the north face reads \"To the memory of George Granville Leveson Gower, K.G. 1st Duke of Sutherland. The most just and generous of landlords. This monument is erected by the occupiers of his Grace's Shropshire farms as a public testimony that he went down to his grave with the blessings of his tenants on his head and left behind him upon his estates the best inheritance which a gentleman of England can bequeath to his son; men ready to stand by his house, heart and hand.\"\nHistoric England have classified the monument as a Grade II listed building.\nReferences"
