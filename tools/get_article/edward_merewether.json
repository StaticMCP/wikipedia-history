His grandfather was the Serjeant-at-law and Town Clerk of London, Henry Alworth Merewether (1780–1864). His uncle, Edward Christopher Merewether (1820–1893), was a prominent civil servant and businessman in the Colony of New South Wales and for whom the municipality (today a suburb) of Merewether was named. Merewether was educated at Harrow School.\nColonial career\nStraits Settlements\nAfter passing the civil service exam, Merewether was accepted as a cadet in the Straits Settlements Civil Service (SSCC) in 1880 and rose to become Superintendent of the Census in 1891 and Inspector of Prisons in 1893. As Assistant Colonial Secretary and Clerk of Councils from 1897, he acted on two occasions as resident Councillor and Colonial Treasurer in Malacca. In 1901 he was appointed as Resident Minister to the Sultan of Selangor, Alauddin Sulaiman Shah. For his service in the colony he was made a Companion of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George (CMG) in the November 1902 Birthday Honours list.\nIn 1883 he married Honoria Clementina Mary Braddell, the daughter of the first Attorney-General of Singapore, Sir Thomas Braddell.\nMalta\nMerewether was appointed Lieutenant Governor and Chief Secretary to the Government of Malta in May 1902, serving until 1911. He arrived in Malta on 21 August 1902 to take up the position. On the occasion of King Edward VII's visit to the island the following year, he was made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) on 21 April 1903. When the King visited Malta again in April 1907, Merewether was promoted to Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO).\nSierra Leone\nIn March 1911, Merewether was appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Sierra Leone. One of his Private Secretaries was the colonial administrator Paul Shuffrey. In the 1916 New Year Honours, he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George (KCMG). Merewether's term expired in early 1916 and was due to return to England on board the British and African Steamer, SS Appam, but was taken prisoner when the ship was captured by the Imperial German Navy raider  on 15 January 1916. He and his wife were released when the Appam arrived under control of its German prize crew in Norfolk, Virginia, in early February.\nLater life\nMerewether was lastly appointed as Governor of the Leeward Islands, serving from 1916 to 1921.
