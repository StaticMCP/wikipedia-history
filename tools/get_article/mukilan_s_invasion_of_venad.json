      "text": "# Mukilan's invasion of Venad\n\n}}\nMukilan, was a Mughal commander who attacked the southern region of Venad during the reign of Umayamma Rani and Kottayam Kerala Varma (1677–1684). He may have attacked the kingdom during the Malayalam Era 855 (AD 1680). This attack is also called Mughal invasion of South Kerala (Travancore).\nAttack of Venad\nThe ruling power of Venad and the control of temples were under the authority of the Nair feudal lords. A minor dispute arose in the southern Venad region between Nair noble families, known as the Ettuveettil Pillais, and Queen Umayamma Rani. Exploiting this situation, the Mukhal planned a sudden invasion through the southern border of Venad, capturing the southern region of Varkala to Kalkulam (present-day Thiruvananthapuram district).\nBudhapuram in the modern day Kanya Kumari district is a place sanctified by Planet Budha's worship of Goddess Madhu Kaitabha Nasini. The famous Bhaktadasa Perumal Temple there was destroyed by Mukilan.\nSeveral historians, including P. Sankunni Menon and others, recorded that the custodians of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple and the eight feudal Nair families of Travancore, known as the Ettuveettil Pillas, locked the temple and had run away fearing caste pollution. Lakshita Rani went to the Nedumangad palace for safety.\nFor a period, the south of Quilon region (present-day Thiruvananthapuram district) was under the control of a Mughal commander. Although he did not attempt large-scale conversions, this incursion had a significant impact on the culture from the Thovala to Varkala.\nDefeat of Mukilan\nUmayamma Rani requested the help of Kottayam Kerala Varma. He raised a new force with the support of scattered Nair nobles and warriors across Venad, who were armed with swords, lances, bows, arrows and slings. Kerala Varma personally led the Nair army against the Mughal forces, launching a surprise attack at Manacaud, the base of Mughals. Since the Mughals did not have a sufficient force—having scattered their horsemen between Varkala and Thovalai to collect revenue—they were unable to stand their ground and were forced to retreat hastily to Thovalai.\nDuring the conflict, many horsemen were killed. At one point, a stone thrown from a sling disturbed a nest of wasps in a tree where the Mughal commander was fighting. The wasps descended in swarms, stinging the commander on his face, causing him to fall. The fallen chief was soon killed by the archers, leading to the defeat of his army. Kottayam Kerala Varma succeeded in securing around three hundred horses and approximately one hundred prisoners, along with many swords, lances, and other weapons from the defeated forces.\nAftermath\nVenad regained the lands occupied by the Mughal chieftain. Kottayam Kerala Varma organised a battalion of cavalry with the captured horses and brought all the rebellious feudatories under his control. He then acted as the queen's principal counsellor and commander of the troops of Venad. Lakshita Rani elevated him to the position of heir apparent. Subsequently, misunderstandings arose between her and the heir apparent and it is believed that he was assassinated. According to historian Abhinav Madhav, this battle strengthens the Venad Kingdom and led to the strong basement of modern Travancore kingdoms conquests led by Marthanda Varma.\nSee also\n* Battle of Nedumkotta\n* Mysorean invasion of Malabar\n* Malabar rebellion\nReferences"
