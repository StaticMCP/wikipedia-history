In this respect the Bundeswehr did not consider itself to be a successor to either the Reichswehr (1921–1935) of the Weimar Republic or Hitler's Wehrmacht (1935–1946). Neither does it adhere to the traditions of the National People's Army. Its official ethos is based on three major themes:\n*the aims of the military reformers at the beginning of the 19th century such as Scharnhorst, Gneisenau, and Clausewitz\n*the conduct displayed by members of the military resistance against Adolf Hitler, especially the attempt of Claus von Stauffenberg and Henning von Tresckow to assassinate him\n*its own traditions since 1955\nThus, as a mark of having a separate tradition separate from its predecessor armed forces, the Traditional Regulations were enacted in 1965 in order that it would maintain only a few of the military traditions of the former armed services of Germany while at the same time keeping its own in the face of the changing world. The regulations were drafted by no less than Wehrmacht veteran and then Minister of Defense Kai-Uwe von Hassel.\nTraditions permitted to be upheld by the Bundeswehr\n* Flag of Germany\n* Coat of arms of Germany\n* Deutschlandlied (National Anthem)\n* Iron Cross\n* Badge of Honour of the Bundeswehr\n* Ich hatt' einen Kameraden\n* Grand Tattoo Ceremony\n* Ceremonial pledge taking\n* Flag of Europe and Anthem of Europe\nReferences\nSee also\n*Bundeswehr"
