Women's suffrage in Georgia started in earnest with the formation of the Georgia Woman Suffrage Association (GWSA) in 1892. GWSA helped bring the first large women's rights convention to the South in 1895 when the National American Woman's Suffrage Association (NAWSA) held their convention in Atlanta. GWSA was the main source of activism behind women's suffrage until 1913. In that year, several other groups formed including the Georgia Young People's Suffrage Association (GYPSA) and the Georgia Men's League for Woman Suffrage. In 1914, the Georgia Association Opposed to Women's Suffrage (GAOWS) was formed by anti-suffragists. Despite the hard work by suffragists in Georgia, the state continued to reject most efforts to pass equal suffrage. In 1917, Waycross, Georgia allowed women to vote in primary elections and in 1919 Atlanta granted the same. Georgia was the first state to reject the Nineteenth Amendment. Women in Georgia still had to wait to vote statewide after the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified on August 26, 1920. Native American and African American women had to wait even longer to vote. Georgia ratified the Nineteenth Amendment in 1970.\n19th century\n1880s\n1887\n* Georgia passes a \"cumulative\" poll tax, where individuals had to pay all back taxes to the poll in order to vote.\n1890s\n1890\n* Helen Augusta Howard creates a small women's suffrage organization, the first in Georgia, which would later become the Georgia Woman Suffrage Association (GWSA).\n1894\n* The Equal Suffrage League of Atlanta forms as a chapter of GWSA.\n1895\n* January: The National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) holds their annual convention in Atlanta.\n* February 4: Susan B.
