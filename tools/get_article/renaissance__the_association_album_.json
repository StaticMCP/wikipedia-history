This was their last album recorded for the Valiant Records label, and was reissued by Warner Bros. Records after the company acquired Valiant. The album peaked at #34 on the Billboard Top LPs albums chart.\nAlthough it had no chart toppers like the LPs that came before and after it, two singles reached the Billboard Hot 100 chart. \"Pandora's Golden Heebie Jeebies\" reached #35 in late 1966 and \"No Fair at All\" peaked at #51 in early 1967.\nThe single version of \"No Fair at All\" featured overdubbed vocals by Jim Yester, while early pressings of the LP featured the same track with re-recorded vocals and no overdubs. This was replaced on later copies with the single version.\nIn 1967, Warner Bros. absorbed the Valiant label and reissued this album along with the group's first album, And Then...Along Comes The Association.  However, unlike the first album's reissue, all known Warner Bros. copies of Renaissance were issued in original, unaltered album covers in which all Valiant identifications were kept intact.\nTrack listing\nSide one\n#\"I'm the One\" (Russ Giguere)2:35 (lead vocal: Giguere)\n#\"Memories of You\" (Jim Yester)2:15 (lead vocal: Yester)\n#\"All Is Mine\" (Terry Kirkman)3:13 (lead vocal: Kirkman)\n#\"Pandora's Golden Heebie Jeebies\" (Jules Alexander)2:45 (lead vocal: Alexander)\n#\"Angeline\" (Alexander, Kirkman)3:10 (lead vocal: Kirkman)\n#\"Songs in the Wind\" (Ted Bluechel, Jr.)2:35 (lead vocal: Bluechel)\nSide two\n#\"You May Think\" (Alexander, Kirkman)1:45\n#\"Looking Glass\" (Alexander)2:05 (lead vocal: Giguere)\n#\"Come to Me\" (Alexander, Yester)2:15 (lead vocal: Alexander & Yester)\n#\"No Fair at All\" (Yester)2:35 (lead vocal: Yester)\n#\"You Hear Me Call Your Name\" (Alexander, Kirkman)2:18\n#\"Another Time, Another Place\" (Alexander)1:47 (lead vocal: Giguere)\nPersonnel\nAccording to the 2011 deluxe expanded mono edition:\nThe Association\n* Jules Alexander – lead and grunt guitar, koto, lead vocals\n* Ted Bluechel, Jr. – drums (pig skins), door slam, percussive afterthoughts (bells, maracas, cash register), lead vocals\n* Brian Cole – lower tonal concepts and bass honk, background vocals\n* Russ Giguere – guitar, noise and rhythm things, lead vocals\n* Terry Kirkman – recorder, flugelhorn, tambourine, piano, and other percussive embellishments, lead vocals\n* Jim Yester – guitar, piano, harpsichord, bells, lead vocals\nTechnical\n* Jerry Yester – producer\n* Henry Lewy – engineer\n* Peter Whorf Graphics – album design\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Year\n!Chart\n!Position\n|-\n|1967\n|align=\"left\"|US Billboard Top LPs\n|34\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
