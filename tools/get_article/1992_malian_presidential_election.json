They were the first presidential elections in the country to feature more than one candidate following the reintroduction of multi-party democracy after a coup the previous year. The coup had followed a student protest in March 1991 during which troops defending President Moussa Traoré fired and killed numerous protesters. The result was a victory for Alpha Oumar Konaré of the Alliance for Democracy in Mali, who defeated Tiéoulé Mamadou Konaté of the Sudanese Union – African Democratic Rally.\nResults\n|party2=Sudanese Union – African Democratic Rally|votes2=159169|votes2_2=294524\n|cand3=Mountaga Tall|party3=National Congress for Democratic Initiative|votes3=125140\n|cand4=Almamy Sylla|party4=Rally for Democracy and Progress|votes4=103185\n|cand5=Baba Hakib Haidara|party5=Sudanese Union – African Democratic Rally|votes5=76840\n|cand6=Idrisa Traoré|party6=Party for Democracy and Progress|votes6=49397\n|cand7=Amadou Niangadou|party7=Rally for Labour Democracy|votes7=43909\n|cand8=Mamadou Diaby|party8=Party for Unity, Democracy and Progress|votes8=24150\n|cand9=Bamba Diallo|party9=Independent|votes9=21954\n|invalid=30461|invalid2=19389\n|electorate=4780416|electorate2=4780416\n|source=Nohlen et al.\n}}\nReferences"
