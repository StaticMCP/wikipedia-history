A lifeline can only be used once.\n* Audience Poll: If the contestant uses this lifeline, it will result in the host repeating the question to the audience. The studio audience get 10 seconds to answer the question. Audience members use touch pads to designate what they believe the correct answer to be. After the audience have chosen their choices, the results are displayed to the contestant in percentages in bar-graph format and also shown on the monitors screens of the host and contestant, as well as the TV viewers.\n* Phone a Friend: If the contestant uses this lifeline, the contestant is allowed to call one of the three pre-arranged friends, who all have to provide their phone numbers in advance. The host usually starts off by talking to the contestant's friend and introduces him/her to the viewers. After the introduction, the host hands the phone call over to the contestant who then immediately has 30 seconds to ask and hope for a reply from their friend.\n* Fifty-Fifty (50/50) (except season 3): If the contestant uses this lifeline, the host will ask the computer to randomly remove and eliminate two of the \"wrong\" answers. This will leave one right answer and one wrong answer, resulting in a situation of eliminating 50% of the choices as well as having a 50% chance of getting the answer right if the contestant is in a situation of making a guess.\n*Double Dip (for season 3): This lifeline allows the contestant to make two guesses at a question. Getting both answers incorrect results in the contestant's winnings dropping back down to the last milestone achieved. This lifeline differs from others in that once the player has chosen to use this lifeline, he/she must answer the question, and cannot walk away or use any further lifelines on that question.\n*Code Red (from season 3) which gives the opportunity for the contestant's family members to warn the contestant if they feel the answer is wrong.\nRecords\nSanooja Rajan from Nedumangad, Thiruvananthapuram made history by winning the top prize (1,00,00,000/-) in Season 2. This made Ningalkkum Aakaam Kodeeswaran as the second version after KBC to have a top score winner in India. Shyla C. K was the top scorer of Ningalkum Aakaam Kodeeshwaran in Season 1, winning 50 lakh.
