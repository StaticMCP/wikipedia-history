Lead single \"Self-Inflicted\" would be released on May 9, along with the album title being confirmed. The track listing was announced on May 22, although the guest appearances were hidden; one of them would be revealed on June 20 when \"Now and at the Hour of Our Death\", featuring Bones, was released. The album's release date was officially announced on June 28. The duo would appear in a Billboard cover story on July 17.\nCommercial performance\nThy Kingdom Come debuted at number 4 on the Billboard 200 chart for the week of August 16, 2025, with 57,000 album-equivalent units, of which 34,000 were from streaming (equivalent to 45.5 million on-demand streams) and 23,000 of which were from pure album sales, marking Suicideboys' highest-charting album to date.
