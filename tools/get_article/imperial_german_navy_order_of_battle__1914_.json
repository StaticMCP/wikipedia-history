All authority over the navy was vested in the Kaiser, and he was ultimately responsible for all decisions regarding the navy. Under the Kaiser were a number of organisational bodies responsible for various aspects of the navy's administration and operation, each of which was directly responsible to the Kaiser:\n*The Naval Cabinet was a body of the Imperial Household, with responsibility over promotions and appointments, and the drafting and issuing of the Kaiser's orders.\n**Chief of the Naval Cabinet - Admiral Georg von Müller\n*The Imperial Naval Administration was the government department with responsibility for the Navy, which was answerable to the Imperial Chancellor, and was headed by the State Secretary.\n**State Secretary - Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz\n***Deputy State Secretary - Vice-Admiral Eduard von Capelle\nThe departmental heads within the Imperial Naval Administration were:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Nautical Department||Vice-Admiral Max von Grapow\n|-\n|Armaments Department||Vice-Admiral Gerhart Gerdes\n|-\n|Shipyard Department||Vice-Admiral Karl Dick\n|-\n|Naval Construction Department||Vice-Admiral Friedrich Schrader\n|-\n|German Department||Rear-Admiral Friedrich Bodicker\n|-\n|States Department||Vice-Admiral Harald Dähnhardt\n|}\n*The Admiralty Staff was formed in 1899 to replace the Naval High Command, and operated as an organisation intended to gather intelligence and prepare operational plans for presentation to and approval of the Kaiser.\n**Chief of the Imperial Admiralty Staff - Vice-Admiral Hugo von Pohl\n***Deputy Chief of Staff - Rear-Admiral Paul Behncke\n***Head of the Central Bureau - Rear-Admiral Albert Hopman\n*The Inspector-General of the Navy was a post held intermittently, intended to undertake inspection of the navy itself to ensure it was operating at maximum efficiency.

The majority of units of the High Seas Fleet were stationed at Wilhelmshaven for operations in the North Sea. A small force was stationed at Kiel for use in the Baltic, which could be quickly reinforced by North Sea-based units via the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. The High Seas Fleet was under the command of Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl.\nBattle squadrons\n*Fleet Flagship (Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl)\n**\n*1st Battle Squadron (Vice-Admiral Wilhelm von Lans)\n**1st Division\n*** (Flagship)\n***\n***\n***\n**2nd Division (Rear-Admiral Friedrich Gädecke)\n*** (Flagship)\n***\n***\n***\n*2nd Battle Squadron (Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer)\n**3rd Division\n*** (Flagship)\n***\n***\n***\n**4th Division (Kommodore Franz Mauve)\n*** (Flagship)\n***\n***\n***\n*3rd Battle Squadron (Rear-Admiral Felix Funke)\n**5th Division\n***The 5th Division, under Rear-Admiral Carl Schaumann, was formed of battleships of the  class.

These usually consisted of one or more light cruisers, commanding a number of torpedo-boat destroyers and other vessels. To provide heavy support for coastal defence, one of the reserve squadrons of the High Seas Fleet, consisting of eight obsolete coastal defence ships that were of no use as part of the main battle fleet, was assigned to the North Sea coast.\n*6th Battle Squadron (Rear-Admiral Richard Eckermann)\n**11th Division\n*** (Flagship)\n***\n***\n***\n**12th Division (Rear-Admiral Ehler Behring)\n*** (Flagship)\n***\n***\n***\n*Coast Defence Division Ems (Emden)\n** (Leader)\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n*Outpost Half-Flotilla Helgoland (Heligoland)\n** (Leader)\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n*Coast Defence Division Jade/Weser (Wilhelmshaven)\n** (Leader)\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n*Coast Defence Division Elbe (Cuxhaven)\n** (Leader)\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\nBaltic Fleet\n}}\nAlthough part of the High Seas Fleet, the force stationed permanently at Kiel for operations in the Baltic operated with a degree of independence.

Within the newly formed aviation section were two separate commands - the Naval Airship Detachment, based at Nordholz, near Cuxhaven, and the Naval Flying Detachment, which was split between Kiel, Heligoland and Putzig.\n*Naval Airship Detachment\n**Zeppelin L 3\n*Naval Flying Detachment\n**1st Naval Flying Detachment\n***Kiel Detachment\n***Heligoland Detachment\n***Putzig Detachment\nOverseas units\nIn addition to the main body of the Imperial German Navy stationed in home waters, Germany also maintained a number of overseas deployments of ships. The majority of these were usually of one or two cruisers operating independently, with the primary formation of German warships outside German waters being the East Asia Squadron, under the command of Vice-Admiral Maximilian von Spee, which was stationed at Tsingtao. The navy also provided a significant proportion of the garrison at Tsingtao, with approximately 1,200 of the 3,000 strong garrison coming from one of the marine battalions. The other major formation was the Mediterranean Division, commanded by Rear-Admiral Wilhelm Souchon.\n*East Asia Squadron (Vice-Admiral Maximilian von Spee)\n** (Flagship)\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n*Mediterranean Division (Rear-Admiral Wilhelm Souchon)\n** (Flagship) in June 1914}}\n**\n**\n*East and West America station\n**\n**\n*East African station\n**\n**\n*West African station\n**\n*South Sea station\n**\n**\n*Tsingtao Garrison\n**3rd Battalion of Marines\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n}}\n*"
