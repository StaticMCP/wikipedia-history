It was founded by writer/teacher Shirley Windward in 1971. The school currently enrolls 650 students in grades 7 through 12.\nHistory\nIn 1971, two former Paul Revere Middle School teachers, Carl Parsons and Shirley Windward (for whom the school is named), founded the school in order to open up their classes to young people on the west side of Los Angeles.\nShirley's husband, Erv Windward, renovated the studios where they lived into classrooms. Many new students volunteered to help renovate the studios. The school originally had fourteen full-time and part-time teachers who taught 65 students in a small building on Wilshire Boulevard.\nIn 1973, Windward School received its first full five-year WASC accreditation as a college-preparatory institution. As the school outgrew its first facilities the campus moved to 1414 21st Street, Santa Monica in September 1974.\nIn 2012, Windward's co-founder and namesake, Shirley Windward, died at the age of 93. Windward hosts an event, Founders Day, each year to celebrate Shirley Windward.\nCurrently, the head of school is Tom Gilder, who will be retiring in the year of 2024-2025 with Sarah Beck taking on the new position.\nAthletics\nThe school has 44 teams, six full-time coaches, 2 full-time athletic trainers, and 30–35 part-time coaches. Sports facilities at the school include the Lewis Jackson Memorial Sports Center and Foley Field.\nThe school's athletic teams have won California State Championships in several sports. In 2008, the boys varsity teams won the CIF Division VI championships in both soccer and volleyball. In 2011, both the boys' and girls' varsity basketball teams won the CIF Division IV State Championship.  In 2009, the boys' varsity basketball team won the CIF Division V State Championship. In 2012, the boys' varsity volleyball team won the CIF Division III SoCal Regional Championship (the highest level of state competition for boys' volleyball).  The boys' varsity 8-man football team won back-to-back CIF Southern Sectional Championships (also the highest level of state competition) in 2010 and 2011.\nNotable alumni\n* Max Bemis  musician, lead singer of Say Anything\n* Jules Bernard  NBA player\n* Jordin Canada, WNBA basketball player\n* Jakob Dylan  musician, lead singer of The Wallflowers\n* Tyler Heineman  Toronto Blue Jays baseball player\n* Jenny Johnson Jordan  professional volleyball player and Olympian\n* Mason Gooding   actor in Ballers and Booksmart, son of Cuba Gooding Jr\n* Zoe Kazan  actress (matriculated to and graduated from the Marlborough School)\n* Ethan Kleinberg  professor of history and letters at Wesleyan University, editor-in-chief of history and theory and director of Wesleyan University's Center for the Humanities\n* Andrew Luster  heir to Max Factor cosmetics fortune, convicted serial rapist\n* Imani McGee-Stafford  10th pick in the WNBA Draft, has played for multiple WNBA teams\n* Darius Morris  basketball player, drafted out of University of Michigan, has played for several NBA teams\n* Charisma Osborne - WNBA player for the Phoenix Mercury.\n* Shareef O'Neal  UCLA and LSU basketball player, son of NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal\n* Anna Paquin  actress, Best Supporting Actress Oscar-winner for The Piano, star of True Blood\n*Wesley Saunders  basketball player, former Harvard standout and Vanoli Cremona player\n* Jason Schwartzman  actor, star of Rushmore\n* Samantha Shapiro  gymnast, six-year member of U.S. National Team, and three-time U.S. elite national champion\n* Anthony Stover  former UCLA basketball player\n* JuJu Watkins  USC Women's Basketball, transferred to Sierra Canyon High School after her sophomore year\n*Malcolm Washington, filmmaker, a son of actor Denzel Washington.\nDemographics\nAccording to U.S. News & World Report, 67.8 of the student population is white, and 32.2 percent are minorities, including 7.1 percent Black or African American, 3.3 percent Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and 3.1 percent Hispanic/Latino.
