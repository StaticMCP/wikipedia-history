The president is elected by the people. The Parliament (Parlement) has two chambers. The National Assembly (Assemblée Nationale) has 153 members, for a five-year term in single-seat constituencies. The Senate (Sénat) has 66 members, elected for a six-year term by district, local and regional councils. The Republic of Congo is a one party dominant state with the Congolese Labour Party in power. Opposition parties are allowed, but are widely considered to have no real chance of gaining power.\nElections are governed by Congo's election law, most recently modified in 2016.\nLatest elections\nPresidential elections\nParliamentary elections\nSee also\n*Electoral calendar\n*Electoral system\nExternal links\n*[http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/c/congo/ Adam Carr's Election Archive]\n*[http://africanelections.tripod.com/cg.html African Elections Database]"
