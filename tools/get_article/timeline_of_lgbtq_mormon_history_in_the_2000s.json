Packer gave his October General Conference address in which he calls homosexuality a \"temptation which seems nearly overpowering for man to be attracted to man or woman to woman\" that may \"lead to despair, to disease, even to death\".

He stated, \"Can individuals struggling with some same-gender attraction be cured? 'With God nothing should be impossible' (Luke 1:37) ...

Holland and Marlin K. Jensen were interviewed in March with questions about various topics including homosexuality by PBS for a four-hour special called The Mormons. Jensen stated that he did not think the \"church could ever change its position\" on homosexual behavior. \"There's no room within the plan of salvation ... for homosexuality to be accepted\" or for someone to \"be romantically involved with someone of the same gender and ... be living in accord with God's plan.\" He acknowledges that this \"creates a lot of pain\" and asks \"a tremendous amount of them\" since \"they really have no hope\" of \"fall[ing] in love\" in a way \"sanctioned by the church\" which is \"a very difficult thing\". Holland stated that he does not \"anticipate that [the church] would change [its position] on homosexual behavior\" and that \"gay or lesbian inclinations\" will \"not exist post-mortality\". He also used uses the phrase \"struggling with gender identity\" and \"gender confusion\" as synonyms for homosexuality.\n* March – The US Associated Press discussed the first potential excommunication of an LDS Church member for being in a legal same-sex marriage.

Wickman in April to clarify the church's stance on homosexuality. In the interview, Wickman states that the church \"doesn't counsel against\" conversion therapy and that it \"may be appropriate\" for an individual to use clinical therapy to seek to diminish or eliminate homosexual feelings. However, Oaks states they \"can't endorse\" the \"aversive therapies\" recommended in the past to fix \"this affliction\" and they \"don't accept responsibility for those abuses\" suffered by individuals who had experienced this now disavowed therapy method. On same-sex civil unions and domestic partnerships, Oaks states that giving these couples the same government rights given to a man and woman marriage is \"not right\" and \"not appropriate\". He added that a mixed-orientation marriage would be appropriate for a gay member who could \"deal with [homosexual] feelings\" and \"put them in the background\" and felt a \"great attraction\" to someone of the opposite sex. They compared devout homosexual Mormons to those with physical or mental disabilities who will also not be able to marry, and adds that \"same-gender attraction did not exist in the pre-earth life and neither will it exist in the next life.\" As far as family acceptance and inclusion of homosexual children they gave some example conversation lines like, \"don't expect to stay overnight. Don't expect to be a lengthy house guest. Don't expect us to take you out and introduce you to our friends, or to deal with you in a public situation that would imply our approval of your 'partnership'.\" He further stated \"the Lord's way is to love the sinner while condemning the sin\".\n* April – In April apostle Russell M. Nelson signed a letter with other religious leaders urging the US government to pass an amendment banning same-sex marriage stating it would be the \"only measure that will adequately protect marriage\" from \"redefinition\".

This elicited a response from the LDS Church's newsroom which quoted previous leaders' statements that, \"We reach out to assist people with all of the challenges of life. Those who struggle with same-gender attraction are certainly not excluded from the circle of love and fellowship the Church hopes to provide.\"\n* June – BYU fired adjunct professor Jeffrey Nielsen for writing an opinion piece in support of same-sex marriage.\n* September – Prominent gay member Mitch Maybe stated that he had been told by church leaders that he was unworthy to ever take the sacrament, will never work with church youth, and that it is because of people like him that the AIDS pandemic had come and that his sins were bringing punishment to wicked and innocent people.\n* October – Apostle Oaks gave an October General Conference address in which he quotes a man saying \"change is possible\" but do not \"focus on the causes of same-gender attraction\". Oaks then continues explaining if \"faith\", \"prayers\" and \"priesthood\" do not \"heal you from an affliction\" that the \"Atonement will surely give you the strength to bear the burden.\"\n*November – Facing East by Carol Lynn Pearson premiered in Utah.

Hafen addressed the 4th World Congress of Families in Poland on same-sex marriage. Additionally, BYU Law professor Lynn D. Wardle presented and compared his warnings \"tragic consequences\" and \"dangers of legalizing same-sex marriage\" as the warnings of a Hungarian man warning Elie Wiesel's town about the dangers the incoming Nazis posed to the Jewish population there. He also stated that if same-sex marriages were legalized there would be no basis to deny polygamous or incestuous marriages, and a decreased ability to \"protect their children from exposure to gay propaganda.\"\n* July – The church published the booklet \"God Loveth His Children\" addressed to gay members, teaching that through effort, faith, and the Atonement their feelings of same-sex attractions could be overcome in this life or their bodies would be perfected and freed from the challenge of same-gender attractions in the next.\n* September – Church seventy Douglas Callister spoke at an Evergreen conference and urged listeners to battle their challenge of \"same-gender inclinations\" and thoughts through prayer, fasting, and taking the sacrament.\n* October – The church published the article \"Helping Those Who Struggle with Same-Gender Attraction\" by apostle Holland in the October Ensign and Liahona magazines.\n* November – The church's newspaper published anonymous stories of several homosexual Mormon men.

They clarified that to the church tolerance means forgiveness but does not mean \"tolerating transgression\", and noted the existence of temple-worthy members who \"struggle with this great challenge\" of \"same gender attractions\". Additionally, a video of the apostle Bednar answering the questions of some youth was shown off of the church's new official website [https://web.archive.org/web/20081011010124/http://www.preservingmarriage.org/ PreservingMarriage.org].
