(...) The fact that a non-expert user can just download and test the software in a few minutes is something that is a scarce attribute in OS projects and especially in the DES domain. (...) It is the only tool we found that is clearly industry driven (...) and this may have led to more consistent motivation and funding.\"\n\"JaamSim provides everything which is necessary to model typical planning tasks in production and logistics and proves as a real alternative to commercial DES tools.\"\n|-\n| PowerDEVS\n| C++\n| Application\n|  (v933)\n| AFL, GPLv2\n| An integrated tool for hybrid systems modeling and simulation based on the DEVS formalism.\n|-\n| Ptolemy II\n| Java\n| Library\n|  (v10.0.1)\n| BSD\n| A software framework supporting experimentation with actor-oriented design.\n|-\n| SIM.JS\n| JavaScript\n| Library\n|  (v0.26)\n| LGPL\n| SIM.JS is a general-purpose Discrete Event Simulation library written entirely in JavaScript.
