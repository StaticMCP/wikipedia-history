Inspired by 90s classics such as Heroes of Might and Magic III, the game was released in early access on May 10, 2022 for Microsoft Windows and macOS. It allows players to choose from four unique factions, expand their kingdoms, and wage battle by controlling powerful magicians called Wielders. The game was released out of early access on May 20, 2024. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S port released on November 12, 2024, and Android and iOS port released on March 13, 2025. The Nintendo Switch port released on June 17 2025.\nGameplay\nThe game can be described as a turn-based strategy-adventure hybrid. The strategy part of the game involves kingdom management, such as recruiting Wielders and units, constructing and improving buildings, as well as turn-based combat skirmishes. The adventure part is supported by the unique fantasy setting and story, presented through a combination of 2D pixel art style, 3D environments, and volumetric lighting.\nDevelopment\nFrom 2019 to May 2021, Swedish development team Lavapotion had reached over 20,000 requests to sign up for Songs of Conquest's closed alpha. The team has kept a direct line of communication with the public through their Discord server, complementing it with updates on their official website's blog posts. The game's release was originally planned for late 2020 but, likely due to the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, the launch target was postponed to May 10, 2022. The game released in early access on Steam, GOG.com, and Epic Games Store. Its first DLC, named Vanir, was released on 17 December 2024.\nReception\n|EuroG=3/5\n}}\nSongs of Conquest was awarded the title of \"Most Anticipated\" in the \"PC Gaming Show Presentation\" during E3 2021.  Upon release, it received positive reviews on Metacritic and was among the top three best-selling games that were released in 2022 at GOG.com.\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n*"
