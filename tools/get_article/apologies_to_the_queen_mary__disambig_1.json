      "text": "# Apologies to the Queen Mary__disambig_1\n\nApologies to the Queen Mary is the 2005 first full-length album by Canadian indie rock band Wolf Parade.\nBackground\nSongwriting and vocals are split between guitarist Dan Boeckner and keyboardist Spencer Krug.\nAccording to interviews with the band, the album is named after an incident in which the band was removed from the ocean liner Queen Mary for breaking down the door of a ballroom and staging a violent séance.\nThe song \"Dear Sons and Daughters of Hungry Ghosts\" refers to Pretas of Buddhist mythology. The \"Hungry Ghosts\" – beings who, because of actions in their past lives, are always hungry and thirsty, but cannot eat or drink – are used by Krug as a reference to his generation.\nThe songs \"Killing Armies\" and \"Modern World (Original)\" were added to the iTunes Music Store release. Killing Armies is taken from the 2004 EP and Modern World (Original) is from the 2003 EP.\nThe songs \"Fancy Claps\", \"Same Ghost Every Night\", and \"This Heart's On Fire\" were not originally from an EP. All of the other songs, including \"Killing Armies\", came from the three previous EPs, except \"I'll Believe In Anything\". This song appeared on the album ''Snake's Got a Leg'' by Sunset Rubdown (another Spencer Krug project), which was recorded in 2004 and released in July 2005.\nKrug has stated that \"You Are a Runner\" is \"more about who I am in relation to my family, my father. That song is just about, well, I'm not going to get into great detail, but my father is a certain way, and there are days when it's obvious to me that I could turn out that way, and that's not a way I want to be, and it has a certain effect on the people who are close to him, and then I see the people that are close to me getting affected in the same way. That's it on a basic level, I sort of…I don't want to get into it beyond those vague terms. \"Grounds for Divorce\" is just about breaking up. The divorce is symbolic, it's not a real divorce.\"\n| rev1 = AllMusic\n| rev1score =\n| rev2 = Entertainment Weekly\n| rev2score = B+\n| rev3 = The Guardian\n| rev3score =\n| rev4 = The Independent\n| rev4score =\n| rev5 = The Irish Times\n| rev5score =\n| rev6 = Los Angeles Times\n| rev6score =\n| rev7 = NME\n| rev7score = 7/10\n| rev8 = Pitchfork\n| rev8score = 9.2/10\n| rev9 = Rolling Stone\n| rev9score =\n| rev10 = Uncut\n| rev10score =\n}}\nApologies to the Queen Mary is widely considered one of the most influential indie rock albums of the 2000s.
