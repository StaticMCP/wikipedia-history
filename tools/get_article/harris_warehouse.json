The 3-1/2 story stone structure, built in 1855, by Edward Harris, a leading Woonsocket industrialist, rises abruptly from the street opposite the railroad tracks.  The building is distinctive for its rubble stone construction, and its curved facade, designed to match the layout of the railroad spur on which it is located.\nThe warehouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Providence County, Rhode Island\nReferences"
