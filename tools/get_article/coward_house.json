It was a single-story brick structure, with an irregular cross-gable roof configuration that was hipped at its center.  Its east-facing front facade had a shed-roof porch that wrapped around to the south, supported by box columns mounted on brick piers.  Built c. 1915, this vernacular house was one of a modest number from that period to survive in the city.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.  It has been listed as destroyed in the Arkansas Historic Preservation Program database, and was delisted in 2018.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in White County, Arkansas\nReferences"
