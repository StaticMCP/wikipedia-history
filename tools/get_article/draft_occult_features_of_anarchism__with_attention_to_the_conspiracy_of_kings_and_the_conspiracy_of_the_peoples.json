The book is based on Lagalisse's essay of the same name in Essays on Anarchism and Religion: Volume II, Occult Features and illustrates the cosmology of anarchism by exploring the hidden historical bond between classical anarchism and occult thinking, Renaissance magic, and New Age movements, using examples of Freemasonry and Hermetic traditions. In the book, Lagalisse provides an accessible and intersectional study of anarchist social movements, while commenting on the cultural production of conspiracy theories and their societal implications particularly within leftist activism in the modern day.\nIt's foreword was written by by Barbara Ehrenreich. Lagalisse, by exploring these hidden histories, offers a critique of leftist attachments to secular politics. By exploring its roots in religious and occult thinking, Occult Features challenges the assumption that secularism is at the centre of anarchism, with implications for how we view anarchist thought today. Inspired by ethnographic fieldwork within contemporary anarchist movements, her essays challenge anarchist atheism by drawing attention to the \"coevolution of modern masculinity and secularized social movements\", which continues to inform anarchist political understandings even today.\nOccult Features was described by renowned anthropologist and anarchist activist David Graeber as \"The most creative and exciting, and possibly the most important, work to come out on either anarchism or occultism, in many a year.\"\nSummary\nThe book initially contextualizes the author's engagement and activity with anarchism, particularly through her experiences in Mexico in 2006. Lagalisse's involvement in a Zapatista solidarity collective was sparked by protests in Atenco and Oaxaca. Lagalisse explains that watching anarchist Zapatista collective members experience gender bias and uncritical atheism in her native Montréal set the stage for her exploration of the Zapatistas' influence on leftist movements and the rise of anti-capitalist resistance.\nIn the first section of the book, Lagalisse embarks on a historical examination into the \"hidden correspondences between classical anarchism, Renaissance magic, and occult philosophy\", critiquing the perceived opposition between secularism and spirituality within anarchism. Through tracing the influence of religious and mystical thinking on modern science and mathematics, Lagalisse argues that anarchism has never been purely atheistic. She explores this through a number of scientific and rational thinkers such as Réné Descartes, Johannes Kepler, and Nicolaus Copernicus, arguing that they worked in—and were influenced by—cultural traditions of occultist thinkers, challenging the notion that science and mysticism are opposing and contradictory forces.\nLagalisse critiques the tendency among today's leftist activists to discredit religion and spirituality as \"primitive\" and unworthy of modern progressive thought, which she argues marginalizes alternative forms of activism. In particular, those most impacted are activist women of colour and Indigenous women who may situate their struggles in religious terms, as opposed to the language of either politics or economic.\nShe additionally highlights the elitist and gendered nature of knowledge production, noting how witch hunts in early modern history were a disciplinary measure directed at poor women \"to enforce the logic of private property, wage work, and the transformation of women into (re)producers of labor ... organized by the Church and modernizing European State.\nThe book then examines perceptions of conspiracy theories, where Lagalisse argues against the stereotype of conspiracy theorists as uneducated and irrational. Instead, Lagalisse argues for a nuanced understanding of conspiracy theories' political implications. One of the central arguments in this section is that \"people outside of traditional radical circles may express a radical political and social critique through the medium of the conspiracy theory – using the conspiracy theory as a myth for articulating the forces responsible for oppression and injustice.\"\nLagalisse warns that the quick dismissal of conspiracy theories and theorists—and their conflation in the Trump era with the image of racist, poor white people—reflects a certain classism on the part of intellectual elites.\nThroughout the book, Lagalisse critiques the exclusivity of anarchist circles and calls for a more inclusive approach. She challenges readers to reconsider their views on anarchism, conspiracy theories, and knowledge in an age of 'alternative facts'.\n\"Rather than disdaining from a distance the millions of people who fear an Illuminati-controlled \"New World Order,\" perhaps they might engage in substantive argument with them, using some of the facts provided in this work in the process. They might discuss with them how the new neoliberal world order is indeed controlled by conspiring elites, including bankers, yet the bankers are not specifically Jewish or lizards nor associated with the Illuminati.\"\nBackground\nDr. Erica Lagalisse is a research fellow at the LSE International Inequalities Institute under the supervision of Dr. Beverley Skeggs. She is engaged in multi-sited ethnographic research on classed dynamics surrounding \"conspiracy theory\" in left social movement spaces. This project follows Lagalisse's doctoral studies regarding anarchist solidarity campaigns with Indigenous peoples'  movements in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico that originally inspired Occult Features of Anarchism (2019), as well as led to her doctoral ethnography \"Good Politics\": Intersectionality, Property, and the Making of the Anarchist Self (McGill University, 2017). This work is a study of settler \"anarchoindigenism\" that throws into relief the practices of Anglo-American leftists, drawing on anthropological, feminist and critical race theory to show how these activists pre-empt the black feminist challenge of \"intersectionality\" by recuperating its praxis within the logic of neoliberal self-making projects (see e. g. Lagalisse 2022). Over the last few years, Lagalisse has pursued an interest in the political implications of conspiracy theory by thinking through conspiracy theory and the COVID-19 pandemic as part of the Sociological Review's Politics After the Pandemic podcast. Lagalisse has shifted her research beyond the page, giving staged performances that play with ideas of conspiracy, religion, and politics. Lagalisse, based on a review of work published by the academic press, is working on issues related to drug policy, drug legalization, and capitalism.\nLagalisse's work in Occult Features is rooted in her experiences as both political activist and ethnographer within contemporary anarchist social movements.\n...it is explicit that I come to the historical studies at hand methodologically as both an anthropologist and for the purposes of practical intervention within social movements and politics today. It is from being a participant (2000–2005) and later an ethnographer (2005–2015) within contemporary anarchist social movements that I consider it important to unpack the history of \"anarchism\"\nReception\nOccult Features of Anarchism has been reviewed favourably by a number of academic publications.\nBethan Johnson - London School of Economics Review of Books - July 2019\n\"''Occult Features of Anarchism is a rich work that forces readers to confront questions about the nature of anarchism, conspiracy theories and knowledge. In many ways, it leaves us needing to do more than simply consider the arguments on the page. Perhaps this is particularly salient in this age of 'alternative facts' and conspiracy theories, and we are better for taking a little longer to consider what we consume.\"\nChristopher Scott Thompson – A Beautiful Resistance - July 2019\n\"Not many books are truly \"essential reading,\" but if you think of yourself as an anarchist you cannot afford to miss this. This is one critique we need to be talking about.\"\nSeamus Flaherty - Marx and Philosophy - June 2020\n\"It constitutes a valuable contribution to both the growing literature on anarchism and religion and the literature on conspiracy theory.\"\nThe book has found its way onto Tiktok\nTranslations\nThe book has been translated and published in Italian, Anarcoccultismo published by D Editore (2020), in Greek as Apokrufa Stoicheia tou Anarhismou  by Fireband (2021), in French as Anarchisme-Occulte by les éditions du remue-ménage (2022). It is forthcoming in Polish as Okultystyczne Cechy Anarchizmu'' - Polish, Kuriozum Press (forthcoming, 2024)\nReferences"
