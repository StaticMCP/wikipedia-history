The first edition, promoted by Vevo Brasil, took place on 28 November 2017, in São Paulo. From 2018 to 2022, the ceremony was promoted by Music2!, a company founded by Pissarra. In 2023, the ceremony began to be promoted by magazine Billboard Brasil.\nCeremonies\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:99%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5em;\"| #\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:18%;\"| Date\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:26%;\"| Venue\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:27%;\"| City\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20%;\"| Host(s)\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5em;\"| Ref.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 1st\n| 28 November 2017\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Cine Joia\n| rowspan=\"9\" | São Paulo\n| rowspan=\"3\" | Preta Gil\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 2nd\n| 4 December 2018\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 3rd\n| 3 December 2019\n| Audio\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 4th\n| 8 December 2020\n| Ibirapuera Auditorium\n| Preta Gil and Karol Conká\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 5th\n| 16 December 2021\n| B32 Theater\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Preta Gil\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 6th\n| 21 December 2022\n| Audio\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 7th\n| 14 December 2023\n| Sérgio Cardoso Theater\n| Preta Gil and Larissa Luz\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 8th\n| 17 December 2024\n| Renault Theater\n| Luísa Sonza, Karol Conká and Paula Lima\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 9th\n| 17 December 2025\n| BTG Pactual Hall\n|\n|\n|}\nCategories\nVotable categories\nWinners of the following categories are chosen by fan votes.\n* Album\n* Singer\n* DJ\n* Alternative Song\n* Latin-American Song\n* Mainstream Song\n* New Artist\n* Show\n* Music Video\nProfessional categories\nThe winners of the following categories are chosen by the WME Awards ambassadors.\n* Songwriter\n* Music Video Director\n* Music Entrepreneur\n* Instrumentalist\n* Music Journalist\n* Music Producer\n* Radio Presenter\nSpecial awards\n* Artist of the Year: Ana Castela (2024)\nDiscontinued categories\n* Best Song\n* Popular Song\n* Listen to the Girls\n* Musical Live\n* Innovation on the Web\n* Girls for Reels!\nHonorees\n* 2017: Rita Lee and Helena Meirelles\n* 2018: Elza Soares and Dona Ivone Lara\n* 2019: Gal Costa and Beth Carvalho\n* 2020: Alcione and Elis Regina\n* 2021: Sandra de Sá and Cássia Eller\n* 2022: Elza Soares and Margareth Menezes\n* 2023: Dona Onete and Rita Lee\n* 2024: Lia de Itamaracá and Nara Leão\n* 2025: Preta Gil\nSee also\n* Billboard Women in Music\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
