      "text": "# Singapore Short Film Awards\n\nThe Singapore Short Film Awards (SSFA) is an annual event which promotes and recognises excellence in short films in Singapore. It began in 2010 and was jointly organised by The Substation and Objectifs, presented by The Substation's Moving Images. Created by filmmaker Chai Yee Wei, former Programme Manager of The Substation's Moving Images Low Beng Kheng and current Co-Founder of Objectifs Yuni Hadi, the Singapore Short Film Awards highlights quality work done annually in the short film genre in Singapore - by seeking out new talent, reflecting current standards of the short film genre and to bring together both the veterans and the young talents as a community to create a space for networking and sharing.\nThe SSFA programme traditionally includes a week-long schedule of film screenings and presents all Singapore shorts submitted during an open call for entries starting September to November of every year. The competition accepts films that have been made within the two years before the competition, but screened publicly only the year before the competition. There is a submission fee of $10. Screenings for SSFA are held at The Substation Theatre, with the exception of 2015, where screenings were shifted to The Projector. All screenings are entry by donation.\nEach year, an Honorary Award is given to an individual or organisation whom had made significant contributions to the Singapore film community through their work in short films. The Awards Ceremony is held following the end of the week-long schedule of screenings, in attendance of a Guest-of-Honour who will typically present the Honorary Award.\nDuring the first few editions, SSFA was the only platform that recognised excellence in short films in Singapore.\nFor its 6th edition in 2015, The Substation's Moving Images became the sole organiser of the Singapore Short Film Awards.\n1st Singapore Short Film Awards\nThe 1st Singapore Short Film Awards was held from 25–31 January 2010. Out of 133 films submitted, 33 films were selected as nominees in 10 different categories, highlighting technical achievements, as well as performance. There was participation from both experienced professionals and students from schools such as Tisch School for the Arts (Asia) and Nanyang Technological University.\nAll film entries and nominees were screened at The Substation Theatre. The Awards Ceremony was held on 31 January 2010. With close to 100 invited nominees and guests attending, the ceremony's Guest of Honour was filmmaker Eric Khoo and the emcee was Singapore-based actress Yeo Yann Yann.\nThe jury panel comprised Malaysian independent filmmaker Liew Seng Tat, former board member of the Singapore International Film Festival Jasmine Ng, experimental filmmaker Victric Thng, National Museum's Cinematheque programme curator Warren Sin and TODAY newspaper journalist, Mayo Martin.\nThe event was supported by The Shooting Gallery, Infinite Frameworks and Face to Face.\nAward Categories\nThere were not more than 5 nominees per category and there were 10 categories in total.\n(winners in bold)\nBest Director\nSun Koh - Dirty Bitch\nWu Ruojing - Home?\nBasil Mironer - Rare Fish\nKirsten Tan - Cold Noodles\nJmin (Benjamin Tan) - The Girl with The Red Balloons\nBest Animation\nTan Wei Keong - Hush Baby\nIyvone Khoo & Miguel Guzman - The Mothcatcher\nJoo Choon Lin - Come out and Play!\nBest Fiction\nKat Goh - Swimming Lesson\nSun Koh - Dirty Bitch\nBasil Mironer - Rare Fish\nEric Elofson - Master of His Domain\nSulaiman Salamon - Fighting Fit\nBest Documentary\nDana Lam - She Shapes A Nation\nWu Ruojing - Home?\nVicknesh Varan - Special Pass\nGhazi Alqudcy & Ezzam Rahman - Forgotten Merlion\nWan (Idzwan Othman) - Black Friday\nBest Cinematography\nChananun Chotrungroj - Sink\nTay Yuxian - A Hole In The Bed\nIsabel Wong Liliing, Lydia - Home?\nEugene Koh - Blue Date\nLim Teck Siang - Threshold\nBest Editing\nKirsten Tan - Cold Noodles\nJack Haycox - 5 Films in an Anthology of a Film a Month\nDaniel Hidajat - Outing\nAlicia Yang & Danny Lim - My Underwear My World\nChen Junbin - The Girl with The Red Balloons\nBest Script\nMartin Hong - Dreaming Kester\nChristopher Broe - A Perfect Harmony\nLoo Zihan - Threshold\nEric Elofson - Master of His Domain\nBest Art Direction\nJames Page - H The Happy Robot\nEric Lim - Public Phone\nRene Pannevis - Rare Fish\nJacen Tan - Rudra – Hymns from The Blazing Chariot\nEric Lin & Wong Munlai - The Robber\nBest Soundtrack\nDirty Bitch\nThreshold\nNewton\nThe Karma of The Tree Sentinel Who Awakes\nBest Performance (award not given)\nOng Xiu Ping – Madam Chan\nRebecca Dass – Bright\nOliver Mangham – Master of His Domain\nDamus Lim - Brazil\nA statement from the jury members reads, “The jury has enjoyed the performances in the nominated films in this category, but we feel that as the Singapore film community, we can push ourselves much further, and would encourage filmmakers and actors to rise to the occasion.”\nHonorary Award\nFor outstanding contribution to the film community through short films\nRoyston Tan\n2nd Singapore Short Film Awards\nThe 2nd Singapore Short Film Awards was held between 28 February- 6 March 2011.

It involves a sound scape.  Knowing when you need sound or music, when you do not need it, when it is enough is all sound design. All in service of the film. The jury regrets that they did not see this application of sound design in the nominated films”\nThe jury gave a Special Mention for animated film, ‘Contained’, for Sound Design. Jury member Leonard Lai said,\" ‘Contained’ has created a sound scape that the jury felt placed them in the same time and space as the character.

It was organised by SINdie, the only website in Singapore fully dedicated to Singapore independent films and filmmakers, and sponsored by Samuel Seow Law Corporation. The exhibition featured over 100 film posters from about 60 Singapore filmmakers, from the established to the up-and-coming. The exhibition aimed to educate the public about some of the lesser-known filmmakers producing quality work as most Singaporeans were familiar with only a handful of practising filmmakers, and to open up a new branch of film appreciation in Singapore, that of poster art. Visitors could own copies of the various posters for a small contribution to the filmmakers.\n3rd Singapore Short Film Awards\nThe 3rd Singapore Short Film Awards was held from 5–11 March 2012.
