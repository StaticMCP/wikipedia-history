The newspaper is published every Thursday.\nHistory\nAccording to the Beresford Centennial Book (published in 1984), the Beresford Republic was founded by a Mr. Stroud in Elk Point, South Dakota. It was originally published under the title, the Union County Republican.  The first volume of that newspaper still survives in private hands and was put on display at the history exhibit during the celebration of the 125th anniversary of the incorporation of the city of Beresford, South Dakota in July 2009. The first issue of that newspaper was published on August 2, 1894. H. A. Sturges was reported to have owned the newspaper for twenty-seven years.\nAccording to the Beresford Centennial Book, the newspaper was at the \"end of its string\" when it was taken over by Harry Sturges.  Later, he was said to have sold out his interests in the paper to his younger brother, H. A. Sturges.  By the start of the newspaper's fourth volume 1897, it was published in Beresford, South Dakota under the title, Union County Republic before the title of the newspaper was finally changed to the Beresford Republic in 1898.\nDuring the earliest years of the Beresford Republic, a second newspaper was also published in the city of Beresford, South Dakota.  That newspaper was the Beresford News; and, it was eventually merged with the Beresford Republic during the early twentieth century. The combined newspaper was published under the title, the Beresford Republic.\nIn 2023, a decision was made to merge the Beresford Republic with the Alcester Union-Hudsonite.  When the editor of the Alcester Union-Hudsonite retired in the spring of 2023, an  unsuccessful attempt was made to find a new editor; so, the offices of that newspaper were shut down.  The Alcester-Hudson newspaper was then merged with the Beresford newspaper to become the Alcester-Beresford-Hudson Republic on September 7, 2023.\nDuring the school year, the Beresford High School newspaper, the Beresonian, is published as part of the Beresford Republic.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050314152437/http://www.sdnamember.com/search.php?c=Beresford Beresford Republic entry] on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060305184246/http://www.sdnamember.com/ South Dakota Newspaper Association website]"
