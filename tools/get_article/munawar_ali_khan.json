He accompanied his father Bade Ghulam Ali Khan to all his concerts and became an integral part of his father's recital after his father had a paralytic attack in early 1961.\nMunawar Ali Khan had a full-throated voice with open aakar and his style differed from his father's quicksilver style. After his father's death in 1968, he started giving solo concerts.\nMunawar Ali Khan was a top-grade artist at All India Radio. He also joined Bharatiya Kala Kendra in Delhi as a music teacher. He performed in major music festivals in India and abroad.
