Starring Penélope Cruz, Antonio Resines, Neus Asensi, Ana Belén, Javier Cámara, Chino Darín, Loles León, Arturo Ripstein, Jorge Sanz, Rosa Maria Sardà, Santiago Segura, Clive Revill (in his final film role), Cary Elwes and Mandy Patinkin, it was shown in the Berlinale Special section of the 67th Berlin International Film Festival.\nThe film is a sequel to Trueba's 1998 drama The Girl of Your Dreams with Cruz, Resines, Asensi, León, Sanz, Sardà and Segura reprising their roles from the previous film.\nIt was nominated for 5 Goya Awards at the 31st Goya Awards, without winning any, including the nomination for Cruz as Best Actress for the same role for which she had won the Best Actress Award at the 13th Goya Awards, making her the first actress to be nominated twice for the same role in two different films.\nPlot\nNearly twenty years after the events of The Girl of Your Dreams, the story follows Macarena Granada (Penélope Cruz), now a successful Hollywood star in the 1950s. She returns to Francoist Spain to film a big-budget historical epic about Queen Isabella I, financed by an American studio. The production, led by director Gary Jones (Cary Elwes) and producer Jordan Berman (Mandy Patinkin), serves as propaganda promoting Spain's image under the Franco regime.\nBlas is imprisoned by Franco's government due to his past political activities. Determined to rescue him, Macarena and the film crew devise an elaborate plan to break Blas out of jail, using the Hollywood production as cover for their scheme.\nDuring the filming of a ballroom scene at a royal palace the crew executes a prison break. The escape combines elements of comedy and suspense as they outwit the authorities.\nBlas is freed. Macarena reconciles with her past and her Spanish roots, and returns to Hollywood.\nCast\nProduction\nThe film was produced by Fernando Trueba PC and Atresmedia Cine and it had the participation of Movistar+.
