During the agency of Thomas Ivie, Greenhill was sent on a mission to the Raja of Chandragiri which resulted in the issue of a new grant in October/November 1645. By this grant, the Raja confirmed an older grant and ceded the village of Narikamedu to the company.\nTenure as Agent of Madras\nMadras was in the grips of a famine (the first famine since the start of British rule in Madras) when Greenhill became Agent in 1648. In September 1648, Greenhill arranged for rice to shipped aboard the ship Blessing from Persia. These fears were, however, short-lived as Madras had completely recovered from the famine by April 1649.\nGreenhill's tenure as Agent of Madras was marked by a scandal. A certain Mr. Thomas and Elizabeth Bland laid a charge against Greenhill, that the Agent had fathered an illegitimate child on Elizabeth, whom he had compelled to undergo an abortion in the fifth month of her pregnancy. The charge caused damage to Greenhill's reputation. Later, however, during the course of a trial, Elizabeth admitted that the accusation was false, and made in order to profit by the criminal case against Greenhill.\nDeath\nGreenhill died in Madras of excessive drinking on 4 January 1658. His is the oldest English tombstone yet discovered in Madras city.\nReferences"
