This is their first acting collaboration. It aired on KBS2 from December 15, 2010, to February 24, 2011, on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:05 for 24 episodes.\nPlot\nThe drama follows the presidential election process to shed light on the right way of politics, the qualifications of a future Korean president, and also the personal tribulations and ambitions of politicians hidden behind the power struggles. Three months before the presidential nominating convention, Jang Il-joon, from the New Wave Party, declared his candidacy. On that same day, a woman died in a gas explosion in Sam-Chuk. There is little doubt that the accident and the nomination of Jang Il-joon are related. Meanwhile, Yoo Min-ki, a documentary producer, heard of his mother's sudden death and headed for Sam-Chuk. As he cast his mother's ashes in the sea, he thought of his childhood: his father always blurt out that Min-ki was not his own son whenever he was drunk. Min-ki believed that his father was telling the truth because he had seen his mother tearing up and looking at an old photograph of a man often. Min-ki discovered that the photograph was gone when he was cleaning up his mother's belongings. After the funeral, Min-ki returned to Seoul and Jang Il-joon asked Min-ki to work as a PR agent to record the election campaign process. Min-ki asked Il-joon why he was chosen, and Il-joon confessed that Min-ki was his son. The man in the picture Min-ki had seen was Jang Il-joon. However, Min-ki felt something had gone wrong as he realized that the picture had disappeared. Now Min-ki suspects that his mother's death was not an accident and that Jang Il-joon had actually killed her.\nErrors\nEpisode 9\nAt the election in Gangwon-Do the total number of votes cast is 1,530. 6 of these votes are spoiled, so the total number of valid votes is 1,524.
