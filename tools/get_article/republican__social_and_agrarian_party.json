      "text": "# Republican, Social and Agrarian Party\n\nThe Republican, Social and Agrarian Party (, PRAS) was a small agrarian party which lasted from 1936 to 1940.\nIt split from the French Agrarian and Peasant Party (PAPF) which disagreed with the extra-parliamentary turn that the main party had taken by joining the Front paysan. Although PRAS were seen as left wing agrarians on the French political spectrum PRAS was centre-right.  It included PAPF's only deputy in 1932, Louis Guillon, the party's General Secretary Henri Moilhant and a large part of the youth wing, the Jeunesses agraires et paysannes.\nPRAS's failure led the youth wing's organizers to create the Republican Agrarian Union, closely aligned with the Radical Socialist Party.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*"
