This increased the weight by  but improved the tractive effort. They mainly operated in South East Queensland. To accommodate the Co-Co bogies, the unit was lengthened on both ends. The Sarmiento Railway in Argentina operated similarly-lengthened G12s, officially designated the GR12. The South American units differed from the Australian ones in having only the No. 1 end hood lengthened. The first was withdrawn in December 1986.\nThree have been preserved by Queensland Rail's Heritage Division, and are stored at Workshops Rail Museum, North Ipswich:\nStatus table\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
