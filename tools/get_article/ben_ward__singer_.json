Ward helped found Our Haunted Kingdom in 1994 and they evolved into Orange Goblin in 1997. He has been their singer ever since, recording ten studio albums with the band.\nBetween 2007 and 2010, Ward was a member of Ravens Creed. He sang on one of their albums.\nIn 2016 Ward set up a Just Giving campaign for 73 Team Rock employees, who he thought were being unfairly treated by being threatened with redundancy. Ward is also the founder of Route One Booking Agency.\nWard stopped drinking alcohol in 2022 because \"It was spiralling out of control\".\nIn January 2025, it was announced that Orange Goblin will split at the end of that year's tour because \"now is the right time for us to focus our attention on our families and other interests outside the band\", though they may reunite.\nReferences"
