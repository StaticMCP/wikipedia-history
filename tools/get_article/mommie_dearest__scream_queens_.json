Terri Schwartz from IGN gave Mommie Dearest a 7.0 citing that \"Unless there's some big plot turn coming up, this week's episode highlighted how the relatively simple plot isn't enough to sustain this whole series. But overall \"Mommie Dearest\" was one of the show's weaker installments.\" Meryl Gottlieb from The Post Athens gave the episode a positive review; \"“Mommie Dearest” was definitely one of the best episodes of the season. Scream Queens still needs to work on finding the best balance between characters. It’s either heavily saturated with someone or that character isn’t featured at all.\" The A.V. Club's LaToya Ferguson gave the episode C−. She said that \"If you’re at home, trying to solve the mystery, then this episode is a necessary one. It’s nothing much overall, but certainly gets the job done better than last week’s return.\"\nReferences"
