The hall was built by members of the GAR as a memorial to the Union Army veterans of the Civil War. It was one of many such halls built in the country.  It is a contributing property in the Orange Center Historic District.\nHistory\nThe hall was the meeting place of the Gen. Sedgwick GAR Post No. 17, which was one of 210 posts in the Department of Massachusetts. The post was named in memory of Gen. John Sedgwick. The Historic American Buildings Survey funded by the WPA in the 1930s reported that this hall was one of only 20 GAR halls left in Massachusetts, of which only 4 were brick. It was the only brick hall that also had a turret tower. According to the Town of Orange Massachusetts Historical Society, the building was torn down in the early 1990s.\nSee also\n* Grand Army of the Republic Hall (disambiguation)\nGallery\nFile:HABS-GAR-OrangeMA-337247pr.jpg|Side and front elevations\nFile:HABS-GAR-OrangeMA-337253pr.jpg|Interior\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/hh/item/ma1582/ HAER record]"
