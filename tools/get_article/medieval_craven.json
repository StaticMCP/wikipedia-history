While the name of Craven is Brythonic in origin, its usage continued following the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain and the Norman conquest of England. As such, the name was used in the Domesday Book of 1086 with a number of places being described as in Craven that are now found within the modern counties of North Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Lancashire and Cumbria.\nThe former local government district of Craven (a much smaller area entirely within North Yorkshire) was defined in 1974 and abolished in 2023 to be replaced by the unitary authority of North Yorkshire.\nEtymology\nCraven derives from the Middle Welsh \"crav\", which commonly refers to wild garlic but may also have been used for various related plants such as other members of the onions and garlic families. The Crav element is shared with both the Craf river and the town of Abercraf in South Wales.\nHistory\nMedieval Craven extended much further than modern Yorkshire, even today the Church of England's Deanery of South Craven, extends far beyond the borders of the historic county. Although the boundaries of Medieval Craven are the subject of much speculation, it seems that its south-eastern boundary was another British realm, the Kingdom of Elmet.\nWith the conquest of Scandinavian York, the area that is todays Yorkshire was divided into three Ridings (from Old Norse þriðjungr meaning \"a third part\"), administered by its own thing (governing assembly). It has been suggested that the West Riding comprised the upland areas still occupied by Celtic Britons but under Viking control. This unified the Kingdom of Elmet with the areas of Craven that fell within modern Yorkshire. Although the West Riding was created during the Scandinavian period, it continued as an effective unit of administrative until 1974, when it was abolished in the Local Government Act 1972.\nAlternatively, it has also been suggested that numerous areas of Northern England were attached to Yorkshire as an administrative convenience by the compilers of the Domesday Book. Suggesting that the original boundaries of Viking Yorkshire were much smaller and that Craven was a separate polity until the Norman Invasion of England.\nCraven in the Domesday Book\nThe Domesday Book (1086) was essentially an economic census of England, completed during the reign of William the Conqueror, to find out how much each landholder had in arable land and what that land was worth in terms of the taxes they used to pay under Edward the Confessor.\nThe areas of ploughland were counted in carucates: the land a farmer could manage throughout the year with a team of eight oxen. That area varied with the local soil but on average it was 120 acres, (50 hectares).  Some carucates are designated Waste, many of these were devastated and depopulated by the Norman army during the Harrying of the North 1069–70, ca.17 years prior to this survey.\nThe Land of the King in Craven, Domesday Book folio 301v\nMostly in Airedale but also in Lonsdale for that was then considered part of Yorkshire.\n{|\n|+The Land of the King in Craven\n!Location!!Carucates!!Previous!!Current\n|-\n|Cononley||2||Thorkil||King William\n|-\n|Bradleys Both||7||Arnkeld, Thorkil, Gamel||King William\n|-\n|Farnhill||2||Gamel||King William\n|-\n|Kildwick||2 plus 1 church||Arnkeld||King William\n|-\n|Eastburn||2||Gamel Bern||King William\n|-\n|Utley||1||Vilts||King William\n|-\n|Keighley||6||Ulfkeld, Thole, Ravensvartr||King William\n|-\n|Wilsden||3||Gamel Bern||King William\n|-\n|Newsholme||1||Vilts||King William\n|-\n|Laycock||2||Ravensvartr||King William\n|-\n|Sutton-in-Craven||2||Ravenkeld||King William\n|-\n|Melling-with-Wrayton, Hornby-with-Farleton, Wennington||10||Ulf and Orm||King William\n|-\n|Thornton in Lonsdale, Burrow-with-Burrow||6||Orm||King William\n|}\nThe Land of The Clamores of Yorkshire in Craven, Domesday Book folio 380\nThese lands centred on Bolton Abbey were soon after this date transferred to Robert de Romille.

All the rest of Hugh fitzBaldric's land were in East Yorkshire, and he was High Sheriff of Yorkshire 1069–1086.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Location\n! Carucates\n! Previous\n!

Ernies fought at the Battle of Hastings and is named in the Falaise Roll and in the Rolls of Battle Abbey. He settled in England 1068. The Domesday Book lists that he had seventy-two properties in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire. In 1086 he succeeded Hugh fitz Baldric as High Sheriff of Yorkshire. However between 1102 and 1118 his lands were confiscated by King Henry I and given to the House of Romille.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Location\n! Carucates\n! Previous\n!

However some manors listed here as his are described elsewhere in the book as being in Craven. Thornton-in-Craven is quite outspoken in this matter. The omission of a heading could be considered a scribal error or, since the previous sub-section was entitled 'In Craven', the scribe may have decided it unnecessary to repeat the heading.\nHowever Poitou's total lands cannot be used to determine the extent of Craven for he also held lands between the Ribble and the Mersey together with Amounderness.\nAfter 1102 Roger rebelled against the King, so Henry I of England confiscated his lands and gave those in upper Wharfedale and upper Airedale to the House of Romille and those in Ribblesdale and around Gisburn to the House of Percy. Sometime after Domesday Poitou had given Bowland to Robert de Lacy, the Baron of Pontefract. The king allowed him to keep Bowland and expanded his lands with the whole of Blackburnshire and part of Amounderness. These lands formed the basis of the Honour of Clitheroe.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/domesday The Domesday Book] on The National Archives website.
