This skirmish was the first documented use of the wagon fort during the Hussite Wars.\nThe results of this conflict were important in demonstrating Jan Žižka's military competence in the minds of the Hussites. The Prague Hussites would later call for Žižka's assistance in defending their town against the crusading Imperial Army, despite having spurned him by acquiescing to the Royalists' demands after the initial Royalist-Hussite conflict in Prague.\nExternal links\n* \"The Hussite Wars (1419-36)\", Stephen Turnbull, Osprey Publishing ()\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061021170837/http://www.ospreypublishing.com/title_detail.php?ser=MAA&title=S6658&view=spread&view=extract Osprey Hussite Wars book extract]\n* [http://www.warfareeast.co.uk/main/Hussite_Battles_and_Significant_events.htm Hussite Battles and Significant events]"
