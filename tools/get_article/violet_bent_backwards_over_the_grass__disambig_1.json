The poetry collection, featuring over 19 original poems, 10 haikus and photography, including \"13 longer poems\" and several short pieces, is Del Rey's first published work and was released by Simon & Schuster on September 29, 2020.\nIn December 2019, Del Rey announced that she would be releasing a spoken word album to accompany the book, also featuring music by American producer Jack Antonoff, which was set to be released in January 2020. Following a delay due to personal problems, the album was ultimately released on July 28, 2020 through Interscope and Polydor. The cover artwork, a painting of an orange tree by artist Erika Lee Sears, was released in April 2020. The final release dates for the book were announced on July 9, 2020, with the album being released on July 28, 2020, and the hardcover book to follow on September 29, 2020. Half of the proceeds from the book will go to the Navajo Water Project.\nBackground and development\nSince her musical beginnings, Del Rey has expressed how she has been inspired by poetry, with Walt Whitman and Allen Ginsberg being instrumental to her songwriting. Del Rey has written several poems which she used as spoken monologues in her music videos and short films, the most notable being the lengthier, melancholic pieces featured in Ride (2012), and Tropico (2013), in the latter of which she also recited poems from Whitman's Leaves of Grass.\nIn 2018, Del Rey announced her intention to release a book of poetry. She explained how, following some writer's block while beginning work on Norman Fucking Rockwell! (2019) in 2017, she had begun writing poetry.\nShortly afterwards, Del Rey revealed she would be binding the book herself and be selling copies for as little as a dollar. When asked why the book would be so inexpensive, Del Rey replied \"because my thoughts are priceless.\" However, Del Rey's original plans changed when Simon & Schuster acquired the rights and published the book regularly and at a standard price.\nDuring her promotional cycle of Norman Fucking Rockwell!, Del Rey described the book as consisting of \"thirteen long poems\", though she has teased shorter pieces on social media since, including \"Never to Heaven\", \"Happy\", and \"Quiet Waiter-Blue Forever\", among other pieces.\nDel Rey explained her process for writing poetry turned out to be notably different from her process for writing music. She said:\nThe title itself is from a line in one of Del Rey's favourite poems she has written. The full line being:\nRelease\nViolet Bent Backwards over the Grass was released on September 29, 2020, as a 128 page hardcover book. On October 3, 2020, Del Rey hosted a surprise reading and signing of the book at a Barnes & Noble store in Los Angeles. The event was met with controversy due to Del Rey's decision to wear a mesh mask and take pictures in close proximity to her fans during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The event got eventually shut down for not following health regulations. Del Rey responded to the criticism, saying that the mask had a plastic layer sewn into it.\nThe release saw success, with the book landing at number 4 of the New York Times bestseller list.\nSpoken word album\n| recorded     = 2019–2020\n| studio       =\n* Conway Recording Studios (Los Angeles)\n* Electric Lady Studios (New York City)\n* Rough Customer Studios (Brooklyn Heights, New York)\n| genre        = Spoken word\n| length       = 38:50\n| label        =\n* Interscope\n* Polydor\n| producer     =\n* Jack Antonoff\n* Lana Del Rey\n| prev_title   = Norman Fucking Rockwell!\n| prev_year    = 2019\n| next_title   = Chemtrails over the Country Club\n| next_year    = 2021\n| misc         =\n}}\n| rev2 = The Guardian\n| rev2score =\n| rev3 = The Independent\n| rev3score =\n| rev4 = The Quietus\n| rev4score = Positive\n| rev5 = The Line of Best Fit\n| rev5score = 8/10\n}}\nViolet Bent Backwards over the Grass was also released as Del Rey's first spoken word album. It was released through Interscope and Polydor on July 28, 2020, two months before the release of the book. Del Rey selected 14 of the 30 poems that appear in the book to record. In an Instagram livestream Del Rey originally announced the album's release date as January 4, 2020. She expressed her desire to have 50 percent of the profits benefit charities supporting Native American land constancy and protecting indigenous rights in the United States. She added that the album would cost \"about a dollar\" and that the charities would rotate every couple of years. However, the album has never been sold for $1.\nViolet Bent Backwards over the Grass was released exclusively in physical formats, CD and vinyl record. The album's only single, \"LA Who Am I to Love You\", was released on the same day as the album and was made available on all platforms, including a limited time streaming release.\nOn September 22, 2023, the entire album was officially released on Spotify as a podcast.[https://open.spotify.com/show/3DIkc5GRg2bP8cm6UP0N65?si=lBpdeuJwToeeUBow1cdybA]\nAside from Del Rey's own voice, the album features instrumental production from frequent collaborator Jack Antonoff, with whom Del Rey first worked on Norman Fucking Rockwell! and later on both Chemtrails over the Country Club (2021) and ''Did You Know That There's a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd (2023).\nCommercial performance\nThe album peaked at number 19 on Billboard US Top Album Sales chart and number 3 on the US Vinyl Albums chart.\n| all_writing =\n| title1 = LA Who Am I to Love You\n| length1 = 5:20\n| title2 = The Land of 1,000 Fires\n| length2 = 4:04\n| title3 = Violet Bent Backwards over the Grass\n| length3 = 1:04\n| title4 = Past the Bushes Cypress Thriving\n| length4 = 1:54\n| title5 = Salamander\n| length5 = 1:54\n| title6 = Never to Heaven\n| length6 = 2:05\n| title7 = SportCruiser\n| length7 = 6:53\n| title8 = Tessa DiPietro\n| length8 = 2:00\n| title9 = Quiet Waiter Blue Forever\n| length9 = 1:28\n| title10 = What Happened When I Left You\n| length10 = 1:18\n| title11 = Happy\n| length11 = 2:22\n| title12 = My Bedroom Is a Sacred Place Now – There Are Children at the Foot of My Bed\n| length12 = 2:00\n| title13 = Paradise Is Very Fragile\n| length13 = 3:36\n| title14 = Bare Feet on Linoleum\n| length14 = 2:52\n| total_length = 38:50\n}}\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Chart performance for Violet Bent Backwards over the Grass\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Spanish Albums (PROMUSICAE)\n| 59\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Tastemakers (Billboard)\n| 21\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Top Album Sales (Billboard)\n| 19\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Vinyl Albums (Billboard'')\n| 3\n|}\nReferences"
