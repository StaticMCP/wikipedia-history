After being closed for one year, it was reopened as a K-5 charter school. As of the 2011–12 school year, it had expanded into a K-12 school.\nIn 2016 King Valley Charter School asked the Philomath School District (PSD) to increase the number of students in the school, which PSD granted.\nLawsuit\nIn July 2012, Kings Valley Charter School sued the Philomath School District for withholding money set aside for rural funding. PSD then countered by claiming that Kings Valley Charter School violated its charter for contracting its employees through an outside group called People Sustaining Kings Valley (PSKV); this was done to avoid paying pensions into the public employees' retirement system.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
