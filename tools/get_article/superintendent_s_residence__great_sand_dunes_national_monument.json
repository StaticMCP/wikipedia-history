Saunders and Jerome C. Miller of the National Park Service Branch of Plans and Designs. Built the same year by the Works Progress Administration, the house is in the Territorial Revival style, deemed a suitable local adaptation of the National Park Service Rustic style. The national monument is now Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve.  The building is located adjacent to the entrance gate house of the park.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
