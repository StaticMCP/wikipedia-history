Its original interior was designed by Luigi Sturchio.\nIt was originally built as Nabila for Saudi billionaire Adnan Khashoggi (named for his daughter). During Khashoggi's ownership it was one of the largest yachts in the world, but as of March 2023, according to Wikipedia list of largest motor yachts, is ranked 106th and continues to fall down the rankings, due to the trend of larger yachts being built.\nDuring its days as Nabila, it was featured in the James Bond movie Never Say Never Again, in which it was seen as Flying Saucer (translated from Italian Disco Volante in the source novel, Thunderball), the villain's superyacht mobile headquarters. It was also the inspiration for the song \"Khashoggi's Ship\" on The Miracle, the 1989 album by rock band Queen.\nAfter Khashoggi ran into financial problems, he sold the yacht in 1988 to the Sultan of Brunei, who in turn sold it to Donald Trump for $29&nbsp;million. After a refit, Trump renamed it Trump Princess. To dock Trump Princess at the Atlantic City harbor, Trump obtained special dredging permits which instead of taking three years were accomplished in only a couple of months with support from Roger Stone and the lobbying firm Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly.\nThen it was sold in 1991 for $20&nbsp;million to Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal who renamed the yacht Kingdom 5KR. The yacht's latest name stems from the Prince's investment company, Kingdom Holding Company, his lucky number (5), and his children's initials (\"K\" and \"R\").\nThe ship has a beam of , a draught of  and fuel capacity of .\nWhen it was delivered it had five decks, a disco, a cinema with seats for 12, 11 opulent suites, a helipad on top (its funnels are sloped outward to avoid interference with the helicopters), a pool with a water jet on top in front of the heliport, 2 Riva tenders, a crew of 48, a top speed of 20 knots, and cruising speed of 17.5 knots; propulsion was supplied by two  NOHAB Polar engines.\nSee also\n* List of motor yachts by length\n* Saudi royal family.\n* Royal yacht\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
