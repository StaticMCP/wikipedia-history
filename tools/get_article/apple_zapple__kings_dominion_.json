The coaster opened on March 23, 2002.\nIn February 2018, as part of general renovations to the \"Candy Apple Grove\" area, it was announced Ricochet would be renamed Apple Zapple, to better fit the area's theme. The ride reopened under its new name on March 24, 2018.\nRide experience\nThe ride sends a 10-car, 4-person-per-car train along the 1,312.3&nbsp;ft track at 35&nbsp;mph. The track layout consists of several high hairpin switchbacks followed by a pair of steep drops.\nReferences"
