Its original building was converted from the Mountain Park Community Church, who continued to hold services there. It is thought that it was the only school with a baptistery. The present premises were converted from the Career Technical Centre, and it shares the site with the Abbotsford Traditional Middle School.   It is home to the Dr. Marg McDonough Memorial Library.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.atss.ca/ Official site]"
