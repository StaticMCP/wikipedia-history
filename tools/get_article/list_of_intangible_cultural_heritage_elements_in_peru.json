As part of a country's cultural heritage, they include celebrations, festivals, performances, oral traditions, music, and the making of handicrafts. The \"intangible cultural heritage\" is defined by the Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, drafted in 2003 and took effect in 2006. Inscription of new heritage elements on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists is determined by the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, an organisation established by the convention.\nPeru signed the convention on 20 June 2005, ratified it on 10 August 2005 and registered its first two elements on the representative list in 2008. As of 2023, it had registered fourteen elements, of which two are shared with other countries.\nIntangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity\nRepresentative List\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n! style=\"width:25%\" | Name\n! class=\"unsortable\"| Image\n!

In the heart of Amazonia, they have elaborated an oral culture that is particularly rich as regards their understanding of the natural environment. This is demonstrated by the abundance of their vocabulary for the flora and fauna and by their medicinal practices and knowledge of the medicinal plants of the forest. This cultural heritage is expressed through their myths,rituals, artistic practices and language. Their language is the depository of traditional knowledge and of oral tradition and constitutes the memory of the people and the region.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Taquile and its Textile Art\n|\n| 2008\n| 00166\n| \"The island of Taquile located in Lake Titicaca on the Peruvian High Andean Plateau, is known for its textile art, which is produced as an everyday activity by both men and women, regardless of their age, and worn by all community members.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Huaconada, ritual dance of Mito\n|\n| 2010\n| 00390\n| \"Huaconada is a ritual dance performed in the village of Mito in the province of Concepción in the central Peruvian Andes.
