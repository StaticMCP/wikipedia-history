It resulted in a hung parliament: despite receiving fewer votes than the Conservative Party, led by Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, Ramsay MacDonald's Labour Party won the most seats in the House of Commons, with the Liberal Party, led again by former Prime Minister David Lloyd George, regaining some of the ground lost in 1924 and holding the balance of power.\nThe election was often referred to as the \"Flapper Election\", because it was the first in which women aged 21–29 had the right to vote (owing to the Representation of the People Act 1928). Women over 30, with some property qualifications, had been able to vote since the 1918 general election, but the 1929 vote was the first general election with universal suffrage for adults over 21, which was then the age of majority.\nThe election was fought against a background of rising unemployment, with the memory of the 1926 general strike still fresh in voters' minds. By 1929, the Cabinet was being described by many as \"old and exhausted\".\nThe Liberals campaigned on a comprehensive programme of public works under the title \"We Can Conquer Unemployment\". There was anticipation of a potential revival of the Liberal Party after the reunification of Independent Liberals and National Liberals now under Lloyd George's leadership since 1926 and following some victories in a series of recent by-elections after 1926. The incumbent Conservatives campaigned on the theme of \"Safety First\", with Labour campaigning on the theme of \"Labour & the Nation\".\nThis was the first general election to be contested by the newly formed Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru.\nIt stood as the last time when a third party polled more than one-fifth of the popular vote until 1983. The Liberals performed more successfully than at the previous general election in 1924, but could not regain their pre-World War I status as a party of government.\n}}\nVotes summary\n|38.06}}\n|37.12}}\n|23.54}}\n}}\nSeats summary\n|46.67}}\n|42.28}}\n|9.59}}\n}}\nConstituency results\nTransfers of seats\n* All comparisons are with the 1924 election.\n**In some cases, the change is due to the MP's having defected to the gaining party, and then retaining the seat in 1929.
