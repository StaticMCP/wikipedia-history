Incumbent President Gerald Ford eked out a razor-thin victory over the more conservative Ronald Reagan by just 1,587 votes, or 1.5 percentage points. Ford would go on to win the nomination at the contested 1976 Republican convention, but lost to Jimmy Carter in the general election.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Results by County\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Counties\n! colspan=\"2\" |Ford\n! colspan=\"2\" |Reagan\n! colspan=\"2\" |Other\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Total\n|-\n!#\n!%\n!#\n!%\n!#\n!%\n|-\n|Belknap\n|3,001\n|45.3%\n|3,442\n|52.0%\n|178\n|2.7%\n|6,621\n|-\n|Carroll\n|2,834\n|47.7%\n|3,031\n|51.0%\n|82\n|1.4%\n|5,947\n|-\n|Cheshike\n|5,017\n|59.9%\n|3,095\n|37.0%\n|258\n|3.1%\n|8,370\n|-\n|Coos\n|1,745\n|40.6%\n|2,448\n|57.0%\n|101\n|2.4%\n|4,294\n|-\n|Grafton\n|4,910\n|50.4%\n|4,591\n|47.2%\n|233\n|2.4%\n|9,734\n|-\n|Hillsborough\n|11,379\n|43.5%\n|14,114\n|53.9%\n|678\n|2.6%\n|26,171\n|-\n|Merrimack\n|8,111\n|52.8%\n|6,884\n|44.8%\n|378\n|2.5%\n|15,373\n|-\n|Rockingham\n|11,314\n|50.2%\n|10,604\n|47.0%\n|632\n|2.8%\n|22,550\n|-\n|Strafford\n|3,436\n|55.7%\n|3,436\n|41.3%\n|248\n|3.0%\n|8,312\n|-\n|Sullivan\n|1,924\n|51.5%\n|1,924\n|44.7%\n|164\n|3.8%\n|4,305\n|-\n!Total\n!55,156\n!49.4%\n!53,569\n!48.0%\n!2,952\n!2.6%\n!111,677\n|}\nReferences"
