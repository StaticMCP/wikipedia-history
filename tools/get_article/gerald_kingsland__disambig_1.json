Kingsland (8 March 1930 – 20 March 2000) was a journalist, adventurer, and writer, born and raised in Whitchurch, Buckinghamshire, England.\nEarly life\nAfter a stint in the British Army where he fought in combat during the Korean War in 1951, he became a successful journalist and publisher in England, then a wine grower in Italy.\nLucy Irvine\nIn 1980 he set out to become a modern Robinson Crusoe seeking a remote tropical island where he could be self-sufficient together with a female companion. He advertised in Time Out magazine in 1980 for a woman to share life with him on a deserted island. When Kingsland was 49, he met 24-year-old Lucy Irvine. They went to Tuin Island, in the Torres Strait between Australia and Papua New Guinea, uninhabited and lacking a dependable water supply, where they nearly perished, but were saved by Badu Islanders. Kingsland and Irvine wrote separate accounts of their adventure. His book, The Islander, was published in 1984; Irvine's Castaway was published in 1983. The story was also depicted in the film Castaway (1986), in which Kingsland was portrayed by Oliver Reed and Irvine by Amanda Donohoe.\nHe was married to Lucy Irvine in 1981 as a condition for residency on  Tuin Island; they soon separated.\nPersonal life\nHe had five sons and two daughters from five marriages, including to writer Rosemary Kingsland.\nAfter leaving his wife circa 1975, in 1978 Kingsland began the rest of his life hopping from one deserted island to another in the South Pacific, advertising in newspapers and magazines for suitable females to accompany him, but finding life in  the South Pacific to be less than perfect.\nWhilst living in Samoa, Kingsland was diagnosed with bowel cancer, returning to the UK in 2000. He died from a heart attack aged 70 in London. His ashes were scattered in a field on a farm near Bromyard.\nHis last wife, aged 27, and son, his seventh child, remained at their home in Samoa.\nSelected publications\n*From the Whores of Montezuma.
