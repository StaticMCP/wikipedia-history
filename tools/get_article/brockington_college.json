It is a mixed secondary school in Enderby, Leicestershire, England within the district of Blaby. It became an academy on August 1, 2012.\nHistory\nIn 1957, Brockington College was built using an inter-grid prefabricated construction. Four other Leicestershire schools also used this method of construction. Due to the high maintenance costs and physical degradation of the buildings, each of these schools have now been replaced. Brockington College was part of a £19m project from September 2006 to September 2007. As it was a voluntary-aided school, funding was not available directly through the Building Schools for the Future scheme but was shared between HM Government and the Partnership for Church Schools scheme. As such, the Church of England made a significant investment in the college and its local community. A full-sized artificial grass pitch was added in 2009, funded and sponsored by the FA, Next, and a number of other local sponsors.\nThe school converted to academy status in August 2012. Previously a middle school for pupils aged 11 to 14, in September 2015, the school became a Secondary school for ages 11 to 16.\nFeatures of the college\nAdmissions\nBrockington admits children aged between 11 and 16 years old; in recent years, it has drawn a significant number of pupils from beyond its traditional catchment area. The current informal catchment extends more than 8 miles, centred on Enderby and Narborough while also including Croft, Huncote and Thurlaston — but reaching to Stoney Stanton, Whetstone and Blaby, Braunstone, and Leicester Forest East, as families have elected to apply to Brockington, rather than their local secondary schools.\nSpiritual reflection\nThe school speaks of its \"uniquely Christian ethos\" and has been assessed as an \"Outstanding\" school as part of its Section 48 inspection. Children and staff from a number of faith backgrounds are part of the Brockington community and all beliefs are respected. Local clergy host assemblies once a fortnight for each year and there is a strong Spiritual Reflection programme designed to prompt reflection among all, irrespective of their faith. There is also a Christmas service held at the local church.\nHouse system\nUp until 2020, there were four Houses within the school: Plantagenet, Stuart, Tudor, and Windsor. Pupils frequently participated in extracurricular and enrichment activities representing their House.\nSchool values\nThe school has eight key values ('Compassion', 'Forgiveness', 'Justice', 'Koinonia', 'Perseverance', 'Wisdom', 'Learning' and 'Respect') which inform the school's assembly programme and Collective Worship Programme. These values are the cornerstones for teaching within the school.\nFacilities\nThe college offers bookable rooms and facilities for use by outside groups. Regular sporting events are hosted using the College's facilities, including the 3G Artificial Grass Football Pitch (AGP), main indoor sports hall, and Multi Use Games Area (MUGA).\nAll classrooms are equipped with LED projectors and have interactive whiteboards. There are currently five ICT rooms located on-site.\nNotable former pupils\n* Richard Armitage, actor.\n* Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth, murder and rape victims whose rapist and killer was the first convicted using DNA evidence.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.brockington.leics.sch.uk College website]\n* [http://www.edubase.gov.uk/EstablishmentView.aspx?EstablishmentID=20284 EduBase]"
