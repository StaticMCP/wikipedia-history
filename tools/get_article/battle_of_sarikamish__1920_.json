After the Sarikamish war signed the Armistice of Mudros, the Turks launched an invasion of Armenia, keeping the Armenians away from the Sarikamis front. Under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, Kazim He directed Karabekir there, and as a result of a successful war, the Turks annexed Kars and other provinces to their territory. The Armenian soldiers who remained there were either killed or exiled. No exchange was found. Estimated Armenian soldier deaths were 1000.\nBackground\nIn late September 1920 the Armenians initiated several attacks against Turkish forces in the area. On 24 September an Armenian force of at least 800 men, supported with nine machine guns, began an unsuccessful attack against the weak Turkish entrenchments in Bardız Şenkaya. The attack was repulsed and cost them 47 killed and several wounded. Additionally, two machine guns and ammunition were captured by the Turks. The Turks suffered eight killed and ten wounded during the attack. These attacks gave the Turkish commanders an insight into Armenian military capabilities.\nActive Stage\nThe Turkish forces quickly defeated the Armenian troops in the town. The remaining Armenian forces retreated to the Kötek-Selim-Göle line and stayed there until 30 September.\nResults\nBy September 29, Karabekir's forces had retaken Sarıkamış and the following day Kağızman.\nReferences"
