They play in the North East Premier division of the Rugby League Conference.\nHistory\nA great deal of schools development had taken place in 2003-04 in primary schools in Jarrow and Hebburn and George Taylor decided to establish a club based out of Luke's Lane. Following some consultation with the local rugby union side, Jarrovians, Jarrow Junior Vikings became active at the under-12 age group.\nSoon after there was enough interest to form an adult section with a number of players coming forward from Westoe RFC and Student Rugby League set-ups in the North East the side were soon training and joined the North East Division of the Rugby League Conference for 2004. The club's reputation soon grew and their interaction in the wider community earned them the National title as Best New Club for 2004, for which they received an award from the Rugby Football League.\nIn 2005, the Conference developed a new tier of Premier Divisions and Jarrow Vikings stepped up to the newly created North Premier Division. In 2006, they played in the North Division and a further 2007 reshuffle of the regional divisions saw Jarrow rejoin the North East Division.\nJarrow won their first silverware in 2009 when they took the North East Division title. They beat Scottish champions Edinburgh Eagles and made it to the Regional Grand Final but were beaten by Northampton Casuals.\nJarrow joined the newly formed North East Premier in 2011.\nJuniors\nJarrow's junior teams take part in the North East Junior League.\nClub honours\n* RLC North East Division winners: 2009, 2010\n* Premier League winners 2011, 2012, 2014, 2016\n* North East Cup winners: 2012, 2015\nExternal links\n* [http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/jarrowvikingsrlfc/ Official website]"
