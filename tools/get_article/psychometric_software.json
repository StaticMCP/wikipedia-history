Although some psychometric analyses can be performed using general statistical software such as SPSS, most require specialized tools designed specifically for psychometric purposes.\nSources of Free Software\nNumerous free psychometric tools have been developed by researchers and educators. Notable websites and resources offering such software include::\n* CASMA at the University of Iowa, USA: Hosts the GENOVA Suite of computer programs for generalizability theory.\n* REMP at the University of Massachusetts, USA: Provides item response theory software, with the last update in 2008.\n* Software from Brad Hanson: Offers C++ libraries for item response theory (IRT).\n* Software from John Uebersax: Features latent class analysis software.\n* Software from J.

CTT functions include:\n* Percentage correct\n* Observed scores for each item category\n* Item-total correlations\n* Item-rest correlations (with user-specified confidence intervals)\n* Item-rest point biserial/polyserial correlations\n* Cronbach’s alpha\n* Alpha-if-deleted\n* Full Pearson correlation matrix (item matrix) with levels of statistical significance\nAutopsych also performs several Rasch-based functions, including:\n* Basic Rasch many-facets analysis for differential item functioning (DIF)\n* Fixed item equating for dichotomous item-response matrices\n* One-way ANOVA\n* Inter-rater reliability analysis\nCITAS\nCITAS (Classical Item and Test Analysis Spreadsheet) is a free Excel workbook designed to provide scoring and statistical analysis of classroom tests. Users can type or paste item responses (ABCD) and keys into the workbook, and the output is automatically populated. Unlike some other programs, CITAS does not require any 'running' or experience in psychometric analysis, making it accessible to teachers and professors.\njMetrik\njMetrik is free and open-source software for conducting comprehensive psychometric analysis, developed by J. Patrick Meyer at the University of Virginia. It includes methods for:\n* Classical item analysis\n* Differential item functioning (DIF) analysis\n* Confirmatory factor analysis\n* Item response theory (IRT)\n* IRT equating\n* Nonparametric item response theory\njMetrik's item analysis includes proportion, point biserial, and biserial statistics for all response options.

IRT methods include the Rasch, partial credit, and rating scale models, with equating methods like mean/mean, mean/sigma, Haebara, and Stocking-Lord procedures.\njMetrik also features:\n* IRT illustrator\n* Basic descriptive statistics\n* Graphics facility for bar charts, pie charts, histograms, kernel density estimates, and line plots\njMetrik is a pure Java application that runs on 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems, requires Java 1.6 on the host computer.\nIteman\nIteman is a commercial Windows program specifically designed for classical test analysis. It produces tech reports in Microsoft Word with graphics, narratives, and embedded tables. Iteman calculates the proportion and point biserial of each item, high/low subgroup proportions, and detailed item performance graphics.

Various functions have been proposed to model this relationship, and the different calibration packages reflect this. Several software packages have been developed for additional analysis such as equating; they are listed in the next section.\nAutopsych\nAn open-source software program, Autopsych, is used for performing uni-dimensional Rasch analysis. The app can handle both dichotomous and polytomous data via the application of master’s partial credit model. The app adopts marginal maximum likelihood estimation and leverages off a total 31 open-source R packages (including TAM, psych, knitr, etc.). Users upload item-response matrices (.csv files), customize settings for Rasch analysis, and the app automatically generates PDF with embedded narration for methodology and results. Excel files include outputs for all analyses performed including plausible values. Users can also perform basic many-facets Rasch analysis for an examination of item DIF, fixed anchor equating for two dichotomous matrices, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) of EAP theta estimates for examining the effect of group effects, and inter-rater reliability analysis for the examination of examiner consistency. A full exposition of the web app is provided in the journal, PLOS ONE SCIENCE.\nBILOG-MG\nBILOG-MG is a software program for IRT analysis of dichotomous (correct/incorrect) data, including fit and differential item functioning.
