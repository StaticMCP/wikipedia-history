When Muller Road intersects with Zillmere Road, it forms a corner near Zillmere Water Holes in the south and follow the creek to its connection with Nundah Creek and use Nundah Creek as a border back up to the Cabbage Tree Creek estuary completing the border.\nThe Boondall Wetlands are located in the east of the suburb.

The Turrbal people of north Brisbane were the original owners of the country around the Boondall Wetlands.\nSt Joseph's Nudgee College was established in January 1891 by the Christian Brothers, a Roman Catholic order. The site for the college was chosen by Ambrose Treacy after the Archbishop of Brisbane Robert Dunne asked that the Brothers establish a boarding school for Catholic boys from rural areas.\nIn January 1916, the Zillmere congregation of the Church of Christ commenced outreach in the Nudgee College area, erecting a bush shelter. On 23 December 1916, a chapel was built in a day by volunteers. In 1957, a new church building was erected and the old church building was used as a hall.\nBoondall State School opened on 6 April 1925.\nSt Matthew's Anglican church at 178 Lyndhurst Road () was dedicated on 21 September 1974 by Archbishop Arnott. It closed circa 1988. The property was purchased by Turbert Bhagwan Ram Dutta and his mother Gayatri Dutta with a view to using it as a Hindu temple. The local Hindu community supported the plan and the Hindu Society of Queensland was incorporated on 22 January 1992 and took over the ownership of the property. The Gayatri Mandir was officially opened and blessed on Sunday 26 January 1992.\nIn 1975, Boondall Methodist Church was at 2218 Sandgate Road (approx ), becoming Boondall Uniting Church after the amalgamation of the Methodist Church into the Uniting Church in Australia in 1977.

Their new Sandgate Uniting Church in Deagon was opened in Sunday 20 November 1994.\nThe Brisbane Entertainment Centre was built by the Brisbane City Council and opened on Thursday 20 February 1986 with the first event being ice dancers Torvill and Dean.
