For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3. c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\n7 & 8 Geo. 6\nContinuing the ninth session of the 37th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 24 November 1943 until 28 November 1944.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 7 & 8 G. 6.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n-\n|\n|  and to provide for the laying before the Commons House of Parliament of annual returns of certificates issued under that Act.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n-\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and, in connection therewith, to Amend certain other enactments.|note4= }}\n|\n|  as to the qualifying date for an election and the qualifications required for registration in the civilian residence and business premises registers, and to provide for matters consequential thereon.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  relating to Milk and Dairies Regulations and other matters connected therewith.|note4= }}\n-\n|  }}\n| or the Butler Act|public|31|03-08-1944|maintained=y|repealed=y|An Act to reform the law relating to education in England and Wales.|note4= }}\n|  and 1938, and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.|note4= }}\n|  as respects new housing accommodation provided by local authorities before the first day of October, nineteen hundred and forty-seven; and to suspend temporarily the holding of local inquiries in respect of certain compulsory purchase orders.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  as soon as may be after they were made.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  in certain respects.|note4= }}\n|  as respects new housing accommodation provided by local authorities before the first day of October, nineteen hundred and forty-seven; to suspend temporarily the holding of local inquiries in respect of certain compulsory purchase orders; to provide for grants and advances to the housing association approved for the purposes of section two of the aforesaid Act; and to make provision with regard to the superannuation of the employees of the said association, and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.|note4= }}\n-\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n}}\nLocal acts\nin its application to the West Riding of the county of York.|note4= }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  relating to the Edinburgh Merchant Company Endowments.|po1=Edinburgh Merchant Company Endowments (Amendment) Order 1944|Provisional Order to amend the provisions of the Edinburgh Merchant Company Endowment Order 1909 in so far as relating to Part III thereof—Superannuation Fund.}}\n|\n|  and certain Orders.}}\n|  }}\n|  relating to the North West Midlands Joint Electricity Authority.|po1=North West Midlands Joint Electricity Authority (Increase of Borrowing Powers) Order 1944|Provisional Order made by the Electricity Commissioners and confirmed by the Minister of Fuel and Power under the Electricity (Supply) Acts 1882 to 1936 for amending the North West Midlands Joint Electricity Authority (Increase of Borrowing Powers) Order 1939 as amended by the North West Midlands Electricity District (Meaford Generating Station) Special Order 1941.}}\n|  maintained by the Company and for other purposes.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n}}\n8 & 9 Geo. 6\nThe tenth session of the 37th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 29 November 1944 until 15 June 1945.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 8 & 9 G. 6.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n}}\nLocal acts\n|\n}}\nSources\n*  |date=1944}}\nSee also\n*List of acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom\nReferences"
