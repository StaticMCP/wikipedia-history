A new system for new private cars was introduced on July 1, 2008, where the tax rates are based on the carbon dioxide emissions of the car while in operation. Prior to this, tax rates are assessed on engine displacement; this includes used imports first registered in their original country of sale before July 2008. Motorcycles are all taxed the same regardless of engine displacement, with a special rate for electrically powered cycles. For goods vehicles, commercial vehicles, and public service vehicles, it is based on weight or is a standardised fee. For taxation of cars with Wankel engines under the old size-based system, the actual engine displacement is multiplied by 1.5, so for example, a Mazda RX-8 with a 1.3-litre rotary engine is taxed as a 1.8-litre engined vehicle.\nMotor tax can be purchased for a duration of three, six, or twelve months for some classes of vehicles. Valid vehicle insurance is required to pay for motor tax. Once tax is paid, the vehicle owner receives a motor tax disc, which is required by law to be displayed on the vehicle (usually on the front windscreen where available, along with insurance and NCT discs where required). Failure to display a tax disc can result in a fine, and failure to pay for motor tax can result in further fines or prosecution.\nMotor tax can be refunded if the car has not been in use in public places under certain circumstances, for example, if the vehicle has been scrapped, permanently exported from the country, stolen and not recovered, or the owner has been unable to use the vehicle for certain reasons.\nRates\n, annual motor tax rates for private cars on the emissions-based system range from €120 (0 g/km CO2) to €2,350 (more than 225 g/km). Tax for motorcycles varies from €35 to €88.\nVehicles 30 years old or more qualify for \"vintage\" motor tax status - a special low rate of €26 per year for motorcycles or €56 per year for all other vehicles.\nMotor tax can be paid in annual, half-year and quarterly instalments. The tax can be paid online or in person at Motor Tax Offices.\nExemptions\nThere are a number of exempt vehicles:\n*State-owned vehicles (these still carry tax discs with a rate of €0.00 printed on them), for example Garda vehicles and CIÉ buses.\n*Diplomatic vehicles.\n*Vehicles are exempted under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994 (S.I.
