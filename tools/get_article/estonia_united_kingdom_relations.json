The United Kingdom gave full support to Estonia's applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.\nHistory\nKristen Michal at a JEF summit in Tallinn, December 2024.]]\nThe relationship between the UK and Estonia has its beginning during the Estonian War of Independence, when the UK sent a Royal Navy detachment led by Admiral E.A. Sinclair to defend Estonia's shores. The British seamen who gave their lives defending Estonia's freedom during the conflict were laid to rest in the Tallinn Military Cemetery.\nBefore the Soviet occupation in 1940, relations between the UK and Estonia were close. The UK was a major market for Estonian produce, more than 30% of Estonia's exports went to the UK. The United Kingdom recognised Estonia's annexation in 1940. Estonia continued diplomatic relations with the UK in exile and later claimed state continuity.\nThe UK affirmed the restoration of the Estonian independence on 27 August 1991. Diplomatic relations between the two countries were re-established on 5 September 1991, and the British Embassy opened in Tallinn in the same year. Estonia's relations with the UK are close. Britain provided both political and practical support to Estonia's efforts to join the EU and NATO.\nBoth Estonia and the United Kingdom provided contributions to the NATO mission in Afghanistan.\nIn October 2016 it was announced that 800 British troops would be stationed at Tapa Army Base in Estonia.\nCultural relations\nbuilding in Tallinn]]\nThe British Council has a representation in Tallinn. There is an active programme of English language teaching support, cultural exchange and scholarships for Estonian students to study in the UK.\nMigration\nAn estimated 10,000-15,000 Estonian citizens live in the UK, about 3,000-5,000 of them in London. The most active communities are in London, Bradford and Leicester. There is a total of 13 Estonian societies in the UK, the oldest being the London Estonian Society established in 1921.\nTourism\nTallinn and Estonia's reputation as a tourist destination has grown in Great Britain over the past few years. Estonia's accession to the EU in 2004 gave a significant boost to reciprocal travel – that year 30% and the following year (2005) 60% more (62.3 thousand) British tourists were accommodated in Estonia than in previous years. In 2012 nearly 55 thousand British tourists used Estonian accommodation establishments. Tallinn has also become one of the most popular destinations among Baltic cruise ports. In 2012 over 75 000 British cruise tourists visited Estonia.\nReports of British tourists excessively drinking in Tallinn have received media coverage in the UK.\nEconomic relations\nThe UK is in 9th place among Estonia's trade partners, making up 3% of Estonia's total trade turnover.

As a foreign investor, the UK's interest in Estonia has been fairly great – it is the source of 2% of all foreign direct investments made in Estonia.\nDiplomacy\nmeeting Estonian President, Toomas Ilves in London, August 2012.]]\nLauri Bambus was appointed Estonian ambassador to the United Kingdom in August 2014.
