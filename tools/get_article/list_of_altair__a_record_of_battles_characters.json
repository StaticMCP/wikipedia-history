Mahmut hails from the Tuğril tribe, a village of expert falconers that was destroyed during the war with the Balt-Rhein Empire twelve years before the series. After the death of his mother and the destruction of his home, Mahmut pushes himself to pass the army entrance test at the age of twelve, and seeks perpetual peace for his country. At the beginning of the series, Mahmut has been Pasha only for a short time and lacks the maturity to understand his position. Initially idealistic and naïve, Mahmut's single-minded goal to protect his country, as well as his aloofness, has made him inconsiderate and reckless. After acting on his own to stop the Hisar Rebellion, Mahmut is temporarily demoted from Pasha and begins traveling around West Rumeliana to gain more experience outside of Türkiye. After resolving the civil war, Mahmut regains his Pasha rank and is appointed to handle foreign military affairs. Mahmut's exploits against the empire continue to grant him more prestige, and he is eventually appointed second-in-command of Zağanos's Imperial Invasion army by the Divan, leading the defense of Türkiye from the empire's advances, to the point of his allies start calling him \"Star of Hope\". For his efforts in the war, Mahmut is awarded rule over the Mızrak Province, determined to establish a trade network between Türkiye and their neighboring countries in the east.\n:Over the course of the series, Mahmut becomes more mature and aware of the complicated politics between nations, while accepting that fighting is unavoidable sometimes, but still tries to minimize bloodshed. Mahmut's honesty, integrity, and cleverness earns the respect of those around him. Aside from possessing a high intellect and a knack for strategies, he is self-taught in Tuğril tribe falconer techniques and is able to direct his beloved tame golden eagle, Iskender, to deadly effect. Due to his youth, people outside of Greater Türkiye tend to underestimate Mahmut, allowing him to catch opponents by surprise with his skills as a fighter and strategist. Mahmut is often complimented for his good looks and enjoys writing poetry in his free time. He tends to be naïve and easily flustered around women when they interact with him in a unprofessional manner and is often teased by his friends for this \"weakness\".\n;\n:\n:Kyros is the 19-year-old (17 at the start of the series) son of the former caesar of Phoiníkē, Apollodorus, with whom he has a very estranged relationship. Kyros has a rebellious nature and is reluctant to follow in his father's footsteps, which entices him to become the Phoiníkē spy for Süleyman. After the fall of his home, Kyros becomes Mahmut's traveling companion and joins him in his efforts to stop the Balt-Rhein Empire, hoping to one day to reclaim his homeland. In comparison to the more naïve and polite Mahmut, Kyros is more street-wise, sarcastic, and temperamental, though he is able to conduct himself in formal matters. Since Venedik failed to aid Phoiníkē, Kyros holds a grudge against them and was distrustful of Abiriga as a result, but has come to respect him and be more friendly towards him as they travel together. Being a Phoiníkē noble and a citizen of a harbor town, Kyros is well-educated in sea warfare and is knowledgeable about different parts of the world. Although he does not battle often, Kyros is a capable fighter and owns a galley ship back in Phoiníkē with a crew made up of his childhood friends. He continues to put his espionage skills to use as he travels with Mahmut, as he is usually tasked to handle things outside of battle and acts as a liaison for Türkiye with Süleyman as the Great Rumeliana War escalates.\n;\n:\n:A 30-year-old (28 at the start of the series) former slave from Tharros, Abiriga is the first mate of Captain Silvestro Brega of the Venedik fleet and Brega's adopted son. When he was thirteen, Abiriga was sold off by his biological parents, but was able to escape and then saved by Brega, who paid for his freedom and took him in. After testing Mahmut's worth and being \"purchased\" for his services, he is assigned to Mahmut to be his companion and to spy on Türkiye's activities for Venedik. Although Mahmut treats him as an equal, Abiriga respectfully addresses Mahmut as \"Padrone\" and diligently carries out his orders. Despite joining Mahmut out of duty, Abiriga comes to respect him greatly and proves to be a valuable ally, even delaying his reports to Venedik in order to see the end results of Mahmut's plans. Abiriga possesses high-level agility and very few people can match him in battle. He knows many forms of combat and weaponry, carrying numerous weapons that are hidden under his long coat, but prefers to use a long blowpipe as his default weapon. Having trained and groomed himself to serve Brega to the best of his ability, Abiriga is mature, level-headed, courteous, and usually sports a placid smile on his face.\nGreater Türkiye\nGreater Türkiye is a federation made up of five stratocracies — Türkiye, Mızrak, Balta, Biçki, and Kiliç — founded 75 years before the series. While the other four are ruled by a sultan, the Türkiye stratocracy is the largest of the five, being the dominating power of Greater Türkiye and is ruled by the Divan. Türkiye stratocracy is divided into thirteen provinces governed by a Vizier and its capital city is Altın. Greater Türkiye is very wealthy and the Turks are well known for their equestrian skills. Among the Tripartite Military Alliance and other anti-imperialists nations, Türkiye contributes the most to the war efforts against Balt-Rhein and is the leading force against them.\nTürkiye Stratocracy\n;ザガノス|Zeheru Zaganosu Pasha}}\n:\n:At 28-year-old (26 at the start of the series), Zağanos is the second youngest of the Divan, attaining the rank of Pasha when he was nineteen, and one of the 13 Pashas who is a Vizier. He is the governor of the 1st Province of the Türkiye stratocracy and has forged a spy network throughout the continent. Calculating and ambitious, Zağanos is part of the war faction of the Divan and wishes to stop Balt-Rhein's expansion war at all costs. He has no qualms in making ruthless decisions to further his goals, and seeks to reorganize the Anti-Imperial Alliance to a hegemony dominated by Türkiye. Despite clashing with Mahmut occasionally, Zağanos develops a level of respect for him, though he is also willing to take advantage of Mahmut when it suits him. He is known as the \"Poison General\" due to his interest in botany and has a large collection of poisons. It is later revealed that Zağanos is a former citizen of the Balt-Rhein Empire and the son of the former Hermann, Marquis Camus, and his real name is \"Astolphe\". He holds a deep grudge against the empire for ruining his family and uses his in-depth knowledge of the empire to gain the upper hand in the war against them. After the war, Zağanos is awarded rule over the recently-annexed Balt-Rhein territories, becoming the de-facto ruler of his former country of birth.\n;スレイマン|Kara Kanetto Sureiman}}\n:\n:A 35-year-old (33 at the start of the series) man, Süleyman is a spymaster known as the Göz Kulak Başkan (\"chief of eyes and ears\") of the Türkiye spy network for Zağanos and constantly travels around the world to maintain its efficiency. Like Mahmut, he is a survivor from the Tuğril tribe, having been away from the village during its destruction. Süleyman is a former assistant of Giovanni di Orsani, but left his service once he heard of the Tuğril tribe massacre. Devastated over his family's death, Süleyman wandered aimlessly over Türkiye until he met a fourteen-year-old Zağanos and took up his offer to forge a spy network five years later. Süleyman is typically easy-going and friendly, allowing him to befriend others and help build the spy network. After meeting Mahmut for the first time, Süleyman becomes a mentor-like figure to him and shares the same desire to maintain peace for Türkiye. As a falconer, he owns a golden eagle named Caterina and is able to direct her to deadly effect in combat.\n;カリル|Shehiru Kariru Pasha}}\n:\n:At 70-year-old (68 at the start of the series), Halil is the eldest member of the Divan, governor of the 7th Province, and one of the 13 Pashas that hold the rank of Vizier. Halil is the most influential Pasha among the pacifist faction in the Divan. A wise and peaceful man who specializes in Urban design, Halil devotes himself to war restorations after the first war with Balt-Rhein and his jovial yet grounded personality makes him well-respected and well-loved by all. He is Mahmut's adopted father and mentor, though he never shields Mahmut from the consequences of his actions and encourages him to learn from his mistakes. During the second war against Balt-Rhein, Haili is appointed general of the expedition army, but is later killed in battle against General Pineau's army. Besides being Mahmut's foster father, Halil has a wife and children, who are still alive.\n;|Byuraku Pasha}}\n:\n:Referred to only by his title, Büyük Pasha, or \"Great Pasha\", is the 42-year-old (41 at the start of the series) highest rank Pasha of the Divan and is the head of Türkiye stratocracy.

A kind and loving person, Ibrahim has a wife and twin sons who also reside in Hisar.\n;サルジャ|Teshisatu Kapu Saruja Pasha}}\n:\n:Saruça is the 29-year-old governor of the 3rd Province, and one of the 13 Pashas that also hold the rank of Vizier. The Tesisat-Kapı clan is the oldest clan in Greater Türkiye and his family has always been on good terms with the four sultanates. Saruça is a supporter of the sultanates' apparent desire to gain equal power to the Türkiye stratocracy, to the point of refusing to believe that they are involved with Balt-Rhein in any way. When tasked to make sure the four sultans attend Orhan's wedding in order to enact an assassination, Saruça tells Balaban about the plot instead and is later killed on the latter's orders.\n;クルト|Kuruto Kuruto Pasha}}\n:\n:Kurt is a 37-year-old (36 at the start of the series) Pasha from the 8th Province and one of the generals that serve under Halil's expedition army. After Halil's death, Kurt is assigned to serve under Mahmut's command and soon becomes a close and loyal companion to him.

After the war, Kurt Kurt is appointed the new governor of Chielo.\n;\n:\n:Ahmet is a 17-year-old (15 at the start of the series) soldier from the 7th Province and serves in Halil's expedition army.

According to Nurcan, Zeki graduated in the top of his class and is one of Türkiye's finest architects, while being known for working quickly and efficiently. Although he is somewhat headstrong and candid, he cares for Halil dearly and wants to preserve his legacy after his death. He is strict with Mahmut and is often at odds with Zağanos, who seems to contradict Halil's ideology, and is not afraid to speak against him.\n;ヌルザーン}}\n:\n:Nurcan is a 25-year-old (23 at the start of the series) Pasha that serves under Mahmut's command and is a close friend of Zeki. Nurcan has known Zeki for a long time, even before entering military school together. Cheerful and light-hearted, Nurcan often sports a smile on his face and enjoys teasing Zeki, much to his annoyance.\n;ジェミル|Anatoru Jemiru Pasha}}\n:Cemil is a Pasha from the 1st province and a first steward official, thus making him Zağanos's subordinate. A serious and loyal supporter of Zağanos, Cemil acts as one of his confidantes and serves as one of his generals in the Imperial Invasion army.

After his father's death, Balaban blames Türkiye for making Mızrak go to war and vows to make Mızrak independent from Türkiye. When Balt-Rhein promises to help Mızrak become independent, Balaban conspires with them to incite Türkiye into a civil war. Balaban possesses a sharp mind and charismatic presence, making Mızrak more prosperous than his father's reign and is an efficient leader. However, his short-tempered, prideful, and brutal personality makes him underestimate his foes and causes people to be fearful of him. Balaban is willing to use his family members to achieve his goals and kill them if they got in his way, despite sharing a good relationship with them in the past. Balaban and his younger brother, Beyazit, were very close, but their relationship ends tragically when Balaban becomes blinded by his own ambitions, forcing Beyazit to kill him to stop the civil war. Balaban is strongly hinted to be homosexual and enjoys surrounding himself with beautiful men, even offering Mahmut a place in his Yeñiçeri. Balaban owns a tame tiger named Al-Sakal, who is cared for by Beyazit after his death and later dies beside his younger brother during Lelederik's invasion of Türkiye.\n;バヤジット|Uremā Bayajitto}}\n:\n:Beyazit is the 28-year-old (26 at the start of the series) fourth generation and current Sultan of the Mızrak stratocracy, the youngest child of Yıldırım Usman, and a spy for Zağanos's spy network that is stationed in the territory. Unlike Balaban, Beyazit has a sweet temperament and a gentle demeanor, and strives to stop Balaban from endangering Türkiye. Despite coming into conflict with Balaban, Beyazit loves his brother deeply, to the point of considering him to be the most important person in his life. After killing Balaban, Beyazit is left emotionally scarred, believing that his brother's spirit watches over him and tries to honor his brother's memory by protecting Mızrak. Being a knowledgeable scholar, Beyazit has access to many foreign items from around the world along with their mechanics, which helps revolutionize his country's warfare weaponry. Despite his dislike towards violence and destructive weapons, Beyazit follows Zağanos's orders to help Vasco build cannons in order to combat Balt-Rhein. During Lelederik's invasion of Türkiye, Beyazit dies after being severely wounded by Glalat and reunites with Balaban in the afterlife.\n;ファトマ|Niryuferu Fatoma}}\n:\n:Fatma is the 34-year-old (32 at the start of the series) third generation Sultan of the Balta stratocracy and the sister of Balaban and Beyazit that married into the Balta clan. After her husband's death four years before the series, Fatma was made sultan in accordance with his will until their son, Kemal, turns fifteen. However, many political figures were against Fatma being sultan and wanted Cassim (her husband's younger brother) to rule instead. After Balaban had Cassim killed, Fatma becomes a puppet to Balaban's ambitions and submits to him in order to protect her children from anyone who opposes Kemal's ascension to the throne. After the civil war, Fatma is spared from death, though she is publicly announced to be dead, and is staying in a house on the outskirts of the Kiliç stratocracy. This arrangement allows her children to see her in secret whenever they want and Kiliç Orhan frequently visits her to keep her company.\n;アイシェ|Arumuto Aishe}}\n:\n:Ayşe is the 19-year-old (17 at the start of the series) daughter of Sultan Fatma, Kemal's elder sister, and niece of Sultan Balaban and Beyazit. Sharp-minded and blunt, Ayşe is the Hanım of the Balta stratocracy, though her strong-willed nature makes her act and take charge of things beyond her position. She is engaged to Kiliç Orhan and accepts the fact that it is her duty to marry him. Although she has simply sees him as a friend, she respects their courtship and encourages Orhan to become a worthy leader and husband to her one day.

After the civil war, she holds the title of Vizier-i-Azam and helps Kemal rule until he turns fifteen.\n;\n:\n:Kemal is the 11-year-old (10 at the start of the series) fourth generation and current Sultan of the Balta stratocracy and the youngest child of Sultan Fatma. Due to his youth, Kemal's ascension to the throne is initially delayed and his mother is made sultan in accordance with his father's will until he turns fifteen. At the end of the civil war, it was Kemal's pleas that made Mahmut spare his mother from death and promise to eliminate anyone that would oppose Kemal's claim to the throne. His older sister Ayşe is his appointed guardian, going to important meetings in his place and tutoring him so he will be able to rule on his own once he is fifteen.\n;ウズン|Yagu Uzun}}\n:\n:Uzun is the 45-year-old second-generation Sultan of the Biçki stratocracy and Ismail's father. He has a total of seventy-seven sons, sending all of them to be raised by leaders of influential merchant companies as soon as they are born. A cowardly and greedy man, Uzun was persuaded by Balt-Rhein to rebel against Türkiye with the promise of more wealth, but was slain by Ismail during the civil war in order to gain the throne.\n;イスマイル|Suirāfu Isumairu}}\n:\n:Ismail is the 18-year-old (16 at the start of the series) third generation and current Sultan of the Biçki stratocracy, and the 45th son of Yağ Uzun. Raised by the leader of the Jin company since he was born, Ismail has no loyalty to his father and despises him. Possessing an excellent business acumen, Ismail finds his father's road construction plans with Balt-Rhein to be unbeneficial and joins Mahmut to stop him to the point of personally killing his father to get the throne. Although he always looks for ways to make profit, Ismail has integrity, which his father lacks, as he honors his deals and refuses to act against the interests of Greater Türkiye. Despite being sultan, Ismail continues to conduct and leave the capital city frequently on business trips.\n;セリム|Yuzu Masuka Serimu}}\n:\n:Selim is the 41-year-old second-generation Sultan of the Kiliç stratocracy and the strong-willed and assertive father of Orhan. A very private individual, Selim always wears a mask to hide his face so other people won't read his expressions. To preserve his weaker country from Balaban's wrath as well as Balt-Rhien, Selim is forced to cooperate with them and start a civil war. Although he was willing to aid Mahmut and his allies in assassinating the other sultans, he betrays them once the ruse was discovered and tries to harm Ayşe. In order to protect her, Orhan stabs Selim, much to his surprise, as he did not expect to see his timid son take action. Proud that Orhan has finally begun to choose a path for himself, Selim encourages his son not to regret the decisions that he will make as the new sultan before he succumbs to his wounds and dies.\n;オルハン|Kuruchu Oruhan}}\n:\n:Orhan is the 21-year-old (19 at the start of the series) third generation and current Sultan of the Kiliç stratocracy, Sultan Selim's son, and the betrothed of Ayşe, whom he has known since childhood. Unlike the other sultans, Orhan is weak-willed and soft-hearted, often being indecisive and a little oblivious to politics. After fatally killing his father to protect Ayşe, Orhan slowly begins to mature, though he is still too timid to voice his thoughts. Although he loves Ayşe dearly, he knows that she loves Beyazit, but his father comforts him with the prospect that she might come to love him one day and encourages Orhan to become a sultan worthy of her.\nBalt-Rhein Empire\nThe Baltic and Rhein Empire, commonly shorten as \"Balt-Rhein\", is made of two large, mountainous regions of land. Due to the lack of fertile soil in many areas (mostly in the Baltic region) and the cold climate, the empire has many poverty-stricken regions and poor domestic affairs outside of the capital city of St. Michael. As a result, the empire is highly expansionistic and aggressive, earning the hatred and fear of other nations for their merciless and tyrannical treatment of places they have conquered. Balt-Rhein is also very politically unstable as the government's treasury is nearly empty and many different factions exist with their own agendas. As the series progresses, it loses most of its foreign territories and is reduced to just the Baltic region, which is conquered in the end of the war, becoming one of Türkiye's provinces ruled by Zağanos.\n;\n:\n:Louis is the 35-year-old (33 at the start of the series) Prime Minister of the Balt-Rhein Empire, gaining the position 5 years before the series, and the man behind its expansionist policies. He is highly intelligent and scheming, employing various strategies and conspiracies to expand the imperial Balt-Rhein territory by invading other nations. Although he aspires to make Balt-Rhein into a great empire, he cares little of the territories they annexed and has no qualms in sacrificing imperial citizens to achieve his goals. Louis is very arrogant that his plans will make the empire emerge victorious and retains his hubris in the face of failure. His family has assisted the imperial family's finances for a long time, which grants him a lot of political power that prevents anyone from opposing his plans, including Emperor Goldbalt IX. Among his supporters, Louis has a sexual relationship with his friend and colleague, Simon Blanchard.\n;\n:\n:Lelederik is the 28-year-old (26 at the start of the series) Duchess of the Balt-Rhein Empire's Ellvaldesberg territory and Emperor Goldbalt XI's niece. Her father, Alfred (Goldbalt's younger brother) and her older brother Alfred are both dead, making her third-in-line to inherit the throne after her cousins. She is a skilled fighter and leads her own unit that specialize in mountain infantry, though she lost a large portion of it during the Phoiníkē invasion. Although she takes part in Louis's military campaign and often acts as a diplomat, Lelederik dislikes Louis and sometimes takes actions that goes against his plans. She is very belligerent and prefers outright conquest over Louis's machinations and allowance for a peaceful surrender. She is killed by Mahmut while attempting to capture Altın in the last battle of the war.\n;\n:\n:A 27-year-old (25 at the start of the series) Ellvaldesberg nobleman and aide to Lelederik, whom he has known since they were children. Glalat is a highly capable soldier under Lelederik's command, joining her as a soldier or a diplomat to further Louis's plans for the sake of his homeland. However, Glalat dislikes Louis and is willing to follow Lelederik's orders that contradict Louis's plans. Glalat is stoic and shares the same callousness that Lelederik has towards people and the bloodshed they create, even to his fellow countrymen. He is killed during the battle of Altın.\n;\n:\n:At 56 years old (54 at the start of the series), Goldbalt XI is the dignified and stoic current ruler of the Balt-Rhein Empire. Although he is fully aware of Louis's schemes, Goldbalt passively allows Louis to take charge of the empire's expansionist campaign since the imperial family is dependent on his family's financial contributions and seemingly shares Louis's belief that the empire must keep conquering other nations in order to survive. Aside from being Lelederik's uncle, Goldbalt has two sons named Gunther and Gustav. Following Balt-Rhein's defeat, he is executed.\n;\n:\n:An 88-year-old (86 at the start of the series) man, Law is the Admiral Balt-Rhein Imperial Navy and is charged with keeping Phoiníkē and its trade routes secure. Unlike most of the Balt-Rhein army, Law takes no pleasure in military conquest and tries to avoid unnecessary violence, but diligently carries out his duties when prompted. As his hometown Vaissel was once part of the Law Kingdom that had an alliance with Phoiníkē, it saddens Law to play a part in its downfall. He is often seen with his aide and right-hand man, Legatus, who he has an amicable relationship with and is comfortable confiding his personal thoughts to.\n;\n:Simon is the 29-year-old (27 at the start of the series) Minister of Finance and Louis's confidant. Although he supports Louis's plans, he isn't afraid to voice his concerns when he sees those plans are foiled. He knows Louis very well, being the only person to see past his bravado and has a sexual relationship with him. After the war, Simon's merits are recognized by the Türkiye government, who grants him the title of Pasha.\n;\n:\n:Eisenstein is a 97-year-old (95 at the start of the series) Imperial Adviser and has served well over 75 years since Emperor Goldbalt's father's reign. Eisenstein is the only politician that openly opposed Louis's militant schemes, constantly arguing to stop the wars and improve domestic affairs, but his warnings go unheeded. However, there are a few that share his anti-war policy and secretly devise their own plot to save the empire. After the war, Eisenstein's merits are recognized by the Türkiye government, who grants him the title of Pasha.\n;\n:\n:Nicolo is a 14-year-old (12 at the start of the series) page in the Balt-Rhein castle since he was seven. Bright and intelligent, Nicolo attends to Louis often, who is also fond of Nicolo and quizzes him on subjects.\nImperial Army\n;\n:\n:Lily is the 25-year-old (24 at the start of the series) military supervisor and a loyal supporter of Louis's military campaign, serving as his eyes on the front lines and sharing his callous disregard for the bloodshed the army causes in the war. She is also Louis's secretary and former student, learning cartography from him and using topography to predict the enemies' movements and ambush them. She is later killed during a battle between Balt-Rhein and the Anti-Imperial Alliance.\n;\n:\n:Pineau is the 46-year-old (44 at the start of the series) General of the Balt-Rhein army, and was a participant in the war with Türkiye twelve years before the series. Despite his intimidating appearance and diligently performing his duties, he is an honorable person, greatly detesting the suffering the empire causes, and is part of Duke Eisenstein's anti-war faction. Pineau tries his best to restrain his army from abusing innocent people and strictly punishing anyone that breaks the military code. Unknown to Mahmut, he was the general in charge of the unit that destroyed the Tuğril tribe, though he didn't have any part in the slaughter. During a battle between Balt-Rhein and the Anti-Imperial Alliance, Pineau graciously accepts his death and allows himself to be beheaded by Mahmut.\n;\n:\n:Frentzen is the 35-year-old (33 at the start of the series) commander of the 1st battalion and a member of Duke Eisenstein's anti-war faction. Born as a commoner, Frentzen and his childhood friend Adam volunteered for the army, hoping to raise in rank to reform Balt-Rhein from within one day. Frentzen is born with a poor constitution and regularly has to take medicine, but he is a gifted soldier and has a very sharp intuition, making predictions that often turns out to be accurate. After General Pineau's death, he briefly becomes General of the Balt-Rhein army station in South Rumeliana before dying in a sword fight against Mahmut.\n;\n:\n:Adam is the 35-year-old (33 at the start of the series) commander of the 2nd battalion and a member of Duke Eisenstein's anti-war faction. Like his childhood friend Frentzen, Adam is a commoner who volunteered for the army, hoping to raise in rank to reform Balt-Rhein from within one day. Despite his wide girth, Adam is quite agile and possesses formidable physical strength, being able to fight and skillfully command his battalion simultaneously. After General Pineau's death, he briefly becomes Lieutenant General of the Balt-Rhein army station in South Rumeliana before dying in a battle against Abiriga.\n;\n:Wichter is a 26-year-old (as of Chapter 99) soldier stationed under Frentzen's command and a good friend to him and Adam. He is part of Duke Eisenstein's anti-war faction and takes charge of the remaining South Rumeliana troops after Frentzen is killed in battle. After reuniting to Duke Eisenstein, Dirk and the remnants of the Sud army secretly joins Lelederik's Türkiye invasion campaign and is reassigned as the 8th battalion's commander.\n;\n:Androsch is the former Lieutenant General of the Balt-Rhein army who retired from the army after the first war with Greater Türkiye, and is a cautious and shrewd strategist. Due to General Pineau's and Frentzen's deaths, Androsch is pulled out of retirement and appointed General to lead the defensive battle at the Murs stronghold. Much like his predecessors, Androsch dislikes Louis and is not afraid to voice his disagreement with him, though he knows that Louis uses his political power to manipulate Androsch into following his orders.\n;\n:Tott is the former commander of the 3rd battalion and the current commander of the 1st battalion after Frentzen's death. Compare to the other army commanders, Tott has a very mild-mannered and timid disposition. While apparently clumsy and viewing himself as useless, Tott is actually a competent commander and possesses a keen intuition.\n;\n:\n:Bertz is the 39-year-old (38 at the start of the series) commander of the 5th battalion and seems to be one of the more humble commanders in the army. During a battle between Balt-Rhein and the Anti-Imperial Alliance, he and his division are killed trying to stall the Turkish army as the rest of the army retreats from Murmullo basin.\n;\n:\n:Kirchel is the 49-year-old (48 at the start of the series) commander of the 6th battalion and the oldest among other commanders in the army. He is inquisitive, seemingly less up-to-date with the military developments Louis has spearheaded in the army. He is often quick to offer his thoughts in meetings to his fellow officers, especially Schübel and Hassler. During Balt-Rhein and the Anti-Imperial Alliance, he and his division are killed trying to stall the Turkish army as the rest of the army retreats to Espada.\n;\n:\n:Schmidt is the 29-year-old (28 at the start of the series) commander of the 7th battalion and one of the more hot-blooded commanders in the army. Arrogant and aggressive, Schmidt prefers to rely on brute force during the battle against Anti-Imperial Alliance, which makes him reckless.

The Cuore republics have no formal national military, but they are able to enjoy a period of long-term peace due to having their spies gather information on surroundings nations to keep them in line.\nSouth Rumeliana is more rustic than the Cuore and the form of government varies among the independent city-states, though most are republics and are ruled by an Estado, a head-of-state.

With the help of Mahmut, Niki quickly becomes successful and now does business with Türkiye's support. Although she broke Argyros laws, the council allows Niki to keep her Gosti status so Balt-Rhein will not target Argyros for Niki's assistance in subtly manipulating the empire's economy. Despite her age and small stature, Niki is very strong and tomboyish, remaining steadfast and loyal to Mahmut in spite of the potential dangers. Having known Wan Yixin since childhood, Niki is a skilled combatant and fights with tonfa.\n;\n:\n:Wan Yixin is an 80-year-old (79 at the start of the series) native from Çinili, a country in East Rumeliana, who currently resides in Argyros to purchase rare items for the Emperor of Çinili.
