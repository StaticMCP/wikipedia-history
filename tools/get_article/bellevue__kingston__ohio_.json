Built of brick on a stone foundation, it was the home of leading early Ohio politician Renick Dunlap.\nBuilt from 1835 to 1840, Bellevue was constructed for Colonel William Entrekin, whose family owned the property until its sale to Nelson Dunlap in 1899.  Nelson's son Renick held several political offices, including Ohio Secretary of Agriculture, State Senator, and United States Assistant Secretary of Agriculture.  His house is a rectangular two-and-a-half story structure, located along State Route 159.  The Federal style of its original construction endures little changed to the present day, making the house one of the region's best nineteenth-century farmsteads.  In 1976, Bellevue was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, both because of its well-preserved architecture and because of its connection to Renick Dunlap.\nReferences"
