In the , Rothwell had a population of 7,538 people.\nGeography\nRothwell is in the west of the Redcliffe Peninsula, approximately  north-northeast of Brisbane, the state capital of Queensland.\nThe suburb is bounded to the north by the bay of Deception Bay (part of Moreton Bay), to the east in part by Nathan Road, and to the south and south-west by Saltwater Creek.\nAnzac Avenue enters the suburb from the east (Kippa-Ring) and proceeds west, where at a large intersection () Anzac Avenue continues to the south-west exiting to Mango Hill, while Deception Bay Road heads north-west exiting to the suburb of Deception Bay.The Redcliffe Peninsula railway line enters the suburb from the east (Kippa-Ring) and exits to the south (Mango Hill), connecting to the North Coast railway line at Petrie. The suburb is serviced by the Rothwell railway station (). The  Moreton Bay Railway Cyclepath runs immediately parallel to the railway line; it is to the north of the line in Rothwell.\nRedcliffe Aerodrome is in the north-east of the suburb (). It is owned and operated by Moreton Bay City Council.\nRothwell is one of the few areas on the Redcliffe Peninsula prone to flooding due to Saltwater Creek; areas in the southern part of the suburb near the creek are undeveloped. Rothwell Park () along McGahey Street experiences flooding and the relocation of the sports grounds at the park has been proposed for several years.\nThe undeveloped Nathan Road Wetlands Reserve () occupies the north of the suburb (apart from the Redcliffe Aerodrome). Although Rothwell is a bayside suburb, there are no roads or tracks through the wetlands to provide access to the bay.\nHistory\nIn 1888 and 1889 (when the area was known as Deception Bay), there was a long-running attempt to sell a subdivision known as the Isle of Man estate (), bounded to the east, south and west by Saltwater Creek (called Fresh Water Creek in the advertising material). The land was promoted as being near the proposed Redcliffe railway line. However, the lots were either never sold or never developed. Although the subdivision can be seen on cadastral maps until at least 1978, at 2020 the land has returned to a single undivided and undeveloped parcel. This may relate to the flood-prone nature of Saltwater Creek.\nThe suburb's name is after the president of the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland, Thomas James Rothwell, who in 1921 proposed a memorial drive marked by an avenue of trees to Redcliffe via the upgraded main road known as Anzac Avenue). Rothwell died on 28 January 1928 and his involvement with the Avenue was honoured on Sunday 9 April 1933 with the unveiling of the Rothwell monument by the Queensland Governor, Sir Leslie Wilson. This stone obelisk was placed on a small triangular piece of land at the intersection of Anzac Memorial Avenue and the Deception Bay Road, later moving to nearby Rothwell Park () when a roundabout was built on the original site.\nRothwell was officially named as a suburb by the Queensland Place Names Board on 1 July 1970.\nGrace Lutheran College opened on 31 January 1978 with 15 students under teacher Viv Kuhl at Grace Lutheran Primary School at Clontarf. In 1980 it moved to its present site in Rothwell.\nMueller College was established on 30 January 1990 by the Mueller Community Church.\nIn 2015, the Moreton Bay Regional Council began a $18.8 million project to create the Nathan Road Sports Ground () in Kippa-Ring to replace the AFL facility at flood-prone Rothwell Park. It is expected to be completed in 2020.\nDemographics\nIn the , Rothwell had a population of 6,683 people, 52.8% female and 47.2% male.
