Since the events of the Jonestown Massacre, a massive amount of literature and study has been produced on the subject. Numerous documentaries, films, books, poetry, music and art have covered or been inspired by the events of Jonestown. Jim Jones and the events at Jonestown has had a defining influence on society's perception of cults. The widely known expression \"Drinking the Kool-Aid\" originated in the events at Jonestown, although the specific beverage used at the massacre was Flavor Aid rather than Kool-Aid.\nDocumentaries\n* Jonestown: Mystery of a Massacre (1998)\n* Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple (2006)\n* Jonestown: Paradise Lost (2007)\n* CNN Presents: Escape From Jonestown (2008)\n* Seconds from Disaster, episode (season 6, episode 1) \"Jonestown Cult Suicide\" (2012)\n* Witness to Jonestown (2013)\n* Jonestown: The Women Behind the Massacre (2018)\n* Jonestown: Terror in the Jungle (2018)\n* 605 Adults 304 Children (2019), short documentary filmed entirely by the Peoples Temple at Jonestown\nTelevision\n* Guyana Tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones (1980), fact-based miniseries.
