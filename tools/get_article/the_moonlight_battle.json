      "text": "# The Moonlight Battle\n\nThe Moonlight Battle is an oil on canvas history painting by the French-born British artist Dominic Serres, from 1781.  Today the work is held in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich.\nHistory and description\nIt depicts the Battle of Cape St. Vincent fought on 16 January 1780 during the American War of Independence. Dubbed the moonlight battle, as it was fought at night, it was part of Admiral Rodney's successful attempt to resupply the British garrison during the Great Siege of Gibraltar. Rodney's Royal Navy fleet encountered, pursued and defeated a Spanish force off Cadiz, capturing their commander Juan de Lángara in the process.\nSerres, a member of the Royal Academy, was known for his naval scenes. The painting takes place at the moment the San Domingo exploded. Rather than foreground Rodney's flagship HMS Sandwich it views a British two-decker is raking a Spanish ship while another British two-decker pursues Lángara's Fenix.\nIn 1793, Serres produced another work based on the battle, ''Rodney's Fleet Taking in Prizes After the Moonlight Battle, which is also in the collection at Greenwich. The battle was also painted by other marine artists including Francis Holman.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Gardiner, Robert. Navies and the American Revolution 1775-1783.
