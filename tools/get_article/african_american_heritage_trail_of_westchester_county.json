The initial list had 13 sites. Westchester County historian and Schulman History Honoree Dr. Larry Spruill was lead consultant and researcher for the project.\nHistory\nAs early as 1984, leaders of Westchester's African American community under the guidance of John Harmon began building awareness about important heritage sites in the county. A more formalized trail was later created under the auspices of the African American Advisory Board of Westchester County (AAAB) currently chaired by Barbara Edwards. Associated AAAB events like the annual Trailblazer Awards each February and other programs and exhibits are regularly hosted at several of the 16 sites.\nSites\nThe trail includes 16 heritage destination sites as of 2023:\n*  Saint Paul's Church National Historic Site – 897 South Columbus Avenue, Mount Vernon, New York. This landmark, managed by the National Park Service, is the site of thousands of burials of African American men and women. Programs conducted here reflect the contributions of enslaved and free families to the surrounding community along Eastchester Creek. Church records include notations which are helpful for genealogical research purposes.\n*  Jay Estate – 210 Boston Post Road, Rye, New York. The ancestral home of John Jay and the Jay family was also the residence of enslaved and freed men and women of African descent.
