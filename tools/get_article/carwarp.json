Stewart served in both the Victorian Legislative Assembly, where he represented the electoral district of Mildura, and in the federal parliament for the Australian House of Representatives electorate of Wimmera. Another parliamentarian from Carwarp was Albert Allnutt, who represented the electoral district of Mildura in the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1927 until 1945.\nCarwarp is the location for the Mildura Solar Concentrator Power Station, with other solar power plants nearby.\nThe Post Office opened on 17 November 1913 and closed in 1992.\nReferences"
