Philadelphia election officials and the district attorney quickly discounted this, apparently Republican operatives mistakenly believed the counter that records the total number of votes ever made on the voting machines was a count for a candidate.\n* Voting machines controversy in Ohio. Walden O'Dell, the head of Diebold Incorporated, had said in 2003 that he is \"committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president next year.\"\n* In Iowa, a glitch with an optical vote counting machine caused Greene County to not report results for 6 of 15 precincts.

Bush, 251 for Democratic Senator John Kerry, and 1 for Democratic Senator John Edwards, leading to Bush's reelection, despite a formal challenge to Ohio's electoral votes, the first challenge since 1877, resulting in a vote — 1-74 (Yea-Nay) in the Senate and 31–267 in the House.\nElection incidents\nAs of November 10, there were 31,515 reported incidents of voting problems nationally, with approx. 350 new incidents being reported a day. One-third of the problems (12,074) involved voter registration, followed by \"polling place inquiries\" (7,073), absentee ballot-related problems (3,218) and machine problems (1,599). The latter included complaints that some machines registered votes for George W. Bush when the voter selected John Kerry.\nSome allege that voting locations that used electronic voting machines that did not issue a paper receipt or offer auditability correlate geographically with areas that had unilateral discrepancies between exit poll numbers and actual results. Exit polling data in these areas show significantly higher support for Kerry than actual results (outside the margin of error). Some are concerned that, from a statistical perspective, this may be indicative of vote rigging, because the likelihood of this happening by chance is less than 1 in 50,000. Others point out this could be explained by poor exit polling techniques or all discrepancies may be within the margin of error.\nThe first map shows the counties that voted democratic in the 2004 election.

The vote failed, so Colorado awarded all 9 of its electoral votes to Bush, the winner of the vote in that state. Results of the vote follow:\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width:400px;\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center; background:silver;\"| Colorado Amendment 36\n|-\n| |Position || Votes || Vote %\n|-\n| |Yes (proportional split) || 355,712 || 34.10%\n|-\n| |No (remains winner-take-all) || 686,431 || 65.90%\n|}\nMaine and Nebraska splits\n** – Maine and Nebraska are unlike the other 48 states and the District of Columbia in that they allocate their electoral votes in the following manner: 1 for the winner of each congressional district, 2 for the state winner. However, neither state split the vote, so each of these states effectively went winner-take-all.\nPre-election odds\n* On [http://www.tradesports.com/ Tradesports], the Bush futures contract dropped from about 53, where it had been for several days before election, to about 30, in about an hour, but then rallied to 65–66 by 15:30 UTC. On Betfair the odds on a Bush victory increased from 1.75 at the beginning of the day, to 5.0 at 13:00 UTC, and moved down to 1.33 at 15:20 UTC.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081013225540/http://www.oddschecker.com/specials/politics-and-election Oddschecker] gave real time odds and accurate reflection of probabilities from various UK bookmakers.\n* The [https://web.archive.org/web/20051105015750/http://128.255.244.60/graphs/graph_Pres04_WTA.cfm Iowa Futures Market] briefly showed Bush losing ground, with Kerry picking up.\n* The price of light crude oil dropped the day before election by nearly $1.63 (3.2%), amid speculation that a win for Kerry would result in the abolition of President Bush's maximum-capacity Strategic Petroleum Reserve policy. Oil prices continued to fall after the election.\nReferences"
