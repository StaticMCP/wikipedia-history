The West Derby Deysbrook ward was created as a single-member ward from the western half of the former Yew Tree ward and a small part of the former West Derby ward.\nThe ward boundaries follow the southern boundary of Croxteth Park, Princess Drive, Yew Tree Lane, behind Yew Tree Close and St Andrews Avenue, Leyfield Road and Town Row. The ward is part of the West Derby district of Liverpool, and includes West Derby Golf Course, St Vincent's School and Blackmoor Park Infants School.}}\nNotes\nReferences"
