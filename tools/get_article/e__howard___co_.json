Howard & Co. was a clock and watch company founded in 1858 by Edward Howard and Charles Rice after the demise of the Boston Watch Company. The pair acquired some of the material and watches in progress through a lien held by Rice against the defunct company. However, they were unable to purchase the existing factory or machinery, prompting their relocation to Roxbury. Soon afterwards, Howard bought out Rice's share, continuing the company independently with a focus on producing high quality watches based on his own unique designs and eccentric production methods. E. Howard & Co. also produced regulators, and marine clocks.\nIn 1881, Edward Howard retired and sold his interest in the business. On December 1, 1881, the E. Howard Watch & Clock Company was established as a joint stock corporation to succeed the earlier firm.\nEarly history\nHoward was a clockmaking apprentice of Aaron Willard Jr. and commenced business with David P. Davis, manufacturing high-grade wall clocks under the name of Howard & Davis in 1842. They also became known for their manufacture of sewing machines, fire engines and precision balances. About 1843, with a third partner, Luther Stephenson, they began to also manufacture tower clocks.\nIn 1857, David P. Davis left the firm and Howard & Davis was dissolved. In 1857–8, Edward Howard finished and sold left over \"Model 1857\" material from the Boston Watch Co. under the name Howard & Rice. In December 1858, Howard bought out Rice's interest and began manufacturing watches of a new design, signed \"E. Howard & Co.\"  While the company name changed several times during the firm's watchmaking history, all watches it made continued to be signed \"E. Howard & Co.\" throughout, with only minor exceptions. The Howard firm established itself as a leading American manufacturer of luxury watches from 1858 into the 1890s.\nOn March 24, 1861, the clock and watch businesses were combined into one joint stock corporation, the Howard Clock & Watch Company, which failed in 1863. Thereafter, Howard formed a new company called the Howard Watch & Clock Company (transposing clock & watch) on October 1, 1863, which was successful for some years but was reorganized in 1881 after financial setbacks of a few years previous.\nIn 1882, Edward Howard sold out his personal interests and retired, leaving the firm to new management. This firm continued the manufacture of many clock styles, primarily weight driven wall timepieces and regulators of fine quality. Only two common wall models, #5 and # 10, were produced as stock items, all others being manufactured by special order.\nRegular watch making operations ceased in 1903, when the Howard name in association with watches was sold to the Keystone Watch Case Co. Keystone purchased the defunct US Watch Co. factory building in Waltham, Massachusetts (The US Watch Co. of Waltham is not to be confused with an earlier company of the same name in Marion, New Jersey.) Keystone manufactured watches at the location signed \"E. Howard Watch Co.\"  These watches were of new designs and unlike those of the original Howard company. Clocks were manufactured at Roxbury, a section of Boston, but in the early 1930s those operations were also moved to Waltham, Massachusetts. A very small number of pre-existing Howard watches were finished in the Howard clock factory between 1903 and 1927.\nHoward Clock Products\nA new firm known as Howard Clock Products was formed November 5, 1934, to succeed the earlier firm. Clock production was on the wane, but precision gear cutting business kept the firm profitable, particularly from government contract work. Production of smaller clocks ceased in 1957 or 1958 and the last tower clock was produced in 1964.\nIn 1975, Dana J. Blackwell, as a new Vice President of the firm, revived clock production, reintroducing several of the more popular models to the market. Movements in these later clocks maintained the high standards the Howard firm had become famous for and cases were made to very strict specifications.\nThe older owners of the firm sold the business to a young, seemingly successful businessman in August 1977. He eventually fired most of the firm's knowledgeable management and proceeded to drain it financially. By 1980, when the firm was at the verge of bankruptcy, the new manager was caught attempting to burn down the factory building. After a lengthy trial he was convicted, though never served any time in jail.\nAt the time of the arrest, the Federal Government stepped in and the Howard firm was placed under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. A manager was brought in by the bankruptcy court and after creditors were satisfied, the firm sold the clockmaking portion of the business to private investors who continue to offer Howard clocks.\nTimeline\n* 1842 E.
