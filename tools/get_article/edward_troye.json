He worked primarily for the Steele and Alexander families, and Alexander \"Keene\" Richards.\nTroye taught French and drawing at Spring Hill College, 1849–1855.\nLater travels and move to Alabama\nLater he and Richards traveled to the Holy Land where he painted horses, Damascus, Syria cattle, the Dead Sea and the bazaar of Damascus while Richards bought Arabian horses. Bethany College, West Virginia, retains copies of some of these paintings.\nIn 1869, Troye moved his family to a  cotton plantation in Madison County, Alabama. Troye returned to Kentucky and resided at the home of longtime friend Keen Richards until his death from pneumonia on July 25, 1874.\nDeath and legacy\nTroye's best works, between the years 1835 and 1874 (prior to the birth of photography), are true-to-life delineations of historical American Great Plains horses. He painted Southern United States pre-American Civil War thoroughbreds. Little was known of Troye's work in the eastern United States until 1912. Since then, more than 300 of his paintings have been found, of which three-fourths have been photographed since 1912. In addition, he is the author of The Race Horses of America (1867).\nTroye is buried in Georgetown Cemetery with his wife and grandson, Clarence D. Johnson.\nNotable horse paintings\n]]\n*American Eclipse and Sir Henry\n*Bertrand\n*Black Maria\n*Boston and his son, Lexington\n*Glencoe I\n*Kentucky\n*Lecomte\n*Leviathan\n*Longfellow\n*Ophelia - dam of Gray Eagle\n*Reality\n*Reel\n*Revenue\n*Richard Singleton\n*Ruthless\n*Wagner\n*West Australian\nReferences\nExternal links"
