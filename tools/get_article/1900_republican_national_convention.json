The Exposition Auditorium was located south of the University of Pennsylvania, and the later Convention Hall was constructed along the building's east wall. It was demolished in 2006.\nEach state was allotted two delegates per electoral vote, and territories were granted from two to six delegates. Altogether, there were 926 delegates and an equal number of alternates.\nMark Hanna opened the convention, and proposed that Senator Edward O. Wolcott of Colorado serve as temporary chairman: this was to show that the party had overcome its division in 1896, when the Colorado delegation walked out of the Republican Convention after a dispute over federal subsidies for the silver industry. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts served as the convention's permanent chairman.\nPresident William McKinley was unanimously nominated for reelection after no candidate ran against him, although Admiral George Dewey considered a run.\nGovernor Theodore Roosevelt of New York, who was himself a delegate, was nominated for vice president by a vote of 925 to zero, his vote alone abstaining.\nState delegates\nThe 1900 Republican National Convention included a historic first for the Republican Party: Frances Warren of Wyoming served as the party's first-ever female convention delegate. Additionally Jennie L. McCargar Jones, of Utah, and Susan Henderson West of Idaho served as alternate delegates.\nSpeakers\nThe 1900 convention had fewer speakers than a modern convention typically has due to lack of TV and even radio at this time. There were however the following speakers:\nJune 19\n* Prayer by Rev. James Gray Bolton D.D.\n* Senator Mark Hanna (Ohio)\n* Senator Edward O. Wolcott (Colorado)\nJune 20\n* Prayer by Rev. Charles M.

Woodruff of New York\nVice President Garret Hobart had announced in September 1899 that he would not seek re-election due to declining health. In the event, he died in office on November 21, 1899, leaving the party the task of choosing a running mate for McKinley.\nEntering the convention, many had expected that the ticket would consist of President McKinley and New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt. However, Ohio Senator Mark Hanna maneuvered to keep Roosevelt off the ballot, instead proposing Navy Secretary John D. Long of Massachusetts or Iowa Representative Jonathan P. Dolliver. Without the support of McKinley, Hanna's efforts fell short. Roosevelt himself did not particularly want to abandon his position of governor, but he desired to run for president in 1904 and when the party nominated him, he accepted the position. Roosevelt's nomination was spearheaded by bosses Matthew Quay of Pennsylvania and Thomas C. Platt of New York, the latter of whom wished to find a different job for the reformist Roosevelt.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | Vice Presidential Balloting\n|-\n!
