These powers generally only apply to members of public fire and rescue services. Powers are granted to firefighters in England & Wales by virtue of the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004, in Scotland by virtue of the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 and in Northern Ireland by virtue of the Fire and Rescue Services (Northern Ireland) Order 2006. Whilst the three acts are almost identical in effect, they word the powers differently and vary in relation to the issuance of warrants.\nEngland and Wales\nIn emergencies\nA fire and rescue authority may authorise in writing an employee for the purposes of section 44 of the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 (separate from authorisation under section 45 below, which is only granted to some firefighters).\nThey may do anything they reasonably believe to be necessary for the purpose of:\n*extinguishing or preventing the fire or protecting life or property (if they reasonably believe a fire to have broken out or to be about to break out),\n*rescuing people or protecting them from serious harm (if they reasonably believe a road traffic accident to have occurred),\n*discharging any function conferred on the fire and rescue authority in relation to the emergency (if they reasonably believe an emergency of another kind to have occurred), or\n*preventing or limiting damage to property resulting from action taken as mentioned above.\nAn \"emergency\" means an event or situation that causes or is likely to cause:\n*one or more individuals to die, be seriously injured or become seriously ill, or\n*serious harm to the environment (including the life and health of plants and animals).\nThey may also:\n*enter premises or a place, by force if necessary, without the consent of the owner or occupier of the premises or place,\n*move or break into a vehicle without the consent of its owner,\n*close a highway,\n*stop and regulate traffic, or\n*restrict the access of persons to premises or a place.\nA person who without reasonable excuse obstructs or hinders a person employed by a fire and rescue authority while responding to \"emergency circumstances\" commits an offence. The maximum punishment is a fine not exceeding level five on the standard scale.\n\"Emergency circumstances\" are those that are present or imminent and:\n*are causing or are likely to cause:\n**serious injury to or the serious illness (including mental illness) of a person,\n**serious harm to the environment (including the life and health of plants and animals),\n**serious harm to any building or other property, or\n**a worsening of any such injury, illness or harm, or\n*are likely to cause the death of a person.\nInvestigations and execution of functions\nA fire and rescue authority may authorise in writing an employee for the purposes of section 45 of the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 (separate from authorisation under section 44 above, which is granted to all firefighters).\nAn authorised officer may at any reasonable time enter premises:\n*for the purpose of obtaining information needed for the discharge of a fire and rescue authority’s functions under

section 9], or\n*if there has been a fire in the premises, for the purpose of investigating what caused the fire or why it progressed as it did.\nHowever, an authorised officer may not:\n*enter premises by force, or\n*demand admission as of right to premises occupied as a private dwelling unless 24 hours' notice in writing has first been given to the occupier of the dwelling.\nAn authorised officer may not enter as of right premises in which there has been a fire if the premises are unoccupied, and the premises were occupied as a private dwelling immediately before the fire, unless 24 hours' notice in writing has first been given to the person who was the occupier of the dwelling immediately before the fire.\nAn authorised officer may apply to a justice of the peace if he considers it necessary to enter premises, but he is unable to do so, or considers that he is likely to be unable to do so, otherwise than by force.\nIf on an application a justice is satisfied that it is necessary for the officer to enter the premises, and he is unable to do so, or is likely to be unable to do so, otherwise than by force, he may issue a warrant authorising the officer to enter the premises by force at any reasonable time.\nAn authorised officer may also apply to a justice of the peace if he considers it necessary to enter a dwelling without giving notice as required.\nIf on an application a justice is satisfied that it is necessary for the authorised officer to enter the dwelling without giving notice as required, the justice may issue a warrant authorising the officer to enter the premises at any time (by force if necessary).\nAn authorised officer exercising a power of entry under this section must, if so required, produce evidence of his authorisation, and any warrant, before entering the premises, or at any time before leaving the premises.\nIf an authorised officer exercises a power of entry for the purposes of obtaining information  needed for the discharge of a fire and rescue authority’s functions under section 7, 8 or 9, he may take with him any other persons, and any equipment, that he considers necessary, and require any person present on the premises to provide him with any facilities, information, documents or records, or other assistance, that he may reasonably request.\nIf an authorised officer exercises a power of entry for the purpose of investigating what caused a fire or why it progressed as it did, he may:\n*take with him any other persons, and any equipment, that he considers necessary,\n*inspect and copy any documents or records on the premises or remove them from the premises,\n*carry out any inspections, measurements and tests in relation to the premises, or to an article or substance found on the premises, that he considers necessary,\n*take samples of an article or substance found on the premises, but not so as to destroy it or damage it unless it is necessary to do so for the purpose of the investigation,\n*dismantle an article found on the premises, but not so as to destroy it or damage it unless it is necessary to do so for the purpose of the investigation,\n*take possession of an article or substance found on the premises and detain it for as long as is necessary for any of these purposes:\n**to examine it and do anything he has power to do under paragraph (c) or (e),\n**to ensure that it is not tampered with before his examination of it is completed,\n**to ensure that it is available for use as evidence in proceedings for an offence relevant to the investigation,\n*require a person present on the premises to provide him with any facilities, information, documents or records, or other assistance, that he may reasonably request.\nIf an authorised officer takes samples of an article or substance found on the premises he must leave a notice at the premises (either with a responsible person or if that is impracticable fixed in a prominent position) giving particulars of the article or substance and stating that he has taken a sample of it, and if it is practicable to do so, give to a responsible person at the premises a portion of the sample marked in a manner sufficient to identify it.\nIf an authorised officer takes possession of an article or substance found on the premises, he must leave a notice at the premises (either with a responsible person or if that is impracticable fixed in a prominent position) giving particulars of the article or substance and stating that he has taken possession of it.\nIf in the exercise of any power an authorised officer enters premises which are unoccupied, or from which the occupier is temporarily absent, he must on his departure leave the premises as effectively secured against unauthorised entry as he found them.\nA person commits an offence if without reasonable excuse:\n*he obstructs the exercise of any power, or\n*he fails to comply with any requirement, being a person present on the premises, to provide an authorised officer with any facilities, information, documents or records, or other assistance, that he may reasonably request.\nThe maximum punishment is a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale.\nEnforcement of fire safety legislation\nIn England and Wales Fire Safety Inspectors are given additional powers to firefighters in order to carry out routine inspections, investigate the commission of fire safety related offences and prohibit or restrict the use of un-safe buildings. They also issue other legal notices.\nTheir powers are derived not only from the Fire Rescue Services Act 2004 but also Article 27 of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, the Health & Safety at Work Act etc 1974, Fireworks Act 2003, and the Licensing Act 2003 including other pieces of legislation. Upon the granting of a warrant from a Magistrate, Fire Inspectors may use force to make entry into a premises for the purposes of securing evidence, investigating the commission of an offence or to make an inspection. Usually this is done with the Police in attendance. Any persons suspected of committing an offence are ordinarily placed under caution and invited for an interview under PACE conditions. Committing a fire safety-related offence includes summary and indictable offences which means for more serious cases the offenders could be sent to prison.\nScotland\nIn emergencies\nAn employee of a fire and rescue authority who is authorised in writing by the authority for the purposes of Section 25 of the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 and on duty may:\n*if the employee reasonably believes that a
