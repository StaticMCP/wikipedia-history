He was a professor emeritus of UCLA's Neuropsychiatric Institute.\nFamily life and education\nEdward Ross Ritvo, son of Max Ritvo and Frances (née Davis) Ritvo, was born in Boston on June 1, 1930. As a young man he enjoyed rowing, skied on Harvard's ski team, and once climbed Mount Blanc. He earned a B.A. in Social Anthropology at Harvard University in 1951, an M.D. from Boston University School of Medicine in 1955, and he completed his internship at Massachusetts Memorial Hospitals in1956, as well as a psychiatry residency at Massachusetts Mental Health Center from 1956–1958. He had seven children including Eva Ritvo and Max Ritvo.\nCareer\nRitvo held positions as a teaching fellow in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, Tufts Medical School, and a fellowship in child psychiatry at James Jackson Putnam Children's Center in Boston.\nDrafted into the U.S. Army Medical Corps, he was the Chief of the Closed Neuropsychiatric Section at the Brooke Army Medical Center in Sam Houston, Texas, from 1958–1961. He self-published his experiences there in Drafted and Shafted: Memoirs of an Army Psychiatrist.\nFollowing a fellowship in child psychiatry at Reiss-Davis Clinic for Child Psychiatry, in Los Angeles from 1961–1962, he joined the faculty of the UCLA School of Medicine in 1962, where he served until he retired as professor emeritus.\nHe was one of the psychiatrists who wrote the original definition of autism for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.\nRitvo led a 1985 study of 61 pairs of twins which showed \"that autism is associated with an inherited gene, and that the pattern of inheritance is recessive.\" He and colleagues at UCLA identified a subclinical form of autism in the parents of autistic children.\nSelected publications\nProfessional books\n*\n*\n*\nJournal articles\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* 1980 Freeman, B.J., and Ritvo, E.R.
