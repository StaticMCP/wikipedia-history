It was originally created in 1894, when multi-member districts were abolished, and the three member district of Newcastle was divided between Waratah, Newcastle East, Newcastle West, Kahibah and Wickham. The district was abolished in 1913 and recreated in 1930, replacing parts of Kahibah and Wallsend. It was abolished again in 1999.\nMembers for Waratah\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style='border-style: none none none none;'\n! colspan=\"4\" | First incarnation (1894–1913)\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Member !!
