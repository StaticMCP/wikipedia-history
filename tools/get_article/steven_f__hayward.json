In 1980, he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in business from Lewis and Clark College. He then received an M.A. in government in 1984 and a Ph.D. in American studies in 1986, both from the Claremont Graduate School.\nCareer\nIn 1984, Hayward started work as director of journalism of the group Public Research Syndicated at the Claremont Institute through 1987. In 1985, he also became Executive Director for Inland Business Magazine through 1990.  In 1987, he became director of the Golden State Center for Policy Studies through 1991.

That same year, he co-authored an article with Kenneth P. Green entitled, 'Market-Friendly Energy', in The 4% Solution: Unleashing the Economic Growth America Needs, published by the George W. Bush Presidential Center.\nFor more than a decade, he has directed the Ashbrook Center's new program in political economy at Ashland University.\nHe often hosts for William Bennett's radio show Morning in America on the broadcasting network of Salem Media Group.\nViews\nEnvironment and global warming\nHayward has said, \"we talk as though the earth is so fragile that, you know, we're endlessly insulting it in its doom.\" He has also said that \"environmental concern rightly understood as now a settled middle class value in wealthy countries and will become more so in other countries around the world as they prosper and that's a key point.\" He supports the idea of an environmental Kuznets curve, in which increased economic development constitutes the best way to help the environment. He believes that modern developing nations such as China could speed through the curve with technological progress.\nHayward rejects claims that climate change poses a major threat to humanity, and labeled climate scientists analysts fearful of change  as \"climateers,\" \"climatistas,\" \"alarmists,\" and the \"environmental Politburo.\" He has advocated that the world engage in geoengineering projects to mitigate global warming, such as spraying saltwater in the air to increase cloud cover over the oceans and thus reflect back sunlight. He advocates that the U.S. build more nuclear power plants as another necessary solution. Hayward has remarked, \"the environment is too important to be left to the environmentalists.\" He has labeled the Green New Deal as the \"Green Nude Eel\" and claimed that \"enlarging government power to 'fight climate change' is nowadays a central purpose of the left.\"\nHe created and starred in the documentary An Inconvenient Truth...Or Convenient Fiction?, a rebuttal of many of the claims in Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth, saying that while Gore is right about many things, he goes too far in predictions of doom. In 1994, he has co-authored an annual Index of Leading Environmental Indicators (1996–2008), published by the Pacific Research Institute, issued each Earth Day.\nRonald Reagan\nIn his books about Reagan, Hayward argued that Reagan had the important insight that the Soviet Union was internally weak due to socio-economic problems, which distinguishes Reagan from most intellectual conservatives in recent American history. He stated that Reagan's foreign policy and domestic policy should be thought of as two sides of the same coherent worldview. He has referred to Reagan as, on net, more of a tax cutter despite having enacted both tax increases and decreases because the marginal tax brackets shrunk.  He praised Reagan for trying to reduce the size of the federal government, cutting certain social welfare programs, moving other programs to state control, expanding the U.S. military, advocating originalism, and making disarmament pledges with the Soviet Union. He criticized Reagan for his conduct in the Iran-Contra affair, concluding that Reagan let his emotions take over his judgment and wrongly paid for hostages via arms. He also criticized Reagan for declining to push for a Taxpayer Bill of Rights until the latter part of his second term. Hayward estimated that Reagan ultimately failed to create a true Constitution-based ideological movement to succeed him. He also described current conservative views of Reagan as too superficial and focused too much on style.\nPersonal life\nHayward is married to former George Mason University Law School professor Allison Hayward.\nHayward is or has been a member of the:\n* Philadelphia Society\n* National Tax Limitation Committee\n* Interfaith Stewardship Alliance\n* Center of the American Experiment\n* Donors Trust\nWritings\nArticles written by Hayward appeared in The Weekly Standard starting in 2001 and in National Review-related publications since 2002.
