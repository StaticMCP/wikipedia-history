It had a population of around 115 in January 2017.\nHistory\nThe village was first mentioned around 1400 as Schengen, and is the name of a stream. Skingen developed at the beginning of our era on a natural height near the Middelzee. Archaeological artefacts have been discovered from the Roman period. Later the hill was extended into a terp (artificial living hill). A church had already been built in the 11th or 12th century when in 1877 work began on a new one. The church was restored in 2003.\nSkingen was home to 109 people in 1840. Until 2018, the village was part of the Menameradiel municipality.\nBorn in Skingen\n*  (1945), Frisian writer\nGallery\nFile:Skingen, Stevenstsjerke, oersjoch.jpg|Interior of the church\nReferences"
