It was first announced via the band's Facebook page on April 30, along with simultaneous releases of Urban Dance and Asia. They were first available on tour with Endon, making their release date May 2.\nThe album is entirely instrumental drone and noise experimentation, very similar to Asia and most of Urban Dance as well as past albums such as The Thing Which Solomon Overlooked - Chronicle.\nThe cover art posted by the band is different from the physical product, which features a young Japanese girl dressed as a ballerina.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n* Atsuo\n* Wata\n* Takeshi\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.discogs.com/Boris-warpath/release/6966082 Discogs release page]"
