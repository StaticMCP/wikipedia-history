As Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie and Sha Wujing search for a way out of this nation surrounded by a vast magical net, it soon transpires that romantic love is the only key to opening the gate.\nCast\n* Aaron Kwok as Sun Wukong, the Monkey King\n* Feng Shaofeng as Tang Sanzang, the Buddhist monk\n* Zhao Liying as the Ruler of Women's Country\n* Xiaoshenyang as Zhu Bajie, the pig demon\n* Him Law as Sha Wujing, the water-buffalo\n* Lin Chi-ling as Hebo\n* Gigi Leung as Advisor\n* Liu Tao as Guanyin\n* Kingdom Yuen as Priest\n* Cecilia So as young advisor\n* Sire Ma\nProduction\nCasting\nZhao Liying was cast in the role of the Ruler of Women's Country.

On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating, the film has a weighted average score of 51 out of 100 based on 4 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". On Tianjin Maoyan Culture Media's ticketing website the film has received a 7.8/10 from the audience based on over 240,000 reviews.\nElizabeth Kerr from The Hollywood Reporter believes that the film is \"bonker(s), but in a charming, delirious sort of way\" with \"enough eye-catching set pieces\". As for actors, Aaron Kwok delivers a \"strong performance...that's far more nuanced than it needs to be\", while \"Feng and Zhao are a less than riveting couple, making their dilemmas leaden soap opera instead of compelling crises of conscience or identity\". She also points out that even the Queen's still \"begging for the men's help\" and notes that The Monkey King 3 is missing its opportunity to make the female characters \"active-not-reactive\".\nChinese critic Raymond Zhou regards The Monkey King 3 as inferior to its predecessor, The Monkey King 2. He criticized that the CGI effect is more credible than the story is and that both of two romantic leads have no chemistry. He commented that Feng Shaofeng's performance is reliable among leads.\nFilm critic Derek Elley, however, credits The Monkey King 3 as \"the most engaging of the three films on a character level, with a relaxed tone and often silly humour that also help to bolster its \"human\" face\". Xuanzang's role is \"always a difficult one to bring off amid such colourful company (Aaron Kwok, Xiaoshenyang, and Luo Zhongqian)\", but Feng Shaofeng \"manages to make Xuanzang sympathetic\"; Zhao fails to \"dominate the film as her character should\"; Gigi Leung \"grabs the spotlight\" while her character is not \"fully-drawn\"; Lin Zhiling \"has a couple of memorable moments in the CGI-heavy finale\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
