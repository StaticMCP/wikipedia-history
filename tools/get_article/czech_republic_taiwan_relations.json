Kubera's successor, Miloš Vystrčil, however, led a delegation to Taiwan that arrived in Taipei on August 31, 2020. While there, Vystrčil gave a speech, declaring \"I am a Taiwanese,\" echoing John F. Kennedy's famous \"I am a Berliner\" speech. The People's Republic of China said that Vystrčil would \"pay a heavy price\" for visiting what it considers to be a \"renegade province\". Meanwhile, the President of the Czech Republic Miloš Zeman said of the trip that “I consider it boyish provocation.”\nIn late October 2021, Taiwan's foreign minister Joseph Wu received a medal from the President of the Czech Senate Miloš Vystrčil.\nIn July 2022, You Si-kun, the President of the Taiwan's Legislative Yuan, led a delegation to visit the Czech Republic. He also delivered a speech at the Czech Senate, declaring \"I am Taiwanese; I am Czech, because we are both believers of democracy.\"\nTies appeared to deepen in 2023 when Czech Republic's President-elect Petr Pavel spoke with Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen. In March a 150-member delegation headed by President of the Chamber of Deputies Markéta Pekarová Adamová visited Taiwan. In June Hsu Tzong-li, the President of Taiwan's Judicial Yuan, visited the Czech Republic and met with his counterpart Pavel Rychetsky, the President of the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic.\nIn March 2024, Taiwanese vice president-elect Hsiao Bi-khim was invited by think tank Sinopsis to visit the Czech Republic. She stopped in Prague following a trip to the United States and met with Miloš Vystrčil.\nIn October 2024, former Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen visited the Czech Republic and delivered a speech at the Forum 2000, during which she met with Czech president Petr Pavel, Czech Senate president Miloš Vystrčil, and president of the Chamber of Deputies Markéta Pekarová.\nTrade and economic relations\nTaiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn runs its largest European operations in the Czech Republic, the company's European Union (EU) hub. The subsidiary, named Foxconn CZ, is by profit one of largest companies in the Czech Republic.\nIn August 2020, Czech Senate President Miloš Vystrčil traveled to Taiwan on an official visit to \"promote business links\" between the two countries.\nAs part of the Business Opportunities Promotion Plan, CzechInvest opened its Taipei office in May 2024, and the Czech Centre Taipei held its ceremony in June.\nIn August-September 2024, Taiwanese National Security Council secretary-general Joseph Wu led a delegation to the GLOBSEC Forum held in Prague. He stated in a news conference that Taiwan was planning a semiconductor cluster in the Czech Republic. Separately in Taipei, the National Development Council made a statement that the Czech Chamber of Deputies proposed providing tax incentives to support Taiwanese investments in the Czech semiconductor industry.\nIn September 2024, the Taiwanese foreign ministry announced a joint Czech-Taiwanese semiconductor research center. The bilateral initiative includes a supply chain research center jointly managed by Charles University and National Chengchi University. Taiwanese economic minister J.W. Kuo visited the Czech Republic in December 2024 to promote industrial cooperation between the two countries. He witnessed the signing of a memorandum of understanding pledging to set up a trade and investment service hub in Prague, and he met with Senate President Vystrčil and other officials to discuss bilateral economic exchanges.\nHumanitarian aid\nIn 2022, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Taiwanese government donated US$1 million to Czech nonprofit group People in Need to provide services and assistance to displaced Ukrainian children in the Czech Republic.\nIn February 2025, People in Need and the Taiwanese foreign ministry signed a memorandum of understanding to assist Ukrainian refugees in the Czech Republic. The memorandum established a joint project in which People in Need would provide shelter for young Ukrainians fleeing the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War.\nSports\nIn the lead-up to the 2024 WBSC Premier12, the national teams of the two countries played two warm-up games at Taipei Dome. As friendly gestures, Czech player Marek Chlup walked onto the field draped in the Taiwanese flag, while Taiwanese captain Chen Chieh-hsien carried the Czech flag.\nPublic health cooperation\nIn March 2020, the Czech Republic and Taiwan signed an official partnership to fight COVID-19, the first such agreement signed by Taiwan.\nIn April 2021, Taiwan's foreign ministry thanked the Czech Republic for supporting Taiwan's bid to participate in World Health Assembly. The Czech Senate unanimously passed a resolution calling for Taiwan to take part in all divisions of the World Health Organization. It's the first time such a motion has progressed in a legislative chamber in the country.\nAfter the 2021 South Moravia tornado, Taiwan donated 6.5 million Czech koruna to the affected villages.\nIn August 2021, Taiwan received 30,000 doses of Moderna vaccine donated by Czech Republic.\nPrague–Taipei relations\nZdeněk Hřib and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Taiwan Joseph Wu on 1 April 2019]]\nIn August 1968, the Republic of China (Taiwan) was among the ten members of the United Nations Security Council to condemn the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia led by the Soviet Union, the latter of whom opposed the resolution.\nIn 2019, Czech Republic–Taiwan relations warmed when the Prague city council under Mayor Zdeněk Hřib voted to cancel sister city relations with Beijing due to the unwillingness of Beijing to renegotiate the inclusion of a \"One-China policy\" clause. While respecting the policy itself, Prague deemed inappropriate to express national policy in a sister city agreement. On January 13, 2020, Prague and Taipei became sister cities.\nSee also\n*Foreign relations of Taiwan\n*Foreign relations of the Czech Republic\n*List of diplomatic missions of the Czech Republic\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.mzv.cz/taipei/en/index.html Czech Economic and Cultural Office]\n*[http://www.roc-taiwan.org/cz/ Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in the Czech Republic]"
