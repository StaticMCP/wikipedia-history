The Chamber has around 450 member businesses, representing not only Swedish companies but also British and European companies interested in strengthening their existing ties with Sweden and the UK or expanding to new markets. The Swedish Chamber of Commerce for the UK is the oldest and largest foreign Swedish Chamber in the world, and also one of the largest foreign Chambers in the UK.\nYoung Professionals of the Swedish Chamber\nIn addition, a sub-organisation, the Young Professionals (YP), has approximately 100 individual Members, aged 25–35 with an interest in the Swedish-British business community.\nHistory\nThe subject of a London Chamber was first discussed in early 1906, when a number of meetings regarding the arrangement of a Swedish exhibition, led to the establishment of the Swedish Chamber of Commerce in London. The Board of Trade granted the Certificate of Incorporation and offices were hired at 136 Fenchurch Street. At the end of 1907 at least 189 members had been elected.\nFormer Chairmen\n* 1906–1915 Fred Löwenadler\n* 1915–1924 Harald Benedixson\n* 1924–1932 Axel Welin\n* 1932–1933 F Ljungberg\n* 1933–1941 B De Maré\n* 1941–1944 O Thott\n* 1944–1946 T Landby\n* 1946–1950 N H Leander\n* 1950–1959 S Frisell\n* 1959–1963 Torolf Lyth\n* 1963–1967 Torsten J Mosesson\n* 1967–1970 A A Flygt\n* 1970–1971 Hans L.
