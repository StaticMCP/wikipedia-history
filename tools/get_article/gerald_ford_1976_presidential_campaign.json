Ford and his running mate Senator Bob Dole were defeated by Democratic presidential nominee Jimmy Carter and vice presidential nominee Walter Mondale. Ford, a Republican president and former vice president under Nixon, launched his presidential bid on July 8, 1975, and secured nomination for his election to a full term on August 19, 1976. He was challenged in the Republican primaries by former California governor Ronald Reagan from his campaign which was formally launched on November 20, 1975, received more than forty percent of the delegates in the Republican National Convention, but Ford got more votes than Reagan. Reagan would later be elected president in 1980.\nFord's tenure marked America's fall into a dark period, with a stagnant economy and effects after the Vietnam War (or Vietnam syndrome). Ford pardoned Nixon in the Watergate scandal, which many people believe to be the reason for which Ford lost to his opponent Jimmy Carter in the 1976 presidential election. In the Republican primaries, Ford received 1,121 delegates while needing 1,130 votes to win. Ronald Reagan was one of those who stood in the way of Ford winning the nomination with Reagan receiving 1,078 delegates, this was one of the most controversial primaries ever, as well as the difference in votes of delegates and popular votes.\nHowever, Ford still received the Republican nomination on August 19, 1976, to face Democratic candidate Jimmy Carter on November 2, 1976. Carter defeated Ford, receiving 297 electoral votes and 50.1% of the popular vote. Carter took office on January 20, 1977, and held power for four years before Reagan defeated him in 1980 and took office on January 20, 1981.\nFord joined his vice presidential running mate Bob Dole on the campaign trail.\nBackground\nGerald Ford, born July 14, 1913, in Omaha, Nebraska, his maternal grandfather was Illinois politician and businessman Levi Addison Gardner and his paternal grandfather was banker and businessman Charles Henry King, Ford's parents separated Just sixteen days after his birth and his mother took the infant Ford to Oak Park, Illinois, Ford later said his biological father had a history of beating his mother.\nFord attended the University of Michigan. Ford graduated from Michigan in 1935 with a bachelor's degree in economics. He turned down offers from the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers of the National Football League. Instead, he took a job in September 1935 as a boxing coach and assistant football coach at Yale University and applied to its law school.\nFord joined the United States Navy after the Imperial Japanese attacked on Pearl Harbor, some time later, Ford joined the U.S. House of Representatives, where he met President Lyndon Johnson in 1963. After the resignation of Spiro Agnew, he was confirmed to become Nixon's vice president in December 1973 until he ascended to the presidency on August 9, 1974, when Nixon resigned, becoming the only president in American history to have never been elected president or vice president.\nNomination\n1976 Republican primaries\nFord launched his campaign on July 8, 1975, after which he entered the Republican primaries, where his rival, Ronald Reagan, opened his campaign on November 20, 1975. Ford and Reagan faced each other intensely, with Ford ultimately receiving more votes than Reagan, even though the required number of votes was 1,130 votes. This is also one of the few times an incumbent president has lost state primaries, the most recent being when President Joe Biden lost to Jason Palmer in American Samoa after 44 years when President Jimmy Carter lost to Ted Kennedy in Massachusetts on March 4, 1980, and 11 states with Washington D.C.\nIn the New Hampshire primary, Ford attacked Reagan's plan to cut $90 billion from the federal budget, as well as Reagan's plans for Social Security. Reagan's stump speeches included attacks on welfare queens, as well as other attacks on government welfare programs, Reagan then lost the primaries with 1,317 delegates remaining.\n1976 Republican National Convention\nAfter defeating their strongest opponents, Ford and Vice President Bob Dole were nominated at the Republican National Convention in Kansas City, Missouri, where Reagan criticized Ford for his signing of the Helsinki Accords and indirectly blamed him for the fall of Saigon in April 1975. The Convention voted, Ford received 1,187 votes and Reagan received 1,070 votes, another candidate, Elliot Richardson, received only 1 vote, this was one of the biggest controversies at the Republican convention about choosing a presidential candidate in a time of crisis. For the vice presidential candidate, Bob Dole received 1,921 votes, with an overwhelming margin of 85.04%. Ronald Reagan was also in this, but he only received 27 votes, the third lowest after Jesse Helms when he received 103 votes, the remaining candidates received less than 25 votes. Reagan then delivered a speech that caused a stir, eclipsing Ford's own acceptance speech, despite being just over five minutes long. Some delegates later said they left the convention wondering if they had voted for the wrong candidate. Reagan's concession speech spoke of the dangers of nuclear war and the threat from the Soviet Union.\nMain competitor\nJimmy Carter, a member of the Democratic Party as well as former Governor of Georgia and a peanut farmer, announced his 1976 presidential campaign on December 12, 1974, after which he participated in the presidential primaries of the Democratic Party and won 1,130 delegates, he then chose Walter Mondale as vice president at the 1976 Democratic National Convention, where he won the nomination to face Ford in the 1976 general election and would be inaugurated on January 20, 1977.\nEndorsements\nHere are the lists of Ford supporters in the presidential primaries:\nFederal Officials\n*Nelson Rockefeller Vice President of the United States\nFormer Federal Officials\n*Earl Butz former United States Secretary of Agriculture (1971–1976)\n*John Connally former United States Secretary of the Treasury (1971–1972)\n*Rogers Morton former Counselor to the President (1976)\nSenators\n*Howard Baker (R-TN)\n*Dewey F.

Carter won 297 electoral votes and 50.1% of the popular vote while Ford only received 240 electoral votes and 48.0% of the popular vote. However, Carter carried 23 states with Washington DC while Ford carried 27 states, this is one of the elections where the presidential candidate defeated the incumbent president in a narrow margin. Reagan got 1 vote from Washington by Mike Padden.\nBefore the election, both Ford and Carter also debated three times in Philadelphia, San Francisco and Williamsburg from September 23 to October 22, 1976. This is the second debate since 1960, after 16 years.\nThe vice presidential debate also began at the Alley Theater in Houston, Texas, when Bob Dole faced off against Walter Mondale.\nResults\n|pv_pct=—|ev=1}}\n|vp_state=}}\n|pv=158,724|pv_pct=0.19%|ev=0|vp_name=Rufus Shackelford|vp_state=Florida}}\nSources:  (popular votes)\n(Electoral votes)\nAftermath\nmeets with President-elect Jimmy Carter and Rosalynn Carter.]]\nCarter became president on January 20, 1977, and served one term in office until January 20, 1981, after Reagan defeated Carter in the 1980 U.S. presidential election.\nThis was the only modern presidential election in which both presidential candidates and both vice presidential candidates were still alive 30 years after the election, until Ford's death in 2006. And three of the four were still alive after 44 years, until Walter Mondale's death in April 2021. After Bob Dole's death in December 2021, Carter was the only candidate still alive until his death in December 2024.\nFord and Carter both lived post-presidency for more than 25 years. When Ford died in 2006 due to his worsening arteriosclerotic cerebrovascular disease and diffuse arteriosclerosis, Carter attended his funeral.\nSee also\n* 1976 Republican Party presidential primaries\n* 1976 Republican Party vice presidential candidate selection\n* 1976 Republican National Convention\n* 1976 United States presidential election\n* Jimmy Carter 1976 presidential campaign\n* Ronald Reagan 1976 presidential campaign\n* Presidency of Gerald Ford\nNotes\nReferences"
