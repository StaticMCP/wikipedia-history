H. Asquith sought a mandate for the People's Budget which had been presented by Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George, but had been rejected by the House of Lords. In the election as a whole, the Liberal Party lost its majority, and was dependent on the Irish Parliamentary Party, the breakaway All-for-Ireland League, and the Labour Party.\nA second election was held in December, with broadly similar results.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party || rowspan=\"2\"|Leader || colspan=\"3\"|Seats || colspan=\"3\"|Votes\n|-\n!# of Seats|| Seat Change || Uncontested || # of Votes || % of Votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Irish Parliamentary Party\n|John Redmond\n|70\n| 10\n|57\n|74,047\n|35.1\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Irish Unionist\n|Edward Carson\n|20\n| 4\n|8\n|68,982\n|32.7\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|All-for-Ireland League\n|William O'Brien\n|8\n|New\n|0\n|23,605\n|11.2\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Independent Nationalist\n|\n|3\n| 2\n|0\n|16,532\n|7.8\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Liberal Party\n|H.
