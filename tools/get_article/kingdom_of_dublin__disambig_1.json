It was the first and longest-lasting Norse kingdom in Ireland, founded by Vikings who invaded the territory around Dublin in the 9th century. Its territory corresponded to most of present-day County Dublin.\nHistory\nThe first reference to the Vikings comes from the Annals of Ulster and the first entry for 841 AD reads: \"Pagans still on Lough Neagh\". It is from this date onward that historians get references to ship fortresses or longphorts being established in Ireland. The Vikings may have first over-wintered in 840–841 AD. The actual location of the longphort of Dublin is still a hotly debated issue. Norse rulers of Dublin were often co-kings, and occasionally also Kings of Jórvík in what is now Yorkshire. Under their rule, Dublin became a significant port in trading slaves. The hinterland of Dublin in the Norse period was named in .\nOver time, the settlers in Dublin became increasingly Gaelicized. They began to exhibit a great deal of Gaelic and Norse cultural syncretism, and are often referred to as Norse-Gaels.\nIn 988, Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill led the initial Gaelic conquest of Dublin. As a result, the founding of Dublin is counted by some from the year 988, although a village had existed on the site of Dublin nearly a thousand years earlier.\nCoins were minted in Dublin by about 995, and on Mann by about 1025.\nIn the mid-11th century, the Kingdom of Leinster began exerting influence over Dublin. The last king of Dublin was killed by the Norman conquerors of Dublin in 1171.\nGeography\nThe extent of the kingdom varied, but in peaceful times it extended roughly as far as Wicklow () in the south, Glen Ding near Blessington, Leixlip () west of Dublin, and Skerries, County Dublin () to the north. The Fingal area north of Dublin was named after the Norse who lived there.\nKings of Dublin\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
