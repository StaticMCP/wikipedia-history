During the World War II, the refinery was bombed. After it had ceased to operation in 1991, a group of art workers moved in and revived the building with the help of Taitung County Government. It was then transformed into showrooms and studios.\nArchitecture\nThe culture park consists of bed and breakfast, handicraft shop, coffee house etc. It is mostly made of pebbles, steel bars and driftwood.\nEvents\nThe culture park regularly holds various events such as live concerts and dances.\nSee also\n* List of tourist attractions in Taiwan\nReferences"
