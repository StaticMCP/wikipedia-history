After the Geneva Frequency Plan went in service on November 22–23, 1978, it broadcast on 1260&nbsp;kHz with a power of 160&nbsp;kW and was therefore receivable at night time in all of Europe.\nThe Warszewo transmitter, which used as its antenna a 113&nbsp;metres tall guyed mast radiator insulated against ground, stopped medium wave broadcasting on January 2, 1998. The mast was transformed afterwards into a mast for FM transmission, whereby its height increased to 114&nbsp;metres. The basement insulator was bridged and its guys, divided by insulators,  were replaced by guys without insulators.\nTransmitted programmes\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Program\n! Frequency\n!
