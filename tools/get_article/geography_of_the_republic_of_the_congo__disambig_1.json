Congo claims  of territorial sea.\nThe capital of the Republic of the Congo is Brazzaville, located on the Congo River immediately across from Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. With a metropolitan population of approximately 1.5 million, Brazzaville is by far the largest city in the Republic, having almost twice the population of Pointe-Noire (663,400 as of the 2005 census), the country's second largest city. About 70% of the population lives in Brazzaville, Pointe-Noire, or along the railroad between them.\nArea and boundaries\n; Area:\n:* Total: 342,000 km²\n:**country rank in the world: 54th\n:* Land: 341,500 km²\n:* Water: 500 km²\n; Area comparative\n:* Australia comparative: approximately  times the size of Victoria\n:* Canada comparative: approximately  smaller than Newfoundland and Labrador\n:* United Kingdom comparative: approximately  larger than the United Kingdom\n:* United States comparative: approximately twice the size of Florida\n:* EU comparative: slightly smaller than Germany\n; Land boundaries:\n:* Total:\n:* Border countries: Cabinda (Angola) (), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (), Central African Republic (), Cameroon (), Gabon ().\n; Coastline: 169&nbsp;km on Atlantic Ocean\nEnvironment\nClimate\nCongo is a tropical nation, which means it has a tropical climate. The wet season lasts from March to June and the dry season for the rest of the year. Temperature and humidity are high as in all tropical nations. The rivers of the country are flooded seasonally.\n|source 2=Meteo Climat (record highs and lows)\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n}}\nRetrieved on November 24, 2011.\n|date=November 2011\n}}\nEcology\nThe terrain is a variation of coastal plains, mountainous regions, plateaus and fertile valleys. About 70 percent of the country's area is covered by rain forest. The highest point, at 1,020 m, is Mont Nabeba in the Mayumbe mountains. The major rivers are the Congo River at the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Kouilou-Niari River.\nA 2014 expedition leaving from Itanga village discovered a peat bog \"as big as England\" which stretches into neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo.\nUNESCO has declared two world biosphere reserves in the country: Odzala in 1977 and Dimonika in 1988.\nNatural resources\nNatural resources include petroleum, timber, potash, lead, zinc, uranium, copper, phosphates, gold, magnesium, natural gas, and hydropower.\nAs of a 2012 estimate, 1.55% of the land is arable, while only 0.20% contains permanent crops. Approximately 20&nbsp;km² is irrigated (2003 estimation).\nEnvironmental issues\nEnvironmental issues include the high level of air pollution from vehicle emissions, water pollution from the dumping of raw sewage, tap water not being potable, and deforestation.\nCongo is party to the international agreements on Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Ozone Layer Protection, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands. It has signed but not ratified the Law of the Sea and so on.\nExtreme points\nThis is a list of the extreme points of the Republic of Congo, i.e. the points that are farther north, south, east, or west than any other location.\n*Northernmost point — unnamed location on the border with Central African Republic immediately south-west of the CAR town of Madoukou, Likouala department\n*Easternmost point — Motenge-Bom, Likouala department\n*Southernmost point — unnamed headland near the point at which the Congo-Cabinda border enters the Atlantic Ocean, Kouilou department\n*Westernmost point — the point at which the border with Gabon enters the Atlantic Ocean, Kouilou department\nNotes\nReferences\n*\nSee also\n* Geology in the Republic of the Congo\npt:Congo#Geografia"
