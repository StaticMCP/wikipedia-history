      "text": "# Colonial States Athletic Conference\n\nThe Colonial States Athletic Conference (CSAC) was an NCAA Division III collegiate athletic conference in the Mid-Atlantic United States that existed from 1992 to 2023. There were nine full member institutions when the conference.  The conference's membership, as with most Middle Atlantic conferences, was shaken as a result of the formation of the Landmark Conference and its ensuing domino effect.  The conference, founded in 1992 as the Pennsylvania Athletic Conference, changed its name in 2008.\nThe CSAC experienced another shakeup in 2018 when five members departed the conference to join with two other institutions to form a new Division III conference that eventually became the Atlantic East Conference. In July 2018, the CSAC added two new members. The conference added its 10th member on July 1, 2019, and its 11th on the same day in 2020, but was reduced to 10 members when on June 18, 2021, Centenary University published its move to Atlantic East, starting July 1 that year, but its lacrosse teams would start competing in their new conference's 2022 season.\nOn December 19, 2022, the United East Conference and the Colonial States Athletic Conference announced their intent to merge beginning with the 2023–24 academic year. The conference officially ceased to exist when its ten remaining members were absorbed by the United East Conference on July 1, 2023.\nHistory\n| nolabels = 1\n| title = Colonial States Athletic Conference\n| mark-coord  =  |label=Bryn Athyn      |label-pos  =  top   | mark  = Blue pog.svg  | label-color  = black\n| mark-coord1 =  |label1=Cairn  |label-pos1 = right   | mark1 = Blue pog.svg  | label-color1 = black\n| mark-coord2 =  |label2=Cedar Crest     |label-pos2 = top   | mark2 = Blue pog.svg  | label-color2 = black\n| mark-coord3 =  |label3=Clark Summit |label-pos3 = bottom  | mark3 = Blue pog.svg  | label-color3 = black\n| mark-coord4 =  |label4=Keystone |label-pos4 = top   | mark4 = Blue pog.svg  | label-color4 = black\n| mark-coord5 =  |label5=Notre Dame |label-pos5 = top   | mark5 = Blue pog.svg  | label-color5 = black\n| mark-coord6 =  |label6=Rosemont |label-pos6 = left   | mark6 = Blue pog.svg  | label-color6 = black\n| mark-coord7 =  |label7=St. Elizabeth |label-pos7 = bottom   | mark7 = Blue pog.svg  | label-color7 = black\n| mark-coord8 =  |label8=Valley Forge |label-pos8 = left   | mark8 = Blue pog.svg  | label-color8 = black\n| mark-coord9 =  |label9=Wilson |label-pos9 = right   | mark9 = Blue pog.svg  | label-color9 = black\n| zoom = 7\n| caption = Location of CSAC members: 10px full\n}}\nChronological timeline\n* 1991 – On November 4, 1991, the CSAC was founded as the Pennsylvania Athletic Conference (PAC).
