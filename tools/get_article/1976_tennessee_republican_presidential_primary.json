It was one of several late-May contests between incumbent President Gerald Ford and former California Governor Ronald Reagan.\nAlthough President Gerald Ford narrowly won the statewide popular vote, receiving about 49.8% to Ronald Reagan’s 49.1%, the state’s delegate rules produced a different outcome. Tennessee Republicans selected delegates largely by congressional district, with three delegates awarded per district, in addition to statewide. Reagan’s campaign performed better at the district level, winning more congressional districts or winning the districts by slightly larger margins. Because delegates were distributed proportionally within districts (rather than strictly statewide), Reagan was able to secure an extra delegate even though Ford’s statewide vote total was slightly higher.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2;margin-bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:0.2em 0.4em;\" |1976 Tennessee Republican presidential primary\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" |Candidate\n!Votes\n!%\n!Delegates\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Gerald Ford (incumbent)\n|120,685\n|49.76%\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |21\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Ronald Reagan\n|118,997\n|49.06%\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |22\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Uncommitted\n|2,764\n|1.14%\n| rowspan=\"1\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Write-ins\n|97\n|0.04%\n| rowspan=\"1\"\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n!Total\n!242,543\n!100.00%\n!43\n|}\nSee also\n* 1976 Republican Party presidential primaries\n* 1976 Tennessee Democratic presidential primary\n* 1976 New Hampshire Republican presidential primary\n* 1976 New Jersey Republican presidential primary\n* 1976 United States presidential election in Tennessee\nReferences"
