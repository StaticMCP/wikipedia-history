Bahlol Khan set out with and army of 12,000 men to check Maratha offensive and reached Umarani (45 km west of Bijapur). Shivaji, who was at Panhala learnt about the advance of Bijapur army and dispatched Prataprao Gujar and Anandrao with 10,000 to 15,000 army.\nBattle\nMaratha Army reached Umarani within 2 days and cut the enemy off from their water supply. According to Basatslin-us Salatin, Marathas numbered from 10,000 to 15,000 encircled Bholal Khan (other sources do not mention this event).\nThe battle that followed was confined for some time to arrows and firearms. Khan was at a great disadvantage as the Marathas had cut off his water supply and April's heat began to take effect. At sunset Khan made an effort to break out. This led to hand to hand fighting with Marathas in which Adilshahi officer Mahammad Barqi was killed and an elephant was captured.\nPrataprao allowed Bhalol Khan to retire as he begged that he will never raise a war against Marathas. When Shivaji learnt about this he taunted Prataprao for making peace with enemy.\nAftermath\nThe Marathas entered Hubli on 16th April. They made the company's house its target and started plundering. Clothes were brought to Prataprao. While plundering, Marathas accidentally set fire to a workshop, leading to an explosion in which 20 Marathas were killed.\nThey suffered losses including copper plates, lead, paper, and cloth, as well as cash. Besides this they lost 5200 soldiers.\nWhile plundering, Marathas learned about the approach of Muzaffar Khan with 4000-5000 cavalry. They departed with what they already packed up.\nReferences"
