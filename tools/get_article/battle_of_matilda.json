Men of the Dundas Militia and Grenville Militia guarded the shoreline from Prescott to the Long Sault rapids, and closely monitored any movement on the New York shore. The militia also assisted supply convoys, providing protection for the boats travelling from Cornwall to Kingston.\nThe New York militia began to muster and likewise served duty along the banks of the river, and began to plan raids across the river.\nBattle\nOn September 16, 1812, soldiers from the 1st Flank Company of the 1st Dundas Regiment under Capt. Michael Ault and Ens. Duncan Clark, as well as soldiers under Maj. Rowland Heathcote from the Royal Newfoundland Regiment, were escorting a shipment of supplies from Montreal to Kingston when they were attacked in the St. Lawrence River near Matilda by 500 American Militia, under the command of Capt. Griffin, who were hiding on Toussaint Island.\nA company of the Dundas Militia under Ens. Clark landed on Presqu'ile Island just as an American force landed on the same island and a sharp exchange of fire occurred. The Americans were pinned down by accurate fire from the Dundas men, concealed amongst the bushes and trees, and they were forced to retreat back to Toussaint's Island. During their hasty retreat, one of the American boats drifted away from their force and was captured by the Dundas militia. The boat contained 7 muskets, 2 swords, and a number of necessary provisions.\nSoon, drawn to the noise of battle, more Dundas militiamen arrived on Presqu'ile to bolster the Canadian positions in case of a second invasion. Col. Allan MacDonell in command of the Dundas Militia, along with Capt. Shaver and Capt. Ault were joined by two companies of Grenville Militia under Capts. Monroe and Dulmage and Lt. Richard Duncan Fraser who brought along a 9-pounder artillery piece from Prescott that had originally been captured during the Battle of the Thousand Islands. After a few rounds of fire from the cannon and muskets, the Americans abandoned the island and retreated across the St. Lawrence River to the New York side.\nOrder of battle\nBritish forces\n*1st Regiment of Dundas Militia – Col.
