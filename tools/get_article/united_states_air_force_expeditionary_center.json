Courses include the Air Force Phoenix Raven Training, Advanced Study of Air Mobility and Aerial Port Operations Course.\nHistory\nThe unit began when it was constituted as the Military Airlift Command Airlift Operations School on 5 July 1978 and activated on 15 July 1978.  It was later redesignated as the USAF Air Mobility School on 1 June 1992, the Air Mobility Warfare Center on 1 October 1994, and the USAF Expeditionary Center on 5 March 2007.\nInitially offering a variety of courses, from combat readiness exercises to cargo and passenger transportation training, the center played a pivotal role in enhancing the capabilities of the Air Mobility Command.\nSubsequently, on January 7, 2011, the center's scope was expanded to encompass additional responsibilities related to the evolving mission sets of the Air Mobility Command. Further expansion occurred in the spring of 2012 when the center assumed administrative control over three additional air wings, including the sole Contingency Response wing within the Air Force.\nThrough 5 September 2025, the Expeditionary Center provided command and control for three air base units (the 87th Air Base Wing, the 627th Air Base Group, and the 628th Air Base Wing), three air mobility operations units (the 43d Air Mobility Operations Group, the 515th Air Mobility Operations Wing, and the 521st Air Mobility Operations Wing), and the 621st Contingency Response Wing. Following the activation of Twenty-First Air Force, AMC reassigned these units between 18 AF and 21 AF.\nUSAF Expeditionary Operations School\nThe USAF Expeditionary Operations School (“EOS”) of the USAF Expeditionary Center, is for mobility and expeditionary operations skills training and Air Mobility Command's provider of support to the mobility enterprise.\nThe EOS offers a variety of training, from combat support to logistics. The EOS is responsible for advanced leadership training, including Advanced Studies of Air Mobility Course and the Director of Mobility Forces Course.0\nThe EOS offers 74 in-resident courses and graduates approximately 40,000 students per year from the Expeditionary Center main campus at ASA Fort Dix, Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, NJ, from the mobile training team class and from detachments Hurlburt Air Force Base, FL, and Scott Air Force Base, IL.\nList of commanders\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|\n!colspan=2|Commander\n!colspan=3|Term\n|-\n!Portrait\n!Name\n!Took office\n!Left office\n!Term length\n}}\n| officeholder_sort =\n| born_year         =\n| died_year         =\n| term_start        = 14 April 1995\n| term_end          = 21 August 1997\n| timeinoffice      =\n}}\n| officeholder_sort =\n| born_year         =\n| died_year         =\n| term_start        = 21 August 1997\n| term_end          = 5 August 1999\n| timeinoffice      =\n}}\n| officeholder_sort =\n| born_year         =\n| died_year         =\n| term_start        = 5 August 1999\n| term_end          = 2 June 2000\n| timeinoffice      =\n}}\n| acting            = y\n}}\n| officeholder_sort =\n| born_year         =\n| died_year         =\n| term_start        = 16 June 2000\n| term_end          = 26 July 2002\n| timeinoffice      =\n}}\n| officeholder_sort =\n| born_year         =\n| died_year         =\n| term_start        = 26 July 2002\n| term_end          = 12 May 2005\n| timeinoffice      =\n}}\n| officeholder_sort =\n| born_year         =\n| died_year         =\n| term_start        = 12 May 2005\n| term_end          = 23 May 2007\n| timeinoffice      =\n}}\n| officeholder_sort =\n| born_year         =\n| died_year         =\n| term_start        = 23 May 2007\n| term_end          = 19 October 2009\n| timeinoffice      =\n}}\n}}\n| officeholder_sort =\n| born_year         =\n| died_year         =\n| term_start        = 2 October 2010\n| term_end          = 29 July 2013\n| timeinoffice      =\n}}\n| officeholder_sort =\n| born_year         =\n| died_year         =\n| term_start        = 29 July 2013\n| term_end          = 9 September 2013\n| timeinoffice      =\n| acting            = y\n}}\n| officeholder_sort =\n| born_year         =\n| died_year         =\n| term_start        = 9 September 2013\n| term_end          = 2 August 2016\n| timeinoffice      =\n}}\n| officeholder_sort =\n| born_year         =\n| died_year         =\n| term_start        = 2 August 2016\n| term_end          = 9 August 2018\n| timeinoffice      =\n}}\n| officeholder_sort =\n| born_year         =\n| died_year         =\n| term_start        = 9 August 2018\n| term_end          = 23 September 2020\n| timeinoffice      =\n}}\n| officeholder_sort =\n| born_year         =\n| died_year         =\n| term_start        = 23 September 2020\n| term_end          = 17 August 2022\n| timeinoffice      =\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
