While Colm Toibin in a review for The Observer remarks that \"for anyone interested in the myth of Che Guevara, and in the idea that a small group of determined men can take over a country, this book is essential reading.\" Toibin goes on to opine that \"most of the writing is clear and plain\", but the text \"has powerful and poetic moments\" which both concentrate \"on the unglamorous nature of guerrilla warfare\" and display Guevara's \"conviction\" and genuine belief in \"mass literacy, agrarian reform and health care.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1963/reminiscences/reminiscences.pdf Full Text] by the Che Guevara Studies Center and Ocean Press\n* [http://www.monthlyreview.org/books/reminiscencesofcubanwar.php Reminiscences of the Cuban Revolutionary War] by Monthly Review\n* [http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/43b/098.html Che Guevara Describes \"Baptism Of Fire\"] book excerpts by The Militant"
