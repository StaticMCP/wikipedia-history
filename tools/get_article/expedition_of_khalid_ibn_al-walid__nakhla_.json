Khalid, at the head of thirty horsemen, arrived at the spot and destroyed the Goddess's religious statue.\nUpon his return, Muhammad asked him if he had seen anything else there, to which Khalid replied, \"No\". He was told that the statue had not been destroyed and that he must go back and fulfill the task. Khalid went again to Nakhlah and there saw a black Abyssinian (Ethiopian) woman, naked with disheveled hair. He struck her with his sword and cut her into \"two pieces\" murdering her, according to the Muslim scholar, Saifur Rahman al Mubarakpuri. He returned once again and narrated his story to Muhammad, who then confirmed the fulfillment of the task, saying that the murdered black Ethiopian woman was the real \"al-Uzza\".\n, p. 135 See bottom, Notes section\nSee also\n*Military career of Muhammad\nReferences"
