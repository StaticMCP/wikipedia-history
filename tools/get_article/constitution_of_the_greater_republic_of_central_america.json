The treaty was not a constitution for the nation and the republic's existed relied solely on each member's willingness to remain in the union.\nOn 27 August 1898, representatives met in Managua to draft and sign the constitution of the Greater Republic. The Constitution was ratified on 1 November 1898, officially changing the name of the country to the United States of Central America. With the ratification of the constitution, the Executive Federal Council was established in Amapala. The council was full of provisional members who scheduled a general election for sometime in December 1898 to elect members to the Executive Federal Council and to elect the first President of Central America which were set to take office sometime in March 1899.\nThe constitution was only effective for 29 days. On 13 November 1898, Salvadoran President Rafael Antonio Gutiérrez was overthrown by Tomás Regalado Sánchez which caused a crisis within the nation.
