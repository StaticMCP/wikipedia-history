The ward contains the Kensington and Fairfield areas of Liverpool.\nBackground\nThe ward was established in 1895 as Kensington ward and was renamed as Kensington & Fairfield following the 2003 local government boundary review.\n1953 ward boundary\nThe ward boundaries of Liverpool were changed in 1953.\nThe Kensington ward was largely unchanged from its previous iteration with only minor changes to better reflect the contemporary arrangement of the streets.\n1980 ward boundary\nThe ward boundary was changed for the 1980 elections. A report of the Local Government Boundary Commission for England published in November 1978 set out proposals for changes to the wards of Liverpool City Council, maintaining the number of councillors at 99 representing 33 wards. Kensington & Fairfield ward was represented by three councillors.\nThe report describes the boundaries of Kensington ward as \"Commencing at a point where West Derby Road meets Farnworth Street, thence northeastwards along said West Derby Road to Boundary Lane, thence northwestwards along said lane to the southern boundary of Breckfield Ward, thence northeastwards along said boundary to the southwestern boundary of Anfield Ward, thence southeastwards along said boundary, generally southeastwards\nalong the southwestern boundary of Tuebrook Ward and eastwards along the southern boundary of Tuebrook Ward to the southwestern boundary of Old Swan Ward, thence southeastwards along said boundary to the Edge Hill to Huyton railway line, thence southwestwards along said railway to Wavertree Road, thence northwestwards along said road to Botanic Road, thence northwestwards along said road to Edge Lane, thence generally southwestwards along said lane to Jubilee Drive, thence northwards along said drive and Farnworth Street to the point of commencement\".\n2004 ward boundary\nThe ward boundary was changed for the 2004 elections following a 2003 boundary review which saw the ward retain most of the former Kensington ward and small parts of the former Smithdown and Tuebrook wards.\nThe population of the 2004 ward taken at the 2011 census was 15,377, and at the 2021 census 16,522.\n2023 ward boundary\nThe ward boundaries were changed in 2023 following a review by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England which decided that the existing 30 wards each represented by three Councillors should be replaced by 64 wards represented by 85 councillors with varying representation by one, two or three councillors per ward. The Kensington and Fairfield ward remained a three-member ward. The ward boundaries retained most of the 2004 ward, losing a portion to the new Everton East ward, and gaining parts of the former Central and Tuebrook and Stoneycroft wards.\nThe population of the ward at the 2021 census was 19,585.\nCouncillors\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Election!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor\n|-\n| 2004\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| James Kendrick (LD)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Richard Marbrow (LD)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Frank Doran (LD)\n|-\n| 2006\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Louise Baldock (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Richard Marbrow (LD)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Frank Doran (LD)\n|-\n| 2007\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Louise Baldock (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Wendy Simon (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Frank Doran (LD)\n|-\n| 2008\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Louise Baldock (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Wendy Simon (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Liam Robinson (Lab)\n|-\n| 2010\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Louise Baldock (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Wendy Simon (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Liam Robinson (Lab)\n|-\n| 2011\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Louise Baldock (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Wendy Simon (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Liam Robinson (Lab)\n|-\n| 2012\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Louise Baldock (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Wendy Simon (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Liam Robinson (Lab)\n|-\n| 2014\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Sue Heron (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Wendy Simon (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Liam Robinson (Lab)\n|-\n| 2015\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Sue Heron (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Wendy Simon (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Liam Robinson (Lab)\n|-\n| 2016\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Sue Heron (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Wendy Simon (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Liam Robinson (Lab)\n|-\n| 2018\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Sue Walker (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Wendy Simon (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Liam Robinson (Lab)\n|-\n| 2019\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Sue Heron (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Wendy Simon (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Liam Robinson (Lab)\n|-\n| 2021\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Sue Heron (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|| Wendy Simon (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Liam Robinson (Lab)\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\" bgcolor=\"#FFF\"| WARD REFORMED\n|-\n| 2023\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Liz Parsons (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Wendy Simon (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Liam Robinson (Lab)\n|}\nindicates seat up for re-election after boundary changes.\nindicates seat up for re-election.\nindicates change in affiliation.\nindicates seat up for re-election after casual vacancy.\nElection results\nElections of the 2020s\n}}\n}}\n2.33\n}}\n4.68\n}}\n0.07\n}}\n3.55\n}}\n3.97\n}}\n5.98\n}}\n1.72\n}}\n1.77\n}}\nElections of the 2010s\n}}\n6.54\n}}\nN/A\n}}\n2.77\n}}\n1.19\n}}\n0.96\n}}\n1.04\n}}\n2.52\n}}\n6.37\n}}\n1.67\n}}\n0.09\n}}\n}}\n5.09\n}}\n|votes      = 179\n|percentage = 7.70%\n|change     =  1.56\n}}\nN/A\n}}\n0.97\n}}\n1.75\n}}\n0.37\n}}\n7.96\n}}\n3.61\n}}\n1.76\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\nElections of the 2000s\n}}\n}}\n}}\nAfter the boundary change of 2004 the whole of Liverpool City Council faced election.
