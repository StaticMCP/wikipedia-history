On his death the gold is remodelled as a ring, which is handed down from generation to generation until it is eventually inherited by the mother of Abraham Lincoln. The young Abe, using it as a sinker for his fishing line, loses it in a crick and is distraught.  On her deathbed, Abe's mother recognises the potential for kingliness in her young son and dies content, realising that the ring is needed no more.\nIn an epilogue to the novel, set many years later, three men stand watching the funeral cortège after Lincoln's death. \"There goes the first American\" says one. The young British attaché replies, \"I dare say you are right, Professor, but I think it is also the last of the Kings.\"\nCritical reception\nAlthough a favourite of GM Trevelyan, other early critics of the book were less enthusiastic. The Times Literary Supplement considered the work \"disappointing\", and criticised it for its \"pseudo-romantic vocabulary\" and \"the use of slightly pretentious and unusual words and locutions where common and more vigorous ones would serve better\".\nIn ''The Interpreter's House (1975), David Daniell noted that The Path of the King'' marked the beginning of Buchan's historical writing. He considered the 'feel' of the many atmospheres to be well done, and the narratives to be 'fresh and good'.\nIn his 2009 essay John Buchan, America and the ‘British World’, 1904-40 Peter Henshaw suggested that Buchan had the implicit purpose of fostering Anglo-American unity, and that his aim in writing the novel was to build up Lincoln as a shared hero of the British and American people. He took the epilogue as being a restatement of the view that Lincoln's highest achievement was his defence of the American Union, \"a grand geopolitical association comparable in Buchan's mind to the British Empire\".\nWriting for the John Buchan Society website, JCG Greig suggested that the fascination of this book grows on the reader gradually, and that in order to grasp the consistency of the tale little clues have to be looked for constantly.  Buchan presents Lincoln's Presidency in the American Civil War as nothing less than kingly. The choice of Lincoln, the product of ordinary parents, proclaims that kingliness does not depend upon outward trappings but on inward riches. Greig considered it a book \"especially for the historically minded to dwell on and even drool over\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1966 The Path of the King] at Project Gutenberg"
