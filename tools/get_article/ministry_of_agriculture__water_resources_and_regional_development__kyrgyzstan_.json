The ministry has its roots from the Soviet Union's Ministry of Agriculture and Food and Ministry of Food Industry, although both ministries did not directly preceded the current ministry.\nThe vast majority of the economy in rural Kyrgyz Republic is agricultural based, which includes crops cultivation and animal husbandry, thus the ministry is essential in ensuring sustained agricultural outputs and improved standards of living of citizens in these areas. The agriculture industry also contributes to approximately 15% of the republic's GDP, thus the policies implemented by the ministry also has large implications on the economy of the country. However, there has been criticisms of the ministry in being inadequate in tackling the decreased efficiency and productivity of this industry, due to the lack of clear policy recommendations by the ministry as well as the low rate of assets renewal in the industry.\nThe ministry has thus partnered several international organisations in combating these various agricultural and environmental problems. Several of these organisations include the International Fund for Agricultural Development and United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification.\nSee also\n* Agriculture in Kyrgyzstan\nReferences"
