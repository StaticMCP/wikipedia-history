The station, situated  south-west of Whitby, serves the village of Ruswarp in North Yorkshire, England. It is owned by Network Rail and managed by Northern Trains.\nHistory\nThe line through Ruswarp was opened in June 1835, as the initial section of the Whitby and Pickering Railway between Whitby and . The station first appears in a timetable for May 1848, though it was used before that; in July 1835, over 1,000 people were carried between Pickering and Ruswarp for the Ruswarp Fair Day.|name=Openings|group=note}}\nThe main railway building, which remains to this day and is now grade II listed, was designed by the architect G T Andrews and was built in 1850 at the request of the York and North Midland Railway who owned the line through acquisition. Immediately to the west of the station is an automatic barrier level crossing and a lattice-work iron bridge over the River Esk. The original Whitby and Pickering Railway bridge was made from Baltic pine and covered a distance of , crossing the river on a diagonal compared to its flow. The design of the station was similar to that at  railway station, but with Tudor arches and Tudor chimneys.\nBehind the main station building was a three-road goods yard, with a connection facing towards Whitby. The yard was listed as forwarding flour and bran as it chief commodities - the village had a large mill powered by the river. A camping coach was positioned here by the North Eastern Region from 1959 to 1964. A second goods siding was located just across the river (on the south bank) with access to both directions of the running line. This was Sneathonthopre Siding and dealt mostly with cattle. Both goods sidings were closed in early August 1965.\nIn the early 1980s, rationalisation of the Esk Valley Line led to the singling of the line between Grosmont and Whitby. The down line through the station was kept open, whilst the up line and platform were removed. The signal box was kept open as control for the level crossing until 1986 when it was automated.\nServices\nAs of the May 2021 timetable change, the station is served by five trains per day (four on Sunday) towards Whitby. Heading towards Middlesbrough via Nunthorpe, there are four trains per day. Most trains continue to Newcastle via Hartlepool. All services are operated by Northern Trains.\nRolling stock used: Class 156 Super Sprinter and Class 158 Express Sprinter\n|previous=|route=Northern Trains|col= }}\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\nExternal links"
