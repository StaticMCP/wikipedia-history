The final was broadcast on BBC1 and BBC Radio 2 with commentary by Ken Bruce, while the results show was broadcast on BBC1.\nAfter the UK only achieved a low top ten finish the previous year, the BBC returned to a format last seen in 1991 where different acts performed, each song was also introduced by a Eurovision style \"postcard\" style video showcasing the song writers introduced by Jonathan King. The panel was adapted into a famous celebrity \"supporter\", with the public televote remaining.\nCompeting entries\nBBC collaborated with music producer Jonathan King to select eight finalists to compete in the national final. The eight competing songs were premiered during the Top of the Pops Song for Europe Special on BBC1 on 24 March 1995.\nFinal\nEight acts competed in the televised final on 31 March 1995.
