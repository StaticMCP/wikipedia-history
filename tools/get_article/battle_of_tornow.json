His cavalry, the 3rd Hussars, were successful in driving off the Swedish horse but the Swedish infantry weathered six assaults by the Prussians and a probe towards Fehrbellin was pushed back.  Wedel withdrew from the field, granting the Swedish army a rare victory in the campaign.  Casualties were 153 men on the Prussian side and 162 men on the Swedish side.  The Swedes evacuated their forward posts in the area in the aftermath of the battle, considering them too exposed to Prussian attack.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Battle of tornow\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of Tornow"
