It was held after 2018 Senate election. Civic Democratic Party nominated Jaroslav Kubera, Mayors and Independents nominated Jan Horník and Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People's Party nominated Václav Hampl. Incumbent President Milan Štěch doesn't seek reelection. It was the first time in the history of the Senate that more than 2 candidates run for the position. Senate factions usually came to an agreement about the new President in the past.\nJaroslav Kubera and Václav Hampl advanced to the second round. Kubera then defeated Hampl with 46 votes to 24 and became the new Senate President. His victory was considered a surprise as it was expected that Mayors and Independents and Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People's Party will support other party's Candidate against Kubera in the second round. Kubera's victory was attributed to Kubera's Charisma and strategy of his Party.\nBackground\nPrior 2018 Senate election it was believed that Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People's Party will become largest senate party and its nominee will replace Milan Štěch as the president of the Senate. Václav Hampl was speculated as the likeliest candidate as he was offered the position by the party. It was viewed as an unwritten rule that a representative of the largest Senate faction holds the position of the president of the Senate.\nThe Civic Democratic Party eventually won the election and was tied with Mayors and Independents in the position of largest Senate faction. Leader of the Civic Democratic Party stated that he considers Jaroslav Kubera as the most logical candidate for the Senate president. Kubera was endorsed by Miloš Zeman. Kubera himself stated that party's nomination would be an Honor for him but noted that it isn't something that he couldn't live without. He stated that he believes that all parties should keep the rule that President of the Senate comes from the largest faction.\nMayors and Independents declined to support Kubera as he didn't view him as a counterbalance to the President Miloš Zeman. Christian Democrats also declined Kubera. Both parties didn't like Kubera's previous politically incorrect statements and his strongly right-wing stances. Mayors and Independents announced on 23 October 2018 that it would nominate Jiří Růžička as its candidate. The Civic Democratic Party announced it could withdraw Kubera's nomination if other parties agreed to their terms. Civic Democrats were negative towards Růžička's nomination.\nChristian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People's Party announced on 31 October 2018 it would nominate Václav Hampl. Christian Democrats also announced they are prepared to uphold Hampl by force. Mayors and Independents criticised Hampl's candidacy as Christian Democrats have only 15 Senators while Civic Democrats and Mayors and Independents both have 18 senators. Mayors and Independents decided withdrawn Růžička's nomination and nominated Jan Horník instead.\nANO 2011 announced on 2 November 2018 that its senators will support Kubera's candidacy. Civic Democrats also negotiated with the Czech Social Democratic Party and Senator 21 about possible support for Kubera. Václav Hampl on the other hand was endorsed by leader of Senator 21 Václav Láska. Leader of Mayors and Independents admitted on 4 November 2018 that it is possible that his party won't find an agreement with Civic Democrats and the election could become a \"shot up.\"\nPolitical scientist Lukáš Jelínek noted on 6 November 2018 that Kubera's chances to become the new Senate President were very low but grew due to negotiations of Civic Democrats with Social Democrats and ANO 2011. Chances of Jan Horník to become new Senate President are viewed by Jelínek as low.\nCivic Democrats announced on 6 November 2018 that they will stand after Kubera as its candidate. Horník attacked Kubera and stated that he would support Hampl against Kubera if they face each other in the second round. Kubera was at the time supported by his party and ANO 2011. Part of Czech Social Democratic Party faction also supported him. Hampl had support of most of Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People's Party faction and most of Senator 21 senators. Horník was supported by his party. Representatives of ODS, STAN and KDU-ČSL senate factions met on 7. November 2018 but didn't come to an agreement.\nA of 8 November 2018, Kubera had support of ODS and ANO 2011 faction with 24 votes. Hampl had support of KDU-ČSL and SEN 21 faction with 21 votes. Horník was supported by STAN faction with 18 votes. ČSSD faction was split between candidates. It was believed due to the faction endorsements that Kubera and Hampl will advance to the second round. No candidate was viewed as the clear front-runner.\nKubera, Hampl and Horník met on a debate held by Česká televize on 10 November 2018. Kubera stated that his main advantage are his political experiences. He stated that he runs because position of the president of the Senate would allow him to fight Bureaucracy and growing freedom limitations more effectively. Hampl stated that he considers himself a candidate of compromise and stated that he could use his experiences as a Rector of the Charles University. Horník noted that he worked within Senate for a long time.\nThe incumbent President Milan Štěch stated on 11 November 2018 that there could be a fourth candidate of compromise. He didn't say who would be such candidate but ruled out his own candidacy. Main Senate factions refused possibility of fourth candidate. Nominations were closed on 12 November 2018. Kubera, Horník and Hampl became official candidates.\nCandidates\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"width:20%;\"| Candidate name and age\n!
