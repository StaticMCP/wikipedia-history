He is also Professor of the Practice of Narrative Theory and Literature in the English Department. He is known for studies on how higher education responds to crisis and technological change.\nEarly life and education\nMaloney was born in Hartford, Connecticut on August 8, 1968. He graduated from East Windsor High School in 1986.

This early intersection of technology and literary theory is central to his intellectual interests. His scholarly work focused on critical theory, and how technology and pedagogy inform one another in higher education. He then earned a graduate certificate from the School of Criticism and Theory of Cornell University in 1997. He defended his Ph.D. in English from The Ohio State University, Footnotes in Fiction: A Rhetorical Approach, in 2005.\nResearch\nMaloney is the chair of Georgetown’s Academic Innovation Network. His research began with narrative theory and literary studies but has moved into studies of higher education. He has published three books on higher education with Johns Hopkins University Press, working with Joshua Kim, the Assistant Provost for Online Learning Strategy at Dartmouth College. Maloney was influenced by a group of academic theorists at The Ohio State University, Distinguished Professor of English James Phelan, Distinguished Humanities Professor of English and Rhodes scholar Brian McHale, and Academy Professor and Guggenheim fellow Morris Beja. He works closely with Randy Bass of Georgetown University, and with faculty development and educational design leaders through HAIL, edX, RNL, and global innovation summits.\nPersonal life\nMaloney is married to Kirsten Maloney. They have two children.\nReferences"
