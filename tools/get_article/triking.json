Trikings are essentially a modern version of the 1930s Morgan three-wheelers, and a cross between a sports car and a microcar.\nHistory\nV-twin motorcycle engine]]\nTriking Sports Cars was founded as Triking Cyclecars Ltd by former Lotus employee Tony Divey (1930 - 2013). He built the first Triking in the late 1970s because he was unable to acquire a Morgan. It featured a steel space frame with alloy panels and a glass-fibre bonnet, and was powered by a Moto Guzzi V-twin motorcycle engine. Its popularity led to production. In 1990 Divey designed a new tubular front end and a one piece glass-fibre \"body\".\nTelegraph writer, Andrew English, commented of the Triking driving experience: \"The intimacy is both profound, delightful and, for the claustrophobic, disturbing. Everything is so contiguous with the driver; you could have sex at a greater distance than this.\"\nTriking Cyclecars Ltd was dissolved in 2006 upon Divey's retirement and was reformed in 2009 by Alan Layzell, a Triking employee.\nSee also\n* List of car manufacturers of the United Kingdom\n* Three-wheeler\n* Cyclecar\n* Motorcycle motor powered car\n* List of motorized trikes\n* Morgan 3-Wheeler\nNotes\nExternal links\n*[http://trikingsportscars.co.uk/ Triking Sports Cars official site]\n*[http://www.3wheelers.com/triking.html Triking at 3wheelers.com]\n*[http://www.trikingsportscars.co.uk/ Alan Layzell and Triking Sports Cars]"
