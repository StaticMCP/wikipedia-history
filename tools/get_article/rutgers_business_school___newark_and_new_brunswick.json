It was founded in 1929.  It operated under several different names (the undergraduate Rutgers School of Business in New Brunswick and the Rutgers Graduate School of Management in Newark) before consolidating into Rutgers Business School. (The Rutgers School of Business in Camden remained a separate business school under the Rutgers University umbrella but was not part of the Newark/New Brunswick consolidation.)\nRutgers Business School offers bachelor's, master's, and Ph.D. degrees.\nFacilities\nIn 2009 RBS opened a new facility in the first 11 stories of downtown Newark's One Washington Park office building that is home to the full-time and Executive MBA programs, the MQF program, and the Newark undergraduate program. 1 Washington Park is centrally located near highways and public transportation, notably Newark Broad Street Station, where there is service on New Jersey Transit Morris and Essex and Montclair-Boonton Lines (including Midtown Direct service to New York Penn Station) and Newark Light Rail service to Newark Penn Station. The Washington Park light rail station is also adjacent to the school.\nRutgers facilities in One Washington Park include classrooms, lecture halls, conference rooms, student and faculty lounges, offices, and a University Police substation. The new 3 story RBS entrance atrium features lecture halls, a trading floor, student lounge and study spaces, a rooftop garden, and the Bove Auditorium. One Park Bistro in the lobby of the building is owned by the university and operated by the university's contracted Aramark food service but is open to all tenants with a building ID. In 2011, it was announced the Rutgers–Newark campus would further expand around Washington Park, converting the former American Insurance Company Building into graduate student housing.\nIn 2011 RBS broke ground on a new school building located on the New Brunswick/Livingston Campus. This new building, which opened in September, 2013, is the focal point for the New Brunswick undergraduate program. Previously, in New Brunswick, RBS shared the Janice H. Levin Building with the School of Labor and Management Relations and Beck Hall with the School of Arts and Sciences on the Livingston Campus.\nRBS also has facilities in Morristown Plaza in Morristown, New Jersey, Basking Ridge Country Club in Basking Ridge, Washington Street in Jersey City, and Robinson Road in Singapore. MBA programs were also previously offered in Beijing and Shanghai.\nIn 2024, Rutgers Business School launched a new Master of Business Analytics program, reflecting the school's growing emphasis on data driven decision making.\nAccreditation and rankings\nas seen from Newark Broad Street station]]\nRBS is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) as well as the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education  while Rutgers University as a whole is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.\nRBS is ranked by US News #44 in Best Business Schools and 28th in Part-time MBA nationwide.\nFor the 2024-2025 school year, Bloomberg ranked Rutgers Business School #59 in the nation.\nIn April 2022, a lawsuit accused RBS of creating fake jobs for graduates to boost MBA program rankings. The  lawsuit was expanded into a class-action lawsuit. The lawsuits were dismissed in Federal Court in September 2023.\nResearch centers\n*Blanche & Irwin Lerner Center for Pharmaceutical Management Studies\n**Mahmud Hassan, director\n*Center for Governmental Accounting Education & Research\n**Robert H.
