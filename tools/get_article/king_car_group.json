Root beer was not lucrative and in 1982 King Car pivoted to canned coffee, setting up the Mr. Browns brand on the advice of a Japanese mentor of Lee. By the mid 1990s the Mr. Brown brand was dominant domestically and was expanding internationally. In 1995 King Car tried to enter the alcohol market for the first time but their plans were rejected by the government which at the time held a monopoly on alcohol production. Following the de-monopolization of the alcohol market in 2002 King Car began work on its first distillery, Kavalan, which opened in 2005.\nSubsidiaries\nBuckskin\nBuckskin is a major Taiwanese beer brand based in Taoyuan.
