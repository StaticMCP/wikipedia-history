This is the first time the event was held in South Australia.\nThere were no awards in 2016, due to the move in the eligibility dates for the AIR Awards to align with the calendar year. The 2017 awards saw a slightly longer eligibility period than usual with members' releases period between 1 August 2015 and 31 December 2016.\nAIR General manager, Maria Amato commented \"It was great to see the Industry turn out in droves to celebrate the success of the Independent sector at the 11th AIR Awards in Adelaide. So proud of the collaborations with the South Australian Government and our supporting partners that helped us make this all happen.\"\nPerformers\n*A.B.
