It amends the Theft Act 1968 by creating the specific offence of aggravated vehicle-taking, which combines the taking of a vehicle without the owner's consent with driving it dangerously, causing injury, or causing damage to the vehicle or other property.  It carries a mandatory disqualification from driving.\nThe Act was brought in to tackle the problem of joyriding, which was at the time a widespread problem in the UK.  It was subject to a fast-track passage through Parliament.\nReferences"
