The down-river boundary is Canal Street, below which is the city's 4th Ward. The upper boundary is Julia Street, originally the New Basin Canal. The former canal route in this area is now I-10. For most of this route from the river back is the 2nd Ward.  From Carrollton Avenue up it borders the 17th Ward. The back boundary is City Park Avenue (formerly known as Bayou Metairie Road), across which is another portion of the 4th Ward.\nGallier Hall on Lafayette Square\nFeatures and landmarks\nThe 3rd Ward encompasses the majority of the Central Business District near the River.

Continuing back, the Ward includes a large section of the Mid City neighborhood.
