For previous events, see Timeline of the 2020 United States presidential election (2017–2019). For subsequent events, see Timeline of the 2020 United States presidential election (November 2020–January 2021)\nThe presidential primaries and caucuses were held between February and August 2020, staggered among the 50 states, Washington, D.C., and U.S. territories. The conventions in August nominated president Donald Trump for the Republican Party and Joe Biden for the Democratic Party.\nThe \"invisible primary\" and debate period\nThe \"invisible primary\" is the first phase of any presidential contest, when hopefuls \"test the waters\" by forming PACS and \"exploratory committees\" in order to see if such an endeavor is worthwhile. This is followed by the formal announcement of candidacies, and a period of televised debates and other events prior to the beginning of delegate selection.\nJanuary 2020\n*January 2:\n** Castro drops out of the Democratic primary, after failing to gain traction in the race and struggling to raise enough money to stay solvent.\n** Struggling financially, Williamson lays off her entire campaign staff but pledges to stay in the race with just volunteers.\n*January 6: Former Rhode Island governor and senator Lincoln Chafee announces his candidacy for the Libertarian Party nomination.\n*January 10:\n** Williamson drops out of the Democratic primary, eight days after laying off her entire campaign staff.\n** Six candidates qualify for the seventh Democratic debate.\n*January 13: Struggling financially, and facing the prospect of being forced off the campaign trail to attend the first impeachment trial of Donald Trump in his capacity as a senator, Booker drops out of the Democratic primary.\n*January 14: The seventh Democratic debate takes place at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa.\n*January 15–16: The House of Representatives appoints impeachment managers, who then formally present the articles of impeachment to the Senate to begin the first impeachment trial of Donald Trump.

Baca and Chiafalo v.

The total attendance of the rally was lower than was expected; roughly a week prior, Trump claimed that \"almost one million\" people had requested tickets.
