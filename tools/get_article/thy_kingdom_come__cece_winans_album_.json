On January 22, 2008, Winans posted on her blog that she would be releasing an album on April 1, 2008. News outlets began reporting in February that the studio album would be called Thy Kingdom Come and featured the song \"Waging War\".\nSingles\nThe lead single for the album, \"Thy Will Be Done\", was released digitally on the iTunes Store on January 1, 2008. The second single, \"Waging War\", was released on March 4, 2008. \"It Ain't Over\", the album's third single, was released around August 2008.\nCritical reception\n}}\nAllMusic editor Andree Farias found that \"the album is one of the churchiest the singer has released yet [...] Thy Kingdom Come sees Winans doing justice to her family name and singing almost exclusively for the saints – songs of praise, songs of encouragement, songs of worship, songs of inspiration. But the fact that this is an album for the church doesn't mean it sounds like Sunday morning [...] As is expected of Winans, the songs are expertly produced, the ballads are beautifully orchestrated, the urban pieces are as urban as Whitney in her prime. In other words, Thy Kingdom Come is precisely what a CeCe album should sound like, which isn't to say she's settling for the middle road.\"\nTrack listing\n}}\n| length6       = 5:31\n| title7        = The Test of Time\n| writer7       = Luther \"Mano\" Hanes\n| extra7        = Luther \"Mano\" Hanes\n| length7       = 6:15\n| title8        = I'll Live for You\n| writer8       = Capehart, Tunie, Winans\n| extra8        = }}\n| length8       = 4:56\n| title9        = Bless His Holy Name\n| writer9       = Hanes, Winans\n| extra9        = Hanes\n| length9       = 4:32\n| title10       = Oh Holy Place\n| writer10      = Capehart, Tunie, Winans\n| extra10       = }}\n| length10      = 4:56\n| title11       = You're the One\n| writer11      = Hanes, Winans\n| extra11       = Hanes\n| length11      = 4:51\n| title12       = The Coast is Clear\n| writer12      = Alvin Love III\n| extra12       = }}\n| length12      = 4:54\n| title13       = Falling in Love\n| writer13      = Winans\n| extra13       = Sims\n| length13      = 3:47\n| title14       = Million Miles\n| writer14      = Sims, Anthony Skinner\n| extra14       = Sims\n| length14      = 5:53\n}}\nNotes\n*  denotes a co-producer\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Chart (2008)\n! scope=\"col\" | Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n! scope=\"col\"|Chart (2008)\n! scope=\"col\"|Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|US Top Gospel Albums (Billboard)\n|align=\"center\"|7\n|}\nAwards\nThe album was nominated for a Dove Award for Contemporary Gospel Album of the Year at the 40th GMA Dove Awards.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
