L. Lawson & Son Warehouse is a historic warehouse building located at Roanoke, Virginia.  It was built in 1925, and is a four-story, utilitarian brick building.  The banked site allowed for the unloading of freight from railcars directly into the third story of the warehouse.  It was built by Harry Leland Lawson, a key figure in Roanoke's business community from the\nlate 1910s to the 1940s.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 2008. Since 2019, it has also been a contributing structure to the NRHP-listed Belmont Historic District.\nReferences"
