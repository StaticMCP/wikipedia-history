There was an exchange of gunfire and missiles. Afterwards, the ICU held a rally in Bandiradley, at which ICU chairman Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed accused the Ethiopians of firing 12 missiles at the Islamic Courts Union.\nOn December 1, in Galkayo, it was reported 9 clerics of the Islamic Tabliq sect had been arrested under the orders of Colonel Abdi Qeybdiid.\nOn December 7–8, the militia of warlord Abdi Qeybdid took part in skirmishes against forces of the ICU near the small settlement of Sadeh Higlo between Bandiradley and Galkayo. This rapidly led to an exchange of shelling between Ethiopian and ICU troops.\nHundreds of Ethiopian troops and tanks took up positions near Bandiradley with militiamen from the northeastern semi-autonomous region of Puntland. Puntland forces claimed they had been provoked by rocket and mortar fire. ICU forces stated Ethiopian troops \"started firing missiles toward our positions.\" At least one ICU fighter was killed in the exchange.\nOn the same day hundreds of Ethiopian troops also took up position near Dinsor, a town nearly 1000&nbsp;km south of Bandiradley and the ICU held a rally of over 5,000 people in Mogadishu to protest the UN decision to send a peacekeeping force to Somalia\nOn December 16, it was reported a local Islamic court named Imamu Shahfici was set up in Abudwaq. It urged Islamists to resist the Ethiopians\nFurther combat was kept in abeyance until the general outbreak of hostilities on December 20.\nOn December 19, 18 technicals and a large number of Ethiopian troops entered Balanbale, Galguduud region, to reinforce troops already positioned in the town.\nJust prior to the battle, on December 22, Ethiopian troops departed Balanbale where they had been in occupation for the past three months. This was reportedly done at the urging of the tribal elders, who did not wish fighting to break out between the ICU and Ethiopia in their town.\nOn December 22, Ethiopian troops were said to be amassing in Galkayo for what might turn into a second front of the war near Puntland.\nBattle\nThe following day, 500 Ethiopian troops and 8 tanks were reported to be heading towards Bandiradley. Islamist fighters retreated from their positions. They were pursued south to the area between Galinsoor and Bandiradley, where the Islamists were defeated. The ICU forces were further pursued to Adado in Galguduud, which they abandoned late on December 25, 2006.\nAftermath\nThe ICU abandoned the towns of Dhuusamareb and Abudwaq without fighting. In the wake of their withdrawal from Abudwaq, militias set up checkpoints and began firing their weapons.\nReferences"
