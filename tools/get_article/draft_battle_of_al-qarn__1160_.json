Abd al-Mu'min is then escorted to the mountains of Zaghouan by the Riyahides contingents. That's when Yusuf ibn Malik, emir of the Banu Mohamed Riyahides, tells Abd al-Mu'min that his tribe refused to go with him to Iberia and that they suspected the caliph would kick them out of their lands. The Arabs are then excluded from his plans, and the Arab leaders would take their tribes and would move to the desert, Abd al-Mu'min would march westwards towards Wadi-l'Nisa (near Constantine) and would remain there for 20 days, and would intercept every route, and would not let any soldier leave the camp, the Arabs would regain confidence and would return to Ifriqiya, where they once lived, Abd al-Mu'min finds out and would send an army of 30,000 men led by his two sons Abu Muhammed and Abu Abdallah, they would attack the Arabs from behind through the Sahara cutting off all escape routes, the Arabs had settled south of Kairouan near the Gabal al-Qarn, there were 80,000 men, led by 3 Arab leaders, Muhriz ibn Ziyad, Gabbara ibn Kamil, and Ma'sud ibn Zaamam\nBattle\nAs soon as the Almohads started attacking the Arabs, a disagreement happens between the three Arab chiefs, in which, Gabbara and Ma'sud would escape with their tribes, while Muhriz remained to fight the Almohads, the battle lasts from 19 to 29 April, and would end in the complete rout of the Arab army, and the death of Muhriz ibn Ziyad who's head would be placed on a lance, the Arabs would be massacred, and the remaning survivors of the battle would abandon everything to the victors, from tents, children, women and livestock which would all be given to Abd al-Mu'min.\nAftermath\nAbd al-Mu'min would take the Riyahides women to the western Maghreb where a deputation of the Banu Riyah would be sent to retrieve the captives, Abd al-Mumin would return all of the women back to these deputations.\nReferences"
