Diplomatic relations were established on 10 January 1992. The United Kingdom opened a consulate-general in Kyiv in November 1991, then upgraded it to an embassy in January 1992.\nThe United Kingdom withdrew around half of all staff in the days following 24 January 2022 amid fears of a Russian invasion, according to a statement from the Foreign Office. This followed a similar slow withdrawal of Russian embassy staff and relatives of U.S. embassy staff leaving Ukraine. On 20 April 2022, it was announced that the British Embassy in Kyiv would be reopening the following week. During 2022, 350 Royal Marines from 45 Commando supported embassy diplomats in Ukraine.\nSee also\n* Ukraine–United Kingdom relations\n* List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to Ukraine\n* List of diplomatic missions in Ukraine\n* Embassy of Ukraine, London\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://ukinukraine.fco.gov.uk/en/about-us/our-embassy-in-ukraine/ Embassy of the United Kingdom, Kyiv official website ]"
