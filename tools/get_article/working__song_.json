The following day, both McRae and Khalid announced the release date of \"Working\" for June 17, 2021. In a press release, McRae wrote that \"I usually release a lot of songs that are pretty emotional but this one is just a straight summer bop\".\nCritical reception\nWriting for ET Canada, Shakiel Mahjouri noted a shift on \"Working\" from McRae's previous \"typically emotional tracks\", saying that the single \"brought upbeat summer heat\". Jakori Beauchamp of Rated R&B remarked that \"the song covers the confusing dynamic of longing for one another when apart but eager to call it quits when you're reunited in person\".\nMusic video\nBefore the release of \"Working\", McRae teased towards a music video for the song, promising it would be available \"very soon\". On June 22, 2021, McRae announced via Twitter that the video would be released the following day at 10AM Eastern Time.
