Concerned about the release of the \"Report on the Logistics Workers of Peking University\", the registration of the society was blocked, and the president was taken away by the police.\nBeliefs\nAs one of the students told The Washington Post, they believe \"Once you study Marxism, you know real socialism and China's so-called socialism with Chinese characteristics are two different things. They sell fascism as socialism as a street vendor passes off dog meat as lamb.\"\nOne of the activities of the Marxist Society members is weekly journeys to factories on Beijing's outskirts and working on assembly lines.\nReport on the Logistics Workers of Peking University\nOn December 15, 2015, the Marxist Society released the \"Report on the Logistics Workers of Peking University\" on its WeChat public account, saying that there were some problems in the labor contract of Peking University, such as the lack of labor contracts, unpaid social insurance and overtime work. Concerned people inside and outside the school. On the 16th, Peking University responded on its official WeChat and Sina Weibo platform that only a small number of employees participated in the survey.

In September 2018, Peking University announced that the Marxist Society would be unable to re-register for the Autumn semester.\nIn November, Peking University announced that it has eradicated one \"illegal organization\" inside the Marxist Society.
