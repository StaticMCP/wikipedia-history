The monument was designed by Aimé Millet and constructed in 1865. It is designated as a monument historique.\nThe monument was commissioned by Emperor Napoleon III from the sculptor Aimé Millet and installed in 1865 on Mont Auxois, near Alise-Sainte-Reine in the Côte-d'Or department in the Burgundy region of eastern France. The site was the supposed site of Alesia. The architect for the memorial was Eugène Viollet-le-Duc.  The base has a nationalistic inscription installed by Viollet-le-Duc, translating into French the words of Julius Caesar:\nLa Gaule unie\nFormant une seule nation\nAnimée d'un même esprit,\nPeut défier l'Univers.\n(Gaul united,\nForming a single nation\nAnimated by a common spirit,\nCan defy the Universe.)\nAlise-Sainte-Reine - Statue de Vercingétorix - 03.jpg\nAlise-Sainte-Reine - Statue de Vercingétorix - 01.jpg\nAlise-Sainte-Reine - Statue de Vercingétorix - 04.jpg\nAlise-Sainte-Reine - Statue de Vercingétorix - 05.jpg\nReferences\nSee also\n* Hermannsdenkmal (Germany)"
