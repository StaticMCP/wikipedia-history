The party's founding congress was held on 7 December 2017 at Nouvata Hotel in the capital, Nouméa, but its origins can be traced to a political group in Congress that split from The Rally on 18 July 2017.\nHistory\nThe Caledonian Republicans was formed in the days leading up to the 2017 French legislative election, after disagreements between candidates of The Republicans (represented by The Rally in New Caledonia). Members of the newly founded party criticized other anti-independence parties' economic and labour platforms and rallied under the leadership of trade unionist Sonia Backès.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
