She was queen consort of Joseon and honoured as Queen Kong () from 1418 until her death in 1446.\nBiography\nEarly life\nLady Sim was born as the first daughter and eldest child of nine children to Lord Sim On and Lady Ahn of the Sunheung Ahn clan. Her paternal uncle, Sim Jong, was King Taejo's son-in-law (titled Prince Consort Cheongwon) through his marriage to the king's daughter, Princess Kyŏngsŏn.\nMarriage\nIn 1408 at the age of 13, she was arranged to marry King Taejong's son, Prince Ch'ungnyŏng, to which her title became Princess Kyŏngsuk (). It's said that she was chosen for the marriage due to the fact that King Taejong's older sister, Princess Kyŏngsŏn, was her paternal aunt; thus having royal family connections.\nWhen her husband became grand prince, her title changed from ongju () to kongju ().\nHer parents were given royal titles: her mother was given \"Internal Princess Consort Samhanguk of the Sunheung Ahn clan\" (), and her father was given \"Internal Prince Cheongcheon\" ().\nDuring Taejong's 17th year of reign in 1417, Princess Kyŏngsuk was also given the title of Internal Princess Consort Samhanguk ().\nOn 6 July 1418, during the 18th year of Taejong's reign, Princess Kyŏngsuk became Crown Princess Kyŏng () when Grand Prince Ch'ungyŏng (later King Sejong) became the crown prince successor to the throne, and when her husband became king on 9 September 1418, her title changed to Queen Kong (공비, 恭妃; Gongbi meaning Courteous Consort).\nIt's said that Queen Kong had a gentle and kind appearance but advocated strict adherence to laws and code of conduct.\nRoyal political conflicts\nJust like her predecessor and mother-in-law, Queen Dowager Hudeok, Queen Kong experienced the loss of her family as Taejong felt threatened due to the influence of royal in-laws. She had lost her father, Sim On, in 1419 and two uncles in 1418 during her father-in-law's regency with her husband. Her mother and remaining relatives were also demoted to lower slave class.\nBut in 1426, rather than having his in-laws serve as slaves, Sejong expelled the Queen's mother and relatives from Cheonan, and restored the posts of her brothers and male relatives.\nCourt officials brought up the topic of demoting or stripping Queen Kong's position as Queen, but King Sejong fought back. He stated that the Queen was to remain in her position due to giving birth to two princes prior to the conflict.\nRather than holding resentment towards to her husband, Queen Kong was understanding and supportive of her husband through the ordeal.\nAs a Queen with duties, it is said that the inner court was at its most peaceful during her care. King Sejong also praised her for being a good leader for the women of the palace.\nLater life\nOn 14 April 1446, Queen Kong died at the age of 50 during her husband's 28th year of reign. King Sejong outlived her by 2 years and eventually died at the age of 52.\nQueen Kong bore 10 children which included King Munjong and King Sejo.\nLegacy\nQueen Sohŏn was buried with her husband, King Sejong in a burial mound, surrounded by statues of scholars, military officials, and horses. The site has a memorial shrine and pond. Their tomb, Yeongneung, is within the Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty, west of the city of Yeoju.\nPrince Suyang commissioned the creation of the Seokbosangjeol after the death of his mother, Queen Sohŏn, intending it to ease her passage to the next life. It was, however, also made available to the general population of Korea, to encourage the propagation of the Buddhist faith. It was translated from Chinese to Korea's native hangul characters, and as such represents the oldest form of indigenous Korean written text. The book was written at his father's request, and included more than 580 Buddhist lyrics by Sejong in Wolincheongangjigok. It was first published in 24 volumes in 1447 C.E. An original edition is held at the National Library of Korea in Seoul, where it is designated a Tangible Cultural Treasure.\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}"
