Ferdinand reannexed Navarrese territory he conceded to García 17 years earlier after his brother's assistance at Pisuerga.\nPrecedents\nAfter the death of Sancho III of Navarre, his empire was divided. García, the eldest son, received the Kingdom of Navarre, while younger son Ferdinand already controlled what was then the County of Castile, owing fealty to his brother-in-law, Bermudo III of León. In 1037, with Garcia's help, Ferdinand defeated and killed the childless Bermudo at the battle of Tamarón, and claimed the crown of León in right of his wife, Bermudo's sister, being crowned in 1038. He rewarded García by ceding to him Castilian territories from Oca to the gates of Burgos, from Briviesca to the valley of Urbel, from Castrobarto to Bricia, and from the Nervión River to Santander.\nVersions\nChronicon Silense\nThe monk of Silos wrote several decades later that an envious García attacked Ferdinand who was visiting him at Nájera during his illness. After recovering, García paid a return visit to Ferdinand to make peace. King Ferdinand put him in chains and locked him in a tower in Cea. However, the Navarrese escaped and declared war, rejecting the Castilian embassies.\nGarcía was buried in the nearby village of Agés and his tomb was recently discovered in the church there.\nThe hosts of Castile and León were in Atapuerca, three leagues eastwards from Burgos, already in Navarre.\nGarcía had with him Moorish auxiliary troops and maybe his brother king Ramiro I of Aragon.\nAnnals of Compostela\nThe Annales compostellani attribute the death of García to one knight of his, Sancho Fortún, \"whom he [the king], had offended with his wife\". Several in the Navarrese retinue preferred death in combat, and also the murderer, lord of Funes, Navarre, died in battle.\nCrónica Najerense\nThe Crónica Najerense mentions relatives of Vermudo, who furiously engaged García, disobeying Ferdinand's instructions to take him alive.\nThe Navarrese kept however their places until night and took the corpse to bury him in Nájera.\nThe proclaimed on the spot the new king, an adolescent Sancho de Peñalén.\nOther version\nFerdinand is in this version the reckless brother and covets the \"Asturias of Santander\", Old Castile, Briviesca and Rioja.\nFerdinand visited his ill brother, but suspecting him fled.\nGarcía visited an ill Ferdinand then, wishing to dispel his suspicions, but was locked in Cea.\nUpon escaping, he took his troops and some Moors into Castile.\nIn Atapuerca the peace talks failed.\nTwo traitor soldiers (one of them, Sancho Fortún), wounded him lethally.\nFerdinand conceded the transport of the corpse to Nájera, took Briviesca, Montes de Oca and part of Rioja.\nThe border of Navarre was set by the Ebro, and the new king Sancho IV of Navarre became Ferdinand's vassal.\nEl Cid?\nSome sources mention El Cid as one of the battlers, but being born on 1043 or 1048 he would be too young.\nLater history\nIn 1940 a commemorative inscription was carved on a 6,000-year-old menhir at the site.\nSince 1996, the people of Atapuerca and neighbour towns reenact the battle on the last or previous Sunday of August.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*"
