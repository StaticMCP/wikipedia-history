The squadron goes by the motto \"Steadfast\" with the Shikra adopted as its mascot.\nHistory\nBased at Paya Lebar Air Base, 149 Squadron was inaugurated on 1 June 1985 as one of the RSAF's fighter squadrons operating in the interceptor role. The squadron initially operated the supersonic F-5E/F Tiger II fighter aircraft, before converting to the improved F-5S/T Tiger-IIs fighter aircraft in the early 1990s, these were retrofitted with new state-of-the-art avionics giving the aircraft capability of carrying out both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions.\nOn 5 April 2010, the squadron was re-inaugurated by Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean in an RSAF ceremony at Paya Lebar Air Base, with the arrival of five F-15SG strike fighters flown back the week before from Mountain Home Air Force Base in the United States.\nInformation\nThe tail is adorned with a beige checkered tailband. The squadron's logo is centered with the serial number on the base of the tail.\nAchievements\nThe squadron found itself actively involved in several major multilateral exercises such as Exercise Bersama Shield and Bersama Lima under the ambit of the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA), and Exercise Cope Tiger with the US and Thailand air forces in 2007. The squadron has also won the Best Fighter Squadron award in the Singapore Armed Forces Best Unit Competition eight times, in 1986, 1988, 2002, 2004, 2008, 2011, 2013 and 2018.\nAircraft operated\n#15× F-5S & 1× F-5T Tiger-IIs (1985–2010)\n#24× F-15SG Strike Eagles (2010–present)\nPhoto gallery\nFile:RSAF F-5.jpg|An F-5S Tiger-IIs of 149 Sqn taxiing towards the runway.\nFile:RSAF Boeing F-15SG Strike Eagle DRW Butler.jpg|149 Sqn's F-15SG at Darwin Airport, 2011.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080906140801/https://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/atozlistings/air_force/assets/airbases_and_squadrons/Paya_Lebar_Air_Base.html RSAF web page on 149 Sqn & Paya Lebar Air Base (PLAB)]"
