The monument was sponsored by the local Chinese community and is located near the Kota Kinabalu City Hall, where it is still used as part of Malaysia Day celebrations.\nHistory\nIn 1963, the Malaysia Agreement was signed, which saw North Borneo (now Sabah) join the Federation of Malaya to form Malaysia. The Chinese community of Jesselton (now Kota Kinabalu), the capital of North Borneo, discussed several proposals to commemorate the union, eventually agreeing 20 days before the expected union date of 16 September (what would become Malaysia Day) to erect a permanent memorial. A monument was quickly constructed in time for the event. It was unveiled by the first governor of Sabah, Datu Mustapha Datu Harun.\nThe monument degraded over time, and its original plaque went missing, perhaps being stolen. Restoration works funded by government funds allocated to Assemblywoman Christina Liew finished before Malaysia Day in 2019. These added a fountain and coloured lights near the monument. Liew was at the time Deputy Chief Minister and Minister of Tourism, Culture and Environment and noted the monument's relevance to local history and tourism.\nThe monument continues to play a role in local Malaysia Day celebrations. There are proposals to designate the monument as a cultural heritage site. It is currently managed by the city council.\nLocation\nThe monument is located in Deasoka Square, a busy area near the Kota Kinabalu City Hall. It was initially built near the Keng Chew Association.\nDesign\nThe monument cost $11,000. It reflects Chinese design and has text in Chinese, English, and Malay.\nA plaque on the monument is inscribed in English and Chinese with \"Sponsored By North Borneo Chinese Association & Jesselton Chinese Chamber of Commerce. This Monument Is Built By The People Of Jesselton To The Founding of Malaysia on 16th September 1963\".\nGallery\nFile:Plak Tugu Peringatan Malaysia.jpg|alt=Gold plaque with black text|Plaque on the monument\nFile:KotaKinabalu Sabah Gaya-Street-Sunday-Market-14.jpg|alt=A small fountain surrounded by black bars curving inwards|Fountain in front of the monument\nReferences"
