This is claimed to preserve the WRG rules structure and key data while the software automates the mechanics of playing by these rules, hence saving time and increasing enjoyment of the game.\nCore rules summary\nPhilosophy\nParaphrasing from the author's introduction:\n:\"The rules cover the period from the introduction of the fast tank until the introduction of ATGM, AFV range-finders and accurate APDS... the emphasis is on tactics, terrain, command and control... These rules are set in the real world of rain and mud, dust and mirage. The battles they simulate are not fought by nicely painted models but by men who are tired, frightened, dirty and often cold and hungry... Equipment performance and troop capabilities are based on those reported by real fighting units, rather than theoretical or artificial sources... differences in combat effectiveness that are not substantiated by careful research or that are insignificant compared with random factors are given only the attention they deserve.\"\nSequence of play\nAlternate.\nTime scale\nOne friendly and one enemy move per five minutes. Each move partly overlaps moves preceding and succeeding it.\nGround scale\nVaries depending on the figure scale.\nTroop scale\nOne figure represents one real equivalent. Infantry figures are based together in elements of 2 or 3 to 6.\nDice\nOne six sided dice is used throughout the rules.\nCommand and control\nEach company (and if necessary, platoon) is given a one word order—Recce, Probe, Attack, Defend, Delay or Support—that specifies its task and imposes any tactical limitations. Some orders require additional information such as an objective, a line of advance, or boundaries.\nOrders can be changed during a battle by passing the new order(s) through the chain of command.\nCommunication\nCommand elements can communicate once with a superior command element, three times with subordinate command elements, and with all directly subordinate elements.\nRange and effectiveness depends on method—Personal, Line, Radio, Written, Signal.\nTroop quality\nTroops are classified as Inept, Green, Stubborn, Dashing, Skilled, Thrusting, Fanatic or Irregular. These classifications can restrict choice of Tactical Modes (explained hereafter) and also govern reactions to casualties and overrun situations.\nTactical Modes\nCommand elements can choose how to fulfil their orders by declaring a Tactical Mode – Salvo, Hold, March, Attack, Assault, Dash, Stalk, Skirmish, Slow, or Gap. Each Tactical Mode has its own movement and firing specifications.\nAn element's choice of a Tactical Mode can be restricted by orders, troop classification, terrain and combat results.\nExigency Modes\nThese are the same as Tactical Modes except that they are imposed while specific circumstances apply, such as being shot at. When these cease, elements revert to their Tactical Modes.\nFiring\nFor direct fire, first dice to check for full or partial acquisition, specify the type of fire—Aimed, Volley, Suppressive—then dice to see if the fire is effective.\nArea fire is not dissimilar to the above except that -\n*Area fire resources are allocated Under Command, In Direct Support, In General Support, to Counterbattery, or at Priority Call. These classifications determine responsiveness to requests for fire support (which may not always be approved when required and may sometimes be supplemented by additional firers).\n*Firing tasks are defined as Counterbattery, Programmed, Defensive or Impromptu. Each type of task has its own requirements for availability and activation.\n*Targets are classified as Registered, Observed, or Predicted; these classifications affect aiming point accuracy and corrections.\n*Possible fire patterns are Bombardment, Fireblow, Harassing, Concentration, or Barrage. These patterns have their own availability requirements and affect beaten zone dimensions and munition effectiveness.\nCombat results\nSuccessful fire causes the target to be Suppressed or Neutralised. Then check for Knock-out.\nWhen carrying out Attack or Probe orders:\n*Neutralisation may cause a platoon to become pinned\n*Pinning or Knock-out may cause a company to become repulsed (which in turn may require it to retreat or change to Hold orders).\nRegardless of orders, overrunning may also cause retreat or surrender results.\nIf all of a company's troops retreat in the same move, a rout may ensue.\nRepulsed, retreated or routed troops must be rallied before they can advance or be given a new order, as must troops that have attacked and occupied an objective.\nReferences\nMonographs\n*Barker P 1988, \"A new WRG approach to wargaming tank combat\", The Courier, vol VIII, no. 1\n*Peers C 1996, \"An officer classification system for WRG, 1925–2000, Wargames Illustrated, March"
