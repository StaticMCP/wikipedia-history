It is a spin-off to The Walking Dead, which is based on the comic book series of the same name by Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard. It is also the second television series within The Walking Dead franchise. The first three seasons serve as a prequel, focusing on a blended family who experience the start of the zombie apocalypse. Subsequent seasons run concurrently to the original show, with Morgan Jones (Lennie James) from The Walking Dead crossing over into the series.\nThe series features a large ensemble cast, originally led by Kim Dickens as Madison Clark, Cliff Curtis as Travis Manawa, Frank Dillane as Nick Clark, and Alycia Debnam-Carey as Alicia Clark. Following a soft reboot with its fourth season, the series was led by Lennie James as Morgan Jones. Other series regulars have included Colman Domingo, Mercedes Mason, Rubén Blades, Danay García, Maggie Grace, Garret Dillahunt, Jenna Elfman, Alexa Nisenson, Karen David, Austin Amelio, Mo Collins, and Christine Evangelista.\nThe series premiered on August 23, 2015. Andrew Chambliss and Ian Goldberg served as the showrunners for the fourth to eighth season, succeeding Erickson from the first three. The series concluded on November 19, 2023, after eight seasons and 113 episodes. Initially set in Los Angeles, filming for the series took place in Los Angeles, Texas, Vancouver, Canada, Mexico, and Georgia.\nPremise\nSet in Los Angeles, California, and later in Mexico, the first three seasons of Fear the Walking Dead follow a dysfunctional, blended family composed of high school counselor Madison Clark, her English teacher fiancé Travis Manawa, her daughter Alicia, her drug addict son Nick, Travis' son from a previous marriage, Chris, Chris' mother Liza Ortiz, and others who join their group at the onset of the zombie apocalypse.

The lawsuit also includes David Alpert, who was Smith's agent and who remains a business partner with Robert Kirkman, and who is one of Fears executive producers; Smith's lawsuit asserts that Alpert violated his fiduciary duty to protect Smith's interests when he began working on Fear. AMC attempted to have the lawsuit dismissed, stating that once one stripped out generic elements of the zombie genre, there were no further similarities between the works. In February 2019, judge Lucy Koh rejected this, believing that it would be necessary to have a discovery phase and expert testimony to evaluate AMC's stance.\nIn March 2019, AMC settled the lawsuit, details remained confidential.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
