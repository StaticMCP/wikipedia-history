Pilots trained here using Airspeed Oxford aircraft; it is listed as operating from 4 September 1941 to 30 March 1945.\nAerodrome\nThe RCAF Aerodrome at Hamlin was the relief landing field for RCAF Station North Battleford, and was located approximately  north of the main aerodrome. The site was located north-east of the community of Hamlin, Saskatchewan. The Relief field was constructed in the typical triangular pattern.\nIn approximately 1942 the aerodrome was listed as RCAF Aerodrome - Hamlin, Saskatchewan at  with a variation of 22 degrees east and elevation of . Six runways were listed as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Runway name\n! Length\n! Width\n! Surface\n|-\n| 5/23\n|\n|\n| Hard surfaced\n|-\n| 5/23\n|\n|\n| Hard surfaced\n|-\n| 17/35\n|\n|\n| Hard surfaced\n|-\n| 17/35\n|\n|\n| Hard surfaced\n|-\n| 11/29\n|\n|\n| Hard surfaced\n|-\n| 11/29\n|\n|\n| Hard surfaced\n|}\nA review of Google Maps on 7 June 2018 shows clear visibility of the outer runways of the airfield. There is, however, no visibility of the inner runways. The c.1942 indicate a location on the visible triangle.\nPost-war, 1945–2007\nMore recently, one runway continued to be maintained for use in agricultural flight training by Battlefords Airspray.\n2007–present\nAs of 15 March 2007, this airport is not usable and has been removed from the Canada Flight Supplement.\nSee also\n* List of airports in Saskatchewan\n* North Battleford Airport\n* List of defunct airports in Canada\nReferences"
