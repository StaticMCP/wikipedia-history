These national protests were triggered by planned taxes on gasoline, tobacco, and VoIP calls on applications such as WhatsApp, but quickly expanded into a country-wide condemnation of sectarian rule, the stagnation of the economy, unemployment (which reached 46% in 2018), endemic corruption in the public sector, legislation that was perceived to shield the ruling class from accountability (such as banking secrecy) and failures of the government to provide basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation.\nThe protests created a political crisis in Lebanon, with Prime Minister Saad Hariri tendering his resignation, not demanding any new governmental needs of being the prime minister and echoing protesters' demands for a government of independent specialists. A cabinet headed by Hassan Diab was formed in 2020 but also resigned in the wake of the 2020 Beirut explosion.\nCalling for a complete regime change, it was known by its most famous slogan; ().\nBackground\nPolitical background\nAccording to The Economist, Lebanon's dysfunction and mismanagement which followed the protests originated in the country's sectarian political system codified by the Taif agreement, which took place in 1989. The Taif agreement enshrines a sect-based political system, where political authority is allocated based on the religious affiliation of the public servant. This system is perceived as exploited by the current Lebanese politicians, many of whom are Lebanese Civil War-era sectarian warlords who still occupy positions of power and enjoy amnesty against accountability. Lebanon consists of various religious factions with 18 different sects. The 18 officially recognized religious groups include four Muslim sects, 12 Christian sects, the Druze sect, and Judaism.\nThe outbreak of the protests was attributed to the accumulated crises within the preceding weeks in Lebanon. First, in Chouf and Saadiyat, among other places, fires propagated, scorching nearby homes and placing many people in danger. A large portion of greenery was burnt down as a result. The Lebanese government failed to employ its planes to extinguish the fires and had to rely on Cypriot aid. Moreover, the prices of both oil and bread had been increasing as well as the rates of unemployment and poverty nationwide. Since all of these issues were due to a lack of proper governance, the Lebanese people voiced out their opinions over the negative situation.\nFurthermore, Lebanese citizens were facing many problems in the preceding years, electricity cuts since 1975, and so obtaining 24-hour electricity in Lebanon has since been dependent on obtaining a deal with the country's \"generator mafia\", which operates a ring of contraband gasoline power generators that contribute to the high level of air pollution in Lebanese cities. Lebanon has also not had access to drinking water except through purchased bottled water from private companies since the 1975–1990 Lebanese Civil War. Finally, the country suffers from deficient sanitation and sewage infrastructure, which led to the 2015 \"garbage crisis\" that sparked the 2015–2016 Lebanese protests.\nDays before the protests began, a series of about 100 major wildfires in Chouf, Khroub and other Lebanese areas displaced hundreds of people and caused enormous damage to Lebanese wildlife. The Lebanese government failed to deploy its firefighting equipment due to lack of maintenance and had to rely on aid from neighboring Cyprus, Jordan, Turkey and Greece.\nProtests started taking place in small numbers around Beirut towards the end of September. Impetus for the revolutionary movement was apparent years before the protests began and was visible in Lebanon's arts and culture scene, as evidenced by pop artist Ragheb Alama's song \"Tar Al Balad\" in December 2018 and rock singer-songwriter IJK's song \"Chedd Halak\" in June 2019.\nEconomic background\nSince 1997, successive governments maintained a pegged exchange rate between the Lebanese pound and United States dollar. Forecasts for the Lebanese economy worsened over the 2010s and by 2019 GDP per capita reached its lowest since 2008 and the debt-to-GDP ratio reached its highest since 2008 at 151%. As a result, international credit rating agencies downgraded the rating of government bonds. The combination of an economic downturn in the import-dependent country with the continuation of its dollar peg saw an increase in the government's budget deficit and reliance on using foreign exchange reserves from the nation's central bank to keep the currency peg. A subsequent dollar shortage in late 2019 further affected the economy, as import businesses and citizens became unable to acquire dollars at the official rate and a black market emerged. The coalition government led by Saad Hariri responded with an austerity program of general tax increases and spending reductions, with the aim to reduce the government deficit while maintaining the peg against the U.S. dollar. The reduction of the national deficit as a condition of a package of US$10.2 billion of loans and US$860 million of grants agreed in 2018 with the World Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and Saudi Arabia.\nOn 1 October, the Central Bank of Lebanon announced an economic strategy that promised to provide dollars to all those companies in the business of importing wheat, gasoline, and pharmaceuticals, so that they could continue their imports. This was considered a short-term solution by economic analysts.\nIn a cabinet session held on 17 October, the government proposed strategies to increase state revenue for 2020. There were 36 items to be discussed, including the increase of Value Added Tax (VAT) by 2pp by 2021 and an additional 2pp by 2022, making it reach a total of 15%. Additionally, the media reported there were plans of a US$0.20 charge on Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calls, such as ones made on FaceTime, Facebook and WhatsApp. The final session of the budget draft was to be held on 19 October, but was canceled upon the agreement of Prime Minister Saad Hariri and President Michel Aoun.\n2019 protests\nBeginning\non 17 October 2019]]\nOn 17 October 2019, approximately 150 civil activists were protesting against the new proposed taxes in and around downtown Beirut, blocking important streets after the first call to protest that was made by Lihaqqi  (لِحقّي) . As the Minister of Higher Education Akram Chehayeb and his convoy passed by the area, protesters assembled around his car. One of his bodyguards shot stray bullets into the air, which further enraged the protesters, but no injuries were reported. Walid Joumblatt, the leader of the Progressive Socialist Party, stated that he had spoken to minister Chehayeb- in fact, this minister represents the party in the Lebanese government- and so requested the bodyguards be handed over to the police, as all people are \"under the law\". A large number of protesters began appearing in Martyrs Square, Nejmeh Square, and Hamra Street, as well as many other regions around Lebanon. As the protests grew bigger, Prime Minister Saad Hariri called a snap cabinet meeting at the request of President Michel Aoun for midday on 18 October. An announcement was also made by Minister of Higher Education Akram Chehayeb that all schools and universities, public or private, would remain closed the next day. The Minister of Telecommunications Mohamad Choucair announced that the \"WhatsApp tax\" idea had been scrapped at around 11:00PM. Protesters saw the \"WhatsApp tax\" as the last straw, socially, politically and economically, against the entire political class, which was deemed corrupt and in need of immediate ousting.\non 18 October 2019]]\nProtesters in Nabatiyeh and Tripoli, on 18 October, vandalized the offices of the Hezbollah, Amal Movement, and Free Patriotic Movement political parties in an expression of disillusionment and in protest against perceived government corruption. Other protesters aimed to enter the Serail, which includes the Lebanese Parliament building, but were stopped by the use of tear gas from the Internal Security Forces. protesters created roadblocks on the major roads of the country, using burning tires and trash cans to stop access. Civil servants announced a strike with immediate effect through League of Public Sector Employees, arguing that the proposed reforms would \"undermine the rights of employees and pensioners in particular\". A cabinet meeting was due to be held in the afternoon, but ministers of the Lebanese Forces announced that they would not attend. The leader of the Forces, Samir Geagea, called for the resignation of the Prime Minister, due to the \"resounding failure to halt the deterioration of the [country's] economic situation\". After this announcement, the cabinet meeting was canceled by the Prime Minister. Leader of the Progressive Socialist Party, Walid Jumblatt, called for a \"calm and peaceful\" move against President Michel Aoun's mandate, and organized rallies in Aley, Bhamdoun, and Baakline to voice their opinions. Pierre Issa of the National Bloc voiced a similar opinion, calling for a \"government of specialists, a government reduced from public safety\". However, he criticized the involvement of political parties within the protests and argued it should remain something for the citizens to do. In the evening, Prime Minister Saad Hariri addressed the nation, giving his \"partners in government\" 72 hours to support the reforms. If they did not come to an agreement, he suggested he would take a \"different approach\". He tweeted \"72 hours...\" right after the delivered speech.\nFirst week: 19–24 October\n. Mohammad Al-Amin Mosque, 20 October 2019]]\nLebanese national Hussein Al-Attar was shot and killed during a protest on 19 October 2019. Former MP Mosbah al-Ahdab's bodyguards fired on protesters, no one was killed, but four were injured. The General Secretary of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, addressed the nation in the morning, speaking against the imposed taxes. However, he indicated that Hezbollah was against the government resigning and instead asked citizens to divert blame from Hariri's cabinet to the previous government, which was also to blame for the state of the economy. As the protests carried on throughout the day, there were reports of Amal Movement militants harassing and opening fire on protesters in Tyre.\nProtests were held around major European cities, as well as in North America and Australia, showing solidarity with the protesters in Lebanon. Due to the mounting pressure from protesters, the Lebanese Forces announced their resignation from the cabinet. Samir Geagea, their leader, had previously blamed his opponents for \"obstructing the necessary reforms,\" but since declared his \"lack of confidence in the current cabinet.\" His party held four seats within the government: Minister of Labor Camille Abou Sleiman, Minister of Administrative Development May Chidiac, Deputy Prime Minister Ghassan Hasbani, and Minister of Social Affairs Richard Kouyumjian.\n. 22 October 2019.]]\nOn 20 October, hundreds of thousands of protesters gathered in locations throughout the country, making it the largest demonstrations since 2005. Gunfire was heard outside the Tripoli office of Firas Al-Ali, an associate of Hariri. None were injured with the clash, and security forces were quick to act. At 6:00&nbsp;pm, protesters across the country united to sing the national anthem together.\nOn 21 October, a general strike was called across the country demanding an end to the country's economic problems. Some protesters began clearing away demonstration debris in Beirut after a social media call to keep the streets tidy and clear. In the afternoon, an emergency cabinet meeting was held. After the meeting, Prime Minister Hariri held a press conference in which he announced various economic reforms including halving the salaries of legislators and members of parliament, reducing the deficit by about US$3.4 billion in 2020 with the help of the Lebanese central bank and the banking sector, distributing financial aid to families living in poverty and giving US$160 million in housing loans. These proposals were unsuccessful at quelling protests. At night, several motorcyclists hoisting Hezbollah and Amal Movement were recorded heading towards the protests in central Beirut but were intercepted by the Lebanese Army. Soon thereafter, Hezbollah and the Amal Movement denied any involvement with the motorcyclists.\nHariri met on 22 October with ambassadors from the United States, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, and the European Union, along with representatives from China, the United Nations, and the Arab League. Hariri discussed planned reforms and stressed the importance of peaceful expression from the protesters. The representatives, who form the International Support Group for Lebanon, expressed support for economic reforms and protection of protesters, but urged the leaders of Lebanon to engage in open dialogue with the country's citizens.\nOn 23 October, Hariri held a meeting with the ministerial committee in charge of financial and economic reforms, discussing a draft law on the recovery of public money and requesting suggestions on it from the Supreme Judicial Council within ten days. In the evening, Hariri also held a meeting with members of the Progressive Socialist Party to discuss the latest developments in the country. Sheikh Akl of the Lebanese Druze community called for government dialogue to safeguard the rights of liberty, security and stability.\nPresident Michel Aoun addressed the population on 24 October, stating his willingness to hold a dialogue with the protesters and find the best solution forward. He supported Hariri's reforms but did confirm a need to \"review the current government\" within the \"state institutions\", and not through protesting. Hariri supported this review through Lebanon's \"constitutional mechanisms\", but the protesters rejected any calls for dialogue until the government has resigned.\nSecond week: 25–31 October\nduring her participation in the  protests, 28 April 2019.]]\nDespite calls for dialogue from President Aoun, protests and road blocks continued on 25 October 2019. Small scuffles broke out in central Beirut between protesters and Hezbollah supporters. One protester was injured. A report by Standard & Poor's downgraded its credit assessment of Lebanon to \"CreditWatch negative\" due to the government's low creditworthiness and economic pressures relating to the reforms. The country's banks remained closed. Hezbollah supporters again clashed with protesters in downtown Beirut, chanting in support of Hezbollah's General Secretary, Hassan Nasrallah. Nasrallah held a speech in the evening, calling his supporters to leave the streets. Within this speech, he praised the protesters for achieving economic reforms, but suggested that they were being exploited by local and foreign agents to start a civil war within the country. Nasrallah also strongly suggested that the protests are part of an Israeli and American plot.\nA security meeting was held on 26 October in Yarzeh to discuss how the safety and free movement of protesters could be ensured. Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea once more criticized the lack of response from the government towards the protesters' concerns. Meanwhile, thousands of Lebanese gathered in over thirty cities around the world on 26 and 27 October including Sydney, Paris, Houston and London in a show of support.\non 27 October 2019]]\non 27 October 2019]]\nTens of thousands of individuals took part in a \"human chain\" which was held on 27 October at the coastlines from the Northern city of Tripoli to the southern city of Tyre – encompassing  – organized with the intention to show the unity of the Lebanese people. The Maronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros al-Rahi during a Sunday sermon in Bkerké considered that the people are living their positive and reformist revolution. Pope Francis addressed the Lebanese people expressing their struggle in the face of challenges and social, moral and economic problems of the country, expressing he's praying that Lebanon can continue to be a place of peaceful coexistence, and urging the Lebanese government to listen to the concerns of the people.\nBlack-clad Hezbollah and Amal Movement supporters attacked protesters in Beirut on 29 October, tearing down and setting fire to the tents set up by the protesters, throwing plastic chairs, and beating anti-government protesters. Many among the angry mob chanted: \"God, Nasrallah, and the whole Dahyeh,\" in reference to the southern suburb that is a stronghold of the Iranian-backed militant group. They also chanted, \"Shia, Shia\", as a reverential reference to the country's Shiite Muslim sect. The Hezbollah and Amal Movement supporters also attacked TV crew members and destroyed live broadcasting equipment for the MTV (Lebanon) and Al Jadeed television channels, claiming that they were upset at the roadblocks and insults to their leader. Public squares across Beirut filled with protesters shortly after. Prime Minister Saad Hariri announced his resignation in a televised address on the afternoon of 29 October. Several hours after the resignation of the Prime Minister, celebrations swept the nation with demonstrators cautiously welcoming the resignation celebrated through fireworks, songs, and releasing flagged colored balloons.\nOn 30 October, tear gas was fired at protesters in the northern district of Akkar by the Lebanese Army trying to reopen the roads. Protesters also blocked roads in the southern city of Sidon and Bekaa Valley. In Central Beirut, dozens of protesters blocked the \"Ring Bridge\" while a big crowd returned to Tripoli's al-Nour Square to protest. The Lebanese Army intervened in many regions to prevent escalation. Later that evening a statement released from the Presidential Office said that Lebanese President Michel Aoun will address the nation the next day.\nPresident Aoun delivered a speech on 31 October in which he spoke about Lebanon's economic and financial crisis. He also spoke about his commitment to fighting corruption, ensuring political stability, eliminating terrorists, and the return of Syrian refugees within the country. He also promised the new government will be made up of specialists instead of political loyalists. Protesters took to the streets and blocked roads across the country almost immediately after President Aoun's address to the nation, demanding early parliamentary elections and the formation of a technocratic government. Demonstrators shut off roads in cities nationwide – including Sidon, Bekaa, and Khaldeh – with burning tires or by the sheer volume of protesters. In Tripoli, thousands of protesters started to gather at Al-Nour Square while in Beirut, protesters blocked the George Haddad highway which connects the waterfront road to the \"Ring Bridge\". The Lebanese Army and riot police were deployed across the country in an effort to reopen the roads.\nThird week: 1–7 November\nLebanon's banks reopened on 1 November 2019, after two weeks of closure, the longest bank closure in the nation's history. \"Unofficial\" capital controls were imposed by individual banks to prevent a bank run, with personal withdrawals being limited to US$3,000 per week or per month depending on individual banks. Corporate banking activity was similarly heavily restricted, and international bank transfers from Lebanon were halted almost completely, subject to manual per-transfer approval. Hezbollah's Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah offered a public speech in which he stated that Hezbollah feared a government overthrow, due to the consequent \"vacuum\" Lebanon would experience. Nasrallah's then-latest speech was perceived to be unclear on whether Hezbollah supported or opposed the nationwide revolutionary movement. Nasrallah again shed doubt on the motivations of the protesters during his speech, implying that they were being manipulated by foreign influences. As Lebanese schools universities remained closed during the protests, public teach-ins and debates, organized by secular political groups and advocacy organizations (Beirut Madinati, Libaladi, Lihaqqi and others) were offered in Beirut.\n, a city that was recognized as being a central source of energy for the protest movement. 2 November 2019.]]\nOn 3 November, thousands of Lebanese Free Patriotic Movement supporters attended a protest in support of President Michel Aoun, the founder of the party. During the protest, FPM leader Gebran Bassil made a personal statement for the first time in over 13 days. Bassil claimed \"We should block roads for MPs who refuse corruption-combating laws, politicians who escape accountability and judges who do not implement the law.\" He also demanded lifting banking secrecy on political officials' accounts and insisting accountability, as well as a return of misused or stolen public funds. In the afternoon, tens of thousands of anti-government protesters flooded the streets across Lebanon in a \"Sunday of unity\". Protesters gathered for the third consecutive Sunday since mass anti-government demonstrations began on 17 October, filling the streets and central squares of major cities including Beirut, Tripoli and Tyre. Dozens of main roads were closed by burning tires, mounts of sand, and by the sheer amount of protesters, despite an ongoing threat of violence from political-party opposition. Acts of violence from party rivals consisted around Lebanon, such as the attacks on protesters in Beirut blocking public roads. These attacks were presumed to be affiliated with Hezbollah.\nA candlelight vigil was held on 4 November in Baalbek in memorial of those who have perished in the Lebanese protest, while physical tensions from road blocking persisted in Beirut.\nOn 5 November, some students of American University of Science and Technology in Beirut showed attendance in protest and were met with harsh engagement from soldiers of the Lebanese Armed Forces. General Directorate of General Security officers were recorded verbally threatening students that were recording the protests. Protesters in Nabatieh, shut down companies such as OGERO, Liban Post, Banque du Liban and several banks despite state-exerted political pressure towards the protesters in this region. Protesters were present outside electrical company buildings, frustrated with decades of inconsistent power and common outages.\nThousands of students across Lebanon protested on 6 November in front of universities and schools refusing to attend classes until their demands are met. Several student-led movements have been organized since the start of the protests, in demand of a financial student contract, the reversal of the decision to charge tuition fees to the dollar currency in some universities, independent student councils in each university, and a well-funded Lebanese University. On the national scale, they have been asking for social, political, and economic reform, in hopes of finding respectable job prospects after graduation without nepotism or sect bias. Pension and retirement plans are also being demanded, as well as proper health care coverage. In the afternoon, protesters began to gradually grow across Lebanon and started protesting by the thousands in front of key governmental and private institutions and forced some of them to close their doors.\nFourth week: 8–14 November\nIt was reported on 9 November 2019 that the dollar-rationing policies implemented by Lebanese banks were at risk of causing major shortages and price hikes in gasoline, petrol, food, and other vital supplies. Suleiman Haroun, the head of the Lebanese Syndicate of Hospitals, said that medical stocks in the country \"will not last more than a month\" unless a solution is found. During the weekend, news spread of a planned parliamentary legislative session on 12 November that would include a proposed general amnesty law, which could grant current and past members protection against prosecution for crimes such as corruption and misuse of public funds. In response, protesters called for a general strike to be held on the same day, and published a list of demands which included bolstering guarantees for a speedy trial, working towards a solution for the economic crisis, guaranteeing the independence of the judiciary, and investigating the misuse of public funds.\n, 10 November 2019]]\nOn 11 November, the Lebanese Federation of Syndicates of Bank Employees called for a general strike for its 11,000 members over \"concerns for safety\". This strike is unprecedented in the country's history and its impact is unclear. No end date was specified for the strike, and a general closure of all Lebanese banks may very well be the result. Riad Salameh, the governor of Lebanon's central bank (Banque du Liban) gave a press conference in which he denied the possibility of capital control on the Lebanese economy, assured that a \"haircut\" on large accounts is not a possibility, and repeated that the central bank's priority remains on economic stability and confidence in the Lebanese pound. When asked about the strike by the bank staff union announced earlier in the day, Salameh claimed to have not yet heard of it. A few minutes after Salameh's press conference, Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri appeared on live television to announce that the following day's parliamentary session had been delayed until 19 November 2019, possibly as a response to protests called for during the weekend against the proposed general amnesty bill that was due to be discussed. Berri claimed the postponement was for \"security reasons\". In the afternoon, Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah gave a speech in which he made strong overtures towards a corruption investigation to be led by Lebanon's judiciary, offering for Hezbollah to collaborate fully with any such investigation and calling for a \"strong, independent judiciary\" to equally investigate all Lebanese parties without reservation. Nasrallah also called for banking secrecy and any prior amnesty for public representatives to be lifted, \"dating back to 1992\".\nOn 12 November, speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri was reported to have sent resigned Prime Minister Saad Hariri a pot of Leben, a traditional Lebanese dairy product, along with a note that promised \"eternal enmity\" if Hariri refused to form a new government. Hariri thanked Berri for the Leben but excused himself as having ceased eating all kinds of milks and cheeses due to lactose intolerance, concluding that \"indeed, the state of the country itself requires a new political diet or \"regime\", so to speak\". The unusual exchange was covered in Lebanese media. President Michel Aoun gave a live interview at 8:30&nbsp;pm, during which he rejected calls for a fully technocratic government, warned against a run on the bank further damaging the economic sector, and called for an immediate end to the protests to prevent a \"catastrophe\". Aoun accused protesters of \"stabbing the nation with a dagger\" and accused protesters that blocked roads of \"violating international law\". Aoun also stated that \"anyone who cannot find faith in the current Lebanese government can leave Lebanon and live somewhere else\". Aoun's interview proved exceedingly unpopular with the protest movement, which began blocking an unprecedented number of arterial roads in Beirut and across Lebanon before the interview was even concluded including Qob Elias, \"Ring Bridge\", Dahr el Baidar, Jiyyeh, Nahr el Kalb, Neemeh, Beddawi, Abdeh, Mahmara, Braqil, Madina Riyadiyya, Verdun, Jal el Dib, Hasbaya, the Palma highway, Aley, Cola, Dawra, Sayyfi, Corniche al Mazraa, and Sassine. Alaa Abou Fakhr, a Lebanese national, was shot and killed in Khalde at the ensuing protests.\nProtesters began appearing in the early morning of 13 November near the heavily fortified Baabda Presidential Palace to express dissatisfaction with President Aoun's speech a few hours earlier and picked up in pace as the day progressed.\nActivist and protester Khaldoun Jaber was released on 14 November after being detained by the Lebanese army in Baabda the previous day in mysterious circumstances. Jaber was shown to have marks of physical abuse upon his release, which he claimed were due to torture by the army during his detention. Jaber also claimed to have been exposed to psychological abuse. During his detention, Jaber was not given access to a lawyer with even the location of his detention being kept secret. The reason for his arrest was unclear, with some sources claiming it was due to attempting to cross a security perimeter during the previous day's protest near Baabda Palace.\nFifth week: 15–21 November\nAs the protests continue nationwide, Sleiman Haroun, the president of the Syndicate of Private Hospitals, threatened to have 15 November 2019 as a day of closure to all patients except the ones who have dialysis, chemotherapy treatment, and emergency care, unless some immediate action is taken by the authorities in the government. Haroun said the strike has nothing to do with the current protest and his purpose was to \"raise awareness\" and highlight the fact that the government has not been paying its full dues to the hospitals since 2011 and owes them a total of $1.3 billion as of today. Since no direct response was received, all hospitals in Metn, Akkar and Nabatieh areas went on strike that day; doctors along with the hospital's medical teams and staff were on the streets \"breathing their last breath\".\nCurrency and payment issues are causing additional burdens on hospitals. Hospitals are running out of medical supplies and equipment because they are 100% reliant on imported supplies and equipment. Due to the shortage of US currency in Lebanon, banks have not been able to transfer funds in US dollars to the companies who import these supplies. Suppliers now have to turn to exchange houses in order to get their US dollars, which end up charging significantly higher rates than the official rate of $1 to £L1,507.5, only if they had any dollars to sell. Suppliers have also not been paid by the hospitals as a result of the situation. If this continues, hospitals will only have one month before they run out of their current shelf stock. Hospitals have received no payment since the beginning of 2019 and salary reductions are being considered in many hospitals if the situation does not improve.\nBeirut Bar Association elections were held on 17 November. The independent candidate, Melhem Khalaf, won the majority vote (2,341 votes) to become the BBA's Council president and the first independent candidate to win against politically affiliated candidates in decades. Khalaf's contenders were Nader Gaspard, Saadeddine Al Khatib, and Ibrahim Moussallem. Pierre Hanna, who was backed by the Lebanese Forces, Progressive Socialist Party and the Future Movement, as well as twelve other candidates who either dropped out or were not voted in, competed for council positions.; 19 November 2019]]Parliament was set to hold two sessions in the morning of 19 November, including a legislative session that was opposed by protesters, due to it timetabling a controversial amnesty law that was perceived as potentially granting amnesty to crimes committed by the political class, such as misappropriation of public funds or corruption. The sessions were originally planned for 12 November but were already once postponed due to protests. 58 out of 128 Members of Parliament were boycotting the session, but that number was not sufficient to prevent a quorum. A human chain was planned around the Lebanese Parliament to prevent Members of Parliament from entering the premises and to thereby force the session to be postponed. Protesters began gathering early in the morning. Convoys for some Members of Parliament were recorded shooting live bullets or speeding into crowds in an attempt to disperse protesters. Many protesters were gravely injured. At around 11:20am, the Secretary-General of the Lebanese Parliament Adnane Daher confirmed to local media that both parliament sessions were postponed indefinitely. This was perceived as a victory by protesters. Lebanese banks reopened for the first time since 11 November after the Lebanese Federation of Syndicates of Bank Employees ended its strike.\nPresident Michel Aoun gave a speech on 21 November, on the eve of Lebanese Independence Day, in which he called for an end to protests and \"hateful language on the streets\" and promised an \"anti-corruption cabinet\". Protesters expressed dissatisfaction with the speech by resuming the closing of roads.\nSixth week: 22–28 November\nLebanon's 76th Independence Day was celebrated on 22 November 2019 with the nation's first-ever civil parade, which was organized by civil society groups in Beirut's Martyr's Square. An invite-only private military parade had been held in the early morning by the Lebanese government, and the civil parade was intended as a rebuke against the government organized by the \"true Lebanese\": the parade had \"battalions\" representing different groups from Lebanese society, including cooks, schoolteachers, retired military personnel, pharmacists, engineers, women's rights activists, bankers, athletes, performance artists and more. The civil parade coincided with a program of festival activities organized by independent groups, which included dancing and heat lantern lighting. Marches were held across the Beirut region in the morning, all arriving to the civil parade in central Beirut.\nOn 23 November, five youths, including children aged 12 and 15, were detained by Lebanese military intelligence after taking down a banner that supported the Free Patriotic Movement, which is the party of President Aoun. Their detention was reported to the media by their families, and the children were released past midnight after the intervention of volunteer lawyers.\nA protest was held on 24 November outside the United States embassy in Lebanon to express opposition to U.S. interference in Lebanon. The protest came after Hezbollah accused the United States in meddling with and delaying the formation of a new cabinet, and after comments made by U.S. ambassador Jeffrey Feltman in which he said that \"reactions to [Hezbollah] by Lebanese leaders and institutions fortunately coincide with U.S. interests\". Around noon, another protest was held across the Lebanese coastline to draw attention to the high level of environmental pollution in Lebanon. Right before midnight, pro-government Hezbollah and Amal Movement supporters violently clashed with protesters in the \"Ring\" bridge and Jal el Dib areas, demanding an end to road blocks imposed by protesters. This came after protesters apparently physically assaulted two people after suspecting them of being Hezbollah supporters.

But the scope of these attacks are now changing and diversifying.\" the organization's founding director Kiran Nazish said. \"Unfortunately this is an ever more precarious situation and it is important to point out to Lebanese authorities that they have a responsibility to protect the press.

In Tripoli, reports suggested that the dispute escalated to the extent of throwing a hand grenade, including the exchange of fire, Al Jazeera added.\nOn 12 August, angry Lebanese protesters shut down roads across Lebanon, following the central bank's move to end fuel subsidies. One protester was seriously wounded in the southern village of Zahrani, after being run over by a motorist, according to ABC News.\nOn 15 August, a fuel tanker exploded in northern Lebanon's Akkar District, killing 20 people and wounding at least 79 people more. Reports from the National News Agency suggested that the explosion was a result of a fuel container blowing up, that was seized by the army. More than 200 people were believed to have been at the scene when the incident took place. According to Deutsche Welle, the Lebanese Health Minister Hamad Hassan has stated that the government would sponsor the medical treatment of those affected by the explosion. Also, Kuwait has offered to sponsor the treatment for the burn victims of the blast, the Kuwait Red Crescent Society (KRCS) stated.\nSeptember 2021\nOn 16 September, an arrest warrant was issued for the former public works minister Youssef Finianos, by the leading judge investigating the 2020 Beirut explosion. According to Al Jazeera, the warrant was issued after Finianos failed to show up for questioning. The leading judge Tarek Bitar also charged three former top government officials alongside Finianos, with endangerment, which saw to the deaths of over 200 people in the Beirut blast.\nMeanwhile, the EU has demanded the establishment of a resolution within the UN framework, to look into the devastating Beirut Port blast. During a vote, 571 out of 681 members of the European Parliament supported the resolution which is aimed at approving sanctions on Lebanese officials who were involved in corruption or were responsible for hindering the investigation into the blast. The EU also urged for humanitarian aid to be distributed directly to the people requiring assistance, considering the extreme mishandling of relief funds provided to Lebanon in the past.\nOctober Tayouneh clashes\nOn October 14, 2021, a protest in Beirut, led by the Amal Movement, Hezbollah and the Marada Movement, demanded the resignation of the lead judge probing the 2020 Beirut port's explosion. As the protest went on and the situation got more violent when protesters began to shout sectarian slogans, destroy property and harass passersby in the region of Tayouneh, snipers from roofs started shooting against the protestors in the streets, giving start to the clashes between Shia militants and armed civilians that killed 7 people and wounded 32 more. Hezbollah accused the Lebanese Forces, a Christian political group; the group denied the accusation. The gunfight included assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades. Some of the deceased include a militant who had previously fought in Syria under Hezbollah.\n2022\nRiad Salemeh trials\nIn February 2022, a subpoena was issued by Judge Ghada Aoun after Riad Salameh failed to show up to court for questioning, while his whereabouts were unknown after a raid in his office and 2 homes, as part of an investigation for alleged misconduct and corruption. This sparked controversy with another security agency that was accused of protecting him from trial. Later in March 21, Salameh along with his brother Raja were charged for illicit enrichment by Ghassan Oueidat but also failed to attend for questioning. His brother, Raja Salameh spent a month in detention but was released on May 22 while on a record bail of 100 billion LBP.\nOn June 21, 2022, his home was raided again by Lebanese security forces.\nRole of women in the October Revolution\nFeminist movements have been widely recognized for their significant role in driving social change and advocating for gender equality globally. The October 17 Revolution in Lebanon was characterized by the substantial participation of women, which underscores the country's legacy of feminist activists, as well as the participation of other marginalized groups such as the LGBT movement and migrant workers. UN Women estimates indicate that during the initial phase of protests, women constituted at least half of the protest population in Beirut and Tripoli, and one-third in Baalbek and Nabatieh, showcasing a remarkable gender parity that is de facto unseen in many revolts across the Middle-Eastern and North Africa region. This level of participation serves to illustrate Lebanon's active civil society and the enduring legacy of feminist activism. Driven by grievances related to governance, corruption, and economic challenges, women from diverse backgrounds emerged as key figures in shaping and sustaining the movement.\nIn the years preceding the October uprising, Lebanon witnessed the emergence of a feminist public sphere, where women's organizations and groups played a cruicial role in highlighting issues of gender inequality. Through lobbying efforts and activism, feminists pushed for legal reforms to address institutional inequalities and provide platforms to foster solidarity. In drawing upon past movements such as the 2011 protests against sectarianism and the 2015 garbage crisis protests, women entered the October Revolution with a wealth of experience in grassroots activism.\nWhat distinguished the October uprising was its wide-ranging audience, offering feminist activists unprecedented opportunities to address national issues in highly networked and media-savvy environments. Campaigns aiming to criminalize domestic violence and sexual harassment gained traction, shedding light on systemic challenges faced by women. These efforts succeeded in raising awareness about women's experiences in intimate relationships and within families, amplifying their voices nationally.\nActivists, mobilizers and organizers\nWomen in the protests have taken on diverse roles, encompassing the leadership of political organization, the planning of rallies and marches, the writing of articles, and the generation of messaging through slogans and signs. Women have also been engaged in a range of activities within public discussions pertaining to a variety of issues, including political reforms, environmental concerns, and the necessity of a unified personal status law. In addition, women have organized public educational sessions and created environments conducive to women's safety, as evidenced by the establishment of a camp in downtown Beirut. Additionally, they have extended support to protesters by offering practical assistance, including cooking, distributing supplies, providing legal aid and leading initiatives for waste management at protest sites. These demonstrations have not only created new avenues for dialogue on women's rights and political participation, especially in regions with conservative gender norms, but have also facilitated increased access to public spaces for women, notably during nighttime. Consequently, they have cultivated increased societal acceptance of their involvement in politics.\nIntersectional advocacy\nWomen's involvement in the protests marks a turning point for gender equality, challenging entrenched patriarchal norms and discriminatory laws. Some of the questionable practises that are used on marginalized minorities consist of hymen and anal exams. Where the role of medical evidence is used to oppress and control bodies. Moreover, they have embraced an approach including feminism and intersectionality, addressing multiple forms of oppression, with the objective of promoting social justice and inclusivity as noted by Sarah Boukhary, the Interim MENA Co-director of WILPF. Feminist groups engage in advocacy efforts such as organizing vigils for marginalized groups and protesting against racism and homophobia, while also addressing systemic issues like the Kafala system, refugee exploitation, and LGBTQ+ discrimination. The Kafala system particularly affects female migrant workers in Lebanon, subjecting them to exploitation and inequality due to unclear contracts and institutional structures.\nWomen have been instrumental in pushing for reforms to Lebanon's sectarian system, aiming to achieve equal rights in citizenship and inheritance. Lebanon's legal system comprises 15 sectarian personal status laws, which allow for discrimination based on gender and religion, affecting marriage, nationality rights, and child custody. A Human Rights Watch report revealed significant gender disparities in divorce and childcare access among women of all religious backgrounds. Additionally, women's political representation remains disproportionately low, with only 3% of Parliament being women following the 2018 elections.\nTactics\nThe active involvement of women in Lebanon during the uprising showcased a departure from solely traditional non-confrontational methods, as they adeptly employed both confrontational and non-confrontational approaches. While confrontational tactics like marches and protests directly challenged the status quo, non-confrontational methods such as boycotts and petitions provided indirect yet impactful avenues for advocacy.\nAlthough the prevalence of violence against women was not as high as that against men, it did occur and affected some women. This manifested as instances where women were beaten or attempted to breach barriers blocking access to key locations. The symbolic act of Malak Alaywe Herz kicking an armed bodyguard on the revolution's first night emerged as a powerful metaphor against the corrupt and patriarchal political system. It resonated with those involved in the uprising and became an iconic image of resistance. These findings challenge previous research that assigned specific tactics and roles to women and men, as corroborated by feminist activists on the ground.\nDespite employing diverse tactics, women predominantly engaged in peaceful conflict resolution. This was evidenced by their participation in organized marches in Tripoli and Baalbek, which aimed to address politico-sectarian tensions. They also led rallies, blocked roads, and de-escalated violence. Additionally, they played a pivotal role in providing a physical buffer between protesters and security forces during moments of heightened tension. By utilising platforms such as WhatsApp to swiftly coordinate and assemble at protest sites and form a human barrier to prevent the escalation of violence, they also played with gendered norms to mitigate violence.\nFor instance, older women strategically invoked the concept of motherhood when engaging with soldiers, using phrases like \"Don't harm us, I could be your mom,\" to appeal to their sense of compassion and discourage violence. Additionally, women act as informal mediators, negotiating access at roadblocks and diffusing conflicts between armed forces and protesters. Women-led unity marches in Beirut, Jal Al-Deeb, and Tripoli followed nights of violence, leading to a significant decrease in politicized violence for nearly two weeks. These efforts align with global trends suggesting that women's active involvement reduces the likelihood of armed conflict in protests.\nPublic reaction\nWhile local and international media extensively covered women's participation in the protests, some reports sensationalized their involvement, labeling the uprising as \"female-led\" or a \"women's uprising\", feminist activists expressed concerns about this representation, fearing it could reinforce gender divides and overshadow the broader concerns shared by all participants.\nFemale participants faced notable backlash, often being objectified and subjected to derogatory comments, contradicting the movement's aim to combat such behavior. For example, an Arab newspaper titled an article on feminist protests as \"Lebanese babes: all beautiful women are revolting.\" Furthermore, demonstrators against the Kafala system were subjected to racist and sexist remarks by bystanders, which underscores the interconnected systemic challenges in Lebanon.\nPost-revolution status of women in Lebanon\nIn the aftermath of Lebanon's 2019 October Revolution, women's progress has been impeded by a series of crises, including the global pandemic of 2020, the economic collapse, and the Beirut Port explosion. These events had a disproportionate impact on women, resulting in increased gender-based violence, higher unemployment rates, and a decline in overall safety. The UNHCR's report indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic led to an increase in gender-based violence, with 54% of women reporting an increase in abuse and harassment, while almost 44% reported a decline in their sense of safety at home. The economic crisis has led to a projected surge in female unemployment rates, with women's unemployment expected to increase by 63%. The August 4 Beirut Port blast further compounded these challenges, threatening employment opportunities and exacerbating the risk of gender-based violence and harassment, particularly among displaced women.\nConsequently, Lebanon experienced a 13-place decline in the World Economic Forum's 2023 gender equality ranking, with the country now ranking 132nd out of 146 countries. The cessation of recognition of foreign civil marriages by the General Directorate of Personal Status in September 2022, for instance, represents a regression in women's rights, as documented by Human Rights Watch in 2024. Despite a notable increase in female candidates in the 2022 parliamentary elections, women continue to be underrepresented in political leadership. With only 6.4% of parliamentary seats held by women, as per UN Women Lebanon's 2022 report, achieving gender parity remains a significant challenge in the country's political landscape.\nGeneral analysis and reactions\nIn contrast to the 2005 Cedar Revolution, in which support for the main sides of the political conflict were aligned with political parties and the Sunni–Shiite Muslim sociological and religious divide in Lebanon, the 2015–2016 Lebanese protests started to include criticism of leaders within the anti-Hezbollah community. The 2019 protests bypassed this sociological divide further, as they were part of a genuine grassroots movement that has not been directed by any political party, cross-sectarian in a broader sense than those of 2015 and taking place across Lebanon, rather than only in Beirut. The protests are an existential threat to the Lebanese government and political elite and a revolution. The 2019 society-wide nature of the protests has its seed in the 2015–2016 protests. Although these protests were not conclusive and did not achieve their main goal of dismantling the political system as intended, they were beneficial on many levels.\nInternational reactions\ngives a talk about his reporting about public sector corruption. Beirut, 28 November 2019.]]\n* U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo – \"The Iraqi and Lebanese people want their countries back. They are discovering that the Iranian regime's top export is corruption, badly disguised as revolution. Iraq and Lebanon deserve to set their own courses free from Khamenei's meddling.\"\n* U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren – \"I support the Lebanese people protesting and demanding their government take care of all of its people, not just the rich and powerful.\"\n* U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders – \"The Arab Spring rose up to fight corruption, repression, inequality, and austerity. The Lebanon and Iraq protests show this spirit is still very much alive.\"\n* Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei – \"The people have justifiable demands, but they should know their demands can only be fulfilled within the legal structure and framework of their country.\"\n* Spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada Barbara Harvey – \"Canada calls on all Lebanese parties and leaders to reject violence and encourage a peaceful and timely transition to a new government, which respects and responds to the will of the Lebanese people.\"\n* French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian – \"Prime Minister Hariri resigned a few moments ago, which in a way makes the crisis even more serious. [...] Lebanon's stability depends on a willingness to listen to people and their demands.\" France also proposed a comprehensive list of reforms it is pressuring Lebanon to implement before 2021 in order for it to receive international aid.\nAftermath\nDespite the relaxation of the civil disorder upon Lebanese government formation in September 2021, the country continued experiencing economic and civil difficulties. The Lebanese energy market practically collapsed upon fuel shortage and on October 9, the country plunged into a 24-hour national blackout, as power plants ran out of fuel.\nThe security situation deteriorated on October 14, as militant clashes erupted in Beirut between the pro-Hezbollah camp and their opposition, resulting in 6 deaths. The violence erupted during a protest organized by Hezbollah and its allies against the lead judge probing 2020 explosion in the city's port. The location of the clashes was the Justice Palace, located along the former front line between Muslim Shiite and Christian areas.\nBy January 2022, BBC News reported that the crisis in Lebanon had deepened further, with the value of the Lebanese pound plummeting and a scheduled general election expected to be delayed indefinitely. The same month there was a general strike across the country by the public transportation and labour unions.\nIn politics\nMany reformist groups emerged during the 2018 Lebanese general elections standing against the 9-year ruling and mostly repeat deputies in parliament and sought for change. Most notable of the group was the Kuluna Watani alliance. The alliance gathered with a new Political Party (\"[http://www.sabaa.org/ Sabaa]\") and 10 different campaign and groups, most of which are connected to campaigns started in the protest movements of 2015 or the municipal elections of 2016. The alliance included in addition to Sabaa which is a nationwide secular Political Party few local political groups, namely Libaladi in Beirut 1 and Lihaqqi in Mount Lebanon 4. Speaking at inauguration event, Charbel Nahas, whose party Citizens within a State joined the Koullouna Watani lists at a later stage, said the purpose of the lists was to provide an alternative to the \"corrupted\" power in Lebanese politics. The Shiite Taharror movement was also established in the wake of the protests.\n2022 elections\nDuring the 2022 Lebanese general elections, many activists and previous organizations expressed intent to run with goals of replacing the political class and reforming the country. These organizations include, Citizens in a State which ran under the Qadreen lists, Shamaluna which ran in the North III district and the Mada network which was made out of multiple smaller reform groups. Many older and tradition parties joined October 17 lists such as the historic National Bloc Party and the Lebanese Communist Party and other larger parties claimed to be members of the movement like the Kataeb party, the Independence Movement and the Popular Nasserist Organization (PNO).\nIn total, these candidates received 237,667 votes (13.14%) and won 13 seats which formed a new reformist bloc in the Lebanese parliament.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Name\n!Election Area\n!Political Affiliation\n!Seat\n|-\n|Cynthia Fadi Zarazir\n|Beirut 1\n| ReLebanon\n|Christian Minorities\n|-\n|Paula Sirakan Yacobian\n|Beirut 1\n| Tahalof Watani\n|Armenian Orthodox\n|-\n|Ibrahim Mneimneh\n|Beirut 2\n| Beirut Tuqawem\n|Sunni\n|-\n|Melhem Khalaf\n|Beirut 2\n| Independent\n|Greek Orthodox\n|-\n|Waddah Sadek\n|Beirut 2\n| Khatt Ahmar\n|Sunni\n|-\n|Rami Fanj\n|North 2 – Tripoli\n| Independent\n|Sunni\n|-\n|Michel Chawki El Doueihy\n|North 3 – Zgharta\n| Osos Lebanon\n|Maronite\n|-\n|Halima Ibrahim Kaakour\n|Mount Lebanon 4 – Chouf\n| Lana\n|Sunni\n|-\n|Mark Bahjat Daou\n|Mount Lebanon 4 – Chouf\n| Taqqadum\n|Druze\n|-\n|Najat Saliba\n|Mount Lebanon 4 – Chouf\n| Taqqadum\n|Maronite\n|-\n|Elias Fares Jradeh\n|South 3 – Marjeyoun-Hasbaya\n| Independent\n|Greek Orthodox\n|-\n|Firas Ismail Hamdan\n|South 3 – Marjeyoun-Hasbaya\n| Independent\n|Druze\n|-\n|Yassin Yassin\n|Bekaa 2 – West Bekaa-Rashaya\n| Independent\n|Sunni\n|}\n2022 speakership elections\nAlong with many others, it was in nature for October 17 MPs to opt out on voting for long-time speaker Nabih Berri. For the deputy speaker the MPs voted for newly elected MP Ghassan Skaff however he still lost to long-time politician Elias Bou Saab.\nThe 2 secretaries of parliament were elected immediately after the Deputy Speaker. Although not constitutionally required, it was decided that the secretaries would be attributed to one Maronite Christian and one Druze.\nThe election process of the 2 deputies had large debate particularly by opposition MPs. It was suggested that each MP votes for both preferences in the same ballot and that the positions should not be based on religion. However, it was decided that voting would take place on the basis of one name per ballot. As a result of this Firas Hamdan, an opposition MP, who was one of few candidates for the Druze secretary, withdrew his candidacy in protest of the sectarian electoral procedure.\nDisagreements\nThe newly formed bloc continuously faced disagreements with each other, like voting on the premiership and the presidency, failure to create common grounds with other parliamentary blocs and failing to unite with the parliament opposition. This led to the withdrawal of 2 MPs from the bloc, Michel Doueihy of Osos Lebanon and Waddah Sadek of Khatt Ahmar, both citing political tensions.\nSee also\n* 1991-1992 Lebanese protests\n* 2006-2008 Lebanese protests\n* 2011 Lebanese protests\n* 2015–2016 Lebanese protests\n* 2019–2021 Chilean protests\n* 2019–2021 Iraqi protests\n* 2020s in political history\n* Politics of Lebanon\nReferences"
