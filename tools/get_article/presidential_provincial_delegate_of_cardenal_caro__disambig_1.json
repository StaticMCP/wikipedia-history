The delegate is designated by the president.\nThe first governor of Cardenal Caro Province was Marcelo Nogueira Hidalgo, appointed by dictator Augusto Pinochet Ugarte, and the last was Carlos Ortega Bahamondes, who was appointed on March 11, 2018 by President Sebastián Piñera Echenique.

The communes of Litueche (formerly El Rosario), La Estrella, Marchihue, Paredones, and Pichilemu, originally from Colchagua Province; and Navidad, originally from San Antonio Province, formed the province. The first governor of Cardenal Caro was Marcelo Nogueira Hidalgo, who held the office from 1979 until 1990.\nIn 2021, a new regionalization law was enacted and the former post of governor of Cardenal Caro province was replaced by the presidential provincial delegate of Cardenal Caro. Then governor Carlos Ortega Bahamondes, originally appointed in 2018, was confirmed as presidential provincial delegate by president Sebastián Piñera on 14 July 2021.\nList of governors\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n!#\n!Name\n!Took office\n!Left office\n|-\n!1\n|Marcelo Nogueira Hidalgo\n|1979\n|1990\n|-\n!2\n|Hernán Vieira Herrera\n|1990\n|1994\n|-\n!3\n|Rolando Cárdenas Ibarra\n|1994\n|2000\n|-\n!4\n|Cristián Oyarzún Estay\n|2000\n|2002\n|-\n!5\n|José Saúl Bravo Gallegos\n|2002\n|2004\n|-\n!6\n|Fabricio Jiménez Mardones\n|2004\n|2006\n|-\n!7\n|Hernán San Martín Valdés\n|2006\n|2007\n|-\n!8\n|Loreto Puebla Muñoz\n|2009\n|11 March 2010\n|-\n!9\n|Julio Diego Ibarra Maldonado\n|16 March 2010\n|12 March 2014\n|-\n!10\n|Teresa Núñez Cornejo\n|12 March 2014\n|11 March 2018\n|-\n!11\n|Carlos Ortega Bahamondes\n|11 March 2018\n|14 July 2021\n|}\nList of presidential provincial delegates\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!#\n!Name\n!Took office\n!Left office\n|-\n!1\n| Carlos Ortega Bahamondes\n| 14 July 2021\n| 11 March 2022\n|-\n!2\n| Carlos Cisterna Pavez\n| 11 March 2022\n| 26 October 2023\n|-\n! 3\n| Josefina Toro Rodríguez\n| 1 December 2023\n| Incumbent\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links"
