      "text": "# Renaissance Weekend\n\nRenaissance Weekend is the name for a recurring series of invitation-only gatherings founded and hosted by Linda and Philip Lader. The concept was founded in 1981 with the objective of bridging traditional divides of professions, politics, religion, race and age. It substantially increased in prominence when repeat-participant Bill Clinton was elected president in 1992. A few other notable past participants include Hillary Clinton, Supreme Court Justices Harry Blackmun, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, Donald Rumsfeld, Daniel Schorr, Wolf Blitzer Buzz Aldrin, and Mary Chapin Carpenter among many others.\nOrganized several times throughout the year, each Renaissance Weekend consists of seminars, discussions, informal lectures and performances.  Substantive conversations and program contributions by all participants are fostered by a casual, welcoming culture. Civility, non-partisanship, non-commercialism and public-spirited impact are the gatherings’ hallmarks.\nHistory\nRenaissance Weekend was founded, and continues to be hosted, by Linda and Philip Lader as a forum. The largest gathering is still held around New Year's with the smaller weekends throughout the year. More than 155 Renaissance Weekends have taken place.\nAmong the 60 families who initiated the first Weekend on Hilton Head Island were Marian Wright Edelman, David Gergen, Fred Malek, Governors Richard Riley and Terry Sanford, Stan Smith, Diane Sawyer, and Tim Wirth. Republican and Democratic candidates for US President, and 26 Nobel laureates, have attended. Presidents Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton co-chaired Renaissance Weekend's 25th anniversary. The 40th anniversary Weekend was celebrated by 1,000 participants.\nFormat and Activities\nAttendees design their own schedules from the available activities, talks, and sessions in the event program. The program features a range of topics connected to civic, industry, political and arts interests. Additional activities are available for youths in attendance.\nPeople from a range of professional backgrounds and interests attend the events. Invitees are nominated by past participants. The criteria for invitation are professional innovation and/or distinction, potential contribution to the program's breadth and depth, and likely commitment to Renaissance's off-the-record, civility, non-partisan and non-commercial spirit and traditions.\nThe gatherings are organized by a non-profit institute. To preserve its independence no corporate sponsorships are sought. Attendees cover the cost of participation.\nSpecific Renaissance Weekends’ attendance are not disclosed publicly; the gatherings discourage personal screen device usage; and the Renaissance Institute does not seek publicity. Commercial or overtly promotional activity is not permitted at the Weekends.\nReferences"
