On its creation in 2007 and in 2012, it returned four council members, using the single transferable vote system. For the 2017 Glasgow City Council election, the boundaries were changed substantially, the ward slightly decreased in population and returned three members.\nBoundaries\nSituated to the west of Glasgow city centre, the core of the ward which has remained since its 2007 creation consists of Hillhead, Kelvinbridge, Gilmorehill (the University of Glasgow main campus), Woodlands and Woodside, with boundaries being the M8 motorway to the south-east and the Port Dundas branch of the Forth and Clyde Canal to the north-east.\nOther aspects of the ward were substantially altered in 2017, with the Dowanhill and Hyndland neighbourhoods reassigned to a new Partick East/Kelvindale ward and Byres Road becoming the south-west boundary; most of the North Kelvinside neighbourhood (streets to the east of Queen Margaret Drive, which became Hillhead's north-west boundary) was gained from the Canal ward, and the Park District (along with Kelvingrove Park itself) was gained from the Anderston/City ward, with the park's south entrances the new southern boundary of Hillhead.\nFollowing these alterations, it was the smallest ward in physical size but the most densely populated, despite the park taking up a proportion of the territory.\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2011 census, the ethnicity of the population was:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
