During the UNP rule he was known for not following party regulations regarding voting for emergency regulations. He always voted to rescind it.

Generally he had voiced support for the war effort against the LTTE but had highlighted the civilian repercussions.\nMaheswaran would shout and make emotional speeches in Parliament. Some dismissed  as theatrics, others felt he is speaking from the heart. He could speak Tamil, English and Sinhala and a pleasant person to converse with. Maheswaran was immensely rich in later life but always retained the common touch. He was great favourite with minor staff in Parliament.\nJust before his death, he had accused the rival Eelam People's Democratic Party  as being behind the rash of murders targeting civilians in the Jaffna peninsula. Just before his death, his security staff was reduced from 11 to 2 by the government after the budget speech. He was accused by D. B. S. Jeyaraj of being a Hindu chauvinist and eroding \"Tamil religious unity\" by supporting the anti-Conversion bill espoused by Sinhalese Buddhist politicians  during his term as Hindu affairs minister.\nAssassination\nMaheswaran left his residence B32, 36th Lane, Wellawatte on the morning of the New Year's Day to worship at the Shree Ponnambalaneswaran Sivan Temple at Kotahena. Maheswaran had inducted some trusted Tamil youths to be his unofficial bodyguards. These youth did not carry firearms but generally surrounded Maheswaran when he moved about. In actual terms they provided body cover. Only L Dharmasiri, a 38 year old policemen assigned as his official bodyguard carried a gun. Maheswaran's 4-year-old daughter also accompanied her father to the temple.\nAt the Sivan Temple he went through all rituals including the walk around the inner circle or \"ulveethi\". He also conducted a special \"Archanai\" or Pooja. According to the up country Peoples Front Colombo Municipal Councillor  VT Gurusamy he saw Maheswaran standing engrossed his devour near the \"moolasthanam\" or sanctrum, obvious to his surroundings or people around him.\nMaheswarn was going out with his \" Kalanji\" cocunt in one hand and clasping his daughter with other, at about 9.30 a.m, when the assassin made his move. He was standing on the steps outside the main entrance to the temple. The killer moved closer as Maheswaran emerged and opened fire. Maheswaran fell with four bullet wounds in his chest and head. The cocunt turned red with his blood.\nHe was shot dead by unknown gunman while attending the New Year prayers at Kotahena, Sivan Kovil around 10:35 local time (05:05 GMT) and later succumbed to his injuries at the Colombo General Hospital along with one Hindu pilgrim who was too attending to the prayers. He had escaped an earlier assassination attempt in 2004. UNP parliamentarians Johnston Fernando and Dayasiri Jayasekara accused the current government as responsible by saying that T. Maheswaran's plan to reveal Jaffna situation has led to his murder. The government has denied any responsibility.
