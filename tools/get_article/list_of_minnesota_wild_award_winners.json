Fourteen All-Star Games have been held since the Wild entered the league in 2000, with at least one player chosen to represent the Wild in each year except 2001 and 2002. The All-Star game has not been held in various years: 1979 and 1987 due to the 1979 Challenge Cup and Rendez-vous '87 series between the NHL and the Soviet national team, respectively, 1995, 2005 and 2013 as a result of labor stoppages, 2006, 2010, and 2014 because of the Winter Olympic Games, 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2025 when it was replaced by the 2025 4 Nations Face-Off. Minnesota has hosted one of the games. The 54th took place at Xcel Energy Center.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\"\n|+Minnesota Wild players and coaches selected to the All-Star Game\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" | Game\n!scope=\"col\" | Year\n!scope=\"col\" | Name\n!scope=\"col\" | Position\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| References\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 51st\n|2001\n|No Wild selected\n|—\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 52nd\n|2002\n|No Wild selected\n|—\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 53rd\n|2003\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| 54th\n| rowspan=\"2\"|2004\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 55th\n|2007\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 56th\n|2008\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 57th\n|2009\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 58th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2011\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 59th\n|2012\n| (Did not play)\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 60th\n|2015\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 61st\n|2016\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" | 62nd\n|rowspan=\"3\" |2017\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 63rd\n|2018\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 64th\n|2019\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 65th\n|2020\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| 66th\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2022\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 67th\n|2023\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 68th\n|2024\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nCareer achievements\nHockey Hall of Fame\nThe Minnesota Wild have not had any players or personnel who have been enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame.
