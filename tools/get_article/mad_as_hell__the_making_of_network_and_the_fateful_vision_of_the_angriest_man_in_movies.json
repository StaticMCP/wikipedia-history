The book also has information on the principal people involved in the film.\nRob Lowe of The New York Times described the work as \"an inspiring, conflict-driven account of the\" creation of a film.\nBackground\nItzkoff used the writings of Paddy Chayefsky (the screenwriter of Network), interviews, and documentation from the filming as sources. People interviewed include Anderson Cooper, Stephen Colbert, and Bill O'Reilly.\nReception\nTed Koppel stated that the book \"is elegantly executed\"; Koppel did not see as much reasoning in the book on the reasons why the film was made, while he found more information on how the creation was done. He concluded that the author \"is right to give Paddy Chayefsky his due as a cultural icon.\"\nKirkus Reviews described the book as \"solid\" and that people who enjoy the film would deem the work \"irresistible\"; the magazine stated that people who were not fans of Network may not be \"convinced by Itzkoff’s case for Network’s prescience and cultural significance\".\nPublishers Weekly wrote that the author's \"chilling analysis of Network as prophecy\" was \"real achievement\" of the author.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250062246/madashell/ Mad as Hell] - Macmillan Publishers"
