In addition, it is illegal to smoke in outdoor locations that are close to children's schools and hospitals, and it is illegal to advertise, promote or sponsor any tobacco products to the public; however, this law does not apply to tobacconist shops which are allowed to advertise tobacco related products.\nThe legal age to buy tobacco is 18 years in Norway, but 10%-12%  of 15-year-olds smoke daily or weekly, and 31% of adults smoke daily or occasionally. The overall proportion of smokers is decreasing.\ndaily or occasionally]]\nIn Norway in 2008, approximately 17% of adult men used snus daily or occasionally, while 4% of adult women used snus daily or occasionally.
