This 90-minute film is a dramatisation of the sinking of the RMS Lusitania on 7 May 1915 by a German U-boat, .\nThe Lusitania scenes were filmed with full-scale sections of the ship off the coast of South Africa while the U-20 scenes were filmed at Bavaria Studios in Munich using the then-newly refurbished 25-year-old U-boat set, studio model and full-size prop originally built for the 1981 West German war film Das Boot.\nPlot\nIn May 1915, the RMS Lusitania departs New York City on a transatlantic voyage to Liverpool during World War I. Among the passengers are American publisher Charles Lauriat, wealthy art collector and nationalist Sir Hugh Lane, and socialite Theodate Pope, accompanied by her companion Edwin Friend. Captain William Turner commands the liner, while warnings circulate of German submarine activity off the Irish coast. The narrative also follows the German U-boat U-20, commanded by Kapitänleutnant Walther Schwieger, as it patrols the waters near southern Ireland.\nOn May 7, U-20 sights the Lusitania off the coast of County Cork and fires a torpedo, which strikes the ship’s starboard side. A second, more powerful explosion follows, causing rapid flooding. Panic spreads as passengers attempt to board lifeboats, many of which are improperly launched or capsize. Pope and Friend are thrown into the sea; Friend drowns while Pope survives after clinging to wreckage. Lauriat manages to escape in a lifeboat, while Lane is lost in the sinking. Captain Turner remains on the bridge until he is washed into the sea, later rescued by fishermen. Within 18 minutes, the ship founders, resulting in the deaths of nearly 1,200 people, including 128 Americans. The aftermath shows the international outrage that follows, particularly in the United States, where the sinking becomes a significant factor in the eventual decision to enter the war.\nFull cast\nRMS Lusitania\n*John Hannah as Professor Ian Holbourn survived\n*Kenneth Cranham as Captain William Turner survived\n*Madeleine Garrood as Avis Dolphin survived\n*Graham Hopkins as Staff captain James C.
