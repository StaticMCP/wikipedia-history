It is similar to Pou and the fourteenth game of the Talking Tom & Friends series overall. It was the first Outfit7 game to feature the smoother animation, and to feature Talking Tom's current design. A similar game called My Talking Angela was released on 3 December 2014, with its sequel released on 13 July 2021. Another similar game called My Talking Hank was released on 2 December 2016. A sequel, My Talking Tom 2, was released on 3 November 2018. Yet another similar game called My Talking Tom Friends was released on 11 June 2020.\nIt was the first game to be released under the franchise's new name.\nGameplay\nThe goal of the game is to take care of an anthropomorphic grey tabby cat named Tom who can optionally be renamed by the player. The player is invited to care for Tom and help him grow from a baby kitten to a full-grown tomcat by interacting with him in different ways, such as feeding him, taking him to the bathroom, playing mini games, and tucking him into his bed to sleep when he is tired. Tom can repeat words spoken into the device's microphone for up to 25 seconds using a synthesized voice. Through in-app purchases, in-game currency, or by logging into Facebook (Facebook features were removed in 2018 and before 2020 in older app versions), there is an option to visit Tom's friends (Removed In 2016), or travel around the world using in-game tickets. Using in-game currency, various different outfits, skins, and accessories can be purchased to dress-up and customize Tom. In-game currencies such as coins or diamonds can be earned through various ways including: mini games, a treasure chest, in-game TV ads or special logins. All in-game currency purchases including furniture, appliances, outfits, fur designs, eyes and shops are unlocked at specific levels when using coins, but they are purchasable in any level using diamonds.\nAge inappropriate advertising controversy\nThe game was reported for having advertised age-inappropriate advertisements for adult services. In 2015, the UK Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled that advertising for an adult website was delivered to underage children via the game. The ASA noted that Outfit7 \"had a strict advertising policy\" but that the company \"had not been able to identify which ad network had served an age-inappropriate ad on a children's app\" and how the advertisements were shown in the app.\nMy Talking Tom 2\nMy Talking Tom 2 is a sequel to My Talking Tom, it was released on 6 November 2018. The game has an identical objective to the original game, with newer additions such as a toybox, pets, and events featuring collaborations between Outfit7 and other entities.\nThe My Talking Tom 2 app is similar to the My Talking Tom app but with some additions and subtractions. Some additions include:\nPets: Unlike the other game, this one (Talking Tom 2) has pets which you can also take care of.
