A bigger Russian detachment led by Andrey Kurbsky could not defeat the retreating Polish detachment under the command of Stanisław Leśniowolski.\nModern Polish researches estimating the number of Russians as 25,000. According to the Russian military historian Alexander Filyushkin, this is practically a half of the overall Russian military forces of Ivan the Terrible. He also considers that the battle was massively exaggerated for political reasons in the Polish-Lithuanian chronicles. The Russian losses caused by a 1,500 men strong Lithuanian force grew to over 8,000 while the overall strength of the Russian army was described as 40,000 people.\nResult\nIn modern historiography, the assessment of events is interpreted in different ways, for example, Alexander Filyushkin (2012) and  (2018) believe that the battle ended in a draw. Another opinion is expressed by Polish sources, who assess the battle as a defensive polish victory.\nReferences and notes\nReferences\nNotes"
