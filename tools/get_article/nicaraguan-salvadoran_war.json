Barrios instructed Máximo Jerez to invade Nicaragua in April. Although Salvadorans defeated Martinez's troops at San Jacinto on April 28, they were repelled by the Nicaraguans near León on April 29.\nBarrios' plan to seize the port of Corinto by sea failed, while Nicaraguans managed to capture Amapala. In this situation, the President of El Salvador learned that General Carrera was mobilizing troops towards El Salvador once again.\nReferences"
