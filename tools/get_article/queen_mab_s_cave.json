      "text": "# Queen Mab's Cave\n\n}}\n'Queen Mab's Cave' is an 1846 landscape painting by the British artist J.M.W. Turner. It depicts a view which references the character of Queen Mab by William Shakespeare and likely also inspired by the 1813 poem Queen Mab by Percy Bysshe Shelley, although it does not actually illustrate scenes from either author.\nIt was exhibited at the British Institution's annual exhibition of 1846. The painting was part of the Turner Bequest of 1856 and is now in the collection of the Tate Britain in Pimlico. A smaller replica is now in the Cleveland Museum of Art.\nSee also\n* List of paintings by J. M. W. Turner\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Brown, Nicola.
