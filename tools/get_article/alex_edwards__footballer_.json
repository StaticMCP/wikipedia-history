He then featured as a 16-year-old in Dunfermline's famous 6–2 home victory against Valencia in 1962. He went on to play for Dunfermline in the Scottish Cup finals of 1965 and 1968, winning the latter.\nHibernian manager Eddie Turnbull signed Edwards for £13,000 in 1971. He combined well on the right side of the Hibs side with John Brownlie. He played in another Scottish Cup Final in 1972, before winning the Scottish League Cup in the following season. Hibs challenged for the league title that season as well, but fell away after Edwards was banned for eight weeks having been booked four times.\nEdwards moved on to Arbroath in 1978, before retiring from professional football in 1980.\nIn October 2024, he was inducted into the Hibernian Hall of Fame. Edwards died aged 78 on 11 December 2024.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
