There are 2,173 Sikhs living in Ireland per the 2022 census of Ireland.\nHistory\n19th century\nBorn in Limerick in 1841, Max Arthur Macauliffe was an Irish-Sikh convert and a scholar who devoted significant efforts in the late 1800s to translating Sikh scriptures and history into English, helping with the introduction of Sikhism to Europe and North America.\n20th century\nSikh migration to Ireland largely began in the 1950s and 1960s, with Sikhs arriving primarily for work in sectors like manufacturing, transport, and agriculture. During this period, the community expanded into urban areas such as Dublin and Cork. Due to immigration policies in the 1990s and the Celtic Tiger period, Ireland attracted more Sikhs primarily from Punjab into professional jobs within the IT and healthcare sector.\n21st century\nSikh immigration in the early 2000s increased as a result of the coming of international students, some of whom stayed and had children in Ireland.\nIn 2019, over 2,000 people took part in the Nagar kirtan for Vaisakhi in the Sandymount area of Dublin. In 2021, Ravinder Singh Oberoi became the first practicing Sikh of the Garda Síochána Reserves.\nGurdwara\n* Guru Nanak Darbar Gurdwara (Ballsbridge, Dublin) - Established in 1987, it is the country's only Gurdwara.\nIrish Sikh organisations\n* Irish Sikh Council (founded 2004)\n* EcoSikh Ireland\nList of notable Irish Sikhs\n* Max Arthur Macauliffe, Sikh scholar\n* Simi Singh, Irish cricketer\nSee also\n* Sikhism in the United Kingdom\n* Religion in the Republic of Ireland\n* Sikhism in England\n* Sikhism in Wales\n* Sikhism in Scotland\nReferences"
