David's introduction of Glenfiddich Solera Reserve 15 Year Old, was also the first and only single malt to use the innovative Solera maturation process.\nAs master blender at William Grant & Sons, he developed the world's first blends to be finished in Ale and Sherry Casks, with the introduction of Grant's Ale Cask Reserve and Sherry Cask Reserve.  His passion for the art of blending also helped Grant's Family Reserve, the world's third best-selling Scotch whisky, receive consistent international acclaim as one of the world's best blends.\nDavid officially handed over the role of Glenfiddich Malt Master and Grant's Master Blender to Brian Kinsman in 2009, after almost a decade working closely together. He firmly remains part of the William Grant & Sons family, however, dedicating his time to his Malt Master role at the company's renowned Balvenie Distillery in Dufftown. David's pioneering spirit and dedication to his craft, coupled with his modest, unassuming manner has made him one of the best-loved and respected craftsmen in the business.\nPersonal life\nStewart lives outside Glasgow with his wife Ellen and has three children Heather, Colin and Alan and two grandchildren, Rory, three and Lily, one.  An avid Ayr United football fan, David also finds the time to indulge in curling and a round of golf in his spare time. Apart from Scotch, Stewart enjoys Guinness and  white wine, particularly from France or South Africa.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.williamgrant.com William Grant & Sons]\n*  [http://www.islay.ru/persons/david-stewart/ Биография Дэвида стюарта на Islay.ru]"
