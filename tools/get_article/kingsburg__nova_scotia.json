The community is located approximately 130 kilometres from Halifax.\nKingsburg is also a protected cape.\nHistory\nKing George III issued a land grant of approximately 1350 acres to foreign Protestant settlers, Leonard Hirtle, John Mossman, Peter Knack, Christian Hartman, John Kayser and Jacob Moser on July 5, 1787.\nFor decades, Kingsburg was a fishing and farming community. By the middle of the twentieth century, with the widespread decline of small-scale Atlantic fishery, most fishing culture had disappeared.\nEconomy\nThe evolution of Kingsburg into a vacation and retirement destination has had an impact on the population of the village. About 80% of the houses are vacant during most of the year.\nMuch of the rural infrastructure for Upper and Lower Kingsburg is centered in Riverport, Nova Scotia. This includes Riverport Electric, the first municipal utility incorporated in Nova Scotia, the Riverport & District Fire Department, Riverport & District Community Center, Riverport Community School and Riverport Post Office.\nGeography\nThe Kingsburg Peninsula extends from Rose Bay, around the headlands of Rose Head, Hell Point and Gaff Point to the LaHave River estuary. The Greater Kingsburg Peninsula includes the defined area plus West Ironbound Island. Neighbouring areas to the Kingsburg Peninsula include Upper Kingsburg and Lower Rose Bay.\nGallery\nFile:Classic Kingsburg.JPG|Kingsburg\nFile:Something Old, Something New.JPG|Shobac Cottages, and a troop barn\nFile:Moshers Look Over.JPG|Pioneer cemetery overlooking Hirtle's Beach\nFile:Kingsburg Beach.JPG|Kingsburg Beach\nFile:Kingsburg Looking Toward The Hell.JPG|Kingsburg\nSee also\n* Royal eponyms in Canada\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.kingsburg.info/ Kingsburg Nova Scotia Community Association]\n* [https://www.kccns.org/ Kingsburg Coastal Conservancy]"
