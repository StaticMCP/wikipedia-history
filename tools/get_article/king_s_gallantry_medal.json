In addition, the QGM replaced the Colonial Police Medal for Gallantry (the last award of which was made in November 1974). It de facto replaced awards of the Sea Gallantry Medal, but this has never been formally announced.\nThe Royal Warrant for the Queen's Gallantry Medal was amended on 30 November 1977 to allow for posthumous awards, as was that for the George Medal.\nDuring the reign of Queen Elizabeth II between June 1974 and the final list published in March 2023 after her death, there were 1,101 awards announced in The London Gazette, including 19 second award bars. The armed forces received 542 awards and civilians, including police, 559 (including 120 to the Royal Ulster Constabulary, almost twice as many as any other group). Forty-two of the awards were posthumous, and 27 were to women.\nSince the accession of King Charles III, the Queen's Gallantry Medal has been renamed the King's Gallantry Medal. The first six awards of the King's Gallantry Medal were announced on 14 May 2024. The first awards of the King's Gallantry Medal to members of the Armed Forces were announced on 14 June 2025.\nCriteria\nThe medal is awarded for \"exemplary acts of bravery\" by civilians, and by members of the Armed Forces for \"actions for which purely military Honours are not normally granted\".  The award is not restricted to British subjects.\nDescription\nThe medal is silver and circular in shape, 36&nbsp;mm in diameter, with the following design:\n* The obverse of the QGM shows the crowned portrait of Queen Elizabeth II by Cecil Thomas and is inscribed \"ELIZABETH II DEI GRATIA REGINA F.D.\".\n* The obverse of the KGM shows a crowned portrait of King Charles III and is inscribed \"CHARLES III DEI GRATIA REX FID DEF\".\n* The reverse of the QGM (designed by Reynolds Stone CBE, RDI) bears the image of a St Edward's Crown above the words 'THE QUEEN'S GALLANTRY MEDAL' in four lines, flanked by laurel sprigs.\n* The reverse of the KGM retains the general components of the original design but now shows the Tudor crown and is inscribed ‘THE KING’S GALLANTRY MEDAL’, in a subtly different, serif font.\n* The 32&nbsp;mm wide ribbon is of \"Garter\" blue, with a central stripe of pearl grey, within which is a narrow stripe of rose pink; the grey and rose colours represent the Order of the British Empire, which the medal replaced. While awards to women generally have the ribbon fashioned into a bow, female recipients in the armed forces or civilian uniformed services have the medal presented with the ribbon in the same style as for male recipients.\n* The name of the recipient is impressed on the rim of the medal. When awarded to members of the Armed Forces, service number, rank, and unit are also included.\n* A further award of the medal is indicated by a silver bar ornamented with laurel leaves worn on the ribbon. When the ribbon alone is worn, a silver rosette denotes a further award.\nRecipients are entitled to the post-nominal letters \"Q.G.M\" or \"K.G.M.\".\nNotable recipients\nAmong the more notable recipients are:\n* Charles Bruce, former 22 Special Air Service Soldier. Awarded in November 1986 for his conduct in Operation Banner, Northern Ireland in December 1984.\n* Peter Edmonds, Metropolitan Police Officer.

David Lacon (now Hewett-Lacon) and Ian Rogers also received the QGM for this rescue. Three police officers whom Rogers asked for urgent assistance, because flames were threatening to engulf both him and a semi conscious Lacon, either turned away, or said it was 'too dangerous', and then turned away. This incident is remarked upon in Nick Metcalfe's book.
