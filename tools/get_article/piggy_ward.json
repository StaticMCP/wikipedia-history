He played for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Baltimore Orioles, Cincinnati Reds, Washington Senators, and Philadelphia Phillies.\nBiography\nWard shares with Earl D. Averill the MLB record of the most consecutive plate appearances resulting in officially getting on base (through either a walk, a base hit or being hit by a pitch) in major league history. From June 16 to June 19 in 1893, Ward officially reached base a record 17 times in 17 consecutive plate appearances, getting 8 hits, drawing 8 walks and being hit by a pitch once.\nReferences\nExternal links"
