During her time with the team, which she captained on a number of occasions, they won the World Rugby Women's Sevens Series in 2012–13, 2013–14, 2014–15, 2016–17, 2018–19, 2019–20, and 2022–23. With them she won a silver medal at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro and back-to-back gold medals at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.\nIn May 2023, she was released from her contract with New Zealand Rugby to play rugby league for the Australian club St. George Illawarra Dragons in the NRL Women's Premiership. This led to her being selected in October 2023 for the New Zealand women's national rugby league team for whom she has played three matches to date. She returned to the New Zealand women sevens rugby team in early 2024 before retiring from international sevens rugby after the Paris Olympics. She is currently the highest women points scorer in the history of the women sevens series.\nAs well as touch, sevens rugby, fifteen-a-side and rugby league, King has represented New Zealand in tag rugby.\nEarly life\nNathan-Wong was born in Auckland on 1 July 1994 to Deanne and Russell Nathan-Wong. Her grandfather, David Wong was born in New Zealand to immigrants from Guangzhou. He became close friends with Roger Bailey, who would later go on to play 30 times for the New Zealand national rugby league team between 1961 and 1970. As a result of their friendship Wong began playing rugby league as a youth for Ponsonby at a time when it was unusual for a person of Asian descendent to play contact sports. He progressed to the senior grades during which time his team in 1967 won the region's premier competition, the Fox Memorial Shield. That same year Wong became the full-blooded Chinese to play for the Auckland team. All four of Wong's daughters initially tried playing rugby league but found that their small statue made it tough to handle the physical contact so they switched to playing touch rugby. Korina and Michele becoming provincial touch representatives, while Sheree and Deanne, represented New Zealand.\nNathan-Wong’s father, Russell (who is of part-European part-Maori descent) played rugby league in his youth.\nShe grew up in the Auckland suburb of Blockhouse Bay and attended Blockhouse Bay Primary School.\nAt primary school the first sport that Nathan-Wong played was mixed gender under-nines rugby league, and she was the only girl playing. She was eventually forced to give up rugby league as mixed gender teams ended at the age of 10 and at the time there was not pathway to continue playing in a female only competition.  Following primary school she attended Blockhouse Bay Intermediate.\nHer secondary education was received at Lynfield College. At Lynfield she competed in athletics, basketball, football and taekwondo (in which she obtained a red belt). Because of her short statue she wasn’t selected for the school’s intermediate basketball team. In football Nathan-Wong played In 2004 in the Metro Boys 10th Grade team; in 2004 and 2005 in the Auckland Weir Rose Bowl Football Under-12 Girls team; in 2005 in Three Kings United 13th Grade Girls Division team, in 2006 in the Three Kings United 15th Grade Girls Division 1 team; in 2008 in the West Auckland Women’s Premier Reserves team, in 2009 in both the United Soccer Under-15 Girls and the Waitakere Women’s Premier teams.\nIn 2011, she won the college’s senior girls' cross-country title, as well as awarded the Dux Ludorum honour by the college.\nRugby career\nTouch rugby\nShe first came to notice when in 2004 when she played for the Auckland Under-11 Mixed touch rugby team.

However her obvious talent after an outstanding performance for the Auckland Sevens team at the National Sevens Tournament lead to her being selected at the age of 17 and then making her debut for the Sevens team as an 18-year-old in August 2012 at the Oceania Sevens tournament in Churchill Park, Lautoka in Fiji. At the time she was the youngest woman to have ever been selected for the team.\nPrior to joining the sevens team she had no experience with taking drop kicks. This ended when she the coaches took her aside at practice and informed her that she was the halfback, with responsibly for taking conversion and restart drop kicks.

She never made the side.\nHer first fifteen-a-side appearance at provincial level was in 2016 when she played five games at halfback and scored 15 points for Auckland.\nIn 2020 and 2021 she played a total of seven games at halfback on loan for Northland in the Farah Palmer Cup during which she scored 25 points. Her performance for Northland in 2021 was so compelling that the she was named at halfback in the 2022 Rugby Almanack's \"New Zealand XV\".\nShe joined the Blues for the inaugural Super Rugby Aupiki competition.\nNathan-Wong got her first Black Ferns XV's call up after she was selected for the Laurie O'Reilly Cup Test series against Australia.\nShe made her test debut for New Zealand as halfback when she came off the bench in the second half of their game at Orangetheory Stadium in Christchurch against Australia on 20 August 2022 when they won.\nHer debut was marred by a head knock which led to a lingering concussion which subsequently ruled her out of the Black Ferns XV’s World Cup squad.\nRugby league\nAt her request she was released from her contract with New Zealand Rugby in May 2023.\nThis release allowed her to sign a one-year contract on 24 May 2023 with NRLW rugby league team the St George Illawarra Dragons with a view to later returning to sevens to play in the 2024 Paris Olympics.\nNathan-Wong made her Rugby League and club debut at five-eighth on 22 July 2023 for the Dragons against the reigning NRLW champions Newcastle Knights, during which she scored a try.
