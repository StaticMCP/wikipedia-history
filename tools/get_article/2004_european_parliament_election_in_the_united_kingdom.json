The United Kingdom's part of this election was held on Thursday 10 June 2004. The election also coincided with the 2004 local elections and the London Assembly and mayoral elections. In total, 78 Members of the European Parliament were elected from the United Kingdom using proportional representation.\nThe Conservative Party and the Labour Party both polled poorly. The Conservatives experienced their second-lowest ever recorded vote share in a national election (even less than their 1832 nadir, although the party would do worse still in the 2014 and 2019 elections), and Labour their lowest since 1918. The UK Independence Party (UKIP) saw a large increase in support, increasing its number of MEPs from 3 to 12 and on popular vote pushed the Liberal Democrats, who themselves had increased their representation from 10 to 12 seats into fourth place. In Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin beat the SDLP in the polls and took its first Northern Ireland seat.\nBackground\nElectoral system\nThe United Kingdom elected 78 Members of the European Parliament using proportional representation. The United Kingdom was divided into twelve multi-member constituencies. The eleven of these regions which form Great Britain used a closed-list party list system method of proportional representation, calculated using the D'Hondt method. Northern Ireland used the Single Transferable Vote (STV). As a consequence of the 2004 enlargement of the European Union, the number of seats allocated to the United Kingdom was fewer than in 1999.\nIt was the first European election to be held in the United Kingdom using postal-only voting in four areas: the North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber, and East Midlands\nregions.\nRegional seat allocations\nA combination of the effects of the Treaty of Nice and the 2004 enlargement of the European Union meant that the number of seats allocated to the United Kingdom for the 2004 election was reduced from the 87 MEPs allocated for the 1999 election to 78 MEPs.\nAs a result of the successful challenge of Matthews v United Kingdom before the European Court of Human Rights in 1999 residents of Gibraltar, voted in the European Parliament election for the first time, as part of the South West England region.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|+Changes in regional seat allocations\n!Constituency!!Representation in 1999!!Representation in 2004!!class=\"unsortable\"|Net Gain/Loss\n|-\n|East Midlands\n|6\n|6\n|\n|-\n|East of England\n|8\n|7\n| 1\n|-\n|London\n|10\n|9\n| 1\n|-\n|North East England\n|4\n|3\n| 1\n|-\n|North West England\n|10\n|9\n| 1\n|-\n|Northern Ireland\n|3\n|3\n|\n|-\n|Scotland\n|8\n|7\n| 1\n|-\n|South East England\n|11\n|10\n| 1\n|-\n|South West England1\n|7\n|7\n|\n|-\n|Wales\n|5\n|4\n| 1\n|-\n|West Midlands\n|8\n|7\n| 1\n|-\n|Yorkshire and the Humber\n|7\n|6\n| 1\n|-\n!Overall\n!87\n!78\n! 9\n|}\n1 Includes Gibraltar, the only British overseas territory which was part of the EU.\nResults\nTurnout for all the regions was 38.2% on an electorate of 44,157,267 (43,084,598 in Great Britain and 1,072,669 in Northern Ireland). The Conservatives and Labour both polled poorly. The Conservatives, although getting a vote share 4.1% greater than Labour, experienced their lowest vote share in a national election since 1832. Labour's vote share was its lowest since 1918. Labour's decline in votes was regarded as being largely due to widespread public dissatisfaction about the Iraq War and (as with the Conservatives) the increased popularity of UK Independence Party (UKIP). UKIP saw a large increase in support, increasing its number of MEPs from 3 to 12, drawing level with the Liberal Democrats, who themselves had increased their representation from 10 to 12 seats. UKIP polled higher than the Liberal Democrats to push the latter into fourth place.\nTurnout was lowest in Scotland, which did not hold local elections on the same day. In Scotland, Labour topped the poll, followed by the Scottish National Party (SNP). The Conservatives' share of the vote declined by 2 per cent, making it the region with the smallest swing against them.\nWales was the only region were Labour increased its share of the vote compared to 1999. The Conservatives managed to make gains pushing Plaid Cymru into third and whose share of the vote fell by 12 percentage points relative to 1999. Similarly UKIP narrowly beat the Liberal Democrats into fourth place. Wales was the region where the Green Party polled their lowest share of the vote.\nUnited Kingdom\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" | Party !!

Gibraltar is a British overseas territory (BOT) and therefore is under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United Kingdom but does not form part of it. Gibraltar was however part of the EU, the only BOT to be so included. Following however, the result of the successful challenge of Matthews v United Kingdom before the European Court of Human Rights in 1999 residents of Gibraltar were given the right to vote in the European Parliament elections. The British government decided not to give Gibraltar its own seat due to its small electorate of just over 20,000 which would have meant with just one seat Gibraltar would have been over-represented by about 30 times the average.\nNone of the main Gibraltar political parties contested the election, so voters chose from United Kingdom party lists. However, Lyana Armstrong-Emery of Gibraltar's Reform Party had a place on a joint list with the Green Party. In addition both the leader of the Conservative Party, Michael Howard, and his deputy, Michael Ancram, campaigned in Gibraltar.\nTurnout in Gibraltar was 57.5%, higher than the 37.6% for the South West England electoral region as a whole. The Conservative Party polled over two-thirds of the Gibraltar vote, with no other party exceeding 10% support.\nNorthern Ireland\nTurnout in Northern Ireland was 51.2%. Sinn Féin beat the SDLP in the polls and took its first Northern Ireland seat. Sinn Féin also won a seat in the corresponding elections in the Republic of Ireland. Sinn Féin and the DUP increased their shares of the vote relative to the 1999 European Parliament elections, while the shares for both the SDLP and the UUP fell. This was also the final election in which a Unionist candidate topped the poll in Northern Ireland. Jim Allister of the DUP and Bairbre de Brún of Sinn Féin were elected in the first round while Jim Nicholson of the UUP was elected in the third stage, after the votes of the other candidates were reallocated.\nSummary of the election results for Northern Ireland\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Party\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Candidate(s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Seats\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Loss/Gain\n! colspan=\"2\" | First Preference Votes\n|-\n!

However, the next day, on Breakfast with Frost, he criticised Knapman's leadership. After further disagreement with the leadership, Kilroy-Silk resigned the UKIP whip in the European Parliament on 27 October 2004. Initially, he remained a member, while seeking a bid for the party leadership. However, this was not successful and he resigned completely from UKIP on 20 January 2005, calling it a \"joke\". Two weeks later, he founded his own party, Veritas, taking a number of UKIP members, including both of the London Assembly members, with him.\nUKIP formed a new European Parliament Group, Independence/Democracy which was co-chaired by Nigel Farage and Hanne Dahl.\nSee also\n*2005 United Kingdom general election\n*List of political parties in the United Kingdom\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050220174520/http://www.eurela.org/ European Election News by European Election Law Association (Eurela)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20041012204306/http://www.europarl.org.uk/guide/Gelectionsmain.html Guide and results at the UK Office of the European Parliament]\n* [http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/loc04/europe04.htm Guide and links Richard Kimber's at Political Science Resources]\nManifestos and documents\n* [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/elections2004/page/0,14549,1214350,00.html Guardian (newspaper): incomplete collection of manifestos]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20041013010418/http://www.conservatives.com/getfile.cfm?file=EuroManifesto2004&ref=GENUPLOAD%2F2523&type=pdf Conservative manifesto]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040706041102/http://www.eurogreens.org/cms/default/dok/7/7635.a_common_manifesto_for_a_common_european.htm European Greens manifesto]; [https://web.archive.org/web/20041222162259/http://greens-efa.org/pdf/documents/GreenAchievements_EN.pdf Successes of the Greens in the European Parliament]; [https://web.archive.org/web/20041222154627/http://greens-efa.org/pdf/documents/GreenContract_EN.pdf A Green Contract for Europe]; [http://www.greenparty.org.uk/files/manifesto/EuroManifesto2004.pdf European Election Manifesto: Green Party of England and Wales] [https://web.archive.org/web/20041014033925/http://www.greens-in.org/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=32 Manifesto: Northern Ireland]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040611210829/http://www.labour.org.uk/britainisworking/uploads/media/Europeanelectiondocument.pdf Labour document]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040808172900/http://www.libdems.org.uk/documents/policies/Manifestos/2004EuroManifesto-small.pdf Liberal Democrat manifesto]\n* [http://www.dup.org.uk/pdf/DUPManifesto.pdf Democratic Unionist Party manifesto]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20041010172022/http://www.sdlp.ie/preuropemanifesto2004.shtm Social Democratic and Labour Party manifesto]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20041221123219/http://seaderry.co.uk/pdfs/SEA.pdf Socialist Environmental Alliance manifesto]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040804160623/http://www.uup.org/archive/Media%20centre/documents/pdfs/uup_manifesto.pdf Ulster Unionist Party manifesto] [https://web.archive.org/web/20050118100755/http://www.uup.org/archive/Media%20centre/documents/pdfs/uup_euro_manifesto.pdf European manifesto] (ED)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050119202328/http://voteforscotland.snp.org/pdf/SNP%20European%20Manifesto.pdf Scottish National Party manifesto]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20041220202902/http://www.plaidcymru.org/europeanmanifesto.pdf Plaid Cymru / The Party of Wales Manifesto]"
