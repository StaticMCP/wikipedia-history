Peña, Nathaniel A. Peña, Alfonso Freeman, and Lia Marie Johnson. The comedy tells the story of the rivalry between class nerd Alfonso, played by Michael M. Peña, and Marty Baboor, a newly arrived \"super-nerd\" student from India played by Nathaniel A. Peña.\nThis short film, which was shot in High Definition Video, was produced under a SAG New Media Contract with a budget of less than 10,000 dollars. It has an anti-bullying theme.\nPlot\nAlfonso is the resident sixth-grade nerd who is quite happy with his status as an intellectual genius. His day is ruined, however, when a new kid arrives to class…Marty, the super-nerd from India. Marty takes no prisoners, and Alfonso quickly finds himself outmatched by the new kid. The rivalry continues in gym class with a brutal game of dodge ball and finally ends up in an epic after-school battle. Romantic interest is provided by the militant Russian nerd Ivanka, played by Danika Yarosh, and Doris, played by Lia Marie Johnson, who firmly believes she is a witch with magic powers.\nCast\n* Michael Manuel Peña as Alfonso\n* Nathaniel A.
