The community then later named themselves Thiruvananthapuram LUG (Indian Linux Users Group), GNU/Linux Users Group, Thiruvananthapuram and then ultimately Free Software Users Group, Thiruvananthapuram. The community has worked with the government in helping with key Free software initiatives in the government and also in promoting and supporting Free software among the general public. The community has also been instrumental in creating an IT policy favorable to Free software in the state of Kerala.\nMain Activities\nFree software install fests\nOne of the organized activities of the community was to organize GNU/Linux install fests in and around the city. These were usually organized in educational institutions or public places where the general public could bring their computers to get a GNU/Linux distribution installed on them. As GNU/Linux distributions became more and more easy to be installed and configured the community has stopped organizing these.\nDeveloper camps\nThe group has also worked with SMC in organizing developer camps in Thiruvananthapuram and outside. During developer camps developers are given hands-on experience in working with Free software tools and primarily around localization initiatives which SMC is involved with.\nSoftware / Hardware Freedom Day\nThe Free software community in Thiruvananthapuram has also been involved in organizing Software Freedom Day celebrations and Hardware Freedom Day celebrations in the city.\nFree software release parties\nThe community  has also organized release parties to celebrate the release of the different Free software like Ubuntu, Firefox etc.\nKey Initiatives\nFree software install fest at Technopark\nOne of the first large-scale events organized by the community was a week long Free Software Install Fest at Technopark, Thiruvananthapuram organized in 2008.
