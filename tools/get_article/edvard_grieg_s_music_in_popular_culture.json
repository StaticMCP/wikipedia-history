The programs were repeated in Germany in 1996, where over a thousand students participated in Grieg in der Schule. Grieg observances spanned 39 countries, from Mexico to Russia.\nFurther celebrations of Grieg and his music were held in 2007, the 100th anniversary of his death. Bosnia and Herzegovina held a large-scale celebration, featuring Peer Gynt and the Piano Concerto in a public concert for children and adults.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927224346/http://eng.grieg07.no/?page=66&news=531&PHPSESSID=55d478232ca7ee96ec8a684247b5af09 Grieg07 – English – Home] The July 2007 Australasian Piano Pedagogy Conference featured Grieg's works.\nBergen University College, and later, the University of Bergen both named their tertiary music departments  (the Grieg Academy), in the composer's honor.\nPeer Gynt\nIn 1960 Duke Ellington recorded a jazz interpretation of Peer Gynt in his Swinging Suites by Edward E. and Edward G. album. This led to conflict  in Norway between the Grieg Foundation and its supporters, who found the recordings offensive to Norwegian culture, and Norwegian supporters of Ellington. Ellington's versions were withdrawn from distribution in the country until 1967, when Grieg's copyrights expired.\n\"In the Hall of the Mountain King\"\n\"Morning\"\nJay and the Americans recorded a rock and roll cover song known as \"Dawning\", in 1962. \"Morning\" was later used in the 1973 film Soylent Green as part of the music selected by Edward G. Robinson's character to listen to as he lay dying.\nIn 1998, The Simpsons episode \"Bart Carny\" paid homage to its use in older cartoons in a sequence where a cheeseburger unwraps in the early sunlight. Later in the same year, German musical project In-Mood feat. Juliette sampled the theme for their song \"Ocean of Light.\"\nThe \"Morning Mood\" theme in the first movement of Grieg's Peer Gynt Suite no 1, Op 46 is used as the opening theme music in PopCap Games' 2007 video game Peggle, accompanying the animation of a rising sun.\nThe song plays in an episode of Pop Team Epic, when Popuko wakes up. However, upon seeing it is still nighttime, she beats up the song caption.\nThe song plays during the reveal trailer for the character Kled for the videogame League of Legends, called \"Kled: The Reunion\".\nThe beginning portion was also used in a Cartoon Network sign-on from 2013 to 2015, where the titular character from one of CN's shows, Uncle Grandpa, appears with his head rising against a mountain range background, saying his trademark catchphrase, \"Good morning!\". In the sign-off, the character would say the catchphrase, and lower back down with the music playing (albeit reversed) and then him saying the catchphrase again.\nZelda Nomura, female antagonist of the animated series Trollhunters: Tales of Arcadia, whistles \"Morning Mood\" and \"In the Hall of the Mountain King\" to instill fear in her enemies.\nThe song plays as background music in the video game Grow a Garden.\n\"Solveig's Song\"\n\"Solveig's Song\" is used as the melodic basis for a track in Vandal Hearts 2, 1999.\nPower metal/Progressive metal band Kamelot based a song called \"Forever\" on the melody of \"Solveig's Song\". This is also mentioned by their now previous singer Roy Khan, on their live DVD One Cold Winters Night.\nPiano Sonata\nThe motion picture The First Legion uses Grieg's Piano Sonata in E minor as a way to introduce a Jesuit priest's prayer. The priest, Father Fulton, plays the sonata as a way of connecting himself to the other Jesuits, when \"forced to revise their standards of belief after experiencing first a makeshift and later a 'real' miracle.\"\n\"Brothers, Sing On!\"\nThe folk song \"Brothers, Sing On!\" (\"Sangerhilsen\" in the original Norwegian) was written by Grieg, with lyrics by Sigvald Skavlan and with English language lyrics by Herbert Dalmas and/or Howard McKinney. The Mohawk-Hudson Male Chorus Association (MHMCA) presented \"Brothers, Sing On!\": a massed concert with 90 male singers at the historic Troy Savings Bank Music Hall on May 3, 2008, with the titular song adopted as the organization's theme song in 1974. They had previously performed the same song in the same venue in 2002.\nThe University of Northern Iowa has gone so far as to name its web site and to start every concert with this song:\nOther pieces\nThe 1944 musical Song of Norway, based very loosely on Grieg's life and using his music, was created in 1944 by Robert Wright and George Forrest; and a film version was released in 1970.\nThe 1957 made-for-TV movie musical The Pied Piper of Hamelin uses Grieg's music almost exclusively, with \"In the Hall of the Mountain King\" being the melody that the Piper (Van Johnson) plays to rid the town of rats.\nThe opening theme of the first movement of Grieg's Piano Concerto in A Minor was used by Jimmy Wisner, recording under the name \"Kokomo\", in the song \"Asia Minor\", a top-ten pop hit in the U.S. in 1961.\nEric Morecambe famously played \"all the right notes, but not necessarily in the right order\" of Grieg's Piano Concerto in a sketch on the 1971 Morecambe and Wise Christmas special that featured Andre Previn.\nSee also\n* List of compositions by Edvard Grieg\n* Neo-Medieval\n* Grieg Academy\nReferences"
