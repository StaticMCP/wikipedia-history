Nash was a war artist in both World War I and World War II]]\nA war artist is an artist either commissioned by a government or publication, or self-motivated, to document first-hand experience of war in any form of illustrative or depictive record. War artists explore the visual and sensory dimensions of war, often absent in written histories or other accounts of warfare.\nin 1941]]\nThese artists may be involved in war as onlookers to the scenes, military personnel, or as specifically commissioned to be present and record military activity.\nArtists record military activities in ways that cameras and the written word cannot. Their art collects and distills the experiences of the people who endured it. The artists and their artwork affect how subsequent generations view military conflicts. For example, Australian war artists who grew up between the two world wars were influenced by the artwork which depicted the First World War, and there was a precedent and format for them to follow.\nOfficial war artists have been appointed by governments for information or propaganda purposes and to record events on the battlefield, but there are many other types of war artists. These can include combatants who are artists and choose to record their experiences, non-combatants who are witnesses of war, and prisoners of war who may voluntarily record the conditions or be appointed war artists by senior officers.\nIn New Zealand, the title of appointed \"war artist\" is \"army artist\". In the United States, the term \"combat artist\" has come to be used to mean the same thing.\nSome examples and their background\n* William Simpson was an artist-correspondent who sent artwork to London from the front during the Crimean War.\n* Alfred Waud was an American Civil War pictorial newspaper illustrator.\n* Ogata Gekkō and Tsuguharu Foujita created woodblock prints for Japanese publications.\n* Ronald Searle recorded life in Japanese POW camps.\n* Emmanuel Leutze's 1851 studio painting of Washington Crossing the Delaware is historically incorrect, and Leutze was born decades after the event his painting depicts, but this work has become an icon of popular culture.\nWar artists by nationality\nArgentine\n*Cándido López (1840–1902), Paraguayan War\nAustralian\n24 March 1901'' by Charles Hammond]]\nWar artists have depicted all the conflicts in which Australians have been called to combat. The Australian tradition of \"official war artists\" started with the First World War. Artists were granted permission to accompany the Australian Imperial Force to record the activities of its soldiers. During the Second World War, the Australian War Museum, later called the Australian War Memorial, engaged artists. At the same time, the Royal Australian Navy, Australian Army, and Royal Australian Air Force appointed official war artist-soldiers from within their ranks. These embedded war artists have depicted the activities of Australian forces in Korea, Vietnam, East Timor, Afghanistan, and Iraq.\nThe ranks of non-soldier artists like George Gittoes continue to create artwork which becomes a commentary on Australia's military actions in war.\nSelected artists\nA select list of representative Australian artists includes:\n{| style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n|  style=\"width:33%; vertical-align:top;\"|\nSecond Boer War\n* William Dargie CBE, 1912–2003\nFirst World War\n* George Bell, 1878–1966\n* Charles Bryant, 1883–1937\n* Will Dyson, 1880–1938\n* A.

Artwork like the 1688 painting,The Fleet at Sea by Willem van de Velde the Younger depict the Royal Navy in readiness for battle. The Ministry of Defence  art collection includes many paintings showing battle scenes, particularly naval battles. Military art and portraiture has evolved along with other aspects of war. The British official war artists of the First World War created a unique account of that conflict. The British War Artists Scheme expanded the number of official artists and enlarged the scope of their activities during the Second War.\nSignificant themes in the chronicle of twentieth-century wars have been developed by non-military, non-official, civilian artists. For example, society portraitist Arabella Dorman's paintings of wounded Iraq War veterans inspired her to spend two weeks with three regiments in different frontline areas: the Green Jackets at Basra Palace, the Queen's Own Gurkhas at Shaibah Logistics Base ten miles south-west of Basra, and the Queen's Royal Lancers in the Maysaan desert. In the field, Dorman drew quick charcoal portraits of the men she met. Returning to England, the sketches she made helped her use art to \"evoke the emotions and psychological impact of war,\" rather than depicting the \"physical horror\" of war.\nSelected artists\nA select list of representative British artists includes:\n{| style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n|  style=\"width:33%; vertical-align:top;\"|\nNapoleonic Wars\n* Denis Dighton, 1792–1827\n* Robert Ker Porter, 1777–1842\n* John Christian Schetky, 1778–1874\nCrimean War\n* Jerry Barrett, 1824–1906\n* Oswald Brierly, 1817–1894\n* William Simpson 1823–1899\nBoer Wars\n* John Henry Frederick Bacon, 1868–1914\n* René Bull, 1872–1942\n* Charles Edwin Fripp, 1854–1906\n* Godfrey Douglas Giles, 1857–1941\n* Ernest Prater, 1864–1950\n* Melton Prior, 1845–1910\n* Frederic Villiers, 1851–1922\n* William Barnes Wollen, 1857–1936\nFirst World War\n*Anna Airy, 1882–1964.\n*Muirhead Bone, 1888–1953.\n*Sydney Carline, 1888–1929.\n*Colin Gill, 1892–1940.\n*Eric Kennington RA, 1888–1960.\n*John Hodgson Lobley RA, 1878–1954.\n*Olive Mudie-Cooke, 1890–1925.\n*John Nash CBE RA, 1893–1977.\n*Paul Nash, 1889–1946.\n*C.R.W.

Y. Jackson]]\nRepresentative works by Canada's artists whose work illustrates and records war are gathered into the extensive collection of the Canadian War Museum. The earliest war art in Canada was rock art created by Indigenous peoples from all regions of the country. During the colonial period, large-scale, European-style paintings of war dominated New France and British North America. The First and Second World Wars saw a dramatic increase in the production of war art in every medium. A few First World War paintings were exhibited in the Senate of Canada Chamber, and artists studied these works as a way of preparing to create new artworks in the conflict in Europe which expanded after 1939.\nIn the Second World War, Canada expanded its official art program; Canadian war artists were a kind of journalist who lived the lives of soldiers. The work of non-official civilian artists also became part of the record of this period. Canada supported Canadian official war artists in both the First World War and the Second World War; no official artists were designated during the Korean War.\nAmong Canada's embedded artist-journalist teams was Richard Johnson, who was sent by the National Post to Afghanistan in 2007 and 2011; his drawings of Canadian troops were published and posted online as part of the series \"Kandahar Journal\".\nProminent themes explored by Canadian war artists include commemoration, identity, women, Indigenous representation, propaganda, protest, violence, and religion.\nSelected artists\nA select list of representative Canadian artists includes:\nFirst World War\n* John William Beatty, 1869–1941\n* Alexander Young Jackson CC CMG, 1882–1974\n* Arthur Lismer CC, 1885–1969 , Official army war artist, with some of his paintings, 9 February 1944]]\n* Frederick Varley, 1881–1969\n* Mabel May, 1877-1971\n*Marion Long, 1882–1970\nSecond World War\n* Eric Aldwinckle, 1909-1980\n* Donald Kenneth Anderson, 1920–2009\n* Harold Beament, 1898–1985\n* Alan Brockman Beddoe OC OBE HFHS FHSC, 1893–1975\n* Molly Lamb Bobak CM ONB, 1922–2014&nbsp; &nbsp;\n* Paraskeva Clark\n* David Alexander Colville PC CC ONS, 1920–2013\n* Charles Fraser Comfort OC, 1900–1994\n* Charles Goldhamer, 1903–1985\n* Paul Goranson, 1911–2002\n* Lawren P.

In 1916 the Ministry of Beaux-Arts and the Ministry of War sponsored the Salon des Armées to show the work of the artists who had been mobilized. This one exhibition realized 60,000 francs.

The war artist or combat artist captures instantaneous action and conflates earlier moments of the same scene within one compelling image. Artists are unlike the objective camera lens, which records only a single instant and no more.\nIn 1917 the American military designated American official war artists who were sent to Europe to record the activities of the American Expeditionary Forces.\nIn World War II, the Navy Combat Art Program ensured that active-duty artists developed a record of all phases of the war and all major naval operations.\nThe official war artist continued to be supported in some military engagements. Teams of soldier-artists during the Vietnam War created pictorial accounts and interpretations for the annals of army military history. In 1992 the Army Staff Artist Program was attached to the United States Army Center of Military History as a permanent part of the Museum Division's Collections Branch.\nThe majority of combat artists of the 1970s were selected by George Gray, chairman of NACAL, Navy Air Cooperation and Liaison committee. Some of their paintings will be selected for the Navy Combat Art Museum in the capital by Charles Lawrence, director.  In January 1978 the U.S. Navy chose a seascape specialist team: they asked Patricia Yaps and Wayne Dean, both of Milford, Connecticut, to capture air-sea rescue missions off of Key West while they were based at the nearby Naval Air Station Key West. They were among 78 artists selected that year to create works of art depicting Navy subjects.\nSelected artists\nA select list of representative American artists includes:\n{| style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n|  style=\"width:33%; vertical-align:top;\"|\nRevolutionary War\n* Ralph Earl\n* John Trumbull\nAmerican Civil War\n* Alonzo Chappel\n* Edwin Forbes\n* Gilbert Gaul\n* Winslow Homer\n* Thomas Nast\n* Julian Scott\n* Xanthus Russell Smith\n* Alfred Waud\n* William Waud\n|  style=\"width:33%; vertical-align:top;\"|\nSpanish–American War\n* Howard Chandler Christy Newspaper\n* William Glackens Newspaper\n* Henry Reuterdahl Newspaper\n* Walter Russell Newspaper\nWorld War I\n* William James Aylward\n* Walter Jack Duncan\n* Harvey Thomas Dunn\n* Kerr Eby Marines\n* George Matthews Harding\n* Wallace Morgan\n* Ernest Clifford Peixotto\n* John Singer Sargent\n* J.
