It reached number 7 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart. The lead-off single was a non-album track \"C'mon Betty Home\" b/w \"Old Joe Clark\". \"One More Town\" b/w \"She Was Too Good to Me\" was released as a single later the same year. Neither single made the Top 40. Something Special was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Folk Recording category.\nA notable feature of Something Special is that it was highly orchestrated, using strings, brass instruments and a choir.\nReception\n}}\nAllmusic music critic Bruce Eder wrote the album \"was the oddest of all the Kingston Trio's albums... a marked departure from previous work by the trio... The results aren't bad so much as they are strange at times.\"\nReissues\n*Something Special was reissued along with Back in Town on CD by Collectors Choice Records in 2000. A bonus track, \"C'mon Betty Home\" is included.\n*In 2000, all of the tracks from Something Special were included in The Stewart Years 10-CD box set issued by Bear Family Records. This collection also includes eleven tracks without Jimmie Haskell's orchestral overdubs; the twelfth cut, \"Old Joe Clark,\" appeared on the album as it was originally recorded.\nTrack listing\nSide one\n# \"Brown Mountain Light\" (Scotty Wiseman) – 2:48\n# \"One More Town\" (John Stewart) – 2:57\n# \"Oh Willow Waley\" (Georges Auric, Paul Dehan) – 2:46\n# \"Tell it on the Mountain\" (Traditional, Nick Reynolds, Bob Shane, Stewart) – 1:55\n# \"Little Boy\" (Mike Settle) – 2:33\n# \"Strange Day\" (Stewart, George Yanok) – 3:55\nSide two\n# \"Away Rio\" (Reynolds, Shane, Stewart) – 2:57\n# \"Pullin' Away\" (Reynolds, Shane, Stewart) – 3:17\n# \"She Was Too Good To Me (Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart) – 2:46\n# \"Jane, Jane, Jane\" (Stan Wilson) – 2:51\n# \"Portland Town\" (Stewart) – 1:59\n# \"Old Joe Clark\" (Traditional) – 1:58\nPersonnel\n*Bob Shane – vocals, guitar\n*Nick Reynolds – vocals, tenor guitar, bongos, conga\n*John Stewart – vocals, banjo, guitar\n*Dean Reilly – bass\nProduction notes\n*Voyle Gilmore – producer\n*Pete Abbott – engineer\n*Jimmie Haskell – arrangements, conductor\nChart positions\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Chart\n!Position\n|-\n|1962\n|Billboard Pop Albums\n|7\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
