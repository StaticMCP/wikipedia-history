The ship was sunk on August 24, 1927 in a collision with the cruiser  off Miho Bay, and was struck from the naval list on September 15, 1927.\nDesign and description\nThe Momi class was designed with higher speed and better seakeeping than the preceding  second-class destroyers. The ships had an overall length of  and were  between perpendiculars. They had a beam of , and a mean draft of . The Momi-class ships displaced  at standard load and  at deep load. Warabi was powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by three Kampon water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce  to give the ships a speed of . The ships carried a maximum of  of fuel oil which gave them a range of  at . Their crew consisted of 110 officers and crewmen.\nThe main armament of the Momi''-class ships consisted of three  Type 3 guns in single mounts; one gun forward of the well deck, one between the two funnels, and the last gun atop the aft superstructure. The guns were numbered '1' to '3' from front to rear. The ships carried two above-water twin sets of  torpedo tubes; one mount was in the well deck between the forward superstructure and the bow gun and the other between the aft funnel and aft superstructure.\nConstruction and career\nWarabi, built at the Fujinagata Shipyards in Osaka, was laid down on October 12, 1920, launched on September 28, 1921 and completed on December 19, 1921. The ship was sunk on August 24, 1927 in a collision with the cruiser  off Miho Bay, and was struck from the naval list on September 15, 1927. In the collision and sinking, 119 people died.\nWreck\nIn September 2020 researchers discovered what they concluded is the forward section of Warabi  to the northeast of the Mihonoseki Lighthouse, Shimane Prefecture, noting that the ship had broken in two in the collision,. The aft part was located in July 2021,  north of the bow.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*"
