It took place off the coast of Ocracoke Island, North Carolina, where Blackbeard and his crew were ambushed by British naval forces led by Lieutenant Robert Maynard of the Royal Navy.\nBackground\nBlackbeard had been terrorizing the American colonies and had recently been granted a pardon by North Carolina's governor, Charles Eden. However, Virginia's governor, Alexander Spotswood, sent a naval force under Maynard to hunt him down as he saw him as a future threat to Virginia's Shipping and trade, and because he sought to boost his own political career and reputation, despite acting outside his jurisdiction and potentially violating pardons granted to pirates.\nBattle\nBlackbeard fought ferociously but was shot five times and slashed more than twenty times before finally dying.\nHis head was severed and hung from Maynard's ship as proof of his death. His body was reportedly thrown into the water, where legend says it swam around the ship three times before sinking.\nReferences"
