If they are consistent, then P can be shown independent of them if adding P to them, or adding the negation of P, both yield consistent sets of axioms.  For example, Euclid's axioms including the parallel postulate yield Euclidean geometry, and with the parallel postulate negated, yields non-Euclidean geometry. For examples, elliptic geometry (no parallels) and hyperbolic geometry (many parallels). Both elliptic and hyperbolic geometry are consistent systems, showing that the parallel postulate is independent of the other axioms.\nProving independence is often very difficult. Forcing is one commonly used technique.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
