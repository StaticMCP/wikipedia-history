Its area is the majority of Jamaica, including its capital, Kingston. the ecclesiastical province has three suffragan dioceses: Belize City-Belmopan, Mandeville and Montego Bay, as well as the Mission Sui Iuris of Cayman Islands. They and the archdiocese are members of the Antilles Episcopal Conference.\nHistory\nThe archdiocese was originally called the Vicariate Apostolic of Jamaica when it was erected in 1837. In 1956, it became Diocese of Kingston and included all of Jamaica. In September 1967, two suffragans were split from the diocese and the diocese was elevated to an archdiocese.\nAs of 2006, the diocese contains 32 parishes, 30 active diocesan priests, 27 religious priests, and 56,200 Catholics. It also has 174 religious brothers, 113 religious sisters, and 19 permanent deacons. Donald James Reece was the Archbishop between 12 April 2008 and 15 April 2011. He was succeeded by Charles Henry Dufour, former bishop of the Diocese of Montego Bay, who was appointed 15 April 2011.\nBishops\nOrdinaries\n#Benito Fernández, O.F.M.
