Both then left to join Queen of the South. As a target man, Cochrane fed-off the service of Queens two wingers, McMinn and Jimmy Robertson. Both mentioned Cochrane's contribution to the team when later interviewed by the club, as did former Queens manager Nobby Clark. The Doonhamers gained promotion from the Scottish Second Division in season 1985–86, as runners-up to Dunfermline Athletic by only two points. Then Cochrane was forced to cut-short his playing career after a serious knee injury in November 1986 at East End Park versus the Pars, as Queens went on to escape relegation at the end of the 1986–87 season from the Scottish First Division by only two points.\nHonours\nQueen of the South\n*Scottish Second Division Promotion: 1985–86\nReferences"
