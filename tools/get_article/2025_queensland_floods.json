The disaster resulted in at least two fatalities from flooding, 31 fatalities from a disease outbreak and prompted mass evacuation orders in Queensland's coastal regions. As of 21 March 2025, Western Queensland was experiencing widespread torrential rainfall and flooding throughout the Southwest. As of 12 April 2025, the flooding was continuing and had an estimated cost exceeding $1.2 billion (AUD) to the Queensland economy.\nMeteorology\nThe severe weather event was characterized by two tropical lows around north Queensland that produced rainfall totals the Australian Bureau of Meteorology compared to cyclonic conditions, despite not officially forming into cyclones. A third system in the Coral Sea was identified as having a moderate chance of developing into a tropical cyclone. The weather system produced significant rainfall, with 24-hour totals reaching up to  in affected areas by 1 February. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology forecast the potential for continued heavy rainfall and damaging winds into early February, with its intensity dependent on the trough's strength and position. Meteorologists forecast additional rainfall between  in the Ingham-Townsville corridor, with potential totals reaching  in some areas. Areas outside this corridor were expected to receive between  over six hours, with isolated rainfall potentially reaching  in 24 hours. Major flood warnings were issued for the Bohle, Black, Herbert, Haughton, and Ross rivers, while flood watches were implemented for the Proserpine, Burdekin, and additional sections of the Black River.\n, which links Picnic Bay with the rest of the island, being repaired in June 2025]]\nBy 4 p.m. local time on 2 February, some areas received more than 1,000 millimetres () of precipitation, with Paluma recording over  of rainfall within a three-hour period. Severe thunderstorms produced additional intense rainfall in the Herbert and Lower Burdekin regions. The Bureau of Meteorology reported that Paradise Lagoon recorded  of rainfall in three hours, and Rollstone recorded . Isolated areas near Ingham recorded over  in 24 hours.\nThe Bureau of Meteorology also closely monitored tidal conditions, forecasting high tides between  on 2 February, approximately  above normal levels.\nFloods\nMajor flooding particularly impacted the Shire of Hinchinbrook, a coastal locality of approximately 11,000 residents located 1500 kilometres north of Brisbane. The flooding also affected several suburbs in the nearby city of Townsville, significantly impacting Giru. Townsville University Hospital announced the cancellation of most elective surgeries for 3 January, with only urgent procedures continuing. The Townsville Airport announced closure from 12:30 PM on 2 February due to the severe weather conditions, with airlines canceling and rescheduling services. By 3:30&nbsp;p.m. local time, the Ross River Dam reached a capacity of 163.8%, causing Townsville's disaster management group to close it to the public and halt traffic to the area. The Bruce Highway Ollera Creek Bridge north of Townsville collapsed due to the flooding, delaying or cutting supplies and access by road to different communities north of the bridge. The federal government announced that the Australian Defence Force would work with Queensland's Department of Transport and Main Roads on a temporary fix for the bridge for emergency access. The Prime Minister and Premier both pledged to build the bridge back better than it had been to ensure it wouldn't be knocked out by a future event.\nIn Cardwell, there was extensive flooding of residential areas, particularly along Roma Street. The Cassowary Coast Regional Council issued emergency alerts for the town, warning of the possible spread of inundation in low-lying areas.\nIn Ingham, floodwaters inundated several local businesses and caused widespread road closures. One person in Ingham was rescued from his submerged vehicle by community members. Approximately 6,700 properties lost power after the Ingham Substation was deactivated for safety purposes. The Herbert River rose significantly to , with predicted peak levels expected to rise to , matching historic flooding caused by Cyclone Dinah in March 1967. A woman drowned in floodwaters at Ingham when a State Emergency Service (SES) boat capsized after striking a tree on Rutledge Street, prompting investigation. The vessel was carrying six people at the time of the incident, with five being safely rescued. An 82-year-old woman was found dead in a cane paddock near Ingham on 4 February.\nThe locality of Palm Island suffered a complete power outage after its electrical network was damaged in a landslide.\nOn 19 March 2025, North Queensland was once again hit with significant flooding across Townsville and surrounds, with Toolakea being the most impacted, having recorded 293mm of rain.\nPower outages\nThe flooding caused significant disruption to essential services across north Queensland. More than 8,000 homes lost power, with approximately 6,000 affected properties in Hinchinbrook, 2,000 in Townsville, and 600 in Mackay.\nGoods shortages\nDue to the floods, major transport routes such as Bruce Highway were cut off in several places in early February, leading to numerous reports of produce supply shortages. Supermarkets in Cairns, Innisfail and Ingham were reported to have emptied produce sections, except for excessive amounts of bananas, a local product; conversely, other regions of Australia anticipated banana shortages, as almost all of Australia's banana production takes place in the affected region.\nMelioidosis\nAt least 31 people in Queensland were killed by an outbreak of melioidosis, a soil-borne disease. Cairns and Townsville saw the majority of cases. One theory for the spike in melioidosis cases documented by a Cairns Hospital specialist doctor was that the Bruce Highway upgrades that commenced in 2010 stirred up clay-like soil that may harbour the disease.\nResponse\nRegional emergency management authorities issued evacuation orders for low-lying areas in coastal Queensland due to continuous torrential rainfall threatening life and property, and urged evacuees to bring evacuation kits. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for six suburbs of Townsville designated as being in the \"black zone\", including Cluden, Oonoonba, Hermit Park, Railway Estate, Idalia, and Rosslea. Despite evacuation orders, some residents, particularly elderly community members, chose to remain in their homes.\nThe State Emergency Service responded to dozens of calls for assistance across Ingham, Cardwell, Halifax, and other isolated communities. Swift water rescue teams conducted multiple operations in flood-affected areas, including the evacuation and rescue of families, several individuals stranded on rooftops in Cardwell, and one man found hanging onto a fence in Ingham. The Queensland government declared disaster situations for Townsville, Hinchinbrook, and Innisfail.\nErgon Energy implemented power shutdowns in flood-prone areas to prevent catastrophic equipment failure. An Ergon Energy vehicle was stolen while responding to reports of downed power lines in Townsville, though the vehicle was later recovered.\nThe Insurance Council of Australia (ICA) declared the floods a \"significant event,\" with the potential to escalate to \"insurance catastrophe\" status based on claim numbers and complexity.\nThe Department of the Environment, Tourism, Science and Innovation issued warnings about increased crocodile activity during the flooding, including in areas where they were typically not present.\nThe Australian Government activated Personal Hardship Assistance for parts of Townsville and select Gordonvale addresses. The assistance package included emergency payments of $180 per person and up to $900 for families of five or more, as well as possible grants for structural repairs and impacted household goods. Prime Minister of Australia Anthony Albanese pledged the \"full support\" of both Queensland and federal governments, committing to provide all necessary resources to address the crisis. The Prime Minister confirmed direct communication with Premier of Queensland David Crisafulli to coordinate response efforts.\nSee also\n*2025 New South Wales floods\nReferences"
