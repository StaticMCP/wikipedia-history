For example, the regular meetings of the sixteen office-holders are called Conference of minister-presidents (Ministerpräsidentenkonferenz).\nConstitutional roles and powers\nAs the German constitution (Basic Law) defines the Federal Republic of Germany as a federation, each German state enjoys sovereignty, limited only by the Basic Law. The Basic Law gives the states a broad discretion to determine their respective state structure, only stating that each German state has to be a social and democratic republic under the rule of law (Article 28.1). In practice all German states have adopted some form of a mixed parliamentary republican system: Despite some differences between the individual state constitutions, the  minister-presidents have both typical powers of an executive leader (for example appointing and dismissing cabinet members or defining the political guidelines of the cabinet) and typical powers and functions of a head of state (for example the power to grant pardons on behalf of the state and to perform certain ceremonial duties). As such, their powers and functions resemble those of an executive president, but in contrast to a presidential system, they are not directly elected and depend on the confidence of the respective state parliament. Thus, the constitutional position of a minister-president differs from that of the Chancellor of Germany at the federal level, who only holds the role of a chief executive leader, while the President of Germany performs the more ceremonial powers and functions of the federal head of state.\nEven though all sixteen  Minister-presidents hold roughly the same position in their states, there are also some important differences between the provisions of the state constitutions with regard to the head of state and government. This begins with the election procedure: All  Minister-presidents are elected by the state parliament, but while in some states a majority of parliament members is needed for a successful election, in other states a simple majority (a plurality of votes cast) is sufficient. The same goes for recall procedures: In some states, the parliament may simply vote an officeholder out of office, while in other states the parliament has to elect a new officeholder at the same time (Constructive vote of no confidence). In Bavaria, the constitution does not allow a recall of the minister-president at all.\nIn fifteen states, the state constitution defines the minister-president as the leader of the cabinet, giving him or her the right, to determine the cabinet's political guidelines, but this is not the case in Bremen, where the President of the Senate only has a ceremonial precedence over the other cabinet members. The power of the minister-president to shape the cabinet also varies: Some states allow the office-holder complete discretion in appointing or dismissing cabinet ministers, while others impose limits. The constitution of Bremen does not grant the President of the Senate any direct influence over the cabinet's composition.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! State !! Title !! Election threshold !!

Along with several of their ministers, they commonly represent their state in the Bundesrat (the German Federal Council). Each state government is represented in the Bundesrat by three to six delegates, depending on the state's population.\nList of current office-holders\nThe longest-serving incumbent office-holder is Reiner Haseloff, who has served as the minister-president of Saxony-Anhalt since 19 April 2011. Olaf Lies, the minister-president of Lower Saxony (since 20 May 2025), is the shortest-serving incumbent.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

In most states the deputy of the minister-president holds the title Deputy Minister-president (in Berlin Mayor, in Bremen Deputy President of the Senate and in Hamburg Second Mayor). In some states, the state constitution allows for the oppointment of more than one deputy. This option is used sometimes in coalition governments with more than two parties, although in this case a hierarchy is usually established between the deputies (first and second deputy minster-president or, in Bavaria, deputy minister-president and additional deputy minister-president). Berlin is a special case, as the state constitution there requires the appointment of two equally ranking deputies.\nTheir duties and functions mirror roughly those of the vice chancellor of Germany on federal level. Most importantly, the deputy minister-president (or equivalent) temporarily act as Minister-president in case of the office-holder's death or incapacity until the end of the incapacity or the election of a successor by the state parliament. An exception to this are the regulations in the state constitution of Bavaria (Art. 44.3), which designates both the deputy minister-president (for internal affairs) and the President of the Landtag (for the external representation) as acting successors. Resigning minister-presidents normally stay in office as acting minister-presidents (or equivalent) themselves until a successor is elected. This is however not the case, if the reason for the resignation is some form of constitutional, legal or traditional incompatibility with an office, on which the resigning office-holder has entered: The Basic Law prohibits the President of Germany from holding office in a state government at the same time (Art. 55.1). According to the Federal Constitutional Court Act, the same applies to judges on the Federal Constitutional Court (§ 3.3). Simultaneous membership in the Bundestag or the federal government is not prohibited for a minister-president (or other members of a state government) under federal law, but in some states (for example North Rhine-Westphalia) it is forbidden by the state constitution and generally it is not in line with political tradition. Therefore, office-holders elected or appointed to such office usually resign and refrain from continuing to hold the office of minister-president on an acting basis, leaving that role to their deputy.\nNormally, such full replacements last only a few days or even a few hours, but there have also been cases in which such acting Minister-presidents have had to remain in office for a longer period because the election of a new regular incumbent had proved difficult; this occurred for example in Schleswig-Holstein in 1987/88: The state election on 13 September 1987 had resulted in a stalemate between the centre-right bloc of CDU and FDP, which supported the incumbent Uwe Barschel, and the centre-left parties SPD and SSW, each with 37 seats. Due to the weak election results for the CDU and above all the Barschel affair, a supposed election-fraud scandal, Barschel declared his resignation with effect from 2 October and died a few days later in a hotel in Geneva under circumstances that have not been clarified to this day. As a result, the previous deputy Henning Schwarz became acting Minister-president. Attempts to elect a new Minister-president in the state parliament failed because of the stalemate, so the parliament dissolved itself and early state elections were held on 8 May 1988. The SPD emerged from these with an absolute majority of seats and its leading candidate Björn Engholm was elected Minister-president on 31 May. Schwarz thus held office as acting Minister-president for 242 days.\nCurrent (first) deputy minister-presidents\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! State\n! Title\n!

However, several other parties (including all parties currently represented in the Bundestag, apart from the AfD) have at least once provided a minister-president.\nAlliance 90/The Greens:\n*Winfried Kretschmann, Minister-President of Baden-Württemberg (since 2011)\nCentre Party:\n*Rudolf Amelunxen, Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia (1946–1947)\nChristian People's Party of Saarland:\n*Johannes Hoffmann, Minister-President of Saarland (1947–1955)\nFree Democratic Party of Germany (FDP):\n*Reinhold Maier, Minister-President of Württemberg-Baden (1945–1952), Minister-President of Baden-Württemberg (1952–1953)\n*Thomas Kemmerich, Minister-President of Thuringia (2020)\nGerman Party:\n*Heinrich Hellwege, Minister-President of Lower Saxony (1955–1959)\nThe Left:\n*Bodo Ramelow, Minister-President of Thuringia (2014–2020 and 2020–2024)\nThree Minister-presidents were independent:\n*Fritz Schäffer, Minister-President of Bavaria (1945)\n*Karl Geiler, Minister-President of Hesse (1945–1946)\n*Heinrich Welsch, Minister-President of Saarland (1955–1956)\nSee also\n*Ministerpräsident (Prussia)\nReferences"
