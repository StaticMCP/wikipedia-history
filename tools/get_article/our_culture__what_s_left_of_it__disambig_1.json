It is composed of twenty-six separate pieces that cover a wide range of topics from drug legalisation to the influence of Shakespeare. A common theme is criticism of modern society in Great Britain and, in many articles, social attitudes towards literature. The book was published by the Ivan R. Dee group. He generally describes British culture as a \"moral swamp\" and writes that the people must return to past traditions before it is too late.\nContents\nAs a common theme, Dalrymple depicts what he sees as \"the moral swamp that is contemporary Britain\". He criticises current British national culture as \"a banal, self-pitying, witless and shallow emotional incontinence\". He advocates a restoration of what he calls traditional British virtues such as \"prudence, thrift, industry, honesty, moderation, politeness, self-restraint\".\nHe condemns the secularisation of British society, writing:\nHe describes his experience treating people who use illegal drugs. He defends the 'war on drugs' and attacks the arguments for legalisation. He writes, \"If the war on drugs is lost, then so are the wars against theft, speeding, incest, fraud, rape, murder, arson... Few, if any such wars are winnable.\"\nReception\nThe Times Literary Supplement published a mostly positive review by author and editor Richard Davenport-Hines. Davenport-Hines argued that Dalrymple left out the negative influence of American culture on Britain—such as the instant gratification provided on trashy American television and the popularity of unhealthy American fast food. Richard Davenport-Hines also wrote more generally that:\nA supportive review appeared in News Weekly, who stated that \"It is rare for a book on social issues to be so readable, but this is not a work of abstract social theory.\" The review also stated that \"The vividness of Dalrymple's prose and the remorseless logic of his arguments make this a formidable work. Anyone concerned about the fate of Western civilisation should read this book.\"\nSee also\n*2005 in literature\n*Spoilt Rotten: The Toxic Cult of Sentimentality\n*Life at the Bottom: The Worldview That Makes the Underclass\nReferences"
