It is visible in the left horizon of the famous Earthrise photograph (AS08-14-2383) taken by astronaut William Anders on the Apollo 8 mission to the Moon in 1968.  The crater's name was approved by the IAU on 5 October 2018. The crater Anders' Earthrise, also visible in the Earthrise photograph, was named at the same time.\n8 Homeward was previously designated Ganskiy M.
