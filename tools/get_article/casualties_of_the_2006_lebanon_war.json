The Lebanese Higher Relief Council (HRC), UNICEF, and various press agencies and news organizations have stated that most of those killed were Lebanese civilians, however the Lebanese government does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in death toll figures. The Israeli government identified 43 Israeli civilians killed by Hezbollah rocket attacks, including four who died of heart attacks during rocket attacks. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) death toll ranges from 118 to 121, depending on the source and whether or not casualties that occurred after the ceasefire are included. The figures for the Hezbollah fighters killed are the most varying, with Hezbollah claiming 250 of its fighters killed, while Israel claimed to have identified 530 dead Hezbollah fighters. The IDF estimates 600–700 dead Hezbollah fighters. Sources can be conflicting.\nOverall\nCasualties of involved parties\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE; color:black\"| Entity !!style=\"background:#B0C4DE; color:black\"| Civilian !!style=\"background:#B0C4DE; color:blck\"| Military\n|-\n| Amal Movement\n|\n|20 dead\n|-\n| Hezbollah\n|\n|Deaths: ≈250 fighters KIA reported by Hezbollah, ≤500 estimated by Lebanese Government, Military, and Intelligence officials, ≈500 estimated by UN ≈600 estimated by IDF, 450 bodies identified by Israel and up to 700 estimated by Amidror\n|-\n|\n|*45 dead35 seriously wounded70 moderately wounded1,390 lightly wounded2,775 treated for shock and anxiety\n|IDF casualties\n*120 soldiers were killed in the war, including the two soldiers whose bodies were seized in the Zar'it-Shtula incident that started the war, whose fates weren't confirmed until their bodies were exchanged for Lebanese prisoners in 2008.\n*1,244 soldiers wounded\n|-\n|\n|Not known for certain. 1,200 Lebanese dead in total (including combatants and foreign civilians in Lebanon)4,410 injured\n|50 dead~100 wounded\n|-\n| LCP\n|\n|15 dead\n|-\n| PFLP-GC\n|\n|2 dead\n|-\n|\n|1 dead\n|5 dead125 wounded.

He also reportedly said: \"On top of those victims, there are 150 to 200 bodies still under the rubble. We have not been able to pull them out because the areas they died in are still under fire\".\n* As of 5 August, The American University of Beirut Medical Center, the largest and most important hospital in Lebanon, had only enough power to continue operations for a week.

(Abraham Rabinovich recently reported in The Washington Times on Sept. 27 that Israel now had 532 names.)\nA report on August 4, documenting Iran's financial help to the families of Hezbollah fighters, claimed Hezbollah had already lost 500 men, plus 1,500 wounded. The report said that the wounded were being treated in Syria to make the wounded harder to count.\nIsraeli\n* A total of 121 IDF soldiers were killed in the war, including the two soldiers whose bodies were seized in the Zar'it-Shtula incident that started the war, whose fates weren't confirmed until their bodies were exchanged for Lebanese prisoners in 2008.\n* According to Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 43 civilians have been killed, out of which 18 were Israeli Arabs, while another 418 civilians were treated in hospitals, 19 of whom were seriously injured, and another 875 treated for shock.\n* $1.6 billion cost to the Israeli economy\n* The war cost Israel $5.3 billion\n* Northern Israeli businesses lost $1.4 billion\n* Estimated compensation to be given to the population of northern Israel is $335.4 million\n* Israel plans to given $460 million to local governments and emergency services in northern Israel\n* 630 factories in Israel were closed\n* Israel lost 1.5 percent in GDP\n* 300,000 Israelis were displaced\n* Over 1 million Israelis lived in bomb shelters\n* 6,000 homes were hit by rockets\n* Israel's forests are expected to recover in 50–60 years\n* 6,178 of grazing land in Israel was burned\n*  of natural or planted forests were burned\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Israeli military and civilian Casualties in the 2006 Lebanese war\n! || colspan=\"3\" | Soldiers || colspan=\"2\" | Civilians || colspan=\"2\" | Rockets fired\n|-\n!||Killed||Wounded||Captured||Killed||Wounded||on Israel\n|-\n|12 July||8||4||2||||2||22\n|-\n|13 July||||2||||2||67||125\n|-\n|14 July||4||2||||2||19||103\n|-\n|15 July||||4||||||16||100\n|-\n|16 July||||17||||8||77||47\n|-\n|17 July||||||||||28||92\n|-\n|18 July||||1||||1||21||136\n|-\n|19 July||2||15||||2||18||116\n|-\n|20 July||5||8||||||16||34\n|-\n|21 July||1||3||||||52||97\n|-\n|22 July||||7||||||35||129\n|-\n|23 July||||||||2||45||94\n|-\n|24 July||4||27||||||17||111\n|-\n|25 July||||10||||2||60||101\n|-\n|26 July||8||31||||1||32||169\n|-\n|27 July||||6||||||38||109\n|-\n|28 July||||10||||||19||111\n|-\n|29 July||||7||||||10||86\n|-\n|30 July||||8||||||81||156\n|-\n|31 July||||12||||||25||6\n|-\n|1 August||3||12||||||||4\n|-\n|2 August||1||41||||1||88||230\n|-\n|3 August||4||22||||8||76||213\n|-\n|4 August||3||25||||3||97||194\n|-\n|5 August||2||70||||4||59||170\n|-\n|6 August||12||35||||4||150||189\n|-\n|7 August||3||35||||||12||185\n|-\n|8 August||6||74||||||10||136\n|-\n|9 August||15||186||||||36||166\n|-\n|10 August||2||123||||2||21||155\n|-\n|11 August||1||76||||||26||123\n|-\n|12 August||24||131||||||24||64\n|-\n|13 August||9||203||||1||105||217\n|-\n|14 August||||37||||||2||\n|-\n|15 August||2||||||||||\n|-\n!Total||119||1244||2||43||1384||3990\n|}\nUnited Nations\nUN personnel were subjected to dozens of attacks and near misses from both sides during the present conflict, most prominently the 25 July Israeli bombing of a UNTSO position, which killed four UNTSO unarmed observers (Austrian, Canadian, Chinese and Finnish). Diplomats familiar with the probe say that the strike was carried out with a precision-guided missile.\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan said in a statement from Rome that he was \"shocked and deeply distressed by the apparently deliberate targeting by Israeli Defence Forces.\" On 26 July 2006, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert phoned Kofi Annan and expressed his deep regret over the death of the four UN observers. He promised that Israel would thoroughly investigate the incident and would share the findings with Annan, but says he was taken aback by secretary general's statement saying that the Israeli attack on the UN post was \"apparently deliberate\".\nAfter the attack, Dan Gillerman, Israel's UN representative, said Israel would not allow the UN itself to participate in an investigation of the airstrike that killed the four UN observers.\nJust before the end of bombing, on 14 August, the IDF targeted what it said was a Palestinian faction in the Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp in Saida. Two missiles were fired into a civilian residential area and killed UNRWA/UN staff member Abdel Saghir. Few days before two civilians were killed.\nSee also\n* Arab–Israeli conflict\n* United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon – UNIFIL (1978–present)\n* 2006 Qana airstrike\n* Allegations of war crimes in the 2006 Lebanon War\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2006/12/28/lebanon_sees_more_than_1000_war_deaths/ Over 1200 Lebanese killed, 120 Israeli soldiers]\n* [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3289147,00.html Israel Casualties], Ynetnews\n*"
