Warman, a granite quarry owner who was killed by the fall of a derrick.  According to author and geologist Warren Upham, Warman opened a granite quarry in 1907, and on July 18 of that year, he and his wife, Sarah J. Warman, platted a community named Warman Creek on the west side of what now is State Highway 65, while N. C. Pike of Pike–Horning Granite Company, on July 23, 1907, platted a community on the east side of the roadway calling it East Mora.  Eventually, these two small, competing communities merged to form the unincorporated community of Warman.  A post office operated from 1907 until 1920.\nReferences\n* Rand McNally Road Atlas – 2007 edition – Minnesota entry\n* Official State of Minnesota Highway Map – 2013/2014 edition"
