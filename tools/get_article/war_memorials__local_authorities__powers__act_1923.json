It received royal assent on 18 July 1923.\nIt extended throughout the United Kingdom, and empowered county, borough, district and parish councils (\"local authorities\") to incur expenditure on constructing and maintaining a war memorial within the area for which they were responsible. Expenditure was to be covered by levying a rate which was not to exceed 1⅓ of a penny in the pound for any given financial year (0.5%); parish councils were required to have this rate approved by the county council.\nThe Act has been modernised in line with administrative reorganisations, but is still in force.\nReferences"
