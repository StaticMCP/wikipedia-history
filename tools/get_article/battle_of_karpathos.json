Bayezid II, who especially aimed to make substantial preparations against Venice, invited Kemal Reis to Istanbul in 1495 and allocated a significant budget to create a large fleet. In the same year, Kemal Reis made a show of strength in the Mediterranean with the navy he had expanded.\nIn 1498, Kemal Reis was assigned to transport the incomes of the foundations of the Haremeyn (Mecca and Medina) in Anatolia to Alexandria by sea, since the land route was not safe. This intended 13-piece (5 galleys, and 6 fusta Ottoman fleet reached Egypt at the beginning of June 1498 via the Aegean Sea-Eastern Mediterranean. If the Ottoman trade was harassed by the Knights Hospitaller off the coast of Crete, Kemal Reis warded off the harassment in order to risk the loss and avoid getting into trouble.\nBattle\nThe Ottoman fleet under the command of Kemal Reis was harassed again by the Knights Hospitaller on its way back in July. This time, the Ottoman navy, which had taken up battle formation to carry valuable cargo, attacked the Rhodian navy under the command of Nicolas Centurione (called \"Sunturluoğlu\" by the Ottomans). The Turkish navy, which sank the flagship and captured Centurione, also captured five Rhodian ships.\nKemal Reis made a triumphant entrance into Istanbul with the 5 Rhodian ships he captured and a large number of prisoners, and delivered the prisoners to the Sultan Bayezid II.\nReferences"
