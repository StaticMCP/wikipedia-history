He fought in the wars of religion, but was chiefly distinguished in the wars against the Turks on the eastern frontier. He was killed in a mutiny of the soldiers at Papa in Hungary in 1600.\nHis only son was Adam von Schwarzenberg (1583–1641), advisor of George William, Elector of Brandenburg during the Thirty Years' War.\nSee also\n* House of Schwarzenberg\nReferences\n;Attribution\n*\nNotes"
