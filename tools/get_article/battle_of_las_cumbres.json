It took place on 28 April 1862.  Despite holding the high ground, Zaragoza was not willing to risk his forces by engaging the French Army in the open.  As the French troops seized the first line of Mexican entrenchments, Zaragoza withdrew his forces to their stronghold of Puebla.\nSee also\n* Battle of Puebla\n* Siege of Puebla (1847)\n* Siege of Puebla (1863)\nReferences"
