As one of the self-proclaimed \"Big Four\" debutantes of Chicago during World , King inspired many characters in the novels and short stories of Jazz Age writer F. Scott Fitzgerald; in particular, the character of Daisy Buchanan in The Great Gatsby. A 16-year-old King met an 18-year-old Fitzgerald at a sledding party in Saint Paul, Minnesota, and they shared a passionate romance from 1915 to 1917.\nAlthough King was \"madly in love\" with Fitzgerald, their relationship ended when King's family intervened. Her father Charles Garfield King purportedly warned the young writer that \"poor boys shouldn't think of marrying rich girls\", and he forbade further courtship of his daughter. A heartbroken Fitzgerald dropped out of Princeton University and enlisted in the United States Army amid World . While courting his future wife Zelda Sayre and other young women when he was garrisoned near Montgomery, Alabama, Fitzgerald continued to write to King in the hope of rekindling their relationship.\nWhile Fitzgerald served in the army, King's father arranged her marriage to , the son of his wealthy business associate John J. Mitchell. An avid polo player, Bill Mitchell became the director of Texaco, and he served partly as a model for Thomas \"Tom\" Buchanan in The Great Gatsby. Despite King marrying Mitchell and Fitzgerald marrying Zelda Sayre, Fitzgerald remained in love with King until his death. Fitzgerald scholar Maureen Corrigan wrote that King, far more than the author's wife Zelda Sayre, became \"the love who lodged like an irritant in Fitzgerald's imagination, producing the literary pearl that is Daisy Buchanan\". In the mind of Fitzgerald, King was the prototype of the unobtainable, upper-class woman who embodies the elusive American Dream.\nDuring her relationship with Fitzgerald, Ginevra wrote a Gatsby-like story which she sent to the young author. In her story, she is trapped in a loveless marriage with a wealthy man yet still pines for Fitzgerald. The lovers are reunited only after Fitzgerald attains enough money to take her away from her adulterous husband. Fitzgerald kept Ginevra's story with him, and scholars have noted the plot similarities between Ginevra's story and Fitzgerald's novel.\nKing separated from Mitchell in 1937 after an unhappy marriage. A year later, Fitzgerald attempted to reunite with King when she visited Hollywood. The reunion proved a disaster due to Fitzgerald's alcoholism. A disappointed King returned to Chicago and she divorced Mitchell in 1939. She married John T. Pirie Jr., a business tycoon and owner of the Chicago department retailer Carson Pirie Scott & Company in 1942. She died in 1980 at the age of 82 at her estate in Charleston, South Carolina.\nEarly life and education\n's portrait ''Ginevra de' Benci'', after which King, her mother, and grandmother, were named]]\nBorn in Chicago, on November 30, 1898, King was the eldest daughter of socialite Ginevra Fuller (1877–1964) and Chicago stockbroker Charles Garfield King (1874–1945). She had two younger sisters, Marjorie and Barbara. Like her mother and her grandmother, her name derived from Ginevra de' Benci, a 15th-century Florentine aristocratic woman whom Leonardo da Vinci painted in an eponymous work.\nRaised in luxury at her family's sprawling estate in the township of Lake Forest, Ginevra enjoyed a carefree life of riding polo ponies and playing tennis as well as engaging in private-school intrigues and country-club flirtations. Both sides of Ginevra's family were extravagantly wealthy and exclusively socialized with the other wealthy families in Chicago such as the Mitchells, Armours, Cudahys, Swifts, McCormicks, Palmers, and Chatfield-Taylors. The privileged children of these prominent Chicago families played together, attended the same private schools, and endogamously married within this small social circle.\nDue to her family's immense wealth, the Chicago press chronicled Ginevra's mundane social activities, and newspaper columnists fêted the young Ginevra as one of the city's most desirable debutantes. As the center of attention in this environment, King developed \"a clear sense of her family's wealth and position and, from an early age, a highly developed understanding of how social status worked\". She socialized within an elite circle of other wealthy Chicago debutantes—self-proclaimed as the \"Big Four\"}}—which included her friends Edith Cummings, Courtney Letts, and Margaret Carry:}}\n}}\nAs a privileged teenager cocooned in a small circle of wealthy Protestant families, King developed a notorious self-centeredness, and she purportedly lacked introspection. Intensely competitive, King disliked losing to anyone at anything—tennis, golf or basketball. This competitiveness did not extend to her academic studies. Although she completed her schoolwork, she disliked learning and instead preferred parties where she could sit up late gossiping with her Big Four friends. Her closest friend in the Big Four quartet, Edith Cummings, became one of the premier amateur golfers during the Jazz Age and served as the model for the character of Jordan Baker in Fitzgerald's 1925 novel The Great Gatsby.\nIn 1914, King's father sent Ginevra to Middlebury, Connecticut, to attend the Westover School, an exclusive finishing school for the daughters of America's wealthiest families. Her Westover schoolmates included such notable persons as Isabel Stillman Rockefeller of the Rockefeller dynasty, as well as Margaret Livingston Bush and Mary Eleanor Bush,}} the aunts of President George H. W. Bush. The school prided itself on inculcating a sense of noblesse oblige in its pupils. Many of Westover's attendees became the wives of wealthy men who sought fulfillment as society hostesses and, if they wished, in helping those less privileged.\nRomance with Fitzgerald\n}}\nWhile visiting her Westover roommate Marie Hersey in St. Paul, Minnesota,}} a 16-year-old Ginevra King met an 18-year-old F. Scott Fitzgerald at a sledding party on Summit Avenue on January 4, 1915. At the time, Fitzgerald was a sophomore at Princeton University. The two teenagers fell in love. Fitzgerald described this petting encounter in a short story: \"It was the sleigh ride he remembered most and kissing her cool cheeks in the straw in one corner while she laughed up at the cold white stars. The couple next to them had their backs turned and he kissed her little neck and her ears and never her lips.\"\nAfter this flirtatious encounter under the stars in Minnesota, Ginevra returned to Westover in Connecticut, and Fitzgerald returned to nearby Princeton in New Jersey. He deluged Ginevra with correspondence which pleased her as she measured her popularity \"by which boys wrote to her and how many letters she received\". Against his wishes, Ginevra read Fitzgerald's intimate letters aloud to her Westover classmates and rival suitors for their amusement. At one point, Ginevra asked for a photograph of him as she coyly professed to recall only that he had \"yellow hair and big blue eyes\". Despite such coyness, Ginevra regarded Scott as among the more important of her many romantic conquests due to his handsome good looks and Princeton standing.\nThe lovers corresponded for months and exchanged photographs. Over time, their letters became passionate. Ginevra began having erotic dreams about Scott and \"slept with his letters\" in the hope \"that dreams about him would come in the night\". Fitzgerald visited Westover several times, and Ginevra professed in her diary to be \"madly in love with him\". In March 1915, Fitzgerald asked Ginevra to be his date for Princeton's sophomore prom, but Ginevra's mother forbade Ginevra to attend as the consort of a middle-class young man. \"I'm so [disappointed] about the dance I can't see straight,\" Ginevra wrote Scott. Despite this setback, they met again in June in New York. They dined at the Ritz and saw two Broadway plays, Nobody Home and Midnight Frolic. Fitzgerald wrote that Ginevra \"made luminous the Ritz roof on a brief passage through [New York].\"\nAs the months passed, King and Fitzgerald rendezvoused in different locations, and they discussed—perhaps lightheartedly—eloping. In February–March 1916, Fitzgerald wrote a short story titled \"The Perfect Hour\" in which he imagined Ginevra and himself blissfully together at last, and he mailed the love story to her by post as a token of his affection. Ginevra read the story aloud to a rival suitor who generously praised Fitzgerald's writing as excellent.\nIn response to Fitzgerald's \"The Perfect Hour\" tale, Ginevra herself wrote a Gatsby-like short story which she sent to Fitzgerald on March 6. In her story, she is trapped in a loveless marriage with a wealthy man yet still pines for Fitzgerald, a former lover from her past. The two lovers are reunited only after Fitzgerald attains enough money to take her away from her adulterous husband. Fitzgerald kept Ginevra's story with him until his death, and scholars have noted the plot similarities between Ginevra's story and Fitzgerald's work The Great Gatsby.\nDespite Fitzgerald's frequent visits and love letters, Ginevra continued entertaining other suitors.}} \"At this time,\" Ginevra later explained, \"I was definitely out for quantity not quality in beaux, and, although Scott was top man, I still wasn't serious enough not to want plenty of other attention!\" At the time, she wrote apologetically to Scott, \"I know I am a flirt and I can't stop it\".\nOn May 22, 1916, Westover School expelled Ginevra for flirting with a crowd of young male admirers from her dormitory window. Mary Robbins Hillard, the stern headmistress of Westover school, declared King to be a \"bold, bad hussy\" and an \"adventuress\", a derogatory term referring to a woman who ensnares wealthy men in order to increase her social position. After legal threats by Ginevra's imperious and influential father, a cowed Hillard readmitted King to the school, but her father—irate at Westover's treatment of his beloved daughter—decided that she instead would complete her education at a New York finishing school. Ginevra recounted these events in her diary:\n}}\nA shocked Fitzgerald regarded Ginevra's expulsion from Westover as a catastrophe that doomed both their relationship and his dreams. He later remarked to his daughter Scottie on the fated quality of the incident: \"It was in the cards that Ginevra King should get fired from Westover\". Due to Ginevra's abrupt expulsion, Fitzgerald could no longer visit her frequently from nearby Princeton, and he could no longer court her in the relatively egalitarian collegiate atmosphere which obscured his lack of wealth. Instead, he would be forced to continue his romantic pursuit of Ginevra at her family's villa in Lake Forest under the judgmental eyes of her class-conscious parents and in hopeless competition with the scions of affluent Chicago families.\nFollowing her expulsion from Westover, Fitzgerald visited Ginevra in August 1916 at her family's Lake Forest villa. The visit proved to be a disaster.}} Fitzgerald's ledger notes the presence of a romantic competitor, \"beautiful\" William \"Bill\" Mitchell, the son of Charles Garfield King's wealthy business associate John J. Mitchell. Now in competition with Bill Mitchell, Fitzgerald's reception at the villa by Ginevra's parents proved less hospitable. At the time, the predominantly White Anglo-Saxon Protestant township of Lake Forest socially excluded others such as Black and Jewish people, and the presence of a middle-class Irish Catholic parvenu such as Fitzgerald likely caused a stir.\nThere is much speculation regarding what transpired during Fitzgerald's final visit in August 1916. Stockbroker Charles Garfield King likely became irritated by Fitzgerald's pursuit of his daughter. He allegedly interrogated the 19-year-old Fitzgerald regarding his financial prospects. Disappointed by Fitzgerald's answers, he purportedly forbade further courtship of his daughter and instructed Ginevra to drive Fitzgerald to the nearest train station.}} Either Ginevra's father or someone else remarked, loud enough to be heard by the young Fitzgerald, that \"poor boys shouldn't think of marrying rich girls\". This line appears in the 1974 and 2013 film adaptations of The Great Gatsby.\nDue to his middle-class status and her family's intervention, the relationship between King and Fitzgerald stagnated. Two months later, in November 1916, their final encounter as a romantic couple occurred when Ginevra visited the Princeton campus for a Princeton–Yale football game. King and Fitzgerald rendezvoused amid the Roman colonnades of Penn Station. King later admitted that she had begun secretly dating a Yale student in New York by this time, and this complicated her rendezvous with Fitzgerald who was unaware of the other young man awaiting her attentions:\n}}\nIn January 1917, the final break between King and Fitzgerald occurred. By this time, likely echoing her father's opinion of Fitzgerald, Ginevra discounted the young writer as a suitable match because of his middle-class status. According to scholar James L. W. West, Ginevra scrutinized Fitzgerald \"against the backdrop of Lake Forest by that time, as opposed to seeing him at her school,\" and she realized he \"didn't fit in\" with the elite social milieu of the wealthy upper class. A heartbroken Fitzgerald claimed that King rejected his love with \"supreme boredom and indifference\", and he viewed Ginevra as a rich socialite who merely toyed with his sincere affections before casting him aside. In his mind, Ginevra became—much like Daisy Buchanan—one of the \"careless\" people of privilege who \"smashed up things … then retreated back into their money.\" In the wake of Ginevra's rejection, a distraught Fitzgerald dropped out of Princeton and enlisted in the United States Army amid World .\nArranged marriage to Mitchell\nWhile stationed as an army officer near Montgomery, Alabama, Fitzgerald continued writing Ginevra and begged to resume their relationship. During this interlude, Ginevra's father arranged her marriage to a business associate's son as a merger between two elite families.\nOn July 15, 1918, King wrote to Fitzgerald and informed him of her engagement to polo player William \"Bill\" Mitchell, the son of banker John J. Mitchell, president of the Illinois Trust & Savings Bank and a friend of Charles Garfield King with whom he shared offices in downtown Chicago. \"To say I am the happiest girl on earth would be expressing it mildly\", King wrote in a letter to Fitzgerald, \"I wish you knew Bill so that you could know how very lucky I am\".\nAccording to scholar James L. W. West, \"Ginevra's marriage to Bill Mitchell was a dynastic affair very much approved by both sets of parents. In fact Bill's younger brother, Clarence, would marry Ginevra's younger sister Marjorie a few years later.\" By consenting to marry the son of her father's business associate, Ginevra \"made the same choice Daisy Buchanan did, accepting the safe haven of money rather than waiting for a truer love to come along.\"\nGinevra King married Bill Mitchell at St. Chrysostom's Episcopal Church in Chicago, Illinois, on September 4, 1918. Newspapers lauded the event as one of the most attended weddings of the season. As the arranged marriage occurred amid World , a Chicago Tribune columnist described the wedding ceremony as a \"war wedding\" and heralded the occasion as \"the triumph of youth.\" Columnists gushed over \"the extreme youth of the bridal couple, their gay and gallant air, their uncommon good looks, the distinguished appearance of both sets of parents, the smart frocks and becoming uniforms, all made an impression of something brilliant, charming, and cheerful.\" The wedding ceremony featured \"great garlands of fruit, that Luca della Robbia himself might have designed, [which] outlined the [chapel] arches. The altar, with its wonderful blue reredos was adorned with flowers in blue vases set on a piece of filet lace, rich and rare enough for a royal marriage.\" After the ceremony, Mitchell's parents hosted a lavish wedding reception at the Blackstone Hotel.\n'' article describing King's wedding which Fitzgerald kept in his scrapbook with the note: \"The end of a once poignant story.\"]]\nAlthough Ginevra invited Fitzgerald to the wedding, he could not attend as he was stationed as an army officer in Montgomery, Alabama. He placed the wedding invitation, newspaper clippings reporting the ceremony, and a piece of Ginevra's handkerchief in his scrapbook with the note: \"THE END OF A ONCE POIGNANT STORY.\" Three days after Ginevra's wedding, on September 7, 1918, a lonely Fitzgerald professed his affections to Zelda Sayre, Zelda's grandfather was Confederate Senator Willis B. Machen. Her father's uncle was John Tyler Morgan, a Confederate general in the American Civil War and the second Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan in Alabama. Her family built the home used by Jefferson Davis for the White House of the Confederacy. }} a Southern belle whom he had met in Montgomery and who reminded him of Ginevra. A year and a half later, on April&nbsp;3, 1920, Fitzgerald married Sayre in a simple ceremony at St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York. At the time of their wedding, Fitzgerald later claimed neither he nor Zelda loved each other, and the early years of their marriage in New York City proved to be a disappointment.\nDespite King marrying Bill Mitchell and Fitzgerald marrying Zelda Sayre, Fitzgerald remained forever in love with King until his death and \"could not think of her without tears coming to his eyes\". In the years that followed, her rejection contributed to his incipient alcoholism. After failing to win her due to his lack of wealth, Fitzgerald grew embittered towards the upper class. In 1926, he wrote: \"Let me tell you about the very rich. They are different from you and me. They possess and enjoy early, and it does something to them, makes them soft where we are hard, and cynical where we are trustful, in a way that, unless you were born rich, it is very difficult to understand. They think, deep in their hearts, that they are better than we are.\" For the rest of his life, Fitzgerald harbored a resentment towards the wealthy.\nKing and Mitchell had three children, William, Charles, and Ginevra. Her second son Charles suffered from Down syndrome and required constant care. Ultimately, the arranged marriage between King and Mitchell proved tumultuous and unhappy, and the couple had difficulty residing in the same house together. Despite marital discord, His alcoholism resulted in cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, angina, dyspnea, and syncopal spells. As his health deteriorated, Fitzgerald feared he would die from congested lungs.}} \"She was the first girl I ever loved, and I have faithfully avoided seeing her up to this moment to keep the illusion perfect\", an ill Fitzgerald informed his daughter Scottie, shortly before the meeting. The reunion between King and Fitzgerald proved a disaster due to the author's alcoholism.\nAlthough \"on the wagon\" for months, the sight of Ginevra ostensibly broke Fitzgerald's resolve. After reminiscing over lunch, Fitzgerald lingered with Ginevra at the hotel bar. Shortly before Ginevra's departure, which Fitzgerald thought would be their final meeting, the forlorn author began downing double shots of gin. When Ginevra asked if she had inspired any characters in Fitzgerald's novel The Beautiful and Damned, an inebriated Fitzgerald quipped: \"Which bitch do you think you are?\" and James L. West III posits this remark was perhaps said in jest: \"He might have said it playfully rather than savagely. That sounds more in character for him. He was not a cruel man.\"}} On this note, they parted forever. Fitzgerald used this final meeting as the basis for his 1941 short story (posthumously published), \"Three Hours Between Planes\". Two years later, the 44-year-old author died of occlusive coronary arteriosclerosis on December 21, 1940.\nIn 1939, following the death of her 16-year-old disabled son Charles from pneumonia, Ginevra—who already had been living with businessman John T. Pirie—formally divorced Bill Mitchell. After their divorce, Bill Mitchell married heiress Sara Anne Wood, the daughter of General Robert E. Wood who spent three decades as chairman of Sears, Roebuck & Company. In April 1942, King married John T. Pirie, Jr. in a quiet ceremony. Three years later, in September 1945, Ginevra's father Charles Garfield King died at Passavant Hospital in Chicago at the age of 77. By the time of Charles Garfield King's death, the deceased Fitzgerald had experienced a posthumous revival, and the author whom the stockbroker once scorned had become one of the most famous names in America.\nIn January 1951, Fitzgerald's daughter Scottie sent Ginevra a copy of her letters which the author had kept with him until his death. Reviewing her teenage letters to Fitzgerald, Ginevra commented: \"I managed to gag through them, although I was staggering with boredom at myself by the time I was through. Goodness, what a self-centered little ass I was!\" \"I was too thoughtless in those days,\" she recalled, \"and too much in love with love to think of consequences.\" King later founded the Ladies Guild of the American Cancer Society. She died in 1980 at the age of 82 at her family's estate in Charleston, South Carolina. She was buried at Lake Forest Cemetery in Illinois.\nLegacy and influence\n}}\nin The Great Gatsby (portrayed by actress Lois Wilson).]]\nGinevra King exerted a tremendous influence on Fitzgerald's writing, far more so than his wife Zelda Sayre. Decades after their passionate romance, Fitzgerald described Ginevra as \"my first girl 18–20 whom I've used over and over [in my writing] and never forgotten\". Scholar Maureen Corrigan notes that \"because she's the one who got away, Ginevra—even more than Zelda—is the love who lodged like an irritant in Fitzgerald's imagination, producing the literary pearl that is Daisy Buchanan\".\nIn the mind of the author, King became the prototype of the unobtainable, upper-class woman who embodies the elusive American Dream. In contrast to earlier American authors who viewed the American Dream with considerable optimism, Fitzgerald's literary works such as The Great Gatsby depict the American Dream as an illusion since the pursuit of the dream—much like Fitzgerald's pursuit of Ginevra—only results in dissatisfaction for those who chase it, owing to its unattainability.\nIn addition to Daisy Buchanan in The Great Gatsby (1925), Fitzgerald's literary oeuvre abounds with characters modeled after and inspired by King, including:\n* Helen Halcyon in \"The Debutante\" (1917)\n* Isabelle Borgé in This Side of Paradise (1920)\n* Kismine Washington in \"The Diamond as Big as the Ritz\" (1922)\n* Judy Jones in \"Winter Dreams\" (1922)\n* Paula Legendre in \"The Rich Boy\" (1924)\n* Josephine Perry in The Basil and Josephine Stories (1928)\n* Nancy Holmes in \"Three Hours Between Planes\" (1941)\n* Their meeting in \"Babes in the Woods\" (1917), from the collection Bernice Bobs Her Hair and Other Stories, was reused in This Side of Paradise.\nKing is featured in the books  The Perfect Hour: The Romance of F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ginevra King by James L. W. West III and in a fictionalized form in ''Gatsby's Girl by Caroline Preston. The musical The Pursuit of Persephone'' tells the story of King's romance with Fitzgerald. She appears in West of Sunset by Stewart O'Nan, a fictionalized account of Fitzgerald's final years.\nSee also\n* Edith Cummings, a friend of King's and the inspiration for the character of Jordan Baker\n* Big Four, a quartet of wealthy debutantes famous in Chicago during World\nReferences\nNotes\nCitations\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*  }}\n*  }}\n*\n*\n*\n*  }}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*  | author-mask = 8 }}\n*\n*\n*\n*  }}\n*  }}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*  }}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*  }}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*  }}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*  }}\n*  }}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*  }}\n*  }}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*  | quote = William H.
