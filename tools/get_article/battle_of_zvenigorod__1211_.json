In 1211, supporters of Daniel Romanovich, the rightful heir to the throne, turned to King Andrew II of Hungary for help. The military expedition was led by the Palatine Pat Győr, who set out for Ruthenia with numerous Hungarian troops and allied Galician and Volhynian forces.\nAfter the capture of Przemyśl, the Hungarian army besieged Zvenigorod, where Vladimir Igorevich was defending himself. Reinforcements from the Rus' rulers and the Polovtsians, brought by Izyaslav Vladimirovich, came to the relief. The clash ended in the defeat of the defenders – Roman Igorevich was captured at Shumsk, and Zvenigorod fell into the hands of the coalition. After the victory, the intervention troops captured Halych, from which Vladimir Igorevich escaped. Daniel Romanovich was put back on the throne at the Uspensky Council, with the support of the Hungarians and boyar opposition.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*"
