In the , the locality of Kilcoy had a population of 1,996 people.\nGeography\nThe township is on the D'Aguilar Highway,  north west of the state capital, Brisbane, and just to the north of Lake Somerset.\nClimate\nRainfall in January 2013, another year of floods was .\nHistory\nAboriginal history\nThe Aboriginal people of the Brisbane River Valley and Kilcoy region are the Jinibara People, traditionally a nation of five clans: the Dungidau centred in the Kilcoy region and the junction of the Stanley and Brisbane Rivers; the Dala or Dallumbara clan inhabiting the Conondale Range west to the Brisbane River; the Gurumngar around the southern end of the D’Aguilar Range; the Nalbo along the Maleny-Mapleton escarpment and the Dungibara on the Upper Brisbane River.\nDuungidjawu (also known as Kabi Kabi, Cabbee, Carbi, Gabi Gabi) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Duungidjawu country. The Duungidjawu language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of Somerset Region and City of Moreton Bay, particularly the towns of Caboolture, Kilcoy, Woodford and Moore.\nKilcoy was the heartland of the Jinibara People and the name comes from a patch of lawyer cane (jini) on Mount Kilcoy; 'bara' means' people' or 'folk'; thus Jinibara are the 'People of the Lawyer cane'. Kilcoy was known as Bumgur, meaning the 'blue cod'.\nThe Kilcoy region is a rich Aboriginal cultural landscape.  Mount Archer was known as Buruja, and also the name of a wetland near Villeneuve that was one of the main camps of the Dungidau clan.  Bora rings existed at 'Wellcourt' on Somerset Dam and at Sandy Creek east of Kilcoy, Oaky Creek and Waraba Creek.\nThe junction of the Brisbane and Stanley Rivers was known as Gunundjin, meaning a 'hollow place', and a sacred place, called Gairnbee Rock, recalled a dreaming story of a girl who went swimming there and was turned by her father, a gundir (clever man) by magic into a rock to save her from a dangerous evil spirit. The Stanley River was also called Gairnbee, meaning the water gum.\nBritish colonisation\nIn 1841, brothers Evan and Colin Mackenzie, of Kilcoy Castle, Newtown Scotland, took up land west of Durundur (in the Stanley River valley) and began grazing sheep soon after land was opened to free settlement. They named it after their home town. They sold the property to Charles A. Atherton in 1849. Atherton in turn sold it to Captain Louis Hope and John Ramsay in 1854. The partnership broke up ten years later, and Hope became sole owner and built the Kilcoy Station homestead of bricks, made on the property, and red cedar. Station managers for Captain Hope were Bryant about 1860, Captain Talbot, 1864 and William Butler from 1871 until the sale, where he purchased the homestead block. Hopetoun Post Office opened on 1 December 1892 (a Kilcoy receiving office had been open from 1889) and was renamed Kilcoy in 1907.\nMassacre of Aboriginal people\nIn 1842 on the outskirts of Kilcoy Station owned by MacKenzie, 30–60 aborigines of the Gubbi Gubbi tribe, two Djindubari and some men from the Dalla tribe died from eating flour that settlers had laced with strychnine or arsenic. An extract of a German missionary's journal describing an expedition to the Bunya Country was published in The Colonial Observer in December 1842. During the expedition the missionaries and the Aboriginal people accompanying them discovered that ''\"a large number of natives, (about 50 or 60) having been poisoned at one of the squatter's stations.\"Ford, R. (2007). God’s harvest: a social and agricultural history of the German mission to the aboriginal people of Moreton Bay [University of the Sunshine Coast, Queensland].  In May 1861, evidence about the massacre was presented during the hearings of the Select Committee on the Native Police Force.''\nEstablishment of township\nIn 1877,  were resumed from the Kilcoy pastoral run and offered for selection on 19 April 1877.\nTimber milling operations were established as early as 1877, with Frank Nicholson building at Villeneuve, followed by James Green (1888), Hancock Brothers (1897), George Seeney and William and Stan Kropp in the same vicinity. The turn of the century saw a huge increase in activity as Hancock & Gore timber mill began operation.\nThe site of the 'Town of Kilcoy' was surveyed by W. E. Hill by April 1888, and the first land sale was on 6 November that year. The township quickly developed at the junction of Sheep Station and Kilcoy Creeks to service these settlers and their families.\nBy the 1890s, the only original lease country left was in the Mt Kilcoy and Sandy Creek districts, part of Durundur Station.  This country was not opened for settlement until 1902.\nKilcoy's first Provisional School was opened in 1884 at Sheep Station Creek, some five to six miles north of Kilcoy Homestead, the name changing to Sheep Station Creek Provisional School in 1892 when the Kilcoy School opened its doors in Hope Street in Kilcoy. At that time there were still no subdivisions north of William Street as that was part of Kilcoy Station which was sold up in 1907.\nSt Mary's Anglican Church was built in 1887. The timber church could seat 120 people.\nA postal receiving office was established in 1889. On 1 December 1892, the Hopetoun Post Office was opened at Kilcoy in rented premises in Royston Street. It was named after Louis Hope (the uncle of the first Governor General of Australia, Lord Hopetoun, who was a visitor to Kilcoy Station). The township was referred to unofficially as Hopetoun.\nKilcoy Township Provisional School opened on 15 August 1892. In 1893, it was renamed Kilcoy Provisional School. In 1898, it was renamed Hopetoun Provisional School. In 1907, it became Hopetoun State School. In 1914, it was renamed  Kilcoy State School.\nBrighton Hills Provisional School opened circa November 1904 and closed circa July 1918. It was described as \"via Kilcoy\".\n20th century\nKilcoy Methodist Church was built from timber by Mr C. Festers. It was opened on Saturday 14 October 1905 by the Reverend  William Henry Harrison, President of the Methodist Conference. In 1977, following the amalgamation of the Methodist Church into the Uniting Church in Australia, it became the Kilcoy Uniting Church. It closed on 28 February 2021. It was on a  site at 74 William Street ().\nIn 1908, the post office name was changed from Hopetoun to Kilcoy, to avoid incorrect mail distribution to other towns of the same name in Victoria and Western Australia.\nSt Michael's Roman Catholic Church was built in 1911 from timber.

The dam is situated on the Stanley River approximately  upstream from the mouth of the Brisbane River.  Construction of the Somerset Dam created many jobs, one of the project's intentions as it commence during the Great Depression.\nIn 1953, the Kilcoy Pastoral Company established an abattoir in the town.\nThe Jinibara people were granted Native Title by the Federal Court of Australia in 2012. The application used a series of tape recordings made in the 1950s of Aboriginal man, Gaiarbau, (also known as Willie MacKenzie) that provided detailed understandings of Aboriginal culture in southeast Queensland. Gaiabau was born at Kilcoy in the 1870s and died  in a Salvation Army Home in Brisbane and was buried on 24 June 1968 in Mt Gravatt Cemetery.\nIn the 1960s, road transport ensured the demise of the railway line (1964) and the old Kilcoy railway yard was converted many years later into a park known as Yowie Park.\nIn January 1963, a secondary department was added to Kilcoy State School.
