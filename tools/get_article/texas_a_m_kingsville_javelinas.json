The javelina serves as the mascot representing the teams, and the school colors are blue and gold.\nHistory\nTexas A&M–Kingsville has a rich and storied sports history. From the establishment of the university as \"South Texas State Teachers College\" in 1925, the university embraced athletic competition. That year, the students of the school chose the javelina as a mascot – the only college or university in the world to do so. After suffering an attack by one of the three mascots on the campus in 1929, the school's first president, Dr. Robert Cousins, stated that the creature stands for a symbol of the character of the school's students.\nThe first varsity letters were awarded to 15 members of the Javelina football team in December 1925. By the time of the school's first name change (to \"Texas College of Arts and Industries\") in 1929, the school participated in a wide array of sports, including football, baseball, men and women's basketball, and men and women's track and field.\nToday, the school competes in 11 NCAA varsity sports, and has gained recognition around the country for its ability to compete on a regional and national level. The school has a rich history of athletes who have moved on to national and international competition in the Olympic Games, as well as various professional sport leagues.\nSports\nTexas A&M–Kingsville (TAMUK) competes in 13 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football and track & field; while women's sports include basketball, beach volleyball, cross country, golf, softball, tennis, track & field and volleyball.\nThe university also offers various club and intramural sports. Participation in these activities by individual students and clubs in the university is highly encouraged.\nFootball\nin action against the Texas A&M–Commerce Lions in 2014]]\nSince the school was established 1925, football has been the most popular sport on campus.\nIn early 1929, the school joined the original Texas Intercollegiate Athletic Association (TIAA). By the time the TIAA folded, the \"Fighting Javelinas\" had won two football championships. Following this, the school competed independently for several years. They moved from competing with junior colleges and teachers' colleges to competing against larger schools throughout the state. One highlight of this period included a football game that pitted the Javelinas against the Aggies of Texas A&M at Kyle Field in College Station. The Javelinas led the game until the Aggies tied it at 14 with three minutes left to play. The game ended in a tie. However, the Javelinas demonstrated that they could hold their own with a large football powerhouse. This further substantiated the team's nickname as \"the toughest little team in the nation.\"\nIn 1934, the school participated in the Lone Star Conference on a probationary period. In 1935, the school joined the Alamo Conference. By 1937, the Javelinas captured their first Alamo Conference co-championship (with St. Mary's). The next year, the Javelinas won their first outright Alamo Conference football championship. This led to a string of football championships and the school's recognition as a football powerhouse.\nFor the 1954 season, A&I was finally inducted into the Lone Star Conference (LSC). By 1959, the Javelinas won the first in a long string of LSC championships. Since then, the school has remained a perennial conference powerhouse, winning 27 championships. During the years that the LSC was a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), the Javelinas also picked up seven national championships. During the 1970s, the Javelinas won five NAIA national championships and went undefeated from the last game of 1973 through third game of 1977.\nAfter the LSC joined the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division II in 1980, the Javelinas continued their conference, regional, and national success. Just a year after the university changed its name to Texas A&M University–Kingsville, the Javelinas played in the 1994 NCAA Division II National Football Championship, only to lose to the University of North Alabama by a score of 16–10. While an NCAA D2 national championship remains elusive, the Javelinas continuously remained nationally ranked football team poised to challenge for an elusive title.\nThe success of the Javelina Football team has led many writers and recruiters to dub the school a \"football factory\". More than 150 athletes from Javelina football teams have gone on to play professional football, and more than 50 of these were draft picks in the NFL draft – more than any other school in either the NAIA or NCAA Division II. As a result, many athletes choose to play for Texas A&M University–Kingsville simply for the opportunity to shine on a national stage.\nBaseball and softball\nin 2018]]\nBaseball began as a competitive team sport at the school in 1926. As the national pastime, it was immediately popular among students, faculty, and administration. Unfortunately, the vast distance between schools and the limited number of teams with baseball] programs made justifying the enormous cost to the new school difficult. To much chagrin, the school discontinued the program in 1930.\nIn 1990, athletic director and Javelina Football Coach Ron Harms announced that the university would re-establish a baseball team after more than 60 years. In 1992,  pitcher Nolan Ryan and a local rancher named Frank Horlock established a fund to build a baseball stadium on the campus. A year later, Ryan and Horlock, along with NFL coaching legend Bum Phillips, actor Larry Hagman, and other celebrities, attended a gala event with around 350 guests that established the funds necessary to build the stadium.\nIn 1993, the Javelinas of the newly renamed Texas A&M University–Kingsville\" began competing with other LSC teams in NCAA Division II baseball. A year later, the school christened the 4,000-seat stadium as Nolan Ryan Field in honor of the Texas pitching legend's efforts to build the stadium.\nIn addition, Texas A&M University–Kingsville established a competitive softball team in 1993. Within a four years, the popular sport was able to build a stadium of its own. In 1997, the Lady Javelinas softball team opened the stadium with a win against Incarnate Word. By 2001, the team set NCAA Division II records in softball attendance.\nSince the establishment of softball and the reestablishment of baseball, the programs have experienced fantastic success. Both teams have made deep runs in the NCAA Division II tournaments while gaining regional and national exposure.\nFacilities\n* Baseball – Nolan Ryan Field\n* Basketball – Hampton Inn Court at the Steinke Physical Education Center\n* Football – Javelina Stadium\n* Golf – L.E.
