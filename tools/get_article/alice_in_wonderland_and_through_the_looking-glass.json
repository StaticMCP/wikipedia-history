      "text": "# Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass\n\nAlice in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass is a 2001 stage adaptation of Lewis Carroll's 1865 novel ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and the 1871 novel Through the Looking-Glass.'' It was written by Adrian Mitchell. A 2 hour adaptation of both of Carroll's novels, it holds the distinction for currently being the most comprehensive stage adaptation of the books yet made, with the endings of both novels intact and only minor changes made for theatrical staging reasons.\nPlay inception\nMitchell's adaptation originated as a commission from the Royal Shakespeare Company. In his version, Mitchell uses a fictionalized version of the biographically famous \"Golden Afternoon\" on the 4th of July 1862, when Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) first told the stories that would become the Alice novels to his friend Canon Robinson Duckworth and the Liddell children, Alice, Lorina, and Edith. Dodgson wrote the stories down, and much later, presented the manuscript of Alice's adventures Underground to Alice Liddell in November 1864.\nMain characters and cast members\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The Guardian thought it faithful to Carroll's text, but called it a game of two halves, Wonderland working well enough, but that Looking-Glass went \"off the boil.\"\nRevivals\nThe play received a significant revival at the Chichester Festival Theatre in 2010 by the Youth Theatre. This revival, unlike its premiere, received more positive reviews, the Angus noting Emily Dyble's \"delightful\" performance as Alice. The 2022 revival by ARTComedia and Jersey Arts centre also received a positive response, with the Bailwick Express Jersey observing \"The sheer scale of the madness played out over the two hours beggars any kind of coherent description, as it should.\"\nReferences"
