The award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue.\nAs of 2025, Ukraine has submitted eighteen films, but none of them were nominated.\nPrior to its independence, Ukrainian film Wartime Romance was selected by the Soviet Union in 1984.\nSubmissions\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award.\nIn 2004, A Driver for Vera was disqualified for being a majority-Russian production. The film was largely shot in Ukraine, and was a co-production between Russian and Ukrainian production companies, but the film was made in Russian by a Russian writer-director (Pavlo Chukhrai, who represented Russia in this category and won an Oscar nomination in 1997) and five of the six top-billed actors were Russian. In 2006, a Columbia University film professor alleged that Ukraine's selection process was opaque, and that cancer drama Aurora had never actually screened in accordance with AMPAS rules. Despite the protest, Aurora was accepted and screened.\nIn 2007, it was rumored that Ukraine would finally form a special Oscar committee to annually choose a Ukrainian nominee and that supposedly the movie \"Koroliova\" would be selected in 2007 as Ukraine's Oscar representative. However, eventually it was revealed that the committee did not meet to choose a nominee.\nIn 2014, Ukraine's decision to submit Oles Sanin's The Guide ahead of the more acclaimed festival hit The Tribe by Myroslav Slaboshpytskyi, sparked a controversy that resulted in accusations of collusion by several members of the country's selection committee, who were forced to step down.\nIn 2015, Ukraine missed the deadline to submit a film. They requested an extension from the Academy but it was denied.\nBelow is a list of the films that have been submitted by Ukraine for review by the Academy for the award by year and the respective Academy Awards ceremony.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!
