Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. As Germany was divided following World War II, West and East Germany ratified the convention separately, the former on 23 August 1976 and the latter on 12 December 1988. With German reunification, East Germany was dissolved on 3 October 1990.\nGermany has 55 sites on the list, with a further seven on the tentative list. The first site listed was the Aachen Cathedral in 1978. The most recent addition took place in 2025. Three sites are natural and 52 are listed for their cultural significance. Germany holds the third-highest number of World Heritage Sites in the world, after Italy and China with 61 and 60 sites, respectively, and the second most in terms of cultural significance. The Dresden Elbe Valley, which was listed as endangered in July 2006, was eventually delisted in June 2009, making it one of the only three sites in the world to have been removed from the World Heritage Site register. Cologne Cathedral was listed as endangered from 2006 to 2008 due to plans to construct high-rise buildings nearby that would threaten the integrity of the property. Nine sites are shared with other countries.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\"| Site\n! class=\"unsortable\"  style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\"| Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\"| Location (state)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Aachen Cathedral\n|\n| North Rhine-Westphalia\n| 1978\n| 3bis; i, ii, iv, vi (cultural)\n| Constructed under the rule of Charlemagne between 793 and 813 during the Carolingian Renaissance and becoming his burial place when he died in 814, the cathedral's Palatine Chapel became the first vaulted structure built since antiquity. Strongly influenced by Classical and Byzantine architecture, it in turn became the inspiration for numerous churches of the Middle Ages. Until 1531, the cathedral served as the place where German kings were crowned. A minor boundary modification took place in 2013.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Speyer Cathedral\n|\n| Rhineland-Palatinate\n| 1981\n| 168; ii (cultural)\n| The cathedral of Speyer was founded in 1030 by Conrad II and reconstructed at the end of the 11th century by Henry IV. One of the most significant examples of Romanesque architecture in Europe, it influenced the development of architecture in the 11th and 12th centuries. It served as a burial place of German emperors for almost 300 years. It was seriously damaged by fire in 1689. The restoration works in the 18th century, closely following the original structure, are one of the earliest examples of monument preservation in Europe.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Würzburg Residence with the Court Gardens and Residence Square\n|\n| Bavaria\n| 1981\n| 169bis; i, iv (cultural)\n| The large and ornate Baroque palace, one of the largest in Germany, was created under the patronage of the prince-bishops Lothar Franz and Friedrich Carl von Schönborn. Completed in 1744 with decorations and gardens added in the following decades, the complex is the work of some of the most prominent European architects and artists of the period, including the chief architect Balthasar Neumann and the Venetian painter Tiepolo who created the frescoes in the staircases and on the walls of the Imperial Hall. A minor boundary modification took place in 2010.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Pilgrimage Church of Wies\n|\n| Bavaria\n| 1983\n| 271bis; i, iii (cultural)\n| Constructed in 1745–54 in an Alpine valley to attract pilgrims following an alleged miracle at the site, the church is the work of architect Dominikus Zimmermann and is a masterpiece of the Bavarian Rococo.

It grew into a major town and became one of the capitals of the Tetrarchy at the end of the 3rd century, also nicknamed \"the second Rome\".  Many of the Roman era structures are still standing, including the Porta Nigra (pictured). The Cathedral is the oldest church in Germany, being built on the ruins of Roman buildings with parts in Romanesque and later styles. The Church of Our Lady was built in the French High Gothic style.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Hanseatic City of Lübeck\n|\n| Schleswig-Holstein\n| 1987\n| 272bis; iv (cultural)\n| Founded in the 12th century, Lübeck was the trading capital of the influential Hanseatic League, which monopolised trade in much of Northern Europe until the 16th century. Although a fifth of the city, including several important monuments, was entirely destroyed in World War II, several of the original buildings remain. These include the residences from the 15th and 16th centuries, the Holsten gate (pictured), churches, and the salt storehouses. A minor boundary modification took place in 2009.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin\n|\n| Berlin, Brandenburg\n| 1990\n| 532ter; i, ii, iv (cultural)\n| The cultural landscape with palaces, gardens, artificial villages, villas, and other buildings from the 18th and 19th centuries was created for Prussian monarchs by a series of landscape architects from different countries, resulting in an eclectic mixture of styles. After the inscription, additional areas were added to the site in 1992 and 1999. The Sanssouci palace is pictured.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Abbey and Altenmünster of Lorsch\n|\n| Hesse\n| 1991\n| 515bis; i, ii, iv (cultural)\n| The abbey was founded around 764 and served as a burial place for several kings of the Carolingian dynasty, starting with Louis the German who died in 876. The gatehouse (pictured) is one of the rare buildings that preserve most of the original look from the Carolingian Renaissance, including the sculptures and paintings. The rest of the monastery saw several renovations after a fire in 1090.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mines of Rammelsberg, Historic Town of Goslar and Upper Harz Water Management System\n|\n| Lower Saxony\n| 1992\n| 623ter; i, ii, iii, iv (cultural)\n| The Rammelsberg mountain is rich in silver, copper, and lead ore. Mining started on a smaller scale in the Middle Ages and then on a large scale between the 16th and 19th centuries. The town of Goslar (pictured) profited from it and was an important part of the Hanseatic League. The Medieval city centre with its timber-framed houses is well preserved. The water management system of the Upper Harz region was added to the site in 2010, to highlight the technological innovation in using water to assist the mining process.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Maulbronn Monastery Complex\n|\n| Baden-Württemberg\n| 1993\n| 546bis; ii, iv (cultural)\n| The Cistercian monastery was founded in 1147, with main buildings constructed between the 12th and 16th centuries. The church was built in a style that transitioned from Romanesque to Gothic architecture and was influential in the spread of the Gothic style in central and northern Europe. The monastery complex is one of the best preserved Cistercian complexes in Europe. An important feature is its water management system, with reservoirs, drains, and irrigation channels.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Town of Bamberg\n|\n| Bavaria\n| 1993\n| 624; ii, iv (cultural)\n| Bamberg became the seat of a bishopric in 1007. The medieval layout of the city is well preserved, with its medieval and Baroque buildings, both secular and ecclesiastical. The layout and the architecture influenced the development of towns in central Europe from the 11th century on. In the late 18th century it became a center of the Age of Enlightenment when philosophers Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and E. T. A. Hoffmann settled in the town. The old town hall is pictured.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Collegiate Church, Castle, and Old Town of Quedlinburg\n|\n| Saxony-Anhalt\n| 1994\n| 535rev; iv (cultural)\n| An influential and prosperous trading centre during the early Middle Ages, Quedlinburg became a center of influence under the Ottonian dynasty in the 10th and 11th centuries. The Romanesque Collegiate Church, completed in 1129, is an important example of the period style, together with architectural details, tombs, and murals. The town saw another peak following the end of the Thirty Years' War. In the 17th century, numerous high-quality timber-framed houses were built, giving the town its present-day look.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Völklingen Ironworks\n|\n| Saarland\n| 1994\n| 687; iv (cultural)\n| The ironworks operated until 1986 to produce pig iron. They illustrate the industrial history of Saarland, with its heavy industries, as well as numerous technological innovations developed there. They are the only intact remaining ironworks from the period of late 19th century and early 20th century in western Europe, as the last modifications to the complex were carried out in the 1930s.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Messel Pit Fossil Site\n|\n| Hesse\n| 1994\n| 720bis; viii (natural)\n| A former oil shale mine, the Messel pit is the world's richest fossil site for Eocene mammals. The fossils date from 47 to 48 million years ago and provide insight into the evolution of mammals, with remarkably well-preserved skeletons, skin, and even stomach content. This allowed for example a study of development of echolocation in bats. Fossils of primates, birds, insects, as well as plants have been found on site.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Bauhaus and its Sites in Weimar, Dessau and Bernau\n|\n| Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia, Brandenburg\n| 1996\n| 729bis; ii, iv, vi (cultural)\n| Founded in 1919 in Weimar by Walter Gropius, the Bauhaus was the most influential art school of the 20th century.

Twelve buildings and ensembles are listed, Schloss Weimar is pictured.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Museumsinsel (Museum Island), Berlin\n|\n| Berlin\n| 1998\n| 896; ii, iv (cultural)\n| Museum Island comprises five museums built between 1824 and 1930. Each of the museums was designed in line with the collection it was going to host. The collections themselves trace the development of human civilization, with culture, art, and archaeology. The site also illustrates the development of modern museums through time. The Bode Museum is pictured.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Wartburg Castle\n|\n| Thuringia\n| 1999\n| 897; ii, iv (cultural)\n| The castle, situated on a hill above Eisenach, is an outstanding example of a castle from the feudal period, even if only some medieval parts remain and the majority of today's structure dates to the 19th century. During his exile, Martin Luther translated the New Testament into German while staying at the castle.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Garden Kingdom of Dessau-Wörlitz\n|\n| Saxony-Anhalt\n| 2000\n| 534bis; ii, iv (cultural)\n| The parks, gardens, and buildings were created for Leopold III, Duke of Anhalt-Dessau in the 18th century and were inspired by the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment. Important buildings include the Schloss Wörlitz (pictured), the first Neoclassical building in Germany, and the Gothic House which inspired the Gothic revival.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Monastic Island of Reichenau\n|\n| Baden-Württemberg\n| 2000\n| 974; iii, iv, vi (cultural)\n| A Benedictine abbey, the Reichenau Abbey, was founded on the island on the Lake Constance in 724, and traces are preserved today. Between 9th and 11th centuries, three churches were built, during the Carolingian, Ottonian and Salian dynasties when the monastery was an important centre for arts and culture. The ensemble illustrates early monastic architecture in central Europe. The wall paintings in the Church of St. George (pictured) are the only preserved pre-1000 scenic paintings north of the Alps.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Zollverein Coal Mine Industrial Complex\n|\n| North Rhine-Westphalia\n| 2001\n| 975; ii, iii (cultural)\n| This site preserves a coal mining complex, representative of an important industry in Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries. In addition to the technical heritage, depicting all stages of coal mining, including the pits, coking plants, railways, residential buildings for miners, and other facilities, the buildings of Shaft 12 are distinguished from an architectural point of view. They were designed by Fritz Schupp and Martin Kemmer in the 1920s in the Bauhaus style and are thus important buildings of the modern architecture.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Upper Middle Rhine Valley\n|\n| Rhineland-Palatinate, Hesse\n| 2002\n| 1066; ii, iv, v (cultural)\n| The cultural landscape, stretching  along Middle Rhine between Bingen and Koblenz, has been shaped by two millennia of trade interactions between the Mediterranean and the north. There are around 40 hilltop forts and castles along the river, some of which were renovated in the 19th century during the Romanticism movement, when the area served as an inspiration to writers and artists. Katz Castle with the Lorelei rock is pictured.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Historic Centres of Stralsund and Wismar\n|\n| Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania\n| 2002\n| 1067; ii, iv (cultural)\n| The two towns on the Baltic coast were important centres of the Hanseatic League in the 14th and 15th centuries.

The sites, which comprise the Jewish Cemetery in Worms, Worms Synagogue, Jewish courtyard in Speyer (pictured), and the Old Jewish Cemetery in Mainz, were influential in the architecture of Jewish communities in Germany, northern France, and England.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Jewish-Medieval Heritage of Erfurt\n|\n| Thuringia\n| 2023\n| 1656; iv (cultural)\n| This site comprises three buildings related to the Medieval Jewish community of Erfurt. The Old Synagogue (pictured) was first built in the late 11th century and twice rebuilt, the large and prestigious building from around 1270 incorporated some parts of the previous structures. Following a pogrom in 1349, the building was used for other purposes until the late 20th century when its original function was rediscovered and renovations took place. The remains of a mikveh, a Jewish ritual bath from around 1250, were discovered in 2007. The third building is the secular Stone House from mid-13th century.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#D0E7FF;\"| Moravian Church Settlements*\n|\n| Saxony\n| 2024\n| iii, iv (cultural)\n| The settlements of the Moravian Church, a Protestant denomination, from the second half of the 18th century are planned cities, reflecting the egalitarian philosophy of the community. They share similar urban layouts, including open and green spaces, a congregational building, cemetery, sanctuary, and houses for communal living, separated by age, gender, and marital status. Christiansfeld in Denmark has been listed as a World Heritage Site in 2015. In 2024 the site was extended to include the Historic Moravian Bethlehem District in the United States, Herrnhut (pictured) in Germany, and Gracehill in the United Kingdom.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Residence Ensemble Schwerin – Cultural Landscape of Romantic Historicism\n|\n| Mecklenburg-Vorpommern\n| 2024\n| iii, iv (cultural)\n| The castle, located on an island in Lake Schwerin, was first documented as a Slavic fort in the 10th century and rebuilt several times. It got its present look in the mid-19th century when it was extensively remodeled in line with the ideas of Romantic historicism. The cultural landscape also comprises parks, gardens, and various buildings that illustrate the last flourishing of court culture in the 19th century.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | The Palaces of King Ludwig II of Bavaria: Neuschwanstein, Linderhof, Schachen and Herrenchiemsee\n|\n| Bavaria\n| 2025\n| 1726; iv (cultural)\n| This site comprises three ensembles and a small villa commissioned by Ludwig II of Bavaria in the second half of the 19th century. Nicknamed the \"fairy-tale king\", the politically powerless Ludwig II wanted to recreate places from far away or from distant past. The Neuschwanstein castle (pictured) was inspired by the operas of Richard Wagner, the Herrenchiemsee by Versailles, and the Linderhof Palace both by Oriental buildings and by the world of Wagner. All three complexes were soon turned into museums, allowing for their near-complete preservation.\n|-\n|}\nTentative list\nIn addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list.

Sephardic Sepulchral Culture of the 17th and 18th century between Europe and the Caribbean\n|\n| Hamburg\n| 2015\n| iii, iv, vi (cultural)\n| The Jewish cemetery in Hamburg dates to the early 17th century. It has a section that was used by the local Ashkenazi community and one used by the Sephardic Jews who emigrated from Portugal to northern Europe. The latter were for generations prevented from practicing their traditions so they developed a distinct sepulchral art and culture, different than that in the Iberian Peninsula and also different from that of the Jews who migrated to other areas. Some 1,600 tombstones have been preserved. Some tombstones carved in Hamburg were sent to communities in other countries, even to the Caribbean.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Alpine and pre-alpine meadow and marsh landscapes (historic anthropogenic landscapes in the area of \"Werdenfelser Land\", \"Ammergau\", \"Staffelseegebiet\" and \"Murnauer Moos\", district Garmisch-Partenkirchen)\n|\n| Bavaria\n| 2015\n| v (cultural)\n| This nomination comprises four areas with Alpine and pre-alpine meadows around Garmisch-Partenkirchen that have been managed since at least the Middle Ages.

Murnauer Moos is pictured.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Luther memorials in Saxony-Anhalt, Saxony, Bavaria and Thuringia\n|\n| Bavaria, Saxony-Anhalt, Saxony, Thuringia\n| 2015\n| iv, vi (cultural)\n| This is a proposed expansion of the Luther memorials site in Eisleben and Wittenberg, originally listed in 1996. It lists additional twelve sites connected to Martin Luther and the Reformation in Mansfeld, Torgau, Coburg, and Erfurt. St. Augustine's Monastery in Erfurt is pictured.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Torgau Castle Chapel\n|\n| Saxony\n| 2024\n| ii, iv, vi (cultural)\n| This chapel located in Hartenfels Castle, Torgau, represents the transition from the traditional medieval castle chapels to early modern designs influenced by the Reformation. As it is the only church built according Martin Luther's considerations, the chapel's interior reflects Lutheran ideas.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Green Belt\n|\n| Bavaria, Brandenburg, Hesse, Lower Saxony, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Schleswig-Holstein, Thuringia\n| 2024\n| ix, x (natural)\n| The Green Belt is a continuous stretch of green land along the former Iron Curtain. This 1,393&nbsp;km long area connects multiple natural areas in Germany, thus being a successful example of battling fragmentation of habitats. In addition, many endangered species have settled in the area.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Olympic Park Munich\n|\n| Bavaria\n| 2024\n| i, ii, iv (cultural)\n| This park was built for the 1972 Summer Olympics and now continues its function as a sports center.

These spears are the oldest known hunting weapons and reflect the technological development, behavior, and lifeways of the hunter-gatherers.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | The Television Tower Stuttgart. Archetype and symbol of modern mass communication\n|\n| Baden-Württemberg\n| 2024\n| ii, iv (cultural)\n| It is the first telecommunications tower in the world, thus acting as a prototype for similar structures that have become common worldwide with the spread of television in the 20th century. This tower is also a significant engineering achievement, as it involved new methods of construction to withstand strong wind.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Waldsiedlung Zehlendorf - extension of the WHS \"Berlin Modernism Housing Estates\"\n|\n| Berlin\n| 2024\n| ii, iv (cultural)\n| This proposed extension covers the modernist residential Waldsiedlung neighborhood built in 1926–1932. Different trees were planted throughout the neighborhood, bringing together the numerous different-colored buildings. As Waldsiedlung was connected to the U-Bahn from its construction and was built to include shops and a cinema, it demonstrates the appearance of an encompassing approach of residential area building.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#D0E7FF;\" |European Paper Mills (from the era of hand-made paper)*\n|\n|Bavaria, Saxony\n|2024\n|ii, iii, iv\n(cultural)\n|This transnational nomination comprises six 16th–18th century paper mills that show the importance of Europe in paper production.
