It was released in France on October 4, 2007, and in the United States on August 12, 2008. It was developed by White Birds Productions, a company founded and led by Benoît Sokal.\nDevelopment\nThe title's genesis came from Olivier Fontenay, who suggested that Benoît Sokal make police games. Sokal wrote a ten-page draft in 2005. He decided to have a male playable character to offer a change from his Syberia series. The team created a new interface for the game, entitled  PPA (Personal Police Assistant). The game was supported by the Centre National de la Cinématographie. A sequel was originally going to be released, offering a second Jack Norm adventure set in New York.\nPlot\nThe plot is centered on the investigation of the death of a millionaire named Walter Jones. The main acting character in the game is Jack Norm, a police officer entrusted with the task of solving the mystery. The events take place on a fictional island owned by the late Walter Jones in an Art Deco-style tower. The plot takes place over three days and follows a classic murder mystery scheme where a detective needs to uncover the identity of the murderer.\nCritical reception\n|4P = 59%\n|AdvGamers =\n|Gamekult = 4/10\n|GStar = 68%\n|Gamezebo = 70/100\n|GameZone = 6.5/10\n|IGN = 6.5/10\n|JXV = 15/20\n}}\nThe game received \"average\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. 4Players reviewer Bodo Naser thought that while the game promised a murder mystery akin to those of Agatha Christie, the title did not deliver. IGN offered a mixed review, describing the game as having \"weary, stranded-island sleuthing at its soggiest\". GameSpots hands-on preview thought the game would appeal to adventure fans. Gamekult derided the game's difficult puzzles, sleep-inducing dialogue, and lack of plot momentum.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071030150410/http://www.microids.com/en/catalogue/47/sinking-island.html Sinking Island] at [http://www.microids.com/ Microïds]\n*\n*"
