It was formed in the summer of 1916 and remained in existence until after the end of the war, being disbanded in 1919 during the general demobilization of the German Army.\nFormation and structure\nThe division was established on 17 August 1916 as part of the sixth wave of new divisions raised by the Imperial German Army. Its original structure included:\n* 400th Infantry Brigade (400. Infanterie-Brigade)\n** Infantry Regiment No. 401 (Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 401)\n** Infantry Regiment No. 402 (Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 402)\n** Infantry Regiment No. 403 (Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 403)\n* 3rd Squadron, Saxon Reserve Hussar Regiment No. 1 (3. Eskadron/Sächsisches Reserve-Husaren-Regiment Nr. 1)\n* Artillery Commander 200 (Artillerie-Kommandeur 200)\n* Foot Artillery Battalion No. 87 (Fußartillerie-Bataillon Nr. 87)\n* Pioneer Battalion No. 200 (Pionier-Bataillon Nr. 200)\nInitially, the division was composed mostly of replacement and training units from across Germany, making it somewhat less cohesive compared to older divisions.\nCombat history\nThe 200th Infantry Division spent much of its existence on the Eastern Front.\nAfter its formation, the division was deployed to Romania as part of Feldmarschall August von Mackensen's forces during the Romanian campaign. It participated in the Battle of the Argeș and the subsequent occupation of southern Romania.\nFollowing the stabilization of the Eastern Front and the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in 1918, the division was transferred to the Western Front. There, it served in a quiet sector along the Aisne River during the final months of the war and was not engaged in any major offensives.\nAccording to Allied intelligence, the division was rated as a third-class formation, primarily due to its relatively late formation, lower cohesion, and limited combat experience on the Western Front.\nCommanders\n* Generalleutnant Ernst von Below (notable commander)\nFate\nAfter the armistice of November 1918, the division was withdrawn to Germany, where it was disbanded in 1919 as part of the demobilization of the Imperial German Army.\nSee also\n* German Army (German Empire)\n* List of Divisions of the Imperial German Army\nReferences\n* [http://www.1914-18.info/erster-weltkrieg.php?u=195 200.
