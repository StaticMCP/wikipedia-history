It is composed of discussions and examples of offensive and defensive strategies from a wide variety of people and conditions, applying them to social conflicts such as family quarrels and business negotiations.\nReception\nThe Independent said Greene has set himself up as \"a modern-day Machiavelli\" but that \"it is never clear whether he really believes what he writes or whether it is just his shtick, an instrument of his will to shift £20 hardbacks\" and concludes \"There is something less than adult about it all.\" Admiral James G. Stavridis said the book had good breadth, but it lacked depth. Leadership theorist and author John Adair said Greene \"shows a poor grasp of the subject\" and the book is based on the flawed \"assumption that the art of military strategy and the art of living are comparable\". Booklist said the book was repetitive, lacked a sense of humor, and had an annoying \"quasi-spiritual tone\". NBA player Chris Bosh stated that his favorite book is The 33 Strategies of War. The book has been banned by several US prisons.\nThe book was described by one reviewer as having \"far too many duff sentences\", such: \"Your goal is to blend philosophy and war, wisdom and battle, into an unbeatable blend.\" It has sold more than 200,000 copies.\nSee also\n* The 48 Laws of Power\n* On War\n* The Art of War\n* The Book of Five Rings\n* Thirty-Six Stratagems\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://robertgreene.net/the-33-strategies-of-war.html 33 Strategies of War]  interview featuring Robert Greene"
