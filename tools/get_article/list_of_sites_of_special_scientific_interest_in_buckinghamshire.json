This ceremonial county has two Unitary Authorities, Buckinghamshire Council and Milton Keynes Council.\nIn England, Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) are designated by Natural England, which is responsible for protecting England's natural environment. Designation as an SSSI gives legal protection to the most important wildlife and geological sites. As of April 2016, there are 65 SSSIs in this Area of Search, 55 of which have been designated for biological interest and 10 for geological interest. Thirty are in the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, three are in national nature reserves, four are in Special Areas of Conservation, and seventeen are managed by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust.\nSites\nKey\n{|\n|-\n| valign=top width=\"34%\" |\n*Interest\n**B = site of biological interest\n**G = site of geological interest\n*Public access\n**FP = Access only to a footpath across the site\n**No = no public access to site\n**PP = public access to part of site\n**Yes = public access to site\n| valign=top width=\"38%\" |\n*Other classifications\n**BBOWT = Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust\n**CAONB = Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty\n**FC = Forestry Commission\n**GCR = Geological Conservation Review\n**HMWT = Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust\n**LNR = Local nature reserve\n**LB = Listed building\n| valign=top width=\"28%\" |\n* (continued)\n**MKPT = Milton Keynes Parks Trust\n**NCR = A Nature Conservation Review\n**NNR = National nature reserve\n**NT = National Trust\n**SAC = Special Area of Conservation\n**SM = Scheduled monument\n**WT = Woodland Trust\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n!  scope=\"col\" | Site name\n!  scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"  | Photograph\n!  scope=\"col\" |\n!  scope=\"col\" |\n!  scope=\"col\" | Area\n!  scope=\"col\" | Public access\n!  scope=\"col\" | Location\n!  scope=\"col\" |Other classifications\n!  scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Map\n!  scope=\"col\"  class=\"unsortable\" | Citation\n!  scope=\"col\"  class=\"unsortable\" |Description\n|-\n| Ashridge Commons and Woods\n|\n| align=\"center\" |\n|\n|\n|align=\"center\" |YES\n| Ashridge\n|  CAONBNT\n| align=\"center\" |\n| [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051209/http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1000452.pdf Citation]\n|This site is mainly semi-natural vegetation, with has extensive areas of woodland, grass and scrub.
