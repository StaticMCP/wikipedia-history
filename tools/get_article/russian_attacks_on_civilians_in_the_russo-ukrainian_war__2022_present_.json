The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine says the Russian military exposed the civilian population to unnecessary and disproportionate harm by using cluster bombs and by firing other weapons with wide-area effects into civilian areas, such as missiles, heavy artillery shells and multiple launch rockets. As of 2025, the attacks had resulted in the UN-documented deaths of between 15,000 and estimated 40,000 dead civilians. On 22 April 2022, the UN reported that of the 2,343 civilian casualties it had been able to document, it could confirm 92.3% of these deaths were as a result of the actions of the Russian armed forces.\nOn 5 July 2022, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), Michelle Bachelet, reported that most civilian casualties documented by her office had been caused by the Russian army's use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects in populated areas, calling it \"indisputable\". By 30 June 2023, OHCHR assessed that 90.5% of all civilian deaths were caused by such indiscriminate attack, and that 84.2% of them were recorded in Ukrainian-held territory.  estimated that by March 2023 the Russian forces were firing at a rate of between 600,000 and 1.8 million shells per month. By February 2024, Russia had fired between 12 and 17 million artillery shells against Ukraine. By the end of 2023, Russian forces launched about 7,400 missiles and 3,900 Shahed drone strikes against Ukraine according to Ukrainian military officials.\nReports on the use of cluster bombs raised concerns about the high number of civilian casualties and the long-lasting danger of unexploded ordnance. According to the OHCHR, cluster bombs have been used by Russian armed forces and pro-Russian separatists in densely populated areas, resulting in civilian casualties.\nBombing of Chernihiv\nOn 3 March 2022, just after 12:00 (UTC+2), six Russian unguided aerial bombs were filmed falling in a residential area in Chernihiv. Analysis by Amnesty International found that (at least) eight bombs fell. Two schools (No.18 and No.21) and 8 private houses in the intersection between the Viacheslava Chornovila and Kruhova streets () were destroyed, 7 more houses were also heavily damaged in the vicinity of the Biloruskyi Lane. Local emergency services recorded 38 men and 9 women killed (47 in total) by the bombing and 18 people injured. As Amnesty International was unable to identify a legitimate military target nearby, it said the attack could be a war crime. Human Rights Watch (HRW) found no evidence of a \"significant [military] target in or near the intersection when it was hit ... pointing to a potentially deliberate or reckless indiscriminate attack\". HRW called for an International Criminal Court investigation and a United Nations commission of inquiry to decide if a war crime had occurred and to hold to account the people responsible. The HRW investigation included telephone interviews with three witnesses and two other Chernihiv residents, and analysis of 22 videos and 12 photographs. The witnesses interviewed by HRW stated that they were unaware of military targets or operations in the neighbourhood. Matilda Bogner, Head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, stated that the bombing \"violated the principles of distinction, of proportionality, the rule on feasible precautions and the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks\". A bomb crater consistent with a 500&nbsp;kg bomb was found. FAB-500 bombs were known to be used during the invasion.\nOn 16 March 2022, a Russian attack killed 14 civilians who were waiting in a line for bread in the city, The event was reported by Governor of Chernihiv Oblast Vyacheslav Chaus and the United States Embassy in Kyiv. The incident happened at around 10:00 UTC+3. Victims of the incident were killed following a blast shot from heavy artillery. These civilians were unarmed and some of them survived the shelling; they were taken to medical facilities by the Chernihiv police. An American citizen was among the dead. Around four hours after the incident, the Chernihiv Regional Prosecutor's Office filed a legal case regarding the attack. The Chernihiv Oblast branch of the Security Service of Ukraine also started an investigation.\nOn 19 August 2023 at about 11:30 Saturday morning seven civilians were killed, dozens hospitalized, and over a 150 injured after Russian Armed Forces launched a 9М727 Iskander cruise missile and hit the Taras Shevchenko Music and Drama Theater at Krasna Square, the city center. The detonator of the warhead of the missile was configured for air detonation, so all the dead and the vast majority of the injured were from outside the drama theater. According to the acting mayor of the city, the military exhibition held in the building was the likely target. Early reporting indicated five people killed and 42 injured, including 11 children presumably among the injured. The estimates went up to 90 injured, including 25 hospitalized, and six dead after a six-year-old child died in the hospital, and then seven dead after another women's body was found.\nDnipropetrovsk Oblast\nOn 7 April 2022, there were three strikes on the oblast during the day.

Dnipro mayor Borys Filatov reported that city communications and infrastructure were not damaged. Governor Valentyn Reznichenko stated that due to the attack one woman was hospitalised in critical condition. The following day Reznichenko reported that a man was found dead under the rubble.

According to the local military administration, four people were killed and 14 were injured, including two children.\nOn 4 April 2025, Russia struck a dense residential area with a missile, spraying shrapnel which also hit a playground. The attack killed 20 people, 11 adults and nine children, and dozens of people were injured. According to Reuters, the strike, described as one of the deadliest attacks on civilians in months, jeopardised the US's push for a ceasefire in the war. The United Nations called the strike Russia's deadliest attack on Ukrainian children in the three years since the invasion started.\nChaplyne railway station strike\nOn 24 August 2022, the Independence Day of Ukraine, Russian forces struck Chaplyne, damaging a railway station, a utility building, and a residential neighborhood. Several passenger rail cars were set on fire and destroyed. Ukrainian sources described multiple rockets or missiles being used in several attacks. At least 25 people (including 2 children) died and about 31 were injured. The Russian defense ministry claimed it had targeted a military train using a single Iskander missile, and that the attack had killed 200 Ukrainian soldiers. According to an Associated Press reporter on site, there was no visible indication that Ukrainian soldiers were among the victims. International legal experts said that the attack might qualify as a war crime if civilians were the target.\nDnipro drone strikes\nOn 29 April 2025, regional governor Lysak said that Russia had launched a mass drone attack on Dnipro using Shahed drones, setting several homes on fire and killing one 53-year-old man.\nDonetsk Oblast\nThere were at least 7,395 civilian casualties (of which 3,511 killed) in the government-controlled territory of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and 2,035 civilian casualties (of which 467 killed) in the territory controlled by the Russian forces and affiliated groups between February and November 2022. The months-long siege of Mariupol caused a large number of civilian casualties and a few other attacks with many civilian casualties occurred in the oblast. Donetsk itself experienced several attacks with civilian casualties, including the shelling of a market and the mayor's office. Pro-Russian officials blamed Ukraine for the attacks while Ukraine blamed Russia or did not comment on the attacks.\nOn 8 August 2022 the UK Ministry of Defence issued a statement accusing Russia of using anti-personnel PFM-1 scatterable anti-personnel mines along the defensive lines in Donbas, adding that such mines are undiscriminate and pose a threat to civilians.\nVuhledar cluster bomb attack\nOn 24 February 2022, 10:30 (UTC), Vuhledar was attacked with an 9M79 Tochka missile, which landed next to a hospital and killed four civilians and injured ten. Amnesty International described it as \"irrefutable evidence of violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law\" by Russian forces. Human Rights Watch (HRW) found that the Vuhledar hospital attack used a 9N123 cluster munition. The 9N123 contains fifty 9N24 individual submunitions, which each split into 316 bomblets. HRW based its analysis on contacts with the hospital and municipal administrations and multiple photographic evidence. HRW called for Russian forces to stop making \"unlawful attacks with weapons that indiscriminately kill and maim\". The press secretary of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Peskov, denied Russian involvement, saying that this type of ammunition is used by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\nLyman cluster bomb attack\nOn 8 July 2023, Russian cluster bombs launched by a BM-30 Smerch struck a residential area of Lyman, in Donetsk Oblast. Nine civilians were killed and nineteen wounded. Witnesses said residents \"had gathered to trade dairy products and fresh produce from their gardens, as they did most mornings\". The use of cluster bombs in areas with civilians \"makes an attack indiscriminate, in violation of international humanitarian law\".\nSiege of Mariupol\nBetween 1–2 March 2022, Russian artillery reportedly shelled a densely populated neighbourhood in the city for nearly 15 hours, causing significant destruction. Deputy mayor Sergei Orlov reported that \"at least hundreds of people [were] dead.\" On 16 March the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported that Russian forces continued to commit war crimes in Mariupol including \"targeting civilian infrastructure\". On 18 March, Lieutenant General James Hockenhull, Chief of Defence Intelligence for the United Kingdom (UK), described \"continued targeting of civilians in Mariupol\". As of 20 March local authorities have estimated that at least 2,300 people were killed during the siege.\nOn 20 March 2022, Ukrainian authorities announced that Russian troops had bombed an art school in the city where hundreds (about 400) were sheltering. The Mariupol City Council made the announcement through the instant messaging service Telegram, highlighting that many of those sheltering in the school were women, children and elderly. However, Petro Andryushchenko, an advisor to the Mayor of Mariupol, raised the concern that there was no exact number on how many people were using the school as a refuge.\nBy 18 April, Ukrainian officials estimated that at least 95% of Mariupol had been destroyed in the fighting, largely as a result of the Russian bombing campaigns. City officials reported that up to 21,000 civilians had been killed. On 16 June, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said that evidence strongly suggests the Russian armed forces committed serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law in Mariupol, including the shelling and rocket attacks that destroyed much of the city. In a separate statement, Human Rights Watch said Russia's military tactics were indiscriminate and caused a disproportionate effect on the civilians in the city. It also warned that going forward, access to the city and preservation of evidence were likely to be issues, given Russia's occupation of the city, and it called for international accountability.\nIndependent media and the Ukrainian side accused the Russian military of bombing civilian shelters with cluster munitions during shelling of the city and attacks on Azovstal. According to the mayor of Mariupol, at the end of April, during the two-month siege of the city by Russian troops, more than 20 thousand people died - twice as many than the 2 year occupation of the city during World War II. Oksana Pokalchuk, director of Amnesty International Ukraine, said they were able to prove the use of cluster munitions by Russia after interviewing a victim who provided them with a fragment of ammunition that was removed from his thigh.\nTargeting of humanitarian corridors\nDuring shelling of Mariupol by Russian forces, a number of attempts to establish a humanitarian evacuation corridor to evacuate civilians from the city were made, but failed when the corridor was targeted by Russian forces. On 5 March, a five-hour ceasefire was declared, but evacuations were quickly halted after shelling continued during the declared time. The next day, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) announced that a second attempt to establish an evacuation corridor had failed.\nMariupol hospital airstrike\nOn 9 March 2022, the Children's and Maternity Hospital No. 3, a hospital complex functioning both as a children's hospital and maternity ward, was bombed several times by Russian forces during a ceasefire, killing at least four people and injuring at least seventeen, also leading to at least one stillbirth Ukrainian authorities described the damage to the hospital as \"colossal\". Video footage following the attacks showed \"much of the front of the building ... ripped away\" and \"mangled cars burning outside\". Hospital wards were \"reduced to a wreckage, walls [had] collapsed, rubble cover[ed] medical equipment, windows [were] blown out and shattered glass [was] everywhere\". On 10 March, local authorities stated that one girl and two other people had been killed in the bombing, one of whom was a woman at a late stage of pregnancy; neither she nor her unborn child survived. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that people had \"hidden\" from the attack in time, minimising the number of casualties.\nDeputy Mayor of Mariupol, Sergei Orlov, stated, \"We don't understand how it is possible in modern life to bomb [a] children's hospital.\" The Mariupol City Council described the bombing by Russian aircraft as deliberate. Zelenskyy claimed that the attack constituted \"proof that the genocide of Ukrainians [was] taking place\". Sergei Orlov, deputy mayor of Mariupol, described the attack as both a war crime and genocide. British prime minister Boris Johnson described the attack as \"depraved\". Jen Psaki, press secretary of United States president Joe Biden, stated that \"It is horrifying to see the ... barbaric use of military force to go after innocent civilians in a sovereign country.\" Josep Borrell, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, described the bombing as a \"heinous war crime\". Cardinal Secretary of State of the Vatican City Pietro Parolin expressed dismay at the bombing, calling it an \"unacceptable attack on civilians\". António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, wrote that the attack was \"horrific\" and that \"this senseless violence must stop.\"\nOn 10 March, the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence publicly claimed that the bombing was justified. According to Ukrainska Pravda, foreign minister Sergey Lavrov confirmed that the bombing of the hospital was a deliberate action. He stated, \"A few days ago, at a UN Security Council meeting, the Russian delegation presented factual information that this maternity hospital had long been taken over by the Azov Battalion and other radicals and that all the women in labour, all the nurses and in general all the staff had been told to leave it. It was a base of the ultra-radical Azov Battalion.\" On 10 March 2022, Twitter removed a tweet from the Russian embassy in the UK which claimed that the Mariupol hospital attack was \"fake\" and that Marianna Vyshegirskaya, one of the victims, was an \"actress\" by citing her blogging career, as a violation of Twitter rules. British politicians welcomed the move and accused the Russian embassy of disinformation. Meduza stated that the Russian representative to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenzya, had on 7 March referred to Maternity Hospital No 1 () as a hospital that he claimed was used by Ukrainian armed forces as a firing point, not Maternity Hospital No 3. Meduza described Lavrov as having confused Hospital No 1, referred to by Nebenzya, with the hospital that was bombed, Hospital No 3. On 22 March 2022, Russian journalist Alexander Nevzorov was charged under Russia's \"fake news\" law after he published information about the Russian shelling of a maternity hospital in Mariupol. Under a new law passed on 4 March, he could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison.\nMariupol theatre airstrike\nconducted by the Russian Armed Forces on 16 March 2022]]\nOn 16 March, Ukraine accused Russian forces of shelling civilian areas in Mariupol. Artillery hit numerous locations, including a swimming pool building and a vehicle convoy; shelling then struck the Donetsk Regional Drama Theatre that was being used as an air raid shelter with a large number of civilians inside, the building was reduced to rubble. The bomb shelter in the basement of the theatre survived the bombing, but many people were still trapped underneath the burning rubble. A member of the Ukrainian parliament from Mariupol, Dmytro Gurin, said that the rescue efforts were hampered due to continued attacks on the area by Russian forces.\nBy 17 March, the number of casualties was unclear; some emerged alive. By 18 March, around 130 survivors had been rescued. The Mariupol City Council stated that according to initial information, no one had been killed, although one person was gravely wounded. On 25 March, the council estimated that about 300 people had been killed as a result of the airstrike. On 4 May, Associated Press published an investigation with evidence pointing to 600 dead in the airstrike. Many survivors estimated around 200 people–including rescuers–escaping through the main exit or one side entrance; the other side and the back were crushed. Estimates of civilian deaths vary, ranging from at least a dozen (Amnesty International) to 600 (Associated Press). At least eleven are confirmed by a Russian source.\nUkraine accused the Russian Armed Forces of deliberately bombing the theatre while it was sheltering civilians. Russia first claimed that the reason the theatre was bombed was because it was \"being used as a base by the Ukrainian military\", and then denied the allegations and instead accused the Azov Battalion of blowing up the building, Both Russian claims have been refuted by independent investigation. The theatre is among the many Ukrainian heritage and cultural sites destroyed during the invasion. The attack was classified as a war crime by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and Amnesty International.\nKramatorsk railway station attack\nOn 8 April 2022, at 10:24 and 10:25, media affiliated with the Donetsk People's Republic published videos showing a pair of missiles being launched from Shakhtarsk, a city under separatist control. At approximately 10:30, two missiles hit near the railway station building in Kramatorsk, and the first reports were published in Ukrainian media at around 10:45. According to the Ukrainian government, between 1000 and 4000 civilians, mainly women and children, were present at the station awaiting evacuation from the region, which was being subjected to heavy Russian shelling. the attack left at least 60 dead and 110+ wounded. The missiles were initially misidentified as Iskander ballistic missiles. Pavlo Kyrylenko, governor of Donetsk oblast, later specified that they had rather been Tochka-U missiles armed with cluster munitions. The remnants of one of the missiles had the Russian words ЗА ДЕТЕЙ (za detey), meaning \"[in revenge] for the children\", painted in white on its outside. It also bore serial number Ш91579, which investigators said could potentially help trace it back to its original arsenal.\nInitially, Russian state media and pro-Russian telegram channels claimed successful Russian airstrikes on a military transport target in Kramatorsk. However, after it became clear that the missiles had killed civilians, earlier reports were redacted, the Russian government also denied responsibility for the attack, and the Russian Ministry of Defence characterized it as a \"Ukrainian hoax\". The Russian Ministry of Defence later claimed that the missiles were launched by Ukrainian forces from the city of Dobropillia, southwest of Kramatorsk. Russian media also said that the serial number of the missile was in the same range as one used by Ukrainian forces, however, these claims were rapidly debunked. A fake video clip with a mock BBC logo, attributing blame to the Ukrainian forces, circulated through pro-Russian telegram channels and Russian state television since 10 April. However, the BBC said that it has not produced any such video. The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed that their forces no longer use Tochka-U missiles. However, Amnesty International had published videos about use of Tochka-U missiles in other cities before Kramatorsk. investigators from the open-source Belarusian Hajun project had also published videos of several Russian trucks with Tochka missiles heading from Belarus to Ukraine with 'V' markings on 5 and 30 March. The Institute for the Study of War assessed that the Russian 8th Guards Combined Arms Army, which is active in the Donbas area, is equipped with Tochka-U missiles.\nMichelle Bachelet, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Dunja Mijatović, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres and Oleksandr Kamyshin, chairman of Ukrainian Railways described the event as \"war crimes\" and \"a crime against humanity\" by Russian forces. The Security Service of Ukraine opened criminal proceedings under Article 438 of the Criminal Code. Royal United Services Institute analyst Justin Bronk said that Russia aimed to damage Ukrainian transport infrastructure to make it difficult for Ukrainian forces to move around Donbas. He also suggested that Russia opted for the Tochka-U missile type due to its use by the Ukrainian army, in order to \"muddy the waters\". The Pentagon highlighted Russian responsibility for the attack, as well as the strategic importance of the railway junction.\nKramatorsk restaurant strike\nOn 27 June 2023, Russian forces attacked a pizza restaurant in Kramatorsk with an Iskander missile, killing 13 people including four children and Ukrainian writer Victoria Amelina. About sixty people were wounded.\nKramatorsk was about 18 miles (30&nbsp;km) from the eastern frontline. The restaurant was popular with local civilians, war correspondents, humanitarian volunteers, as well as Ukrainian soldiers on leave to 'rest and recuperate' and meet their loved ones. Several journalists were having a meal when the missile struck, including three Colombians. Russia's Defense Ministry claimed the strike targeted a \"temporary command post\" of the Ukrainian army. Ukraine's prosecutor general said the missile has high precision, \"which means Russia was deliberately targeting civilians\". Ukraine's Security Service later arrested a local man who allegedly helped co-ordinate the strike with the Russian military.\nJuly 2025 Kramatorsk residential building strike\nOn 22 July 2025, a Russian aerial bomb hit a residential apartment building in Kramatorsk, injuring at least eight civilians and killing a 10-year-old boy.\nChasiv Yar missile strike\nOn 9 July 2022, a missile strike on two residential buildings in Chasiv Yar was carried out by the Russian Armed Forces at 21:17 local time. At least 48 people were killed, Due to the impact, a five-story residential building partially collapsed. Two entrances were completely destroyed. The strike was alleged, including by Donetsk Oblast governor Pavlo Kyrylenko, to have been performed with \"Uragan\", a self-propelled 220&nbsp;mm multiple rocket launcher designed in the Soviet Union. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed that they destroyed a \"temporary deployment point\" of a Ukrainian territorial defence unit. As of 10 July 67 rescue workers of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine were trying to help the victims and more than 20 people were still feared to be trapped under the rubble. Rescue and search operations continued until the morning of 14 July 2022. Rescuers dismantled about 525 tons of destroyed elements of the building. 323 employees of the State Emergency Service and 9 units of equipment were involved. As of 13 July 48 dead were found under the rubble of the building, and nine wounded were rescued as of 12 July. A local resident told The New York Times that there were 10 elderly civilians in the buildings, but that members of the military had come to lodge there two days earlier. Two soldiers who probably took turns sleeping in the building after being on duty were among the dead. Andriy Yermak, the chief of staff to Ukraine's president, said that the strike was \"another terrorist attack\" and that Russia should be designated a \"state sponsor of terrorism\" as a result. Russian military spokesman Igor Konashenkov stated that Russia had killed \"over 300 nationalists\" in an attack on Chasiv Yar, but did not specify whether or not they were referring to the July airstrike or an earlier attack.\nDonetsk City\nOn 27 July 2022, thousands of miniature plastic antipersonnel PFM-1 mines were dispersed over civilian areas of the Russian held city of Donetsk by a BM-27 Uragan multiple rocket launcher. This resulted in a number of people being injured, most prominently Semen Pegov, a Russian war blogger calling himself \"War Gonzo\". The Russian Foreign Ministry and local sources accused the Ukrainian army of being responsible for their deployment. The so-called \"butterfly mines\" are banned under the 1997 Ottawa Treaty (signed by Ukraine but not by Russia) due to the high danger they pose to civilians.\nSloviansk missile strike\nOn 14 April 2023, on Orthodox Christian Good Friday, Russian forces launched eight S-300 missiles at Sloviansk. One struck a five-storey residential building, killing 15 civilians, including a child, and wounding 24.\nKostiantynivka shopping centre missile attack\nOn 9 August 2024, a Kostiantynivka shopping centre was struck by a Russian air-to-surface missile in the middle of the day. Ukrainian authorities reported at least 14 deaths and 43 injuries.\nDobropillia strikes\nOn 8 March 2025, the Ukrainian Interior Ministry and Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin said that Russian missile and drone attacks on Dobropillia had killed 11 people and injured 47, with children being among five of the dead and seven of the injured. The attack took place shortly after US president Donald Trump halted intelligence sharing with Ukraine, causing concerns that Russian missiles could now strike cities without prior warning.\nYarova airstrike\nOn 9 September 2025, officials said a Russian guided bomb struck the village of Yarova, killing 24 elderly people that were collecting their pensions in the village, and wounding another 19 people.\nBombardment of Izium\nOn 3 March 2022, Russian forces bombed the central hospital in Izium, Eight people died and the hospital sustained \"significant damage\". On 8 March, the same recently refurbished hospital in the city was destroyed during shelling, this was followed on 11 March by an attack to a psychiatric hospital. On 15 September 2022, after Ukrainian forces had retaken Izium, several mass graves were discovered of more than 440 bodies buried in a forest northeast of the city. among the dead, some had reportedly died as a result of shelling and airstrikes. Forensic investigations and questioning of witnesses were ongoing as of 16 September 2022.\nKharkiv Oblast\nBombardment of Kharkiv\nshelled by Russian forces]]\nDuring and after the Battle of Kharkiv, extensive parts of residential areas have been destroyed by Russian shelling.\nAccording to a HRW report published on 4 March, on 28 February, at around 10:00 AM, Russian forces fired cluster munitions with Grad rockets into at least three different residential areas in Kharkiv, killing at least nine civilians and injuring another 37. The city's mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said that four people were killed when they left a shelter to get water and a family of two parents and three children were burned alive in their car. The locations hit were residential buildings and a playground, dispersed between Industrialnyi and Shevchenkivskyi District. Explosions in the city were recorded as late as 2:23 PM.\nOn 1 March, a shell damaged a boarding school for blind children. As of 4 March 122 civilians including five children had been killed in the Kharkiv Oblast, according to the Kharkiv Regional Police. Out of an initial population of 1.8 million, only 500,000 people remained in Kharkiv by 7 March. On 18 March, the number of civilians reportedly killed in Kharkiv exceeded 450 as a consequence of the use of cluster munitions and explosive weapons in heavily populated areas of the city. On 24 March a cluster munition attack killed eight people were killed and fifteen were injured while queuing for humanitarian aid together with hundreds of civilians near the Akademika Pavlova metro station. On 24 March 2022, a Russian missile strike hit a shopping mall parking lot near the Akademika Pavlova metro station. At the time, hundreds of people were waiting outside a post office in the mall to obtain humanitarian aid. Six people were killed and at least 15 further were injured. Two further cluster bombings damaged the nearby Holy Trinity Church where volunteers were preparing humanitarian aid.\n, 17 August 2022]]\nOn 15 April 2022 in the afternoon, during the battle of Kharkiv, the Russian Army fired 9N210/9N235 cluster bombs into the Industrialnyi District, striking a residential area and a playground in the Myru Street. Nine civilians died and 35 were injured, including children. The local hospital received wounded people with pieces of steel rod and shrapnel in their limbs. Overall, the cluster bombs detonated over an area of 700 square metres.\nHuman Rights Watch investigated the attack and concluded that the Russian forces used Smerch cluster munition rockets, which disperse dozens of submunitions or bomblets in the air. As there were no military targets within 400 meters of these strikes and due to the indiscriminate use of these weapons against densely populated areas, HRW described these strikes as possible war crimes.

A fire broke out, and, according to Dmytro Lunin, Governor of Poltava Oblast, the attack killed at least 20 people and injured at least 56. 36 people were also initially reported missing. According to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the attack was carried out by Russian Tu-22M3 strategic bombers that took off from the Shaykovka air base in the Kaluga Oblast. The missiles were launched over the territory of the Kursk Oblast. Ukrainian Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky said that the missile hit the far end of the shopping mall. The area of the resulting fire was more than  and up to 115 firefighters and 20 fire-fighting appliances were involved in extinguishing it.\nOn the day of the attack, Russian television did not report it until the Russian Ministry of Defense confirmed that it had happened. Pro-Russian Telegram channels have spread multiple conflicting theories about the missile strike, including the claim that the missile was aimed at a car factory near the mall, that the mall was being used as a military equipment warehouse, or as a base of the Territorial Defense Forces, and that the missile strike is a Ukrainian provocation involving the use of \"canned bodies\". On the day after the attack, Russian authorities and state-controlled media issued a number of contradictory statements about the attack, including claims that the attack was \"fake\" and that the Ukrainian army had bombed the mall themselves. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said: \"The detonation of the munitions for western weaponry in storage led to a fire in a non-functioning shopping centre next to the factory.\" The claims that the shopping mall was \"non-functional\" have been debunked by several organizations. According to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, there were more than 1,000 people inside the mall when the strike occurred, The non-profit online journalism collective Bellingcat used receipts from recent purchases at the mall to prove that the mall had been open prior to the attack. the BBC also published interviews with people who were working or shopping in the mall at the time.

They killed at least eight Ukrainian civilians (including 2 children). Human Rights Watch alleged the Russian army carried out an \"unlawful, indiscriminate and disproportionate attack\". The incident was part of an assault on Irpin.\nOn that day, there were hundreds of civilians at the intersection on the P30 road, near the St. George's Ukrainian Orthodox Church, just south of a bridge that the Ukrainian army had destroyed to hinder the Russian invasion. The civilians were fleeing the Russian army's advance from Irpin towards Kyiv. In the intersection near the bridge were a dozen Ukrainian soldiers, some helping the civilians carry their luggage and children. The Ukrainian artillery was firing mortar rounds from a position about  away. No agreements had been reached between the parties about a temporary ceasefire or humanitarian corridor. Journalists of The New York Times and freelance journalists on the scene report that for several hours the Russian army bombarded the intersection that the civilians were using to flee. The Russians fired explosive projectiles into the area, with projectiles hitting the intersection or the surrounding area every 10 minutes, Among the victims were a group of four, including two children, who were killed by a mortar strike.\nAccording to Human Rights Watch, it is possible that the projectiles were \"observed\" by the Russians, who would then know where they were landing and could easily have adjusted the aim away from the intersection. Instead they engaged in prolonged shelling of the intersection being used by civilians, which indicates \"potential recklessness or deliberateness\" on their part. The repeated nature of the attacks suggests that Russian forces \"violated their obligations under international humanitarian law not to conduct indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks that harm civilians, and failed to take all feasible measures to avoid civilian casualties\". The human rights organisation also stated that the Ukrainian forces \"have an obligation to take all feasible precautions to avoid or minimize civilian harm,\" such as refraining from engaging in combat in populated areas.\nKyiv missile strikes\nUkraine's capital Kyiv, a city of some three million people, was among the first targets of Russian airstrikes.

According to Europe 1, ten days after the Russian army had left, firefighters were still working to recover bodies from the rubble in order to bury them with dignity. Their work was complicated by the risk of other buildings collapsing. More bodies were discovered daily.

Bodies from the Bucha-Irpin region showed lesions from small nail-like objects contained in tank or field gun shells. According to witnesses, Russian artillery fired shells that spread fléchettes a few days before retreating from the area at the end of March. While fléchettes are not prohibited under international law, their use in residential areas may qualify as the war crime of indiscriminate attack. The spokesperson for the Ukrainian Ground Forces stated that Ukraine's military does not use shells with fléchettes.\nAccording to Oleg Tkalenko, deputy chief prosecutor of the Kyiv Oblast, forensic experts found fragments of cluster munitions in bodies from mass graves in Bucha after the retreat of Russian troops, the exact number of civilians killed specifically due to the use of cluster munitions in the village was unknown, but at least 8 out of about 500 of those found were reportedly killed by their use, The Guardian later confirmed the use of RBK-500 cluster munitions with PTAB-submunitions and cluster missiles fired by the BM-30 Smerch in Bucha.

The oblast had been hit regularly by Russian shelling and airstrikes since the beginning of the invasion in 2022, but Ukraine's offensive into the Kursk Oblast brought the front line closer and led to an increase in attacks by Russia. The energy infrastructure in particular had been badly damaged in Sumy, as part of a broader Russian campaign to degrade Ukraine's power plants and make it more difficult for utilities to provide basic services.\nThe United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission said in a September 2024 report that large-scale Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure ″have inflicted extensive harm and hardship on the country's civilian population, with potentially devastating consequences as winter approaches″.\nOn 22 July 2025, Russian forces struck residential buildings in Sumy, injuring at least 12 people.\nMedical centre drone attacks\nOn 28 September 2024, Ukrainian officials reported that at least eight people had died following two consecutive Russian drone attacks on a medical centre in Sumy.

The attack was internationally condemned, with the Trump administration's special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, commenting on the attack saying it ″crosses any line of decency″. The European Union's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, also commented, calling the strike a ″horrific example of Russia intensifying attacks while Ukraine has accepted an unconditional ceasefire″, while French President Emmanuel Macron said ″strong measures″ are needed for a ceasefire.

International humanitarian law requires all parties to the conflict to avoid, to the extent feasible, \"locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas\" and requires them to \"remove civilian persons and objects under its control from the vicinity of military objectives\". Contrary to the use of human shields, these fighting tactics do not involve utilizing the presence of civilians to render certain areas immune from military operations.\nOn 29 June, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed concern about Russian and Ukrainian armed forces taking up positions close to civilian objects without taking measures for protecting the civilians. The human rights agency had also received reports of the use of human shields. OHCHR documented the consequences of these fighting tactics in the case of a care house in Stara Krasnianka where the Ukrainian army had set up a firing position without first evacuating the residents, and in the case of a school in Yahidne, where 360 residents including 74 children were held captive by Russian forces for almost a month. Similar concerns were raised also by a report published on 20 July by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and by Human Rights Watch on 21 July.\nAmnesty International said on 4 August that it had found evidence that Ukrainian forces had repeatedly put civilians in danger by establishing bases and firing positions in populated residential areas, including schools and hospitals; some areas were kilometres away from front lines and, according to Amnesty International, alternative locations were available to the Ukrainian army. Between April and July, Amnesty International researchers found evidence that Ukrainian military objectives had been placed within residential areas in 19 towns and villages in the Kharkiv, Donetsk, Luhansk and Mykolaiv oblasts. Amnesty International's Secretary General Agnès Callamard stated that there was \"a pattern of Ukrainian forces putting civilians at risk and violating the laws of war when they operate in populated area\". The Amnesty report sparked significant outrage in Ukraine and the West and Oksana Pokalchuk, head of Amnesty International in Ukraine, resigned from her post and left the organization in protest over the publication of the report. Amnesty's report was criticized by military and legal experts such as John Spencer, a specialist in urban warfare studies, who stated that advising Ukrainian forces not to be in urban areas did not make sense, as the circumstances of the war necessitated that. United Nations war crime investigator Marc Garlasco stated that the Amnesty report got the law wrong, and also that Ukraine was making efforts to protect civilians, including helping them to relocate.\nIn mid-October 2022, the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine released a report which included findings that both Russian and Ukrainian forces had \"deployed their military assets and troops in ways that can endanger civilians\".\nAnalysis\nBy January 2025, it is estimated Russia dropped 51,000 guided bombs on Ukraine. This is almost three times the amount compared to 19,000 guided bombs dropped by the US and the UK during the Iraq War. By February 2024, Russia had fired between 12,000,000 and 17,000,000 artillery shells against Ukraine. By comparison, the US Army fired 35,000 artillery shells in five months against Islamic State in the 2017 intervention in Syria, 60,000 artillery shells in the Gulf War, and 34,000 artillery shells in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nAltogether, 3,404 civilians died in the War in Donbas (2014–2022). By comparison, after Russia's February 2022 full-scale invasion, 4,163 civilians died in March 2022, meaning that more civilians were killed in that one month alone than in the entire eight years of the Donbas War.\nThe Uppsala Conflict Data Program estimated that 95% of casualties in the siege of Mariupol were civilians—a civilian casualty ratio higher than the one in the Gaza War (83%) and the Srebrenica massacre (92%), and surpassed in modern times only by the Rwandan genocide.\nNo region in Ukraine was spared from Russian attacks. According to a Ukrainian estimate, only 3% of all Russian missiles, drones and bombs hit military targets, while 97% hit civilian targets. By June 2023, UNDP estimated 1.5 million homes in Ukraine were either damaged or destroyed in the Russo-Ukrainian War. By comparison, approximately 2 million homes were damaged or destroyed in Ukraine during World War II.\nThe Kyiv School of Economics estimated in January 2024 that the total area of damaged or destroyed housing units in Ukraine caused by the war was  or 8.6% of the country's housing stock. This is 1.4 million households, leaving 3.4 million people homeless. Since 2022, half of all pregnancies in Ukraine resulted in preterm births due to war-related stress. By December 2024, the UN recorded 1,614 attacks on Ukrainian schools by Russian forces.\nIn 2024, UNICEF reported that 16 Ukrainian children were killed or injured every week in the war. UNICEF also estimates that 1.5 million Ukrainian children suffered from PTSD or other mental health problems related to the conflict. On average, Ukrainian children were hiding in underground bomb shelters for 920 hours (more than a month) in 2022. According to a study, trauma exposure in the first year of war encompassed 57% of children aged 7–17, and 45% of children aged 3–6. By 2025, approximately 70% of Ukrainian children, or 3.5 million, were experiencing material deprivation such as lack of food, clothing, heating at home and access to education – an almost fourfold rise from only 18% who experienced this in 2021. Due to Russian attacks on infrastructure, one in three Ukrainian children lived without water supply or an operative sewage system at home.\nSee also\n* War crimes in the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Russian strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure (2022–present)\n* Allegations of genocide of Ukrainians in the Russo-Ukrainian War\n* Casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War\n* Russian war crimes\n* War crimes in Donbas\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://gijn.org/2022/03/02/15-tips-for-investigating-war-crimes Guide to investigating war crimes] at Global Investigative Journalism Network by investigative journalist Manisha Ganguly\n* Contact websites for those providing evidence\n** [https://otppathway.icc-cpi.int/link/registerapplication?name=otpcontactpathway&lang=en_UK Contact pathway of the Office of the Prosecutor] of the International Criminal Court\n** [https://warcrimes.gov.ua/en Ukrainian government website] for collecting evidence on war crimes committed by Russian forces\n* [https://ukraine.bellingcat.com Map of likely war crimes in Ukraine] by Bellingcat\n* Videos\n** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwfyJGdFpSA Video of drone flyover of apartment buildings being bombed in Mariupol.
