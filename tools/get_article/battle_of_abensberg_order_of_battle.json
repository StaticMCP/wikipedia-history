The Austrians formed the left wing of Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen's main army and were under the overall command of Hiller. Napoleon's French troops, reinforced by troops from the Kingdom of Bavaria and the Kingdom of Württemberg outfought their opponents, inflicted heavy losses, and forced the Austrians to retreat to the southeast.\nDuring the fighting, 55,000 French and German troops faced 42,000 Austrian soldiers. Of these, only about 25,000 on each side became involved in the fighting. The Austrians lost 2,710 killed and wounded, plus about 4,000 captured. Allied losses were 215 Frenchmen, 146 Württembergers, and 746 Bavarians, for a total of 1,107.\nAustrian forces\nLeft Wing: Feldmarschall-Leutnant Johann von Hiller\nVI Armeekorps\nJohann von
