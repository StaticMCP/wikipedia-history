Recorded from January 15 to February 28, 1995, at Soundcastle in Los Angeles, California, it was Trout's first album to be self-produced, and was released on June 6, 1995, by Provogue Records. The album reached number 58 on the Dutch Albums Chart and number 4 on the UK Jazz & Blues Albums Chart.\nBackground\nAfter releasing his band's fourth studio album ''Tellin' Stories on Silvertone Records, Walter Trout returned to his original label Provogue Records for Breaking the Rules''. In a 1999 interview, the guitarist recalled that \"they [Silvertone] didn't do a very good job for me, either in Europe or America. All my record sales in Europe started to go down and I realised that Europe was my bread and butter\", leading to him re-signing with Provogue. Recording for Breaking the Rules took place between January 15 and February 28, 1995, at Soundcastle in Los Angeles, California, with Trout taking on production duties for the first time in his career.\nReception\nCommercial\nBreaking the Rules reached number 58 on the Dutch Albums Chart and number 4 on the UK Jazz & Blues Albums Chart.\nCritical\n}}\nBreaking the Rules received positive reviews from critics. Reviewing the album for the Los Angeles Times, Mike Boehm proclaimed it to be Trout's best album since 1990's Prisoner of a Dream, writing that \"Trout can handle pop and rock songwriting, as well as play within the styles and forms of traditional blues. His approach here is to strike a balance – a good choice that lets him blaze bluesily on some tracks, while demonstrating a good ear for melody on such pop-leaning highlights\". Boehm also praised Trout's first effort as a producer, claiming that he \"gives himself and his band mates something they lacked on ''Tellin' Stories and its predecessor, Transition: a broad, uncluttered sonic field on which to operate\". A review in Music & Media described Breaking the Rules as \"a refreshing mix of rock and blues\".\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nWalter Trout Band\n*Walter Trout – vocals, guitar, harmonica, production, art concept\n*Jimmy Trapp – bass\n*Bernard Pershey – drums, percussion\n*Martin Gerschwitz – keyboards, violin\nAdditional musicians\n*Teresa James – backing vocals\n*Danny Timms – backing vocals\nAdditional personnel\n*Charlie Watts – engineering\n*Tim Nitz – engineering assistance\n*Gabe Chiesa – engineering assistance\n*Mike Iacopelli – mastering\n*Paul Roos – design\n*Dora Larson – illustration\nNotes\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Chart performance for Breaking the Rules''\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (1995)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Dutch Albums (MegaCharts)\n|58\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Jazz & Blues Albums (OCC)\n|4\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
