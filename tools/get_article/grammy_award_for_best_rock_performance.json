According to the 54th Grammy Awards description guide it is designed for solo, duo/groups or collaborative (vocal or instrumental) rock recordings and is limited to singles or tracks only.\nThis award combines the previous categories for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance, Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and Best Rock Instrumental Performance. The restructuring of these categories was a result of the Recording Academy's wish to decrease the list of categories and awards and to eliminate the distinctions between solo and duo/groups performances. The Academy argued that any distinction between these performances is difficult to make, as \"four-fifths of rock acts are groups, and even solo rock acts tend to be backed by a band\".\nThe award goes to the artist. The producer, engineer and songwriter can apply for a Winners Certificate.\nFrom 2014, this category has also included hard rock performances that were previously screened in the Best Hard Rock Performance and Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance categories, which are now defunct.\nRecipients\nDave Grohl and the [[Foo Fighters were the inaugural winners of the award.]]\nDavid Bowie was posthumously honoured in 2017.\nLeonard Cohen posthumously won in 2018.\nwas the first solo female artist to win this category, in a line-up featuring only female performers for the first time. She had previously won the Best Female Rock Vocal Performance trophy with \"Criminal\" in 1998.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"7%\" | Year\n! width=\"25%\" | Performing artist(s)\n! width=\"25%\" | Work\n! width=\"35%\" class=unsortable|Nominees\n! width=\"5%\" class=unsortable|Ref.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2012\n| Foo Fighters\n| \"Walk\"\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2013\n| The Black Keys\n| \"Lonely Boy\"\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2014\n| Imagine Dragons\n| \"Radioactive\"\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2015\n| Jack White\n| \"Lazaretto\"\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2016\n| Alabama Shakes\n| \"Don't Wanna Fight\"\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2017\n|David Bowie\n|\"Blackstar\"\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2018\n|Leonard Cohen\n|\"You Want It Darker\"\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2019\n| Chris Cornell\n| \"When Bad Does Good\"\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2020\n| Gary Clark Jr.\n| \"This Land\"\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2021\n| Fiona Apple\n| \"Shameika\"\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n!2022\n| Foo Fighters\n| \"Making a Fire\"\n|\n|\n|-\n!2023\n| Brandi Carlile\n| \"Broken Horses\"\n|\n|\n|-\n!2024\n| Boygenius\n| \"Not Strong Enough\"\n|\n|\n|-\n!2025\n| The Beatles\n| \"Now and Then\"\n|\n|\n|-\n!2026\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\nEach year is linked to the article about the Grammy Awards held that year.\nArtists with multiple nominations\n;6 nominations\n*Brittany Howard (4 with Alabama Shakes)\n;5 nominations\n*Foo Fighters\n;4 nominations\n*Alabama Shakes\n*The Black Keys\n;3 nominations\n*Arctic Monkeys\n*Chris Cornell\n*Jack White\n;2 nominations\n* Beck\n* Black Pumas\n* David Bowie\n* Coldplay\n* Idles\n* Mumford & Sons\n* Phoebe Bridgers (1 with Boygenius)\n* Turnstile\nSee also\n*Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance\n*Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance\n*Grammy Award for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance\n*Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal\n*Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance\n*Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance\n*Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance\n*Grammy Award for Best Rock Song\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.grammy.com Official Site of the Grammy Awards]"
