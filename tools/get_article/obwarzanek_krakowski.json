It has a white, sweetish, moist and chewy crumb underneath a crunchy golden-brown crust. Traditionally sold from street carts, it is a popular snack in the Polish city of Kraków, where it has the status of a regional food with protected geographical indication. Similar to bagels and bubliks it is derived, but distinct, from pretzels.\nEtymology\nThe term ' is Polish. The Polish noun ', or ', derives from the verb ', \"to parboil\", which refers to the distinctive technique of boiling the dough before baking. The adjective ' denotes anything coming from or related to the city of Kraków.\nDescription\nAn ' is a ring-shaped baked product with a hole in the middle. It takes the form of an oval or, seldom, a circle. Its surface is formed by strands of dough, round or oval in cross-section, twisted into a spiral. The colour ranges from light golden to light brown, with a distinct sheen. A typical ' is  in diameter,  thick, and weighs .\nThe visible strands of the spiral on the crust are firmish to the touch and the surface varies from smooth to slightly rough. The crumb inside is pale, soft and slightly moist. The taste is sweetish, which is typical of bakery products that are first parboiled and then baked.  are traditionally decorated by sprinkling them with various ingredients, including coarse salt, poppy seeds, sesame seeds, flax seeds, nigella seeds, mixed herbs or mixed spices (paprika, caraway, pepper), grated cheese, onion flakes, etc.\nHistory\ns from a typical cart]]\nThe obwarzanek, like the bagel, is derived from the pretzel.  Pretzel's held religious significance due to both their ingredients and their shape.  Pretzels were made using a simple recipe of flour and water, meaning they could be eaten during Lent when Christians were forbidden from eating eggs, lard or dairy products.  As pretzels spread across Europe they made their way to Poland, where the German \"beugel\" (\"ring\", or \"bracelet\" became \"bagel\" Obwarzanek itself is derived from the Polish word for parboiling, a distinctive process to bagel making.  It is believed that the bagel was further developed from this common root.\nThe earliest known references to  being baked in Kraków, Poland's former royal capital, appear in the accounts of the court of Queen Jadwiga and her consort King Władysław II Jagiełło. An entry dated to 2 March 1394 mentions the product using both its Polish name and its equivalent in Polish Medieval Latin, ', or \"rings\": \"for the queen, for rings of ' ['], 1 '\".[\n{\"type\": \"ExternalData\", \"service\": \"geoshape\", \"ids\": \"Q31487\",   \"properties\": { \"fill\": \"#DAA520\" } }, //Kraków city\n{\"type\": \"ExternalData\", \"service\": \"geoshape\", \"ids\": \"Q1164890\", \"properties\": { \"fill\": \"#DAA520\" } }, //Kraków county\n{\"type\": \"ExternalData\", \"service\": \"geoshape\", \"ids\": \"Q609424\", \"properties\": { \"fill\": \"#DAA520\" } }  //Wieliczka county\n]In modern times, ' have been sold not only in shops and bakeries, but also from street carts. There are between 170 and 180 such carts offering ' in Kraków today. An average of almost 150,000 are sold on the Kraków market in a single day.\nThe ' often features in campaigns to promote Kraków. As a well-known symbol of Kraków and Lesser Poland, it is often used in advertising aimed at locals and tourists alike. It has also won an award at the ' (Our Culinary Heritage) competition, and received a prize at the 2003 Polagra Farm international fair in Poznań. It always features at the ' bread festival, an event that is held regularly in Kraków.\nSee also\n* List of breads\nReferences\nSources\n*  }}\n*\n*  }}\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://culture.pl/en/article/10-must-have-foods-from-polish-cities 10 Must-Have Foods from Polish Cities]\n*"
