The monument was completed in 1882 and is the final resting place of early Indiana settler and cattle baron, Edward. C. Sumner, and his wife, Abigail Sumner. The sculptor of the work is unknown.\nDescription\nThe monument is a large pedestal made of either granite or marble. The Inventories of American Painting and Sculpture has documentation stating it is made of marble, however, a Save Outdoor Sculpture! surveyor stated that it was made of granite. On top of the pedestal is a statue, again, of either granite or marble, of Edward C. Sumner. He wears clothing from the 19th century. His proper left elbow rests on a tree stump. The stump is covered with vines. His proper right hand is placed in his pocket. On the shaft of the pedestal is a relief bust of his wife, Abigail Sumner. In total, the sculpture is 22 feet high.  An inscription is located on the front of the base: LSC/SUMNER\nA wooden sign nearby the monument reads:\n:Sumner Cemetery\n:Edward C.
