Showrunner Chris Brancato later clarified \"This story is an Old Testament [one that's] violent [and] sex-drenched. It's one of the world's first soap operas. ... You will watch a show that is tasteful but that also tells the story you can read if you want to pick up the Bible.\" Then-ABC president Paul Lee (who was removed from the network before the show premiered) described the pilot episode simply as \"muscular\".\nCooper suggested that if need be, some of the more graphic scenes on the series may be edited for public broadcast, and release the originally intended scenes for online viewing. This did indeed occur with the first episode, which was released online with additional sexual content and nudity that was not seen in the ABC broadcast.\nReception\nCritical response\nThe show has received below average reviews from critics, with some critics negatively comparing it to Game of Thrones. On Metacritic, the first season of Of Kings and Prophets received a score of 47/100 based on 16 media reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 29% approval rating based on 17 media reviews with its critical consensus: \"Of Kings and Prophets tries to add a Game of Thrones-inspired spin to the Old Testament, but ends up an aimless muddle.\" In the show's favor, Variety wrote, \"Its courtly sets, tents, and marketplaces often have a pleasingly realistic level of detail, and some glimpses of the outdoor scenery of South Africa (which stands in for ancient Israel) are breathtaking.\" IGN noted, \"It does have a few things going for it, including high production values and intriguing political and religious themes. Winstone (as Saul) brings a very human quality to the character that is usually left out of other depictions.\"\nParental group reaction\nThe Parents Television Council criticized the series for scenes of sex and violence and called for it to be removed from the network's schedule. The PTC has compared the show's content to a \"broadcast\" version of Game of Thrones.\nRatings\nThe first episode opened up to 3.32&nbsp;million viewers. The second episode had lower ratings, having live viewing of 2.42&nbsp;million viewers, assuring the show's cancellation. Beyond the Tank, which had aired several episodes in the fall and early winter in the same timeslot, returned for the remainder of the season.\nEpisodes\n|Viewers         = 3.33\n|ShortSummary    = In order to defend his kingdom, King Saul of the Israelites arranges a strategic marriage for his daughter Merav to the Eitan of Judah's son Mattiyahu in hopes it will unify the 12 Israelite tribes against their enemies, the Philistines.
