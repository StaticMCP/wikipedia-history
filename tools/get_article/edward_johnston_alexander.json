He is the author or one of the authors of 205 entries in the International Plant Names Index. He was born in Asheville, North Carolina and studied at North Carolina State University from 1919 to 1923. He was a longtime assistant and curator at New York Botanical Garden (NYBG), originally under the guidance of Small. While at the NYBG, he served as an editor of the Garden's botanical journal Addisonia for about thirty years, until the journal ceased publication in 1964.\nAlexander undertook several botanical expeditions in his lifetime, including to Pecos, Texas with John Kunkel Small and to the southern Appalachians and the Rocky Mountains with Thomas H. Everett. His most successful expedition was to southern Mexico from 1944 to 1945. On that trip, he collected around 1,600 specimens and 1,000 seeds and roots for the herbarium and propagation houses at the New York Botanical Garden.\nAlexander never married. He died in 1985.\nPlant discoveries\n*Epidendrum hartii\n*Mucuna\n*Mucuna urens\n*Nopalxochia ackermannii candida\nWorks\n*The Flora of the Unicorn Tapestries\n*Succulent Plants of New and Old World Deserts\n*The New York Botanical GardenTrees-Shrubs\n*List of Seeds Distributed to Subscribers of the Southern Appalachian Expedition of the New York Botanical Garden 1933\n*CompositaeHeliantheaeCoreopsidinae\n*North American Flora.
