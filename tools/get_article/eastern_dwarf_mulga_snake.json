The species, which is native to Australia, was genetically confirmed as a distinct species in 2017.\nTaxonomy\nThe eastern dwarf mulga snake was originally described in 1998 as Pailsus pailsei by Raymond Hoser. Wolfgang Wüster identified that its specific name should be spelt pailsi under taxonomic rules in 2001. However, according to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (Article 32.5.1) the original spelling should still be used, even though it is an incorrect latinisation.\nEtymology\nThe specific name, pailsi, is in honour of Australian reptile breeder Roy Pails (born 1956).\nGeographic range\nP. pailsi is found in northern Queensland, Australia.\nDescription\nP. pailsi may attain a total length (including tail) of .\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Cogger H (2014).
