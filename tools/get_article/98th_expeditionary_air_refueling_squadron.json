Its last assignment was with the 92d Operations Group at Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington, where it was inactivated on 1 July 1998.\nTwo of the squadron's predecessors were formed during World War II under the name 398th Bombardment Squadron.  The first was a Third Air Force medium bomber Operational Training Unit, which was disbanded when the Army Air Forces reorganized its training units in the spring of 1944.  The second was a very heavy operational unit that participated in the strategic bombing campaign against Japan, earning two Distinguished Unit Citations before inactivating in the Philippines after V-J Day.  They were consolidated with the 98th in 1985.\nThe 98th Air Refueling Squadron was a Strategic Air Command tanker unit.  It was active twice during the 1950s, then served with Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers from 1963 to 1998.  It was converted to provisional status as an expeditionary unit in 2002.\nHistory\nWorld War II\nMedium bomber operational training unit\nEstablished in January 1942 as North American B-25 Mitchell medium bomber Operational Training Unit (OTU) for Third Air Force.  Became Martin B-26 Marauder OTU in June 1942, also flew antisubmarine patrols over the Gulf of Mexico.\nB-29 Superfortress operations against Japan\nReactivated in March 1944 as a Boeing B-29 Superfortress Very Heavy bombardment squadron.  When training was completed moved to North Field (Tinian) in the Mariana Islands of the Central Pacific Area in January 1945 and assigned to XXI Bomber Command, Twentieth Air Force. Its mission was the strategic bombardment of the Japanese Home Islands and the destruction of its war-making capability.\nFlew \"shakedown\" missions against Japanese targets on Moen Island, Truk, and other points in the Caroline Islands and Marianas.  The squadron began combat missions over Japan on 25 February 1945 with a firebombing mission over Northeast Tokyo.  The squadron continued to participate in wide area firebombing attack, but the first ten-day blitz resulting in the Army Air Forces running out of incendiary bombs. Until then the squadron flew conventional strategic bombing missions using high explosive bombs.\nThe squadron continued attacking urban areas with incendiary raids until the end of the war in August 1945, attacking major Japanese cities, causing massive destruction of urbanized areas.  Also conducted raids against strategic objectives, bombing aircraft factories, chemical plants, oil refineries, and other targets in Japan. The squadron flew its last combat missions on 14 August when hostilities ended.  Afterwards, its B 29s carried relief supplies to Allied prisoner of war camps in Japan and Manchuria.\nSquadron was largely demobilized on Tinian during the fall of 1945.  Remained in Western Pacific, assigned to Twentieth Air Force.  Moved to Clark Field in the Philippines in March 1946. Inactivated at Clark Field on Luzon on 15 June 1946; its low-hour aircraft flown to storage depots in the United States.\nUnited States Air Force\nOn 16 August 1950 the 98th Air Refueling Squadron was activated at Spokane Air Force Base, Washington and assigned to the 98th Bombardment Group, Medium while flying the KB-29.  It was inactivated on 8 April 1952, but activated the same day at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida where it was attached to the 6th Air Division.  It remained at MacDill until November 1953, when it moved to Lake Charles Air Force Base, Louisiana, where it was inactivated and its personnel and Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighters were used to form the 68th Air Refueling Squadron.\nThe 98th Air Refueling Squadron was activated again at Lincoln Air Force Base, Nebraska when the 98th wing returned from the Far East in 1954.  Made up of former members of the 55th Air Refueling Squadron from Forbes Air Force Base, Kansas.  Inactivated in 1963 when Strategic Air Command's medium strategic bomber forces began to be drawn down in favor of ICBMs.  In 1985 the 98th was consolidated with the two 398th Bombardment Squadrons.  It was redesignated the 98th Air Refueling Squadron, Heavy on 19 September 1986 and then renamed the 98th Air Refueling Squadron on 1 April 1994 at Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington, flying KC-135T Stratotanker aircraft.  The 98th was again inactivated in 1998 as the Air Force drew down after the end of the Cold War.\nIn 2002 the squadron was converted to provisional status and redesignated the 98th Expeditionary Air Refueling Squadron and assigned to Air Mobility Command to activate or inactivate as needed.\nOperations and decorations\n* Combat Operations: Antisubmarine patrols in the Gulf of Mexico, 8 June 1942 and 31 Jul-8 Aug 1942.
