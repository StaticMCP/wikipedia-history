War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of political violence or intervention. Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general.\nTypes of war\nTypes of warfare\n* Asymmetric warfare\n* Expeditionary warfare\n** Expeditionary maneuver warfare\nWarfare by objective\n* Defensive warfare\n* Offensive warfare\nWarfare by strategic doctrine\nWarfare by terrain\nWarfare by equipment or weapon type\nWarfare by era\nWarfare by stages\nOther\n* Champion warfare\nHistory of war\nWarfare by era\nSee: Warfare by era\nWars\nWars by death toll\n* List of wars by death toll\nWars by date\nWars by region\nWars by type of conflict\nBattles\n* Lists of battles\n** List of battles by casualties\n** List of orders of battle\n* List of sieges\nMilitary theory\n* Military theory\n* Philosophy of war\n* Principles of war\n* War cycles\nMilitary organization\nOperational level of war\n* Blitzkrieg\n* Soviet deep battle\n* Maneuver warfare\n** Operational manoeuvre group\nMilitary operations\n* List of military operations\n* Military operation plan\n* Military operations other than war\nTypes of military operations\nTypes of military operations, by scope:\n* Theater – operation over a large, often continental area of operation and represents a strategic national commitment to the conflict such as Operation Barbarossa, with general goals that encompass areas of consideration outside of the military such as the economic and political impacts.\n* Campaign – subset of the theatre operation, or a more limited geographic and operational strategic commitment such as Battle of Britain, and need not represent total national commitment to a conflict, or have broader goals outside of the military impacts.\n* Battle – subset of a campaign that will have specific military goals and geographic objectives, as well as clearly defined use of forces such as the Battle of Gallipoli, which operationally was a combined arms operation originally known as the \"Dardanelles landings\" as part of the Dardanelles Campaign, where about 480,000 Allied troops took part.\n* Engagement – tactical combat event of contest for specific area or objective by actions of distinct units. For example, the Battle of Kursk, also known from its German designation as Operation Citadel, included many separate engagements, several of which were combined into the Battle of Prokhorovka. The \"Battle of Kursk\" in addition to describing the initial German offensive operation (or simply an offensive), also included two Soviet counter-offensive operations Operation Kutuzov and Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev.\n* Strike – single attack, upon a specified target. This often forms part of a broader engagement. Strikes have an explicit goal, such as, rendering facilities inoperable (e.g. airports), to assassinating enemy leaders, or to limit supply to enemy troops.\nMilitary strategy\n* Attrition warfare\n* Battlespace\n* Military deception\n* Naval strategy\n* Offensive (military)\n* Strategic defence\n* Strategic goal (military)\nGrand strategy\n* Containment\n* Economic warfare\n* Military science\n* Philosophy of war\n* Strategic studies\n* Total war\nMilitary tactics\nPolitics of war\n* Casus belli – Latin expression meaning the justification for acts of war. In theory, present international law allows only three situations as legal cause to go to war: out of self-defense, defense of an ally under a mutual defense pact, or sanctioned by the UN.\n* Declaration of war\n* Surrender\n** Capitulation an agreement in time of war for the surrender to a hostile armed force of a particular body of troops, a town or a territory.\n** Strategic surrender – surrender to avoid a last, chaotic round of fighting that would have the characteristics of a rout, allowing the victor to obtain his objective without paying the costs of a last battle.\n** Unconditional surrender – surrender without conditions, except for those provided by international law.\n* Victory\n** Debellatio – when a war ends because of the complete destruction of a belligerent state.\n** No quarter – when a victor shows no clemency or mercy and refuses to spare the life of the vanquished when they surrender at discretion. Under the laws of war \"... it is especially forbidden ... to declare that no quarter will be given\".\n** Pyrrhic victory – victory with such a devastating cost that it carries the implication that another such victory will ultimately lead to defeat.\n* War effort\n* War economy\nPhilosophy of war\nPhilosophy of war – examines war beyond the typical questions of weaponry and strategy, inquiring into such things as the meaning and etiology of war, the relationship between war and human nature, and the ethics of war.\n* Militarism – belief that war is not inherently bad but can be a beneficial aspect of society.\n* Realism – its core proposition is a skepticism as to whether moral concepts such as justice can be applied to the conduct of international affairs. Proponents of realism believe that moral concepts should never prescribe, nor circumscribe, a state's behaviour. Instead, a state should place an emphasis on state security and self-interest. One form of realism – descriptive realism – proposes that states cannot act morally, while another form – prescriptive realism – argues that the motivating factor for a state is self-interest. Just wars that violate Just Wars principles effectively constitute a branch of realism.\n* Revolution and Civil War – Just War Theory states that a just war must have just authority. To the extent that this is interpreted as a legitimate government, this leaves little room for revolutionary war or civil war, in which an illegitimate entity may declare war for reasons that fit the remaining criteria of Just War Theory. This is less of a problem if the \"just authority\" is widely interpreted as \"the will of the people\" or similar. Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions side-steps this issue by stating that if one of the parties to a civil war is a High Contracting Party (in practice, the state recognised by the international community,) both Parties to the conflict are bound \"as a minimum, the following [humanitarian] provisions.\" Article 4 of the Third Geneva Convention also makes clear that the treatment of prisoners of war is binding on both parties even when captured soldiers have an \"allegiance to a government or an authority not recognized by the Detaining Power.\"\n*Consequentialism – moral theory most frequently summarized in the words \"the end justifies the means,\" which tends to support the just war theory (unless the just war causes less beneficial means to become necessary, which further requires worst actions for self-defense with bad consequences).\n* Pacifism – belief that war of any kind is morally unacceptable or pragmatically not worth the cost. Pacifists extend humanitarian concern not just to enemy civilians but also to combatants, especially conscripts. For example, Ben Salmon believed all war to be unjust. He was sentenced to death during World War I (later commuted to 25 years hard labor) for desertion and spreading propaganda.\n* Right of self-defence – maintains (based on rational self-interest) that the use of retaliatory force is justified against repressive nations that break the zero aggression principle. In addition, if a free country is itself subject to foreign aggression, it is morally imperative for that nation to defend itself and its citizens by whatever means necessary. Thus, any means to achieve a swift and complete victory over the enemy is imperative. This view is prominently held by Objectivists.\nLaws of war\n* Laws of war\n* War crimes\n** List of war crimes\nPrisoners of war\nEffects of war\n* Casualties\n** Casualty\n** Casualty classifications\n*** KIA – Killed In Action\n**** DOW – Died Of Wounds\n*** MIA – Missing In Action\n*** WIA – Wounded in action\n** Assassination\n* List of genocides by death toll\nWar and culture\nWar-related media\nWar publications\n* The Art of War\n* On War\nWar films\n* List of war films and TV specials – lists movies and shows by the war depicted in them, the sections arranged chronologically\nPersons influential in war\n* List of military writers\nInventors of Military Technology\n*Mozi\n*Archimedes\n*Wei Boyang\n*Kallinikos\n*Roger Bacon\n*Leonardo da Vinci\n*Richard Jordan Gatling\n*Mikhail Kalashnikov\n*Albert Einstein\nDuring the Classical Period\nListed by date of approximate lifetime\nAncient Egypt\n*Mentuhotep\n*Ramesses II\n*Muwatalli I (Hittite)\n*Cleopatra (Greek)\nAncient Near East\n*Hammurabi\n*Sargon II\n*Nebuchadnezzar II\n*Cyrus the Great\n*Darius I\n*Xerxes I\nAncient Greece\n* Themistocles\n* Leonidas I\n* Dionysius I of Syracuse\n* Philip II of Macedon\n* Alexander the Great\n* Diadochi\n* Pyrrhus of Epirus\nAncient India\n* Porus\n* Ashoka\n* Chandragupta\nAncient China and its enemies\n* Sun Tzu\n* Lian Po\n* Bai Qi\n* Li Mu\n* Qin Shi Huang\n**Wang Jin\n* Modu Chanyu\n* Huo Qubing\n* Wei Qing\n* Trung Sisters\nAncient Rome and its enemies\n* Mithridates VI of Pontus\n* Scipio Africanus\n* Hannibal\n* Gaius Marius\n* Julius Caesar\n* Vercingetorix\n* Arminius\n* Boudica\n* Decebalus\n* Trajan\n* Aurelian\nLate Antiquity\n* Constantine\n* Flavius Aetius\n* Attila\n* Clovis I\n* Shapur I\n* Khosrow I\n* Belisarius\n* Bahram Chobin\n* Shahin and Shahrbaraz\n* Heraclius\n* Khalid ibn al-Walid\nDuring the Post-classical Period\nEarly Middle Ages\n* Charlemagne\n* Ivar the Boneless\n* Alfred the Great\n* Cnut the Great\n* Basil the Bulgar Slayer\n* William the Conqueror\nHigh Middle Ages\n* Frederick Barbarossa\n* Henry II of England\n* Richard the Lionheart\n* Philip II of France\n* Alexander Nevsky\n* El Cid\nIslamic Golden Age\n*Tariq ibn Ziyad\n*Mahmud of Ghazni\n*Alp Arslan\n*Saladin\n*Baibars\nMedieval India\n*Rajadhiraja Chola\n*Prithviraj Chauhan\nMedieval China\n*Li Shimin\n*An Lushan\n*Zhao Kuangyin\n*Yelu Dashi\n*Zhu Yuanzhang\n*Zheng He\nMedieval Southeast Asia\n*Jayavarman II\n*Gajah Mada\n*Ramathibodi I\n*Le Loi\nMongol Conquests\n* Genghis Khan\n* Ogedei Khan\n* Subutai\n* Kublai Khan\n* Timur\nHundred Years War\n* Edward III\n* Henry V of England\n* Charles VII of France\n* Joan of Arc\nDuring the Early Modern Period\nJapanese Wars\n* Oda Nobunga\n* Toyotomi Hideyoshi\n* Tokugawa Ieyasu\nIslamic Empires\n* Mehmed the Conqueror\n* Suleiman the Magnificent\n* Nader Shah\n* Akbar\nEuropean Colonization of the Americas\n*Hernán Cortés\n*Cuauhtémoc\n*Francisco Pizarro\n*Powhaten\n*Pontiac\n*Crazy Horse\n*Tecumseh\n*Sitting Bull\nEarly Modern Europe\n*Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden\n*Oliver Cromwell\n*Peter the Great\n*Frederick I of Prussia\n*James Wolfe\n*Louis-Joseph de Montcalm\nChinese Qing dynasty\n* Wu Sangui\n* Kangxi Emperor\n* Koxinga\n* Ching Shih\n* Hong Xiuquan\nAmerican Revolutionary War\n* George Washington\n* Horatio Gates\n* Benedict Arnold\n* Marquis de Lafayette\n* Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis\nNapoleonic Wars\n* Horatio Nelson\n* Napoleon\n* Arthur Wellesley\n* Mikhail Kutuzov\n* Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher\n* Andrew Jackson (War of 1812)\nModern Period\nAmerican Civil War\n* Ulysses S Grant\n* Stonewall Jackson\n* Robert E Lee\n* George McClellan\n* William Tecumseh Sherman\nDuring World War I\n* Douglas Haig\n* Ferdinand Foch\n* Louis F. d'Esperey\n* John J.
