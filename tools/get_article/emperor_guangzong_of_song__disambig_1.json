His mother was Emperor Xiaozong's first wife, Lady Guo (郭氏; 1126–1156), who was posthumously honoured as \"Empress Chengmu\" (成穆皇后). His reign was relatively peaceful, but his lack of filial piety eventually made officials replace him with his son Emperor Ningzong.\nEarly life\nDuring his childhood, Guangzong either suffered from bipolar or severe neurosis. Despite this, Guangzong was reportedly filial to his father even though his father kept on delaying the succession.\nIn 1194, he was promoted from the ruler of a Zhou to Fu.\nEmperor Xiaozong abdicated in favor of his son Emperor Guangzong in 1194, which Emperor Guangzong later described his crowning as king or heir apparent  as a \"double celebration\", which gave the city of Chongqing its present-day name in honour of Guangzong.\nReign\nUpon the succession of Emperor Guangzong in 1189, it was actually suggested that Empress Dowager Wu would act as his regent, because of his poor health. However, during his reign, it was the spouse of Guangzong who de facto ruled the Song Empire.\nGuangzong constantly accompanied his father in tours and banquets. This changed due to the enormous influence of his wife Empress Li Fengniang became notorious in Chinese history for being ruthless and shrewd, and for ruling the state through her husband, who became known a \"henpecked weakling\" dominated by his wife. Eventually, Guangzong made up excuses in order to avoid his father.\nAccording to Xu Wei, the Nanxi style of theatre began in Emperor Guangzong's reign. Guangzong listened to some treacherous officials and dismissed the popular military leader Xin Qiji. Furthermore, Guangzong gave into drinking in his middle years which deteriorated his mental state.\nWhen the Retired Emperor Xiaozong became sick, Guangzong refused to visit him, upsetting Xiaozong and making Xiaozong's illness worsen.\nHe was forced to give up his throne to Zhao Kuo, his only surviving son and child in 1194 by his officials and his grandmother, Grand Empress Dowager Wu under the reason that he was \"too ill\" to perform the mourning rites. In reality, they had forced him to abdicate because he refused to attend the funeral procession of his father, Emperor Xiaozong due to the influence of his wife Empress Li Fengniang, and that he refused to wear mourning clothes making the officials angry about his lack of filial piety. He died in 1200 near Shaoxing, Zhejiang possibly from melancholy as he was mentally ill or he became sick and died.\nConsorts and issue\n* Empress Ciyi, of the Li clan (; 1144–1200), personal name Fengniang ()\n** Zhao Ting (), first son\n** Zhao Kuo, Ningzong (; 1168–1224), second son\n**''Princess Qi'an (), third daughter\n*Noble Consort, of the Huang clan (貴妃 黃氏 d. 14 December 1191)\n**unborn child (d.1191)\n*Noble Consort, of the Zhang clan (贵妃 张氏)\n*Jieyu, of the Fu clan (婕妤 符氏)\n* Unknown\n** Princess Wen'an (), first daughter\n** Princess Hezheng'' (), second daughter\nSee also\n* Chinese emperors family tree (middle)\n* List of emperors of the Song dynasty\n* Architecture of the Song dynasty\n* Culture of the Song dynasty\n* Economy of the Song dynasty\n* History of the Song dynasty\n* Society of the Song dynasty\n* Technology of the Song dynasty\n* Jin–Song Wars\nReferences\n*"
