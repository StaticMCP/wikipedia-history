The state legislature chose eight representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President. Georgia had gained two additional electors compared to the previous election in 1808.\nGeorgia cast eight electoral votes for the Democratic-Republican candidate and incumbent President James Madison over the other Democratic-Republican and Federalist supported candidate DeWitt Clinton. The electoral votes for Vice president were cast for Madison's running mate Elbridge Gerry from Massachusetts. These electors were elected by the Georgia General Assembly, the state legislature, rather than by popular vote.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1812 United States presidential election in Georgia\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#008000; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic-Republican\n| James Madison (incumbent)\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | 8\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#F0F071; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic-Republican-Federalist\n| DeWitt Clinton\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | Totals\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | 8\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Georgia\nNotes\nReferences"
