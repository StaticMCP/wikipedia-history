Kingman subsequently joined the Marine Corps on November 24, 1913, and was commissioned second lieutenant on the same date. His first assignment was at the Officers Basic School, Norfolk, Virginia, where he attended instruction course. Kingman was in the same company with some future Marine Corps generals, like for example William H. Rupertus, Allen H. Turnage, Henry Louis Larsen, Keller E. Rockey, Lyle H. Miller and Alphonse DeCarre.\nHe was subsequently assigned to the Marine detachment aboard the battleship USS Delaware in June 1915 and served there as junior Marine officer until April 1917. During his service aboard USS Delaware, Kingman was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant on August 29, 1916, and subsequently to the rank of captain on March 26, 1917. He was transferred to the 15th Company, 3rd Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment stationed at Marine Barracks Quantico, Virginia, in April 1917 and was appointed company's commander. The 15th Company was used to form 6th Machine Gun Battalion under the command of Major Edward B. Cole in August 1917. Kingman sailed to France in December 1917 and subsequently commanded his company during the Battle of Belleau Wood in June 1918. He was cited for gallantry in action and subsequently decorated with the Silver Star citation during that battle. Kingman wounded by enemy machine gun fire on June 6, 1918, and stayed in hospital for treatment until July. Kingman then participated in the Battle of Soissons and Battle of Saint-Mihiel and finally distinguished himself again at the beginning of October 1918. He displayed courage, coolness and leadership during the Battle of Blanc Mont Ridge and was decorated with his second Silver Star. Kingman was also decorated for bravery with French Croix de guerre 1914–1918 with Palm and Star and Fourragère by the Government of France.\nCaptain Kingman was promoted to the temporary rank of major at the end of October 1918 and placed in command of 6th Machine Gun Battalion. He succeeded Major Littleton W. T. Waller Jr., who was appointed division machine gun officer of the 2nd Division. Major Kingman commanded the 6th MG Battalion during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive and subsequently participated with this unit in occupation duties in Germany. He was ordered back to the United States in August 1919.\nInterwar period\nAfter his return to the United States, Kingman was assigned to the recruiting office in New Orleans in September 1919. He spent there two years, before he was ordered to Marine Barracks Quantico, where he served as instructor of tactics within Field Officer's Senior Course at Marine Corps School. Kingman was subsequently assigned to the 1st Brigade of Marines and sent to Haiti in April 1923.
