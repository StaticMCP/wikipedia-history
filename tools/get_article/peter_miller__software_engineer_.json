He also proposed a set of \"laws\" for modern software engineering and architecture in the early 1990s:\nMiller's laws are:\n# The number of interactions within a development team is O(n!) without controlled access to the baseline. If the development team does have controlled access to the baseline, interactions can be reduced to near O(n), where n is the number of developers and/or files in the source tree, whichever is larger.\n# The baseline MUST always be in working order.\n# The software build/construction process can be reduced to a directed, acyclical graph (DAG).\n# It is necessary to build a rigid framework of selected components (aka the top level aegis design).\n# The framework should not do any real work, and should instead delegate everything to external components. The external components should be as interchangeable as possible.\n# The framework should use the Strategy pattern for most complex tasks.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.debian.org/News/2014/20141020 Debian Project mourns the loss of Peter Miller]\n*[https://petermiller.dev Archive of Miller's website including software, books, and papers]\n*[https://github.com/mdhender/aegis Maintenance repository of Miller's Aegis on GitHub]\n*[https://github.com/mdhender/cook Maintenance repository of Miller's Cook tool on GitHub]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20141014045738/http://aegis.sourceforge.net/ Home page of Miller's Aegis software configuration management tool on SourceForge]"
