It is based in Mumbai, India.\nHistory\nThe Film Heritage Foundation was founded in 2014 by Shivendra Singh Dungarpur.\nThe foundation’s activities include conservation and archiving of films and film-related memorabilia, film restoration, training and education, film curation, public outreach, and advocacy. It also runs education and training programmes and holds workshops on film conservation and preservation and restoration around India.\nIn April 2015, it was accepted as an associate member of the International Federation of Film Archives (FIAF). Dungarpur has been elected four times as a member of the Executive Committee of FIAF. The same year, it raised funds for their film preservation and restoration workshop as well as from private businesses and Bollywood actors.\nMartin Scorsese’s The Film Foundation lent their support for Film Heritage Foundation’s first film preservation and restoration workshop in Mumbai. In 2017, Tata Trusts supported the foundation with a three-year grant in 2017 to provide scholarships for participants at their annual film preservation and restoration workshops.\nIn 2018, the foundation initiated an oral history project, in which it interviewed eminent film personalities such as Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Buddhadeb Dasgupta, Mani Ratnam, Amitabh Bachchan, Soumitra Chatterjee, Goutam Ghose and Aparna Sen. In 2019, it received the memorabilia of the Indian actor Raj Kapoor for preservation.\nOn June 14, 2024, India Post released a postal Special Cover and cancellation stamp in celebration of the foundation's work in preserving and restoring India's cinematic legacy over a decade. Renowned filmmaker Shyam Benegal, lyricist Gulzar, and the chief postmaster generals of Maharashtra and Mumbai presided over the event.\nIt has partnered with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) for an oral history program covering film heritage in India.\nPreservation and archiving\n;Film collection\nThe foundation currently has around 500 titles (approx. 7500 film reels) on 35&nbsp;mm, 16&nbsp;mm, Super 8 and 8&nbsp;mm formats from the earliest days of cinema and from all regions. Besides feature films, the collections include important historical footage dating from the 1930s and ‘40s, including footage of the freedom movement and rare home movies of the pre-Independence era that are preserved in a temperature-controlled storage facility.\n;Archive of film-related memorabilia\nThe foundation also archives film-related memorabilia like posters, photographs, scripts, lobby cards, song booklets and artefacts of eminent film personalities.\nFilm Restoration\n;Kummatty\nThe FHF collaborated with Martin Scorsese’s The Film Foundation's World Cinema Project and Cineteca di Bologna, to restore celebrated Indian filmmaker Aravindan Govindan’s timeless Malayalam classic film \"Kummatty\" (1979). One of Japan's top film reviewers and scholars, Tadao Sato, described \"Kummatty\" as masterpiece and said he had never seen a more beautiful movie in his entire life. Not only is Aravindan a master, but all of his original camera negatives have been lost, leaving only prints that aren't in the best of shape. As a result, his films have been at the top of FHF's list for restoration.\nShivendra Singh Dungarpur travelled to Kollam, Kerala, in February 2020 to see the movie's producer, Mr. K. Ravindranathan Nair of General Pictures, who graciously agreed to grant authorization for the restoration and allow Film Heritage Foundation access to the prints from the National Film Archive of India (NFAI). The prints at the NFAI were examined by an FHF film conservator, who discovered that they weren't in a great condition. Since the prints were the best elements FHF could discover, they were sent to the L'Immagine Ritrovata lab in Bologna.\nThe lack of an original sound negative and the lab's use of the less-than-ideal sound from the print complicated the restoration process for \"Kummatty\" in this case. We digitised roughly 15 of Ramu Aravindan's father's quarter-inch recordings with his assistance in the hopes of finding better sources, but there were none. The sound experts at the lab were forced to spend numerous hours cleaning up and remastering the sound as a result.\n;Thamp̄\nThe restoration of Aravindan Govindan film Thamp̄ was done by Film Heritage foundation in 2021. It was selected for a world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival 2022.\nIn addition to Prasad Corporation Pvt. Ltd. and Fondazione Cineteca di Bologna, two of FHF's partners, Martin Scorsese's The Film Foundation's World Cinema Project was given permission to restore the movie by General Pictures producer K. Ravindranathan Nair.\nWhen \"Thamp̄\" was restored, the film had tears and damaged sprockets, and because the dupe negative was made from a print, it lacked the latitude that an original camera negative would have. At Chennai's Prasad Studios, the sound and picture were scanned, and hours of physical labour went into the image stabilisation and digital repair of tears and scratches. Cinematographer Shaji N. Karun had shot \"Thamp̄\" in black and white on Indu Stock, an Indian type of film stock made in Ooty. The scanned film needed image stabilisation because the original material was in bad shape and had thick black lines and very blurry images. The outdoor landscapes in the print that FHF worked on were full of high contrast images with very dark blacks and very bright whites and no mid-tones or shadow details.\n;Ishanou\nFilm Heritage Foundation restored the 1990 film Ishanou.\nThe restoration was chosen for a red-carpet global premiere at the Cannes Film Festival's Cannes Classic section in 2023.\n‘Ishanou’ was also screened at the Film Restored - The Film Heritage Festival 2023 in Berlin, Jio MAMI Mumbai Film Festival 2023, Festival des 3 Continents in Nantes and the Singapore International Film Festival 2023.\nRestoration took a year and was difficult. The restoration used the 16 mm camera negative from the National Film Archive of India. The negative was in poor condition when Film Heritage Foundation conservators examined it. The negative had vinegar syndrome decay on reels, mold and warping, broken perforations, scratches, emulsion halos, and base distortion. Film Heritage Foundation conservators worked hard to repair the negative before scanning it with a wet-gate scanner at L'Immagine Ritrovata in Bologna.\nThe real problem was using inter-negative in the original camera negative, which caused grainy image quality and didn't match the rest of the film. We worked on the sound from the two 35 mm prints lying with Aribam Syam Sharma since there was no sound negative. Paradoxically, the film's quietness and Aribam Syam Sharma's music make the sound design so important. The film was shot on 16 mm on a low budget in changing light conditions, causing focus and lighting issues.\n;Manthan\nThe restored version of Indian filmmaker Shyam Benegal’s 1976 masterpiece Manthan (“The Churning”) was selected for a world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival 2024‘s Cannes Classics strand. Third year in a row that Film Heritage Foundation was presenting one of their restorations at the Cannes Film Festival. The film was presented in Cannes by Naseeruddin Shah, the family of the late actress Smita Patil, the daughter of Dr. Verghese Kurien, Dr. Jayen Mehta, Managing Director of Amul and Film Heritage Foundation Director, Shivendra Singh Dungarpur.\nThe film was restored by Film Heritage Foundation at Prasad Corporation Pvt. Ltd.’s Post – Studios, Chennai and L’Immagine Ritrovata Laboratory, in association with Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd. (Amul), the cinematographer Govind Nihalani and the director Shyam Benegal. Manthan fictionalized the beginnings of the dairy cooperative movement in India, inspired by the life of Verghese Kurien. Arguably India’s first crowdfunded film,  5 lakh Gujarati farmers gave Rs. 2 each to fund the making of Manthan.The film, shot in Sanganava, a village 26 miles from Rajkot, Gujarat, stars Girish Karnad, Naseeruddin Shah, Smita Patil, Mohan Agashe, Amrish Puri and Kulbhushan Kharbanda.\nThe film was shot on Gevacolor, Eastman, and Kodak in the 1970s. The original camera negative from the NFAI and a 35 mm print preserved at the Film Heritage Foundation archive were used for the restoration.\nThe film was repaired by FHF conservators. Prasad Lab in Chennai performed scanning and digital clean-up under the supervision of the Bologna-based L'Immagine Ritrovata lab. Shyam Benegal was thrilled to see the full film and said it was better than the original. Director of photography Govind Nihalani was unhappy when he saw the first release prints. He had always said that the result of what he shot did not come out the way he had shot it. He was very pleased with the restored version after watching it. A special premiere of the restored film was held on World Milk Day - June 1, 2024 - at Eros Cinema in Mumbai that was attended by Shyam Benegal and the cast and crew of the film. The screening was preceded by a conversation with Shyam Benegal, Naseeruddin Shah, Kulbhushan Kharbanda, Abha Dhulia, Shama Zaidi and Prahlad Kakkar moderated by Shivendra Singh Dungarpur. The film was released in 51 cities and 101 cinemas across India on June 1 and 2, 2024.\n;Ghatashraddha\nGirish Kasaravalli’s 'Ghatashraddha’ (1977) is being restored by Film Heritage Foundation and is supported by the Scorsese-founded The Film Foundation’s World Cinema Project with funding provided by George Lucas and his wife Mellody Hobson’s Hobson/Lucas Family Foundation. The restoration is done at L’Immagine Ritrovata in Bologna, Italy. The source for the restoration is the original negative preserved at the National Film Development Corporation-National Film Archive of India.\n;Maya Miriga\nNirad Mohapatra's \"Maya Miriga\" is a notable film in Odia cinema history, launching regional cinema to national and international recognition. However, the film and filmmaker have since faded from the Indian feature film landscape. Film Heritage Foundation restored the forgotten gem, which was in poor condition.\nFilm Heritage Foundation restored it at L'Immagine Ritrovata laboratory, Digital Film Restore Pvt. Ltd. digitally restored it, and Prasad Corporation Pvt. Ltd.'s Post-Studios scanned it in conjunction with Nirad Mohapatra's family Film Heritage Foundation funding. Māyā Miriga was restored using the 16 mm camera negative from Film Heritage Foundation and a 35 mm print from NFDC-National Film Archive of India.\nThe Film Heritage Foundation found the original camera negative abandoned in a warehouse in poor condition with parts of the film missing. The restoration was difficult. The 35 mm print also deteriorated. Colors faded to magenta and the image was grainy and blurry. The nearly three-year restoration required hours of film repair, digital restoration, and color grading.\nFilm programming and film festivals\nBachchan Back to the Beginning Film Festival\nFrom October 8 to October 11, 2022, 11 Amitabh Bachchan blockbusters screened as part of the \"Bachchan Back to the Beginning\" festival in 17 Indian cities and 22 theaters, ranging from large cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad to smaller towns like Ahmedabad, Surat, Baroda, Raipur, Kanpur, Kolhapur, Prayagraj, and Indore.\nAudiences across the country had the opportunity to see the icon back on the big screen in his landmark films including: Don, Kaala Patthar, Kaalia, Kabhi Kabhie, Amar Akbar Anthony, Namak Halaal, Abhimaan, Deewar, Mili, Satte Pe Satta and Chupke Chupke.\nAmitabh Bachchan Retrospectives Around the World\nIn 2023, FHF's \"Bachchan Back to the Beginning\" retrospective traveled to Australia and France.
