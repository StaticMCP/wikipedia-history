She was the mother of King Jeongjong and King Taejong.\nShe was firstly given the title of Consort Chŏl () in 1393. After her second son (Yi Bang-gwa) became king, she was posthumously honored as Queen Sinŭi (). In 1899, after the founding of the Korean Empire, she was elevated as Sinŭi, the Dignified Empress ().\nBiography\nEarly life\nThe future Queen Sinŭi was born during King Chungsuk of Goryeo's 5th year of reign on 6 October 1337. Born into the Cheongju Han clan, Lady Han was the fifth child within ten siblings to Han Gyeong and his wife, Lady Sin of the Sangnyeong Shin clan.\nIn some sources, she is noted as a member of the Anbyeon Han clan, which was founded by Han Ryŏn (), a ninth-generation descendant of Han Ran (), the progenitor of the Cheongju Han clan.\nMarriage and later life\nIn 1351, when she was 15 years old, she was arranged to marry Yi Sŏnggye who was two years older than her. She later gave birth to six sons and two daughters from 1354 to the 1370s. While Yi Sŏnggye (later Yi Tan) was traveling through the battlefield, Lady Han took care of the household affairs in his hometown and helped out.\nDuring the Goryeo Dynasty, aristocratic men were allowed two wives; one wife was known as the ''kyŏngch'ŏ (), the capital wife, while the other wife was known as the hyangch'ŏ (), the countryside wife. In Kaegyŏng (modern-day Kaeseong), Yi Sŏnggye welcomed Lady Kang, a daughter of Kang Yun-seong, from the noble Goksan Kang clan, as his second (kyŏngch'ŏ'') wife in 1370. Lady Kang would later become Queen Hyeon.\nIn 1388, during the 14th year of King U of Goryeo's reign, Lady Han stayed in Jaebyeok-dong, Pocheon, and fled back to Dongbuk-myeon with her children and remaining family under the guidance of her fifth son Yi Pangwŏn. This eventually led her to be concerned about the threat of her life and she later died on 25 November 1391 at the age of 54. Her tomb is called Chenŭng and is located in present-day Kaesong, North Korea.\nPost-death\nA year after Lady Han's death, her husband established the Joseon period; thus having her husband become king and her children become princes and princesses.\nDuring King Taejo's 2nd year of reign in 1393, she was posthumously given the title of Queen Chŏl (). In 1398, during the first year of reign of her second eldest son, King Jeongjong, Lady Han was honored as Queen Sinŭi ().\nAfter the death of Queen Hyeon in 1396, Queen Sinŭi's fifth son, Yi Pangwŏn, eventually led a coup d'etat with his wife, Princess Jeongnyeong's encouragement, while King Taejo was in mourning for his second wife. This event led to the deaths of Chŏng Tojŏn and his supporters, as well as the late Queen Sindeok's two sons: Yi Pangbŏn, Grand Prince Muan and Yi Pangsŏk, Grand Prince Uian. This incident became known as the First Strife of Princes.\nFamily\n*Father: Han Kyŏng, Internal Prince Ancheon (; 1300–?)\n*Mother: Grand Lady of Samhan State of the Sangnyeong Shin clan (; 1303–?)\n*Sibling(s):\n** Older sister: Lady Han of the Cheongju Han clan (; 1322–?)\n** Older sister: Lady Han of the Cheongju Han clan (; 1326–?)\n** Older sister: Lady Han of the Cheongju Han clan (; 1328–?)\n** Older sister: Lady Han of the Cheongju Han clan (; 1330–?)\n** Brother: Han Sŏnggi, Prince Ansan ()\n** Brother: Han Kŏm, Duke Yangjŏng, Prince Ancheon ()\n** Brother: Han Ch'angsu, Duke Yangjŏng, Prince Anwŏn ()\n** Brother: Han Kŭmgang ()\n** Brother: Han Yungjŏn ()\n*Husband: Yi Sŏnggye, King Taejo of Joseon (; 27 October 1335 – 18 June 1408)\n**Father-in-law: King Hwanjo of Joseon (; 20 January 1315 – 3 June 1361)\n**Mother-in-law: Queen Uihye of the Yeongheung Choe clan (; 1304–?)\nIssue(s):\n*Son: Yi Pangu, Grand Prince Chinan (; 1354 – 15 January 1394)\n*Son: Yi Panggwa, Grand Prince Yŏngan (; 18 July 1357 – 15 October 1419)\n*Son: Yi Pangŭi, Grand Prince Igan (; 1360 – 26 September 1404)\n*Daughter: Princess Kyŏngsin (; 1362 – 29 April 1426)\n*Son: Yi Panggan, Grand Prince Hoean (; 2 July 1364 – 10 April 1421)\n*Son: Yi Pangwŏn, Grand Prince Chŏngan (; 13 June 1367 – 30 May 1422)\n*Son: Yi Pangyŏn, Grand Prince Tŏgan (; 1370–1385)\n*Daughter: Princess Kyŏngsŏn (; 1372–?)\nIn popular culture\n* Portrayed by Tae Hyun-shil in the 1983 KBS TV series Foundation of the Kingdom.\n* Portrayed by Kim So-won in the 1983 MBC TV series The King of Chudong Palace.\n* Portrayed by Han Young-Sook in the 1996 KBS TV series Tears of the Dragon.\n* Portrayed by Lee Duk-hee in the 2021 KBS1 TV series The King of Tears, Lee Bang-won.\nNotes\nReferences"
