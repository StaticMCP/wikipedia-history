He taught at The Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia and at the Mannes College of Music in New York City.\nAs a theorist, he was an expert in Schenkerian analysis, and he was the co-author (with Carl Schachter) of one of the standard theory textbooks used throughout the United States, Harmony and Voice Leading (first published in 1979). While driving an all-terrain vehicle, on May 7, 2006, near his country home in Kerhonkson, New York, he suffered serious injuries when it overturned. He died from those injuries in Valhalla, New York, three weeks later.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.aldwell.com The Edward Aldwell Center in Jerusalem]"
