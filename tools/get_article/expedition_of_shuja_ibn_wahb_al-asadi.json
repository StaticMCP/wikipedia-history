The Muslims drove away their camels and sheep as booty.\nEach soldier obtained 15 camels or the equivalent in sheep as a reward, and according to scholars at the King Abdul Aziz University in Saudi Arabia, this implied that the booty had 450 camels or their equivalent, and so, the total, including the khumus should have had the value of about 18,000 dirhams.\nSee also\n*Military career of Muhammad\n*List of expeditions of Muhammad\nNotes"
