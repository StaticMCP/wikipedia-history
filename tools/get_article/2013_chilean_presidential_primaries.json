It was the first such election to be run by the government under a new primary law published in December 2012.\nAccording to the law, primaries are voluntary, but its results are binding. The two main political coalitions decided to participate: Former president Michelle Bachelet won the Nueva Mayoría primary with 73% of the vote, while former senator and minister Pablo Longueira won the Alianza primary with 51%.\nLongueira withdrew on 17 July and was replaced by Evelyn Matthei, who had not participated in the primaries. Bachelet defeated Matthei in the runoff election held on 15 December 2013.\nCandidates\nAlianza candidates\nBoth candidates were officially registered on 1 May 2013. Affiliates from both Alianza parties (RN and UDI) plus independent electors were allowed to vote.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"125\" | Candidate !!
