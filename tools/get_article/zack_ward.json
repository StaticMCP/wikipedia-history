In the 2020s, Ward reprised his Christmas Story role as Scut Farkus in the film's sequel, A Christmas Story Christmas (2022).\nEarly life\nWard was born on August 31 in either 1970 or 1973 in Toronto, Ontario, the son of actress Pam Hyatt and Todd Allen Ward.\nCareer\nHe is best known for his character Dave Scoville (Titus's stoner half-brother) on the FOX show Titus and as the bully Scut Farkus in the 1983 Christmas classic A Christmas Story. He has had guest roles on popular television series such as NCIS, Lost, and Crossing Jordan, and roles in films such as Almost Famous, Transformers, and Anne of Green Gables.

Pictures and HBO Max (now Max).\nPersonal life\nOn August 18, 2018, Ward married actress and producer, Jennifer McMahan.\nLitigation\nIn August 2011, Ward sued Warner Bros. over merchandising for A Christmas Story'' after Warner Bros. authorized a figurine set including the Scut Farkus character from the film without Ward's permission.  It was revealed that Ward's contract was under ACTRA, unlike the other actors' contracts, and did not grant likeness rights for merchandising. Warner Bros. argued that the figurine showed a \"generic face\" that has been used on them since 2006 and that statute of limitations had run out, among other claims.  The lawsuit was dismissed in January 2012 by mutual agreement.\nIn December 2012, Ward sued the National Entertainment Collectibles Association, and briefly Warner Bros. again, over his image after attending the annual Christmas Story charity fundraiser convention in Cleveland in November 2010 where a fan handed him a Christmas Story board game, playing cards, and calendar showing his face. The lawsuit was settled three days later.\nFilmography\nFilm\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Year\n! Title\n!
