The last major redrafting came in 1991, but this version was further changed by the Sahrawi National Council — the SADR's parliament in exile — in 1995 and 1999.\nThe constitution provides for a separation of powers between judicial, legislative, and executive branches. It names Arabic as the national language and Islam as the state religion, and grants every citizen freedom of speech and the right to property. It further determines that an independent Western Sahara will be a multiparty democracy with a market economy. Presently, however, the constitution ties the SADR to the Polisario Front, which is working to establish an independent Western Sahara. For example, the Secretary General of the Polisario Front (now Brahim Ghali) is constitutionally identical to the President of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, until the achievement of independence.\nThis is because the constitution differentiates between before and after the Western Sahara is independent. Thus, several clauses will not come into effect until the proclamation of independence, and various changes in the political order will then occur (see e.g. articles 9, 10, 30, 31, 45). Among other things, the constitution details a transitional phase after independence has been declared (see articles 130–133, Chapter Three [http://arso.org/03-const.99.htm]) in which the POLISARIO is detached from the republic and transformed into a political party among others. As such, the SADR remains a dominant-party system.\nFor information on the institutions and elections that are regulated in the constitution of the SADR, see here and here. For information on the political institutions of the Polisario Front, see here.\nPreamble\nThe following is an English translation of the 1999 version preamble of the Constitution of the SADR.\nGeneral principles\nThe following is an English translation of the 1999 version General principles of the Constitution of the SADR.\n* 1st Chapter: Saguia el-Hamra y Rio de Oro\n:: Art. 1: Western Sahara in its internationally recognized borders is an indivisible democratic republic, named Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR).\n:: Art. 2: Islam is the state religion and law origin.\n:: Art. 3: Arabic language is the official national language.\n:: Art. 4: The capital of the country is El Aaiun.\n:: Art. 5: The flag, national anthem, and SADR's coat of arms are defined by law.\n* 2nd Chapter: People\n:: Art. 6: The Sahrawi people is an Arab, African and Muslim people.\n:: Art. 7: The family is the base of the society, funded on the values of Islam and ethics.\n:: Art. 8: The sovereignty belong to the people, which is the origin of any power.\n:: Art. 9 & 10: The people exercises its constitutional sovereignty through their representatives elected by them in the congresses, until the culmination of SADR's sovereignty over all national territory.\n:: Art. 11: The people elect their institutions to preserve their identity and values, defend national unity and independence, and guarantee respect to the human rights as the ones defined in the constitution.\n:: Art. 12: The people's institutions belong to the people.
