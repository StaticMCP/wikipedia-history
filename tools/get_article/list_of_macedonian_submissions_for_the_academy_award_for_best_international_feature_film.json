The International Feature Film award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. It was not created until the 1956 Academy Awards, in which a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since.\nAs of 2025, North Macedonia has been nominated twice, for: Before the Rain (1994) and Honeyland (2019).\nIn 1991, the country attempted unsuccessfully to submit a film, while they were in the process of trying to achieve international recognition as an independent state. Prior to independence, Macedonian filmmakers were active participants in the Yugoslavian film industry, and several films made by Macedonian filmmakers were submitted for Oscar consideration as part of Yugoslavia. The last instance of this was Stole Popov's ''Happy New Year '49 in 1987.\nMacedonian director Milcho Manchevski has had four of his films submitted for the [[Academy Award for Best International Feature Film]]\nSubmissions\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award.\nMilcho Manchevski had four films selected to represent the country, the most for any filmmaker.\nMacedonia filmmaker Teona Strugar Mitevska had two films selected to represent the country in 2008 and 2022. While Tamara Kotevska had two documentary feature films selected in 2019 and 2025, and was nominated for Honeyland.\nBelow is a list of the films that have been submitted by North Macedonia for review by the Academy for the award by year and the respective Academy Awards ceremony.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!
