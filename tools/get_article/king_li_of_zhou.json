Estimated dates of his reign are 877–841 BC or 857–842 BC (Cambridge History of Ancient China).\n, Taipei]]\nSima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian depict King Li as a corrupt and decadent king. To pay for his pleasures and vices, King Li raised taxes and caused misery among his subjects. It is said that he barred the commoners from profiting from the communal forests and lakes. He enstated a new law which allowed him to punish anyone, by death, who dared to speak against him. King Li's bad rule soon forced many peasants and soldiers into revolt, and Li was sent into exile at a place called Zhi near Linfen (842 BC). His son was taken by one of his ministers and hidden.\nWhen Li died in exile in 828 BC, power was passed to his son.\nShen Dao fragments\nThe Shen Dao fragments also depict King Li as a decadent and corrupt king. The fragments say:\nFamily\nQueens:\n* Shen Jiang, of the Jiang clan of Shen (), a sister of the Count of Shen; the mother of Crown Prince Jing and You\nSons:\n* Crown Prince Jing (; d. 782 BC), ruled as King Xuan of Zhou from 827 to 782 BC\n* Prince You (; d. 771 BC), ruled as Duke Huan of Zheng from 806 to 771 BC\n** Served as the Minister of Education of Zhou from 773 to 771 BC\nSee also\n* Family tree of Chinese monarchs (ancient)\nSources"
