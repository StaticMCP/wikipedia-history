The team won the gold medal, defeating New Zealand 2–0 in the final.\nEdwards has also been involved in several comedy projects. In 2007 he was part of the sketch comedy group Klarence Komedy, who released a sketch comedy CD titled \"Komedy That Lasts\". The group were threatened with defamation of character after the release of the album but the matter was eventually settled out of court. In 2015 they released their second album \"The Reunion\".\nEdwards also had a promising Indoor Cricket career. His most well known moment was the infamous final over vs Marlo Bros in the 2020 Oakleigh Indoor semi-final. With Marlo Bros requiring 14 off 1 delivery, victory seemed all but assured, however the pressure seemingly got to Jeremy as he delivered a front foot no ball resulting in 7 runs. In typical Edwards fashion he was able to gather himself and responded with an absolute peach of a delivery to send Luke's Legends through to the grand final. What followed is arguably the greatest 'what if' in sporting history. The 2020 Covid pandemic saw the grand final cancelled, never to be rescheduled. Riding a 12 game win streak and with Edwards at the helm, a dynasty loomed for Luke's Legends, but was over before it even began.\nReferences\nExternal links"
