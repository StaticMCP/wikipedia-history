Elgar originally set the poem to an orchestral accompaniment but, due to a change of plan, the accompaniment was hurriedly re-arranged by Captain Andrew Harris of the Welsh Guards so it could be played by a military band.\nThe day chosen for the unveiling of the memorial by the King  was Alexandra Rose Day. At the beginning of the ceremony outside Marlborough House, Elgar, wearing magnificent robes, conducted the chorister children of the Chapels Royal, the choir of Westminster Abbey, and the band of the Guards in a performance of the Ode.\nThe orchestra and band parts have since been lost.  The only manuscript of the work is in the Library of St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle: a vocal score handwritten by the composer, which includes indications of the orchestral instrumentation.\nThe music\nThe work starts with a short fanfare-like figure, followed by a lengthy prelude by the orchestra (or band) before the choir enters, unaccompanied, with the words \"So many true princesses who have gone\".  It is notable that though the work is in the key of E-flat it ends in the subdominant key of B-flat, giving a feeling of incompleteness: it is not known if the composer had intended to extend the work or if the effect was intentional. However the effect of the whole is of appropriate simplicity and wistfulness, and seems to ask for delicacy of instrumentation.\nThere are four verses of four lines, and the performing time is about six minutes.\nLyrics\nThe lyrics to the song were written by John Masefield.\nSo many true princesses who have gone\nOver the sea, as love or duty bade,\nTo share abroad, till Death a foreign throne,\nHave given all things, and been ill repaid.\nHatred has followed them and bitter days.\nBut this most lovely woman and loved Queen\nFilled all the English nation with her praise;\nWe gather now to keep her memory green.\nHere, at this place, she often sat to mark\nThe tide of London life go roaring by,\nThe day-long multitude, the lighted dark,\nThe night-long wheels, the glaring in the sky.\nNow here we set memorial of her stay,\nThat passers-by remember with a thrill:\n\"This lovely princess came from far away\nAnd won our hearts, and lives within them still\".\nRevival and recordings\n* Choir and piano: So many true princesses who have gone (Queen Alexandra Memorial Ode) and other music by Elgar, performed by Barry Collett (piano) and Tudor Choir.
