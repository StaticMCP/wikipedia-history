The play is based on Thomas Wolfe's 1929 largely autobiographical novel of the same title.\nProduction\nLook Homeward, Angel opened on Broadway at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre on November 28, 1957, and ran for a total of 564 performances, closing on April 4, 1959. Directed by George Roy Hill, the cast starred Jo Van Fleet (who replaced Bette Davis during rehearsals after Davis broke her back at her home) and Anthony Perkins.\nKetti Frings won the 1958 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award. The production received Tony Award nominations for Best Play; Best Actor in a Play (Hugh Griffith and Anthony Perkins); Best Actress in a Play (Jo Van Fleet); Best Scenic Design (Jo Mielziner); Best Costume Design (Motley); and Best Director (George Roy Hill).\nJohn Drew Barrymore was to co-star with Miriam Hopkins in the tour of Look Homeward, Angel, which was set to open in Wilmington, Delaware, on October 21, 1959, but Barrymore, who was said to be suffering from a skin infection and was underweight, quit the touring company during rehearsals. He was replaced by Jonathan Bolt.\nSynopsis\nLook Homeward, Angel traces the coming of age of Eugene Gant, as well as the lives of his family members.  It takes place in the town of Altamont, North Carolina.  Eugene's mother, Eliza, runs a boarding house, \"Dixieland\", where boarders often interact with and affect the lives of the Gants.  His father, William Oliver, runs a marble sculpture shop, where his prized possession, a statue of an angel, is kept.\nThe play begins by showing life in the boarding house when a young woman, Laura enters and requests to stay there.  Gant enters drunk, but is eventually helped by his daughter, Helen.  The next scene sees Eugene and his brother, Ben, discussing life and love.  Eugene meets Laura, and they appear to fall in love, though Eugene lies about his age, claiming to be older.  Eliza and Gant fight over the matter of selling his shop and the angel statue.  Eliza enters the boarding house and begins arguing with Ben, cumulating in her slapping him.  The next scene, days later, sees Gant and Eugene working in his shop.  Laura enters to confront Eugene about the truth—she has lied about her age and he has as well.  Eliza enters, ready to sell Gant's shop, until he at last announces that rather than use the money for Dixieland's expenses, he would take the money, put Gene in college, and begin traveling.  Eliza rips up his check in a fit of fury and exits.  Immediately following, Ben falls ill.  He is then seen on his deathbed, where he dies.\nThe third act opens with Eugene and Laura in their bedroom.\nOpening night cast\n*Hugh Griffith as W.O.
