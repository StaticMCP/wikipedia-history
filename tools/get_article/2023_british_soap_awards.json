The ceremony was held on 3 June 2023 at the Lowry theatre in Salford Quays, Salford, and was broadcast on ITV1, ITVX and STV three days later. The publicly voted categories were announced on 11 April 2023, with the vote opening that same day. This included a longlist for the Best Leading Performer accolade, which included five cast members from each respective soap. Viewers could also vote for Villain of the Year for the first time since 2014, as well as being able to vote for Best Young Performer for the first time. The shortlist, including panel nominations, was released on 2 May 2023, alongside tickets for the ceremony being made available for sale.\nPhillip Schofield, who hosted the British Soap Awards since 2006, garnered media attention when he admitted to having an extramarital affair with a male ITV employee more than 30 years his junior and to lying about the relationship to ITV's management, his colleagues, his lawyers, his agents and others. He subsequently announced his decision to step down from the role a week prior to the ceremony. Jane McDonald was announced as his replacement. Despite him being replaced by McDonald, protestors against Schofield stood amongst attendees at the barriers of the Lowry with posters about him and ITV.\nBBC soap EastEnders won all four viewer-voted categories including Best British Soap, while ITV soap Coronation Street won the majority of panel-voted awards. Emmerdale actor Mark Charnock won the British Soap Award for Outstanding Achievement for 27 years of appearing as Marlon Dingle. Hollyoaks casting director Peter Hunt won the Tony Warren award, while Doctors stars Jan Pearson and Chris Walker won the Best On-Screen Partnership accolade after 14 years of appearing alongside each other.\nWinners and nominees\nPublicly voted\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
