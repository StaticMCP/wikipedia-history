In this treaty, both parties acknowledged that the border had been fully demarcated, differences over boundary matters were completed, and recognized the work carried out by the 1901 Demarcation Committee and the Swiss experts Committee as valid demarcation. The exchange of ratifications of this agreement was made in Caracas, on September 12, 1941.\nThe land border between Colombia and Venezuela is a conflict zone of perennial tension between the two countries, due to problems such as Illegal drug trade, smuggling or illegal trade, the presence of high-risk diseases that often spread on both sides of the boundary lines, and the presence of the Colombian guerrillas.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.efemeridesvenezolanas.com/html/de_1941.htm Efemérides venezolanas (the treaty text is at the bottom of the page)]"
