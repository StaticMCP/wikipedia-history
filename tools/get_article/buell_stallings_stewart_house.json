The house was built in 1874 by a local lawyer David Buell, who later sold it to U. S. Congressman Jesse F. Stallings. Stallings sold the house to A. Graham Stewart, a local merchant, in 1901. The house is built in a Carpenter Gothic style, rare in Alabama, and features a steeply sloped roof and several sharply pointed gables and dormers. A flat-roofed, octagonal porch projects over the front entry. Each window and door is topped with a decorative Gothic arch molding with a diamond in the middle.  The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.\nReferences"
