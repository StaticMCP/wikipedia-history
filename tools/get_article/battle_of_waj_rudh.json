The battle was fought in Waj Rudh, a village in Hamadan. The location was precisely theorized and occurred on a road junction between Hamadan and Qazvin.\nThe Sasanians were defeated under heavy casualties, which included the death of Muta and Varaztirots. According to Tabari, the scale of the battle was said to have rivalled the battle of Nahavand, As according to G. Rex Smith, this means Waj al-Rudh was the greatest calamity of Sassanid after Nahavand and battle of al-Qadisiyyah.\nReferences\nSources\n*"
