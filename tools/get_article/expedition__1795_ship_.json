She entered the registers as Expedition in 1795. Between 1799 and 1807, she made seven voyages as a Liverpool-based slave ship in the triangular trade in enslaved people. She was condemned as unseaworthy at Antigua in early 1808, after having earlier disembarked at Jamaica the captives from her seventh voyage.\nCareer\nExpedition first appeared in ''Lloyd's Register (LR) in 1795. A later listing in the Register of Shipping included the note that the repairs in 1793 had included lengthening.\nLloyd's List reported in November 1795 that Expedition, Smith, master, had put into Ramsgate due to leaks. She was coming from Oporto.\n{| class=\" wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Master\n! Owner\n! Trade\n!

Expedition was condemned there. Her cargo was transshipped in Fairfield and King George.\nExpedition does not appear in the most comprehensive list of losses of vessels engaged in transporting enslaved people, perhaps because the Lloyd's List'' news item did not identify her as a Guineaman, or perhaps because the loss may have occurred in early 1808. Still. during the period 1793 to 1807, war, rather than maritime hazards or resistance by the captives, was the greatest cause of vessel losses among British enslaving vessels.\nCitations\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*"
