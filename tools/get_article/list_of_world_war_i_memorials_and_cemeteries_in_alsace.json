Alsace saw heavy fighting and the loss of life during World War I, as the Western front cut through the area. Because of this, there are several memorials and cemeteries dedicated to those who lost their lives in the area during the war.\nBackground\nAlsace comprises the départements of Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin, the Western Front passed through Haut-Rhin. The largest of the battles fought in the area during World War I were the Battle of Mulhouse and the Battle of Hartmannswillerkopf.\nList of cemeteries and memorials\nMonument in the French cemetery at Lapoutroie\n]]\nLapoutroie's war cemetery is the site of one of the many monuments to the chasseurs in Alsace.\nThe Col du Bonhomme\nOn 12 August 1939 a memorial was unveiled to commemorate those killed in a German artillery bombardment in the Col du Bonhomme on 8 September 1914, including several senior officers and the commander of the 41st Infantry Division, General .\nLa Tête des Faux\nAt the top of the Tête des Faux there are the remains of a French look-out post and a small memorial which, translated, reads:\nIn the pass that separates the two peaks of the Têtes des Faux is the cemetery at Duchesne. It contains the remains of 292 French soldiers in individual graves and another 116 who rest in an ossuary. The bodies here were brought in from Stosswihr, Orbey, Soultzeren and the Col du Bonhomme. In this cemetery there is a monument with the inscriptions (translated):\nand  Duchesne had been killed in the December 1914 assault on the Têtes des Faux at Grimaude.\nThe \"Croix de Wihr\"\nThis monument commemorates the advance of the 152nd French Infantry Division on 19 August 1914 and marks the furthest point reached by the French army in Alsace during the 1914-1918 war. The 152nd were nicknamed the \"Diables Rouges\", or \" Red Devils\".\nThe Linge Memorial and the Cimetière des Chasseurs\nThe front line in early 1915 ran north of the Col de Wettstein.

This cemetery holds 2,201 individual graves with the remains of another 1,334 men lying in two ossuaries. Bodies here were brought in from Lingekopf, Barenkopf, Schratzmännele and the Valley de la Fecht as well as from Stosswihr, Soultzeren, Muhlbach, Hohrod, les Trois-Epis and Orbey. The main Linge Memorial is located in this cemetery and is dedicated to those who fought in the Battle of Linge.\nThe memorial is dominated by a large cross with the word \"PAX\" (\"peace\") inscribed at the centre. The original wooden cross is set into the cross further down and the body of a chasseur lies at its foot. It also bears the inscription \"AUX MORTS DU LINGE\" (\"to the dead of Linge\"). Beneath the sculpture of the soldier is a plaque reading \"Les Diables Rouges du 15-2 aux Diables Bleus tombés en Alsace\" (\"From the Diables Rouges of 152e to the Diables Bleus who fell in Alsace\").\nThe main memorial dedicated to this battle is to be found in this cemetery. It depicts a dead chasseur lying prostrate beneath a large cross. A young officer in the chasseurs had made a wooden cross from some pine trees damaged by gunfire and this was replaced at a later stage by a cross carved from granite. It was inaugurated by General Maurice Gamelin in 1939. The original wooden cross has been kept and is fixed to the monument with the inscription (translated):\nApart from the main memorial to the dead of the Linge fighting there are other memorials in the area dedicated to individual units.\nMemorials by the Linge Museum\n]]\nJust by the museum at Linge there is a monument whose inscription dedicates it to the \"10,000 French dead whose blood stained this land.\" Around the memorial, white crosses indicate points were bodies were found and exhumed.\nThe memorial museum at Linge was built between 1973 and 1981 by an association called the \"Mémorial du Linge\".

The original single monument was erected in 1927 but was dynamited by the Germans in July 1940 during World War II. The first memorial comprises a small pedestal with a bronze depicting the typical oversized beret worn by the chasseurs perched on the top. This beret was retrieved from the original monument. A plaque fixed to the monument explains that the land was given to the Club Alpin Francais by the town of Soultz out of gratitude to those who helped France secure the return of Alsace and Lorraine. A second plaque states that the memorial is dedicated to the \"Diables Bleus\" (Blue Devils) which was the nickname of the 66th Bataillon of Chasseurs.
