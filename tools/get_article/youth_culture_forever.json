Experimenting with new instruments in overdubbing for a touch of depth.\" He told Spin that \"before we just went in and blasted the songs out. But this time it’s been nice to think about placements and stuff.\" Taylor's vocals were intentionally muffled by recording them on a Talkboy.\nYouth Culture Forever was released on CD and LP by FatCat Records on 2 June 2014. In Japan, the album was released on Thomason Sounds, and included the 2012 EP Misled Youth as bonus tracks.
