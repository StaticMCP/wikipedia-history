      "text": "# Draft:Empire of Norea\n\nNorea, officially the Empire of Norea, is a self-proclaimed micronation located in Southeast Asia. It currently has no territory yet. Despite this, Norea strongly emphasizes principles of monarchism, neutrality, and unity. The micronation promotes values such as peace, prosperity, development, safety, freedom, and diplomatic relations.\nHistory\nCarter, the founder of Norea, initially intended to establish the state as a kingdom. However, he later chose the title of “Empire” in order to distinguish it from many other micronations that already styled themselves as kingdoms.\nThe Empire of Norea was founded on 29 March 2025 by Carter as a community-based micronation in Cambodia. At first, Norea was briefly declared independent, but following criticism from members of the Khmer public and in light of regional sensitivities (2025 Cambodia–Thailand border conflict), Carter redefined the project as a symbolic, community-based micronation with no claim to independence. From that point onward, Norea developed as a space for roleplay, collaborative governance, and educational activities, with most of its engagement taking place online.\nTo reinforce its symbolic character, Carter temporarily relocated Norea’s claimed territory into a virtual format. A custom map was created within the video game WorldBox, while the Discord server became the primary platform for communication, roleplay, and administration.\nDuring this period, Carter also developed Norea’s governmental framework by establishing five core ministries: the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Internal Order, the Ministry of the Imperial Treasury, the Ministry of Culture and Heritage, and the Ministry of Education. He also began drafting a constitution and sought relations with other micronations.\nReferences"
