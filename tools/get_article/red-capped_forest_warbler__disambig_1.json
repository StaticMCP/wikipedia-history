It is found in Mozambique and Tanzania. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane forests from 1600 to 2500 m.\nTaxonomy\nThe red-capped forest warbler was formally described in 1907 by the German ornithologist Anton Reichenow from a specimen collected in the Usambara Mountains of Tanzania. Reichenow coined the binomial name Prinia metopias. The specific epithet is from the Ancient Greek metōpias meaning \"having a high forehead\". This warbler is now placed with the long-billed forest warbler in the genus Artisornis that was introduced in 1928 by the American ornithologist Herbert Friedmann.\nTwo subspecies are recognised:\n* A. m. metopias (Reichenow, 1907) – northeast Tanzania to northwest Mozambique\n* A. m. altus (Friedmann, 1927) – Uluguru Mountains (east Tanzania)\nDescription\nThe red-capped forest warbler is olive-brown above with a whitish color from the center of the throat to the vent, and with flanks that are washed grey. The crown is a rich chestnut brown, as well as the ear-coverts and the sides of the neck.  Immature individuals have a pale yellow wash on their undersides. The average adult is 10&nbsp;cm long and has a mass of approximately 8.4 g.\nReferences"
