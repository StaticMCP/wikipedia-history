With roots in an EPSRC-funded Interdisciplinary Research Centre in Biomedical Materials, the Centre is dedicated to “Engineering Better Medicine”, focusing on cutting-edge biomedical engineering solutions. It encourages collaboration between academic researchers and external industry partners to drive innovation in bioengineering. The Centre builds upon Queen Mary's legacy in bioengineering and biomaterials, tracing back to foundational research activities supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC).\nLeadership and People\nThe Centre is led by Professor Zion Tse, a Royal Society Wolfson Fellow and Academy of Medical Sciences Professor, serving as Head of the Centre. Additional leadership roles include:\n* Professor [https://www.seresearch.qmul.ac.uk/bioengineering/people/khing/ Karin Hing] – Education Lead\n* Professor [https://www.seresearch.qmul.ac.uk/bioengineering/people/tiskratsch/ Thomas Iskratsch] – Industry Lead\n* Dr [https://www.seresearch.qmul.ac.uk/bioengineering/people/croney/ Caroline Roney] – Research Lead\nThe Centre’s broader academic team spans diverse expertise areas such as tissue engineering, mechanobiology, bioelectronics, regenerative medicine, computational medicine, robotics, and biointerfaces.\nResearch Themes & Facilities\nKey research areas include:\n* Organ-on-a-chip systems\n* AI-driven cardiac modelling\n* Biomaterials and biointerfaces\n* Mechanobiology and tissue regeneration\n* Computational models and digital twin technologies\n* Robotics, mechatronics, and bioelectronics in medical applications\nFacilities support advanced imaging and modelling techniques, high-fidelity mechanobiological testing, and translational tools such as organ-on-chip platforms.\nCentres for Doctoral Training (CDT):\n* EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Organ-on-a-Chip technologies (COaCT)\nEducation & Impact\nThe Centre contributes to broader educational objectives through postgraduate and undergraduate programmes, integrating modern bioengineering methodologies into student training. Queen Mary students benefit from the Centre’s facilities, including mechanobiology labs and the Organs-on-Chips Centre.\nEvents & News\nThe Centre organises and participates in scientific events such as the UK Organ-on-a-Chip Symposium and the BioMedEng24 Conference.\nRecent news includes:\n* Hosting global research discussions like EnFI2025\n* Securing MRC funding for developing human tendon-on-a-chip technologies\n* Winning a £1.2 million British Heart Foundation programme grant\nContact and Location\nLocated within the School of Engineering and Materials Science, Mile End Road, London E1 4NS, United Kingdom\nReferences"
