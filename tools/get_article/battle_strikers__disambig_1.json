The toyline was released in 2009 by MagNext Toys and Megabloks from Mega Brands.\nGameplay\nTwo players each use one assembled top. The top is placed in the bottom of the launcher. A button on the grip is pressed to spin the top, while another on top releases it. Each player additionally has a device that fits over two fingers which can be used to manipulate the tops through magnetism. The winner is the last player whose top is left spinning inside the arena. The system was later updated to use a ripcord launcher with the magnet inside an extension, simplifying the game somewhat.\nSystem\nBooster: The Booster is used to modify your Striker's behavior. Make it spin longer, or easier to control, or better balance.\nCore: The Core of the Striker contains the powerful magnet that is used to control the striker.\nLock: The Lock holds the Striker together.\nOther tops\n* Beyblade\n* Battling Tops\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090803165132/http://www.battlestrikers.com/ Official website]"
