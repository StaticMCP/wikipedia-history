      "text": "# Edward Sherman Gould\n\nEdward Sherman Gould (May 11, 1808 Litchfield, Connecticut &ndash; February 21, 1885 New York City) was a nineteenth-century American writer and critic.\nBiography\nHe was the son of jurist James Gould, and an early contributor of tales to the Knickerbocker Magazine, to the New World, the Mirror, The Literary World, and other journals. His signature of \"Cassio\" in Charles King's American was at one time well-known.\nIn 1830 he lectured before the New York Mercantile Library Association on \"American Criticism in American Literature\". In his talk, he opposed the prevalent spirit of overflowing praise as injurious to the interests of the country.\nHis examination of correct use of English is the subject of several of his books, such as, Good English, or Popular Errors in Language (1867). At the time, there was great interest among many Victorian authors about the Germanic origin, evolution, and proper use of English, among criticism that continues into contemporary times.\nWorks\nTranslations:\n* Alexandre Dumas, Travels in Egypt and Arabia Petraea (1839)\n* Dupré, Progress of Democracy (1841)\n* Honoré de Balzac, Eugénie Grandet (1841)\n* Honoré de Balzac, Père Goriot (1842)\n* Alexandre Dumas, Impressions of Travel in Switzerland\n* Victor Hugo, Handsome Pecopin\n* A.
