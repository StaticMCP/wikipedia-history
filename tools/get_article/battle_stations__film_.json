It was produced and distributed by Columbia Pictures. It took inspiration from the 1944 documentary film The Fighting Lady.\nPlot\nIn Act I a Catholic priest, Father Joseph McIntyre (Lund) who is serving in the US Navy is stationed on an aircraft carrier. He is shown around the ship by seasoned Chief Bosun, Buck Fitzpatrick (Bendix). The crew of the ship receives the order to sail and there is widespread dissatisfaction with the short notice given, but Fitzpatrick establishes order through his commanding presence; however, his soft side is shown when he helps one of the younger crew members to keep a small dog that he had brought onto the ship.\nAct II begins with the ship at sea and the crew is undergoing intense training at their various stations. The officers drill the crew constantly preparing them for future battles against an enemy that would often rather die than surrender. Father McIntyre establishes himself as a friendly presence among the crew and begins to gain their trust. The Captain (Boone) explains to McIntyre that the ship had previously been attacked by the Japanese and had been thought by them to be sunk and lost. The ship eventually rendezvous with a large task force assembling for battle.\nAct III finds the Task Force  under attack, first by an enemy submarine that is quickly dispatched, but then the attacks intensify. The carrier is eventually hit and damage control teams struggle throughout the night to put out raging fires. Some of the crew has become trapped below decks and only the training and familiarity with the ship prevents them from becoming lost in the smoky darkness. Morning finds the ship still burning and listing badly. The ship and crew limp back to their forward base and then they are ordered to take the ship back to the mainland for repairs but they have sustained many casualties. They return to base with an honor guard and a military band playing 'Anchors Aweigh.'\nCast\n* John Lund as Father Joseph McIntyre\n* William Bendix as Buck Fitzpatrick\n* Keefe Brasselle as Chris Jordan\n* Richard Boone as The captain\n* William Leslie as Ensign Pete Kelly\n* John Craven as Cmdr.
