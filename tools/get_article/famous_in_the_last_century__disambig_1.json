According to XS All Areas - band members Francis Rossi and Rick Parfitt's duel 2004 autobiography - the idea to record a second covers album (following 1996's ''Don't Stop'') came from the band's then-manager David Walker, who said they should celebrate the millennium with an album containing twenty of their favourite hits from the past century. \"Another bloody covers album!\" grumbled Rossi. \"We went along with it, as usual, but inside I felt like a fraud... for me it was the worst Quo album there had ever been - or ever will be!\"\n\"We didn't wanna do it,\" Rossi told Classic Rock magazine in 2002, \"but it sold. I don't think we'll do another one.\" However, the band issued another covers album, Riffs, in 2003.\nFamous in the Last Century reached No. 19 on the UK Albums Chart, a better position than the previous Quo album of mainly original material, Under the Influence. Two singles from it – \"Mony Mony\" and \"Old Time Rock and Roll\" – were minor hits.\nJeff Rich left the band after recording this album and was replaced by Matt Letley.\nA DVD & VHS of the same name was filmed at the Shepherd's Bush Empire on 27 March 2000. It is a mimed performance of the album. The group did a live gig after the filming of the video, and a few tracks from it were released as B-sides.\nTrack listing\n# \"Famous in the Last Century\" (Bown) 1:04\n# \"Old Time Rock and Roll\" (George Jackson, Thomas E.
