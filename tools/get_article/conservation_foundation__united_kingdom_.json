Bellamy served as the president of the foundation. As of 2022, the foundation's chair is Dorothy Harris and David Shreeve is its executive director.\nHistory\nThe charity was founded in 1982, establishing the Ford Conservation Awards in the same year. The Ford Conservation Awards later extended beyond the UK, throughout Europe, and ended after 18 years.\nThe Ford Conservation Awards recognised the work of a diverse array of recipients, including leaders of local environmental efforts and local historians. In 1987, local historian Daphne Munday received the award for her book A Parish Patchwork which documented the history of Sandford, Newbuildings, and other local settlements in Mid Devon.\nThe 1999 Ford Conservation Awards were presented at London Zoo by Prince Philip.\nIn 2023, David Shreeve was awarded an MBE by King Charles III in the King's Birthday Honours, in recognition of his \"service to the environment\" through the foundation.\nStructure\nThe charity is governed by a board of directors and supported by a council. Based in the Royal Geographical Society in Kensington, London, the activities of the organisation primarily cover the UK, but past projects have covered countries around the world and on every continent.\nActivities\nThe foundation runs a number of projects to engage the public in environmental issues. Most are aimed at communities around the UK, whilst others target specific regions of the UK or operate internationally.\nIn 2000, the foundation worked with the Church of England to plant yew trees as part of the millennium yew project. Around 8,000 yews were planted in around 7,000 Church of England parishes.\nIn 2013, the foundation's Tool Shed project coordinated with female prisoners at HMP Edinburgh to repair and refurbish donated hand tools, which were then offered to schools and communities for free as part of a giveaway labelled the Great Garden Tool Giveaway.\nIn 2015, it launched a campaign to preserve and protect Britain's yew trees with the Bishop of Salisbury. The campaign, We Love Yew, aimed to educate people about the yew tree's history in Britain, and offered yew saplings to schools and communities.\nFunding\nThe charity is supported through government funding, charitable trusts and foundations, individuals, and business sponsorship through corporate social responsibility projects. It is not a membership organisation.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
