After his playing career, he became a radio and television football commentator.\nFootball career\nHe debuted for the Kangaroos in 1994 after being recruited from Port Melbourne Football Club at the age of 22. He went on to play 241 games and kicked 145 goals, winning premierships in 1996 and 1999.\nHe represented Victoria in State of Origin on more than one occasion, including in 1998. He is notable for holding a VFL/AFL record by playing in preliminary finals for seven consecutive years (along with teammates John Blakey, Wayne Carey, Mick Martyn, Corey McKernan & Craig Sholl) from his debut year in 1994 to 2000.\nHe was twice an AFL All-Australian and retired at the end of the 2004 season. He then joined the Richmond Football Club as an assistant coach in 2005.\nPost-playing career\nHe is currently a baller and commentator for Fox Footy and SEN 1116. King was awarded the Most Outstanding Television Special Comments award at the 2012 AFL Media Awards.\nHe also is a panellist on the Fox Footy show First Crack.\nLegal issues\nOn 19 February 2015, Australian media reported that King was being investigated by police about successful bets he made predicting the winner of the 2014 AFL Rising Star award.\nOn 14 January 2019, King was fined for fleeing the scene of a car crash and drink driving in Melbourne in October 2018.\nKing was driving his grey Nissan X-Trail at 12.10am on 3 October when he crashed into a stationary taxi at Southbank. Police later arrested King nearby at Crown Casino, after which he blew a blood alcohol reading of 0.10—twice the legal limit—fined $1200, had his licence suspended for 10 months, and had an interlock device fitted to his car.\nStatistics\n:\n|-\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1994\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n| 34 || 19 || 4 || 11 || 154 || 66 || 220 || 21 || 21 || 0.2 || 0.6 || 8.1 || 3.5 || 11.6 || 1.1 || 1.1\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1995\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n| 34 || 22 || 8 || 5 || 228 || 90 || 318 || 42 || 21 || 0.4 || 0.2 || 10.4 || 4.1 || 14.5 || 1.9 || 1.0\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n| bgcolor=F0E68C | 1996# ||\n| 34 || 25 || 5 || 2 || 280 || 115 || 395 || 79 || 31 || 0.2 || 0.1 || 11.2 || 4.6 || 15.8 || 3.2 || 1.2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1997\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n| 34 || 23 || 8 || 5 || 348 || 73 || 421 || 67 || 23 || 0.3 || 0.2 || 15.1 || 3.2 || 18.3 || 2.9 || 1.0\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1998\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n| 34 || 22 || 10 || 12 || 322 || 86 || 408 || 54 || 28 || 0.5 || 0.5 || 14.6 || 3.9 || 18.5 || 2.5 || 1.3\n|-\n| bgcolor=F0E68C | 1999# ||\n| 34 || 21 || 8 || 8 || 286 || 74 || 360 || 64 || 21 || 0.4 || 0.4 || 13.6 || 3.5 || 17.1 || 3.0 || 1.0\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2000\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n| 34 || 25 || 27 || 11 || 399 || 105 || 504 || 92 || 50 || 1.1 || 0.4 || 16.0 || 4.2 || 20.2 || 3.7 || 2.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2001\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n| 34 || 19 || 19 || 11 || 291 || 99 || 390 || 64 || 28 || 1.0 || 0.6 || 15.3 || 5.2 || 20.5 || 3.4 || 1.5\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2002\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n| 34 || 22 || 22 || 23 || 308 || 87 || 395 || 70 || 34 || 1.0 || 1.0 || 14.0 || 4.0 || 18.0 || 3.2 || 1.5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2003\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n| 34 || 21 || 26 || 27 || 286 || 51 || 337 || 99 || 44 || 1.2 || 1.3 || 13.6 || 2.4 || 16.0 || 4.7 || 2.1\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2004\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n| 34 || 22 || 8 || 9 || 271 || 65 || 336 || 94 || 37 || 0.4 || 0.4 || 12.3 || 3.0 || 15.3 || 4.3 || 1.7\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n! colspan=3| Career\n! 241\n! 145\n! 124\n! 3173\n! 911\n! 4084\n! 746\n! 338\n! 0.6\n! 0.5\n! 13.2\n! 3.8\n! 16.9\n! 3.1\n! 1.4\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://australianfootball.com/players/player/david+king/13344 David King's profile] at AustralianFootball.com"
