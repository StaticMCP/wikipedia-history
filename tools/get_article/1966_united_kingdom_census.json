It was the first to ask about car ownership and method of travel to work. It trialled an alternative method of enumeration and was the first where the results were released on electronic media. It was also carried out five years earlier than normal, midway between the 1961 and 1971 censuses.\nRelease\nThe census is expected to be released to the public in 2067.\nSee also\n*Census in the United Kingdom\n*List of United Kingdom censuses\nReferences"
