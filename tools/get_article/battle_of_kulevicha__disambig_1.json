It ended with a Russian victory achieved by Commander Hans von Diebitsch (Ivan Dibich-Zabalkansky).\nBattle\nThe Russians, led by Hans Karl von Diebitsch (German-born general serving the Russian Empire), marched against the Ottomans led by Grand Vizier Reşid Mehmed Pasha (Georgian-born general enslaved as a child by the Ottomans) with the objective of relieving Silistria,  west of the village of Kulevicha.\nFirst Reşid Pasha with an Army's 40,000-strong main force inclusive of 56 guns came out of Shumla with the aim of defeating the Russian detachment sent under the Russian command's plan to lure the Ottomans out of this town, and assisting the besieged Ottoman troops with his active actions. Then Diebitsch, leaving part of his troops to continue the siege, with the main forces (about 30,000 people, 146 guns) moved against the Ottoman army and cut the way for its potential retreat, thus forcing Grand Vizier to give pitched battle.\nIn the morning of 11 June the Russian vanguard under the command of General of the Infantry Ya. O. Otroshchenko attacked his enemy and captured the heights near the village of Kulevicha, but under the onslaught of superior opponent forces was forced to abandon them, suffering losses. The Russian artillery fire and bayonet counterattacks of the Russian infantry stopped the Ottoman troops' advance. Having regrouped the forces by this evening (the Russian troops participating in the battle numbered ca. 18,000 men; how many Ottoman troops participated is not stated in the source used), supported by artillery fire, the Russian army went on the offensive and, having turned the Ottoman troops into flight, pursued them for about .\nThe Russians were victorious as the Turks got trapped in a valley suffering heavy casualties before they managed to withdraw. General Diebitsch then headed towards Adrianople.\nThe Ottoman force was tasked with various different objectives in Bulgaria, most notably the suppression of Hadjuk revolts, however several other more important duties were tasked to the Ottoman force such as relieving Silistria of constant battle and preventing further Russian advancements into Bulgaria.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*"
