It consisted of European-inspired clothing in the Empire style. It was introduced during the early stages of the Tanzimat modernization period until the end of the First World War.\nHistory\nThe Tanzimat reforms emerged from the minds of reformist sultans like Mahmud II, his son Abdulmejid I and prominent, often European-educated bureaucrats, who recognised that the old religious and military institutions no longer met the needs of the empire. Most of the symbolic changes, such as uniforms, were aimed at changing the mindset of imperial administrators. Many of the officials affiliated with the government were encouraged to wear a more western style of dress. Many of the reforms were attempts to adopt successful European practices. The reforms were heavily influenced by the Napoleonic Code and French law under the Second French Empire as a direct result of the increasing number of Ottoman students being educated in France.\nAfter the French military mission in 1796, French practices became very popular within Ottoman society. After the creation of the first cabinet, Mahmud II ordered several bureaucrats to the courts of France and other nations around the globe to observe not only clothing but also innovated institutions, which were acceptable for that era. The first new court uniforms were worn around 1839, the time of the sultan's death. His son Abdulmejid I succeeded him and French-style court uniform and dress were officially set. European-style clothing was also popular among the upper class, as redingotes, jackets, waistcoats, frock coats, ties, sharp-pointed and high-heeled shoes were not unusual during the Tanzimat modernization period.\nRepublican period\nAfter the abolition of the Ottoman monarchy, the white tie was introduced for all government officials including the president.\nGallery\nCourt uniforms 1839-1876\nFile:Turkey, 1850-96 (NYPL b14896507-435693).tiff|French-inspired court dresses (Note the white gloves, epaulettes, trousers and collars)\nFile:Turkey, 1850-96 (NYPL b14896507-435694).tiff|Another example of French-inspired court dresses, mainly based on uniforms which were being used in the Second French Empire\nFile:Mahmud II.jpg|A painting of Mahmud II appearing in European clothes along with a cloak\nFile:Abdulmejid.jpg|Sultan Abdulmejid I in clothes based on the French model\nFile:Damat Halil Rifat Paşa.JPG| Damat Gürcü Halil Rifat Pasha, statesman\nFile:Mustafa reshid pasha.jpg|Mustafa Reshid Pasha, the chief architect behind the Tanzimat reforms\nFile:Giuseppe Donizetti.jpg|Giuseppe Donizetti Pasha\nFile:Edouard Dubufe Congrès de Paris.jpg|Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha (on the far right) wearing the diplomatic uniform\nCourt uniforms 1876-1922\nFile:Ibrahim hakki2.jpg|Ibrahim Hakki Pasha\nFile:Ferid Pascha.jpg|Damat Ferid Pasha\nFile:Ahmed Cevdet Pasha.jpg|Ahmed Cevdet Pasha\nFile:Kibrisli Kamil Pasha.jpg|Kâmil Pasha\nFile:HalilRifat Pasha.jpg|Halil Rifat Pasha\nFile:Abdurrahman Nureddin Pasha.jpg|Abdurrahman Nurettin Pasha\nFile:Sadullah pasa large.jpg|Sadullah Pasha\nFile:Abdurrahman Sheref Bey.jpg|Abdurrahman Şeref Bey\nFile:Großwezir Prinz Said Halim Pascha 1915 C.
