The divisions were numbered according to the military regions. The Vichy French Military Division had a near-identical organisation as the French Infantry Divisions of 1939-1940, but with the restrictions of the Armistice of 22 June 1940 imposed them. The whole Army of Vichy France, except for the Garde, was demobilized on 27 November 1942 after Case Anton.\nOrganisation\nThe table below shows the order of battle that a Military Division aspired to. In addition, each Military Division had a , which had the purpose of countering politically subversive actions, especially those by Communists, but also those of the supporters of Charles de Gaulle.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" |Unit\n|- align=\"left\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Division headquarters\n|- align=\"left\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |3x Infantry regiments (each of an identical composition)\n(or 3x Demi-brigades of Chasseurs à Pied, each with 3 battalions)\n|- align=\"left\"\n|I battalion\n|4 mixed rifle and MG companies, collectively including:\n* 26x FM 24/29 light machine gun\n* 16x Hotchkiss Mle 1914 machine gun\n* 36x Lance Grenades de 50 mm modèle 37/VB rifle grenade\n* 3x 60mm mortars\n* 3x 81mm mortars\n|- align=\"left\"\n|II battalion\n|4 mixed rifle and MG companies (as above)\n|- valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"\n|III battalion\n|4 mixed rifle and MG companies (as above)\n|- align=\"left\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Cavalry regiment\n(either Cuirassier/Dragoon or Chasseur/Hussar)\n|- align=\"left\"\n|A single Cuirassier or Dragoon regiment\n(divided into reconnaissance groups)\n* 2 mounted squadrons\n* 3 cyclist squadrons (15x Hotchkiss MGs, 10x 81mm mortars)\n* 1 armoured car squadron (8x Panhard AMD)\n|A single Chasseurs à cheval or Hussar regiment\n* 4 mounted sabre squadrons\n* 1 heavy weapons squadron (12x Hotchkiss MGs, 4x 81mm mortars)\n|- align=\"left\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Artillery regiment\n|- align=\"left\"\n|I group\n|\n* 3  batteries\n|- align=\"left\"\n|II group\n|\n* 3 batteries\n|- align=\"left\"\n|III group\n|\n* 4 batteries\n|- align=\"left\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Engineer battalion\n|- align=\"left\"\n| colspan=\"2\" |\n* 2 companies\n* a half-company bridging train\n|- align=\"left\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Signals group, also known as a battalion\n|- align=\"left\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Transport group, also known as company\n|- align=\"left\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Guard regiment\n|}\nMoreover, there existed four cavalry regiments of the general reserve.\nEquipment\nThis Armistice banned anti-tank and gas protection equipment, while minimizing mechanization. However, the reduction of the French army meant that its remains could be entirely equipped with the newest and best equipment available, e.g. MAS-36 rifle, MAS-38 and Thompson submachine guns. The previously used VB rifle grenade was over time replaced with the Lance Grenades de 50 mm modèle 37. Artillery was only allowed to have 75mm calibre guns.\nMilitary Divisions\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Table of Military Divisions within the Vichy Army and their main component units\n|Military divisions\n|Location of divisional headquarters\n|Infantry units\n|Cavalry regiment\n|Artillery regiment\n|-\n|7th Military Division\n|Bourg-en-Bresse\n|\n*\n*\n* 4e Chasseurs à Pied Demi-brigade:\n**\n**\n**\n|5th Dragoon Regiment\n|\n|-\n|9th Military Division\n|Châteauroux\n|\n* 1st Infantry Regiment\n*\n*\n|\n|\n|-\n|12th Military Division\n|Limoges\n|\n*\n*\n* 1st Chasseurs à Pied Demi-brigade:\n**\n**\n**\n|6th Cuirassier Regiment\n|\n|-\n|13th Military Division\n|Clermont-Ferrand\n|\n*\n* 92nd Infantry Regiment\n*\n|8th Dragoon Regiment\n|\n|-\n|14th Military Division\n|Lyon\n|\n*\n*\n* 3rd Chasseurs Alpins Demi-brigade:\n**\n**\n**\n|\n|\n|-\n|15th Military Division\n|Marseille\n|\n* 43rd Alpine Infantry Regiment\n*\n*\n* 2nd Chasseurs Alpins Demi-brigade:\n**\n**\n**\n|12th Cuirassier Regiment\n|\n|-\n|16th Military Division\n|Montpellier\n|\n*\n*\n*\n|3rd Dragoon Regiment\n|\n|-\n|17th Military Division\n|Toulouse\n|\n*\n*\n* 150th Infantry Regiment\n|2nd Dragoon Regiment\n|\n|}\nReferences\nNotes\nFootnotes\nSources\n*\n*"
