The Far Eastern Council was established in London on February 9, with a corresponding staff council in Washington. However, the smaller powers continued to push for a Washington-based body.\nThe Pacific War Council was formed in Washington on April 1, 1942, with a membership consisting of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, his key advisor Harry Hopkins, and representatives from Britain, China, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, and Canada. Representatives from India and the Philippines were later added.\nAustralia and New Zealand (Prime Ministers John Curtin and Peter Fraser) wanted a council which was responsible for higher direction of the Pacific War; the London Council (Far East Council) was purely advisory and subordinate. Roosevelt wanted to retain the current arrangements for British-American collaboration, and suggested that where the interests of the three countries (Australia, the Dutch East Indies and New Zealand) were involved they could attend meetings of the Combined Chiefs of Staff in Washington (CCOS) and give their views on the spot. In return, the United States undertook the establishment of close working arrangements with the three military missions so they could give informed advice. Both Australia and New Zealand accepted under protest.\nMuch of the impetus for the council was lost during the collapse of ABDACOM, in March and April. The council never had any direct operational control and any decisions it made were referred to the US-British Combined Chiefs of Staff, which was also in Washington. Although there were relatively few US forces in the Pacific in mid-1942, the sheer volume of matériel and forces controlled by the United States government soon gave it effective control of strategy in the Pacific War.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110319223150/http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/timeline/factfiles/nonflash/a1141958.shtml \"Fact File : Formation of the Pacific War Council\"], BBC: WW2 People's War\n*[http://docs.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box5/folo59.html Pacific War Council Documents at the Franklin D.
