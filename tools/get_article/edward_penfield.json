His work has been included in almost every major book on American Illustration or the history of the poster.  He is also a major figure in the evolution of graphic design.\nYouth and training\nHe was born June 2, 1866, in Brooklyn, New York, to Ellen Lock Moore and Josiah B. Penfield. He first studied at New York's Art Students League. He worked under George de Forest Brush, who was known for his romantic scenes of American Indian life. He first worked for ''Harper's Weekly and later became art director.  He developed his own unique style of simplified figures with bold outlines in settings free of extraneous detail. He believed, \"A design that needs study is not a poster, no matter how well executed.\" He wrote and published a book titled Holland Sketches'', which was published by Scribner's in 1907.\nPenfield lived in New Rochelle, New York, a popular art colony among actors, writers and artists of the period. The community was most well known for its unprecedented number of prominent American illustrators. He was one of the founding members of the New Rochelle Art Association which was organized in 1912.\nPoster designs\nHis posters were bold and stood out from a distance with great clarity.  As artists like Alphonse Mucha, Théophile Steinlen and Toulouse-Lautrec popularized the poster in Europe, Penfield accomplished the same feat in the United States. For his posters, Penfield utilized simple shapes and a limited palette of colors that lent themselves to the primitive methods of reproduction of the era.\nGallery\nFile:Edward Penfield, Harper's June, 1896.jpg|Harper's Magazine, June 1896\nFile:Three Gringos by Richard Harding Davis 1896.jpg|Book cover: Three Gringos by Richard Harding Davis, 1896\nFile:Bookplate of Edward Penfield.jpg|Exlibris\nFile:Edward Penfield- Harper's Magazine May 1897.jpg|Harper's Magazine, May 1897\nFile:Maîtres de l'affiche V 1 - Pl 20 - Edward Penfield.jpg|Poster published in Les Maîtres de l'Affiche\nFile:Collier's automobile number, New York, January 17th, 1903 - DPLA - a74ee764c240c7993c87289cd6ce657a.jpg|Collier's automobile number, New York, January 17th, 1903; from the American Art Posters 1890-1920 collection of the Boston Public Library\nNotes\nReferences\n*Walt Reed, America's Great Illustrators, Abbeville Press, 1979, p.&nbsp;114\n*Edward Penfield, Holland Sketches, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1907\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*[http://libcdm1.uncg.edu/cdm4/results.php?CISOOP1=exact&CISORESTMP=results.php&CISOVIEWTMP=item_viewer.php&CISOMODE=grid&CISOGRID=thumbnail%2CA%2C1%3Btitle%2CA%2C1%3Bdescri%2C200%2C0%3Bdate%2CA%2C0%3Bnone%2CA%2C0%3B20%3Brelevancy%2Cnone%2Cnone%2Cnone%2Cnone&CISOBIB=title%2CA%2C1%2CN%3Bdate%2CA%2C0%2CN%3Bdescri%2C200%2C0%2CN%3Bnone%2CA%2C0%2CN%3Bnone%2CA%2C0%2CN%3B20%3Brelevancy%2Cnone%2Cnone%2Cnone%2Cnone&CISOTHUMB=20+%284x5%29%3Brelevancy%2Cnone%2Cnone%2Cnone%2Cnone&CISOTITLE=20%3Btitle%2Cnone%2Cnone%2Cnone%2Cnone&CISOHIERA=20%3Bdate%2Ctitle%2Cnone%2Cnone%2Cnone&CISOSUPPRESS=1&CISOPARM=%2Ftb1+%3Acreato%3APenfield%2C+Edward%2C+1866-1925 UNCG American Publishers' Trade Bindings: Edward Penfield]\n*\n*"
