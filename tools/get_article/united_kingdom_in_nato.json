Since at this time Great Britain needed financial assistance from the USA, a political union with this country could simplify the negotiations on which the future of the British economy depended. The Labour themselves were quite calm about the prospect of such an alliance. Starting from 1946, the government of Clement Attlee fundamentally sided with the policy of Atlantic solidarity, which makes them, together with the American administration of Truman, the initiators of the Cold War.\nGiven the United Kingdom’s significant political and military role within NATO, its contributions have often been substantial but, during the NATO's 1999 Kosovo War, the Royal Air Force deployed Tornado and Harrier aircraft in the bombing campaign over Yugoslavia.\nSince it began in 2001 British troops were part of the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan, ISAF.\nIn March 2011, the British Forces participated in NATO-led UN missions in Libya.\nUnited Kingdom's foreign relations with NATO member states\n*  Albania\n*  Belgium\n*  Bulgaria\n*  Canada\n*  Croatia\n*  Czech Republic\n*  Denmark\n*  Estonia\n*  Finland\n*  France\n*  Germany\n*  Greece\n*  Hungary\n*  Iceland\n*  Italy\n*  Latvia\n*  Lithuania\n*  Luxembourg\n*  Montenegro\n*  Netherlands\n*  North Macedonia\n*  Norway\n*  Poland\n*  Portugal\n*  Romania\n*  Slovakia\n*  Slovenia\n*  Spain\n*  Sweden\n*  Turkey\n*  United States\nSee also\n* Foreign relations of the United Kingdom\n* Foreign relations of NATO\nReferences\nuk:Відносини Велика Британія — НАТО"
