The awards are considered a significant American theater honor and are often referred to as \"the Golden Globes of Theatre.\"\nEstablished in 1955, the awards are presented annually by the Drama Desk organization, a collective of New York City-based theatre critics, journalists, editors, and publishers dedicated to celebrating excellence in the performing arts. The awards are represented by long-time Broadway press agency, Keith Sherman & Associates.\nHistory and mission\nThe Drama Desk organization was founded in 1949 by a group of theater critics and journalists aiming to spotlight significant issues in the theatrical industry and to support the development of New York theater. In 1955, the organization began presenting awards known as the Vernon Rice Awards, named after the New York Post critic who championed off-Broadway productions. The awards were renamed the Drama Desk Awards in the 1963–1964 season, and by the 1968–69 season, they expanded to include Broadway productions. In 1974, the Drama Desk was incorporated as a not-for-profit organization, and in 1975 its announcement of winners was expanded to include the nominees. Today, the awards are voted on by over 130 New York theater critics, reporters, writers, and arts editors, all of whom serve voluntarily and without vested interests in the results.\nThe Drama Desk Awards are distinctive in their comprehensive approach, evaluating productions from Broadway, off-Broadway, and off-off-Broadway on an equal footing. This inclusivity is intended to acknowledge both established and emerging talents. In 2023, the awards adopted gender-neutral performance categories. Each performance category now features twice as many nominees and two winners to recognize excellence.\nIn 2017, the Outstanding Adaptation and Outstanding Fight Choreography categories were added.\nThe Drama Desk plans to expand the awards in 2027 to honor regional theater across the United States, along with Broadway, off-Broadway, and off-off Broadway, to become the only major theatrical award to honor professional theater nationally.\nThe Drama Desk Awards have brought attention to such artists as Morgan Freeman, Patti LuPone, Bernadette Peters, James Lapine, Nathan Lane, Ellen Burstyn, Audra McDonald, and Anthony Hopkins before they entered the theatrical mainstream. Works such as Hamilton, A Chorus Line, Driving Miss Daisy, Steel Magnolias, Sunday in the Park with George, and The Boys in the Band gained early recognition at the Drama Desk Awards.\nOther notable winners of Drama Desk Awards include Elton John, Al Pacino, Julie Andrews, Helen Mirren, Dustin Hoffman, Whoopi Goldberg, Bette Midler, Ian McKellen, James Earl Jones, Kevin Spacey, Liza Minnelli, Hugh Jackman, Mel Brooks, Sarah Paulson, Tina Fey, Reba McEntire, Angela Lansbury, Jessica Lange, Lily Tomlin, Patrick Stewart, Viola Davis, Antonio Banderas, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Glenn Close, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Andrew Garfield, Neil Patrick Harris, James Corden, Anna Kendrick, Stephen Sondheim,  Billy Crystal, Bob Fosse, Mike Nichols, Christine Baranski, Jessica Chastain, Sean Hayes, Chita Rivera, Edie Falco, Laura Linney, Kristin Chenoweth, Cynthia Nixon, Allison Janney,Cynthia Erivo, Elaine Stritch, Frank Langella, Phylicia Rashad, Jessica Tandy, Stockard Channing, Billy Porter, Harvey Fierstein, Sutton Foster, Stephanie J.
