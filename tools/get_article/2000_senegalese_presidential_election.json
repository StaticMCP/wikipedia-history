Although incumbent President Abdou Diouf of the Socialist Party won the most votes in the first round, he was defeated by long-term opposition leader Abdoulaye Wade of the Senegalese Democratic Party in the second round, marking the first time that the Socialist Party and its predecessors had lost power since independence. Voter turnout was 62% in the first round and 61% in the second.\nResults\n|votes6=18604\n|cand7=Cheikh Abdoulaye Dièye|party7=Front for Socialism and Democracy/Benno Jubël|votes7=16211\n|cand8=Mademba Sock|party8=|votes8=9326\n|invalid=23400|invalid2=10474\n|electorate=2725987|electorate2=2745239\n|source=[https://africanelections.tripod.com/sn.html#2000_Presidential_Election African Elections Database], [https://conseilconstitutionnel.sn/decision-sur-les-affaires-n-4-a-11-e-2000-du-10-mars-2000-affaires-n-4-a-11-e-2000/ CC (first round)], [https://conseilconstitutionnel.sn/dec-n-13-e-2000-du-25-mars-2000-affaire-n-13-e-2000/ (second round)]\n}}\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*"
