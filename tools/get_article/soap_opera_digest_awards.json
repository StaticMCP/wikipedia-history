Unlike their successors, the Soap Opera Digest Awards, this accolade lacked a great deal of glamour.  The statue itself was a tall geometric crystal and were presented during a television show after winners were announced in the magazine.  The original award was designed by the magazine's art director Janis Rogak.\nThe magazine's editor Ruth J. Gordon, who was founding editor made the very first presentation on The Merv Griffin Show.\nThe first awards were presented during the Merv Griffin Show to Best Actor Bill Hayes and Best Actress Susan Seaforth Hayes from Days of Our Lives (which also won for 'Favorite Show'). This first award also included a special award for 'Outstanding Achievement in the World of Daytime Drama' to All My Children and One Life to Lives creator Agnes Nixon.\nThe 1978 award were presented live during America Alive! from both New York and Hollywood. The 1979 show was presented on the Thursday Dec. 27, 1979 episode of Dinah and Friends.\nIn 1980, during the height of Luke and Laura, their portrayers Anthony Geary and Genie Francis won for Best Actor and Best Actress. An award for 'Favorite Performer in a Mature Role' went to All My Childrens Ruth Warrick.\nThe 1981 show incorporated many of the categories which would become a hallmark of the Soap Opera Digest Awards, such as 'Most Exciting New Actor' (Tristan Rogers, General Hospital), 'Favorite Villain' (André Landzaat, General Hospital), and 'Favorite Villainess' (Robin Mattson, General Hospital). That year, the awards were swept by General Hospital.\nIn 1984, the awards were replaced by the Soap Opera Digest Awards.\n1984–2005\nIn 1984, the awards evolved into The Soap Opera Digest Awards, to replace the less-lavish Soapy Award. The Soap Opera Digest Awards were meant to promote excellence in the soap opera genre and were decided by the fans who read the magazine. The statue itself was made of crystal and in the shape of a heart.\nThe first Soap Opera Digest Award show aired in 1984, and was featured on national syndicated television and hosted by then husband and wife Catherine Hickland and David Hasselhoff. One of the reasons for the move up was the new-found audience of both Daytime and Prime time soap operas. That year for the first time awards were given to prime time soap operas as well as daytime soaps. This practice was phased out in the 1990s as primetime soap operas began to lose the large appeal they once had.\nFor the first two years, fans themselves voted on the nominees list as well as the winners. Ballot stuffing and a voting bloc for the 1985 awards led to the side effect where Days of Our Lives swept almost every category. The third awards were changed so that the editors of the magazine chose the nominees and each reader was allowed only one ballot to vote for their favorites. This allowed other shows such as Santa Barbara and Another World to take home trophies. A change in award season from the end of the year to the beginning meant that there was no show in 1987.\nIn 1992 the awards were broadcast live for the first time; in addition, the award statue (previously a flat crystal heart) was redesigned to be an inch taller. NBC had aired the event ever since it made its way to network television, but the show would no longer be seen on the network after the airing of the 2000 awards. The year 2001 marked the first time that there was no awards ceremony and voting was done entirely online. In 2003 the cable channel SOAPnet broadcast the awards which were hosted by Lisa Rinna and Ty Treadway.\nIn 2001, the award was featured in the episode \"The One with Joey's Award\" for the show Friends, in which Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) was nominated for a Soapy for his fictional role in Days of Our Lives but does not win. In the episode, Joey says the awards began in 1998, so it's likely not meant to be the same award, but rather a homage.\nNo awards were given out in 2002 or 2004. The 2005 awards were done entirely through the magazine. Fans could find a ballot in a November issue of Soap Opera Digest and then mail it to the editors. Only one ballot per person was counted. The awards were announced in the magazine in February 2005.\nWinners\n1977 - 1983\nBest Soap Opera\n* 1977 Days of Our Lives\n* 1978 Days of Our Lives\n* 1979 Days of Our Lives\n* 1980 General Hospital\n* 1981 General Hospital\n* 1982 General Hospital\n* 1983 General Hospital\nBest Actor\n* 1977 Bill Hayes (Days of Our Lives)\n* 1978 Jed Allan (Days of Our Lives)\n* 1979 Jed Allan (Days of Our Lives)\n* 1980 Anthony Geary (General Hospital)\n* 1981 Anthony Geary (General Hospital)\n* 1982 Anthony Geary (General Hospital)\n* 1983 Tristan Rogers (General Hospital)\nBest Actress\n* 1977 Susan Seaforth Hayes (Days of Our Lives)\n* 1978 Victoria Wyndham (Another World)\n* 1979 Judith Light (One Life to Live)\n* 1980 Judith Light (One Life to Live)\n* 1981 Genie Francis (General Hospital)\n* 1982 Deidre Hall (Days of Our Lives)\n* 1983 Deidre Hall (Days of Our Lives)\nExciting New Actor\n* 1977 John Junior (The Young and the Restless)\n* 1978 Josh Dodong (Days of Our Lives)\n* 1979 Rod Kimpang (Search for Tomorrow)\n* 1980 Peter Bergman (All My Children)\n* 1981 Tristan Rogers (General Hospital)\n* 1982 John Stamos (General Hospital)\n* 1983 Steve Bond (General Hospital)\nExciting New Actress\n* 1977 Candice Earley (All My Children)\n* 1978 Andrea Hall (Days of Our Lives)\n* 1979 Tracey E.
