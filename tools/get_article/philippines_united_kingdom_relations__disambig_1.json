Formal diplomatic relations were established between the two countries on 4 July 1946. Relations between the two countries are cordial.\nPhilippine pre-independence\nRelations between the Philippines and the United Kingdom date to Sir Francis Drake's arrival in Mindanao in 1579 after an almost three-year circumnavigational voyage aboard Golden Hind. Economic ties defined relations for the next four centuries. The Philippines became a part of the footprint of the East India Company. British companies took part in improving transportation infrastructure in the Philippines.\nBritish occupation of Manila\nThe Kingdom of Great Britain occupied the city of Manila and the nearby port of Cavite between 1762 and 1764. Strong resistance from the provisional Spanish colonial government established by members of the Royal Audience of Manila and their Filipino allies prevented British forces from taking control of territory beyond the neighbouring towns of Manila and Cavite. The occupation was ended as part of the peace settlement of the Seven Years' War.\nModern era\nOn 16 September 1953, British Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary Frank S. Gibbs called at Malacañang to President Elpidio Quirino to give the message of the newly-crowned monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, thanking the President for sending a personal representative for her coronation. Elizabeth II also gave her best wishes for the continued progress of the country.\nmeets with King Charles III at Buckingham Palace the day before the latter's coronation, 5 May 2023]]\n.]]\nFour members of the British royal family are known to have visited the Philippines.

These joint projects tackle priority development concerns such as environmental resilience, food, and energy security, and health.\nFormer British Ambassador Asif Ahmad said: \"Science and technology are key drivers to economic development. The Newton Fund will engage British and Filipino scientists as partners to increase their research and innovation capacity. The application of knowledge, tailored to the needs of the people of the Philippines, will address their current priorities and address long-term sustainable growth. The British invention of the internet transformed lives and it is not beyond reason to hope that Filipino-UK ingenuity could unlock further discovery.\"\nIn 2020, as part of the UK Government's Future Cities Program, it signed a memorandum of understanding with the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) to design the New Clark City Central Park and an affordable housing project in the new metropolis.
