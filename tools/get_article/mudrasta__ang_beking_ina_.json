The transition from Briguela to Martin was so radically different, that casting decision was comedy genius.\nAlwin Ignacio of Daily Tribune said about the film; The overall vibe was not only congenial, but communal. Familiarity did not breed contempt at that appointed time.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
