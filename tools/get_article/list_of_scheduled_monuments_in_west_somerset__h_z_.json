It merged with Taunton Deane to form Somerset West and Taunton on 1 April 2019. The council covered a largely rural area, with a population of 35,075 in an area of .\nAccording to figures released by the Office for National Statistics in 2009, the population of West Somerset had the oldest average age in the United Kingdom at 52.\nThe largest centres of population were the coastal towns of Minehead (population 10,000) and Watchet (4,400).\nA scheduled monument is a nationally important archaeological site or monument which is given legal protection by being placed on a list (or \"schedule\") by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport; English Heritage takes the leading role in identifying such sites. The legislation governing this is the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. The term \"monument\" can apply to the whole range of archaeological sites, and they are not always visible above ground. Such sites have to have been deliberately constructed by human activity. They range from prehistoric standing stones and burial sites, through Roman remains and medieval structures such as castles and monasteries, to later structures such as industrial sites and buildings constructed for the World Wars or the Cold War.\nThere are 201 scheduled monuments in West Somerset. Some of the oldest, particularly on Exmoor and the Quantock Hills are Neolithic, Bronze Age or Iron Age including hillforts, cairns, bowl barrows and other tumulis. More recent sites include several motte-and-bailey castles and church or village crosses which date from the Middle Ages. The geography with large numbers of streams is reflected by the number of packhorse and other bridges included in the list. The mining history of the area is also represented by several sections of the West Somerset Mineral Railway and associated ruins of mine buildings which are now scheduled. The most recent monuments are World War II pillboxes. The monuments are listed below using the titles given in the English Heritage data sheets.\nMonuments\n| show_architect = no\n| architect =\n| show_listed = no\n| date_listed =\n| grid_ref = SS 77022 38336\n| lat = 51.1311\n| lon = -3.7589\n| show_notes = yes\n| notes = Two rows of standing stones, up to  high, some of which are now recumbent.\n| uid = 1014281\n| show_img = yes\n| image =\n| upload_desc =\n| show_ref = yes\n| reference =\n| commonscat =\n| show_wikidata= no\n| wikidata =\n}}\n| show_architect = no\n| architect =\n| show_listed = no\n| date_listed = 11 August 2003\n| grid_ref = SS 98294 43686\n| lat = 51.1832\n| lon = -3.4565\n| show_notes = yes\n| notes =Grabbist hillfort is an Iron Age oval hillfort.

It has been fortified since the late Anglo-Saxon period. After the Norman conquest of England in the 11th century, William de Mohun constructed a timber castle on the site as part of the pacification of Somerset. A stone shell keep was built on the motte by the start of the 12th century, and the castle survived a siege during the early years of the Anarchy. At the end of the 14th century the de Mohuns sold the castle to the Luttrell family, who continued to occupy the property until the late 20th century. In 1976 Colonel Walter Luttrell gave Dunster Castle and most of its contents to the National Trust, which operates it as a tourist attraction.\n| uid = 1020410\n| show_img = yes\n| image = Dunster Castle.jpg\n| upload_desc = Dunster Castle and gatehouse\n| commonscat = Dunster Castle\n| show_ref = yes\n| reference =\n| show_wikidata= no\n| wikidata = Q2969173\n}}\n| show_architect = no\n| architect =\n| show_listed = no\n| date_listed = 24 October 1968\n| grid_ref = SS 88555 29561\n| lat = 51.0544\n| lon = -3.5933\n| show_notes = yes\n| notes = Earthworks of Mounsey Castle, an Iron Age irregular triangular earthwork.

The castle was a motte-and-bailey design with a 60 metre wide, two metre tall motte and two bailey enclosures, surrounded by a water-filled moat. The castle was controlled by King John of England during the First Barons' War, and was ordered to be destroyed in 1215, but survived; John's lieutenant Falkes de Breauté took control of the castle, and after his death a second order to destroy the property was given in 1228, again apparently ignored.
