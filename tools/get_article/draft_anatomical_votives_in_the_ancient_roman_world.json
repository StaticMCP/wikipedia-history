These votives are offered by a devotee to a spiritual being in return for healing, whether it be from illness, or in terms of the specific body parts, injury.\nSan Casciano de Bagni, Italy\nAt San Casciano de Bagni, Italy, an excavation brought up many anatomical votives dating from the second century B.C. and first century A.D. Those found included hands, eyes, ears, and more; offered into the pool or bath of the palace.  As archeologists continued to dig into the giant pool, it was “a place of healing, meeting of cultures and medical knowledge” (Povoledo, 2023).\nAsklepios, the Ancient Greek god, is associated with anatomical votives. A bronze right hand with an eye hole in the palm dating back to 200 A.D. which is unique due to its hole in the palm not seen much with hand votives. The eye hole in the middle is used for hanging up the votive on the walls of the sanctuary, where we tend to see most votives in sanctuaries. This hand was found at a sanctuary dedicated to the healing god, Asklepios.\nThe materials that these votives were made from varied from carved marble and ornately inscribed bronze, to kiln-baked terracotta and clay.\nReferences\nCitations\nDe Cazanove, Olivier, “Anatomical votives (and swaddled babies)” Bodies of Evidence, edited by Jane Draycott, 63-76.
