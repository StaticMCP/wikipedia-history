In 1964, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum.\nPersonal\nStewart was born in Wayne County, New York, on August 9, 1825. As a child he moved with his parents to Trumbull County, Ohio. As a young man he was a mathematics teacher in Ohio. In 1849 he began attending Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, but left in 1850 to move to the Far West to California. during the famous California Gold Rush of 1848-1852. He arrived in San Francisco, California, and soon left to begin prospect mining near Nevada City, California.\nIn 1903 he was reputed to be one of the richest men in the United States Senate (with an estimated fortune of some $25 million and ownership of several gold and silver mines in California and Nevada) and the oldest member at that time  of the upper chamber of the Congress.\nMarriages\nStewart was married to Annie Elizabeth Foote, daughter of his law partner, Henry S. Foote, on May 31, 1855.\nHis second wife was May Agnes Cone, widow of Theodore C. Cone. They were wed on October 26, 1903, in the Piedmont Hotel, Atlanta, Georgia. Judge Thomas M. Norwood, who had served with Stewart in the U.S. Senate was the best man.\nAccording to the book Reminiscences of William M. Stewart (published 1908), in May 1905 he moved with his new wife and her daughter to the Bullfrog Mining District (Nevada), of Bullfrog, Nevada where he started a law firm and law library.\nPolitical career\nCalifornia\n'' edited by George Rothwell Brown, published 1908]]\nIn 1849, Stewart ran for governor in California's first gubernatorial election, but placed 5th with 4.36% of the vote and lost to Peter Hardeman Burnett. Later, in 1851, he ran for sheriff of Nevada County, California, and the next year, in February, he was at the Whig State Convention in Sacramento, where he was named a delegate to the party's national convention.\nIn 1852, he studied law in the office of Nevada County District Attorney John R. McConnell, becoming a Democrat in the process. He was appointed to succeed McConnell as district attorney in November 1852. At that time he became a \"motivating force\" in beginning a Democratic newspaper, Young America (later called The Nevada Democrat). Stewart continued as District Attorney after an election in November 1853.\nStewart was acting Attorney General of California from June 7, 1853, until December.\nStewart later moved to San Francisco and became a law partner with Henry S. Foote, Louis Aldrick, and Benjamin Watkins Lee.\nNevada\nState\nIn 1860 Stewart moved to Virginia City, Nevada, where he participated in mining litigation and helped the development of the Comstock Lode. As Nevada was becoming a state in 1864, he helped the state develop its constitution. Stewart's role as a lawyer and politician in Nevada has always been controversial. He was the territory's leading lawyer in mining litigation, but his opponents accused him of bribing judges and juries. Stewart accused the three Nevada territorial judges of being corrupt, and he barely escaped disbarment.\nUnited States Senate\nIn 1864, Stewart was named by the Nevada State Legislature to the United States Senate as a Republican. He served in the U.S. Senate for a decade from 1865 until 1875, when he retired and moved back west to practice law again in Nevada and California. In 1873, Stewart's palatial residence, nicknamed Stewart's Castle, was built in the federal. national capital city of Washington, D.C., and became a center of the city's social scene. He was elected to the Senate again by the Nevada Legislature in 1887 and reelected by them in 1893 and subsequently once more in 1899. During the 1890s however, he left the then post-war dominant  Republican Party to join the small independent minority third party of the short-lived Silver Party (1892-1911), which was supported by many Westerners who were in favor of the Free Silver movement, a major political and economic issue in the United States during the late 19th century and generally also favored by the then minority opposition Democratic Party, led by three-time presidential candidate, William Jennings Bryan (1860-1925), of Nebraska. During this time, Senator Stewart caucused / voted  with the liberal Silver Republicans. faction of the Republican Senators rather than the opposing minority Democratic Senators (who were honestly strong in their support of \"free silver\").\nDuring his many years in the Senate, Stewart drafted or co-authored several important bills of legislation, including several mining acts and laws urging land reclamation by more irrigation. Most famously, Senator Stewart is given credit for authoring in 1868 the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution protecting voting rights regardless of race, color, or previous condition of servitude, the last of the noted three post-Civil War constitutional amendments on the issues of slavery abolition, protection of citizenship rights and allowing voting rights for black / Negro former slaves. During his time as a Senator on Capitol Hill, Stewart received 50,000 acres of land on the side for his service on the Committee on Pacific Railroads, a benefit from lobbyists and company managers / directors of several of the transcontinental railroads then being extended across the West to the Pacific Ocean coast, . In 1871, 18th President Ulysses S. Grant (1822-1885, served 1869-1877), offered Stewart a seat as an associate justice on the United States Supreme Court. Stewart however declined.  Stewart was also involved in an international scandal where he promoted the sale of a worthless worked out pit of the Emma Silver Mine at Alta, Utah for millions of pounds sterling to  unsuspecting British subjects (citizen) overseas in the United Kingdom (Great Britain / England) in Europe.\nIn 1899, Republican-affiliated journalist and diplomat William Eleroy Curtis (1850-1911), detailed Stewart's reputation amongst his colleagues, describing as follows:\n}}\nIn 1902, Senator Stewart was in The Hague of the Netherlands in Europe, in connection with the Mexican-American arbitration case, when his wife Annie, the daughter of former Confederate States Senator Henry S. Foote of Mississippi was killed in an early automobile / motor-car accident back in America on the West Coast in Alameda, California.\nPost-political career\nStewart retired from the Senate in 1905. He was a co-founder of the city of Chevy Chase, Maryland, along with Francis G. Newlands, a fellow Senator from Nevada. Stewart remained in Washington, D.C., and died there four years later. He was cremated, and his ashes were originally kept in Laurel Hill Cemetery in San Francisco before being moved to Cypress Lawn Memorial Park in Colma, California.\nIn popular culture\nThe film / television actor Howard Negley (1898–1983),  portrayed Stewart in the March 31, 1953 episode (season 1, episode 15), \"The Bandits of Panamint\", of the syndicated television anthology series, and Western program Death Valley Days, hosted then  by Stanley Andrews (the \"Old Colonel\"). In the story line, Stewart enters into an agreement to gain pardons for two bandits, played by actors Rick Vallin and Glase Lohman, who accidentally stumble upon a rich silver strike. Stewart, however gains ownership of the mine. Actresses Sheila Ryan and Gloria Winters played young women with romantic interests in the silver miners / outlaws.\nIn another episode also in 1953, of Death Valley Days, \"Whirlwind Courtship\", Michael Hathaway, who appeared only twice on television, played Stewart as a young, up and coming Nevada lawyer determined to wed Annie Foote, a real-life daughter of a former U.S. Senator representing Mississippi, and Governor of Mississippi, Henry S. Foote (1804-1880), who himself had relocated to the American western frontier, after his political career during the 1850s in the South and Washington, D.C.\nA year later, in a third episode from 1954, of the same Western anthology television series Death Valley Days, entitled \"The Light on the Mountain,\" the role of Stewart was played by actor Michael Colgan (1921–2006). In the story line, characters Stewart and \"Richard Corey\" (played by Glase Lohman) attempt to clean up the justice system in wild and wooly frontier Nevada in preparation for statehood in 1864. Actress Phyllis Coates played Stewart's now wife, \"Annie Foote Stewart\" and  famous star actress Angie Dickinson (born 1931), was cast as \"Sabina Harris\", a young woman with a romantic interest in lawyer Stewart's friend Corey.\nSee also\n*List of United States senators who switched parties\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupname?key=Stewart%2C%20William%20M.%20%28William%20Morris%29%2C%201827-1909 William M.
