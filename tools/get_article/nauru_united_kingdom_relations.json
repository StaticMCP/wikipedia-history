The Nauru Island Agreement of 1919 established the British Phosphate Commission to manage the island’s valuable phosphate resources, with the UK and Australia each receiving 42% and New Zealand 16%. After World War II, Nauru became a United Nations Trust Territory administered by Australia, with the UK as a co-trustee under the 1947 Trusteeship Agreement.\nIn the 1960s, Nauruans pressed for independence, purchasing the British Phosphate Commission’s assets in 1967. Nauru became an independent republic on 31 January 1968, with the UK supporting the transition.\nEconomic relations\nThe UK, along with Australia and New Zealand, was party to the Nauru Island Agreement (1919) and the Trusteeship Agreement (1947), which shaped the island’s administration and phosphate industry.\nTrade between the UK and Nauru is minimal. In the four quarters to the end of Q4 2024, total trade was £1 million, a decrease of 75% from the previous year. UK exports to Nauru were less than £1 million, while imports from Nauru were £1 million, primarily in services. Foreign direct investment between the two countries is negligible, with less than £500,000 in either direction as of 2023. Nauru ranks as the UK’s 222nd largest trading partner, accounting for less than 0.1% of UK trade.\nNauru has the legal right to make an accession request to join the Pacific States–United Kingdom Economic Partnership Agreement, a free trade agreement.\nDiplomatic missions\n*Nauru does not maintain an embassy in the United Kingdom.\n*The United Kingdom is not accredited to Nauru through an embassy; the UK develops relations through its high commission in Honiara, Solomon Islands.\nSee also\n* British Phosphate Commission\n* Commonwealth of Nations\n* Foreign relations of Nauru\n* Foreign relations of the United Kingdom\n* Pacific States–United Kingdom Economic Partnership Agreement\nReferences"
