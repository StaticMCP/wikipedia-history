For the first time since the 1924 elections, and the only time during the three-decade rule of Rafael Trujillo, there was still more than one presidential candidate by election day. However, incumbent president Trujillo was re-elected after receiving 93% of the vote. His Dominican Party won every seat in the Congressional elections, as it had at every election since its founding.\nThe 93% vote share was the lowest that a pro-Trujillo party or alliance would claim during Trujillo's rule. In every other election, the Dominican Party or its predecessor (the Confederation of Parties) claimed to have received 99 percent or more of the vote.\nResults\nReferences"
