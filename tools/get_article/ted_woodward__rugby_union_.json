He played his rugby with Wasps and as a teenager scored a hat-trick of tries to hand them victory in the 1948 Middlesex Sevens final against Harlequins. From 1952 to 1956, Woodward gained 15 England caps, debuting as a 20-year-old. He scored six tries for England, including two in their unbeaten 1953 Five Nations-winning campaign.\nPersonal life\nWoodward was the brother-in-law of England flanker Ron Syrett, through his sister Jean.\nSee also\n*List of England national rugby union players\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://www.englandrugby.com/england/player-archive/player-info?gender=male&id=EWO14 Ted Woodward] at England Rugby"
