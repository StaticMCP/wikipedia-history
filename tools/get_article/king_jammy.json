He began his musical career as a dub master at King Tubby's recording studio. His dubs are known for their clear sound and use of effects.\nBiography\nAfter earning money from building amplifiers and repairing electrical equipment from his mother's house in Waterhouse in the late 1960s, he started his own sound system.  He also built equipment for other local systems.  After leaving Jamaica to work in Canada for a few years in the early 1970s, he returned to Kingston in 1976 and set up his own studio at his in-laws' home in Waterhouse, and released a couple of Yabby You productions. When Philip Smart left King Tubby's team to work in New York City, Jammy replaced him, getting to work with Bunny Lee and Yabby You.\nIn the late 1970s, he began to release his own productions, including the debut album from Black Uhuru in 1977. In the 1980s, he became one of the most influential producers of dancehall music. His biggest hit was 1985's \"Under Me Sleng Teng\" by Wayne Smith, with an entirely digital rhythm hook. Many credit this song as being the first \"digital riddim\" in reggae, leading to the modern dancehall era. Later into 1980s, Jammy improvised reggae and dancehall: he digitalized old riddims, like Real Rock, and Far East. King Jammy then began working with top artists in Jamaica throughout the 1980s and 1990s such as Admiral Bailey, Admiral Tibet, Chaka Demus, Frankie Paul, Lieutenant Stitchie, Pinchers, and Dennis Brown. Jammy's productions and sound system dominated reggae music for the remainder of the 1980s and into the 1990s. He continues to work as a producer, working with some of today's top Jamaican artists, including Sizzla.\nPartial discography\nSolo records or records with co-billing\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 70%; height: 10em;\"\n|-\n!
