The Sublime Porte first officially recognized the state as autonomous in January 1807, however, the Serbian revolutionaries rejected the treaty and continued fighting the Ottomans until 1813. Although the first uprising was crushed, it was followed by the Second Serbian Uprising in 1815, which resulted in the creation of the Principality of Serbia, as it gained semi-independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1817.\nBackground\nThe Ottoman Empire saw growing political and economical crisis in the mid-18th century which led to feudal anarchy at the beginning of the 19th century. The European-Ottoman wars and new economic relations broke the Ottoman feudal system and effected the emancipation of Christians in the empire, especially in the Balkans. The rayah'' (subordinated Christians) were subject to forced labour (known as chiflik), terror from authorities, forced migration, epidemics and starvation. Serbs had joined the Austrian wars against the Ottomans and suffered consequences due to their failure. Out of all Serb-inhabited areas in the Rumelia Eyalet, the most homogenous was the Pashalik of Belgrade.\nThe territory of modern Serbia was outside Austrian focus after the Austro-Turkish War (1737–39) and peace signed in 1747. Russian victories (1768–74) and intention to liberate the Balkans prompted Austria to ally in 1782, also dividing spheres of influence, with Russia claiming Wallachia and eastwards and Austria west of that down to the Adriatic Sea, with a Serbian state not included in any plan. Austria did not join Russia when it occupied Crimea but instead initiated contact with the agitated Serbs of the Belgrade Pashalik. The Serbs were oppressed by the Ottoman authorities and Janissaries and were eager to form alliances with Christian states in order to liberate themselves. The Ottomans declared war on Russia in 1787 and Austria joined in February 1788. In 1787 the Serbs were violently disarmed by the Ottoman authorities during the Austrian war preparations, with terror carried out by military and bashi-bazouk irregular units leading to people fleeing across the Sava and Danube to Austrian territory and forming the Serbian Free Corps.\nSerb volunteers actively engaged Ottoman troops and raided ships on the Danube, and liberated many towns in central Serbia, however, much needed aid and equipment was denied. Successful Ottoman counter-operations and terror led to further flight to Austria, numbering 50,000 by late June 1788. South Banat was occupied by the Ottomans and a truce was signed, lasting to the summer of 1789. The threat of a Prussian-Ottoman alliance prompted the Austrians to launch a campaign in August 1789 leading to the conquest of Belgrade and advance in the interior. The Austrian court increasingly sought to end the conflict and peace was signed in August 1791.\nThe Porte gave amnesty to participants on the Austrian side and banned the Janissaries from the Pashalik. The Janissaries had earlier been part of the backbone of Ottoman military power but had lost their importance in the 18th century, becoming a source of disorder, due to lack of discipline and bad morals. In 1793, the Janissary Pashas revolted, raiding the lands and threatening the Sultan's rule, with Pazvantoğlu taking over the Sanjak of Vidin and the Janissaries briefly occupying Belgrade. After expelling the Janissaries, the Porte appointed Hadji Mustafa Pasha as Vizier of Belgrade in July 1793, and he was remembered positively among the Serbs for the improved situation in the Pashalik through reforms. In order to rid the threat of the Janissaries, a Serb militia in Ottoman service was established, numbering some 15,000, many of whom had gained military training and experience in the last war. The Janissaries were decisively defeated by the militia in another attempt to occupy the Pashalik, which showed that militia was well-organized, disciplined and trained. As a reward, the Porte issued firmans (decrees) which acknowledged Serb self-governing privileges, better socio-economic status, the right to renew and build churches, and to lead security detachments for maintaining road safety and apprehending robbers. Muslim retaliation and entry to Serb villages was forbidden, as to not make way for conflict. This significant improvement did not last long, as new conflicts with Janissaries arose and the threat of the French in Egypt made the Porte allow for the return of Janissaries in early 1799. The Janissaries renewed terror against the Serbs, captured Belgrade and Mustafa Pasha in July 1801, murdered him in December, then ruled the Pashalik with a Vizier as their puppet. The leading Janissaries, called the Dahije, abolished the Serbs' firmans, banished unsupportive sipahi and invited Muslims from neighbouring sanjaks which they used to control the Serbs. The banished sipahi and loyal Muslims organized a rebellion against the Janissaries with Serb support in mid-1802, but it failed, resulting in further oppression. The \"Slaughter of the Knezes\" led to the uprising against the Dahije in 1804 and the start of the Serbian Revolution.\nHistory\nThe peasant rebellion against the Dahije expanded into a national uprising in 1805. The rebel army had defeated the Sultan's army at Ivankovac and proclaimed Smederevo the capital in November 1805. Laws passed by the Governing Council and People's Assembly in October-November 1805 represented the first constitutional acts establishing the Council as the executive institution. The revolutionary government was responsible for organizing and supervising various aspects of government, including administration, economy, army supply, law and order, justice, and foreign policy. There were important victories at Mišar, against Pazvantoğlu, at Deligrad and the capture of Belgrade meant the control of the entire Pashalik by December 1806. The rebellion stirred up parts of Bosnia, northern Macedonia, the Vidin-Belogradchik area and encouraged the armatoloi of Greece. At the same time, the Ottomans declared war on Russia. The victory at Mišar, in which 12,000 rebels defeated 20,000 troops of Bosnian beys resonated among Bosnia's Christians who due to it took up a defensive stance against Muslim violence.\nA treaty which granted Serbia autonomy was agreed in January 1807 but was subsequently rejected by the rebels who sought Russian aid to independence, and signed an alliance with the Russian Empire on 10 July 1807. The combined Serbian-Russian forces defeated an Ottoman army at Malajnica and there was a political crisis at the Porte which led to the execution of Sultan Selim by Mustafa IV, who was subsequently deposed by Mahmud II. Another treaty would have given Serbia significant autonomy but disagreements regarding the borders led to failure. The Serbian-Russian cooperation proved ineffective however, and the rebels had a defeat at Čegar in May 1809 due to lack of coordination and the mustering of a combined stronger Ottoman force of neighbouring pashaliks.\nIn August 1809, an Ottoman army marched on Belgrade, causing a mass exodus of people across the Danube. In July 1810 Russian troops arrived in Serbia for the second time and they provided military cooperation by sending weapons, ammunition and medical supplies. Faced with the impending disaster, Karađorđe sought help from the Habsburgs and Napoleon, but to no avail. At this point, the Serbian rebels shifted to a defensive strategy, focusing on holding their territories rather than making further gains. Meanwhile, Russia, preoccupied with a French invasion, prioritized signing a final peace treaty and acted against Serbia's interests. In particular, the Serbs were not informed of the negotiations and only learned of the final terms from the Ottomans. This second Russian retreat occurred at the height of Karađorđe's power and the rise of Serbian expectations. The Treaty of Bucharest, signed in May 1812, contained Article 8, which dealt with the Serbs. According to the treaty, Serbian fortifications were to be destroyed unless they were of value to the Ottomans. Pre-1804, Ottoman installations were to be reoccupied and garrisoned by Ottoman troops. In return, the Porte promised a general amnesty and certain autonomous rights. The Serbs were granted control over the administration of their own affairs and the collection and payment of a fixed tribute. The reaction in Serbia was strong, with particular concern over the reoccupation of fortresses and towns and the expectation of feared reprisals.\nThe Ottoman turned to defeat the rebels and retook Belgrade, taking advantage of the Russian retreat to reconquer Serbia and Wallachia in 1813. Most of the rebel leadership and some 100,000 Serbs crossed the Sava and Danube into the Habsburg Monarchy.\nA short-lived rebellion failed in late 1814 but the Ottoman terror pushed the Serbs to the Second Serbian Uprising.\nMilitary\n.]]\nThe Serbian rebel army was commanded by Karađorđe, the most able of the vojvoda in Šumadija, a Serbian Free Corps veteran described as physically strong, decisive, violent, heroic and fearsome.\nThe army was made up of local rebels, commoners belonging to the rayah (Ottoman tax-paying lower class), without wages but had some structure resembling a standing army. In the beginning, the rebel army was a militia with armed civilians, with the troop size depending on liberated territories. In the initial years all abled men were required to join as soldiers. Every soldier took care of his own equipment and weapons, while the government was responsible for food when he was forced to fight on another front far from home. The supply train () transferred soldiers to other fronts as the uprising required.\nThe military organization was territorial, divided into units of desetina (\"tenth\"), četa (\"company\") and bataljon (\"battalion\"), formed according to the local administrative divisions of knežina (villages under the responsibility of a knez) or nahija (a larger group of villages) which gave their names to the individual units. There were three combat arms, the infantry, cavalry and artillery.\nThe military training was conducted initially according to Austrian routines as the first instructors either came from the Military Frontier or were local veterans of the Free Corps. With the Russian-Serbian alliance and arrival of Russian troops in 1807, the training was conducted according to Russian routines. For a period following this, there were two military training divisions in Serbia, a Russian in the east and Austrian in the west, however, by the end, the Russian principle prevailed.\nSociety\nThe Serb population was patriarchal with old customary laws and lived in family cooperatives (zadruga). The zadruga and village were the backbone of social organization. The rebellion echoed throughout the Balkans and Serbs from south Hungary and the Military Frontier–peasants, army officers, priests, teachers and lawyers–massively crossed into Serbia and gave capable volunteers and diplomats, ministers and educators.\nOrthodox priests and monks were active in the planning and maintaining of rebellion, some armed themselves and became rebel leaders, consequently entering the rebel government. The clergy joined local politics, with judicial organization in autumn 1805 deciding that one priest each shall enter the village-, knežina and nahija courts. The Habsburg Serb metropolitan Stevan Stratimirović was a chief coordinator of funding and arming the troops.\nThe Belgrade Higher School (later university) was founded by the Minister of Education Dositej Obradović in 1808.\nPolitics\nThe government was made up of the Governing Council, People's Assembly and Karađorđe.  The Council had to organize and supervise the administration, economy, army supply, order and peace, judiciary, and foreign policy. The intellectual leadership included Orthodox archpriest Matija Nenadović and political support from educated Habsburg Serbs such as Dositej Obradović and Sava Tekelija.\nThe term \"Serbian nation\" was used in diplomatic correspondence and the coat of arms of the medieval Nemanjić dynasty was adopted. The rebels aimed to restore the medieval Serbian state and include the neighbouring regions, with attacks being coordinated with the Prince-Bishop of Montenegro Petar I and the tribes of Montenegro and Herzegovina. An Ottoman official imprisoned in Serbia in 1806 reported that the Serbs \"as King Lazar once went to Kosovo so they will all come to Kosovo again\". There were various plans of restoring a Serbian state in the 18th century, with either Habsburg or Russian support. While having modest political demands in the initial phase, seeking limited autonomy and protection of Austria and Russia, they demanded and claimed independence by late 1806. Karađorđe invited all the Christians of Albania, Rumelia and Bulgaria to join the Serbs in arms in 1807, seeking wider Balkan support.\nThe rebels opted for Russian alliance in 1807.  By 1809, Karađorđe turned to France after heavy losses and being disappointed in Austria and Russia, and offered the French the strategic town of Šabac and to negotiate a new status for Serbia. The French viewed the Serbs as a Russian instrument. In 1810 Karađorđe proposed a South Slavic protectorate under Napoleon who declined, as the French-Ottoman alliance was in effect. The rebels once again turned to Russia, as Habsburg alliance was impractical owing to Serbian attachment to the Russian campaign. Russia abandoned Serbia after the Treaty of Bucharest (1812), in which the Serbs had demanded independence. The Ottoman army crushed the rebellion in autumn 1813 as Serbia lacked any external support.\nGovernment\nThe Orašac Assembly in February 1804 saw the election of Karađorđe to lead the uprising against \"Turkish\" rule.  Military success led to formation of an own government in place of the Ottoman system in liberated territory and cities, both military and civil authority. Courts (called magistrates) and judges were appointed at the first national assembly held in Ostružnica in April 1804, after Karađorđe asked of the nahija chiefs (starešina) to bring two or three \"main men\" for the election of judges. The initial phase of the uprising saw a rise in crime with some rebels engaging in deviant behaviour to enrichen themselves. It was decided that the army in liberated territory commence towards Belgrade upon the assembly, so the judicial system needed to be put in place hastily to care for law and order in the absence of the army and chiefs. Orthodox archpriest Matija Nenadović worked on the regulations, using also some paragraphs from the medieval legal code Zakonopravilo, with other points being contemporary reflections on rebel opportunities, commoner perceptions or showing Austrian influence. Lesser wrongdoings would be judged according to the trusted judge's \"clear conscience\" and traditional practices. The first court was established in the Valjevo nahija by Nenadović and had a judicial, administrative and police function, also standing for the organization of ordinary life outside the rebellion and the mobilization of troops and necessities. At the same time, church courts were responsible for religious matters and education and included laymen. A problem laid in the chiefs' view that they were independent and untouchable in their nahija, which urged for strengthening civil government and excluding them from judicial work. The chiefs had taken upon themselves to act as the law in a despotic way (as Karađorđe did). They based their rule on their power, military prowess and wealth, often being former knezes (village holders), kmets (serfs) or belonging to knez families from the time of Hadji Mustafa Pasha (1793–1801). Karađorđe is known to have often had the last word and being strict in sentencing, while corruption is evident in him acting as the supreme judge ordering changes to sentences and punishment, such as freeing, giving amnesty to individuals or handing death sentences (and executing them).\nThe first year saw supreme military control of territory in the hands of Karađorđe, which led to other military leaders wanting to limit his power. In response, the Governing Council (Praviteljstvujušči Sovjet) was established in 1805, upon recommendation of Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Czartoryski and the proposal of some leaders (such as Matija and Jakov Nenadović, Milan Obrenović, Sima Marković). Laws passed by the Governing Council and People's Assembly (Narodna Skupština) in October-November 1805 represented the first constitutional acts establishing the Council as the executive institution. The People's Assembly, made up of community leaders (owing to their reputation and position), and not electees, gathered to decide on important matters such as political and military issues. Karađorđe became Assembly chairman (), being the commanding general with certain diplomatic, administrative and judicial functions.\nThe idea of Austrian lawyer Boža Grujović, the first secretary, and archpriest Matija Nenadović, the first president, was that the Council would become the government of the new Serbian state. Grujović was instrumental in its establishment and he drew inspiration from the French Revolution, with Nenadović having the most important role in establishing the Council and it being the most active during his presidency. Courts were established in all nahija. The courts and Council only managed to somewhat reduce the voivode involvement in judicial matters (and extrajudicial abuse) and were unable to adjudicate them due to their power and the fact that they influenced the election of judges and council members. Following the Russian alliance of 1807, diplomat Konstantin Rodofinikin drafted a plan to establish a Serbian \"senate\" () which would hold power with Karađorđe acting as non-hereditary Prince (књаз/knjaz), aimed to limit his powers, but the Russian emperor never approved it.  Despite initial military successes, the rebel leaders were seldom on good terms, and constant infighting plagued their camp. In the western part of the country, Jakov Nenadović was the principal figure, while in the east, Milenko Stojković and Petar Dobrnjac. The latter two opposed Karađorđe's attempts to create a centralized state, fearing that it would diminish their own power. Matija Nenadović even came to heads with his uncle Jakov when he for a time opposed to acknowledge Karađorđe's supreme rule. In October 1807 the Council ordered for courts to be established in towns and villages, which Karađorđe and his voivodes actually worked against by putting pressure on judges, preventing people from talking to the court and scrapping sentences protecting their friends and family.\nThe second Constitutional Act was adopted by the Assembly at Belgrade in 1808, which recognized Karađorđe as hereditary \"leader\" (предводитељ/predvoditelj) and the Council as the judicial institution. Although the Constitution obliged cooperation between Karađorđe and the Council, some voivodes still wanted to limit his powers. The third Act came in 1811 with the intention to end the attempts of dissenting commanders, Karađorđe receiving the title of \"Vožd\" (again, hereditary) and some voivodes swearing oath first to him (as a monarch) and then the \"fatherland\", promising also to bring any rival to court. Karađorđe in turn promised to lead the people justly, stay committed to the Russian alliance, rule alongside the Council which held judicial power, and not permit the abuse of power. As the president of the Council, he could nominate ministers and other members. Karađorđe held almost unlimited power as head of state and government.\n{| align=\"center\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
