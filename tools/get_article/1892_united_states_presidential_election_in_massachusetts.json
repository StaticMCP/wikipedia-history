Voters chose 15 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nMassachusetts voted for the Republican nominee, incumbent President Benjamin Harrison, over the Democratic nominee, former President Grover Cleveland, who was running for a second, non-consecutive term. Harrison won the state by a narrow margin of 6.65%.\nWith 51.87% of the popular vote, Massachusetts would prove to be Harrison's third strongest victory in terms of percentage in the popular vote after neighboring Vermont and Maine.\nAs of 2020, this remains the last presidential election in which Massachusetts voted Republican while neighboring New York voted Democratic.\nResults\n}}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Massachusetts\nReferences"
