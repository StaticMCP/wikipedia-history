He was a Justice of the peace of Merionethshire, and the High Sheriff in 1871.\nPolitical career\nEdwards was elected MP for Windsor at a by-election in 1866—caused by Henry Hoare and Henry Labouchère being unseated when the 1865 general election was declared void on petition, due to bribery via election agents—and held the seat until 1868 when he did not seek re-election.\nIn 1879, he stood as the Liberal Party candidate in the 1879 Canterbury by-election. He lost narrowly to the Conservative candidate. After the election, it emerged that Edwards had spent about £140 () on buying votes during the campaign. Although Edwards disclaimed knowledge of this and blamed his campaign manager, he did admit that the money was spent on bribery and he had personally repaid the amount to his manager.\nIn 1880, he stood again in Canterbury in the general election, and again narrowly lost the seat.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
