It is the sequel to Vishwaroopam (2013) and features Kamal Haasan alongside Rahul Bose, Shekhar Kapur, Pooja Kumar and Andrea Jeremiah, reprising their roles. While the first film was set in the United States, Vishwaroopam II takes place in India.\nIt was simultaneously shot in Hindi and Tamil and dubbed in other languages such as Telugu and Malayalam. Produced by Kamal Haasan and V. Ravichandran in Tamil, the film was promoted by Ekta Kapoor and Shobha Kapoor in Hindi as Vishwaroop II. Initially planned as a late 2013 release, the film was stuck in development hell and was revived only in April 2017 when Haasan took over as producer himself.\nPlot\nA prequel and sequel to Vishwaroopam,\nRAW Agent Major Wisam Ahmad Kashmiri is assigned the critical mission to neutralize Al-Qaeda leader Omar Qureshi and his jihadist network, who are plotting a devastating attack on New York City. Wisam, accompanied by his team—his wife Nirupama, colleague Ashmita, and Colonel Jagannathan—travels to the United Kingdom to perform the final rites for their fallen comrade, Dawkins. During the journey, Nirupama grows suspicious of Ashmita's closeness to Wisam, prompting her to question their relationship. This leads to a flashback where Wisam recalls meeting Ashmita, a spirited and brave young officer, during an Indian Army parade and award ceremony. Recognizing her potential, Wisam and Jagannathan recruit her for their covert operation. To infiltrate Omar’s group, Wisam and Ashmita stage an affair, leading to Wisam’s court-martial and a 10-year sentence for dereliction of duty. With Jagannathan’s help, Wisam escapes prison, is branded a militant, and, alongside Lieutenant Roy (Imtiaz), joins Omar’s terrorist network undercover.\nIn the present, the team is met by Goswami, an army officer acting under orders from Eshwar Iyer. While transporting Dawkins’ remains, their car is ambushed by militants, resulting in a deadly crash. Nirupama, Ashmita, and Jagannathan are trapped inside, while Wisam is thrown out. He engages and kills a pursuing militant. Goswami, fatally injured, dies content after seeing his enemy’s face, fulfilling his lifelong wish as an officer. Wisam, wounded, slips into a flashback of his earlier mission with Omar. Working with Imtiaz, Wisam attempts to plant a locator to track Osama bin Laden, Al-Qaeda’s leader, for NATO forces. Omar catches Wisam, shoots at him, but Imtiaz takes the bullet and dies. Wisam, gravely injured, signals NATO helicopters with flares and is rushed to a hospital, where he survives.\nBack in the present, the team reaches their hotel, where Eshwar confronts Wisam for killing the militant instead of capturing him. Eshwar mocks Wisam’s Muslim identity, but Wisam staunchly defends his loyalty to India. Detecting surveillance devices in their room, Wisam and Ashmita destroy them, warning Eshwar against further interference. Later, Wisam, Nirupama, Ashmita, and an ISI agent, Munnavar, investigate a building for explosives. During a phone call, Eshwar urges Wisam to evacuate, but Wisam, suspecting treachery, pretends to be trapped inside. Eshwar triggers a bomb, believing Wisam is dead, but Munnavar reveals Wisam’s survival. Wisam confronts Eshwar, who commits suicide to avoid capture.\nThe team discovers a book detailing tide schedules, uncovering a plot tied to the SS Richard Montgomery, a World War II shipwreck off the coast of Sheerness, UK, carrying 1500 tons of unexploded ordnance. The militants plan to detonate cesium-based weapons underwater during high tide, potentially triggering a massive explosion and a tsunami that could submerge London 10 to 16 meters underwater. Nirupama, a certified deep-sea diver, dives to inspect and disable the cesium devices. Meanwhile, Wisam’s ally, Jim, is killed by a militant attempting to remotely detonate the bombs. Wisam tracks and eliminates the militant, preventing the catastrophe.\nReturning to Delhi, Jagannathan is summoned for a debriefing by his superior, Seshadri, who questions Nirupama’s role in the mission and orders her removal. Jagannathan refuses, citing Wisam’s deep love for her. Overhearing this, Nirupama is touched and reconciles with Wisam, leading to an intimate moment. The couple visits Wisam’s mother, an Alzheimer’s patient in a care home, who fails to recognize him but clings to memories of his childhood through old photos, leaving Wisam emotional.\nThe mission takes a dark turn when Salim, a militant, kidnaps Ashmita and Nirupama. Salim brutally kills Ashmita, sending her dismembered body to Wisam. Nirupama is held hostage by Omar, who blames Wisam for his family’s death during the NATO strike. Wisam reveals that Omar’s wife, son, and nephew are alive and safe, handed over to NATO for protection. Omar, unmoved, attaches a bomb to Wisam’s neck with a 40-second timer and holds Nirupama and Wisam’s mother hostage in Daryaganj. Salim reveals a plan to detonate 64 bombs across India to mark 64 years of Indian Independence. Wisam escapes the bomb, neutralizes it in a water tank, and kills Salim. In a final confrontation, Omar attacks Wisam but dies after falling into a burning stove. Wisam’s team prevents the mass bombings.\nAt the hospital, Wisam shows Omar’s sons, Jalal and Nasser, to the dying Omar. Jalal is pursuing an MTech in London, and Nasser is in medical school. Realizing his errors, Omar passes away. Wisam and Nirupama leave the hospital together, their bond strengthened by the ordeal.\nCast\n* Kamal Haasan as Vishwanathan / R&AW Agent Major Wisam Ahmad Kashmiri, a former soldier of the Indian army and agent of R&AW who has infiltrated the Al Qaeda during America's War on Terror; his past comes back to haunt his present\n* Rahul Bose as Omar Qureshi, the main antagonist and Wisam's former friend whom he sees as a traitor and villain for the supposed death of his family\n* Pooja Kumar as Dr. Nirupama Vishwanathan / Nirupama Kashmiri, Wisam's wife with knowledge of scuba diving and a doctorate in nuclear oncology (Voice dubbed by Abhirami)\n* Andrea Jeremiah as Ashmita Subramaniam, Wisam's friend and member of the army whom Nirupama gets jealous of because of her and Wisam's history.\n* Shekhar Kapur as Colonel Jagannathan (Jaganath in Hindi), one of Wisam's mentors and higher orders during his infiltration and best friend of deceased John Dawkins and Gowswami\n* Jaideep Ahlawat as Salim, secondary antagonist, and Omar's deputy\n* Russell Geoffrey Banks as Jim, Wisam's assistant with his operations\n* Waheeda Rehman as Kashmiri's mother, who's also an Alzheimer's victim\n* Anant Mahadevan as Eshwar Iyer, Jagannathan/Jaganath and Goswami's boss who is revealed to be a traitor working for Omar\n* Mir Sarwar\n* Deepak Jethi\n* Jude S.

Behindwoods given 3 stars out of 5 and said \"Vishwaroopam 2 is a fitting sequel to the masterpiece\". Baradwaj Rangan of Film Companion said \"A not-exactly-needed sequel, but a solid delivery mechanism for Kamal-isms\". Raisa Nasreen of DGZ Media summarized \"Kamal Haasan is heroic as the one man army\". Sowmya Rajendran of The News Minute said \"A predictable sequel short of fresh ideas\". Vishal Menon of The Hindu wrote \"Add that to particularly tacky production design and uninspiring visuals, you realise that it’s easy for someone to mistake the first part as the newer film. By the end of Vishwaroopam 2, we’ve seen so many bombs being planted, only for them to be defused. What’s another 100 more?\" Ashameera Aiyappan of The Indian Express gave the film 3.5 stars and wrote \"Do catch Vishwaroopam if possible before watching the second part. You won’t lose anything if you don’t, but there is a lot to gain if you do.\" Subra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the film 1.5 out of 5 stars and stated that \"That leaves Kamal Haasan, who has co-written, directed and produced the film, as the patriotic RAW agent, to do all the heavy lifting. In the first edition, the veteran star-actor led from the front: here the ‘dirty soldier turned bloody espionage agent’ is all thundery lines like ‘main mazhab nahin mulk ke liye khoon bahaata hoon’. But even he can't rise above the shockingly inept script, which he rescues only in a few places, when his trademark intelligent, wry self-awareness manages to kick in. The rest can be safely ignored.\" Janani K of India Today gave 2 out of 5 stars and wrote \"On the whole, Vishwaroopam 2 is a story that is let down by the shoddy screenplay. Even a star performer like Kamal Haasan couldn't save the audience from this mess.\" Karishma Shetty of Pinkvilla wrote \"Is Vishwaroopam 2 worth a watch? I would recommend you to see Mission Impossible - Fallout instead.  If it is of any interest, the first part of the franchise was honoured with Best Production at the National Film Awards. We rate it a 35% in the movie meter. Priyanka Sundar of Hindustan Times gave 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"That, however, is not the biggest problem of Vishwaroopam. That indubitably is Kamal directing the film as a director and not filmmaker. We can see the savvy politician Kamal is doing great onscreen. Wisam, unfortunately, is lost in the back ground.\" Shreedhar Pillai of Firstpost gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and stated that \"The USP of the film is Kamal Haasan, who doesn’t look his age (63) and does action, romance and dialogue-delivery with consummate ease and style. Some of the action scenes are well choreographed. Ghibran’s music is a major plus point. But the sequel is nowhere near the first part and looks stretched (2 hours 21 minutes). Though part two lacks the finesse of part one, Vishwaroopam 2 is still an entertainer.\"\nSudhir Srinivasan of The New Indian Express gave the film 3.5 out of 5 and wrote \"It’s such small, effective moments that make me feel quite fondly about the Vishwaroopam films, and despondently about Tamil cinema without Kamal Haasan, the director.\" Anupama Subramanian of Deccan Chronicle gave 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"To be fair, most of these stunts and action sequences are riveting and enjoyable. Kamal is ever present with his dry wit and self-aware punch dialogues, which also brings his political aspirations to the fore. He is relentless and although he looks burnt out due to Vis’s heavy workload, his brains never tire and is always a step ahead of his numerous halfwit villains. Enjoyable in parts!\" Moviecrow gave the film's rating 3 out of 5 stating that \"An engaging sequel despite the inevitable comparison with the prequel and a few misfires. Watch it for Kamal Haasan's unsatiating desire to push the bar higher.  \" Ananda Vikatan rated the film 42 out of 100.\nVishwaroop II\nSaibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave 1.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"That pretty much sums up Vishwaroop 2. It repeatedly fires blanks - noisy but of no use. Has a movie sequel ever been so pointless?\" Bollywood Hungama gave the film's rating 1.5 out of 5 and wrote \"On the whole, Vishwaroop II is a highly avoidable flick. The film has too many tracks and the narration and execution is flawed and weak. Also at the box office, the film will have a tough time.\" Reshe Manglik of India TV gave 2 out of 5 stars and wrote \"In short, it’s only Kamal Haasan doing all the work in the film. He delivers the thundery lines like ‘Main mazhab ke liye nahi mulk ke liye khoon bahata hu’ with immense grit. However, even a spectacular actor like Haasan can't rise above the script that was clearly sinking.\" Umesh Punwani of Koimoi rated the film 1.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"All said and done, fans of Vishwaroop should forget there was a sequel planned for it. They should again watch the part 1 instead and keep its memories intact. It’s like one of those many Hollywood actioners which are all glam and no content.\" DNA India gave the film's rating 2 out of 5 and wrote \"Vishwaroop 2 boasts of some great cameos by Shekhar Kapur, Waheeda Rahman and Jaideep Ahlawat but they are so good in whatever little screen-time they have got that sometimes you feel they are wasted in the film. The spy-thriller doesn't rely much on jingoism, though, which is a relief.\"\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
