It was formed by a thrust fault, thought to have occurred due to the shrinkage of the planet's core as it cooled over time. The scarp cuts through Rameau crater. It was discovered by Mariner 10.\nThe rupes are named after , the ship used by explorer James Cook on his third voyage.\nFile:Discovery Rupes.jpg|Discovery Rupes photographed during first Mariner 10 fly-by in 1974\nFile:Discovery Rupes EN0242804716M.jpg|The scarp imaged by MESSENGER in 2012\nFile:Rupes Discovery schematic.jpg|Representation of the thrust fault at Discovery Rupes\nSee also\n*List of escarpments\nReferences\n*"
