It was named after the historic Castle ward of Northumberland. The council offices were located in Ponteland.\nIn 1974, under the reforms established by the Local Government Act 1972, most of the district was merged to form part of Castle Morpeth, while the southernmost part joined the metropolitan borough of Newcastle in the new metropolitan county of Tyne & Wear. Castle Ward, one of the modern day electoral wards of the City of Newcastle, takes its name from the district and shares some of its territory, such as in Dinnington.\nReferences"
