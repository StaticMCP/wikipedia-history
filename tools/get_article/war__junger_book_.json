Norton & Company in 2010.\nAccompanied by photojournalist Tim Hetherington, Junger spent months embedded with second platoon of Battle Company, part of the 173rd Airborne Brigade, in the Korengal Valley, a transit corridor for Taliban fighters coming into Afghanistan from Pakistan, between 2007 and 2008. Junger experienced the conditions of the infantry soldier first-hand, witnessing daily firefights and surviving an IED attack on Humvee while on patrol.\nJunger profiles multiple soldiers, including Staff Sergent Sal Giunta. His actions during the fighting in the Korengal Valley made him the first soldier to still be alive when receiving the Medal of Honor since the Vietnam War.\nFile:TimHetheringtonSebastianJungerFeb2011.jpg|right|Junger with Tim Hetherington in 2011.\nFile:Flickr - The U.S. Army - Medal of Honor, Staff Sgt.
