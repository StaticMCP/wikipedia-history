      "text": "# Seal of the president of Nigeria\n\nThe seal of the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is the official symbol of the Nigerian president. It was first used in 1979 by President Shehu Shagari in the ill-fated second republic, and jettisoned by the successive military regimes from 1983 to 1999. The presidential seal returned to usage in the wake of the fourth republic in 1999, and it has remained in use since.\nSee also\n*Coat of arms of Nigeria\n*Nigerian heraldry\n*Seal of the vice-president of Nigeria\nReferences\n* [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/ng.html National Symbols of Nigeria]\n* [http://allafrica.com/stories/200701040565.html Nigeria: President's New Helicopter May Be Rekitted]\n\n---\n\n## Seal of the president of nigeria\n\n#REDIRECT Seal of the president of Nigeria\n\n---\n\n## Seal of the President of Nigeria\n\n#REDIRECT Seal of the president of Nigeria\n}}"
