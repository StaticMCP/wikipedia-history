The larger facilities were Army Air Bases (AAB) while the Army Air Fields ( AAFld) were lesser facilities. The map below shows both types as AAB and AAF.\nMost of these air facilities were under the command of Third Air Force or the Army Air Forces Training Command (AAFTC).  In addition, the Air Technical Service Command (ATSC) ran a significant number of airfields in a support role.\nIt is still possible to find remnants of these wartime airfields. Many were converted into municipal airports, some were returned to agriculture and several were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.\nMajor airfields\nAir Technical Service Command\n* Moisant Army Airfield, Kenner\n: Sub-base of Naval Air Station New Orleans, Joint Use\n: Now: Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport\n* Harding Field, Baton Rouge\n: 49th Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron\n: Now: Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport\n* New Orleans Army Air Base, New Orleans\n: 37th Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron\n: Now: New Orleans Lakefront Airport\nThird Air Force\n* Alexandria Army Air Field, Alexandria\n: 517th Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron\n: Later: England Air Force Base (1950-1992)\n: Now: Alexandria International Airport\n* Esler Field, Pineville\n: 333d Air Base Group\n: Now: Esler Regional Airport\n* Lake Charles Army Air Field, Lake Charles\n: Gulf Coast Training Center, 1942\n: 82d Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron\n: Later: Lake Charles/Chennault Air Force Base (1950-1963)\n: Now: Chennault International Airport\n* DeRidder Army Air Base, DeRidder\n: 317th Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron\n: Now: Beauregard Regional Airport\nArmy Air Forces Training CommandAAF Southeast Training Center\n* Barksdale Field, Shreveport\n: 5th Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron\n: Flying Training, HQ AAF Training Command\n: Now:  Barksdale Air Force Base\n* Selman Field, Monroe\n: 329th Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron\n: Now: Monroe Regional Airport\nReferences\n* Maurer, Maurer (1983).
