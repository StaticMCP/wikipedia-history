The Parthians had tried but failed to take Armenia in the previous years, but a Roman counter-attack saw them lay a successful siege and capture of Ctesiphon.\nAftermath\nLike the previous invasion attempts, the Romans made no attempt at permanently occupying Ctesiphon. In the end, the Parthians managed to re-group. However, the Parthians were becoming steadily weaker, with more concessions given to the Roman Empire and the Parthian nobles and vassal kingdoms.\nReferences"
