He was a visiting researcher in Warsaw at the Institute of History, Polish Academy of Sciences, and in Pułtusk at the Pułtusk Academy of Humanities.\nHolocaust research\nIn Auschwitz, the Allies and Censorship of the Holocaust, Fleming seeks to show that the Allies knew in 1942 what was happening inside the German extermination camps. The Vrba-Wetzler report, written by two escapees from the Auschwitz concentration camp and distributed from April 1944, was not \"the watershed moment in Allied knowledge of what was happening to the Jews inside Auschwitz, as is generally believed\", writes Norman J. W. Goda in a review of Fleming's book. The Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs described the book as \"undoubtedly one of the most important in the study of the Holocaust in the last twenty years\".\nAwards\nFleming shared the Aquila Polonica Prize in 2011 and the Kulczycki Book Prize in 2015.\nSelected works\n*\n*\n*\n*\nNotes"
