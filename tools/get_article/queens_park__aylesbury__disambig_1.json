It was one of the first developments outside the historic centre of the town, lying just south of the Aylesbury branch of the Grand Union Canal.  Queens Park is mainly made up of terraced cottages with the occasional later semi-detached or detached property.  Non-residential property is limited to the Queens Park Centre, a local arts and crafts venue, and the Millwrights public house.\nBordering Queens Park to the south is the former hamlet of Walton.\nImages\nImage:Queens Park Aylesbury.JPG|The Grand Union Canal with Queens Park to the right\nImage:Queens Park Snow.JPG|Queens Park under snow"
