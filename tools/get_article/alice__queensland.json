It was served by the Alice railway station.\nThe town sits between two branches of the Alice River, the western smaller branch is nicknamed as the Dry Alice and the eastern larger branch is known as Wet Alice.\nThe town shows no evidence of having developed.\nHistory\nThe town takes its name from the Alice River, which in turn was named Sir Thomas Mitchell on 23 September 1846.\nIn April 1924 a railway accident occurred when the train crossed the railway bridge over the Dry Alice. The bridge was undergoing repairs and it collapsed, derailing the train. The train was damaged but no passengers were injured.\nReferences"
