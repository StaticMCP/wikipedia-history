Awards are given in nine categories, including romance, suspense, visionary, contemporary (stand-alone novels and series), and historical. In addition, an award is given for first novel and young adult.\nThe Christy Awards are named in honor of Catherine Marshall and her novel Christy, and are intended to nurture and encourage the writing and publishing of fiction written from a Christian worldview and showcase the breadth and depth of fiction available.\nIn 2017, the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association (ECPA), an international non-profit trade organization, assumed ownership and administration of the award. Winners are chosen by industry insiders, including reviewers, editors, bookstore owners, and book buyers.\nIn 2021, the Own Voice Award was added for Christian fiction writers of color who draw on their experience as people of color in their writing.\nAt the 2022 Christy Awards, Toni Shiloh won the Amplify Award, a new award to honor underrepresented ethnic stories, for In Search of a Prince, and Amanda Cox won Book of the Year and first place in the general fiction category for The Secret Keepers of Old Depot Grocery. Cox had previously won the 2021 Book of the Year award for her novel The Edge of Belonging. In 2022, Becky Wade was inducted into the Christy Hall of Fame for winning four or more Christy awards. In 2018, Becky Wade had won Book of the Year and first place in the contemporary romance category for her novel True to You.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.christyawards.com/ Christy Awards home]"
