      "text": "# Kingsize (The Boo Radleys album)\n\nKingsize is the sixth album by the Boo Radleys, released in 1998. The band broke up shortly after the album's release.\nThe vinyl and US CD versions of the album included the extra song \"Put Your Arms Around Me And Tell Me Everything's Going To Be OK\".\nBackground\nThe Boo Radleys released their fifth studio album ''C'mon Kids'' in 1996; guitarist Martin Carr said it was made with alienating their new fans in mind. Though the album charted highly in the UK, it fell off the chart quickly, as was the case of its singles \"C'mon Kids\", which peaked at number 18, and \"What's in the Box?\", which peaked at number 25. By the time of the album's release in the United States in March 1998, the band bad no further interest in it. Author Dave Thompson, in his book Alternative Rock (2000), described Kingsize as: \"Back to Wake Up basics, the dream comes of age. Pulling together their past explorations, then pulling out all the stops, plush production, superb arrangements, and orchestration, exquisite songwriting, mature and insightful lyrics ...\"\nRelease\nKingsize was released in the UK in late 1998, and in the US by early 1999; the band had broken up by the time of the latter in February 1999.\nReception\n| rev2      = Alternative Rock\n| rev2Score = 8/10\n| rev8      = Wall of Sound\n| rev8score = 83/100\n}}\nThompson said the Boo Radleys crafted a \"regal album and a worthy epitaph for this monumental band.\"\nThe album was not a commercial success and received mixed reviews. The album charted at number 62 in the UK albums chart; the lead single \"Free Huey\" reached only number 54. \"Kingsize\" was scheduled as a second single and was to be released before the end of 1998, promos were even pressed with b-sides, but the band's split derailed the release. A month after the album's release, sales stood at over 10,000 copies.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n*Sice - vocals\n*Rob Cieka - drums, percussion\n*Tim Brown - bass guitar, keyboards\n*Martin Carr - guitar, keyboards, vocals\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLob5uqm8TdFLowtq1BtOqRE5BPuXIQE19 Kingsize] at YouTube (streamed copy where licensed)"
