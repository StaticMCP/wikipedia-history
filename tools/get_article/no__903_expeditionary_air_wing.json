It is currently based at RAF Akrotiri within the Sovereign Base Area on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, and is tasked with conducting operations against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in Iraq and Syria.\n903 EAW was activated during 2003 in its current form as part of a modernisation directive to make the Royal Air Force more deployable on an 'expeditionary' basis.  It was previously stationed at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan, controlling RAF operations at the airbase there between Summer 2009 and November 2014.  It used to report to No. 83 Expeditionary Air Group RAF (83 EAG).\nHistory\nSecond World War\n903 Wing RAF was active from  to 31 October 1945 as a tactical wing, part of No. 224 Group RAF, Third Tactical Air Force.  It was formed at Chittagong Airfield from Royal Air Force HQ Patenga.  In December 1944, it was temporarily at Comilla with No. 67 Squadron RAF (Supermarine Spitfire);\nIn May 1945, 903 Wing provided close support to ground forces as they recaptured Rangoon before being redeployed to attack concentrations of Japanese forces remaining in Burma.  On 12 September, No. 903 Wing was stationed at Kallang, the old civil airport of Singapore City when Lord Louis Mountbatten accepted the formal surrender of all Japanese forces in south-east Asia.  It included No. 31 Squadron RAF (Douglas Dakota).  On , No 903 Wing was disbanded, becoming Station Headquarters Kallang.\nOperation Telic\n903 Wing was re-commissioned into service during 2003, and sent to Contingency Operating Base Basra as part of Operation Telic.\nThe wing stayed at Basra until May 2009.\nOperation Herrick\nDuring mid-2009, the 903 Wing was moved to Camp Bastion in Afghanistan as part of Operation Herrick, subsequently forming as an Expeditionary Air Wing (EAW).  It then consisted of:\n*Westland Sea Kings operated by 845, 846, 854 and 857 Naval Air Squadrons.\n*RAF Force Protection Wing\n*Thales Watchkeeper WK450s operated by 32nd Regiment Royal Artillery and 47th Regiment Royal Artillery.\nIt also supported the following:\n*Joint Helicopter Force (Afghanistan) that consisted of:\n**AgustaWestland Apaches operated by 3 and 4 Regiments Army Air Corps.\n**Chinooks operated by No. 1310 Flight RAF.\n**Merlin HC2s operated by 28(AC) and 78 Squadrons RAF.\n**Elements of Tactical Supply Wing.\n*Visiting Air Mobility aircraft including:\n**Airbus Voyager KC3 operated by No. 10 Squadron RAF and 101 Squadron RAF.\n**Lockhead TriStar aircraft operated by 216 Squadron RAF.\n**Boeing C-17A Globemaster IIIs operated by No. 99 Squadron RAF.\n**Hercules C-130J C4/C5 operated by 24, 30, 47 and 70 Squadrons RAF.\nCamp Bastion was transferred to the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) when the United Kingdom withdrew from Afghanistan, and 903 EAW was stood down in .\nOperation Shader\nIn , the 903 EAW reformed at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus to replace No. 140 EAW as part of Operation Shader.  It consists of:\n*Elements of the RAF Typhoon Force – 9 x Typhoon FGR4 multi-role combat aircraft (six active, three reserve)\n*Elements of the RAF Air Mobility Force:\n** Airbus A400M Atlas C1 transport aircraft (as of 2023, replacing previously operated Hercules C5 tactical transport aircraft which were withdrawn from RAF service in 2023)\n**2 x Voyager KC3 multi-role tanker transport aircraft\n*Elements of the Royal Air Force ISTAR Force\nRoyal Air Force aircraft have been using RAF Akrotiri as their home airbase whilst carrying out these operations.  In February 2019, the Tornado GR4 force (previously involving up to ten strike aircraft on rotation) returned to RAF Marham for the types' retirement from service.  The Tornado role in theatre is being undertaken by the Typhoon FGR4 detachment.  Sentry AEW1 airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft from No. 8 Squadron were previously employed on operations.  However, the aircraft was withdrawn from RAF service in 2021.  The previously employed Sentinel R1 ISTAR aircraft from No. V(AC) Squadron was similarly retired in March 2021. In October 2025, two Protector UAVs were reported deployed at RAF Akrotiri it was the first known international deployment of the type by the RAF.\nAnti-Houthi operations (2024)\nIn early 2024, in response to attacks launched against international maritime shipping by Houthi rebels in Yemen, Royal Air Force Typhoon FGR4 combat aircraft, supported by Voyager KC2/KC3 tanker aircraft, carried out strikes against Houthi forces.  Four Cyprus-based Typhoons, carrying Paveway IV laser-guided bombs, and two Voyager aircraft were employed in the strikes.\nCommanders\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!rank!!name!!from!!to!!notes, refs\n|-\n|Group Captain||Paul Burt||9/10 May 2007||Nov 2007||Op TELIC\n|-\n|Group Captain||Mike Wigston||Nov 2007||Apr 2008||\n|-\n|Group Captain||Andrew||2008||2008||\n|-\n|Wing Commander||Ian Richardson||2009||2009||\n|-\n|Wing Commander||Mark Flewin||2014||2014||\n|-\n|Group Captain||Charles Dickens||2019||2019||\n|-\n|Group Captain||Andrew Coope||Oct 2018||Mar 2019||\n|-\n|Group Captain||Jonathon Moreton||Apr 2019||Oct 2019||\n|-\n|Group Captain||Ian Townsend||Oct 2019||Feb 2020||\n|-\n|Wing Commander||Calvin Bailey||Feb 2020||Jul 2020||\n|-\n|Wing Commander||Dave Allen||Jul 2020||Jan 2021||\n|-\n|Wing Commander||Dinger Bell||Jan 2021||Jul 2021||\n|-\n|Wing Commander||Dutch Holland||Jul 2021||Jan 2022||\n|-\n|Wing Commander||Frazer||Jan 2022||Dec 2022||\n|-\n|Wing Commander||Jonathan Eastlake||Dec 2022||Apr 2023||\n|-\n|Wing Commander||Richard Fawkes||Apr 2023||present||\n|}\nSee also\n*Operation Herrick aerial order of battle\n*International Security Assistance Force (ISAF)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20170703040413/https://www.raf.mod.uk/83eag/903eaw/ 903 EAW] — official website (archived)"
