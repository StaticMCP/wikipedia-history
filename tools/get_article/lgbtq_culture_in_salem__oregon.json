In 2017, the city ranked highest among those in Oregon for having \"the most LGBTQ-friendly policies and inclusiveness\", scoring  90 out of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign's Municipal Equality Index. According to the Statesman Journal, \"Salem scored perfectly on its non-discrimination laws, law enforcement and municipal services. The city lost points for not having transgender-inclusive health benefits and city leadership's lack of pro-equality legislative and policy efforts.\"\nIn 2022, the Salem-Keizer School District established policies aimed at improving the \"safety, wellbeing, education and success\" of transgender and non-binary students\". A committee also decided not to remove the book Gender Queer: A Memoir from libraries. In 2024, the Salem Reporter said, \"In the past year, books about LGBTQ+ people and people of color were hidden on far away shelves and thrown in the trash at multiple Salem libraries.\"\nSouthside Speakeasy is a gay bar in Salem. The bar has hosted queer line dancing.\nEvents\nSalem hosts an annual Pride event Pride in the Park, which is organized by Salem Capital Pride.
