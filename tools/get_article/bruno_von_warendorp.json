In 1368 he led Lübeck's contingent in the Confederation force which marched against Waldemar IV of Denmark. He died after Lübeck's unsuccessful siege of Lindholmen, contrary to the popular belief that he died during the Siege of Helsingborg. Helsingborg's capture laid the foundations for the Peace of Stralsund the following year.\nBibliography\n*  Full text with a prosopography of the councillor-families of Alen, Darsow, Geverdes, Segeberg and Warendorf.\n* Emil Ferdinand Fehling: Lübeckische Ratslinie, Lübeck 1925, Nr. 394.\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.bernhardkeller.de/Projekte/_Die_deutsche_Hanse_/_Hanse__-_Inhalt/_Hanse__-_Handelsgebiete/_Hanse__-_Kaufleute/_hanse__-_danemark.html Other information on the war between the Hanseatic cities and Denmark]\nReferences"
