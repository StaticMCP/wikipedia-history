Amherst had to immediately send 2,000 men to Guadeloupe, which was already in British hands since the British expedition against Guadeloupe in 1759, where he would concert with the governor of the island the means of taking Dominica and Saint Lucia. Furthermore, Amherst had to despatch another 6,000 men later in the year for the capture of Martinique.\nExpedition\nIn the first days of June 1761, transports from America began to drop singly into Guadeloupe, the fleet having been dispersed by a storm.  By June 3, four ships had arrived, together with Lord Rollo, who had been appointed by Amherst to take the command.\nOn June 4, the whole of these British ships, together with one ship more from Guadeloupe itself, made sail under escort of the squadron of Sir\nJames Douglas, the admiral on the Leeward Islands station, to beat back against the trade wind to Dominica. The force consisted of:\n* a detachment from the garrison of Guadeloupe (300 men)\n* Highlanders (400 men)\n* 22nd Regiment of Foot\n* 94th Vaughan's Regiment of Foot\nThe landing consisted of Colonel Rollo, the Brigadier-General in America, in command of the troops, and Commodore Douglas, Commander-in-Chief at the Leeward Islands, in command of the four ships of the line, Montague, Sutherland, Belliqueux, his flag ship the Dublin, and two frigates.\nOn June 6 by noon, the British force had arrived before Roseau, where the inhabitants were summoned to surrender. The French replied by manning their batteries and other defences, which included four separate lines of entrenchments, ranged one above another. Rollo landed his men and entered the town. Fearing that the French might be reinforced in the night, he resolved, though it was already late, to storm the entrenchments immediately. He attacked and drove out the French in confusion with trifling loss to himself. The French commander and his second were both taken prisoners. After this engagement, resistance ceased.\nOn June 7, Dominica swore allegiance to King George III.\nAftermath\nUnlike Guadeloupe and Martinique, the 1763 Treaty of Paris did not return Dominica to France. The French captured and held Dominica island and France during the American War of Independence between 1778 and 1783, after which it was returned to British control. It remained in British hands until its independence in 1978.\nGallery\nLord Rollo Dominica 1761.jpg|Another view by Archibald Campbell\nA perspective view of Roseau in the island of Dominica in the West Indies LCCN2003677131.jpg|An alternative view of the attack underway\nView of Roseau in the Island of Dominique, with the attack made by Lord Rollo and Sir James Douglas, in 1760 (sic), 1761.jpg|This view credited to Campbell\nCitations\nReferences\n* Fortescue, J.
