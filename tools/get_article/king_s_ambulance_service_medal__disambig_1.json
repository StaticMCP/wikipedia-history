Taking on additional roles or responsibilities (in addition to their core role) that results in significant improvements for patients and/or staff;\n*V. Taking a leading role in developing IT systems to improve performance and efficiency of the Ambulance Service;\n*VI. Taking a significant and prolonged leading role in training and development to promote staff knowledge and skills;\n*VII. Success in organising ambulance services under special difficulties, for example, managing major, serious or dangerous operational incidents, which make exceptional demands on personnel;\n*VIII. Special services to Royalty or Heads of State.\nThe number of nominations in any one year is not to exceed ten, including up to 4 Medals for England, up to 2 Medals for Wales,  up to 2 Medals for Scotland, up to 1 Medal for Northern Ireland, and up to 1 Medal for the Channel Islands.\nDesign\n* The medal is silver, with the obverse having the crowned effigy of Queen Elizabeth II.\n* The medal's reverse is design emblematic of the Ambulance Service.
