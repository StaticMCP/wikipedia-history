It was opened in 2009.\nDescription\nThe Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea (Korean Provisional Government, KPG), a government-in-exile established by Koreans in China during the 1910–1945 Japanese colonial period, stayed around this area in Changsha from November 1937 to July 1938. The original building they stayed in has since disappeared. On May 7, 1938, KPG member Kim Ku and several others were shot around this area by an assassin. Kim survived, but others died.\nIn 2009, the city of Changsha opened a memorial hall for the KPG in the area. It was closed for renovations from 2017 to 2019.\nReferences\nExternal links"
