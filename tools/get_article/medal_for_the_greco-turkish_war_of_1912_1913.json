By that time, the Second Balkan War against Bulgaria had been fought, leading to the decree also specifying the establishment of a Medal for the Greco-Bulgarian War of similar appearance.\nThe medal comprised a single class, with a round bronze medal topped by a small royal crown attached to it. The obverse features a cross with the royal crown in the centre, the royal cypher of King George I of Greece () on the top arm of the cross, and the royal cypher of King Constantine I of Greece () on the lower arm of the cross. Behind the cross are two crossed swords. A circular inscription runs along the rim, spelling out  ('With God for King and Fatherland, 1912–1913), in Byzantine-style lettering. The reverse features a laurel wreath, and in the centre the names of the regions conquered by Greece during the war, also in Byzantine-style lettering: Macedonia, Epirus, and Archipelago.\nThe ribbon of the medal is 3.2 centimeters wide, blue edged with white stripes, and a thin red stripe in the middle. A version for non-military personnel, who rendered services to the Greek military, was also instituted, with blue and white reversed.\nAward terms\nThe period for which the medal was awarded was defined as 18 September 1912 – 30 April 1913. In addition, fourteen battle clasps were authorized for the medal for specific battles and operations:\n;Macedonian front\n* Elasson, for the border battles on 5–7 October 1912\n* Sarantaporon, for the namesake series of battles on 5–11 October 1912\n* Aikaterini, for the period 14–16 October 1912\n* Sorovich, for the namesake battle and related clashes on 13–24 October 1912)\n* Gianitsa, for the namesake battle and related events on 16–26 October 1912), including also operations for the occupation of Chalcidice and the Pangaion Hills\n* Ostrovon, for the namesake battle and other operations in Western Macedonia (capture of Florina, Grevena, etc.) on 15 October – 8 November 1912\n* Korytsa, for the operations in the area of Korçë on 1–6 December 1912\n; Epirus front\n* Pesta, for the border battles and early advance into Epirus, 5 October – 30 November 1912\n* Driskos, for the actions of the Metsovo Detachment in the Pindus Mountains from 5 October 1912 to 10 January 1913\n* Aetorrachi, for the actions south of Ioannina in the period 1 December 1912 – 10 January 1913\n* Ioannina, for the capture of Ioannina and all operations in Epirus under the command of then-Crown Prince Constantine, from 10 January 1913 to war's end\n; Naval operations in the Aegean\n* Elli, for naval operations in the period 5 October – 31 December 1912\n* Lemnos, for naval operations in the period from 1 January 1913 to war's end\n* Lesbos-Chios, for the capture of the islands of the eastern Aegean\nTwo additional clasps were instituted, for those wounded in action, featuring two crossed swords, and for those killed in action, featuring a Greek cross.

The bars were worn by chronological order, with the first on top.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n* }}"
