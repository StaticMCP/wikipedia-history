The first revenue flight took place in January 1995. In 1996, scheduled services began using a mixed fleet of a total of eight Cessna 400 and Piper PA-23 aircraft, after which larger Short 360 aircraft were added. Over the following years, SkyKing bought some Beechcraft 1900, which eventually became the only aircraft type in the fleet.\nIn 2008, SkyKing was acquired by rival Air Turks and Caicos. Since 22 October of that year, all SkyKing operations were merged into its new owner. Subsequently, the SkyKing brand was discontinued.\nDestinations\nAt the time of closure, SkyKing operated scheduled flights to the following destinations:\n;Dominican Republic\n*Puerto Plata - Gregorio Luperón International Airport\n*Santiago de los Caballeros - Cibao International Airport\n;Haiti\n*Cap-Haïtien - Cap-Haitien International Airport\n;Jamaica\n*Kingston - Norman Manley International Airport\n;Turks and Caicos Islands\n*Grand Turk - JAGS McCartney International Airport secondary hub\n*Providenciales - Providenciales International Airport hub\n*South Caicos - South Caicos Airport\nFleet\nIn October 2008, SkyKing operated the following aircraft, which were subsequently integrated into the Air Turks and Caicos fleet.\n*4 Beechcraft 1900\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090122055341/http://skyking.tc/ Official website (defunct)]"
