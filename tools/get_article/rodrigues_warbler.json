Their population soon got smaller. Cyclone Monique in 1968 almost wiped out the entire species. Then a cyclone in 1979 reduced the population even more. The main threats to these birds is the destruction of vegetation for fuel or grazing, rats, and cyclones (natural disasters).\nIt was considered extinct in the 1960s, but was rediscovered in the 1970s.\nIts natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry shrubland, subtropical or tropical moist shrubland, and plantations.\nIt is threatened by habitat loss.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Rodrigues Warbler\n\n#REDIRECT Rodrigues warbler\n}}"
