The shelter structures on the westbound and eastbound platforms at the highway levels (stops 3A and 4A) were demolished and replaced with bus shelters, and the northbound Transitway platform previously beneath the Queensway (stop 2A), as well as the connecting stairwells and elevators were demolished. Stop 2A has been moved 80 meters north.\nAfter the completion of Stage 2, the station is to be decommissioned and the area is to be reinstated to match its surrounding area. The existing multi use pathway from Roman Avenue will connect to the existing Pinecrest Creek Pathway by way of the current Transitway ramp to the Queensway. While the eastbound platform and its access to the lower level will be preserved for emergency access to the Queensway, the remaining station structure, stairwells, as well as existing ramps used to access the Transitway from the 417 and the Transitway itself will be demolished, making this one of the few former Transitway stations to be taken out of service, rather than converted to light rail.\nService\nThe following routes serve Queensway station as of August 24, 2025:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Services (#3015)\n!Stop\n!Routes\n|-\n|1A Transitway South|| |#}} }} }} |#}}\n|-\n|2A Transitway North|| |#}} }} }} }} }} }} }} }} }} |#}} |#}} |#}}\n|-\n|2A Off only\n|}} }} }}\n|-\n|3A Highway 417 West|| |#}}\n|-\n|4A Highway 417 East|| |#}} }} }} }} |#}} |#}} }} }} }} }} }} }} |#}} |#}} |#}}\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120319070409/http://www.octranspo1.com/images/files/station_maps/QWY.gif OC Transpo station page]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120319070415/http://www.octranspo1.com/images/files/area_maps/QWY.gif OC Transpo Area map]"
