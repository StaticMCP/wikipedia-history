In an attempt to break Pontiac's siege of Fort Detroit, about 250 British troops attempted to make a surprise attack on Pontiac's encampment.\nPontiac was ready and waiting, possibly alerted by French settlers, and defeated the British at Parent's Creek  east of the fort. However, he did not accomplish the destruction of this British force which would have greatly demoralized the British and dissuaded more British efforts to break the Indian siege of Fort Detroit. The creek, or run, was said to have run red with the blood of the 20 dead and 41 wounded British forces and was henceforth known as Bloody Run. The British forces retreated with all their wounded and all but seven of those killed. The attack's commander, Captain James Dalyell, was one of those killed. After learning of Dalyell's death, General Jeffery Amherst offered a £200 bounty to anyone who would kill Pontiac.\nThe famous frontiersman Robert Rogers was one of the British commanders in this battle.\nSee also\n* List of battles won by Indigenous peoples of the Americas\n* Council Point Park\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
