It is based in the Chinatown neighborhood of San Francisco, California.\nHistory\nThe CHSA was conceived in the fall of 1962 and incorporated on January 5, 1963, founded by Thomas W. Chinn, C.H. Kwock, Chingwah Lee, H.K. Wong, and Thomas W.S. Wu D.D.S. The five challenged the accepted history that excluded the contribution of Chinese immigrants to building California and the West Coast.\nLocation\nUntil 1966, CHSA held meetings in different peoples' homes, when the Shoong Foundation \"donated\" (rented  at a low cost) a small space in a building that the foundation owned at 17 Adler Place (Off 1140 Grant Avenue) (now Jack Kerouac Alley, San Francisco, CA 94133) to function as a museum, and a first permanent headquarters.\nIn June 1989, CHSA moved to 650 Commercial Street.\nChinatown YWCA\n\"CHSA headquarters relocated from Adler, Commercial, and Broadway.\"\nIn 1916, the first Chinatown YWCA branch was established in a former saloon at Stockton and Sacramento; the San Francisco YWCA passed a resolution in October 1929 to build a new facility on three adjacent lots bounded by Joice, Clay, and Powell. Noted architect Julia Morgan was contracted to design the now-historic building, and after consultation with Chinese-Americans, included cultural elements from Chinese arts and crafts. The building housed the Chinatown branch of the YWCA from 1932 until it was damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake; the board of the YWCA decided to sell the building to the CHSA in 1996 with the help of Supervisor Tom Hsieh and Mayor Willie Brown.\nNovember 2001 CHSA relocation\nIn November 2001 the CHSA relocated and opened the Chinese Historical Society of America Museum and Learning Center in the Chinatown YWCA building. The National Trust for Historic Preservation awarded the CHSA its National Preservation Honor Award in 2004 for its work restoring and retrofitting the 1932 building, nicknamed the \"Lantern on the Hill\". In 2005, CHSA received another award from the California Heritage Council for its restoration of the YWCA building .\nExhibitions\nThe CHSA Museum features the set of twelve Gum Shan () paintings by Jake Lee which were originally commissioned for a private dining room in Johnny Kan's eponymous restaurant, which opened in 1959. The museum also has on permanent display the large mural One Hundred Years: History of the Chinese in America by James Leong, commissioned for the Ping Yuen Housing Project in the early 1950s.\nPublications\n*CHSA Bulletin\n*Chinese America: History and Perspectives (not a peer-reviewed academic journal)\nSee also\n*Journal of Asian American Studies\n*Him Mark Lai, Chinese Historical Society of America (1963–2009)\n*Chinese American Museum\n*Chinese American Historical Museum (Santa Clara County, California)\n*Chinese Culture Center\n*Chinese Historical Society of Southern California\n*History of Chinese Americans in San Francisco\n*Museum of Chinese in America\n*Weaverville Joss House State Historic Park\n*List of YWCA buildings\n*List of works by Julia Morgan\n*List of San Francisco Designated Landmarks\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://chsa.org/exhibits/ exhibits] - Chinese Historical Society of America (Chinatown, San Francisco)\n*[https://www.chcausa.org/ Chinatown History & Culture Association] (Chinatown, San Francisco)\n*[https://chcp.org/About Chinese Historical and Cultural Project] (Santa Clara County, California)\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080616015712/http://www.chssc.org/index.shtml Chinese Historical Society of Southern California] (Chinatown, Los Angeles)"
