A datable inscription of the 14th-15th century identifies it with Dharmaraja, the \"Dharma King\", which is an epithet of Yama, the Indic god of death and ruler of the underworld.\nThe statue was called the \"Leper King\" because discolouration and moss growing on it looked similar to the symptoms of leprosy, connecting it to the Cambodian legend of Angkorian king Yasovarman I having the disease. The name Cambodians know the image as is Dharmaraja, as this is what was etched at the bottom of the original statue.\nThe U-shaped structure is thought by some to have been used as a royal cremation site.\nLegacy\nYukio Mishima's final play before his death in 1970 was .
