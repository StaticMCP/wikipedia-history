The movement was founded by Nguyễn Tiến Trung a student dissident recently arrested by the authorities in Vietnam July 7, 2009 and charged with \"plotting to overthrow the regime\".\nFounding\nThe organization was founded on May 8, 2006 by Nguyễn Tiến Trung, a Vietnamese student while studying overseas in France. The precipitant was a letter sent to the Ministry of Education seeking redress for the heavy ideological load within the Vietnamese education curriculum. Trung proposed a full reform of the system, eliminating the preeminence of Marxist-Leninist thinking.\nFor the THTNDC, the objectives set forth are:\n*Promote democratic principles in Vietnam\n*Create a forum for the coming together of youths and the exchange of ideas\n*Anticipate the participation of youths in political parties.\nOrganizational structure\nThe Assembly of Vietnamese Youth for Democracy is headed by the Representative Council as set forth in the Charter. The Representative Council designates individual members to supervise the organization's activities in specific geographical areas. Different mediums are employed for the dissemination of news and directives. Despite the state-controlled mass communication in Vietnam, THTNDC justifies its activities on the 69th Article of Constitution of Vietnam (guaranteeing freedom of expression), the 20th Article of Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the 21st and 22nd Article of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\nPolitical activism\nTHTNDC promotes the democratization of Vietnam mostly through its youths by encouraging the exchange of political ideas and participation, and the dissemination of democratic principles. The organization seeks to prepare the younger population to take part in the political spheres.\nTHTNDC also takes on social issues, advocating for anti-corruption campaigns, fighting on behalf of farmers against forced land seizures, and calling for the respect for the rule-of-law. The latter would include the creation of a civil society, judicial independence, freedom of the press.\nIn late 2006 taking advantage of the APEC summit being hosted in Hanoi, THTNDC organized a mass assembly named \"Nối Vòng Tay Lớn\" (Extend Embracing Arms) to collect signatures in a petition the APEC leaders directly. The intent was pressure the Vietnamese government in the midst of the international spotlight to respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which it had signed. The campaign also had the goal of uniting all Vietnamese, in-country and overseas, regardless of religious and political views to raise their voices in unison in the name of democracy. Nguyễn Tiến Trung himself visited US President George W. Bush, seeking his support at the Broken Spoke ranch in Texas at a fund raising event hosted by the Republican Party.\nTHTNDC also won the endorsement of the Belgian Deputy to the Council of Europe Johan Weyts, and René van der Linden, President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in support of Vietnamese democracy.\nThe organization has aligned itself with the Vietnam Democratic Party, originally created in 1944 but had ceased formal operation in 1988. It was resurrected by a high ranking party-member-turned-dissident Hoang Minh Chinh in 2006 and THTNDC joined the Democratic Party's call for a peaceful transformation of Vietnam politics.\nOther Activities\n*May 8/2006 – [https://vietyouth.vn Viet Youth] for Democracy (VYD) was founded by Nguyen Tien Trung and other Vietnamese students.\n*May 18–21/2006–2079 signatures were collected within 72 hours in an open letter in order to send it to United Nation Secretary General Mr. Kofi Annan for his journey in Vietnam, from 23 to 25 May 2006.\n*June 25/2006 – Institute National des Sciences Appliquées de Rennes: Signatures were collected from VYD members, INSA professors and many Vietnamese scholars in France.\n*July 1-September 11/2006 – France: Hand-in-Hand Marathon was initiated, connecting people worldwide to collect signatures asking the APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) leaders to support for democracy in Vietnam.

Comprehensively regarding to the weak rule of law of Vietnam communist government, the Assembly steadfastly articulated that no one should have been convicted for their crimes before the verdict became officially and called on Vietnam communist government to respect the democratic processes in the legal proceedings against all of the defendants. The members of the Assembly of Vietnamese Youth for Democracy have undoubtedly been positioning their beliefs into Nguyen Tien Trung and other under-arrested dissidents, pro-democracy activists whose detentions, caused by the unarguable peaceful activism, were resulted without charge or trial. The Assembly formally have made another call to Vietnam communist government for, basing on the ground of Vietnam constitutional respect and international conventions, an immediate and unconditional release of the under arrested dissidents and pro-democracy activists.\nSee also\n*Nguyễn Tiến Trung\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.thtndc.com/ Website chính thức của Tập hợp thanh niên dân chủ]  (Official Website) (Vietnamese)\n* [http://thanhniendanchu.wordpress.com/ Blog chính thức của Tập hợp thanh niên dân chủ] (Official Blog)\n*[https://www.bbc.com/vietnamese/forum/story/2006/09/060901_unity_youth \"Suy nghĩ sau một chuyến đi xa\"] (BBC) (new points of view after a journey) (Vietnamese)\n* [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7820500000898038413 SBTN phỏng vấn Nguyễn Tiến Trung & Hoàng Lan – Tập Hợp Thanh Niên Dân Chủ] (Nguyen Tien Trung interview)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090527234434/http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/AssemblyList/AL_MemberDetails.asp?MemberID=3539 Official site of M.
