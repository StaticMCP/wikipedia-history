It opened in 1853 and closed in 1962.\nConstruction and opening\nThe Warrington and Altrincham Junction Railway (W&AJR) built its railway line from Warrington Arpley via Latchford, Cheshire and Lymm to Skelton Junction near Altrincham during 1852–53 and passenger train services commenced on 1 November 1853. There were six intermediate stations provided along the line's length including that at Heatley, in Cheshire, which was opened on 1 November 1853. The station was located on Mill Lane in Heatley.\nNames used by the railway station\nThe station was named Heatley from its opening until 1857 when it became Heatley & Warburton which name was retained until closure.\nTrain services\nThe W&AJR changed its name to the Warrington and Stockport Railway on 4 August 1853, before the line was completed and that company was absorbed into the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) on 15 July 1867. The main LNWR train service through Dunham Massey railway station was from Liverpool Lime Street via Warrington Arpley to Broadheath, where trains joined the Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway and continued via Sale to Manchester London Road. In July 1922 the LNWR operated fifteen passenger trains in each direction on weekdays, eleven serving the full length of the line from Liverpool to Manchester and return.\nAmalgamation, nationalisation and closure\nThe LNWR was amalgamated into the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMSR) on 1 January 1923. The LMSR continued to operate the passenger train service through Dunham Massey, but by July 1946 only eight trains per day in each direction stopped at the station. The LMSR was nationalised on 1 January 1948 and operations on the line were vested in British Railways London Midland Region (LMR).\nPassenger services along the line were withdrawn and the station was closed by British Railways on 10 September 1962. Goods trains continued to use the line until 7 July 1985, when the need for extensive repairs to the Latchford Viaduct caused the line to be closed. The station building survives in use as a domestic dwelling.\nReferences\n*\n*\n*"
