For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign. Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\". Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\nAll modern acts have a short title, e.g. the Local Government Act 2003. Some earlier acts also have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n56 & 57 Vict.\nContinuing the second session of the 25th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 31 January 1893 until 5 March 1894.\nPublic general acts\n|public|71|20-02-1894|repealed=y|maintained=y|archived=n|An Act for codifying the Law relating to the Sale of Goods.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n}}\nSources\n*\n57 & 58 Vict.\nThe third session of the 25th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 12 March 1894 until 25 August 1894.\nPublic general acts\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  in so far as it relates to the Island of Jersey.}}\n|  relating to the Examination of Persons applying to be admitted Solicitors of the Supreme Court in England.}}\n-\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n-\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|  and for other purposes relating to the Commissioners of Works.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n-\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n-\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n-\n|\n|  }}\n|  with respect to Check Weighers.}}\n|\n|  }}\n|  with respect to powers of borrowing.}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n-\n| or the Imperial Shipping Act 1894|public|60|25-08-1894|maintained=y|archived=n|An Act to consolidate Enactments relating to Merchant Shipping.}}\n}}\nLocal acts\nto increase the number of Magistrates in the Royal Burgh of North Berwick.|po1=North Berwick Order 1894|Provisional Order to increase the Number of Magistrates in the Royal Burgh of North Berwick.}}\n|  relating to the Town of Belturbet.|po1=Belturbet Town Provisional Order 1894|Town of Belturbet.
