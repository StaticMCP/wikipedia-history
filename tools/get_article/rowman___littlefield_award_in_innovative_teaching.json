It has been awarded annually by the American Political Science Association and was first awarded in 1996.\nThe award is sponsored by Rowman & Littlefield Publishers.  It carries a 500 USD cash stipend and is presented at the APSA's Annual Meeting to a winner selected from political science professors nominated by members of the award committee, chaired by L. Sandy Maisel, Professor of Government and Director of the Goldfarb Center for Public Affairs and Civic Engagement at Colby College in Waterville, Maine.\nAccording to the Association, the Award recognizes developers of \"effective new approaches to teaching\" among political scientists.  Its intent is to honor a wide range of new directions, rather than one in particular.  The annual winner is chosen from among a pool of nominees whose innovations had moved political science pedagogy forward.\nRecipients\n2008\nThe 2008 award was presented to Professor Renée Van Vechten of the University of Redlands Department of Government.
