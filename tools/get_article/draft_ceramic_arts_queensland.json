They publish a fortnightly members' newsletter and a quarterly Bulletin magazine.\nHistory\nCeramic Arts Queensland (CAQ) was founded as the Queensland Potters' Association (QPA) in 1968 at St Mary’s Studio. Located in the basement of St Mary's Anglican Church, Kangaroo Point, St Mary's Studio was a site of significance in the development of Brisbane's emerging art scene, serving as a host to many art groups that have shaped the cultural landscape.\nThe organisation utilised rented premises until, with the assistance of the Queensland Government, was able to secure permanent premises with the purchase of the Fortitude Valley Primitive Methodist Church in 1982. The Association refurbished the building and added a steel-framed mezzanine floor, designed by conservation architect Richard Allom.   In 1983 it opened The Potters' Gallery on the premises. The lower floor was used to display and sell members' work and the mezzanine was used as a space for solo, or other special, exhibitions.\nThe church hall building, located behind the church, was used as a teaching space, offering classes and workshops for both beginners and advanced makers.\nAs the membership base of the organisation was expanded to include glassworkers, the organisation was renamed to Fusions: Australian Network of Clay and Glass Artists in 2003.\nThe church building was refurbished from 2005 to 2008 as part of a plan to establish an art-focused exhibition and retail complex.\nCeramic Arts Queensland (CAQ) holds regular workshops, demonstrations, and lectures for both members and non-members. They publish a members' only newsletter fortnightly and the quarterly Bulletin magazine. An exhibition of members' ceramic work, called 'Elemental', is held annually. Every two years CAQ hosts the Siliceous Award for Ceramic Excellence that is open to both members and non-members throughout Australia.\nPermanent Collection\nThe Permanent Collection was given initial impetus following the gift of a bowl by Harry Davis, presented to the Queensland Potters' Association in 1972. The collection comprises more than 200 pieces of work by Australian makers, including Joan Campbell, Gwyn Hanssen Pigott, Milton Moon, Owen Rye, and Carl McConnell.\nAn English-made china dinnerware set, decorated with an image of the Fortitude Valley Methodist Church, was given to the Queensland Potters' Association by the parishioners at the last service in the church before the building was handed over to them as the new owners. This set was added to the Permanent Collection.\nThe Collection was expanded in 2019 with the significant donation of a collection by Geoff Crispin, a ceramic maker, collector, and life member of Ceramic Arts Queensland.\nSiliceous Award\nThe Siliceous Award for Ceramic Excellence is a biennial event.\nThe inaugural Siliceous Award for Ceramic Excellence was held in 2015. From the years 2015-2019 (inclusive) the Award was presented annually, with only CAQ members eligible to enter, and held in conjunction with the annual members’ exhibition at the Brisbane Institute of Art.\nFrom 2021, the Award was made a biennial acquisitive prize, open to all Australian citizens and permanent residents, with the winning piece added to the Permanent Collection.\nIn 2023 the Award included the Gwyn Hanssen Pigott Wood Fired Ceramics Award presented by the Australian Wood Firers United.\nThe next Award will be held in March 2025 at the Brisbane Institute of Art.\nWinners of the Siliceous Award\nSiliceous #8 2025\nWinner: Tamasin Pepper Wrapped Rust and Flight\nHighly Commended: Cathy Franzi Coochin Hills Grevillea and Graham Hay Unravel Vase: Mortal Coil Series, presented by The Australian Ceramics Association.\nGwyn Hanssen Pigott Wood Fired Ceramics Award, presented by Australian Wood Firers United: Ben Richardson Foliage Vase - Cairn Series\nJudge: Dr Julie Bartholomew\nSiliceous #7 2023\nWinner: Astrid Salomon Dark Fruit\nHighly Commended: Ruby Yeh Meditation on San Zi Jing, Simone Fraser Surfaced Tension II, Euan Craig Igusa Hidaskuki Tea Bowl, Jennifer Oh The Long Tether, Lauren Joffe Hold, Csongvay Blackwood Fold the Line, Version 7.\nGwyn Hanssen Pigott Wood Fired Ceramics Award, presented by Australian Wood Firers United: Ray Cavill The Fire and The Flood II\nJudge: Dr Rebecca Coates\nThe 2023 Award was held at the Ipswich Community Gallery and included a community program of floor talks, guided tours, and a pop up studio for members of the public.\nSiliceous #6 2021\nWinner: Nicolette Johnson Nine Tendrils\nHighly Commended, sponsored by Walker Ceramics: John Tuckwell A Mind of its Own\nPeople’s Choice Award, sponsored by Qld Electrical Solutions: Paula Bowie A Bunya Dreaming x Trio of Jars.\nJudge: Diana Warnes, Head of Curatorial Projects, Home of the Arts, Gold Coast\nThe 2021 Award was held at The Butter Factory Arts Centre in Cooroy.\nSiliceous #5 2019\nWinner: Tatsuya Tsutsui Pomegranate\nHighly Commended: Bill Powell Metallica, Maryke Miller Abstract Connection, Dianne Peach Optimist or Not – Challenging the Growth Myth, Lee Berryman Kaleidoscope II, Liz Sofield Stitch One, Coil One, Drop One, Phillip Johnson Daydreamer\nJudge: Janet DeBoos\nSiliceous #4 2018\nWinner: Larissa Warren Subterranean\nHighly Commended: Anne Mossman Seams of Uncertainty, Bill Powell Arid Traces III, Mollie Bosworth Mystery Flight, Tatsuya Tsutsui Mizusachi, Angus McDiarmid Angophora Vase.\nJudge: Glenn Cooke\nSiliceous #3 2017\nWinner: Mollie Bosworth Letting Go\nHighly Commended: Bill Powell Galilee Depression, Tatsuya Tsutsui Lotus, Shannon Garson The Epic Flight of the Arctic Tern, Anne Mossman Nerikomi Bowl.\nCommended: Carol Forster A Walk by the Sea, Laura Phillips Baker’s Dozen\nJudge: Greg Daly\nSiliceous #2 2016\nWinner: Rowley Drysdale Oceania #7\nHighly Commended: Ann Mossman, Megan Puls, Kirstin Farr, Johanna DeMaine, Mollie Bosworth.\nJudge: Ted Secombe\nSiliceous #1 2015\nWinner: Megan Puls Tidal – Ebbtide Series\nHighly Commended: Chantal and Corey Biever, Robyn Gill, Peter Biddulph\nPeople’s Choice Award, sponsored by The Clay Shed: Bill Powell\nJudge: Damon Moon\nIan Currie Memorial Lecture\nIan Currie was a potter and glaze researcher who studied and worked with clay and glazes for over 30 years in south-east Queensland.

In his book, Stoneware Glazes: A Systematic Approach, Ian Currie , Currie says, “I learned as much as any of my students .... I would like to express my gratitude to my many friends in QPA who contributed so much to the development of the course”.\nThe annual Ian Currie Memorial Lecture aims to foster continued work in the field of pottery glaze research by other leading ceramic artists. Previous presenters include: Mitsuo Shoji, Jeff Mincham, Stephen Bowers, Dennis Forshaw, Paul Davis and Jacqueline Clayton, Renton Bishopric, Greg Daly, and Dr Steve Harrison.\nOther Notable Exhibitions\nThe exhibition ''Australian Ceramics '82'' was held as part of the Commonwealth Festival, a concurrent program with the 1982 Commonwealth Games held in Brisbane.
