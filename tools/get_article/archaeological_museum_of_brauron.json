Much of the collection is derived from excavations in the Sanctuary of Artemis at Brauron. Of note is a statue representing a small girl, a so-called \"bear\" (arktoi) (Medvedicka).\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090101100953/http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/1/eh155.jsp?obj_id=3359 Hellenic Ministry of Culture and Tourism]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100412123042/http://www.planetware.com/attica/brauron-gr-cen-brauro.htm www.planetware.com]"
