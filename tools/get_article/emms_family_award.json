The winner is also nominated for the CHL Rookie of the Year. The award was donated by Hap Emms. Leighton \"Hap\" Emms was a coach, owner, general manager and pioneer of the game, with a 33-year presence in the Ontario Hockey Association. His involvement in the Barrie Flyers, Niagara Falls Flyers, and St. Catharines Black Hawks, led to eight Memorial Cup tournament appearances, winning four times.\nWinners\nList of winners of the Emms Family Award.\n* Blue background denotes also named CHL Rookie of the Year\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
