      "text": "# Forward operating site__disambig_1\n\nA forward operating site (FOS) or forward operating location (FOL) is a U.S. military term for facilities, defined as \"a scalable, 'warm' facility that can support sustained operations, but with only a small permanent presence of support or contractor personnel as opposed to a FOB or MOB. A FOS will host occasional rotational forces and many contain pre-positioned equipment.\" These sites were established as the Pentagon began to address regional threats primarily in Africa and Latin America following its 2004 global posture review.\nAn FOS is differentiated from a cooperative security location (CSL) with no permanent force or contractor personnel, or a forward operating base (FOB) and main operating base (MOB), with a large force and a well-defended site.\nLocations\nThey include, but are not limited to the following locations:\nAsia\n* Paya Lebar Airfield, Singapore\nCaribbean\n* Curaçao International Airport, Curaçao, Kingdom of the Netherlands\n* Queen Beatrix International Airport, Aruba, Kingdom of the Netherlands\nCentral America\n* Soto Cano AB, Honduras\nEurope\n* RAF Fairford, United Kingdom\n* Bulgaria, see List of joint US-Bulgarian military bases\n* Mihail Kogălniceanu Air Base, Romania\nAfrica\n* Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti\n* Morocco\n* Tunisia\nSee also\n* Loss of Strength Gradient\n* Forward operating base (FOB)\n* Naval outlying landing field\n* Satellite airfield\n* List of established military terms\nReferences"
