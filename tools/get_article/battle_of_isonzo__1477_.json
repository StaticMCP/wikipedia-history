The Ottomans emerged victorious during the battle.\nBackground\nin 1420, Venice began expanding in Friuli by taking over it from Patria del Friuli. This area served the Venetians well during their war with the Ottomans between 1463 and 1479 when it was a target for Ottoman Akinji. In 1472, the Ottomans launched a raid reaching the gates of Udine. The next year, another serious raid happened. In response, Venice built earthen forts from Gorizia to  Aquileia. On November 26, 1476, an Ottoman raid reached Koper, taking many slaves. The defenses proved ineffective to the Ottoman raiders.\nBattle\nIn October 1477, the Ottomans launched another raid, they were led by Skender Pasha, a Greco-Genoese, and Turahanoğlu Ömer Bey. The Ottomans successfully captured the bridge at Gorizia before the news of the raids reached the Venetian camp at Gradisca d'Isonzo. Ömer Bey led a force of 1,000 cavalry to cross the Isonzo River and began preparing for an ambush. Despite his father's warning, the Venetian commander, Girolamo Novella of Verona, marched to meet the Ottoman, making a major mistake. Girolamo's son set out in pursuit of the raiders. They fell into the ambush and routed. A fierce fighting ensued in which Girolamo and his son, alongside another commander by the name of Giacomo Badoer were killed. Apart from many killed, the Ottomans also captured numerous prisoners; including Count Antonio Caldora, Iacopo Piccinino, and Philippo de Navolin of Mantua. The Ottomans then crossed the Tagliamento and Isonso rivers, ravaging at will.\nAftermath\nThe raid created terror in Venice. Venice continued its war, despite being abandoned by many of its allies. Both sides made a peace treaty in February 1479.\nReferences\nSources\n*Franz Babinger (1978), Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time.[https://archive.org/details/mehmedconqueror00fran/page/357/mode/1up]\n*James D.
