The Norman Richard de Clare attacked the Gaelic Irish chieftain Conchobhar ÓDeághaidh, chief of the Cineal Fearmaic and ally of Muircheartach ÓBriain, but he was defeated.\nDeághaidh]]Clann ÓBriainClann Mac ConmaraClann Ó Hehir\n| combatant2  = Lordship of Ireland\n| commander1  = Conchobhar ÓDeághaidh\n| commander2  = Lord Thomond †\n| strength1   = Unknown\n| strength2   = Unknown\n| casualties1 = 80 dead\n| casualties2 = 400–500 dead\n| casualties3 =\n| notes       =\n}}\nPrecursors to war\nThe Bruce invasion of Ireland enabled the outbreak of a number of small wars that had little, if anything, pertaining to the Scots. Perhaps the most notable was the battle at Dysert O'Dea which erupted in Brian Boru's old Kingdom of Thomond in 1318.\nTwo factions of the O'Brien clan had been fighting for generations for supremacy in Thomond. Murtough O'Brien, the descendant of Toirdelbach UaBriain was the rightful King of Thomond. A challenger appeared in the form of Mahon O'Brien, allied with the opposing faction of the family, which paid its homage to Brian O'Brien. This side of the family was allied with the powerful Anglo-Norman Richard deClare, a relative of Strongbow. DeClare ruled over much of western Ireland from his castle at Bunratty, yet the English respected Thomond as a sovereign state and remained outside its borders. However, deClare's alliance with Mahon O'Brien provided an excuse to invade Thomond. His Pale Englishmen would meet in a pitched battle against Murtough's Irish in the Battle of Dysert O'Dea.\nDuring this time, Donnchadh, an ally of deClare, was overwhelmingly defeated in the Battle of Lough Raska near Corcomruadh Abbey.\nOrder of battle\nWhen news arrived of his allies' defeat at Corcomruadh, Richard deClare decided to attack the Gaelic stronghold at Dysert O'Dea. His troops arrived at Ruan on the morning of 10 May 1318, and were divided into three columns. The first division was headed by de Clare's son and marched northwards to Tullach O'Dea in an effort to cut off any help which might arrive from O'Connor of Ennistymon. The second column travelled southwards towards Magowna to quell any support from that direction. The third division was commanded by deClare himself and marched westwards towards Dysert O'Dea, the home of Conor O'Dea. O'Dea intentionally made his forces look few in number, for some time fighting in retreat, and when deClare charged for an attack the Anglo-Normans were ambushed. Richard deClare was felled by an axe and his son was killed by a Feilim O'Connor. The O'Deas were reinforced by the O'Connors and later the O'Briens, who turned the tide of a potentially unpredictable battle along with further decisive assistance from the O'Hehir and MacNamaras; and the English were soon defeated. Following their victory, the Irish marched back to the deClare settlement, only to find that deClare's wife had set it aflame, including Bunratty Castle, and had returned to England.\nOver eighty Englishmen of noble birth and many foot soldiers were killed in the battle. The Kingdom of Thomond remained beyond foreign control for over two hundred and fifty years, until 1570.\nSee also\n* O'Dea Castle\n* O'Dea Clan\n* Seán mac Ruaidhrí Mac Craith (fl. 14th-century), author of Caithréim Thoirdhealbhaigh.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/archaeology/CL025-114---.htm Battle of Dysert O'Dea at Clare County Library]\n*[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100062/index.html The Triumphs of Turlough] – Caithréim Thoirdhealbhaigh, by Seán mac Ruaidhrí Mac Craith.
