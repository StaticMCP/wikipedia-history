Buschkens\n|commander2 =\n|casualties1 = 151–161 killed\n|casualties2 = Light\n}}\nThe Battle of Kroyo was an engagement of the Java War which took place on 1 October 1828 near the village of Kroyo in Purworejo, in modern Central Java. A Dutch column, pursuing a small group of Javanese rebels, encountered a much larger force than they had expected, and was destroyed in a later ambush.\nPrelude\nIn 1828, the Dutch intensified their construction of fortifications to deny rebel forces in the Java War territorial control. To defeat Diponegoro's army, Dutch command under Hendrik Merkus de Kock deployed eight mobile columns with a strength of around 500 men each. One of these columns, commanded by Major Buschkens, operated in the vicinity of the  west of Yogyakarta.\nBattle\nOn 30 September 1828, Buschkens' unit received information of a rebel force crossing the Bogowonto, and began pursuit. Initial Dutch reports suggested the rebels having 300 soldiers under ; however, when Buschkens encountered them, they had grown to 2,000. Buschkens commanded a column of infantrymen, along with 80 cavalry. Upon encountering the rebel force, he found it to be too large, and initially refrained from attacking. He instead shadowed the enemy force and successfully prevented it from crossing another river. This continued until night. The following day, the rebel force moved upstream to ford at an unguarded crossing. Buschkens continued to follow the rebel force, unaware that they were leading him into an ambush near the village of Kroya.\nWhen the two forces met, Buschkens ordered his cavalry to attack with the support of Yogyakartan troops in his column. The rebels sprung their trap then, appearing from cover to attack Buschkens' remaining infantrymen at the rear – native auxiliaries recruited from Sumenep and Tegal. These units were quickly routed, and Buschkens fled the battle with his cavalry unit. In his report to de Kock, Buschkens listed losses as between 151 and 161 dead, including 5 European soldiers. Most of Buschkens' losses were incurred from his rear infantry. He also mentioned that, aside from the cavalry which remained largely intact, only twelve infantrymen managed to rejoin him after the defeat.\nAftermath\nDespite the victory, the rebels' overall situation did not improve, and the Dutch continued to restrict the mobility of their forces through Bentengsteelsel.\nReferences"
