It was serialized in Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine and Magazine Special from October 1995 to November 1996; a follow-up sequel, Shin Chūka Ichiban!, was serialized in Weekly Shōnen Magazine from January 1997 to May 1999. Both series' overall chapters were collected in seventeen  volumes. The story is centered on Liu Mao Xing, a boy whose aim is to become the best chef he could be. In November 2017, Ogawa started a sequel entitled Chūka Ichiban! Kiwami, published on Kodansha's Magazine Pocket app.\nA 52-episode anime television series adaptation by Nippon Animation aired on Fuji TV from April 1997 to September 1998. A  24-episode anime television series adaptation of Shin Chūka Ichiban!, titled True Cooking Master Boy, produced by NAS and Production I.G, aired for two seasons from October to December 2019 and January to March 2021, respectively.\nPlot\nThe story takes place in 19th-century China during the Qing dynasty, where the Emperor was weakened, and the country was close to chaos. It is also during a fictitious era called \"The Era of the Cooking Wars\". It was an era in which top chefs with different cooking styles tried their best to improve their skills and to become the best chef in China. It is a country where insulting a high-grade chef or fooling around with cooking could land a person in a jail, and impersonating a top-chef is as bad as usurpation of authority. Chefs compete with each other in order to gain respect and even power, but also with the risks of losing everything.\nAfter the death of Mao's mother, Pai, who was called the \"Goddess of Cuisine\", Mao becomes a Super Chef in order to take the title as Master Chef of his mother's restaurant. However, before he takes his mother's place as Master Chef, he continues to travel China in order to learn more of the many ways of cooking, in the hopes of becoming a legendary chef, just like his mother. During his journey, he meets great friends and fierce rivals who wish to challenge him in the field of cooking.\nCharacters\nMain characters\n; )}}\n:\n:Mao is a 13-year-old boy raised in his mother’s restaurant, where he develops a deep passion for cooking and inherits her skills. Despite his knowledge, he rarely cooks, leading others to assume he lacks culinary ability. When his mother’s restaurant faces crisis, Mao reveals his exceptional talent, surprising everyone. Recognized as a prodigy by General Lee, he embarks on a journey to become a Super Chef, eventually earning the title as the youngest in history. Driven by curiosity and his mother’s belief that a chef’s duty is to bring joy through food, Mao prioritizes his customers’ satisfaction. His extraordinary palate allows him to recall every dish he has tasted, identifying ingredients with precision, making him a formidable culinary talent.\n; )}}\n:\n:Mei Li is the 16-year-old daughter of Chouyu and a former helper at the Yang Spring Restaurant. She develops feelings for Mao after witnessing his dedication to cooking and kindness toward others. Though her culinary knowledge is limited, she assists Mao with minor tasks and trivia. When Mao departs to travel China, she is devastated, having hoped for a future with him, and ultimately decides to join him (though the manga excludes her from his journey). Prone to jealousy, she frequently clashes with Shirou and reacts aggressively when other women approach Mao, such as mistaking his sister Karin for a romantic rival. Her fiercest competition for Mao’s affection, however, is his passion for cooking. Mei Li strongly resembles her late mother, Meika.\n;Si Lang/\n:\n:Shirou is a 12-year-old mischievous traveler of mixed Japanese and Chinese heritage. Mao and Mei Li find him unconscious from hunger in the forest (in the manga, he crashes into Mao after stealing food). He left his village at age 10 to become a Super Chef but returns two years later pretending to hold the title, only to be exposed when officials reveal his badge is fake. After discovering Mao is a real Super Chef, Shirou declares himself Mao’s apprentice. Though only an average cook, he knows more than Mei Li and constantly annoys her with teasing and inappropriate behavior, leading to violent retaliation. He later trains as a chef at the Yang Spring Restaurant.\n;\n:\n:Xie Lu, called \"Steel Staff Xie\", is a Dim Sum master from San Sei and the youngest to hold this title. He carries a steel staff used for both combat and cooking, its end marked with yellow stars representing defeated Super Chefs. After losing to Mao, he engraves a black star, hoping to someday change it to yellow. A wandering chef since youth, he frequently encounters Mao's group during their travels. His cheerful demeanor contrasts with his dislike of Shirou, stemming from a poorly prepared meal. Athletic and mathematically gifted, he later joins their search for the Legendary Cooking Utensils. His Fookien name is Ji Long.\n;Lei En/\n:\n:Leon, a skilled seafood chef and knife master, first appears as a Dark Cooking Society member demanding a Legendary Cooking Utensil from Yang Spring Restaurant. After losing to Mao in battle, he reveals he's actually another Ever-Soul knife successor who left the Society. Once a prodigy at Yang Spring, young Leon mastered cooking techniques rapidly but showed compassion by placing talismans on animals he cooked. His relentless pursuit of knowledge led him to the Dark Cooking Society, where he obtained the legendary Seven-Star Knives through questionable means. Now remorseful, he joins Mao to prevent the Society from acquiring the Legendary Utensils, despite encountering another chef wielding duplicate knives.\n;\n:}}\n:San Jie, a 14-year-old Shanghai chef, was a resentful 4th-level cook at Yang Spring Restaurant who feared Mao would replace him. Though perceived as lazy, Mao discovered him secretly practicing at night, revealing his hidden passion. San Jie confessed his traumatic past—his strict chef father's harsh training caused a hand injury and family conflict, driving him to run away. The scar reminded him of these painful memories, affecting his knife skills. After Mao convinced him not to quit, they devised a plan to save San Jie's position. Ultimately, San Jie chose to return home to reconcile with his father and resume training. When they later reunite in Shanghai, San Jie has become head chef at his father's restaurant, having significantly refined his skills.\n;\n:\n:Fei, a 16-year-old culinary prodigy, emerges as Mao's most skilled rival. Calm and methodical, he first appears as Mao's opponent in the Super Chef tournament, where they simultaneously pass the test. Though seemingly cold, he assists Mao during the competition. Orphaned by the Dark Cooking Society, Fei endured brutal training until escaping to Kikkaro Restaurant. Pai's kindness showed him cooking's true purpose—bringing joy. When they reunite, Fei appears as a Society member about to lead the Imperial Kitchen. After losing to Mao, he reveals he was drugged and manipulated. Though guilty of wrongdoing, he joins Mao's quest under General Lee's orders to protect him while seeking redemption.\n;\n:\n:Pai, known as the \"Sichuan Fairy\" or \"Fairy of Cuisine\", was a legendary Sichuan chef and Mao's late mother. As former Master Chef of Kikkaro Restaurant, she earned nationwide respect. Though she never formally taught Mao techniques, she instilled in him the philosophy of cooking to bring joy and health. The Underground Cooking Society viewed Pai as a threat, frequently sending challengers she consistently defeated. She documented their Dark Cooking Techniques in a notebook later inherited by Mao. The manga reveals she died from overwork after her pupil Shao An poached her staff. Her culinary legacy lives on through Mao.\nMinor characters\n;\n:\n:Zhou Yu, Vice Chef of Yang Spring Restaurant, ranks among Guangzhou's finest chefs. As Ruoh rarely cooks, he manages the kitchen with strict discipline. Though known for his steel-hearted demeanor and unchanging expression, he commands deep respect. Only Ruoh can provoke him or sway his decisions. He becomes Mao's mentor and is revealed as Mei's father. Despite his culinary mastery, he proves inept as a fisherman, losing badly to Ruoh in a fishing challenge. His failed attempt to outfish Ruoh leaves him visibly frustrated, showcasing one of his few emotional displays.\n;\n:\n:Ruoh, Master Chef of Yang Spring Restaurant, is a highly respected culinary figure in Guangzhou. Despite his advanced age, he possesses remarkable physical strength, earning him the nickname \"Superman Chef\". His legendary \"Skill of God\" technique, demonstrated with the mighty Devil Cow Knife (capable of butchering an entire cow in two strokes), showcases his power, though he rarely uses it now. One of Guangzhou's four Cooking Elders and Chouyu's mentor, Ruoh maintains a relaxed demeanor, often seen drinking alcohol. His unassuming appearance belies both his culinary mastery and his surprising physical prowess.\n;\n:\n:Shao An, once Pai's star apprentice, became Mao's first rival after an accident left him scarred and unable to cook. Bitter and vengeful, he returned to seize Kikkaro Restaurant, contributing to Pai's death and tormenting her son. After losing a judged cooking battle to Mao, he was forced to quit as a chef—only to resurface as an Underground Cooking Society member. Defeated again, Shao An attempted a final act of vengeance by detonating their boat. As he fell, Mao tried to save him. Redeemed by Mao's words, Shao An severed his own hand to prevent dragging Mao down (in the anime, he simply slips). Before dying, he gave Mao the missing half of Pai's Underground research.\n;\n:\n:An Imperial Army Admiral and Master Chef of the Emperor's Imperial Kitchen who holds the highest culinary rank in China. Recognizing Mao's exceptional talent, he sends him on a journey to become a Super Chef. Throughout Mao's travels, Lee frequently appears to assign additional challenges, aiming to cultivate Mao's potential into true greatness. As the nation's top chef, Lee serves as both mentor and evaluator, testing Mao's growth at key moments while guiding him toward culinary mastery. His appearances often mark important turning points in Mao's development as a chef.\n;\n:\n:Mao's older sister. She works at the Kikkaro Restaurant as a waitress. When her mother died, she was the one left to take care of the restaurant.\n;\n:\n;\n:}}\n;\n:}}\n;\n:}}\n;\n:}}\n;\n:}}\nMedia\nManga\nWritten and illustrated by Etsushi Ogawa, Chūka Ichiban! was first serialized in Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine from October 11, 1995, to May 29, 1996.
