There is insufficient material available for further verification and study.\nWhen Emperor Ankan died, he had no offspring; and succession passed to his youngest brother , who will come to be known as Emperor Senka. Emperor Senka was elderly at the time of his enthronement; and his reign is said to have endured for only three years.\nSenka's contemporary title would not have been tennō, as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō. Rather, it was presumably , meaning \"the great king who rules all under heaven\". Alternatively, Senka might have been referred to as  or the \"Great King of Yamato\".\nDuring this reign, Soga no Iname is believed to have been the first verifiable Omi (also Ōomi, \"Great Minister\").\nThe Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (misasagi) at Nara. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Senka's mausoleum. It is formally named Musa no Tsukisaka no e no misasagi; however, the actual sites of the graves of the early Emperors remain problematic, according to some historians and archaeologists.\nGenealogy\n*Empress: , Emperor Ninken's daughter\n**, married to Emperor Kinmei\n**, married to Emperor Kinmei\n**, married to Emperor Kinmei\n**\n**Child (died early, gender unknown)\n*Consort:\n**|火焔皇子}}\n*Mother unknown\n**, married to Emperor Kinmei\n**, speculated as Emperor Kinmei's son\nSee also\n* Emperor of Japan\n* List of Emperors of Japan\n* Imperial cult\nNotes\nReferences\n* Aston, William George.
