The album, long delayed by Fleetwood Mac's reunion tour in the 1990s and 2003 album Say You Will, was his first solo release in 14 years. Under the Skin peaked at number 80 on the Billboard 200 album chart in October 2006. In the United States, the album sold 13,000 copies during its first week of release, with 32 percent of those sales coming from purchases on the Internet. \"Show You How\" was also released as a single but failed to chart.\nMusic\nPredominantly an acoustic album, the album does not feature many instruments besides acoustic guitar and percussion. Buckingham sought to forgo the more ornate elements on his previous albums in favor of orienting compositions around vocals and a single guitar. Buckingham wrote most of the material for Under the Skin while he was touring with Fleetwood Mac. He recorded the material on a Korg 16-track unit and mixed them onto CDs in hotel rooms during days off from live performances. He also used a Roland delay on his vocals and said that the recording process was conducted \"in an orderly, overdubbed manner, but with just the limitations that I wanted to impose on the tracks.\" In an interview with Sound & Vision, Buckingham discussed his approach in recording Under the Skin.\n\"Someone's Gotta Change Your Mind\" and \"Down on Rodeo\" predated the other songs on Under the Skin and were recorded with Rob Cavallo ten years prior at Ocean Way Recording in Hollywood. He said that these songs were already \"mixed and ready to go\" for Fleetwood Mac's Say You Will album, released in 2003. Some tracks on Under the Skin were also recorded at Buckingham's home studio on a 48-track machine.\n\"Down on Rodeo\", which was written about Buckingham's brief relationship with Anne Heche, and \"Someone's Gotta Change Your Mind\" are the only two songs on the record with contributions from outside musicians. These two songs, along with \"To Try For the Sun\", were also included on a Gift of Screws bootleg that was leaked online in 2001.\nWhen Buckingham was completing a take for \"Flying Down Juniper\", Buckingham's son Will beckoned him for dinner through the studio intercom, which was caught on tape. \"I'd just finished the take, and all of a sudden, 'Dinner, Daddy!' So I had to leave it in. It's a perfect ending.\"\nBuckingham said that many songs on Under the Skin presented him with an opportunity for self-discovery. He also recalled that the album received a lukewarm response from Warner Brothers, who expressed a lack of interest in promoting it. \"When I turned in Under The Skin, their general response was 'Yeah we'll put it out, but don't expect us to do too much.'\" Warner Brothers requested the addition of more conventional rock songs to make the album more marketable.\nCritical reception\nAllMusic writer Thom Jurek noted how several songs felt autobiographical and described the album as \"the most nakedly visible and tender recording he's ever dropped.\"\nChris Willman of Entertainment Weekly complimented Buckingham's  \"frantic\" guitar fingerpicking and said that his production work enhanced the sound of his nylon-string guitar. Willman added that despite the album's nominally stripped back nature, some of Buckingham's recording techniques, including the use of mulitracked vocals, prevented the album from being truly unplugged. Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone thought that Buckingham achieved \"maximum effect from minimal arrangements\" and said that  \"Down on Rodeo\" resembled a \"lost Fleetwood Mac hit.\" Mat Snow of The Guardian called the album \"a small masterpiece of tightly balanced musical contrasts.\"\nTrack listing\nAll songs composed by Lindsey Buckingham except where noted.\nPersonnel\nMain performer\n* Lindsey Buckingham – vocals, guitars, bass, keyboards, percussion\nAdditional personnel\n* John McVie – bass (9)\n* Mick Fleetwood – drums (9, 10), percussion (9, 10)\n* David Campbell – orchestration (10)\nProduction\n* Lindsey Buckingham – producer, recording (1–8, 11), mixing (1–8, 11), additional photography\n* Rob Cavallo – producer (9, 10)\n* Ken Allardyce – recording (9, 10)\n* Mark Needham – mixing (9, 10)\n* Brian Gardner – mastering\n* Bernie Grundman Mastering (Hollywood, California) – mastering location\n* Frank Ockenfels III – photography\n* Stephen Walker – art direction\n* Tony Dimitriades – management\n* Robert Richards – management\nMusic promo videos\nThree promotional music videos were shot for Under the Skin, these included \"It Was You\", \"Show You How\" and \"Shut Us Down\".
