An Objectivist, he was best known for his Sparrowhawk series of novels, which were set in England and Virginia before the American Revolutionary War. He also wrote numerous detective novels, and was noted as a critic of Islam on his blog The Rules of Reason.\nBackground\nCline was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and attended South Texas Junior College. He served in the U.S. Air Force from 1964 to 1965. He was active as a writer from 1972, and worked numerous different jobs, including in \"factories, construction, airline and publishing communications, inventory management, banking, computer sales, insurance, and as a computer screen designer, book editor, copyeditor, and proofreader.\"\nBooks and writing\nApart from the Sparrowhawk series,\n*\n*\n*}} Cline's other fiction included a contemporary detective series (featuring Chess Hanrahan, who solves paradoxical murders),\n*\n*\n*\n*}} a suspense series (featuring American entrepreneur Merritt Fury), and a period detective series (featuring Cyrus Skeen in 1920s San Francisco).\nCline was also known for his writings on aesthetics, his defenses of capitalism and of free speech, and his criticisms of contemporary political trends and of Islam (and religion in general). As a writer, his strongest influence was the novelist Ayn Rand and her philosophy of Objectivism. Cline wrote on freedom of speech and censorship issues for The Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science and The Journal of Information Ethics. He wrote feature and cover stories, as well as book reviews, for Marine Corps League Magazine, The Colonial Williamsburg Journal, The Wall Street Journal, and The Intellectual Activist. His article on English political philosopher John Locke was carried in two editions of Western Civilization (McGraw-Hill). He wrote the Rules of Reason blog, and his columns also appeared in Capitalism Magazine, Family Security Matters, and other blog sites. He also wrote a \"counter-jihad handbook\" about Islam.\nIn May 2016, Cline was informed by the FBI that his name was on a list of over 8,000 names that was characterized as an Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) kill list. Cline's landlord promptly evicted him from his Williamsburg, Virginia apartment. In an interview with Vocativ Cline said, \"The situation is unprecedented in my lifetime experience. I've never before been evicted or thrown under the bus for what I think and write.\" According to Vocativ, Cline had \"spent the last 15 years raging against Islam and the existential threat he believes it poses to western civilization.\" A fundraising in support of Cline raised more than $14,000, after his story was covered by online outlets such as FrontPage Magazine and Gates of Vienna.\nCline is reported to have died in 2023.\nBibliography\nSparrowhawk series\n*Sparrowhawk One: Jack Frake, MacAdam/Cage Publishing, 2001,\n*Sparrowhawk Two: Hugh Kenrick MacAdam/Cage
