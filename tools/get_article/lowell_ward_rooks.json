His university studies were cut short by the American entry into World War I. He later studied at the Infantry School (1926−1927), the Command and General Staff College (1933−1935) and the Army War College (1936−1937).\nRooks rose through the ranks of the United States Army, serving overseas in World War I and on the Mexico–United States border. He was an instructor at the Infantry School from 1930 to 1933 and at the Command and General Staff College from 1937 to 1941. From 1941 to 1942 he served as chief of the ground forces training division of the Army War College. In June 1942 he became chief of staff of II Corps.Forrest C.
