Fans of Pond, the Velvet Underground, and Lou Reed should find plenty to love in this phenomenal piece of retro-rock work.\" Austin Trunick of Under the Radar said: \"The record taps into old AM hippie rock territory ... Motown, soul, acid rock ... and even classic French pop.\" In a favourable review for NME, Lisa Wright states that \"Foxygen have managed to spray every shade from their bizarre, Technicolor imaginations onto a record that bursts with lovable eccentricities, but never tries too hard.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n;Foxygen\n*Sam France – lead and backing vocals, piano, horns\n*Jonathan Rado – guitars, bass, piano, organ, percussion, synthesizers, mellotron\n;Additional musicians\n*Richard Swift – piano, organ, guitars, bass, drums, percussion, vocals, synthesizers, mellotron, theremin, glockenspiel\n*Jessie Baylin – backing vocals (track 4)\n*Sarah Versprille – backing vocals (track 4)\n*Crumbs – backing vocals (track 3)\n*Luke Suzumoto – handclaps, artwork\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.jagjaguwar.com/onesheet.php?cat=JAG227 FOXYGEN | We Are the 21st Century Ambassadors of Peace & Magic :: JAGJAGUWAR]"
