      "text": "# Froggatt Awards\n\nThe Froggatt Award is presented to people who have made a major contribution to protecting Australia's native plants and animals, ecosystems, and people from dangerous new invasive species.\nThe Froggatt Awards are named in honour of Australian entomologist Walter Froggatt, who, when the cane toad was released into Australia in the 1930s to control beetle infestations in the sugar cane industry, was a lone voice, lobbying the federal government to exercise caution.\nHistory\nThe Froggatt Awards were first presented in 2003, by the Invasive Species Council.\nFrom 2003 to 2006 there was only one award per year.\nNo awards were issued from 2007 to 2014.\nFrom 2015 there have been multiple awards presented, one each for various categories of activity determined each year. -->\nThe original trophy was a stuffed cane toad, but is now a framed certificate.\nName\nIn 2006 the award was temporarily renamed from the Froggatt Award to the Biosecure Australia Award, and renamed back to the Froggatt Award in 2015 when the awards recommenced.\nThe Biosecure Australia Award was to be presented annually in recognition of an outstanding contribution to the eradication, early warning, preventative action, awareness raising or management of an invasive species in Australia.\nCoverage\nIn 2017 the award received exceptionally extensive coverage within Australia, and also international coverage, when it was awarded to the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, Barnaby Joyce. This was in recognition of the minister's actions when pet dogs Pistol and Boo were brought to Australia by Johnny Depp and his partner Amber Heard in contravention of the Biosecurity Act 2015.\nRecipients\n2017 Froggatt Award\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
