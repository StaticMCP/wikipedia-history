Dame Sandra Mason, the incumbent president was elected and replaced Queen Elizabeth II as head of state of Barbados when she was sworn in on 30 November 2021, and will complete her term on 30 November 2025.\nLt. Col. Jeffrey Bostic was nominated jointly on 16 September 2025, thereby making him the only candidate to be presented for this election. His candidacy was not objected to in the joint sitting of Parliament in which the election took place. Thus, he was acclaimed as President-elect, in accordance with the Constitution, in a walkover and will be sworn in on 30 November 2025.\nElectoral system\nThe president is elected indirectly by the Parliament of Barbados in the context of a joint sitting of Parliament.\nThe prime minister and the leader of the opposition jointly nominate a consensus candidate 90 days before the incumbent's term is due to expire, who is then elected in a walkover without a vote unless any MP lodges their objection. If an objection is lodged, the joint sitting is suspended and the two Houses of Parliament, the Senate and the House of Assembly, meet separately and each vote on accepting or rejecting the nominee. A two-thirds majority of valid votes in each house separately is then required to elect a candidate on all rounds of balloting.\nIf no consensus candidate is nominated by the 60th day before the end of the incumbent's term, the election is opened to other candidates. To gain ballot access in such an open election, a candidate must be nominated either by the prime minister, the leader of the Opposition, or at least ten members of the House of Assembly. The requirement for a two-thirds majority of valid votes in each house separately also applies in an open election; this means that if only one candidate has been nominated, the voting system is the same as when a consensus candidate has been objected to.\nCandidate\nLt. Col. Jeffrey Bostic, the former Minister of Health and Wellness, military officer and member of parliament for the City of Bridgetown, was the only candidate for the office; he was nominated jointly by the prime minister, Mia Mottley, and the leader of the opposition, Ralph Thorne.\nBostic was widely commended by the Barbadian public for his work in leading the island's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and for that reason, was awarded the Order of Freedom of Barbados on 28 April 2022, the island's National Heroes Day.\nGiven there were no objections at the joint sitting of Parliament, Bostic was declared  elected without a vote on 7 October 2025. Due to his election, Bostic will be sworn in on 30 November, which will be the 59th anniversary of Barbadian independence.\nReferences"
