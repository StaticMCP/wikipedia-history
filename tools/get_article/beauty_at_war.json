It premiered on TVB Jade in Hong Kong on April 22, 2013. Created by Chik and scriptwriter Chow Yuk-ming, it is a sequel to War and Beauty, which took place in a parallel universe. It stars  Sheren Tang, Ada Choi, Christine Ng, Moses Chan,  Kenny Wong,  Eddie Kwan, Raymond Cho & Rachel Kan. The events of the first installment are depicted as being the result of rumor-mongering, and are frequently referenced.\nPlot\nThe Consort Dowager Shun, Niohuru Yuen-sau (Christine Ng) bears a grudge against her half-sister Niohuru Yu-yuet, the current Consort Yu (Sheren Tang) because she believed that Consort Yu faked her illness during the selection ceremony so that Yuen-sau would be chosen as a concubine of the ailing Emperor, and when the Emperor dies, Yu-yuet will become the new Emperor's consort, rising in power and status and rendering Yuen-sau's status as a consort obsolete. This presumption, coupled with the intense hatred and bitterness building up in her for years caused Yuen-sau to spread rumors about Yu-yuet being an evil and manipulative person (this is seen in the events of War and Beauty). For many years, Yu-yuet tolerated with Yuen-sau and tried her best to reconcile with her but to no avail until a kunqu troupe whom the much lauded Ko Lau Fei (Moses Chan) is a part of enters the palace that Yu-yuet had the opportunity to reach out to Yuen-sau. Because the harem forbids males from entering, the appearance of Ko Lau Fei intrigued its members including the lonely Yuen-sau and wet nurse Seung-ling (Ada Choi), causing much distraught to Yu-yuet. The two sisters began to plot and scheme against each other, with Yuen-sau wanting to keep Ko Lau Fei in the palace and allying with the lunatic Tung Kat Hoi (Kenny Wong) and Yu-yuet planning to send Ko Lau Fei out of the palace with the help of her trusted maid, Yee-ho (Rachel Kan). However, when Yu-yuet found out that Seung-ling fell in love with Ko Lau Fei, it threaten to thwart her schemes.\nProduction\nDevelopment and casting\nIn August 2011, TVB announced the development of War and Beauty II, with executive producer Jonathan Chik and executive scriptwriter Chow Yuk-ming returning to produce.

Many blamed the scripting and slow pace of the story for the failure of the series, making it a disappointment despite generating much hype before its premiere. During its 4th week run, the series only managed to garner a 19-point ratings, marking an all-time low for a big budget TVB production. This has caused cast member Sheren Tang to publicly speak out against the drama's producers and scriptwriters for last minute changes to the scripts and the long hours of filming. Not all reviews were negative, however, as the public had also praised the performance of Ada Choi in episode 19, who portrayed the wet nurse, Seung-ling, where she lamented over the loss of her three children, saying that she deserved to win the Best Actress award at the annual TVB Anniversary Awards.\nViewership ratings\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"\n|- style=\"background:cornflowerblue; color:white\" align=\"center\"\n||Week||Episodes||Date||Average Points||Peaking Points\n|-\n|1||01－05||April 22–26, 2013||25||26\n|-\n|2||06－10||April 29 - May 3, 2013||22||25\n|-\n|3||11－15||May 6–10, 2013||22||25\n|-\n|4||16－20||May 13–17, 2013||21||24\n|-\n|5||21－25||May 20–24, 2013||25||28\n|-\n|6||26－30||May 27–31, 2013||28||33\n|}\nSee also\n*War and Beauty\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://programme.tvb.com/drama/beautyatwar/ Official TVB Website]\n*[http://k-tvb.net/new-series-beauty-at-war/ K for TVB] English Synopsis and Review"
