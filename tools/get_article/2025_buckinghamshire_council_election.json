Following the election, the council went under no overall control, with the Conservatives falling one seat short of a majority. This was the first election in the history of Buckinghamshire Council or its predecessor Buckinghamshire County Council at which the Conservative Party did not win a majority of councillor seats. After the election, Martin Tett resigned as leader, and a Conservative minority administration formed to run the council. The new Conservative group leader, Steven Broadbent, was formally confirmed as leader of the council at the subsequent annual council meeting on 21 May 2025.\nBackground\nAt the 2021 election, the Conservatives won a majority of seats. The 2025 election was held under new ward boundaries.\nPrevious council composition\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=2 rowspan=2|!Party\n!colspan=2|Seats\n|-\n! After2021 election\n!
