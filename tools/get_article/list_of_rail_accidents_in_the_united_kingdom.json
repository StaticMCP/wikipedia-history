Indirect railway-related incidents such as the King's Cross fire of 1987 or the 7 July 2005 London bombings are not included.\nWorst accidents\nThe worst accident was the Quintinshill rail disaster in Scotland in 1915 with 226 dead and 246 injured. The second worst, and the worst in England's peacetime history, was the 1952 Harrow and Wealdstone rail crash, which killed 112 people and injured 340. The death toll from the 1957 Lewisham rail crash was 90; for the 1889 Armagh rail disaster (the worst in Northern Ireland) it was 80; and for the 1879 Tay Bridge disaster it was 75. The worst rail accident in Wales was the 1868 Abergele rail disaster, with 33 dead.\nThe accident on the London Underground with the highest loss of life was the Moorgate tube crash which occurred on the Northern City Line in 1975 (which was at the time part of the London Underground Network), in which 43 died.\nMainline rail\nBefore 1830\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

There were 92 deaths from 50 accidents in 28 years when there was privatised rail between 31 January 1995 and 24 August 2021.\nLondon Underground\nDespite the high passenger numbers on the London Underground, and the substantial age of some its infrastructure, passenger fatalities due to train-related incidents are exceptionally rare. The last train collision that killed more than one person was the Moorgate tube crash in 1975. Between 1999 and 2020 there were seven derailments, which caused injuries (some severe) but no fatalities. The Chancery Lane derailment in 2003 led to a closure of the Central line whilst urgent safety checks were undertaken. Fatal accidents killed one person each in 2020, 2022 and 2023; two were passengers who fell onto the tracks and one was in a car that crashed into the railway line.\nTram and light rail\nFatal accidents have occurred involving trams; the worst took place in Dover in 1917, when a tram ran away down a hill and overturned, killing 11 people and injuring 60. In 2016, a tram derailed on a sharp bend and overturned in Croydon, killing seven people and injuring 50.\nStaff accidents\nFor much of the 19th and 20th centuries, working on the United Kingdom's railway was very dangerous for many staff. In 1900, for example, for every one passenger killed or injured in a crash, there were seven worker casualties. This amounted to 15,698 staff injuries and 631 fatalities.\nThe 'Railway Work, Life & Death' project is uncovering details of British and Irish staff accidents before 1939 and making them freely available, via a database of transcriptions of staff accident investigations and other related records. At March 2023, the database documented nearly 50,000 individuals.\nThe National Railway Museum has an online exhibit, looking at railway safety—with a focus on the staff.\nGallery\nFile:Sonning cutting.jpg|Sonning Cutting, close to the scene of the accident, 24 December 1841.
