He joined Carlisle United in 1994 and won two promotions from Division Three and the 1997 Football League Trophy Final during his time at the club before moving to Fulham in 1997. He played a role in Fulham's promotion and run to the 5th round of the FA Cup in 1999. Hayward was signed by Barnsley in January 2001. That season he had made one league appearance for Fulham up to that point, which ironically was against Barnsley. Fulham would go on to get promoted to the Premier League that season in his absence. Hayward scored on his Barnsley debut; a 2–1 defeat at Burnley. Injuries hampered his stay at Barnsley and he retired in 2004.\nHonours\nCarlisle United\n*Football League Third Division: 1995–96; third-place promotion: 1996–97\n*Football League Trophy: 1996–97; runner-up: 1994–95\nFulham\n*Football League First Division: 1998–99\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
