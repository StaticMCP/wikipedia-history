The band originally consisted of Briton Bond (unclean vocals), Cody Quistad (rhythm guitar/clean vocals), Seth Blake (lead guitar), Jordan Pierce (bass) and David Rau (drums). Rau quit the band to focus on teaching and was previously residing as a teacher at West Port High School in the band's hometown. The band briefly changed their name to War Within before changing it again to Wage War. Since the name change to Wage War, the band hired on Chris Gaylord to replace Pierce and Stephen J. Kluesener to replace Rau. As of October 2019, Rau occasionally fills in for Kluesener. In 2015, the band signed to Fearless Records, with a single produced by Jeremy McKinnon and Andrew Wade. After being signed to Fearless, the band released their debut album, Blueprints.\nDeadweight (2017–2018)\nTheir second album Deadweight was released with Fearless Records on August 4, 2017. Wage War has done a number of tours, including playing on the entirety of the Vans Warped Tour in 2016, and A Day to Remember's Self Help Festival in 2017. The band has also opened for artists such as August Burns Red, Chelsea Grin, I Prevail, The Amity Affliction, Northlane, Every Time I Die, For Today, Of Mice & Men and Disturbed. The band played with Parkway Drive on their mini-June 2017 tour. The band embarked on their first national headliner in the July 2017, in support of their new album Deadweight. Gideon and Varials joined up as support. The second leg of the tour featured Gideon and Varials once again. Oceans Ate Alaska and Loathe joined up as support. Wage War played on the final touring portion of the 2018 Vans Warped Tour.\nPressure (2019–2020)\nOn January 9, 2019, the band released a single titled \"Low\" through their label Fearless Records. Six months later, on July 9, they released a second single, \"Who I Am\". Then later that month, on July 30, the band released two singles, \"Prison\" and \"Me Against Myself\". Upon doing this, the band unveiled their plans for a third studio album, revealing the album's title, tracklist, and release date. Pressure, their third album, was released on August 30, 2019.\nOn March 18, Wage War lost all of their Myspace content from 2016 and earlier in \"a server migration gone wrong\" from the Empires era (with the exception of The Fall of Kings EP). It was widely reported that over 50 million songs and 12 years worth of content was permanently lost, and there was no backup. Wage War played on the 25th Anniversary Vans Warped Tour in Atlantic City, New Jersey and in Mountain View, California. The band went on tour throughout the Fall of 2019, in support of their latest album, Pressure. Like Moths to Flames, Polaris and Dayseeker joined up as support for the tour.

On September 14, the band released the third single \"Teeth\". On November 18, 2022, the band announced an acoustic album called The Stripped Sessions, which was released on December 2, 2022.\nStigma (2024–present)\nOn March 21, 2024, Wage War unveiled the first single titled \"Magnetic\" and its corresponding music video.
