Influential events and milestones years before and after the 1960s are included for context relevant to the subject period of the early 1960s through the mid-1970s.\n1950s\n1951\n* The True Believer: \"Longshoreman-philosopher\" Eric Hoffer's Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements is published.\n* July 16: The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger is published.\n1952\n* August: Mad magazine debuts as a comic book before adopting a standard magazine format in 1955. The publication satirizes both mainstream American culture and, later, counterculture alike.\n* Invisible Man: Ralph Ellison's novel of African-American life in the 20th century is published.\n* Go: John Clellon Holmes' novel is published and is later considered to be the first book depicting the Beat Generation.\n1953\n* April 13: Project MKUltra, the Central Intelligence Agency's behavior control research program that grew to include testing the effects of LSD and extended sensory deprivation on both volunteer and unsuspecting American and Canadian subjects into the 1960s, commences. Secret detention camps in Europe and Asia are also set up for torture and experiments on prisoners.\n* May 4: The \"doors of perception\" open for author Aldous Huxley as he takes mescaline for the first time. Humphrey Osmond guides the trip, and later correspondence between the two produces the term psychedelic.\n* December: Marilyn Monroe centerfold: the first issue of Playboy magazine appears, published by Hugh Hefner.\n1954\n* May 17: Brown vs. Board of Education: The U.S. Supreme Court rules unanimously that the practice of racial segregation in public schools, mostly by Southern states, is unconstitutional. The doctrine of \"Separate but Equal\" as a moral or legal pretext for segregation is decreed no longer enforceable by governments, and the process of true racial integration begins in schools throughout the region, a process that was not completed until about 1970.\n1955\n* February: SEATO: The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is formally activated, nominally obligating the U.S. to intervene as part of a collective action in case of military conflagrations in the region. The non-binding SEATO commitment, however, is not invoked as the justification for involvement in Vietnam by future President Lyndon Baines Johnson (LBJ) until later escalation of hostilities there proves unpopular.\n* July 9: \"Rock Around the Clock\": Pennsylvania country singer Bill Haley's version of the keystone song begins an eight-week run at number 1 on the Billboard charts. With deep roots in black jazz, blues, and R&B, as well as gospel and country music, the rock & roll era begins.\n* August 28: Emmett Till murder: A Black adolescent is brutally slain by White vigilantes in rural Mississippi after allegedly flirting with a White woman. The incident becomes a pivotal event in the growing civil rights movement after Till's mother allows the boy's mutilated body to be viewed in an open-casket funeral, and after two White men (who years later confess to the murder) are acquitted by an all-White, all-male jury, the standard practice for that time in most of the country, and especially the South. In 2017, Till's apparently coerced female accuser recanted key testimony she gave under oath; the woman died in 2023.\n* September 30: James Dean: The star of Rebel without a Cause and early icon of the disaffected generation dies in a sports car crash at age 24 at Cholame, California.\n* October 7: Six Gallery Reading: Beat poet Allen Ginsberg first performs his soon-to-be scandalous Howl.\n* October 26: The Village Voice: One of the earliest and most enduring alternative newspapers is launched by Ed Fancher, Dan Wolf, John Wilcock and Norman Mailer in New York City. The paper ceased publication in 2018, but pledged to digitize its vast archive.\n* December 1: Activist Rosa Parks refuses to cede her seat on a public bus to a White passenger in Montgomery, Alabama (per Southern segregationist mores and codes), and is arrested. A successful bus boycott by local blacks led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., pastor of that city's Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, ensues, while the American Civil Liberties Union takes on and wins Parks' legal case. After over a year of Blacks refusing to ride, the U.S. Supreme Court orders the desegregation of Montgomery's bus system.\n1956\n* April 21: \"Heartbreak Hotel\": Elvis Presley's first number-one hit tops the popular music charts for eight weeks. The Mississippi-born singer who was working as a truck driver in Memphis, Tennessee creates teenage pandemonium in households throughout the U.S. and subsequently across the rest of the western world.\n* August: The FBI's COINTELPRO domestic counterintelligence program commences. The surveillance effort is initially directed against stateside communist activities, but grows to include illegal invasions of privacy targeting civil rights and anti-war activists, particularly black activists.\n1957\n* Masters and Johnson begin scientific research into human sexual response in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Washington University School of Medicine.

Eisenhower signs an executive order sending federal troops to maintain peace and order during the racial integration of Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas. His main antagonist is Arkansas governor Orval Faubus.\n* October 4: The western world is shocked and deeply fearful when the Soviet Union launches Sputnik 1, the first artificial space satellite. The ability to launch a satellite equates to the ability to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile, thereby directly threatening much of the world with long-range missile attack for the first time. Confidence is further shaken in December, when Vanguard, the rushed U.S. attempt to equal Sputnik, explodes on the launchpad.\n* November 15: Albert Schweitzer, Coretta Scott King, and Benjamin Spock place a large advertisement in The New York Times calling for an end to the nuclear arms race.

Guitarist Tommy Allsup \"loses\" his seat after a coin-flip with Valens, and Holly's bass player (and future country music legend) Waylon Jennings also misses the doomed flight when he allows the ill \"Bopper\" to take his seat. In 1972, Don McLean's \"American Pie,\" a commemoration of the incident, is released, and is later called \"the accessible farewell to the Fifties and Sixties.\"\n* How to Speak Hip: Improv pioneers Del Close and John Brent's satirical comedy record is released and formalizes hip parlance for a generation.\n1960s\n1960\n* The Student League for Industrial Democracy changes its name to Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and first meets in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Wallace was running as a Democrat in that primaries for the 1972 race; the Maryland primary was to take place the next day.

He goes on to re-election in Alabama for two more terms, in 1974 and 1982.\n* May 19: A Weather Underground bomb at the Pentagon causes damage but no injuries.\n* May 21–22: Fifteen thousand persons demonstrate in Washington against the War.\n* June 4: Angela Davis is acquitted on all counts in her trial on weapons charges.\n* June 12: John Lennon's Plastic Ono Band releases the politically charged double album Some Time in New York City.\n* June 17: In a second attempt to obtain potentially damaging information on the Democratic Party that might benefit President Nixon's reelection campaign, five men are caught burglarizing the Party headquarters located in the Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C. All are arrested, and, initially, the story receives minimal notice from most national media.\n* June 23: U.S. public schools can no longer require girls to wear dresses or skirts and must permit them to wear pants, by act of the Education Amendments of 1972.

Wade ruling, invalidating numerous state laws against abortion and declaring the procedure a Constitutional right for women, based on a fundamental concern for privacy between consenting adults. Some believe the decision to represent the apex of the Sexual Revolution, and immediately, numerous conservative religious bodies, namely the Roman Catholic Church and, later, fundamentalist Protestants, begin advocacy, both peaceful and violent, for the decision's repeal or else an amendment to the Constitution banning the procedure. Over the next 49 years, the decision stays in effect despite some serious modifications, until June 2023, when a strongly anti-feminist Court overturns the decision in ''Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, a ruling that directly attacks the legal reasoning of Roe.\n* January 28: American combat military involvement in Vietnam ends with a ceasefire and commencement of withdrawal as called for under the Paris Peace Accords.\n* February 27 – May 8: Wounded Knee incident: Native American activists occupy the town of Wounded Knee, South Dakota; two protesters and one Federal Marshal are killed during a lengthy standoff.\n* March: The first military draftees who are not subsequently called to service are selected, unceremoniously ending the Vietnam era of conscription in the US.\n* March 8: Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan, a founding member of the Grateful Dead, dies of a gastrointestinal hemorrhage at age 27 in Corte Madera, California. McKernan was known to have a serious drinking problem.\n* March 29: War Ends: President Nixon announces that the last American combat troops have departed Vietnam, and U.S. POWs have been released.\n* May 17: The Senate Watergate Committee begins televised hearings on the ever-growing Watergate scandal implicating the President for gross abuses of power. The matter is thrust into national attention thanks to tireless reportage by The Washington Post's'' Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, two beat reporters for the paper who happened to get the first \"scoop\" on the June 1972 story. Their leads uncovered trails of involvement in the affair by President Nixon's 1972 campaign arm.\n* July 1: The Drug Enforcement Administration supplants the BNDD.\n* July 10: John Paul Getty III, 16, the grandson of miserly oil billionaire and the world's richest man, Jean Paul Getty, is kidnapped for ransom in Rome.

Two years later, invocation of the law by an overwhelmingly Democratic Congress, would constrain President Gerald Ford from sending military  financial aid and weaponry to South Vietnam in order to save the nation from falling to the North in April 1975.\n* September 19: In one of the most bizarre series of events of the era, celebrated journeyman country rock musician Gram Parsons dies of a morphine overdose after visiting Joshua Tree National Monument; his body is \"stolen\" by well-meaning friends attempting to fulfill Parson's funerary wishes and set afire at Joshua Tree. A film account of the misadventures is released in 2003.\n* September 20: Folk-rock singer-songwriters Jim Croce and Maury Muehleisen are killed along with five others after their chartered tour plane crashes shortly after takeoff in Louisiana. Croce is at the height of his popularity at the time of the fatality, and further songs of his are released posthumously during 1974.\n* September 20: The Battle of the Sexes: In a match heavily hyped by the media and promoted as a sports battle between male and female, tennis champions Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs compete at the Astrodome. King defeats Riggs in three straight sets.\n* October 10: In a matter related to corrupt conduct while serving as Governor of Maryland and unrelated to the Watergate drama, Vice President Spiro Agnew resigns his office in a plea deal to avoid a Federal prison sentence for bribery. Agnew is only the second American Vice President to depart his position before the end of a term; John C. Calhoun was the first, in the 19th century. Reflecting his precarious political position and thus inability to nominate a strongly partisan and conservative Republican replacement due to almost-certain Democratic opposition, President Nixon names Congressman Gerald R. Ford of Michigan, the Minority Leader in the U.S. House of Representatives and someone who worked well with members of both parties, on October 12.\n* October 23: Congress begins to consider articles of impeachment against Nixon in response to the \"Saturday Night Massacre\" several days earlier, where Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox and several underlings are either fired or resign in succession. Cox and his staff had been pressing Nixon strongly to release secretly-made audio recordings made while he and his staff were discussing the implications of the Watergate affair during the Summer of 1972. The episode turns even hard-line Nixon supporters who readily supported him barely a year earlier against him, and public support for the Administration drops drastically, coinciding with a series of domestic and international crises, including the Yom Kippur mideastern war and consequent Oil Shortage of 1973 that would bring the American post-World War II prosperity to an ignoble end.\n* November 14: Greece: Students at Athens Polytechnic strike against the military junta. Tanks roll the 17th and at least 24 die.\n* November 17: At a session with 400 Association Press editors who practically harass him over his alleged attempt to cover up involvement in the Watergate matter, President Nixon defensively proclaims, \"People have got to know whether or not their President is a crook. Well, I'm not a crook. I've earned everything I've got.\"\n1974\n* Saddled by a decade of drug-related legal problems, Timothy Leary reportedly becomes an informant for the FBI.\n* January 3: A Federal judge dismisses charges against 12 members of the Weathermen involved in the October 1969 \"Days of Rage\".\n* February 5: Patty Hearst, an heiress to the Hearst family fortune of San Francisco, is kidnapped by the far-left extremist group the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) and, shockingly to the American public, eventually identifies with them and their aims, possibly after becoming a victim of Stockholm syndrome.\n* March–April: The short-lived fad of \"streaking\" (running in public while naked) reaches its height in the U.S.\n* April 20: Disco music, following the success of The O'Jays' \"Love Train\" and Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes' \"The Love I Lost\" a year earlier, again hits number one on the Billboard charts with the instrumental \"TSOP\", a clear sign that the post-\"sixties counterculture\" era is now at hand. At another end of the musical spectrum, with a following largely among jaded college-educated White youngsters on the coasts, the punk rock subculture traces its genesis to around this time, with groups like Ramones and Television playing the CBGB club in New York City. About two and a half years later, several British acts, most notably the Sex Pistols, attract widespread attention with their rapid-speed music featuring abrasive or even offensive lyrics, a movement that runs until about 1980.\n* May 17: Five SLA members, including their leader, are killed fighting police during a standoff in Los Angeles.\n* Summer: The first issue of High Times, a magazine celebrating cannabis culture, is published.\n* July 29: Singing star \"Mama\" Cass Elliot, 32, dies after a heart attack in the London flat of Harry Nilsson. The Who drummer Keith Moon, also 32, dies from overdosing on an anti-alcoholism drug in the same home in 1978.\n* August 5: Having lost a long battle with the Supreme Court and Federal attorneys to keep from releasing incriminating information that indicates that he directed the CIA to have the FBI refrain from investigating the burglary of the Democratic Party National Headquarters in June 1972, President Nixon is forced to admit his complicity in the matter when the recording disclosing the instruction is released publicly. Almost all his remaining supporters in the U.S. Congress desert him upon the revelation of the new information and demand that he leave office as soon as possible.\n* August 8: Facing imminent impeachment from representatives and certain impeachment from senators, Richard Milhous Nixon announces his resignation as President of the United States, the first (and to date, only) ever to do so, from the White House on television and radio that evening.\n* August 9: Nixon returns to his California home as a private citizen (effected when Secretary of State Henry Kissinger receives his formal letter of resignation at approximately 11:35&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time). Thirty minutes later, in the White House East Room, Gerald Ford is sworn in as president and declares in his inaugural speech that \"our long national nightmare is over.\" Ford is the only person to have occupied the White House without actually running for either that office or that of the Vice Presidency. His last election was to a final term for his U.S. House district in Michigan in 1972, and he had, in years past, set his hopes on becoming Speaker of the House of Representatives should the Republican Party assume control of that chamber in the future. He immediately declares rampant inflation, caused mostly by massive spending occurring during the Johnson years on both social programs and military operations abroad, as the nation's most serious problem.\n* September–December: Police repeatedly quell unrest among White parents, mainly Irish-Americans, as desegregation comes to Boston public high schools. Many begin sending their children to parochial (Catholic) schools instead, or else they move to the area's suburbs, reflecting an increasing trend in much of metropolitan America at the time.\n* September 8: In a decision that political observers retrospectively claim cost him any chance to obtain a full term in his own right in 1976, President Ford fully pardons former Richard Nixon during a surprise Sunday morning televised address, putting a final end to the Watergate saga outside the American judiciary. Charitable speculations abound that Ford wants desperately to deter a re-ignition of recently quelled social conflict in the country, while cynics, on the other hand, postulate that Ford and Nixon worked out a quid pro quo deal. The outrage on the part of many legislators spills over into the confirmation process for Nelson Rockefeller to become Ford's vice president; he is not confirmed and sworn in until a few days before Christmas, due to hypersensitivity over suspected corruption by Rockefeller (by Democrats especially) on certain business dealings.\n* September 16: President Ford offers a conditional amnesty to military deserters and evaders of the Vietnam-era draft, creating a possible path for the re-entry of some into the U.S.\n* December 13: President Ford invites George Harrison to a luncheon at the White House, a sign of the \"Establishment's\" increasing acceptance of the youth culture of recent years. Another British rock star, Peter Frampton, would pay a visit in 1976.\n* December 21: The New York Times reports that the Central Intelligence Agency illegally spied on 10,000 anti-War dissidents during Nixon's presidency. Espionage on American citizens is directly prohibited by the CIA's charter.\n1975\n* January 1: In a special New Year's Day court session, John Mitchell and three other Watergate conspirators are found guilty and sentenced to prison on February 21.\n* January 27: Church Committee: The U.S. Senate votes to begin unprecedented investigation into US intelligence activities, including illegal spying on domestic radicals. Democratic Senator Frank Church of Idaho is the chairman, and he has an overwhelmingly favorable Congress to work with due to the party's strong performance in the November 1974 midterm elections. The freshmen become collectively known as \"Watergate Babies,\" and, along with President Ford, help to move American economic and foreign policy into a more libertarian direction, prizing recently won social freedoms but turning, at least rhetorically, against large-scale governmental spending and aggressive military activity abroad. Eventually, this develops through the presidency of Jimmy Carter and mutates into the neoliberal paradigm that dominates 1980s and 1990s Washington, from Ronald Reagan through George W. Bush.\n* January 29: A Weather Underground bomb explodes at the U.S. State Department, but none were injured. This transpires to be the final significant incident of violence caused by the New Left.\n* April 17: Cambodia Falls:\n* April 30: Operation Frequent Wind: With the North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong openly violating the terms of the 1973 Paris Peace Accords under the realization that the U.S. would not come to the aid of South Vietnam due to overwhelming political opposition in light of Nixon's resignation and the Ford Administration's sharp focus on ridding America of high inflation, Communists begin steamrolling most of the country, which begins early in the year. Most of the populace and leaders in the South opt to abandon the nation to those forces rather than face certain death. Moving progressively southward, soldiers eventually reach Saigon by late April. President Ford orders help for the last remaining U.S. military and intelligence personnel to escape Saigon, in time before tanks approach the presidential palace and the South Vietnamese government surrenders, putting an end to a 21-year effort by the. Viet Minh to reunite the people under a Communist regime.\n* September 5: Political Assassinations Briefly Return to Fashion: President Ford survives an assassination attempt by a devoteé of convicted murderer and cult leader Charles Manson, Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme, who seeks to draw attention to both his plight and her belief that American environmental policy did not sufficiently control industrial pollution. The incident occurs near a gathering of Republican businessmen in the California state capital of Sacramento; the industrialists are a target of Fromme's ire. Despite Fromme coming within inches of the President as he walks through downtown Sacramento greeting well-wishers along the way, her firearm fails on her, and she is immediately subdued and arrested by the Secret Service. She is convicted two months later and stays in prison until 2009.\n* September 18: Patty Hearst is arrested by the FBI.\n* September 22: Seventeen days after the botched Fromme attempt on President Ford's life, another California woman, Sara Jane Moore, makes an attempt in San Francisco.\n* October 7: A New York State Supreme Court judge reverses the deportation order against John Lennon, allowing Lennon to legally remain in the U.S. Lennon would never again perform publicly. Yoko Ono did not perform publicly until after Lennon's death.\n* October 11: Saturday Night Live: The counterculture comes of age as George Carlin hosts the first episode of the mainstream television revue, conceived as an experimental program to replace reruns of Johnny Carson's Tonight Show, which the talk show host demanded as a condition of renewing his contract with NBC. The series, still running as of 2023 after 48 seasons, soon features many notable American television firsts, including things like an open depiction of marijuana use in comedy sketches.\n1977\n* January 21: Newly inaugurated US President Jimmy Carter unconditionally pardons thousands of Vietnam draft evaders, allowing them to re-enter the US, mostly from Canada.\n* August 16: Elvis Presley, the most significant progenitor of the rock era, early critic of the counterculture, and biggest selling individual recording artist of all time dies at age 42 from complications of prescription drug abuse in Memphis, Tennessee.\n1980s\n1980\n* December 8: John Lennon, 40, founding member of the Beatles and standard-bearer of the counterculture generation, is murdered in New York, triggering an outpouring of grief around the world.\nSee also\n* Counterculture of the 1960s\n* Opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War: Timeline\n**List of protests against the Vietnam War\n* Timeline of the civil rights movement\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140308030647/http://www.sixtiespix.com/subhomepage.html 1960s archive with photographs of be-ins and protests]\n* [https://www.pbs.org/opb/thesixties/timeline/timeline_flash.html The 1960s: Years that Shaped a Generation]"
