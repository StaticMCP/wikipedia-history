It was named after the old Sardinia Street that was demolished during the construction of Kingsway in 1905.\nBuildings\n.]]\nThe north side of Sardinia street is wholly taken up by the New Academic Building of the London School of Economics (LSE), formerly the Public Trustee Office. In 2009, a sculpture by Richard Wilson was installed on its corner with Kingsway. The K2 telephone kiosk on that corner is grade II listed with Historic England.\nThe south side includes an office building, Sardinia House (c.1910) of the LSE, and a King's College London building that fronts Kingsway.\nReferences\nExternal links"
