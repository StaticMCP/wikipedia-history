The prize was established by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology to achieve the world's best research results by providing research funds of 1.5 billion KRW per year to a total of 10 scientists. Research prize funding ended when their affiliation changed. Envisioned as the highest scientific award of the nation, it was initially presented to Hwang Woo-suk in 2005 under the name Top Scientist (최고과학자) with an annual funding prize of 3 billion KRW given over three years. Due to his scandal, the award was withdrawn from Hwang, the name of the prize was changed and the research funding was reduced. The reformed award was given in 2006, 2007, 2010 and last bestowed in 2012. The end of the award coincided with the founding of the Institute for Basic Science with five laureates changing their affiliation to the new institute.\nLaureates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
