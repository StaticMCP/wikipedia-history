He was on the books for a thirteenth year without playing before signing provisionally with Queens Park Rangers in England on a free transfer, aged 33; however, the outbreak of World War II meant he never made a competitive appearance for the West London club. He served in the Royal Air Force during the conflict.\nCalderwood played in the 1930 Scottish Cup Final which Partick Thistle lost to Rangers after a replay, but did manage to claim winner's medals in the Glasgow Merchants Charity Cup in 1927 and 1935, and the Glasgow Cup in 1934. It is also recorded that he received a medal from the one-off Glasgow Dental Hospital Cup in 1928 (this was sold at auction in 2011); he did not take part in the final itself but did play in the semi-final. He was selected for one edition of the Glasgow Football Association's annual challenge match against Sheffield but received no further representative honours.\nReferences"
