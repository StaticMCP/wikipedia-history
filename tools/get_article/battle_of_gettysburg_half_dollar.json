It commemorated the upcoming 1938 75th anniversary of the 1863 Battle of Gettysburg.\nDescription\nTwo United States Civil War veterans, one from the Union camp and one from the Confederate camp, are featured on the obverse of the coin. E pluribus unum (\"Out of Many, One\"), the de facto United States national motto until 1956, is displayed prominently above the two war veterans, with the \"E\" serving as both the first letter of the motto and the middle letter of Liberty.\nThe Battle of Gettysburg\nThe Battle of Gettysburg was fought July 1–3, 1863, in and around the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, by Union and Confederate forces during the American Civil War. The battle involved the largest number of casualties of the entire war and is often described as the war's turning point. Union Maj. Gen. George Meade's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, halting Lee's invasion of the North.  The battle took place over three days and took the lives of 23,000–28,000 (estimated)Busey and Martin, p. 260, cite 23,231 total (4,708 killed;12,693 wounded;5,830 captured/missing).\nSee the section on casualties for a discussion of alternative Confederate casualty estimates, which have been cited as high as 28,000. Confederates and 23,049 Union soldiers\nSee also\n* List of United States commemorative coins and medals (1930s)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
