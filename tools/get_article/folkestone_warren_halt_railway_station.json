The Halt enjoyed, however, a brief existence, closing after the Summer in the face of threats by Lord Radnor who felt that his land was being trespassed upon. There is also a suggestion that the station had not been formally authorised by the Board of Trade which, upon discovering its existence, refused to grant consent.\n1908 reopening\nWarren Halt was reopened 22 years later by the South Eastern and Chatham Railway and remained open until the evening of 19 December 1915 when a large landslip resulted in the entire undercliff supporting the Main Line moving towards the sea causing approximately 1.5 million cubic metres of chalk to slip or fall burying Warren Halt. The railway watchman was able to stop the 6.10pm Ashford to Dover service as it emerged from Martello Tunnel, hauled by D class, no. 493.\nThe station as well as the affected section of the South Eastern Main Line remained closed until 1919. The Warren was a popular picnic spot in Edwardian times and a nearby tea chalet served hundreds of visitors daily.\nIn 1923 the Halt was rebuilt by the Southern Railway which added a set of platforms. The station remained open for a further 16 years before another landslip in 1939. The Halt was, however, kept open as a staff facility until 1971 and a nearby siding subsequently served early Channel Tunnel works.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.bgs.ac.uk/science/landuseanddevelopment/landslides/FolkestoneWarren.html The Folkestone Warren Landslide] British Geological Survey\n*[https://www.networkrail.co.uk/the-great-fall-historic-landslip-images-resurface/ Historic Landslip images] Network Rail"
