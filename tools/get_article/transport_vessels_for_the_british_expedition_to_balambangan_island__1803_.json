      "text": "# Transport vessels for the British expedition to Balambangan Island (1803)\n\nIn 1803, in response to the restitution of the Moluccas to the Dutch as per the Treaty of Amiens of 1802, Lord Wellesley, Governor-General of India, decided upon the resettlement of Balambangan Island, and instructed R. J. Farquhar, the British Resident at Amboina for the British East India Company (EIC), to manage the expedition.\nFarquhar reestablished the settlement at Balambangan by the end of September 1803. The resumption of war with France led the EIC to abandon the island in 1805.\n, under the command of Captain W. J. Hamilton, a 24-gun sloop-of-war of the Bombay Marine, the EIC's naval arm, was the sole warship of the expedition.\n{| class=\" wikitable\"\n|-\n! Vessel\n! Master\n!
