The first edition of the Talía Awards took place at the Teatro Español in March 2023. The trophy, a representation of Thalia, goddess of comedy, was designed by José Luis Puche. The first edition was criticised for claims of Madrid-centric bias. While the awards were due to hold their first three editions in Madrid in order to \"settle down\", academy president Cayetana Guillén Cuervo claimed that if the awards were \"perceived to have become too centralized, we will take that into account next year\", explaining that \"decentralization\" was one of the academy's goals. The second edition was again held at the Teatro Español on 22 April 2024.\nReferences"
