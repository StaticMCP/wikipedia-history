The notable moments in the people's war were:\n*the Five Days of Milan, chronologically the first notable action that led to the Austrians' exit from Milan, which was thus brought about solely by a spontaneous revolt by the city's inhabitants.\n*the Repubblica di San Marco, which governed Venice from 17 March 1848 to 22 August 1849 and only fell after a hard-fought siege.\n*the Ten Days of Brescia, in which Brescia's inhabitants responded to Austrian repression by resisting their troops from 23 March (the day of Piedmont's defeat at Novara) to 1 April 1849.\n*the Roman Republic from 24 November 1848 (the flight of pope Pius IX) to 3 July 1849.\nThe royal war was the campaign by the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, including the battles of Goito, Peschiera del Garda, Custoza and Novara.\nSecond Italian Independence War\nThe Second Independence War was a typical example of royal war led by Victor Emmanuel II, allied to Napoleon III in conducting a war against Austria. The people's war was only a minor support Hunters of the Alps, a corps of volunteers commanded by Giuseppe Garibaldi and considered as a special unit within the royal army.\nExpedition of the Thousand\nThe Expedition of the Thousand was entirely a people's war, with Garibaldi being its central figure.\nThird Italian Independence War\nIn the Third Independence War, with the Italian defeats at Custoza and Lissa, was essentially a royal war, though the corps of volunteers under Garibaldi did win a victory at Bezzecca.\nAnalogy with the Resistance\nThe same contrast between royal war and people's war can be applied to the history of the Second World War, when a disastrous war under the royal and fascist régime was followed by the people's war of the Italian Resistance.\nNotes\nBibliography\n*A.
