BBMP is an administrative body responsible for civic amenities and some infrastructural assets of the Greater Bangalore metropolitan area in the Indian state of Karnataka. The ward is named after Chowdeshwari Layout near Yelahanka.\nHistory\nThe history of municipal governance of Bangalore dates back to 27 March 1862, when nine leading citizens of the old city formed a Municipal Board under the Improvement of Towns Act of 1850. A similar Municipal Board was also formed in the newer Cantonment area. The two boards were legalized in 1881 and functioned as two independent bodies called the Bangalore City Municipality and the Bangalore Civil and Military Station Municipality (Cantonment). The following year, half of the municipal councillors were permitted to be elected, property tax was introduced, and greater powers were given over to the police and local improvement.\nIn 1913, an honorary president was introduced, and seven years later it was made an elected position. An appointed Municipal Commissioner was introduced in 1926 on the Cantonment board as the executive authority.\nAfter Indian independence, the two Municipal Boards were merged, creating the Corporation of the City of Bangalore in 1949, under the Bangalore City Corporation Act. The corporation consisted of 70 elected representatives and 50 electoral divisions with an office of the Mayor. The first elections were held in 1950.\nThe name of the council changed&nbsp;— first to Bangalore City Corporation (BCC) and then to Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BMP) in the year 1989. In 1989, the BMP expanded to include 87 wards and further increased to 100 wards in 1995, covering an extra area of 75 km2. The council also included 40 additional members drawn from the parliament and the state legislature. BMP was the administering body of Bangalore until 2006.\nOn 6 November 2006, the BMP Council was dissolved by the State Government upon the completion of its five-year term. In January 2007, the Karnataka Government issued a notification to merge the areas under the BMP with seven City Municipal Councils (CMC)—Rajarajeshwari City Municipal Council, Dasarahalli City Municipal Council, Bommanahalli City Municipal Council, Krishnarajapuram City Municipal Council, Mahadevapura City Municipal Council, Byatarayanapura City Municipal Council, and Yelahanka City Municipal Council; one Town Municipal Council (TMC)—Kengeri Town Municipal Council—and 110 villages around the city to form a single administrative body, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike. The process was completed by April 2007.\nThe first elections to the newly created BBMP body were held on 28 March 2010, after the delays due to the delimitation of wards and finalizing voter lists. The second elections were held on 22 August 2015 with the Bharatiya Janata Party winning the majority with 101 Corporators, followed by 76 won by the Indian National Congress, 14 by the Janata Dal-S, and 7 by Independents.\nSalient features (2009 delimitation)\n! style=\"white-space:nowrap; width:28%;\" | Identification\n!
