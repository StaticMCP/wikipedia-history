Many of these customs remain integral to marriage in Greece today. While practices vary slightly by region, most traditional weddings in Greece share a core set of symbolic elements rooted in faith, family, and festivity.\nCeremony\nThe Greek Orthodox marriage ceremony consists of two main parts: the Betrothal and the Crowning. These sacred rituals remain largely unchanged for centuries.\n* The Betrothal (Rings Blessing & Exchange): The priest blesses the rings, and the Koumbaros (best man) or Koumbara (maid of honor) exchanges them between the bride and groom three times, symbolizing the commitment and unity of marriage.\n* The Crowning (Stefana): Wreaths joined by a ribbon are placed on the couple’s heads, symbolizing the union of two individuals into one marriage, and honoring them as king and queen of their new household.\n* The Common Cup & Dance of Isaiah: The couple drinks wine from a shared cup, denoting their mutual journey through life. They are then led by the priest in a ceremonial walk around the altar, known as the Dance of Isaiah.\nRoles of Koumbaros and Koumbara\nThe Koumbaros (best man) or Koumbara (maid of honor) plays a significant spiritual and ceremonial role in a Greek Orthodox wedding. They are responsible for exchanging the rings and stefana during the service and are considered lifelong sponsors of the marriage.\nPre-Wedding Traditions\nTraditional customs still observed in many parts of Greece include:\n* Making the bridal bed: Family and friends gather to prepare the couple’s marital bed, often placing money, rice, and a baby for fertility and prosperity.\n* Writing names on the bride’s shoes: Single women write their names on the soles of the bride’s shoes; the names worn off by the end of the night are said to be the next to marry.\nMusic and Celebration\nGreek weddings are well known for their music, food, and dance. Live bands or DJs often accompany traditional Greek dances like the kalamatianos or tsamiko. A feast follows the ceremony, sometimes continuing into the early hours.\nCoins, sugared almonds (koufeta), and a lavish cake are typical wedding symbols representing prosperity, purity, and a sweet life together.\nModern Adaptations\nWhile Orthodox rituals remain at the heart of many weddings in Greece, destination weddings, civil ceremonies, and smaller-scale celebrations have become increasingly common, particularly among younger couples and those marrying abroad.\nReferences"
