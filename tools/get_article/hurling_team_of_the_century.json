The players on the team were nominated by Sunday Independent readers and were selected by a panel of experts and former players.\nA team was also selected of players who had never won an All Ireland.\n__NOTOC__\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 92.5%;\"\n|- style=\"white-space: nowrap;\"\n!Position\n!Player\n!County team\n!Club team(s)\n!Team number\n!All-Ireland SHC, NHL,All-Stars and other awards\n|-\n|Goalkeeper\n|Tony Reddin\n|Tipperary(1947–1957)\n|Mullagh (Galway)Lorrha (Tipperary)\n|1\n|All-Ireland SHC (1949, 1950, 1951)Munster SHC (1949, 1950, 1951)National Hurling League (1949, 1950, 1952, 1954)\n|-\n|Right corner-back\n|Bobby Rackard\n|Wexford(1945–1957)\n|Rathnure\n|2\n|All-Ireland SHC (1955, 1956)Leinster SHC (1951, 1954, 1955, 1956)National Hurling League (1956)\n|-\n|Full-back\n|'''Nick O'Donnell'''\n|Wexford(1951–1960)\n|Éire Óg (Kilkenny)St. Aidan's (Wexford)\n|3\n|All-Ireland SHC (1955, 1956, 1960)Leinster SHC (1951, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1960, 1962)National Hurling League (1956, 1958)Texaco Hurler of the Year (1960)\n|-\n|Left corner-back\n|John Doyle\n|Tipperary(1949–1967)\n|Holycross-Ballycahill\n|4\n|All-Ireland SHC (1949, 1950, 1951, 1958, 1961, 1962, 1964, 1965)Munster SHC (1949, 1950, 1951, 1958, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1964, 1965, 1967)National Hurling League (1950, 1952, 1954, 1955, 1957, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1964, 1965)Texaco Hurler of the Year (1964)Cú Chulainn Awards (1963, 1964)\n|-\n|Right wing-back\n|Jimmy Finn\n|Tipperary(1950–1959)\n|Borris-Ileigh\n|5\n|All-Ireland SHC (1950, 1951, 1958)Munster SHC (1949, 1950, 1951, 1958)National Hurling League (1950, 1952, 1954, 1955, 1957, 1959)\n|-\n|Centre-back\n|John Keane\n|Waterford(1935–1951)\n|Mount Sion\n|6\n|All-Ireland SHC (1948)Munster SHC (1938,1948)\n|-\n|Left wing-back\n|Paddy Phelan\n|Kilkenny(1931–1940)\n|Tullaroan\n|7\n|All-Ireland SHC (1932, 1933, 1935, 1939)Leinster SHC (1931, 1932, 1933, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1939, 1940)National Hurling League (1933)\n|-\n|Midfield\n|Lory Meagher\n| Kilkenny(1924–1935)\n|Tullaroan\n|8\n|All-Ireland SHC (1932, 1933, 1935)Leinster SHC (1925, 1926, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1935)National Hurling League (1933)\n|-\n|Midfield\n|Jack Lynch\n|Cork(1936–1950)\n|Glen Rovers\n|9\n|All-Ireland SHC (1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1946)Munster SHC (1939, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1946, 1947)National Hurling League (1940, 1941, 1948)GAA All-Time All Star Award (1981)\n|-\n|Right wing-forward\n|Christy Ring\n|Cork(1940–1962)\n|Glen Rovers\n|10\n|All-Ireland SHC (1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1946, 1952, 1953, 1954)Munster SHC (1942, 1943, 1944, 1946, 1947, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1956)National Hurling League (1940, 1941, 1953)Texaco Hurler of the Year (1959)\n|-\n|Centre-forward\n|Mick Mackey\n|Limerick(1930–1946)\n|Ahane\n|11\n|All-Ireland SHC (1934, 1936, 1940)Munster SHC (1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1940)National Hurling League (1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938)GAA All-Time All Star Award (1980)\n|-\n|Left wing-forward\n|Jim Langton\n|Kilkenny(1939–1950)\n|Éire Óg\n|12\n|All-Ireland SHC (1939, 1947)Leinster SHC (1939, 1940, 1943, 1945, 1946, 1947, 1950)GAA All-Time All Star Award (1984)\n|-\n|Right corner-forward\n|Jimmy Doyle\n|Tipperary(1957–1973)\n|Thurles Sarsfields\n|13\n|All-Ireland SHC (1958, 1961, 1962, 1964, 1965, 1971)Munster SHC (1958, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1964, 1965, 1967, 1968, 1971)National Hurling League (1957, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1964, 1965)Texaco Hurler of the Year (1965)Cú Chulainn Awards (1963, 1964, 1965)\n|-\n|Full-forward\n|Nicky Rackard\n|Wexford(1940–1956)\n|Rathnure\n|14\n|All-Ireland SHC (1955, 1956)Leinster SHC (1951, 1954, 1955, 1956)National Hurling League (1956)\n|-\n|Left corner-forward\n|Eddie Keher\n|Kilkenny(1959–1977)\n|Rower-Inistioge\n|15\n|All-Ireland SHC (1963, 1967, 1969, 1972, 1974, 1975)Leinster SHC (1963, 1964, 1966, 1967, 1969, 1971, 1972, 1974, 1975)National Hurling League (1962, 1976)Texaco Hurler of the Year (1972)Cú Chulainn Awards (1963, 1966, 1967, 1969)All-Star Awards (1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975)\n|}\nReferences"
