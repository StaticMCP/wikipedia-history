The French first entered Indiana c. 1670. The region was part of New France from 1679&ndash;1763, ruled by Great Britain from 1763&ndash;1783, and part of the United States of America 1783&ndash;present.\nThere have been several wars that have directly affected the region, including Beaver Wars (c 1590&ndash;1701), Queen Anne's War (1702&ndash;1713), King George's War (1744&ndash;1748), French and Indian War (1754&ndash;1763), American Revolutionary War (1775&ndash;1783), Northwest Indian War (1785&ndash;1795), Tecumseh's War (1811&ndash;1812), War of 1812 (1812&ndash;1814), and the American Civil War (1861&ndash;1865). Later wars, including World War I and World War II led to the death of tens of thousands of Hoosiers overseas, but the American Civil War was the last war in which an actual battle occurred within Indiana.\nBattles\nImage:Attack on Fort Sackville.jpg|Siege of Fort Sackville February 20 – 25, 1779.\nImage:Treaty of Greenville.jpg|Signing of the Treaty of Greenville, August 3, 1795.\nFile:Battle of Tippecanoe LCCN2003656861.jpg|Battle of Tippecanoe, November 7, 1811\nImage:Zachary Taylor - Fort Harrison.jpg|Siege of Fort Harrison, September 4, 1812.\nImage:Corydon_Battlefield_entrance.jpg|Battle of Corydon, July 9, 1863\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Name!!Date!!Location!!War!!Campaign!!Dead!!Belligerents\n|-\n|Counter attack on Iroquois\n|1684\n|near modern South Bend\n|Beaver Wars\n|\n|100+\n|Miami & allies vs Iroquois\n|-\n|Destruction of Fort Miami\n|1747\n|Fort Miami\n|King George's War\n|\n|\n|Huron vs France\n|-\n|Attack on Fort Miami\n|1752\n|Fort Miami\n|French and Indian War\n|\n|2\n|British allied Indians vs France\n|-\n|Capture of Fort Miami\n|May 27, 1763\n|Fort Miami\n|\n|Pontiac's Rebellion\n|10\n|Kingdom of Great Britain vs American Indians\n|-\n|Capture of Fort Ouiatenon\n|June 1, 1763\n|modern Lafayette\n|\n|Pontiac's Rebellion\n|0\n|Kingdom of Great Britain vs American Indians\n|-\n|Siege of Fort Sackville\n|February 20 – 25, 1779\n|Vincennes\n|American Revolutionary War\n|Illinois Campaign\n|4\n|United States of America vs Kingdom of Great Britain\n|-\n|Battle of the White River Forks\n|1779\n|Lechauwitank\n|\n|\n|unknown - village destroyed\n|Vincennes Militia vs Delaware village\n|-\n|Petit fort\n|5 December 1780\n|Indiana Dunes\n|American Revolutionary War\n|\n|4\n|United States vs Kingdom of Great Britain and American Indians\n|-\n|de LaBalme Massacre\n|November 5, 1780\n|Near the Eel River in Whitley County\n|American Revolutionary War\n|\n|25+\n|Continental Army vs American Indians\n|-\n|Lochry's Defeat\n|August 24, 1781\n|Near Aurora\n|American Revolutionary War\n|Illinois Campaign\n|37\n|United States of America vs American Indians\n|-\n|Battle of the Embarras River\n|1786\n|Piankeshaw Village, Knox County\n|\n|\n|7\n|Vincennes militia vs Piankeshaw\n|-\n|Hardin's Defeat\n|October 19, 1790\n|North of Fort Miami\n|Northwest Indian War\n|Harmar Expedition\n|22+\n|United States of America vs Western Indian Confederacy\n|-\n|Harmar's Defeat\n|October 21, 1790\n|Fort Miami\n|Northwest Indian War\n|Harmar Expedition\n|249+\n|United States of America vs Western Indian Confederacy\n|-\n|Battle of Big Pine Creek\n|1791\n|Big Pine Creek\n|Northwest Indian War\n|\n|\n|United States of America vs Kickapoo\n|-\n|Blackberry Campaign\n|May 1791\n|Ouiatenon\n|Northwest Indian War\n|\n|38\n|United States of America vs Western Indian Confederacy\n|-\n|Battle of Kenapacomaqua\n|August 7, 1791\n|Near Logansport\n|Northwest Indian War\n|\n|11\n|United States of America vs Western Indian Confederacy\n|-\n|Battle of Tippecanoe\n|November 7, 1811\n|Near Battle Ground\n|Tecumseh's War\n|\n|223+\n|United States of America vs Tecumseh's confederacy\n|-\n|Pigeon Roost Massacre\n|September 3, 1812\n|Underwood\n|War of 1812\n|\n|19\n|Shawnee vs white settlers\n|-\n|Siege of Fort Harrison\n|September 4 – 5, 1812\n|Terre Haute\n|War of 1812\n|\n|3+\n|United States of America vs Tecumseh's confederacy\n|-\n|Siege of Fort Wayne\n|September 5 – 12, 1812\n|Fort Wayne\n|War of 1812\n|Detroit Frontier\n|unknown\n|United States of America vs Kingdom of Great Britain\n|-\n|Battle at Eel River\n|September 19, 1812\n|Near Churubusco\n|War of 1812\n|Detroit Frontier\n|25+\n|United States of America vs Tecumseh's confederacy\n|-\n|Spur's Defeat\n|November 22, 1812\n|Wildcat Creek, near Lafayette\n|War of 1812\n|\n|18\n|Shawnee vs United States of America\n|-\n|Battle of the Mississinewa\n|December 17–18, 1812\n|Near Jalapa\n|War of 1812\n|Detroit Frontier\n|102+\n|United States of America vs Tecumseh's confederacy\n|-\n|Battle of Tipton's Island\n|April 1813\n|White River\n|War of 1812\n|Detroit Frontier\n|7\n|Indiana Rangers vs Kickapoo\n|-\n|Attack at Fort Wayne\n|July 7, 1813\n|Fort Wayne\n|War of 1812\n|Detroit Frontier\n|3\n|United States of America vs Native Americans\n|-\n|Newburgh Raid\n|July 16, 1862\n|Newburgh\n|American Civil War\n|\n|0\n|Confederate States of America vs United States of America\n|-\n|Hines' Raid\n|June 18, 1863\n|Orange & Crawford counties\n|American Civil War\n|Morgan's Raid\n|3\n|Confederate States of America vs United States of America and Indiana Legion\n|-\n|Battle of Brandenburg Crossing\n|July 7, 1863\n|East of Mauckport\n|American Civil War\n|Morgan's Raid\n|2\n|Confederate States of America vs Indiana Legion\n|-\n|Battle of Corydon\n|July 9, 1863\n|Corydon\n|American Civil War\n|Morgan's Raid\n|15\n|Confederate States of America vs Indiana Legion\n|}\nNotes\nSee also\n*History of Indiana\n*Indiana in the American Civil War"
