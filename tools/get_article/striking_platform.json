      "text": "# Striking platform\n\nIn the archaeological study of lithic reduction, the striking platform is the surface on the proximal portion of a lithic flake on which the detachment blow falls; this may be natural or prepared. Types of striking platforms include:\n* Cortex, which consists of an area of cortex used as a platform during initial reduction;\n* Single-faceted, consisting of a flat platform at right angles to the dorsal surface of the flake and most often associated with conchoidal fractures;\n* Double-faceted, a variety of multifaceted, prepared platform, also characteristically flat and associated with conchoidal fractures;\n* Multifaceted, with three or more facets to the platform;\n* Lipped, a platform type resulting from soft hammer biface reduction; and\n* Crushed, which occurs when the platform was crushed beyond easy recognition by the detachment blow.\nNotes"
