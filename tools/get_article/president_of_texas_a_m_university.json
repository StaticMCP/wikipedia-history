This follows the resignation of Mark A. .Walsh. Williams is a former member of the Texas State Legislature and a member of the Texas A&M Graduating Class of 1978.\n__TOC__\nEarly history\nOn October 4, 1876, on the recommendation of former Confederate president Jefferson Davis after he had declined the position, Thomas Sanford Gathright became the first president of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas (the future Texas A&M University). At the inauguration of the college, Gathright stated to those assembledTo the full success of the college, I can promise the best efforts of my colleagues in the faculty, as I pledge my own.\nThey may not be the proper men to work out success, and may be called to give place to others. I may not be suited to my place, and may retire; still this great work, in which all the people of this good state are interested, must go on and must succeed.\nPresidents\nThe list of Texas A&M University presidents includes the previous presidents, and Chairmen of the Faculty of the Agricultural & Mechanical College of Texas. It also includes those that served in an acting or interim capacity.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Portrait\n! scope=\"col\" | President\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Start of term\n! scope=\"col\" | End of term\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"row\" | Thomas Sanford Gathright\n| President\n| July 15, 1876\n| November 21, 1879\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"row\" | John Garland James\n| President\n| November 22, 1879\n| April 1, 1883\n|-\n| rowspan=2|\n! scope=\"rowgroup\" rowspan=2| James Reid Cole\n| Acting President\n| April 1, 1883\n| June 26, 1883\n|-\n| President\n| June 26, 1883\n| July 19, 1883\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"row\" | Hardaway Hunt Dinwiddie\n| Chairman of the Faculty\n| July 23, 1883\n| December 11, 1887\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"row\" | Louis Lowry McInnis\n| Chairman of the Faculty\n| January 24, 1888\n| July 1, 1890\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"row\" | William Stuart Lorraine Bringhurst\n| Acting President\n| July 1, 1890\n| January 20, 1891\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"row\" | Lawrence Sullivan Ross\n| President\n| January 20, 1891\n| January 3, 1898\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"row\" | Roger Haddock Whitlock\n| Acting President\n| January 3, 1898\n| July 1, 1898\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"row\" | Lafayette Lumpkin Foster\n| President\n| July 1, 1898\n| December 2, 1901\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"row\" | Roger Haddock Whitlock\n| Acting President\n| December 10, 1901\n| July 1, 1902\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"row\" | David Franklin Houston\n| President\n| July 1, 1902\n| September 1, 1905\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"row\" | Henry Hill Harrington\n| President\n| September 8, 1905\n| August 7, 1908\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"row\" | Robert Teague Milner\n| President\n| September 1, 1908\n| October 1, 1913\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"row\" | Charles Puryear\n| Acting President\n| September 1, 1913\n| August 24, 1914\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"row\" | William Bennett Bizzell\n| President\n| August 25, 1914\n| September 1, 1925\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"row\" | Thomas Otto Walton\n| President\n| September 3, 1925\n| August 7, 1943\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"row\" | Frank Cleveland Bolton\n| Acting President\n| August 9, 1943\n| May 27, 1944\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"row\" | Gibb Gilchrist\n| President\n| May 27, 1944\n| September 1, 1948\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"row\" | Frank Cleveland Bolton\n| President\n| September 1, 1948\n| June 3, 1950\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"row\" | Marion Thomas Harrington\n| Acting President\n| June 3, 1950\n| September 1, 1953\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"row\" | David Hitchens Morgan\n| President\n| September 1, 1953\n| December 21, 1956\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"row\" | David Willard Williams\n| Acting President\n| December 22, 1956\n| September 1, 1957\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"row\" | Marion Thomas Harrington\n| President\n| September 1, 1957\n| July 1, 1959\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"row\" | James Earl Rudder\n| President\n| July 1, 1959\n| March 23, 1970\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"row\" | Alvin Roubal Luedecke\n| Acting President\n| March 30, 1970\n| November 1, 1970\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"row\" | Jack Kenny Williams\n| President\n| November 1, 1970\n| July 31, 1977\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"row\" | Jarvis Ernest Miller\n| President\n| August 1, 1977\n| July 10, 1980\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"row\" | Charles Harold Samson Jr.\n| Acting President\n| July 10, 1980\n| August 31, 1981\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"row\" | Frank Everson Vandiver\n| President\n| September 1, 1981\n| August 31, 1988\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"row\" | William Hodges Mobley\n| President\n| September 1, 1988\n| August 31, 1993\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"row\" | E.
