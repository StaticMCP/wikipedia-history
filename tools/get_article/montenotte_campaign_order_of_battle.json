In subsequent engagements, the French defeated the Austrians, pursued Colli to the west, and forced the Sardinians to withdraw from the First Coalition against France. Actions were fought at Voltri (now a suburb of Genoa) on 10 April, Monte Negino (Legino) on 11 April, Montenotte on 12 April, Millesimo on 13 April, Second Battle of Dego on 14–15 April, Ceva on 16 April, San Michele Mondovi on 19 April, and Mondovì on 21 April.\nAbbreviations used\nMilitary rank\n*GD = General of Division (French army or division commander)\n*GB = General of Brigade (French brigade commander)\n*FZM = Feldzeugmeister (Austrian army or corps commander)\n*FLM = Feldmarschall-Leutnant (Austrian division commander)\n*GM = Generalmajor (Austrian brigade commander)\nOther\n*k = Killed\n*old = The old numbers of the infantry units.
