The structure is an example of Progressivism, popular throughout the United States from the 1890s through the 1920s. Besides constructing this building, Progressivism was responsible for constructing hard-surfaced streets, street lighting, and installing sanitary and storm sewers in Hawarden.  Sioux City architect William L. Steele was responsible for designing the building.  Completed in 1918, it is a two-story brick structure.  The auditorium occupies the main floor and is accessed by an exterior staircase in the front of the building.  City government offices occupied the first floor, with the fire department on the far end.  There are two bays for the fire equipment.  City government remained in this building until 1981 when it moved to the refurbished Chicago & Northwestern Railway Passenger Depot a block to the south. The building has remained empty for the most part since then.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.\nReferences"
