The game is described by the development team as a . The gameplay in Twinkle Crusaders follows a linear plot line, which offers pre-determined scenarios and courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the five female main characters.\nTwinkle Crusaders has also been adapted into four manga adaptations: a four-panel comic strip adaptation was serialized in the bishōjo magazine Dengeki Hime, a second adaptation was serialized irregularly in Dengeki Daioh and concluded with four chapters, an adult one-shot manga chapter was published in the adult magazine Megastore, and a fourth adaptation entitled Twinkle Crusaders GoGo! was serialized in Dengeki Daioh.\nPlot\nThe player assumes the role of , the protagonist of Twinkle Crusaders. Shin is the student council president of , a position which he thought came with free meals from the cafeteria, as he has been raised in a poor family and is in need of money. Unfortunately there's no such thing as a free meal.\n;\n:Voiced by: Mitsuki Saiga\n:Main protagonist of the series. He comes from a poor family but became the student council president of Ryuusei Academy through sheer dumb luck, out of a sole desire for free food (which ended up not coming true). As it turns out, one of the jobs of the council is to fight off demons, or Mazoku. This is particularly troublesome for Shin, since his father is the previous maou (demon lord), and he himself is to be his successor. He later goes on to take on his role, but still continues to fight for good.\n:In battle Shin uses the dark element, and has two forms. His first form is prior to his ascendance to maou, and his title is Vicious Lancer. In this form, he has average stats all-around except \"Potential,\" which is maxed out. This leads into his second form as maou, titled Ancient Overlord, where he receives a boost in power, attack speed, and charge speed, as well as changing his hair color white.\n;\n:Voiced by: Keito Mizukiri\n:One of the five heroines, she is Synn's lively childhood friend. Nanaka has a crush on Shin and has been following him around since she was young, enrolling in the same school and joining the student council, where she is the accountant. She likes sweet confectioneries and is the president of the sweets club at school. She holds a grudge against the president of the wagashi (Japanese Sweets) Club Akane Misasagi(御陵彩錦). While the sweets club receives no budget from the school and not even recognized as a proper club, Misasagi's wagashi club have \"wagashi for thought\" and was recognized as a club (though only in name). Her title is Sword Master).\n:In battle, Nanaka has fire-based attacks, and is the powerhouse of the original group. In her first form, her power is on par with Shin's upgraded form, but her own upgraded form increases her power to go even further beyond that. Her speed and charge are average, with her support being below average in her first form, and average in her second. She's not the best in unisons, but in exchange, she can deal substantial damage even if she attacks solo. She's also the main protagonist of the anime series.\n;\n:Voiced by: Motomi Nanaho\n:A first-year student and the student council's secretary. Despite her attempts to hide the fact that she's actually an angel, it is generally known to the other characters, unbeknownst to her. Despite her looks and her voice, she's a real foul-mouth, though without any malicious intent. She is always carrying \"Tontoro,\" a piggy bank filled with 500 yen, and always breaking it. She also carries a guidebook around that seems to have everything in context (although the usages are often wrong). Her family, the Rosenkreuz family, includes some of Ryuusei City's multimillionaires. She commutes by car, and her butler Riesling never leaves her side outside the school ground. Her title is Elemental Muse.\n:In battle she uses water element and her power is not strong; her speed is unpredictable as well with a decent charge, making her support in some battles.\n;\n:Voiced by: Kayo Sakata\n:Twinkle Crusaderss third heroine and the student council's vice-president. Misa thinks of Shin as a rival, and always challenges him despite always ending up in second, falling behind Shin. She is especially annoyed about losing the election, which Shin won by chance. She has her cousin Shion Asuka i(飛鳥井紫苑) (who actually calls her \"姉上(Big Sister)\") as her assistant in some battles.\n;\n:Voiced by: Yuki Sakata\n:The fourth heroine in Twinkle Crusaders, Ria, is a clumsy and soft-spoken third year student. Ria serves as an adviser to the student council due to her past experience as the student council president. She enjoys wagashi and participates in the wagashi club at school. She's also the younger sister of the current chief director Helena (ヘレナ) who was in the current student council's shoes when she was a student. Helana assists Ria is some battles.\n;\n:Voiced by: Rumi Abe\n:Azel is the final heroine in Twinkle Crusaders, a second-year student who transferred into Shin's class in the middle of the story. Azel is very quiet and has a cold attitude towards others. She does not participate in any school activities, and like Shin, comes from a poor family.\n;\n:Voiced by: Akiko Hasegawa\n:Misa's cousin, she is the shrine maiden of the Asukai Shrine and she assists Misa during battles. Like the twinkle crusaders, she too hunts demons due to her role, but she is somewhat reckless while hunting and destroys part of the street while Synn and Misa are passing by.\n;\n:Voiced by: Asami Shimoda\n:Close friend of Nanaka. Nickname “Sacchin”. A very positive personality -- just talking with her will make one feel lazy -- but surprisingly, she has a dark side. She is one of the few members of Sweets Association but often pisses Nanaka off since she likes anything sweet in general, including Japanese treats. Has poor academic grades, but has insights on life. She has a sharp sense on relationships -- when Synn chose other people she will comfort Nanaka.\n;\n:A classmate of Ria and President of the Wagashi club.\nGameplay\nTwinkle Crusaders is a combination of visual novel and turn-based strategy game.
