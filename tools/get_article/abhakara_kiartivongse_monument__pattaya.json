This is due to the fact that Thailand's main naval base, Sattahip, 40 kilometers south of Pattaya, was founded by this admiral in 1922. He is known as the founder and first commander of the Royal Thai Navy.\nOn 20 November, Navy Day in Thailand, and 19 May, the memorial day of Admiral Kiartivongse, ceremonies are held at the monument and military honors are given. Often at the event there are delegations of foreign sailors.\nLocation\nIts location on the high hill, Pratumnak, the highest point of the city offers views of the Gulf of Thailand, Ko Lan, Pattaya Beach and Pratamnak hill, the entire central part of the city.\nThe admiral's sculpture is set on a massive rectangular pedestal lined with black marble surrounded by figures of sailors. The admiral is represented in ceremonial uniform with all the regalia. The height of the composition is more than 15 meters.\nThe construction of the Waterfront Suites and Residence in the early 2010s has blocked the statue's main view of the sea, causing controversy.\nGallery\nFile:Памятник адмиралу Кяртивонгу (Паттайя).jpg|General view of the monument\nFile:Импровизированный нос корабля на смотровой площадке холма Пратамнак.jpg|Improvised prow\nFile:Гюйс ВМС Таиланда на флагштоке на холме Пратамнак.jpg|Huys Thailand Navy on the bow of the ship\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://poolvillacity.co.th/ Pattaya Pool Villas]"
