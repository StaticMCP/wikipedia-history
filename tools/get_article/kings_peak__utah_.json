It lies within the boundaries of the High Uintas Wilderness. The peak is approximately  due east of central Salt Lake City, and  due north of the town of Duchesne.\nThere are three popular routes to the summit; a scramble up the east slope, a hike up the northern ridge, and a long but relatively easy hike up the southern slope. The peak was named for Clarence King, a surveyor in the area and the first director of the United States Geological Survey. The easiest route requires a  round trip hike.\nClimate\n(1991–2020 normals)\n|single line = y\n|Jan high F = 21.6\n|Feb high F = 21.7\n|Mar high F = 27.2\n|Apr high F = 31.4\n|May high F = 39.7\n|Jun high F = 50.6\n|Jul high F = 58.2\n|Aug high F = 56.6\n|Sep high F = 49.2\n|Oct high F = 38.3\n|Nov high F = 27.7\n|Dec high F = 21.3\n|Jan mean F = 11.1\n|Feb mean F = 10.1\n|Mar mean F = 14.9\n|Apr mean F = 19.0\n|May mean F = 27.5\n|Jun mean F = 37.8\n|Jul mean F = 45.3\n|Aug mean F = 43.9\n|Sep mean F = 36.7\n|Oct mean F = 26.7\n|Nov mean F = 17.3\n|Dec mean F = 11.0\n|Jan low F = 0.6\n|Feb low F = -1.4\n|Mar low F = 2.6\n|Apr low F = 6.6\n|May low F = 15.2\n|Jun low F = 25.1\n|Jul low F = 32.4\n|Aug low F = 31.2\n|Sep low F = 24.2\n|Oct low F = 15.1\n|Nov low F = 7.0\n|Dec low F = 0.8\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 3.24\n|Feb precipitation inch = 3.02\n|Mar precipitation inch = 3.16\n|Apr precipitation inch = 3.90\n|May precipitation inch = 4.01\n|Jun precipitation inch = 2.36\n|Jul precipitation inch = 2.79\n|Aug precipitation inch = 3.12\n|Sep precipitation inch = 3.24\n|Oct precipitation inch = 3.37\n|Nov precipitation inch = 3.14\n|Dec precipitation inch = 3.24\n|source=PRISM Climate Group\n}}\nSee also\n}}\n* List of mountain peaks of Utah\n* List of U.S. states and territories by elevation\n* List of Ultras of the United States\n* South Kings Peak\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n}}\n*\n* [http://www.unh.edu/esci/geology-highpoints/utah.html Geology of Kings Peak]"
