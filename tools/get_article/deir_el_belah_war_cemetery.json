After the Armistice of Mudros ended the Ottoman Empire's participation in the First World War, some graves were relocated from nearby to the Deir El Balah War Cemetery. It was used until 1919. In 1998, names of casualties from the Indian Army that were interred at the cemetery were added to the cemetery's register; previously there was a memorial that did not name the casualties.\nAccording to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, which is responsible for maintaining the cemetery, about 10% of the headstones had been damaged as a result of the Gaza war by June 2025. The Hindu, Sikh, and Muslim memorials had also sustained damage. A report by the Centre for Cultural Heritage Preservation noted that the bombing and fire were the main causes of the damage.\nThe cemetery contains 724 graves of Commonwealth soldiers, including an Indian section with 64 burials, and 35 Australians.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://vwma.org.au/explore/cemeteries/103/people Australians buried at Gaza War Cemetery, Virtual War Memorial Australia]\n* [https://gazahistoire.hypotheses.org/39?markerId=017 Cimetière des Anglais de Dayr al-Balaḥ (Deir al-Balah), (Commonwealth War Cemetery, English War cemetery)] (in French), part of the Gaza, inventaire d’un patrimoine bombardé"
