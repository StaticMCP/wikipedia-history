The population was 2,269,675 in the 2020 census, making it the most populous county in Washington, and the 12th-most populous in the United States. The county seat is Seattle, also the state's most populous city.\nOriginally named after US representative, senator, and then vice president-elect William R. King in 1852, the county government amended its designation in 1986 to honor Martin Luther King Jr., a prominent activist and leader during the civil rights movement. The change was approved by the state government in 2005.\nIt is one of three Washington counties that are included in the Seattle metropolitan area along with Snohomish County to the north and Pierce County to the south. About two-thirds of King County's population lives in Seattle's suburbs, which largely developed in the late 20th century and early 21st century as bedroom communities before becoming job centers for the technology industry.\nHistory\nWhen Europeans arrived in the region that would become King County, it was inhabited by several Coast Salish groups. Villages around the site that would become Seattle were primarily populated by the Duwamish people. The Snoqualmie Indian Tribe occupied the area that would become eastern King County. The Green River and White River were home for the Muckleshoot tribal groups. In the first winter after the Denny Party landed at Alki Point, the settlement at the point consisted of a few dozen settlers and over a thousand Native Americans. The local tribes provided the settlers with construction labor, domestic service, and help with subsistence activities.\nOn December 22, 1852, the Oregon Territory legislature formed King County out of territory from within Thurston County. The county was named after Alabamian William R. King, who had just been elected Vice President of the United States under President Franklin Pierce. Seattle was made the county seat on January 11, 1853. The area became part of the Washington Territory when it was created later that year.\nKing County originally extended to the Olympic Peninsula. According to historian Bill Speidel, when peninsular prohibitionists threatened to shut down Seattle's saloons, Doc Maynard engineered a peninsular independence movement; King County lost what is now Kitsap County but preserved its entertainment industry.\nCoal was discovered in 1853 by M. Bigelow along the Black River, and in subsequent decades several companies formed to mine coal around Lake Washington and deliver it to Seattle. The Seattle and Walla Walla Railroad started servicing the Renton coal fields in 1877, and the Newcastle fields in 1878. By 1880, King County produced 22% of the coal mined on the West Coast, most of that coal being found within the Renton Formation's Muldoon coal seam.\nName\nOn February 24, 1986, the King County Council approved a motion to rename the county to honor civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. (no relation to William R. King), preserving the name \"King County\" while changing its namesake. The motion stated, among other reasons for the change, that \"William Rufus DeVane King was a slaveowner\" who \"earned income and maintained his lifestyle by oppressing and exploiting other human beings,\" while Martin Luther King's \"contributions are well-documented and celebrated by millions throughout this nation and the world, and embody the attributes for which the citizens of King County can be proud, and claim as their own.\"\nBecause only the state can charter counties, the change was not made official until April 19, 2005, when Governor Christine Gregoire signed into law Senate Bill 5332, which provided that \"King county is renamed in honor of the Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr.\" effective July 24, 2005.\nThe County Council voted on February 27, 2006, to adopt the proposal sponsored by Councilmember Larry Gossett to change the county's logo from an imperial crown to an image of Martin Luther King Jr. On March 12, 2007, the new logo was unveiled.  The new logo design was developed by the Gable Design Group and the specific image was selected by a committee consisting of King County Executive Ron Sims, Council Chair Larry Gossett, Prosecutor Norm Maleng, Sheriff Sue Rahr, District Court Judge Corrina Harn, and Superior Court Judge Michael Trickey. The same logo is used in the flag.\nMartin Luther King Jr. had visited King County once, for three days in November 1961.\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which  is land and  (8.3%) is water. King County has nearly twice the land area of the state of Rhode Island. The highest point in the county is Mount Daniel at  above sea level.\nKing County borders Snohomish County to the north, Kitsap County to the west, Kittitas County to the east, and Pierce County to the south. It also shares a small border with Chelan County to the northeast. King County includes Vashon Island and Maury Island in Puget Sound.\nThe county has 760 lakes and  of streams and rivers.\nGeographic features\nshown here) dominates the eastern part of King County.]]\nTerrain\n* Cascade Range\n* Issaquah Alps\n* Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest\n* Mount Daniel, the highest point\n* Mount Si\n* Harbor Island\n* Maury Island\n* Mercer Island\n* Sammamish Plateau\n* Vashon Island\nWater\n* Cedar River\n* Green/Duwamish River\n* Elliott Bay\n* Greenwater River\n* Issaquah Creek\n* Lake Sammamish\n* Lake Union\n* Lake Washington\n* Lake Youngs\n* Pratt River\n* Puget Sound\n* Raging River\n* Skykomish River\n* Snoqualmie Falls\n* Snoqualmie River\n* Taylor River\n* Tolt River\n* White River\nNational protected areas\n* Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park (part, also in Skagway, Alaska)\n* Snoqualmie National Forest (part)\nClimate change\nKing County has been identified as vulnerable to higher risks of flooding caused by climate change due to the number of waterways in the area. The county's oceanic ecosystems are predicted to face harmful chemical changes, while the mountainous ecosystems could experience a decrease in ice and snow. Since the mid-2000s, the county government has adopted policies to mitigate the effects of climate change and reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the region.\nTransportation\nMajor highways\n* 20px Interstate 5\n* 20px Interstate 90\n* x20px Interstate 405\n* 20px U.S. Route 2\n* 20px State Route 18\n* 20px State Route 99\n* 20px State Route 167\n* 20px State Route 520\n* 20px State Route 522\nPublic transit\nThe King County Metro serves the county with local routes, paratransit, vanpools, and rideshare in select areas. It also operates an electric trolleybus network in Seattle as well as the city streetcar system. Metro was the seventh-largest transit bus agency in the United States by ridership in 2019, with 121.3&nbsp;million annual passenger trips and 400,000 per weekday. Sound Transit manages Link light rail, Sounder commuter rail, and Sound Transit Express buses in King County that provide connections to adjacent counties. The Community Transit of Snohomish County and the Pierce Transit of Pierce County also operate routes that serve portions of King County. Most transit modes in the county use the ORCA card, a smart fare card system introduced in 2009.\nThe county is home to three major ferry terminals that are served by Washington State Ferries, a state-run passenger and automobile ferry system. Colman Dock in Downtown Seattle is served by routes from Bainbridge Island and Bremerton; Vashon Island is connected to West Seattle at Fauntleroy and also has service to Southworth in Kitsap County. The county government's Marine Division operates the King County Water Taxi, a passenger ferry service that connects Downtown Seattle to West Seattle and Vashon Island. The passenger-only Kitsap Fast Ferries system operated by Kitsap Transit connects a terminal near Colman Dock to communities on the Kitsap Peninsula.1790–1960 1900–19901990–2000 2010–2020\n}}\nThe center of population of the state of Washington in 2010 was located in eastern King County (). King County's own center of population was located on Mercer Island ().\nAs of the fourth quarter of 2021, the median home value in King County was $817,547, an increase of 19.6% from the prior year.\nIn 2021 King County experienced its first population decline in 50 years.\nRacial and ethnic composition since 1960\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n|-\n!

The agency's January 2023 report, based on the point-in-time count system, estimates 14,149 people in the county have experienced homelessness; the King County Regional Homelessness Authority (KCRHA) adopted a different methodology based on the number of people seeking services and estimated that 53,532 people in the county had been homeless at some point in 2022. According to a survey collected by service providers for the county government, 68.5&nbsp;percent of respondents said they last had stable housing in King County and 10.8&nbsp;percent had lived elsewhere in the state. Approximately 57&nbsp;percent of the homeless population counted by HUD in King County was classified as unsheltered, either living in vehicles, encampments in public spaces, or other places. The number of unsheltered individuals increased significantly in the late 2010s, leading to clearing of encampments and other structures by local governments.\nThe county has 5,115 emergency shelter beds and tiny house villages, of which 67&nbsp;percent are in the city of Seattle. According to data from the KCRHA, since late 2022 over 90&nbsp;percent of shelter beds have been occupied on a consistent basis. Additional shelters, parking lots, and encampment sites are operated by charity organizations and churches in the area; during severe weather events such as heat waves and cold snaps, local governments open additional shelter spaces, but these often reach capacity. In 2021, a total of $123&nbsp;million was spent on homelessness services by local governments in King County, including cities and the regional authority. The regional authority's five-year plan, released in 2023, estimates that $8&nbsp;billion in capital costs would be required to build and staff 18,205 new units of temporary and transitional housing to address the homelessness crisis.\nEconomy\nKing County is the state leader in total employment, with Seattle as the major contributor; healthcare is the principal private (non-government) employment sector, with many company headquarters in the area.\n, King County had an unemployment rate of 4.1% without adjustments for seasonal labor.\nBoeing has a significant manufacturing presence in the surrounding area. The 2024 Boeing machinists' strike had a major impact on county employment statistics.\nIn 2023, the average salary in King County was $120,463 (compared to $87,054 in all of Washington); the number of workers in the largest employment sectors of 2023 were:\n* 173,135 in government\n* 160,135 in healthcare and social assistance\n* 154,638 in professional, scientific, and technical services\n* 134,548 in information\n* 107,610 in accommodation and food services\nGovernment\nThe King County Executive heads the county's executive branch; the position has been held by Shannon Braddock since 2025. The King County Prosecuting Attorney (Leesa Manion since 2023), Elections Director, and the King County Assessor are elected executive positions. The King County Sheriff is appointed by the county executive and approved by the county council. It was previously an elected position from 1996 until 2020 and has been held by Patti Cole-Tindall since 2022. Judicial power is vested in the King County Superior Court and the King County District Court. Seattle houses the King County Courthouse.\nThe county government manages elections, records, licensing, parks, wastewater treatment, and public health, among other duties. It also handles the criminal legal and incarceration system for all cities and unincorporated areas within King County. It has a sheriff's department that also provides basic policing to unincorporated areas. The Department of Local Services, established in 2019, serves as the local government for populated unincorporated areas.\nKing County is part of four congressional districts that each elect a member of the United States House of Representatives; the boundaries are redrawn every 10 years based on the results of the decennial census. The 1st district comprises the Eastside cities north of Bellevue; the 7th district includes northern Seattle, West Seattle, Burien, Normandy Park, and Vashon Island; the 8th district includes areas east of Lake Sammamish and the immediate Green River Valley; and the 9th district comprises the southern areas of the county from Federal Way to Seattle, Mercer Island, and part of Bellevue. In the state legislature, the county has 17 districts that each elect two House members and one senator. The majority of state legislators from King County are Democrats; only four House members and two senators are from the Republican Party.\nThe people of King County voted on September 5, 1911, to create a Port District. King County's Port of Seattle was established as the first Port District in Washington State. The Port of Seattle is King County's only Port District. It is governed by five Port Commissioners, who are elected countywide and serve four-year terms. The Port of Seattle owns and operates many properties on behalf of King County's citizens, including Sea-Tac International Airport; many seaport facilities around Elliott Bay, including its original property, publicly owned Fishermen's Terminal, home to the North Pacific fishing fleet and the largest homeport for fishermen in the U.S. West Coast; four container ship terminals; two cruise ship terminals; the largest grain export terminal in the U.S. Pacific Northwest; three public marinas; 22 public parks; and nearly 5,000 acres of industrial lands in the Ballard-Interbay and Lower Duwamish industrial centers.\nCounty council\nThe King County Council was established in 1969 and consists of nine members elected by districts to four-year terms.\n* District 1 – Rod Dembowski\n* District 2 – Girmay Zahilay\n* District 3 – Sarah Perry\n* District 4 – Jorge Barón\n* District 5 – De'Sean Quinn\n* District 6 – Claudia Balducci\n* District 7 – Pete von Reichbauer\n* District 8 – Teresa Mosqueda\n* District 9 – Reagan Dunn\nPolitics\nKing County and Seattle are strongly liberal; the area is a bastion for the Democratic Party. No Republican presidential candidate has carried the county votes since Ronald Reagan's landslide reelection victory in 1984. In the 2008 election, Barack Obama defeated John McCain in the county by 42 percentage points, a larger margin for the Democrats than that seen in any previous election up to that point in time. Slightly more than 29% of Washington state's population reside in King County, making it a significant factor for the Democrats in a few recent close statewide elections. In the 2000 Senate election, King County's margin of victory pushed Maria Cantwell's total over that of incumbent Republican Slade Gorton, defeating and unseating him in the United States Senate. In 2004, King County gave a lead to Democrat Christine Gregoire in her 2004 victory gubernatorial election, pushing her ahead of Republican Dino Rossi, who led by 261 votes after the initial count. Rossi resided in the county at the time of the election, in Sammamish. In the 2020 presidential election, Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump by earning 75% of King County votes. Governor Jay Inslee also defeated Republican challenger Loren Culp with 74% of the King County vote in the concurrent gubernatorial election. These were the largest margins by any candidate in a presidential race and a gubernatorial race since the county's creation.\nIn 2004, voters passed a referendum reducing the size of the County Council from 13 members to 9. This resulted in all council seats ending up on the 2005 ballot.\nSome residents of eastern King County have long desired to secede and form their own county. This movement was most vocal in the mid-1990s (see Cedar County, Washington). It has recently been revived as Cascade County. According to a map published by the Seattle Times, four different geographic borders were considered. Additional plans (see Skykomish County, Washington) also exist or have existed.\n}}\nEducation\nK–12 schools\nSchool districts in the county include:\n* Auburn School District\n* Bellevue School District\n* Enumclaw School District\n* Federal Way Public Schools\n* Fife Public Schools\n* Highline School District\n* Issaquah School District\n* Kent School District\n* Lake Washington School District\n* Mercer Island School District\n* Northshore School District\n* Renton School District\n* Riverview School District\n* Seattle Public Schools\n* Shoreline School District\n* Skykomish School District\n* Snoqualmie Valley School District\n* Tahoma School District\n* Tukwila School District\n* Vashon Island School District\nPublic libraries\nMost of King County is served by the King County Library System, with the exception of Seattle, Hunts Point, and Yarrow Point.
