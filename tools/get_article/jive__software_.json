It was first released as \"Clearspace\" in 2006, then renamed SBS (for \"Social Business Software\") in March 2009, then renamed \"Jive Engage\" in 2011, and renamed simply to \"Jive\" in 2012.\nJive integrates the functionality of online communities, microblogging, social networking, discussion forums, blogs, wikis, and IM under one unified user interface. Content placed into any of the systems (blog, wiki, documentation, etc.) can be found through a common search interface. Other features include RSS capability, email integration, a reputation and reward system for participation, personal user profiles, JAX-WS web service interoperability, and integration with the Spring Framework.\nThe product is a pure-Java server-side web application and will run on any platform where Java (JDK 1.5 or higher) is installed.
