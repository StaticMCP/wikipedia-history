The president is mostly, though not entirely, ceremonial as the actual executive power lies in the president of the Council of Ministers, a powerful role that is the head of the cabinet. The current president is Jean-Lucien Savi de Tové, who took office on 3 May 2025. He is also the oldest president ever in Togolese history.\nFor most of Togo's independence, the country had a presidential system in which the president was not only the head of state, but also the head of government and that the role had much power over both domestic and foreign policy. However, constitutional reforms adopted in April 2024 reduced the president's powers, made the role more ceremonial, and moved the country towards a more parliamentary system.\nWhile the role became ceremonial, the president is still the commander-in-chief of the Togolese Armed Forces and still has the power to appoint the president of the Council of Ministers and the government. The reform also changed the way the president is elected, from being directly elected by citizens to being indirectly elected by Parliament.\nA total of five people have served as president (not counting one acting president and two interim military officeholders). Additionally, one person, Faure Gnassingbé, has served on two non-consecutive occasions: first from the death of his father, Gnassingbé Eyadéma, on 5 February 2005 until his resignation 20 days later on 25 February and the second one from 4 May 2005 until 3 May 2025.\nDescription of the office\nElection\nThe president of the Republic is indirectly elected by an electoral college composed of members of the National Assembly and the Senate for a mandate of four years.\nThe president is re-eligible for a second term as there is a two-term limit for the president in the Constitution of Togo which was reinstated in 2019. This limit has been lifted for Gnassingbé Eyadéma in 2002 and for Faure Gnassingbé in 2019.\nThis college must be convened by the President of the National Assembly within thirty days preceding the end of the outgoing President's term. If the National Assembly is dissolved or if the end of the current legislature is less than three months away, the presidential election shall be convened within forty-five days following the installation of the new legislature. In the event of the permanent incapacity of the incumbent President of the Republic, the meeting of the electors shall be convened no later than forty-five days following the premature end of the outgoing President's term.\nTo be elected, a candidate must be nominated by one of the parliamentary groups in the National Assembly, be of exclusively Togolese nationality by birth, be over 50 years of age at the time of the election, enjoy full civil and political rights, and have resided in the country for more than one year. Finally, they must have been certified by three doctors accredited by the Constitutional Court as being in a general state of physical and mental well-being.\nIn the first two rounds, the candidate who achieves an absolute majority of the total number of members of the electoral college is elected. In the third round, the required majority is lowered to a simple majority.\nOath of office\nBefore he enters into office, the president of the Republic swears before the Constitutional Court meeting in solemn hearing, in these terms:\nVacancy\nIn case of a vacancy of the presidency of the Republic by death, resignation or definitive incapacity, the presidential function is exercised provisionally by the president of the National Assembly.\nThe vacancy is declared by the Constitutional Court referred to [the matter] by the Government.\nThe Government convokes the electoral body within sixty (60) days of the opening of the vacancy for the election of a new president of the Republic.\nResidences\nAfter independence, the President of Togo used the Palace of the Governors as an office and residence. The Palace was formerly used by both German and French colonial administrators. In 1970, President Gnassingbé Eyadéma moved into a new Presidential Palace built near the Palace of the Governors. Another residence used by the Gnassingbé Eyadéma was the Presidential Residence of Lomé II. In 2006, a new Presidential Palace, financed by China, was inaugurated by President Faure Gnassingbé on the outskirts of Lomé.\nList of officeholders\n;Political parties\n|Party of Togolese Unity (PUT)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Togolese People's Movement (MPT)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Rally of the Togolese People (RPT)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Union for the Republic (UNIR)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Pan-African Patriotic Convergence (CPP)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n;Other factions\n|Military|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n;Status\n;Symbols\nElected unopposed\nPresidential referendum\nDied in office\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Portrait\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Name\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Elected\n! colspan=\"3\" |Term of office\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Political party\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Prime minister(s)\n|-\n!
