Traditionally made with lamb or mutton, it may also be made with chicken, turkey meat, beef, falafel or veal. The surface of the rotisserie meat is routinely shaved off once it cooks and is ready to be served. Shawarma is a popular street food throughout the Arab world and the Greater Middle East.\nEtymology\nThe name  in Arabic is a rendering of the term  in Turkish (, ), referring to rotisserie.\nHistory\n, 1950]]\nThe shawarma technique&mdash;grilling a vertical stack of meat slices and cutting it off as it cooks&mdash;first appeared in the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century in the form of döner kebab, which both the Greek gyros and the Levantine shawarma are derived from. Shawarma led to the development during the early 20th century of the contemporary Mexican dish tacos al pastor when it was brought there by Lebanese immigrants. The dish is also especially popular in Ottawa, Ontario, where a large community of the Lebanese diaspora exists.\nPreparations\nShawarma is prepared from thin cuts of seasoned and marinated lamb, mutton, veal, beef, chicken, or turkey. The slices are stacked on a skewer about  high. Pieces of fat may be added to the stack to provide extra juiciness and flavour. A motorized spit slowly turns the stack of meat in front of an electric or gas-fired heating element, continuously roasting the outer layer. Shavings are cut off the rotating stack for serving, customarily with a long, flat knife.\nSpices may include cumin, cardamom, cinnamon, turmeric or paprika, and in some areas baharat. Shawarma is commonly served as a sandwich or wrap, in a flatbread such as pita, shrak (saj), laffa or lavash. In the Middle East, chicken shawarma is typically served with garlic sauce, fries, and pickles. The garlic sauce served with the sandwich depends on the meat. Toum or toumie sauce is made from garlic, vegetable oil, lemon, and egg white or starch, and is usually served with chicken shawarma. Tarator sauce is made from garlic, tahini sauce, lemon, and water, and is served with beef shawarma.\nIn Israel, most shawarma is made with dark-meat turkey, commonly served with tahina sauce instead of yogurt for kashrut reasons. It is often garnished with diced tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, pickled vegetables, hummus, garlic mayo, tahini sauce, sumac, or amba mango sauce. Some restaurants offer additional toppings, including grilled peppers, eggplant, or French fries.\nIn Armenia and Georgia, shawarma is traditionally made with thin cuts of marinated meat which is left marinating overnight in spices such as coriander, cumin, cardamom, paprika, garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil.\nSome forgo the vertical spit in favor of a more traditional horizontal spit; this allows cooking over hot coals rather than electrical heaters, similar to cağ kebabı.\nGallery\nFile:Shawarma-sandwich-01.jpg|Shawarma in pita\nFile:Shawarma, Rostov-on-Don, Russia.jpg|Shawarma on lavash\nFile:Шаурма в лаваше сравнение 2 (cropped).jpg|Shawarma in cheese (top) and regular (bottom) lavash\nFile:Mixed Shawarma (2843435528).jpg|Mixed shawarma with rice and tomatoes\nFile:Shawarma preparation in central Aleppo, Syria.jpg|Slicing and preparation\nFile:2019.07.09 DC Shawarma People and Places, Washington, DC USA 190 60018.jpg|Horizontally roasted shawarma being cooked over coals\nFile:Chicken Shawarma preparation in Thiruvananthapuram 21 37 03 246000.jpeg|Chicken shawarma on a vertical rotisserie\nSee also\n* Al pastor\n* Burrito\n* Doner kebab\n* Gyros\n* Kati roll\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
