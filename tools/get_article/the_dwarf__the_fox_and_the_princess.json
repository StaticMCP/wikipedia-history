It appears as the 66th tale the Grimms' Fairy Tales (Children's and Household Tales) of the Brothers Grimm published in 1843.\nStory (Hurleburlebutz version)\nA king is lost in the forest and comes across a munchkin (a dwarf). In exchange for being led out of the forest, he promises his youngest daughter's hand in marriage to the munchkin. The dwarf thereby delivers the king safely back to his castle and informs him that he will be back in a week for the king's daughter, who was sad, for his youngest was his favorite and his daughters, informed of his obligation, promised to get rid of the dwarf. A week later, a fox comes to the castle and the daughters having persuaded an unsuspecting cowherd's daughter to be dressed her up in royalty clothes, send her out with the fox into the forest. The fox then orders the cowherd's daughter; to \"sit down on my furry tail, Hurleburlebutz!\" and then orders her to pick the fleas out of his fur which she readily agrees to, with the fox realizing it wasn't the princess and then sends her back. The next week, the fox comes back and is sent off with the gooseherd's daughter where in the forest; the fox again orders a delousing by the cowherd's daughter to which she agrees to and is then sent back. The third week, the fox returns and the king sends his daughter off into the forest with the fox, whereby upon demanding a delousing, she expresses her dismay, \"I'm a king's daughter and yet I must delouse a fox!\" With the fox knowing he has the right bride, so he then transforms back into his munchkin form, and then lives for a few years with the daughter in his hut. One day, having to leave, he then predicts to the daughter that three doves will soon come flying here, and that upon swooping down to the ground, orders her to specifically catch the middle one, and then immediately cut off that dove's head, to which she then does, with the munchkin reappearing as a handsome prince and explains to her that he was a prince that was cursed upon by a fairy, and that he was the munchkin all along, and then hereby a redeemed young prince, and they then inherit the princess father's kingdom.\nSources\nThe tale Hurleburlebutz was first provided to the Brothers Grimm by teller Jeanette Hassenpflug.
