It was made in 1911 for the coronation of British queen Mary of Teck. Mary thereafter wore it on occasion in circlet form. It was used again, in an altered form, at the coronation of Queen Camilla in 2023.\nDescription\nQueen Mary\nQueen Mary bought the Art Deco-inspired crown from Garrard & Co. out of her own pocket hoping it would become an heirloom worn by future queens consort. It is somewhat unusual for a British crown in that it has eight half-arches instead of the more typical four half-arches or two arches.\nIt is  tall and weighs . The silver-gilt crown has around 2,200 rose-cut and brilliant-cut diamonds, and originally contained the  Koh-i-Noor diamond, as well as the  Cullinan&nbsp;III and  Cullinan&nbsp;IV diamonds.\nIn 1914, those diamonds were replaced with crystal replicas for public display, and the crown's arches were made detachable so it could be worn as an open crown. Mary wore it like this after her husband, George V, died in 1936. In 1937, the year of George VI's coronation, the , heart-shaped Cullinan V was first added to the crown in place of the Koh-i-Noor, which was removed for use on the Crown of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother.\nQueen Camilla\nQueen Camilla was crowned using the crown at her coronation in May 2023. Prior to the coronation the crown was partially altered by the Crown Jewellers, Mappin and Webb. Alterations included re-setting the crown with the original Cullinan III and IV diamonds, as well as Cullinan V in place of the controversial Koh-i-Noor, as a tribute to Camilla's mother-in-law, Elizabeth II, who wore the diamonds as brooches. The number of arches was reduced from eight to four and the crown fitted with a new purple velvet cap. It was the first time since the 1700s a British queen consort reused the crown of a predecessor. In January 2025, the crown was officially renamed Queen Camilla's Crown.\nGallery\nSee also\n*Crown of Mary of Modena\n*Crown of Queen Adelaide\n*Crown of Queen Alexandra\n*Crown of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
