Once again, the French threatened Hanover, so the Allies manoeuvered around the French, surrounded the invasion force, and forced them to retreat. It was the last major action fought by Brunswick's force before the Peace of Paris brought an end to the war.\nBackground\nFrance had made a number of attempts to invade and overrun Hanover since 1757 in the hope of occupying the Electorate and using it as a bargaining counter to exchange for the return of French colonies captured by the British. The Allied army under the Duke of Brunswick had prevented them from taking Hanover, and by 1762, aware that the war was likely to draw to a close, the French had decided on a final thrust to try to defeat Brunswick and occupy Hanover.\nBattle\nFerdinand had advanced and outflanked the French on both flanks, nearly encircling them. An attack on the French center held by Stainville's command was particularly effective, with one column engaging his front, another striking his rear, inflicting some 900 casualties and forcing 2,700 to surrender.\nAftermath\nThe result is viewed as victory for the Allied forces. It ended the last French hopes of overrunning and occupying Hanover before the armistice that ended the war and the Treaty of Paris. The Anglo-German forces advanced and captured Cassel in November, but by then, the preliminaries of peace had been signed.\nSee also\n* Great Britain in the Seven Years War\n* France in the Seven Years War\nFootnotes\nReferences\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.britishbattles.com/seven-years/wilhelmstahl.htm Battle of Wilhelmsthal at www.britishbattles.com]"
