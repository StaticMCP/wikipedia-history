The song was first recorded by Bing Crosby on August 19, 1931 with Studio Orchestra directed by Victor Young, staying on the pop charts for six weeks, peaking at #3, and helping to make it a lasting standard.\nThe 1941 recording by Artie Shaw and His Orchestra earned Shaw one of his eight gold records at the height of the Big Band era of the 1930s and 1940s. Shaw's 1940 arrangement was a collaboration between Shaw and his chief arranger, Lennie Hayton, who was also an important Music Director,  arranger and orchestrator at MGM until 1953.\nIt was subsequently featured in the classic 1953 MGM musical The Band Wagon and has since come to be considered part of the Great American Songbook. In the film it is orchestrally performed to a ballet dance by Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse set in Central Park. The song is given a 'sensual and dramatic' orchestration by Conrad Salinger, choreographed by Michael Kidd.\nOther recordings\n*Al Bowlly as part of a medley on a 78rpm record Al Bowlly Remembers Medley Part 1 (November 11, 1938) (See Al Bowlly discography)\n*Charlie Parker - included in the album Charlie Parker with Strings (recorded  July 1950, released in 1954)\n*Fred Astaire - recorded for his album The Astaire Story (1952)\n*Jo Stafford - included in her 1955 album ''Broadway's Best\n*Ray Conniff - included in his album 'S Wonderful!
