Established in 2007 along with the other wards, it currently elects four councillors.\nThe River Almond flows through much of its territory, which covers the north-western edge of the city – Barnton, Cammo, Cramond, Davidson's Mains, Muirhouse (a 2017 boundary change addition which increased the population and consequently the number of councillors) and Silverknowes – and outlying communities at Dalmeny, Kirkliston, Newbridge and South Queensferry, adjoining West Lothian and the natural boundary of the Firth of Forth. In 2019, the ward had a population of 36,730.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=4|Norman Work(SNP)\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Kate Mackenzie(Conservative)\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|George Grubb(Liberal Democrats)\n!colspan=2; rowspan=2|3 seats\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=1|Lindsay Paterson(Conservative)\n|rowspan=1|Alastair Shields(Liberal Democrats)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=1|Graham Hutchison(Conservative)\n|rowspan=2|Kevin Lang(Liberal Democrats)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Louise Young(Liberal Democrats)\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Lewis James Younie(Liberal Democrats)\n|}\nElection results\n2022 election\n2017 election\n2017 City of Edinburgh Council election\n2012 election\n2012 City of Edinburgh Council election\nLiberal Democrat Councillor Alastair Shields resigned from the party and became an Independent after having been de-selected, with the intention to contest the 2017 local elections as an Independent (ultimately he retired).\n2007 election\n2007 City of Edinburgh Council election\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/scotland/almond-ward-city-of-edinburgh#.YGRNu1PTVkw Listed Buildings in Almond Ward, City of Edinburgh] at British Listed Buildings"
