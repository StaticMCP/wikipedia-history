      "text": "# Choragic Monument of Nikias\n\nThe Choragic Monument of Nikias is a memorial building built on the Acropolis of Athens in 320–319 BCE to commemorate the choregos Nikias, son of Nikodemos. It was situated between the Theatre of Dionysos and the Stoa of Eumenes where its foundations remain along with some fragmentary elements of the structure.  It was built in the form of a substantial hexastyle Doric temple with a square cella and might have been surmounted with the prize tripod of the Dionysia.  The monument was dismantled at some point in late antiquity and the masonry reused in the Beulé Gate.\nArchaeology\nIn 1889 Wilhelm Dörpfeld proposed a site in the area of the Odeon of Herodes Atticus for the foundations of the building, which idea was eventually discarded. This identification was then used as a terminus ante quem for the destruction of the choragic monument and the building of the Beulé Gate before the construction of the Odeon in the middle of the second century. William Dinsmoor finally identified the site in 1910.\nMost of the surviving architectural remains of the choragic monument, notably its inscription,IG II2 3055, which reads: \"Nikias, son of Nikodemos, of the deme Xypete, dedicated this altar being victorious with Kekropis in the boys' contest. Pantaleon of Sikyon played the aulos. The song Elpenor of Timotheos. Neaichmos was Archon.\" were later built into the central portion of the Beulé Gate, which was uncovered by Charles Ernest Beulé in 1852. These remains were first studied in 1885 by Dörpfeld.\nThe exact date of the destruction of the monument is unknown, however, Dinsmoor argued that it might have been at the same time as the demolition of the Stoa of Eumenes in the late Roman period, before the reconstruction of the Theatre of Dionysos by Phaidros in the 3rd or 4th century CE.\nChoragic monuments\nTwo of the major choragic monuments that have survived (Thrasyllos' and Nikias') belong to the period of oligarchic rule under the Macedonian regency, and it is perhaps significant that these are not on the Street of the Tripods, where most choragic prizes and monuments were placed. The conspicuous display of wealth and prestige they represent may have been an attempt to further the political careers of the choregoi and as such prompted the sumptuary law of Demetrios of Phaleron.\nFile:Monument chorégique de Nicias 01.JPG|Present remains of the monument of Nikias.\nFile:2496 - Athens - Acropolis - Beulé Gate from outside - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 09 2009.jpg|Epistyle of the choragic monument located on the Beulé Gate.\nFile:Χορηγικό μνημείο Νικία 4936.jpg|Site of the choragic monument of Nikias.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
