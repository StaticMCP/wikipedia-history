Both countries are members of the Council of Europe and NATO.\nHistory\nDiplomatic relations were first established in 1993 following North Macedonia's (then formerly known officially as the Republic of Macedonia) independence from Yugoslavia in 1991. The UK has supported both North Macedonia's bid to join the European Union and North Macedonia's accession to NATO. In June 1996, the first British-Macedonian parliamentary group was established.\nEconomic relations\nOn 3 December 2020, North Macedonia and the United Kingdom signed the Partnership, Trade and Cooperation Agreement to continue preferential trade terms after the end of the UK's Brexit transition period. The agreement also strengthened political, economic, security and cultural ties between both nations.\nDiplomatic missions\nThe current ambassador of North Macedonia to the United Kingdom is Aleksandra Miovska, while Rachel Galloway currently serves as the British ambassador to North Macedonia. North Macedonia operates an embassy in London, and the UK has an embassy in Skopje.\nSee also\n* Foreign relations of North Macedonia\n* Foreign relations of the United Kingdom\n* Macedonians in the United Kingdom\n* United Kingdom–Yugoslavia relations\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.gov.uk/world/north-macedonia/news North Macedonia and the UK] - Gov.uk"
