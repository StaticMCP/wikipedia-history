Stewart Company was a custom builder of wooden auto bodies. When factory-built steel bodies overtook wood construction, the company broke into the aviation market with the Stewart M-1, an all-wood monoplane. Sensing wood construction was about to be overtaken by all-metal aircraft, the Stewart M-2 was developed.\nThe M-2 was an all-metal, twin-engined aircraft with conventional landing gear, powered with Wright J-6 engines. 225&nbsp;hp Packard DR-980 engines were later installed and tested. Townend rings were used on the re-installed Wright J-6 engines.\nOperational history\nDesigner Jack Hunt test flew the prototype on 22 May 1931. No orders for new aircraft were received. The aircraft was used by Abrams Aerial Survey Corporation for aerial surveys. The airframe was scrapped in 1941.\nSpecifications (M-2)\nReferences"
