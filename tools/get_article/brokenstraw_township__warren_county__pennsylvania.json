He \"reported that there were more Indians in the area then than whites.\"\nCallender built a \"stately white mansion ... on the banks of the Allegheny in 1822,\" overlooking Crull's Island. \"Callender Irvine's brother, Dr. John W. Irvine shared in the management of the [general] store, along with Robinson R. Moore, until 1820, after which he practiced medicine in Brokenstraw.\"\nWilliam A. Irvine, M.D., another son of Callender's, settled in Brokenstraw in 1825, and\nspent his life attempting to turn the Irvine property to profitable commercial ventures. Among his many enterprises were a lumbering business, the general store started by his father, a wool factory, an iron foundry, and further speculation ... his farm, internal improvements ... the blacksmith shop ... and the Irvine post office.
