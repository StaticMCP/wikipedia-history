Peters' own election in the district of 2nd Kings was almost in doubt, due to a tie vote of 515 votes each for him and his Conservative opponent; following a judicial recount, a by-election was held where Peters was acclaimed as the district's Assemblyman.\nPeters died in January 1908, and was succeeded as Premier by Francis Haszard.\nThe seat counts of both parties in this election did not change.\nOne of the two members from each constituency is styled a Councillor, and the other an Assemblyman. In electoral contests Councillor candidates runs against Councillor candidates; Assemblyman candidates against Assemblyman candidates.\nParty Standings\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Party Leader\n!colspan=\"2\"|Seats\n!colspan=\"2\"|Popular Vote\n|-\n!1900\n!Elected\n!#\n!%\n|Liberal\n|Arthur Peters\n| align=right|22\n! align=right|22\n| align=right|17,011\n| align=right|54.1%\n|\n|John A.

This was a holdover from when the Island had a bicameral legislature, the General Assembly and the Legislative Council.\nIn 1893, the Legislative Council was abolished and had its membership merged with the Assembly, though the two titles remained separate and were elected by different electoral franchises. Assembleymen were elected by all eligible voters of within a district, while Councillors were only elected by landowners within a district.\nKings\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
