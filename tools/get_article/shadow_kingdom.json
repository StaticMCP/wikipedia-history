It is Dylan's first album of new studio recordings since his 2020 album Rough and Rowdy Ways. The songs were recorded at Village Recorder in West Los Angeles in early 2021 to accompany Alma Har'el's film Shadow Kingdom: The Early Songs of Bob Dylan, which was shot later. Although no musicians are listed in the credits, various sources have identified the session players as consisting of veterans such as T Bone Burnett and Don Was. It is the first album in which Dylan plays with a band that features no drums or percussion.\nShadow Kingdom consists of new recordings of 13 songs from the first half of Dylan's career plus a new instrumental track titled \"Sierra's Theme\". The album was preceded by a single for \"Watching the River Flow\", which was released on streaming platforms and as a YouTube video on April 13, 2023. The performance of \"Forever Young\" from Har'el's film was released as a standalone video on June 2, 2023. The album received universal praise from critics.\nPackaging\nThe album's cover photograph is a black-and-white still image of Bob Dylan playing the harmonica taken from the film Shadow Kingdom: The Early Songs of Bob Dylan, directed by Alma Har'el and shot by Lol Crawley.

Bauer also claimed that the album \"stands as a good retort for all the naysayers who have argued, seemingly from day one, that Dylan can't sing. The subdued arrangements are perfect for Dylan's well-weathered, unfairly maligned voice\".\nThe Daily Telegraphs Neil McCormick gave the album a five out of five star rating and wrote: \"[...] what an absolute joy it is, in which the grand old man of songcraft flips through his own back pages with genuine relish, a man in his 80s revisiting the words of his firebrand youth and finding entirely new meanings there.\"\nWriting in Uncut, Richard Williams rated the album four out of five stars, arguing that its sound seemingly grew out of Dylan's previous album Rough and Rowdy Ways. Williams called the music a \"loose, fluid instrumental mesh\" and described how \"slow swells of accordion, acoustic guitars and bowed string bass\" underline \"the carefully articulated front-and-centre vocal\".\nMojos John Mulvey likewise gave the album four out of five stars, calling it \"an extremely useful addition to the Dylan catalogue\" and highlighted the performance of \"What Was It You Wanted\" as \"particularly impressive\" for its \"gravitas\".\nTim Cumming, writing at The Arts Desk, noted that the \"best song performances – \"Queen Jane Approximately\", \"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\" and \"Tombstone Blues\" from Highway 61, a poignant \"Forever Young\" and a killer version of \"What Was It You Wanted\", one I may never hear bettered – make this required listening when it comes to later-period Bob, a rare look back in studio conditions, and from a high point in his career\".\nPaul Sinclair, writing at the Super Deluxe Edition website, called it \"a record for Dylan diehards to treasure – the latest of several releases by him that are essential purchases\".\nReviewing the album for Hot Press, Pat Carty praised the way \"Monumental song writing achievements have the patina of familiarity and reverence blown off them and are allowed to be heard anew. This arrangement of 'Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues' – to offer just one example – transports the song forwards (and backwards) in time from the wild, hipper-than-anyone-has-ever-been, frazzled Godhead of Highway 61 Revisited to the calmer when-you're-lost-in-the-rain-in-Juarez environs of the Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid soundtrack\".\nSinger/songwriter Elliott Murphy cited Dylan's performance of \"Most Likely You Go Your Way and I'll Go Mine\" on this album as one of his top 10 songs of the 21st century in an article for Poetic Justice Magazine.\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Accolades for Shadow Kingdom\n! scope=\"col\"| Publication\n! scope=\"col\"| Accolade\n! scope=\"col\"| Rank\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Forbes\n|2023 Archival Releases So Far\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|N/A\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Metacritic\n|Best Albums of 2023\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|74\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Rolling Stone\n|The Best Albums of 2023 So Far\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|N/A\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|  Ultimate Classic Rock\n|Top 10 Reissues of 2023\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|10\n|}\nCommercial performance\nShadow Kingdom debuted at number 71 on the Billboard 200 but was the seventh best-selling album in the US during its first week of release based on pure album sales.
