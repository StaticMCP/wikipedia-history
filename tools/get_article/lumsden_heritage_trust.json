The trust has two ex-AFFCO locomotives that were formerly preserved by the Goldfields Railway, the chassis of P 60, ex-New Zealand Railways (NZR) wagons that were formerly preserved by the Ohai Railway Board Heritage Trust, a railway station including a crane next to it and a jail from the Lumsden camping grounds.\nThe trust planned to recover two V class steam locomotives from the Mararoa Junction Locomotive Dump in the Ōreti River These two locomotives were unearthed in 2018. On 29 January 2020, V 127 was recovered and put on display, but it proved impracticable to remove V 126. After further consideration a new attempt to remove V 126 was made on 27 February 2020, and this proved successful. The following day the locomotive was also put on display.\nThe trust plans to relocate the original wooden Anglican All Saints Church to re-purpose it as a regional war memorial museum and to host some of the events being planned to commemorate World War I.\nLocomotives and rolling stock\nNZR steam locomotives\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Key:\n|bgcolor=#F5D26C|In service\n|bgcolor=#89E579|In service, Mainline Certified\n|bgcolor=#f4a460|Under overhaul/restoration/repair\n|bgcolor=#DED7B6|Stored\n|bgcolor=#B7A4EB|Static display\n|bgcolor=#cecece|Scrapped\n|}\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!
