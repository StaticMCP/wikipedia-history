Bradley was unable to negotiate the LZW patent licence necessary for encoding the then-popular GIF format. The patent has now expired, so this legal constraint is no longer relevant.\nUntil at least 2000, Bradley collected third-party updates to xv, for example, support for the PNG image format.\nThese were published as source code patches only.\nxv can be run from the command line and offers a graphical interface.\nxv can be used also for image manipulation (cropping or stretching of images and other effects), supports various image file formats (including among others Sun Raster, or Targa) and allows export to PostScript.\nIt distinguishes itself from many other bitmap viewing and editing programs with a very efficient interface in which the user edits just the parameters of a fixed pipeline of processing steps, rather than modifying the bitmap directly in each operation. As a result, the user can easily undo operations (such as cropping, color modifications, filtering) out of order, rather than only being able to undo the respective last operation. While this concept limits what xv can do compared to some alternatives, the functionality it provides can be applied very conveniently and efficiently.\nSee also\n* Comparison of image viewers\nNotes\nExternal links\n* [http://groupbcl.ca/blog/posts/2019/building-xv-on-ubuntu/ Building 'xv' on Ubuntu]"
