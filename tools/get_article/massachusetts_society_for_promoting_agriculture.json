The Society was incorporated by an act of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts  on March 7, 1792. The Society's founding members included Samuel Adams, Charles Bulfinch, Timothy Pickering, Benjamin Lincoln, Christopher Gore, and Benjamin Guild.\nHistory\nThe Massachusetts Society for Promoting Agriculture was established to promote the study and experimentation of agricultural endeavors. The M.S.P.A. historically has given handsome premiums to individuals who made useful discoveries in the field and communicated these improvements to the general public.\nPremiums\nThe first premiums (prizes) offered by the MSPA were $50 for \"the most satisfactory account of the natural history of the canker-worm\" and $100 for the cheapest and most effective method of eradicating it. Premiums were also offered for the cultivation of wheat and other grains; the improvement of land, including the reclamation of salt marshes; the raising of trees; the greatest stock maintained on the least land; the best vegetable food for wintering stock; the most and best wool from a given number of sheep; the best process for making cider, maple sugar, butter, cheese, flax, and salted provisions; and for the best farm journals, manures, tree plantations, advances in ploughs and ploughing techniques, and farms in general.\nGrants are offered for projects that benefit the agriculture practiced in Massachusetts in a manner that is both economically and environmentally sound; that will broaden the knowledge of and support for farmers and farming in Massachusetts; that would not be likely to receive funding from government or corporate sources, but where a grant from the Society would enhance the chances of such funding by way of matching grants; or that would stimulate research in new areas.\nTimeline\n|The society was incorporated by an act of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.}}\n|Samuel Adams authorized the first meeting of the society to be held in the town of Boston.
