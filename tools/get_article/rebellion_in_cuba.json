It was shot on the Isle of Pines and smuggled out of the country.\nThe film featured an appearance from boxer Jake La Motta.\nIt was also known as Chivato.\nPremise\nAmericans take part in the overthrow of Castro’s Communist regime in Cuba.\nCast\n*Sonia Marero\n*Lon Chaney Jr\n*Jake La Motta as Julio\nProduction\nThe film started shooting in Cuba with the approval of the Castro government under the title Chivato!. The original cast included Van Johnson, George Raft and Ricardo Montalban. However Johnson and Montalban withdrew when they discovered they would be paid in pesos and Raft was forbidden entry because of his links with the previous Cuban government. Lon Chaney became involved instead.\nThe government gave its approval provided the story was not set in Cuba. However there were conflicts with the government over filming and permission was withdrawn. The filmmakers smuggled footage off the island. The remainder of the film - an estimated 20% - was shot in South Miami.\nReception\nThe Miami News reported that at the film's premiere the audience hissed Castro but that Communist spies took note of Cubans who appeared in the film and they subsequently disappeared.\nThe New York Daily News said the film's \"intention was a noble one\" but \"its production left much to be desired and rough edges are visible from time to time.\"\nChaney's biographer wrote \"The location backdrop of the Isle of Pines is unfortunately the film’s only concession to reality as we see a Cuba more resembling Nazi-occupied Europe than the island’s actual postrevolution situation. As propaganda would dictate, all the Cuban citizens support the revolt and see it through to success. Both as an action film and as a treatment of a serious political subject, this work... fails in every way.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
