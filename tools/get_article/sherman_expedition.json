Their goal was to change the governments of Honduras and Guatemala by attempting to seize the port of Omoa. However, the small garrison at the castle in Omoa skillfully defeated them through a clever maneuver on August 7, 1873, forcing the expedition to hastily re-embark.\nAnother part of the expedition, having entered the country through Puerto Cortés to San Pedro Sula, confronted General Gregorio Solares and his 600 Guatemalan troops entrenched north of the Chamelecón River, about two leagues from the city. On August 9 of the same year, the invading expedition, comprising 450 men, suffered a defeat with significant casualties, including General Casto Alvarado. This defeat rendered them incapable of further actions.\nReferences"
