He was a truck driver featured on Ice Road Truckers from season six in 2012 until his death. He was from Deer Lodge, Montana.\nOn August 28, 2016, Ward died in a plane crash while travelling in a single-engined Cessna 182 Skylane with pilot Mark Melotz. They had departed from Missoula 53 minutes prior to the crash and were attempting to land at a nearby airstrip in Clinton, Montana. The National Transportation Safety Board concluded the cause of the accident to be \"The sudden right turn on approach to landing for reasons that could not be determined because a post-accident examination did not reveal any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.\"\nReferences"
