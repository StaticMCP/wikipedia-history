It was released in April 1992 through Mercury Records. Like Cray’s previous album, it features his regular backing band playing alongside the Memphis Horns.\nCritical reception\nIn AllMusic, Daniel Gioffre wrote of the album:\n[...] the tracks are devoid of any kind of dirt whatsoever, which prevents them from really kicking the listener the way that they should. Granted, Cray isn't R. L. Burnside or even Buddy Guy, but a little more grit to the band performances, arrangements, tones, and recording would go a long way toward aiding the emotional kick of his admittedly great set of pipes. Cray is also not aided by the writing, which is hit or miss throughout. [...] His playing is powerful and idiosyncratic, but his intensity and focus are unfortunately not matched by other aspects of this recording. I Was Warned is not a bad Cray album by any means; it just lacks the sort of fire that would make it really take off.\nTrack listing\n# \"Just a Loser\" (Tim Kaihatsu) – 4:23\n# \"I'm a Good Man\" (Cray, Dennis Walker) – 4:12\n# \"I Was Warned\" (Cray, Dennis Walker) – 7:15\n# \"The Price I Pay\" (Cray, Dennis Walker) – 5:06\n# \"Won the Battle\" (Jim Pugh, Dennis Walker) – 3:53\n# \"On the Road Down\" (Cray, Steve Cropper) – 4:02\n# \"A Whole Lotta Pride\" (Cray, Dennis Walker) – 4:34\n# \"A Picture of a Broken Heart\" (Boz Scaggs, Dennis Walker) – 5:22\n# \"He Don't Live Here Anymore\" (Jim Pugh, Dennis Walker) – 5:13\n# \"Our Last Time\" (John Hanes, Jim Pugh) – 5:10\nPersonnel\n*Robert Cray - vocals, guitar\n*Jim Pugh - keyboards\n*Karl Sevareid - bass\n*Kevin Hayes - drums\n*Tim Kaihatsu - rhythm guitar\n;Memphis Horns\n*Andrew Love - tenor saxophone\n*Wayne Jackson - trumpet, trombone\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/play/1992-08.php Review] by Robert Christgau for Playboy"
