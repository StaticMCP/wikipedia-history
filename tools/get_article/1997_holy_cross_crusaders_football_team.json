      "text": "# 1997 Holy Cross Crusaders football team\n\nThe 1997 Holy Cross Crusaders football team was an American football team that represented the College of the Holy Cross during the 1997 NCAA Division I-AA football season. Holy Cross tied for second-to-last in the Patriot League.\nIn their second year under head coach Dan Allen, the Crusaders compiled a 4–7 record. Dominic Blue and Jeff Laboranti were the team captains.\nThe Crusaders were outscored 308 to 182. Holy Cross' 2–4 conference record placed it in a three-way tie for fourth in the seven-team Patriot League standings.\nThe team's claimed 4–7 and 2–4 records count the season-opening Towson matchup as a Holy Cross win by forfeit, as Towson agreed in October 1997 that it had used an academically ineligible player in that game.\nHoly Cross played its home games at Fitton Field on the college campus in Worcester, Massachusetts.\nSchedule\n| September 20 |   |\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | W 25 21\n| 5,827 |\n| September 27 |   | Dartmouth\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | L 6 35\n| 3,000 |\n| October 4 |   | Princeton\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | L 7 21\n| 8,542 |\n| October 11 | @ | Columbia\n| Wien Stadium | New York, NY | W 45 16\n| 3,335 |\n| October 18 | @ | Harvard\n| Harvard Stadium | Boston, MA | L 24 52\n| 7,094 |\n| October 25 | @ | Bucknell\n| Christy Mathewson–Memorial Stadium | Lewisburg, PA | L 6 18\n| 7,872 |\n| November 1 |   | Colgate^\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | L 7 42\n| 2,826 |\n| November 8 | @ | Lehigh\n| Goodman Stadium | Bethlehem, PA | W 20 14\n| 4,865 |\n| November 15 |   | Lafayette\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | L 23 34\n| 1,105 |\n| November 22 |   | Fordham\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA (rivalry) | L 12 28\n| 725 |\n}}\nReferences"
