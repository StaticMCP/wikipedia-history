Formed in 2002, Arctic Monkeys currently consists of Alex Turner on lead vocals and guitar, Jamie Cook on guitar, Matt Helders on drums and backing vocals, and Nick O'Malley on bass guitar and backing vocals, a position formerly held by Andy Nicholson. The band's initial popularity came from fan-made demo tapes and online file sharing, and were heralded as one of the first acts to come to the public attention via the Internet. Commentators suggested at the time that they represented the possibility of a change in the way in which new bands are promoted and marketed. The band eventually signed to the independent record label Domino Records.\nArctic Monkeys achieved chart success with their first single \"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor\" which reached number one in the UK Singles Chart.

It received critical acclaim, winning both the 2006 Mercury Prize and the 2007 BRIT Awards for Best British Album.  The band's second album, Favourite Worst Nightmare, was released on 23 April 2007, sold over 225,000 copies in its debut week, and was nominated for the 2007 Mercury Prize. The group also picked up the award for Best British Album and Best British Group at the BRIT Awards in 2008. Overall, the band has won five BRIT Awards, including \"Best British Breakthrough Act\" in 2006, \"Best British Album\" in 2007 for ''Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, and \"Best British Group\" in 2008.
