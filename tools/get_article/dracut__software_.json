The tool named  is used to create a Linux boot image (initramfs) by copying tools and files from an installed system and combining it with the Dracut framework.\nThe initramfs has essentially one purpose: locating and mounting the real root file system so that the boot process can transition to it. This functionality is dependent on device availability. Therefore, instead of having hard-coded scripts to determine device availability and suitability, Dracut's initramfs depends on the Linux device manager (udev) to create symbolic links to device nodes. When the root file system's device node appears, Dracut mounts it as the new root file system. This helps to minimize the time required in initramfs such that, for example, 5-second boots are possible.\nMost of the initramfs generation functionality in Dracut is provided by generator modules that are sourced by the main  tool to install specific functionality into the initramfs. They live in the modules subdirectory, and use functionality provided by dracut-functions to do their work.\nFeatures\nDracut supports booting from direct attached storage\n* ext2, ext3, ext4\n* XFS, F2FS, jfs\n* btrfs\n* ZFS\n* MD RAID\n* Device mapper, dmraid, dm-integrity, dm-verity\n* lvm\n* device mapper multipath I/O\n* LUKS, dm-crypt, eCryptfs\n* Virtiofs, Virtfs\n* SquashFS, EROFS, iso\n* OverlayFS\nDracut supports booting from network storage\n* CIFS\n* FCoE\n* iSCSI\n* NBD\n* NFS\nDracut supports the following architectures\n* i386, i686, X86-64\n* AArch64, ARM architecture family\n* MIPS architecture\n* ppc64\n* S390x\nDracut can use the following shells\n* bash\n* dash\n* ash\nDracut supports the following init systems\n* systemd\n* OpenRC (Gentoo)\n* busybox (Alpine Linux)\n* runit (Void Linux)\n* sysVinit (CRUX, Slackware, Devuan, MX Linux)\nDracut can be used for live media generation. It has flags for squashfs, and other things like overlay file system.\nHistory\nDracut originated from Fedora Linux sponsored initially by Red Hat in [https://github.com/dracut-ng/dracut-ng/commit/ec9315e56222d38fdbfca5f8e47f05c156ce4927 Dec 2008]. Dracut is named after the town of Dracut, similar to Wayland and Weston. This follows the tradition of Red Hat naming projects after places near the headquarters of Red Hat in Westford, Massachusetts.\nIn 2013, the development moved to GitHub from Kernel.org, while a [https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/boot/dracut/dracut.git mirror] was maintained till 2022 (v56).\nAs of Oct 2021, after the long time lead developer Harald Hoyer [https://github.com/dracut-ng/dracut-ng/commit/51c06d9feaa625485444c145a530058911a756b9 left] Red Hat it is a [https://github.com/dracut-ng/dracut-ng/graphs/contributors community-managed] open source project.\nIn [https://github.com/dracut-ng/dracut-ng/pull/1 Mar 29 2024], the project was moved to a new code repository by the core team after the project leader had not been heard from for several months.\nIn Feb 2025, Ubuntu announced a [https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/spec-switch-to-dracut/54776 plan] to switch the default initramfs infrastructure from initramfs-tools to dracut.\nAdoption\nDistributions that depend on the dracut project for initramfs generation. The list is sorted by the date when dracut (partially or fully) became the dependency for generating initramfs by default for a given distribution.\n* Fedora Linux (2009, version 12 Constantine)\n* Red Hat Enterprise Linux (2010, version 6)\n* Gentoo  (2010 for custom kernels, 2020 for distribution kernels)\n* [https://openmamba.org openmamba] (2010)\n* OpenMandriva Lx (2011, Mandriva Linux), Mageia (2012, version 2)\n* Void Linux (2012)\n*  Solus  (2013)\n*  Endless OS (first Debian based) (2014), [https://github.com/gardenlinux gardenlinux ] (2020)\n* openSUSE (2014, version 13.2)\n* SUSE Linux Enterprise (2014, version 12)\n* [https://www.adelielinux.org/ Adelie Linux] (2017)\n* ALT Linux (2020)\n* [https://vmware.github.io/photon/ PhotosOS] (2015), Azure Linux  (2024)\n* [https://aosc.io// AOSC OS] (2021)\n* KaOS (2021)\n* CRUX (2021)\n* EndeavourOS (first Arch based) (2022), Garuda Linux (2023, Raptor)\n* Ubuntu (2011, version 11.04 universe repository), (2024-Feb dracut-install in main repository, Lubuntu moved to dracut by default)\n* Debian (2010, version 6 Squeeze), (2024-March, dracut-install)\n* Chimera Linux (2024-Jun, dracut-install)\n* [https://codeberg.org/side Side Linux] (2024-Sept)\nMost distributions have made the [https://repology.org/project/dracut/versions dracut package] available to allow replacing the distribution's default initramfs generator.
