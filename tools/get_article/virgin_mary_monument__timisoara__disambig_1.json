The legend goes that György Dózsa has been executed there. The monument is a romanesque style canopy set on six pillars, under which lies the statue of Mary, carved in Carrara marble. The monument is part of the old Iosefin district, inscribed in the list of historical monuments with the code TM-II-s-B-06098.\nHistory\nIn 1514 there was a revolt against the nobility led by the Szekler György Dózsa. The serfs were forbidden to enlist in the crusader army, as leaving the lands would have severely affected the Hungarian nobility. Thus, they revolted. However, György Dózsa's peasant army was defeated at the gates of the Timișoara Fortress and he was captured. Dózsa was burned alive, sitting on a reddened throne and wearing a hot iron crown. Legend goes that during György Dózsa's execution, the Jesuits, who were chanting religious songs, saw Virgin Mary's figure in the smoke, which was considered a miracle. An icon of Virgin Mary was placed there, on a pillar, in a glass-framed box, to mark the event. It was kept there while Timișoara was occupied by the Turks (for 164 years) and long after that. After the liberation of the city in 1716, the Jesuits organized processions there. The icon was accidentally broken by a carter who came to the fair. Bishop  raised money to replace the icon with a wood-carved one. In 1865, this icon-statue was replaced with a Bavarian stone statue. In 1877 the nuns of the School Sisters of Notre Dame brought a statue from the Mayer'sche Hofkunstanstalt in Munich at their expense. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Timișoara City Hall decided to restore the monument. It was built in 1906 according to a project by , and the statue of Virgin Mary was made by sculptor .
