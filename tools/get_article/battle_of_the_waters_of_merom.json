Archaeologist Nadav Na'aman has suggested that this battle definitely took place, and that its narrative \"preserved some remote echoes of wars conducted in these places in early Iron Age I.\"\nIn the biblical narrative, around 40 years before the battle, the Israelites escaped from slavery in Egypt, setting out for  the Exodus under the leadership of Moses. They entered Canaan near Jericho and captured several cities. An alliance of northern Canaanite city-states sent a united force to halt the Israelite invasion. The Israelites engaged in a preemptive strike, catching the Canaanite forces unaware and routing them with a fearsome head-on assault. The battle is described in Joshua chapter 11.\nSee also\n*Early Israelite campaigns\nReferences"
