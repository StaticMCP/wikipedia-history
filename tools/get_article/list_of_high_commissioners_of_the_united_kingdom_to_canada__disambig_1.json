Thus, the countries exchange high commissioners, rather than ambassadors.\nThe offices of the British High Commission are on Sussex Drive in Ottawa, opposite Global Affairs Canada.\nThe British high commissioner's residence is Earnscliffe in Ottawa on Sussex Drive. The house was built in 1855, was later occupied by Canada's first prime minister, John A. Macdonald, and was bought in 1930 by the first British high commissioner to Canada, Sir William Clark.\nThe incumbent chargé d’affaires is David Prodger, who assumed the office in November 2024. Robert Tinline will become high commissioner from February 2025.\nList of heads of mission\nHigh commissioners to Canada\n* 1928–1934: Sir William Clark\n* 1934–1938: Sir Francis Floud\n* 1938–1941: Sir Gerald Campbell\n* 1941–1946: Malcolm MacDonald\n* 1946–1952: Sir Alexander Clutterbuck\n* 1952–1956: Sir Archibald Nye\n* 1956–1961: Sir Saville Garner\n* 1961–1963: The Viscount Amory\n* 1963–1968: Sir Henry Lintott\n* 1968–1970: Sir Colin Crowe\n* 1970–1974: Sir Peter Hayman\n* 1974–1978: Sir John Johnston\n* 1978–1981: Sir John Ford\n* 1981–1984: The Lord Moran\n* 1984–1987: Sir Derek Day\n* 1987–1989: Sir Alan Urwick\n* 1989–1992: Sir Brian Fall\n* 1992–1996: Sir Nicholas Bayne\n* 1996–2000: Sir Anthony Goodenough\n* 2000–2003: Sir Andrew Burns\n* 2003–2006: David Reddaway\n* 2006–2011: Anthony Cary\n* 2011–2012: Andrew Pocock\n* 2012–2013: Corin Robertson (acting)\n* 2013–2017: Howard Drake\n* 2017–2021: Susan le Jeune d'Allegeershecque\n*2021–2024:Susannah Goshko\n*2024–2025: David Prodger (Chargé d’Affaires)\n*2025–present: Robert Tinline\nSee also\n* British High Commission, Ottawa\n* Canada–United Kingdom relations\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.gov.uk/government/world/organisations/british-high-commission-ottawa British High Commission Ottawa]"
