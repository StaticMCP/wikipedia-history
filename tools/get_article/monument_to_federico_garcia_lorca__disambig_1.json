Located at the Plaza de Santa Ana, in front of the Teatro Español, it consists of a bronze statue of the aforementioned poet and playwright.\nHistory and description\nThe idea for the monument traces back to 1984, via a petition by  (then director of the Teatro Español), who asked the Ayuntamiento for the erection of a statue dedicated to García Lorca, on the 50th anniversary of the first time the play Yerma was performed.\nA work by , its inception took place between 1984 and 1986. It was subsequently stored for about a decade at the Cuartel del Conde-Duque, during the reform works of its intended location, the Plaza de Santa Ana.\nThe full body bronze statue representing the poet is looking at the Teatro Español, while holding a lark about to take off between his hands. Larks and nightingales are common motifs in his poems.\nThe inscription reads  (\"Madrid, to Federico García Lorca\").\nStill a symbol of the polarized past of Spain by the turn of the 21st century, according to David Crocker \"the statue, at least, is still an emblem of the contested past: each day, the Left puts a red kerchief on the neck of the statue, and someone from the Right comes later to take it off\". In April 2011, during a vandal attack, the lark was removed from his hands.\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n*\n*"
