A month after Muhammad returned from the pilgrimage (1st Umrah), he dispatched Ibn Abi Al-Awja Al-Sulami a group of 50 Muslims fighters to\nBanu Sulaym, demanding their allegiance to Islam. Banu Sulaym were a sister tribe of Banu Hawazin and inhabited the area of Najran and Turbah.\nWhen Ibn Abi Al-Awja arrived in the Banu Sulaym area, he called them to convert to Islam. When the tribe refused, fighting erupted. Banu Sulaym fought back, and showered the Muslims with arrows and killed many of them. Ibn Abi Al-Awja was wounded and escaped to Medina with great difficulty. However, a year later, the Banu Sulaym embraced Islam and sent an embassy to submit themselves, as Muhammad was increasing his power.\nSee also\n*Military career of Muhammad\n*List of expeditions of Muhammad\nNotes"
