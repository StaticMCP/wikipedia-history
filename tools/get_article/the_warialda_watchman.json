This newspaper was published by Alfred Wiskens from 12 January 1899 and is believed to have ceased publication in the same year. Some issues were published with supplements.\nHistory\nNumerous newspapers were published in New South Wales during the nineteenth century. A wide range of public information sources, including newspapers, were produced to influence regional consciousness through the agenda of issues that they reported. A survey of New England newspapers, the region that includes Warialda, shows a geographical bias in news reporting.\nDigitisation\nThe paper has been digitised as part of the Australian Newspapers Digitisation Program of the National Library of Australia.\nSee also\n*List of newspapers in New South Wales\n*List of newspapers in Australia\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
