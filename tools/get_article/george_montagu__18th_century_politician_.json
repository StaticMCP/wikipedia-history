He is known for his correspondence with Horace Walpole.\nHe was a lover of Horace Walpole and according to the Walpole scholar Wilmarth Sheldon Lewis (1895–1979), Walpole's letters to Montagu are \".. of more general interest than are those written to any other correspondent ...\".\nGeorge Montagu was the eldest son of Brigadier Edward Montagu. George became a friend of Horace Walpole when they attended Eton and their friendship lasted until about 1770. According to Walpole, their friendship ended partly because of political differences and partly because of Montagu's caprice.\nMontagu was Ranger of Selwyn Forest. He was Usher of the Black Rod in Ireland from 1761 to 1763 during the Viceroyalty of his cousin, the 2nd Earl of Halifax. George Montagu was also Private Secretary to Lord North, when the latter was Chancellor of the Exchequer.\nMontagu was elected Member of Parliament for Northampton from 1744 to 1754 for the Whigs.\nReferences"
