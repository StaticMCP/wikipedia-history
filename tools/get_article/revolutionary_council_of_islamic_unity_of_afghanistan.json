The movement was led by Sayyid Ali Beheshti.\nThe Shura had both political and militant arms, and removed many Kabul-backed authorities within the Hazarajat (Hazara-populated region of Afghanistan), replacing them with their own functionaries.The Shura was considered as a government for the whole Hazarajat and used to be a powerful party among the Hazaras.  By the end of 1983 the Shura controlled 60% of the population of the Hazarajat.\nThe Shura was the primary Hazara resistance movement part of the Tehran Eight political constellation, followed by the Al-Nasr (Victory) and the Union of Islamic Fighters.\nReferences"
