Although they are referred to as two parks, they are separated only by one road which runs between the 1 hectare rectangular area it covers.\nIt is located between the streets of Rubislaw Terrace and Albyn Place, in the west-end of Aberdeen approximately 300 metres from the main street in Aberdeen, Union Street.\nThere is a fountain in the park made from pink granite and trees which are over a century old. On the Rubislaw Terrace (north) side of the park, there is a gray granite wall of small pillars along the entire side.\nHistory\nIn February 1989, the City of Aberdeen District Council and the Scottish Sculpture Workshop ran a competition to design a new fountain to be built out of granite in Rubislaw Terrace Gardens, with the chosen design to receive £5,000. The commission was awarded to Susan Ball, who based her concept of the fountain on the balustrades of the structures surrounding the park.\nIn 1992, the District Council allocated £100,000 to repair the surrounding structures of both gardens due to vandalism.\nGallery\nImage:Rubislaw Terrace Gardens Fountain.jpg|Fountain made of pink granite in the centre of the Rubislaw Terrace Gardens\nImage:Buildings from Queen's Terrace gardens.jpg|Houses on Rubislaw Terrace viewed from Queen's Terrace Gardens\nSee also\n*Green spaces and walkways in Aberdeen\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/services/leisure-culture-and-parks/parks-and-gardens/rubislaw-and-queens-terrace-gardens Rubislaw and Queen's Terrace Gardens]"
