Located behind the Fairbanks Exploration Company (F.E. Company) administration building at 612 Illinois Street, it is a large single-story steel-frame structure, built in 1927 to serve the company's nearby gold mining operations.  Its easternmost section is  high, while that on the west is  high, in order to accommodate belt-driven equipment and cranes.  A tall double door at the center of the east facade is the main entrance.  The front of the building housed large belt-driven lathes, while the center had a welding shop, drill presses, and a tool room.  A blacksmithy in the back had a sand floor.  The building was used by the F.E. Company between 1927 and 1964.\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska\nReferences"
