He was an unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Pennsylvania in 1886.\nBiography\nBorn in Glades, Pennsylvania on November 24, 1839, he was the son of justice for the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, U.S. Attorney General and U.S. Secretary of State Jeremiah S. Black and Mary (Forward) Black, and the grandson of Representative Henry Black and Mary (Sullivan) Black. His maternal grandfather was Representative Chauncey Forward. He married Mary Clarke Dawson and they had four children.\nBlack was educated at Hiram College, where he met and developed a close personal friendship with future president James Garfield. He later attended Washington & Jefferson College. Black entered the field of journalism, where he wrote primarily for The New York Sun. Black was also an author best known for ghostwriting a biography of Abraham Lincoln for his bodyguard Ward Hill Lamon titled The Life of Abraham Lincoln; from his Birth to his Inauguration as President published in 1872.[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jala/28.2/hoffmann.html John Hoffmann | Review Essay | Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association, 28.2 | The History Cooperative]  at www.historycooperative.org Because of his reformist zeal, Black was chosen to run on the ticket of Robert E.

He served as Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania from 1883 to 1887 and ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1886.\nChauncey Forward Black died in York, Pennsylvania, on December 2, 1904, at the age of 65.
