The award is generally given to the album's producers, principal vocalist(s), and the composer and lyricist if they have written a new score which comprises 51% or more playing time of the album, though the number of recipients has varied over the category's tenure.\nThe inaugural award was presented at the 1st Grammy Awards to composer Meredith Willson for his work on his 1957 musical The Music Man. Ethel Merman and Gwen Verdon became the first female recipients the in 1960 when they tied for Gypsy and Redhead. Stephen Sondheim and Thomas Z. Shepard hold the record for most nominations in the category, with 25, while Sondheim and Shepard are tied for the record for most wins, with six. Tommy Krasker holds the record for most nominations without a win, with twelve. Micki Grant became the first African-American woman to win this award for ''Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope (1973). To date, two-time recipient Phillipa Soo is the only woman to win more than one award (for Hamilton and Into the Woods).\nAmong shows, cast recordings from Gypsy have been nominated five times and cast recordings of West Side Story, Into the Woods, and Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street have been nominated four times, with Gypsy, West Side Story, Into the Woods, and Les Misérables are the only shows to win twice. Anything Goes, Hello, Dolly!, The King and I, and My Fair Lady hold the record for most nominations without a win, with three. The current recipient of the award is Hell's Kitchen, which won at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards in 2025.\nProcess\nOver the years, the qualifications for the individual nominees has fluctuated with principal artists, composers, and producers at one point being the sole eligible nominee, to the current (as of the 66th Grammy Awards) standard which is as follows: \"For albums containing greater than 51% playing time of new recordings. Award to the principal vocalist(s), and the album producer(s) of 50% or more playing time of the album. The lyricist(s) and composer(s) of 50 % or more of a score of a new recording are eligible for an Award if any previous recording of said score has not been nominated in this category.\"\nVocalists were first awarded in this category at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards in 2012. When an album does not feature any individual soloists and predominantly features an ensemble cast, no individual award is given to the members of the ensemble, with each member instead receiving a winners certificate. As of the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, only a maximum of four principal vocalists can be awarded (previously unlimited), in addition to the producer/s and lyricists/composers. The maximum number of eligible principal vocalist(s) was increased to six beginning at the 68th Annual Grammy Awards.\nYears reflect the year in which the Grammy Awards were handed out, for music released in the previous year.\nName changes\nThis award has had several minor name changes:\n*In 1959 the award was known as Best Original Cast Album (Broadway or TV)\n*In 1960 it was awarded as Best Broadway Show Album\n*In 1961 it was awarded as Best Show Album (Original Cast)\n*From 1962 to 1963 it was awarded as Best Original Cast Show Album\n*From 1964 to 1973 it was awarded as Best Score From an Original Cast Show Album\n*From 1974 to 1975 it was awarded as Best Score From the Original Cast Show Album\n*From 1976 to 1986 it was awarded as Best Cast Show Album\n*From 1987 to 1991 it was awarded as Best Musical Cast Show Album\n*From 1992 to 2011 it was awarded as Best Musical Show Album\n*From 2012 it has been known as Best Musical Theater Album.\nWinners and nominees\nwon for The Music Man (1959).]]\nwon for Gypsy.]]\nwon twice for The Sound of Music (1961) and No Strings (1963).]]\nwon for The Sound of Music in 1961.]]\nwon for How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (1962).]]\nwon for Funny Girl (1965).]]\nwon for On a Clear Day You Can See Forever (1966).]]\nwon for Mame (1967).]]\nwon for Cabaret (1968).]]\nwon for Promises, Promises (1970)]]\nwon six times for Company (1971), A Little Night Music (1974), Sweeney Todd (1980), Sunday in the Park with George (1985), Into the Woods (1989), and Passion (1995)]]\nwon twice for Godspell (1972) and Wicked (2005)]]\nwon for Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope (1973), becoming the first African-American woman to win this award.]]\nwon for Annie (1978).]]\nreceived awards in 1981 and 1984 for his hit shows Evita and Cats, respectively.]]\nwon the award in 1982.]]\nwon for Les Misérables (1988)]]\nwon with his writing partner Betty Comden for The Will Rogers Follies (1992)]]\nwon for The Who's Tommy (1994).]]\nwinner Sir Elton John won for Aida (2001).]]\nwon with Sir Elton for Aida (2001).]]\nwon for The Producers (2002).]]\nwon for Spamalot (2006).]]\nwon twice for Hairspray (2003) and Some Like It Hot (2024).]]\nwon thrice for In the Heights (2009), Hamilton (2016) and Dear Evan Hansen (2018).]]\nwon twice for American Idiot (2011).]]\nwon for The Book of Mormon (2012).]]\nwon for The Book of Mormon (2012).]]\nwon as a vocalist for Once (2013).]]\nwon as a vocalist for Kinky Boots (2014)]]\nwon for her show Kinky Boots (2014).]]\nwon twice for In the Heights (2010) and Hamilton (2016).]]\nwon as a vocalist for Hamilton (2016).]]\nwon for Hamilton (2016), and Into the Woods (2023).]]\nwon as a vocalist for Hamilton (2016).]]\nwon as a vocalist for Hamilton (2016).]]\nwon as a vocalist for Hamilton (2016).]]\nwon as a vocalist in The Color Purple (2017).]]\nwon as a vocalist in The Color Purple (2017).]]\nwon as a vocalist for The Color Purple (2017).]]\nwon for Dear Evan Hansen (2018)]]\nas a vocalist for Dear Evan Hansen (2018).]]\nwon as a vocalist for Dear Evan Hansen (2018).]]\nwon as a vocalist for The Band's Visit (2019).]]\nwon as a vocalist for Hadestown (2020).]]\nand Patrick Page won as vocalists for Hadestown (2020).]]\nwon in 2020 for her musical Hadestown.]]\nwon for her musical Jagged Little Pill (2021).]]\nwon as vocalist in Into the Woods (2023).]]\nwon as a vocalist for Into the Woods (2022).]]\nwon as a vocalist for Hell's Kitchen (2025).]]\n1950s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:1.00em; line-height:1.5em;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n!
