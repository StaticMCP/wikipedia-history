Kinghorn, was an Australian naturalist, a longtime curator at the Australian Museum, and a noted lecturer and broadcaster.\nEarly years\nRoy Kinghorn was born in Richmond, New South Wales, the youngest of three children of Rev. James Kinghorn (1861–1912) and his wife (Bertha) Ethel, née Campbell (ca.1866–1942). He was educated at Ellengowan School, Bathurst, All Saints' College, Bathurst and the Sydney Church of England Grammar School.\nIn 1907 he was accepted as a cadet at the Australian Museum, Sydney, specialising in crustaceans. He attended lectures at Sydney University and studied part-time at Sydney Technical College, but after failing an examination at the College, was transferred to a clerical position at the Museum.\nWartime and later career\nKinghorn enlisted with the AIF in June 1915 and served during World War I in Egypt and Lemnos with the Dental Corps and with the Field Artillery Brigade, mostly as a driver, but after receiving a severe knee injury in December 1917 was repatriated to Australia, and was discharged as permanently medically unfit in July 1918. He was to serve as recruiting officer for the 2nd AIF during the Second World War.\nHe returned to the Australian Museum in 1918 and was appointed zoologist in charge of reptiles and amphibians; three years later birds were added to his portfolio.\nHe was appointed Assistant Director of the Australian Museum around 1951 and retired in 1956.\nLecturer and broadcaster\nKinghorn was a popular and prolific lecturer on zoological subjects, beginning around 1924.\nHis interest in broadcasting began around the same time, with talks and stories on the Children's Hour on Farmer's Radio Service (later 2FC). Among his last media appearances was (as \"Linnaeus\" the naturalist) in a weekly spot during the last decade of ABC radio's Argonauts' Club.\nHe was a regular on Captain Fortune Show, a pioneering TV series of the 1950s and the \"Spying on Nature\" segment of \"Wednesday Wonderbox\" children's show on ABC-TV (which also featured Mr. Squiggle) in the 1960s.\nFamily life\nKinghorn married Winifred Mance (died 1977) on 12 November 1921.
