A two-episode preview aired on Cartoon Network in the United States on August 24, 2009; it was shown on Cartoon Network India starting on April 30, 2010 and on Cartoon Network Philippines from July 3, 2010. The series made its official debut on August 29, 2009. According to a HotWheels.com page as of July 14, 2010 describing \"BATTLE FORCE 5 Battle Action Assortment\" toys, vehicles combine forces to create even more powerful combat machines. The second season began airing September 18, 2010.\nWhile the series does not follow nor ever reference the events from the World Race or AcceleRacers franchises (with the exception of the character, Vert Wheeler, who appeared in both of the franchises), the series has no continuity with the toy line.\nThe first trailer for the series was released on the official Hot Wheels Battle Force 5 website on June 25, 2009. The first two episodes aired on Monday, August 24. This is the fourth series to be produced by Nerd Corps Entertainment (after League of Super Evil, Storm Hawks and Dragon Booster). 52 episodes and a 46-minute film were made.\nPlot\nOne day driving out in the Salt Flats, expert driver Vert Wheeler comes across a dimension called a Battle Zone where he meets a life form called a Sentient whose name is Sage. Together, they assemble a racing team equipped with state-of-the-art weaponized vehicles to compete against the robotic Sark and the animal-like Vandals in the Battle Zones for the devices that control the zones called Battle Keys to determine the fate of planet Earth.\nBattle Force 5 lives on the planet Earth at Vert's garage/race circuit at a town called Handler's Corners. When Tornado-like portals called Storm Shocks appear, they provide access to dimensions in the Multiverse called Battle Zones. All Battle Zones have a Battle Key that allows access to the home world of the ones who accessed the Zone through Storm Shocks. This obligates Battle Force 5 to secure the Keys before the Vandals or the Sark in prevention of the Vandals looting Earth and the Sark taking over Earth.\nThe Battle Zones were created by the Sentients. There are two types of Sentients: Blue and Red. The two types lived on two separate Homeworlds as rivals, until the blue homeworld was taken over by the Vandals. Throughout the story, Battle Force 5 encounter situations that make them access the Vandal, Sark, and Sentient homeworlds.\nAt the end of the second season, the Sentient war ends, and Krytus and his team are banished. The Blue and Red Sentients are united once again. However, Rawkus informs Battle Force 5 that the Ancient Ones have awakened.\nBattle Force 5 has to challenge this new threat as well as the Alpha Code, of which Zemerik is under the influence, in the feature film \"Total Revolution\". The Ancient Ones are revealed to be called Karmordials who created the Sentients and were banished to the Primordiverse. They use a Shadow Matter bomb to get back, but Battle Force 5 eventually stops them. To conclude the series, with the Multiverse at peace, Vert, the rest of the team, and his dad are able to return to Earth without any looming threats.\nEpisodes\nSeries overview\n| end1       =\n| color2     = #FF5F5F\n| link2      = #Season 2: Fused (2010–11)\n| episodes2  = 26\n| start2     =\n| end2       =\n}}\nSeason 1 (2009–10)\n[https://archive.org/details/support_crtc_gc_ca15052016 Alt URL] |prodcode= |episodes=\n|AltDate=\n|ShortSummary= While driving in the Salt Flats, Vert Wheeler is drawn by a freak storm into an inter-dimensional Battle Zone.
