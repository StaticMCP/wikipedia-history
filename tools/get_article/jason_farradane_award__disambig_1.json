After working in research at the Ministry of Supply and the Admiralty during World War II, he first made an impact with a paper on the scientific approach to documentation at a Royal Society Scientific Information Conference in 1948.\nHe was instrumental in establishing the Institute of Information Scientists in 1958 and the first academic courses in information science in 1963 at what eventually became City University, London and where he became Director of the Centre for Information Science in 1966. Of Central European origin, his commitment to science was reflected in the surname he created for himself – a combination of Faraday and Haldane, two scientists he particularly admired. On the research side his main contributions lay in relational analysis, a precursor to work in the area of artificial intelligence, and the concept of information.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.cilip.org.uk/members/group_content_view.asp?group=201314&id=692092 UKeiG Awards and Bursaries]"
