King, was a British occult writer and editor from London who wrote about tarot, divination, witchcraft, magic, sex magic, tantra, and holistic medicine. He was a member of the Society of the Inner Light, an offshoot of the Alpha et Omega, which in turn was an offshoot of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.\nControversy\nKing's 1973 publication of The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O. infuriated their order head Grady McMurtry, because the fraternity's secrets were being revealed in 1820.  In an O.T.O newsletter, McMurtry stated their policy at the time: \"We do not endorse the publication of this material because the so called 9th degree section does not include the paper (titled IX degree Emblems and Modes of Use) which Aleister Crowley handed me at 93 Jermyn St circa 1943-44 e.v. without which the whole thing is nonsense.\"  Francis King is thought to have been given the rest of the rituals (sans the missing one) by Gerald Yorke.\nSelected publications\n* Ritual Magic in England (1887 to the Present Day) (1970) (see also 1989)\n** The Rites of Modern Occult Magic (American edition, 1971)\n* Sexuality, Magic and Perversion (1971)\n* Astral Projection, Ritual Magic and Alchemy (1972)\n* The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.
