It peaked at number 18 on record charts in the USA, number 50 in the UK, and number 7 in Australia. The back cover includes this declaration: \"We the People, have declared War against the People, for the right to love each other\". The album received a gold record award.\nIn 1981, LA Records (producer Jerry Goldstein's own label) reissued the album under the title Spill the Wine.  It has also been reissued under its original title on CD by Avenue / Rhino Records.\nCover art\nThe cover, credited to The Visual Thing (with Burdon credited for the concept), depicts two disembodied but joined arms, one white and one black, both giving a three finger salute, similar to the peace sign which uses two fingers. The three fingers may represent the letter \"w\" in the word \"war\". This salute was also used on the cover of a future album, War. The use of a background sun also appears as a recurring theme on both front and back covers of ''The Black-Man's Burdon and the inner sleeve of Deliver the Word''.\nTrack listing\nAll tracks written by War (Papa Dee Allen, Harold Brown, Eric Burdon, B.B. Dickerson, Lonnie Jordan, Charles Miller, Lee Oskar, Howard E. Scott) except where noted.  Note: Memphis Slim composed music under the name of Peter Chatman which was actually his father's name; on the original album the composer credit is misprinted as \"P. Chapman\".\nSide one\n# \"The Vision of Rassan\" – 7:40\n##\"Dedication\" – 2:33\n##\"Roll on Kirk\" – 5:07\n#\"Tobacco Road\" – 14:24\n##\"Tobacco Road\" (John D.
