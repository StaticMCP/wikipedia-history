Nominations were announced on February 24, 2016. This ceremony featured several major changes on the television side, with all \"Best Television Series\" categories being replaced by new ones, with the exception of Best Superhero Adaptation Television Series.\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens became the most nominated film in Saturn Award history,}} with nominations in all 13 categories it was eligible for (except Best Performance by a Younger Actor). With double nominations for both Best Actor (John Boyega and Harrison Ford) and Best Supporting Actress (Carrie Fisher and Lupita Nyong'o), The Force Awakens received a total of fifteen nominations, followed by Mad Max: Fury Road with ten (including a nomination in a \"Home Entertainment\" category) and Crimson Peak with nine. The Walking Dead led the nominations for television for the second year in a row with seven, including triple nominations for Best Supporting Actress on Television (Tovah Feldshuh, Danai Gurira, and Melissa McBride); Game of Thrones and Hannibal followed with five nominations each.\nFor film, Star Wars: The Force Awakens won the most awards with eight, including Best Science Fiction Film, Best Actor for Harrison Ford, and John Williams' eighth win for Best Music, with Crimson Peak being the only other film to score multiple wins with three, including Best Horror Film. For television, The Walking Dead won the most awards for the second year in a row with three wins, including the inaugural Best Horror Television Series and Chandler Riggs becoming the first individual to win Best Performance by a Younger Actor on Television twice; Hannibal and Outlander followed with two wins each.\nAdditionally, eight individuals earned double nominations: J. J. Abrams, Guillermo del Toro, Alex Garland, George Miller, and Colin Trevorrow were all nominated for both Best Director and Best Writing, with only Abrams winning for writing, while Neal Scanlan received nominations for both Best Make-up and Best Special Effects for The Force Awakens, winning both. Lastly, both Gillian Anderson and Jessica Chastain were the only acting nominees to receive two nominations for different works, with only the latter winning one: Best Supporting Actress for Crimson Peak.\nOverview\nFilm\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens won eight awards, tying The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) as the second most award-winning film at the Saturn Awards, behind Avatar (2009), which won ten awards at the 36th Saturn Awards in 2010. The Force Awakens wins were for Best Science Fiction Film, Best Actor for Harrison Ford, Best Supporting Actor for Adam Driver, Best Writing (Lawrence Kasdan, J. J. Abrams, and Michael Arndt), Best Editing, Best Make-up, Best Music, and Best Special Effects.\nThis was only the second time a trio won Best Writing: Kasdan had already won the award for Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and had received nominations for two other Star Wars films: The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). It was also the first win in the category for both Abrams and Arndt, who had both been nominated once before; Abrams had also won Best Director four years earlier for Super 8 (2011) and would go on to win five years later for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019). Ford had previously won Best Actor for Raiders and had already been nominated for playing his Star Wars character, Han Solo, at the 5th Saturn Awards in 1978.\nCrimson Peak was the only other film to secure multiple wins: Best Horror Film, Best Supporting Actress for Jessica Chastain, and Best Production Design. This was Chastain's first win and fifth nomination, including her Best Actress nomination the same year for The Martian.\nEleven features won a single award: Ant-Man, Bridge of Spies, Cinderella, Furious 7, Inside Out, Room, and Turbo Kid won the other \"Best Film\" categories. Furthermore, The Martian won Best Director (Ridley Scott's first win since Alien at the 7th Saturn Awards in 1980), Mad Max: Fury Road won Best Actress for Charlize Theron (her first win and fifth nomination), Jurassic World won Best Performance by a Younger Actor for Ty Simpkins, and Avengers: Age of Ultron won Best Costume Design (Alexandra Byrne's second win).\nTelevision\nThis year, the Saturn Awards introduced several new \"Best Television Series\" categories, replacing older ones: the fourth and final season of Continuum won the inaugural Best Science Fiction Television Series, winning its first and only Saturn Award after ten nominations overall. The second half of Outlanders first season (the first half having been aired the previous year) won the inaugural Best Fantasy Television Series, with its lead actress Caitríona Balfe winning Best Actress on Television for the second year in a row; Balfe would go on to win a third in 2021.\nThe Walking Dead, which had won the \"Best Television Series\" award it was nominated for all of its previous seasons (Best Television Presentation in 2011 and 2012, and Best Syndicated/Cable Television Series in 2013, 2014, and 2015), continued its long winning streak by winning the inaugural Best Horror Television Series. The series also won Best Supporting Actress in Television for Danai Gurira, while Chandler Riggs became the first performer to win Best Performance by a Younger Actor on Television twice; Riggs would go on to win a third in 2018, surpassing his own record. Hannibal concluded its own winning streak by winning Best Action / Thriller Television Series for its third and final season, after winning Best Network Television Series in 2014 and 2015. Its guest star Richard Armitage won Best Supporting Actor on Television, a year after winning Best Supporting Actor in a Film for The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies.\nThe Flash won Best Superhero Adaptation Television Series, its second win in the same category, after winning the inaugural award the previous year, while Daredevil won the inaugural Best New Media Television Series.\nOther award-winning programs were Haven winning Best Guest Starring Role on Television for William Shatner (his second win after Best Actor in a Film for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan at the 10th Saturn Awards in 1983), and Doctor Who, which won Best Television Presentation for its Christmas special \"The Husbands of River Song\". Although it is the first win in the category for the series itself, the eponymous 1996 film, which is a part of a common chronology, had won as well. Lastly, Ash vs Evil Dead won Best Actor on Television for Bruce Campbell, making it the third installment of the Evil Dead franchise to win a Saturn Award after The Evil Dead (1981) and Army of Darkness (1992).\nWinners and nominees\nFilm\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Science Fiction Film\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Fantasy Film\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Star Wars: The Force Awakens\n** Ex Machina\n** Jurassic World\n** Mad Max: Fury Road\n** The Martian\n** Terminator Genisys\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Cinderella\n** The Age of Adaline\n** Baahubali: The Beginning\n** Goosebumps\n** The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2\n** Ted 2\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Horror Film\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Thriller Film\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Crimson Peak\n** Insidious: Chapter 3\n** It Follows\n** Krampus\n** The Visit\n** What We Do in the Shadows\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Bridge of Spies\n** Black Mass\n** The Gift\n** The Hateful Eight\n** Mr. Holmes\n** Sicario\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Action / Adventure Film\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best International Film\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Furious 7\n** Everest\n** Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation\n** The Revenant\n** Spectre\n** Spy\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Turbo Kid\n** Goodnight Mommy\n** The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared\n** Labyrinth of Lies\n** Legend\n** The Wave\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Comic-to-Film Motion Picture\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Animated Film\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Ant-Man\n** Attack on Titan – Part 1\n** Avengers: Age of Ultron\n** Kingsman: The Secret Service\n** The Peanuts Movie\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Inside Out\n** Anomalisa\n** The Good Dinosaur\n** Kung Fu Panda 3\n** Minions\n** When Marnie Was There\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Director\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Writing\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Ridley Scott – The Martian'\n** J.
