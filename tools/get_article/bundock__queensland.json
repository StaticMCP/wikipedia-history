The town is within the locality of Maxwelton.\nGeography\nThe town is just south of O'Connell Creek. Bundock was (and still is) at the midpoint of a stock route between the towns of Maxwelton and Richmond.\nThere are 10 half-acre town lots, but there are no buildings nor signs of any development.\nHistory\nThe town was surveyed by Frank A. Gorringe on 14 December 1899 and gazetted as a town on 10 February 1900.\nBundock is named after horse breeder Wellington Cochrane Bundock (1812–1898).  In 1863, Bundock formed a partnership with Walter Hayes to graze cattle on the Richmond Downs pastoral run (the origin of the town of Richmond).\nReferences"
