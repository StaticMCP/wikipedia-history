It was worn against Fremantle at their home Indigenous round match on 1 June 2014. Stewart was one of the 18 players recognised.\nAt the conclusion of the 1961 Grand Final, the players from opposing sides swapped jumpers. Stewart traded jumpers with his opposing wingman, Hawthorn's John Fisher. In 2012, Stewart was cleaning out his house and found Fisher's old jumper in a box. He donated the guernsey to the Hawthorn Football Club museum who said it was a \"wonderful gesture\" and described the jumper as being \"in mint condition\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
