The team was owned by OverActive Media, based in Montreal, Quebec, and played in the North America region of OWC.\nFranchise history\nOn February 14, 2019, OverActive Media, in partnership with esports team Mirage Sport Électronique, formally announced Toronto Defiant's academy team as \"Montreal Rebellion\". They began in Overwatch Contenders North America East and revealed their 2019 Season 1 roster, led by head coach Chris \"Dream\" Myrick.\nIn their first season of play, Rebellion finished 2–5 in the regular season and claimed the final playoff spot by finishing in sixth place. They defeated third-seeded Second Wind 3–1 in the quarterfinals before losing to two-seed and eventual champions Fusion University (Philadelphia Fusion's academy team). After the season, the team mutually parted ways with head coach Dream and announced May \"Optidox\" Sims, who had led Angry Titans to the 2019 Season 1 EU championship, as the new head coach.\nPrior to 2019 Season 2, Montreal Rebellion was moved to the North America West region. Part way through the season, Optidox left the team to become an assistant coach (and subsequently interim co-head coach) for the Toronto Defiant. Jesse \"Jsr\" Rangi was subsequently named head coach and finished out the season with the Rebellion. They finished in fifth place with a 4–3 record, though they were defeated by Second Wind, 3–1, in a quarterfinals rematch from the previous season.\nAfter two weeks of the 2020 season, Rebellion quietly disbanded without an official announcement, reportedly due to budget cuts amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSeasons overview\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Season\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Region\n! colspan=\"4\" | OWC regular season\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Regional playoffs\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Interregional events\n|-\n!
