      "text": "# List of SDN controller software\n\nSoftware-defined networking (SDN) is a marketing term which refers to software to configure and operate computer networks (especially data center networks) through a centralized software controller that dictates how the network behaves. The core of this new paradigm is the SDN controller.\nThere are typically two sets of SDN controllers:\n* SDN controllers for the network function virtualization (NFV) of a datacenter,\n* SDN controllers for managing the programmable switches of a network.\nIn case of SDN controllers for the NFV Infrastructure of a datacenter, they are mostly designed to provide some policy and centralized managements for the Openstack Neutron networking layer that will provide inter-working between the virtual ports created by Nova. The  technology of SDN controllers is to manage the Linux kernel features made of L3 IP routing, Linux bridges, iptables or ebtables, network namespaces and Open vSwitch.\nOpen and community-driven initiatives\nSome promotional links to be removed:\n* [https://openflow.stanford.edu/display/Beacon/Home Beacon]\n* [https://github.com/REANNZ/faucet Faucet]\n* [https://github.com/PANTHEONtech/lighty-core lighty-core]\n* [https://github.com/superkkt/cherry/ Cherry]\n* [http://www.noxrepo.org/ NOX/POX]\n* ONOS\n* Open vSwitch\n* OpenDaylight (controller baseline project, upon which many other controllers are built)\n* [https://github.com/telstra/open-kilda/ OpenKilda]\n* [https://github.com/projectcalico/calico Project Calico]\n* [https://floodlight.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HOME/overview?mode=global Floodlight]\n* [https://github.com/ARCCN/runos/ RUNOS]\n* [https://ryu-sdn.org/ Ryu Controller]\n* [https://fd.io/ The Fast Data Project]\n* [https://github.com/vneio/sdnc vneio/sdnc]\nVendor Specific Initiatives\n*[http://lighty.io/ lighty.io] by PANTHEON.tech\n* [https://www.nuagenetworks.net/platform/virtualized-services-platform/ Nuage Virtualized Services Controller (VSC)] by Nokia\n* [https://selinc.com/products/5056/ SEL-5056] by Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories\n* [https://www.nxp.com/design/software/development-software/vortiqa-software-for-networking/software-defined-networking-sdn/vortiqa-open-network-director-software:VORTIQA_OND VortiQa Open Network Director] by Freescale Semiconductor\nReferences"
