Some hits are present (\"We Will Rock You\", \"I Want It All\" and \"Fat Bottomed Girls\"), while other tracks included were never released as singles anywhere (\"Put Out the Fire\", \"Tear It Up\" and \"Sheer Heart Attack\").\nThe album also contains a remake of \"I Can't Live With You\", with a much louder and heavier guitar and more aggressive drumming, and one new track, \"No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)\", which is a gentle ballad. The latter began life as a track for Brian May's solo album Another World (1998); the remaining members chose to record it as a bookend for their career as Queen. It was the last original studio recording from the 1990s featuring Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon and is among the few Queen songs not to feature lead singer Freddie Mercury (other examples include \"Good Company\" and \"Sleeping on the Sidewalk\").\nTrack listing\n| length7         = 2:14\n| title8          = Now I'm Here\n| extra8          = Sheer Heart Attack, 1974\n| length8         = 4:12\n| title9          = Fat Bottomed Girls\n| note9           = album version\n| extra9          = Jazz, 1978\n| length9         = 4:18\n| title10         = Keep Yourself Alive\n| extra10         = Queen, 1973\n| length10        = 3:44\n}}\n| length12        = 5:09\n| title13         = Sheer Heart Attack\n| extra13         = News of the World, 1977\n| writer13        = Taylor\n| length13        = 3:26\n| title14         = I'm in Love with My Car\n| note14          = hybrid album/single version\n| extra14         = A Night at the Opera, 1975\n| writer14        = Taylor\n| length14        = 3:05\n}}\nVideo version\nA video version of the album was made.
