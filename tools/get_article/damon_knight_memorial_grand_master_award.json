It was first awarded in 1975, to Robert Heinlein. In 2002, it was renamed after Damon Knight, the founder of SFWA, who had died that year.\nThe presentation is made at the annual SFWA Nebula Awards banquet, commonly during May, but it is not one of the Nebulas, which recognize the preceding calendar year's works and are selected by vote of all Association members. SFWA officers and past presidents alone submit Grand Master nominations and the final selection must be approved by a majority of that group. The recipient is announced in advance, commonly during the preceding calendar year.\nFrom 1995 to 2010, SFWA also gave some writers the title of Author Emeritus. In 2023, SFWA announced the creation of the Infinity Award, which posthumously honors creators who died before they could be considered for the Grand Master Award. The first recipient of the Infinity Award was Octavia E. Butler.\nHistory\nThe first Grand Master, Robert Heinlein, was named in 1975. The Grand Master Award was originally limited to six recipients per decade; six were presented in the ten years to 1984 and twelve in the twenty years to 1994. From 1995, the award has been conferred annually, with the exception of 2002 and 2011. Andre Norton was the first woman to receive the award, in 1984. As of 2025, N.K. Jemisin is the youngest person to have received the award; she was aged 53.\nFrom 1995 to 2010, SFWA also awarded the title of Author Emeritus \"as a way to recognize and appreciate senior writers in the genres of science fiction and fantasy who have made significant contributions to our field but who are no longer active or whose excellent work may no longer be as widely known as it once was.\" Recipients were invited to speak at the annual Nebula Awards banquet. Fourteen honorees were named in the sixteen years the award was given. As of 2024, there has been no overlap between Grand Masters and Authors Emeritus. The award's status as a consolation prize was a matter of controversy.\nGrand Masters\nAs of 2025, 42 Grand Masters have been created. The list below shows the year of the award ceremonies for each respective recipient. Awards are announced in advance of the ceremony, sometimes in the preceding year.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Recipient\n!Ref.\n|-\n!1975\n| (1907–1988)\n|\n|-\n!1976\n| (1908–2006)\n|\n|-\n!1977\n| (1904–1988)\n|\n|-\n!1978\n|—\n|\n|-\n!1979\n| (1907–2000)\n|\n|-\n!1980\n|—\n|\n|-\n!1981\n| (1910–1992)\n|\n|-\n!1982\n|—\n|\n|-\n!1983\n|—\n|\n|-\n!1984\n| (1912–2005)\n|\n|-\n!1985\n|—\n|\n|-\n!1986\n| (1917–2008)\n|\n|-\n!1987\n| (1920–1992)\n|\n|-\n!1988\n| (1913–1987)\n|\n|-\n!1989\n| (1920–2012)\n|\n|-\n!1990\n|—\n|\n|-\n!1991\n| (1915–1993)\n|\n|-\n!1992\n|—\n|\n|-\n!1993\n| (1919–2013)\n|\n|-\n!1994\n|—\n|\n|-\n!1995\n| (1922–2002)\n|\n|-\n!1996\n| (1912–2000)\n|\n|-\n!1997\n| (1916–2013)\n|\n|-\n!1998\n| (1926–2001)\n|\n|-\n!1999\n| (1922–2003)\n|\n|-\n!2000\n| (1925–2017)\n|\n|-\n!2001\n| (1918–2009)\n|\n|-\n!2002\n|—\n|\n|-\n!2003\n| (1929–2018)\n|\n|-\n!2004\n| (1935–)\n|\n|-\n!2005\n| (1926–2011)\n|\n|-\n!2006\n| (1934–2018)\n|\n|-\n!2007\n| (1923–2020)\n|\n|-\n!2008\n| (1939–)\n|\n|-\n!2009\n| (1925–2012)\n|\n|-\n!2010\n| (1943–)\n|\n|-\n!2011\n|—\n|\n|-\n!2012\n| (1945–)\n|\n|-\n!2013\n| (1931–2019)\n|\n|-\n!2014\n| (1942–)\n|\n|-\n!2015\n| (1938–)\n|\n|-\n!2016\n| (1942–)\n|\n|-\n!2017\n| (1939–)\n|\n|-\n!2018\n| (1939–)\n|\n|-\n!2019\n| (1948–)\n|\n|-\n!2020\n| (1949–)\n|\n|-\n!2021\n| (1960–)\n|\n|-\n!2022\n| (1950–)\n|\n|-\n!2023\n| (1952–)\n|\n|-\n!2024\n|Susan Cooper (1935–)\n|\n|-\n!2025\n|Nicola Griffith (1960–)\n|\n|-\n!2026\n|N.K.

SFWA President Jeffe Kennedy said, \"Over the years, so many creators have been passed over for the Grand Master nod, for one reason or another. Some died tragically early. Others were not recognized for their work during their lifetimes because of cultural prejudices and blind spots.\"\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Recipient\n!Ref.\n|-\n!2023\n| (1947–2006)\n|\n|-\n!2024\n| (1947–2015)\n|\n}}\nFurther reading\n* [http://www.sfwa.org/2009/12/joe-haldeman-named-damon-knight-memorial-grand-master/ \"Joe Haldeman named Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master\"] .
