      "text": "# Tony Award for Best Revival\n\nThe Tony Award for Best Revival was given to the best play, musical or non-musical, which had already appeared on Broadway in a previous production. It was presented from 1977, where it was called Most Innovative Production of a Revival and later Reproduction (Play or Musical) in 1980, until 1994, when it was split into the Best Revival of a Musical and the Best Revival of a Play.\nIf there are not enough revivals, it is possible under the current Tony rules for this category to return. Any time there are three play revivals and three musical revivals, the categories are automatically separated; if there are fewer, the Tony Awards Administration Committee may still choose to split up the categories.\nWinners and nominees\n1970s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\n|- style=\"background:#bebebe;\"\n! style=\"width:5%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| Production\n! style=\"width:75%;\"| Nominees\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\"|Best Revival\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\"| 1977\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE\"\n| Porgy and Bess\n| Produced by Sherwin M.
