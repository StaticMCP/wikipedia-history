The culture showed evidence of millet cultivation and pig domestication. The type site at Xinle was discovered in the Huanggu District of Shenyang, Liaoning.\nThe site is named after an old inn, upon whose grounds the remains were first discovered.\nNaming\nThe site of the ancient settlement was discovered in the grounds of an old accommodation block for an electrical factory. The accommodation block was called the Xinle Dormitory () and hence the discovery was named the Xinle Relic. When it was discovered that the settlement was that of a hitherto unknown civilization, the whole civilization was named after the relic and hence became known as the Xinle civilization. Although more recent discoveries in nearby areas have been extremely significant, especially one in Xinmin, the original name has prevailed.\nExcavations\nIn 1973, excavations at the site discovered evidence for some 40 neolithic houses. Artifacts uncovered during the dig included stone tools, pottery, jade, bone tools, wood carvings, and refined coal.\nIn 1978, another dig uncovered yet more artifacts including one wooden carving that was some 7,200 years old, presumably a type of totem worshipped by the clan. No other find in the whole of Shenyang has been older, and the find is one of the oldest wooden carvings found anywhere in the world.\nMuseum\nIn 1984, the Museum of the Xinle Civilization () was founded.\nThe museum is divided into two sections, north and south. The southern section contains displays of the various artifacts unearthed during the various excavations that have taken place on the  site. The northern section contains a reconstruction of a 7,000-year-old Xinle village. Some of the houses in the settlement contain representations of life 7,000 years ago.\nGallery\n{|\n|Main entrance\n|Statue advertising the museum\n|Statue outside museum gates\n|}\nSee also\n* List of Neolithic cultures of China\n* Hongshan culture\nNotes\nReferences\n* Stark, Miriam T.
