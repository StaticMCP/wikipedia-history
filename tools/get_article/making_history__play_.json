It focuses on the life and legacy of Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone, who led a combined Irish-Spanish alliance against the English during the Nine Years' War. The play is set before and after the Battle of Kinsale. The battle does not directly feature in the play, although it is central to the plot.\nThe play's other main theme is O'Neill's unexpected third marriage to the much younger Anglo-Irish Protestant Mabel Bagenal, daughter and sister of two of his most implacable enemies, which the play presents as a genuine though ill-fated love marriage.\nCharacters\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Character\n!Original production\n!Ref.\n|-\n|Hugh O'Neill\n|Stephen Rea\n|\n|-\n|Harry Hovenden\n|Niall O'Brien\n|\n|-\n|Hugh O'Donnell\n|Peter Gowen\n|\n|-\n|Archbishop Lombard\n|Niall Tóibín\n|\n|-\n|Mabel Bagenal\n|Clare Holman\n|\n|-\n|Mary Bagenal\n|Emma Dewhurst\n|\n|}\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
