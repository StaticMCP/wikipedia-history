      "text": "# Revolutionary Socialist Party (Sweden)\n\nRevolutionära Socialistiska Partiet (), a Swedish political party founded in 1945, as the Independent Labour Party (). It was founded by a group that had split from the Left Socialist Party (VSP), when VSP had developed in a pro-Western direction. Leaders included Evald Höglund and Gottfrid Nyberg.\nOAP published two issues of Vårt Ord.\nIn 1949, the group was reconstructed as Revolutionary Socialists (Revolutionära Socialister). RS became the first Swedish section of the Fourth International. The following year it changed name to RSP at a conference in Stockholm. The group gathered around a dozen persons.\nRSP was active in the 1950 municipal elections in Stockholm (where they received 1,900 votes) and during the dockers' strike of 1951. RSP published two issues of Internationalen.\nRSP was a short-lived party. Soon the leadership of FI ordered RSP to enter SAP and practice fraction politics, entryism, within this party. The members of RSP opposed this, and the organization was dissolved in 1953.\nSee also\n* Left Socialist Party (Sweden), Vänstersocialistiska partiet, 1940&ndash;1963)\n* National Socialist People's Party of Sweden\n* National Socialist Workers' Party (Sweden)\n* Socialist Party (Sweden, 1929), Socialistiska partiet, 1929&ndash;1944\n* Socialist Party (Sweden, 1971)\n* Socialist Workers' Party of Sweden\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.trotskij.se/content.php?article.cat.160 Articles on RSP at trotskij.se]"
