In the 1992 presidential election, Etibar Mammadov took back his candidacy, but three years later,  NIPA cleared the 8% barrier in 1995 parliamentary elections and thereby got represented in the supreme legislative body, despite all the obstacles set up by the more and more undemocratic government.\nIn the presidential election of 1998,Etibar Mammadov came second.
