As the PBA enters its 25th season, a New Era has come for the never-say-die team now known as Barangay Ginebra Kings.\nOccurrences\nAllan Caidic, who was assigned as player-assistant coach of Ginebra at the start of the season, began his role as playing-coach for the team starting the Governors Cup, replacing coach Rino Salazar. The Kings has yet to score a victory in five games when they decided to replace import Mario Donaldson in favor of Monty Lamont Wilson.\nNotable dates\nMarch 12: The Gin Kings stopped Alaska's winning run with a 97–87 victory and maintain their winning streak to three after losing their first four games in the season.\nMay 5: Barangay Ginebra defeated Sta.Lucia Realtors, 77–74, in their playoff game for the 8th and last entry to the quarterfinal round.\nMay 12: Point guard Bal David converted a buzzer-beating shot from an inbound with three seconds left as Barangay Ginebra Kings pulled a stunning 82–81 upset win over top-seeded Mobiline Phone Pals in the do-or-die quarterfinals match.
