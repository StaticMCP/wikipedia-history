The results of the May 1968 presidential elections had been annulled due to low voter turnout. The military government appointed Zinsou to the position on July 17, 1968, but he accepted only on the condition that a referendum regarding his appointment be held. His candidacy was supported by 76% of voters, with a 73% turnout.\nResults\nReferences"
