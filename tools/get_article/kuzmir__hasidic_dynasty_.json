His father was Tzvi Hersh.\nTaub was a student of the Chozeh of Lublin and the Kohznitzer Maggid and he established yeshivas and a type of Hasidic teaching that was similar to that of his rebbes.\nHe grew famous for his musical talents and composed many Hasidic melodies.\nHe died in Kuzmir on the 17th day of Shevat in 1856. Thousands of Jews, including Rabbi Shlomo Rabinowicz of Radomsk, Rabbi Nosson Dovid of Shidlovtza and Rabbi Yisroel Yitzchok of Radoshitz escorted the deceased to his burial.\nTaub's teachings are collected in Neḥmad mi-zahav (1909).\nGrand Rabbi Pinchas Moshe Taub\nRabbi Pinchas Moshe Taub is the second son of the fourth Modzhitzer Rebbe, Rabbi Yisrael Dan Taub, while his older brother, Rabbi Chaim Shaul Taub, is the fifth and current Modzhitzer Rebbe .\nIn 2020, Taub collapsed at his granddaughter's wedding in Bnei Brak. He was hospitalized in critical condition, but later recovered.\nYabloner Rebbes\nThe Yabloner Chasidus was started by a grandson of the first Kuzmirer Rebbe, Rabbi Yechezkel, and continued for three generations. The Yabloner lineage consisted of Rabbi Yosef Moshe Taub, Rabbi Yaakov Taub, and the final Rebbe leading up to the Holocaust, Rabbi Yechezkel Taub, named after the Kuzmir founding rebbe. The latter started moving the chasidus toward religious Zionism, and founded Kfar Hasidim. He became irreligious for about 40 years after the Holocaust mostly destroyed his following. He returned to Orthodox Judaism and to his role as Rebbe at Kfar Hasidim in the last few years of his life.\nSee also\n*History of the Jews in Poland\nReferences"
