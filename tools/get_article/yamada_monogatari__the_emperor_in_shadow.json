He is called back into public affairs by his patron Prince Kanemore to escort Princess Tagako back to the capital from her sinecure as head of a provincial temple. Secretly, he is also tasked with protecting her from supernatural threats aimed at destabilizing the regime of the new emperor, Sanjō.\nYamada and Kenji have their work cut out for them as the attempts on the princess's life escalate with every effort to trace the source of the plot—and Prince Kanemore has mysteriously disappeared.\nNotes"
