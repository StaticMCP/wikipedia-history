The Illinois primary was an open primary, with the state awarding 190 delegates to the 2000 Democratic National Convention, of which 161 were pledged delegates allocated on the basis of the results of the primary.\nVice president Al Gore was the winner of the Illinois primary. Gore was victorious in all counties winning almost 85% of the vote and 149 delegates, while senator Bill Bradley received the rest of 14% and 12 delegates. Together with his previous victories on Mini Tuesday in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas, Gore greatly expanded the gap in delegates between him and Bradley.\nProcedure\nIllinois was the only state which held primaries on March 21, 2000, the week following Mini Tuesday, which included contests in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas.\nVoting took place throughout the state from 6:00&nbsp;a.m. until 7:00&nbsp;p.m. In the open primary, candidates had to meet a threshold of 15 percent at the congressional district or statewide level in order to be considered viable. The 161 pledged delegates to the 2020 Democratic National Convention were allocated proportionally on the basis of the results of the primary. Of these, between 4 and 8 were allocated to each of the state's 20 congressional districts and another 21 were allocated to party leaders and elected officials (PLEO delegates), in addition to 35 at-large delegates.\nThe national convention delegation meeting was held to vote on the 34 at-large and 20 pledged PLEO delegates for the Democratic National Convention through a quorum of district delegates. The delegation also included 26 unpledged PLEO delegates: 14 members of the Democratic National Committee, 11 members of Congress (1 senator, Dick Durbin, and 10 representatives, Bobby Rush, Jesse Jackson, Jr., Bill Lipinski, Luis Gutiérrez, Rod Blagojevich, Danny Davis, Jan Schakowsky, Jerry Costello, Lane Evans, and David Phelps), 1 distinguished party leader, and 3 add-ons.\nCandidates\nThe following candidates appeared on the ballot:\n*Al Gore\n*Lyndon LaRouche, Jr.\nWithdrawn\n*Bill Bradley\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2;margin-bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:0.2em 0.4em;\" | 2000 Illinois Democratic presidential primary\n!
