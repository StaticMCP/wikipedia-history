Although some of the tracks recall the songwriting on Sur la Mer, the failure of Keys of the Kingdom to produce any major hit singles would mark the beginning of the Moodies' decline in popularity with mainstream audiences after their success in the MTV video generation.\nThe album saw the band beginning to return to a more airy rock oriented sound (similar to The Present), rather than the previous two albums' forays into synthesiser pop.  Flautist Ray Thomas plays more of a substantial role on this record, with his first ambient flute piece in eight years. It was recorded and mixed at four London studios: Olympic Studios, RG Jones Recording Studios, Mayfair Studios and The Hit Factory (not to be confused with the NYC-based studio of the same name). Drum machines are still used heavily; Graeme Edge only performs on three songs, with session drummer Andy Duncan providing live drums on two more, and the rest being programmed.\nKeyboardist Patrick Moraz was fired from the band after completing only a few tracks for this album, and he is listed as an 'additional' keyboard player.  After a lawsuit (broadcast by Court TV) filed by Moraz, their future album and re-release booklets would distance themselves from Moraz – e.g. removing him from photographs that originally featured him - and they never had any future keyboardists become official members of the band.\nThis was the last Moody Blues album before their extravagant concert at Red Rocks and a series of symphonic tours with orchestras.\nOriginal track listing\nSide one\n#\"Say It with Love\" (Justin Hayward) – 3:57\n#\"Bless the Wings (That Bring You Back)\" (Hayward) – 5:10\n#\"Is This Heaven?\" (Hayward, John Lodge) – 4:04\n#\"Say What You Mean (Parts 1 & 2)\" (Hayward) – 5:31\n#\"Lean on Me (Tonight)\" (Lodge) – 4:58\nSide two\n#\"Hope and Pray\" (Hayward) – 5:03\n#\"Shadows on the Wall\" (Lodge) – 5:07\n#\"Once is Enough\" (Hayward, Lodge) (Not put on vinyl LP (Europe only) or cassette, but included on CD format and 7-inch single) – 4:03\n#\"Celtic Sonant\" (Ray Thomas) – 5:02\n#\"Magic\" (Lodge) – 5:11\n#\"Never Blame the Rainbows for the Rain\" (Hayward, Thomas) – 4:57\nPersonnel\n*Justin Hayward – vocals, guitars\n*John Lodge – vocals, bass guitar\n*Ray Thomas – vocals, flute\n*Graeme Edge – drums on \"Bless the Wings\", \"Shadows on the Wall\" and \"Once Is Enough\"; percussion\nAdditional personnel\n*Patrick Moraz – keyboards on \"Say What You Mean\", \"Celtic Sonant\" and \"Magic\"\n*Bias Boshell – keyboards, drum machine\n*Paul Bliss – keyboards, drum machine\n*Andy Duncan – drums on \"Is This Heaven?\" and \"Magic\"\n*Nigel Hitchcock – alto saxophone\n*Jamie Talbot – tenor saxophone\n*Pete Beachill – trombone\n*Guy Barker – trumpet\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1991)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak position\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
