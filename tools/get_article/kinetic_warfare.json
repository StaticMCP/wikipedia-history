The term emerged as military jargon before it became used in wider circles at the turn of the millennium.\n\"Kinetic military action\" was used by White House aide Ben Rhodes on March 23, 2011 to describe U.S. military action in Libya:\nIn 2019, U.S. Department of Defense used \"kinetic operations\" on a webpage about Operation Inherent Resolve. It contained an interactive graphic titled \"AIRSTRIKES IN IRAQ AND SYRIA\" and captioned \"... operations related to ISIL since kinetic operations started on Aug. 8, 2014 ...\".\nOn February 11, 2015, President Obama wrote in a letter to Congress that he wanted Congress to \"authorize the use of U.S. forces [against ISIL] in ... [ground] missions to enable kinetic strikes\". The phrase was not used in the draft resolution proposed to Congress.\nOn December 2, 2015, Secretary of State John Kerry spoke after attending a series of NATO meetings in Brussels, “There are various ways in which countries can contribute; they don’t necessarily have to be troops, engaged in kinetic action. There are medical facilities, there are other assets that can be deployed, there is intelligence gathering.”\nOn February 13, 2024, the United States Government Accountability Office issued a report regarding the law of armed conflict in kinetic warfare, stating that \"Since 2012, AFRICOM and CENTCOM have conducted thousands of kinetic strikes. Such strikes must comply with the law of war.\"\nSecretary Donald Rumsfeld among others used the words \"kinetic\" and \"non-kinetic\" often.\nSee also\n* Three warfares\n* Hybrid warfare\nReferences"
