It was apparently founded by the monks of Préaux Abbey in Normandy after Henry de Newburgh, earl of Warwick, gave them his lands in Warmington in the reign  of Henry I of England. Whatever its initial status, by the 14th century it was a cell of Toft Monks Priory in Norfolk, which similarly belonged to Préaux Abbey. After the dissolution of the alien priories by Henry V it was granted in 1428 to the Carthusians of Witham Charterhouse in Somerset.\nReferences"
