The school was sponsored by the University of Chester Academies Trust.\nIn 2014, the schools minister Lord Nash sent a \"pre-warning letter\" to the trust, saying that \"he was concerned about how the trust could make improvements in the long-term\", and that \"the standards of performance at these three academies [the others being the University of Chester CE Academy and the University of Chester Academy Northwich] are unacceptably low\".\nIn 2015, due to ongoing concerns regarding UCATs sponsorship, low exam grade outcomes, and interim leadership and management, the Department for Education changed the sponsor of University Academy Liverpool to King's Leadership Academy in Warrington (now the Great Schools Trust) who appointed a new principal and leadership team. The school was then renamed King's Leadership Academy Liverpool.\nKing's Leadership Academy Liverpool offers GCSEs and BTECs as programmes of study for pupils, while students in the sixth form have the option to study from a range of A-levels, NVQs, City and Guilds qualifications and further BTECs.\n, the school's most recent inspection by Ofsted was in 2023; this was a short inspection which confirmed the previous 2018 judgement of Good.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.kingsliverpool.com/ King's Leadership Academy Liverpool official website]"
