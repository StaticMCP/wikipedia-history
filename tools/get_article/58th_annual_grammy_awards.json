The ceremony recognizes the best recordings, compositions and artists of the eligibility year, which was from October 1, 2014, to September 30, 2015. The \"pre-telecast\" ceremony, officially known as the Premiere Ceremony, in which the majority of awards were presented, was held at the nearby Microsoft Theater. It was the 16th Grammy ceremony to be held at the Staples Center, tying the Shrine Auditorium, also in Los Angeles, for hosting the most Grammy ceremonies. It also marks the latest date for a Grammy ceremony since 2003, which was held on February 23.\nUnlike previous years, where it was held on a Sunday, the 2016 edition was held on a Monday for the first time to take advantage of the U.S. Presidents' Day long weekend. The ceremony was televised in the United States by CBS; for the first time, CBS affiliates in the West Coast and United States territories outside the continental region, including Hawaii and Alaska, had the option of broadcasting the Grammys live from the East Coast feed, in addition to an encore in local primetime.\nNominations for the 58th Grammy Awards ceremony were announced on December 7, 2015, returning to the traditional format of an immediate press conference/release reveal of all nominees rather than the \"all-day event\" unveiling attempted by The Recording Academy and CBS over the previous few years. Kendrick Lamar received the most nominations with 11, and became the rapper with the most nominations in a single night, and second overall behind Michael Jackson (12 nominations in 1984). Taylor Swift and The Weeknd received seven nominations each. Producer Max Martin received the most nominations for a non-performing artist, with six. LL Cool J hosted for the fifth consecutive year. As part of a commercial break on the U.S. broadcast paid for by Target, Gwen Stefani also presented a live music video for her new single \"Make Me Like You\".\nKendrick Lamar led the winners with five trophies, including Best Rap Album for To Pimp a Butterfly. Taylor Swift won three awards, including Album of the Year for 1989, becoming the first female artist to win Album of the Year twice as main credited artist. Alabama Shakes also won three including Best Alternative Music Album for Sound & Color. Ed Sheeran won two including Song of the Year for \"Thinking Out Loud\". Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars' \"Uptown Funk\" won for  Record of the Year and Meghan Trainor won for Best New Artist.\nPerformers\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Artist(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Song(s)\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Taylor Swift\n| \"Out of the Woods\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Carrie UnderwoodSam Hunt\n| \"Take Your Time\"\"Heartbeat\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | The Weeknd\n|\"Can't Feel My Face\"\"In the Night\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Ellie GouldingAndra Day\n| \"Love Me like You Do\"\"Rise Up\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |John LegendDemi LovatoLuke BryanMeghan TrainorTyrese GibsonLionel Richie\n| Tribute to Lionel Richie\"Easy\"\"Hello\"\"Penny Lover\"\"You Are\"\"Brick House\"\"All Night Long (All Night)\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Little Big Town\n| \"Girl Crush\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Stevie WonderPentatonix\n| Tribute to Maurice White\"That's the Way of the World\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | EaglesBernie LeadonJackson Browne\n| Tribute to Glenn Frey\"Take It Easy\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Tori KellyJames Bay\n| \"Hollow\"\"Let It Go\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |  The cast of Hamilton\n| \"Alexander Hamilton\"(Live from the Richard Rodgers Theatre)\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |  Kendrick Lamar\n| \"The Blacker the Berry\"\"Alright\"\"King Kunta\" | \"untitled 05 09.21.2014.\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | MiguelGreg Phillinganes\n| Tribute to Michael Jackson\"She's Out of My Life\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Adele\n| \"All I Ask\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Justin BieberDiploSkrillex\n| \"Love Yourself\"\"Where Are Ü Now\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Lady GagaNile Rodgers\n| Tribute to David Bowie\"Space Oddity\"\"Changes\"\"Ziggy Stardust\"\"Suffragette City\"\"Rebel Rebel\"\"Fashion\"\"Fame\"\"Under Pressure\"\"Let's Dance\"\"Heroes\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Chris StapletonGary Clark Jr.Bonnie Raitt\n| Tribute to B.B.
