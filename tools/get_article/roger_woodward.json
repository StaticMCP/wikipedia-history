Most of his concerts reflected this belief even though such programming was considered unorthodox for the time. In recital, he often programmed traditional 18th and 19th century repertoire with new, little known, or neglected works such as those he championed by experimental fin de siècle Russian, Ukrainian and early Soviet composers (Alexander Scriabin, Alexander Mosolov, Nikolai Roslavets, Ivan Vyshnegradsky, Nikolai Obukhov, Aleksei Stanchinsky)., Lincoln Center NYC for world Premiere of Keqrops performed with Zubin Mehta and the NY Philharmonic Orchestra, 1986.|left]]Woodward worked with the New York, Los Angeles, Beijing, Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, the Cleveland Orchestra, the five London orchestras, the Hallé Orchestra, London Sinfonietta, London Mozart Players, London Brass, the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, Royal Danish Orchestra, L'orchestre National de Paris, the Gustav Mahler Jugendorchester, EEC Youth Orchestra and the Budapest and Prague Chamber Orchestras.\nNotable conductors with whom he worked include: Mehta, Abbado, Boulez,  Charles Dutoit, Lorin Maazel, Edo de Waart, Charles Mackerras, Simon Romanos, Kurt Masur, Paavo Berglund, Georg Tintner, Tan Lihua, Erich Leinsdorf, Walter Susskind, Georges Tzipine, Paul Terracini and Péter Eötvös.
