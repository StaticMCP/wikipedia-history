The company was founded in 2017 and is headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, United States. The software was initially developed at The Ohio State University’s Center for the Accelerated Maturation of Materials to quantify features in titanium micrographs.\nOriginally designed for metallurgical image analysis, MIPAR has since evolved into a comprehensive image-processing platform used across multiple disciplines, including materials science, biomedical research, agriculture, and manufacturing sectors such as aerospace, automotive, and medical devices. The software leverages computer vision and machine learning to automate complex image analysis tasks.\nFeatures\nMIPAR Software offers a comprehensive suite of image analysis tools designed to automate and enhance feature detection and measurement across various scientific and industrial applications. The key components and their functionalities include:\nImage Analysis Software\nMIPAR offers solutions for automating image processing, providing tools for feature detection and measurement across various scientific and industrial applications. Key products include:\nMIPAR Base – The core product of MIPAR, MIPAR Base, is utilized across sectors such as materials science, life sciences, and manufacturing to automate image analysis. It supports over 150 file formats and provides a dynamic toolkit for developing and executing automated workflows. Users can construct and implement image analysis algorithms, perform batch processing, and utilize real-time processing for immediate image handling. The software includes a batch review environment to confirm detection accuracy before measurement generation. It offers over 100 image processing functions and more than 30 distinct measurements, with the flexibility to customize measurement formulas. Data can be exported to CSV files or professional Word/PDF reports, and all image outputs are non-proprietary for easy sharing. The interface is user-friendly, requires no programming knowledge, and provides real-time feedback.\nDeep Learning Extension – This extension integrates advanced AI tools, enabling users to train convolutional neural network (CNN) models directly on their systems. The Model Trainer is designed to achieve high accuracy with minimal training data, sometimes requiring as few as four annotated images. Importantly, all data remains on the user's system, ensuring privacy and security. This extension is ideal for automating research projects' complex feature detection and segmentation tasks.\nSpotlight Extension – Spotlight incorporates transformer-based AI models into the analysis workflow, enhancing segmentation and classification capabilities. It enables the software to recognize a wide array of objects, even those it hasn't been specifically trained on, streamlining the detection process within MIPAR's ecosystem. This extension runs locally on the user's system to ensure data privacy and security.\n3D Toolbox – The 3D Toolbox provides tools for volumetric image analysis, allowing users to process and analyze three-dimensional datasets. This is particularly useful for applications requiring depth and volume measurements.\nReport Generator – This feature enables users to export analysis results in various formats, including CSV, Word, and PDF, facilitating easy documentation and sharing of findings.\nMicroscope Software\nMIPAR Live – Designed for digital optical microscopes, MIPAR Live allows users to capture images, perform analyses, and generate reports within a unified workflow. It offers seamless integration of image acquisition and analysis, ensuring consistent imaging conditions and preventing variability in analysis results. The software supports various microscope cameras and provides intuitive controls for image capture, analysis application, and result generation.\nRegulatory Environment Software\nMIPAR Checkpoint – Tailored for environments requiring compliance with regulatory standards such as FDA 21 CFR Part 11 and GMP Annex 11, MIPAR Checkpoint offers features including user access control, automated analysis reporting, electronic sign-off, and comprehensive audit trails. It streamlines the deployment of automated analysis in production settings, ensuring traceability and adherence to regulatory requirements.\nIntegration Tools\nMIPAR provides tools for integrating its software with external systems, including:\nDocker REST API – This tool facilitates cloud-based processing, enabling users to integrate MIPAR's image analysis capabilities into external applications or workflows, such as web-based applications or database plugins. It supports scalable image analysis operations, making it suitable for large-scale projects.\nPython API Library – The Python API allows for scripting and automation of image processing tasks, providing flexibility for researchers and developers to customize workflows and integrate MIPAR's functionalities into their existing systems.\nApplications\nMIPAR Image Analysis software provides a flexible toolkit and is used across many industries and research fields:\nMaterial Science\n* Titanium alloys\n* Superalloy\n* Steel\n* Other Materials\nLife Science\n* Agriculture\n* Water treatment\n* Wildlife\n* Biomedical Research\nManufacturing\n* Lithium-ion battery\n* Ceramics engineering\n* Energy\n* Welding\n* Semiconductor\n* Additive Manufacturing\n* Nanoparticle\n* Other\nSupported platforms\nMIPAR Software is compatible with:\nWindows 10 & 11 – Fully supported with GPU acceleration.\nmacOS (Intel & Apple silicon)\nExternal links\n* [https://www.mipar.us/ Official website]\n* [https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-image-analysis/ MIPAR Learning Resources]\n* [https://www.mipar.us/video-tutorials.html MIPAR Tutorials]"
