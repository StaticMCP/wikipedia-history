Passenger services began on 26 April 2022. The pier provides interchange with Barking Riverside railway station and local bus routes. The pier was brought into use following a renovation of the reinforced concrete coaling jetty previously used by Barking Power Station.\nHistory\nThe existing structure was built in 1940 in order to bring coal to Barking Power Station. Earlier jetty structures were found at the site as early as 1864 and a coaling jetty was constructed with the power station in 1925. Construction of the passenger pier began in 2021 and cost £7.3 million.\nDesign\nThe 1940 T-shaped jetty consists of a deck and supports made from reinforced concrete. The canting brow and pontoon were added in order to provide passenger services from 2022. They were fabricated at the Ravestein shipyard in the Netherlands. The renovation work was designed by Anthony Carlile Architects and marine engineers Beckett Rankine.\nLocation\nThe pier is located on the north bank of the River Thames at Barking Riverside. It is accessed from Project Road in the Barking Riverside neighbourhood of the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham.
