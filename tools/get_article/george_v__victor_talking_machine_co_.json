Victor Talking Machine Co., 293 U.S. 377 (1934), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held the district court's ruling of infringement of a song's common law copyright, granting an injunction so that damages could be determined, was interlocutory. The appeal came too late, so the Court vacated the appeal.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n| cornell = https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/293/377\n| findlaw = https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/293/377.html\n| googlescholar = https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7079215093805117244\n| justia  = https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/293/377/case.html\n| loc =http://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/usrep/usrep293/usrep293377/usrep293377.pdf\n}}"
