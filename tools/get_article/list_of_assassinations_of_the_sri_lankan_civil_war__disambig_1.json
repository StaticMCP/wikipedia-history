The following is a list of notable assassinations of the Sri Lankan Civil War, attributed by various self-admissions, NGOs, United Nations agencies, foreign governments, and the state-owned media of Sri Lanka\nBackground\nThe Sri Lankan Civil War was in a conflict on the island-nation of Sri Lanka. Between 1983 and 2009 there was an intermittent civil war, predominantly between the government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a separatist militant organisation who during this time fought for the creation of an independent state named Tamil Eelam in the North and East of the island. The UN has estimated that up to 100,000 people (combatants and civilians) may have been killed during the 26 years of fighting. The civil war has caused significant harm to the population and economy of the country, as well as leading to the ban of the LTTE as a terrorist organisation in 32 countries including the United States, Australia, the countries of the European Union and Canada. The war ended in May 2009 when the Sri Lankan military defeated the LTTE. Numerous human rights violations have been committed by both the Sri Lankan military and the LTTE, including the assassination of individuals by both sides. A majority of the notable figures on this list were members of the Tamil community in Sri Lanka, and in many instances were allegedly assassinated by the LTTE for taking moderate political stances, or for rejecting militant action and attempting to engage in the democratic process in Sri Lanka.\nAssassinations\nHeads of state and government\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;width:83%;\"\n|-\n! width=\"16%\" | Victim !! width=\"20%\" | Position !! width=\"13%\" | Date !! width=\"9%\" | Location !! width=\"12%\" | Method !! width=\"30%\" | Perpetrator(s)\n|-valign=top\n| Rajiv Gandhi || Former Prime Minister of India|| 21 May 1991 || Sriperumbudur, Tamil Nadu, India|||Suicide bombing || LTTE is blamed, but they denied it until 2006.
