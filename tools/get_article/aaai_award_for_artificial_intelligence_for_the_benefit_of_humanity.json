The award is presented annually at the AAAI conference in February. In its first two years, the associated reward was US$1 million, but has since been changed to $25000. Funding is provided by the Chinese online education company Squirrel AI.\nThe first recipient, in 2021, was Regina Barzilay of MIT for her work developing machine learning models to address drug synthesis and early-stage breast cancer diagnosis.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
