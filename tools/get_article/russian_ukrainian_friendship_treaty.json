Due to the beginning of the Russo-Ukrainian War in 2014, Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko signed a decree not to extend the treaty on 19 September 2018. The treaty consequently expired on 31 March 2019.\nUntil 2019, the treaty was automatically renewed on each 10th anniversary of its signing, unless one party advised the other of its intention to end the treaty six months prior to the date of the renewal.\nRussia–Ukraine relations have deteriorated since the start of the Russo-Ukrainian War with the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea and Russian support for separatist forces in the war in Ukraine's Donbas region. They were completely severed following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nSigning and ratification\nThe treaty was signed in Kyiv on 31 May 1997 by the president of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma and Russian president Boris Yeltsin.\nIn Ukraine, the treaty was ratified by the Law of Ukraine No. 13/98-VR on 14 January 1998 (On ratification of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership between Ukraine and the Russian Federation).\nIn Russia, on 25 December 1998, the State Duma of the Federal Assembly adopted a resolution on the adoption of the federal law \"On ratification of the Agreement of Friendship, Collaboration and Partnership between the Russian Federation and Ukraine\" and directed it to the Federation Council.\nThe Federation Council approved this federal law by the Resolution on 17 February 1999. The treaty was ratified.\nThe document superseded the previous treaty between the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic of 19 November 1990 (before dissolution of the Soviet Union).\nContents of the treaty\nUnder the agreement both parties ensure the citizens of the other countries' rights and freedoms on the same basis and to the same extent that it provides for its citizens, except as prescribed by national legislation of States or international treaties.\nEvery country protects in established order of the rights of its citizens living in another country, in accordance with commitments to documents of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and other universally recognized principles and norms of international law, agreements within the Commonwealth of Independent States.\nThe agreement, among other things prematurely confirms the inviolability of borders of countries, regardless of the fact that Russia and Ukraine had not finalized a border between the two countries. The border was delineated in the 2003 Treaty on the Russian-Ukrainian State Border, but Ukraine has started the agreed-upon demarcation unilaterally after Russia dragged its feet.\nUnder Article 2:}}\nThe Treaty document stipulates in Article 40 that the Treaty is entered into for a period of 10 years and renews automatically unless one of the parties notifies the other of its intention to curtail the Treaty.\nTermination\nOn 19 September 2018, Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko signed a decree not to extend the treaty. On 3 December 2018, Poroshenko drafted a legislation to Parliament to end the Treaty of Friendship immediately; support came from Western allies within the United Nations Security Council. According to Poroshenko the non-renewal \"does not require a vote\" in the  Ukrainian parliament. Ukraine announced that on 21 September 2018, it would notify the United Nations and other relevant organizations on the termination of the treaty. Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it was notified on 24 September 2018 of the treaty's termination by Ukraine and expressed regret.\nOn 3 December 2018, Poroshenko submitted a bill on the termination of the treaty to parliament; 277 MPs supported the termination of the treaty, and 20 legislators voted against it.[https://www.unian.info/m/politics/10366308-ukraine-parliament-votes-not-to-prolong-treaty-of-friendship-with-russia.html Ukraine parliament votes not to prolong Treaty of Friendship with Russia], UNIAN (6 December 2018)[https://www.unian.info/m/politics/10373223-law-on-non-prolongation-of-treaty-of-friendship-with-russia-enters-into-force-in-ukraine.html Law on non-prolongation of Treaty of Friendship with Russia enters into force in Ukraine], UNIAN (12 December 2018) On December 6 the Ukrainian parliament declared the Treaty to be terminated starting from April 1, 2019.\nSee also\n* Partition Treaty on the Status and Conditions of the Black Sea Fleet\n* Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41036701 Text of the Russian–Ukrainian Friendship Treaty]\n*  [http://docs.cntd.ru/document/1902220 Text of the Russian–Ukrainian Friendship Treaty]\n*  [http://zakon5.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/643_006 Text of the Russian–Ukrainian Friendship Treaty]\n*  [http://www.memory.gov.ua/publication/dokumenti-parlamentiv-ukraini-ta-rosii-1990-kh-rokiv-shchodo-statusu-krimu-ta-mista-seva Documents of parliaments of Ukraine and Russia in 1990s in relations to the status of Crimea and city of Sevastopol (ДОКУМЕНТИ ПАРЛАМЕНТІВ УКРАЇНИ ТА РОСІЇ 1990-х років ЩОДО СТАТУСУ КРИМУ ТА МІСТА СЕВАСТОПОЛЯ)].
