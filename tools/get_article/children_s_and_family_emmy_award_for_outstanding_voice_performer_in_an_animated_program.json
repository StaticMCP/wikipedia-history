The category was established at the 1st Children's and Family Emmy Awards in 2022, and is open to lead, supporting and guest performers of all genders. Its sister category Outstanding Voice Performance in a Preschool Animated Program honors voice-over performers in shows aimed at a younger audience. A similar category also exists to recognize younger voice performers.\nThe current holder of the award is Eric Bauza, who won at the 3rd Children's and Family Emmy Awards for his role as Daffy Duck & Bugs Bunny in the Cartoon Network series Teen Titans Go! episode \"Warner Bros. 100th Anniversary\".\nBackground\nOn November 17, 2021, the NATAS announced the creation of the Children's and Family Emmy Awards to recognize the best in children's and family television. The organization cited an \"explosive growth in the quantity and quality of children’s and family programming\" as justification for a dedicated ceremony. Many categories of the awards were previously presented at the Daytime Emmy Awards. From 1995 to 2021, voice performers were honored with the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program; however, this category was discontinued following the announcement of the Children's and Family Emmys.\nThe original name for the category was  Outstanding Voice Performance in an Animated Program, and the award received its current name as of the 3rd Children's and Family Emmy Awards.\nWinners and nominations\n.|right]]\n2020s\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  width=\"85%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n!
