She is stopped by Mani Shankar, who promises her that her son will be reincarnated and meet her in 30 years. The only condition is that the mother must remain inside Vaitheeswaran temple, praying to be reunited with her son. 30 years later, her wait catches the attention of the public, who are curious to see if Saravanan shows up. Dr. Bala , who has no belief in reincarnation, wishes to treat her, while Dhanasekharan, who is now a politician and eyeing the CM seat, knows that Saravanan's arrival could derail his plans. Armed with a computer-generated photo of how Saravanan would look like now, Dhanasekharan and Bala go looking for him, when Bala realises that he is indeed the reincarnation of Saravanan. What happens next forms the climax of the story.\nCast\nProduction\nThe film began production in 2007.\nSoundtrack\nThe soundtrack was composed by Srikanth Deva. Saraswathy Srinivas of Rediff wrote, \"Vaitheeswaran album with just three tracks plus one repetition sticks to the adage 'small is beautiful'. Sreekanth Deva's music is pleasing to the ear\".\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n! Song !! Singers !!

Pavithra Srinivasan of Rediff wrote, \"Everything is connected'. That's the tagline of Annamalai Production's latest, Tamil film Vaitheeswaran starring action star Sarathkumar, and directed by R K Vidhayadharan. You only wish the team had managed to connect the screenplay, acting and plot all together!\". Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu wrote, \"The theme by itself is fine. It's the treatment that gets suffocating after a point\", concluding, \"Beginning on an esoteric plane Vaitheeswaran soon crash-lands on a meandering terrain of myths, miracles and implausible occurrences\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
