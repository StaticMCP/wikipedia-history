The station platform runs along Woz Way (named after Apple founder Steve \"Woz\" Wozniak) and serves the Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose, after which the station is named. Just south of this station, the Blue Line enters the median of California State Route 87.\nHistory\nThe station opened on August 17, 1990, as part of Phase 3 of the light rail system's original Guadalupe Line. It was originally named Technology Center station, after the Technology Center of Silicon Valley, a temporary museum that had just been renamed to The Garage. After the museum became The Tech Museum of Innovation and moved to a new building on the Plaza de César Chávez, the San Jose City Council proposed to rename it to \"Children's Discovery Museum/Guadalupe River Park & Garden station\" and \"Discovery Meadows station\" before arriving at a name that the VTA would approve, Children's Discovery Museum.\nNotable places nearby\nThe station is within walking distance of the following notable places:\n*Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose\n*Guadalupe River Trail\nReferences\nExternal links"
