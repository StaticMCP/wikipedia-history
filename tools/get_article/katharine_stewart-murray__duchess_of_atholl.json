She was the first woman to be elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) in Scotland, despite having campaigned against women's suffrage before it was granted in 1918. She was the first woman to serve in a British Conservative government. She later found herself at odds with her party and resigned the Whip in 1935 over the India Bill. She became strongly anti-fascist in the 1930s and criticised authoritarian regimes in Soviet Russia, Italy and Spain as well as Nazi Germany. She was given the nickname 'Red Duchess' for these views.\nEarly life and education\nKatharine Marjory Ramsay was born in Edinburgh on 6 November 1874, the daughter of Sir James Henry Ramsay, 10th Baronet and Charlotte Fanning Ramsay (née Stewart). She was educated at Wimbledon High School and the Royal College of Music. During her school years she was known as Kitty Ramsay. On 20 July 1899, she married John Stewart-Murray, Marquess of Tullibardine, who succeeded his father as 8th Duke of Atholl in 1917, whereupon she became formally styled Duchess of Atholl.\nPolitical career\nKnown as \"Kitty\", Stewart-Murray was active in Scottish social service and local government and in 1912 served on the hugely influential \"Highlands and Islands Medical Service Committee\" (authors of the Dewar Report) that has been widely credited with creating the forerunner of the National Health Service. She was the chairman of the Consultative Council on Highlands and Islands\nAnti-suffrage\nAs the Marchioness of Tullibardine she was an opponent of female suffrage, with Leah Leneman describing her as 'a key speaker at the most important Scottish anti-suffrage demonstration', which took place in 1912. In 1913 she became vice-president of the branch of the Anti-Suffrage League based in Dundee.\nElection as MP\nDespite this opposition to women gaining the right to vote in parliamentary elections, she went on to be the Scottish Unionist Member of Parliament (MP) for Kinross and West Perthshire from 1923 to 1938, and served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education from 1924 to 1929, the first woman other than a mistress of the robes to serve in a British Conservative government. She was the first woman elected to represent a Scottish seat at Westminster.\nThe historian William Knox has argued that, like other early female MPs in the UK, \"she literally inherited\" her seat from her husband, but Kenneth Baxter disputes this, noting that her husband had stood down from the former West Perthshire seat in 1917 when he succeeded to the dukedom and that it had been won by a Liberal candidate in 1918 and 1922. Moreover, Baxter claims her victory in 1923 was not seen as \"a foregone conclusion\". The fact that, prior to 1918, Atholl had been opposed to women's suffrage led to her being criticised in parliament by her Conservative colleague Nancy Astor.  Baxter also suggests that she placed her political allegiance ahead of any concept of gender unity, noting her campaigning for the male Unionist candidate in Edinburgh South at the 1922 general election against the Liberal Catherine Buchanan Alderton, contrasting this with Labour and Liberal women refusing to campaign against Lady Astor in Plymouth.\nShe resigned the Conservative Whip first in 1935 over the India Bill and the \"national-socialist tendency\" of the government's domestic policy. Resuming the Whip, she resigned it again in 1938 in opposition to Neville Chamberlain's policy of appeasement of Adolf Hitler and to the Anglo-Italian agreement. According to her biography, A Working Partnership she was then deselected by her local party. She took Stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds on 28 November 1938. She stood unsuccessfully in the subsequent by-election as an Independent candidate.\nAnti-fascism\nShe argued that she actively opposed totalitarian regimes and practices. In 1931, she published The Conscription of a People—a protest against the abuse of human rights in the Soviet Union. After reading the German edition of Mein Kampf she also condemned Nazi Germany. In 1936, she was involved in a long-running battle in the pages of various newspapers with Lady Houston after the latter had become notorious for her outspoken support of Benito Mussolini. Stewart-Murray had taken issue with Houston calling in the pages of the Saturday Review for Edward VIII to become a dictator in imitation of European interwar dictatorships.\nIn February 1937 three leading British women made a tour of Romania, Czechoslavakia and Yugoslavia. They were Dorothy Layton, Eleanor Rathbone and the Duchess of Atholl. They observed the conditions and they were received by Deputy Františka Zeminová in Prague. Zeminová used the occasion to laud the support of Britain. Atholl recalls that it was at the prompting of Ellen Wilkinson that in April 1937 she, Rathbone, and Wilkinson went to Spain to observe the effects of the Spanish Civil War. In Valencia, Barcelona and Madrid she saw the impact of Luftwaffe bombing on behalf of the Nationalists, visited prisoners of war held by the Republicans and considered the impact of the conflict on women and children, in particular. Her book Searchlight on Spain resulted from the involvement, and her support for the Republican side in the conflict led to her being nicknamed by some the Red Duchess. She became active in the National Joint Committee for Spanish Relief, a cross-party group coordinating aid to Spain. She later served as the group's chairwoman. She was instrumental in persuading the British government to accept child refugees fleeing the combat, 4,000 of which arrived on the SS Habana which sailed from Bilbao to Southampton in May 1937.\nHer role in the Spanish Civil War, however, was years later criticized by George Orwell, who saw the Duchess as the \"pet of the Daily Worker\", and someone who \"lent the considerable weight of her authority to every lie the Communists happened to be uttering at the moment. Now she is fighting against the monster that she helped create. I am sure that neither she nor her Communist ex-friends see any moral in this.\"\nShortly before or even during 1938, she travelled to Romania where she visited \"Satu Mare Romanian Women Association\" in the city of Satu Mare, aiming to support the Romanian cause to preserve the state borders established in 1918, and to keep Hungary from regaining the territory that it lost in the Treaty of Trianon.\nShe campaigned against the Soviet control of Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary as the chairman of the League for European Freedom in Britain from 1945. In 1958, she published a description of her life with her husband entitled Working Partnership.\nOther work\nShe was also a vice-president of the Girls' Public Day School Trust from 1924 to 1960. She was also a keen composer, setting music to accompany the poetry of Robert Louis Stevenson. In 1927 she opened the new wing at Clifton High School, Bristol with the head,  Ms Phillips and the architect Sir George Oatley\nShe was closely involved in her husband's regiment The Scottish Horse and composed the melody \"The Scottish Horse\" to be played on bagpipes.\nHonours\nShe was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 1918 Birthday Honours.\nAs Dowager Duchess of Atholl she took over the appointment of Honorary Colonel of The Regiment of Scottish Horse from 1942, until she relinquished it in 1952.\nDeath\nKatharine, Duchess of Atholl, died in Edinburgh, aged 85, in 1960.\nPublications\n* Katharine Atholl, 1874-1960: Against the Tide S J Hetherington Publisher:  Aberdeen University Press (1989)\n*  (2 Volumes)\n*\n*\n*\n*  1st, 2nd & 3rd editions\n*\nSee also\n* Duke of Atholl\n* Julia Pirie\nReferences\nSources\nPrimary sources\nRecords relating to Atholl can be found at:\n* Blair Atholl Castle - personal papers of Katherine, Duchess of Atholl\n* British Library Manuscript Section – correspondence with Lord Cecil, 1936–1944, Ref Add MS 51142 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20080702074230/http://www.bl.uk/collections/manuscripts.html  web site])\n* Churchill Archives, Cambridge University – correspondence with Sir E L Spears, Ref SPRS ([http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD%2FGBR%2F0014%2FSPRS on-line catalogue]).\n* British Library, Asia, Pacific and Africa Collections – correspondence and papers relating to Indian self-government, 1928–1935.
