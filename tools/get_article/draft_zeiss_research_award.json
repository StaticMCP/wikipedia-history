In short, \"notability\" requires reliable sources about the subject, rather than by the subject.\nPlease note that many of the references would appear to be from sources that are NOT considered  for establishing notability and should be removed (including blogs, company websites, press releases, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Spotify etc).\nAlso, if you have any connection to the subject, including being paid, you have a conflict of interest that you must declare on your Talk page (to see instructions on how to do this please click the link).\nPlease familiarise yourself with these pages before amending the draft. If you feel you can meet these requirements, then please make the necessary amendments before resubmitting the page.\nIt would help our volunteer reviewers by identifying, on the draft's talk page, the WP:THREE best sources that establish notability of the subject.\nIt would also be helpful if you could please identify with specificity, exactly which criteria you believe the page meets (eg \"I think the page now meets WP:GNG criteria #3, because XXXXX\").\nOnce you have implemented these suggestions, you may also wish to leave a note for me on my talk page, including the name of the draft page, and I would be happy to reassess.

The award has been sponsored and presented by Carl Zeiss AG since 2016. It is awarded every second year.\nHistory\nThe Carl Zeiss Research Award was launched as an international award for research into optics in 1987 and went by this name until 2013. It is awarded every second year in rotation with the Otto Schott Research Award for special achievements in glass research. The Carl Zeiss Research Award recently received 25,000 euros und was given by the Ernst Abbe Fund which is part of the Stifterverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft.\nSince 2016, the Carl Zeiss Award for Young Researchers has recognized promising young scientists who have made outstanding contributions to optics and photonics. This award is granted as part of the Zeiss Research Award and is also financed by the Ernst Abbe Fund.\nSignificance\nThe ZEISS Research Award is intended to make a contribution to enhancing awareness of optics and photonics in science and technology. By supporting promising research projects, the award also promotes the development of innovative technologies. As the award is being presented in collaboration with a range of academic institutions, winners will also have the opportunity to expand their knowledge and network with other researchers.\nJury\nThe current jury consists of highly qualified and renowned personalities from the world of research including Alain Aspect, Cornelia Denz and Stefan Hell.\nWinners\nWinners of the Carl Zeiss Research Award\n* 1990: Philippe Grangier from Orsay, James R.
