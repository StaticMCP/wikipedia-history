      "text": "# All Flowers in Time Bend Towards the Sun\n\nAll Flowers in Time Bend Towards the Sun is an unreleased duet by American singer Jeff Buckley and Scottish singer Elizabeth Fraser of Cocteau Twins. A rough demo, recorded during the pair's mid-1990s relationship, has circulated online but has never been officially issued. In 2009, Fraser called the recording \"unfinished\" and said she did not want it to be heard, adding, \"Maybe I won't always think that\".\nBackground and recording\nCoverage places the collaboration around 1994-95, when Buckley and Fraser were in a romantic relationship, and describes the track as an intimate, informal demo rather than a label-commissioned studio release. The recording features a conversational, stripped-back performance with the singers alternating verses; faint laughter from Fraser can be heard before she enters.\nLeak and circulation\nFollowing Buckley's death in 1997, the duet leaked and spread through fan networks and later video-sharing sites; subsequent reporting has treated it as an unofficial but persistent item in Buckley's posthumous circulation.\nReception and legacy\nDespite its unofficial status, the track has drawn critical attention. Dazed listed the duet among Buckley's \"most underrated deep cuts,\" highlighting the unusual vocal pairing and emotional impact.\nThe song was incorporated into The Last Goodbye, a 2013 stage adaptation of Romeo and Juliet built around Buckley's music; Playbill noted the production exchanges the canonical balcony scene \"for the duet of the unrecorded number 'All Flowers in Time.'\"\nAn art exhibition at Almine Rech in 2025 took its title from the song, citing the phrase's resonance and imagery.\nCredits\n* Jeff Buckley – vocal (demo)\n* Elizabeth Fraser – vocal (demo)\nReferences"
