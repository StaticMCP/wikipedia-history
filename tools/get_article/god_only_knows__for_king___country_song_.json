On 11 January 2019, \"God Only Knows\" was released to Christian radio as the second single from the album. In an interview with Free CCM, the duo explained the message behind the song:\"God Only Knows\" is one of those songs that you know... there are inward songs that were written about specific circumstances and you hope someone else resonates with them. This was a song looking out. There seems to be a lot of you saying this, you did this, how dare you. The song is a question mark of well, first of all, do we understand each other fully? Our histories, our family heritages, the struggles in life, the things that have been done to us that no one knows about. The shame that we carry. Some of it we've done to ourselves, that's self-sabotage. Some of it other people have done to us. You're just seeing a brief moment in time of that person. What if we pulled the lens back? Even if we did, there are some things that God does only know. We've got our shame, we've got our troubles, we've got our prejudice, we've got our judgements. God knows your heart and in turn, the flip of that is, God also carries this love that is sort of the superman of all love. We kind of are image bearers and so we emulate it, but it's just this wonderful superhuman love that if we lean into it'd be a beautiful thing. But so often we don't understand because we're stuck in a human variation of it.\nComposition\n\"God Only Knows\" is originally in the key of B minor, with a tempo of 144 beats per minute.

Yet there are these things, these underlying insecurities that are shifting the way she perceives life and people perceive her,\" band member Joel Smallbone revealed in the behind the scenes video. The music video shows the woman presumably committing suicide by jumping off a bridge. The video then explains what could have happened if a friend she confronted that day might have been there for her at her worst point. The friend's care results in a different ending to the day. \"The power of someone interacting, showing a small act of kindness, a hug, a smile, and how that just changes the trajectory of her life [on] this one particular day, which was a very crucial day in this young lady's life,\" Smallbone followed up his previous comment. It ends with the number for the National Suicide Prevention Line.\nTrack listing\nCD release\n#\"God Only Knows\" – 3:49\n#\"God Only Knows\" (Lead Sheet (Medium Key) – 3:49\n#\"God Only Knows\" (Vocal Demonstration) – 3:47\n#\"God Only Knows\" (High Key With Background Vocals) – 3:47\n#\"God Only Knows\" (High Key Without Background Vocals) – 3:47\n#\"God Only Knows\" (Medium Key With Background Vocals) – 3:47\n#\"God Only Knows\" (Medium Key Without Background Vocals) – 3:47\n#\"God Only Knows\" (Low Key With Background Vocals) – 3:47\n#\"God Only Knows\" (Low Key Without Background Vocals) – 3:47\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Weekly chart performance for \"God Only Knows\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018–2020)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak position\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Weekly chart performance for \"God Only Knows (Dolly Parton Remix)\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak position\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+2018 year-end chart performance for \"God Only Knows\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Christian Songs (Billboard)\n| 78\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+2019 year-end chart performance for \"God Only Knows\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Christian Songs (Billboard)\n| 2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Christian Airplay (Billboard)\n| 1\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Christian CHR (Billboard)\n| 1\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Christian AC (Billboard)\n| 1\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+2020 year-end chart performance for \"God Only Knows\"\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Adult Contemporary (Billboard)\n| 39\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Christian Digital Song Sales (Billboard)\n| 5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Christian Streaming Songs (Billboard)\n| 7\n|}\nDecade-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Decade-end chart performance for \"God Only Knows\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2010s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Christian Songs (Billboard)\n| 24\n|}\nCertifications\nReferences"
