Until 1998 it was called the National Council of Traditional Leaders. It advises Parliament on issues related to customary law.\nProvincial Houses of Traditional Leaders\nThere are provincial Houses of Traditional Leaders in every province except the Western Cape.\nLocal Houses of Traditional Leaders\nBy February 2008, 70% of local houses were established.\nControversies\nIn 2010, 6 of the 13 kingships were converted to lower-level leaderships, because some of the kings were originally appointed by the white minority government with few legitimate claims to their thrones in order to \"divide and rule.\"\nThe Constitutional Court ruled that it was unlawful for traditional authorities to collect levies on services. In 2023, the Constitutional Court ruled that Parliament had not facilitated public participation in passing the Traditional and Khoi-San Leadership Act 2019.\nReferences"
