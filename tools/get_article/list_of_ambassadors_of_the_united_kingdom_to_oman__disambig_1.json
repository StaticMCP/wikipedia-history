Following the accession of Sultan Qaboos in 1970, the Sultan agreed that the consulate-general should be raised to an embassy, and the first British ambassador (and the first ambassador of any country) to the Sultanate, Donald Hawley, presented his credentials to the Sultan on 22 July 1971.\nIn June 2023, Dr. Liane Saunders OBE became the first female UK ambassador to hold that post following the retirement of William Murray.\nBritish ambassadors to Oman\n*1971–1974: Donald Hawley\n*1975–1979: James Treadwell\n*1979–1981: Ivor Lucas\n*1981–1986: Duncan Slater\n*1986–1990: Robert Alston\n*1990–1994: Sir Terence Clark\n*1994–1999: Sir Richard Muir\n*1999–2002: Sir Ivan Callan\n*2002–2005: Stuart Laing\n*2005–2011: Dr Noel Guckian\n*2011–2014: Jamie Bowden\n*2014–2017: Jonathan Wilks\n*2017–2021: Hamish Cowell\n*2021–2022: William Murray\n*2023–:  Dr. Liane Saunders OBE\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.gov.uk/government/world/oman UK and Oman], gov.uk"
