The series follows thirteen teams of three competitors as they \"solve problems while racing across deserts, over mountains and through rivers\" across the nation of Morocco. The first team to cross the finish line after completing the ten stages of the competition was to receive US$150,000. In addition, each team member won a new Ford Explorer.\nCreated by producer Mark Burnett and hosted by wildlife expert Dave Salmoni, the series premiered on ABC on June 23, 2011, to mild critical response. The show was canceled following its first and only season.\nGame\nExpedition Impossible is run in ten stages, each of which has a series of checkpoints. At each checkpoint, teams receive instructions on how to reach the next checkpoint and at some checkpoints they face challenges that must be completed before heading to the next checkpoint. The last team in each stage to reach the final checkpoint is eliminated. If any member of a team quits, the team is eliminated.\nThe competition began in Merzouga and concluded in Marrakech, covering a course of around 2,000 miles including treks through the Sahara Desert and over the Atlas Mountains.\nProduction\nABC and producer Mark Burnett announced the series on November 4, 2010, with Burnett describing Expedition Impossible as \"high adventure television\" and \"an epic Indiana Jones-style experience\". Open casting began later that month. Prospective contestants were required to demonstrate proficiency in several skills, including horseback riding, righting a boat that had been capsized, compass reading and rappelling.\nAfter initially announcing a premiere date of June 21, 2011, ABC revised the date to June 23.\nInternational distribution and adaptations\nOn May 9, 2011, CTV Television Network announced that it had acquired Expedition Impossible for Canadian broadcast and that it would debut the series on June 21. CTV pushed back the premiere to the 23rd, corresponding with its American debut.\nOn July 16, 2011, Australia's Network Ten started to broadcast the show in the 6:30pm – 7:30pm timeslot on its main channel - 10.\nAn adaptation of the series premiered on the channel Cuatro in Spain on January 23, 2013.

Burnett has repudiated the comparisons to TAR, saying \"There’s no taxis. There’s no hotels. This is very, very different. Here, you actually need to put yourself on the line, really be willing to cross the deserts and the mountains and use the camels and the horses. So, it’s a very, very much more difficult competition.\"\nDavid Hinckley of The New York Daily News found the premiere to follow a familiar formula and wondered whether a \"saturation point\" for this style of entertainment had been reached. In saying so, he stressed that he in no way was diminishing the accomplishments of the participating teams. Similarly, Brian Lowry for Variety, while calling the series a \"transparent knockoff of The Amazing Race\", complimented Burnett on his ability to create \"a sense of jeopardy in the challenges\" while finding that the series as a whole \"travels such a familiar course\" that it was tantamount to \"recycling\" the concepts of other series.\nExpedition Impossible was the top-rated program the night of its debut, pulling 2.4/7 in adults 18/49 and 7.18 million viewers. The premiere was the 8th most watched show that week. In the second episode, Expedition Impossible pulled a 1.8/6 in adults 18/49 and 6.16 million viewers. This drop was not unusual for a holiday weekend, as other shows also experienced a rating decline. Despite this, Expedition Impossible was the top rated program of the hour and the second top rated program of the night, as well as the 12th most watched show that week in the 18/49 demo.  Ratings however continued to slip when its fifth episode only garnered a rating of 1.3 for the 18/49 demo and 4.68 million in total viewers. The show hit a season low for its eighth episode, with a demo rating of 1.1 and only watched by 3.83 million viewers. The show's ninth episode was watched by 4.45 million viewers, and the season finale ended with a rating of 1.3 for the 18/49 demo and 4.61 millions in total viewer number.\nInternational versions\nThe TV format was exported in Spain with the title Expedición Imposible when it was aired on Cuatro and hosted by Raquel Sánchez Silva on 2013.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110517070836/http://abc.go.com/shows/expedition-impossible/index Official site]"
