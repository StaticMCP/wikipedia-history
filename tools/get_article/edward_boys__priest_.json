He is said, but on doubtful authority, to have been one of the chaplains to Charles I. serving from 1639 to 1667.\nAfter an incumbency of twenty-eight years Boys died at Mautboy on 10 March 1666-7, and was buried in the chancel. An admired scholar, of exceptional powers as a preacher, and in great favour with his bishop, Joseph Hall, Boys was deterred from seeking higher preferment by an exceeding modesty.\nWorks\nAfter his death appeared his only known publication, a volume of Sixteen Sermons, preached upon several occasions, London, 1672. The editor, Roger Flynt, a fellow-collegian, tells us in his preface that it was with difficulty he obtained leave of the dying author to make them public, and gained it only upon condition 'that he should say nothing of him.' From which he leaves the reader to judge 'how great this man was, that made so little of himself.' He speaks, nevertheless, of the great loss to the church ' that such a one should expire in a country village consisting onely of four farmers.'\nFamily\nIn 1640 Boys married Mary Herne, who was descended from a Norfolk family.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
