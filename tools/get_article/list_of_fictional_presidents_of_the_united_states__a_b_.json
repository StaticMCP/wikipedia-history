Through her, the USSR hopes to discover an American secret that could tip the balance of global power in favor of the Soviet Union.\n* Party: Democratic\nPresident Cal Bradford\n* President in Paradise\n* A native of Kentucky and a 'Southern Progressive', Bradford is the son of oil baron Kane Bradford, one of the world's wealthiest men. Kane pushed Cal into politics against his wishes, and he became a United States Senator before being elected as the 47th President at the age of 42.\n* During his first term, Bradford becomes aware of an impending extinction event, projected to occur as the result of the eruption of a supervolcano beneath Antarctica. Bradford, supported by the wealth of his father and other private financiers, oversees the 'Liberty Grove' project, a top-secret underground city in Colorado.\n* The project is the brainchild of billionaire industrialist Samantha Redmond, an old friend of Bradford. It intends to save a selected 25,000 Americans to continue life in an idyllic setting. In the years ahead of the expected event, conspiracy theories about Colorado gather pace. This leads to an assassination attempt on Bradford, and he is saved by his lead Secret Service agent, Xavier Collins.\n* On the day of the extinction event, Bradford's administration is caught unprepared, as scientific analysis had assured them they'd have weeks rather than hours of preparation. In an address to the American people, Bradford tells them the truth so they can decide how to spend their final moments before being chaotically evacuated from the White House onto Air Force One.\n* On that same day, Russia and China begin a nuclear war out of a desire to be the last power standing to control what's left of global resources. Rather than launch the US nuclear arsenal in response, Bradford activates the 'blue option' - an EMP network installed after the Cuban Missile Crisis to electronically fry any nuclear exchanges at the cost of worldwide electricity. Bradford believed such a move would give the humans left behind a fighting chance of survival.\n* In Liberty Grove, Bradford serves as a public figurehead for the surviving American population, extending his second term beyond its original period. However, Redmond holds control in reality.\n* Upon discovering restricted information showing survivors of the cataclysm on the outside, he announces to Redmond that he intends to release the files to the residents and his family.\n* However, before she and her men can silence him, Bradford is killed by Trent, a former project manager during Liberty Grove's construction, posing as the city librarian. Trent was excluded from the project after attempting to blow the whistle on fatal safety violations during excavation. He was the man who tried to assassinate Bradford. Having managed to escape ADX Florence on the day of the eruption, he killed and impersonated the librarian en route to the bunker.\n* Bradford was succeeded by Vice President Henry Baines, who was also evacuated to the underground city as part of the selected 25,000.\n* Fan of basketball (supporting the Kentucky Wildcats), as well as golf and music of the 1980's and 1990's.\n* Married to, but estranged from First Lady Jessica Bradford.

He lives long enough to see the world devastated in \"The Final War\" of 2070. In the aftermath, Brown's hometown of Newburgh, New York, becomes the center of a short-lived \"North American Soviet\", whose members arrest Brown and torture him to death. After the fall of the regime, Brown is revered by survivors as \"a martyr who gave his life for the people\". Gradually, with few records left from before the worldwide destruction, Brown's memory is conflated with that of Jesus Christ as well as Abraham Lincoln and the Biblical Abraham, to create the divine figure of \"Abraham\" whose worship is the basis of \"The Holy Murkan Church\" in Pangborn's later novel Davy.\nPresident Jennifer Brown\n* President in the Y: The Last Man television series.\n* Originally a US Congresswoman and chair of the House Intelligence Committee, after a cataclysmic event simultaneously killed all mammals with a Y chromosome except for her son Yorick Brown and his pet monkey Ampersand, she was elevated to president by being elected House Speaker (a position she held for an hour) after most of the presidential line of succession died (the sole known surviving member being disqualified due to being born outside of the United States).\n* With the remnants of the US Government having to relocate to the Pentagon, her administration is occupied with the aftermath of the event, namely rioting, failing infrastructure, internal displacement, shortages and the Arizona state government being held hostage by a militia demanding an explanation for the die-off.\n* A power struggle ensues when Regina Oliver, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to deceased Republican President Ted Campbell, is found alive in an Israeli field hospital, believed to have been killed as a result of the die-off. Being the sole surviving eligible member of the previous presidential line of succession, Oliver is widely considered a 'fringe lunatic', with Yorick describing her as an 'anti-immigrant, anti-government, anti-vaxxer with a Twitter following' but is reinstated to her position in the Cabinet to placate her. A caucus of surviving Republican congresswomen, senators and other officials led by Kimberly Campbell Cunningham, President Campbell's politically active daughter, seek to reinstall a Republican administration and to restore a cis-male population (and, by extension, the patriarchy and basis of their previous influence), but are hesitant due to Oliver's fringe ideologies.\n* To resolve the reproductive crisis, Brown secretly orders Culper Ring operative Agent 355 to bodyguard Yorick outside of the Pentagon and to locate geneticist Dr Allison Mann. After reported sightings of Yorick and suspicions of a conspiracy, Brown admits to and defends the cover-up when pressed by Oliver and Kimberly, losing support amongst the Cabinet as Agent 355 killed two pilots who had helped rescue Yorick from New York (viewed by the Cabinet as either being on Brown's direct orders or the actions of a rogue agent) and as Yorick is seemingly now outside of government control or protection.\n* Shortly after Brown is removed from office, Yorick's ex-girlfriend Beth DeVille (who had rejected his offer of marriage just before the die-off) leads a raid on the Pentagon to take control of its amenities, accidentally shooting and killing the newly installed President Oliver in the process and allowing Brown to escape after learning that Yorick is still alive. However, Brown and DeVille along with Sam Jordan (a friend of Brown's daughter, Hero) are captured and detained by surviving members of the Culper Ring.\n* In the original comic book series, Jennifer Brown was elevated to Secretary of the Interior after the Secretary of Agriculture Margaret Valentine (based on Ann Margaret Veneman) was sworn in as president. Brown originally served as the Representative for Ohio's 22nd district (which ceased to exist following the die-off), and was an anti-abortion Democrat.\n* Party: Democratic.\n* Played by: Diane Lane.\nPresident Paul Buckingham\n*President in: Deterrence\n*Vice President Buchanan resigns during his term.\n*Warns China against military action in 2007.\n*Dies in office in October 2007, succeeded by appointed Vice President Walter Emerson.\n*Played by: James Handy.\nPresident Porter Brunreich\n* President in: the Timeline Wars series by John Barnes.\n* Porter Brunreich, an exceptionally intelligent and gifted ten-year-old girl, accompanies her mother and flees Pittsburgh to escape her abusive and violent father. She and her mother board a plane to Seattle.  A war takes place across millions of alternate timelines. A slave society from an alternate timeline instructs terrorists under their control to stage a hostage crisis at Seattle Airport and kill Porter. Her mother saves her by sacrificing herself. Porter is deeply traumatized and guilt-ridden after seeing her mother die, and for some months lives on the city streets. She is adopted by Mark Strang, an agent of the Timeliners opposing the \"Masters\". As a teenager, she becomes a world class musician, and tours many countries. The attempts on her life continue: In Oslo, she kills two assailants with a gun; in Weimar, Porter and her companions are nearly killed, but manage to time travel to when Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon and started his march to seize power in Rome. Porter fascinates Caesar by playing the Roman lyre and performing modern musical pieces on it. He tries to rape Porter, but her bodyguard Paula kills him. With great difficulty, Porter and her companions are brought to late 20th-century Europe. When she is elected, she informs the world about the war across the timelines. The world could not afford to remain disunited, divided into various countries acting at cross purposes.\nCensor Bryan\n* President in: A Different Flesh\n* In an alternate timeline where Homo erectus (called \"sims\") and megafauna from the Pleistocene era survived in the Western Hemisphere, Britain's American colonies secede earlier in 1738 to form the Federated Commonwealths of America, the development of a British absolutist monarchy being cited as the main impetus. The constitution of the Federated Commonwealths is modelled more so on the Roman Republic than that of the real-life United States, with the country being governed by two chief executives who can veto each other. Censors serve a single non-renewable five-year term and serve as senators for life (alongside commonwealth governors) after leaving office.\n* Serving as one of the two censors in 1988, Bryan calls for an investigation into the handling of a riot by sims' rights activists protesting the use of sims for HIV research.
