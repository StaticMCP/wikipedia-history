      "text": "# Women's Suffrage National Monument\n\nThe '''Women's Suffrage National Monument''' is a planned memorial sculpture that will honor suffragists who organized and demonstrated for the women's right to vote in the United States.\nThe Women's Suffrage National Monument Foundation is leading efforts to build the monument. The Foundation was founded in 2018, and in 2020 it was authorized by an act of Congress to oversee the establishment of the monument. The project was initially authorized as the Every Word We Utter Monument.\nThe sculpture is designed by Colorado artist Jane DeDecker.\nFirst ladies Rosalynn Carter, Laura Bush, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Michelle Obama, Melania Trump, and Jill Biden are honorary chairs of the Foundation. The Foundation's Executive Director is Anna Laymon. Pamela Rouse Wright and Ginnie Sebastian Storage, the 46th and 47th Presidents General of the Daughters of the American Revolution, serve as ambassadors for the foundation. Between 2024 and 2025, the Daughters of the American Revolution donated $1 million to the foundation.\nIn October 2022, Monument supporters began lobbying Congress to garner support for construction of the monument on the National Mall in Washington, DC. Senators introduced a bill that would provide an exemption to the Commemorative Works Act and allow its placement in the Reserve of the National Mall axis in March 2023.\nSee also\n* List of monuments and memorials to women's suffrage\n* List of national memorials of the United States\n* Turning Point Suffrage Memorial\n* Belmont–Paul Women's Equality National Monument\n* Women's Rights National Historical Park\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.womensmonument.org/ Women's Suffrage National Monument Foundation]\n* [https://www.congress.gov/116/plaws/publ217/PLAW-116publ217.pdf Public Law 116–217 116th Congress]"
