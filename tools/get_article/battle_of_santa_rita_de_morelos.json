The Centralist Mexican forces defeated the insurgent forces. Included in this defeat was the trial and execution of 23 members of the insurgents' cavalry, including Colonel Jose Antonio de Zapata, the commander of the cavalry, on the 29 March.\nAftermath\nGeneral Canales and the remaining insurgents that survived the Battle of Morelos sought refuge in San Antonio, Texas. Later that year Canales organized an expedition back into Mexico under the command of Samuel Jordan, decisively defeating a Centralist force under General Rafael Vasquez near Saltillo. After the battle, Jordan and his command withdrew in good order back into Texas, and soon afterwards, Canales capitulated to the Centralists.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n* .\nFurther reading\n*"
