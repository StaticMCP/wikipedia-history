The battle resulted in a Rai victory, though their ruler Rai Sahiras II was slain in combat.\nBackground\nThe Sasanian king Khosrow II launched a campaign to invade Makran, which at the time formed part of Sindh under the Rai dynasty. He advanced through the route of Kerman, though his overall plans for conquest were unsuccessful.\nThe Campaign\nKhosrow II attacked Kech, prompting the Sindhi ruler Rai Sahiras II to gather his forces and march into the region. After an exhausting battle, the Sasanian army was defeated, but Rai Sahiras II was killed during the fighting.\nAftermath\nThe Persian army retreated to Iran, abandoning their invasion of Sindh. Following the death of Rai Sahiras II, his son Rai Sahasi II succeeded to the throne and restored peace to the kingdom.\nSee also\n* Rai dynasty\n* History of Sindh\n* Sasanian Empire\nReferences"
