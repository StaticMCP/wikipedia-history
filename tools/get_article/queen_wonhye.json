Alongside her elder sister, she entered King Hyeonjong's palace around 1011 CE. She was honoured as Princess Anbok () while living in Anbok Palace (). This later changed into Princess Yeondeok () when she moved to Yeondeok Palace ().\nDeath and legacy\nIn 1022, the 13th year of her husband's reign, Lady Kim died after giving birth to her only daughter. Three years later in 1025, she was posthumously honoured as a queen consort. She was also honoured as Queen Pyeonggyeong () in 1027 and buried in Hoereung Tomb ().\nAfter her eldest son ascended the throne as King Munjong, Lady Kim became honored as a queen dowager.
