It is probably best known for the nearby Burnham Beeches woodland.\nThe village is served by Burnham railway station on the main line between  and . The M4 motorway passes through the south of the parish.\nHistory\nThe toponym is derived from the Old English for \"homestead on a stream\".\nIt was first recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Burneham, when the manor was held by Walter FitzOther.\nBurnham was once a very important village. The Great West Road from London to Bath passed through the extensive parish of Burnham and as a result, in 1271, a Royal charter was granted to hold a market and an annual fair. However, when the first Maidenhead Bridge crossing the Thames opened c.1280, the road was diverted to the south of Burnham (the route of the modern A4), and Burnham fell into relative decline. The market was then transferred to Maidenhead.\nToday the village is nearly contiguous with west Slough, though green-buffered by parkland. At the 2011 census the civil parish had a population of 11,630 and Burnham is the traditional village nucleus.\nParish Church\nThe Church of England parish church of Saint Peter dates in part from the 12th century but has been substantially expanded, refurbished and altered, with major restorations in 1863–64 and 1891 and the construction of the Cornerstone Centre in 1986.\nBurnham Abbey\nIn 1265 a Benedictine women's abbey was founded near the village by Richard, Earl of Cornwall. The community was dispersed under King Henry VIII in the dissolution of the monasteries. Since 1916, a contemplative order of Church of England Augustinian nuns has been based in the restored remains of the original abbey.\nThe abbey is now up for sale at a price of around £3 million.\nHamlets\nThe parish of Burnham included a number of communities: in the 18th century the liberties assessed for the poor rate were Burnham Town, East Burnham, Boveney, Britwell, Cippenham and Wood. Boveney became a separate civil parish in 1866 Cippenham was transferred to Slough in 1930, and therefore became part of Berkshire in 1974. Britwell was transferred to the borough of Slough and to Berkshire in 1974.\nThe current civil parish now includes Lent Rise, Rose Hill, East Burnham, Hitcham, Littleworth and Littleworth Common.\nSchools\nThe selective Burnham Grammar School provides secondary education\nAmenities\nThe village has a traditional High Street, with many buildings dating from the 18th and 19th century. There are two small supermarkets\nand five pubs on or near the High Street, and many small independent cafes and shops. At the south end of the High Street is a large park, which contains the community centre of Burnham Park Hall and a small public library.\nBurnham Football Club is a non-League football team that plays at the 1878 Stadium.\nBurnham has a Local nature reserve on the eastern border of the village called Haymill Valley.\nBurnham Beeches National Nature Reserve, an area of  of protected ancient woodland, lies just north of the village. Owing to its proximity to Pinewood Film & TV Studios, Burnham and its surrounding areas (in particular Burnham Beeches) feature in films, notably main scenes in Carry On films and for the 1991 film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.\nThe major National Trust estate of Cliveden is about three miles northwest, in the neighbouring parish of Taplow.  Dorneywood, currently the country home of the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, is in Burnham parish.\nThe River Thames is about two miles south and west of the village centre. The major rowing venue of Dorney Lake is nearby. There are three golf courses (Huntswood, Lambourne, Burnham Beeches) to the north and west of the village.\nTransport links\nIn addition to Burnham railway station (Elizabeth line) and the nearby M4,\nthe Chiltern Main Line and the M40 are accessible about 5 miles north at Beaconsfield while Heathrow Airport is about 12 miles east.\nDemography\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ 2011 Published Statistics: Population, home ownership and extracts from Physical Environment, surveyed in 2005\n|-\n!Output area||Homes owned outright||Owned with a loan||Socially rented||Privately rented||Other||km2 roads||km2 water||km2 domestic gardens||km2 domestic buildings||km2 non-domestic buildings||Usual residents ||km2\n|- align=center\n|Civil parish|| 1632\t||\t1748\t||\t780\t||\t472\t||\t60\t||\t0.716\t||\t0.057\t||\t1.907\t||\t0.355\t||\t0.122\t||\t11630\t||\t19.84\n|}\nNotable people\n*Richard Davies vicar 1550&ndash;54 and 1559&ndash;61, Bishop of St&nbsp;Asaph 1560&ndash;61 then Bishop of St&nbsp;Davids 1561&ndash;81\n*Lord Grenville (Prime Minister 1806–07) built Dropmore House to the north of the village.\n*Charles William Sharpe – engraver\n*Mike Ashley – billionaire businessman\n*Jimmy Carr – comedian attended Burnham Grammar School\n*Susan Cooper – author\n*Armando Iannucci – writer\n*Ulrika Jonsson – TV presenter\n*Will Mellor – Actor\n*Paul Shaw – footballer\n*Tracey Ullman – comedian\n*Arthur Wontner – actor\nFreedom of the Parish\nThe following people and military units have received the Freedom of the Parish of Burnham.\nIndividuals\n* Councillor  David Pepler: 9 November 2024.\n* Mrs. Muriel Pepler: 9 November 2024.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.burnhambucks.co.uk/ Burnham Bucks community website]\n*[http://www.burnhamfc1878.co.uk/ Burnham Football Club website]"
