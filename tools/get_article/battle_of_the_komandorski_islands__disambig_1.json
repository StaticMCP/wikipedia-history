The Japanese were escorting a three ship convoy, while the Americans were patrolling waters west of the Aleutian Islands. The battle was a daylight surface engagement in which air support played no role and in which the outnumbered American force escaped greater damage after the Japanese chose to withdraw.\nBackground\nIn June 1942, Japanese forces landed in the western Aleutian Islands of Kiska and Attu, as a northern pincer of the main attack on Midway Island. After the stunning Japanese defeat at Midway, the Japanese held the islands as a defensive shield against any American attempt against the Kuriles. As the U.S. was preparing its assault on the Japanese strongholds, Japanese shipping between Japan and the islands was harassed by submarines and aircraft. The Japanese Imperial Navy countered this threat by sailing at night or taking advantage of stormy weather. Aware of Japanese tactics, Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid deployed a surface force around Attu. On the night of 19/20 February 1943, the patrol force, consisting of the heavy cruiser  and the destroyers  and , shelled and sank the Japanese transport ship Akagane Maru (3100 GRT) west of Attu.\nIn a bid to defy the American blockade, Vice-Admiral Boshirō Hosogaya, in charge of the 5th Fleet and the northern theatre of operations, assembled a high-speed convoy with two fast merchant ships Asaka Maru (7399 GRT) and Sakito Maru (7158 GRT) and a slower transport, the Sanko Maru (5491 GRT). The latter and her escort, the destroyer , were to make a rendezvous with the main force south of the Komandorski Islands. The ships carried materiel essential to complete the building of an all-weather airstrip at Attu.\nWhen Admiral Kinkaid became aware of Japanese plans to send a supply convoy to their forces on the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, U.S. Navy ships commanded by Rear Admiral Charles McMorris were sent to prevent this. The fleet consisted of the heavy cruiser , the light cruiser  and the destroyers , ,  and .\nAmerican intelligence estimated that the Japanese escort consisted of one heavy cruiser, one light cruiser, and four destroyers.  However, the Japanese 5th Fleet had been reinforced by two more cruisers, so that the Japanese escort force actually consisted of the heavy cruisers  and , the light cruisers  and , and the destroyers , , , and . Vice Admiral Boshirō Hosogaya hoisted his flag on Nachi. Rear-Admiral McMorris didn't learn that he was facing a superior force until one hour after the first radar contact.\nBattle\nOn the early morning of 27 March 1943, the Japanese convoy was intercepted by the American picket line some 100 nautical miles south of the Komandorski islands and 180 nautical miles west of Attu, just to the west of the International Date Line. Despite lacking radar, the Japanese cruiser squadron spotted the American force half an hour earlier than their enemies, in part because the southern horizon was lightening earlier than the northern, as well as the strict selection of lookouts of exceptional visual acuity by the Japanese navy. Because of the remote location of the battle and its being a chance encounter on the open ocean, neither fleet had air or submarine assistance, making this one of the few engagements exclusively between surface ships in the Pacific Theater and one of the last pure gunnery duels between fleets of major surface combatants in naval history. At one point, McMorris made a request for air support to the USAAF air base at Adak. However, the B-24 squadron sent to attack the Japanese force became lost in the fog and had to return home. A spotter aircraft from Nachi directed fire on the American force for the whole battle. While the Japanese side criticized the observers' inability to deal with smoke screens, the US reports say that the accurate way in which the enemy gunners shifted their fire led the Americans to believe that one of the Japanese cruisers had fire control radar.\nAlthough the Japanese cruisers heavily outgunned the American force and inflicted more damage, the engagement was tactically inconclusive. The U.S. Navy warships escaped destruction after a Japanese misjudgment, when, with the Japanese fleet on the edge of victory, Admiral Hosogaya – not realizing the heavy damage his ships had inflicted and fearing American war planes would appear – chose to retreat, conceding a strategic victory to the US Navy. Indeed, the battle ended Japanese attempts to resupply the Aleutian garrisons by surface ship, leaving only submarines to conduct supply runs.  The airstrip at Attu was never finished. Hosogaya was accordingly retired from active service after the battle and assigned to govern a group of South Pacific islands.\nTimeline of the battle\nThis is a timeline of the action, based upon authors O'Hara and Millsap.\n*0600: The United States ships were formed in a scouting line at six-mile intervals zig-zagging at 15 knots on base course 020°.\n*0700: While the Japanese formation was turning 180º to a northern course, destroyer Inazuma, still heading south, spotted unknown ships 27000 yards to port. A navigating officer on one of the transports visually observed the American force minutes later.\n*0715: The ships were identified as American, as the day dawned.\n*0730: Hosogaya ordered a turn to starboard, to the southeast, while the two fast transports were ordered to withdraw north-northwest, escorted by Inazuma.\n*0730: Lead ships Coghlan and Richmond made radar contact with the two trailing Japanese transports and a destroyer on course 080° at .\n*0740: The Americans changed course to 080° and the rear ships increased speed to operate as a compact group. Five radar contacts were counted.\n*0755: The Japanese turned northward to course 340° and the Americans came to course 000° to follow.\n*0811: The Americans visually identified the radar contacts as two transports, two light cruisers, and a destroyer.\n*0820: The Americans sighted the masts of four more Japanese ships on the horizon.\n*0835: The Americans identified the masts as two heavy cruisers and two destroyers and turned to course 240°.\n*0838: The Japanese transports swerved off to the northwest.\n*0839: The Americans increased speed to .\n*0840: Nachi opened fire on Richmond at a range of . The second and third salvos were straddles.\n*0840: Nachi launched her spotter aircraft to direct fire on the US force.\n*0841: Richmond opened fire on Nachi. The third salvo was a straddle.\n*0842: Salt Lake City opened fire on Nachi at a range of . The second salvo was a straddle.\nAs the range closed, Bailey opened fire on Nachi at a range of  and then switched to a light cruiser. Coghlan opened fire on Nachi at a range of .\n*0845: Nachi launched eight torpedoes. All missed.\n*0850: One of Richmond′s  shells hit the starboard side of Nachi′s signal bridge, killing 11 and wounding 21. Another shell hit Nachi′s mainmast and severed the flagship radio communication.\n*0852: One of Richmond′s 6-inch shells hit Nachi′s torpedo compartment. Another of Richmond′s 6-inch shells hit Nachi′s control room, killing two and wounding five. Nachi dropped back after losing electrical power to ammunition hoists and gun mounts.\n*0903: Richmond ceased firing. Salt Lake City continued firing from stern turrets.\n*0910: Salt Lake City was hit by an  projectile fired by Maya. Two men were killed, while the starboard observation plane caught fire and was jettisoned overboard.\n*1010: Salt Lake City was hit by an 8-inch projectile fired by Maya.\n*1059: Salt Lake City was hit by an 8-inch projectile fired by Maya.\n*1103: Salt Lake City was hit by an 8-inch projectile fired by Maya. Salt Lake City transferred water to correct a list caused by flooding.\n*1152: Salt Lake City was hit by an 8-inch projectile fired by Maya.\n*1153: Salt water entered a fuel tank in use and extinguished Salt Lake City′s boiler fires.\n*1154: Salt Lake City slowed to a stop. Bailey, Coghlan and Monaghan approached the Japanese cruisers for a torpedo attack while Richmond and Dale made smoke to shield Salt Lake City.\n*1203: Salt Lake City restarted boilers and increased speed to 15&nbsp;knots.\n*1213: Salt Lake City increased speed to .\n*1225: Bailey launched five torpedoes at . All missed. Bailey was hit twice by 8-inch shells and came to a stop with five dead. Coghlan was hit once.\n*1230: Japanese ships retired westward. Neither Coghlan nor Monaghan launched torpedoes.\nSalt Lake City fired 806 armor-piercing projectiles and then 26 high-capacity (explosive) shells after the supply of armor-piercing ammunition was exhausted. Powder and shells were manhandled aft from the forward magazines to keep the after guns firing. Salt Lake City′s rudder stops were carried away, limiting her to 10° course changes.\nOrder of battle\nUnited States Navy\nTask Group 16.6 - RADM Charles McMorris, Commander, Task Group 16.6 (a subordinate Task Group of Task Force 16)\n* 1  heavy cruiser:  - CAPT Bertram J.
