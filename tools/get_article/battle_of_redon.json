The battle concluded with the triumph of the Chouans, who proceeded to occupy the town of Redon.\nPrelude\nIn October 1799, the Chouans of the Redon and Muzillac legion, attached to the  and commanded by , initiated a series of attacks on localities held by Republican forces. The campaign commenced with the capture of La Roche-Bernard on October 26. This was followed by the occupation of Nozay on the 27th, Bain on the 29th, and a return to La Roche-Bernard on November 2. Subsequently, they entered Muzillac without resistance on the 4th and Questembert on the 5th. De Sol abandoned his plans to attack Rochefort-en-Terre, which he deemed to be too well-defended, and instead decided to march on Redon.\nOn November 7, Captain Gely, the commanding officer in Redon, was informed that a considerable quantity of military supplies had been unloaded following a shipwreck and subsequently stored in Redon's warehouses. Gely dispatched a missive to General Roulland in Rennes to apprise him of the situation, but the letter was intercepted by the Chouans. Despite implementing security measures, including the concealment of the letter within the courier's cravat and the use of a decoy, the message was nevertheless discovered. Consequently, the Chouans were made aware of a considerable quantity of weapons and munitions in Redon.\nOn November 9, reports were filed concerning the presence of Chouans in Saint-Martin-sur-Oust, Fougerêts, and Glénac, situated to the northwest of the town.\nForces involved\nAt that time, the garrison at Redon consisted of 40 to 60 individuals, under the command of Captain Gely.\nIn the aftermath of the assaults on neighboring communities, Redon was placed under siege. All military provisions were stored within the church, and patrols were established. The town was encircled by medieval fortifications, yet these were in a state of disrepair and could not offer robust protection. In response, the Republicans constructed fortifications at Saint-Sauveur Abbey, the town hall, and in front of the tower. Four cannons and three small mortars were mounted at these locations.\nCaptain Gely estimated the royalist army under  to consist of 900 individuals, or 1,200 well-armed troops, including 30 to 40 deserters from the Republican army and 160 elite soldiers. In his report to the Minister of War, General Taponier augmented this figure to 2,000 or 3,000 troops.}}\nBattle\nThe assault commenced on November 10 at approximately 6 or 7 a.m. The Chouans infiltrated Redon from the north and west, resulting in a barrage of gunfire near the prison post.\nThe Republican soldiers were taken by surprise by the rapid attack and consequently abandoned their posts, seeking refuge in the Saint-Sauveur Abbey. Awakened by the gunfire, some of the townspeople also attempted to reach the abbey but were prevented from doing so by the Chouans, who ordered them to return home.\nHowever, the Chouans encountered a significant obstacle in their advance toward the abbey, as they did not have enough artillery. Two 4-pounder guns were unloaded from a ship docked in the port, but their caliber was insufficient to breach the buildings.\nAt approximately one o'clock in the afternoon, the fighting ceased, and at two o'clock, the Chouans transmitted a demand to the besieged, requesting the surrender of their weapons in exchange for the assurance of their safe departure with their belongings. Captain Gely convened his war council in the church, which rejected the proposal.\nDe Sol then gathered bundles of wood, straw, and tar, issuing threats to set fire to the houses near the monastery. In response to these threats, the Republicans ultimately surrendered after two additional hours of resistance. The defenders were permitted to depart freely with their arms and belongings, on the condition that they would refrain from further armed conflict with the royalists.}}\nCasualties\nThe Republican forces sustained a total of five fatalities, including three combat deaths, and five injuries, including three military personnel and two civilian volunteers.\nand Émile Sageret indicate that the Chouan forces sustained one fatality and four injuries, including Martin de la Plazette, also known as Dufresne, a member of De Sol's staff. Monique Souben asserts that the royalist casualties numbered four killed and approximately twelve wounded.\nConsequences\nFollowing the capture of Redon, the Chouans proceeded to seize the arsenal and the storehouse located within Saint-Sauveur Abbey and the adjacent church. This storehouse contained considerable military supplies, including 25,000 pounds of gunpowder, 1,200 pairs of shoes, 300 greatcoats, 200 pairs of boots, and numerous saddles. The Chouans disarmed two chasse-marée (coastal vessels) and destroyed the archives stored in the abbey house and three tax offices. Additionally, numerous local peasants joined De Sol de Grisolles' troops. The capitulation was honored, and the Republican prisoners were released. They departed the town at approximately 3 p.m. and proceeded to Bain-de-Bretagne.\nSee also\n* Battle of Redon (1815)\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*"
