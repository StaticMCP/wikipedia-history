The Kirton site was closed by the university in February 2009.\nThe Wellesbourne site covered an area of 191 hectares and contained protected crop facilities, glasshouses, a bioconversion unit, controlled environment units and laboratory facilities including the Genomic Resource Centre. The Kirton site spanned 50 hectares, with  seed handling equipment and a 4-hectare organic area.\nResearch at Warwick HRI included plant science, crop and environmental sciences, applied microbial sciences and applied horticulture. Postgraduate taught and research degrees were offered.\nIn November 2009, Warwick University announced that it had decided to close Warwick HRI as the centre was losing the university £2&nbsp;million a year. Warwick HRI was merged with the University's Department of Biological Sciences into a new School of Life Sciences in October 2010. Some research work on vegetable genetic improvement continued at the Crop Centre.\nReferences"
