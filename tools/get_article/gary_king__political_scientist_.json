He is the Albert J. Weatherhead III University Professor and Director for the Institute for Quantitative Social Science at Harvard University. King and his research group develop and apply empirical methods in many areas of social science research, focusing on innovations that span the range from statistical theory to practical application.\nBiography\nIn 1980, King graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the State University of New York at New Paltz. In 1981 he earned a Master of Arts degree and in 1984 a Doctor of Philosophy degree in political science at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in Madison.\nKing's career in academia began in 1984, when he became an assistant professor in the Department of Politics at New York University. He joined the faculty of Harvard's Department of Government in 1987 and has taught there since. He has also been a visiting fellow at Oxford University. To date, he has authored or coauthored eight books (six published and one forthcoming) and more than 175 journal articles and book chapters, and has won more than 55 prizes and awards for his work.\nIn 2009, Harvard named King a University Professor, its most distinguished professorial posting. The twenty-five University Professors have unique latitude to teach and work across any of Harvard's 13 constituent schools.\nHe is the step-brother of the sociologist Mitchell Duneier.\nBusiness\nKing co-founded the data analytics companies Crimson Hexagon and Learning Catalytics and the educational technology companies [https://perusall.com/ Perusall] and [http://theopenscholar.com/ OpenScholar].
