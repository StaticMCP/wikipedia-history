It was reported that the ship, a motorized bangka, was overloaded with passengers and cargo that led to it capsizing after making a sharp turn.\nKim Nirvana-B was rated to carry 178&nbsp;passengers and 16&nbsp;crew members, but had at least 220&nbsp;people on board at the time of the accident. Witnesses also reported that a large number of sacks of cement, rice and fertilizer were in the cargo area of the ship. Multiple murder charges were laid against the ferry's owner, captain and 17&nbsp;crew members following the accident.\nIn July 2015, the Maritime Industry Authority reported that calculations show overloading was not the cause of the ship's sinking and instead cited the \"negligent operations of the captain\".\nSee also\n* List of maritime disasters in the Philippines\n* List of maritime disasters in the 21st century\nReferences"
