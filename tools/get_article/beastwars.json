They disbanded in 1988. Hyde then moved to Australia, and then London. Aaron Carson in Auckland invited Hyde to try out for his new band, The Larry Normans. At around the same time Nathan \"Nato\" Hickey was an up and coming bass and guitar musician. Hickey was introduced to Clayton Anderson, a guitarist in metal bands. This is about the time Hickey began playing drums. Hickey had also discussed forming a band with James Woods, and brought him along. At some point Hyde met Hickey, and the beginning of Beastwars was underway. The band was formed in 2006, and played their first show as a four-piece unit in 2009.\nTheir 2011 self-titled debut album received positive reviews in the band's native country and invited musical comparisons to Soundgarden,\nMastodon, and Unsane, amongst others. The album also gained recognition for Nick Keller's cover design, winning the 2011 New Zealand Music Award for Best Album Artwork or Packaging. The band received a nomination for best New Zealand Rock Album at the same ceremony, but ultimately lost out to Ignite by Shihad. The album was also shortlisted for the 2012 Taite Music Prize.\nThe group has opened for Mastodon, High on Fire, Fu Manchu and Kyuss and in 2012 performed at the Auckland Big Day Out music festival alongside notable international acts such as Soundgarden, Röyksopp, and Kasabian. In 2011, a limited release custom-brewed beer was commissioned bearing the band's name.\nTheir second and fourth albums, Blood Becomes Fire and IV respectively, were shortlisted for the Taite Music Prize in 2014 and 2020.\nIn July 2023, the band announced that guitarist Christian Pearce would join the band to replace Clayton Anderson.\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n*Beastwars (Destroy Records/Universal Music, 2011)\n*Blood Becomes Fire (2013)\n*The Death of All Things (2016)\n*IV (2019)\n*Beastwars (10th Anniversary Remaster) (2021)\n*Tyranny of Distance (2023)\n*The Ship//The Sea (2025)\nLive Albums\n* Live at San Fran (2020)\nSingles\n* ''Cold Wind/When I'm King'' (2021)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtOqeCQUN5E Beastwars on YouTube]\n* [http://beastwars.bandcamp.com/ Bandcamp Page]"
