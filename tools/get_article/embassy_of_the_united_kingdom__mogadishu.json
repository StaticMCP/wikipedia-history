It was led by Ambassador Ben Fender. Kate Foster became the ambassador based in Mogadishu but there were no consular services.\nHistory\nFollowing Somalia's independence in 1960, Britain maintained an embassy in the national capital Mogadishu. The embassy later closed down in January 1991, after the start of the civil war. In the ensuing period, the British government maintained relations in absentia with the Transitional National Government and its successor the Transitional Federal Government. After the establishment of the Federal Government of Somalia in August 2012, the British authorities re-affirmed the UK's continued support for Somalia's government, its territorial integrity and sovereignty.\nOn 25 April 2013, the UK became the first European Union member state to re-open its embassy in the country since the establishment of the Federal Government of Somalia. British Foreign Secretary William Hague attended the opening ceremony in Mogadishu. The compound is situated near  the Aden Adde International Airport. Hague described the new embassy as a symbol of the close ties between the British and Somali governments, through which the administrations would work on bilateral security, peacebuilding and statebuilding.\nKate Foster was the ambassador based in Mogadishu in 2021 but there were no consular services. British nationals who needed this type of support in either Somalia or Somaliland were instructed to contact the British High Commission in Nairobi.\nMr Michael Nithavrianakis was appointed His Majesty’s Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Somalia, and took up his appointment in May 2023.\nSee also\n*Diplomatic missions of the United Kingdom\n*List of Ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Somalia\n*Somalia–United Kingdom relations\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
