He served as its life president from its inception in 1934 till his passing in 1952.\nHistory\nOrigins\nGideon Urhobo was influenced by some of the teachings of the Jehovah's Witnesses, but developed his own conviction in his mission after allegedly receiving a vision from Jesus Christ in 1934. He disagreed with certain teachings of the Jehovah's Witnesses, leading him to split from the organization and start his own Society in Lagos called \"the Lagos Division of Jehovah’s Witnesses\". He began to criticize not only the Jehovah's Witnesses' beliefs, but also the Muslim faith and mainline churches. He later renamed his group the \"Lagos Company of Christian People\" and expanded to Port Harcourt. The name was changed to the \"Nigerian Christian Society\" in 1942, and to God's Kingdom Society (GKS) in 1943.\nSuccession\nAfter the passing of Gideon Urhobo on February 25, 1952, his vice-president, Bro. Ebenezer T. Otomewo became the president of GKS. Under Otomewo, the Church spread to most cities in Nigeria and London. He died in April 1997.  Four years later, on September 1, 2001, Bro. Emmanuel Oseghale Aighalua (then aged 39) was installed as president. The third president was removed on March 18, 2011. On Sunday, March 27, 2016, Brother Godwin O. Ifeacho became the president and served until his passing on Thursday, April 22, 2021. On Sunday, February 27, 2022, Brother Felix Ekundayo Adedokun was installed as president.\nSplits\nGod's Kingdom Mission split from God's Kingdom Society on January 5, 1991, through the efforts of Brother Benjamin O. Tietie, who served as the first Archminister of the Mission.  Pastor David O. Amanoritsewo also broke away to form the Acceptable Christian Church, with similar doctrines as those of God's Kingdom Society (GKS).\nSpread\nThe God's Kingdom Society (GKS) spread from Warri in Delta State to many parts of Nigeria as a Christian movement with doctrines that resemble the Jehovah's Witnesses but with distinct differences in practices and mode of worship. It grew into hundreds of members by the 1950s. Saint Urhobo founded Church branches in Lagos (1934), Port Harcourt (1940), Warri, and Sapele (1942), followed by Onitsha (1946) and Aba (1948). It was involved in the struggle for the independence of Nigeria in the 1950s. By the 1960s, it grew to over 2,000 members.   GKS has grown to have followers in Nigeria, Liberia, Ghana, North America, Benin  and England.\nInterventions\nDuring the inter-ethnic crisis that shook Warri in 1998 and 2003, the God's Kingdom Society was instrumental in putting an end to the violence and brotherly war by issuing two distinct statements on Tuesday, November 17, 1998, and August 19, 2003.\nDoctrine of GKS\nThe majority of the Watchtower Society's liturgy and beliefs are observed by God's Kingdom Society, these include rejecting \"speaking in tongues,\"; defining the Holy Spirit as \"the invisible, active force of God,\"; believing that Jesus was born in October; avoiding interfaith relations; opposing racism, and only baptizing adults. God's Kingdom Society also accepts the idea that 144,000 chosen and anointed Christians will be selected to live and reign with Christ in heaven. But there are many differences. The Second Coming of Jesus Christ and the establishing of God's Kingdom on earth are highly valued concepts in God's Kingdom Society. Most notably, the G.K.S is not opposed to blood transfusion. The tale of G.K.S.'s battles with various movements and institutions is heavily influenced by both secular and religious factors. The Society holds that it has been tasked by God with exposing the \"false\" beliefs of other religious organizations and that it possesses the truth of God's word, which must be conveyed to all peoples. The G.K.S. is always prepared to combat atheism on behalf of God and its interpretation of Christianity. Because of this, the Society has occasionally engaged in polemics with politicians and their parties. The religious group has been known to observe a week-long Feast of Tabernacles. They do not celebrate Christmas.\nReferences"
