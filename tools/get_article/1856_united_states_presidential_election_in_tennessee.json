Voters chose twelve representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nTennessee voted for the Democratic candidate, James Buchanan, over American Party candidate Millard Fillmore. Buchanan won Tennessee by a margin of 4.36 percentage points, although Tennessee was Fillmore's third-strongest state after Maryland and Louisiana.\nRepublican Party candidate John C. Frémont was not on the ballot in the state.\nThis was the only instance between 1832 and 1872 when a Democrat won Tennessee. This is the most recent election in which Scott County, Hancock County, and Washington County voted for a Democratic presidential nominee, although the latter two counties would be won by Southern Democratic nominee John C. Breckinridge in the next election.\nResults\n}}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Tennessee\nReferences"
