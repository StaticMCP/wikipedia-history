He could paint landscape and flesh tones in the manner of Scorel, and travelled to Italy himself, spending time in Venice.

Adriaen Pietersz. Crabeth was his disciple who later surpassed him quite quickly in his art. This young Crabeth was the son of \"Cripple Pieter\" (Krepel Pieter).\nAccording to the RKD he was the teacher of Adriaen Pietersz Crabeth in Gouda c. 1535, after which period he moved to Antwerp.\nReferences\n*[http://www.artnet.com/artists/jan-swart-van-groningen/past-auction-results Jan Swart van Groningen] on Artnet"
