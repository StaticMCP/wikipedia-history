A member of the Republican Party, he represented the 48th district in the North Carolina Senate from 2016 to 2023.\nEarly life and education\nEdwards was born in Waynesville, North Carolina. He graduated from West Henderson High School in 1978 and studied business, accounting, and marketing at Blue Ridge Community College.\nCareer\nEdwards joined McDonald's in 1989, working as an operations manager until 1991, senior business consultant from 1991 to 1996, and development coordinator from 1996 to 1998. He also worked as the vice president of Henderson County Partners for Economic Progress. In 2013, he became a director of Entegra Financial Corporation. In 2020, Entegra merged with First Citizens Bank.\nEdwards was appointed to the North Carolina Senate in August 2016 after Tom Apodaca resigned. He defeated Democratic nominee Norman Bossert in 2016, and was reelected in 2018 and 2020. In 2024, Edwards held a ceremony and awarded Donald Trump with a French Fry Certification Pin, an award that he invented.\nActing on a complaint filed by the Henderson County (North Carolina) Democratic Party, Edwards was sanctioned by the House of Representatives Communications Standards Commission on April 24, 2024, for making personal attacks against President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, in email newsletters sent to constituents in May, June, July and December of 2023.  Such attacks are prohibited by federal law and by rules of the House of Representatives when they are sent out as \"mass communications\" at taxpayer expense.\nU.S. House of Representatives\nElections\n2022\nOn November 30, 2021, Edwards declared his candidacy for North Carolina's 11th congressional district in the 2022 election. The district was represented by freshman Republican incumbent Madison Cawthorn. Cawthorn faced numerous scandals, had made a number of controversial statements, and was criticized by Edwards as an ineffective legislator. Edwards was also endorsed by U.S. Senator Thom Tillis.\nOn May 17, 2022, Edwards defeated Cawthorn in the Republican primary with 33.4% of the vote. Although he lost 12 of the district's 15 counties, he carried Buncombe, its most populous, by over 2,000 votes, exceeding his overall margin of 1,338. Edwards also defeated Cawthorn in Henderson County by 3,191 votes. Henderson County is home to both Edwards and Cawthorn.\nCommittee assignments\nSource:\n* National Security, Department of State, and Related Programs Subcommittee (vice chair)\n* Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee\nCaucus memberships\nSource:\n* Congressional YIMBY Caucus (co-chair)\n* Congressional Aggregates Caucus\n* Congressional Fire Services Caucus\n* Congressional Pro-Life Caucus\n* Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus\n* Conservative Climate Caucus\n* Election Integrity Caucus\n* Fix Congress Caucus\n* Main Street Caucus\n* Problem Solvers Caucus\n* Republican Study Committee\nPolitical positions\nImmigration\nIn January 2024, Edwards introduced legislation which would prevent immigrants from being counted by the United States census, for the purposes of determining the United States congressional apportionment.
