In: Hermitage Museum. ]]\nNapoleon organized the , the largest army assembled up to that point in European history. After a whole day of preparation by Morand and Eblé, the invasion commenced on Midsummer, 24 June 1812 with Napoleon's army crossing the river. Half of them were foreigners; Polish legions formed the largest foreign contingent); 120,000 were conscripts. Within a few days, almost half a million men from this multinational army - split up into five columns - crossed the river Neman and entered the Russian Empire. The numbers mentioned below are based on estimates made by Clausewitz, in his book \"On War\" and not on the estimates in \"History of the Consulate and the Empire\" by Adolphe Thiers, who wrote that 600,000 men in total were moved but not all of them crossed the Neman. Meanwhile, an analysis of the documents shows that according to the schedules for May 1812, the army had at its disposal 674,024, which include 326,821 soldiers of non-French origin.\nCommander-in-Chief: Napoleon Bonaparte; Chief of Staff: Marshal Louis-Alexandre Berthier\nNorthern flank\n* X Corps (with the Prussian Corps) (30,000) commanded by Marshal Jacques MacDonald. They crossed the Niemen at Tilsit (now Sovetsk) on the 24th. He moved north in Courland but did not succeed in occupying Riga. Early August he occupied Dunaburg; early September he returned to Riga with his entire force. A few days after the French left Lithuania, he drew back to Königsberg, followed by Pyotr Wittgenstein. On 25 December Yorck (von Wartenburg) found himself isolated when the Russian army blocked the road during the retreat. After five days he was urged by his officers (and in the presence of Clausewitz) at least to neutralization of his troops and an armistice. According to Minard, about 6,000 men returned to Poland, according to Clausewitz 5,000 men, but Yorck's resolution had enormous consequences.\nFirst Central force\nUnder the Emperor's personal command it crossed the Niemen early in the morning of the 24th on three pontoon bridges (one for the 80,000 horses) nearby Napoleon's Hill. Afterwards, six corps  destined for Vilnius or Polotsk hunted after Barclay de Toll's First Army of the West.\n* Imperial Guard (33,000-56,169) commanded by Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bessières (Guard Cavalry); Marshal François Joseph Lefebvre (Old Guard); Marshal Edouard Mortier (Young Guard). The Guard did not take part in the fighting, but during the retreat, the Old Guard was the only unit that retained a semblance of order. The cavalry of the Guard was almost wiped out. About 7,000 Guards succeeded to arrive at the Berezina.\n** Attached to the Young Guard were many multinational units e.g. the Polish Legion of the Vistula under Michel Claparède (7,000), Velites of Turin and Florence, and a Spanish pioneer battalion. Only about 1,500 returned.\n** Grand Quartier, Headquarter's guard, Equipages, Artillery General Park, engineers and other services 14,000 (French, Swiss, Polish, Portuguese) there were attached few multinational units e.g. Portuguese chasseur à cheval, Polish Vistula Uhlan, Neuchâtel (Swiss) battalion.\n* I Corps (72,000-96,000) commanded by Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout. The strongest corps left Vilnius on 1 July, occupied Minsk, beat Bagration at Mogilev and with only 20,000 men left he went to Smolensk and joined the main army. Only 1,800 arrived at the Berezina.\n* II Corps (37,000-42,000) commanded by Marshal Nicolas Oudinot crossed the Niemen was sent to the other side of the Viliya and expected to join with McDonald to combat Wittgenstein, who protected the road to St Petersburg. This corps left mid-October after losing the Second Battle of Polotsk; it was joined by IX corps (reserve). Arriving at the Berezina before Wittgenstein they played a key role in securing the crossing of the river; Nicolas Joseph Maison took over. 300 were able to leave the country?\n* III Corps (40,000) commanded by Marshal Michel Ney. He defended downstream the 4th pontoon bridge at Aleksotas which could be used to escape; he then went to Polotsk. During the retreat his corps was in the rear. After being cut off from the main army in the Battle of Krasnoi Ney managed to escape in heavy fog and thin ice over the Dnieper River but without his artillery.\nReserve cavalry (vanguard)\nMarshal Joachim Murat, his brother-in-law, under King of Naples, followed with (21,000) Napoleon to Vilnius and Vitebsk\n* I Reserve Cavalry Corps (11,000) commanded by General Étienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty went to Polotsk\n* II Reserve Cavalry Corps (10,000) commanded by General Louis-Pierre Montbrun went to Polotsk\nSecond Central force\nIt followed behind the central force and (81,000) crossed at Pilona and avoided Vilnius\n* IV Corps (46,000) commanded by General Eugène de Beauharnais, Viceroy of the Kingdom of Italy. They crossed the Niemen 20&nbsp;km upstream near Piliuona. Unlike the I, II and III Corps Napoleon's stepson had orders to avoid Vilnius on his way to Vitebsk; only 1,600 arrived at the Berezina.\n* VI Corps (25,000 – 30,000) commanded by General Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr. They crossed at Pilona and moved east.  He went to Polotsk to attack Wittgenstein. When Oudinot was wounded in the Battle of Klyastitsy he took over command of the II corps; he retreated after the Second Battle of Polotsk.\n* III Reserve Cavalry Corps (10,000) commanded by General Emmanuel de Grouchy crossed as first the Dniepr at Mogilev\nRight flank force\n(C. Faber du Faur, 27.11.1812). ]]\nNapoleon's brother Jérôme Bonaparte King of Westphalia (62,000) crossed the Niemen near Grodno on 1 July, and moved towards Bagration's (second western) army. On the order of Napoleon Davout secretly took over the command on 6 July. In the Battle of Mir Jerome let Platov escape by deploying too few of Poniatowki's troops. Jérôme was sent to Slutsk but left the army after being criticised by Davout. He went home at the end of July, taking a battalion  of guards with him.[https://books.google.com/books?id=_KcxDwAAQBAJ&dq=Westphalien+troops+1812+Kassel+return&pg=PA275]Mustafa, S.A. (2017) Napoleon's Paper Kingdom: The Life and Death of Westphalia, 1807-1813, p. 252. Rowman & Littlefield Publishers Davout took over the command of Latour's cavalry, trying to prevent Bagration from moving north.\n* V Corps (36,000 Polish) commanded by General Józef Poniatowski. He joined Davout and went to Mogilev and Smolensk. Early November Zajączek took over the command but the corps ceased to exist after the Battle of Krasnoi; Dombrowski stayed around Minsk; 8,000 men arrived at the Berezina.\n* VIII Corps (17,000 Westphalians) under Vandamme. Early July Jérôme Bonaparte took over and Vandamme was sent home. Jérome resigned on 15 July when he found out Davout had been secretly given the command. Early August the command was given to Junot. Junot didn't take part in the Battle of Smolensk (1812) as he was sent to bypass the left flank of the Russian army, but then got lost. Junot was blamed for allowing the Russian army to retreat at the Battle of Valutino; General Rapp took over. After the Battle of Borodino the corps had only 2,000 men left. They were ordered to stay behind and clear up the site. At the end of the war 1,200 arrived in Poland.\n* IV Reserve Cavalry Corps (9,000) commanded by General Victor de Fay de La Tour-Maubourg joined Davout. Only 150 arrived at the Berezina\nWith French forces moving through different routes in the direction of Vitebsk, a first major engagement took place on 25 July at the Battle of Ostrowno.\n, where the Austrian army and Reynier crossed the river ]]\nSouthern flank\n* VII Corps (17,000) commanded by General Jean Reynier. He stayed in the Grodno region to protect the Duchy of Warsaw against Tormasow; on 26 December between 5 and 11,000 arrived in Poland.\n* XII Corps (with the Austrian Corps) (34,000) commanded by Field Marshal Karl von Schwarzenberg crossed the Bug on 2 July on a pontoon bridge to go after Bagration and Tormasow. He was prevented from joining up with Davout. The VII corps came under his command when Reynier fell back. When Tormassov occupied Brest (Belarus) at the end of July, he was cut off from supplies. On 18 September he withdrew when Pavel Chichagov arrived from the south. Schwarzenberg won the Battle of Wolkowisk. He crossed the Polish border on 14 December 1812. Many survived.\nReserve units in Poland and Prussia\nin the Louvre]]\n, December 3–4, 1812, Rijksmuseum ]]\nSeveral units marched to Russia in the late stage of the campaign. In November, the division of Durutte assisted Reynier. In December Loison was sent to help extricate the remnants of the Grand Army in its retreat. Within a few days many of Loison's unexperienced soldiers died of the extreme cold.\nNapoleon arrested him for not marching with his division to the front.\n* XI Corps (50,000) commanded by Marshal Pierre Augereau. This corps did not participate in military operations in Russia, and Augereau never left Berlin. Augereau also had at his disposal a division of 10,000 Danes under General Johann Ewald, which remained in Holstein for the duration of the campaign.\n* IX Corps (30,000 French) commanded by Marshal Claude Victor-Perrin. Early August his corps was in Tilsit, at the end of September the majority arrived at Smolensk;  At the end of October he took over the command from St. Cyr, but lost the Battle of Chashniki and the Battle of Smoliani and unable to retake Polotsk. He had orders to follow Oudinot; 3,500 arrived at the Berezina and fired the bridges behind them.\nIn addition, National Guard units had been conscripted for full military service defending the frontier of the Duchy of Warsaw. With these included total forces on the Russian border and in Russia came to around 685,000 men. This vast commitment of manpower severely strained the French Empire — especially considering that there were a further 220,000 French troops fighting in Iberia and over 100,000 more in Germany and Italy.\nNationalities\nAccording to Richard K. Riehn, the army is estimated to consist of:\n* 300,000 troops from the First French Empire\n** 255,000 French\n** 15,000 Dutch from the annexed Kingdom of Holland\n** 10,000 Flemish and Walloon from the annexed Belgium territories\n** 10,000 Germans from annexed Northern Germany and the left bank of the Rhine\n** 10,000 Italians from annexed Piedmont, Liguria, Tuscany, Parma and Rome\n* 108,000 Poles and Lithuanians\n** 67,000 Polish from the Duchy of Warsaw\n** 12,000 Polish National Guard, depot companies and garrisons in defence of Duchy of Warsaw\n** 10,000 Polish in French service (Vistula Legion, 8th Chevauleger-Lancer, 1st and 3rd Guard Chevauleger-Lancer)\n** 19,000 newly formed regiments during the campaign in Lithuania\n* 111,500 Germans from the Confederation of the Rhine\n** 29,000 Bavarians\n** 22,500 Saxons\n** 22,000 Westphalians (other German sources mention 28,000)\n** 12,000 Württembergers\n**  6,000 Badeners\n**  5,000 Bergers\n**  4,000 Hessians\n** 11,000 from other members of the Rhine Confederation\n*  27,000 Italians from the Kingdom of Italy\n*   8,000 Neapolitans the majority of whom never went to Russia, part were garrisoned in Danzig, and part was sent back to Naples\n*   9,000 Swiss (German sources mention 16,000)\n*   4,800 Spanish\n*   3,500 Croats\n*   2,000 Portuguese\n*   5,900 Illyrian, Dalmatian, and Mediterranean minorities\n*  20,000 Prussians.

The numbers on this chart have 422,000 crossing the Neman with Napoleon, 22,000 taking a side trip early on in the campaign, 100,000 surviving the battles en route to Moscow and returning from there; only 4,000 survive the march back, to be joined by 6,000 that survived that initial 22,000 in the feint attack northward; in the end, only 10,000 cross the Neman back out of the initial 422,000.\nAdam Zamoyski estimated that between 550,000 and 600,000 French and allied troops (including reinforcements) operated beyond the Niemen, of which as many as 400,000 troops died.\nRussian Imperial Army\nKazan Cathedral in Saint Petersburg.

He was field commander of the First Western Army and replaced by Mikhail Kutuzov who was appointed Commander-in-chief on 17th and arrived on the 29th of August. After the Battle at Borodino Kutuzov was appointed General Field Marshall, the highest military rank.\n* First Western Army under Emperor Alexander I with General of Infantry Mikhail Barclay de Tolly as a field commander numbered 104,250 men and 7,000 Cossacks with 558 guns.
