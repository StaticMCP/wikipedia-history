A Spanish army commanded by the Marquis de Bay was defeated by a Grand Alliance force under Guido Starhemberg.\nVictory allowed the Allies to enter Madrid, but lack of supplies forced them to retreat, while defeats at Brihuega in November and Villaviciosa in December effectively ended hopes of deposing Philip V of Spain.\nBackground\nThe 1710 campaign began on 15 May when a Spanish army led by Philip V and Villadarias, advanced on Balaguer. Allied Allied forces in Catalonia under Guido Starhemberg halted this attempt by blocking them from crossing the Segre river. Philip made another attempt in June, but was defeated at Almenar on 27 July and withdrew to Zaragoza, while Villadarias was replaced by the Marquis de Bay.\nAfter reaching Zaragoza on 9 August, de Bay positioned his troops with the river Ebro on his left and the Torrero heights to the right. On 15 August, an Allied cavalry attack was repulsed, followed by five days of minor skirmishes before the Allies crossed the Ebro in force on 19 August and were allowed to deploy during the night.\nBattle\n]]\nOrder of battle shows that the allies had thirty-seven battalions of infantry and forty-three squadrons opposed to the Spanish-Bourbon army of thirty-eight battalions and fifty-four squadrons. The Allied left, composed of Catalonian and Dutch troops, was led by the Count of Atalaya, the right by Stanhope, made up of British, Portuguese and Austrian cavalry, with Starhemberg in charge of the centre, mainly German, Austrian and Spanish infantry.\nby Sir Godfrey Kneller]]\nOn 20 August at 08:00 an artillery-duel started which lasted four hours  before Stanhope charged the Bourbon-Spanish left. At first the Spanish and Walloon troops of the Bourbon army seemed to gain the advantage, having defeated a body of eight Portuguese squadrons, which they chased from the field. This opened a gap in the Bourbon lines, which Stanhope exploited to rout the disorganized Spanish soldiers, while the attacks of the Bourbon army on the center and the right were repulsed.\nThe battle followed the same pattern as at Almenar: The allies first repulsed fierce Bourbon cavalry charges and then counter-attacked with their infantry, pushing the Spanish back. In less than three hours, the Allies army won a comprehensive victory, capturing the Bourbon artillery along with 73 standards. Between 5,000 or 6,000 Spanish soldiers were killed or wounded, and another 7,000 captured, with Allied losses estimated as 1,500 men dead or wounded.\nAftermath\nArchduke Charles entered Zaragoza the next day. The defeat of the army of Philip V of Spain was severe, the way to Madrid was open. Philip V abandoned Madrid on 9 September and went to Valladolid. Archduke Charles entered a very hostile and almost empty Madrid on 28 September. Charles commented: \"This city is a desert!\" In the winter of 1710, Archduke Charles and the allied troops had to abandon Madrid, due to the great opposition of the people of Madrid and the dangerous strategic situation. After this, the British army suffered a defeat at the Battle of Brihuega, and the rest of the allied army was defeated at the Battle of Villaviciosa.\nReferences\nSources\n* Kamen, Henry.
