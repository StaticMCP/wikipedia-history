He was a member of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews and finished in second place in the 1904 Amateur Championship contested at Royal St George's Golf Club in Sandwich, England. Although playing fine golf throughout, he eventually lost the final match to Walter Travis by the score of 4 and 3. He was known as a long hitter of the ball, often outdriving opponents by 50 yards or more. In 1898, Blackwell was described as probably the most consistently long driver the world had ever seen. As a result, his name became a household word among golfers.\nHis brothers—Sir Ernley Blackwell and Walter Blackwell—were also useful golfers, playing on several occasions in the Amateur Championship.\nEarly life\nBorn in 1866—the son of Surgeon-Major James Hay Blackwell, H.E.I.C.S., and his wife, Eliza Jane Robertson—he began to play as soon as he could walk and the advantage of this early commencement was seen in his excellent playing style: a full, free swing, characterized by commanding power. His early boyhood was spent in St Andrews where he attended Dr. Browning's School.  Before he left at age 13, he had won a prize with the score of 104. As a young man Blackwell had grown to a height of 6 feet, weighed , and had powerful forearms and wrists. Being a tall man, he preferred heavy clubs with long hickory shafts. His cleek was once described as \"a weaver's beam with an old boot at the end of it\".\n1904 Amateur championship\nIn the 1904 Amateur Championship, contested at Royal St George's Golf Club, Blackwell played well throughout the tournament but lost the final match 4 and 3 to the American player Walter Travis.\nDetails of play\nThe sky was overcast with occasional flurries of rain and a stiff, raw wind from the northeast greatly affected both Travis's and Blackwell's driving. The match was over 36 holes of golf.\nTravis won the first 18-hole match by the score of 5 and 6. On starting the second round, Travis pulled his second shot into the rough and was bunkered on his third shot. Blackwell played his second shot into the same bunker and took two strokes to recover, but he won the hole in six to seven. Travis won the next but lost the third, where he failed at a 15-foot putt for a halve in three. The American, however, was four up at the fourth where Blackwell was weak on the green. After a good drive, a solid iron shot to the green, and a 30-foot putt for a birdie three at the fifth, Travis stood five up. He proceeded to win the sixth but lost the seventh. The eight was halved. Travis lost the ninth and made the turn four up. The next five holes were halved, Travis going somewhat off his long game, but saving holes on the greens. Travis became dormie four, halved the next and won 4 and 3.\nAfter the match, Blackwell stated, \"Travis is a great golfer. I was a trifle off my game during the morning and lost several holes I ought to have won\".\n1911 Open Championship\nBlackwell was also a contestant in the 1911 Open Championship, which was the 51st Open Championship, held 26–30 June at Royal St George's Golf Club in Sandwich, England. British star Harry Vardon won the Championship for the fifth time after a playoff against the Frenchman Arnaud Massy. Blackwell led the first round scoring with a fine 71—with Michael Moran joined on 72 by J. H. Taylor—and finished tied for 21st.\nResults in major championships\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;text-align:center;\"\n!Tournament\n!1892\n!1893\n!1894\n!1895\n!1896\n!1897\n!1898\n!1899\n!1900\n!1901\n!1902\n!1903\n!1904\n!1905\n!1906\n!1907\n!1908\n!1909\n!1910\n!1911\n!1912\n!1913\n!1914\n|-\n|align=left|The Open Championship\n|T13\n|DNP\n|DNP\n|DNP\n|DNP\n|DNP\n|36\n|DNP\n|DNP\n|DNP\n|DNP\n|DNP\n|T27\n|WD\n|DNP\n|DNP\n|DNP\n|DNP\n|WD\n|T21\n|DNP\n|41\n|DNP\n|-\n|align=left|The Amateur Championship\n|DNP\n|DNP\n|DNP\n|DNP\n|DNP\n|DNP\n|DNP\n|DNP\n|DNP\n|R128\n|R128\n|R32\n|style=\"background:yellow;\"|2\n|style=\"background:yellow;\"|QF\n|R32\n|style=\"background:yellow;\"|QF\n|DNP\n|R64\n|R64\n|R128\n|R32\n|R64\n|style=\"background:yellow;\"|R16\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;text-align:center;\"\n!Tournament\n!1920\n!1921\n!1922\n!1923\n!1924\n!1925\n!1926\n!1927\n!1928\n!1929\n!1930\n|-\n|align=left|The Amateur Championship\n|R64\n|style=\"background:yellow;\"|R16\n|DNP\n|R64\n|R256\n|R128\n|DNP\n|R128\n|DNP\n|R256\n|R128\n|}\nNote: Blackwell played only in The Open Championship and The Amateur Championship.\nDNP = Did not play\nWD = Withdrew\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place\nR256, R128, R64, R32, R16, QF, SF = Round in which player lost in match play\nYellow background for top-10\nSources\nSource for Open Championship: [http://www.opengolf.com/en/History/PreviousOpens.aspx?eventid=2003040&view= www.opengolf.com]\nSource for 1901 Amateur: [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19010508&printsec=frontpage&hl=en The Glasgow Herald, 8 May 1901, pg. 8.]\nSource for 1902 Amateur: [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19020430&printsec=frontpage&hl=en The Glasgow Herald, 30 Apr 1902, pg. 10.]\nSource for 1903 Amateur: [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19030521&printsec=frontpage&hl=en The Glasgow Herald, 21 May 1903, pg. 13.]\nSource for 1905 Amateur: [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19050526&printsec=frontpage&hl=en The Glasgow Herald, 26 May 1905, pg. 10.]\nSource for 1906 Amateur: [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19060524&printsec=frontpage&hl=en The Glasgow Herald, 24 May 1906, pg. 8.]\nSource for 1907 Amateur: [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19070531&printsec=frontpage&hl=en The Glasgow Herald, 31 May 1907, pg. 13.]\nSource for 1909 Amateur: [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19090526&printsec=frontpage&hl=en The Glasgow Herald, 26 May 1909, pg. 14.]\nSource for 1910 Amateur: [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19100601&printsec=frontpage&hl=en The Glasgow Herald, 1 Jun 1910, pg. 10.]\nSource for 1911 Amateur: [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19110531&printsec=frontpage&hl=en The Glasgow Herald, 31 May 1911, pg. 10.]\nSource for 1912 Amateur: [http://la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/AmericanGolfer/1912/ag83d.pdf The American Golfer, July, 1912, pg. 199.]\nSource for 1913 Amateur: [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19130528&printsec=frontpage&hl=en The Glasgow Herald, 28 May 1913, pg. 15.]\nSource for 1914 Amateur: [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19140522&printsec=frontpage&hl=en The Glasgow Herald, 22 May 1914, pg. 14.]\nSource for 1920 Amateur:  [http://la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/AmericanGolfer/1920/ag2317i.pdf The American Golfer, June 19, 1920, pg. 9.]\nSource for 1921 Amateur:  [http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/AmericanGolfer/1921/ag2411e.pdf The American Golfer, June 4, 1921, pg. 24.]\nSource for 1923 Amateur: [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19230510&printsec=frontpage&hl=en The Glasgow Herald, 10 May 1923, pg. 15.]\nSource for 1924 Amateur: [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19240527&printsec=frontpage&hl=en The Glasgow Herald, 27 May 1924, pg. 3.]\nSource for 1925 Amateur: [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19250526&printsec=frontpage&hl=en The Glasgow Herald, 26 May 1925, pg. 15.]\nSource for 1927 Amateur: [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19270525&printsec=frontpage&hl=en The Glasgow Herald, 25 May 1927, pg. 4.]\nSource for 1929 Amateur: [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19290612&printsec=frontpage&hl=en The Glasgow Herald, 12 Jun 1929, pg. 14.]\nSource for 1930 Amateur: [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19300528&printsec=frontpage&hl=en The Glasgow Herald, 28 May 1930, pg. 4.]\nTeam appearances\n*England–Scotland Amateur Match (representing Scotland): 1902 (winners), 1904 (winners), 1905 (winners), 1906 (winners), 1907 (winners), 1909 (winners), 1910, 1912 (winners), 1923 (winners), 1924, 1925\n*Coronation Match (representing the Amateurs): 1911\nSee also\n*Players of the Period—Mr. Edward Blackwell\nReferences"
