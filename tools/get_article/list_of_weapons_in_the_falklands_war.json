However, hits from three Sea Skua missiles badly damaged the Argentine tug ARA Alferez Sobral.\n* Nord SS.11 (Scout)\n* Nord AS.12 (Wasp, Wessex) - A French light anti-ship missile, fired from Westland Wasp helicopters. Like the Sea Skua, its small 28&nbsp;kg warhead meant that it could not destroy ships outright; however, it could disable smaller vessels. On 25 April 1982 it contributed towards damaging and disabling the Argentine Submarine the ARA Santa Fe. A total of nine missiles were fired at the submarine trapped on the surface by anti-submarine torpedoes circling just under the hull. Of the missiles fired four hit, four missed and one failed to launch. Two of the missiles that hit the target failed to detonate on impact, instead punching a hole through the slender conning tower and exploding on the far side.\nBombs\n* GBU-48 Enhanced Paveway II (Harrier)\n* BL755 (Sea Harrier, Nimrod)\n* 1,000 lb General-Purpose Bomb (Vulcan, Harrier, Sea Harrier)\nTorpedoes and Depth Charges\n* Mk. 46 torpedo (Nimrod, Sea King, Wasp)\n* Mk. 11 depth charge (Nimrod, Sea King)\nShips\nArgentina\nArgentine Navy\nSubmarines\n* Balao-class submarine (ARA Santa Fe)\n* Type 209 submarine (ARA San Luis)\nAircraft carriers\n* [[Colossus-class aircraft carrier|1942 Design Royal Navy Light Fleet Carrier [Colossus]] (ARA Veinticinco de Mayo)\nAmphibious warfare ships\n* ARA Cabo San Antonio\nCruisers\n* Brooklyn-class cruiser (ARA General Belgrano)\nDestroyers\n* Gearing-class destroyer (ARA Comodoro Py)\n* Allen M.

It proved unable to engage low-altitude targets, such as Argentine A4 Skyhawk aircraft and Exocet missiles. However, it did achieve several long-range kills.\n* Sea Cat\nLand-based surface-to-air missiles\n* Roland - Argentine forces deployed a single launcher to defend Stanley airport; it succeeded in shooting down one Sea Harrier (XZ456) on 1 June 1982 above 10,000 feet (3000 m). The presence of the launcher forced British aircraft to operate above its envelope – typically at 18,000 feet (5,500 m) which severely reduced the accuracy of bombs dropped on the airport. The single Roland unit was later shipped back to Britain for analysis and testing.\n* Tiger Cat - Argentine land forces had a total of 7 Tigercat missile launchers (Ex RAF); there were several near misses, and possibly one Sea Harrier had its engine damaged by shrapnel from one of the missiles.\nUnited Kingdom\nNaval surface-to-air missiles\n* Sea Dart - British naval medium-range surface-to-air missile. It proved unable to engage low-altitude targets, such as Argentine A4 Skyhawk aircraft and Exocet missiles. However, it did achieve several long-range kills.\n* Sea Wolf - British naval short-range low-altitude surface-to-air missile, used to complement the longer-range Sea Dart. It proved capable of engaging low-flying aircraft.\n* Sea Cat\n* Sea Slug -  Long range, high altitude anti-aircraft missile system of the 1950s, was not used against aircraft but for bombardment of positions near Port Stanley by the Royal Navy ships equipped with it.\nLand-based surface-to-air missiles\n* Rapier - British surface-to-air missile developed for the British Army to replace their towed Bofors 40/L70 anti-aircraft guns. Its presence acted as a deterrent, especially after the deployment of Blind Fire systems around Port San Carlos.\n* Tiger Cat\nAnti-ship\nArgentina\nLand-based surface-to-surface missiles\n* Aérospatiale AM.39 Exocet (improvised)\nElectronic warfare and communications\nArgentina\n* AN/TPS-43\n* AN/TPS-44\n* Skyguard\n* Super Fledermaus\n* RASIT\nUnited Kingdom\n* Blindfire\n* Clansman\nArtillery and mortars\nArgentina\nArtillery\n* CITER 155 mm L33 gun\n* OTO Melara Mod 56\nMortars\n* 60 mm Mortar\n* 81 mm Mortar\n* 120mm  Mortar\nUnited Kingdom\nArtillery\n* L118 light gun\nMortars\n* L16 81mm mortar\nVehicles\nArgentina\n* LVTP-7\n* LARC-V\n* Panhard AML-90\n* KrAZ-256\n* Mercedes-Benz MB 1112/13/14\n* Mercedes-Benz G-Class\n* Unimog\nUnited Kingdom\n* FV101 Scorpion\n* FV106 Samson\n* FV107 Scimitar\n* Centurion BARV\n* Bandvagn 202\n* Land Rover 101 Forward Control\n* Land Rover 101 Forward Control Ambulance\n* Land Rover Series IIA\n* Land Rover Series III ((88 and 109 inch)\n* Land Rover Series III Ambulance\n* Bedford MK\n* Eager Beaver Air Portable Fork Lift Truck\n* Can-Am Bombardier Motorcycle\n* Muir-Hill Loader\n* Leyland 4-tonne truck\n* Alvis Stalwart\nInfantry weapons\nArgentina\nPistols\n* Browning Hi-Power\n* M1911A1 pistol\n* Colt Argentine Model 1927\n* Ballester–Molina\nSubmachine guns\n* PAM-1\n* PAM-2\n* FMK-3\n* Halcón ML-63\n* Uzi\n* L34A1 Sterling (Suppressed)\nRifles\n* FN FAL 50.61\n* Beretta BM-59E\n* M14 rifle\n* M16A1 rifle\n* CAR-15\n* FN-49\n* Mauser Modelo Argentino 1909\nMachine guns\n* FN FAL 50.41\n* FN MAG\n* M2 Browning\n* M1919 Browning (Even local copy being used)\nAnti-tank\n* Model 1968 recoilless gun\n* M67 recoilless rifle\n* Instalaza M65\nAnti-air\n* 9K32 Strela-2 (SA-7 Grail)\n* Blowpipe\nGrenades\n* FMK-2\n* M67 grenade\n* EA-M5 grenade\n* PAF 62 FMK-2 rifle grenade\n* PDEF 40 FMK-3 rifle grenade\n* Instalaza Model 63 rifle grenade\n*LM-2 underwater grenade (anti-swimmer depth charge)\nAnti-personnel mines\n* FMK-1\n* SB-33\n* No. 4\n* P4B\nAnti-tank mines\n* C3B\n* FMK-3\n* M1\n* No. 6\n* SB-81\nUnited Kingdom\nPistols\n* L9A1 Browning\n* L47A1 Walther\nSubmachine guns\n* L34A1 Sterling (Suppressed)\n* L2A3 Sterling\n* L92A1 HK\nRifles\n* L1A1 SLR\n* M16A1 rifle\n* Colt CAR-15 Commando\n* L42A1 sniper rifle\n* Parker-Hale M82\n* L74A1 Remington\nMachine guns\n* L7A2 GPMG\n* Enfield L4A4 Bren\n* L2A1 HMG\nGrenade launchers\n* M203 grenade launcher\n* M79 grenade launcher\nAnti-tank\n* MILAN anti-tank guided missile\n* L1A1 Rocket 66&nbsp;mm HEAT\n* L6 WOMBAT\n* L14A1 Carl Gustav recoilless rifle\nAnti-air\n* FIM-92 Stinger\n* Blowpipe\nReferences\n* Falklands Air War, Chris Hobson,\n* Hispano-Argentina (HAFDASA Manufacturing, Argentina)"
