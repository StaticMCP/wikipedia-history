The Georgia General Assembly chose 9 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.\nDuring this time, political divisions in the state fell along the lines of personal support for outstanding leaders in their struggle for power. Many of these factions were usually held together through personal friendships and family associations. The two factions at the time were the Clark faction, followers of Ex-Governor John Clark, and the Crawford faction, followers of Secretary of the Treasury William H. Crawford.\nAs both houses of the assembly were controlled by the Crawford party, their slate won by a margin of 121 to 45 against the Clark party which nominated Andrew Jackson.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1824 United States presidential election in Georgia\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#008000; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic-Republican\n| William H.
