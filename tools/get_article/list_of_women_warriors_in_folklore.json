The name Kali comes from kāla, which means black, time, death, lord of death, and thus another name for Shiva. Kali means \"the black one\".  Although sometimes presented as dark and violent, her earliest incarnation as a figure of annihilation still has some influence. In Kāli's most famous myth, Durga and her assistants, the Matrikas, wound the demon Raktabija, in various ways and with a variety of weapons in an attempt to destroy him.  They soon find that they have worsened the situation, for, with every drop of blood that is spilled from Raktabija, he reproduces a clone of himself.  The battlefield becomes increasingly filled with his duplicates. Durga, in need of help, summons Kāli to combat the demons.  It is said, in some versions, that the Goddess Durga actually assumes the form of Goddess Kāli at this time. Kali destroys Raktabija by sucking the blood from his body and putting the many Raktabija duplicates in her gaping mouth. Pleased with her victory, Kali then dances on the field of battle, stepping on the corpses of the slain. Her consort Shiva lies among the dead beneath her feet, a representation of Kali commonly seen in her iconography as Daksinakali.\n* Other warrior goddesses include Chamunda (\"the killer of demon Chanda and Munda\") and the goddess group Matrikas (\"Mothers\").\n*Vishpala (in The Rigveda) is a warrior queen who, after having lost a leg in battle had an iron prosthesis made.
