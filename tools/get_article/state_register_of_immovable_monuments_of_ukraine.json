An object of cultural heritage added to the register is known as a monument.\nOverview\nThe registry was established as early as 1960s. It was established according to article 5 of the second protocol to the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, which provides for the establishment of national registers of cultural property.\nThe list is split by regions including cities with special status. There are two types of lists of immovable monuments: national significance and of local significance. The items are also classified as monuments of archaeology, history, monumental art, architecture, urban planning, garden-park art, landscape, science and technology, or any combination of the above.\nSee also\n* List of historic reserves in Ukraine\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://e-pamiatka.gov.ua/ Official Register of Immovable Monuments]\n* [https://mcsc.gov.ua/kulturna-spadshchyna/derzhavnyy-reiestr-nerukhomykh-pam-iatok-ukrainy/ Register of Immobile Monuments on the website of the Ministry of Culture]\n* [http://zakon1.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/928-2009-%D0%BF/page List of object of cultural heritage] (official document)\n* [http://zakon1.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/1805-14 Law of Ukraine \"About Protection of the Cultural Heritage\"] (official document)"
