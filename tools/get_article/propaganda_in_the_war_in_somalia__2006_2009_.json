These include assertions of falsification of the presence or number of forces involved, exaggeration or minimisation of the casualties inflicted or taken, influence or control of media outlets (or shutting them down), and other informational means and media to sway popular support and international opinion.\nLow literacy rates in Somalia, estimated at between 17% and 19%, also greatly impact the effect of propaganda within the country (see related article on literacy in Somalia).\nClaims of propaganda\nReferring to the UN Security Council resolution to support IGASOM, a Kenyan diplomat said, \"Unfortunately, the [U.N.] resolution was sponsored by the United States, and it will be used by the Courts as a propaganda tool. But at least there's a window.\" Muslims also were considered to believe US claims of Al Qaeda activity was part of a propaganda campaign waged by Washington:\nIn her most blunt assessment yet, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Jendayi Frazer last week accused the Islamic council of being controlled by \"East Africa Al Qaeda cell individuals.\"\nIslamists dismiss such allegations as Western propaganda, though some concede that the council is struggling to strike a balance between its moderate and fundamentalist factions.\nAl Qaeda, for their part, have not been silent on the issue. On July 1, 2006, a Web-posted audio message purportedly recorded by Osama bin Laden urged Somalis to build an Islamic state in the country, and warned all nations that his al Qaeda network would fight against them if they intervened there.\nExternal powers such as Ethiopia and Eritrea have also been accused of propaganda to drum up domestic support for the conflict. Eritrea even claims the assertions it has troops involved in Somalia is part of a disinformation campaign being waged against it by Ethiopia. Once the TFG and Ethiopian troops advanced into areas previously controlled by the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), there were allegation of rape, robbery and massacre committed by the Ethiopian troops which the TFG claimed were false accusations by ICU supporters for the consumption of Human Rights organizations.\nClaims of troops and casualties\nOne of the greatest debates has been over the presence or quantity of troops of the various external powers involved. There were various claims of involvement of Ethiopia before its open admission of presence in Somalia, as well as speculation and arguments about the quantity of troops both before and after the admission. One claim by the ICU put the number of Ethiopian troops at 35,000. Ethiopia consistently insisted it had a \"few hundred\" advisors in the country until it increased its admission to \"3,000 - 4,000.\" Independent claims put Ethiopian strength at anywhere between 8,000 and 20,000. Eritrea consistently denies presence of any troops in the country, though the TFG and Ethiopia both consistently accuse it of having up to 2,000 troops in Somalia. Other assertions include a wide range of other nations contributing troops, from Uganda to Islamic nations from which mujahideen have volunteered.\nCasualty reports have also conflicted, where one side might claim to have lost only a few troops while the opponent claimed to have inflicted hundreds. The positions of advance have also been disputed, such as one report where the ICU claimed to be within 10&nbsp;km of Baidoa; the government denied the ICU had advanced that far. Such claims and counter-claims have been common in the conflict.\nMedia manipulation and repression\nMedia manipulation, including the arrest of journalists (such as the September arrest of Radio Simba journalist Osman Adan Areys) and journalist union leaders, has been an issue in ICU-controlled areas of the country. The ICU also shut down East Africa (Mogadishu) and HornAfrik (Kismayo) radio stations.\nOn the other side, the TFG was accused of shutting down FM Radio Warsan in Baidoa in 2006 and again in January 2007 and arresting numerous journalists attempting to report on Ethiopian troops in Baidoa. In November 2007, the federal government and Ethiopian troops were crawling down of freedom of press.\nOn January 15, 2007, the TFG closed the radio stations for Shabelle Radio, Horn Afrik, IQK, and the television station Al-Jazeera in Mogadishu, without stating a reason. Later, it was said the radio stations had ties to the Ayr clan, which supported the Islamic Courts, and, according to government spokesman Abdirahman Dinari, had broadcast reports about government soldiers: \"They said our soldiers were looting the markets and harassing people, which was totally untrue... They are using the media to undermine the government. They have been doing this for months.\" An employee of one of the broadcasters said the government \"doesn't want free media that really give people the real information. They want distorted information... they don't want us to say the Ethiopian armies are supporting the government.\" The media ban was lifted the next day, on January 16.\nIran media\nThe Iran state funded news agency, Press TV, has been accused of spreading propaganda by Ethiopians, using the term \"intentional errors\" to describe reporting on several issues from a pro-Insurgent point of view, a claim taken up by many media organizations in the west.\nSee also\n*Internet censorship and surveillance in Somalia\n*List of journalists killed during the Somali civil war\n*Media of Somalia\n*Somali Civil War\n*War in Somalia (2006–2009)\n*War in Somalia (2009–present)\nReferences"
