President Anote Tong, who was re-elected to parliament in the first round of the parliamentary election, sought another term as president. At the first parliamentary session, four candidates were chosen to appear on the ballot: Anote Tong, Patrick Tatireta, Timon Aneri, and Nabuti Mwemwenikarawa. Opposition nominees Harry Tong (Anote Tong's brother) and Tetaua Taitai were excluded from the ballot, upon which the opposition called for a boycott of the election.\nConsequently, voter turnout was just above 50%. Tong received more than 15,500 votes, Mwemwenikarawa received over 8,000 votes, and Tatireta and Anera received less than 400 votes each.\nResults\nReferences"
