The power station is owned and operated by NTPC Limited, India's largest power generation utility. With a planned ultimate capacity of 3,200 MW (4×800 MW), it is one of the major supercritical thermal power projects in central India.\nAs of 2024, Stage-I of the project, comprising two units of 800 MW each (total 1,600 MW), is fully operational and in commercial operation. Stage-II, consisting of an additional two units of 800 MW each, received investment approval from the NTPC Board in November 2024.\nHistory\nPlanning and approval\nThe Gadarwara Super Thermal Power Project was conceived as part of NTPC's expansion plan during India's 12th Five-Year Plan period to add over 14,000 MW of capacity. The project received environmental clearance from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) on 22 March 2013.\nThe foundation stone for the project was laid in February 2014 with an initial cost estimate of approximately 25,000 crore (US$3.4 billion). NTPC awarded the EPC contract to Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) for the execution of Stage-I of the project.\nConstruction and commissioning\nThe first unit (800 MW) achieved grid synchronization on 30 August 2018 at 05:12 AM IST, marking a significant milestone in the project's development. The unit was declared in commercial operation on 30 April 2019, with the revised cost estimate for Stage-I finalized at 15,105.22 crore.\nThe second unit (800 MW) was included in the installed capacity on 18 February 2021 and declared in commercial operation on 1 March 2021. With the commissioning of both units, NTPC's commercial capacity reached 52,115 MW, and the NTPC Group's total capacity reached 64,880 MW as of March 2021.\nStage-II development\nThe Stage-II expansion (2×800 MW) received investment approval of 20,445.69 crore from the NTPC Board on 5 November 2024. The expansion was initially proposed to the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) in March 2024 but required additional environmental information. A revised proposal was submitted in August 2024, and tendering for the project commenced in early 2025.\nDesign and specifications\nTechnology\nThe Gadarwara Super Thermal Power Station employs supercritical technology, which operates at higher pressures and temperatures compared to conventional subcritical plants. This technology results in improved thermal efficiency of approximately 38–40% and reduced greenhouse gas emissions per unit of electricity generated.\nEquipment and manufacturing\nBHEL's comprehensive scope for Stage-I included the design, engineering, manufacturing, supply, erection, and commissioning of major equipment including:\n* Supercritical boilers\n* Steam turbines rated at 800 MW\n* Generators\n* Electrostatic precipitators (ESPs)\n* Controls and instrumentation systems\n* Associated auxiliaries\nThe equipment was manufactured at various BHEL facilities across India, including Trichy (boilers), Haridwar (turbines), Bhopal (auxiliaries), Ranipet (transformers), Hyderabad (control systems), and Jhansi (boiler auxiliaries).\nPerformance\nThe plant is designed to operate at a Plant Load Factor (PLF) of 90%, ensuring high availability and efficient power generation. Both operational units utilize advanced emission control systems to meet India's stringent environmental norms.\nCapacity\nThe project is being developed in two stages:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The plant requires approximately 8 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of coal at 90% PLF for its ultimate capacity. The Talaipalli coal block has received environment and forest clearances for coal mining operations.\nWater supply\nWater for the power station is sourced from the Narmada River, located approximately 30 kilometers from the project site. A dedicated pipeline has been laid from the river to the plant site. The Madhya Pradesh Water Resources Department constructed a small weir on the river to ensure adequate water supply without causing submergence of agricultural lands.\nLand acquisition\nLand details\nAccording to the Environmental Clearance dated 22 March 2013, the total land requirement for the project is 1,990 acres (approximately 805 hectares). As of 2024, a total of 2,250.40 acres (910.706 hectares) has been acquired for the project.\nThe land acquisition comprised:\n* Barren government land: 318 acres (transferred by Government of Madhya Pradesh)\n* Government agricultural land: 45 acres\n* Private agricultural land: 1,580 acres (acquired from local farmers)\n* Other government land: 47 acres\nAffected villages\nThe land acquisition affected six villages in the Gadarwara region:\n# Chor Barhata\n# Dongargaon\n# Gangai\n# Kudari\n# Mehra Kheda\n# Umaria\nApproximately 500 farmers from these villages were affected by the land acquisition process.\nEnvironmental and social issues\nFarmer protests\nThe project has faced significant opposition from local farmers since land acquisition began in 2013. Major protests erupted in December 2017, with farmers alleging broken promises regarding employment opportunities made during the land acquisition phase.\nOn 12 January 2018, farmers held protests and submitted a memorandum demanding jobs for displaced families. Protests continued for over 15 days, with a massive agitation planned for New Delhi on 23 February 2018. Intermittent protests have continued through subsequent years regarding rehabilitation and employment issues.\nEnvironmental concerns\nLocal communities have reported several environmental impacts:\n* Fly ash from the plant affecting nearby agricultural lands\n* Reduction in crop production due to ash pollution\n* Groundwater pollution in surrounding areas\n* Declining groundwater levels\n* Respiratory health issues among the local population due to coal dust\nNTPC has placed warnings on hand pumps in affected villages indicating that water is not potable, forcing villagers to use contaminated water sources.\nCorporate social responsibility\nNTPC committed to a one-time investment of 45.60 crore for CSR activities during the construction phase and an annual commitment of 9.2 crore for development work in affected villages. However, local advocacy groups and civil society organizations have raised concerns about inadequate implementation of these commitments.\nCurrent operations and future expansion\nAs of 2024, both units of Stage-I (1,600 MW) are fully operational and contribute to the national power grid. The power generated from the station helps meet the energy demands of central India and supports the country's industrial and economic growth.\nStage-II development is progressing with investment approval secured and tendering processes underway. Upon completion of Stage-II, the Gadarwara Super Thermal Power Station will achieve its ultimate capacity of 3,200 MW, making it one of the largest thermal power generation facilities in Madhya Pradesh.\nThe project is part of NTPC's broader plan to add approximately 13.6 GW of thermal capacity by fiscal year 2026-27, supporting India's target of adding 80 GW of thermal power capacity by 2031-32.\nSee also\n* NTPC Limited\n* List of power stations in India\n* Supercritical steam generator\n* Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited\n* List of coal power stations\n* Energy in India\nReferences\nCitations\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\nExternal links\n* [https://www.ntpc.co.in Official website of NTPC Limited]\n* [http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Gadarwara_Super_Thermal_Power_Project Gadarwara Super Thermal Power Project] at SourceWatch\n* [https://www.bhel.com Official website of BHEL]"
