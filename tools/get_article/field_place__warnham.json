      "text": "# Field Place, Warnham\n\nField Place is a Grade I listed house in Warnham, West Sussex, England. It is the birthplace of the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, born there in 1792.\nThe house dates back to the thirteenth and fourteenth-centuries. It has been restored to the state it was in when Shelley lived there.\nField Place was built in about 1353 by Richard Felde, and this part is now the east wing. It was later owned by the Mychel family who had added the south wing by 1525. In 1729, it was bought by Edward Shelley. On his death, the house was inherited by his nephew Sir Timothy Shelley (1753–1844), and the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792–1822) was his eldest son. The farm buildings and much of the land is now owned separately. Percy Bysshe Shelley spent his youth at Field Place, but never lived there as an adult. His son Sir Percy Shelley, 3rd Baronet (1819–1889) inherited the property.\nG N Charrington, who had been a tenant, acquired the property in 1929, and restored the gardens by 1949. In 1982, Kenneth Pritchard Jones bought the house and restored it.\nReferences"
