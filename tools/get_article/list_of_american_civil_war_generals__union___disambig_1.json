Many commissions were antedated. Dates of rank were assigned for seniority purposes. Because of this, such \"ranks\" could be dated before the actual appointment, leading to confusion in some sources as to the actual effective date of the commission. This list currently shows the date of rank as the date of the promotion rather than the date of commission.\nOfficers receiving only brevet general appointments should be on the List of American Civil War brevet generals (Union) and not on this list. Brevet appointments went through the same process of appointment, nomination, confirmation and commission as the substantive grade officers. If a full grade brigadier general received a later brevet major general appointment, that appointment also may be placed in the notes on this list.\nAll but 58 brevet general appointments were made postwar but, just as many regular substantive grade appointments were backdated, many of the brevet grade appointments were backdated, mostly \"to rank from\" March 13, 1865. President Abraham Lincoln signed only 58 brevet general commissions before his death on April 15, 1865. Eicher notes that the odd order of grade (commission) date and rank date is especially present for brevet appointments which were actually issued mostly in 1866 to as late as 1869. Eicher also notes that most brevet appointments were backdated to March 13, 1865.\nIn addition to their names and grades, there is a small set of notes after every entry which may list Medal of Honor or Thanks of Congress citations, West Point graduation dates, important political or Army offices held, retirements or deaths during the war (whether in action or other means) and other unique facts pertaining to this article (i.e. youngest general, last surviving general, etc.). For all other information on their lives and accomplishments of these generals, please refer to their individual articles which have links from the list.\nNote on abbreviations:\n*MOH: Medal of Honor\n*CSA: Confederate States Army\n*DOW: Died of wounds\n*GAR: Grand Army of the Republic\n*KIA: Killed in action\n*MOLLUS: Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States\n*USA: United States Army (Regular Army) (appointment or brevet)\n*USMA: United States Military Academy\n*USN: United States Navy\n*USV: United States Volunteers (appointment or brevet)\n*VRC: Veteran Reserve Corps officer\nA\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Image !!
