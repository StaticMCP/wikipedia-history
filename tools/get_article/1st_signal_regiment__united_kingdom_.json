From 1905 to 1960, the regiment title changed several times, for example, from 1st Divisional Signal Company to 1st Divisional Signal Regiment. As a result of the 1957 Defence White Paper, the regiment was re-titled as 1st Division Headquarters and Signal Regiment, and moved to Verden in 1978. In 1993, as a result of the Options for Change force reductions, 1st Armoured Division disbanded, reforming as HQ Lower Saxony District.\nAfter the Army 2020 Refine reforms the regiment was titled as 1 Signal Regiment, and fell under operational command of 11th Signal Brigade. Under Army 2020 Refine, the regiment will support the 20th Armoured Infantry Brigade as a close support signal communications regiment.  By 2025, the regiment will move from its current location at MOD Stafford to Swinton Barracks in Perham Down, thereby co-locating with the remainder of the regular units of 7th Signal Group.\nOrganisation\nThe Regiment is currently based at Perham Down, Wiltshire.\nAs of 2020, after its conversion to a \"armoured infantry brigade signals\" unit, the regiment's squadron include:\n* 200 (Armoured) Signal Squadron\n* 246 Gurkha Signal Squadron\n* Support Squadron\nAlliances\n* – Panzergrenadier Division Signal Regiment Fernmeldebataillon 1\n* – 1st Canadian Signal Regiment\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://www.army.mod.uk/who-we-are/corps-regiments-and-units/royal-signals/1st-signal-regiment/ 1st Signal Regiment]"
