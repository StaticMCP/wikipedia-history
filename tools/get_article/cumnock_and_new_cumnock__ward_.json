Created in 2007, the ward elects four councillors using the single transferable vote electoral system and covers an area with a population of 13,210 people.\nThe area is a Labour stronghold with the party holding three of the four seats between in 2007 and 2017. Support for the party fell in 2017 with only one councillor elected but it recovered in 2022 and the party currently holds half the seats.\nBoundaries\nThe ward was created following the Fourth Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements ahead of the 2007 Scottish local elections. As a result of the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, local elections in Scotland would use the single transferable vote electoral system from 2007 onwards so Cumnock and New Cumnock was formed from an amalgamation of several previous first-past-the-post wards. It contained all of the former Cumnock East, Cumnock West, New Cumnock wards as well as part of the former Ochiltree, Skares, Netherthird and Craigen, Drongan, Stair and Rankinston, Auchinleck, Dalmellington and Mauchline wards. Cumnock and New Cumnock lies in the southeast of the council area next to its border with Dumfries and Galloway and takes in the towns of Cumnock, New Cumnock and Ochiltree. Following the Fifth Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements ahead of the 2017 Scottish local elections, the ward's boundaries were not changed.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=4|Billy Crawford(Labour)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Eric Ross(Labour)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Barney Menzies(Labour)\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Kathy Morrice(SNP)\n|-\n!2012\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Walter Young(Conservative)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Jim McMahon(SNP)\n|rowspan=1|Jacqui Todd(SNP)\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1|Neill Watts(Conservative)\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|June Kyle(Labour)\n|}\nElection results\n2022 election\n2017 election\n2012 election\n2007 election\nReferences"
