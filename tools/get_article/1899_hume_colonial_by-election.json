Until 1904, members appointed to a ministerial position were required to face a by-election. These were generally uncontested. Of the nine ministers appointed in the Lyne ministry, The Hume and Ashfield (Bernhard Wise) were the only electorates in which the by-election was contested.\nDates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Date !!
