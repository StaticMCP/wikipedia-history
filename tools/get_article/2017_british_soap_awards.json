The ceremony was held on 3 June 2017 at the Lowry theatre in Salford Quays, Salford, and was broadcast three days later on ITV1 and STV. It was originally planned for the event to be broadcast live for the first time, but due to ITV moving the live final of ''Britain's Got Talent into its scheduled timeslot, the awards were instead pre-recorded. The publicly voted categories were announced on 18 April 2017, with the vote opening that same day. This included a longlist for the Best Actress and Actor awards. The shortlist, including panel nominations, was released on 9 May 2017.\nITV soap Emmerdale won all three of the viewer-voted categories including Best British Soap, as well as taking home the most awards of the night. Fellow ITV soap Coronation Street won four awards, with Channel 4 soap Hollyoaks winning three. Original Hollyoaks cast member Nick Pickard won the British Soap Award for Outstanding Achievement for his role as Tony Hutchinson. BBC soaps Doctors and EastEnders won one award each.\nWinners and nominees\nPublicly voted\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Award\n! Winner\n! Shortlisted\n!
