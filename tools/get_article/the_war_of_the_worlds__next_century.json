The place visited by the Martians resembles a police state in which a huge role is played by television, which is used as a propaganda tool.\nThe main character of the film, Iron Idem  is a news presenter who has a popular TV program, ''Iron Idem's Independent News''. However, the news that is presented on his program is carefully chosen by Idem's boss who later orders the kidnapping of Idem's wife. Iron Idem is forced to collaborate with the state apparatus, which is working together with blood-thirsty Martians, and encourages people to make sacrifices and give blood in the hope of having his wife and normal life returned.\nAfter being thrown out of his flat, Idem has a chance to observe stupefied citizens who fall victim to the repression of the state apparatus. Finally, the main protagonist rebels and criticizes society during a TV Super Show which is a concert organized as a farewell to the Martians.\nOn the day after the Martians departure the Earth’s mass media change their perception of the whole situation and the visit from Mars is viewed as an aggressive invasion and Iron Idem is shown as the main collaborator. He agrees to collaborate with his mock trial in exchange for seeing his wife but she is delivered dead in the same bag her captors used to kidnap her. Finally he is sentenced to death and executed by firing squad where he only show as dead on the television screen in what appears to be an afterlife moment. He leaves the television studio and steps into an outside world obfuscated by light and mist.\nCast\n* Krystyna Janda\n* Jerzy Stuhr\n* Janusz Gojos\n* Bożena Dykiel\n* Zbigniew Buczkowski\n* Witold Pyrkosz\n* Stanisław Tym\n* Roman Wilhelmi\nRelease\nThe War of the Worlds: Next Century had its world premiere at the Gdańsk Film Festival on September 11, 1981.
