At its center is Ivan Grigoryevich, a radio host (played by Oleg Zhakov) dedicated to helping people find missing family members through a national radio program. Having lost his entire family in 1942, Ivan, now retired, volunteers his time at the radio station, immersing himself in the hopes and struggles of others also seeking reconnection. The film presents multiple search stories, some successful, some disappointing, often relying on nothing more than faint childhood memories as clues.\nOne central storyline is that of Valentina Rudakova (played by Rimma Manukovskaya), who has been searching for her daughter Alla, whom she lost during the war. Valentina’s story weaves throughout the film as she meets several women who could potentially be her daughter. Despite repeated heartbreak and Ivan’s suggestion to end her search, Valentina remains determined. In the end, she forms a bond with Alla Kuznetsova (played by Liya Akhedzhakova), choosing to stay with her, even though she realizes that this Alla is not her biological child.\nCast\n* Oleg Zhakov as Ivan Grigorievich\n* Rimma Manukovskaya as Valentina Dmitrievna Rudakova\n* Eleonora Aleksandrova as Nina Lykova\n* Lyudmila Antonyuk as \tNina's mother\n* Gennadiy Yalovich as Nina's brother\n* Liya Akhedzhakova\tas Alla Kuznetsova\n*  Mikhail Asafov  as Velekhov\n* Sergey Dreyden as architect\n* Natalya Gundareva as  Klava\n* Lyudmila Ivanova as switchman\n* Valentin Nikulin as a visitor to the bath\n* Raisa Ryazanova as  weaver\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
