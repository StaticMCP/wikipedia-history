Date\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Event\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| January 14\n| The US Government announces that restrictions on exporting cryptography are being relaxed (although not removed).This allows many US companies to stop the long running process of having to create US and international copies of their software.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| January 19\n| Transmeta releases the Crusoe microprocessor.The Crusoe was intended for laptops and consumed significantly less electricity than most microprocessors of the time, while providing comparable performance to the mid-range Pentium II microprocessors.Transmeta and Crusoe, new competitors to Intel and their products, initially appeared exciting and promising.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| February 17\n| Microsoft releases Windows 2000.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| March\n| Be Inc. released BeOS R5 for PowerPC and x86, which was the first release of BeOS for x86 to have a freely downloadable version which could be fully installed on a user's hard drive.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| March 4\n| Sony releases the PlayStation 2.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| March 6\n| AMD released an Athlon clocked at 1&nbsp;GHz.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| March 8\n| Intel releases very limited supplies of the 1&nbsp;GHz Pentium III chip.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| June 20\n| British Telecom (BT) claim the rights to hyperlinks on the basis of a US patent granted in 1989.

IBM).\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| March 12\n| Intel releases the Pentium M for notebooks and the Centrino mobile platform. The Pentium M delivers similar or higher performance than the Pentium 4-M while consuming less power.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| April 22\n| AMD releases the Opteron line of server processors.
