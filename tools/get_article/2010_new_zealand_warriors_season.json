They retained their black and white home and away jerseys from 2009, however they added a 15-year anniversary blue jersey and a grey Heritage design, similar to the jersey worn for the Awen Guttenbeil testimonial match. The club also had a new white and black training jersey.\nThe Warriors wore their blue strip in the first round of the season after the Gold Coast Titans opted to wear their white away jerseys for the match in the Gold Coast. This decision was repeated in round three after Brisbane opted to wear white in another Sunday afternoon game in Queensland.\nVodafone New Zealand was again the naming rights sponsor of the Warriors in 2009. Lion Red was the sleeve sponsor. Suzuki and HiFX were featured on the shorts while Loadlift was on the back of the jersey.\n|}\nFixtures\nThe Warriors again use Mt Smart Stadium as their home ground in 2010, their only home ground since they entered the competition in 1995.\nPre-season training\nThe main squad returned to training on 2 November 2009 to start preparing for the 2010 season. Players involved in the 2009 Four Nations and 2009 Pacific Cup returned to training later.\nPre-season matches\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"font-size:75%; width:100%;\"\n|-\n!Date!! Round !!
