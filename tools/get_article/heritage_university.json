It offers associate, bachelor's, and master's degrees.\nHistory\nFounded in 1907 by the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary as Holy Names College in Spokane, Washington, the institution subsequently changed its name to Fort Wright College. In 1982, Fort Wright College moved its administration to Toppenish and was renamed Heritage College, which operated there and in Omak, while maintaining the Spokane campus. Five years later, the Spokane campus was closed.\nA fire which started on July 8, 2012, destroyed the university's oldest building, Petrie Hall.\nCooperative agreements\nHeritage University offers upper-division classes at three Washington community college campuses to allow students to work toward a four-year degree from Heritage. This cooperative program began in 1993 to allow holders of associate degrees from Big Bend Community College in Moses Lake to apply their credits toward a Heritage bachelor's degree. Similar cooperative arrangements were established with Columbia Basin College in Pasco and Highline Community College in Des Moines in 2003 and 2006, respectively.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.heritage.edu Official website]"
