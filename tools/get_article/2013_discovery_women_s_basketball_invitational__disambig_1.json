India was also invited to take part in the tournament but did not send its team due to a ban imposed on its National Olympic Committee by the International Olympic Committee at that time which took effect in December 2012. The tournament was held in Naga City from August 22–25, 2013 at the Jesse Robredo Coliseum.\nResults\nThe tournament was initially planned to be a single round robin with the top two team playing for the championships at the finals.\nThe tournament's format was switched into a double round robin format with each team at the tournament facing the other teams twice.\n|place=Jesse Robredo Coliseum, Naga City\n|teamA=  |scoreA=74\n|teamB=\n|scoreB=52\n|Q1=|Q2= |Q3= |Q4=\n|points1= |points2=\n|rebounds1=|\n|assist1=|assist2=\n|report=[http://www.spin.ph/sports/basketball/news/philippine-womens-basketball-team-wins-robredo-memorial-cup-v02 Report]\n|referee=\n}}\n|scoreA=56\n|teamB=  Gold Coast\n|scoreB=47\n|Q1=|Q2= |Q3= |Q4=\n|points1= |points2=\n|rebounds1=|\n|assist1=|assist2=\n|report=[http://www.spin.ph/sports/basketball/news/philippine-womens-basketball-team-wins-robredo-memorial-cup-v02 Report]\n|referee=\n}}\n|scoreA=90\n|teamB=\n|scoreB=21\n|Q1=|Q2= |Q3= |Q4=\n|points1= |points2=\n|rebounds1=|\n|assist1=|assist2=\n|report=[http://www.spin.ph/sports/basketball/news/philippine-womens-basketball-team-wins-robredo-memorial-cup-v02 Report]\n|referee=\n}}\n|scoreA=52\n|teamB=  Gold Coast\n|scoreB=67\n|Q1=|Q2= |Q3= |Q4=\n|points1= |points2=\n|rebounds1=|\n|assist1=|assist2=\n|report=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEL0AmTwAWs Report]\n|referee=\n}}\n|scoreA=77'''\n|teamB=  Gold Coast\n|scoreB=69\n|Q1=|Q2= |Q3= |Q4=\n|points1=Borja 15|points2=\n|rebounds1=|\n|assist1=|assist2=\n|report=[http://www.spin.ph/sports/basketball/news/philippine-womens-basketball-team-wins-robredo-memorial-cup-v02 Report]\n|referee=\n}}\nIt is unknown what the scoreline is between the one other match between Singapore and Gold Coast.
