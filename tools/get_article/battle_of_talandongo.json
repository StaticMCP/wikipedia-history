It seems he had been accompanying the governor for some time, as he mentions several important local chiefs who had embraced Christianity, resulting in about a thousand baptisms since Songa's baptism.}}\nBattle\nAfter departing from Mocumba, the governor advanced to \"Nova Gaza,\" near the Ngola capital. As the Portuguese approached Cambambe, they fired two shots. The Ngola king, fearing what might happen, fled with his men. The Portuguese mistakenly believed this was a retreat out of fear, but it was actually a strategic move to assemble an army of 1,200 men to confront them. The local chiefs allied with the Portuguese hesitated to fight, except for D. Paulo, who remained loyal.\nThe battle took place on February 2, 1583. With fewer than 150 Portuguese soldiers and a group of African allies, the Portuguese managed to defeat the larger Ngola force in under two hours. This victory was considered miraculous, attributed in part to Father Barreira's spiritual leadership, as he was viewed as a “Moses Intercessor.” The battle was seen as a holy war. Seven Portuguese soldiers died when Barreira stopped praying, which some blamed on him for the losses.José P.

The governor wrote to the King of Portugal to confirm these donations, aiming to establish a region populated by white settlers that would generate sufficient revenue for three colleges. However, he strategically abandoned Nova Gaza and retreated to a naturally fortified location about half a journey from Cambambe: Massangano, known as the Vila da Vitória.\nReferences"
