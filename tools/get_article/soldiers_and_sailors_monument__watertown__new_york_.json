The monument rests upon the former village green, which has been located there since 1805.\nHistory and description\nThe granite monument is approximately 50 feet tall, resting upon a raised earthen berm. It sits on a 12-foot base. An allegorical figure of Victory (seven and a half feet tall ) sits atop a decorative column, plinth and base. Commemorative bronze plaques are on the east and west sides of the monument, with a cast bronze soldier on the north side and a cast bronze sailor on the south side. The sailor and soldier are in period uniforms, standing at parade rest.\nThe cornerstone was laid in the afternoon on Memorial Day late May 1890; the ceremony featured a speech by Colonel Albert D. Shaw given to \"brother soldiers\", local notables and the public who attended. The Watertown Herald prominently featured an engraving of the monument on their front page on June 6, 1891.\nThe monument was dedicated on June 3, 1891 in the Public Square in Watertown. $10,000 was donated toward the monument by a Mr. and Mrs. George Cook. The night before it was unveiled, the monument was covered by a large US flag, measuring 36 feet long. It once flew from a flagpole in the square when each of the local regiments left for the Civil War. Originally costing $115, it was said to be the largest flag in the state at the time.\nPlaques on the monument read:\n\"In grateful memory of the\nSoldiers and Sailors of\nJefferson County\nwho fought or fell in defense of\nthe Union and the freedom of man.\nThis monument to witness\nthat these dead have not\ndied in vain and that\nthrough them,\nunder God,\nthis nation had\na new birth of freedom.\"\nThe monument underwent restorations and conservation between 2009 and 2012. It was cleaned, stabilized and repaired, which included adding the sailor's missing cutlass blade. The monument was found not to be leaning in any particular direction at that time.\nThe monument forms part of the Public Square Historic District in Watertown, listed in the National Register of Historic Places\nReferences"
