As the original NeXTSTEP computer shipped with a relational database and Objective-C, Lighthouse engineers created a simple mapping utility called Exploder to store objects in a relational database.\nThe Persistence team worked with Stanford University's professors Gio Wiederhold and [http://logic.stanford.edu/people/keller/ Arthur M Keller], who was the chief technical advisor, to extend the object-relational mapping technology by adding the concepts of mapping related objects.\nPersistence created a series of products that integrated object-to-relational mapping, caching, and cache synchronization with automated cache management.\nThe products were marketed under the names PowerTier, EdgExtend, and DirectAlert.\nSun Microsystems licensed the Persistence technology in 1998, which was later incorporated into the Enterprise JavaBeans standard.\nIn 2004, Progress Software bought Persistence for $16 million.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.serverwatch.com/sreviews/article.php/1376031/PowerTier----A-cache-based-transaction-processing-application-server-designed-for-high-performance-and-scalability.htm PowerTier overview from ServerWatch].\n*[http://www2.sys-con.com/itsg/virtualcd/java/archives/0507/milbery56/index.html PowerTier 6 product review from Java Developer's Journal]"
