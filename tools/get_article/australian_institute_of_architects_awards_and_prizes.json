      "text": "# Australian Institute of Architects Awards and Prizes\n\nThe Australian Institute of Architects coordinates and promotes annual awards, prizes and honours at both a national level and at a State and Territory level. Awards generally recognise buildings and projects, whilst prizes recognise individual and group achievement in advocacy, innovation, social, community, education and environmental fields. Honours recognise individual achievements in all areas of architecture.\nNational Architecture Awards\nThe National Architecture Awards are held in late October or early November each year and have been presented annually since 1981. Shortlisted entrants are drawn from relevant State and Territory awards programs held earlier in the year (usually in June or July).\nNational Awards (as of 2023)\n* Sir Zelman Cowen Award for Public Architecture (started 1981, named 1981)\n* Robin Boyd Award for Residential Architecture, Houses (New) (started 1981, named 1981)\n* Lachlan Macquarie Award for Heritage (started 1983)\n* National President's Award (started 1985)\n* Harry Seidler Award for Commercial Architecture (started 1988, named 2007)\n* Emil Sodersten Award for Interior Architecture (started 1988, named 2007)\n* Walter Burley Griffin Award for Urban Design (named 1990, preceded by Civic Design Award 1988)\n* Jørn Utzon Award for International Architecture (started 1991, named 2007)\n* Colorbond Award for Steel Architecture (started 1998)\n* David Oppenheim Award for Sustainable Architecture (started 1999 as ESD & EED award, changed to 'Sustainable' in 2002, named 2013)\n* National Award for Enduring Architecture (started 2003 as the 25 Year Award, renamed in 2007 and 2011)\n* Nicholas Murcutt Award for Small Project Architecture (started 2007, named 2013)\n* Frederick Romberg Award for Residential Architecture, Multiple Housing (started 2007, named 2007)\n* Eleanor Cullis-Hill Award for Residential Architecture, Houses (Alterations and Additions) (started 2015, named 2015)\n* Daryl Jackson Award for Educational Architecture (started 2015, named 2015)\nDiscontinued National Awards\n* President's Award for Recycled Buildings (started 1985, ended 2000)\n* Special Jury Award (started 1991, ended 2002)\n* National Education Prize\n* Environment Citation (started 1993, ended 1998, replaced by ESD & EED in 1999)\n* Access Citation (started 1994, ended 1999)\n, Walsh Bay, Sydney]. Award designed by Michael Meszaros.]]\nNational Prizes\nNational Prizes have been awarded annually since 2010, usually in early May and often as part of the Australian Architecture Conference. Each prize has a separate jury who assess a shortlist in each category. The inaugural 'Australian Achievement in Architecture Awards' were held on 18 March 2010 at the Gallery of Modern Art in Brisbane, presented separately to the National Awards. In 2017 the program was renamed as 'National Prizes'. National Prizes recognise achievement across a range of categories that support and promote advocacy, innovation and education, and do not relate to particular buildings which are judged at the National Awards later in the same year.\nAIA Gold Medal\nThe AIA Gold Medal is the highest individual honour awarded by the Australian Institute of Architects and has been presented annually since 1960. The honour recognises \"distinguished service by architects who have designed or executed buildings of high merit, producing work of great distinction that has advanced architecture or endowed the profession in a distinguished manner\". Since 1970 the recipient of the Gold Medal has delivered the AS Hook Memorial Address. The address provides the winner a forum to discuss their work, insights and principles and to reflect on the state of the profession at the time.\nThe most recent recipient is Timothy Hill awarded the Gold Medal in May 2025 at the Australian Architecture Conference.\nPaula Whitman Leadership in Gender Equity Prize\nThis award honours architect, academic and gender equity advocate Paula Whitman (1960–2006).
