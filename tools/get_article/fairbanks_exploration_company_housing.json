In the 1920s the company built a number of housing units for its workers. A cluster of at least eight of these is known to have survived on the east side of Illinois Street, of which four have retained historical integrity.  Located at 505, 507, 521, and 523 Illinois Street, they are all similarly built Bungalow-style wood-frame buildings,  stories in height, with a hip roof and projecting hipped wings.  The complex includes a five-stall garage which served all four houses, as well as two greenhouses. At the time of their listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997, this group of houses was being rehabilitated for use as a bed and breakfast inn.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska\n*Mary Lee Davis House, used as housing for F.E.
