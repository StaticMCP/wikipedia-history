The Muslims fled Makwanpur, resulted in Gorkhali victory, and the first victory of Gorkhas against overseas soldiers.\nBackground\nPrithvinarayana, the ruler of Gorkha, aimed to economically isolate the Kathmandu Valley. By 1762, he controlled both the eastern and western trade routes to Lhasa from the valley. Additionally, he conquered strategic locations such as Makwanpur, Timalkot, Sindhuli, and Hariharpur on the Mahabharat range southwest of the valley, effectively blocking the southern routes to India. This blockade imposed economic restrictions on the valley, aligning with Prithvinarayana's objectives.\nClash\nPrithvinarayana's actions led to clashes with external forces. Firstly, Ali Mir Kasim, the Nawab of Bengal, was incited by Digbandhan Sena, the displaced ruler of Makwanpur and Prithvinarayana's first wife's brother, to attack the Gorkha stronghold in Makwanpur. In response, Prithvinarayana engaged Mir Kasim's general, Gurgin Khan, at Makwanpur, where he decisively defeated the advancing troops and forced them to retreat.\nThis event underscored Prithvinarayana's military prowess and determination to maintain control over strategic territories, thereby securing his position and objectives in the region.\nReferences"
