It may be accessed from Stone Run Drive off Plain Street near Bay Road and sits on a  parcel of land owned by the Land Preservation Society, an independent non-profit conservation organization chartered in 1970 by the State of Massachusetts.\nThe cave is so named because Metacomet, the Wampanoag sachem also known as \"King Philip\", is said to have hidden here near the end of King Philip's War before meeting his death in the Great Miery Swamp in Bristol, RI.\nAccording to materials published by The Patriot Ledger:\nThe town forest, where King Philip's Cave is located, and Lake Winnecunnett are both popular recreation sites.\nAccording to another source:\nEvery Norton school child has been entertained with the legend of King Philip's Cave.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20191010220421/http://nortonlandpreservation.org/page16/page48/files/KingPhilip.pdf Hand-drawn map showing area of King Phillip's Cave]"
