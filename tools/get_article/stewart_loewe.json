He played junior football for P. & C. Junior Football Club based in Delacombe Park, Frankston, where his large size helped him excel in the position of ruckman, though he was also known for his poor kicking that would plague him throughout his AFL career.\nAt centre-half-forward, Loewe formed a lethal forward-line partnership with full-forward Tony Lockett.  He had an awkward kicking style which sometimes resulted in missing easy shots, but his ability to kick long goals and consistent contested marking more than made up for it.\nHe went on to enjoy a great career, winning All-Australian selection in 1991 and 1992, winning the E. J. Whitten Medal in 1992 and co-captaining the side from 1996 to 1998.\nLoewe played in St Kilda's 1996 AFL Ansett Australia Cup winning side.\nLoewe played in 21 of 22 matches in the 1997 AFL premiership season home and away rounds in which St Kilda Football Club qualified in first position for the 1997 AFL Finals Series, winning the club's 2nd Minor Premiership and 1st McClelland Trophy.\nHe retired in 2002, with 321 games, a record only surpassed at the Saints by Nathan Burke and Robert Harvey.\nHe was known to have been courted by other clubs during his career, most notably Fremantle on their introduction to the AFL, however he tells a less known story about the time [https://unpluggered.captivate.fm/episode/22-boys-back-at-moorabbin-saints-of-origin-ft-stewart-loewe Loewe nearly joined league heavyweights Essendon], before deciding to stay a one-club legend at St Kilda.\nLoewe later played 68 games for Old Haileybury Amateur Football Club and played in the 2006 A Grade Premiership.  He now coaches the senior team at Old Haileybury.\nNotes\nExternal links\n*\n}}"
