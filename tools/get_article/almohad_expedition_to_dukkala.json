Subsequently, an Almoravid warlord, Ibn Hûd al-Mâssî, established himself amongst the tribesmen of Dukkala. Soon his authority was recognized throughout the Atlantic plain of Morocco,  the Middle Atlas range and even into the High Atlas.\nInitially Abd al-Mu'min had ignored the tribesmen raiding the districts of Marrakesh. However, when the raiding increased under al-Mâssî, al-Mu'min led an army against the rebel tribesmen.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Almohad Expedition to Dukkala\n\n#REDIRECT Almohad expedition to Dukkala\n}}"
