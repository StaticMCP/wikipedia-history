It is managed and published on a non-profit, voluntary basis by postgraduate researchers in the Department of Archaeology at the University of Cambridge. Each issue addresses a particular subject of interest within archaeology, featuring topics such as ethnoarchaeology, feminist archaeology and landscape archaeology.\nThe first issue of ARC was published in 1981. Following a brief hiatus, the journal returned to regular production in the spring of 1983, and has since been continually published twice a year. The journal's current general editor is Benjamin Shen.\nAims and Intentions\nARC aims to provide a platform for the discussion of current archaeological research, welcoming relevant contributions from archaeologists of any temporal, geographic or theoretical standpoint. A statement of editorial intent was outlined in Volume 2.1 (Spring 1983), expressing that ARC was established in order to bridge the gap between the formal publication of major research projects in leading journals, and the more informal discussions which take place at seminars and conferences.\nIssues typically consist of a thematic section (containing articles relating to the issue's overarching theme), a general section (intended to provide a forum within which subjects, not connected with the thematic section but of current interest, may be presented) and commentary (covering shorter notes and contributions, reviews and correspondence arising from the study and practice of archaeology more widely). Book and article reviews are also a regular feature of each journal.\nTable of Issues\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n!Number\n!Title\n!Theme Editor(s)\n!Date\n|-\n|39.2\n|Indigenous Archaeologies\n|Natasha Rai\n|November 2024\n|-\n|39.1\n|Human Insect Entanglement: Past, Present, and Future\n|Nynke Blömer, Benny Shen and Jake Stone\n|June 2024\n|-\n|38.2\n|Archaeology and the Publics\n|Christos Nikolaou, Stanley Onyemechalu, Chike Pilgrim, and Benny Shen\n|November 2023\n|-\n|38.1\n|Archaeology and Colonialism\n|Marianna Negro, Julia Gustafson and Gian Battista Marras\n|May 2023\n|-\n|37.2\n|Aesthetics, Sensory Skills and Archaeology\n|Polina Kapsali and Rachel Phillips\n|November 2022\n|-\n|37.1\n|Rethinking the Archaeology-Heritage Divide\n|Alisa Santikarn, Elifgül Doǧan, Oliver Antczak, Kim Eileen Ruf and Mariana P.L.
