In the , Theresa Creek had a population of 42 people.\nGeography\nThe locality of Theresa Creek has the following mountains:\n* Mount Wallaby in the north of the locality (), rising to  above sea level\n* Mount Livingstone in the north of the locality ()\n* Mount Hammond in the north of the locality ()\n* Mount Pleasant in the north of the locality ()\n* Mount Misery in the east of the locality ()\n* Langton Edge in the southof the locality ()\nThe watercourse Theresa Creek, from which the locality presumably takes its name, rises in the Drummond Range in Peak Vale to the south-west. The creek forms sections of the locality's north-western boundary before flowing into Lake Theresa, a reservoir created by the Theresa Creek Dam. Part of Lake Theresa is within the locality with the rest being within the neighbouring locality of Clermont to the north-west; similarly the dam wall spans the two localities (). After passing through the dam wall, the creek forms part of the north-western boundary of the locality and then flows south-east through the locality, exiting to the south-east (the locality of Carbine Creek). The creek eventually becomes a tributary of the Nogoa River.\nThe land use is grazing on native vegetation.\nEducation\nTheresa Creek Provisional School opened circa 1897. Circa 1903, the school closed due to low student numbers. In 1905, it became a half-time school with Douglas Creek Provisional School (meaning the two schools shared a single teacher). In 1906, the Douglas Creek school was closed and Theresa Creek Provisional School returned to full-time status. On 1 January 19091, it became Theresa Creek State School. It closed permanently in 1914.\nDemographics\nIn the , Theresa Creek had a population of 54 people.\nIn the , Theresa Creek had a population of 42 people.\nEducation\nThe nearest government primary schools are Clermont State School in neighbouring Clermont to the north and Capella State School in Capella to the east. The nearest government secondary schools are Clermont State High School, also in Clermont, and Capella State High School, also in Capella.\nThere is also a Catholic primary school in Clermont.\nReferences"
