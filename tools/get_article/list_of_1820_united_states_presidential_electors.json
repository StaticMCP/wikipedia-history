The election was won by incumbent president James Monroe, with 231 (or 228) electoral votes, and incumbent vice president Daniel D. Tompkins, with 218 (or 215) votes.\nA total of 235 men were elected to the Electoral College, but three—one each from Mississippi, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee—did not cast their ballots. At least two, Melchior Rahm and Duncan Stewart, had died before their state's electors voted; the disposition of the third is unclear.\nIn addition, the status of the three electors from Missouri was a matter of dispute. Congress had passed an enabling act directing Missouri to organize a state government and that \"the said state, when formed, shall be admitted into the Union.\" The dispute was over whether Missouri's new state constitution fulfilled the requirements. In the end, two official vote totals were announced by Congress, one counting Missouri's votes and one not, with neither declared the canonical result — the source of debates over whether Monroe won 231 or 228 electoral votes. Missouri was not officially admitted as a state until August 10, 1821.\nAlabama\nAll 3 of Alabama's electors voted for James Monroe for president and Daniel D.
