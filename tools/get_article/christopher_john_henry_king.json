He received a bachelor's degree in geology at the University of Bristol. In 1971, he began a more than five-year career as a diamond prospector for De Beers company in South Africa, Swaziland, and Australia.\nAfterwards, he obtained a master's degree with distinction in sedimentology from the University of Reading and completed a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) in science and geology at Keele University under the tutelage of David Barnard Thompson.\nCareer in geoscience education\nKing began his career as a geoscience educator at the Altrincham Grammar School for Boys from 1978 to 1996, where he taught Geology A-Level and other science subjects. He became a Science Education Lecturer at Keele University in 1996, and was promoted to Professor of Earth Science Education there in 2006. He served as Head of the Keele University Department of Education for two years. King was also a founder, director, and driving force behind the Earth Science Education Unit (ESEU) at Keele University, which was active from 2002 to 2015. ESEU provided professional development workshops for Earth science teachers within the United Kingdom. It educated more than 30,000 teachers on Earth science topics. King retired from Keele in December 2015 and was thereafter awarded Professor Emeritus status. He died on 17 February  2022, aged 72.\nKing's contributions to global geoscience education were numerous. He helped organize the first International Conference in Geoscience Education. He was a founder member of the International Geoscience Education Organization (IGEO) and its first Chairman in 2000. He remained a Council Member until 2012. He was a founding member of the Commission on Geoscience Education (COGE) within the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS).\nIn 2007, he became a founder of the Earth Learning Idea (ELI), website which freely provides regularly updated geoscience-focused activities for teachers and informal educators in ten languages. According to The Geological Society, their content has been downloaded over 5.7 million times since the effort began.\nAwards and honors\nKing is widely recognized for his contributions to geoscience education and has received numerous awards including:\n* 1994 Life Membership of ESTA\n* 2003 Geological Society’s Distinguished Service Award\n* 2011 RH Worth Prize\n* 2012 Geologists’ Association’s Halstead Medal\n* 2018 Geoethics Medal from the International Association for the Promotion of Geoethics (IAPG)\nIn 2023, IUGS-COGE created the Chris King Medal\nto honor his contributions to global geoscience education. The medal is awarded biannually to an educator who has demonstrated an impactful career in geoscience education.\nLegacy\nKing's substantial imprint on geoscience education is epitomized by his significant literary contributions.  He co-authored more than 200 publications, including several textbooks and resources on Earth science education as well as peer-reviewed journal articles.\nAs a member of COGE and the Chairman of the Education Committee of the European Geosciences Union (EGU) in 2018, King played a pivotal role in the establishment of the [https://iugscoge.org/geoscience-education-field-officer-program/ Geoscience Education Field Officer Programme] (GEFO) and the International Geoscience Syllabus.\nThe GEFO program was initiated following Professor King's comprehensive Geoscience Education Across the Globe survey, which highlights the need for proper training for geoscience educators. In 2018, King garnered the support of IUGS and EGU to formally launch the program, leading to the appointment and training of Geoscience Education Field Officers. He oversaw the program until 2021. The primary aim of the program is to address the growing devaluation of geoscience teaching and to propose innovative pedagogical approaches for non-higher education. Since its inception, the program has involved more than 400 teachers, including 120 Portuguese, in various initiatives aimed at proposing pedagogical strategies and creative training for teachers in this field. As such, the  GEFO program serves as a critical pillar in the advancement of geoscience education on a global scale.\nKing's works, including pivotal publications like the E-book, \"Exploring Geoscience Across the Globe translated into 7 languages, a valuable resource for geoscience teaching around the world.\nInternational studies, such as the \"Results of the IUGS-COGE/IGEO Survey\", have become cornerstones in the field. His adeptness at merging intricate geoscientific concepts with accessible educational content has offered invaluable insights, enriching global pedagogical practices. King's work is a source of academic enrichment and a conduit for international dialogue in geoscience education. His legacy, encapsulating insightful analyses and practical resources, supported to elevate the field, making geoscience education comprehensive and accessible globally.\nSelected publications\nKing co-authored more than 200 publications, including several textbooks and resources on Earth science education as well as thirty peer-reviewed journal articles.\n* King, C.
