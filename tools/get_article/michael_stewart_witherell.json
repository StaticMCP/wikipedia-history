He has been the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory since 2016, and will serve until 2026. Witherell, a particle physicist, previously served as Director of Fermilab. He previously served as professor and vice chancellor for research at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\nEarly life and education\nHe was born 22 September 1949 in Toledo, Ohio. Witherell received a Bachelor of Science from the University of Michigan in 1968 and a Doctor of Philosophy from the  University of Wisconsin, Madison in 1973.\nCareer\nFrom 1973 to 1981 he was on the faculty of Princeton University.  He was a member of the physics faculty at the University of California, Santa Barbara from 1981 to 1999.\nIn 1985 Witherell led an experiment at Fermilab which was the first to isolate a large sample of particles containing the charm quark using the new technology of silicon microstrip detectors.  He received the 1990 Panofsky Prize from the American Physical Society for this research. In 1998 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.\nWitherell served as the Director of the Fermilab from 1999 to 2005. In 2005 he returned to UC Santa Barbara as the Vice Chancellor for Research, serving in that role until 2016.\nIn January 2016, the University of California Board of Regents appointed him to be the Director of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. In 2017 he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\nService\nWitherell chaired the Fermilab Program Advisory Committee from 1987 to 1989 and the SLAC Scientific Policy Committee from 1994 to 1996, and the High Energy Physics Advisory Panel of the United States Department of Energy from 1997 to 1999. He chaired the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Advisory Committee (MPSAC) of the NSF from 2006 to 2008 and the National Academy of Science's Board on Physics and Astronomy from 2015 to 2016.\nWitherell served on the National Academies' Committee on Science, Engineering, Medicine and Public Policy (COSEMPUP) from 2017-2021. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences Council in 2023.\nPersonal life\nHis wife Elizabeth Witherell, a literary historian and scholarly editor, is editor-in-chief of The Writings of Henry D. Thoreau project at UC Santa Barbara.\nAwards and honors\n*1986: elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society\n*1988: Guggenheim Fellow for the academic year 1988–1989\n*1990: awarded the Panofsky Prize\n*1998: elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences\n*2004: received the Gold Award of the US Secretary of Energy\n*2017: elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.lbl.gov/lab-leadership/director/ Berkeley Lab Director Michael Witherell]\n* [http://hep.ucsb.edu/people/witherel/witherel.html Witherell's web page at the University of California, Santa Barbara]\n* [http://www.fnal.gov/pub/ferminews/FermiNews99-03-19.pdf Fermi News, March 1999, appointment of Witherell as Director of Fermilab]\n* [http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/1999/B/199901321.html Science Blog — Distinguished Physicist Michael Witherell Appointed Director of Fermilab]\n* with Helen Quinn: [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-asymmetry-between-matter-and-an-2003-03/ The asymmetry between matter and antimatter.] Scientific American, October 1998\n* [http://inspirehep.net/author/profile/Michael.S.Witherell.1 Michael S.
