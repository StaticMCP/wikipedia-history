The awards were founded in 1982, and have had several title changes until the present title was introduced in 2015. In 2016 the awards were merged with the LIANZA children's book awards.  the awards are administered by the New Zealand Book Awards Trust and each category award carries prize money of .\nHistory\nThe awards began in 1982, as the New Zealand Government Publishing Awards, with two categories, Children's Book of the Year and Picture Book of the Year. A non-fiction award was presented in 1986, but not in 1987 or 1988, the final years of this incarnation of the awards.\nNo awards were presented in 1989. In 1990, Unilever New Zealand (then the New Zealand manufacturer of Aim toothpaste) restarted the awards as the '''AIM Children's Book Awards'''. There were two categories at that time, Fiction and Picture Book. Second and third prizes were originally awarded, though these were replaced with honour awards in 1993, presented at the judges' discretion. More categories were added over time: Best First Book in 1992 (not presented 1994–5); Non-Fiction in 1993, when Fiction was split into two categories (Senior Fiction and Junior Fiction); and AIM Book of the Year in 1995.\nIn 1997, the awards became the '''New Zealand Post Children's Book Awards''', and another new category was added, the New Zealand Post Children's Choice award. In 2004, the Senior Fiction category was renamed to Young Adult Fiction and the name of the awards changed to New Zealand Post Book Awards for Children and Young Adults.\nIn 2015 the title of the awards changed to the New Zealand Book Awards for Children and Young Adults. At this time the awards were administered by Booksellers New Zealand, an industry organisation, and were presented at the end of a 10-day festival organised by the New Zealand Book Council each May.\nIn 2016, the awards merged with the Library and Information Association of New Zealand Aotearoa (LIANZA) Awards, and became administered by the New Zealand Book Awards Trust. As a consequence of the merge, the Junior Fiction category prize was combined with the LIANZA Esther Glen Award for junior fiction and the Non-Fiction award was combined with the LIANZA Elsie Locke Award for Non-Fiction]. In addition, two new categories were introduced via the LIANZA Russell Clark Award for Illustration and the LIANZA Te Kura Pounamu Award for works written in te reo Māori (the Māori language).\nPrizes\n, the winners of the category awards are awarded , with the New Zealand Post Margaret Mahy Book of the Year winner receiving an additional $7,500. The Picture Book prize money is split evenly between the author and the illustrator of the book. Winners of the Best First Book and New Zealand Post Children's Choice awards receive $2,000 each, and any finalists presented an Honour Award receive $500 each.\nAwards\nChildren's Book of the Year\nNow called the New Zealand Post Margaret Mahy Book of the Year, this award is presented to a book \"which, in the opinion of the judges, achieves outstanding excellence in all general judging criteria\". , winners receive $7,500 (in addition to the $7,500 prize for winning in their category). Currently called the '''New Zealand Post Children's Book of the Year award, this award was originally known as the New Zealand Children's Book of the Year Award, presented from 1982 to 1988. When the New Zealand Government Publishing Awards finished in 1988, the award ceased to exist until 1995, when the AIM Children's Book Awards established the AIM Book of the Year'''.\nWinners of the Fiction category in 1990 to 1992, when there was no Book of the Year award and the only additional category was Picture Book (and Best First Book in 1992), have been considered Book of the Year winners.\n{| class=\"wikitable vertical-align-top col1center col-1center sortable\"\n|+ Winners of the Children's Book of the Year award\n! scope=col | Year\n! scope=col | Book\n! scope=col | Author(s)\n! scope=col | Category\n! scope=col class=\"unsortable\" | Reference(s)\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" | 'New Zealand Children's Book of the Year Award (1982–88); AIM Book of the Year (1995–96); New Zealand Post Children's Book of the Year (1997–)'\n|-\n| 1982 || The Silent One || Joy Cowley;  by Sherryl Jordan\n|rowspan=\"7\" style=\"background: #ececec; color: grey; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center; \" class=\"table-na\" | ZN/A\n|\n|-\n| 1983 || The Halfmen of O || Maurice Gee ||\n|-\n| 1984 || Jacky Nobody || Anne de Roo ||\n|-\n| 1985 || Visitors || Caroline MacDonald;  by Garry Melson ||\n|-\n| 1986 || Guardian of the Land || Joanna Orwin ||\n|-\n| 1987 || The Keeper || Barry Faville ||\n|-\n| 1988 || Alex || Tessa Duder ||\n|-\n| 1995 || The Fat Man || Maurice Gee || Junior Fiction ||\n|-\n| 1996 || Crossroads || Janice Marriott || Senior Fiction ||\n|-\n| 1997 || The Bantam and the Soldier || Jennifer Beck;  by Robyn Belton || Picture Book ||\n|-\n| 1998 || Dare Truth or Promise || Paula Boock || Senior Fiction ||\n|-\n| 1999 || A Summery Saturday Morning || Margaret Mahy;  by Selina Young || Picture Book ||\n|-\n| 2000 || The House that Jack Built || Gavin Bishop || Picture Book ||\n|-\n| 2001 || Voyage with Jason || Ken Catran || Senior Fiction ||\n|-\n| 2002 || The Plight of the Penguin ||  Lloyd Spencer Davis || Non Fiction ||\n|-\n| 2003 || Weaving Earth and Sky: Myths and Legends of Aotearoa || Robert Sullivan;  by Gavin Bishop || Non Fiction ||\n|-\n| 2004 || Bird in the Hand: Keeping New Zealand Wildlife Safe || Janet Hunt || Non Fiction ||\n|-\n| 2005 || Clubs: A Lolly Leopold Story || Kate De Goldi;  by Jacqui Colley || Picture Book ||\n|-\n| 2006 || Hunter || Joy Cowley || Junior Fiction ||\n|-\n| 2007 || Illustrated History of the South Pacific || Marcia Stenson || Non Fiction ||\n|-\n| 2008 || Snake and Lizard || Joy Cowley;  by Gavin Bishop || Junior Fiction ||\n|-\n| 2009 || The 10pm Question || Kate de Goldi || Young Adult Fiction ||\n|-\n| 2010 || Old Hu-HuHū Hū Koroheke (Te Reo edition) || Kyle Mewburn and Rachel DriscollTe Reo   by Kāterina Mataira || Picture Book ||\n|-\n| 2011 || The Moon & Farmer McPhee || Margaret Mahy;  by David Elliot || Picture Book ||\n|-\n| 2012 || Nice Day for a War || Matt Elliot;  by Chris Sloane || Non Fiction ||\n|-\n| 2013 || Into the River || Ted Dawe || Young Adult Fiction ||\n|-\n| 2014 || The Boring Book || Vasanti Unka || Picture Book ||\n|-\n| 2015 || Singing Home the Whale || Mandy Hager || Young Adult Fiction ||\n|-\n| 2016 || Anzac Heroes || Maria Gill;  by Marco Ivancic || Non Fiction ||\n|-\n| 2017 || Snark || David Elliot (after Lewis Carroll) || ||\n|-\n| 2018 || Aotearoa: The New Zealand Story || Gavin Bishop || Non-Fiction ||\n|-\n| 2019 || The Bomb || Sacha Cotter,  by Josh Morgan || ||\n|-\n| 2020 || Mophead: How Your Difference Makes a Difference || Selina Tusitala Marsh || Non-Fiction ||\n|-\n| 2021 || Charlie Tangaroa and the Creature from the Sea || T.
