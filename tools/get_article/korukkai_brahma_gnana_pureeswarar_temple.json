They snatched Vedas from Brahma and hid them under sea. Brahma approached Vishnu for help to get back the Vedas. Vishnu incarnated and killed the Asuras and handed over the Vedas back to Brahma. Even after getting back the Vedas, Brahma could not regain his memory about the knowledge of Vedas and about the creation. So he went again to meet Vishnu regarding this. Vishnu suggested him to visit the Shiva temple at Keellha Korukkai, to bathe in the Chandra Pushkarani and to go step by step around the temple (Adi pradakshina) by worshipping Shiva. Brahma did so with his consort Saraswati. Pleased with their prayers, Shiva restored his lost memories and the knowledge of Vedas.\nSub deities\nArdhanarishvara, Kirata murti, Brahma, Saraswati, Saptaswara Vinayaka, Subramanian with His consorts Valli and Devasena, Sun, Moon, Saturn, Adhikaara Nandi and Bhairava are the sub deities in this temple.\nReferences"
