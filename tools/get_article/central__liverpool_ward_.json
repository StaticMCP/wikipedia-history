The ward includes the longstanding city centre community around the Bullring, as well as many new city centre apartments. Furthermore, the ward contains the Pier Head and the two larger universities; the University of Liverpool and Liverpool John Moores University.\nThe population at the 2011 census was 20,340, and at the 2021 census was 24,849.\nIn 2004 Central was the city's most marginal ward, largely due to the intervention of the hard left Liverpool Labour Community Party, however the ward solely returned Labour Party councillors. The May 2008 local elections saw Labour take 62% of the vote.\nThe 2011 vote was effected by the controversy involving the Liberal Democrat candidate, Daniel Bradley, who is the son of former Liverpool City Council Leader Warren Bradley, when Daniel disclosed that he had not signed the candidate paper which his father had witnessed.\nCllr Maria Toolan resigned from the Labour Party, weeks before the 2023 elections, after failing to be selected as a Labour candidate, and subsequently stood for the Liverpool Community Independents Party in City Centre North ward.\nThe ward was dissolved in 2023 and was distributed mostly into the City Centre North and Brownlow Hill wards, with parts in the Canning, City Centre South, Everton West Kensington & Fairfield and Waterfront South wards.\nCouncillors\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Election!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor\n|-\n| 2004\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Nick Small (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Sharon Sullivan (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Richard White (Lab)\n|-\n| 2006\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Nick Small (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Sharon Sullivan (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Richard White (Lab)\n|-\n| 2007\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Nick Small (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Sharon Sullivan (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Richard White (Lab)\n|-\n| 2008\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Nick Small (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Sharon Sullivan (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Christine Banks (Lab)\n|-\n| 2010\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Nick Small (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Sharon Sullivan (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Christine Banks (Lab)\n|-\n| 2011\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Nick Small (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Sharon Sullivan (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Christine Banks (Lab)\n|-\n| 2012\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Nick Small (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Sharon Sullivan (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Christine Banks (Lab)\n|-\n| 2014\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Nick Small (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Sharon Sullivan (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Christine Banks (Lab)\n|-\n| 2015\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Nick Small (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Sharon Sullivan (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Christine Banks (Lab)\n|-\n| 2016\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Nick Small (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Sharon Sullivan (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Christine Banks (Lab)\n|-\n| 2018\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Nick Small (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Sharon Sullivan (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Christine Banks (Lab)\n|-\n| 2019\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Nick Small (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Maria Toolan (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Christine Banks (Lab)\n|-\n| 2021\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Nick Small (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Maria Toolan (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Christine Banks (Lab)\n|-\n|}\nindicates seat up for re-election after boundary changes.\nindicates seat up for re-election.\nindicates change in affiliation.\nindicates seat up for re-election after casual vacancy.\nElection results\nElections of the 2020s\n}}\n3.10\n}}\n1.12\n}}\n0.32\n}}\n0.27\n}}\n}}\n0.18\n}}\n4.22\n}}\n0.53\n}}\n1.26\n}}\nElections of the 2010s\n}}\n7.81\n}}\n10.77\n}}\n1.89\n}}\n0.88\n}}\n18.58\n}}\n0.07\n}}\n0.85\n}}\n}}\n1.57\n}}\n4.73\n}}\n2.14\n}}\n1.79\n}}\nN/A\n}}\n8.35\n}}\n8.46\n}}\n}}\n9.17\n}}\n3.04\n}}\n8.91\n}}\n12.21\n}}\n32.20\n}}\n}}\n2.77\n}}\n0.30\n}}\n6.75\n}}\n3.94\n}}\n3.07\n}}\n35.1\n}}\n}}\n8.34\n}}\n7.10\n}}\n1.01\n}}\n0.62\n}}\n14.83\n}}\n1.42\n}}\n}}\n1.02\n}}\n2.67\n}}\n0.49\n}}\n1.26\n}}\n1.26\n}}\n}}\n17.61\n}}\n3.21\n}}\n2.13\n}}\n20.94\n}}\n35.78\n}}\n16.89\n}}\n}}\nElections of the 2000s\n}}\n}}\n}}\nAfter the boundary change of 2004 the whole of Liverpool City Council faced election.
