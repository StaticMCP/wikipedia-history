      "text": "# Kingo Houses\n\nKingo Houses is a housing development designed by architect Jørn Utzon in Helsingør, Denmark. The development consists of 60 L-shaped houses based upon the design of traditional Danish farmhouses with central courtyards and those of Chinese and Islamic dwellings.\nHistory\nThe design of the Kingo Houses was based on a competition project Utzon had developed for the south of Sweden in 1953. Although he did not obtain a commission in Sweden, the mayor of Helsingør liked his idea and provided land for Utzon to realize his project.\nNamed after the developer Boligselskabet Kingo, the housing is currently known as Romerhusene (English: Roman houses).\nDesign\nThe development is based on Utzon's additive approach, starting modestly with one unit and proceeding from there, taking into account the lie of the land and the surroundings. Utzon described the arrangement of the houses as \"flowers on the branch of a cherry tree, each turning towards the sun.\"\nEach unit has an area of , enclosed on two sides by the L-shaped house, and by walls on the other two sides. The small size of the units makes them not only economical but also easily adaptable to the natural terrain. The limited size of the private area is compensated by the provision of a large landscaped communal space. Each house has a courtyard with two wings, one for living, the other for sleeping. Utzon set the exact amount of bricks to be used for the courtyard walls but he told the bricklayers they should build each house individually, catering for privacy, shade, view and enclosure. Built with state funding, the houses were limited to  per three-bed unit.\nInfluence\nUtzon drew inspiration for the Kingo Houses from traditional Nordic architectural sensibilities. The design of the dwellings were predicated on traditional Danish vernacular farmhouses. Furthermore, their design formed a prototype for Utzon's second courtyard housing project, the Fredensborg Houses. They have been called the finest Scandinavian example of humane housing.\nFile:Romerhusene01.jpg|Street view\nFile:Romerhusene 054.jpg|Street view\nFile:Kingo Houses - courtyards.jpg|Courtyards\nFile:Utzon, kingohusene, helsingør 3.jpg|Living room and courtyard\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.romerhusene.dk/index2003eng.htm Official site]"
