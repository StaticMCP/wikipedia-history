He is currently Professor of Physical Geography at the University of Manchester.\nCareer\nWoodward holds a BSc in Geography from Aberystwyth University and a PhD in Quaternary Science from Darwin College, Cambridge. His PhD formed part of the Klithi Project in the Pindus Mountains of northwest Greece, led by Geoff Bailey, exploring settlement history and landscape change at the end of the Pleistocene. He has engaged in long-term collaborations with archaeologists seeking to understand interactions between humans and rivers from the ice age to the present day. He has worked with the British Museum in the Nile Valley of northern Sudan. His most recent work has focused on microplastic pollution in UK rivers to better understand how they enter rivers, where they accumulate, and the hazards they pose.\nHe has held positions at the University of Exeter, University of Leeds and, since 2004, the University of Manchester, where he was head of the Department of Geography from 2016 to 2019.\nWoodward was one of the earliest academics to raise awareness about the issue of widespread discharges of untreated sewage into UK rivers and waterways. In 2021, he published a paper in Nature Sustainability that linked the microplastic pollution of river beds with the illegal discharge of untreated wastewater. It showed that the build-up of microplastics was directly linked to untreated sewage discharges outside periods of exceptional rainfall. This work helped to expose the sewage discharge scandal that has engulfed England's private water companies. This research was featured in the BBC documentary Our Troubled Rivers with Paul Whitehouse in 2023.\nHe is a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) and a Fellow of the British Society for Geomorphology (elected in 2017).  He was Vice President (Research and Higher Education) at the RGS between 2022 and 2025. Woodward was named one of the most impactful environmental professionals in the UK in The ENDS Report Power List 2024. He has been an editor of Geography Review since 2014.\nPublications\nHe has published extensively in academic journals. His books include The Ice Age: A Very Short Introduction, and The Arctic: A Very Short Introduction, the latter co-authored with Klaus Dodds. A Little History of the Earth will be published in October 2025 as part of Yale University Press' best-selling Little History series.\nPartial bibliography (books)\n* Mediterranean Quaternary River Environments, 1995\n* River Basin Sediment Systems, 2001\n* The Physical Geography of the Mediterranean, 2009\n* The Ice Age: A Very Short Introduction, 2014\n* The Arctic: A Very Short Introduction, 2021\n* A Little History of the Earth, 2025\nReferences"
