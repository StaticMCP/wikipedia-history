Television programs teach various water-saving methods and encourage the drinking of watermelon juice instead of water. Hsiao-kang, a pornographic actor, films sex scenes with watermelons and water. Shiang-chyi is a woman who lives nearby.\nOne day, while Shiang-chyi is out collecting water bottles, she sees watermelons in a river and takes a watermelon. She passes Hsiao-kang sleeping on a bench and uses his water bottle to wash her watermelon. She sits down on the bench across from him. He wakes up, and they realize that they know each other from when he was a watch salesman. She does not know that he now works in porn. The two start a relationship. She feeds him watermelon, they cook food together, and he smokes on the floor under her table. They go to a video store and make out in the adult film section.\nShiang-chyi finds an unconscious porn actress in an elevator. She helps a porn crew member take her to a room where they are filming. Hsiao-kang is there, and she is upset to see him working in porn. The crew films Hsiao-kang raping the unconscious woman, and Shiang-chyi watches them. As Hsiao-kang climaxes, he pulls out of the unconscious woman and pushes his penis inside Shiang-chyi's mouth.\nCast\n*Lee Kang-sheng as Hsiao-kang\n*Chen Shiang-chyi as Shiang-chyi\n*Lu Yi-ching as Porn actress\n*Yang Kuei-mei as Porn actress\n*Sumomo Yozakura as Porn actress\nProduction\nThis was the sequel to one of Tsai's previous films, What Time Is It There?
