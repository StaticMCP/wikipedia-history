It is part of the Star Wars franchise set, like the previous series The Mandalorian, in the anarchy that follows the defeat of the Galactic Empire. Skeleton Crew tells a coming-of-age story about four children who make a discovery on their home planet, get lost in the galaxy, and undertake a journey to get back home.\nJude Law stars in the series with Ravi Cabot-Conyers, Ryan Kiera Armstrong, Kyriana Kratter, Robert Timothy Smith, and Nick Frost. Watts approached Lucasfilm about telling an Amblin Entertainment-style coming-of-age story set in the Star Wars universe, and he was developing the series with Ford by early 2022. It was officially announced that May at Star Wars Celebration, with Law revealed to be starring. Filming began by September 2022 in Los Angeles, and wrapped by late January 2023. The child actors in the series were revealed in April 2023. Kathleen Kennedy, Jon Favreau, and Dave Filoni returned from The Mandalorian as additional executive producers.\nSkeleton Crew premiered on Disney+ on December 2, 2024, with episodes released weekly until January 14, 2025. The series received generally positive reviews from critics.\nPremise\nRoughly five years after the fall of the Galactic Empire, four children end up on an adventure to make their way home after being lost in the galaxy following a discovery they make on their home planet At Attin while befriending a Force-user.\nCast and characters\nStarring\n* Jude Law as Jod Na Nawood: A pirate captain and a Force-user who was trained in the Jedi arts.

When no currency is found in the vault, his crew member Brutus incites a mutiny. On the fairly modern planet of At Attin, Wim and his Myykian friend Neel prepare to take aptitude exams to determine their future. Wim implies that he wishes he were a Jedi, despite Neel's retort that that would be impossible. Meanwhile, truant students Fern and KB spend most of their time riding a hoverbike around town. When Wim misses the bus, he takes his own bike but falls into a ditch, where he discovers what he thinks is a Jedi temple. He is found by a droid who takes him to school but is subsequently admonished by his workaholic father, Wendle, who tells him that he needs to make up for the exam. Wim convinces Neel to visit the \"temple\" with him, with Fern (who overheard his claim) and KB following as well. The group finds a hatch and enters, only to learn that it is really a long-abandoned spaceship. Wim pushes a button that activates the ship, lifting them away. Wendle watches in horror as the ship takes his son and friends deep into space.\n|LineColor       = B79D66\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = The kids meet the ship's pilot, an aging droid named SM-33 who does not realize that his captain is long gone. Fern convinces him that she is his new captain, and he takes them to a nearby outpost, as At Attin is not on any map. The kids venture through the outpost and accidentally split up, during which Wim uses his \"lunch money\" to buy food only to learn that his currency is considered very valuable. When he tells the locals that he is from At Attin, everyone laughs as they tell him that \"At Attin\" is the name of a lost planet that holds a hidden treasure. A gang of pirates try to seize the kids by force to enslave them. SM-33 intervenes and tries to protect the children but is quickly overwhelmed and gunned down. Brutus has the children thrown in the brig. Down there, they meet another prisoner who introduces himself as Jod Na Nawood: a force-sensitive man with some usable knowledge. Wim, believing him to be a Jedi, agrees to work together so they can escape, with Jod offering to take the kids back to their ship as long as he gets to come with them.\n|LineColor       = B79D66\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = On At Attin, Wendle, Fern's mother Fara, Neel's mother Nooma, and KB's parents Maree and Garree are told that because the kids have left the planet, it is beyond the Supervisor's jurisdiction, and he will not rescue them. Jod helps the kids escape the brig, but they refuse to leave without SM-33, forcing him to go back and rescue him as the pirate Benjar Pranic identifies Jod as Silvo. They outwit the pirates and flee. Fern refuses to trust Jod, Wim and Neel are convinced that he is a real Jedi, and KB reluctantly admits that he is their only hope of getting home. Jod takes the kids to meet his \"friend\" Kh'ymm, a map expert and fence that even he doesn't trust. Kh'ymm refers to Jod as \"Crimson Jack\" before revealing that At Attin is among a series of legendary planets that conceal themselves from outsiders to protect their riches. She prints the coordinates, but Jod realizes that she was stalling for the authorities to arrive and takes the kids with him on their ship off-world. Jod finally admits that he is not a Jedi but agrees that they must work together to get what they want. X-Wing Commander Kent interrogates Kh'ymm about the group's whereabouts as she quotes \"if I told you, you wouldn't believe me\".\n|LineColor       = B79D66\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = The crew use Kh'ymm's coordinates to arrive at, what they believe to be, At Attin. The planet turns out to resemble a war-torn version of it, and later they learn that they are actually on At Achrann, one of the sister planets. Jod stays on the ship with SM-33 while the kids venture out. They run into soldiers who identify themselves as Troiks, a clan engaged in a bitter blood feud with the Hattans, who have stolen their Eopies. Neel befriends a young girl soldier named Hayna, whose father General Strix insists that the children be treated like adults. Neel does not take to the Troiks and their violent lifestyle, preferring a more humane approach. The kids are to aid the Troiks in getting their Eopies back, but Jod and SM-33 instead buy them back from the Hattans. As a reward, they are directed to the \"Fallen Sanctum\" which resembles the Supervisor's tower on At Attin. The crew find that it contains the coordinates to other similar planets, but At Attin's has been scratched out. SM-33 reveals that he destroyed it, but his memory has been wiped. Fern orders him to remember and he reveals that At Attin is where the former captain hid his treasure. Suddenly, SM-33 attacks the group as his confession triggers a hidden order to protect the treasure. Jod disables him and Neel faints after helping to save his friends.\n|LineColor       = B79D66\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = On At Attin, the parents desperately try to send a message beyond the barrier, but this attempt is foiled by the Supervisor's droid. After ordering the droid to delete what it learned from its memory, Fara admits to Wendle that they have to go behind the Supervisor's back. The Crew manage to restrain SM-33 and alter his programming to prevent him from turning on them. He reveals that the hidden treasure belonged to famed pirate Tak Rennod, meaning that the ship they are on is the Onyx Cinder. SM-33 agrees to take them to Rennod's former base, deep within the famed luxury planet Lanupa. Jod and the children enter the planet in disguise; unbeknownst to them Pokkit, Jod's former partner, outs his location to Brutus. With help from the patron Cthallops, the Crew make their way deep into Lanupa's hidden caves, maneuvering through booby traps until they find the hidden base. They find the coordinates to At Attin and learn that the \"treasure\" is an Old Republic Mint. Overcome with greed, Jod challenges Fern for the captaincy, and with a cutlass to her throat, urges her to yield. Wim, with a lightsaber in hand that he found in the treasure pile, threatens Jod, but drops the weapon when he proves unable to wield it. Fern eventually yields, but the children escape when Wim activates a booby trap, dropping them out of sight. Jod finds the lightsaber and activates it for himself.\n|LineColor       = B79D66\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = Jod and SM-33 are captured by the pirates and Pokkit. The pirates take Jod and SM-33 back to Brutus for execution. Meanwhile, the children drop out of Rennod's lair into the bottom of the resort. KB reveals she memorized At Attin's coordinates. A subsequent argument over how to reach the Onyx Cinder results in Fern and Neel trying to ascend the mountain while Wim and KB follows a group of seemingly benevolent trash crabs. Jod saves himself and SM-33 by bribing Brutus with the location of At Attin. Midway, KB's cybernetics suffer a malfunction from environmental corrosion, forcing Wim to fix them. Fern and Neel recover the Onyx Cinder and save their friends before they are devoured by the carnivorous trash crabs. Soon, the ship is pinned by a garbage machine, forcing the children to purge the hull, revealing a sleeker ship beneath as they depart Lanupa.\n|LineColor       = B79D66\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = The parents send a transmitter into outer space but are discovered by the security droids. The pirates arrive at At Attin at the same time as the Onyx Cinder, resulting in the latter's capture. The pirate Glerb is sent into the barrier, but his ship is destroyed by its defenses. Realizing the Onyx Cinder is the key to bypassing the planet's defensive barrier, Jod kills Brutus when the children incapacitate him, resumes his former captaincy, and tells the pirates to conceal themselves until he obtains the location of the planet's vaults. The children manage to use the pirate code to get SM-33 to turn on Jod so they can escape, but Jod stows aboard the Onyx Cinder, decapitates SM-33, and threatens the children into silence. To their surprise, the barrier recognizes the Onyx Cinder as an At Attin ship. As the security droids question the parents, the Supervisor is heard announcing the arrival of a Republic Emissary. Jod poses as the Republic Emissary to gain access to At Attin's vaults. The children are briefly reunited with their parents before Jod approaches them with his lightsaber activated.\n|LineColor       = B79D66\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = Jod continues to pose as the Republic Emissary. He orders Wim, Neel and KB to be confined to their quarters while he takes Fern and Fara to meet the Supervisor, who is revealed to be a massive droid. When the Supervisor confronts Jod about his contradicting claims about being both a Jedi and a Republic Emissary, revealing to have learned of Order 66, Jod is forced to destroy the Supervisor. This causes a blackout in the city and shuts down the safety droids. As the pirates invade At Attin with the intent of enslaving the populace, Wim, Wendle, Neel and KB race to the Onyx Cinder. With the ship locked in place, Wim and Wendle devise a plan to distract Jod so Wendle can restore power. This enables KB and a repaired SM-33 to launch and fly the ship past the barrier and call Kh'ymm for help. Shortly after, the Onyx Cinder is shot down by the pirates. Meanwhile on At Attin, Wim, Wendle, Fern and Fara all tussle with Jod. While Wim and Fern separate Jod from his lightsaber, Wendle and a reluctant Fara destroy the barrier. This allows the New Republic forces to arrive and deal with the pirates, shooting down their ship and forcing Jod to admit defeat. Everyone then races to the Onyx Cinder crash site to find KB alive and well. Wim looks up to the sky in amazement at the New Republic ships arriving on At Attin as power is restored.\n|LineColor       = B79D66\n}}\n}}\nProduction\nDevelopment\nIn February 2022, Production Weekly revealed the existence of an upcoming, untitled Star Wars series that was being developed under the working title Grammar Rodeo. Jon Watts was reportedly being considered to direct at least one episode of the series, with Jon Favreau serving as an executive producer after creating the Star Wars series The Mandalorian. The new series was reported to be set during the High Republic era, with a formal announcement planned for Star Wars Celebration in May 2022. In mid-May, Watts and Christopher Ford were revealed to have created the series, with the pair executive producing and Ford serving as writer. The series was also revealed to be set after the events of Return of the Jedi (1983), the same time period in which The Mandalorian is set, and was described as a \"galactic version of classic Amblin Entertainment coming-of-age adventure films of the '80s\".\nWatts initially pitched the series as a film right after the release of his Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), but his commitments with Marvel Studios delayed the project until he was finished with his work on Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019) and Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021). This period saw Favreau's creation of The Mandalorian, which influenced Watts's decision to produce the project as a television series, which he would begin upon completion of No Way Home. During Star Wars Celebration at the end of May 2022, the series' title was revealed to be Star Wars: Skeleton Crew. Dave Filoni was serving as an executive producer after doing the same on The Mandalorian and its other spin-off series alongside Favreau. Another executive producer, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy, explained that Watts had approached her about making a Star Wars series inspired by the Amblin film The Goonies (1985). Kennedy, who had served as an executive producer on that film and as co-founder of Amblin Entertainment, said Skeleton Crew \"evolved out of that kind of enthusiasm in wanting to tell stories in this space\". Favreau felt that when Watts and Ford had pitched the series to Kennedy, they were \"speaking right to the person who was there and knows the 11 herbs and spices that go into it\". Ford said Kennedy told them that she never thought of Amblin's films as being for kids, but rather being stories that \"just happen to be about kids, a story of a kid going on an adventure\". This inspired him to develop the show for audiences of all ages.\nIn March 2023, Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, as well as David Lowery were revealed to have directed an episode each. The following month, Jake Schreier, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Lee Isaac Chung were announced as additional directors. By August 2024, Watts and Ford were considered to be showrunners of the series. Colin Wilson also executive produces, with Susan McNamara and John Bartnicki as producers.\nWriting\nMyung Joh Wesner also serves as writer on the series, alongside Ford and Watts. Skeleton Crew was confirmed to occur within the same time frame as The Mandalorian and Ahsoka, referencing those series along with the Star Wars films. Ford had described Skeleton Crews tone as being an \"adventure\", desiring to make it an enjoyable series, but also containing danger. He had further gone on to say that the situation would be \"extra fraught\" when the kids were in danger. Jude Law had said that his character was \"a lot of the world that they experience: contradictory, and at times a place of nurture and other times a place of threat\" and that the series would be conveyed through the perspective of the children. Law had also concurred with Ford in agreeing that the series would also depict danger, calling the relationship between the children and adults a \"goofy relationship ... And then other times it's really quite dark and quite scary\". He added that he and the young cast were \"in constant state of confusion and jeopardy and challenge\", with Skeleton Crew depicting them working together to overcome those fears. Favreau had also wanted the series to convey many tones that \"reflects the storyteller of the filmmaker\", which had been the same method he had used when working on The Mandalorian.\nDesign\nLouise Mingenbach serves as the costume designer.\nCasting\nWith the February 2022 reports, it was believed the series was looking for four children, about 10 years old and one 30-to-40-year-old actor as its series regulars. Casting of the four pre-teen actors was still underway in May 2022, with Law revealed to be cast in the lead role, reported to be a Force-user, at the end of the month. In April 2023, Ravi Cabot-Conyers, Kyriana Kratter, Robert Timothy Smith, and Ryan Kiera Armstrong were revealed as the series' lead children, with Tunde Adebimpe and Kerry Condon also starring. The next month, Jaleel White revealed that he would appear in the series as a pirate. In July 2024, the series' key characters were revealed: Law portrays Jod Na Nawood, with Cabot-Conyers as Wim, Kratter as KB, Smith as Neel, and Armstrong as Fern. Nick Frost was also revealed to be voicing a droid in the series named SM-33.\nFilming\nPrincipal photography had been happening for \"a few weeks\" by early September 2022, at Manhattan Beach Studios in Los Angeles County, under the working title Grammar Rodeo (a reference to The Simpsonss episode \"Bart on the Road\"). Filming was previously scheduled to take place from June to December. Sean Porter, David Klein, and Paul Hughen served as cinematographers. The series utilized the StageCraft Volume technology in addition to stop-motion animation, headed by Phil Tippett, and matte paintings with one of Industrial Light & Magic's former painters coming out of retirement to work on the paintings. Lowery said his episode included a member of the Teek species from the television film Ewoks: The Battle for Endor (1985) who was created using a puppet; Lowery enjoyed the combination of puppetry, which he called \"the most ancient technology\", and the series' other cutting-edge effects. Filming officially wrapped on January 22, 2023.\nPost-production\nAndrew S. Eisen serves as an editor on the series. Eisen previously worked on The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett. John Knoll served as the visual effects supervisor, with Industrial Light & Magic, DNEG, Image Engine, Tippett Studio, BOT VFX, and Cantina Creative providing visual effects.\nMusic\nIn November 2024, Mick Giacchino was revealed to have composed the score for the series. His father, Michael Giacchino, previously composed the score for the Star Wars film Rogue One (2016) as well as Watts's Marvel Cinematic Universe Spider-Man films. Mick wanted the main theme for Skeleton Crew to \"capture that feeling of being a kid, looking out at the twin suns, and knowing that there's an adventure out there waiting for you\". It consists of a simple chord sequence arranged for \"harps and synths to create this kind of whimsical floating feeling\". Watts associated the opening four chords of the theme with the four main characters. The score was recorded at the Newman Scoring Stage at the Fox Studio Lot.\nMarketing\nThe first footage for the series was revealed at Star Wars Celebration London in April 2023. The first official trailer and key art was released that August at Disney's D23 convention.\nRelease\nSkeleton Crew premiered on Disney+ on December 2, 2024, with its first two episodes. The other six episodes were released weekly from December 10 to January 14, 2025. A 2023 premiere was first announced at Star Wars Celebration in May 2022, with White expecting the series to be released in November or December of that year. By late 2023, Skeleton Crew was set to be released in 2024, with a United States Copyright Office filing for the first episode indicating an approximate release in January. By July 2024, the series was set to premiere on December 3, 2024, before it was moved up a day in November to the December 2 date.\nReception\nViewership\nStar Wars: Skeleton Crew was the No. 2 program on Disney+'s Top 10 list by December 29, 2024. TVision, using its Power Score to evaluate CTV programming through viewership and engagement across over 1,000 apps, estimated that it was the most-streamed show from December 2–8, 2024. It remained among the top 10 most-streamed series from December 9 through the week of January 19, 2025. Whip Media, which tracks viewership data for the more than 25 million worldwide users of its TV Time app, reported that Skeleton Crew was the fourth most-streamed original series in the U.S. for the week ending December 8. It remained in the top ten from December 22 to January 19.  The streaming aggregator Reelgood, which tracks real-time data from 20 million U.S. users for original and acquired content across SVOD and AVOD services, ranked it as the eight most-streamed show in the U.S. for the week ending December 18. Screen Engine/ASI, which tracks the top ten most-mentioned entertainment options through a survey of over 1,000 consumers, reported that Skeleton Crew was the tenth most-mentioned title from December 28 to January 3 with 1.5% of all mentions.\nStreaming analytics firm FlixPatrol, which monitors daily updated VOD charts and streaming ratings across the globe, stated that it became Disney+'s No. 1 TV show worldwide as of January 2. Luminate, which gathers viewership data from certain smart TVs in the U.S., calculated that Skeleton Crew was streamed for 914 million minutes in 2024. According to market research company Parrot Analytics, which looks at consumer engagement in consumer research, streaming, downloads, and on social media, the show was in the top 10 digital originals chart in Canada during the week of December 30 to January 5. It achieved a demand average of 23.7 times more than the average TV series in Canada, securing the No. 10 spot on the chart. Nielsen Media Research, which records streaming viewership on U.S. television screens, estimated that Skeleton Crew garnered 6.3 million viewers in the U.S. over its first 35 days, making it one of the most popular shows of the 2024–2025 season.\nCritical response\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 92% of 139 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's critic consensus reads, \"Evoking childlike wonder, Skeleton Crew is a swashbuckling Star Wars adventure that refreshingly keeps things simple.\" On Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, the series holds a score of 72/100, based on 23 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.\nAlison Herman of Variety wrote, \"Skeleton Crew takes Star Wars to new places only in the literal sense. But the show is able to nail its limited brief, and make a Star Wars show that's actually rooted in childhood rather than evoking memories of one's own.\" Daniel Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"The generally low-stakes, thematically light, young-skewing romp takes us into under-explored corners of the seemingly boundless galaxy while feeling pleasantly familiar.\" Kelly Lawler of USA Today wrote, \"What stands out most when watching the series is that it feels so very influenced; it's not just a Star Wars series, it's Star Wars plus something. It's gimmicky and not just a little cookie-cutter in its expansion of the sci-fi franchise, which gets diluted the more shows Disney+ cranks out.\"\nIn a mixed review, Ben Travers of IndieWire wrote, \"Star Wars: Skeleton Crew gets off to a depressingly familiar start, while bungling the introduction of its primary protagonists and generally plodding along until Jude Law pops up.\" Zach Handlen of The Boston Globe wrote, \"All of these assets are buried under one problem: this is a premise that doesn't know how to be a TV show yet.\"\nAccolades\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" | 2024\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 23rd Visual Effects Society Awards\n| Outstanding Visual Effects in a Photoreal Episode,  and\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n| Outstanding Effects Simulations in an Episode, Commercial, Game Cinematic or Real-Time Project\n|\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Compositing and Lighting in an Episode\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"20\" | 2025\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 2025 Kids' Choice Awards\n| Favorite Family TV Show\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n| Favorite Male TV Star (Family)\n| Jude Law\n|\n|-\n| Favorite Female TV Star (Family)\n| Ryan Kiera Armstrong\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"17\" | 4th Children's and Family Emmy Awards\n| Outstanding Young Teen Series\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"17\" |\n|-\n| Outstanding Lead Performer in a Preschool, Children's or Young Teen Program\n| Jude Law\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Younger Performer in a Preschool, Children's or Young Teen Program\n| Ravi Cabot-Conyers\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Writing for a Young Teen Series\n| \"This Could Be a Real Adventure\"\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Directing for a Live Action Series\n| \"This Could Be a Real Adventure\"\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Cinematography and Technical Arts for a Single Camera Live Action Program\n| \"This Could Be a Real Adventure\"\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Editing for a Young Teen Live Action Program\n| \"The Real Good Guys\"\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Editing for a Young Teen Live Action Program\n| \"We're Gonna Be in So Much Trouble\"\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Editing for a Young Teen Live Action Program\n| \"You Have a Lot to Learn About Pirates\"\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Sound Mixing and Sound Editing for a Live Action Program\n| \"You Have a Lot to Learn About Pirates\"\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Art Direction / Set Decoration / Scenic Design\n| \"You Have a Lot to Learn About Pirates\"\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Costume Design / Styling\n| \"Way, Way Out Past the Barrier\"\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Hairstyling and Makeup\n| \"Zero Friends Again\"\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Show Open\n|\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Visual Effects for a Live Action Program\n|\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Casting for a Live Action Program\n|\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Stunt Coordination for a Live Action Program\n|\n|\n|-\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*"
