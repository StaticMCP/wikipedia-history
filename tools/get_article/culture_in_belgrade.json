As a centuries-old crossroads of civilizations, Belgrade hosts many significant cultural events, including FEST (International Film Festival), BITEF (Belgrade International Theatre Festival), BELEF (Belgrade Summer Festival), BEMUS (Belgrade Music Festival), the Belgrade Book Fair, and the Belgrade Beer Fest. The city has been and remains a home and inspiration to many prominent artists, writers, and scientists, and its numerous cultural institutions, galleries, museums, theatres, and libraries make it a vital cultural hub of Southeastern Europe.\nHistorical development of culture in Belgrade\nThe cultural history of Belgrade dates back to antiquity, when the Roman city and military camp of Singidunum existed on its site. Traces of Roman culture are visible in archaeological findings. During the Middle Ages, Belgrade was an important strategic fortification on the border of various empires (Byzantine, Frankish, Bulgarian, Hungarian) and Serbian states. In the medieval period, particularly during the Serbian Despotate under Despot Stefan Lazarević in the early 15th century, Belgrade became the capital and experienced a significant cultural upswing, with strong fortifications, courtly life, and scribal activities.\nCenturies of Ottoman rule (from 1521, with interruptions) brought Oriental influences to the city's architecture, urban planning, crafts, and way of life. Mosques, hammams, and caravanserai were built. Simultaneously, the Christian, primarily Serbian, population persisted in the city with its religious and cultural life, albeit under difficult conditions.\nWith the restoration of Serbian statehood in the 19th century, Belgrade once again became the capital (first of the Principality of Serbia, then the Kingdom of Serbia) and began its rapid development into the political, economic, and cultural center of Serbia. Key national institutions were founded, such as the National Theatre (1868), the National Museum of Serbia (1844), the Great School (Velika škola) (1808, predecessor to the University of Belgrade), the Serbian Royal Academy (1886, today SANU – Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts), and the National Library of Serbia. The city became a hub for literary, artistic, and scientific life.\nIn the 20th century, as the capital of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and later the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Belgrade further developed as a multicultural center and one of the most important cultural hubs in Southeastern Europe. This period saw significant achievements in all fields of art, the establishment of new institutions, and the city becoming a host for international festivals. After the breakup of Yugoslavia and during the period of transition, Belgrade has continued to be a dynamic cultural center with a rich and diverse contemporary scene.\nArts and architecture\nVisual arts\n, \"The Cock Fight\" (c. 1897), oil on canvas]]\nThe visual arts scene in Belgrade reflects the broader trends of Serbian and European art. In the 19th century, artists such as Katarina Ivanović, Đura Jakšić (also a prominent poet), and later Uroš Predić and Paja Jovanović (leading representatives of Academic Realism) left a significant mark, and their works form important parts of Belgrade's museum collections. The beginning of the 20th century brought the influences of Modernism. Nadežda Petrović is considered a founder of Serbian modern painting, introducing elements of Impressionism, Fauvism, and Expressionism. Sava Šumanović, though born in Šid, spent significant creative periods in Paris and Belgrade, moving through phases of Cubism and Poetic Realism.\nin Belgrade, guardian of a rich artistic heritage]]\nThe interwar period in Belgrade was marked by the activities of numerous artists and groups following avant-garde trends. After World War II, following a brief period of Socialist Realism, the Belgrade art scene opened up to abstract art (e.g., Petar Lubarda, whose 1951 exhibition marked a turning point), Art Informel, and later Conceptual art. Significant painters associated with Belgrade in the second half of the 20th century include Milan Konjović, Marko Čelebonović, Mića Popović, as well as internationally renowned artists Vladimir Veličković and Ljuba Popović.\nBelgrade today is a center of contemporary visual arts, with numerous galleries exhibiting works by domestic and international artists. Among the most significant exhibition spaces are the Gallery of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU Gallery), the Salon of the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Cvijeta Zuzorić Art Pavilion, the Gallery of the Cultural Centre of Belgrade, the Gallery of the Youth Centre, and the Gallery of the Student Cultural Centre, as well as many private galleries.\nArchitecture\n, an example of Art Nouveau architecture in Belgrade]]\nThe architecture of Belgrade is diverse and reflects its complex history and various cultural influences. The oldest preserved parts of the city are within the Belgrade Fortress, which has been rebuilt and modified over centuries. From the Ottoman period, a few structures remain, such as the Bajrakli Mosque (16th century) and '''Princess Ljubica's Residence (1829–1831), which is an example of Balkan-Oriental urban architecture with elements of Classicism.\nIn the 19th century, Belgrade transformed into a European city. Representative public buildings and private palaces were constructed in the styles of Neoclassicism, Romanticism, and later Academicism (e.g., Captain Miša's Mansion (1863), the National Theatre (1869), the Old Palace (1882–1884)). The early 20th century saw the rise of Secession (Art Nouveau), with prominent examples like the Hotel Moskva (1908) and the Belgrade Cooperative building (1905–1907).\nThe interwar period (1918–1941) was an era of flourishing Modern architecture in Belgrade, influenced by Bauhaus and Art Deco. Architects such as Milan Zloković, Branislav Kojić, Dragiša Brašovan, and Nikola Dobrović designed significant public and residential buildings (e.g., the Rectorate Building of the University of Belgrade, the PRIZAD building).\nAfter World War II, mass construction took place in New Belgrade in the styles of Socialist Modernism and later Brutalism. Notable examples include the Palace of Serbia (SIV Building), the Genex Tower''' (Western City Gate), and numerous residential blocks. Contemporary architecture continues to shape the city's appearance.\nLiterature and publishing\n| image2            = S.
