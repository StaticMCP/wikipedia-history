The film stars Frazier, Cara Buono, Susan Egan, Dwight Ewell and Anthony Rapp.\nMan of the Century was filmed in black and white. Its working title was \"Johnny Twennies\".\nPlot\nMan of the Century is a farce set in the 1990s about Johnny Twennies, a reporter stuck in the era of 1920s and 1930s pop culture.\nMain characters\n* Johnny Twennies – (Gibson Frazier) A lovable, good-looking, fast-talking newspaper reporter whose manner is similar to that of a 1920s pulp magazine character.\n* Virginia Clemens - (Cara Buono) A sweet girl who has an innocent school-girl crush on Johnny.\n* Samantha Winter - (Susan Egan) Johnny's modern girlfriend.\nCritical reception\nThe New York Times wrote in its review, \"This farcical riff on movie nostalgia echoes early Woody Allen (and Stanley Tucci's recent comedy, The Impostors) in its lampooning of the hoariest celluloid stereotypes. The movie is also shrewd enough to avoid wearing out its welcome. It's only 77 minutes long.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
