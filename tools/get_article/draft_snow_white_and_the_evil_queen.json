It was originally set to star actress and former Daily Wire commentator Brett Cooper as Snow White. It was set to be released through Bentkey, The Daily Wire's subscription streaming app for children, sometime in 2025.\nCast\n*Brett Cooper as Snow White\nProduction\nOn October 16, 2023, concurrent with the centennial of the founding of Disney, Daily Wire CEO Jeremy Boreing announced the launch of a children's content service known as Bentkey, available that day. In the announcement, Boreing accused Disney of pushing \"all the worst excesses of the woke Left\".\nCoinciding with the release of Bentkey, Boreing announced the production of a live-action adaptation of the original Snow White story, Snow White and the Evil Queen. The announcement came after what The Hollywood Reporter described as a right-wing backlash against Disney's upcoming Snow White remake. Boreing said that the film would be about \"a princess and a prince, about beauty and vanity, about love and its power to raise us from death to life.\" It will be the first feature-length production by the Bentkey brand.\nThe film was originally to star Daily Wire commentator Brett Cooper as Snow White. However, on December 10, 2024, Cooper announced her departure from The Daily Wire effective immediately following the end of her last video published that same day.\nCancellation\nThe film was expected to be released in 2025. However, in January 2025, the project was subsequently canceled.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
