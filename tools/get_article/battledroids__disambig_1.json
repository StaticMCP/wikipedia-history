Much of the design is clearly specific to robot combat and succeeds in capturing the flavour of this sort of battle. As it stands, Battledroids is a very good robot combat system, but very little in terms of a 'game'. The production quality leads one to expect more.\"\nAaron Allston reviewed Battledroids in The Space Gamer No. 75. Allston commented that \"My recommendation? Buy Battledroids if you'd like a giant-robots boardgame that has nothing to do with the Japanese cartoons. It's a decent game. You won't throw away any of your other games to play Battledroids full-time, but you'll be adequately entertained.\"\nReviews\n*''Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine\n*Asimov's Science Fiction'' v9 n12 (1985 12)\nReferences"
