Wavell was leading a patrol of British troops and African police pursuing from Mau Mau who had beheaded a loyal Kikuyu tribesman in the Thaika area. They tracked down about 20 of the Mau Mau who opened fire, killing Wavell immediately. The battle went for ten hours.\nWavell had lost his left hand in Burma during World War II. He had no heirs so his death meant the end of the Wavell line.\nReferences"
