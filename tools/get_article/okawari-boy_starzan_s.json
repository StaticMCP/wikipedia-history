The former live in the wooded region while the latter inhabit the desert area, who are anxious to move to and settle on the woodland for better lives. This desire causes incessant strife around the border zones. The Senobi tribe love nature and want to live in peace without being harassed by the others. On the other hand, the formerly high-tech Robot tribe have become militant as they want to expand their sphere of influence from the desert to the wooded region. A young hero of the Senobi tribe together with his supporters makes efforts to stop the feud between the two tribes and to help them live in peace.\nCast\n* Kazuhiko Inoue as Hoshio Yumeno / Starzan
