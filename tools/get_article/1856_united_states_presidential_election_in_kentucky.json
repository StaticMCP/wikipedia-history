Voters chose 12 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nKentucky voted for the Democratic candidate, James Buchanan, over American Party candidate Millard Fillmore. Buchanan won Kentucky by a margin of 5.08%. This was the first time the Democrats carried Kentucky since 1828, before the creation of the Whig party. Beginning with this election, Kentucky became a reliably Democratic state, only voting against the party twice (in 1896 and 1924) between the Civil War and World War II.\nRepublican Party candidate John C. Frémont was not on the ballot in the state.\nResults\n}}\nReferences"
