Based on an early script of the three hour series premiere \"Saga of a Star World\", this adaptation was also released in a tabloid format and then later as a paperback as well. The tabloid version was also printed by Whitman Comics. Its success led Marvel to print a regular monthly comic.\nWhen the regular run of Marvel's Battlestar Galactica comic book began some months later, the Super Special adaptation was expanded by several pages, and provided the material for the first three issues of the comic.\nThe direct adaptation of the series continued in issues #4 and #5 which chronicled the adventures depicted in the two part television episode, \"Lost Planet of the Gods\". Roger McKenzie continued as scripter, with Walter Simonson now providing the art.\nBy issue #6 the TV adaptations ceased, and Marvel's team began to create new stories about the characters of the Battlestar Galactica universe, picking up from where issue #5 left off. From this point, both in terms of story content and the narrative arc, Marvel's Battlestar Galactica deviates from the televised adventures. Marvel's contract with Universal Studios specifically did not allow them to use anything from the television series that followed \"Lost Planet of the Gods\". This adaption more closely followed the novelization of the two-hour movie, Saga of a Star World, than the ABC television series.\nAlthough the run of the Battlestar Galactica comic coincided with the broadcast of the short-lived Galactica sequel series, Galactica 1980 on ABC, the newer program was never referred to in the pages of the comic, apart from the letters page.\nNotably, the writers of the Galactica comic were quite willing to remove key characters from the dramatic mix for periods of time. From issues #6 to #12, Commander Adama is placed within a machine to help him remember the ancient writings he briefly saw on Kobol and, although we do spend some time in his dreams, he is effectively removed from commanding the Galactica for several issues.\nAnother character who leaves the series for a while is Starbuck. In this plotline, the fleet comes across Scavenger World, and the female space pirate Eurayle, who makes a deal to spare the Colonials if Starbuck remains with her. Starbuck does so, and the fleet moves on without him, setting up his return in issues #19 and #20.\nUnlike both television series, the Galactica comic had a planned ending, with a series of plot devices being wound up in the final two part story of issues #22 and #23. In the course of solving a mystery, Lieutenant Jolly finds adventure and romance and helps in figuring out the long sought coordinates for Earth. This adventure drawn and scripted by Walt Simonson provided a natural conclusion for the storyline.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Marvel Comics issues\n| Issue\n| Title\n| Writer\n| Penciller\n| Cover\n| Notes\n|-\n| #1\n| Battlestar Galactica\n| Roger McKenzie\n| Ernie Colon\n| Dave Cockrum, Bob McLeod\n| adapts episode 1\n|-\n| #2\n| Exodus\n| Roger McKenzie\n| Ernie Colon\n|\n| adapts episode 2\n|-\n| #3\n| Death Trap\n| Roger McKenzie\n| Ernie Colon\n| Rudy Nebres\n| adapts episode 3\n|-\n| #4\n|  The Lost Gods of Kobol\n| Roger McKenzie\n| Walt Simonson\n| Walt Simonson, Klaus Janson\n| adapts episode 4\n|-\n| #5\n| The Lost Gods of Kobol: Part Two - A Death in the Family\n| Roger McKenzie\n| Walt Simonson\n| Walt Simonson, Klaus Janson\n| adapts episode 5\n|-\n| #6\n| The Memory Machine\n| Roger McKenzie\n| Rich Buckler\n| Rich Buckler, Klaus Janson\n| Beginning of Memory Machine story arc(lasts through Issue #12)\n|-\n| #7\n| All Things Past and Present\n| Roger McKenzie\n| Rich Buckler\n| Klaus Janson\n|\n|-\n| #8\n| Shuttle-Diplomacy\n| Bill Mantlo\n| Sal Buscema\n| Rich Buckler, Klaus Janson\n| Flashback story\n|-\n| #9\n| Space-Mimic\n| Bill Mantlo\n| Sal Buscema, Klaus Janson\n| Pat Broderick, Terry Austin\n|\n|-\n| #10\n| This Planet Hungers\n| Tom DeFalco\n| Pat Broderick\n| Pat Broderick\n| Flashback story\n|-\n| #11\n| Scavenge World\n| Roger McKenzie, Walt Simonson\n| Walt Simonson\n| Walt Simonson, Klaus Janson\n| rowspan=\"3\" colspan=\"2\" | Scavenge World story arc/Departure of Starbuck\n|-\n| #12\n| The Trap\n| Roger McKenzie\n| Walt Simonson\n| Walt Simonson\n|-\n| #13\n| Collision Course\n| Roger McKenzie, Walt Simonson\n| Walt Simonson\n| Walt Simonson\n|-\n| #14\n| Trial and Error\n| Roger McKenzie\n| Jim Mooney\n| Walt Simonson\n|\n|-\n| #15\n| Derelict\n| Walt Simonson, Roger McKenzie\n| Walt Simonson, Klaus Janson\n| Walt Simonson\n| Flashback story\n|-\n| #16\n| Berserker\n| Bob Layton, Roger McKenzie\n| Walt Simonson\n| Walt Simonson\n|\n|-\n| #17\n| Ape and Essence\n| Walt Simonson, Steven Grant\n| Walt Simonson\n| Klaus Janson\n| rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"| Two-issue story arc\n|-\n| #18\n| Forbidden Fruit\n| Walt Simonson, Steven Grant\n| Sal Buscema, Klaus Janson\n| Michael Golden\n|-\n| #19\n| The Daring Escape of the Space Cowboy\n| Walt Simonson\n| Walt Simonson\n| Walt Simonson\n| rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"| Return of Starbuck\n|-\n| #20\n| Hell Hath No Fury\n| Walt Simonson\n| Walt Simonson\n| Walt Simonson\n|-\n| #21\n| A World For the Killing\n| Steven Grant, Walt Simonson\n| Brent Anderson\n| Brent Anderson, Klaus Janson\n|\n|-\n| #22\n| Black is the Color of My True Love's Hair\n| Walt Simonson\n| Walt Simonson\n| Walt Simonson\n| rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Series-ending story arc\n|-\n| #23\n| The Last Hiding Place\n| Walt Simonson\n| Walt Simonson\n| Walt Simonson\n|}\nReprints and compilations\n* Marvel Super Special  #8: Battlestar Galactica\n* Marvel Illustrated Book: BSG, Volume I\n* Marvel Illustrated Book: BSG, Volume II\n* Star Heroes Pocket Books #1-11\n* Star Heroes Winter Special\n* Saga of a Star World (Titan Press)\n* The Memory Machine (Titan Press)\nLook-In\nThis children's magazine published a serialized BSG strip from October 20, 1979, to October 11, 1980. The four untitled storylines spanned 52 issues, 13 two-page chapters per storyline, from 1979 #43 to 1980 #42 (the numbering started over again at #1 in January 1980, though the storyline continued to fold as normal). Surprisingly well-rendered and well written, this ongoing Galactica comic has been all but forgotten.\nLook-In Magazine—Weekly Serial\n* Storyline 1 (issues 1979 #43 to 1979 #52; reset numbering in 1980: 1980 #1 to 1980 #3)\n* Storyline 2 (issues 1980 #4 to 1980 #16)\n* Storyline 3 (issues 1980 #17 to 1980 #29)\n* Storyline 4 (issues 1980 #30 to 1980 #42)\nTélé-Junior (France)\nA French-made comic-book series of 28 episodes, based on Battlestar Galactica, was published from 1981 to 1982 in Télé-Junior, a French TV-themed comic magazine similar to Look-In, with art by Gerald Forton. The comic was simultaneously published in Super J, a companion magazine to Télé-Junior.\nBritish annuals\nIn addition, Grandreams came out with two Battlestar Galactica hardcover annuals, which contained short text and comic book stories. These comics were aimed primarily at children.\nBattlestar Galactica—Hardcover Annual\n# Battlestar Galactica (adapts episode 1 - 3)\n# Chess-Players of Space\n# Bane of Baal Farr\n# Amazons of Space\n# Plus 3 prose stories: Doomsday Rock, Swamp World, Hijack in Space\nMission Galactica: The Cylon Attack—Hardcover Annual\n# Part One: Switch in Space\n# Part Two: Planet of the Cyclops\n# Part Three: Skirmish Beyond Skafrax\n# Part Four: Final Showdown\n# Plus 2 prose stories: Dice with Death/The Enemy Within\nMaximum Press\nIn July 1995, Maximum Press published a well received mini-series that explained what had happened to our heroes in the intervening years. Ignoring the storyline of the ABC sequel series Galactica 1980, this mini-series followed the crew as they approached Earth, led by Commander Apollo, who had succeeded his father.\nThe mini-series led to several sequels including \"Apollo's Journey\", \"The Enemy Within\", and \"Starbuck\", all published as three or four issue series in 1995 through early 1996. \"Journey's End\", the final four issue series, shows the Galactica travelling back through time to the Cylon attack on Caprica. After the Battlestar Galactica Compendium, published in early 1997, Maximum Press announced it would no longer be publishing Galactica based comics.\nMiniseries\n* The War of Eden #1-4 (also collected in trade paperback format  in December 1995)\n* The Enemy Within #1-3\n* Starbuck #1-3\n* Apollo's Journey 1-3 (issue #3 was published with 2 alternative covers)\n* Journey's End #1-4\nAsylum (monthly anthology series)\n* Issue 1:  Baptism of Fire, Part 1\n* Issue 2:  Baptism of Fire, Part 2\n* Issue 3:  Baptism of Fire, Part 3\n* Issue 4:  Athena's Quest, Part 1 (originally titled Apollo's Quest)\n* Issue 5:  Athena's Quest, Part 2 (originally titled Apollo's Quest)\n* (No BSG story in issue 6)\n* Issue 7:  Athena's Quest, Part 3 (originally titled Apollo's Quest)\n* Issue 8:  First Date\n* (No BSG story in issue 9)\n* Issue 10:  The Rebirth of Cy, Part 1 (unfinished)\n* (No BSG story in issue 11)\nCompilations\n* Battlestar Galactica: The Compendium\n(Collects Baptism of Fire and The Rebirth of Cy)\n* Battlestar Galactica: Special Edition\n(Collects Athena's Quest)\nRealm Press\nIn 1998, Realm Press published their \"Battlestar Galactica Search for Sanctuary\" single issue special.
