Between 16 and 17 January 1836, the Liberals occupied Arlaban after dislodging the Carlist forces there.  The Liberals were commanded by Luis Fernández de Córdova and were supported by the British Legion, French Legion, and units commanded by Baldomero Espartero; the forces were divided along three fronts.  After conquering Arlabán as well as Legutiano (Villarreal de Álava), however, the Liberals were pushed back by the Carlists on 18 January, suffering a large number of casualties.\nExternal links\n* [http://zm.gipuzkoakultura.net/historiamilitardelsiglo19/batalla-arlaban.php?titulo=ARLABAN.%2024-V-1836&negrita=arl Historia militar del siglo XIX en el País Vasco], Diputación Foral de Guipúzcoa.\n\n---\n\n## Battle of Arlaban\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of Arlabán"
