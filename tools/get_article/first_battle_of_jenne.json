French forces under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Louis Archinard seized the capital of Ahmadu Tall on the Bani River. The engagement was hard-fought and the results uncertain “until the last hour” according to French sources. Almami Ahmadu was forced to withdraw, and Umar Tall’s son Agibu was placed on the throne as a puppet ruler.\nSee also\n*Second Battle of Jenné\n*Tukulor Empire\n*History of Mali\nReferences\nSources\n*\n\n---\n\n## First Battle of Jenne\n\n#REDIRECT First Battle of Jenné"
