Virtually all Western countries cut off diplomatic relations with Gaddafi's government over an aerial bombing campaign in February and March, and a number of other countries led by Peru and Botswana did likewise. The regime's use of the Libyan Air Force to strike civilians led to the adoption of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 to create a Libyan no-fly zone on 17 March, though several countries involved in the resolution's enforcement have also carried out regular strike missions to degrade the offensive capacity of the Libyan Army and destroy the regime's command and control capabilities, effectively acting in de facto support of anti-Gaddafi forces on the ground. Many members of the international community, including the United Nations, the Arab League, and the African Union, explicitly recognized the anti-Gaddafi National Transitional Council as Libya's legitimate representative, with many of those countries explicitly describing it as the legal interim government of the country due to the perceived loss of legitimacy on the part of Gaddafi's regime.\nMany states also either issued travel advisories or attempted evacuations. Some evacuations were successful in either going to Malta or via land borders to Egypt or Tunisia; other attempts were hindered by tarmac damage at Benghazi's airport or refusals of permission to land in Tripoli. There were also several solidarity protests in other countries that were mostly composed of Libyan expatriates. Financial markets around the world had adverse reactions to the instability with oil prices rising to a two-and-a-half-year high.\nSupranational\n{| style=\"float:right; clear:right; margin:1em; width:18em; border:1px solid #a0a0a0; padding:4px; background:#f5f5f5; text-align:left;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| Security Council Resolution 1973 (no-fly zone and other measures)\n|- style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|Countries committed to enforcement:\n|- style=\"text-align:left; font-size:x-small;\"\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:left; font-size:x-small;\"\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:left; font-size:x-small;\"\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:left; font-size:x-small;\"\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:left; font-size:x-small;\"\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:left; font-size:x-small;\"\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:left; font-size:x-small;\"\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:left; font-size:x-small;\"\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:left; font-size:x-small;\"\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:left; font-size:x-small;\"\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:left; font-size:x-small;\"\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:left; font-size:x-small;\"\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:left; font-size:x-small;\"\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:left; font-size:x-small;\"\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:left; font-size:x-small;\"\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:left; font-size:x-small;\"\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:left; font-size:x-small;\"\n|\n|}\n*African Union – The chairman of the African Union Commission Jean Ping said the AU was in contact with the Libyan government and that it condemned the crackdown against protesters. As of a 7 March meeting with a UK representative, they had little more to add. On 11 March they announced a panel, consisting of the leaders of South Africa, Uganda, Mauritania, the Republic of the Congo, and Mali, to travel to Libya to help end the violence. They also rejected a no-fly zone and any intervention by Western powers, but supported an \"African solution\" of reform.\n* – Secretary-General Amr Moussa stated initially that he was deeply concerned about the situation in Libya and urged for immediate stop of the violence. Later, after an emergency meeting on 22 February, the organisation suspended Libya from taking part in council meetings and Moussa issued a statement condemning the \"crimes against the current peaceful popular protests and demonstrations in several Libyan cities.\" On 7 March, Moussa said Gaddafi had to seek \"reconciliation\" with his people if he was to remain in power, but he also suggested many in the Libyan opposition would not be open to such efforts. The Arab League met on Saturday 12 March and voted to ask the UN Security Council to impose a no-fly zone, with Algeria and Syria being the only members to vote against the measure.\n* – The High Representative of the European Union for External Policy, Catherine Ashton has condemned the crackdown of protests by Libyan authorities and pushed back any threat of Tripoli towards the EU. \"The European Union is extremely concerned about the events unfolding in Libya and the reported deaths of a very high number of demonstrators. The EU urges the authorities to exercise restraint and calm and to immediately refrain from further use of violence against peaceful demonstrators. The legitimate aspirations and demands of the people for reform must be addressed through open and meaningful Libya-led dialogue. (...) We have heard threats, we hear people saying you should do this, you should do that, but in the end the EU will do what is right,\" Ashton replied concerning threats Libya delivered to the rotating Hungarian presidency of the EU, stating that Tripoli would end co-operation on blocking irregular immigration into the EU if Brussels did not side with Gaddafi. The European Union held meetings regarding Libya on Thursday and Friday, 11–12 March 2011. The European Union's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, flew to Cairo on 13 March to meet with leaders of the Arab League and discuss a \"collaborative approach\" with Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa on Libya and the rest of the region, and would also meet with Egypt's Essam Sharaf and Nabil Elaraby.\n*Group of Eight – Foreign ministers from the G8 met on 14 March in Paris to discuss the situation and a possible no-fly zone.\n* – On 8 March, the GCC issued a joint statement calling on the UN Security Council to impose an air embargo (no-fly zone) on Libya to protect civilians. On 28 March, after member state Qatar announced it was transferring diplomatic recognition of Libya from Gaddafi's government to the National Transitional Council in Benghazi, the GCC publicly backed the move.\n*International Criminal Court – On 27 June, ICC has issued arrest warrants for Muammar Gaddafi, Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi and Abdualla Al-Senussi. During the press conference the next day, the ICC prosecutor said that his Office would not focus on crimes allegedly committed by rebels until after the investigations against Gaddafi and his inner circle.\n* – Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in a statement said that bombs against civilians \"if confirmed, would constitute a serious violation of international humanitarian law and would be condemned by the secretary-general in the strongest terms.\" He later issued another statement saying he was \"outraged.\"\n**Security Council president and Permanent Representative of Brazil to the UN Maria Luiza Viotti said in a statement after closed-door consultations that the Security Council \"condemned the violence and use of force against civilians, deplored the repression against peaceful demonstrators, and expressed deep regret at the deaths of hundreds of civilians\" and also called for \"an immediate end to the violence and for steps to address the legitimate demands of the population, including through national dialogue. They underscored the need to hold to account those responsible for [the] attacks, including by forces under their control, on civilians.\"\n**In the evening of 26 February, the Security Council voted unanimously to pass resolution 1970 introduced by France, the UK, Germany and the US that would sanction ten top Libyan officials, Gaddafi and his family. It also issued travel bans and an arms embargo. The Security Council also referred the situation to the International Criminal Court for a war crimes investigation into \"widespread and systemic attacks\" against protesters. It was only the second time the Security Council had referred a case to the ICC (the first being Darfur) and the first unanimous referral.\n**Navi Pillay, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, condemned the violence employed by security forces for its use of live ammunition against protesters.\n**On 17 March, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1973 (2011) for a Libyan no-fly zone and all measures, short of an occupying ground force, needed to protect civilians. Ten members backed the resolution and five abstained, but only nine votes were needed for it to pass.\n**On 9 August, the head of UNESCO, Irina Bokova stated that she deplores the NATO strike on Libyan State TV, Al-Jamahiriya that killed three journalists and wounding more. She also stated \"media outlets should not be targeted in military actions\".\n**On 11 August, after the 9 August NATO airstrike on Majer, that allegedly killed 85 civilians, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on \"all sides\" to do as much as possible to avoid killing innocent people.\nGovernments\nMiddle East and North Africa (MENA)\n* – Algeria was one of just two countries (with Syria) to vote against the Arab League resolution that called on the United Nations to impose a no-fly zone over Libya. Algeria has faced a mounting humanitarian crisis as many fleeing strife in Libya attempt to cross the common border between the two Maghreb states. On 29 March, Interior Minister Dahou Ould Kablia announced the Algerian Army was increasing its security presence on the border with Libya, citing concerns over potential infiltration by Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, a terrorist group Tripoli has repeatedly claimed is attempting to overthrow the Libyan government. \"The border with Libya has become a threat to Algeria's security,\" Ould Kablia said, claiming that Algerian soldiers recently intercepted and killed a \"terrorist\" crossing into Algeria from Libya.\n* – Foreign Minister Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed bin Mohammed Al Khalifa speaking to Al Jazeeras David Frost, when asked of the comparative responses in Libya and his own country called the situation in Libya \"tragic.\" Bahrain is a member of the Libya Contact Group. On 23 August, he announced that Manama recognised the National Transitional Council as \"the sole legitimate authority of the brotherly Libyan people\".\n* – Inspiration for the Libyan protests was linked to the successful overthrow of president Hosni Mubarak. The post-revolution military junta in Egypt is quietly arming rebels in Libya, according to reports. Speaking on 18 March (17 March EST) in Delhi, India, presidential candidate and revolutionary leader Mohamed ElBaradei called upon the United Nations Security Council ahead of a scheduled vote to authorize international military action to support the Libyan rebels. On 22 August, the Egyptian government said it recognised the National Transitional Council.\n* – President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad condemned the crackdown, asking rhetorically, \"How can a leader subject his own people to a shower of machine-guns, tanks and bombs? How can a leader bomb his own people, and afterwards say 'I will kill anyone who says anything?'\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast also condemned the Libyan government's crackdown stating \"the Islamic Republic of Iran deems the Libyans' uprising and their rightful demands in line with the region's Islamic awakening.\" However, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei also condemned the NATO intervention in Libya saying that it was aimed at \"getting their hands on its oil.\"\n* – Iraq sent a high-level delegation to a closed-door summit with world leaders in Paris on 19 March to discuss international action against Gaddafi's regime. Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari, representing both the Iraqi government and the Arab League, reportedly \"argued passionately in favor of action\" at the summit. The Cabinet formally recognised the National Transitional Council on 23 August.\n* – President Shimon Peres said from Spain that there was \"an irony of history\" that Gaddafi had once called for \"a Middle East without Israel\" but that \"there will be a Libya without Gaddafi.\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called both Libya and Iran, another country rocked by demonstrations in recent weeks, \"serial violators of human rights\" and said Gaddafi is \"massacring his opponents\". However, Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman suggested Israel should keep its distance from the Libyan opposition, while the Deputy Minister for the Development of Negev and the Galilee Ayoob Kara conducted direct talks with the Libyan government, represented by Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, for the establishment of official relations and for Libyan assistance in the release of a Hamas captive. The negotiations continued until the opposition took control of Tripoli.\n**Leader of the Opposition and former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni wrote that the protesters were part of \"days of momentous change in the Middle East\" and cautioned, \"In the best-case scenario, the wave sweeping across the region will enable democracy to take root in the Arab world ... but the negative scenario is that this opening will be abused by those ... who seek to use the democratic process to advance an anti-democratic agenda.\"\n* – On 24 May, Jordan recognized the National Transitional Council, and it upgraded its recognition of the NTC to consider as Libya's legal government as of 22 August. It is a participant in the NATO-led military intervention in Libya and a member of the Libya Contact Group.\n* – The government condemned Gaddafi and called for all Arab countries to condemn the violence. The Voice of Russia reported Kuwait recognized the National Transitional Council on 13 April 2011. Kuwait is a member of the Libya Contact Group.\n* – The Shia population was also reported to have taken notice that Musa Sadr's 1978 disappearance in Libya could be resolved. Lebanon introduced and voted for a United Nations Security Council resolution to establish a Libyan no-fly zone in response to persistent reports Gaddafi's forces were attacking civilians in Libya. Lebanon is a member of the Libya Contact Group. On 23 August, the Lebanese Cabinet decided to officially recognise the National Transitional Council.\n**Hezbollah said that \"anyone with honour and consciousness in this world cannot, and should not, keep silent on the massacres that the Gaddafi regime is committing across the country on a daily basis. Hezbollah firmly condemns crimes committed by the Gaddafi regime against the oppressed Libyan people. Hezbollah expresses support to the revolutionists (sic) in Libya and we pray that they will triumph over this arrogant tyrant.\"\n**Lebanon and Syria were said to be in talks on a possible rescue mission for its citizens.\n**Lebanon refused landing permission to a private Libyan aircraft with 10 people on board after Lebanon asked Libya to show the identities of the passengers before take off from Tripoli. Hannibal Gaddafi's wife Aline Skaff was reported to be one of the passengers.\n* – Several members of Parliament took the floor on 24 March to condemn the \"awful killings\" in Libya and express solidarity with the protesters.

Qatar recognized the National Transitional Council as Libya's legitimate government on 28 March amidst an emerging deal for Qatar's national oil company to market oil exported from the petroleum-rich territory administered by the Libya. Qatar is a member of the Libya Contact Group.\n* – The government announced recognition of the National Transitional Council on 24 August and said it was trying to establish \"practical relations\" with the body. On 26 October, President Omar al-Bashir claimed Khartoum supplied the anti-Gaddafi forces with humanitarian aid as well as weapons and ammunition, some of which were used in the capture of Tripoli in late August.\n* – President Bashar al-Assad has rejected any foreign intervention in Libya and called on the Libyan people to resist any threat and end the conflict. Syria was the only one of two Arab League states to vote against a request to the UN for a no-fly zone, the other country being Algeria. Syria has also said it was absolutely against foreign military forces or interference in Libya. The Syrian foreign ministry said- \"Syria affirms its rejection of all forms of foreign interference in Libyan affairs, since that would be a violation of Libya's sovereignty, its independence and the unity of its land,\". Libyan rebels allege that Syrian mercenaries were flying planes for the Libyan regime, and that they shot down two Syrian fighter planes.\n* – The Tunisian Revolution, which set off a revolutionary wave throughout the Middle East, was cited as an early inspiration for protests in Libya. Al Jazeera uncovered a secret diplomatic mission to post-revolutionary Tunis from Gaddafi's regime on 19 March, eventually prompting an intervention by Tunisian police to rescue the news team from harassment by the Libyan envoy and hotel security staff. Tunisian authorities have been overwhelmed by refugees from Libya attempting to cross the border since the Libyan uprising began, especially after the UN Security Council imposed a no-fly zone over Tunisia's larger eastern neighbor. On 20 April, the government reportedly closed at least some sections of Tunisia's border with Libya in response to the alleged incursion of Libyan troops loyal to Muammar Gaddafi into Tunisia in pursuit of refugees. Media reported allegations that rockets and ammunition were fired by Libyan forces across the border into Tunisia as well. State media later reported that at least 13 Libyan soldiers, including a Libyan Army general, turned themselves over to Tunisian troops at a border crossing after fleeing a successful rebel advance in the western Nafusa Mountains that left control on the Libyan side of the international border split between pro- and anti-Gaddafi forces. An Al Jazeera reporter in Tunisia presented a much higher estimate of the number of soldiers who surrendered themselves into Tunisian custody, saying as many as 100 defected. On 15 June, a government spokesman said Tunisia would recognize the National Transitional Council if it requested diplomatic recognition from Tunis. He said his government had remained neutral previously in the conflict, but after observing major attacks by Gaddafi against the civilian population as well as artillery strikes and troop incursions in Tunisian territory, it felt Gaddafi had lost \"all legitimacy\" and it had decided to support the would-be revolutionaries in Libya. Tunisia formally recognised the NTC on 20 August.\n* – The government condemned the violence against the protesters and president Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan instructed his family's charity foundation to provide relief aid to the people of Libya. The UAE recognized the National Transitional Council on 12 June and is a member of the Libya Contact Group.\nSub-Saharan Africa\n* – Oil Minister Jose Botelho de Vasconcelos attributed rising oil prices to \"the geopolitical situation in Libya and other countries\" on 13 April.\n* – In February, the government condemned the violence. \"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation has today, called in the Libyan representative to protest in the strongest possible terms, against the killings and condemn these actions. The government urges the Libyan government to exercise restraint in addressing the situation.\" Botswana then severed diplomatic ties with Libya on 23 February because \"the leader of Libya was not remorseful and made defiant pronouncements despite the violence visited on [its] people...\" The government issued a statement on 12 April professing support for African Union mediation efforts but echoing criticism directed at the proposal by Benghazi and several Western countries, noting that \"Botswana strongly believes that any new political dispensation which includes a role for Gaddafi, his family and members of his regime should not be considered under any circumstances\". On 20 April, The Botswana Gazette quoted a government official as saying that the government refused to accept a gift of agricultural equipment from the Libyan government. \"It has nothing to do with severing of ties between the two countries,\" the official, Public Relations Director Tshenolo Modise, insisted, though she acknowledged that the government found the gift improper because its memorandum of understanding with Libya was left incomplete at the time Botswana terminated bilateral relations. Despite the African Union deciding to disregard an International Criminal Court warrant for Gaddafi's arrest, the Foreign Ministry issued a statement on 6 July saying Botswana supports the warrant and intends to enforce it. Botswana recognized NTC on 11 August.\n* – On 24 August, the government announced that it recognised the National Transitional Council but was prepared to offer Gaddafi asylum if he requested it, even though Burkina Faso is a member of the International Criminal Court, which has issued a warrant for Gaddafi's arrest.\n* – The government recognised the National Transitional Council as \"the legitimate interlocutor\" of Libya on 26 June and reiterated its recognition on 26 August, calling for a peaceful democratic transition and respect for Libya's territorial integrity.\n* – President Idriss Déby Itno said he was \"100 percent sure\" that Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb looted Libyan military arsenals and stole surface-to-air missiles, saying, \"The Islamists of al Qaeda took advantage of the pillaging of arsenals in the rebel zone to acquire arms, including surface-to-air missiles, which were then smuggled into their sanctuaries in Tenere.\" Déby also said al Qaeda was actively fighting against Gaddafi in the rebellion, saying \"There is a partial truth in what [Gaddafi] says. Up to what point? I don't know. But I am certain that AQIM took an active part in the uprising.\" On 24 March, Inner City Press reported that Chad's ambassador to the United Nations told journalists that \"Gaddafi has no friends\". In a statement in early April, a government statement blamed Libyan rebels who have \"singled out\" Chadian nationals as \"mercenaries\", accusing them of unjustly killing Chadians in Libya. The statement also rejected the notion of Chadian mercenaries fighting in the Libyan civil war. On 24 August, Chad recognised the National Transitional Council.\n* – The government obtained help from Turkey in evacuating Comorian nationals from Libya during the uprising. Libya continues to maintain a military presence in the archipelago country ahead of a scheduled transfer of power.\n* – In a statement on 25 August, Foreign Minister Daniel Duncan said his government was \"very worried about the ongoing situation in Libya, caused by the massacre of the civilian population, the massive violations of human rights\" and had chosen to recognise the National Transitional Council as \"the sole legitimate representative of the Libyan people\". The Second Ivorian Civil War broke out in March 2011 when the crisis in Ivory Coast escalated into full-scale military conflict between forces. After months of unsuccessful negotiations and violence, the crisis entered a critical stage as Ouattara's forces seized control of most of the country, with Gbagbo entrenched in Abidjan, the country's largest city. International organizations have reported numerous instances of human rights violations. The UN and French forces took military action, with the stated objective to protect their forces and civilians.\n* – Media reported that president Teodoro Obiang Nguema called Gaddafi twice and attempted to rally African Union support for the embattled Libyan strongman, though Malabo later insisted the phone calls were \"misrepresented\" and said the president was acting only in his capacity as the current AU head.

On 22 March, Foreign Minister Alhaji Mohammed Mumuni said more than 16,000 Ghanaians had been evacuated thus far, exceeding initial estimates of the number of Ghanaians in Libya by 6,000. Mumuni said the government is still struggling to figure out how many Ghanaians remain in need of evacuation, but promised Accra \"remains committed to bringing the last Ghanaian in Libya home\".

However, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said that based on the Liberian experience with international military intervention, she did not believe the Libyan conflict could or should be resolved by foreign armed forces' action in the country. On 14 June, the government announced that it had severed diplomatic relations with the Gaddafi regime, withdrawing its ambassador and diplomatic staff from Tripoli and revoking the diplomatic status of the Libyan Embassy officials in Monrovia. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that \"the Government took the decision after a careful review of the situation in Libya and determined that the Government of Colonel Gaddafi has lost the legitimacy to govern Libya. The violence against the Libyan people must stop.\" Sirleaf later said that her government was considering recognizing the National Transitional Council.\n* – The government announced on 14 April that it had severed diplomatic relations with Libya, citing \"the prevailing hostilities and armed violence in Libya which have caused grave loss civilian life\".\n* – The government requested and received assistance from France in repatriating at least 166 Malians who fled from Libya to Egypt during the crisis.

The home the group occupied is an eight-bedroom mansion in Hampstead Garden Suburb, London, which had been listed by Saif as for sale for €12.75 million as the 2011 Libyan civil war began.\nAs of 10 March 2011, Scotland Yard had stated the issue was being treated as a \"civil matter\", and that no arrests had yet been made.\nMediation proposals\nThere were several peace mediation prospects during the crisis. The South African government also floated the idea of an African Union-led mediation effort to prevent \"civil war\".\nAnother initiative came from Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez. Though Gaddafi accepted in principle a proposal by Chávez to negotiate a settlement between the opposition and the Libyan government, Saif al-Islam, later voiced some skepticism to the proposal. On news of Gaddafi in principle accepting the Chávez's proposal for international mediation, there was a worldwide decrease in oil and gold prices. The proposal is also under consideration by the Arab League, according to chairman Amr Moussa. The Libyan opposition was cold to the proposal, saying that while they are willing to save lives, any deal would have to involve Gaddafi stepping down, while the US and French governments dismissed any initiative that would allow Gaddafi to remain in power.\nInternational aid\nOn 2 March, the Royal Navy destroyer HMS York had arrived in Benghazi carrying medical supplies and other humanitarian aid donated by the Swedish government. The medical supplies, a donation to the Benghazi Medical Centre, were supposed to have been flown direct to Benghazi airport but when the airport was closed down, they were diverted to Malta. They were transferred from the airport to the frigate at short notice by the Armed Forces of Malta. On 8 March, a convoy of trucks from the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) had entered Libya and was due to arrive in the eastern port city of Benghazi on the same day, the WFP said in a statement.  A convoy carrying seventy metric tonnes of high-energy date bars crossed the Egyptian border overnight on its way to the eastern port. On 7 March, U.N. aid coordinator Valerie Amos stated that fighting across Libya meant that more than a million people fleeing or inside the country needed humanitarian aid.\nFinancial markets\nRegional financial stock-market indices fell on 20 February on concern of spreading instability. Global stock markets fell the next day. On 22 February, crude oil and bonds climbed while Asian stocks fell on concern for stability in OPEC-member state Libya. US stock-market futures also dropped on the first working day following the aerial bombardments of protesters.\nOn 27 February, Saudi Arabia's Tadawul stock market index fell to a six-month low along with other regional Arab markets due to the clashes in Libya that caused a price increase in oil and amid fears that a recovery from the 2008 financial crisis would slow. The following day Asian stock also declined because of the unrest.\nMedia\nLibya's state television made no mention of the anti-government protests in the eastern provinces of the country, and continued with its usual programming until 17 February. During the morning news bulletin on 16 February, state TV repeatedly showed demonstrations in support of Colonel Gaddafi, which were about 200 to 300 strong and allegedly \"from across the country\". At one point a crowd could be heard chanting anti-Al Jazeera slogans. The Qatar-based outlet channel had started broadcasting footage from a pro-Gaddafi demonstration live from Sirte, Gaddafi's home town, that numbered 1,000. State TV also showed live coverage of a speech by Gaddafi from the previous evening, in which he denounced both the United States and their alleged \"Zionist\" allies in front of a cheering crowd on 16 February. It also began broadcasting images of burning buildings and cars in what viewers said was the first time government media had acknowledged the growing unrest in the east, which it suggested was spreading to the point that the government had no choice but to address it directly, possibly even with force of arms on the 20th. Gaddafi was shown with his supporters during a rally in Nalut on 19 February.\nLibya's privately owned and London-based electronic newspaper al-Yawm, which reports favourably on Gaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam, was the only Libyan source of any kind to freely report on the anti-Gaddafi protests in both the cities of Benghazi and Bayda. The paper usually carries balanced, un-opinionated reporting published a total of 16 articles on the anti-Gaddafi regime protests, quoting allegedly tapped \"trustworthy\" sources in Benghazi and Bayda, and carried no reports on the pro-Gaddafi demonstrations in Tripoli. Four protesters were killed in Bayda, the Al-Yawm paper said, as a crowd attempted to storm the Internal Security Building, set fire two cars and the burnt down headquarters of the local traffic police on 16 February.\nAccording to the state-owned Al-Shams and Al-Jamahiriya newspapers, mobile phone users were sent a text message warning them against taking to the streets on 17 February as a result of \"directives from the state security service\", which is the body that monitors and controls the country's two mobile telecommunications networks. The front page of Al-Jamahiriya was dedicated to pro-Gaddafi demonstrations and his timely public appearance at the Ahly football Club in Tripoli the day before, while state-owned Al-Shams led exclusively with coverage of this event. It later added that additional security forces had been bussed in to \"control\" the situation and that they had \"out-of-town\" accents \"and foreign agents\".\nQuryna, which had once been a part of Saif-al-Islam's Al-Ghad Media Corporation but was taken over by the state in 2010, carried an upbeat report about order being restored in Benghazi. One article reported on the families of \"17 February martyrs\" who met Gaddafi and condemned the protests.\nDomestically, BBC News reported on 18 February, that the \"leading pro-government newspaper\", Al-Zahf Al-Akhdar, has adopted a seemingly uncompromising stance towards the protests, stating:\nState TV broadcast images of Colonel Gaddafi paying a brief visit to Tripoli's Green Square, early on 18 February, during which supporters chanted pro-government slogans. BBC News stated that \"diplomats reported the use of heavy weapons in Benghazi,\" on 18 February. The government imposed a near-total news blackout, and foreign reporters are banned from the country, although at least one BBC reporter has ignored this and is broadcasting from opposition controlled Benghazi, as was Al Jazeera. The British newspaper, the Independent Online, reported on 20 February that at least one state-run newspaper, Al-Zahf Alakhdar, blamed the protests on Zionism.\nAdditional developments\nNo-fly zone\nPrime Minister David Cameron of the United Kingdom proposed the idea of a no-fly zone to prevent Gaddafi from airlifting mercenaries and using his military aeroplanes and armoured helicopters against civilians. Italy said it would support a no-fly zone if it was backed by the United Nations. U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates was cautious on this option, warning the US Congress that a no-fly zone would have to begin with an attack on Libya's air defenses. This proposal was rejected by Russia and China. On 7 March, US Ambassador to NATO Ivo Daalder announced that NATO decided to step up surveillance missions to 24 hours a day. On the same day it was reported that one UN diplomat confirmed to AFP on condition of anonymity that France and Britain were drawing up a resolution on the no-fly zone and it go before the United Nations Security Council as early as this week.\nOn 8 March, the GCC issued a joint statement, calling on the UN Security Council to impose a no-fly zone on Libya to protect civilians. On Saturday 12 March the foreign ministers of the Arab League agreed to ask the UN Security Council to impose a no-fly zone over Libya. The Group of Eight met in Paris on 14 March to discuss their potential support of a no-fly zone. On 17 March, the United Nations Security Council voted to impose a no-fly zone, and other measures, to protect the Libyan people.\nRelations with the rebels\nOn 4 March, one British diplomat, accompanied by a Secret Intelligence Service officer and six Special Forces troops were landed by helicopter close to Benghazi. However, they were quickly surrounded by the local militia who demanded to know who they were and what they were doing. They claimed that they were unarmed but their weapons were discovered and they were detained. Then Richard Northern, the British ambassador to Libya, was purportedly recorded having a conversation with one of the rebel leaders to try to solve the situation (this tape was played on Libyan state television). On 6 March, the British were released but their weapons were confiscated. The British left Libya by the frigate HMS Cumberland, which docked briefly in Benghazi before setting sail to Malta.\nOn 7 March, Robert Fisk of The Independent reported that the US government had asked Saudi Arabia if it could supply weapons to the rebels in Benghazi. The Saudis have been told that the opponents of Gaddafi need anti-tank rockets, mortars and surface-to-air missiles. However, on 8 March the US State Department denied the reports and that the United States would arm opposition groups without explicit international authorization.  It maintained that United Nations Security Council Resolution 1970, which imposed international sanctions on Libya including an arms embargo, applied to both the Gaddafi regime and the rebel groups.\nU.S. global security consultancy Stratfor reported that Egypt's special operations force Unit 777 and Tunisian volunteers were in Libya fighting for the rebels.\nOn 10 March, France became the first nation to recognize the National Transitional Council as the sole representative of Libya.\nGaddafi's death\nOn 20 October 2011, Muammar Gaddafi was killed while attempting to flee the Battle of Sirte at the end of the war. NATO forces involved in the military intervention in Libya were among the participants in the battle, and warplanes and at least one unmanned aerial vehicle operated by coalition partners struck Gaddafi's convoy, leaving him seriously injured and forcing him to abandon his retreat from the city. Opposition fighters located Gaddafi and took him into custody later that day, but he died from a gunshot wound to the head before reaching the hospital in Misrata.\nMany countries responded to Gaddafi's death by pronouncing it to mark the end of \"tyranny\" in Libya, with some world leaders even describing it as the end of the war. However, a few countries, such as Venezuela, Russia, met the news with anger, calling his death an \"outrage\".\nRetrospective assessments\nIn 2016, U.S. President Barack Obama stated that not preparing for a post-Gaddafi Libya was the \"worst mistake\" of his presidency.\nIn 2015 through 2016 the British parliament's Foreign Affairs Select Committee conducted an extensive and highly critical inquiry into the British involvement in the civil war. It concluded that the early threat to civilians had been overstated and that the significant Islamist element in the rebel forces had not been recognised, due to an intelligence failure. By summer 2011 the initial limited intervention to protect Libyan civilians had become a policy of regime change. However that new policy did not include proper support and for a new government, leading to a political and economic collapse in Libya and the growth of ISIL in North Africa. The former Prime Minister David Cameron was ultimately responsible for this British policy failure.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
