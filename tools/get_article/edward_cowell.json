He played first-class cricket for Cambridgeshire in 1867, making two appearances against Nottinghamshire and one appearance against Yorkshire. A right-arm roundarm fast bowler, he took 4 wickets with best figures of 3 for 11. As a batsman, he scored 37 runs with a highest score of 13. It was noted by Fred Lillywhite that Cowell was a strong fielder at mid-on. In the same year that he played for Cambridgeshire, he was engaged by Trinity College at their cricket ground in Cambridge and was later engaged by Warwickshire in 1874 at their County Ground in Warwick. Cowell died at Cambridge in November 1885.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
