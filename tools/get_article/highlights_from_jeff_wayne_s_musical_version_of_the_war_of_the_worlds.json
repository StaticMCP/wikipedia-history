G. Wells. It was released by Columbia Records.\nAbout the album\nIn order to cater to casual consumers who liked the music of ''Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds'' but did not want to sit through all the dialogue, Columbia Records issued a single-disc abridged version. It focused on the album's songs, but did not shy away from the longer musical passages. The album scrambles the original track list, reducing the plot's coherence.\nWhen the record was re-issued in October 2000, two bonus tracks were added: the 1989 Ben Liebrand remix of the single version of \"The Eve of the War\" and the 1996 remix of \"Forever Autumn\".\nThe record was re-issued on 4 June 2007  with a revised cover, new stereo mixes of the original nine tracks and the bonus track \"The Spirit Of Man (2007 Mix)\".\nTrack listing\nAll tracks written by Jeff Wayne except as noted.\nOriginal compilation\n#\"The Eve of the War\" – 5:13\n#\"Horsell Common and the Heat Ray\" – 4:45\n#\"Forever Autumn\" (Wayne, Vigrass, Osborne) – 4:31\n#\"The Fighting Machine\" – 4:25\n#\"Thunderchild\" (Wayne, Osborne) – 5:09\n#\"The Red Weed\" – 6:06\n#\"The Spirit of Man\" (Wayne, Osborne) – 6:44\n#\"Dead London\" – 5:25\n#\"Brave New World\" (Wayne, Osborne) – 5:23\n2000 re-issue bonus tracks\n* The Eve of the War (single version, 1989 remix)\n* Forever Autumn (1996 remix)\n2007 re-issue bonus track\n* The Spirit Of Man (2007 Mix)\nPeople involved\n* Jeff Wayne – keyboards\nAdditional musicians\n* Richard Burton – spoken words\n* David Essex – spoken words and vocals (\"Brave New World\")\n* Phil Lynott – spoken words and vocals (\"The Spirit of Man\")\n* Julie Covington – spoken words and vocals (\"The Spirit of Man\")\n* Justin Hayward – vocals (\"Forever Autumn\", \"The Eve of the War\")\n* Chris Thompson – vocals (\"Thunder Child\")\n* Ken Freeman – keyboards\n* Chris Spedding – guitar\n* Jo Partridge – guitar\n* George Fenton – santur, zither, tar\n* Herbie Flowers – bass guitar\n* Barry Morgan – drums\n* Barry da Souza, Roy Jones, Ray Cooper – percussion\n* Paul Vigrass, Gary Osborne, Billy Lawrie – backing vocals\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
