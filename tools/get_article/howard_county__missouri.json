As of the 2020 census, the population was 10,151. Its county seat is Fayette. Settled originally by migrants from the Upper South, it is part of the region historically known as Little Dixie. It is part of the Columbia, Missouri, metropolitan area.\nThe county was organized January 23, 1816, a year after the end of the War of 1812, and named for Benjamin Howard (1760-1814, served 1809-1813), two years after his death. He was an officer in the United States Army, and was appointed by President James Madison as the first Governor of the newly reorganized Missouri Territory (1812-1821), with its new capital city in nearby St. Louis. Governor Howard oversaw the new federal territory when it was separated from the previous larger Louisiana Territory of 1804-1812, which encompassed the vast uncharted Louisiana Purchase of 1803 when sold to the United States by the Emperor Napoleon I of France for $15 million dollars. The subsequent Missouri Territory was formed nine years later after the previous short-lived Louisiana Territory's southern portion along the lower Mississippi River including the former territorial capital at the major prosperous river port city of New Orleans was approved by the United States Congress and President Madison to be admitted to the federal Union as the 18th State of Louisiana in 1812.\nThis was just prior to the outbreak of the War of 1812, which heralded renewed conflict with the United Kingdom. Territorial Governor Howard was involved and instrumental in the hostilities, although he died in the midst of the war's last year, and before the British Army and Royal Navy attack in the Battle of New Orleans in January 1815, the famous last battle of the war a month after a peace treaty was signed in December 1814, in Europe.\nHistory\nLocated on the north bank of the Missouri River, Howard County was settled primarily from the Upper Southern states of Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia. The migrants brought slaves and slaveholding traditions with them, and cultivated hemp and tobacco, crops of Middle Tennessee. Howard was one of several counties settled mainly by Southerners along the Missouri River in the center of the state. Because of this, this area became known as Little Dixie, and Howard County was at its heart. Following the 1848 revolutions in the German nations, many German immigrants also came to this region, developing farms.\nDue to the reliance on slave labor, by 1860 African-American slaves composed at least 25 percent of the county's population. Given their backgrounds and cultural affiliations, many Howard County residents supported the Confederacy during the Civil War. Ethnic German immigrants and descendants tended to support the Union.\nAfter the end of Reconstruction, whites enforced Jim Crow laws and racial segregation in the county to maintain white supremacy. In the most violent period, at the turn of the 20th century, five African Americans were lynched in Howard County from 1891 to 1914: Olli Truxton, Frank Embree, Thomas Hayden, Arthur McNeal, and Dallas Shields. Howard County tied with Pike County for the highest rate of lynchings in the state.\nThe county continued to be developed for agriculture and is still largely rural. However, Howard County has lost population since its peak in 1880. The mechanization of farming reduced the demand for labor, and many workers left for jobs in the cities and less oppressive societies. By 2000 African Americans in the county had declined to less than seven percent of the total. In the early 21st century, nearly one-third of the residents identify as being of German ancestry, reflecting the wave of mid-19th century immigration.\nGeography\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which  is land and  (1.6%) is water.\nAdjacent counties\n*Chariton County (northwest)\n*Randolph County (northeast)\n*Boone County (southeast)\n*Cooper County (south)\n*Saline County (west)\nMajor highways\n*20px U.S. Route 40\n* Route 3\n* Route 5\n* Route 87\n* Route 124\n* Route 240\n* Route 240 Alternate\n* Route 240 Business\n* Route 240 Spur\nNational protected area\n*Big Muddy National Fish and Wildlife Refuge (part)\nDemographics\n1790-1960 1900-19901990-2000 2010-2015\n}}\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 10,212 people, 3,836 households, and 2,631 families residing in the county.
