Built by Jesse Edwards, the \"Father of Newberg\" and one of the founders of George Fox University, it is the second-oldest residence in the city, after the Hoover-Minthorn House. The house was built about  from its current location; it was moved in 1905 to allow for street widening.\nWhen Jesse Edwards died, his family purchased the home.  In 1998, they sold it to George Fox University to house university presidents, for which it was restored.\nReferences\n* [http://www.georgefox.edu/about/history/historical_buildings.html Historical buildings at georgefox.edu]"
