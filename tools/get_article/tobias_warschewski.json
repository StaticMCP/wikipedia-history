Liga appearances.\nOn 21 July 2020, Warschewski signed with Regionalliga Nord side Phönix Lübeck. On 23 September 2020, he made his debut as a 73rd-minute substitute and scored his first goal for the club in a 3–0 win over Heider SV. He went on to make another four appearances for Phönix that season, for a total of one goal in five appearances.\nCanada\nOn 19 February 2021, Warschewski signed a one-year contract with Canadian Premier League side FC Edmonton. He scored his first goal for Edmonton on 31 July against Valour FC, netting the second goal in a 3–1 victory. Warschewski was one of the few bright spots in a disappointing season for FC Edmonton, as he finished the season with the most assists in the league, with 7, even as Edmonton finished in seventh place. On 9 February 2022, the club announced that Warschewski and all but two other players would not be returning for the 2022 season.\nIn February 2022, Warschewski signed a one-year deal with an optional extension with York United, and was then immediately loaned back to FC Edmonton. 2022 was expected to be a difficult season for Edmonton, with financial issues drastically affecting the club. In their first match of the 2022 season, he scored a bicycle kick in the final seconds to ensure a 1–1 draw against Valour FC. In December 2022, York announced Warschewski would be departing the club.\nOn January 16, 2024, he joined fellow Canadian Premier League club Cavalry FC on a free transfer, signing a one-year contract with an option for two more seasons. At the end of the 2024 season, Warschewski scored five goals in Cavalry's final goal games to win the CPL Golden Boot. On 10 November, he scored a goal and was awarded the CPL Final MVP award in a 2–1 victory over Forge FC in the 2024 CPL final, helping the club win their first league title. In April 2025, Warschewski signed a two year contract extension with Cavalry, with a club option for the 2027 season.\nInternational career\nIn March 2017, Warschewski played for Germany's U-19 team in UEFA European Under-19 Championship qualifying, making his debut as a substitute against Cyprus. He was subsequently called up for the final tournament that July, where he made a substitute appearance against the Netherlands and then appeared as a substitute again against England, scoring a consolation goal in a 4–1 loss.\nCareer statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" Style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Continental\n!colspan=\"2\"|Playoffs\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Preußen Münster\n|2016–17\n|3.
