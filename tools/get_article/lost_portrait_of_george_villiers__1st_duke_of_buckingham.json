It was painted around 1625 by Flemish artist Peter Paul Rubens.\nIn 2017, the oil painting was examined by art historian Bendor Grosvenor at Pollok House, the former ancestral home of the Stirling-Maxwell family at Pollok Country Park in Glasgow, Scotland. Prior to this examination, the portrait was thought to be a mere copy of a Rubens painting that had been lost.\nOnce layers of old varnish and overpainting were removed over a period of two months by art conservator Simon Rollo Gillespie, the portrait was revealed to be the original work by Rubens himself. Ben van Beneden, the director of Antwerp's Rubenshuis, confirmed the authenticity of the attribution.\nThe portrait's examination, background research and restoration process were documented by the BBC Four television series ''Britain's Lost Masterpieces'' (series 2, episode 1), which aired in September 2017.\nReferences"
