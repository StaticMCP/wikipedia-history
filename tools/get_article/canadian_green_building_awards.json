The space flows freely between outside and inside, then through the building in a consistent and understated way. The high level of environmental performance is also achieved without overt expression of sustainable systems. A rare example of an institutional building that is also welcoming to the public and exciting to explore.\"\n|Client: George Brown College\nArchitects: Stantec Architecture and Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg Architects, Architects in Joint Venture\nEngineers [structural, mechanical, electrical, civil and sustainability, energy]: Stantec Consulting Inc.\nCost consultant: Hanscomb\nBuilding Code: Leber | Rubes\nLandscape: Phillips Farevaag Smallenberg Landscape Architects\nGeostructural Engineer: Sherwood Geostructural Engineers\nMarine Engineer: SHAL Consulting Engineers\nGeotechnical and Environmental Engineer: Trow Associates\nProject Manager: Terry Comeau, Nerys Rau\nConstruction Manager: EllisDon\nPhotos: Tom Arban Photography and Richard Johnson\n|-\n|Beechwood Deep Energy Retrofit\n|Toronto, ON\n|\"A highly transferable example of how to intensify existing communities, adding to their capacity and improving their energy performance. The ambition to take this rather unremarkable existing house to an exceptionally high level of energy performance  is to be applauded, as is the suite of innovative but highly transferable strategies that were used. It is also noteworthy that the project team decided to build upward rather than outward, and to restore previously paved areas of the site to natural landscape.\"\n|General Contractor: Greening Homes Ltd.\nArchitect: Open Architects\nMechanical Engineer: Sustainable EDGE\n|}\n2016 Winners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"width: 100pt;\" | Name of Project\n| style=\"width: 75pt;\" | Location\n| style=\"width: 150pt;\" | Jury Comments\n| style=\"width: 350pt;\" | Project Credits\n|-\n|Dura House\n|Terence Bay, NS\n|\"An exemplary project that responds to the opportunities of its site, while respecting the rigours of the North Atlantic coastal climate. A compact plan, strategically placed thermal mass, airtightness 50% better than Passive House standard and a highly insulated building envelope make this a truly low energy house. Add to this the live/work configuration that will reduce transportation energy and the result is a compelling prototype which combines energy conservation, clever programming and contextual sensitivity.\"\n|Owner/Developer: David Coole\nArchitect: DR Coole Architecture Inc.\nGeneral Contractor: David Coole\nStructural Engineer: Griggs Engineering\nMechanical Engineer: Equilibrium Engineering\nPhotos: Elemental Photography\n|-\n|Fort St. John Passive House\n|Fort St. John, BC\n|\"A highly commendable effort by a small and remote municipality to create a prototype residential building to the highest energy performance standards. One of the few single-family houses to be certified to Passive House standards anywhere in Canada, the educational opportunity this project represents is profound - and all the more remarkable because it is located in an area where the economy is dominated by the oil and gas industry.\"\n|Architect: Marken Projects\nOwner/Developer: City of Fort St. John\nGeneral Contractor: City of Fort St. John\nLandscape Architect: City of Fort St. John\nMechanical Engineer: Renu Building Science\nStructural Engineer: Equilibrium Consulting Inc. [Structure], Jim Jarvis Engineering [Foundation]\nCommissioning Agent: D. Bauer Mechanical\nPhotos: Velvet Leaf Photography\n|-\n|Grange Triple Double\n|Toronto, ON\n|\"A flexible, multi-unit, multi-generational home that provides proof of concept for a new approach to urban intensification. The strategic approach to site planning, building massing, and programmatic flexibility simultaneously addresses the quantitative requirement for increased density, and the qualitative requirement to maintain the physical, social and cultural continuity of the neighbourhood. Passive and Active Design strategies combine to achieve a high standard of building performance.\"\n|Owner/Developer: Name withheld\nArchitect: Williamson Chong\nStructural Engineer: Blackwell\nConstruction Manager: Derek Nicholson Inc.\nMillwork: BL Woodworking\nWindows: Torp Inc.\nDrawings and Diagrams: Williamson Chong\nPhotos: Bob Gundu\n|-\n|Our House\n|Toronto, ON\n|\"A simple, strategic and highly reproducible series of interventions have completely transformed this modest residence into an appealing family home. Working within the constraints of a 450ft2 footprint, this project is notable for its compelling, well-proportioned spaces conjured out of an existing structure that was virtually unliveable. With close attention paid to airtightness, insulation levels and high-performance triple-glazed windows and skylights, energy performance has been improved by 90%.\"\n|Architect: Solares Architecture Inc.\nGeneral Contractor: Tomislav Knezic\nInterior Finishing Contractor: Paul Drummond\nLandscape Architect: R Environs Inc.\nMechanical Engineer: SGA Associates Inc.\nStructural Engineer: Katakkar Engineering associates\nCommissioning Agent: Blue Green Consulting Group\nPhotos: Derek Monson\n|-\n|Jasper Place Library\n|Edmonton, AB\n|\"The bold sculptural form makes this library an enchanting focal point in an otherwise visually unremarkable suburban community. The transparent facade and overhanging roof are part of a passive design strategy, while at the same time blurring the distinction between the interior and exterior of the building. The clear span concrete roof facilitates future reconfiguration of the program, while its undulating form serves to articulate interior spaces of differing character. Overall an engaging project that makes a vital contribution to the quality of community life.\"\n|Owner/Developer: Edmonton Public Library\nArchitect: HCMA Architecture + Design in joint venture with DUB Architects\nStructural Engineer: Fast + Epp\nMechanical Engineer: Williams Engineering Canada Inc.\nElectrical Engineer: Williams Engineering Canada Inc.\nCivil Engineer: ISL Engineering and Land Services Inc.\nLandscape Architect: Carlisle + Associates [now DIALOG]\nGeneral Contractor: Stuart Olson Dominion Construction\nCommissioning Agent: Hemisphere Engineering\nPhotos: Hubert Kang Photography\n|-\n|Groupe Dynamite Atrium\n|Montreal, QC\n|\"Injecting life into a dead space between two large floor plate industrial buildings, this project achieves the greatest possible benefit to the company's employees with the minimum possible intervention. Despite the lack of an overt energy strategy, the atrium  addresses issues of community, light and air, wellness, material efficiency and building life cycle - all of which are key aspects of sustainability.\"\n|Architect: Aedifica\nOwner/Developer: Ciro M. Falluh\nGeneral Contractor: Reliance Construction Group\nMechanical Engineer: Aedifica Consultants\nElectrical Engineer: Aedifica Consultants\nStructural Engineer: SBSA Experts-Conseils\nPhotos: Francois Descôteaux\n|-\n|Budzey Building\n|Vancouver, BC\n|\"This public sector project is a model for energy-efficient high-rise residential design. The 30% window-to-wall ratio, the high-performance envelope with thermal breaks, radiant in-slab heating and heat recovery ventilation in each suite are strategies all private sector developers should try to emulate. This project is characterized by a remarkable quality and generosity of the interior spaces, making it an example of architecture that could truly transform the lives of its embattled residents.\"\n|Architect: NSDA Architects\nOwner/Developer: Budzey Building\nFunding Authority: BC Housing\nHousing Consultant: Terra Housing Consultants Ltd.\nStructural Engineer: Fast + Epp Structural Engineers\nLandscape Architect: Perry + Associates\nElectrical Engineer: MMM Group\nMechanical Engineer: MMM Group\nGeotechnical Consultant: Horizon Engineering\nBuilding Code: LMDG Building Code Consultants\nCommissioning Agent: Inland Technical Services Ltd.\nSustainability: Recollective\nBuilding Envelope: exp. Services Inc.\nGeneral Contractor: Stuart Olson Construction Ltd.\nPhotos: Derek Lepper Photography\n|-\n|Bill Fisch Forest Stewardship and Education Centre\n|Whitchurch-Stouffville, ON\n|\"The first Living Building Challenge contender in Ontario, this benchmark project goes beyond net zero energy by meticulously pursuing a range of familiar conservation strategies including: a high-performance envelope with R-40 walls and R-60 roof; a window-to-wall ratio of less than 30%; and triple-glazed windows oriented for optimal solar orientation. A 35kW photovoltaic array contributes to the net positive energy result. Other notable achievements include net zero water, with rain and well water meeting 100% of occupant needs.\"\n|Owner/Developer: The Regional Municipality of York\nArchitect: DIALOG Ontario Inc.
