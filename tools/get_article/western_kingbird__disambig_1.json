Characteristic of kingbird species, the western kingbird is very territorial. Although the western is often misidentified as Cassin's kingbird, Couch's kingbird, or the tropical kingbird due to the yellow coloration, it can be distinguished from these other species through its black, squared tail with white edges.\nAnatomy and morphology\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 87%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Standard Measurements\n|-\n| style=\"padding-right: 1em;padding-left:0.35em;\" | length || style=\"padding-right: 0.5em;padding-left:0.5em;\" |\n|-\n| style=\"padding-right: 1em;padding-left:0.35em;\" | weight || style=\"padding-right: 0.5em;padding-left:0.5em;\" |\n|-\n| style=\"padding-right: 1em;padding-left:0.35em;\" | wingspan || style=\"padding-right: 0.5em;padding-left:0.5em;\" |\n|-\n| style=\"padding-right: 1em;padding-left:0.35em;\" | wing || style=\"padding-right: 0.5em;padding-left:0.5em;\" |\n|-\n| style=\"padding-right: 1em;padding-left:0.35em;\" | tail || style=\"padding-right: 0.5em;padding-left:0.5em;\" |\n|-\n| style=\"padding-right: 1em;padding-left:0.35em;\" | culmen || style=\"padding-right: 0.5em;padding-left:0.5em;\" |\n|-\n| style=\"padding-right: 1em;padding-left:0.35em;\" | tarsus || style=\"padding-right: 0.5em;padding-left:0.5em;\" |\n|}\nDistribution and habitat\n]]\nThe breeding habitat is open areas in western North America. The increased presence of trees throughout the Great Plains during the past century due to fire suppression and tree planting facilitated the range expansion of the western kingbird, as well as range expansions of many other species of birds.\nBehavior\nThe name kingbird is derived from their \"take-charge\" behavior. These birds aggressively defend their territory, even against much larger birds such as hawks. They will attack humans, livestock, and pets when they think their young are in danger. Kingbirds make a sturdy cup nest in a tree or shrub, sometimes on top of a pole or other man-made structure. Three to five white, creamy, or pinkish eggs with heavy blotches of brown, black, or lavender are laid and incubated for 12 to 14 days. Due to the small size of the nest, and the chicks' rapid rate of growth, most of them are pushed out of the nest, due to overcrowding, before they are fully feathered and able to fly.\nThey wait on an open perch and fly out to catch insects such as bees, robber flies, winged ants, grasshoppers, and spiders. They are also known to eat berries, buckthorn/sumac, and poison ivy seeds.\nThese birds migrate in flocks to Florida and the Pacific coast of southern Mexico and Central America.\nSound\nThe song is a squeaky chatter, sometimes compared to a squeaky toy. The call is a sharp loud whit. It occasionally sings before sunrise.\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n* [https://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Western_Kingbird.html Western kingbird Species account] - Cornell Lab of Ornithology\n* [https://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/id/framlst/i4470id.html Western kingbird - Tyrannus verticalis] - USGS Patuxent Bird Identification InfoCenter\n* [http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_13452818 Western kingbird attacking red tailed hawk with photo] - [http://www.denverpost.com Denver Post], 30 September 2009\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* [https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Western_Kingbird/lifehistory Western kingbird Life History] - All About Birds"
