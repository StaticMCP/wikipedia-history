The program operated from 1984 to 1991, and was replaced by the NSF Young Investigator (NYI) Awards and Presidential Faculty Fellows (PFF) program. In 1995, the NSF Young Investigator program was subsumed into the NSF CAREER Awards program, and in 1996, the Presidential Faculty Fellows program was replaced by the PECASE program.\nApplicants could not directly apply for the award, but were nominated by others including their own institutions based on their previous record of scientific achievement. The award, a certificate from the White House signed by the President of the United States, included a minimum grant of $25,000 a year for five years from NSF to be used for any scientific research project the awardee wished to pursue, with the possibility of additional funding up to $100,000 annually if the PYI obtained matching funds from industry.  Considered to be one of the highest honors granted by the National Science Foundation, the award program was criticized in 1990 as not being the best use of NSF funds in an era of tight budgets.\nFrances Arnold, winner of this award in 1989, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2018.\nRecipients\nPYI award recipients include:\n* Ahsan Kareem, Structural Engineering, 1984\n* Narendra Ahuja, computer science, 1984\n* Alice Agogino, engineering, 1985\n* Paul Alivisatos, chemistry, 1991\n* Peter B.
