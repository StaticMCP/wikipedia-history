It is a -story brick structure in a combination of the Colonial Revival and Classical Revival styles.  Built in 1897 to house the Corning City Club, it became home to the library and memorial to Corning natives who lost their lives in World War I following a fire in 1926. The original architects were Pierce & Bickford of Elmira, with the later remodeling by Palmer Rogers of New York City.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.stls.org/corning/images2/08.10.23%20WWMemLib.exterior.htm World War Memorial Library website]"
