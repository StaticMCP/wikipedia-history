Operated by Barnsley Museums, it has independent shops, studios, galleries and cafes in former Victorian engineering workshops. It also has a large antiques centre. A visitor centre and regular tours share the unique history of the village, an industrial estate village of ironworks and collieries, built for the Earls Fitzwilliam of Wentworth Woodhouse. Elsecar is now recognised to be of international significance, one of the UK's first model villages and a precursor to places like Saltaire.\nClose to the heritage centre, at the Elsecar New Colliery, is a Newcomen steam engine, the only such engine still in its original location and now understood to be the world's oldest steam engine still in situ.\nHeritage Centre\nThe New Yard\nThe New Yard workshops were built for Earl Fitzwilliam in 1850, as a base for carpenters, engineers, joiners, blacksmiths and others who supported the village's collieries, ironworks and the Wentworth Woodhouse estate. The workshops later became part of the National Coal Board until closure in the 1980s.\nThe New Yard is now home to almost 40 independent shops, galleries, cafes, a children's play space and large antiques centre.\nA visitor centre has exhibits, films, interactive displays for children and an in-depth digital reconstruction of what the village and its valley looked like in the year 1880.\nThe Elsecar Ironworks\nThe rolling mill of the former Elsecar Ironworks now hosts large events, including antiques fairs, maker markets, concerts and weddings.\nThe Earl's Great Engine\nThe Elsecar New Colliery is the site of the only Newcomen beam engine in the world still in its original location, built in 1795 at the instruction of William Wentworth, the 4th Earl Fitzwilliam.\nIt is now recognised to be the world's oldest steam engine still in place anywhere.\nIt pumped water out of Elsecar New Colliery and ran from 1795 until 1923 when it was replaced by electric pumps. In 1973 the engine was classified as a scheduled ancient monument.\nThe engine was restored to working order (worked by hydraulics) over the period 2012&ndash;14.\nVisitors can visit it 7 days a week (except in extreme weather) and on special open days and weekly tours between Easter and October each year.\nSee also\n*Listed buildings in Hoyland Milton\n*Elsecar Heritage Railway\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101215183321/http://www.elsecar-heritage-centre.co.uk/history/newcomen-beam-engine/ The Newcomen engine]\n* [https://www.elsecar-heritage.com/ Elsecar Heritage Centre] - Barnsley Council official site\n*"
