In response, Henry arranged a meeting with Boniface of Montferrat, who was King of Thessalonica, for a joint campaign against Kaloyan at Kypsella, Thrace, which Boniface agreed. On Boniface's return to Thessaloniki, he was ambushed near Mosynopolis by Bulgarian forces and was killed. Seizing the opportunity created by Boniface's death, Kaloyan besieged Thessalonica, but his sudden death abruptly ended the siege and created a power vacuum in Bulgaria that allowed Henry to consolidate the Latin Empire's territories.\nBackground\nThe Fourth Crusade resulted in the partition of Byzantine Empire's territories among the crusaders. Two of the crusaders, Boniface of Montferrat became King of Thessalonica in 1204 and Henry of Flanders became the Latin emperor of Constantinople a year later. Both men started to consolidate their power and expand their territories. Their authority was immediately challenged by Byzantine rump states (Nicaea and Trebizond). Meanwhile, in the north, Kaloyan gathered an army and within a short period of time (1204–1207) controlled parts of Macedonia and frequently raided Thrace, regions claimed by the newly established Latin kingdoms.\nBetween 1206 and 1207, the leader of Niceans, Laskaris, and Kalojan concluded an alliance to attack the Latin territories at the same time. Kalojan advanced into Thrace in early 1207 and besieged Adrianople. The Nicaeans attacked Latin-held fortresses in northwestern Anatolia. Henry, who lacked the resources and manpower to face two fronts, made peace by ceding territory to Laskaris. Kalojan was unable to take the city, because his Cuman allies withdrew. In the meantime, Boniface regained control of Serres, which was captured in 1205 by Kaloyan, and restored its fortifications.\nAmbush\nAfter making peace in the summer, Henry returned to Adrianople and he initiated negotiations with Boniface for a joint campaign against Kaloyan at Kypsella. At the meeting, Boniface agreed to become Henry's vassal, but it was never realized, because  Boniface upon his return was killed on September 4 at Mosynopolis.\nDifferent sources provide conflicting accounts of the events of Boniface's death. According to Geoffroy de Villehardouin, local Bulgarians ambushed him by taking advantage of the fact that Boniface was accompanied by a small number of soldiers. After killing him, they sent his head to Kaloyan. Niketas Choniates, the Chronicle of Morea, and Robert de Clari claim that Kaloyan orchestrated the ambush. Having recently dispatched an army of Vlachs and Cumans toward Mosynopolis, he learned that Boniface was in the vicinity and ordered 200 mounted mounted archers (likely Cumans) to attack. Boniface was killed by an arrow, as were the soldiers accompanying him. Alexandru Madgearu argues that these accounts appear closer to the actual events than Villehardouin's version, and notes that none of them mention what became of Boniface's body.\nAftermath\nThe ancient foundations of Mosynopolis were destroyed by Kaloyan's forces, the remaining inhabitants of the city moved within the preserved fortress forming new foundations of a later city.\nIn October 1207, Kaloyan organized a campaign against Thessalonica, the capital of Boniface's kingdom, taking advantage the political confusion arising from Boniface' death. The regent of the city was Boniface's wife, Margaret, acting for her underage son, Demetrios, raising leadership questions by the local nobles.\nIn the early stages of the siege, Kaloyan died, abruptly ending the siege. Over time, his mysterious death gave rise to a legend claiming that St. Demetrius, the patron saint of Thessaloniki, struck down Kaloyan in his tent on October 26, the same day dedicated to the saint's celebration. Contemporary historian, George Akropolites, wrote that Kaloyan died of pleurisy. Scholars argue that his death was caused by his Cuman allies over internal rivalries or resentment over his harshness.\nKaloyan's death also created a power vacuum in the kingdom effectively halting Bulgaria's rapid expansion. Emperor Henry took advantage of the disarray in Bulgaria's leadership and was able to recover the Latin Empire's territories taken by Kaloyan.\nSee also\n*\nNotes\n}}\nReferences\nSources\n*  }}\n*\n*\n*  }}"
