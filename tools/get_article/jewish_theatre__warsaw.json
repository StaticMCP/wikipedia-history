It was named after the Polish-Jewish actress Ester Rachel Kamińska, who was called the \"mother of Yiddish theatre,\" and her daughter, the Academy Award-nominated actress Ida Kamińska.[http://edit.diapozytyw.pl/en/site/ludzie/ester_rachel_kaminska Dia-Pozytyw: People, Biographical Profiles]  Ida Kamińska directed the theatre and acted in its productions from the time of its founding until 1968.\nThe State Jewish Theatre was formed in 1950 from two theatre troupes which performed in Wrocław and Łódź in 1945–50. The theatre worked in both cities over the next few years and gave guest performances across Poland. In 1955 it moved to Warsaw permanently. Since 1970 it has performed in its own building on Grzybowski Square.\nSince its inception, the theatre has sought to continue the rich traditions of prewar Jewish theatrical stages in Poland. Plays at the theatre are shown in Polish and Yiddish (headphones with Polish translation are available).\nThe theatre cultivates the creativity of great Jewish drama. Its repertoire features the best works by Abraham Goldfaden, Mendele-Moykher Sforim, Sholom Aleichem, Isaac Leib Peretz and Jacob Gordin.\nIn 1970–2014, the president of the theatre was the actor Szymon Szurmiej.\nActors\n* Rywa Buzgan, Noemi Jungbach, Ida Kamińska, Ruth Kamińska, Estera Kowalska, Alicja Miłoszewska, Ruth Kowalska, Halina Lercher, Danuta Morel, Czesława Rajfer, Zofia Rajfer, Stefania Staszewska, Lena Szurmiej, Etel Szyc, Gołda Tencer.\n* Juliusz Berger, Mieczysław Bram, Chewel Buzgan, Seweryn Dalecki, Izaak Dogim, Piotr Erlich, Leon Garbarski, Karol Latowicz, Herman Lercher, Marian Melman, Abraham Morewski, Henryk Rajfer, Jack Recknitz, Józef Retik, Samuel Rettig, Abraham Rozenbaum, Jan Szurmiej, Dawid Obłożyński, Szymon Szurmiej, Michał Szwejlich, Zygmunt Turkow.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.teatr-zydowski.art.pl/ Official website of the Jewish State Theatre in Warsaw (in Polish)]\n* [https://culture.pl/en/article/jewish-theatre-in-poland-fragments-illustrious-history Jewish Theatre in Poland: Fragments of an Illustrious History]"
