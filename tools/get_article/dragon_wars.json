Alternatively, the player may import characters from ''The Bard's Tale trilogy into Dragon Wars. During the game, the seven character slots can be filled with any combination of the starting characters, recruited characters, and summoned creatures.\nPlot\nThe story from the back of the original box states:\nDevelopment\nDuring the initial design process for Bard's Tale III: Thief of Fate, one of the designers came up with a list of enhancements and improvements for the game. With the possibility that Interplay would soon be parting ways with Electronic Arts, it was decided to save these for a future game and stick closer to the original engine, though the auto-mapping feature did make it into Bard's Tale III.\nThese design improvements came in this next game, Dragon Wars. In essence, the game was a fusion of Bard's Tale and design philosophy pioneered in Wasteland.\nUntil a month before release, the game was developed as Bard's Tale IV'', but the rights to the title were still held by Electronic Arts; thus, a new title and setting were needed for the game. It was derived in part from the Sumerian legends of Gilgamesh, with the chief villain of the game being named Namtar. Since to this point the game didn't feature any dragons, the new title meant that Heineman had to add one.\nInterplay advertisements displayed the slogan \"Bard's Tale Fans Rejoice!\" above the game's name, and mentioned Dragon Wars ability to import ''Bard's Tale characters. The designers all felt it was a better game than Bard's Tale III, and indeed, better than any of the Bard's Tale series, but without the tie-in to the old title and without Electronic Arts' marketing muscle, the game did not fare as well.\nTo defend against pirated copies of the game, Dragon Wars included a collection of numbered paragraphs within their manual. Players would receive an in-game message (i.e. \"Read paragraph 23\"), and have to refer back to the printed material. The game is very difficult to play without references to the paragraphs, and many parts become meaningless. This form of security was widely used at the time.\nA sequel, Dragon Wars 2'', was in the concept stage of development around the mid-1990s but was cancelled because of the original's tepid sales figures and RPGs being out of style at the time.\nReception\nDragon Wars was reviewed in 1989 in Dragon #152 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \"The Role of Computers\" column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars. Scorpia gave the game a positive review in Computer Gaming World in 1989, noting improvements over the ''Bard's Tale series, saying that \"tighter design, attention to detail, balanced combat, and a carefully constructed plotline all combine to produce a CRPG well worth playing\". In 1993 she wrote that the game was \"a good choice when you want something a bit more than a standard slicer/dicer\".\nAccording to Heineman, the game sold well but two things were against it: the game being a blobber RPG and not being able to use The Bard's Tale name. The game eventually broke even.\nThe game was later included in the Interplay's 10 Year Anthology Classic Collection released in 1993.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n* [http://www.classicgaming.cc/pc/dragon-wars Dragon Wars''] at Classicgaming.cc\n* [http://www.gamefaqs.com/computer/doswin/data/564812.html Game information (MS-DOS version)]\n* [http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/nes/data/570582.html Game information (Nintendo Family Computer version)]"
