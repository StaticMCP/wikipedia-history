Besides ripped games, the group also released trainers and cracked updates for games. Myth's slogan, \"Myth, always ahead of the Class\", was referring to the rival group Class that existed from 1997 to 2004.\nHistory\nMyth was formed in February 2000, in a merger between Origin and Paradigm.\nOn June 29, 2005, the group was targeted alongside several other groups in \"Operation Site Down\" conducted by the FBI. Myth made no further releases following this raid, and in October 2005 they released an NFO declaring that the group would enter hibernation.\nMax Payne 2 controversy\nA cracked version of Max Payne 2 using a no-CD executable by Myth was made available on the digital distribution service Steam until May 13, 2010, where it was rolled back to an older update. However, the ASCII Myth logo is still present in the file called testapp.exe.\nSee also\n* List of warez groups\n* Standard (warez)\n* Warez scene\nReferences"
