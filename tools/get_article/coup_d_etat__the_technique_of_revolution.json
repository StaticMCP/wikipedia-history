It devotes chapters to the Bolshevik Revolution with a focus on Leon Trotsky's and Vladimir Lenin's roles, the 1920 Battle of Warsaw, the Kapp Putsch in Germany, Napoleon Bonaparte as the inventor of the modern coup d'état, Miguel Primo de Rivera's rise to power in Spain, Benito Mussolini and the March on Rome, and the possibility that Adolf Hitler will come to power in Germany.\nPublication\nThe book was written in Paris after Malaparte had fallen out with the Italian Fascist Party, with which he had a turbulent relationship. It was first published in French in 1931 and in English translation by Sylvia Saunders in 1932. The book created controversy and Malaparte was accused of cynicism and hypocrisy. Because of its negative assessment of Hitler, Malaparte was persecuted and imprisoned in Italy for spreading \"antifascist propaganda abroad\".\nReferences"
