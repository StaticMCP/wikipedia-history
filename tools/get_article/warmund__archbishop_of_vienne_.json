As a monk of the abbey of Romans, he was elected to succeed Abbot  before the latter's death in 1070. He was later elected to succeed Léger as archbishop. He held the abbacy and archbishopric concurrently until his death. He is accused of dissipating the diocese's property. Upon his death, Bishop  administered the diocese as vicar. His successor, Guy of Burgundy, was only elected in 1088.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*"
