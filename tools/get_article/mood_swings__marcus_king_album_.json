Production was handled by Rick Rubin.\nCritical reception\n| rev1 = AllMusic\n| rev1score =\n| rev2 = Rolling Stone\n| rev2score =\n}}\nMood Swings was met with universal acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 80 based on five reviews.\nJon Dolan of Rolling Stone praised the album, stating: \"the album is full of moments like this, where the lyrical conventions of a hand-me-down genre are enlivened with genuinely personal urgency\". AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote: \"if the individual songs don't quite differentiate themselves, that's not precisely a detriment, as King is on an explicit interior journey, ensuring that his music mimics his moods. He doesn't avoid darkness, but he chooses not to wallow, finding instead a measure of peace in the emotional expression itself\".\nTrack listing\n| length5       = 3:16\n| title6        = Delilah\n| writer6       =\n| length6       = 4:23\n| title7        = Inglewood Motel\n| writer7       =\n| length7       = 5:20\n| title8        = This Far Gone\n| writer8       =\n| length8       = 3:03\n| title9        = Bipolar Love\n| writer9       = King\n| length9       = 6:09\n| title10       = Me or Tennessee\n| writer10      = King\n| length10      = 4:22\n| title11       = Cadillac\n| writer11      = King\n| length11      = 3:07\n| total_length  = 45:46\n}}\nPersonnel\n*Marcus King – vocals (tracks: 1–10), electric guitar (tracks: 1, 4, 5, 7), bass (tracks: 1, 2, 8, 11), guitar (tracks: 2, 5, 6, 8, 9), electric piano (track 2), bass keyboards (track 3), piano (tracks: 6, 11), bass guitar (track 6), keyboards (track 8), acoustic guitar (track 11)\n*Kristen Rogers – background vocals (tracks: 1, 5, 9)\n*Ashly Williams – background vocals (tracks: 2, 4, 7, 10)\n*Herman Bryant III – background vocals (tracks: 2, 4, 7, 10)\n*Porcha Clay – background vocals (tracks: 2, 4, 7, 10)\n*Briley King – background vocals (tracks: 6, 11)\n*Jason Lader – bass, drum machine & additional programming (track 1), Moog synth (track 3), synth (track 11), recording\n*Daphne Chen – violin & viola (track 2), strings arrangement (tracks: 2, 9), strings (track 9)\n*Ro Rowan – cello (track 2)\n*Benny Brock – upright piano (track 3), mellotron (tracks: 3, 9)\n*Chris Dave – drums (tracks: 3–9), percussion (tracks: 6, 7)\n*Aaron Paris – strings & strings arrangement (tracks: 3, 9)\n*Cory Henry – organ (tracks: 4, 7), electric bass keyboards (track 4), Hammond electric organ (tracks: 5, 6, 9), keyboards (tracks: 5, 7), electric piano (tracks: 6, 7, 10), piano (tracks: 9, 10), bass organ (track 10)\n*Lenny Castro – percussion (tracks: 4, 8, 9)\n*Kevin Scott – bass guitar (track 5), bass (track 9)\n*Mike Runyon – synth (track 7)\n*Justin Johnson – horns (tracks: 7, 8)\n*Christopher Spies – horns (track 7)\n*Isaiah Gage – cello & cello arrangement (track 11)\n*Rick Rubin – producer\n*Dylan Neustadter – engineering assistant\n*Stephen Marcussen – mastering\n*Sutton Davison – art direction, design\n*Lance Wilson – photography\n*Nick Leonard – photography\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2024)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak position\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
