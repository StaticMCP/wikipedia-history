La Boite Theatre Company, Queensland's second largest theatre company, operates from the Roundhouse Theatre on the Kelvin Grove campus of the Queensland University of Technology.\nIn common with many inner suburbs of Brisbane, the suburb has a mixture of traditional \"Queenslander\" homes, some post-war worker's cottages and more modern apartment blocks.\nHistory\nKevin Grove was part of what was known as the Three Mile Scrub.

In 1961 the Infants School was absorbed back into Kelvin Grove State School. Kelvin Grove State School was on the block surrounded by School Street, Tank Street, Victoria Park Road, and L'Estrange Terrace (), while the girls school and the infants school were on a \"extension\" triangular site on the eastern corner of L'Estrange Terrace and Victoria Park Road (), later part of the Kelvin Grove State High School.

Electric trolley-buses, also operated by the Brisbane City Council connected the suburb with Fortitude Valley, via Herston between 1953 and 1969.\nIn August 1914, 46 subdivided allotments of \"Bancroft Park Estate\" were advertised to be auctioned by Isles Love & Co. A map advertising the auction states the estate was fronting the Kelvin Grove tram line and easy walking distance of town. This property was situated at the Three Mile Bridge, on the Kelvin Grove tram line and was well known as the former residence of the late Dr Bancroft.\nKelvin Grove State High School opened on 23 January 1961. Kelvin Grove State High School was on the eastern corner of L'Estrange Terrace and Victoria Park Road () across the Victoria Park Road from Kelvin Grove State School. In January 2002, Kelvin Grove State School and Kelvin Grove State High School merged to become Kelvin Grove State College. Kelvin Grove State High School's website was archived. The section of Victoria Park Road between the two former schools was closed to create a single site and Tank Street was renamed to become part of Victoria Park Road.\nThe 1976 Spring Hill shooting came to a conclusion near Victoria Park Road and Rochester Terrace where multiple hostages were rescued and murderer William Robert Wilson was taken into custody.\nFollowing the closure of the Gona Barracks in 1998, the  site was used as the basis of an urban renewal program resulting in the Kelvin Grove Urban Village which integrates the Kelvin Grove campus of Queensland University of Technology with residential and commercial buildings.
