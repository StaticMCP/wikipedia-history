The book is also known as '''Kitāb al-Tījān li ma'rifati muluk al-zamān fi akhbar Qahtān' (The Book of Crowns, on the kings of yesteryear in the accounts of the Qahtānites).\nThe book later transmitted by Ibn Hisham who also worked on the As-Sīrah an-Nabawiyyah''. Ibn Hisham reported that he acquired the book's narratives from 'Abd al-Mun'im ibn Idris.|group=\"Notes\"}}\nContent\nThe book focuses on biographies, as well as the genealogy and ancestry of the rulers of the Himyarite Kingdom.\nIncluded in the book is a study of the genealogy of the descendants of Ham, son of Biblical Noah, which the book describe as progenitor of Habesha peoples or Ethiopian peoples. In this topic, Wahb also narrated the story of how the South Arabian king Sayf ibn Dhi Yazan had fought against the presence of Habesha peoples in the Arabian peninsula since the 6th century AD.\nThe book also discusses the identity of Dhu al-Qarnayn, whom is identified as being of Byzantine ancestry. However, Ibn Hisham also gives  his own personal commentary stating that Dhu al-Qarnayn was one of the Tababi'ah (plural of Tubba', the ruling title of the Himyarites), with the name of Sa'b ibn al-Harith (otherwise known as Sa'b Dhu Marathid). Dhu al-Qarnayn is also attributed with the action of conquering parts of the Iberian Peninsula.\nCommentaries\nIbn Hisham, who authored the commentaries of this book, also gave his own analysis that the name of Yemen were given from their primordial founder, Ya'rub ibn Qahtan, who is also known by his other name, \"Yaman\".\nModern historian Jan Retsö has suggested that the commentaries of Ibn Hisham have shown that there was interest from Muslim orthodoxy in his era to preserve the historiography of Yemeni tradition.\nModern historians have said that some entries and stories in the book, are, however, legendary in nature and may not reflect reality.\nList of kings mentioned in the book\nThe book structures mainly examines the descendants of South Arabian patriarch Qahtan.
