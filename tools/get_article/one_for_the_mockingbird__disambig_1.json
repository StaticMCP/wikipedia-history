It was released in 1987 as the third single from their first studio album, Broadcast. The song was written by the band's lead vocalist, Nick Van Eede.\n\"One for the Mockingbird\" is known for its catchy melody and introspective lyrics, which touch upon themes of longing, loneliness, and the search for connection. The mockingbird in the title and lyrics symbolizes a messenger or a guide, leading the singer through the emotional landscape of the song.\nThe song was moderately successful, reaching the top 40 in several countries, including the United States, where it peaked at number 38 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It also received significant airplay on radio stations and music television channels at the time of its release.\nDespite not achieving the same level of commercial success as their previous hit single \"(I Just) Died in Your Arms\", \"One for the Mockingbird\" remains a favorite among fans of Cutting Crew and is often remembered as one of their standout tracks.\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1987)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|Australian Chart\n|align=\"center\"|96\n|-\n|Belgium Chart\n|align=\"center\"|40\n|-\n|Canada Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|47\n|-\n|UK Singles (OCC)\n|align=\"center\"|52\n|-\n|US Billboard Hot 100\n|align=\"center\"|38\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n* https://lyrics.lyricfind.com/lyrics/cutting-crew-one-for-the-mockingbird"
