It was released internationally as Reactor. The plot follows an alien civilization, which, facing imminent extinction, kidnaps two famous genetic scientists from Earth. A troop of soldiers is dispatched to combat the humanoid robots and rescue the victims.\nCast\n*Antonio Sabato as Captain John Boyd\n*Yanti Somer as Julie\n*Malisa Longo as Lois\n*Giacomo Rossi Stuart as Roger\n*Aldo Canti as Kuba the Alien\n*Licinia Lentini as Commander King's assistant\n*Venantino Venantini as Paul\n*Jacques Herlin as Professor Carr\n*Ines Pellegrini as Sonia\nReception\nFantastic Musings found the movie to be bad. Salon noted that it was part of a series of B-movie Star Wars rip-offs from director Brescia. Those equally poorly received, sets, props, costumes, and actor-recycled \"sequels\" are Cosmos: War of the Planets, Battle of the Stars, Star Odyssey, and the adult film-inflected The Beast in Space.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
