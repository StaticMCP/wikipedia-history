After capturing and spoiling several cities, he marched upon the royal city of Dur-Papsukkal. According to Shamshi-Adad V's own inscriptions, he took the city after his troops slayed 13.000 soldiers. Afterwards, he looted its treasures and captured the palace women before razing and burning it.\nBabylonian King Marduk-balassu-iqbi did not arrive in time to save the city and, with his allied forces of Chaldeans, Elamites, Kassites and Arameans, faced the Assyrians near the city. Shamshi-Adad V claimed victory. This battle marked the limit of their advance on Babylonian lands for the year. He did not subdue Marduk-balassu-iqbi until the following year.\nClassical sources\n* Babylonian Chronicles: [https://www.livius.org/sources/content/mesopotamian-chronicles-content/abc-21-synchronic-chronicle/abc-21-synchronic-chronicle-2/ Synchronic Chronicle] (ABC 21/CM 10)\n* The Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia Assyrian Periods Vol 3 (RIMA)\nReferences"
