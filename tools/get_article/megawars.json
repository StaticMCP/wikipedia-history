The original MegaWars I was a port of Decwar, originally developed at the University of Texas at Austin. A port using a basic client/server protocol and a basic graphical interface on the TRS-80 Color Computer as MegaWars II was never released. MegaWars III followed, based on an entirely different engine originally developed by Kesmai.\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101001133433/http://www.megawars3.com/Default.aspx Mega Wars III The Rebirth]\n*[https://gamesoffame.wordpress.com/war-decwar-and-megawars/ MegaWars I info]\n*[https://gamesoffame.wordpress.com/megawars-iii/ MegaWars III info ]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050426000047/http://www.starhawk.net/mw3/combatref.htm Combat in MW3]\n*[http://www.starhawk.net/mw3/mw3.html Emperor Starhawk's Mega Wars III site]"
