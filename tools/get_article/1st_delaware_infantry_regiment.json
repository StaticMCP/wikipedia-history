Part of the II Corps it served in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War.\nOrganisation and Remusterings\n90-Day Volunteers\nWhen the Civil War began in April 1861, there were only about 16,000 men in the U.S. Army, and many Southern soldiers and officers were already resigning and joining the new Confederate States Army. With this drastic shortage of men in the army, President Abraham Lincoln called on the states to raise a force of 75,000 volunteers for three months to put down the insurrection in the South. Accordingly, the 1st Delaware Infantry Regiment was raised at Wilmington, Delaware, on May 22, 1861, and mustered into Federal service on May 28. The regiment comprised 37 officers and 742 enlisted men under the command of Colonel Henry H. Lockwood.\nThe original Field & Staff were:\nColonel: Henry H. Lockwood\nLieutenant Colonel: John W. Andrews\nMajor: Robert Lamott\nSurgeon: R. W. Johnson\nAssistant-Surgeon: James Knight\nAdjutant: Lieutenant W. P. Seville\nQuartermaster: H. Alderdice\nThe original Company Commanders were:\nCo.

G (Sussex Volunteers): Cpt. J. Rodney Layton\nCo. H: Cpt. S.H. Jenskins\nCo. I: Cpt. James Leonard\nCo. K: Cpt. Smith\nThe regiment was attached to the command of Major General John Dix ('Dix's Command\", Department of the Potomac) and assigned to duty along the line of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad. The regiment mustered out on August 30, 1861.\n3-Years Volunteers\nOn July 22, 1861, the United States Congress authorized a volunteer army of 500,000 men. When in August the enlistment term for the regiment ended a new 1st Regiment was raised for a term of three years at Wilmington, Delaware, between September 10 and October 19, 1861. This time the regiment had 37 officers and 846 enlisted men under the command of Colonel John W. Andrews.\nThe Field & Staff were:\nColonel: John W. Andrews\nLieutenant Colonel: 0.

Thomas Crassley\nVeteran Volunteers\nOn July 1, 1864, the 3 years enlistment would have ended and the regiment would be mustered out. Instead in July 1863 the men, still having nine months of their enlistment left, got the chance to reenlist for another 3 years from that date. On December 19, 1863, three quarters of the regiment reenlisted. The 1st Delaware was upgraded to veteran status as 1st Delaware Veteran Infantry Regiment. The 1st Delaware Infantry claimed to be first regiment in the Union to receive the coveted veteran status.\nIn April 1864 the 1st Delaware absorbed the remnants of the 2nd Delaware Infantry Regiment, a number of recruits and veterans with two complete companies.\nService and engagements\n1861\n* Raised at Wilmington—May 22, 1861\n* Mustered into Federal service—May 28\n* Col.
