This marked 100 years of Rugby league in Australia. Each Club would play a rivalry match against a Club that joined the competition at a similar time, or a club which had inherited a legacy of a past club.\nHeritage Jerseys\nClubs wear a different Jersey to their normal home and away strips to mark the significance of the Heritage Round clashes. It is an opportunity for clubs and fans to reflect on their heritage and past glories. As such Jerseys similar to a club's original strip, or strip worn at a particular match or final are a way to reignite rivalries and past glories.\nSome examples of jerseys worn in Heritage Round reflect the jersey worn by a side when it first entered the NRL include that worn by the Brisbane Broncos, South Sydney Rabbitohs, St George Illawarra Dragons or Sydney Roosters. The design or colours of a jersey might also denote respect for a side from the same area which no longer exists, such as the design of the Gold Coast Titans and Newcastle Knights heritage jerseys in 2008.\nClubs have also worn Jerseys that reflect an important milestone or event. An example of this is the Balmain Heritage Jersey worn by the Wests Tigers in the 2009 Heritage Round, marking 40 years since a famous Grand Final clash with the South Sydney Rabbitohs. Another example is the Melbourne Storm wearing their 2000 away strip in 2009 as it marked the first Jersey in predominantly purple colours.\nHeritage Round 2008 - Centenary of Rugby League\nThe first NRL Heritage Round was played out in Round 6, 2008. It was set down to celebrate the anniversary of the first round of the 1908 premiership. Teams wore jerseys reflecting their club or region's first season in the competition.\n{| border=1 style=\"border-collapse:collapse; font-size:90%;\" cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 width=100%\n|- bgcolor=#C1D8FF\n!rowspan=2 width=21%|Home\n!rowspan=2 width=6%|Score\n!rowspan=2 width=21%|Away\n!colspan=6|Match Information\n|- bgcolor=#EFEFEF\n!width=17%|Date and Time\n!width=17%|Venue\n!width=11%|Referee\n!width=7%|Crowd\n|- align=center bgcolor=#F5FAFF\n|align=left | Gold Coast Titans\n|26-24\n|align=left | Brisbane Broncos\n| 18 April 2008, 7:30pm\n|Skilled Park\n|Tony Archer\n|27,176\n|- align=center bgcolor=#F5FAFF\n|align=left |  Parramatta Eels\n|16-20\n|align=left |  Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles\n| 18 April 2008, 7:30pm\n|Parramatta Stadium\n|Shayne Hayne\n|14,025\n|- align=center bgcolor=#F5FAFF\n|align=left |  Bulldogs\n|30-18\n|align=left | St George Illawarra Dragons\n| 19 April 2008, 5:30pm\n|ANZ Stadium\n|Bernard Sutton\n|14,767\n|- align=center bgcolor=#F5FAFF\n|align=left |  North Queensland Cowboys\n|48-20\n|align=left |  New Zealand Warriors\n| 19 April 2008, 7:30pm\n|Dairy Farmers Stadium\n|Jason Robinson\n|20,554\n|- align=center bgcolor=#F5FAFF\n|align=left |  Cronulla Sharks\n|20-21\n|align=left |  Penrith Panthers\n| 19 April 2008, 7:30pm\n|Toyota Stadium\n|Sean Hampstead\n|13,852\n|- align=center bgcolor=#F5FAFF\n|align=left |  Sydney Roosters\n|20-34\n|align=left |  Newcastle Knights\n| 20 April 2008, 2:00pm\n|Bluetongue Stadium\n|Steve Lyons\n|14,176\n|- align=center bgcolor=#F5FAFF\n|align=left | Wests Tigers\n|30-10\n|align=left | South Sydney Rabbitohs\n| 20 April 2008, 3:00pm\n|Sydney Cricket Ground\n|Ben Cummins\n|19,122\n|- align=center bgcolor=#F5FAFF\n|align=left |  Canberra Raiders\n|16-23\n|align=left |  Melbourne Storm\n| 21 April 2008, 7:00pm\n|Canberra Stadium\n|Jared Maxwell\n|15,550\n|}\nHeritage Round 2009 - Second Heritage Round\nThe second NRL Heritage Round was played out in Round 10. The round opened with a thrilling match between the Dragons and Bulldogs, in which Hazem El Masri played his 300th career game, that was controversially settled by the Video Referee disallowing a try to Jamal Idris in the last minute to deny the Bulldogs victory in front of a packed Jubilee Oval. On the same night, a large crowd turned out in Brisbane to watch the local derby between the Brisbane Broncos and Gold Coast Titans.\nAnother memorable match was played out at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Sunday afternoon, as South Sydney and the Wests Tigers relived the 1969 Grand Final, with Souths narrowly defeating the Tigers in the dying moments of the game with a field goal.\n{| border=1 style=\"border-collapse:collapse; font-size:90%;\" cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 width=100%\n|- bgcolor=#C1D8FF\n!rowspan=2 width=21%|Home\n!rowspan=2 width=6%|Score\n!rowspan=2 width=21%|Away\n!colspan=6|Match Information\n|- bgcolor=#EFEFEF\n!width=17%|Date and Time (Local)\n!width=17%|Venue\n!width=11%|Referee\n!width=7%|Crowd\n|- align=center bgcolor=#F5FAFF\n|align=left | Brisbane Broncos\n|32-18\n|align=left | Gold Coast Titans\n|15 May 2009, 7:35pm\n|Suncorp Stadium\n|Gavin BadgerShane Hayne\n|43,079\n|- align=center bgcolor=#F5FAFF\n|align=left | St George Illawarra Dragons\n|20-18\n|align=left | Bulldogs\n|15 May 2009, 7:35pm\n|WIN Jubilee Oval\n|Tony ArcherAshley Klein\n|18,415\n|- align=center bgcolor=#F5FAFF\n|align=left | Sydney Roosters\n|6-38\n|align=left | Newcastle Knights\n|16 May 2009, 5:30pm\n|Sydney Football Stadium\n|Chris JamesSteve Lyons\n|8,611\n|- align=center bgcolor=#F5FAFF\n|align=left | Penrith Panthers\n|26-22\n|align=left |  Cronulla Sharks\n|16 May 2009, 7:30pm\n|CUA Stadium\n|Jared MaxwellGerard Sutton\n|11,750\n|- align=center bgcolor=#F5FAFF\n|align=left |New Zealand Warriors\n|12-34\n|align=left | North Queensland Cowboys\n|17 May 2009, 12:00pm\n|Mt Smart Stadium\n|Ben CumminsAlan Shortall\n|16,345\n|- align=center bgcolor=#F5FAFF\n|align=left |  Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles\n|34-10\n|align=left |  Parramatta Eels\n|17 May 2009, 2:00pm\n|Brookvale Oval\n|Gavin BadgerTony De Las Heras\n|15,916\n|- align=center bgcolor=#F5FAFF\n|align=left |  Wests Tigers\n|22-23\n|align=left |  South Sydney Rabbitohs\n|17 May 2009, 3:00pm\n|Sydney Cricket Ground\n|Ashley KleinJason Robinson\n|29,970\n|- align=center bgcolor=#F5FAFF\n|align=left |  Melbourne Storm\n|46-6\n|align=left |  Canberra Raiders\n|18 May 2009, 7:00pm\n|Olympic Park Stadium\n|Tony ArcherBrett Suttor\n|10,112\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n*AFL Heritage Round\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
