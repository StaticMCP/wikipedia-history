After the proclamation of the republic, it participated in the 1931 general election among the lists of the combined republican-socialist coalition, receiving 22 seats.\nIn August 1931, the party changed its name to the \"Progressive Republican Party\" (). During the constitutional discussions, the progressives, together with the radicals of Lerroux, abandoned the republican socialist coalition. A little later, in January 1932, its right wing, led by Miguel Maura, split off, taking 13 of the delegates of the party to the Conservative Republican Party (). The party disappeared at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080503140603/http://www.sbhac.net/Republica/Introduccion/FRincon.htm La proclamación de la Segunda República Española. 70 Aniversario]"
