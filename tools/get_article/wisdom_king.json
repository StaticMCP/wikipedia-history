Acala is at the center.]]\nA wisdom king (; IAST: , ) is a type of wrathful deity in East Asian Buddhism.\nWhereas the Sanskrit name is translated literally as \"wisdom / knowledge king(s),\" the term  in Vajrayana Buddhism is also specifically used to denote mantras; the term may thus also be rendered \"mantra king(s).\"  is translated in Chinese with the character 明 (lit. \"bright, radiant\", figuratively \"knowledge(able), wisdom, wise\"), leading to a wide array of alternative translations such as \"bright king(s)\" or \"radiant king(s)\". A similar category of fierce deities known as herukas are found in Tibetan Buddhism.\nThe female counterparts of wisdom kings are known as wisdom queens (Sanskrit (IAST): , ).\nOverview\nDevelopment\n, as their name suggests, are originally conceived of as the guardians and personifications of esoteric wisdom (), namely mantras and dharanis. They were seen as embodying the mystic power contained in these sacred utterances.\nDuring the early stages of esoteric (Vajrayana) Buddhism, many of the deities that would become known as  (a term that only came into use around the late 7th-early 8th century) were mainly seen as attendants of bodhisattvas who were invoked for specific ends such as the removal of misfortune and obstacles to enlightenment. They personified certain attributes of these bodhisattvas such as their wisdom or the power of their voices and were held to perform various tasks such as gathering together sentient beings to whom the bodhisattva preaches, subjugating unruly elements, or protecting adherents of Buddhism. Eventually, these divinities became objects of veneration in their own right; no longer necessarily paired with a bodhisattva, they became considered as the manifestations of the bodhisattvas themselves and/or of buddhas, who are believed to assume terrifying forms as a means to save sentient beings out of compassion for them. A belief prevalent in the Japanese tradition known as the  (, \"bodies of the three wheels\") theory for instance posits that five Wisdom Kings are the fierce incarnations (, , lit. \"embodiments of the wheel of injunction\") of the Five Wisdom Buddhas, who appear both as gentle bodhisattvas who teach the Dharma through compassion and as terrifying  who teach through fear, shocking nonbelievers into faith.\nwith Yamāntaka, from Kurkihar (Bihar), currently at the Indian Museum in Kolkata. 10th century.|left]]\nThe evolution of the  will be illustrated here by the deity Yamāntaka, one of the earliest Buddhist wrathful deities. In the 6th century text , Yamāntaka is portrayed as the oath-bound servant of the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī who assembles all beings from across the world to hear the Buddha's preaching and vanquishes (and converts) those who are hostile to Buddhism; at the same time, Yamāntaka is also the personification of Mañjuśrī's dharani, the benefits of which are identical to his abilities. He was also commonly depicted in statuary along with Mañjuśrī as a diminutive yaksha-like attendant figure.\nLater, as Yamāntaka and similar subordinates of various bodhisattvas (e.g. Hayagrīva, who was associated with Avalokiteśvara) became fully independent deities, they began to be portrayed by themselves and increasingly acquired iconographic attributes specific to each. Yamāntaka, for instance, is commonly shown with six heads, arms, and legs and riding or standing on a buffalo mount. The status and function of these deities have shifted from being minor emissaries who gather together and intimidate recalcitrant beings to being intimately involved in the primary task of esoteric Buddhism: the transformation of passions and ignorance () into compassion and wisdom. As a result of this development, the relationship between Mañjuśrī and Yamāntaka was recontextualized such that Yamāntaka is now considered to be the incarnation of Mañjuśrī himself (so the ). Eventually, in the  interpretation of Japanese esoteric Buddhism, both Yamāntaka and Mañjuśrī - under the name  (, ) - became classified as avatars of the buddha Amitābha.\nOther Wisdom Kings followed a more or less similar development. Hayagrīva, for example, was originally the horse-headed incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu which was adopted into Buddhism as Avalokiteśvara's attendant (although unlike the Hindu Hayagrīva, the Buddhist figure was never portrayed with a horse's head, instead being depicted like Yamāntaka as a yaksha who may have a miniature horse head emerging from his hair). Eventually, as Hayagrīva increasingly rose to prominence, the distinction between him and his superior became increasingly blurred so that he ultimately turned into one of Avalokiteśvara's many guises in both China and Japan. One of the more famous vidyārājas, Acala (Acalanātha), was originally an acolyte or messenger of the buddha Vairocana before he was interpreted as Vairocana's fierce aspect or  in the Japanese tradition. (In Nepal and Tibet, meanwhile, he is instead identified as the incarnation of either Mañjuśrī or the buddha Akṣobhya.)\nIconography\n(1368 - 1644) Shuilu ritual painting of Yamantaka (Dàwēidé Míngwáng), one out of a set depicting the Ten Wisdom Kings, at Baoning Temple[[:zh:宝宁寺_(朔州市)|[zh]]] in Shanxi, China. ]]\nThe iconography of Buddhist wrathful deities are usually considered to be derived from yaksha.\nWisdom Kings are usually represented as fierce-looking, often with blue or black skin and multiple heads, arms, and legs. They hold various weapons in their hands and are sometimes adorned with skulls, snakes or animal skins and wreathed in flames. This fiery aura is symbolically interpreted as the fire that purifies the practitioner and transforms one's passions into awakening, the so-called \"fire samadhi\" ( ).\nCertain vidyārājas bear attributes that reflect the historical rivalry between Hinduism and Buddhism. For instance, the Wisdom King Trailokyavijaya is shown defeating and trampling on the deva Maheśvara (one of the Buddhist analogues to Shiva) and his consort Umā (Pārvatī). A commentary on the Mahavairocana Tantra by the Tang monk Yi Xing meanwhile attributes the taming of Maheśvara to another , Acala.\nList of Wisdom Kings\nThe Five Wisdom Kings\nIn Chinese and Japanese (Shingon and Tendai) esoteric Buddhism, the Five Great Wisdom Kings (, ; ), also known as the Five Guardian Kings, are a group of vidyārājas who are considered to be both the fierce emanations of the Five Wisdom Buddhas and the guardians of Buddhist doctrine. Organized according to the five directions (the four cardinal points plus the center), the Five Kings are usually defined as follows:\n* Acala / Acalanātha () - Manifestation of Mahāvairocana, associated with the center\n* Trailokyavijaya () - Manifestation of Akṣobhya, associated with the east\n* Kuṇḍali / Amṛtakuṇḍalin () - Manifestation of Ratnasambhava, associated with the south\n* Yamāntaka () - Manifestation of Amitābha, associated with the west\n* Vajrayakṣa () - Manifestation of Amoghasiddhi, associated with the north in the Shingon school\n** Ucchuṣma () - Associated with the north in the Tendai school\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|\n|align = \"center\"|Vajrayakṣa or Ucchuṣma\n(north)\n|\n|-\n|align = \"center\"|Yamāntaka\n(west)\n|align = \"center\"|Acala\n(center)\n|align = \"center\"|Trailokyavijaya\n(east)\n|-\n|\n|align = \"center\"|Kuṇḍali\n(south)\n|\n|}\nThe Eight Wisdom Kings\nIn Chinese Buddhism, the Eight Great Wisdom Kings () is another grouping of Wisdom Kings that is depicted in statues, mural art and paintings. The acknowledged canonical source of the grouping of eight is The Sūtra of the Blazing Uṣṇīṣa of the Wondrous Vajra Kuṇḍali and Yamāntaka (). Another canonical source for the grouping of eight is the  (), the Chinese translation of which, completed in about 980-1000 CE, is attributed to the monk Tianxizai, who is possibly the north Indian Shantideva.   Each of the Wisdom Kings correspond to one of the Eight Great Bodhisattvas[[:zh:八大菩萨|[]] in Chinese Buddhism as well as to a specific compass direction.\nThe Eight Wisdom Kings, with exceptions in certain lists, are usually defined as:\n* Acala () - Manifestation of Sarvanivāraṇaviṣkambhin, associated with the north-east\n* Kuṇḍali () - Manifestation of Ākāśagarbha, associated with the north-west\n* Trailokyavijaya () - Manifestation of Vajrapāṇi, associated with the south-east\n* Yamāntaka () - Manifestation of Mañjuśrī, associated with the east\n*Mahācakra () - Manifestation of Maitreya, associated with the south-west\n*Padanakṣipa () - Manifestation of Samantabhadra, associated with the north\n*Aparājita () - Manifestation of Kṣitigarbha, associated with the south\n*Hayagrīva () - Manifestation of Avalokiteśvara (Guanyin), associated with the west\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|align = \"center\"|Kuṇḍali\n(north-west)\n|align = \"center\"|Padanakṣipa\n(north)\n|align = \"center\"|Acala\n(north-east)\n|-\n|align = \"center\"|Hayagrīva\n(west)\n|\n|align = \"center\"|Yamāntaka\n(east)\n|-\n|align = \"center\"|Mahācakra\n(south-west)\n|align = \"center\"|Aparājita\n(south)\n|align = \"center\"|Trailokyavijaya\n(south-east)\n|}\nThe Ten Wisdom Kings\nThe more common grouping found in Chinese Buddhism is the Ten Great Wisdom Kings (). Several groupings of the Ten Kings exist based on different canonical scriptural sources, each of which differ slightly in the naming of certain vidyārājas and attributing certain Kings to different Buddhas and bodhisattvas. Some examples of acknowledged canonical sources for the grouping of the Ten Wisdom Kings are The Sūtra of the Liturgy for Brilliant Contemplation of the Ten Wrathful Wisdom Kings of the Illusory Net of the Great Yoga Teachings () as well as The Sūtra with the Great Instructions that are Universal, Secret, and Unexcelled about the Contemplations of Mañjuśrī ().\nIn contemporary Chinese Buddhist practice, the Ten Wisdom Kings are regularly invoked in ceremonies and rituals, such as the  ceremony, where they are provided offerings and entreated to expel evil from the ritual platform. In particular, ritual paintings of the Ten Wisdom Kings are arranged in a particular maṇḍala () during the  ceremony, with a particular direction associated with each Wisdom King. The Wisdom King Ucchuṣma (), a manifestation of Śakyamuni, is not counted among the Ten Wisdom Kings in the ceremony, but he is still invoked separately from the grouping in the same ritual and his image is typically enshrined ahead of the outer north direction of the maṇḍala of the Ten Wisdom Kings. The specific list of the Ten Wisdom Kings invoked during the  ceremony, along with their associated directions in the maṇḍala, is canonized in the ceremony's ritual manual () based on scriptural sources. They are as follows:\n* Acala () - Manifestation of Sarvanivāraṇaviṣkambhin, associated with the east\n* Trailokyavijaya () - Manifestation of Vajrapāṇi, associated with the outer south\n* Kuṇḍali () - Manifestation of Amitābha, associated with the inner north\n* Yamāntaka () - Manifestation of the Mañjuśrī, associated with the north-east\n*Mahācakra () - Manifestation of Maitreya, associated with the outer north\n*Padanakṣipa () - Manifestation of Samantabhadra, associated with the south-west\n*Aparājita () - Manifestation of Kṣitigarbha, associated with the inner south\n*Hayagrīva () - Manifestation of Avalokiteśvara (Guanyin), associated with the west\n*Vajrahāsa () - Manifestation of Ākāśagarbha, associated with the south-east\n*Mahābala () -  Manifestation of Śakyamuni, associated with the north-west\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|\n| align=\"center\"|Mahācakra\n(outer north)\n|\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |Mahābala\n(north-west)\n| align=\"center\" |Kuṇḍali\n(inner north)\n| align=\"center\" |Yamāntaka\n(north-east)\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |Hayagrīva\n(west)\n|\n| align=\"center\" |Acala\n(east)\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |Padanakṣipa\n(south-west)\n| align=\"center\" |Aparājita\n(inner south)\n| align=\"center\" |Vajrahāsa\n(south-east)\n|-\n|\n| align=\"center\"|Trailokyavijaya\n(outer south)\n|}\nFile:永安寺传法正宗殿忿怒大威德大力明王.jpg|Mahābala ()\nFile:永安寺传法正宗殿忿怒大威德无能胜明王侧视角.jpg|Hayagrīva ()\nFile:永安寺传法正宗殿忿怒大威德马首明王.jpg|Acala ()\nFile:永安寺传法正宗殿忿怒大威德甘露军吒利明王.jpg|Aparajita ()\nFile:永安寺传法正宗殿忿怒大威德不动尊明王.jpg|Yamāntaka ()\nFile:永安寺传法正宗殿忿怒大威德步掷明王.jpg|Padanaksipa ()\nFile:永安寺传法正宗殿忿怒大威德降三世明王.jpg|Vajrahāsa ()\nFile:永安寺传法正宗殿 忿怒大威德大笑明王.jpg|Trailokyavijaya ()\nFile:永安寺传法正宗殿忿怒大威德焰鬘德迦明王.jpg|Kuṇḍali ()\nFile:永安寺传法正宗之殿忿怒大轮明王.jpg|Mahācakra ()\nOthers\n(Aizen Myōō), 13th century, Japan.
