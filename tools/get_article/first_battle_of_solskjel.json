Harald was again victorious, and his two opponents Huntiof, King of Nordmøre and his father-in-law, King Nokkve of Romsdal, were both slain in battle. However Solve Klove, the son of King Huntiof escaped.\nAfter the battle Harald laid both countries under his rule, and stayed there for the rest of the summer.\nSee also\n*Second battle of Solskjel\n*Glymdrápa\nReferences\nPrimary source\n* Sturluson, Snorri.
