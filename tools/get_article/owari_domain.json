Situated in the western region of what is now Aichi Prefecture, it covered portions of Owari, Mino, and Shinano provinces, with its central administration based at Nagoya Castle. At its zenith, the Owari Domain boasted an impressive rating of 619,500 koku, making it the largest landholding of the Tokugawa clan outside of the shogunal territories. The ruling clan of the Owari Domain was the Tokugawa clan, holding the prestigious position of the highest rank among the gosanke. Additionally, the domain was sometimes referred to as the Nagoya Domain due to its association with Nagoya Castle.\nHistory\nOwari was initially ruled by Fukushima Masanori with 240,000 koku until the Battle of Sekigahara in September 1600. After his military achievements, he was reassigned to the Hiroshima Domain. Matsudaira Tadayoshi, the fourth son of Tokugawa Ieyasu, took control of the Kiyosue Domain with 520,000 koku after Fukushima's departure. Tadayoshi died in 1607 without an heir, leading the territory to become Tenryo.Tokugawa Yoshinao, Ieyasu's ninth son, arrived from the Kai-Kofu Domain with 472,344 koku and established a clan in Owari, expanding the domain over time. By 1619, the domain had grown to 563,206 koku, with an additional 50,000 koku added in 1671 to assert its position as one of the top three families. The total koku reached 619,500, encompassing territories in Mino, Mikawa, Shinano, Omi, and Settsu. Despite officially having just under 620,000 koku, efforts to cultivate new fields led to an estimated actual koku of nearly 1 million, showcasing the domain's prosperity under Tokugawa Yoshinao's leadership. The first lord of the domain, Yoshinao Tokugawa, was still a child when he took office, so the early administration of the domain was carried out by Ieyasu's old retainers, but after he grew up, Yoshinao himself took charge of water supply, new rice field development, and annual taxes in order to increase rice production. He worked to establish the system and established the domain government.\nTokugawa Yoshinao, the initial ruler of the territory, took on the responsibilities of managing the water supply, developing new rice fields, and handling taxes to boost rice production and establish the domain's administrative structure. Tokugawa Mitsutomo, the second lord, focused on policies related to temples and shrines, but excessive reconstruction led to financial instability. Fiscal reforms were implemented, but natural disasters further weakened the domain's finances. Tokugawa Tsunamasa, the third lord, had a strong connection to the Shogun through his mother, contributing to the expansion and diversification of the Tokugawa clan's influence and power. After the restoration of imperial rule, oshikatsu played a crucial role in urging Tokugawa Yoshinobu to resign. He aligned himself with the new government during the Battle of Toba-Fushimi and actively suppressed the Sabaku faction during the Aomatsuba Incident. Yoshikatsu Tokugawa, former feudal lord, was appointed leader of the Tokaido clans by the Meiji government after the Battle of Toba-Fushimi. He oversaw the Tokaido fudai clans and sent envoys to neutralize Kokugaku groups to facilitate the passage of new government forces.\nIn 1870, Yoshikatsu absorbed the financially troubled Takasu Domain to strengthen its stability. On July 14, 1871, the domain was abolished and transformed into Nagoya Prefecture, which later merged with Inuyama Prefecture to become Aichi Prefecture. It further merged with Nukata Prefecture to form present-day Aichi Prefecture.\nList of daimyo\n{| class=wikitable\n|+Owari Tokugawa family, 1600–1871 (Fudai daimyo)\n! #||Name || Tenure || Courtesy title || Court Rank || kokudaka\n|-\n|1||Tokugawa Yoshinao (徳川義直)||1607–1650|| Uhyoe no kami (右兵衛神)||Junior 4th Rank Lower Grade (従四位下)|| 619,500 koku\n|-\n|2||Tokugawa Mitsutomo (徳川光友)||1650–1693|| Gon Dainagon (権大納言)||Junior 4th Rank Lower Grade (従四位下)|| 619,500 koku\n|-\n|3||Tokugawa Tsunanari (徳川綱誠)||1693–1699|| Chunagon Jusanmi (中納言従三位)||Junior 4th Rank Lower Grade (従四位下)|| 619,500 koku\n|-\n|4||Tokugawa Yoshimichi (徳川吉通)||1699–1713|| Chunagon Jusanmi (中納言従三位)||Junior 4th Rank Lower Grade (従四位下)|| 619,500 koku\n|-\n|5||Tokugawa Gorōta (徳川五郎太)||1713|| none||Junior 3rd Rank Lower Grade (従三位下) ||619,500 koku\n|-\n|6||Tokugawa Tsugutomo (徳川継友)||1713–1730|| Chunagon Jusanmi (中納言従三位)||Junior 4th Rank Lower Grade (従四位下)|| 619,500 koku\n|-\n|7||Tokugawa Muneharu (徳川宗春)||1730–1739|| Chunagon Jusanmi (中納言従三位)||Junior 4th Rank Lower Grade (従四位下)|| 619,500 koku\n|-\n|8||Tokugawa Munekatsu (徳川宗勝)||1739–1761|| Chunagon Jusanmi (中納言従三位)||Junior 4th Rank Lower Grade (従四位下)|| 619,500 koku\n|-\n|9||Tokugawa Munechika (徳川宗睦)||1761–1799|| Gon Dainagon (権大納言)||Junior 4th Rank Lower Grade (従四位下)|| 619,500 koku\n|-\n|10||Tokugawa Naritomo (徳川斉朝)||1799–1827|| Gyogon Dainagon (行厳大納言)||Junior 4th Rank Lower Grade (従四位下)|| 619,500 koku\n|-\n|11||Tokugawa Nariharu (徳川斉温)||1827–1839|| Gon Dainagon (権大納言)||Junior 4th Rank Lower Grade (従四位下)|| 619,500 koku\n|-\n|12||Tokugawa Naritaka (徳川斉荘)||1839–1845|| Gon Dainagon (権大納言)||Junior 4th Rank Lower Grade (従四位下)|| 619,500 koku\n|-\n|13||Tokugawa Yoshitsugu (徳川慶臧)||1845–1849|| none|| Junior 4th Rank Lower Grade (従四位下)|| 619,500 koku\n|-\n|14||Tokugawa Yoshikumi (徳川慶恕)||1849–1858|| Chunagon Jusanmi (中納言従三位)||Junior 4th Rank Lower Grade (従四位下)|| 619,500 koku\n|-\n|15||Tokugawa Mochinaga (徳川茂徳)||1858–1863|| Gon Dainagon (権大納言)||Junior 4th Rank Lower Grade (従四位下)|| 619,500 koku\n|-\n|16||Tokugawa Yoshinori (徳川義宜)||1863–1869|| Konoe, Kon no Chujo (近衛、今中将)|| Junior 4th Rank Lower Grade (従四位下)|| 619,500 koku\n|-\n|17||Tokugawa Yoshikatsu (徳川慶恕)||1869–1871|| Chunagon Jusanmi (中納言従三位)||Junior 4th Rank Lower Grade (従四位下)|| 619,500 koku\n|-\n|}\nSub-domains\nThe Owari Domain was supported by the Yanagawa Domain in Mutsu Province and the Takasu Domain in Mino Province.\nYanagawa Domain\nwas a feudal domain under the Tokugawa shogunate of Edo period Japan, in what is now eastern Fukuoka Prefecture.
