Fresh broadcasts from studios in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, on the Small Scale Birmingham Multiplex and online.\nHistory\nThe station was initially opened under the name Hit1FM as a hobby radio station in July 2013, by Aaron Gregory. The station was designed to target ages 16–24 living and working in the area, and achieved a listenership of approximately 1000 listeners daily via internet radio. The station spent the first three years of its broadcasting life operating from a bedroom in Coventry. The station then opted to rebrand to Fresh in January 2017 when plans to launch on digital radio were made public. Fresh serves a population of up to 900,000 people in the local area and is run by station manager Aaron Gregory alongside a team of 15 volunteer radio presenters. The station launched on the Coventry DAB multiplex on March 28 at 0800 am with an opening launch sequence.\nAfter being on the Coventry & Warwickshire Multiplex for sometime, the station decided to come off due to a studio move to Kenilworth, Warwickshire.\nFresh maintains a large presence at local events in the community, aiming to link local residents to their community.\nDaily programming includes a breakfast show, generally automated programming throughout the day, with presenter-led shows in the evening with a variety of genres.\nStudios\nThe station moved from original studios in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, to purpose-built studios in Kenilworth in September 2018.
