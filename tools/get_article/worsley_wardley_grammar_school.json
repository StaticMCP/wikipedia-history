It was run by the Lancashire Education Committee. Wardley Hall was nearby on the other side of the A6.\nThe school was located for the majority of its life in Mardale Avenue (off Ash Drive), Wardley, a locality west of Swinton, in the county of Lancashire - later Greater Manchester, in the parish of All Saints', Wardley. It was situated just north of Manchester Road (A6) in Wardley and just east (next to) of the M61/M60 junction (junction 15 of the current M60) - the Worsley Braided Interchange.\nComprehensive\nIn September 1972 it became a five form comprehensive school for ages 11–16, the Worsley Wardley High School with around 600 boys and girls in 1973 and 800 in 1978. After 1974, it was administered by the City of Salford. In September 1988, the Wardley High School and Pendlebury High School merged to become The Swinton High School, an 11-16 comprehensive.\nFour members of the Happy Mondays went to this school. The other two went to the St Ambrose Barlow RC High School.\nFurther education college\nIt became the Wardley Campus of Salford College by the 1990s. Salford College became Salford City College in January 2009.\nThe Mardale Avenue building is now demolished, with St. Ambrose Barlow Roman Catholic High School occupying the old school grounds.
