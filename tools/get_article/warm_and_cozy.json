But that doesn't stop her from losing her job, her house and her boyfriend in quick succession, so she unwillingly sets off to start a new life in Jeju Island.\nThere, she meets Baek Gun-woo, chef and owner of the restaurant \"Warm and Cozy.\". Jung-joo met Baek Gun-woo previously during their nineteenth birthday and mistaken that they are twin. Jung-joo first mistakes him for a con artist, because he can't seem to help himself from telling charming lies left and right.
