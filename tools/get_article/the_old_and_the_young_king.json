It was produced by a subsidiary of Tobis Film. Location shooting took place around Potsdam, including at the Garrison Church. Interiors were shot at the Grunewald and Johannisthal Studios. It premiered at the Ufa-Palast am Zoo.\nPart of the tradition of Prussian films of the Weimar and Nazi eras, the film ostensibly deals with the intense conflict between Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm I and his son and heir, Crown Prince Friedrich &ndash; the future King Friedrich II \"The Great\". This well-known incident of 18th century German history drew much contemporary attention and subsequently inspired a number of works of art and entertainment, including various stage and screen productions.\nHowever, in its specific presentation of this historical theme, the film was a work of Nazi propaganda aimed at extolling the Führerprinzip, i.e. blind obedience to the Leader (the King in the film's plot, Hitler in the reality for which the film was a parable); complaints of \"encirclement\" and the need for Lebensraum also feature.\nFor that reason, the film was banned by the Allied military government following the Nazi defeat in 1945. However, after the foundation of the Federal Republic of Germany the FSK (\"Voluntary Self Regulation of the Movie Industry\") reviewed it on 4 August 1958 and ruled that, unlike other films made under the Nazis, the propaganda element in it was not so blatant as to justify its inclusion in the list of \"Forbidden Films\" (:de:Vorbehaltsfilm).\nPlot\nThe film opens at Potsdam in the time of \"The Soldier King\" Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia, with the royal family sitting at the breakfast table. It turns out that Crown Prince Friedrich, informally called \"Fritz\", lost so much money at the gaming tables that he had to sign IOUs. Moreover, members of the grenadier regiment saw the Crown Prince appearing late for roll call in a dishevelled state, which greatly angers his father.\nThe King wants to prepare his son for his future role as a ruler, and regards his preoccupation with music and literature with much displeasure. Exasperated with his father's strictness, Fritz hatches a plan to flee Prussia and get to France and England, where he expects to be welcomed by his mother's family. He asks his companion Katte to help him in this plan. However, being a second lieutenant bound by his officer's code, Katte at first declines.\nThe father-son conflict further escalates when Fritz reveals even heavier gambling debts than those the King already paid off. The King insults the Crown Prince, calling him \"a liar and a coward\" and has him put under arrest. In the barracks, he is forbidden to engage in his beloved flute playing or to read French literature.\nAt night the King returns earlier than usual and surprises the Crown Prince playing the flute in the music room together with his sister Wilhelmine. Katte, who is also present, manages to hide just in time. The angry King throws Fritz's books and flute into the open fire and orders the Crown Prince to accompany him on a trip to Southern Germany. Fritz, more than ever determined to go ahead with his escape plan, can count on Katte's support after this incident.\nHowever, the escape fails, and both the Crown Prince and Second Lieutenant Katte are condemned by a court martial to custody at the fortress of Küstrin. However, the irate King arbitrarily amends the judgement against Katte to capital punishment and insists on having him actually executed.\nThe Crown Prince submits to the King's authority and is moved to better quarters in a palace. Nevertheless, in a visit by the King it is evident that the relationship between father and son is still very chilly and they are estranged. Fritz, who in the meantime has proved his \"character,\" is now given his own household at Rheinsberg Castle where he can again follow his artistic inclinations.\nReconciliation between the estranged father and son does come about shortly before the death of the King. The last words of the Old King to the Young are: \"Make Prussia great!\" (The audience, aware of basic elements of German history included in their school curriculum, know that Friedrich would duly proceed to do just that.)\nCast\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
