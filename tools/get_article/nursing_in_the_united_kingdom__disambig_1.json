It has evolved from assisting physicians to encompass a variety of professional roles. More than 780,000 registered nurses practise in the UK, working in settings such as hospitals, health centres, nursing homes, hospices, communities, military, prisons, and academia. Many are employed by the National Health Service (NHS).\nNursing is split into four fields: adults, children, mental health, and learning disability. Within these nurses may work within specialties such as medical care or theatres, and may specialise further in areas such as cardiac care. Nurses often work in multi-disciplinary teams, but increasingly work independently, and may work in supporting sectors such as education or research.\nThe UK-wide regulator for nursing is the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), and all nurses and nursing associates must be registered to practise. Dental Nurses, nursery nurses and veterinary nurses are not regulated by the NMC and follow different training, qualifications and career pathways.\nHistory\nRegistration and regulation\nThere are currently two levels of nursing registration in the UK: registered nurses and nursing associates. To practise lawfully as a registered nurse, the practitioner must hold a current and valid registration with the Nursing and Midwifery Council. The title \"registered nurse\" can only be granted to those holding such registration; this protected title is laid down in the Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Act 1979. However, the title \"nurse\" is not legally protected, so anybody can call themselves a nurse. Brent East MP Dawn Butler introduced a bill in Parliament in February 2025 to protect the title of 'nurse'.\nNursing and Midwifery Council\nThe core function of the NMC is to establish and improve standards of nursing and midwifery care to protect the public. It achieves this by placing registered nurses on a register, which anyone can search. As of March 2024, there were 826,418 registered nurses, midwives and nursing associates on the NMC register.\nThe powers of the NMC are set out in the Nursing and Midwifery Order 2001.\nMembership of the council comprises 6 lay and 6 registrant members appointed by the Privy Council, including at least one member from each of the four UK countries. The registrant members consist of nurses, midwives and nursing associates. The lay members currently include people with diplomatic, legal and business backgrounds.\nRegister\nThe NMC register is split into three main parts: Nurses, Midwives and Specialist Community Public Health Nurses (SCPHN). Within the registration it contains several \"sub-parts\" and qualifications e.g. sub part 1, sub part 2.\nRevalidation is a requirement for all NMC registered members to revalidate every three years in order to ensure their registration can be renewed. Revalidation was introduced in April 2016.\nCode of conduct\nThe Professional standards of practice and behaviour for nurses, midwives and nursing associates, known as the Code, was revised in 2018, replacing earlier publications in 2015 and 2008. The NMC code presents the professional standards that nurses, midwives and nursing associates must uphold in order to be registered to practise in the UK.\nLegislation\nGovernment legislation governing nursing in the United Kingdom includes:\n* Health and Care (Staffing) (Scotland) Act 2019\n* Nurse Staffing Levels (Wales) Act 2016\n* Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Act 1997 (repealed)\n* Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Act 1992 (repealed 19 June 1997)\n* Medicinal Products: Prescription by Nurses etc. Act 1992\n* Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Act 1979\n* Nursing Homes Act 1975\n* Nurses Act 1943\n* Royal National Pension Fund for Nurses Act 1936\n* Nurses Registration Act 1919\nEducation\nNon-registered staff education\nTraining is not mandatory for most people undertaking non-registered staff roles such as Healthcare Assistant. But the majority of NHS employers use \"in-house\" training for such staff, including induction programmes and ongoing education to achieve a recognised qualification. Some collaborate with local education colleges for theoretical input, and may award a recognised qualification. Some NHS employers ask for some type of health or social care qualification for recruits: for example, an SVQ/NVQ or HNC/HND under qualification names including health care, social care, and health & social care.\nPre-registration degrees\nProject 2000 began in 1990 and was designed to move nursing education from hospitals into universities. Prior to Project 2000, nurse education was the responsibility of hospitals and was not based in universities; many nurses who qualified prior to these reforms do not hold an academic award.\nFrom 2011, students studying a pre-registration nursing programmes in Scotland were required to complete a degree. Since September 2013 all UK pre-registration nursing programmes are at degree level. Some Higher Education Institutions offer a graduate entry course for nursing. This is for students who have already gained a degree in another subject and want to register as a nurse. It is undertaken over two years. It is also possible to complete nurse registration through the nursing degree apprenticeship route, where students are sponsored by their employer.\nFormat\nNursing courses adopt a 50/50 split of learning in university (lectures and examinations) and in practice (supervised patient care within a hospital or community setting). Nursing courses usually take three years and 4,600 hours.\nThe first year is the common foundation program (CFP), which teaches basic knowledge and skills required of all nurses. Skills include communication, taking observations, administering medication, and providing personal care. The remainder of the program consists of training specific to the student's chosen branch of nursing. The four branches of nursing training offered at university level (not including midwifery) are:\n* Adult nursing\n* Child nursing\n* Mental health nursing\n* Learning disabilities nursing\nMidwifery education\nMidwifery training is similar in length and structure, but is sufficiently different that it is not considered a branch of nursing. 18-month programmes allow nurses already qualified in the adult branch to register as both a nurse and a midwife. Two year courses allow graduates of other disciplines to train as nurses. This is achieved by more intense study and a shortening of the common foundation programme.\nStudent Bursary\nStudent nurses in England and Wales receive no bursary from the government to support them during their nurse training. Diploma students in England receive a universal bursary of £6,000–£8,000 per year (with additional allowances for students with dependent children), while degree students may qualify for a means-tested bursary (often a considerably smaller amount). Degree students are, however, eligible for a student loan, unlike diploma students. Wales, all student nurses (regardless of which course they are undertaking) receive a bursary in line with the English diploma course. In Scotland, nursing students receive a bursary of £10,000 per year. All student nurses in Wales study, initially, for a degree, but may choose to remain at Level 2, thereby achieving a diploma rather than a degree.\nIt was announced in the Chancellor's Spending Review of November 2015 that from 2017 the NHS bursary would be removed for future nursing, midwifery and allied health professionals in England. Welsh and Scottish students remain unaffected.\nPost-registration education\nIn order to remain registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Council nurses in the UK are required to revalidate their registration every three years. Criteria to meet revalidation include having completed 450 hours of practice in the previous three years.\nNurses can add certifications in areas such as cannulation, venepuncture, intravenous drug therapy, and male catheterisation are common among many others, such as Advanced Life Support.\nTo become specialist nurses (such as nurse consultants, nurse practitioners, etc.) or nurse educators, some nurses undertake further training above bachelor's degree level. Master's degrees exist in various healthcare related topics, and some nurses choose to study for PhDs or other higher academic awards. District nurses and health visitors are also considered specialist nurses, and to become such they must undertake specialist training (often in the form of a top-up degree (see above) or post graduate diploma).\nAll newly qualifying district nurses and health visitors prescribe from the Nurse Prescribers' Formulary, a list of medications and dressings. Many of these (and other) nurses undertake training in independent and supplementary prescribing, which allows them to prescribe most drugs in the British National Formulary. This has been the subject of debate in medical and nursing circles. As of 2012, more than 25,000 Nurse Prescribers had been qualified.\nOverseas nurses\nThe Nursing and Midwifery Council has a specific process for inducting Registered Nurses trained outside the UK. Prior to October 2016 an outside UK RN would have to undergo an Overseas Nursing Program known in short as the ONP. The ONP had to be undertaken by the candidate after NMC makes necessary checks and issue the candidate with a decision letter stating that the person may join a university to undertake the ONP.\nHowever, owing to a shortage of nurses and increasing standards in nursing a new process was introduced to include two part test of competence, including an OSCE. The process includes an English language test, the standards of which have been criticised for being too high.\nRoles\nNon-registered staff\nNon-registered staff typically working in direct patient care (often on wards), performing tasks such as personal care (washing and dressing), social care (feeding, communicating to patients and generally spending time with them) and more specialised tasks such as recording observations or vital signs (such as temperature, pulse and respiratory rate, or TPR) or measuring and assessing blood pressure, urinalysis, blood glucose monitoring, pressure sores (see Waterlow score) and carrying out procedures such as catheterisation and cannulation).\nSome unregistered staff work as phlebotomists, ECG technicians, and smoking cessation therapists beyond the hospital. Others expand their ward-based role to include such tasks. Few areas of nursing cannot be legally performed by suitably trained non-registered staff. They legally must be supervised (either directly or indirectly) by a registered nurse.\nIn 2019, it was reported that mental health support workers were increasingly covering shifts because of the shortage of mental health nurses.\nNon-registered staff have various job titles such as \"clinical support worker\", \"care assistant\", \"nursing assistant\" and \"healthcare assistant\" (HCA). Typically they are on NHS Agenda for Change (AfC) pay band 2 and progress to band 3 pay after further training.\nRegistered nurses\nRegistered nurses traditionally qualify as a staff nurse on a ward, although it is increasingly common for newly-qualified nurses to enter an area such as community nursing directly. From there, nurses can progress into leadership and management roles such as ward sisters or matrons, or specialise in areas such as community nursing or advanced practice.\nSpecialist nurses and advanced practice\nSpecialist roles can include clinical nurse specialists, who may run clinics and provide specialist nursing support to wards, or specialist community public health nurses (SCPHNs) such as health visitors. SCPHNs form a separate part of the NMC register.\nAdvanced nursing practitioners, sometimes known as advanced clinical practitioners, normally study a postgraduate qualification and take on a more medical role. They are the equivalent of nurse practitioners elsewhere. As of 2025, the NMC is consulting on how to effectively regulate\nNursing organisations and trade unions\nAs of 2024, more than 200 organisations are related to nursing as regulated by the Nursing and Midwifery Council, not including nursing departments in universities or in the NHS. These include professional bodies, nursing specialties, charities, and migrant support networks.\nFour trade unions represent nurses: the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), Unite the Union, UNISON and GMB. The RCN has a dual role as both a professional body and a trade union.\nWorkforce\nDemographics\nThe Nursing and Midwifery Council report on registration data twice a year (April and September).\nThe majority of the nursing profession are women at around 90% of the total workforce. In September 2023, 43.5 percent of the ~800,000 registered nurses and midwives were aged 21–40; the average age of registrants was 43 years, 10 months. The increase in the number of 21–40 year olds was partly owing to the international joiners to the register, with an increase to 29.1 percent of all registered professionals from Black and minority ethnic backgrounds. 49.9% of new joiners were educated outside the UK\nAs at September 2023 601,805 of registrants were Adult Nurses; 58,338 were Children's Nurses; 97,530 were Mental Health Nurses; and 16,806 were Learning Disability Nurses\nWorkforce planning\nIn England, Health Education England commission undergraduate and postgraduate education. This is an autonomous national body which works to \"ensure that healthcare staff are recruited in the right numbers with the right values and behaviours to support the delivery of excellent healthcare and drive improvement\". The number of commissioned places for nurses has varied year on year, as follows:\nAdult nursing education places commissioned each year\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!2009/10\n!2010/11\n!2011/12\n!2012/13\n!2013/14\n!2014/15\n|-\n|14,451\n|13,628\n|11,930\n|11,416\n|12,134\n|\n|}\nNursing shortages\nMore than a third of nurses in training fail to complete the training course, as has been the case for more than a century.\nIn January 2016 the RCN stated that more than 10,000 nursing posts went unfilled in 2015. This represented a 3% increase year on year from 11% in 2013, 14% in 2014 and 17% in 2015 of all London nursing positions and 10% as an average nationwide. The Department of Health said it did not recognise the figures. The National Audit Office estimated a shortfall of 7% in the supply of nurses. From 2016/17 registered nursing numbers fell 3% along with a 23% rise in de-registrations. 17,000 nurse permanently unfilled vacancies were observed. In 2019, clinical pharmacology, spinal injuries, paediatric surgery, neurosurgery and neurology were the worst-affected specialities. They had an average of less than 90% of their planned nurse staffing levels.\nSchool nurses were also in short supply.\nHospitals in England are required to report the number of nurses employed on each ward each month. After this was established, ward nurses increased by 13,500, although the numbers of community nurses declined.\nMigration\nA 2015 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development survey reported that 21.7% of NHS nurses were born abroad, compared with 26.9% in Ireland, 9.8% in Italy, 14% in Germany and 5.9% in France. The UK was also the highest exporter of nurses, with more than 50,000 working in other OECD nations. The Migration Advisory Committee criticised the Department of Health, Health Education England, and NHS trusts for not recognising obvious warning signs and \"reluctantly\" agreed to keep nursing on the list of shortage occupations.\nAn English language test is compulsory for all foreign nurses, even if they are from English-speaking countries. The process of registering as a nurse can take migrants up to a year and cost more than £3,000.\nNurse health\nObesity and smoking have long been an issue in nurse health. The effect of nursing on nurses' physical and mental health has been a subject of research papers where the effect of shift work and working with chemicals such as in chemotherapy has been explored. In 2016, the government announced £600&nbsp;million was to be spent on \"tackling obesity and improving the well-being of its 1.3&nbsp;million staff\".\nCompensation\nUntil October 2004, all nurses in the NHS were employed on a scale known as clinical grading (see below). Agenda for Change was developed by the NHS in response to criticisms that the old scale reflected length of service more than knowledge, responsibility and skills.\nClinical grading\nThis was known as the Whitley Council system. This placed nurses (and some other hospital staff) on \"grades\" between A and I (with A being the most junior, and I the most senior). Unregistered staff were employed on grades A and B (occasionally grade C). Second level nurses were employed on various grades (usually between C and E), with first level nurses taking up grades D-I.\nAgenda for Change\nThis NHS system puts registered staff on bands 4–9, unregistered staff such as Healthcare Assistants take up bands 2–3. Above band 9 posts are for very management (VSM's) and pay is negotiated locally with each employer. Other than band 2, each band contains a number of pay points that employees reach depending on the number of years worked in each band. For example, in band 3, after two years an employee will be paid a higher rate.\nThe idea of this system is \"equal pay for work of equal value\". There was a perceived discrepancy, under clinical grading, between ones grade (and therefore pay) and the work which one actually did, which Agenda for Change aimed to fix. Most NHS staff are now on the AfC system which took quite a long time to implement across the UK. A small percentage of staff went through an appeal procedure as they disagreed with the band that they have been placed on.\nIn 2015–16, the minimum starting salary for a registered nurse was £21,692 in England, Wales while in Scotland it was £21,818. , Northern Ireland was yet to announce their pay rates for 2015–16.\nNHS Pay Review Body (NHSPRB)\nThe NHS Pay Review Body is an independent body that makes recommendations to the government on the pay of nurses and NHS staff. The government then makes the final decision.\nIn 2014, the government rejected the NHSPRB recommendation for a 1% pay rise.\nIn 2016, the government announced that nurses would receive a 1% pay rise which would take effect from 1 April 2016. The RCN Chief Executive Janet Davies stated that \"The fact remains that pay awards for NHS staff have been severely constrained since 2010\".\nPay disputes\nThere have recently been complaints of Agenda for Change being a sexist system, as nurses, who are mostly female, claim that, as a profession, they are under-valued using this system. In 2015, the RCN stated that Nurses had suffered a drop in pay equivalent to 9.8% in real terms since 2008.\nAgency Nurse Pay Cap\nIn 2015, the government announced that there would be a gradual introduction of pay caps for agency nurses working under NHS England. Starting in November 2015, further caps came in February 2016 with the final cuts introduced in April 2016. The aim of the cap was to save £1bn over three years. The implications of the pay cap means that trusts will not be able to pay staff who work for an agency including doctors and nurses, more than 55% more for a shift than a permanent member of staff. Jeremy Hunt in his capacity as the Health Secretary said it would stop agencies \"ripping off the NHS\". In response a petition started on the government website which received more than 10,000 responses.\nNurses finance situation\nIn 2016, several publications appeared in the media, claiming nurses depend on food banks and payday loans to survive. In October 2016, Western Circle published research, claiming that the sector of NHS Nurses are heavily dependent on payday loan. According to the research, the number of nurses using payday loans has doubled in 3 years, since 2013. This research brought the matter of the low wages nurses received in the UK to the attention of media outlets. The claims were that nurses' salaries were frozen for more than 6 years and in some cases, resulted in financial distress, clearly as wages have not kept pace with the cost of living increases in this time. The lack of pay increases for, particularly nurses within the NHS continues to be an important topic of public discussion in the UK.\nNursing journals\nAs at 2023 British nursing journal titles included:\n* British Journal of Cardiac Nursing\n* British Journal of Community Nursing\n* British Nursing Index\n* Cancer Nursing Practice\n* Nursing Times\n* Nursing Standard\n* Emergency Nurse\n* Evidence-Based Nursing (journal)\n* Gastrointestinal Nursing\n* Learning Disability Practice\n* Mental Health Practice\n* Nurse Researcher\n* Nursing Children and Young People\n* Nursing in Practice\n* Nursing Management (journal)\n* Nursing Older People\n* Nursing Standard\n* Nursing Times\n* Primary Health Care (magazine)\nGovernment publications\nSignificant government publications on nursing and midwifery include:\n* Athlone Report Ministry of Health and Board of Education Interim Report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Nursing Services – nursing recruitment, retention and skills 1939\n* Nurses Salaries Committee or Rushcliffe Report was established in October 1941 and published two reports in 1943. was the first official body to fix salary scales and conditions for nursing in England.\n* Ministry of Health, Department of Health for Scotland, and Ministry of Labour and National Service (Wood Committee) 1947 Report of the Working Party on the Recruitment and Training of Nurses - a government report on the recruitment and training of nurse\n* Salmon Report on Senior Nursing Staff Structure 1966\n* Mayston Report on Management Structure in the Local Authority Nursing Services 1969\n* Briggs Report of the Committee on Nursing in the United Kingdom, 1972 which reviewed the role of nurses and midwives in hospitals and in community care.
