Rajeswaran practiced as a Advocate in all fields of law in the Madras High Court. Later, he was directly elevated as a judge of the Madras High Court.\nImportant cases\nMexico Child Case\nS. Rajeswaran, as a sitting Judge of Madurai Bench of Madras High Court, had dealt with a case involving the custody of a 5-year-old child from Mexico. The father of the child (who was a Mexican working as a professor in a private Educational Institution at Krishnankoil, Tamil Nadu) was charged for murdering the mother of the child and disposed the body in a suitcase. The murder took place as the result of the dispute over the custody of the child. S. Rajeswaran, ordered that the child should be handed over to the Mexican Embassy at New Delhi and then the child should be sent to Mexico and monitored by the Mexican Embassy until it is handed over to the appropriate guardian as ordered by the Mexican court.\nJallikattu Agitation\nFollowing the protests demanding Jallikattu, Madras High Court Judge S. Rajeswaran was appointed by the Government of Tamil Nadu to inquire the violence took place during the protest. Cases were registered against those who took part in the agitation at Madurai. A total of 179 protesters who took part in the protests were charged under various sections of Law.  Police have registered cases against 179 protesters, out of 179 protesters, 64 were from Alanganallur, 54 protesters in the Sellur protest, 34 in the Perungkudi protest and 27 in the Tilakar Thidal protest.\nA commission headed by Justice S. Rajeswaran was appointed to inquire into the incidents of violence. The names of the 179 people in the cases are not just from Madurai. At most, young people studying and working in 20 districts came here and took part in the Protest. They were unable to attend the ongoing trial in every court. Only if all 179 people gather for the trial then only the trial will continue. But it seems impossible to gather all of them at a single place for the trial. They have had to travel long distances and time for the end of the cases.\nReferences"
