In August 1508, he was appointed to the newly created office of Surveyor of the King's Prerogative. This office gave him the power to appropriate the lands and property of anyone who had violated the king's prerogative in some way, such as conviction for a felony. Additionally, the king instructed Belknap to collect debts that were owing to the Crown, as well as fines which the king himself often assessed for breaches of the law. Belknap's appointment was part of an effort by Henry VII to improve the royal finances. Belknap was a privy councillor for both Henry VII and Henry VIII. In 1520, he was most probably at the Field of the Cloth of Gold with Henry VIII.\nHis heir and daughter Elizabeth married Thomas Bishopp whose son became Sir Thomas Bishopp, 1st Baronet of Parham.\nReferences\nSources\n* }}\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150402141324/https://histfam.familysearch.org//getperson.php?personID=I32783&tree=Nixon Sir Edward Belknap, Knight] Family tree\n* [https://www.belnapfamily.org/siredwardbelknap.htm Sir Edward Belknap]"
