The interior contains some 18th century funerary monuments, which Pevsner considers as \"very grand\" for their modest setting and a set of panelled box pews and pulpit.\nThe church was lightly restored in 1870. The organ dates from 1917 and was a gift of  Mary Earle Gwynne of Folkington, in memory of the men of the village who died in World War I. It remains as an active parish church.\nThe graveyard contains the grave of the cookery writer Elizabeth David, marked by a slate headstone carved in 1992 by the local stonemason Geoffrey Aldred.\nJust inside the door, on the left-hand side wall is a small stone relief sculpture commissioned by the family of Ronald Stacy Marks, by John Skelton (sculptor).\nArchitecture and description\nThe church is constructed of flint and rubble. The bell turret is weatherboarded with a \"shingled spirelet\". The building is listed Grade I.\nNotes\nReferences\n*"
