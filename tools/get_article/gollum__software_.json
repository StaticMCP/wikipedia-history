It started life as the wiki system used by the GitHub web hosting system. Although the open source Gollum project and the software currently used to run GitHub wikis have diverged from one another, Gollum strives to maintain compatibility with the latter.  Currently used by GitLab to store and interconnect wiki-pages with wiki-links; a complete move away from Gollum is planned for the future.\nFormats supported\nGollum wikis are simply Git repositories that adhere to a specific format. Gollum pages may be written in a variety of formats including Markdown, AsciiDoc, ReStructuredText, Creole and MediaWiki markup.\nFeatures\n* YAML Frontmatter for controlling per-page settings\n* UML diagrams via PlantUML\n* BibTeX and citation support (when using Pandoc for rendering)\n* Annotations using CriticMarkup\n* Mathematics via MathJax\n* Macros\n* Redirects\n* Support for right-to-left languages\nEditing\nEditing the pages can be done via the provided web interface, via its API or with a text editor directly in the Git repository.\nSee also\n* ikiwiki – Also uses a version control system to store pages\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki Documentation]"
