The sheriff had judicial, electoral, ceremonial and administrative functions and executed High Court Writs. In 1908, an Order in Council made the Lord-Lieutenant the Sovereign's prime representative in a county and reduced the High Sheriff's precedence. However, the sheriff retained his responsibilities for the preservation of law and order in the county. The usual procedure for appointing the sheriff from 1660 onwards was that three persons were nominated at the beginning of each year from the county and the Lord Lieutenant then appointed his choice as High Sheriff for the remainder of the year. Often the other nominees were appointed as under-sheriffs. Sometimes a sheriff did not fulfil his entire term through death or other event and another sheriff was then appointed for the remainder of the year. The dates given hereunder are the dates of appointment. All addresses are in Queen's County (County Laois) unless stated otherwise.\nHigh Sheriffs of Queen's County\n*1579: Robert Bowen of Ballyadams\n*1593: Terence O'Dempsey, 1st Viscount Clanmalier\n*1623: Barnaby or Brian Oge Dunn of Brittas\n*1627: Sir Walter Crosbie, 1st Baronet\n*1637: Gerald Fitzgerald of Tymogue and Moret and Loughcurran\n*1639: Edward Brereton\n*1663: Thomas Pigott of Capard\n*1676: Samuel Preston of Emo\n*1677: Edward Brereton\n*1689: Sir Gregory Byrne, 1st Baronet\n*1704: Gerald Fitzgerald of Coolanowle\n*1712: Robert Pigott of Capard\n*1719: Edmond Butler\n*1732: Lewis Moore I\n*1736: Lewis Moore of Cremorgan\n*1753: Sir John Parnell\nGeorge III, 1760–1820\n*1760: Lewis Moore II of Durrow\n*1763: Stephen Cassan of Sheffield House\n*1764:\n*1772: Richard Croasdaile of Rynn\n*1773:\n*1779: Stewart Weldon\n*1780: John Brereton\n*1782: Jonathan Chetwode of Woodbrook\n*1782: John Adair of Rath\n*1783: Matthew Cassan of Sheffield House\n*1784: Henry Moore of Cremorgan\n*1785: Thomas Fitz-Gerald of Corbolly\n*1786:\n*1787:\n*1790: Edward Dunne of Brittas\n*1791: Charles Henry Coote of Forest Lodge\n*1792: Sir John Allen Johnson, 1st Baronet, later Sir John Allen Johnson-Walsh, 1st Baronet\n*1794: John or George Hartpole\n*1795: Joshua Kemmis of Knightstown\n*1799: Thomas Murray Prior (1773–1854)\n*1800: Sir Erasmus Dixon Borrowes, 6th Baronet\n*1801: Richard Warburton of Garryhinch\n*1802:\n*1804: Coghran Palmer\n*1805: John Bland\n*1806: Robert Laurenson\n*1807: Gilbert fitz Gerald\n*1808: Sir George Pigott\n*1809: Thomas Cosby of Stradbally Hall\n*1810: Frederick Thompson\n*1811: Lancelot Croasdaile of Rynn\n*1812: John Alien Johnston-Walsh\n*1813: Hon Lord Sidney Osborne\n*1814: Lord Henry Seymour Moore\n*1815: Charles White of Charleville\n*1816: James White of Aghavoe\n*1817: Sir Walter Dixon Borrowes, 7th Baronet\n*1818: Robert White of Old Park (Grantston Manor)\n*1819: Sir Robert Staples\n*1820: Hugh Aldborough-Bowen\nGeorge IV, 1820–1830\n*1821: Pierce Moore\n*1822: George Adair of Rath\n*1823: Hon.
