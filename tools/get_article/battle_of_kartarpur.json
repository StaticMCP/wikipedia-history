It started when the Mughal Empire attacked the town of Kartarpur. The Mughal force was repulsed by the Sikh defenders. The battle occurred in the locality of Kartarpur in present-day Jalandhar district of Indian Punjab.\nEvents\nPainda (or Painde) Khan, ex-general of the Sikh troops, convinced Shah Jahan to send a force against Guru Hargobind in Kartarpur. The expedition was commanded by Kale Khan, the governor of Peshwar whose brother Mukhlis Khan was killed by Guru Hargobind in the Battle of Amritsar (1634). He was joined by Qutub Khan, (Qutab or Kutub, the faujdar of Jalandhar) Kohja Anwar, and Painda.\nQutub sent Anwar Khan with gifts to Guru Hargobind which were rejected. Anwar challenged Hargobind to a game of chaupar. After being defeated, Anwar insulted the Guru's predecessors, and in return was beaten and sent away.\nKartarpur was defended by Bhai Bidhi Chand with Guru Hargobind and his eldest son Baba Gurdita supporting him.\nAftermath\nAfter the battle, Sri Guru Hargobind Sahib travelled to Giractpur (Kirtapur) via Bhawarati (Phagwara). At Palahi village near Phagwara, he was set upon by royal forces under Ahmad Khan, and suffered considerable losses. He remained in Kiratpur until his death.\nOn the Sikh side, Bhatt Fateh Chand and Bhatt Amir Chand (sons of Dharma Bhatt and grandsons of Bhoja Bhatt) were killed in battle.\nReferences\n}}"
