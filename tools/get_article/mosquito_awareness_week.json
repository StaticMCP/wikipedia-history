Mosquito Awareness Week is observed annually in late June. A separate Caribbean Mosquito Awareness Week (CARPA) is held earlier in the year, typically in April or May.\nMosquito Awareness Week raises awareness of diseases spread by mosquitoes, including dengue fever, chikungunya, Zika, yellow fever, and malaria. It aims to reduce mosquito breeding and encourage people to take preventative measures to avoid mosquito bites.\nHistory\nMosquito Awareness Week began in 2016 in response to the 2015 - 2016 Zika outbreak.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=12355:cde-mosquito-awareness-week&Itemid=42087&lang=en Pan American Health Organization]\n* [https://www.cdc.gov/features/stopmosquitoes/index.html Prevent Mosquito Bites - CDC]"
