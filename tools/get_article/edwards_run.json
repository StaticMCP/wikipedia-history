The stream is located in Hampshire County in the U.S. state of West Virginia's Eastern Panhandle. Edwards Run is named for Joseph Edwards and his family, whose plantation encompassed most of the stream's course. George Washington surveyed his property in the late 1740s. It is a major source of various species of elodea.\nHeadwaters and course\nThe source of Edwards Run lies between Cooper (2,028&nbsp;ft) and Schaffenaker (1,493&nbsp;ft) Mountains, southwest of Capon Bridge. Edwards Run flows northeast under the Northwestern Turnpike (U.S. Route 50) continuing to follow the western side of Schaffenaker Mountain. Edwards Run then flows through the Edwards Run Wildlife Management Area where it is dammed creating the  lake, Edwards Pond. The stream flows under Cold Stream Road (County Route 15) and into the Cacapon River south of Cold Stream.\nFishing\nEdwards Pond provides fishing for bass, sunfish, bluegill and channel catfish. Edwards Run and Pond are also stocked with trout February through March and in October.\nSee also\n*List of West Virginia rivers\nReferences\nExternal links"
