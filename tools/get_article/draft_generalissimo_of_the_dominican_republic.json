The title was created in 1934 by President Rafael Trujillo after promoting himself to the rank of Generalissimo of the Army. As the de facto leader of the country, the Generalissimo held the real power behind-the-scenes and would appoint ceremonial presidents.\nOnly two people served as Generalissimo, Rafael and his son, Ramfis. Ramfis took office after his father's assassination of his father in May 1961 and held it until in November of that year where Ramfis and his family were forced into exile by then-President Joaquín Balaguer.\nList of Generalissimos\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Portrait\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Name\n! colspan=\"3\" |Term of office\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\" | Took office\n!Left office\n!Time in office\n|-\n! 1\n|\n| Rafael Trujillo\n| 16 August 1934\n| 30 May 1961\n|\n|-\n! 2\n|\n|Ramfis Trujillo\n| 30 May 1961\n| 17 November 1961\n|\n|}\nReferences"
