Wheeler was the first professional African American librarian in Durham County and the second librarian of the Stanford L. Warren Library. The Stanford L. Warren Library was the second public library for African Americans in North Carolina. Under Wheeler's leadership the collections, programs, and space of the Stanford L. Warren Library were expanded as the institution became a thriving community center.\nEarly Life and Education\nSelena Lucille Warren was born December 28, 1911 to Dr. Stanford L. Warren and Julia McCauley Warren. Dr. Warren was a prominent physician, businessman, and leader in Durham's Black community including Hayti and Black Wall Street. Julia McCauley Warren opened Durham's first beauty salon as the city's first beautician and hair stylist.\nWheeler attended Hillside High School in Durham and graduated from Howard University in 1932 where she was later initiated in the Alpha Chapter of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority in 1934. Upon her return to Durham, Wheeler had been accepted into law school and planned to become a lawyer. In late 1932 Wheeler was asked to lead the library when Hattie B. Wooten fell ill. Wooten was the first librarian and initially the only employee of the Durham Colored Library and under her leadership the library became a central institution for Durham's Black community. Wheeler's temporary position at the library inspired her to pursue a career in librarianship. In 1934 Wheeler returned to Durham with her B.S. in Library Science from Hampton Institute, now Hampton University.\nLibrarian of the Stanford L. Warren Library\nDuring her tenure as head librarian, Wheeler extended library services to rural populations. This initiative was achieved through Wheeler and her assistant, Luvenia C. Hicks, utilizing their cars to transport books to rural communities. In 1941 the Board of Trustees agreed to purchase a bookmobile and in 1942 the bookmobile made its first trip. The library's bookmobile, initially driven by Wheeler, contained 600 books and traversed 575 miles of countryside each month. Additionally, Wheeler extended library services by establishing deposit stations at four Durham county schools in 1940.\nA consequence of the extension and expansion efforts was also the need of a larger building to combat overcrowding. The Board resolved to build a new library in 1939 and the building opened in 1940. The Durham Colored Library was renamed the Stanford L. Warren Library in honor of its primary benefactor. The new library included a Children's Room, and under Wheeler's direction Saturday Morning Story Hour began in 1940. The initiative was so successful that the library sponsored a Story Telling Institute the next year.\nWheeler expanded collections with an increase of 11,000 catalogued volumes and designated a collection of prominent and influential African American literature to be a special, non-circulating collection at the Stanford L. Warren Library. Under the direction of Wheeler the library flourished into a vibrant community center. Wheeler resigned from the public library in 1945.\nPersonal Life and Life After the Public Library\nSelena Warren married John Hervey Wheeler in 1935. John Hervey Wheeler was a prominent banker, businessman, and civil rights leader in Durham. Selena and John Wheeler had two children, Julia Wheeler Taylor and Warren Hervey Taylor.\nWheeler served on the Stanford L. Warren Board of Trustees from 1946-1966 and the Durham County Library Board from 1978-1985. Wheeler worked as a Durham County School System librarian from 1955 until her retirement in 1970. Following her retirement she became the secretary-treasurer of her son's business Wheeler Flying Service and Wheeler Airlines until 1994. Through this position Wheeler enabled over thirty Black pilots to fly for major U.S. airlines and mentored the first four African American female pilots to fly for major airlines. Selena Lucille Warren Wheeler died on July 18, 2014 at 102.\nReferences"
