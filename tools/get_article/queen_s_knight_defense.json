The move 1...Nc6 is a fairly committal move which blocks Black's c-pawn; usually Black delays playing it until White's setup is clear.\nMost games featuring 1.d4 Nc6 transpose to other openings. After 2.e4 the Nimzowitsch Defense arises. After 2.Nf3 d5 a variation of the Queen's Pawn Game is possible. After 2.c4 d5 the opening is a Chigorin Defense.\nThere are some lines that are unique to 1.d4 Nc6, most importantly 2.d5 which chases the knight away, usually to e5. The opening resembles an Alekhine's Defence but on the opposite side of the board. In an opening book by Sid Pickard, this variation was called the Bozo-Indian Defense (\"Bozo\" being a combination of the prefixes \"Nimzo\" and \"Bogo\").\nThe Queen's Knight Defense was featured (although not mentioned by name) in the season four episode of Chuck entitled \"Chuck Versus the Family Volkoff\".\nTranspositions\nAfter 1.d4 Nc6 Black should be ready for various continuations; however, White cannot just ignore the fact that his opponent is ready to play ...e5 in the next move. Therefore, practically speaking, White is more likely to limit himself to the move 2.Nf3, trying to reach a position where he has a theoretical advantage. Black could respond to Nf3 with two main moves:\n*2...d6 can transpose to the Pirc Defense (if Black successfully plays d6 and g6, White must play e4 and go into open games theory) or the King's Indian Defence if White plays an early c4 and goes into closed games theory. Unusual sequences after 2.Nf3 d6:\n**Dutch Defence – 3.g3 g6 4.Bg2 Bg7 5.0-0 f5 6.d5\n**Ruy Lopez – 3.e4 e5 4.Bb5 exd4 5.Qxd4\n*2...e6 can transpose to the Nimzo-Indian Defence, Bogo-Indian Defence and the Chigorin Defense if White plays c4 immediately. If White tries going for an open game, the game can transpose to a Guimard French or another French line with 4...e5, or the Nimzowitsch Defence.\nIllustrative games\nErich Weinitschke vs. Efim Bogoljubov, Bad Elster, Germany, 1938 [Analysis by Sid Pickard]\n'''}}\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*"
