It features the song \"...Long Time Ago\" which played over the ending credits of The Shield's series finale.\nWalking in London peaked at number 18 on the Australian ARIA Charts.\nMusic\nCritic Tom Demalon of AllMusic described the album as \"a good record but not nearly as pleasing as its breakthrough predecessor\" (1990's Bloodletting), but notes certain exceptional tracks: \"Ghost of a Texas Ladies' Man\", \"Someday?\", \"Long Time Ago\", and \"the gorgeous ballad 'Les Cœurs Jumeaux'\". In The New Yorker, Elizabeth Wurtzel offered particular praise for the cover of James Brown's \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\" and its \"ironic interpretation that emphasizes the second half of the chorus – the part that says 'But it wouldn't mean nothing without a woman or a girl' – and turns Brown's misogyny into a feminist anthem.\"\n\"Ghost of a Texas Ladies' Man\" was released as a single.\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Johnette Napolitano, except where noted.\nPersonnel\nMusicians:\n* Bernadette Colomine –\tvocals, voices\n* James Mankey – guitar\n* Johnette Napolitano – bass, vocals\n* Tom Petersson – bass\n* Andy Prieboy – vocals\n* Harry Rushakoff – percussion, drums\nProduction:\n* Erich Baron – assistant engineer\n* Sean Freehill – assistant engineer\n* John Golden – mastering\n* John Jackson – mixing assistant\n* Earle Mankey – engineer, mixing\n* Chris Marshall – engineer, assistant engineer\n* Annie Sperling – art direction, photography\n* Chris Tsangarides – producer\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1992)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak position\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
