KCD is the oldest college affiliated to Karnataka University, Dharwad.\nHistory\nKarnataka College was founded in June 1917 by Diwan Bahadur Rodda Srinivasaray and Rao Bahadur R. C. Aratal Rudragoudar, with the aim of setting up an educational institution in the region so that students did not need to travel to Bombay or Pune for their studies. Sir. Siddappa Kambli, then the Minister of Education for the Government of Bombay, played a significant role in and was in charge of ensuring that Karnatak College kept offering instruction in the North Karnataka region. The college started with Arts and Science streams, and later other streams like Commerce and Economics were added. The college was later bifurcated for administration purposes as the Karnatak Arts College and Karnatak Science College, though both continue in the same campus and share the amenities.\nOriginally, it belonged to University of Mumbai.
