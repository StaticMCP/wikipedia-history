He was the son of King Huanhui, whom he succeeded to the Han throne.\nIn 233 BC, Han An sent Han Fei to the Qin state to request to be a vassal. However, Han Fei was executed. In 231 BC, Han An offered Nanyang (南陽), an area around modern-day Mount Wangwu, to Qin. In the 9th month of the same year, Qin sent Metropolitan Superintendent (内史) Teng (騰) to receive the area.\nIn 230 BC, Qin sent Teng to attack the Han state. Han An was captured and the Han state ceased to exist. Qin then created Yingchuan Commandery from the conquered Han territory.\nIn 226 BC, ex-Han nobility launched a failed rebellion, and Han An died the same year.\nAncestors\nReferences"
