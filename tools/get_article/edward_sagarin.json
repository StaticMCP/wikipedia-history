His book The Homosexual in America: A Subjective Approach, published in 1951, was considered \"one of the most influential works in the history of the gay rights movement\", and inspired compassion in others by highlighting the difficulties faced by homosexuals.\nHe was titled \"father of the homophile movement\" for asserting that gay men and lesbians deserved civil rights as members of a large, unrecognised minority. However, Vern L. Bullough believes the title is undeserved as Sagarin did not actively participate in resistance and did not join any homophile organisations until 1962, a time when he was seeking a topic to analyse in his thesis.Bullough, Vern L. (2002) New York: Harrington Park Press.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=A7x_VnES2esC&dq=edward+sagarin+biography&pg=PA342 Before Stonewall: Activists for Gay and Lesbian Rights in Historical Context]\nBiography\nEarly life\nSagarin was born in Schenectady, New York, to Russian Jewish parents. Sagarin was born with scoliosis, which produced a hump on his back. He attended high school  and, after graduating, spent a year in France where he met André Gide. Upon his return to New York, he enrolled at City College of New York, but was forced to drop out of college due to the Great Depression.\nIn 1934, Sagarin met Gertrude Liphshitz, a woman who shared his left-wing political interests. They married in 1936 and soon after, Gertrude gave birth to a boy. Sagarin established himself in the perfume and cosmetics industry, becoming knowledgeable about the chemistry of perfumes, and publishing The Science and Art of Perfumery in 1945.\nDonald Webster Cory\nSagarin began a dual life, publishing The Homosexual in America: A Subjective Approach in 1951, which was deemed an \"act of heroism\", under the pseudonym of Donald Webster Cory. The use of the pen name, and the attitudes that differed when Sagarin used either of his identities, led to the comparison of Sagarin/Cory to the Dr. Jekyll/Mr Hyde character. Mr. Cory, who presented homosexuals as a despised minority, was seen as a \"mythic hero\", where Dr. Sagarin (as he would later be known) was a \"hunchback deviant\".Sears, James T. (2006) New York: Harrington Park Press.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=7cJgYcce7SgC&dq=edward+sagarin+biography&pg=PA529 Behind the Mask of the Mattachine]\nThe publication of the book was considered a \"radical step\", as it was the first publication in the United States that discussed homosexual politics and sympathetically presented the plight of homosexuals.Mark Blasius & Shane Phelan (1997) New York: Routledge.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hsw22TEOS80C&dq=Donald+Webster+Cory&pg=PA275 We are Everywhere: A Historical Sourcebook of Gay and Lesbian Politics]  Sagarin described how homosexuals were discriminated against in almost all aspects of their lives and called for a repeal of anti-homosexuality laws;\nOne great gap separates the homosexual minority from all others, and that is its lack of recognition, its lack of respectability in the eyes of the public, and even in the most advanced circles.\nA research report by Alfred Kinsey et al., Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (1948), had a beneficial effect on the reception of Sagarin's publication. In 1952, due to the success of The Homosexual in America: A Subjective Approach, Sagarin established a subscription book service called \"Cory Book Service\", which chose a gay-themed literary work each month. The Cory Book Service played a fundamental role in sparking the gay-rights movement in the US and helped other organizations such as the Mattachine Society and ONE magazine grow. It would change ownership multiple times and would send out recommendations of queer literature for 17 years.\nSagarin continued using his pseudonym, and released a second publication in 1953 called Twenty-One Variations on a Theme, an anthology of short stories dealing with homosexuality to which included pieces by Sherwood Anderson, Paul Bowles, Christopher Isherwood, Denton Welch, Charles Jackson, and Stefan Zweig.\n1960s\nIn 1958, Sagarin joined Brooklyn College, completing his BA in an accelerated program, and in 1961 he entered an MA program in sociology, where he wrote a thesis on The Anatomy of Dirty Words. Throughout the 1960s, Cory remained one of the most conservative members of the Mattachine Society, and opposed the rejection of the \"sickness theory\" of homosexuality by some homophile leaders. His belief was that homosexuality was \"a disturbance\" that probably arose as a result of a pathological family situation.\nAround this time, Sagarin met Barry Sheer, a student at Fairleigh Dickinson University and author for the gay press under the pseudonym John LeRoy. The two began a sexual relationship which Sheer would later compare to the book Death in Venice; Sheer admired Sagarin's writing, and Sagarin gave Sheer monetary gifts. In 1963, Sagarin and Sheer co-authored The Homosexual and His Society, which claimed that there was no such thing as a \"well adjusted homosexual\".\nIn 1965 as Cory, he failed in his bid for presidency of the Mattachine Society. The loss of the presidency, and his difference in beliefs from other members of the Society, resulted in a disparity that directly influenced his education. Sagarin entered New York University's PhD program in sociology, graduating in 1966, submitting a dissertation titled \"Structure and Ideology in an Association of Deviants\", which was a study of the Mattachine Society. He did not, however, reveal his involvement in the society as Cory. His acceptance of the position of assistant professor at Baruch College, a campus of City University of New York, led some to characterise it as the beginning of his rise to \"giant in the field of sociological deviance\" and the recession of his part in the homophile movement.\n1970s\nIn the 1970s, Sagarin pursued an active homosexual life, though he continued to characterise homosexuals as disturbed, and frequently urged them to seek therapy. He rejected the idea that homosexuality was a natural sexual variant, and criticised the new psychological and sociological studies of Evelyn Hooker and John Gagnon. However, he argued that homosexuality should be decriminalized.\nThe real identity of Sagarin's persona, Donald Webster Cory, remained unknown until a 1974 convention of the American Sociological Association in Montreal. On a panel entitled \"Theoretical Perspectives on Homosexuality\", Sagarin levelled criticism at the liberationist scholarship, and in response, Laud Humphreys exposed Sagarin by calling him \"Mr. Cory\". After the convention, Sagarin withdrew from issues concerning homosexuality.\nOn June 10, 1986, he died of a heart attack. At the time, he was serving as Dean Of The Graduate School Of The John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City.\nLiterary works\nEdward Sagarin\n*The Science and Art of Perfumery (1945) New York, London: McGraw-Hill Book Company, Inc.\n*The anatomy of dirty words (1962) New York: L.
