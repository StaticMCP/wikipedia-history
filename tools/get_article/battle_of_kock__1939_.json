It took place between October 2, 1939, and October 5, 1939, near the town of Kock in Poland. The Polish Independent Operational Group Polesie, led by General Franciszek Kleeberg, fought the German XIV Motorized Corps, which were led by General Gustav Anton von Wietersheim.\nPre-battle context\n]]\nAlthough Polish forces had formed a coherent defensive strategy, rapid German advances combined with the Soviet invasion led to great disorganization within the Polish's plans. Additionally, Poland also suffered from a lack of trained officers, leading to many formations in the plan not being fully mobilized before the German invasion. Units stationed in Northern Poland, particularly near East Prussia suffered heavy losses and were forced to retreat south and southeast, in hopes of regrouping and establishing positions along natural barriers such as the Vistula and San rivers.\nOther units attempted to withdraw towards areas east of the Vistula, such as Lublin and Sandomierz. The rapid German advance, however, often disrupted communications and caused such retreats to be chaotic and fragmented. By the time in which Polish forces reached Lublin, their numbers were significantly diminished, greatly limiting their abilities to offer effective resistance. In the meantime, German forces advanced beyond the Vistula, moving in the direction of towns such as Zamość. To the east, Soviet forces enter Polish territory on September 17, occupying cities such as Volodymyr-Volynskyi.\nTo the south, armies stationed around cities such as Kraków and Małopolska (lesser Poland) were defeated by the Wehrmacht Army Group South before being able to enter the San River line, thus preventing any coordinated defense formations in the region. During these events, Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły served as the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Armed Forces during the campaign, while General Franciszek Kleeberg, who commanded Army Area IX and later organized the Independent Operational Group Polesie, was responsible for the defense of the eastern front between Pińsk and Brześć.\nGroup organization\nOn September 8, 1939, General Kleeberg received orders from Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły to organize a division of infantry from the depot division (a depot was where reserve soldiers and recruits were trained). General Kleeberg was also ordered to organize a defensive line from Brześć to Pińsk. While his forces were well-trained, they lacked heavy equipment as they had previously been dispatched to the front-line divisions.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Independent Operational Group Polesie under General Franciszek Kleeberg\n|-\n!

The corps, composed of the 3rd Panzer Division, the 10th Panzer Division, the 20th Motorized Infantry Division, with the 2nd Motorized Division in reserve, was ordered to capture the old fortress in Brześć Litewski and then strike further south towards Kowel and Galicia. The purpose of this attack was to cut Poland in two and paralyze the defenses east of the Bug River.\nInitially, Guderian's forces advanced almost unopposed. However, on September 14, 1939, they were stopped in the area of Brześć Fortress and Kobryn by a four-battalion-strong improvised force under General Konstanty Plisowski. In the three-day-long battle, which became known as the Battle of Brześć Litewski, both sides suffered significant casualties. Although the Poles finally withdrew from the area on September 17, 1939, the Germans did not start the pursuit soon enough to rout the retreating Polish Army. The simultaneous attack on Kobryn (sometimes referred to as the Battle of Kobryń) was inconclusive, with the Polish improvised 'Kobryń' Infantry Division under Colonel Adam Epler withdrawing unopposed.\nThe Podlaska Cavalry Brigade soon joined both Polish units from Kobryń and Brześć. The unit, commanded by General Ludwik Kmicic-Skrzyński, successfully evaded encirclement by withdrawing through the Białowieża Forest. General Kmicic-Skrzyński, accompanied by his chief of staff, Major Julian Szychiewicz, traveled to Vawkavysk, where he established telephone contact with General Kleeberg. The two agreed to join their forces and move southwards towards the Romanian Bridgehead.\nThe 16th Motorized Infantry Regiment, with artillery and Luftwaffe support, began an attack on the positions of the 83rd Polish Infantry Regiment on September 18, 1939, capturing several Polish positions. The Polish counter-attack, beginning at 17.00 hours, regained some territory. General Kleeberg began withdrawing his forces to Romania and Hungary. Over the next two days, Polish forces were ordered to concentrate north of Kowel. While on the march, a formation of the Polesie Group was attacked by fifth columnists and from the air, but loose groups of Polish soldiers joined the group.\nAfter a battle with Red Army forces, General Kleeberg decided to march to the relief of Warsaw on September 22, 1939. He first planned to capture crossing points on the Bug River. The concentration area would be near Włodawa. Formations, organized by Colonel Brzoza-Brzezina, fought only against the Germans. They could fight the Red Army, but only if they, the Poles, were attacked first. Between September 22, 1939, to September 25, 1939, elements of the Polesie Group were attacked by German aircraft during the march to Włodawa. On the last day of these attacks, General Kleeberg received information that unknown Polish units had captured Włodawa. Most personnel were soldiers from destroyed Polish formations who had not been captured by the Germans and were seeking commanders and formations that were still fighting. Kleeberg's staff began organizing the defense of a bridgehead in Włodawa.\nElsewhere, between September 17, 1939, and September 26, 1939, formations of the Polesie Group crossed the Bug River and entered an area near Włodawa. After receiving information about the surrender of Warsaw, General Kleeberg sought the opinions of his commanders, informing them of the political and military situation. He also asked General Zygmunt Podhorski, the commander of the 'Zaza' cavalry division (comprising two brigades of cavalry ['Pils' and 'Edward'], two infantry battalions ['Olek' and 'Wilk'] and divisional artillery), to join him. General Podhorski initially agreed but decided to first visit Stawy near Dęblin, the location of the main Polish Army arsenal. They would then move to the Holy Cross Mountains and engage in guerrilla warfare.\nKleeberg decided to re-organize his command. The 'Kobryń' division would get little in the way of re-supply but would be renamed the 60th Infantry Division. The 'Brzoza' and 'Drohiczyn' groups would be merged – Colonel Brzoza-Brzezina would command the resultant 50th Infantry Division with three infantry regiments and a division of artillery. The 60th Infantry Division would be commanded by Colonel Adam Epler, comprising three infantry regiments, a division of artillery, a motorized company of 37&nbsp;mm anti-tank guns, and four independent and seven independent formations. In all, Kleeberg had some 18,000 men.\nOn September 28, 1939, the Polish forces began to march south to the Parczew-Wojcieszków line, with the 'Zaza' cavalry division securing the march. One of the Uhlan regiments from the 'Edward' brigade successfully crossed the Wieprz River and captured Spiczyn; another cavalry regiment from the 'Zaza' Division captured Jawidz and Wymysłów after some resistance. The Germans suffered heavy losses. The next day, there was more fighting between the 'Zaza' Division and the Germans near Spiczyn. That evening, the 60th Infantry Division made contact with the Germans and entered a forest near Czeremniki. The Germans, employing an infantry formation supported by two tanks, launched an assault on the 1st Battalion, 182nd Infantry Regiment, although the attack was unsuccessful.\nBy September 30, 1939, Polish forces were situated between the rivers Tyśmienica and Wieprz. The following day, forces from the 'Polesie' Group passed the Świderki colonies of Bystrzyca, Wola Osowińska, Bełcząc and Ostrówek. The 'Zaza' Division had settled in forests near the Tyśmianka River. One squadron of the 2nd Uhlan Regiment, who were defending a road, destroyed a German reconnaissance patrol. The command element of the 5th Uhlan Regiment and the 'Olek' and 'Wilk' infantry battalions attacked the Germans in Kock and captured the town.\nBattle of Kock\nOn September 30, the commander of the 10th Army, Walter von Reichenau, ordered his staff to plan the destruction of a large Polish force located between the Bug and Vistula rivers. This task would involve the XIV Motorized Corps, which comprised the 29th Infantry Division, the 13th Motorized Infantry Division, as well as some independent units. Each German motorized division had a paper strength of 16,445 soldiers, 2,676 trucks and staff cars, 1,944 motorcycles, and 18 armored cars.\nOctober 2\nGeneral Gustav Anton von Wietersheim, the commander of the XIV Motorized Corps, knew that Polish forces were situated in the forests northwest of Kock. He believed that the commander of the Polish forces was unaware of Warsaw's capitulation.\nThe commander of the 13th Motorized Infantry Division,  , was of the opinion that the Polish forces had become so demoralized that they were incapable of combat and that a single German battalion would be enough to disarm the Poles and take them to a prisoner of war camp. General Otto sent a force consisting of the 3rd Battalion, 93rd Motorized Infantry Regiment, supported by the 8th Battery, 13th Regiment of Light Artillery. The battalion commander decided to divide his forces into two groups, which were sent to Serokomla and Kock. He could count on help from the 93rd Motorized Infantry Regiment, along with some support forces following him.\nKock\nAt 08:30am, a column of half-tracks and truck-mounted infantry came under fire from a guard platoon of No. 2 company of the 'Wilk' battalion. After a protracted engagement, the German troops withdrew. The Polish 179th Infantry Regiment was alerted and moved to defensive positions near and in Kock. At approximately 11:00, the German lead elements launched an attack on the Polish positions, which were now reinforced with two battalions. Despite supporting artillery fire, the attack failed. At dusk, German motorcyclists appeared near the church in Kock and began firing, though they subsequently withdrew upon return fire.\nSerokomla\nA company of motorized infantry entered the village of Serokomla. This led to the beginning of a chaotic action between the Germans and Uhlans from the 'Pils' Cavalry Brigade (commanded by Colonel Plisowski). An artillery unit from the same brigade supported the Poles. The Germans were forced to withdraw to the south of the village (see October 3, 1939).\nCasualties\nGerman losses were 300–400 killed and wounded. Five officers, 180 NCOs and privates have been briefly captured by the Poles. Components of the 'Pils' cavalry brigade lost about 200 killed or wounded.\nOctober 3\nThe stiff Polish resistance forced General Otto to use all his forces for an assault. He was going to split Polish forces in two and destroy them. He decided that the 33rd Motorized Infantry Regiment, supported by part of the divisional artillery, would attack Annopol, Pieńki, and Talczyn. This force was tasked with destroying the Polish 50th Infantry Division. The 93rd Motorized Infantry Regiment was ordered to capture Serokomla and then Hordzież and to destroy a defensive formation of the 'Zaza' cavalry division. The 66th Motorized Infantry Regiment entered the field of battle in the afternoon.\nGeneral Kleeberg thought that the main German advance would be toward the 'Zaza' cavalry division at Serokomla/Hordzież. He decided that part of the cavalry would be tasked with fending off the German attack. The rest would join a counter-attack alongside the 50th Infantry Division on the right wing and rear of the 13th German Motorized Infantry Division. The 60th Infantry Division and the 'Podlaska Cavalry Brigade' would close off potential German attack routes. If this counter-attack were successful, the German division would be forced to withdraw behind the Wieprz River.\nBetween 07:50am and 09:30am, two regiments of the 50th Infantry Division (the 180th and the 178th, less its 2nd battalion), attacked. They were supported by a howitzer battery. The attack was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Gorzkowski. Initially successful, the Polish units were halted and then forced onto the defensive. The cavalry attack by the Uhlans was also stopped and forced to withdraw west of Wola Gułowska.\nAt 10:30am, German artillery began to fire on Polish cavalry positions. The 93rd Motorized Infantry Regiment began an attack on the 'Wilk' battalion positions, inflicting heavy losses. The 33rd Motorized Infantry Regiment began a gradual attack on the Polish 50th Infantry Division.\nAfter heavy fighting, the German advance came to a halt. General Otto decided to support the 33rd Motorized Infantry Regiment with the 2nd Battalion of the 66th Motorized Infantry Regiment. German formations captured Wola Gułowska, but in the evening, they were forced to withdraw from the eastern part of the area and go on the defensive in the western part.\nOctober 4\nDue to the 13th Motorized Infantry Division's failure, General von Wietersheim was forced to use the 29th Motorized Infantry Division. General Otto ordered the 93rd Motorized Infantry Regiment to move from the Wieprz River to Dęblin. The 66th Motorized Infantry Regiment would attack Adamów and Wola Gułowska, and the 33rd Motorized Infantry Regiment would clear the area to the north of Kock.\nGeneral Kleeberg suspected that the main combined attack of the 13th Motorized Infantry Division and the 29th Motorized Infantry Division would be on Adamów and Krzywda. He thought there was a chance to destroy the 13th Motorized Infantry Division as they had already sustained heavy casualties and material losses. The 'Zaza' cavalry division and the 50th Infantry Division would defend their positions, and the 60th Infantry Division would attack the 13th Motorized Infantry Division. The Podlaska Cavalry Brigade would oppose the 29th Motorized Infantry Division.\nThat morning, the main elements of the 13th Motorized Infantry Division attacked the 'Zaza' cavalry division and the 50th Infantry Division. By noon, part of the 66th Motorized Infantry Regiment had captured Zakępie and advanced on Adamów, where they were halted by the 1st Battalion of the 180th Infantry Regiment.\nAbout 11 hours apart, first, from the west and then the east, forces from the 66th Motorized Infantry Regiment attacked the 'Olek' and 'Wilk' battalions who were defending Czarna. The defenders sustained heavy casualties from artillery fire, and 'Wilk' was forced to withdraw to the eastern edge of the Adamów forest. 'Olek', moving to Adamów, later deployed to Gułów. Between 10:00 and 11:00, formations of the 66th Motorized Infantry Regiment attacked formations of cavalry from the 5th Uhlan Regiment, who then withdrew from Wola Gułowska and Adamów to the south-east.\nAt about 12:00, the 66th Motorized Infantry Regiment attacked the 2nd Squadron of the 2nd Uhlan Regiment in Zarzecze, which withdrew with heavy casualties. The commander of the regiment moved the 4th Squadron south from Helenów to try to assist the 2nd Squadron while the 3rd Squadron held the enemy to the west of Wola Gułowska. The 3rd and 4th Squadrons, with elements of the 10th Uhlan Regiment, fought near the Turzystwo village cemetery and the church in Wola Gułowska. Ground was lost and regained repeatedly until an attack by the 2nd Battalion, 184th Infantry Regiment, and the Uhlan Squadron enabled the Polish to dig in.\nOctober 5\nGeneral von Wietersheim decided to use two of his divisions. They would attempt to encircle and destroy the Polish forces. The 13th Motorized Infantry Division advanced on Bystrzyca and Adamów, then Nowa Wróblina and Stanin; the 29th Motorized Division advanced on Radoryż Kościelny and Nowa Wróblina where they met troops from the 13th Motorized Infantry Division.\nGeneral Kleeberg determined to destroy the 13th Motorized Infantry Division by using forces from the 50th and 60th infantry divisions and the 'Zaza' cavalry division. The Podlaska Cavalry Brigade defended the position under Radoryż Kościelny and Nowa Wróblina.\nFighting in Wojcieszków, Gułów and Adamów\nThe 13th Motorized Infantry Division's artillery began to fire on the 180th Infantry Regiment battalion's positions in Adamów and the 'Olek' Battalion in Gułów grange at 05:30. Two and a half hours later, the 66th Motorized Infantry Regiment's advance began. After a brief skirmish at 10:00, the Germans captured Adamów; they then attacked the Polish positions on Hill 170 and Gułów, which they captured after intense fighting. The 66th Motorized Infantry Regiment took many losses. The division occupied positions on the eastern edge of the Adamów forest. General Podhorski sent the 'Pils' cavalry brigade to support them. After contact with the enemy brigade, they launched an attack on the German positions in the forest. They captured the forest, and there, they established defensive positions.\nAfter the capture of Adamów and Gułów Grange by the 66th Motorized Infantry Regiment, the 33rd Motorized Infantry Regiment began to advance, capturing Wojcieszków and . The Polish 178th Infantry Regiment withdrew. The commander ordered his force to retake Wojcieszków and Glinne, which they successfully achieved but then withdrew after sustaining heavy losses. The advance of the 180th Infantry Regiment on Adamów failed. Colonel Brzoza-Brzezina sent the 178th Infantry Regiment, who soon met the German advance. The 1st battalion included a part company of sappers. The 2nd and 3rd battalions took heavy losses and withdrew to Burzec.\nMeanwhile, an attack by the Polish 184th Infantry Regiment, with the support of a battalion of the 179th Infantry Regiment, recaptured the church and cemetery in Wola Gułowska. An advance by the 182nd Infantry Regiment, with the help of three 100mm howitzers, broke the German defense in Helenów.\n]]\nAt 16:00, the last German advance from Adamów began on positions of the 10th Uhlan Regiment in Krzywda forest by the 182nd Regiment in Helenów and the 184th Regiment in Wola Gułowska. The 10th Uhlan Regiment, after a hard fight, withdrew into the forest. Most forces of the 'Brzoza' division successfully defended their positions in Burzec. The 182nd Infantry Regiment held their position. The 184th Regiment had to withdraw due to a lack of artillery ammunition. During this time, two key Polish advances began. The 2nd battalion of the 183rd Infantry Regiment, with artillery support, began an assault with the bayonet on the Germans who had attacked the southern wing of the 'Pils' cavalry brigade.\nThe assault succeeded, and the Germans began to retreat, being chased by infantry and cavalry. The rear of the southern wing of the 13th Motorized Infantry Division was attacked by the 'Edward' cavalry brigade, they captured the village of Poznań, including a German artillery battery (which had to be destroyed when the cavalry was forced to withdraw due to them coming under fire from another German artillery battery). Elements of the 13th Motorized Infantry Division began to withdraw. One of the last attacks was by the 29th Motorized Division on the 'Podlaska' Cavalry Brigade positions and the rear of the 'Brzoza' Division. After that, both Polish formations withdrew to the south of Krzywda.\nAt 16:30, General Kleeburg gave his last order in Hordzieżka. Later, as the Hordzieżka forest was being shelled, he returned to his headquarters in Krzywda. At 20:40, Lieutenant Colonels Kazimierz Gorzkowski and Tadeusz Śmigielski left to establish contact with the command staff of the 13th Motorized Infantry Division. They made contact with the Germans near Adamów, and both sides agreed to a ceasefire that would last until 6 October (the next day) at 06:00, before which time a surrender was to be concluded.\nIndependent Operational Group Polesie surrendered on 6 October at 10:00. In his last order, General Kleeberg wrote that the reason for his decision to capitulate was that they were surrounded and ammunition and food were depleted. General Kleeberg's ceremonial surrender took place on 6 October at the Jabłonowskich Palace in Kock.\nSee also\n* List of World War II military equipment of Poland\n* List of German military equipment of World War II\nReferences\ntags-->\nFurther reading\n* Jan Wróblewski \"Samodzielna grupa operacyjna \"Polesie\" 1939\", Wojskowy Instytut Historyczny, Warsaw 1989.\n* Marian Porwit \"Komentarze do historii polskich działań obronnych 1939\", Volume 3 \"Czytelnik\", Warsaw 1973.\n* Stanley S.Seidner, Marshal Edward Śmigły-Rydz Rydz and the Defense of Poland, New York, 1978.\nExternal links"
