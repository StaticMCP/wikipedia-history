WARJ is owned by the Educational Media Foundation.\nHistory\nThe station signed on in 2013 as WBZS. From its sign-on, the station was leased by owner George S. Flinn, Jr., to Three Daughters Media, which simulcast the talk format of WIQO-FM Lynchburg.\nWBZS entered into a three-year lease to Community Media Group, owner of adult album alternative WVMP, on December 1, 2016.\nOn February 1, 2018, the AAA format moved exclusively to WBZS, which rebranded as \"102.5 The Mountain\".\nUpon the lease ending on December 1, 2019, the AAA programming moved back to WVMP.\nIn April 2020, Flinn donated the station's signal to air a noncommercial news/talk format focusing specifically on coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic in the New River Valley. The station was led by WVMP's former general manager and a volunteer staff, with on-air hosts remote working from home studios. Three months later, he sold the station and eight others to the Educational Media Foundation for $3.4 million. Upon the sale being consummated on October 29, 2020, the call letters were changed to WARJ, as the station picked up EMF's Air1 network.\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n*"
