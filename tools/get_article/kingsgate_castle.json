His main residence was Holland House in Kensington, near London. The name Kingsgate is related to an incidental landing of Charles II on 30 June 1683 (‘gate’ referring to a cliff gap) though other English monarchs have also used this cove, such as George II in 1748. The building soon fell in to ruin after construction and the large round tower is the only remaining original structure. The building was later the residence of John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury. It was sold by Lady Avebury in 1922, the castle became a fashionable hotel, and was then converted into 32 private flats in 1954.\nGallery\nFile:HollandHouse &Follies Kingsgate Kent.png|Kingsgate Castle and bay, 18th century\nFile:KingsgateKent ByPouncy 1793.png|A Benjamin Thomas Pouncy engraving of Kinsgate with the castle in the background, dated 1793\nFile:Kingsgate Castle, Margate, England-LCCN2002697070.jpg|A painting of Kingsgate Castle and the bay, dated between 1890 and 1900\nFile:Kingsgate Castle - geograph.org.uk - 8052320.jpg|Entrance to the grounds\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051112054208/http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/mss/online/online-mss-catalogues/cats/hpelham_1cat.html Letter from (T.
