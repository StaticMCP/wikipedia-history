However, by mid-2005 development had stalled, and while the software was still very much usable, in effect it languished without a maintainer. In late 2016, a new maintainer, Johnny Solbu, stepped up by forking the project into \"Grip 2\" based on version 3.3.1 of the original. In April 2017, he gained access to the original project page and stated on the forked project page his intention to move development back to the old project, and release v3.3.5.\nFeatures\n* Full-featured CD player with a small screen footprint in \"condensed\" mode\n* Database lookup/submission to share track information over the net\n* HTTP proxy support for those behind firewalls\n* Loop, shuffle, and playlist modes\n* Ripping of single, multiple, or partial tracks\n* Encoding of ripped .wav files into Ogg Vorbis, MP3 or FLAC files.\n* Simultaneous rip and encode\n* Support for multiple encode processes on SMP machines\n* Adding ID3v1/v2 tags to MP3 files after encoded\n* Cooperating with DigitalDJ, a MySQL-based MP3 jukebox\nGallery\nFile:Grip01.png|MP3 config options\nFile:Grip02.png|Ripping options\nFile:Grip03.png|Track listing\nSee also\n* Sound Juicer – The official CD ripper of GNOME\n* Asunder – Another GTK-based CD ripper\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*  a fork\n*  a fork launched december 30, 2016"
