The election was held concurrently with the 2009 local elections in England. 72 members of the European Parliament (MEPs) were elected from the United Kingdom using proportional representation.\nThe election was won by the Conservative Party, who won 27 seats with a share of 27.9% of the national vote. This was the last European election in the United Kingdom at which either the Conservatives or the Labour Party finished in first place. Other notable outcomes were that Labour – which came third – suffered a significant drop in support, and that the UK Independence Party (UKIP) finished second in a major election for the first time in its history, coming level with Labour in terms of seats but ahead of it in terms of votes. This was the first time in British electoral history that a party in government had been outpolled in a national election by a party with no representation in the House of Commons.\nThe British National Party (BNP) also won two seats, its first ever in a nationwide election. It also marked the first time the Scottish National Party (SNP) won the largest share of the European election vote in Scotland, and the first time Labour had failed to come first in a Welsh election since 1918. It was the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP)'s worst ever European election result, and also the first time an Irish Republican party, Sinn Féin, topped the polls in Northern Ireland.\nBackground\nElectoral system\nThe United Kingdom elected 72 members of the European Parliament using proportional representation. It was divided into twelve multi-member constituencies, or regions. The eleven of these regions which form Great Britain used a closed-list party list system method of proportional representation, calculated using the D'Hondt method. Northern Ireland used the single transferable vote (STV).\nThe experimental use of all-postal ballots in four regions in 2004 was not repeated, resulting in a sharp reduction in turnout in those regions.\nConstituencies and representation\nAs had been the case since 1999, the electoral constituencies were based on the government's nine English regions, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, creating a total of 12 constituencies. The Treaty of Nice fixed the number of MEPs for the whole European Parliament at 736; as a consequence of the accession of Romania and Bulgaria in 2007, the number of seats allocated to the United Kingdom was reduced from 78 to 72. If the Treaty of Lisbon had entered into force by June 2009, this figure would have been 73.\nOn 31 July 2007, in line with the required reduction in representation from the United Kingdom, the number of members elected from each region was modified by the Boundary Commission and Electoral Commission, based on the size of the electorate in each region. The recommended changes were approved by the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 2008.\nChanges in regional seat allocations\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n!Constituency!!Representation in 2004!!Representation in 2009!!class=\"unsortable\"|Net gain/loss\n|-\n|East Midlands\n|6\n|5\n|  1\n|-\n|East of England\n|7\n|7\n|\n|-\n|London\n|9\n|8\n|  1\n|-\n|North East England\n|3\n|3\n|\n|-\n|North West England\n|9\n|8\n|  1\n|-\n|Northern Ireland\n|3\n|3\n|\n|-\n|Scotland\n|7\n|6\n|  1\n|-\n|South East England\n|10\n|10\n|\n|-\n|South West England1\n|7\n|6\n|  1\n|-\n|Wales\n|4\n|4\n|\n|-\n|West Midlands\n|7\n|6\n|  1\n|-\n|Yorkshire and the Humber\n|6\n|6\n|\n|-\n|Overall\n|78\n|72\n|  6\n|}\n1Includes Gibraltar, the only British overseas territory which was then part of the EU.\nMEPs retiring\nConservative\n*Christopher Beazley (East of England)\n*John Bowis (London)\n*Philip Bushill-Matthews (West Midlands)\n*Jonathan Evans (Wales) – Became MP for Cardiff North in 2010\n*Chris Heaton-Harris (East Midlands) – Became MP for Daventry in 2010\n*Caroline Jackson (South West England)\n*Neil Parish (South West England) – Became MP for Tiverton and Honiton in 2010\n*John Purvis (Scotland)\n*David Sumberg (North West England)\nLabour\n*Robert Evans (London)\n*Glenys Kinnock (Wales)\n*Eluned Morgan (Wales)\n*Gary Titley (North West England)\nUKIP\n*Jeffrey Titford (East of England)\n*John Whittaker (North West England)\n*Roger Knapman (South West England)\nLiberal Democrat\n*Elspeth Attwooll (Scotland)\n*Emma Nicholson (South East England)\nIndependents\n*Den Dover (North West England) – former Conservative MEP, expelled over his expenses\n*Robert Kilroy-Silk (East Midlands) – former UKIP MEP, created new party Veritas\n*Ashley Mote (South East England) – former UKIP MEP, expelled for expenses fraud for which he was later jailed\n*Tom Wise (East of England) – former UKIP MEP, expelled for expenses fraud for which he was later jailed\nOpinion polls\nIn the run up to the election, several polling organisations carried out public opinion polling in regards to voting intentions in Great Britain.

Most of the results of the election were announced on Sunday 7 June, after similar elections were held in the other 26 member states of the European Union. Scotland declared its result on Monday 8 June, as counting in the Western Isles was delayed due to observance of the Sabbath.\n]]\nGreat Britain kept to the Europe-wide trend towards the right. The Labour Party, which was in its twelfth year of government of the United Kingdom, polled third and suffered a significant drop in support; UKIP finished second in a major election for the first time in its history, coming level with Labour in terms of seats but ahead of it in terms of votes. This was the first time in British electoral history that a party in government had been outpolled in a national election by a party with no representation in the House of Commons.\nThe Conservatives won in every region in Great Britain except the North East, where Labour won, and Scotland, where the SNP won. Labour suffered most notably in Cornwall, where it came sixth behind Mebyon Kernow, and in the wider South West region and South East, where it polled fifth behind the Green Party. The British National Party won two seats, its first ever in a national election. The share of the vote achieved by the English Democrats doubled.\nThe turnout in Scotland was the lowest in the United Kingdom at 28.8%, with 1,104,512 votes out of a total electorate of 3,872,975. In Scotland it was the first time the SNP won the largest share of the European election vote. The SNP share of the vote rose by 9.4% points compared to 2004; this was the biggest positive swing for any party in any region in Great Britain.\nIn Wales it was the first time since 1918 that Labour had failed to come first in a Welsh election, dropping 12.2%. In Wales the Conservative Party topped the poll, with the nationalist Plaid Cymru coming a close third. UKIP took the fourth Welsh seat, the first time Wales had elected a UKIP MEP.

Gibraltar was, however, part of the EU, the only BOT to be so, and participated as part of the South West England constituency.\nTurnout was 35% in Gibraltar, below the 39% for the South West England electoral region as a whole and significantly lower than the turnout in Gibraltar in 2004.\nThe Conservatives won with 53.3% of the votes.

It was also the first time an Irish Republican topped the poll, Bairbre de Brún of Sinn Féin coming first with 125,000 votes. The share of the votes for most parties in Northern Ireland remained essentially unchanged, the main exceptions were the DUP where their share of the vote fell by 13.8%, and the TUV, a party created by former DUP MEP Jim Allister whose share of the vote rose 13.7%. The DUP's decreased vote share was largely blamed on the TUV splitting the vote.\nSummary of the election results for Northern Ireland\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Party\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Candidate\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Seats\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Loss/gainFirst preference votes\n|-\n!

In the 2009 election, Diane Dodds retook the seat for the DUP.\nAftermath\nGordon Brown faced calls for him to resign as Prime Minister following Labour's defeat.\nDuring the 2005 Conservative leadership election, David Cameron argued for withdrawal of the Conservatives from EPP-ED and for the formation of a new group. After the European election it was announced that the Conservatives were leaving the EPP-ED and forming a new group, the European Conservatives and Reformists. On 22 June 2009, the first official list of the new group's members was released. The group held its inaugural meeting on 24 June, during which Conservative MEP Timothy Kirkhope was named interim leader. The first election for the group leadership was also scheduled for 14 July, pitting interim leader Kirkhope against fellow Briton Geoffrey Van Orden. However, both Conservative leadership candidates were forced to forfeit the leadership in order to prevent the group from collapsing, when then-Conservative MEP Edward McMillan-Scott defied his party whip and stood for one of the vice-presidency posts despite pledges the previous week that Polish MEP Michał Kamiński would be backed for it. Kaminski's bid for Vice-President of the European Parliament subsequently failed, and the Poles threatened to abandon the new caucus unless Kaminski was made the group leader in the parliament.\nSimilarly, UKIP helped found a new European Parliament Group, Europe of Freedom and Democracy, after the other parties in UKIP's pre-election European parliamentary grouping, Independence/Democracy, had polled badly.\nOf the two BNP candidates elected to the European Parliament at the 2009 election, the UK Government announced that it would provide them both with only the bare minimum level of support, denying them the ready access to officials and information that the other 70 British MEPs received.\nSummary of the post-election European Parliament groupings of each party\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|EP group\n!MEPs\n!colspan=\"2\"|UK party\n!MEPs\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\" style=\"color:inherit;background:\"|\n|ROwspan=\"2\"|European Conservatives and Reformists\n|rowspan=\"2\"|26\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\"|\n|Conservative\n|25\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\"|\n|Conservatives and Unionists\n|1\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\"|\n||Europe of Freedom and Democracy\n|13\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\"|\n|UKIP\n|13\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\"|\n|Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats\n|13\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\"|\n|Labour\n|13\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"gold\"|\n|Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe\n|11\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\"|\n|Liberal Democrats\n|11\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"\" rowspan=\"3\"|\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Greens–European Free Alliance\n|rowspan=\"3\"|5\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\"|\n|Green Party of England and Wales\n|2\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\"|\n|Scottish National Party\n|2\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\"|\n|Plaid Cymru\n|1\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\"|\n||European United Left-Nordic Green Left\n|1\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\"|\n|Sinn Féin\n|1\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"\" rowspan=\"2\" colsapn=\"2\"|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Non-Inscrits\n|rowspan=\"2\"|3\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\"|\n|British National Party\n|2\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\"|\n|Democratic Unionist\n|1\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* 2009 European Parliament election\n* Members of the European Parliament for the United Kingdom 2009–2014 (alphabetic order)\n* Treaty of Lisbon\n* 2009 United Kingdom local elections\n* 2010 United Kingdom general election\n* Opinion polling for the 2010 United Kingdom general election\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/europe/2009/election_09/default.stm BBC coverage]\n*[https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8040446.stm List of UK candidates for each region]"
