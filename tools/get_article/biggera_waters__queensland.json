In the , Biggera Waters had a population of 9,973 people.\nGeography\nBiggera Waters is located on the western side of the Broadwater. Beyond the Broadwater are South Stradbroke Island, Wave Break Island () and The Spit at Main Beach. Labrador Channel () lies along the southern coastline of the suburb separating it from Wave Break Island.\nBiggera Creek enters the suburb from the south (Labrador) and then flows east where enters the Broadwater (). The southern side of the mouth is a headland known as Lands End ().\nEtymology\nAn article in the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia by F.J. Watson offers this translation:\"Bigera from the red iron bark tree (Eucalyptus siderophloia) from the Yugambeh language.\"\nHistory\nSubdivided in the late 19th century, the area was originally settled by several fishing and  agricultural families including John Siganto, a local landowner, who built a residence named \"Finis\" (Latin, \"The End\") at Land's End. Land from Portion 62, Parish of Barrow, bound by Broad Street to the south, Loder Street to the west and Saltwater Creek to the north, was offered for sale in August 1883. Allotments 7,8 and 9 of section 4, portion 62 being site of the Labrador Hotel were offered for sale at the same time.\nA school reserve was created on Biggera Creek in 1889 on the corner of Hollywell Avenue and Coombabah Road but it wasn't until 27 January 1970 that the Biggera Waters State School opened.\nIn 1937 construction started on 36 acres of scrub land to the north of Biggera Creek to build an aerodrome. It was considered suitable for both land and the sea planes which used the Broadwater but development of the site was halted due to World War II. After the end of the war the aerodrome was revisited but the site was no longer considered suitable and other options were discussed.\nBiggera Waters and surrounding regions experienced a period of growth in the 1950s and in 1953 approximately 18 acres of the aerodrome property, situated in the vicinity of Ocean, Broadwater and Stradbroke Streets, was sold for development.\nBy 1954, the area developed by Mr. Oates north of Biggera Creek was known as Angler's Paradise.\nWhile there had been a crossing or bridge over the Biggera Creek for many years in the vicinity of Hollywell Road besides the school reserve, it wasn't until 1960, that a bridge was built across the mouth of the Biggera Creek at Land's End, opening up the northern side of the creek to greater residential development.\nDemographics\nIn the , Biggera Waters had a population of 8,534 people. Of these 47.5% were male and 52.5% were female. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 1.3% of the population. The median age of the Biggera Waters population was 39 years, 1 years above the national median of 38. 56.5% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were New Zealand 8.5%, England 4.9% and China 3.6%. 73.0% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin at 3.9%.
