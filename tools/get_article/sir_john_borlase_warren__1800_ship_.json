She traded with the West Indies after having made one voyage for the British East India Company (EIC). A French privateer captured her in 1808 though she was immediately recaptured. Her crew abandoned her in 1812 but she was recovered. She foundered in 1815.\nCareer\nSir John appeared in the 1801 Register of Shipping with W. Neil, master, Noble & Co., owners, and trade Plymouth–India. Messrs Princip & Saunders tendered her to the EIC to bring back rice from Bengal. She was one of 28 vessels that sailed on that mission between December 1800 and February 1801.\nCaptain William James Davis sailed on 28 December 1800 for Bengal. Sir John was at Falmouth on 24 January 1801 and arrived at Calcutta on 29 May. Homeward bound, she was at Saugor on 13 September, and reached the Cape of Good Hope on 30 December and St Helena on 28 January 1802. Sir John Borlase Warren left St Helena on 31 January 1802, in company with . Sir John arrived at The Downs on 11 April.\nThe data below is from Lloyd's Register.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Master\n! Owner\n! Trade\n|-\n| 1803\n| J.

The British recaptured Sir John the same day.\nThe data below is from the Register of Shipping from 1810 on. Lloyd's Register apparently did not list Sir John after 1809. The data is only as accurate as owners cared to keep it.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Master\n! Owner\n! Trade\n|-\n| 1809\n| R.

She was sailing from Savannah, Georgia, to Barbados when her crew abandoned her as she had six feet of water in her hold. The crew arrived at Jamaica.\nThe Register of Shipping listed Sir John'' with unchanging, stale data for at least six years after her loss, while showing her last survey as taking place in 1814.\nCitations\nReferences\n*\n*\n*"
