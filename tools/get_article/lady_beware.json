It was filmed on location in and around Pittsburgh.\nPlot\nKatya Yarno is a window dresser for Horne's department store who specializes in displays with sexy, slightly kinky themes. Surrounded by the equipment of her trade&mdash;mannequins and lingerie&mdash;Katya lives in a loft apartment in downtown Pittsburgh. She spends her evenings taking her bath by candlelight and thinking up new and more provocative window displays. Katya soon becomes the obsession of Jack Price, a handsome (and married) psychopath. Jack proceeds to stalk Katya and makes her life a living hell. Tired of being harassed, Katya decides to give Jack a taste of his own medicine.\nCast\n* Diane Lane as Katya Yarno\n* Michael Woods as Jack Price\n* Cotter Smith as Mac Odell\n* Peter Nevargic as Lionel\n* Edward Penn as Mr. Thayer\n* Tyra Ferrell as Nan\n* Trisha Simmons as Sylvia Price\n* Clayton D.

Universal, however, ended up rejecting the project, which ended up having \"100 homes, 17 drafts, and eight writers,\" as Arthur told The Los Angeles Times in 1986 ahead of the film's release. \"The purse-holders are men, and they attempted to make Lady Beware into a violent picture,\" Arthur added. \"I'm not interested in making a picture where a woman gets beat up. I want to show how a lady deals with this kind of insidious violence. A policeman can't help.\"\nFilming\nThe film was shot on location in Pittsburgh during the summer of 1986 after Scotti Brothers Entertainment agreed to finance and distribute it. The budget was reportedly under $2 million. Lady Beware's 28 days of shooting took place primarily in the city's North Side and downtown neighborhoods.\nRelease\nHome media\nLady Beware was released on VHS and Laserdisc in 1988 by International Video Entertainment. A second VHS release was put out in 1991 by Avid Home Entertainment.\nSoundtrack\nLady Beware was released on two soundtrack albums.\nThe 27 track complete and original music score by Craig Safan on Dragon's Domain Records 2020.\nThe 9 track original motion picture soundtrack including 5 tracks from the original music score by Craig Safan, 3 tracks by David Hallyday and a track by Abe E LaMarca available on all music formats on Scotti Bros Records 1987.\nControversy\nArthur did not approve of the film's final cut, which she said was re-edited by the producers to appeal to the exploitation crowd. \"[Some distributors asked for] more sex, so they took outtakes of Diane Lane standing there naked and incorporated them into the film,\" she told the Los Angeles Times ahead of the film's release. \"To me, that's exploitative. They printed up negatives where I never said print. I, as a female director, would never exploit a woman's body and use it as a turn-on.\" Arthur added that she did not remove her name from the film because she thought it would be unfair to the actors, who can't remove their names from the final product.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
