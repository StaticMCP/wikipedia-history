For when that king had asked the man what he meant by keeping hostile possession of the sea, he answered with bold pride, \"What do you mean by seizing the whole earth; because I do it with a petty ship, I am called a robber, while you who does it with a great fleet are styled emperor\".\nThis story also appears in John Gower's Confessio Amantis III.2363–2438 and in a poem by François Villon.\nThe book was republished by Haymarket Books in April 2015.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.pdf-archive.com/2018/04/13/noam-chomsky-pirates-and-emperors-old-and-new/noam-chomsky-pirates-and-emperors-old-and-new.pdf Pirates and Emperors: International Terrorism and the Real World]\n* [https://archive.org/details/PiratesAndEmperorsOldAndNewInternationalTerrorismInTheRealWorld Pirates and Emperors: International Terrorism and the Real World]\n* [http://library.uniteddiversity.coop/More_Books_and_Reports/Noam_Chomsky-Turning_the_Tide%20_US_intervention_in_Central_America_and_the_Struggle_for_Peace.pdf Turning the Tide: U.S. intervention in Central America and the Struggle for Peace]\n* [https://archive.org/details/MakingTheFutureOccupationsInterventionsEmpireAndResistance_20180531 On Power and Ideology: The Managua Lectures]\n* [https://epdf.tips/pdfviewer/web/viewer.html?file=https%3A%2F%2Fepdf.tips%2Fdownload%2Fthe-culture-of-terrorism-1988-01.html%3Freader%3D1  The Culture of Terrorism]\n* [https://libcom.org/files/rogue-states.pdf  Rogue States: The Rule of Force in World Affairs]\n* [https://archive.org/details/ImperialAmbitions1 Letters from Lexington: Reflections on Propaganda]"
