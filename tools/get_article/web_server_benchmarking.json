TPC-W was a common benchmark emulating an online bookstore with synthetic workload generation.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*Microsoft's [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb924375.aspx patterns & practices Performance Testing Guidance for Web Applications]\n*[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/231282 Stress tools to test your Web server] at Microsoft's knowledge base\n*\n*[http://www.specbench.org/web2009/docs/design/SPECweb2009_Design.html SPECweb2009 Release 1.20 Benchmark Design Document]\n*[https://github.com/denji/awesome-http-benchmark HTTP(S) benchmark tools, testing/debugging]\n*[https://nghttp2.org/documentation/h2load-howto.html h2load - HTTP/2 benchmarking tool - HOW-TO]"
