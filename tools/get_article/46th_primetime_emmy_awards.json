The ceremony was hosted by Patricia Richardson and Ellen DeGeneres. It was broadcast on ABC. Comedy Central received its first major nomination at this ceremony.\nFor its first season, the Cheers spin-off Frasier won Outstanding Comedy Series and four total major awards. For the second straight year Picket Fences won Outstanding Drama Series, it too won four major awards, but the more impressive drama series was newcomer NYPD Blue, which took home three major awards.\nNYPD Blue came into the ceremony with 17 major nominations. This broke Hill Street Blues record for most nominations by a drama or comedy series of 16 set in 1982, and put it in second place all time behind Roots which gained 21 major nominations in 1977. NYPD Blue set another milestone when it received every nomination for Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series, this marked only the ninth time that a show had received every nomination in a category. This feat has not been accomplished since.\nThe television film And the Band Played On also made Emmy history. It set a new record when it received nine major nominations, the most ever for a television movie. The record was maintained for twenty years, until The Normal Heart received nine major nominations in 2014. Both films won the top prize, but each lost all six of their acting nominations, directing, and writing to other projects.\nWinners and nominees\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Frasier (NBC)'\n** Home Improvement (ABC)\n** The Larry Sanders Show (HBO)\n** Mad About You (NBC)\n** Seinfeld (NBC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Picket Fences (CBS)'\n** Law & Order (NBC)\n** Northern Exposure (CBS)\n** NYPD Blue (ABC)\n** Star Trek: The Next Generation (Syndicated)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Late Show with David Letterman (CBS)'\n** Dennis Miller Live (HBO)\n** MTV Unplugged (MTV) (Episode: \"10,000 Maniacs\")\n** Saturday Night Live (NBC)\n** The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (NBC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'The Kennedy Center Honors: A Celebration of the Performing Arts (CBS)'\n** The 47th Annual Tony Awards (CBS)\n** The 66th Annual Academy Awards (ABC)\n** Comic Relief VI (HBO)\n** Tracey Ullman Takes on New York (HBO)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'And the Band Played On (HBO)'\n** Breathing Lessons (CBS)\n** Gypsy (CBS)\n** A Place for Annie (ABC)\n** To Dance with the White Dog (CBS)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Prime Suspect III (PBS)'\n** Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All (CBS)\n** The Stand (ABC)\n** Tales of the City (PBS)\n** World War II: When Lions Roared (NBC)\n|}\nActing\nLead performances\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Kelsey Grammer as Dr. Frasier Crane in Frasier (NBC) (Episode: \"The Good Son\")'\n** John Goodman as Dan Conner in Roseanne (ABC) (Episode: \"Guilt By Imagination\")\n** John Larroquette as John Hemingway in The John Larroquette Show (NBC) (Episode: \"Pilot\")\n** Paul Reiser as Paul Buchman in Mad About You (NBC) (Episode: \"Virtual Reality\")\n** Jerry Seinfeld as Jerry Seinfeld in Seinfeld (NBC) (Episode: \"The Puffy Shirt\")\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Candice Bergen as Murphy Brown on Murphy Brown'' (CBS) (Episode: \"It's Just Like Riding a Bike\")'\n** Roseanne Barr as Roseanne Conner in Roseanne'' (ABC) (Episode: \"The Driver's Seat\")\n** Helen Hunt as Jamie Buchman in Mad About You (NBC) (Episode: \"Cold Feet\")\n** Annie Potts as Dana Palladino in Love & War (CBS) (Episode: \"I've Got a Crush on You\")\n** Patricia Richardson as Jill Taylor in Home Improvement (ABC) (Episode: \"The Colonel\")\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Dennis Franz as Andy Sipowicz in NYPD Blue (ABC) (Episode: \"NYPD Lou\")'\n** David Caruso as John Kelly in NYPD Blue (ABC) (Episode: \"Pilot\")\n** Peter Falk as Lt.
