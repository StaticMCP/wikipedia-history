Upon reception of his message, this messenger is put to death by Aki and King Bram.\nPrincess Annikki meanwhile practices her archery in the woods as her father looks on.  A large bear trundles from the woods and curiously inspects her.  King Bram means to kill it for threatening his daughter, but is stopped by Annikki, who escapes the situation with little more than a series of scratches along her left cheek where the bear pawed her during its inspection.\nThe brothers Egil and Finn sell their ill-gotten goods to Bork the merchant, and visit their grandfather, Ozur, whereupon they take their younger brother Ketil out for a day of family recreation.\nThe boy recklessly charges about playing at being a raider, when the three brothers are set upon by another group of Vikings. This is the murdered Knut's brother and his men, who stab Ketil and begin savagely beating Egil.  Finn charges into the fray as he draws his weapon, ending the first issue of the series.\nSee also\n*Northlanders, a comic book series about Vikings from Vertigo\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&id=938 Reviews: Viking #1], Comic Book Resources"
