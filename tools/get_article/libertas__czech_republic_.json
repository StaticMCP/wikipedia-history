After some controversies it became an associate of Declan Ganley's pan-European alliance Libertas.eu.\nHistory\nAfter comprehensive negotiations with president Václav Klaus and other leading Czech eurosceptics, Ganley's attempts to bring about a Czech branch of Libertas.eu remained unsuccessful. The newly founded Party of Free Citizens, which was endorsed by Klaus, unexpectedly refused to cooperate with Ganley's pan-European alliance, leaving the name Libertas unclaimed in the Czech Republic.\nThis enabled the former media mogul Vladimír Železný, a eurosceptic Member of the European Parliament to register a party under exactly the designated name by January 21, 2009. It remained unclear whether the registration had been accomplished in some way on behalf of the European Libertas.eu or without any consent.\nSupporters of Železný's Libertas.cz included Jana Bobošíková and Vlastimil Tlustý but not Declan Ganley and his followers, who promptly disavowed the party. However, after Václav Klaus intervened, two MPs, Vlastimil Tlustý and Jan Schwippel, changed sides, leaving ODS and joining Železný's Libertas.cz. This led the European Libertas.eu to a volte-face, now claiming Železný's Libertas.cz an affiliate.\n2009 European Parliament elections\nThe list fielded by Libertas.cz in the 2009 European Parliament elections contained the following 29 candidates:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Code\n|Party\n|Number of candidates\n|%\n|Source\n|-\n|172\n|Nezávislí demokraté\n|19\n|65.52\n|\n|-\n|99\n|no party affiliation\n|6\n|20.69\n|\n|-\n|53\n|Civic Democratic Party\n|1\n|3.45\n|\n|-\n|713\n|Libertas.cz\n|2\n|6.90\n|\n|-\n|701\n|Doktoři (za uzdravení společnosti)\n|1\n|3.45\n|\n|}\nThe list contained the nineteen candidates from Železný's other party (Nezávislí demokraté), six independents (including Jan Schwippel, now disavowed ODS), one ODS (Vlastimil Tlustý), and three other candidates.\nThe number of candidates elected was zero.\nSee also\n* Treaty of Lisbon\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20211231123210/http://www.voltelibertas.cz/ Official site]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SJqHGwY0XA Vlastimil Tlustý - Libertas Ceska] on YouTube.\nReferences"
