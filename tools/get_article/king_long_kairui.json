Despite being a front-engined model, parts on the rear half of the King Long Kairui after the B-pillars were shared with the cab-forward King Long Kaige.\nStyling is controversial as just like the King Long Kaige, the rear half of the vehicle heavily resembles the Toyota Hiace, while the front fascia of the vehicle is heavily inspired by the Volkswagen Transporter T6.\nPowertrain\nThe King Long Kairui is powered by a 2.0 liter turbo engine developing 215hp and 282N·m and a 2.2 liter naturally aspirated engine developing 112hp and 198N·m. Gearbox options include a 5-speed manual transmission and a 6-speed manual transmission.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*http://www.kinglongvan.com.cn/vehicle_2.html - King Long Kairui official site."
