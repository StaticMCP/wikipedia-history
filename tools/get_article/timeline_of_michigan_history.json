The melting ice formed the Great Lakes, the Upper Peninsula and Lower Peninsula (in the Michigan Basin).\n*12800 BC Mastodons and other ice age mammals started to appear in the fossil record.\n*11000 BC to 9000 BC Archeological evidence of Paleo-Indians appeared, in the form of sharpened stone tool points known as fluted biface.\nFrench colonization\n*1621 or 1622 Étienne Brûlé and his companion Roosevelt paddled up the St. Mary's River and entered Lake Superior.\n*1634 Jean Nicolet, guided by the Wyandot, passed through the Straits of Mackinac and followed the southern shoreline of the Upper Peninsula, en route to find the Ho-Chunk and the imagined passage to the Pacific.\n*1641 Jesuit priests Isaac Jogues and Charles Raymbault followed the same route as Brûlé, finding many Ojibwa at the St. Mary's River rapids and naming it Sault Ste. Marie.\n*1653 The Iroquois Wars virtually emptied the lower peninsula of Native Americans and cut off the Ottawa River route and the St. Lawrence River route into Michigan.\n*1659 Pierre-Esprit Radisson and Médard des Groseilliers traveled to western Lake Superior with an envoy of fur trading Native Americans returning from Montreal.\n*1661 Father René Menard retraced the route of Radisson and Groseilliers to find the Wyandot, wintered in L'Anse, and then disappeared traveling inland from Chequamegon Bay.\n*1665 Claude-Jean Allouez and six Voyageurs retraced Menard's route to find him and the Wyandot; they reported copper deposits in the Keweenaw Peninsula area.\n*1668 Father Jacques Marquette established Sault Ste. Marie, the first European settlement in what is now Michigan.\n*1669 Jean Talon sent Adrien Jolliet and Jean Peré on a mission to investigate the Allouez copper reports.  Peré appears to have abandoned the mission in favor of fur trading.  An Iroquois warrior guided Jolliet's return trip along the eastern shoreline of the Lower Peninsula and down the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers.  That may have been the first visit of a European to the Lower Peninsula.\n*1671 June 14 – In \"The Pageant of the Sault\" at Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, four Jesuit priests led by Father Claude-Jean Allouez, representing the Roman Catholic Church, and Simon Francois Daumont St. Lusson held aloft a sword and a symbolic tuft of sod, declaring to the Native Americans that all of the Great Lakes country was henceforth a possession of King Louis XIV of France.\n*1671 Father Claude Dablon took over the mission at the Sault, and Marquette moved to establish a mission at St. Ignace.\n*1679 René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle sailed Le Griffon to St. Ignace and on to an island at the inlet of Green Bay, departed from there with 14 men via canoe south on Lake Michigan, and established Fort Miami.\n*1680 La Salle abandoned Fort Miami and made an overland trip across the Lower Peninsula.\n*1683 Louis de la Porte, Sieur de Louvigny and 150 French soldiers established Fort de Buade at St. Ignace.\n*1684 The mission of St. Joseph was established in Niles by Claude-Jean Allouez.\n*1686 Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut established Fort St. Joseph in what is now Port Huron.\n*1691 Marquis de Denonville sent Augustin le Gardeur de Courtemanche to establish another Fort St. Joseph at the Jesuit mission that had been formed around 1684 at modern Niles, Michigan.\n*1701 Antoine de Lamothe Cadillac, with his lieutenant Alphonse de Tonty, established a settlement on the Detroit River which they named Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit, today the city of Detroit. Their wives joined them and are said to be the first European women in Michigan.\n*1710 Cadillac was removed from Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit and replaced by Charles Regnault, Sieur Dubuisson. Before leaving, Cadillac invited the Meskwaki to live around the fort.\n*1712 The Meskwaki were not welcomed by the tribes living around Detroit, and Dubuisson ordered them to leave. They refused, and a fight broke out for 19 days, leading to the Fox Wars.\n*1715 Fort de Buade was abandoned and Fort Michilimackinac was constructed in what is now Mackinaw City, Michigan.\n*1720 to 1744 was a period of peace, fur trading and little expansion in the part of New France that would become Michigan.\n*1758 During the French and Indian War, Fort Frontenac was captured by British forces cutting off New France's St. Lawrence River supply and communication conduits into Michigan.\n*1760 Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit was peacefully turned over to the British after Quebec was defeated.\nBritish colonization\n*1763 In the Treaty of Paris, France ceded all lands in New France east of the Mississippi River to Great Britain, ending the French colonial period in Michigan.\n*1763 Odawa leader Pontiac led a major revolt of Native Americans against the British, besieging Fort Detroit.\n*1763 George III of Great Britain proclaimed that the newly acquired North American land – except Quebec, West Florida and East Florida – would be an Indian Reserve, prohibiting settlement without British permission west of the Appalachian Mountains.\n*1774 The Parliament of Great Britain passed the Quebec Act, which expanded Quebec's borders south to the Ohio River.\n*1783 The area that is now Michigan was included with the territory ceded by Great Britain to the United States by the Treaty of Paris that ended the American Revolutionary War.
