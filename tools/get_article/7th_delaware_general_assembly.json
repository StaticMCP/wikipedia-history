Elections were held the first day of October and terms began on the twentieth day of October. The Assembly met in the state capital, Dover, convening October 20, 1782, in the administration of Delaware President John Cook. He resigned by agreement and was replaced by President Nicholas Van Dyke, effective February 1, 1783.\nThe apportionment of seats was permanently assigned to three councilors and seven assemblymen for each of the three counties. Population of the county did not effect the number of delegates.\nLeadership\nLegislative Council\n*John Cook, Kent County\nHouse of Assembly\n*Nicholas Van Dyke, New Castle County\n*Simon Kollock, Sussex County\nMembers\nLegislative Council\nCouncilors were elected by the public for a three-year term, one third posted each year.\n{|width=100%\n|-valign=top\n|\n:New Castle County\n*Isaac Grantham\n*Thomas McDonough\n*George Read\n|\n:Kent County\n*John Banning\n*Richard Bassett\n*John Cook\n|\n:Sussex County\n*John Collins\n*Joshua Polk\n*William Polk\n|}\nHouse of Assembly\nAssemblymen were elected by the public for a one-year term.\n{|width=100%\n|-valign=top\n|\n:New Castle County\n*Robert Bryan\n*Thomas Duff\n*Peter Hyatt\n*John James\n*Thomas Kean\n*Samuel Smith\n*Nicholas Van Dyke\n**Joshua Clayton\n|\n:Kent County\n*Philip Barratt\n*Isaac Carty\n*Jehu Davis\n*John Gordon\n*William Molleston\n*Charles Ridgely\n*Edward White\n|\n:Sussex County\n*John Collins\n*William J.
