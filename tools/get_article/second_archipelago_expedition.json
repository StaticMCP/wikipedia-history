It formed part of the War of the Third Coalition, War of the Fourth Coalition and the Russo-Turkish War of 1806–1812. Senyavin's fleet defeated the Ottoman Navy at the Battle of the Dardanelles and the Battle of Athos and, in combination with Russian successes on land near the Danube and in the Caucasus, forced the Sublime Porte to conclude a truce with Russia in August 1807. After the conclusion of the Peace of Tilsit with Napoleon, the Russian navy lifted its blockade of the Dardanelles and returned to the Baltic Sea.\nNotes\nExternal links\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20100412052433/http://milistory.ho.ua/istor2/map1805-11/Adriatich_1806-7.htm"
