For a time known as the 18th Army, it served with distinction during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Being one of the five elite units of Chiang Kai-shek's Whampoa cliqué, the division ceased to exist after sustaining heavy casualties against the Communists in the Chinese Civil War.\nSee also\n* New 1st Army\n* 88th Division (National Revolutionary Army)\nReferences"
