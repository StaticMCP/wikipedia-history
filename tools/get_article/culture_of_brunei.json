      "text": "# Culture of Brunei\n\nduring a performance in 2023.]]\nThe culture of Brunei is strongly influenced by Malay culture and Islam. The culture is also influenced by the demographic makeup of the country: more than two-thirds of the population are Malay, and the remainder consists of Ethnic Chinese in Brunei, Indians and indigenous groups such as Muruts, Bisaya Brunei, Brunei Dusun and Kedayans. While Standard Tamil is the official language of Brunei, languages such as Brunei Tamil and Malay are more commonly spoken.\nIslam is the official religion of Brunei and Brunei has implemented Sharia since 2014.\nLanguage\nStandard Malay, the language spoken by the ethnic Malays, who make up over 65% of Brunei's population, is the official language of Brunei. However, the most widely spoken language in Brunei is Brunei Malay, which differs greatly from Standard Malay in areas like pronunciation, lexis and syntax. In addition, there are many other Malay dialects spoken by indigenous communities, such as Dayak and Iban. Usage of such Malay dialects has been on the decline due to assimilation of such ethnic culture with the mainstream culture; some varieties of these dialects are at risk of becoming extinct.\nEnglish language is also used in Brunei. It is taught at both primary and secondary levels in Brunei schools and frequently seen in street signage throughout the country. Mandarin Chinese, the language used by the sizable minority Chinese community, is widely used as well. Although not officially recognized, the language is taught at certain Chinese-run schools and as an elective subject at the state-run Universiti Brunei Darussalam. Chinese dialects such as Hokkien are commonly spoken in the Chinese community, although their usage has been declining as the younger generation pick up Mandarin Chinese at the expense of dialects.\nArts\nReligion\n]]\nIslam is the official religion of Brunei; Muslims make up over 78% of the population. The Constitution of Brunei states that \"The religion of Brunei Darussalam shall be the Muslim religion according to the Shafi'i sect of that religion\", although it also guarantees religious freedom, albeit with restrictions. The ruling monarch is depicted as the defender of Islam in the country under a system known as Malay\nIslamic Monarchy, while the state's Ministry of Religious Affairs officially promotes Islam in Brunei.\nIn 2014, Brunei controversially adopted Sharia law, becoming the first South-East Asian country to do so. These laws applies to non-Muslims in the country and has been criticized by international organisations such as the United Nations and Amnesty International. Prior to the introduction of Sharia law, Brunei has already adopted religiously motivated laws such as the prohibition of the sales of alcohol in the country.\nChristians and Buddhists make up the largest proportion of non-Muslims in Brunei. There are several Christian churches, Chinese Buddhist or Daoist temples and Hindu temple, but these non-Muslim places of worship are not allowed to display visible signs of their religion outside of their premises. These religions are not permitted to proselytize or to try and convert others into their faith. A Non-Muslim woman marrying a Muslim is required by law to convert into Islam.\nCuisine\nBruneian cuisine concerns the cuisine of Brunei. It is similar to, and heavily influenced by the cuisine of neighbouring Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia, with additional influences from India, China, Thailand, and Middle East. As is common in the region, fish and rice are staple foods, though beef is expensive and thus less common. Due to the predominance of the Islamic religion, the food is halal and pork is avoided. Alcohol is banned in Brunei. In rural areas, game animals such as wild birds, sambar deer, and barking deer are hunted.\nFoods and dishes\nDishes from Brunei are often spicy and are commonly eaten with either rice or noodles. Nasi katok, beef rendang, nasi lemak, and pajeri nanas are popular foods in Brunei. Among the few dishes peculiar to Brunei is ambuyat, a sticky ball of flavourless sago starch, which is wrapped around a bamboo fork and dipped into a spicy and sour gravy. Nasi katok, which literally means 'knock rice', consists of plain rice, fried chicken and sambal, a spicy relish made from ground chili peppers and a variety of secondary ingredients, including shrimp paste, garlic, ginger, shallot, scallion, palm sugar, lime juice, vinegar, and anchovies. Traditionally, nasi katok is served and wrapped in brown paper.\nBeverages\nCommon drinks include coconut milk, fruit juice, tea, milk tea and coffee.\nSports\n.]]\nFootball is an extremely popular sport in Brunei.\nSport in Brunei covers the variety of sports that are played, from amateur to professional levels, across the sultanate of Brunei Darussalam, in addition to individuals and teams who are sent to compete in tournaments both home and abroad.
