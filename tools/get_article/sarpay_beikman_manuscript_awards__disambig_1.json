They are awarded for unpublished manuscripts in various fiction and non-fiction categories. Sarpay Beikman publishes the winning entries, as well as giving a financial prize. The awards complement the Burma National Literature Award and the privately sponsored Sayawun Tin Shwe Award, Pakokku U Ohn Pe literary award, Thuta Swesone literary award and Tun Foundation award.\nBackground\n, winner for 1960]]The Burmese Translation Society began to present the Sarpay Beikman Awards (K. 1000) in 1949. They were renamed the Literary Fine Art Awards in 1962 and the National Literary Awards in 1965.\nThe awards were presented to authors who submitted manuscripts in categories such novel, translation, general literature, general knowledge, short story, poems, and dramas. The prizes were awarded annually, and the manuscripts published.\nEntries had to comply with five general principles: the works must support or at least agree with the ruling party aims, foster Burmese culture, promote patriotism, help build character and advance ideas and contribute useful knowledge.\nA first, second and third prize was awarded in each category where there were suitable entries, which was not always the case.\nFrom 1970 a new system was started. Unpublished works were submitted in competition for the Sarpay Beikman Manuscript Awards.\nHowever, the National Literary Awards, one per category, were selected from books that had been published in the previous year.\nAlthough 12 awards could be given, the selection committee usually chose fewer, since it is often not possible to find a publication that meets the guidelines, particularly in the \"novel\" category.\nIn recent years the genres covered by Sarpay Beikman Manuscript and National Literary Awards have been gradually extended and the number of awards increased.\nRelatively few translators are honored. In 2008 no translation prize was given at all.\nThis may in part be due to financial constraints, in part to censorship and interference in what is translated by the military regime.\nAwards by year\n1955 awards\n]]\n* Saya Zawgyi, Variety in literature category, for '\n* Journal Kyaw Ma Ma Lay, ' (Not Out of Hate)\n1957 awards\n* Ludu U Hla ' (ထောင်နှင့်လူသား) - Prison and Man\n1959 awards\n]]\n* Tin Moe, Poetry: ' (The Lantern)\n1961 awards\n* Khin Hnin Yu, ' (\tကြေးမုံရိပ်သွင် ဝတ္ထုတိုများ) Mirror Image-Like Short Stories\n1963 awards\n*Sayawun Tin Shwe, General Knowledge (literature)\n* Journal Kyaw Ma Ma Lay, ' (A Slow Stream of Thoughts and Burmese Medicine Tales)\n1964 awards\n* Ludu Daw Amar, Literature on Burmese Culture and Arts: ' - Artistes that People Loved 1964\n1990 awards\nThe winner of the 1990 awards were announced on November 22, 1991: In some cases no prize was awarded (e.g. no first prize, but a second or third prize),  The winners were:\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!Category !!
