It is his 11th album overall following the break up of the Beatles in 1970, his first album released after the dissolution of his band Wings the previous year, and his first album following the murder of his former songwriting partner John Lennon. The cover features an abstract oil painting by the artist Brian Clarke, a frequent McCartney collaborator, incorporating an overpainted transparency of a portrait of Paul taken by Linda McCartney.\nTug of War was produced by former Beatles producer George Martin and was a number-one hit in many countries, selling over one million copies in the United States in the year of its release. Some critics hailed it as a 'return to form' for McCartney, with Far Out declaring it his strongest work in 2022. The 2015 re-release, in a remastered deluxe edition, received a nomination for Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.\nRecording\nFollowing the release of the solo album McCartney II, McCartney's band Wings regrouped in July and October 1980 to rehearse several songs which later appeared on Tug of War and Pipes of Peace. Feeling the need for direction, McCartney called upon his former producer, George Martin, to begin recording a song written for the animated Rupert Bear character (to which McCartney acquired the film rights in 1970), titled \"We All Stand Together\", among others. The productive sessions continued until 9 December, the morning McCartney woke up to learn that his former songwriting partner and fellow ex-Beatle, John Lennon, had been murdered in New York City the previous night. Abandoning that day's session (in which he and Denny Laine were recording future B-side \"Rainclouds\") part-way through, both Martin and McCartney felt it was best to leave the project for the time being and start anew once they were ready.\nIn February 1981, two months after Lennon's death, McCartney resumed the sessions, recording that month with Stevie Wonder, Stanley Clarke, Carl Perkins and Ringo Starr, and laying down several songs in the process. The sessions were held at AIR Studios in Montserrat, in the Caribbean, and lasted from 3 February to 2 March, ending with \"Ebony and Ivory\" and \"What's That You're Doing\", two songs featuring Stevie Wonder. 10cc guitarist Eric Stewart also became a frequent collaborator of McCartney during this period. Further sessions were undertaken that summer at Martin's AIR Studios in Oxford Street, London. The sessions were so productive that several resulting tracks were held over for McCartney's next album, Pipes of Peace, which followed in 1983. The rest of 1981 was spent in a quiet fashion, with McCartney and Martin giving the finishing touches to the album.\nRelease, critical reception, and aftermath\n| rev2 = Robert Christgau\n| rev2score = B+\n|rev3 = The Encyclopedia of Popular Music\n|rev3Score =\n|rev4 = The Great Rock Discography\n|rev4Score = 5/10\n| rev5 =Pitchfork Media\n| rev5score = 6.7/10\n|rev6 = PopMatters\n|rev6score =\n|rev7 = Q\n|rev7score =\n| rev8 = Rolling Stone\n| rev8Score =\n| rev9 = The Rolling Stone Album Guide\n| rev9Score =\n|rev10 = Uncut\n|rev10score = 9/10\n}}\nIn a contemporary review for Rolling Stone, music critic Stephen Holden hailed Tug of War as \"the masterpiece everyone has always known Paul McCartney could make\", and particularly admired its vivid music and consistent songwriting. In  The Boston Phoenix, M. Howell felt that the album \"is bouncy, joyful, sweet and melodic—things we expect from Paul McCartney. It's also frightened and fierce—things he’s not supposed to be. To say that Tug of War is a far better record than McCartney’s ever made is to slight it—Tug of War goes beyond anything that McCartney ever indicated he was capable of.\" Robert Palmer was less enthusiastic in his review for The New York Times, and found the album \"exquisitely crafted though lyrically flawed\", as he thought McCartney's lyrics were often \"clichéd or mawkish\", but that the album \"at its best, is as finely crafted as his work with the Beatles\".\nIn March 1982, McCartney's duet with Stevie Wonder, \"Ebony and Ivory\", was released to considerable commercial success, reaching number one in many countries. Tug of War followed in April, and similarly became a worldwide number one. The follow-up single, \"Take It Away\", reached the top ten in the United States. The album restored McCartney's critical reputation after what was viewed as a lean period for him. Tug of War was nominated for the \"Album of the Year\" Grammy in 1983. Wingspan author Mark Lewisohn thought it was a better album than Band on the Run.\nThe album was issued in the US on compact disc on 29 February 1984. In 1993, Tug of War was remastered and re-issued on CD as part of The Paul McCartney Collection series. There were no bonus tracks: \"Rainclouds\" and \"I'll Give You a Ring\", B-sides of \"Ebony and Ivory\" and \"Take It Away\", respectively, were omitted. In 2007, Tug of War was remastered and re-released on the iTunes Store adding a solo version of \"Ebony and Ivory\".\nA further reissue of Tug of War was released on 2 October 2015, as part of the Paul McCartney Archive Collection. This edition included a remixed version of the album, along with the original mix, and a series of videos.\nTrack listing\nAll songs were written by Paul McCartney, except \"What's That You're Doing?\" co-written by Stevie Wonder.\nSide one\n\"Tug of War\" – 4:22\n\"Take It Away\" – 4:14\n\"Somebody Who Cares\" – 3:19\n\"What's That You're Doing?\"  – 6:19\n\"Here Today\" – 2:27\nSide two\n\"Ballroom Dancing\" – 4:07\n\"The Pound Is Sinking\" – 2:54\n\"Wanderlust\" – 3:49\n\"Get It\"  – 2:29\n\"Be What You See (Link)\" – 0:34\n\"Dress Me Up as a Robber\" – 2:41\n\"Ebony and Ivory\"  – 3:46\nArchive Collection reissue\nIn 2015 the album was re-issued by Hear Music/Concord Music Group as part of the sixth set of releases, alongside Pipes of Peace, in the Paul McCartney Archive Collection.
