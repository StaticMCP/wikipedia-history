In the , Tivoli had a population of 1,460 people.\nTivoli is home to one of six remaining drive-in cinemas in Queensland.\nGeography\nThe Warrego Highway passes from east (North Tivoli) to west (North Ipswich) through the north of the locality. Mount Crosby Road runs through from southwest to northeast.\nTivoli Hill is a neighbourhood with the suburb (). Prior to 1991 it was a separate suburb. The neighbourhood is near the hill of the same name().\nSituated north of the Bremer River, Tivoli is  by road north-east of the Ipswich CBD and north-east of the North Ipswich railway workshops.\nHistory\nThe Tivoli area had been subdivided and sold as farmland in 1861–63, and the observant purchasers went in for coal mining.\nHarry Hooper and his partner John Robinson called their mine, and one of the coal seams on it, the Tivoli, and the locality took its name from the mine.\nHouses and communities formed around the irregular subdivisions and mining areas.\nOn 9 September 1873 a Congregational church opened near the Tivoli mine . The church at 42 Church Street () has had continuous use. It is currently the Tivoli Christian Reformed Church.\nThe church hall was used as a school room for children and adults (night classes) from 1 July 1875. It had over 100 pupils by 1877 and opened as Tivoli Provisional School on 26 Jan 1877. On 17 January 1881 it became Tivoli State School. In 1937 it was renamed Tivoli Lower State School but in 1977 was renamed Tivoli State School again.\nWhilst many houses were built for workmen, mine owners built close to their work sites. Next to the school in Mount Crosby Road the family of John Wright, proprietor of the Eclipse mine, built three houses on large allotments. The grandest, Oaklands is the central one; all have spacious gardens and are listed on the Queensland Heritage Register.\nOn the other side of Mount Crosby Road, the Abermain Colliery (1880s) was a large operation with a spur line from the Tivoli railway line and several coke ovens.\nIn another direction, a tramway was opened from the Tivoli mines to the pumping station at the Mount Crosby weir, transporting coal from 1913 until about 1932.\nAfter lying idle for several years the Abermain Colliery was used for sewerage treatment. It adjoins a sports complex and the Ipswich Caravan Village. A short distance south there is the Abermain electricity substation which was enlarged in 2009.\nFinanced and named by John Robinson (Ipswich soda-water manufacturer) and Harry Hooper, it seems that Tivoli was a Hooper family name.\nDemographics\nIn the , Tivoli had a population of 1,487 people.\nIn the , Tivoli had a population of 1,460 people.\nHeritage listings\n|alt=]]\nTivoli has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* 98/100/106 Mount Crosby Road: Wright Family Houses\nEducation\nTivoli State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 108 Mount Crosby Road (). In 2018, the school had an enrolment of 133 students with 13 teachers (11 full-time equivalent) and 12 non-teaching staff (6 full-time equivalent).\nThere are no secondary schoolss in Tivoli. The nearest secondary school is Ipswich State High School in Brassall to the west.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
