In the case of a popular claim, the endorser of the claim can (though in a case like the Eastern Roman Empire, where its popular claim lasted over many rulers, should simply not be listed) be listed instead of a claimant, this can be marked with (E), this can also be used in special cases like the concept of Russia being Third Rome.\nTo be added to the list of claims made by parties unaffiliated with their subject, a claim must have been purported externally and never endorsed or encouraged by the supposed claimant. For example, the Kingdom of Soissons, despite its ruler Syagrius never having claimed the title, was sometimes referred to as the Kingdom of the Romans and him as the King of the Romans by outsiders.\nList\nSelf-proclaimed claimants\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!Original Claimant\n!Claimant's primary titles or popular claim location\n!Claim\n!Initial Claim Date\n!Type\n!Supported by papacy\n!Further Information\n|-\n|Benito Mussolini\n|, Italian Empire\n|Roman Empire(see info)\n|1936 CE\n|Popular (cultural)\n|\n|While not a direct claim to the Roman Empire, Benito Mussolini would often portray the Italian Empire as a successor to the Roman Empire, this can be seen in the \"Mostra Augustea della romanità\" propaganda.\n|-\n|Constantine The Great\n|\n|Roman Empire\n|330 CE\n|Popular (cultural)\n|Until the Great Schism\n|The people of the Eastern Roman Empire often identified as Romaioi, or Romans.Teall, John L., Nicol, Donald MacGillivray. \"Byzantine Empire\".

Although he assumed the title of dux (provincial governor), his realm’s status as the last remnant of Rome in the west led nearby barbarians to erroneously refer to him as Rex Romanorum (King of the Romans). The historian Gregory of Tours coined the term ‘Kingdom of the Romans’ for Syagrius’ realm in his writings in the 6th century CE.\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* Succession of the Roman Empire\n* Roman Empire\n* List of Roman emperors\n* Fall of the Western Roman Empire\nReferences"
