The PCC was convened as part of the Double Tenth Agreement between the KMT and the CCP. The conference ultimately ended in failure.\nBackground\nOn 10 October 1945, the KMT and the CCP signed the Double Tenth Agreement in Chongqing. One of the conditions agreed was the creation of a political consultative conference, participated by political party and non-party representatives. Afterwards, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin advised both parties to hold a consultative conference to manage their differences.\nMeeting\nDue to pressure from the United States, CCP and other actors, Chiang Kai-shek eventually relented and agreed to hold a political consultative conference. The PCC was tasked with creating a new constitution and a democratic government.\nThe PCC was held in Chongqing during 10–31 January 1946, which received both local and nationwide attention. The CCP organized many support meetings for these conference across the country, which were routinely disrupted by the secret police of the Nationalist government attempting to encourage anti-CCP sentiments. The Conference, lasted until 31 January, adopted 12 resolutions including reforming government, amending draft constitution, and convening National Constituent Assembly. A committee on organizing draft constitution was also formed.\nMembership\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"2\" |Party\n!Officeholder\n!Office\n|-\n| rowspan=\"8\" style=\"background:#000095;\" |&nbsp;\n| rowspan=\"8\" |KMT\n|Sun Fo\n|Leglslative Yuan President\n|-\n|Wu Tiecheng\n|Secretary-General of the Central Party Committee of the Kuomintang\n|-\n|\n|Deputy Secretary-General of the Supreme Council for National Defense\n|-\n|Chen Lifu\n|Head of Party Organization\n|-\n|Chang Li-sheng\n|Minister of the Interior\n|-\n|Wang Shijie\n|Minister of Foreign Affairs\n|-\n|Shao Lizi\n|Secretary-General of the National Political Participation Association\n|-\n|Zhang Qun\n|Governor of Sichuan\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" style=\"background:#FF3333;\" |&nbsp;\n| rowspan=\"7\" |CCP\n|Zhou Enlai\n|Vice Chairman of the CCP, head of the CCP delegation\n|-\n|Dong Biwu\n|Minister of Foreign Affairs\n|-\n|Ye Jianying\n|Chief of Staff of the Eight Route Army\n|-\n|Wu Yuzhang\n|Representative of the National Political Participation Association\n|-\n|Wang Ruofei\n|Representative of the Central Committee in Chongqing\n|-\n|Lu Dingyi\n|Head of the Publicity Department\n|-\n|Deng Yingchao\n|Head of the Women's Department\n|-\n| rowspan=\"9\" style=\"background:#FF7F00;\" |&nbsp;\n| rowspan=\"9\" |CDL\n|Zhang Lan\n|Representative of the National Political Participation Association and the CDL Chairman\n|-\n|Luo Longji\n|Professor of the National Southwestern Associated University and the CDL Propaganda Department Head\n|-\n|Carsun Chang\n|Representative of the China National Socialist Party\n|-\n|Zhang Bojun\n|Chairman of the Third Party\n|-\n|Zhang Dongsun\n|Representative of the China National Socialist Party\n|-\n|Shen Junru\n|Representative of the Chinese People's National Salvation Association\n|-\n|Huang Yanpei\n|Representative of the National Association of Vocational Education of China\n|-\n|Liang Shuming\n|Representative of the Rural Reconstruction Movement\n|-\n|Zhang Shenfu\n|Professor of the Tsinghua University\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#FFCC33;\" |&nbsp;\n| rowspan=\"5\" |YCP\n|Zeng Qi\n|Chairman of the YCP\n|-\n|Chen Qitian\n|Representative of the National Political Suffrage Association\n|-\n|Yang Yongjun\n|Responsible person in South China\n|-\n|Yu Jiaju\n|Political member of the university professors\n|-\n|Chang Naide\n|Political member of the university professors\n|-\n| rowspan=\"9\" style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" |&nbsp;\n| rowspan=\"9\" |Independent\n|Mo Teh-hui\n|Political member\n|-\n|Shao Congxu\n|Political member\n|-\n|Wang Yun-wu\n|Political member, director of The Commercial Press\n|-\n|Fu Ssu-nien\n|Political member, university professor\n|-\n|Hu Zhengzhi\n|Political member, director of Ta Kung Pao\n|-\n|Guo Moruo\n|Political writer\n|-\n|Qian Yongming\n|Political member, chairman of the Bank of Communications\n|-\n|Miao Yuntai\n|Representative of the southwest national capitalists\n|-\n|Li Zhuchen\n|Representative of the north China industrial capitalists\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |Source:\n|}\nCollapse of the talks\nOn 10 February 1946, riots broke out in Jiaochangkou at the center of Chongqing.
