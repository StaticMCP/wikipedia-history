An updated edition was published in 2013.\nSynopsis\nThe book is a collection of Milne's columns published in The Guardian over 10 years.\nVerso Books describes The Revenge of History as an account of the first decade of the twenty-first century. The book indicts the United States presented as a global and corporate empire in decline. Milne also examines the causes of the credit crisis and the Great Recession, claims the policy of humanitarian military intervention to be a failed land grab, offers an explanation of the dynamo behind the roaring Chinese economy and introduces new models of society flourishing in Latin America.\nReception\nNaomi Klein praised The Revenge of History as \"a book with an urgent message\" and wrote that \"Reading Seumas Milne, one often has a feeling of physical relief: finally someone not only sees the truth but articulates it with thrilling erudition and moral clarity\".\nIn The Guardian Owen Hatherley wrote \"Milne has a knack for making arguments which when published are excoriated as unforgivable, and which then gradually become guiltily commonsensical\" and broadly praised the work.\nAl Jazeera published a review which suggested that \"As The Revenge of History reminds us, it is the left which has got the major judgement calls of the last 10 years – on economic and foreign policy – essentially correct, while the political right and many mainstream liberals have got them badly wrong\" and which also praised the book.\nReferences"
