The football tournament was part of a festival of sporting and cultural events staged annually in Kabul from 1974 till 1977 to commemorate the anniversary of the Republic of Afghanistan, following its foundation on 17 July 1973 when Mohammad Daoud Khan came to power following the 1973 Afghan coup d'état. It was stopped following Daoud's assassination on 28 April 1978 during a coup d'état (the Saur Revolution) which formed the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. The anniversary of the Saur Revolution was also celebrated with a similar Jashn festival later on in 1979, which was won by Pamir Dushanbe for the fifth consecutive time. The 1976 edition also featured the official national teams of India and Pakistan.\nEtymology\nThe festival was referred to as Jashn-e-Jamhouriat  (), Jashn-e-Kabul, or simply Jashn. It was also referred to in the Kabul Times newspaper as the Jame-Jamhouriat Cup (), or as Jamhouriat Cup.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; width: 100%; text-align: center;\"\n!Year\n!Winner\n!Runner-up\n!Third place\n!Fourth place\n!Teams\n|-\n|1974Details\n|CSKA Pamir\n|Naft Tehran\n|\n|India XI\n|4\n|-\n|1975Details\n|CSKA Pamir\n|Iran XI\n|Turkey XI\n|\n|5\n|-\n|1976Details\n|CSKA Pamir\n|\n|\n|Iran XI\n|6\n|-\n|1977Details\n|CSKA Pamir\n|Iran XI\n|\n|\n|6\n|}\nSee also\n* Football in Asia\n* Football in Afghanistan\nReferences"
