It was founded in 1995 by real-estate developer Robert Bigelow, who set it up to research and advance serious study of various fringe science and paranormal topics, most notably ufology. Deputy Administrator Colm Kelleher was quoted as saying the organization was not designed to study UFOs only. \"We don't study aliens, we study anomalies. They're the same thing in a lot of people's minds, but not in our minds.\" NIDSci was disbanded in October 2004.\nHistory\nThe National Institute for Discovery Science, known also as NIDS, was founded by Robert Bigelow serving as a way to channel funds into the scientific study of paranormal phenomena. The NIDS performed research in the area of cattle mutilation and black triangle reports.\nThe NIDSci bought Skinwalker Ranch after journalist George Knapp first wrote about it in 1996, and Deputy Administrator Colm Kelleher led the investigation for a number of years.\nA hotline was established in 1999 to receive reports of odd occurrences. Over 5,000 reports made by phone calls and e-mails were received by the organization. Officials say many were explained as missile test launches and meteors.\nSee also\n* Bigelow Aerospace\n* Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program\n* Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071007111321/http://www.nidsci.org/ Snapshot of NIDSci site at the Internet Archive] (archived October 7, 2007)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080723123455/http://shell.amigo.net/~tmv/Special_Inv3.html NIDS - Robert Bigelow]&nbsp;— a collection of news articles about the NIDS' early days\n* [http://www.ufoevidence.org/documents/doc1200.htm The UFO Hunters - Scientists at National Institute for Discovery Science study anomalous phenomena]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/19981205022642/http://www.parascope.com/nb/articles/bigelow.htm Where the Steers and the Aliens Play] an article by Sean Castel in Fate, August, 1998\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091026221958/http://geocities.com/Area51/Rampart/2271/  The End of the National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS)]\n*[http://www.csicop.org/si/show/bigelows_aerospace_and_saucer_emporium/ Bigelow’s Aerospace and Saucer Emporium], Skeptical Inquirer 33.4, July/August 2009"
