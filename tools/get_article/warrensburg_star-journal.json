Warrensburg, population of 1,000 at the time, did not have a newspaper. Prior to the war, Eads, a church pastor, had published the Warrensburg Signal. In addition to his pastor and newspaper interests he was also a physician and ran a hotel.\nOn October 6, 1876, it became the Journal-Democrat after merging with the Warrensburg Democrat, which had started in 1871. In 1907, Wallace Crossley became the publisher. On February 6, 1913, it became the Star-Journal after merging with the Johnson County Star founded in 1883 by J.M. Coe. William and Avis Tucker bought the paper in 1947. William Tucker died in 1966 and Avis owned the paper until 2007 when it was sold to NPG.\nOver time, the Daily Star-Journal changed from a daily publication to a weekly publication on Fridays in 2020.\nIn October 2020, the paper was purchased by the Sedalia Democrat, under parent company Phillips Media Group. At that time, the name was changed from Daily Star-Journal to Star-Journal to reflect its weekly publishing.\nIn September 2021, the Star-Journal brought back the Tuesday print edition. The ''Star-Journal's'' print edition is now published twice a week on Tuesdays and Fridays.\nIn August 2024, Phillips Media Group sold the newspaper to Carpenter Media Group.\nNotable staff\nAmong its reporters was Bill Dedman, who won a 1989 Pulitzer Prize. Thomas Benton Hollyman was a photographer. James C. Kirkpatrick started his reporting career at the paper.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.warrensburgstarjournal.com]"
