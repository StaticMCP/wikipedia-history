An attack of the massed ranks of the imperial Guard led in person by Marshal Ney launched towards the Allied infantry on the ridge under the overall command of the Duke of Wellington, is being assaulted by Maitland's Brigade of Guards and another brigade under Frederick Adam. Wellington is shown with his staff by a Royal Artillery battery, ordering a general advance of the Allied Army.\nAllan had travelled extensively producing genre scenes from Russia and the Ottoman Empire, before building his reputation on history paintings, particularly scenes of Scottish history.\nThe painting was displayed at the Royal Academy Exhibition of 1843 at the National Gallery in London. The picture  was purchased by the Duke of Wellington for his London residence Apsley House, where it remains today.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Carlisle, Janice.
