King, released in 2003. It pays tribute to the big band sound of King's youth.\nCritical reception\n|rev2 = The Encyclopedia of Popular Music\n|rev2score =\n|rev3 = Rolling Stone\n|rev3score =\n}}\nPopMatters wrote that \"among all the honorable, likable, vaguely disappointing numbers, there is one song, King's own 'Neighborhood Affair,' that provides a startling reminder that B.B. King is not simply a blues icon, not simply the affable symbol of a music that even non-fans can identify.\" The Washington Post called the album \"safe and predictable\" and \"a minor footnote\" in King's career.\nTrack listing\n#\"Exactly Like You\" (Jimmy McHugh & Dorothy Fields) - 3:21\n#\"On My Word of Honor\" (Jean Miles, Katherine Harrison) - 3:22\n#\"I Want a Little Girl\" (Murray Mencher, Billy Moll) - 2:48\n#\"I'll String Along with You\" (Al Dubin, Harry Warren) - 3:31\n#\"I Need You\" (Ronald Irwin Satterfield, Laury Steve Bruce) - 3:03\n#\"A Mother's Love\" (Clyde Otis) - 2:59\n#\"(I Love You) for Sentimental Reasons\" (Deek Watson, William Best) - 3:31\n#\"Neighbourhood Affair\" (B.B.
