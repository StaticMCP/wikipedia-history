The country was opened to the church's missionaries in 1991. Since then, as of November 2025, the church has grown to 13,691 members in 37 congregations.\nHistory\nThe LDS Church's presence began in the 1980s when Congolese members returning from Europe requested missionaries. The first congregation was organized, and baptisms took place in 1991, the same year the church received official government recognition. The country was dedicated for missionary work in 1992. Despite civil unrest between 1997 and 1999, which sometimes led to the temporary withdrawal of missionaries, local members continued to support each other. The first stake was organized in Brazzaville in 2003, and the Republic of the Congo Brazzaville Mission was created in 2014.\n|1971|10\n|1991|99\n|1995*|1,000\n|1999|1,602\n|2004|3,404\n|2009|4,462\n|2014|6,053\n|2019|8,542\n|2022|11,481\n}}\nStakes\n=Operating Temple = Stake = meetinghouse not part of stake or district|places=\n|label=Kinshasa}}\n}}\nAs of February 2023, the following stakes existed in the Republic of the Congo:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Stake\n! data-sort-type=date|Organized\n!Wards\n!Branches\n|-\n|Brazzaville Republic of Congo\n|19 Oct 2003\n|7\n|\n|-\n|Diata Republic of the Congo\n|8 Nov 2020\n|6\n|2\n|-\n|Makelekele Republic of Congo\n|31 Aug 2014\n|6\n|\n|-\n|Pointe-Noire Republic of Congo\n|19 Jul 2015\n|6\n|2\n|}\nThe Mindouli Branch, Ouésso Branch, and the Republic of Congo Brazzaville Mission Branch are not part of a stake or district.
