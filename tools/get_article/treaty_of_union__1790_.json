It was signed by representatives of the provinces of Brabant, Flanders, , Tournai and Tournaisis, Hainaut, Namur, Limburg and the Lands of Overmaas, Austrian Upper Guelders, and Mechelen in the States General of the Southern Netherlands (which thereby reconstituted themselves as the Sovereign Congress) on 11 January 1790, and ratified by the various provinces on 20 January 1790, after which it came into effect. The Duchy of Luxemburg did not sign or ratify the treaty, and therefore never became a part of the United Belgian States.\nContent\nThis section includes a short summary of each article of the treaty.\nArticle I: The provinces unite into the United Belgian States.\nArticle II: The provinces give congress the following powers: managing defense, establishing peace and war, raising and maintaining a national army, constructing and maintaining the necessary fortifications, creating alliances with foreign powers, and sending and receiving residents, ambassadors and other agents.\nArticle III: Each province will send representatives to congress.\nArticle IV: The provinces are Catholic, will maintain their ties with the Holy See and adhere to the fundamental rules of the Catholic faith. The rights of the Dutch Reformed Church are respected.\nArticle V: Only congress will be allowed to create coins under the stamp of the United Belgian States.\nArticle VI: The provinces will provide for the expenses required to maintain congress.\nArticle VII: The provinces will keep all powers and sovereignty not explicitly given to congress.\nArticle VIII: In case of disputes between provinces, the congress will have the power to draft a solution.\nArticle IX: If a province is attacked by a foreign power, all other provinces will join on their side.\nArticle X: No province will be allowed to enter into an alliance or treaty with a foreign power or to unite with another province without the consent of congress. However, the province of West-Flanders will be allowed to unite with Flanders.\nArticle XI: No province will be allowed to leave the union for whatever reason.\nArticle XII: No one may serve in both the military and congress. Also, those who have served under foreign powers will not be allowed to join congress.\nSee also\n* Brabant Revolution\n* Committee of United Belgians and Liégeois\n* Manifesto of the People of Brabant\n* Manifesto of the Province of Flanders\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.1789-1815.com/traite_belgique.htm Text of the Treaty]\n* [http://storme.be/vereenigdenederlandschestaeten.html Text of the Treaty]"
