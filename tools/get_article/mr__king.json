The music was composed by Mani Sharma. The film released on 24 February 2023.\nCast\nSoundtrack\nThe music was composed by Mani Sharma and released by Saregama Telugu.\nReception\nA critic from The Times of India wrote that \"Mr King has several moments to commend, but it still has scope for refinement. It could have been better executed – especially the episodes involving the love triangle between Shiva, Umadevi and Vennela\". A critic from 123telugu wrote that \"On the whole, Mr. King is a tiresome watch that lacks a proper storyline and execution. The lead actor Sharan and his scenes with Tanikella Bharani were watchable\". A critic from The Hans India wrote that \"In summary, Mr. King fails to impress with its weak plot and lackluster execution, resulting in a tedious viewing experience\". A critic from The South First wrote that \"Mr King is a well-intentioned film by a new and young team. It tries to spread the message that a positive attitude and values matter more than money, to ensure success in the long run.\". A critic from India Herald wrote that \"the movie starts to seem excessively sanctimonious, and the endless talks get old quickly. Mr. king tries to offer advice on every topic pertaining to business, love, and marriage, which has greatly hurt the film\".\nHome media\nThe movie was released on Amazon Prime Video.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
