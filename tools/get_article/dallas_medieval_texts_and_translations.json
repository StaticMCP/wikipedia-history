The series is published by Peeters, a publishing house based in Leuven, Belgium. Modeled upon the Loeb Classical Library, the Dallas series has the goal \"to build a library of medieval Latin texts, with English translations, from the period roughly between 500 and 1500, that will represent the whole breadth and variety of medieval civilization.\" The editorial board of the series is composed of several medievalists from the University of Dallas and Southern Methodist University; Kelly Gibson of the University of Dallas and Philipp W. Rosemann from Maynooth serve as co-editors. Members of an international board of editorial advisers review manuscripts submitted to the series to ensure their quality.\nThe first volume of the series appeared in 2002; as of November, 2022, twenty-nine volumes have been published, while twenty more are in preparation. In November, 2010, Harvard University Press launched a similar project, the Dumbarton Oaks Medieval Library. It is different from the Dallas series in that it also publishes texts in Byzantine Greek and Old English.\nList of published volumes\n* vol. 1: Manegold of Lautenbach, Liber contra Wolfelmum.
