The award recognises significant, long lasting and innovative architecture with usually more than 25 years passed since the completion of construction.\nBackground\nThe Award for Enduring Architecture recognises achievement for the design of buildings of outstanding merit, which have remained important as high quality works of architecture when considered in contemporary cultural, social, economic and environmental contexts in the state of Tasmania. Nominations for the award can be made by AIA members, non–members and non–architects, but they must provide adequate material and information supporting the nomination for consideration of the jury. The award was initially known as the 25 Year Award, but was renamed in line with the national and other state based awards in 2013.\nThe average age of the 16 projects recognised from 2010 to 2025 is 43.1 years from completion of construction to year of award.\nNational award winners\nRecipients of the state–based award are eligible for consideration of the National Award for Enduring Architecture presented later in the same year, as part of the Australian National Architecture Awards.\nOnly one project located in Tasmania has won the national award. In 2010 the Supreme Court Complex in Salamanca Place, Hobart by the Department of Public Works (Architect Peter Partridge) won both the state and national award 35 years after the building was completed in 1975.\nList of award recipients\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" | Tasmania Enduring Architecture Awards (reverse order)\n|-\n!
