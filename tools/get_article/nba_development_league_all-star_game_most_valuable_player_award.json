The inaugural D-League All-Star Game was held in February 2007, and the inaugural All-Star Game MVP was Fort Worth Flyers forward Pops Mensah-Bonsu of the East team. By position, guards dominated the award with five winners, followed by forwards and centers with three each.\nIn 2018, the All-Star was replaced by the International Challenge and the Midseason All-NBA G League Team, and thus the All-Star Game MVP Award was retired.\nWinners\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#CFECEC;\" | †\n|Denotes the year two MVPs were named.\n|}\nwas the inaugural winner of the award.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
