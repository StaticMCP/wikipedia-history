Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural heritage consists of natural features (physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty. Azerbaijan ratified the convention on 16 December 1993.\nAzerbaijan has five sites on the list. The first site added to the list was the Walled City of Baku with the Shirvanshah's Palace and Maiden Tower, in 2000. Due to the damage sustained in the 2000 Baku earthquake, the site was listed as endangered from 2003 to 2009. The Gobustan Rock Art Cultural Landscape was listed in 2007. In 2013, these two sites were given enhanced protection status by the Committee for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. The most recent addition were the Hyrcanian forests and the cultural landscape of Khinalig, in 2023. This is the country's only natural site and is shared with Iran. In addition, Azerbaijan has ten sites on the tentative list.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\n}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Walled City of Baku with Shirvanshah's Palace and Maiden Tower\n| align=center|\n| Baku\n| 2000\n| 958; iv (cultural)\n| The urban ensemble of the Walled City of Baku demonstrates the influences of several cultures that were present in the area through history: Zoroastrian, Sassanian, Arabic, Persian, Shirvani, Ottoman, and Russian.
