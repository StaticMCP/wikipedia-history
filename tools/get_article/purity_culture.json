      "text": "# Purity culture\n\nPurity culture was a movement in the 1990s within Christianity which emphasized sexual abstinence before marriage.\nProminent in American Christian communities in the 1990s, purity culture emphasizes modest dress for women, strict gender roles, and discouragement of dating and masturbation (of women more than men), tying sexual behavior closely to spiritual identity and communal belonging. Practices like purity balls, virginity pledges, and purity rings reinforce these ideals, often fostering unhealthy expectations, emotional harm, and vulnerability to abuse. Though it faded in popularity after the 2000s, its influence persists both in the U.S. and abroad.\nComponents\nPurity culture places a strong emphasis on abstinence from sexual intercourse before marriage. Women and girls are told to cover up and dress modestly to avoid arousing sexual urges in men and boys. Purity culture also emphasizes traditional gender roles. Dating is discouraged entirely to avoid premarital sex. Masturbation is discouraged more strongly for women than for men. Purity cultures establish comprehensive moral systems in which sexual behavior is closely tied to spiritual identity, gender roles, and communal belonging. They can result in sexual violence that is characterised by the imposition of rigid and often unrealistic standards on individuals, often resulting in adverse physical, emotional and psychological consequences for those who do not conform to these expectations.\nAbstinence pledges\nPurity balls\nA purity ball is a formal dance event. The events are attended by fathers and their teenage daughters in order to promote virginity until marriage. Typically, daughters who attend a purity ball make a virginity pledge to remain sexually abstinent until marriage. Fathers who attend a purity ball make a promise to protect their young daughters' \"purity of mind, body, and soul.\" Proponents of these events believe that they encourage close and deeply affectionate relationships between fathers and daughters, thereby avoiding the premarital sexual activity that allegedly results when young women seek love through relationships with young men. Critics of the balls argue that they encourage and engrave dysfunctional expectations in the minds of the young women, making them vulnerable to believing their only value is as property, and teaching them that they must subjugate their own mental, physical, and emotional needs to that of abusive partners.\nPurity rings\nSince the 1990s Christian organizations, especially Catholic and evangelical Christian groups, promoting virginity pledges and virginity before marriage, like True Love Waits and Silver Ring Thing, used the purity ring as a symbol of commitment to purity culture.\nHistory\nPurity culture had been a facet of Christian writing for a while but purity culture as a youth movement took hold in the 1990s. A whole industry selling books, rings, and other products emerged around the movement.\nThe first purity ball was held in 1998.\nPurity culture faded out of popularity after the end of the 2000s.\nEffects and legacy\nPurity culture is largely an American phenomenon although exported abroad by American religious and government groups. It has also influenced groups like Girl Defined.\nSee also\n* Abstinence-only sex education\n* Antisexualism\n* Born-again virgin\n* Celibacy\n* Chastity\n* Chastity clubs in the United States\nReferences"
