He was Lord Lieutenant and Sheriff Principal of Selkirkshire, and a Lord-in-Waiting to Queen Victoria.\nHis father, Hugh Scott of Harden and Mertoun, had entered the House of Lords following his claim, by right of his mother, for the 1690 Scottish peerage of Lord Polwarth being admitted by them in July 1835. Henry assumed the additional surname of Hepburne in consequence of the estates of the Hepburns of Humbie having descended to him, through his great-great-grandmother, Helen Hepburn, Countess of Tarras.\nHarriet Brühl, the mother of the 7th Lord Polwarth, was the daughter of Alicia, Dowager Countess of Egremont, through her second marriage to Count Hans Moritz von Brühl.\nThe 7th Lord Polwarth married, on 28 December 1841, Georgina (1816&ndash;1859), sister of George Baillie-Hamilton, 10th Earl of Haddington and third daughter of George Baillie of Mellerstain House and Jerviswood by his spouse Mary, youngest daughter of Sir James Pringle, 4th Baronet.
