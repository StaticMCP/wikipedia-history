He was present at the execution of Myles Joyce at Galway jail in 1882.\nThe diligence of his activities brought him to the attention of the Dublin Castle administration in Ireland. Queries on Byrne's identity and exact motivations brought about very detailed physical and biographical details from the County Galway in Royal Irish Constabulary. However, the administration found that Byrne had no malicious intentions in his investigations.\nHe later became an editor of ''The Freeman's Journal and died after 1900.\nReferences\n* Edward Byrne: A Memoir, Frank Callanan, 1991.\n* Maamtrasna: The Murders and the Mystery'', Jarlath Waldron, 1992."
