The goal was to encourage the purchase of used clothes to mitigate the effects of the fashion manufacturing processes on the environment. There are several key aspects to the #haulternative campaign. These aspects are:\n*Love story: fall back in love with the things you already own\n*Broken & beautiful: share the story about an item of clothing that has become damaged or broken, but that you love and will cherish forever\n*Fashion fix: make your clothes last longer by repairing them when necessary\n*2hand: recreate your favorite looks for a fraction of the price by buying from your local charity shops\n*Swap: do a clothes swap with a friend\n*DIY: turn your clothes to become something new by tailoring clothes to a different shape, adding new embellishments, or dying it with a different colour\n*Vintage: going vintage gives you personal style and means you'll be reusing, repurposing and extending the life of beautiful clothes\n*Slow: appreciate the beauty and true value of the handmade fashion items\nThe movement was promoted mainly through YouTube where Fashion Revolution worked with YouTube fashion vloggers to promote purchase of used clothes. The #Haulternative campaign, in conjunction with The Daily Telegraph, features fashion vloggers filming themselves doing an alternative fashion haul. Haulers who participated included CutiePieMarzia, Noodlerella, Bip Ling, Grav3yardgirl, and Shameless Maya with combined views of 2 million on YouTube. Besides the promotion through YouTube, Fashion Revolution also promoted #Haulternative by creating events with seasonal second-hand clothing pop-up stores in selected cities. In November 2019, Fashion Revolution collaborated with student ambassadors at Glasgow Clyde College to take students on guided walking tours across different second-hand clothing shopping routes.\nFashion Revolution publications and podcasts\n'Fashion Transparency Index (2016 & 2017) ranks the biggest global fashion companies (40 in 2016, 100 in 2017) according to their level of transparency based on a questionnaire and publicly available information about supply chain issues.\nMoney, Fashion, Power (2017)' is a zine which comprises 72 pages of poetry, illustrations, photography, graphic design and editorials exploring the hidden stories behind clothing, pricing, and the purchasing power of consumers.

These were published in English and translated into Spanish, Finnish and other languages by Country Coordination teams.\nIn July 2015, a collection of social media postings showing how teachers and students got involved the Fashion Revolution was published on Pinterest, along with a 'who made my clothes?' film library, and a collection of 'imaginative ways in which the work of artists, activists and others can be used to inspire and engage people in the Fashion Revolution'.\nIn August 2016, three sessions were organized at the Annual Conference of the Royal Geographical Society (with Institute of British Geographers) conference in London with academic and activist speakers talking to the theme of \"Scholar activism and the Fashion Revolution: 'who made my clothes?'\" Session one focused on connecting producers and consumers, session two on slow sustainable fashion in practice and session three on engaging publics.\nIn June–July 2017, a free 3-week online course called 'Who Made My Clothes' was created in collaboration with the University of Exeter.

In an article written by The Guardian, Ruth Stokes, author of The Armchair Activist's Handbook, says that meaningful change in the fashion industry can start with a Fashion Revolution Day hashtag campaign, but must go beyond it.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://fashionrevolution.org/ Fashion Revolution website]"
