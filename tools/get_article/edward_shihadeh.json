Shihadeh is an American sociologist and criminologist. He is professor and chair of sociology at Louisiana State University (LSU) in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. At LSU, he also coordinates the Crime and Policy Evaluation Research Group, which he co-founded with Matthew Lee in 2005. He began his academic career in mathematical demography, but later became interested in researching crime and deviance as they pertained to urban black communities. He leads a team of researchers at LSU that analyze data from the Baton Rouge Area Violence Elimination (BRAVE), an organization that ran an inmate processing center that was shut down due to allegations of torturing and racial discrimination.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.lsu.edu/hss/sociology/people/faculty/faculty_profiles_new_2018/shihadeh_edward.php Faculty page]\n*[https://www.lsu.edu/hss/sociology/people/faculty/faculty_profiles_new_2018/cvs/shihadeh_cv_fall2018.pdf CV]"
