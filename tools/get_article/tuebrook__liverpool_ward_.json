A report of the Local Government Boundary Commission for England published in November 1978 set out proposals for changes to the wards of Liverpool City Council, maintaining the number of councillors at 99 representing 33 wards. Tuebrook ward was represented by three councillors.\nThe report describes the boundaries of Tuebrook ward as \"Commencing at a point where Prescot Road meets Balmoral Road, thence northwestwards along Balmoral Road to Whitcroft Road, thence northeastwards along said road to the road known as Elm Vale, thence northwestwards along said road to Carstairs Road, thence southwestwards along said road to Balmoral Road, thence northwestwards along said road to Gardner's Drive, thence westwards along said drive to Sheil Road, thence northwestwards along said road to the southern boundary of Anfield Ward, thence northeastwards along said boundary and northwestwards and northeastwards along the eastern boundary of said ward to the southwestern boundary of Clubmoor Ward, thence southeastwards, northeastwards and southeastwards along said boundary and continuing along Delamain Road to the road known as Mill Bank, thence eastwards along said road to the road known as Queens Drive West Derby, thence southeastwards along said road to Moscow Drive, thence, southwestwards along said drive and Lister Drive to the railway, thence southeastwards along said railway to Prescot Road, thence westwards along said road to the point of commencement\".\n2004 boundaries\nA review by the Boundary Committee for England recommended that the council was formed of a reduced number of 90 members elected from 30 wards. The ward was renamed as Tuebrook and Stoneycroft and was formed from the former Tuebrook ward with small parts of the former Anfield, Clubmoor, Croxteth, and Old Swan wards, and losing small areas elsewhere. The ward was part of the Liverpool West Derby Parliamentary constituency.\nThe ward boundaries followed Manningham Road, the northeastern property boundary of Curate Road and thereafter northeastwards along Townsend Lane, the Canada Dock Branch line, the midpoint of Pennsylvania Road, the southeastern property boundary of Worcester Drive, Maiden Lane, Lisburn Lane, Muirhead Avenue, Queens Drive, Derby Lane, the northern property boundary of Guernsey Road, Green Lane, Lister Drive, Gardiner's Drive, Sheil Road, Rocky Lane, between Rockhouse and Thurnham Streets, around and to include St Margaret's Primary School, Lower Breck Road, and Priory Road.\nThe population of the ward at the 2011 census was 16,489, and at the 2021 Census was 15,773.\n2023 elections\nFollowing a 2022 review by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England which decided that the existing 30 wards each represented by three Councillors should be replaced by 64 wards represented by 85 councillors, the ward was split up into the new Kensington & Fairfield, Tuebrook Breckside Park, Tuebrook Larkhill, Stoneycroft wards and a small section in Anfield ward.\nCouncillors\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Election!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor\n|-\n| 1998\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Hazel Williams (Lib)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| K.
