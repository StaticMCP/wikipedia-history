He is associated with the production of quota quickies. He directed several of Tod Slaughter's melodramas, including 1936's The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.\nCareer\nKing entered the film industry after completion of medical studies. His first film Too Many Crooks featured a young stage actor named Laurence Olivier, also making his film debut. Once launched from routine thrillers, King made the usual array of lightweight comedies, romances and thrillers. With the outbreak of war, King directed some distinctly up-market war movies, most successful of which was Candlelight in Algeria, a vehicle for James Mason. He was also successful with 1947's The Shop at Sly Corner, which introduced Diana Dors, featuring a charismatic performance by Oscar Homolka and a notable performance by Kenneth Griffith.\nFilmography\nDirector\n*Forbidden (1949)\n*The Shop at Sly Corner (1947)\n*Gaiety George (1946)\n*Candlelight in Algeria (1944)\n*Tomorrow We Live (1943)\n*George and Margaret (1940)\n*Two for Danger (1940)\n*The Case of the Frightened Lady (1940)\n*The Chinese Bungalow (1940)\n*Crimes at the Dark House (1940)\n*The Face at the Window (1939)\n*John Halifax (1938)\n*Sexton Blake and the Hooded Terror (1938)\n*Silver Top (1938)\n*Wanted!
