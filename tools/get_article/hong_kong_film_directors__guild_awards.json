It was established in 2006. The awards are presented at the Guild’s annual spring banquet, with winners selected through a one-person-one-vote system among all members. The Honorary Award, however, is only presented if it is endorsed by more than three-quarters of the members.\nThe list of award winners is typically announced in early March each year. Initially, the awards included only a few categories such as “Recommended Film of the Year,” “Outstanding Director of the Year,” and “New Performer of the Year.” Starting in 2013, the Guild shifted from its original focus on recommendation and encouragement to a more competitive model, introducing categories for Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best New Performer, and Best New Director. Beginning in 2024, new categories for Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress were added.\nBecause the Guild’s membership closely overlaps with the voting body of the Hong Kong Film Awards, the awards are often seen as a bellwether to the annual Hong Kong Film Awards.\nPast recipients\nBefore 2013\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!width=5%|Year\n!width=8%|Date of Ceremony\n!width=10%|Recommended Film of the Year\n!width=25%|Outstanding Director of the Year\n!width=25%|New Performer of the Year\n!width=25%|New Director of the Year\n!width=10%|Life Time Award\n|-\n|2005\n|\n|\n*Initial D,\n*Perhaps Love}}\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"3\"\n| rowspan=\"4\"\n|-\n|2006\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|2007\n|\n|\n|\n|'')}}\n|-\n|2008\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Derek Kwok (')\n|-\n|2009\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|King Cheung (')\n|Sammo Hung\n|-\n|2010\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Felix Chong (Once a Gangster)\n|\n|-\n|2011\n|\n|\n|\n| (Flying Swords of Dragon Gate)\n*Bronze: Shiga Lin (Lan Kwai Fong),\n*Jam Hsiao ()}}\n|Jessey Tsang (Big Blue Lake)\n|Ann Hui\n|-\n|2012\n|\n|}}\n| &  (Cold War)}}\n|Cherry Ngan (Nightfall)\n|Roy Chow (Nightfall)\n|Joe Cheung\n|}\nFrom 2013 to 2023\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!width=5%|Year\n!width=8%|Date of Ceremony\n!width=10%|Best Film\n!width=10%|Best Director\n!width=10%|Best Actor\n!width=10%|Best Actress\n!width=10%|Best New Performer\n!width=10%|Best New Director\n!width=10%|Jury's Special Award\n!width=10%|Honorary Award\n|-\n|2013\n|\n|The Grandmaster\n|Wong Kar-wai (The Grandmaster)\n|Tony Leung Chiu-wai (The Grandmaster)\n|Zhang Ziyi (The Grandmaster)\n|Babyjohn Choi (The Way We Dance)\n| (The Way We Dance)\n|Derek Kwok (As the Light Goes Out)\n|rowspan=\"2\"\n|-\n|2014\n|\n|The Golden Era\n|Ann Hui (The Golden Era)\n|Sean Lau (Overheard 3)\n|Tang Wei (The Golden Era)\n|Ivana Wong (Golden Chicken 3)\n|Ruby Yang (My Voice, My Life)\n|Chan Kwok-Hung\n|-\n|2015\n|\n|The Taking of Tiger Mountain\n|Tsui Hark (The Taking of Tiger Mountain)\n|Aaron Kwok (Port of Call)\n|Jessie Li (Port of Call)\n|Michael Ning (Port of Call)\n|Raman Hui (Monster Hunt)\n|Ten Years\n|Allen Fong\n|-\n|2016\n|\n|Trivisa\n|\n|Gordon Lam (Trivisa)\n|Kara Wai (Happiness)\n|Tony Wu (Weeds on Fire)\n|Wong Chun (Mad World)\n|rowspan=\"2\"\n|Michael Hui\n|-\n|2017\n|\n|Our Time Will Come\n|Sylvia Chang (Love Education)\n|Louis Koo (Paradox)\n|)}}\n|Rachel Leung (Somewhere Beyond the Mist)\n|Kearen Pang (29+1)\n|}}\n|-\n|2018\n|\n|Project Gutenberg\n|Felix Chong (Project Gutenberg)\n|Anthony Wong (Still Human)\n|Chloe Maayan (Three Husbands)\n|Crisel Consunji (Still Human)\n|Oliver Chan (Still Human)\n| ()\n|Ringo Lam\n|-\n|2019\n| (online announcement)\n|Better Days\n|Derek Tsang (Better Days)\n| (Suk Suk)\n|Zhou Dongyu (Better Days)\n|Terrance Lau (Beyond the Dream)\n|Norris Wong (My Prince Edward)\n| (Bamboo Theatre)\n|\n|-\n|2020\n| (online announcement)\n|Leap\n|Peter Chan (Leap)\n|Endy Chow (One Second Champion)\n|Gong Li (Leap)\n|Lydia Bai (Leap)\n| (Keep Rolling)\n|\n|Benny Chan\n|-\n|2021\n| (online announcement)\n|Raging Fire\n|Benny Chan (Raging Fire)\n|Patrick Tse (Time)\n|Cya Liu (Limbo)\n|Louise Wong (Anita)\n|Chan Kin-long (Hand Rolled Cigarette)\n|Jun Li (Drifting)\n|Johnnie To\n|-\n|2022\n|\n|\n|Wai Ka-fai (Detective vs Sleuths)\n|Sean Lau (Detective vs Sleuths)\n|Sammi Cheng ()\n| (The Sunny Side of the Street)\n| (The Sparring Partner)\n|\n|Joe Cheung\n|-\n|2023\n|\n|A Guilty Conscience\n|Soi Cheang (Mad Fate)\n|Tony Leung Chiu-wai (The Goldfinger)\n|Jennifer Yu (In Broad Daylight)\n|Yoyo Tse (Fly Me to the Moon)\n|Nick Cheuk (Time Still Turns the Pages)\n| ('')\n|Alex Law\n|}\nSince 2024\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!width=5%|Year\n!width=8%|Date of Ceremony\n!width=10%|Best Film\n!width=10%|Best Director\n!width=10%|Best Actor\n!width=10%|Best Actress\n!width=10%|Best Supporting Actor\n!width=10%|Best Supporting Actress\n!width=10%|Best New Performer\n!width=10%|Best New Director\n!width=10%|Jury's Special Award\n!width=10%|Honorary Award\n|-\n|2024\n|\n|Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In\n|Soi Cheang (Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In)\n|Michael Hui (The Last Dance)\n|Michelle Wai (The Last Dance)\n|Chu Pak Hong (The Last Dance)\n|Jo Kuk (Papa)\n|Dylan So (Papa)\n|Jill Leung (Last Song for You)\n|Robin Lee (Four Trails)\n|Wong Kar-wai\n|}\nReferences"
