It is named in honor of Masaru Ibuka, co-founder and honorary chairman of Sony Corporation. The award is currently given each year to an individual or a team of up to three people (although in 2002, it was given to five people). The award was established by the IEEE Board of Directors in 1987, and is sponsored by Sony Corporation.  The award is usually given in an awards ceremony at CES / IEEE ICCE in Las Vegas near the beginning of the year it is awarded.\nRecipients of this award receive a bronze medal, a certificate, and an honorarium.  The exact dimensions of the certificate are 11 by 14 inches (approx. ___ cm or mm) and comes in a folder measuring approximately 11.5 by 23.5 inches (approx. __ cm or mm) and is approximately 3/4 of an inch (approx. 19mm) thick when closed.  It is signed by the IEEE Secretary and the IEEE President.\nRecipients\nSource\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=80%\n!
