It aimed to encourage sharing information, assessing the evolution of trends, best practices and to de-conflict operations amongst counter-piracy actors in the Gulf of Aden, the Gulf of Oman and the Western Indian Ocean.\nThe first meeting was held in Bahrain in December 2008. It was attended by a variety of states and organizations involved in to counter piracy operations, such as the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) and EU NAVFOR Somalia.\nSince 2017 SHADE meets twice a year in Bahrain, chaired alternatively by CMF and EU NAVFOR Somalia. The international shipping industry is a key stakeholder in SHADE meetings.  International organizations active in the maritime domain in the region such as WFP and UNODC also attend the SHADE meetings.\nIn 2017 a similar platform, SHADE MED, was established in relation to maritime security operations working to prevent illegal immigration in the Mediterranean sea.\nOn the 3rd and 4 November 2020, CMF and EU NAVFOR Somalia co-hosted the 47th Shared Awareness and De-confliction (SHADE) Conference. It was the first occasion in 11 years, that this event was convened virtually, as a result of the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nReferences"
