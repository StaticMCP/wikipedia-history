The AVN Awards signed a contract with Virgin Hotels Las Vegas through the year 2023 to continue the event at the new location. The Daily Beast observed of the fact that the 37th AVN Awards was one of the last events held in the establishment, \"There is no more fitting end for the rock and roll-themed hotel than the festival of debauchery that is AVN Awards week, a four-day adult entertainment convention that ends with the racy 'Oscars of Porn.'\" Parties coinciding with the 37th AVN Awards included the Lair Fetish Party the day before, and the AVN Awards After Party the night of the event at the Vanity Night Club.\nPresenters\nPresenting the 37th AVN Awards were Emily Bloom and adult star Nikki Benz.

Doja Cat commented to AllHipHop, \"I’m honored and excited to be the second woman ever to perform at the AVN Awards.\" Journalist Rosario Harper noted for SOHH that Doja Cat was following in the footsteps of Kanye West and Cardi B following a trend of hip hop music stars headlining at the AVN Awards. Layla Halabian reviewed Doja Cat's fashion choice favorably for Nylon, \"In her latest move, the rapper performed at the 2020 AVN Adult Entertainment Awards in Las Vegas on January 25 in a truly unforgettable nude mesh bodysuit, complete with rhinestone silhouettes highlighting her nipples, butt, and that most maligned of body hair — pubes.\" Doja Cat performed songs from her 2019 album Hot Pink, including \"Juicy\", and \"Cyber Sex\".\nDJ Diplo featured musician Lil Pump in his performance. Lil Pump performed from his collaboration with Kanye West, titled, \"I Love It\". Jed Gregorio of the Inquirer commented favorably of Diplo's outfit at the event, \"Thomas Wesley a.k.a Diplo attended 'the only award show that matters this weekend' wearing probably the only outfit that, in fact, mattered this weekend.\" Gregorio observed, \"The event is question is the 2020 Adult Video News Awards in Las Vegas, where the DJ performed wearing a baby pink cowboy hat, a baby pink suit, and brown suede boots. The fit, fabricated by Union Western Clothing, features some delicious iconography, including a guy getting it on with a mermaid, some minotaur action, and anthropomorphic mushrooms.\" Union Western Clothing worked with Diplo in advance of the AVN Awards specifically to craft an outfit for the event itself.\nWinners and nominees\nMajor awards\nwon the night's main award, for Female Performer of the Year, becoming the first person to win this trophy three times in a row.]]\n, winner of the 2020 Best Actor Award]]\n, winner of the 2020 Best Supporting Actor Award]]\nAngela White won the night's main award, for Female Performer of the Year, becoming the first person to win this trophy three times in a row.

The AVN Awards and Expo featured over 1,000 stars from the adult entertainment sector. The Expo itself contained more than 400 exhibitors at the convention. The convention featured a musical performance by rapper and songwriter T-Pain. L.A. Weekly noted it was the \"largest porn industry gathering of its kind in the United States, featuring four days of events, panels and meetups, merch and memorabilia\".\nThe convention also featured lectures on topics related to the adult film industry. Lawyer D. Gill Sperlein presented in an AVN seminar on the litigation implications related to producing pornographic content. Sperlein commented, \"I think it's unlikely that there would be a conviction for obscenity.\" Sperlein observed regardless of legal merit, prosecutions were frequently sought against producers of adult film content,  and were \"done for political gain\". Sperlein asserted of prosecutors of such litigation, \"they don't care if they get a conviction or not.\" Decriminalize Sex Work organization staff member Kaytlin Bailey had a booth at the event to raise awareness to her cause; she stated the reaction to her issues was positive at the event, and discussed the stigma facing sex workers. The Free Speech Coalition and the Adult Performer Advocacy Committee handed out literature at the event supporting sex workers' rights. Sex educator and author Carol Queen attended the Expo, and presented a seminar on sex and technology impacting the industry. She commented regarding changing stigmas in society related to sex education and feminism.\nSee also\n*2020 in film\n*2020 in television\n*92nd Academy Awards\n*72nd Primetime Emmy Awards\n*2020 British Academy Television Awards\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*"
