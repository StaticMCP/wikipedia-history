The two armies fought fiercely and bravely until Addalu fell and was promptly beheaded by the Adalite soldiers. His men therefore fled, pursued by the Adalites who killed many Christians and took many others captives. Thousands of Christians were killed, including innumerable nobles and 3,000 cavalrymen, and some 200 noble men who were seized. The land was covered with corpses and blood ran like streams according to Arab Faqīh. The Imam then ordered all of the inhabitants of Bali to embrace Islam or be killed. Arab Faqih states that the entire land therefore embraced Islam and the Imam appointed a certain Umar as the province's governor.\nReferences"
