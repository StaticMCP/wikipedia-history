The whole process should now be sent back to the Security Council for a complete overhaul.\"\nEuropean Union\nFinland, which held the European Union's rotating presidency, issued the following statement:The European Union is greatly concerned about the disproportionate use of force by Israel in Lebanon in response to attacks by Hezbollah on Israel. The presidency deplores the loss of civilian lives and the destruction of civilian infrastructure. The imposition of an air and sea blockade on Lebanon cannot be justified.On 28 July 2006, a senior EU delegation threw its support behind the 7-point plan of Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora. Finnish Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja, representing the EU presidency, said Siniora's plan was a \"good basis to reach an agreement,\" and that he was \"struck by the unity of the Lebanese government.\"\nOn 8 August 2006, the EU issued a memo in which it outlined its response to the conflict.\nUnited Nations\nGeir Pedersen, the top UN official in Lebanon, said \"Hezbollah’s action escalates the already tense situation along the Blue Line and is an act of very dangerous proportions,\" in a statement. Jan Egeland, a top United Nations humanitarian official, said that the Israeli response is in violation of international law. He was equally critical of Hezbollah and Hamas for abducting Israeli soldiers, saying that those who had seized Israeli soldiers and fired rockets into Israel from southern Lebanon bore their share of the blame. Egeland also criticized Hezbollah for using the civilian population as cover, telling the BBC:I also clearly see that Hezbollah is trying to blend into the civilian population in too many places and they bear also a heavy responsibility for this. They do not seem to care that they really inflict a lot of suffering on their own population.UN Secretary General Kofi Annan demanded that Hezbollah immediately free the two captured Israeli soldiers, and sent a three-man party to the Middle East to urge countries to show restraint. On 17 July 2006, Annan and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair called for an international force to be sent to Lebanon to stop the attacks on Israel by Hezbollah. Blair said that the force could \"stop the bombardment coming over into Israel and therefore gives Israel a reason to stop its attacks on Hezbollah.\" On 19 July, Annan went on to condemn Israel's use of force: \"I condemn without reservations the attack in southern Lebanon, and demand that Israeli troops be released immediately.\" The next day, Annan demanded both sides stop all violence immediately, condemning Hezbollah for sparking the conflict but also attacking Israel for its \"excessive use of force.\"\nAccording to Annan, the \"three vital reasons\" for \"immediate cessation of hostilities\" were:\n# \"prevent further loss of innocent life and the infliction of further suffering;\"\n# \"to allow full humanitarian access to those in need;\" and\n# \"give diplomacy the chance to work out a practical package of actions that would provide a lasting solution to the current crisis.\"\nOn 26 July, the United States blocked the UN Security Council from issuing a statement that would have condemned Israel's bombing of a UN post on the Lebanon border that killed four military observers overnight.\nOn 29 July, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Jan Egeland appealed for a 72-hour truce to allow for humanitarian relief of the civilian population in Lebanon. This was later disputed by the Israelis, who said that all relief efforts were already ongoing. On 30 July, following the bombing of Qana by Israeli Air Force (IAF), Annan condemned the attack and urged the UN Security Council to also condemn it:We must condemn this action in the strongest possible terms, and I appeal to you [the Security Council] to do likewise.... The tragic events in Qana remind us that, ten years ago over 100 people who had taken refuge in this same village suffered a similar fate. We must deliver the region from this seemingly endless cycle of violence.\nOthers\n* At its Annual Ministerial Meeting in Kuala Lumpur, ASEAN delegates condemned the violence and destruction in the Middle East, urging all parties to practice utmost constrain in avoiding civilian casualties.\n* The Non-Aligned Movement has condemned what they claimed to be disproportionate Israeli attacks on Gaza and Lebanon and called for an international force to be deployed to prevent the violence from spiralling into a regional conflict.\n* The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation called for the convening of the U.N. General Assembly in \"emergency special session,\" under the terms of the \"Uniting for Peace\" resolution, if the Security Council failed to act immediately in the crisis.\nMiddle East\nEgypt\nPresident Mubarak of Egypt made a number of comments on the violence, condemning the Israeli military attack in Lebanon, while also indirectly criticizing Hezbollah for harming Arab interests. Mubarak, along with King Abdullah II of Jordan, criticized Hezbollah's actions as being harmful, saying that the actions may have \"the region being dragged into 'adventurism' that does not serve Arab interests.\" Mubarak was criticized for his statement on a 9 July television broadcast by Al Arabiya: \"Definitely Iran has influence on Shi'ites. Shi'ites are 65 percent of the Iraqis.... Most of the Shi'ites are loyal to Iran, and not to the countries they are living in.\"\nIn a newspaper interview with Egypt's Al Gomhuria on 26 July, Mubarak said:Those who urge Egypt to go to war to defend Lebanon or Hizbullah are not aware that the time of exterior adventures is over. This was possible at a time when the Egyptian population was only 24 million, but it is not possible now with 75 million citizens in need of development, services, job opportunities and residential projects.The next day, an interview with TIME magazine quoted Mubarak as saying that Israeli conduct in Lebanon \"went way too far\" and has \"triggered an increasing rage within the Arabs, Moslems and worldwide.\" The President is also reported to have told TIME:Military operations will not solve Israel's problems with Hizbullah. An immediate cease-fire is the utmost priority. Cessation of hostilities would create the environment conducive to addressing such problems in a candid manner. The bloodshed and the heavy toll of Israel's operations must be brought to an end.On July 13, Foreign Minister Aboul Gheit stated: \"Targeting civilians under the pretext of fighting terrorism is unacceptable and unjustified. Israeli practices violate international law. We condemn any military action that targets civilians. We consider it a terrorist act, regardless of who the civilians are or its source.\" Almost a week later, Gheit went on to say that \"[a] cease-fire is imperative and we have to keep working to reach that objective. It is imperative. We have to bring it to an end as soon as possible.\"\nIran\nOn 13 July, Foreign ministry spokesman Hamid-Reza Asefi condemned Israel's response: \"The Zionist regime is desperate because of the resistance put up by regional Muslim nations and is now resorting to blind tactics against the innocent people of Lebanon with full US backing.\" Iran also added that an Israeli attack against Syria would be considered an attack against the entire Muslim world, which would bring about a \"fierce response.\" Three days later, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was quoted as saying that the \"Zionists think that they are victims of Hitler, but they act like Hitler and behave worse than Genghis Khan.\"\nOn 27 July, Ahmadinejad stated that:\nNot only has the occupying regime [Israel] attacked and destroyed Lebanon under the support of certain countries, it has victimized several hundred women and children while thousands of people have been displaced escaping Israeli bombardment.\nIn an August 2006 speech during an emergency meeting of Muslim leaders in Malaysia, Ahmadinejad also called for an immediate cease-fire to end the fighting between Israel and the Iranian-backed group Hezbollah.\nDuring a visit to Beirut on 2 August, Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki, referring to the 'Rome convention' of late July, said: \"We consider those, who helped in preventing the Rome convention from condemning and stopping the attack, as partners to the Zionist entity in its savage crimes committed against innocent women and children in Lebanon.\"\nIraq\nOn 14 July, Iraqi Parliament Speaker Mahmoud Al-Mashhadani condemned Israeli attacks on Lebanon and called on both the UN Security Council and the international community to act, warning against the outcome for the region. Al-Mashhadani reportedly indicated that the \"attacks reflected Israel's disrespect of the international community and international agreements.\"\nHoshyar Zebari, the Iraqi Foreign Minister in the US-backed government, also represented Iraq at a closed session meeting in Cairo with Arab League Foreign Ministers on 15 July. The meeting was convened to discuss the possibility of a resolution on the conflict.\nIraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki is reported to have condemned Israel during the conflict, saying: \"We call on the world to take quick stands to stop the Israeli aggression\" and \"[Israel's] excessive use of force is to be condemned.\"\nSaudi Arabia\nA Saudi official, quoted by the Saudi Press Agency on 13 July, was critical of Hezbollah guerrillas—without naming them—of \"uncalculated adventures\" that precipitated the latest Middle East crisis: A difference should be drawn between legitimate resistance and rash adventures carried out by elements inside the state and those behind them without consultation or coordination with Arab countries.... The Kingdom sees that it is time for those elements alone to shoulder the full responsibility for this irresponsible behavior and that the burden of ending the crisis they have created falls on them alone.\nSyria\nVice President Farouk al-Sharaa said that Israel is responsible for the conflict, due to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. The Syrian Baath Party has also expressed its solidarity and support with Hezbollah. Syria's military had been put on high alert. Syria's president Bashar al-Assad had also released a statement, saying:The occupying enemy hasn't forgotten the humiliating defeat and its submissive exit from south Lebanon under the strikes bold resistance.… Syria, which stood by its brother (Lebanon) and sacrificed martyrs to defend Lebanon's freedom as we did for Syria's sovereignty, remains as always adamant in standing by our Arab people who's fighting in Lebanon and Palestine, and by the bold national resistance who struck the enemy. All threats voiced by powers in the world who support the enemy won't deter us from continuing to support our brothers…because we believe that falling for the sake of heaven (martyrdom) is the only way to freedom and victory. We have to make all effort in training to save every drop of blood when the hour comes. The fighting continues so long our land is occupied and our rights are denied. Victory will be achieved God willing.… [T]he Israeli enemy continues its extermination war against our proud peoples in Lebanon and Palestine. Our brothers in Lebanon are being subjected to aggression by the Israeli war machine from the air, the sea and the ground.… The aggression, killing and destruction committed by the Israelis in Lebanon are part of an operation that was planned and organized by the large forces dominating the international community.\nOthers\n* Jordan: A statement from the Jordanian Government said: \"Jordan stands against whoever exposes the Palestinian people and their cause, Lebanon and its sovereignty to unexpected dangers. Israel's use of force against unarmed civilians and the outcome in terms of the human loss and destruction of civil institutions.\" Jordan has also denounced Hezbollah's actions believing them to be harmful to Arab interests in the region.\n* Kuwait: After receiving Lebanese Member of Parliament and Head of Future Block Saad Rafiq Al-Hariri, Prime Minister Sheikh Nasser Al-Mohammed Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah expressed solidarity with Lebanon, and condemned what it cited as \"Israeli aggression on the Lebanese people.\"\n* Palestinian Authority: Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas described Israel's incursion as the start of an escalation to a large-scale Middle East war. He urged World Powers \"to stop this serious deterioration.\"\n* Yemen: The ruling party, General People's Congress strongly condemned the actions of which it considered to be aggressions against the Palestinians and the Lebanese and called for the international community to intervene. Other political parties have also condemned the Israelis, and announced their support for the Palestinian and Lebanese people \"in their fight for their right of survival and defeating occupier.\" They also called for the closing of Israeli embassies in Arab countries.\nAsia\nArmenia\nForeign minister Vardan Oskanyan issued a statement:Armenia is extremely concerned about the military actions in Lebanon and their escalation, as well as the great loss of civilian life.… Armenia condemns any violence whether it be abduction or use of force.… We particularly denounce the use of such disproportionate force intended solely to collectively punish civilians and damage infrastructure. This kind of reaction by Israel is particularly difficult to understand given the fact that the Lebanese government has clearly distanced itself from the abduction incident. We hope that there will be restraint in the region and also hope there will be an immediate ceasefire so that the issues can be addressed by peaceful means.\nChina\nForeign minister Li Zhaoxing urged all parties concerned to keep restraint to avoid further deterioration of the situation, expressing his close attention to and deep concern over the conflict. After a Chinese U.N. observer was killed when a U.N. observation post in Lebanon was hit during an Israeli airstrike, China called for an Israeli apology and demanded that Israel stop bombing U.N. positions. China asked the U.N. Security Council to strongly condemn the Israeli bombing and the permanent representative of China in U.N. implied that U.S. resistance in allowing such condemnation would affect China's position in the nuclear program of Iran.[http://www.mpinews.com/htm/INews/20060728/ta50724w.htm 明報即時新聞 – 安理會對以軍空襲表示震驚[07:24&#93;]\nThe Security Bureau of Hong Kong reminded Hong Kong residents in Lebanon and Israel to keep abreast of latest developments and pay attention to personal safety.\nIndia\nThe Ministry of External Affairs expressed concern over the growing tensions in Lebanon and urged all parties to end the violence in favor of peaceful negotiation, issuing the following statement: \"We are seriously concerned about the escalating tension in West Asia as a result of developments on the Israel-Lebanese border since yesterday which have the potential to inflame the region further and widen the conflict.\"\nOn 27 July 2006, India made a statement condemning Israel’s \"disproportionate and excessive use of force\" in Lebanon, but simultaneously criticized Hezbollah for kidnapping two Israeli soldiers. In a statement to Parliament, Junior Foreign Minister Anand Sharma demanded an immediate cessation to hostilities, saying Lebanon had become a \"victim by default.\"\nIndonesia\nPresident Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono stated that \"Indonesia has repeatedly called on Israel to stop its military action.... [T]he United Nations has to take action to prevent the conflict from escalating.\" Earlier, Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda said, \"We condemn the military actions that have killed many innocent civilians.\" Indonesia also warned the United States that supporting Israel in the conflict may lead to a rise in Islamic fundamentalism, making it more difficult for Muslim states to fight radical Islam. Indonesian foreign minister Hassan Wirajuda likewise expressed fears that even moderate muslims may become radical.\nJapan\nPrime Minister Junichiro Koizumi urged restraint, stating: \"I understand the anger of the Israelis, but I hope you will not seek an eye for an eye and keep in mind the importance of peace.\" On 31 July, as Japan condemned the Israeli air strike in Qana and called for a ceasefire, Koizumi went on to say that \"it is truly deplorable that innocent people are falling victim day after day.\"\nLikewise, Chief Cabinet secretary Shinzo Abe said:It is extremely regrettable that this kind of incident occurred amid international calls on Israel to exercise self-restraint. We call on the parties concerned to make a cease-fire, while seeking sincere and utmost efforts by all countries concerned to resolve the problem in order to prevent civilian casualties and not to further worsen the situation.\nKazakhstan\nKazakh officials have called upon the UN Security Council to adopt a consolidated resolution on the escalation of conflict in Lebanon. Press Secretary of the Kazakh Foreign Ministry Ilyas Omarov stated:Kazakhstan calls the conflicting parties to an immediate ceasefire and considers it necessary that the UN Security Council adopt a consolidated resolution on the escalation of conflict in Lebanon.… We deeply regret about the continuing escalation of the conflict causing sufferings of the peaceful population of Lebanon, Palestine, and Israel. Kazakhstan believes that military actions should not cause casualties among peaceful population or demolition of social infrastructure, as well as a humanitarian crisis.… A decision of Israel to suspend the air strikes for 48 hours must become a first step on the way to cessation of military actions in the region.\nMalaysia\nDato' Seri Syed Hamid Albar, Malaysia's Minister of Foreign Affairs, condemned \"the unlawful airstrikes by Israel\" and \"the irresponsible use of force by Israel on Lebanon\" causing \"hardship and suffering to [Lebanon's] people.\" Malaysia urged Israel to \"cease all military action,\" and called \"upon the international community to intervene.\" On 20 July, Albar told the press that Malaysia was considering plan to deploy peacekeepers to Lebanon.\nDuring an emergency meeting of Muslim leaders by the Organisation of the Islamic Conference on 3 July, chairman Dato' Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi called for the convening of the United Nations General Assembly in 'emergency special session', under the terms of the \"Uniting for Peace\" resolution, if the Security Council failed to act immediately in the crisis.\nOn 5 August, Malaysia rejected plans for a dialogue with Israel to resolve the crisis on grounds of no diplomatic ties between the two nations.\nPakistan\nPakistan's Foreign Ministry has expressed outrage over \"Israeli aggression against Lebanon and Palestine,\" releasing the following statement: This attack is a flagrant violation of Lebanese sovereignty and contravenes the norms and principles of the UN charter. The aerial bombardment of Beirut airport and the naval blockade of Lebanese waters announced by the Israeli government represents a dangerous escalation.  We have also watched with deep concern the Israeli attacks on Gaza that have resulted in enormous losses in life and property.The statement also said that \"the latest Israeli aggression against Palestinian territories and Lebanon have undermined hopes and efforts for peace in the region,\" arguing that \"the situation demands restraint and a return to diplomacy and negotiations.\"\nOn 16 July, Pakistan condemned the violence being committed by Israel against Lebanon and urged that attacks resulting in loss of life and property must be stopped immediately. Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz expressed these views while talking to his Lebanese counterpart Fouad Siniora: \"Pakistan appeals to the world community, the permanent members of the Security Council, the UN and other international bodies to intervene,\" Aziz said, adding that Pakistan stood by the people of Lebanon and respected their sovereignty and territorial integrity.\nTajikistan\nTajikistan denounced Israel's attacks on Lebanon on 27 July, together with Iran and Afghanistan. Tajik President Emomali Rahmonov stated:We are seriously concerned about the deteriorating security conditions in the Middle East, particularly more so due to Israel's attack against Lebanon that has claimed the lives of hundreds of innocent civilians so far.… We hereby ask for an immediate end to those attacks, and the solving of the dispute through negotiations.… According to latest reports, most of the victims of Israeli attacks are the Lebanese children, youngsters, women, and elderly folks.\nOthers\n* Afghanistan: On 27 July, the US-backed government of Afghanistan, together with Iran and Tajikistan denounced Israel's attacks against Lebanon. Afghan President Hamid Karzai stated: \"We feel sad about the death of dozens of civilians in Lebanon and ask for solving the crisis through diplomatic channels.\"\n* Bangladesh: The Foreign Ministry of Bangladesh condemned the Israeli attacks and called them State Terrorism. Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Morshed Khan urged Western nations to \"restrain Israel,\" and accused many Western countries of applying a double standard in favor of Israel when dealing with the Middle East. Bangladesh sent Infantry battalions to Lebanon to serve as UN peacekeepers in the immediate aftermath of the war. Troops from Bangladesh and Nepal were the first to arrive in Southern Lebanon. The Bangladesh Navy has one Mod. Type 053H class FF(G) and one Sea Dragon class OPV as part of the Maritime Task Force.\n* Philippines: Filipino President Arroyo had urged stranded OFWs to leave Lebanon at once. Several lawmakers had also voiced support for a ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israeli forces, indicating a condemnation to Israel.\n* Vietnam: The Foreign Ministry of Vietnam condemned Israel's air strike on Qana. Le Dung, a spokesman for the Ministry, further stated that \"Vietnam calls upon all related sides to cease fire immediately and to demonstrate restraint to avoid causing harm to civilians.\"\nEurope and Oceania\nEurope\nAustralia\nPrime Minister John Howard has stated that he is \"appalled at the loss of life on both sides.\" However, he blamed the conflict on Hezbollah's breaches of UN resolutions and international law.\nAmericas\nBrazil\nThe foreign ministry issued a statement saying that the Brazilian government was \"dismayed\" at the deaths of four Brazilians from the same family, including two children, killed by an Israeli attack while vacationing in Lebanon. Brazil condemned both sides escalating into a bigger conflict. In another statement confirming the death of another Brazilian child in a separate Israeli attack, it also called Israeli actions disproportionate. It urged South Lebanon to recognize Israel's boundaries. Additionally, Brazil called for dialogue between the parties so that a cease-fire can be achieved and the kidnapped Israeli soldiers can be released.\nCanada\nPrime Minister Stephen Harper said he did not favour sending Canadian troops to southern Lebanon as part of a multinational peacekeeping force, adding that countries in the area should be responsible for resolving the conflict.\nAt the outset of the conflict, Harper said \"Israel has the right to defend itself,\" adding the opinion that \"Israel's response under the circumstances has been measured.\" Harper's characterisation of Israel's response as \"measured\" created controversy in Canada. On 17 July 2006, the Prime Minister appeared to moderate these remarks, noting that the situation had deteriorated since his initial comments, but that it was difficult for Israel to fight \"non-governmental forces\" when they are embedded in the civilian population. He added that \"the attack [on Israel] is the cause of this immediate conflict,\" and that \"Israel must show restraint as part of the solution but it is essential that the attacks against Israel would stop and it is essential that Israeli soldiers be returned to Israel.\"\nRegarding resolution to the conflict, Harper stated it is \"essential that Hezbollah and Hamas release their Israeli prisoners and any countries in that area that have influence on these organizations should encourage an end to violence and recognize and encourage the recognition of Israel's right to exist.\" Speaking of the situation in both Lebanon and Gaza on 18 July, Harper told reporters, \"We all want to encourage not just a ceasefire, but a resolution. And a resolution will only be achieved when everyone gets to the table and everyone admits that recognition of each other,\" referring to the refusal of Hezbollah and Hamas to recognize Israel's right to exist.\nHarper laid the blame for the civilian deaths on both sides at the feet of Hezbollah:Hezbollah's objective is violence.… Hezbollah believes that through violence it can create, it can bring about the destruction of Israel. Violence will not bring about the destruction of Israel…and inevitably the result of the violence will be the deaths primarily of innocent people.Harper and his former Foreign Affairs Minister, Peter MacKay, reiterated their support for Israel's position, while urging restraint and calling for a ceasefire.\nOn 6 August 2006, Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe was accused of supporting Hezbollah by Israel's ambassador to Canada, Alan Baker, after Duceppe participated in a march in Montreal protesting the war in Lebanon.\nThe National Post asserted later in 2006 that, of the 15,000 Canadians evacuated, about 7,000 may have returned to Lebanon within a month of being evacuated, part of the public discussion of Canadians of convenience.\nPublic opinion\nToronto, Ontario.]]\nOpinions on the conflict are mixed in Canada, as is reflected by the editorial content of the nation's media. Some outlets, such as the Toronto Star, have criticized Israel's response to Hezbollah's actions as disproportionate, while other publications such as the National Post, have come out in support of the scope of Israel's military action and the position the Canadian government has taken, and have criticized those who have called the evacuation of Canadians in the region too slow.  Commentators in other outlets (e.g., The Globe and Mail and the CBC) have represented a variety of views.\nCanada has a large Lebanese community. About 30,000 Canadians, mainly of Lebanese descent, were in Lebanon at the time hostilities broke out, and the Canadian government has been making efforts to evacuate those who wish to leave in an operation that has been criticized for being slow and inefficient. On 17 July, a group of protesters, primarily expatriate Lebanese, gathered in front of the Israeli consulate in Montreal and protested the continued bombing in Lebanon. Further protests took place on 22 July in localities across Canada.\nA poll of Canadians published in the 25 July edition of the National Post shows that support among Canadians (bar Quebec) was greatly on the side of Israel, with 64% stating that \"Israel's action was either somewhat or completely justified.\" In all provinces except Quebec, support was greater than 50%, with British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Alberta, and Ontario having the highest support for Israel (in that order). When asked which side of the conflict should make a major compromise in order to have a ceasefire, 63% of Canadians said it was \"those who kidnapped the Israeli soldiers.\"\nUnited States\nBush, Rice and Stephen Hadley discuss the situation at Bush's ranch.\nFollowing the Zar'it-Shtula incident, the United States government condemned what it called Hezbollah's \"unprovoked act of terrorism,\" and called for the \"immediate and unconditional release\" of the soldiers.\nThe United States government has blamed Hezbollah and Syria for the crisis. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs David Welch condemned what he called a \"dangerous escalation\" and calls for the release of the Israeli soldiers. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist said, \"We must hold the governments of Syria and Iran accountable for their continued support to Hezbollah. So long as these governments are failing to live up to their responsibilities, no one should question the right of the government of Israel to act in self-defense against terrorists operating from Lebanon.\" Frist also said that the Lebanese government should uphold its responsibility under a United Nations resolution to make sure its territory isn't being used for Hezbollah or other groups. President George W. Bush said \"I want the world to address the root cause of the problem, and the root cause of the problem is Hezbollah.\"\nBush remarked on 13 July that Israel has the right to defend itself.[https://archive.today/20130205172701/http://www.voanews.com/english/13 July 2006-voa6.cfm Bush: 'Israel Has Right to Defend Itself'] He also said that the \"democracy of Lebanon is an important part of laying a foundation of peace in that region,\" and that the \"concern is that any activities by Israel to protect herself will weaken the (Siniora) government.\"\nThe Bush administration openly rejected what it considered to be meaningless calls for a ceasefire in escalating Mideast violence, as White House spokesman Tony Snow argued that President Bush \"is not going to make military decisions for Israel.\" On 18 July 2006, according to the New York Times, US and Israeli officials agreed for the bombings to continue for another week. \"Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice rejected an immediate ceasefire and said one could only occur once certain conditions are met.\" John Bolton, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, rejected the call for a ceasefire, stating that it is simplistic to think that one can \"just declare a ceasefire and act as if that is going to solve the problem.\" On 15 July 2006, according to U.S. unilateral opposition in the UN Security Council, \"the United Nations Security Council again rejected pleas from Lebanon that it call for an immediate cease-fire between Israel and Lebanon. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported the U.S. was the sole member of the 15-nation UN body to oppose any council action at all at this time.\nOn 15 July, the United States sent a security team to Beirut in an effort to begin planning the evacuation of American citizens from Lebanon to Cyprus. The US was believed to be using the facilities at the British Sovereign Base Areas on Cyprus, which included RAF Akrotiri.\nOn 17 July, in a private conversation that was unintentionally picked up by a live microphone at the G8 conference, Bush told UK Prime Minister Tony Blair that \"We’re not blaming Israel and we’re not blaming the Lebanese government.\" Bush asked \"What about Kofi Annan? I don't like the sequence of it. His attitude is basically cease-fire and everything else happens,\" to which Blair responded, \"I think the thing that is really difficult is you can't stop this unless you get this international presence agreed.\" Bush reasserted his view that the impetus needed to be placed on Hezbollah to end the conflict: \"What they need to do is get Syria to get Hezbollah to stop doing this shit, and it's over.\"\nAt the G8 Summit, President Bush said that \"the root of the problem is Hezbollah\" and that the U.S. is \"never going to tell a nation how to defend herself.\" On 15 July, Bush called upon Syria to exert its influence over Hezbollah militants to get them to \"lay down their arms,\" adding that only Israel should try to limit civilian casualties as it steps up attacks on its neighbor. \"The soldiers need to be returned.... It's really sad where people are willing to take innocent life in order to stop that progress (for peace). As a matter of fact, it's pathetic.\" As President Bush stated,\nEverybody abhors the loss of innocent life. On the other hand, what we recognize is that the root cause of the problem is Hezbollah. And that problem must be addressed. And it can be addressed internationally by making it clear to Syria that they've got to stop their support to Hezbollah. Syria's trying to get back into Lebanon, it looks like to me.... Sometimes it requires tragic situations to help bring clarity in the international community. And it is now clear for all to see that there are terrorist elements who want to destroy our democratic friends and allies, and the world must work to prevent them from doing so.\nBolton said there was no moral equivalence between the civilian casualties from the Israeli raids in Lebanon and those killed in Israel from \"malicious terrorist acts.\" Asked to comment on the deaths in an Israeli air strike of eight Canadian citizens in southern Lebanon, Bolton said that it is a matter of great concern to us...that these civilian deaths are occurring.\" He added that \"it's a tragedy.... I think it would be a mistake to ascribe moral equivalence to civilians who die as the direct result of malicious terrorist acts,\" while he defended Israel's military action as \"self-defense,\" which has had \"the tragic and unfortunate consequence of civilian deaths.\"\nAs the campaign in Lebanon began, on 14 July, the US Congress was notified of a potential sale of $210 million worth of jet fuel to Israel. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency noted that the sale of the JP-8 fuel, should it be completed, will \"enable Israel to maintain the operational capability of its aircraft inventory,\" and \"The jet fuel will be consumed while the aircraft is in use to keep peace and security in the region.\" It was reported on 24 July that the United States was in the process of providing Israel with \"bunker buster\" bombs, which would allegedly be used to target the leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah guerrilla group and destroy its trenches. According to Reuters and the New York Times, the Bush administration authorized the expedited processing and shipment of precision-guided bombs (already allotted for sale in 2005) to Israel to support the Israeli campaign, but did not announce the increased haste publicly.\nOn 25 July, Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's secretary general, said the Israeli onslaught was an attempt by the US and Israel to \"impose a new Middle East\" in which Lebanon would be under US hegemony.\nOn 30 July, immediately following the IAF bombing of Qana in which a large number of fatalities took place, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice reportedly stated:\"We [the United States Government] want a ceasefire as soon as possible, I would have wanted a ceasefire yesterday if possible, but the parties have to agree to a ceasefire and there have to be certain conditions in place... Any ceasefire has to have circumstances that are going to be acceptable to the parties.\"\nRice's comments came after an earlier television address by the Lebanese Prime Minister in which he indicated that the meetings scheduled with Rice that day were cancelled due to the events at Qana.\nIn sharp contrast to public policy, however, 65% of Americans said that \"the U.S. [should] stay out of the situation\" between Israel and Hezbollah.\n;Congress\nOn 18 July, the US Senate passed S.Res. 534 98-0 by unanimous consent, \"Condemning Hezbollah and Hamas and their state sponsors and supporting Israel's exercise of its right to self-defense.\" Resolution 534 calls for the release of Israeli soldiers who are being held captive by Hezbollah or Hamas; condemns the governments of Iran and Syria for their continued support for Hezbollah and Hamas; urges all sides to protect innocent civilian life and infrastructure; and strongly supports the use of all diplomatic means available to free\nthe captured Israeli soldiers. However, Senator Chuck Hagel eventually came to demand that the U.S. impose a ceasefire.\nOn 20 July 2006, the US House of Representatives passed resolution 921 supporting Israel's right to defend itself and condemning attacks against the State of Israel. The final vote was 410 to 8 in favour of the resolution.\nOn 30 July, Congress sent a letter to the EU's Head of Foreign Policy Javier Solana, asking that the EU add Hezbollah to its list of illegal terrorist organisations.  The letter was signed by 210 members of Congress.\n\"We were dismayed to hear your 19 July assertion that the EU lacked 'sufficient data' to add Hizbullah to its terrorist list.\"\nMembers of Congress had already called on the EU, via a 2005 resolution, to add Hezbollah to the list. The EU declined all requests.\nVenezuela\nAli Rodriguez, Foreign Minister of Venezuela, condemned Israel activities in Lebanon.\nOn 3 August, Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez declared he has withdrawn his country's ambassador from Israel to show his indignation over the military offensive in Lebanon. He called the Israeli attacks in Lebanon \"genocide\". He also spoke after returning from an international tour that included Iran. While there, Chávez called the Israeli offensive in Lebanon a \"fascist outrage.\"\nOn 9 August, it was known that Venezuela is likely to sever ties with Israel in protest at its war against Lebanon, according to statements by President Hugo Chávez. \"They have also recalled their ambassador and our next step will most likely be to break off diplomatic relations. I have no interest in maintaining diplomatic relations, or offices, or businesses, or anything with a state like Israel.\".\nOn 25 August, Reuters reported that Chávez had called for Israeli leaders to face a trial for genocide over killing in the Lebanon conflict.  Speaking from Beijing, Chávez said the Jewish state had \"done something similar or, perhaps worse, who knows, than what the Nazis did\".\nAfrica\nSomalia\nIn Somalia, the Islamic Courts Union sent men to aid Hezbollah. ICU commander Aden Hashi Farah handpicked 720 veteran fighters. While most were veterans of the Somali Civil War, some had fought in Afghanistan.

AIPAC issued a statement Friday following the signing of the letter in Congress, saying that:\"If the European Union is serious about its support for international measures calling for Hizbullah's disarmament, designating Hizbullah a terrorist organization is a necessary step in that process.\"\nThe EU declined the requests.\nAIPAC also had a role in defending the Israeli war effort to the American public. A 27 July memo issued by AIPAC titled \"Beirut Largely Unscathed as Israel Targets Hezbollah Strongholds,\" advanced the idea that through \"surgical strike\" bombing the damage reported in other media was exaggerated.  AIPAC asserted that following IDF bombing of the southern districts of Beirut,\"an overwhelming majority of the city remains untouched.\"\nOn 2 August AIPAC asserted in a press release titled \"The Bekka (sic) Valley: A Terrorist Epicenter\", that the Bekaa valley area under bombardment by the IDF at that time was home to a number of anti-Israel factions. AIPACs middle east analyst, Josh Block was quoted in the press release as saying:\"[It's] similar to a university setting, terrorists from every corner of the international community have come together in the Bekaa Valley training camps to learn how to conduct lethal operations and utilize various types of weapons.\" AIPAC then went on to list the groups it believed were operating from the region which included the Red Army Faction, Red Brigade, and the Japanese Red Army. One commentator remarked:\"Much of the material cited by AIPAC to back up the press release is of dubious veracity, and the information that links these terrorist groups to the Bekaa Valley region is years or even decades old... AIPAC's goal, it seems to me, is to demonstrate that Israel's campaign in Lebanon is targeting an international, globally-linked terrorist alliance that threatens not only the Jewish state, but the West in general.\"\nChristians United for Israel\nThere were also calls of support from a second Zionist focused lobby grouping headed by John Hagee the founder and senior pastor of the 18,000-member evangelical Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas.  Hagee, author of \"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World\", had engaged in meetings with various congress members and launched a Christian pro-Israel lobby which he said would rival AIPAC. The five-month-old, 3,000 strong pro-Israel evangelical group Christians United for Israel (CUFI) attended a \"Washington/Israel summit\" during the week beginning 17 July in an effort to lobby for greater congressional and senate support for Israel, and the Israeli war effort.  Hagee was also reportedly setting up an \"Israel Rapid Response\" network of e-mails, faxes and phone calls to mobilize voters.  Over the years, Hagee has reportedly donated $8.5 million US to support Israeli hospitals and orphanages and has helped 12,000 Russian Jews move to Israel.\nReferences"
