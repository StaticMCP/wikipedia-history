The killings were associated with the Colonial Parkway, a 22-mile-long thoroughfare that cuts through the Colonial National Historical Park and connects Jamestown, Williamsburg and Yorktown where the first two victims were found dead inside a vehicle, and a vehicle driven by another couple who are missing and presumed dead was found. Long stretches of the road are devoid of any streetlights and are extremely isolated, making it a popular lovers' lane location frequented by young adults.\nIn each incident, a young couple sitting in a vehicle was targeted, with both partners killed. Three pairs of victims were recovered, and another couple remains missing and presumed dead. Several additional homicides have also been tentatively linked to the four confirmed cases. The causes of death included strangulation, gunshot and stabbing. The killer or killers drove victims’ vehicles away from the murder sites. The linking of the four crimes is circumstantial.\nIn January 2024, authorities announced that at least two of the murders had been conclusively linked to an official suspect, Alan Wilmer Sr., a local fisherman who died in 2017. He was also linked through DNA evidence to the previously unrelated murder of Teresa Lynn Spaw Howell. Wilmer has been described as \"suspect number one\" in two of the canonical murders but was freed after passing an FBI polygraph test.\nDespite his status as a suspected serial killer,  Wilmer's DNA was not entered into the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), the US's national DNA database.\nConfirmed and suspected victims\n(green) was the site of the Dowski-Thomas and the Hailey-Call vehicle recoveries. Powell and also Hailey-Call were last seen near Route 17 (black), the thoroughfare adjacent to site of the Knobling-Edwards murder and vehicle recovery.  Two victims, first Pettinger and later Howell, were last seen on Mercury Boulevard (blue). A rest area on Interstate 64 (red)''' was the site of the Phelps-Lauer vehicle recovery; their bodies were found nearby.]]\nRebecca Dowski and Cathy Thomas\nThe first known victims in the Colonial Parkway killings were Cathleen Marian \"Cathy\" Thomas (27), a United States Naval Academy graduate, and College of William & Mary senior Rebecca Ann “Becky” Dowski (21), a business management major working as a stockbroker. The lesbian couple disappeared after leaving a computer lab on the William & Mary campus at around 6:30 p.m. on October 9, 1986. Thomas ventured onto the Colonial Parkway in the past to be alone with romantic partners.\nOn October 12, between 5:30 and 5:45 a.m., a jogger discovered a white 1980 Honda Civic at the bottom of an embankment at the Cheatham Annex Overlook, seven miles east of Williamsburg. The Civic had veered off the road and into thick, dense shrubbery only a few feet from a 15-foot drop into the York River. A highway patrolman called to the scene discovered Thomas and Dowski's bodies inside the vehicle.\nAn autopsy found rope burns on both women's necks and wrists, as well as signs of strangulation. Their throats had been slashed so deeply that they were nearly decapitated. The killer had covered the bodies and vehicle with diesel fuel but had not lit them on fire. Over 100 latent and full prints were found on the interior and exterior of the Civic, but they matched no one in police records. Dowski's body was found in the backseat, while Thomas' was found stuffed into the hatchback. Thomas apparently struggled with her attacker, as a clump of hair was later found between her fingers. Both women were fully clothed and there was no evidence of sexual assault. Authorities ruled out robbery as a motive, since both women's purses were in the vehicle, and no money or jewelry had been taken.\nAt that time police believed that the murders happened elsewhere, as there was not much blood in the car itself. In November 1986, just weeks after the murder, press reported that FBI profilers were constructing a profile of the person or persons responsible for the murders.  In 2024, Bill Thomas recalled that four days after his sister Cathy's death, the FBI suggested to him that the perpetrator may have been a member of law enforcement.\nDavid Knobling and Robin Edwards\nIn 1988, salesman David Lee Knobling (20) and eighth-grade student Robin Margaret Edwards (14) were murdered. Edwards and Knobling met on September 19 when Knobling agreed to drive his younger cousin on a date with Edwards to see the film Dragnet (1987). Knobling left his home around midnight, while Edwards left hers half an hour later. A group of teenagers partying on Ragged Island until 2:00 a.m. reported no sign of Knobling's truck. The vehicle, a black Ford Ranger, had previously been discovered on September 21 by a patrolman at the Ragged Island Wildlife Refuge's parking area, with the wipers and radio on and the engine running, and some articles of clothing inside. Both doors were open, and the driver's side window was partially rolled down, causing police to speculate that the perpetrator either was or had been posing as a uniformed officer. Knobling's wallet was found inside the pickup, which ruled robbery out as motive.\nOn September 23, the bodies of Knobling and Edwards were found after being washed ashore with the tide about 100 feet apart on the bank of the James River. Both victims had been shot; Edwards in the back of the head execution-style, and Knobling twice, once in the head and once in the shoulder. Both were partially clothed; Edwards was found with her jeans unfastened and her bra around her neck. Investigators were unsure if a sexual assault had taken place since, despite Edwards being underage, it was presumed that she and Knobling had a sexual relationship. The state police later said she was assaulted.\nAuthorities suspected a connection between the double-murder of Knobling and Edwards to that of Dowski and Thomas. Although the former deaths did not occur on the Colonial Parkway, both sets of victims were couples who had been killed at or around lovers' lane areas, and the two locations were only about a thirty-minute drive apart. On January 8, 2024, the police announced that DNA evidence revealed the identity of Knobling and Edwards' killer as Alan Wilmer Sr., a local fisherman. Via DNA evidence, Wilmer was also linked to the otherwise unrelated 1989 murder of Teresa Lynn Howell.\nBrian Pettinger\nBrian Craig Pettinger (25), a heavy equipment operator employed as maintenance man for a local apartment complex, was last seen at a Hampton ballroom dance studio on December 4, 1987, at 11:30&nbsp;p.m. Pettinger was training to become a ballroom dance instructor. Two days after reporting him missing, Pettinger's wife discovered his vehicle in the parking lot of the Newmarket North Mall.\nTwo months later, on February 3, 1988, fishermen found Pettinger's body floating in a marshy area of the James River in Suffolk, near the mouth of Chuckatuck Creek. His wrists and ankles were tied, and a rope was around his neck. The lead investigator in the case believed that Pettinger had likely been hog-tied. The autopsy showed that Pettinger had blunt force trauma to the back of the head. He was found to have been thrown alive into the river, and drowned, unable to swim. The murder remains unsolved.\nPettinger worked as a security guard and loss prevention officer for the same security services company as Edwards' mother at the time of her murder. Suspect Wayne Elliot Mack, a fellow dance instructor, later acknowledged having left the studio with Pettinger; Mack died by suicide a few months later.\nLaurie Ann Powell\nLaurie Ann Powell Compton (age 18), a graduate of Gloucester High School in Gloucester County, Virginia, disappeared on March 8, 1988, after an argument with her boyfriend, Chris Cutler (1967–2016). According to Cutler, Powell exited his vehicle during the dispute and was last seen by him at approximately 11:30 p.m. walking along Route 614 toward Route 17 in the White Marsh area of Gloucester County.  Cutler was originally considered a suspect in Powell’s death.\nOn April 2, 1988, Powell's body was recovered from the James River near Ragged Island. She was found nude and had sustained multiple stab wounds to her back. Powell had previously worked as a receptionist at the same security company that employed Brian Pettinger and Robin Edwards's mother.\nIn November 2025, the Virginia State Police publicly confirmed that Alan Wilmer was responsible for Powell’s murder.\nCassandra Hailey and Keith Call\nOn April 10, 1988, Christopher Newport College students Cassandra Lee Hailey (18) and Richard Keith Call (20) were reported missing. Call, who was on a two-week break from his regular girlfriend, asked out Hailey, a business classmate, to see a movie on Saturday night and then go to a party. Call's brother purchased beer for him. Call picked up Hailey at her family's residence in Grafton for their first date. The couple traveled in Call's red 1982 Toyota Celica. The pair attended a college party in the University Square area, where they were seen socializing separately. They were last seen leaving the party sometime between 11:30 p.m. and 2:25&nbsp;a.m.\nCall's unoccupied vehicle was found at the York River Overlook in Yorktown on the day of their disappearance. The keys were on the driver's seat, and a watch and eyeglasses were left on the dashboard. Nearly all of the clothing Call was wearing, including his underwear, was also found in the back of the car, as were some of Hailey's clothes along with several empty beer cans. Police later confirmed that it was the same clothing the couple had worn the night they disappeared. Hailey's purse and Call's wallet, however, were missing. Police dogs tracked the two students’ scent, along the Parkway past the site of the Dowski-Thomas vehicle recovery, to the Indian Field Creek shoreline where the dogs tried to enter the water. The Mouth of Indian Field Creek has sandy beaches and is a popular swimming hole during the summer months. Park authorities initially suggested the couple had gone swimming and drowned, a claim that was met with some skepticism given the 40 degree water temperature in early April and the steep 20-foot embankment, but the river and surrounding area was thoroughly searched. To this day their bodies have never been found.\nIn the days after the Call-Hailey disappearance, the FBI became aware of a fisherman driving a blue 1966 Dodge Fargo pickup who had approached at least one other couple on the Colonial Parkway around the same time. The suspect, identified decades later as Wilmer, was placed under surveillance, and police observed him cleaning and spraypainting his pickup. The FBI executed a search warrant of Wilmer's home, finding handcuffs and a gun. An FBI polygraph examiner cleared Wilmer, who was subsequently freed. In May 1988, the FBI offered a $10,000 reward. By June, the moniker \"Colonial Parkway Murders\" was being applied to the killings.\nTeresa Howell\nOn July 1, 1989, Teresa Lynn Howell (29) was seen leaving popular Hampton nightspot the Zodiac Club at around 2:30 a.m. Seven hours later, her body was found by a construction worker in a nearby wooded area. Howell had been sexually assaulted and strangled. The murder was not connected to the Colonial Parkway killings until 2022, when DNA from the case was matched to DNA from the Knobling-Edwards slaying. The DNA was later identified as belonging to Wilmer.\nAnnamaria Phelps and Daniel Lauer\nOn September 5, 1989, Annamaria Phelps (18) and her boyfriend's brother, Daniel Lauer (21), vanished en route to Virginia Beach. Lauer's car, a gold 1972 Chevrolet Nova, was later found abandoned at the Interstate 64 rest stop in New Kent County. It is unclear whether Phelps and Lauer were killed at the rest stop or elsewhere. Both the driver and passenger side doors were unlocked, and the keys still in the ignition. Police found dirt and grass stains on the vehicle's underside, suggesting the car had recently been driven through the woods. Phelps' purse was found inside the car, so again robbery was ruled out as a motive.\nOn October 19, the skeletonized bodies of Phelps and Lauer were found in a wooded area by hunters along Interstate 64 between Williamsburg and Richmond. They were covered in an electric blanket from Lauer's car and were badly decomposed. This made it impossible to determine either the cause of death or whether there had been a sexual assault. The hunters discovered the bodies on a logging road about a quarter-of-a-mile from Courthouse Road, a location about a mile from the rest stop where Lauer's car was found.\nIn 2010, a note was discovered in a box recovered years earlier from Phelps' apartment. The note, which was undated and purportedly written by Phelps, indicated that she was to meet someone in a blue van at a rest stop. The note named an individual and provided a phone number.\nPossible additional victims\nMike Margaret and Donna Hall\nOn August 21, 1984, the bodies of Michael Sturgis “Mike” Margaret (21) and Donna Lynn Hall (18) were found in a wooded area approximately 300 yards southwest of the Kings Crossing Apartment Complex in Henrico. Margaret and Hall had been dating for four years and were engaged to be married. On August 17, the couple had told their respective families they planned to go on a camping trip together. This was the last time they were seen alive.\nThree days later, a retired dentist walking his dog discovered Margaret's Jeep backed into a depression off the trail with the passenger door open, keys in the ignition and ashtray open. One red bandana was hanging from the rear-view mirror, and another loosely tied around the clutch. The canvas top of the jeep had been rolled up and pinned back even though it had rained over the weekend. Inside the back end there were two suitcases and a paper bag filled with clothes. A trail of blood led to the bodies of Hall and Margaret underneath a checkered red and blue blanket about twenty feet away.\nBoth victims had been stabbed and their throats slit. The state coroner stated they died at 2:00&nbsp;a.m. on August 18, only hours after they were last seen. Both had the sedative Demerol in their systems. Hall's body was found without shoes, no defensive wounds and clutching pine needles leading investigators to believe that she and Margaret were actually killed where their bodies were found. Margaret also had defensive wounds and a comparatively lower dosage of Demerol in his system. Some detectives believe that Hall and Margaret were the first victims of the Colonial Parkway Killer due to similarities in modus operandi.\nMary Harding\nIn 2024, after Wilmer was officially identified as a suspect, it was revealed that his older brother William Keith Wilmer, known as Keith, had been a suspect in the 1985 murder of Mary Keyser Harding (24) whose body was found floating in the Rappahannock River. Keith's wife, Brenda Pittman Wilmer, worked at the same bank as Harding. Keith had been banned from the Bank of Lancaster and its parking lot for sexually harassing customers and employees, including Mary. Wilmer's house and boat were searched by law enforcement at the time but no evidence tying him to the crime was found. Wilmer also took a polygraph but the results were inconclusive. Another Lancaster County waterman, Emerson Stevens, was ultimately convicted and sent to prison for killing Mary Harding. Stevens was found to have been wrongfully convicted and has since been exonerated of the crime and released from prison after serving 32 years. He received a full pardon from Governor of Virginia, Ralph Northam, in 2021.  Keith Wilmer died on April 30, 2025 at age 73.\nShenandoah National Park killings\nThe bodies of Julianne Marie Williams (24) and Laura \"Lollie\" Salisbury Winans (26) were found by Park Rangers at the Shenandoah National Park on June 1, 1996, after Lollie's golden retriever Taj was located wandering near the Whiteoak Canyon Trail. The two young women were in a relationship, and on May 19 went on a camping trip in the park. Julianne and Laura were last seen alive on May 24 in the park. On May 31, their families reported them missing. Their bodies were found at a remote campsite in the park about a quarter-mile from Skyline Drive off the Appalachian Trail. Laura was found inside the tent. Julianne was found in her sleeping bag about forty feet away, down an embankment. Their hands were bound, their mouths were gagged, and their throats were slit. Both were partially undressed, but neither was sexually assaulted.\nThe FBI investigated whether Julianne and Laura's murders were related to the 1986 murders of Thomas and Dowski. In that case, the victims were similarly bound and stabbed. They had also not been sexually molested. Both double murders occurred on National Park property, which were connected by Interstate 64. Detective Steve Spingola who was asked to investigate the Colonial Parkway murders as a private investigator believed that the murders of Cathy and Rebecca were not related to the other Colonial Parkway murders at all and were, instead, connected to Williams and Winans’s murders.\nIn 2001, the Department of Justice indicted Darrell David Rice for the murders, but charges were dropped after DNA found at the scene matched neither Rice nor  the victims. In 2024, fifteen days after his exoneration, Rice was killed in a car accident. In June 2024, the FBI announced new DNA evidence linking the killing to serial rapist Walter “Leo” Jackson, with a 2.6 trillion to one match between DNA from Jackson and DNA found at the scene of the crime. Jackson died in 2018 while incarcerated for other crimes.\nTheories\nLaw enforcement\nAt the first crime scene, Thomas's wallet had been removed from her purse, as if she was preparing to show her identificiation. Just days after the first murder,  the FBI privately suggested to family that the perpetrator might be a member of law enforcement or other authority figure.\nFisherman\nIn the first murders, of Dowski and Thomas, a piece of nautical line had been found in Thomas's hair. The killer attempted to use diesel fuel to set fire to the victims' vehicle, suggesting the perpetrators purchased fuel at a gas station for use in a boat rather than purchasing it directly from a marina – a practice common to local fishermen. The sharpness of the knife, which nearly decapitated Thomas, also suggested a fisherman. Knobling and Edwards were found on the banks of the James River. In the Hailey-Call case, police dogs traced a scent from the car to the nearby edge of the York river, suggesting the involvement of a boat.\nVehicle staging\nCathy Thomas's vehicle was found with the driver's seat adjusted for someone taller than her, suggesting the killer may had driven it before it was pushed off the embankment. A search of the area failed to find any pools of blood;  the murders had happened elsewhere, potentially somewhere not even on the Parkway.\nDavid Knobling's truck was found with doors open, keys in the ignition, and the radio playing. Knobling, an automotive enthusiast, never left his truck unlocked. Knobling consistently parked by backing in, yet the truck was found parked by driving forward. Knobling had wired his car's radio directly to the battery so that the ignition did not need to be set to Accessories, as it was when the truck was discovered. This suggested someone other than Knobling had been the last to operate the vehicle.\nWhen Keith Call's vehicle was found on the Parkway, families quickly disputed that the victims would have intentionally parked there. Both families reported their loved ones had a fear of the dark, isolated Parkway at nighttime. Call's keys were in the ignition and his gold wristwatch was left in the seat, something family insisted he would never do. Daniel Lauer's vehicle was found near a westbound interstate rest area, but Lauer and Phelps were known to be traveling eastward to Virginia Beach. A feathered roach clip, which Lauer kept attached to the rear-view mirror, had been transferred to the driver's side mirror.\nMultiple offenders working together\nLarry McCann, head of the Virginia State Police's Behavioral Science Unit, argued that two individuals were working together in the murders. He felt the level of control demonstrated over victims suggested two perpetrators. Irvin Wells, of the FBI, also suspected a pair of offenders.\nLiberty Security Services\nOn April 19, 1988, press reported that local private detective Ronald Little, then under arrest on immigration charges, alleged he was a suspect in the Parkway Murders.  Robin Edwards's mother Bonnie had been employed by the company, while Brian Pettinger had worked as a security guard and loss prevention officer for the firm. Laurie Ann Powell Compton, who had gone missing on March 8, 1988, was also an employee of the company. The FBI denied that Little was a suspect in the murders. Little was deported back to his native New Zealand in 1989 and has since died.\nSuspect identified\nAlan Wade Wilmer, nickname \"Pokey\", worked as a fisherman on his own boat, the Denni Wade, primarily harvesting clams and oysters. He later started a tree-cutting company. He was an avid hunter, a member of a local hunting club, and won archery competitions. He was married on February 22, 1975; he later divorced. Wilmer had two children, both adults at the time of his death.\nWilmer was known to confront couples on the Colonial Parkway. In one instance, Wilmer had confronted a girl and a long-haired boyfriend, mistaking the pair for a same-sex couple.  Upon seeing the couple was heterosexual, he laughed. Wilmer placed himself near the site of the Keith Call-Cassandra Hailey recovered vehicle. Despite public protest, Wilmer's DNA was not entered into the CODIS, the US's national DNA database.\nMedia coverage\nIn 2007, the case of Hailey and Call was featured in the Investigation Discovery program Sensing Murder. In 2008, E! Entertainment Television presented a full-length documentary, THS Investigates Serial Killers on the Loose, which features a segment on the Colonial Parkway murders.\nIn September 2009, it was discovered by CBS News affiliate WTKR that nearly 80 highly graphic crime scene photographs of Colonial Parkway murders victims were used to instruct a class by a retired and now deceased former FBI photographer.\nIn 2011, author Michelle McNamara published a two-part exploration of the Colonial Parkway murders in her True Crime Diary.\nIn October 2016, there was extensive coverage of the 30th anniversary of the Colonial Parkway murders, including an eight-part multimedia presentation by the Daily Press newspaper.\nOn October 8, 2016, the Richmond Times Dispatch ran an in-depth article on the 30th anniversary of the Colonial Parkway murders case: After 30 Years, Relatives in Parkway Murders Hope for a Break in Cases\nOn May 4, 2018, the Colonial Parkway murders were covered in featured panel discussion at the annual \"CrimeCon\" true crime convention in Nashville. Moderated by former FBI Special Agent Maureen O'Connell, the panel featured family members and advocates Joyce Call and Bill Thomas along with Blaine Pardoe, coauthor of a book on the case, A Special Kind of Evil: The Colonial Parkway Serial Killings.\nOn July 23, 2018. WTVR News 6 in Richmond reported that there was additional DNA evidence available for testing in the Colonial Parkway murders.\nInvestigation Discovery, Virginian Pilot, Access Hollywood, The Daily Beast, Listverse, Daily Press, Dateline NBC and others have published later summaries of the case.\nOn April 25, 2019, The New York Times published a story on the use of DNA in the Golden State Killer case, the Colonial Parkway murders, and other unsolved homicides titled ''Sooner or Later, Your Cousin's DNA is Going to Solve a Murder.\nOn July 30, 2019, The Washington Post ran a story on the search for answers in the Colonial Parkway murders and other cases titled Victims, Families and America's Thirst for True-Crime Stories\nOn September 17, 2020, the publication Forensic Genomics published an article by family member Bill Thomas covering the Colonial Parkway murders entitled \"The Family Perspective.\"\nOn January 15, 2021, the Oxygen Network announced that a four-part true crime series, Lovers Lane Murders'' would cover the Colonial Parkway murders. The four episodes were to feature former FBI profiler Jim Clemente, as well as investigators including former FBI Agent Maureen O'Connell and former prosecutor Loni Coombs, together with crime scene reconstruction expert Dr. Laura Pettler. The series made its debut on February 11–12, 2021.\nOn February 4, 2021, in advance of their ''Lover's Lane Murders'' television series, the Oxygen Network released a series of videos including \"Why Would Law Enforcement Not Release All Records On a Case Like the Colonial Parkway Murders? and \"Was the Colonial Parkway Killer Pretending to be Law Enforcement?\"\nOn April 2, 2025, Episode 1, Season 5 of Homicide Hunter: American Detective, hosted by Joe Kenda, covered the murders.\nTimeline\n* Oct. 9, 1986 – Rebecca Dowski and Cathy Thomas last seen leaving University computer lab together\n* Oct. 12, 1986 – Rebecca Dowski and Cathy Thomas found murdered on Colonial Parkway\n* Sept. 19, 1987 – David Knobling and Robin Edwards last seen at respective family homes\n* Sept. 23, 1987 – David Knobling and Robin Edwards found murdered on Ragged Island\n* Dec. 4, 1987 – Brian Craig Pettinger goes missing after training at Ballroom Dance Club, a studio on Mercury Blvd;  Vehicle found in nearby mall parking lot\n* March 8, 1988 - Powell last seen at approximately 11:30 p.m. walking along Route 614 toward Route 17 in the White Marsh area of Gloucester County.
