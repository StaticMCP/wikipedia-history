The Support Group as part of 8th Armoured Division was sent to North Africa but never saw active service as a complete formation. As the division could not be provided with a lorried infantry brigade, it was broken up and  was finally disbanded in Egypt on 1 January 1943.\nFollowing the Second Battle of El Alamein a plan was put forth to use the remains of the division as a self-contained pursuit force to dart forward into the German–Italian rear as far as possibly Tobruk; however the plan to use the division was shelved and units in the forward area were used instead.\nOrder of battle\nThe 8th Support Group was constituted as follows during the war:\n* 73rd Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery (from 8 November 1940, left 12 July 1942)\n* 14th Battalion, Sherwood Foresters (from 30 November 1940)\n* 5th Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery (from 18 December 1940, left 17 July 1942)\n* 56th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery (from 21 January 1941, left 22 July 1942)\nCommanders\n* Brigadier H.M. Stanford (from 11 November 1940)\nReferences\n*\nFootnotes\nSee also\n* List of British brigades of the Second World War"
