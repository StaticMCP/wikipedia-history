      "text": "# Treaty of Vienna (1719)\n\nThe Treaty of Vienna was signed on 5 January 1719 during the Great Northern War and War of Quadruple Alliance, between the Holy Roman Empire, the Kingdom of Great Britain, and the Electorate of Saxony. Its aim was 'to secure the peace and tranquility of the Empire' and act as a defensive alliance. The treaty was intended to check the Tsardom of Russia, prevent it from making a separate peace with Swedish Empire, and compel the evacuation of Russian troops stationed in Poland-Lithuania. The treaty successfully created distrust between Peter I of Russia and Frederick William I of Prussia, leading to the Russians evacuating Poland-Lithuania in July 1719.\nSources\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*"
