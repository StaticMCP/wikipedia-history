The death of the Swedish monarch heralded the impending conclusion of the Great Northern War.\nTreaty with Hanover\nIn the treaty with Hanover on 9 November 1719, Sweden ceded the dominion of Bremen-Verden.\nTreaty with Prussia\nOn 21 January 1720, Sweden ceded Swedish Pomerania south of the river Peene and east of the river Peenestrom to Prussia, including the islands of Usedom and Wollin, and the towns of Stettin, Damm and Gollnow. The treaty was formalized in 1720, and became effective when Frederick William I of Prussia issued a patent declaring the ceded area to be part of Prussia on 29 May 1720. The parts of Swedish Pomerania that were to remain with Sweden were then under Danish occupation, and were restored to Sweden in the Treaty of Frederiksborg on 3 July 1720.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Jackson, Jonathan F. \"A Clash of Visionaries.
