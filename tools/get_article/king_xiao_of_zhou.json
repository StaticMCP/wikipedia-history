Estimated dates of his reign are 891–886 BC or 872–866 BC.\nHe was a son of King Mu and brother of King Gong.\nHis reign is poorly documented. He was preceded on the throne by his nephew King Yì of Zhou and followed by his nephew's son, King Yí of Zhou. Sima Qian wrote that the King Yí was \"restored by the many lords\". This hints at a usurpation, but the matter is not clear.\nFeizi was granted a small fief at Qin by King Xiao. King Xiao learned of his reputation and put him in charge of breeding and training horses for the Zhou army. To reward his contributions, King Xiao wanted to make Feizi his father's legal heir instead of his half-brother Cheng.\nFamily\nQueens:\n* Wang Jing ()\nSee also\n* Family tree of Chinese monarchs (ancient)\nSources"
