The album was released through Trustkill Records on July 21, 2009. This album is the first album to feature lead vocalist Matty Mullins after former lead vocalist Chase Ryan left the band in 2008. Scheduled to be released summer 2008, the release got delayed because of the line-up change. Mullins has described the album as \"a new breed of rock 'n' roll\" and musically it has \"more aggressive guitar-work and noticeably more melodic, but still retains that Southern swagger\".\nThe song \"Ghost in the Mirror\" was featured on the Saw VI soundtrack with an accompanying music-video for the DVD-release of the movie.\nTrack listing\nAll lyrics written by Matty Mullins, all music composed by Kellen McGregor and Memphis May Fire.\nPersonnel\n;Memphis May Fire\n* Matty Mullins - lead vocals\n* Kellen McGregor - lead guitar, backing vocals\n* Ryan Bentley - rhythm guitar\n* Cory Elder - bass\n* Jeremy Grisham - drums\n;Production\n* Produced, mastered, and mixed by Casey Bates\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://myspace.com/memphismayfire Memphis May Fire] on Myspace\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090611045930/http://www.trustkill.com/webstore/music.php?id=926 Sleepwalking on Trustkill]"
