It is a suburb of Louisville.\nHistory\nMany years ago the community was part of Farmington, the once sprawling farm of the Speed family. On March 1, 1924, developer C.C.

On December 21, 1939, Kingsley was incorporated as a 6th-class city.\nGeography\nKingsley is located  southeast of downtown Louisville on roughly a triangle of land between Taylorsville Road, Tyler Lane, and Byron Avenue.
