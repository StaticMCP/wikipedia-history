It is now in the collection of the Russian Museum in Saint Petersburg.\nThe canvas depicts a solemn procession of nuns accompanying a novice to the taking of the veil in the Volga countryside, after which she would renounce her worldly life for a life of religious devotion in a nunnery.\nIn the artist's words: \"The theme is sad, but the reviving nature, the Russian north, quiet and delicate ... makes the picture touching, at least for those who have a tender feeling\". It ensured Nesterov's election in 1898 to the Russian Imperial Academy of Arts.\nSee also\n* 100 Great Paintings, 1980 BBC series\n* List of paintings by Mikhail Nesterov\nReferences"
