The Czech participating broadcaster,  (ČT), organised the national final Eurosong 2008 in order to select its entry for the contest. Ten entries competed in the national final which took place on 26 January 2008 and \"Have Some Fun\" performed by Tereza Kerndlová was selected as the winner entirely by a public vote.\nThe Czech Republic was drawn to compete in the second semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest which took place on 22 May 2008. Performing during the show in position 8, \"Have Some Fun\" was not announced among the 10 qualifying entries of the second semi-final and therefore did not qualify to compete in the final. It was later revealed that Czech Republic placed eighteenth out of the 19 participating countries in the semi-final with 9 points.\nBackground\nPrior to the 2008 contest,  (ČT) had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest representing the Czech Republic only once, , when it failed to qualify to the final with \"\" performed by Kabát and placing 28th (last) in the semi-final achieving only one point.\nAs part of its duties as participating broadcaster, ČT organises the selection of its entry in the Eurovision Song Contest and broadcasts the event in the country.

Among the competing artists were Gipsy.cz, L.B.P. and Sámer Issa which competed in the previous edition of Eurosong, while artists that were approached by ČT but declined to participate included singers Lucie Bílá and Jirí Korn as well as the group 4TET.\nFinal\nThe final took place on 26 January 2008.

According to the rules, all nations with the exceptions of the host country and the \"Big Four\" (France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom) are required to qualify from one of two semi-finals in order to compete for the final; the top nine songs from each semi-final as determined by televoting progress to the final, and a tenth was determined by back-up juries. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) split up the competing countries into six different pots based on voting patterns from previous contests, with countries with favourable voting histories put into the same pot. On 28 January 2008, a special allocation draw was held which placed each country into one of the two semi-finals. Czech Republic was placed into the second semi-final, to be held on 22 May 2008. The running order for the semi-finals was decided through another draw on 17 March 2008 and Czech Republic was set to perform in position 8, following the entry from  and before the entry from .\nIn the Czech Republic, the semi-finals and the final were broadcast on ČT1 and featured commentary by Kateřina Kristelová.\nSemi-final\nTereza Kerndlová took part in technical rehearsals on 13 and 17 May, followed by dress rehearsals on 21 and 22 May.

The dancers and DJ performing with Kerndlová were: Adéla Blažková, Alena Langerová, Daniela Jančichová-Nízlová, Veronika Nízlová, and Jan Gajdoš.\nAt the end of the show, Czech Republic was not announced among the top 10 entries in the second semi-final and therefore failed to qualify to compete in the final.
