At the Philippine Popular Music Festival songwriting competition, the duo debuted the single \"Tinatangi\", which won third place.

The following year, they expanded into a nine-member ensemble, adding Poch Barretto (electric guitar), Jam Villanueva (drums), Agnes Reoma (bass guitar), Patricia Lasaten (keyboards), Toni Muñoz (percussion), Andrew de Pano (percussion), and Keifer Cabugao (violins).
