Many of these buildings were constructed during the British Raj and have significant architectural and historical value.\nMumbai General Post Office\nThe Mumbai General Post Office (GPO) was designed by British architect John Begg. It was completed in 1913 and stands as a notable example of Indo-Saracenic architecture. The dome of this building, inspired by the Gol Gumbaz of Bijapur, is the second-largest dome in India. Extensive restoration work has been underway since 2021, with plans to preserve its heritage while making the building more sustainable.\nKolkata General Post Office\nAnother significant heritage building is the Kolkata General Post Office.
