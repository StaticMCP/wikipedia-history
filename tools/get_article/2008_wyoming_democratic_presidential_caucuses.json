The party was allocated seven pledged delegates to presidential candidates on March 8 during the Wyoming Democratic County Caucuses. The remaining five pledged delegates were allocated on May 24 during the Wyoming Democratic State Convention. There were six Wyoming superdelegates, so the whole delegation was composed of 18 delegates.\nProcess\nThe Wyoming caucus were open to all eligible voters who were registered as Democrats by February 22, 2008. A 15 percent threshold was required in order to receive delegates at any caucus site. Rather than the traditional caucus format, most sites used secret ballots which were then counted and delegates apportioned, without re-caucusing of nonviable groups.\nResults\nCounty caucuses\nCaucus date: March 8, 2008\nNational pledged delegates determined: 12\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align:right;\"\n!   colspan=\"5\" | 2008 Wyoming Democratic presidential county caucuses\n|-\n! style=\"width: 17em\"|Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\"|Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\"|Percentage\n! style=\"width: 6em\"|District Delegates\n! style=\"width: 6em\"|Estimated national delegates\n|-\n| align=\"left\"| Barack Obama\n| 5,378\n| 61.44%\n| 4\n| 7\n|-\n| align=\"left\"| Hillary Clinton\n| 3,311\n| 37.83%\n| 3\n| 5\n|-\n| align=\"left\"| Other\n| 64\n| 0.73%\n| 0\n| 0\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" style=\"margin-right:0.5em\"\n| Totals\n| 8,753\n| 100.00%\n| 7\n| 12\n|}\nState Convention\nConvention date: May 24, 2008\nNational pledged delegates determined: 5\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align:right;\"\n!   colspan=\"5\" | Wyoming Democratic presidential state convention, 2008\n|-\n! style=\"width: 17em\"|Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\"|At-Large and PLEO delegates\n! style=\"width: 7em\"|Percentage\n! style=\"width: 6em\"|National delegates\n|-\n| align=\"left\"| Barack Obama\n| -\n| 0.00%\n| 7\n|-\n| align=\"left\"| Hillary Clinton\n| -\n| 0.00%\n| 5\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" style=\"margin-right:0.5em\"\n| Totals\n|5\n|0.00%\n|12\n|}\nSee also\n* 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries\n* 2008 Wyoming Republican presidential caucuses\nReferences"
