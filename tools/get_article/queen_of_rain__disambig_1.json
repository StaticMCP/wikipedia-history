It was released on 26 October 1992 by EMI Records as the second single from their fourth studio album, Tourism (1992). The ballad is written by Per Gessle and Mats Persson, and produced by Clarence Öfwerman. It became a top-20 hit in Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden, and spent over three months on the German Singles Chart, where it peaked at number 19.\nBackground and recording\nThe song was recorded in June 1990 at EMI Studios in Stockholm during sessions for their 1991 album Joyride. It was originally set to appear as that album's final track, but was excluded in favour of \"Perfect Day\". However, the closing notes and sound effects contained on the outro of the album version of \"Things Will Never Be the Same\" – the track which precedes \"Perfect Day\" on Joyride – can still be heard over the crowd noise contained on the intro of \"Queen of Rain\". Roxette later recorded a Spanish version of the track, titled \"Una reina va detrás de un rey\" (\"A Queen Goes After a King\"), for their 1996 compilation album Baladas en Español.\nPrior to the release of \"Queen of Rain\", one of the single's b-side, \"Pearls of Passion\", had remained unreleased outside of Sweden. The song would later be included as a bonus track on the 1997 reissue of their debut album, Pearls of Passion (1986).\nCritical reception\nAllMusic editor Bryan Buss described the song as \"haunting\" and \"hopeful\" in his review of Tourism.\nFormats and track listings\n* Cassette and 7-inch single (Europe 8650124 · UK EM253)\n# \"Queen of Rain\" – 4:49\n# \"It Must Have Been Love\" (Live from the Sydney Entertainment Centre on 13 December 1991) – 5:29\n* CD single (Europe · Australia 8650132)\n# \"Queen of Rain\" – 4:49\n# \"It Must Have Been Love\" (Live from Sydney) – 5:29\n# \"Paint\" (Live from Sydney) – 3:20\n# \"Pearls of Passion\" – 3:33\n* UK CD1 single (UK CDEMS253)\n# \"Queen of Rain\" (Radio Edit) – 4:28\n# \"Pearls of Passion\" – 3:33\n# \"Interview with Roxette\" – 14:30\n* UK CD2 single (UK CDEM253)\n# \"Queen of Rain\" – 4:49\n# \"It Must Have Been Love\" (Live from Sydney) – 5:29\n# \"Paint\" (Live from Sydney) – 3:20\n# \"Dangerous\" – 3:46\nCredits and personnel\nCredits are adapted from the liner notes of The Ballad Hits.\nStudios\n* Recorded at EMI Studios (Stockholm, Sweden) in June 1990\n* Mixed at EMI Studios (Stockholm, Sweden)\nMusicians\n* Marie Fredriksson – lead and background vocals\n* Per Gessle – background vocals, mixing\n* Bo Eriksson – oboe\n* Anders Herrlin  bass guitar, programming, engineering\n* Jonas Isaacson – guitars\n* Clarence Öfwerman – keyboards, programming, production, mixing\n* Alar Suurna – engineering, mixing\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Chart (1992)\n!scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA)\n| 66\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Spain (AFYVE)\n| 7\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| UK Airplay (Music Week)\n| 36\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Chart (1992)\n!scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Sweden (Topplistan)\n| 74\n|}\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Region\n! scope=\"col\"| Date\n! scope=\"col\"| Format(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Label(s)\n! scope=\"col\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Europe\n| 26 October 1992\n|\n| rowspan=\"5\"| EMI\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| Australia\n| 16 November 1992\n| CD\n|\n|-\n| 30 November 1992\n| Cassette\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Japan\n| 8 January 1993\n| Mini-CD\n|\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
