Black Warrior was the second brewery to open in Tuscaloosa after Tuscaloosa's city council voted to change the city's zoning ordinances in 2012 to allow breweries and brewpubs.\nThe previous tenant of the brewery's two-story commercial storefront in the Downtown Tuscaloosa Historic District was the Oak City Barber & Beauty Shop, historically Black-owned business.\nBeers\n* Apricot Wheat (4.6% ABV)\n* Blonde Ale (5.1% ABV)\n* Broad Street Brown Ale (5.4% ABV)\n* Lock 17 IPA (6.2% ABV)\n* Crimson Ale (5.2% ABV)\n* Belgian Red Rye (6.8% ABV)*\n* Additional Weekly New Small-Batch Brews\nCommunity\nOnce a month, Black Warrior Brewing hosts a charity night titled \"Pints with a Purpose\", which donates a percentage of sales back to a different local charity every month.  In March 2014, the brewery hosted Ales to Fight Hunger, a fundraiser for a charity that provides weekend food to hungry schoolchildren in Alabama. The company also sponsors Tuscaloosa GoKickBall.\nNotes\nExternal links\n* [http://www.blackwarriorbrewingcompany.com/ Black Warrior Brewing Company website]\n* [http://albeer.org/members Alabama Brewers Guild | Members]"
