Voters chose 13 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.\nDespite being Polk's home state and the state he once served as the governor of, Tennessee voted for the Whig candidate, Henry Clay, over Democratic candidate James K. Polk. Clay won Tennessee by a very narrow margin of 123 votes (0.10%). James K. Polk is one of 4 presidents to lose his state of residence in a successful presidential bid. The others are Woodrow Wilson in 1916, Richard Nixon in 1968, and Donald Trump in 2016, and Polk is the only one of the four to do so without ever winning either their state of birth or residence in any presidential election.\nThis election marked the third time consecutively that Polk had lost a statewide election in Tennessee. The previous two were in the 1841 and 1843 gubernatorial elections.\nConventions\nBoth James K. Polk and Henry Clay won their respective party conventions.\nResults\n}}\nSee also\n* 1844 United States elections\n* United States presidential elections in Tennessee\nReferences"
