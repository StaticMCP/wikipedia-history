The NAADM program was authorized by the Canada-United States Memorandum of Understanding signed by Prime Minister Mulroney and Ronald Reagan at the summit.  The purpose of the upgraded facilities at Yellowknife Airport was to accommodate up to six fighters in hangars when needed, 200 support personnel, and storage facilities.   The facility was built and accepted by DND in 1994, without munitions storage facilities.\nFOL Yellowknife is located immediately southwest of the Yellowknife Airport (YZF), and uses its runways when required.\nReferences"
