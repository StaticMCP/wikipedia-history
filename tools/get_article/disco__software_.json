Disco also features an interactive \"3D smoke\" animation which is visible when burning. This smoke responds to microphone input, as well as mouse input, causing perturbations in the smoke effect.\nDisco was designed as a low-cost alternative to the popular Mac OS X optical disc authoring application, Roxio Toast.\nSince its launch in 2007, Disco was available as shareware, requiring users to purchase a license after burning seven discs with it on a single computer. In July 2011 development was discontinued and a free license code to activate the application was published on its official website, effectively making the application available as freeware.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.macworld.com/news/2007/02/12/disco/index.php \"Disco disc burning app hits 1.0\"], Macworld, February 12, 2007\n*[http://www.thinkmac.co.uk/blog/2006/11/on-the-death-of-the-hig-and-the-triumph-of-eye-candy-over-usability/ \"On the death of the HIG and the triumph of eye candy over usability\"], ThinkMac Software, November 3, 2006"
