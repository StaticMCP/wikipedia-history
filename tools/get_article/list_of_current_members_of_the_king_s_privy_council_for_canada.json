Prime Ministers, Governors General and Chief Justices automatically are given the title The Right Honourable. While Governors General have the right to the title Right Honourable upon being sworn into office they are not inducted into the Privy Council until the end of their term unless they were previously members of the council by virtue of another office. Other eminent individuals such as prominent former Cabinet ministers are sometimes also given the title Right Honourable. Leaders of opposition parties and provincial premiers are not automatically inducted into the Privy Council. Opposition leaders are brought in from time to time either to commemorate a special event such as the Canadian Centennial in 1967, the patriation of the Constitution or, in order to allow them to be advised on sensitive issues of national security under the Security of Information Act. Paul Martin inaugurated a practice of inducting parliamentary secretaries into the Privy Council but this has not been continued by his successors.\nCurrent members of the King's Privy Council for Canada (year sworn in)\nRoyal consort\n*Her Majesty Queen Camilla (2025)\nFormer governors general\n*The Right Honourable Edward Schreyer (1984)\n*The Right Honourable Adrienne Clarkson (2005)\n*The Right Honourable Michaëlle Jean (2012)\n*The Right Honourable David Johnston (2018)\nCurrent and former prime ministers\n*The Right Honourable Jean Chrétien (1967)\n*The Right Honourable Joe Clark (1979)\n*The Right Honourable Kim Campbell (1989)\n*The Right Honourable Paul Martin (1993)\n*The Right Honourable Stephen Harper (2004)\n*The Right Honourable Justin Trudeau (2015)\n*The Right Honourable Mark Carney (2025)\nCurrent and former Chief Justices of Canada\n*The Right Honourable Beverley McLachlin (2000)\n*The Right Honourable Richard Wagner (2017)\nCurrent and former Cabinet ministers (by prime minister at induction)\nPierre Trudeau\n* The Honourable Otto Emil Lang (1968)\n* The Honourable André Ouellet (1972)\n* The Honourable J.
