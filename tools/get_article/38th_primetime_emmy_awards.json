The Emmy ceremony was cohosted by David Letterman and Shelley Long.  During the ceremony, Letterman saluted Grant Tinker, who had stepped down as chairman of NBC due to its parent company, RCA, having been acquired by General Electric.  The ceremony was also memorable for the presentation of the Governors' Award to Red Skelton, presented by comedy legend Lucille Ball, who in his acceptance speech said he had missed being on TV for the previous 16 years.\nThis year's ceremony saw the return of the guest acting category. The top shows of the night were The Golden Girls which won Outstanding Comedy Series and two other major awards. The Golden Girls became the first series to gain three nominations in a lead acting category, they would repeat this feat multiple times. For the second straight year Cagney & Lacey won for Outstanding Drama Series, and led all shows with four major wins. With help from the guest acting category, The Cosby Show with 13 nominations broke the record for most major nominations by a comedy series of 11 set by The Mary Tyler Moore Show in 1977. This record has since been surpassed.\nWinners and nominees\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Special winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Special winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Special winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Special winner]]\n, Outstanding Guest Performer in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Guest Performer in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program winner]]\n, Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Directing in a Variety or Music Program winner]]\n, Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series co-winner]]\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'The Golden Girls (NBC)'\n** Cheers (NBC)\n** The Cosby Show (NBC)\n** Family Ties (NBC)\n** Kate & Allie (CBS)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Cagney & Lacey (CBS)'\n** Hill Street Blues (NBC)\n** Moonlighting (ABC)\n** Murder, She Wrote (CBS)\n** St. Elsewhere (NBC)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Love Is Never Silent (NBC)'\n** Amos (CBS)\n** Death of a Salesman (CBS)\n** An Early Frost (NBC)\n** Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry (CBS)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'Peter the Great (NBC)'\n** Dress Gray (NBC)\n** The Long Hot Summer (NBC)\n** Lord Mountbatten: The Last Viceroy (PBS)\n** On Wings of Eagles (NBC)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" colspan=\"2\"|\n* 'The Kennedy Center Honors: A Celebration of the Performing Arts (CBS)'\n** The 40th Annual Tony Awards (CBS)\n** AFI Life Achievement Award: A Tribute to Billy Wilder (NBC)\n** Late Night with David Letterman (NBC)\n** The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (NBC)\n|}\nActing\nLead performances\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Michael J.
