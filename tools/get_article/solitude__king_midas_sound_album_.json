It was released on 14 February 2019 through Cosmo Rhythmatic. It received universal acclaim from critics.\nBackground\nThe album is almost entirely beatless, and the lyrics explore isolation, loneliness, regret and resentment. According to Martin and Robinson, it was recorded in a fraught period, but the lyrics are not autobiographical. The album's cover art features a photograph taken by Daisuke Yokota.\nCritical reception\n| rev1 = The Line of Best Fit\n| rev1Score = 9/10\n| rev2 = Pitchfork\n| rev2Score = 7.8/10\n| rev3 = Resident Advisor\n| rev3Score = 4.3/5\n}}\nTheo Korz for The Line of Best Fit wrote that \"Solitude is not an easy record to enjoy – even in writing this review I was reluctant to return to it\", but that the album was \"brilliant and awful\", while Louis Pattison for Pitchfork wrote that \"Solitude is the sort of record it's hard to recommend wholeheartedly\", saying it's \"too severe, too unrelenting\".}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | The Wire\n| The Wire's Top 50 Releases 2019\n|\n| }}\n|}\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from liner notes.\n* Roger Robinson – vocals\n* Kevin Richard Martin – production\n* Stefan Betke – mastering\n* Daisuke Yokota – cover photography\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
