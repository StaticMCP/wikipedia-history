Under the Shutrukids, Elam reached a height in power.\nHistory\nShutruk-Nakhkhunte was the founder of this dynasty. He took as wife a Babylonian princess, the eldest daughter of Melishihu of Babylon. Shutruk-Nakhkhunte and his three sons, Kutir-Nakhkhunte II, Shilhak-In-Shushinak, and Khutelutush-In-Shushinak were capable of frequent military campaigns into Kassite Babylonia (which was also being ravaged by the empire of Assyria during this period), and at the same time were exhibiting vigorous construction activity—building and restoring luxurious temples in Susa and across their Empire. Shutruk-Nakhkhunte raided Babylonia, carrying home to Susa trophies like the statues of Marduk and Manishtushu, the Manishtushu Obelisk, the Stele of Hammurabi and the stele of Naram-Sin. With these trophies, he attempted to give a new aura to Elam, as the conqueror of Babylonia.}}\nIn 1158 BC, after much of Babylonia had been annexed by Ashur-Dan I of Assyria and Shutruk-Nakhkhunte, the Elamites defeated permanently the Kassites, a dynasty which had ruled Mesopotamia for four centuries. They killed the Kassite king of Babylon, Zababa-shuma-iddin, and replaced him with Shutruk-Nakhkhunte's eldest son, Kutir-Nakhkhunte, who held it no more than three years before being ejected by the native Akkadian speaking Babylonians. The Elamites then briefly came into conflict with Assyria, managing to take the Assyrian city of Arrapha (modern Kirkuk) before being ultimately defeated and having a treaty forced upon them by Ashur-Dan I.\nKutir-Nakhkhunte's son Khutelutush-In-Shushinak was defeated by Nebuchadnezzar I of Babylon, who sacked Susa and returned the statue of Marduk, but who was then himself defeated by the Assyrian king Ashur-resh-ishi I. He fled to Anshan, but later returned to Susa, and his brother Shilhana-Hamru-Lagamar may have succeeded him as last king of the Shutrukid dynasty. Following Khutelutush-In-Shushinak, the power of the Elamite empire began to wane, for after the death of this ruler, Elam disappears into obscurity for more than three centuries.\nList of rulers\nThe following list should not be considered complete:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"border=\"1\"style=\"width:100%;text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=\"1%\"|#\n!width=\"16.5%\"|Depiction\n!width=\"16.5%\"|Name\n!width=\"16.5%\"|Succession\n!width=\"16.5%\"|Title\n!width=\"16.5%\"| dates\n!width=\"16.5%\"|Notes\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\"align=\"center\"style=\"background-color:palegoldenrod\"|Middle Elamite II period ()\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\"|Shutrukid dynasty ()\n|-\n|1st\n|\n|Hallutush-Inshushinak\n|Unclear succession\n|King of Anshan and Susa\n|Uncertain, }}\n|\n|-\n|2nd\n|\n|Shutruk-Nakhunte I\n|Eponymous founder of the Shutrukid dynastySon of Hallutush-InshushinakSon-in-law of Melishihu of Babylon\n|King of Anshan and SusaSovereign of the land of ElamLord of the land of Elam\n|Uncertain,\n|temp. of:\n*Meli-Shipak II\n*Marduk-apla-iddina I\n*Zababa-shuma-iddin\n|-\n|3rd\n|\n|Kutir-Nahhunte II\n|Son of Shutruk-Nahhunte I\n|King of Anshan and SusaKing of ElamKing of Babylon\n|Uncertain,\n|temp. of:\n*Enlil-nadin-ahi\n|-\n|4th\n|\n|Shilhak-Inshushinak I\n|Son of Shutruk-Nahhunte I\n|King of Anshan and SusaKing of Elam\n|Uncertain, (30 years)\n|temp. of:\n*Marduk-kabit-ahheshu\n*Itti-Marduk-balatu\n|-\n|5th\n|\n|Hutelutush-Inshushinak\n|Son of Kutir-Nahhunte II\n|King of Anshan and SusaKing of ElamKing of Elam and Susiana\n|Uncertain,\n|temp. of:\n*Nebuchadnezzar I\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\"align=\"center\"style=\"background-color:palegoldenrod\"|Neo-Elamite I period ()\n|-\n|6th\n|\n|Shilhina-Hamru-Lakamar\n|Son of Shilhak-Inshushinak I\n|King of Anshan and SusaKing of Elam\n|Uncertain, }}\n|\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\"|Elamite dynasty of Babylonia ()\n|-\n|7th\n|\n|Mar-biti-apla-usur\n|Unclear succession\n|King of BabylonSon of Elam\n|Uncertain, (6 years)\n|temp. of:\n*Ashur-resh-ishi II\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\"|Elamite Dark Ages ()\n|-\n|8th\n|\n|Akshir-Shimut\n|Unclear succession\n|King of Anshan and Susa\n|Uncertain, }}\n|\n|-\n|9th\n|\n|Akshir-Nahhunte\n|Unclear succession\n|King of Anshan and Susa\n|Uncertain, }}\n|\n|-\n|10th\n|\n|Kara-Indash\n|Unclear succession\n|King of Elam\n|Uncertain, }}\n|\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\"align=\"center\"style=\"background-color:palegoldenrod\"|Neo-Elamite II period ()\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\"|Humban-Tahrid dynasty ()\n|-\n|11th\n|\n|Unknown\n|Unclear succession\n|King of Anshan and Susa\n|Uncertain, }}\n|temp. of:\n*Shamshi-Adad V\n|-\n|12th\n|\n|Humban-Numena II\n|Unclear succession\n|King of Elam\n|Uncertain, }}\n|\n|-\n|13th\n|\n|Shutruk-Nahhunte II\n|Son of Humban-Numena II\n|King of Elam\n|Uncertain, }}\n|\n|-\n|14th\n|\n|Shutur-Nahhunte I\n|Son of Humban-Numena II\n|King of Anshan and Susa\n|Uncertain, }}\n|\n|}\nGallery\nFile:Naram-Sin stele inscription in Elamite.jpg\nFile:Babylonian stele Louvre Sb9.jpg\nFile:Bull-man protecting palmtree Louvre 14390-91.jpg\nSee also\n*Elam\n*Awan dynasty\n*Shimashki dynasty\n*Sukkalmah dynasty\n*List of rulers of Elam\n*List of Assyrian kings\n*List of Babylonian kings\n*List of monarchs of Persia\n*List of rulers of the pre-Achaemenid kingdoms of Iran\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n*Quintana Cifuentes, E., \"Historia de Elam el vecino mesopotámico\", Murcia, 1997.
