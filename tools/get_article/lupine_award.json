The prize can be given to a living illustrator or author who was born in or who resides in Maine for all or part of the year, or has created work with a characterization, plot, or setting that is focused on Maine. The prize has been awarded annually since 1993. Since 2005, separate prizes have been awarded, one to a picture book and the other to a juvenile or young adult book.\nBeginning in 1989, the Youth Services Section Interest Group of the Maine Library Association has been presenting the award. One winner and one honoree in two categories, picture book and juvenile/young adult, are given the award.\nJuvenile/Young Adult Winners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Winner\n!Honorable Mentions\n|-\n|2021\n|\n|\n|-\n|2020\n|Call Me American (Adapted for Young Adults) The Extraordinary True Story of a Young Somali Immigrant by Abdi Nor Iftin\n|Echo Mountain by Lauren Wolk\n|-\n|2019\n|Searching for Lottie by Susan Ross\n|American Trailblazers: 50 Remarkable People who Shaped U.S. History by Lisa Trusiani, illustrated by Pau Morgan, Toby Newsome, Cecilia Puglesi\n|-\n|2018\n|'The Mad Wolf's Daughter by Diane Magras\n|What the Wind Can Tell You by Sarah Marie A.
