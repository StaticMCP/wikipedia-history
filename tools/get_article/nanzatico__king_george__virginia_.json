It was built about 1770, and is a frame, two-story structure, seven-bays wide, with a hipped roof, and two interior end chimneys. The front facade features an engaged portico consisting of heroic pilasters, entablature, and bulls-eye pediment.  Also on the property are the contributing square frame smokehouse, a frame summer kitchen, and a frame schoolhouse or office. Next to Mount Vernon, Nanzatico is probably the most formal frame colonial mansion in Virginia.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969.\nReferences"
