They compete as a  National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I. They formerly competed in the Northeast conference but are now a DI independent. They play at Hammel court in the Merrimack athletic complex.\nHistory\nThe program was founded in 2023. Ray Lewis would be named as the team's first head coach. They would play their first season in 2022 as a member of the NEC.  After starting out 0-3 they would win their first ever game Vs Barton College 3-1 on January 1, 2023. They would finish their inaugural season 10-16 overall and 4-10 in conference. The following season they would go 9-16 and qualify for the NEC tournament for the first time. Where they would ultimately lose to FDU 3-1.\nIn 2024 it was announced Merrimack College would join the MAAC. This left the program in a bit of a tough spot. Because the MAAC did not sponsor men's volleyball. This would force the team to become a DI independent. In 2025 their first year as an independent they would see their first bit of success going 16-6 overall and having their first winning season.\nHead coaching records\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Coach\n!Tenure\n!Record\n!%\n|-\n|Ray Lewis\n|2023-Presnet\n|35-38\n|\n|}\nSeason by season\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Season\n|Record\n(Overall / Conference)\n|Coach\n|Postseason\n|Notes\n|-\n|2023\n|10-16/ 4-10\n|Ray Lewis\n|\n|\n|-\n|2024\n|9-16/4-8\n|Ray Lewis\n|NEC first round\n|\n|-\n|2025\n|16-6\n|Ray Lewis\n|\n|Became a DI independent\n|}\nSource\nReferences"
