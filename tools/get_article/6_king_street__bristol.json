It is thought that the original roof had gables, similar to those seen on the neighbouring 7 and 8, which were cut back to form the hips seen today. The interior retains many 18th-century features.\nIt has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building.\nAs of 2025 it is occupied by an architectural firm.\nSee also\n*Grade II* listed buildings in Bristol\nReferences"
