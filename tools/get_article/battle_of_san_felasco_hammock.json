It is not known how early people had settled in the area, but Dell's post office was established there in January 1826. Newnansville was named the seat for Alachua County in 1828. When the Second Seminole War started in 1835, settlers in outlying areas sought refuge in Newnansville. The county courthouse and the jail were fortified. By December 1835, 259 soldiers were stationed at Fort Gilliland in Newnansville.\nIn September 1836, reports reached Newnansville that up to 150 Seminoles had gathered at Colonel Francis Sanchez's plantation in San Felasco Hammock,  south of Newnansville, and were rounding up cattle and moving them south to Hogtown prairie. At the time, Fort Gilliland was the last fort in northern Florida between the St. Johns River and the Suwannee River at which troops were still stationed. On September 17, Seminoles fired on a party of five men attempting to harvest corn about  from Newnansville. The men escaped, and soldiers pursued the Seminoles to Sanchez's plantation, but returned to Newnansville after encountering a heavy rainstorm. Scouts sent out that night reported that there were 300 Seminoles at Sanchez's plantation.\nColonel John Warren led 100 (per Mahon) or 150 (per Yelton) men, equipped with a howitzer, out the next day towards the Seminoles. The Seminoles attacked the troops when they were about  from the plantation. The Seminoles probably outnumbered the troops, but the howitzer made up the difference. The Seminoles made at least two attempts to capture the howitzer, but were driven off after an hour-and-a-half. The U.S. troops suffered one dead and five wounded. Seminole casualties were unknown.\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*"
