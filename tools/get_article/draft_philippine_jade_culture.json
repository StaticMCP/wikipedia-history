From around 2000 BCE to 500 CE, the Philippines was a central hub in the extensive Maritime Jade Road, a vast sea-based trade network connecting Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Island Southeast Asia prior to the rise of the Silk Road.\nOrigins and Trade\nThe jade artifacts found in the Philippines are primarily made of nephrite, sourced not from the Philippines but from eastern Taiwan, particularly the Fengtian nephrite deposits. These materials were processed in jade workshops in the Batanes Islands and then traded throughout the region, reaching as far as Vietnam and Indonesia.\nThis ancient exchange network is recognized by scholars as the Maritime Jade Road, which predated the Silk Road by over a millennium and represents one of the longest-lasting trade systems in human history.\nArchaeological Discoveries\nSeveral significant archaeological sites in the Philippines have yielded jade artifacts:\n* Batanes Islands – Workshop areas containing unfinished tools, debris, and ornaments suggest local jade crafting.\n* Palawan – Jade ornaments discovered in burial sites like the Tabon Caves show their use in funerary contexts.\n* Batangas – Notably in Isla Verde and Calatagan, numerous jade ornaments, especially lingling-o earrings, have been uncovered.\n* Cagayan Valley – Early Austronesian sites here contain nephrite adzes and ornaments.\nLingling-o and Cultural Significance\nAmong the most iconic jade artifacts in the Philippines is the lingling-o, an omega-shaped earring commonly made of nephrite or gold. These ornaments are associated with elite status and ritual functions, and many fine examples have been found across the archipelago.\nThese items often appear in connection with the broader Sa Huỳnh-Kalanay Interaction Sphere, a prehistoric cultural exchange network linking the Philippines with southern Vietnam and Borneo.\nDecline of the Jade Road\nThe jade trade declined after 500 CE as iron metallurgy expanded and other trade networks, such as those connected to the Indian Ocean and China, became dominant. However, the jade artifacts remain as material evidence of the Philippines’ active participation in a complex and long-lasting prehistoric global trade network.\nSee Also\n* Maritime Jade Road\n* Austronesian peoples\n* Tabon Man\n* Prehistory of the Philippines\n* Sa Huỳnh culture\n* National Museum of the Philippines\nReferences"
