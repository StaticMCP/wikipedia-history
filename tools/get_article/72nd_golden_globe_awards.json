However, the ceremony's lack of energy and adherence to routine faced negative criticism.\nSean O'Neal of The A.V. Club lamented Fey and Poehler's previous announcement that this would be their final year hosting—\"Hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler reminded everyone why they will be sorely missed next year\"—which presenter Meryl Streep echoed as she introduced the \"Best Motion Picture—Drama\" category. Jethro Nededog of The Wrap was among many reviewers to praise Fey and Poehler, though he wished they had appeared more often throughout the ceremony, claiming, \"the fun was front-loaded\".\nComedian Margaret Cho appeared at several instances as a disapproving North Korean film critic, parodying North Korea's reaction and condemnation of the film The Interview two months earlier. Cho had previously played Kim Jong-Il and Kim Jong-Un on Fey's comedy series 30 Rock, the latter role garnering Cho a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series. Some reviewers enjoyed the recurring gag and Cho's skewering of Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy nominee Orange Is the New Blacks placement in the \"Comedy\" category. Others found Cho's appearances \"interminable\".\nOf note during the ceremony were overt references to oppressed populations and current political events in several victors' speeches. Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film winner Joanne Froggatt, referencing her Downton Abbey character Anna Bates's experience with sexual assault, addressed real-world survivors of sexual abuse and rape. Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy winner Jeffrey Tambor thanked the transgender community and Transparent creator Jill Soloway dedicated her award to recent trans suicide victim Leelah Alcorn. Best Original Song winner Common alluded to the Ferguson, Missouri police's shooting of Michael Brown as well as to the 2014 NYPD officer killings by armed civilians. Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy winner Gina Rodriguez mentioned her programs's relevance to Latino viewers, and Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film winner Matt Bomer expressed solidarity and remorse for the LGBT victims of the AIDS crisis.\nRatings\nThe ceremony averaged a Nielsen 12.6 rating/19 share and was watched by 19.3 million viewers. This rating was an eight percent decline from the previous ceremony's viewership of 20.9 million, the highest in a decade.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
