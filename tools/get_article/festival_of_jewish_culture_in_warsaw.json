It attempts to recreate Jewish culture from the period of interwar Poland, complete with historical buildings and atmosphere. Regular features include kosher food (along with instructions as to how to prepare it in one's own kitchen), dancing, songs, crafts, ceramics and posters. Numerous workshops, discussion groups and seminars are also held on topics related to Yiddish culture.\nThe festival is organized by the Polish-Israeli-American Shalom Foundation, which began in 1988 on the initiative of Gołda Tencer, an actress and producer of the Jewish Theatre in Warsaw. The purpose of the foundation is the popularization of Jewish culture in Poland, and the remembrance of its Jewish communities.\nThe first annual festival was held in 2004 on the 100th anniversary of the birthday of Isaac Bashevis Singer (note that Singer's actual birth date is uncertain).\nThe logo of the festival consists of a combination of a fiddler on a rooftop (to symbolize Polish Jewish culture) and that of the Warsaw Syrenka (to symbolize Warsaw). It was designed by Lech Majewski.\nThe 2009 festival was held from the 29 August until 6 September. Guests and participants included: Nigel Kennedy David Krakauer and Klezmer Madness!, the Gorale folk band Zakopower, Benzion Miller, Kroke, the author Hanna Krall, Michał Piróg, Trombenik, Janusz Tylman, Israel's ambassador to Poland Zvi Rav-Ner and many others.\nSee also\n*Baltic Days of Jewish Culture\n*Jewish Culture Festival in Kraków\nReferences"
