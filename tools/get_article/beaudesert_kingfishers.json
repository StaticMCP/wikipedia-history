The club is based at R.S. Willis Park in Beaudesert, Queensland and competes in the Gold Coast Rugby League. The club's emblem of the Kingfisher was adopted in 1973 and it currently fields teams in all junior grades, from under 8's to under 15's.\nThe Gold Coast Titans Ambassadors is Will Smith\nHistory\nThe current Beaudesert club was formed at the Grand Hotel in Beaudesert in 1962 when a meeting of interested parties was called to re-form the Beaudesert Rugby League Football Club. For much of its early history the club also ran teams in local touch football, netball and basketball competitions at the Beaudesert Showgrounds.\nIn 1970 the club purchased 2.6 hectares of land in Peterson Street, Beaudesert with the intention of building a sporting complex, with the first games at the new location played in 1972.\nBetween 1962 and 1975 the club participated a number of leagues, in particular the Brisbane Church League and the Brisbane Commercial League. In 1976 it was one of the five clubs to form the new Gold Coast District Rugby League. The Beaudesert competed in the GCRL until 1996 and from 1997 until 2001 it competed in the Ipswich Rugby League. Beaudesert rejoined the GCRL in 2002.\nR.S. Willis Park\nThe Peterson Street sporting complex was officially named the R.S. Willis Park in recognition of the long time contribution to the game of Rugby League in the Beaudesert District by Ron Willis.\nClub honours\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year !!
