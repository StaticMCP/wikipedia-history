The incumbent president Ram Nath Kovind did not run for reelection. The election had a turnout of 99.12%.\nBharatiya Janata Party candidate Droupadi Murmu won the election by a margin of 296,626 votes against Yashwant Sinha, the United Opposition candidate. Murmu became the first member of a Scheduled Tribe and second woman to become president, as well as the first president born after independence.\nElectoral system\nThe president of India is indirectly elected by an electoral college consisting of the elected members of the parliament, the elected members of the legislative assemblies of the 28 states, and the elected members of the legislative assemblies of the union territories of Delhi, Puducherry, and Jammu and Kashmir. As of 2022, the electoral college comprises 776 members of Parliament (MPs) and 4,036 members of Legislative Assembly (MLAs) not counting the 90 MLAs of the dissolved Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly.\nThe Election Commission of India assigns varying numbers of votes to electoral college members, such that the total weight of MPs and MLAs is roughly equal and that the voting power of a state or territory is proportional to its population. Overall, the members of the electoral college are eligible to cast 1,086,431 votes, yielding a threshold for a majority of 543,216 votes. through single transferable vote system.\nFor a candidate to be in the president's office, they must be subscribed by at least 50 electors as proposers and 50 electors as seconders. The election is held by means of a secret ballot under the instant-runoff voting system. The manner of election of the president is provided by Article 55 of the Constitution.\nArticle 58 of the Indian Constitution provides that the president and vice president of India must be citizens of India and at least 35 years old. Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the political parties, in which case each party devises a method (such as a primary election) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. Traditionally, the primary elections are indirect elections where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The general election in July is an indirect election, where voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the Electoral College; these electors in turn directly elect the president and vice president.\nBy convention, the secretary general of the Lok Sabha and the secretary general of the Rajya Sabha are appointed as the returning officers by rotation. For the 2017 presidential election, the secretary general of the Lok Sabha was appointed as a returning officer. Therefore, for the 2022 presidential election, the secretary general of the Rajya Sabha, Shri P.C. Mody, was appointed as the returning officer in notification by ECI on 13 June 2022.\nElection schedule\nUnder sub-section 1 of Section 4 of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections Act of 1952, the election schedule for the president of India was announced by the Election Commission of India on 9 June 2022.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!S.No.\n!Event\n!Date\n!Day\n|-\n!1.\n|Issue of election commission's notification calling the election\n|15 June 2022\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Wednesday\n|-\n!2.\n|Last date for making nominations\n|29 June 2022\n|-\n!3.\n|Date for the scrutiny of nominations\n|30 June 2022\n|Thursday\n|-\n!4.\n|Last date for the withdrawal of candidatures\n|2 July 2022\n|Saturday\n|-\n!5.\n|Date on which a poll shall, if necessary, be taken\n|18 July 2022\n|Monday\n|-\n!6.\n|Date on which counting, if required, shall be taken\n|21 July 2022\n|Thursday\n|}\nElectoral college\nElectoral college member strength\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
