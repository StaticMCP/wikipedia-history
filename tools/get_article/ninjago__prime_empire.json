The subsequent episodes were released throughout July and August 2020 until the release of the season finale titled Game Over on 30 August of the same year.\nPlot\nWhen the old, legendary video game Prime Empire resurfaces, players begin to disappear into the game, including Jay (who loves playing video games). The ninja discover that the game's creator, Milton Dyer, has also disappeared and nobody has seen him for years. With the suspicion that Dyer is a villain named Unagami, Lloyd, Cole, Kai and Nya enter the virtual world of Prime Empire to stop Dyer's avatar, while Zane and P.I.X.A.L. remain outside to find Dyer in the real world. They meet \"The League of Jay\", a group of Jay fans who lead them to a player named Scott. He explains that players only get four lives in the game and after losing their last life, they are turned into digital cubes and disappear. Inside one of the game zones, a Samurai named Okino faces a crisis of faith when he repeatedly fails to lead a series of Masters to victory, causing him to lose all hope - until some familiar ninja arrive. In order to stop Unagami, the ninja must obtain three Key-tanas, the first of which is hidden in the game zone Terra Karana - one of Prime Empire's most dangerous game environments.  While being chased by Unagami's dreaded Red Visors the ninja must climb the 'Cliffs of Hysteria', however, they make a startling discovery: Unagami is converting players into energy cubes in order to build a portal into the real world!  Once reunited with Jay, the ninja travel across three game zones to obtain three Key-Tanas, which unlock the final challenge at the Temple of Madness. On the journey, they are hunted by Unagami's digital troops, the Red Visors. In the first game zone, Terra Karana, the ninja meet a non-player character (NPC) called Okino, who helps them through many deadly challenges. In the boss battle, the ninja win the fight against the Red Dragon to obtain the purple Key-Tana. The ninja learn that the only way to acquire the 2nd Key-tana is by winning a race in Terra Technica and have to find racing cars in unexpected ways.  The yellow Key-Tana is obtained by winning the Speedway Five-Billion, a dangerous race in the second game zone, Terra Technica. Lloyd recruits Racer Seven, another NPC, but she is followed by the Red Visors. Scott sacrifices himself to help the ninja escape and is transformed into a digital cube. The ninja manage to win the Speedway Five-Billion, but Kai and Cole are both cubed during the race. Lloyd, Jay and Nya continue their journey to obtain the final Key-tana in the third game zone, Terra Domina. There Lloyd is forced to battle an avatar of Harumi. He defeats her and obtains the orange Key-Tana, but is cubed in the process.\nIn the real world, Zane discovers the location of Dyer, only to get captured by the Mechanic. When P.I.X.A.L. finds Dyer, he reveals that Scott was a test player who became trapped inside the game (which was named Unagami), when Dyer requested that Scott receive an intense gaming experience. Dyer shut the game down, but Unagami survived. Zane is forced to give the Prime Empire motherboard to the Mechanic, who uses it to create a portal from the game into the real world.\nIn Prime Empire, Jay and Nya reach a digital sushi restaurant in the Temple of Madness, but Nya is cubed after being defeated by an NPC called Sushimi. After reaching the final level, Jay confronts Unagami, who transforms himself into the Empire Dragon. Jay follows him through the portal into the real world by riding on his Cyber Dragon. Back in the real world, Jay lures Unagami to the top of Borg Tower. Dyer apologises to Unagami, who forgives him. He agrees to release all the players and NPCs who are trapped inside the game. Unagami, who is now a child, and Dyer are finally reunited.\nEpisodes\n| Viewers         = 0.28\n| ShortSummary    = The Mechanic and his henchmen infiltrate an old electronics warehouse in search of a mysterious motherboard. The ninja learn of the heist and arrive to thwart the attack. But they're completely in the dark as to what the Mechanic wants with it, so they head to the Mechanic's headquarters looking for clues. There, the ninja find the legendary, unreleased arcade game called Prime Empire. Realizing the game is missing a motherboard, Jay inserts the motherboard and the game boots up. While Jay plays the game, the other ninja make their way into the Mechanic's private office where they intercept a phone call intended for the Mechanic. It's a mysterious new villain called Unagami, for whom the Mechanic seems to be working. Meanwhile, Jay accidentally triggers an energy pulse that converts all of the arcade games in Ninjago City into Prime Empire arcade games.\n| LineColor       = 7CB9E8\n}}\n| Viewers         = 0.23\n| ShortSummary    = When the ninja discover that Jay has disappeared into the arcade game, they interrogate the Mechanic, hoping to learn who the mysterious Unagami is and how they can get Jay back. But the Mechanic refuses to speak. While they are at the police station, they learn from the Commissioner that something strange has affected all the arcade games in Ninjago City, turning them into Prime Empire ones. Fearing that whoever plays them will disappear like Jay, the ninja urge the Commissioner to pull the cabinets out of the arcade games. As the police rush to comply, the ninja head off to Dyer Island, an island outside Ninjago City, where they hope to find Milton Dyer, the creator of Prime Empire. On Dyer Island, the ninja instead meet Bob the Intern, who used to work for Dyer. Bob explains that Prime Empire was a project that was shut down by the company Dyer worked for because it was too dangerous, and that Milton Dyer vowed to get revenge on the gaming industry afterward. The ninja then conclude that Dyer must be Unagami.\n| LineColor       = 7CB9E8\n}}\n| Viewers         = 0.22\n| ShortSummary    = More and more people are disappearing in Ninjago City, while the ninja scramble to unlock the secrets of the Prime Empire arcade game.

Unagami hacks the security system and releases the prisoners, ordering them to get the Prime Empire arcade game back from the ninja. Mechanic, Ultra Violet, and Captain Soto escape, rush to Borg Tower and begin their assault, fighting their way past the building's security systems to reach the 100th floor. Borg tells the ninja that there is only one way to release the trapped players - by stopping Unagami. Cole plays the arcade game and tries to reach Level Thirteen.

The League of Jays helps the ninja escape from the Red Visors and leads them to Scott, the race car mechanic. As they cross the marketplace, the ninja make several discoveries.

Unfortunately, the game is rigged to be nearly impossible and Okino quickly fails his masters, who are dematerialized into cubes of energy. As more and more masters are \"cubed\", Okino begins to lose faith in his abilities. One day, Okino meets another Samurai like himself who is more successful in keeping her master alive. Okino internalizes this as a fault of his own so he trains and pushes himself as never before. Despite all his efforts, he loses more masters. Okino prepares to abandon his responsibilities when a final group of travellers arrive, seeking his help. It is the ninja.\n| LineColor       = 7CB9E8\n}}\n| Viewers         = 0.23\n| ShortSummary    =  The Samurai guide, Okino, leads the ninja into the first of Terra Karana's deadly challenges: The Forest of Discontent, made up of deep, dark woods, filled with booby-traps. As the ninja fight their way through it, they begin losing lives, but with Okino's help, they survive and reach the middle of the forest. There, they are ambushed by the Whack Rats but the ninja are able to fight them off. Lloyd ties up the leader, a rat named Richie. In order to procure his release, Richie tells Lloyd that he knows about a \"glitch\" in the game, which will allow the ninja to bypass the rest of the booby-traps and reach the other side of the Forest. Okino soon realizes Prime Empire is not a real place, merely a simulation and he is part of it. Lloyd releases Ritchie, who guides the ninja to the glitch and into an ambush by Red Visors.

Shifty sells the ninja some grappling hooks and rope. Unfortunately, the ninja don't have enough money to buy the \"Rope of Supreme Durability\" and opt instead for the \"Rope of Questionable Integrity\". Even worse, as they are buying the rope, they are spotted by one of Unagami's aerial drones. A squadron of Red Visors quickly arrives and pursues the ninja up the cliffs. The ninja, who only have ropes, must climb while the Red Visors have jet-boots and are able to catch up quickly. During the ensuing battle, Cole is nearly lost, but is saved at the last moment by Kai, who makes a daring leap onto the back of the flying drone and uses the drone to blast the Red Visors.

If Okino betrays them, Unagami promises to bring him with into the real world. He then disappears and restores the ninja back to normal. The ninja arrive at the heart of the maze and find themselves outmatched by the Red Dragon, and appeal to Okino for help.
