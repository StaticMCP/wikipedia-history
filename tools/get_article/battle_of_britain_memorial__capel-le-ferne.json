It is sited on the White Cliffs at Capel-le-Ferne, near Folkestone, on the coast of Kent.\nHistory\nIt was initiated by the Battle of Britain Memorial Trust, and opened by the Queen Mother on 9 July 1993. It is formed of a large propeller-shaped base, with the figure of a seated pilot carved by Harry Gray sitting at the centre.\nAlso on the site are replicas of a Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire and the Christopher Foxley-Norris Memorial Wall, on which appears the names of the almost 3,000 fighter aircrew who flew in the Battle.\nIn October 2010 The Duchess of Cornwall unveiled a bust of Air Chief Marshal Sir Keith Park by sculptor Will Davies at the site.\nThe Wing\nThe new visitor centre, 'The Wing' is an eye-catching design in the shape of a Spitfire wing, complete with dihedral angle.  Architects  Godden Allen Lawn, along with consulting engineers Crofton Consulting were appointed to undertake the building design with contractors Epps Construction undertaking the construction work.  The building was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 26 March 2015, and won 'Project of the Year' at the 2016 Kent Design and Development awards.\nConceived as an experience rather than a museum, the building contains The Scramble Experience and a central ‘cockpit’ area with an open balcony offering views across the Channel to France, from where the Luftwaffe would have appeared in 1940.  A high-tech screen is used to superimpose historical film of incoming German aircraft over the real view of the same scene.\nFile:Capel-le-Ferne - Battle of britain memorial 01.JPG\nFile:Capel-le-Ferne - Battle of britain memorial 02.JPG|Memorial Wall\nFile:Capel-le-Ferne - Battle of britain memorial 03.JPG|Spitfire Replica\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.battleofbritainmemorial.org/ Battle of Britain Memorial - homepage]\n*[http://www.harrygray.co.uk/ Harry Gray, Sculptor.
