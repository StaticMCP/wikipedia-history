The series was criticised by some for being wrought with historical inaccuracies. Critics also pointed out its unnecessary emphasis on Taiwan, a contemporary issue. Some major events during Kangxi's reign were omitted, such as his contributions to the Chinese language with the Kangxi Dictionary, and the contention for the succession among Kangxi's sons, which is featured more prominently in Yongzheng Dynasty.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*  [http://ent.sina.com.cn/v/f/kxdg.html Kangxi Dynasty] on Sina.com"
