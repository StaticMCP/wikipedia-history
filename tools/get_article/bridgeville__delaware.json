According to the 2020 census, the population is 2,568. It is part of the Salisbury, Maryland-Delaware Metropolitan Statistical Area.\nHistory\nThe town of Bridgeville is the oldest community in western Sussex County. Records of land transactions which were made in the first quarter of the 18th century suggest that a significant agricultural community already existed in the area by that period. A small group of houses had been built along the present Main Street by the turn of the 19th century; this settlement was known as \"Bridge Branch\" for the nearby stream, which was crossed by a bridge as early as 1730. By 1804, the community had grown sufficiently to merit the establishment of a post office.\nThe village was formally recognized in 1810, when an Act of the Assembly was passed to establish its name as \"Bridgeville\".  Early 19th century industries included a water-powered mill, tanyard, charcoal furnace, and fruit-drying business. The growth of the town accelerated greatly upon the arrival of the Delaware Railroad in Bridgeville in 1856.  The town was subsequently laid out for development by William Cannon (1809-1865).\nBridgeville's population was 613 in 1900.\nBridgeville was named for a bridge that was built in 1730 that was located over a tributary of the Nanticoke River.\nThe Bridgeville Historic District, Bridgeville Public Library, Old Bridgeville Fire House, and Sudler House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
