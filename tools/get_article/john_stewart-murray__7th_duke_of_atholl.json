She died in Italy on 9 July 1902, aged 58.\nTheir third son, Maj. Lord George Stewart-Murray, was reported missing after the First Battle of the Aisne on 12 September 1914.

The dukedom passed to his second but eldest surviving son, John Stewart-Murray, 8th Duke of Atholl, and later to his fourth son, Major James Stewart-Murray, 9th Duke of Atholl. Upon James' death in 1957, his fourth cousin, twice removed Iain Murray (1931–1996) succeeded as 10th Duke of Atholl. The Earldom of Strange and the Barony of Murray (both created 1786) became extinct. The Barony of Strange (created by error in 1628) fell into abeyance until John Drummond claimed it in 1965.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n|-"
