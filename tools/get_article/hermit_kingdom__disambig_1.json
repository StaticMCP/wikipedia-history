North Korea is the most commonly cited example of a hermit kingdom-like country due to its Juche state ideology which is heavily focused on isolationist and self-sufficient internal politics. Other less prominent quoted examples are Turkmenistan, Eritrea, and Bhutan.\nNorth Korea\nThe first country to be described as a \"hermit kingdom\" was Korea during the Joseon dynasty, in William Elliot Griffis's 1882 book Korea: The Hermit Nation.\nKorea, which had become increasingly isolationist since the 17th century, was frequently described as a hermit kingdom until 1905, when it became a protectorate of Japan. Today, historical Korea is split into South Korea and North Korea, two states with starkly contrasting economic ideologies. Whereas South Korea is a major developed economy and trade-dependent economy as well as a major importer of overseas goods, North Korea pursues largely isolationist state ideology known as Juche with a planned economy.\nCold War uses\nDuring the Cold War, Enver Hoxha's Albania was widely considered a \"hermit kingdom\" as it was a Stalinist regime, did not allow its ordinary citizens out of the country, and pursued autarky to become entirely self-sufficient. Unlike North Korea, Hoxha's regime, after the Sino-Albanian split, refused to ally with anyone and was hostile towards the entire world, which made it more isolationist than North Korea, which was then Stalinist but was allied with other Eastern Bloc states and did not become isolationist until after the end of the Cold War.\nModern use\nToday, the term is often applied to North Korea in news and social media, and in 2009, it was used by Hillary Clinton, then the United States Secretary of State.\nOther current countries considered isolationist \"hermit kingdoms\" include Turkmenistan,\nBelarus,\nEritrea,\nand the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.\nHistorically, the term has been applied to Nepal,\nLadakh,\nand Bhutan\nin the Himalayas.\nOther uses\nThe term \"hermit kingdom\" has also been used to describe Western Australia when it closed its borders during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSee also\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*"
