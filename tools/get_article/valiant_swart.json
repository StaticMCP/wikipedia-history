He wrote the song after the suicide of a young Afrikaans musician from Stellenbosch. Swart wrote it with the musician's mother in mind, longing for her lost son.\nHe adds in an interview: \"The song has since taken on a life of its own; it seems to have brought comfort to a lot of bereaved people, which, to be honest, makes me feel real good.\"\nThe song has been covered multiple times notably by Corlea Botha, Jurie Els, Laurika Rauch, Karen Zoid, Theuns Jordaan and Refentse.\nDiscography\nAlbums\n*Die Mystic Boer (1996)\n*Dorpstraat Revisited (1996)\n*Kopskoot (1997)\n*Roekeloos (1998)\n*Deur die Donker Vallei (1999)\n*Boland Punk (2001)\n*Maanhare (2002)\n*Song vir Katryn (2003)\n*‘n Jaar in die son (with Koos Kombuis) (2003)\n*@ Jinx (with Mel Botes) (2004)\n*Mystic Myle (2005)\n*Horisontaal (2006)\n*Vuur en Vlam (with Ollie Viljoen) (2007)\n*Vrydagaand/Saterdagaand (2008)\n*Wild en Wakker (with Ollie Viljoen) (2010)\n*Nagrit (2015)\nSingles\n*\"Dis my Kruis\" (1996)\n*\"Boomtown hotel\" (1996)\n*\"Die skoene moet jy dra\" (1996)\n*\"Dis 'n honde lewe\" (1997)\n*\"Eldorado\" (1997)\n*\"Ware liefde\" (1997)\n*\"Eyeshadow\" (1998)\n*\"Roekeloos\" (1998)\n*\"Sonvanger\" (2002)\n*\"Matrooslied\" (2002)\n*\"Jakarandastraat\" (2003)\n*\"Liefde in die suburbs\" (2003)\n*\"Dans met my baby\" (2003)\n*\"Die sewe af\" (2003)\n*\"Lekker verby\" (2003)\n*\"Dad se vastrap\" (2003)\n*\"Horisontaal\" (2006)\n*\"Vaalhoed se baas\" (2006)\n*\"Spook en diesel\" (2008)\n*\"Heaven Hill blues\" (2008)\n*\"Tema van jou lied\" (with Jack Parow) (2014)\nDVDs\n*Live in die Staatsteater (2003)\nAwards\n*Best Afrikaans Traditional Music Album (with Ollie Viljoen)[http://entertainment.bizcommunity.com/?p=451 » MTN South African Music Award Winners | entertainment.bizcommunity.com] - Vuur en Vlam: South African Music Awards 2008\nReferences"
