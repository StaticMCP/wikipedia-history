It has sleek lines and a graceful bow. It may be just a touch narrower than the boats that were built in the 1980s, but it still has the appearance of a contemporary yacht. Like the Ontario 32, the Viking was also designed by C&C and built by Ontario Yachts. Unlike the Ontario 32, this boat was designed with racing in mind.\"\nSee also\n*List of sailing boat types\nRelated development\n*Viking 34\nSimilar sailboats\n*Abbott 33\n*Alajuela 33\n*Arco 33\n*C&C 33\n*C&C 101\n*C&C SR 33\n*Cape Dory 33\n*Cape Dory 330\n*CS 33\n*Endeavour 33\n*Hans Christian 33\n*Hunter 33\n*Hunter 33-2004\n*Hunter 33.5\n*Hunter 333\n*Hunter 336\n*Hunter 340\n*Marlow-Hunter 33\n*Mirage 33\n*Moorings 335\n*Nonsuch 33\n*Tanzer 10\n*Watkins 33\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
