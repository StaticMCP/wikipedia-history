      "text": "# John Farley (historian)\n\nJohn Farley, born in Leicester on April 23, 1936, and died on November 10, 2015, was a Canadian science historian, author of several works and articles on the history of medicine. His work has had an influence on the sociology of scientific knowledge.\nIn a 1999 article and a 2003 book, D. Raynaud concludes that the apology for Félix Pouchet presented by Farley and Gerald L. Geison in their 1974 article on the controversy between Pouchet and Pasteur is futile.\nPublications\n* J. Farley et G.
