Captain Josef Pousette would be the one chosen to be in charge of the regiment in Shiraz, though Shiraz was 800 kilometers away which would be cleared on horseback.\nRoad to Shiraz\nNot much is known about the actual journey to Shiraz, though Pousette stated that at an overnight stay, he became \"lifelong\" friends with an insurgent.\nOperations in Shiraz and the battles of Kazerun\nWhile at Shiraz, Pousette was to patrol an important stretch of road to the town of Bushir, where they would engage several insurgents under Mohammed Ali in the Battles of Kazerun. The battles were bloody but it did end up being a costly gendarmerie victory, losing several gendarmes and at least one Swede. However Kazerun was not the only battle fought while at Shiraz, as some of the bloodiest battles during the Swedish intervention occurred in and around Shiraz.\nBesides military actions, Pousette met with German leadership in Shiraz.\nSee also\n*Persian campaign (World War I)\nReferences"
