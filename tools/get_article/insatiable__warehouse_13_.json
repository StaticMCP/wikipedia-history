It originally aired on September 19, 2011.\nPlot\nIn the forests of Ithaca, a young couple is attacked by an unseen creature. While at the hospital, Pete and Myka discover that the bite marks are human. Returning to the forest, they stumble upon Kevin Monroe eating a deer. Kevin appears zombie-like: his face is pale blue, and he is shivering. They take Kevin to the hospital.\nPete and Myka investigate Kevin's house, where they find his son and take him to the hospital where his dad is. While Artie cares for the boy, Pete and Myka follow-up on a police call about an individual eating a squirrel reported as having the same symptoms as Kevin. Pete is bitten while apprehending this person, but Myka starts showing signs; she begins to shiver.\nPete theorizes that the people are zombies, and Artie learns from Kevin's son that the artifact responsible is from a taco truck both victims visited. When they arrive at the taco truck, they are attacked by zombies. Myka turns on Pete; he enters the taco truck and sees a tip jar. Pete realizes that this is the artifact causing the problems: the tip jar is from the Donner Party's ill-fated journey. He destroys the tip jar, neutralizing its effect.\nMeanwhile, Claudia is offered a role in a band by the guitarist Dwayne Maddox. Claudia is also told that \"death comes for you this night\" by Sallah, the Soothsaying Sultan, a fortune-telling booth, and an additional artifact. That night, a statue nearly falls on her, among other misfortunes.\nClaudia fails to end the accidents and is nearly drowned by the \"Eau de Vie Faucet.\" She is rescued by Leena, who explains that the fortune-telling booth artifact works by overwhelming the user with dread, so if Claudia ignores it, she will be fine. Claudia accepts the offer from Dwayne to join the band, and they embrace.\nThe episode concludes with Steve Jinks in a bar, unable to pay his tab because Mrs. Fredric has cut his credit. Marcus Diamond approaches Steve with the offer to pay his bill, asking that Steve join his panel against the Warehouse. Steve accepts the offer and is impressed when Marcus jumps off a building. Mrs. Fredric is seen smiling in satisfaction.\nCultural references\n* Claudia plays \"Cherry Bomb\" by The Runaways. She would play the song again with Cherie Currie in the Season 4 episode \"Runaway.\"\n* Artie references the movie Animal House, which chronicles the adventures of a bunch of frat boys who spend most of their time partying and playing pranks on authority figures.\n* Pete references This Is Spinal Tap, when stating, \"I'm gonna crank this baby up to 11.\"\n* The episode makes many references to popular culture zombie movies, most notably Dawn of the Dead.\nArtifacts and jokes\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Artifact !! Description !! Seen/Mentioned\n|-\n| Glass Jar from the Donner Party || Placing money in the jar activates this artifact. This is because the Donner Party would bury money in similar glass jars during their long winter. The artifact first causes a severe drop in body temperature, then causes photosensitivity and an extreme carnivorous craving. Pete shattered the jar to negate its effect on people, but the shards of glass were stored in the Warehouse. || Seen\n|-\n| Sallah the Soothsaying Sultan Fortune-Telling || Not a fortune teller but a hypnotist who causes feelings of extreme dread in people. Accidentally activated by Claudia when she asked why Steve was \"being such a tool\" while standing in front of it. To negate the effects, you have to ignore Sallah's prediction actively. || Seen\n|-\n| Gargoyle Statue || Unknown effect; was on a shelf near Sallah the Soothsaying Sultan, fell from a high shelf just as Claudia passed under it. It could be that this is its effect;– to try and crush somebody walking under it. The statue was shattered when it hit the floor. || Seen\n|-\n| Albert Butz's Eyeglasses || Wearing these eyeglasses raises body temperature. Albert Butz was the inventor of the thermostat. || Seen\n|-\n| Eau de Vie Faucet || The water that pours from this faucet will attack the nearest living person, encasing them within a bubble of water and drowning them. Once freed, the trapped individual dries within seconds. || Seen\n|-\n| Cinderella's Glass Knife || Stabbing someone with this knife changes them to glass. The effects can be reversed, and the wound healed if the knife is pulled out before the body is completely changed.
