Unlike most messaging clients, it is not graphical; it runs from the console using the ncurses library. naim is free software, licensed under the GNU GPL.\nnaim is a multiplatform program. It is primarily aimed at Unix-like systems.\nnaim uses the AOL instant messenger TOC protocol instead of the OSCAR protocol. This means naim lacks some features other instant messaging services have.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Martin Brown (7 September 2005) [https://web.archive.org/web/20100316184532/http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/free_irc Free IRC clients, Choosing the best IRC client for your needs], Free Software Magazine issue 7, web page 3\n* Robert Shingledecker, John Andrews, Christopher Negus, The official Damn Small Linux book: the tiny adaptable Linux that runs on anything, Prentice Hall, 2008, , p.&nbsp;64\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20020526235241/http://naim.n.ml.org/ naim web site]"
