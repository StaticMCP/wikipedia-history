Baxley. Unlike many other television adaptations of King's work, Storm of the Century was not based on a novel but was an original screenplay written by the author and directly produced for television. King described the screenplay as a \"novel for television\". The screenplay was published as a mass-market book in February 1999 prior to the TV broadcast of the miniseries.\nKing has called Storm of the Century his personal favorite of all the TV productions related to his works.\nPlot\nAs the people of Little Tall Island, Maine prepare for a powerful blizzard in 1989, elderly resident Martha Clarendon is brutally murdered by a menacing stranger. Town manager Robbie Beals investigates, and the stranger terrifies him by relating shameful secrets from his past. Mike Anderson, a supermarket manager and part-time constable, arrests the stranger, who identifies himself as André Linoge. Linoge seems to know the names and morbid secrets of all the island's residents and is particularly interested in Mike's son Ralphie, who has a birthmark on his nose. Yet he gives no hint of his own background, saying only, \"Give me what I want, and I'll go away.\" While sitting in a jail cell, Linoge possesses the minds of several townspeople, causing suicides and a murder. He then escapes the jail in his true form of an old wizard and repeats his demand before disappearing into the storm.\nThe residents take shelter from the storm in the town hall. As they sleep, Linoge appears on the televisions as a televangelist and lectures them on the consequences of refusing to accommodate a stranger. The residents have the same dream in which authorities find the island deserted after the storm and the word \"Croaton\" carved on a tree. A news reporter connects the disappearance to the lost Roanoke Colony. Meanwhile Mike dreams that the townspeople walk into the ocean and drown. The next day, Linoge causes three residents to vanish while everyone is watching the lighthouse collapse. Two die, and the third, Angie Carver, is discovered alive but visibly aged. Ralphie goes missing and, when found in a closet, says that he was with Linoge. With each death and abduction, Linoge sends his demand again. While gathering supplies and toys for the children, Mike deduces that the name Linoge is an anagram and that Linoge's real name is Legion, similar to the biblical story of Jesus casting demons out of a man and into a herd of pigs.\nThe town's children fall under a spell and go to sleep, dreaming that they are flying through the clouds with Linoge. That evening Mike finds Linoge inside the town hall holding a resident hostage. Amused by Mike's sympathy for the townspeople, Linoge says that they are all sinners and criminals who merely pretend to be decent. He tells Mike to arrange a town meeting at 9:00 that night and escapes again. When the meeting gathers, Linoge tells the residents that he has lived thousands of years and, having grown old and sick, he wants a child whom he can raise to be a sorcerer like him. He cannot take a child by force, but the dream that the residents had will come true if they refuse. He leaves them to debate for half an hour. Mike urges the people to stand up to Linoge and is horrified when all of them, even his wife Molly, decide to give in. Linoge returns and presides over a lottery in which Ralphie is chosen. Taking his wizard form once more, Linoge contemptuously thanks the residents and advises them never to speak about what has happened. He then walks out of the town hall with Ralphie in his arms and flies into the night sky. Mike rushes outside, ignoring all the terrified people (including his distraught wife), and falls to his knees in the snow; begging for Ralphie back.\nIn an epilogue, Mike now lives on the other side of the country. He resigned as sheriff, divorced Molly, severed ties with the people including those he once viewed as friends, and left Little Tall for good. He returns to college and becomes a United States Marshal in San Francisco. The heartbroken and thoroughly depressed Molly later marries Hatch, the new town constable who was Mike's deputy. Several residents of Little Tall commit suicide over the years after struggling with remorse. One day Linoge and Ralphie walk past Mike in Chinatown, Ralphie having become corrupted and evil. Mike considers telling Molly what he saw, but accepts that some truths are best kept as secrets.\nCast\nProduction\nThe screenplay for the miniseries was written by Stephen King expressly for television. The screenplay was published as a mass-market book by Pocket Books just prior to the initial airing of Storm of the Century on ABC. The book included photographs of the TV miniseries. The book contains an introduction in which King describes the genesis of the idea as it occurred to him in late 1996. Beginning to write it in December 1996, he initially debated if the story should be either a novel or a screenplay. He described the result as a \"novel for television\". A hardcover edition, written as a screenplay rather than \"prose\", was published concurrently by the Book of the Month Club.\nStorm of the Century was filmed in Southwest Harbor, Maine and Toronto in 1998.\nRelease and reception\nStorm of the Century aired on ABC on February 14–18, 1999. It was released on DVD on June 22 the same year.\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 82% based on 22 reviews, with an average rating of 7.33/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Chilling performances and an even darker moral dilemma shelter Storm of the Century's somewhat long-winded tale from ever being anything less than watchable.\"\nDirector Mike Flanagan has cited Storm of the Century as a major influence on his 2021 Netflix miniseries Midnight Mass.\nU.S. Television Ratings:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!No.\n!Title\n!Original air date\n!U.S. viewers\n(millions)\n|-\n!1\n|Storm of the Century, Part 1\n|February 14, 1999\n|19.4\n|-\n!2\n|Storm of the Century, Part 2\n|February 15, 1999\n|18.9\n|-\n!3\n|Storm of the Century, Part 3\n|February 18, 1999\n|19.2\n|}\nSee also\n* List of adaptations of works by Stephen King\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
