Many, including the Guru’s mother, urged him to accept Wazir Khan’s offer of safe passage, backed by an oath on the Quran and promises from the hill chiefs. Knowing the enemy’s deceit, the Guru tested their sincerity by sending out bullock carts filled with worthless items, which were immediately looted. Despite this betrayal, continued pressure from his followers and mother left him with no choice but to agree to leave. On the night of December 20-21, 1704, under cold winds and rain, the Guru’s family and a group of Sikhs left first, led by Udai Singh, while the Guru planned to follow. However, as they moved out, the Mughals and hill forces broke their oath and attacked, leading to the chaotic and tragic Battle of Sarsa, where the Sikhs were scattered, and many lost their lives.\nBattle\nThe Sarsa River, usually dry, had turned into a powerful, raging current due to heavy rains in the hills, making it impossible to cross. The first group of Sikhs waited on the riverbank for Guru Gobind Singh to arrive. The Guru set out with his two elder sons and about 400 Sikhs. Before he could reach the river, his group was attacked by a large Mughal force under Wazir Khan. While the Guru and his men were engaged in battle, another Mughal unit launched an assault on the Sikhs waiting by the riverbank.\nAmidst the rain, cold, darkness, and fierce fighting, confusion spread among the Sikhs. Many were killed, including Udai Singh and his warriors. Some courageous Sikhs attempted to cross the dangerous river on horseback, carrying the Guru’s family with them. Though they reached the other side safely, they lost all their belongings, including important manuscripts, to the floodwaters. After crossing the river, the Guru’s family was separated. His mother, Mata Gujri, along with his two younger sons, Baba Zorawar Singh and Fateh Singh, were unable to travel far. They were taken in by Gangu, a former servant of the Guru’s household, who led them to his village, Saheri. Meanwhile, Mata Sundari and Mata Sahib Devi disguised themselves as village women and moved toward Ambala for safety.  Gobind Singh and his men also suffered heavy losses. Despite fighting bravely, most of his warriors were either killed in battle or drowned while trying to cross the river. By the time he reached the other side, only 43 Sikhs remained with him, including his two elder sons, Ajit Singh and Jujhar Singh, the \"Five Beloved Ones\" (Panj Pyare), and other warriors. As they continued their journey, they received alarming news—nearly a thousand Mughal soldiers were marching toward them from Sirhind, while another force was crossing the Sarsa River.\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\n*"
