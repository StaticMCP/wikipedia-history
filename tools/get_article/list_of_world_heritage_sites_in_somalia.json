Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Somalia accepted the convention on July 23, 2020, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. , Somalia recorded three sites on its tentative list.\nTentative list\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural. In addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. Ethiopia maintains three properties on its tentative list.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (gobol or federal member state)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" | UNESCO criteria\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Bushbushle National Park\n|\n|Lower Juba\n| align=\"center\" |2024\n|ix, x (natural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |The Hobyo grass and Shrubland\n|\n|Galmudug\n| align=\"center\" |2024\n|ix, x (natural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mogadishu Secondo-Lido Lighthouse\n|\n|Benadir\n| align=\"center\" | 2025\n|i, ii, iii, iv (cultural)\n|\n|}\nReferences"
