Hodgson (25 April 186615 April 1937) was a Scottish artist, etcher, and illustrator who began a career on the sea, but after an injury, switched to art. He is probably best known as the illustrator of 17 boys' adventure books by Percy F. Westerman.\nBiography\nEdward was born in the afternoon of 25 April 1866 at Arbroath, Angus, Scotland.}} His father Alfred (c. 18521881), a machinist from Bordeaux France was then employed as a railway mechanic. His mother was Jessie Hanton Dryden (born c. 1833).\nHodgson began his career as a sailor, but owing to an accident to his leg, he was forced to give up the sea. As he had a flair for painting, he took up art and was trained by W. M. Grubb at the High School of Dundee.\nHodgson married Mary Wilson Crowe (14 Feb 187116 February 1945) in St Peter's Parish, Dundee, on 4 June 1894, and the marriage was registered the following day. Mary was the daughter of David Crowe, a wine and spirit merchant. The couple had at least three children:\n*David Crowe Hodgson (16 August 189521 July 1937)}}\n*Ronald Hodgson (born 27 February 1899)\n*George Dryden Hodgson (17 May 190220 November 1955)\nHodgson moved to England in 1894, settling at Bushey, Hertfordshire. His address in the 1911 census was St. Ninians, Finch Lane, Bushey. He was still at that address when he died in 1937, as was his wife when she died in 1945.\nHodgson continued to work until almost the end of his life. He died on Thursday 15 April 1937 at Watford Peace Memorial Hospital. He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on Saturday, 24 April 1937.}} Mary was staying at Shepherds' Hotel in Deal, Kent on 29 September 1939, at the time of the 1939 Register. She was still living at home in Finch Lane when she died on 26 February 1945 at 60 Vicarage Road, at the home of her widowed daughter-in-law. Her estate was valued at £8,465 9s. 2d.\nCareer\nAfter abandoning his maritime career he studied art. However, ships and the sea were a constant feature of his output, especially as an illustrator. He was successful at the Dundee School of Art and was awarded the grade \"good with a certificate\" for both freehand drawing and practical geometry in the Second Grade exams 1884.  The following year he was awarded a first class art teachers certificate in Practical Plane and solid geometry, and a second class certificate in Building Construction, Elementary Stage, as well as a teachers certificate in drawing and shading groups of models in the Third Class exams at the Dundee School of Art. He used his certificate and taught art in several private schools in the district.\nHe established a studio in Reform Street, Dundee. He was a frequent exhibitor in Dundee, mainly of landscapes and seascapes. He exhibited The Lass that Baits the Line at the Dundee Fine Art Exhibition in 1886, and it was adjudged to be \"a small but promising work in its execution.\" He showed a \"beautiful watercolour of Dundee\" and three \"very clever\" oil paintings at the Annual Exhibition of the Dundee Art Club in 1888. Hodgson was elected vice president of the newly formed \"Graphic Arts Association\" in January 1890, and was re-elected at the end of the year. He exhibited one work at the 1890 Dundee Fine Art Exhibition and five at the same venue in 1891. The Dundee Directory of 1890-91 gave Hodgson as the Vice President of the Dundee Graphics Arts Association, and living at Baldovan Villa, Baldovan, Dundee.\nHodgson was not only a painter an illustrator, but also an etcher. He produced prints of two etchings in 1891 which were said to be \"extremely pleasing both in conception and execution\" and showed his \"attainment of very creditable mastery of the technique of the etcher's art.\" In that year also he produced a portfolio of six etchings of scenes in Dundee, The artists proofs of the etchings, signed by Hodgson, were offered for sale in 1926 for 12s 6d. (£0.625) each unframed.}} which were said to be \"graceful transcripts of local scenery\". In the following year, his etching of Dundee from the River was accepted by Queen Victoria, whose private secretary thanked Hodgson for his \"finely executed etching.\"  The etching had been published by Liddle of Dundee. In 1894 Hodson had \"a beautiful etching\" of Fettes College, Edinburgh published by print makers Dickinson and Foster of Bond Street in London.\nIn 1894 Hodgson moved to Bushey, Hertfordshire to study under Hubert von Herkomer at the art school he had established there in 1883. When he exhibited a landscape By Mead and Stream at the Dundee Find Art Exhibition in the following year the Dundee Advertiser said that the landscape showed \"how much he had profited by his studies under Herkomer.\"\nMagazine illustration\nBy 1900 he was illustrating for magazines, and his work eventually appeared in, among others:\n*The Captain\n*''Cassell's Family Magazine\n*Chums\n*The Girl's Realm\n*The Graphic\n*The Illustrated London News\n*Little Folks\n*The Pall Mall Magazine\n*Pearson's Magazine\n*The Quiver\n*The Royal Magazine\n*The Sphere\n*The Strand Magazine\n*The Wide World Magazine\n*The Windsor Magazine\n*The Sketch''\nDuring the First World War Hodgson worked for the Graphic, mainly producing pen and ink illustrations of the war at sea.\nBook illustration\nIn 1896, Hodgson illustrated a reissue of Victor Hugo's The Toilers of the Sea.
