Kozyck's delighted when Savard innocently digs up scandalous dirt on the show's star, causing a red-faced Barnes to cancel the fluff piece.\n|LineColor=\n}}\n}}\nReception\nManuel Mendoza of The Dallas Morning News rated the series a B− say that it \"tries to do for journalism what The West Wing does for politics — make it sexy again\". However, Mendoza goes on to say that the series \"is not as snappily written or as heroically shot as The West Wing, but it has the same chaotic, frenetic energy\". Preston Turegano of The San Diego Union-Tribune said the pilot episode is \"predictable, familiar and mired with some cliches\" before conceding that the show has \"some original and humorous moments\". Joanne Ostrow of The Denver Post called it a \"smart, expensive, well-cast series\", \"even if it's an uneven effort\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
