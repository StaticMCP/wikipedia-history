The road links Ring Road Central through the Ridge and Ministries area toward Liberation Road, passing near several national landmarks such as Black Star Square and the National Theatre of Ghana.\nHistory\nThe avenue was originally part of the colonial-era Victoriaborg district, which housed European administrative offices. It was redeveloped in the 1950s as part of President Kwame Nkrumah’s urban vision for a modern capital city symbolizing national pride and independence. Upon Ghana's independence in 1957, the street was renamed Independence Avenue to mark the country's liberation from British rule.\nRoute and layout\nIndependence Avenue runs east–west through Accra's civic zone, beginning near Ring Road Central and terminating close to Liberation Road near the Kotoka International Airport corridor. It serves as a link between several key government and cultural institutions, including the National Theatre of Ghana, Accra International Conference Centre, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration.\nLandmarks\nNotable landmarks along Independence Avenue include:\n* Black Star Square (Independence Square) – Ghana's main parade ground and site of national celebrations.\n* Independence Arch – commemorating the 1957 independence movement.\n* National Theatre of Ghana – performing arts venue with unique Chinese–Ghanaian architecture.\n* Accra International Conference Centre – major conference and diplomatic venue.\n* Ghana Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other government ministries housed along the Ministries enclave.\nEconomy\nIndependence Avenue functions as both a political and economic hub, accommodating embassies, state offices, and corporate headquarters. Its proximity to central Accra's government makes it a corridor for diplomacy and public administration.\nThe road also serves as a tourism highlight for visitors exploring Accra's national monuments. Tour guides frequently include stops along Independence Avenue in city tours that trace Ghana's political history.\nTransport and accessibility\nIndependence Avenue forms part of Accra’s arterial network, intersecting with key roads like Castle Road and 28 February Road. It is accessible via public buses, taxis, and private vehicles. However, during national events such as the Independence Day parade and Republic Day celebrations, sections of the avenue are closed to traffic to accommodate ceremonies and security arrangements.\nIn culture\nIndependence Avenue frequently appears in Ghanaian newsreels, national broadcasts, and documentaries that depict the country’s political history. It is often used as the route for parades, demonstrations, and state funerals, symbolizing Ghana’s postcolonial identity and civic pride.\nSee also\n* Black Star Square\n* National Theatre of Ghana\n* Accra\n* Transport in Ghana\n* Osu, Accra\nReferences"
