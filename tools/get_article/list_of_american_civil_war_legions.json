The popularity of this type of unit had declined by the time of the American Civil War owing to the difficulty of organizing and maintaining its disparate elements; nevertheless, the Confederate Congress authorized the raising of at least ten legions. Units called legions for other reasons are also included.\nConfederate legions\n*Cherokee Legion, a short-lived unit of the Georgia State Guard organized in 1863.
