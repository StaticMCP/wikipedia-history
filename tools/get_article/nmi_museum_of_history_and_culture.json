The museum has repatriated a significant number of historic objects from the Marianas that were held nationally and internationally in private collections and by foreign museums, companies, and militaries. More than one million dollars has been invested in its collections. The historical buildings on the grounds have been renovated to preserve them, prevent further deterioration, and safeguard visitors. The museum is located across from Sugar King Park.\nThe museum carries out school programs, hosts field trips for local and international primary and secondary students, and provides assistance to a variety of Northern Marianas College classes. The museum sees visitors and researchers from East Asia, North America, Australia, other islands in Micronesia. It provides assistance related to land matters, ammunition depots, chemical storage areas, past commercial activity, and other matters that require research of historic information. The museum is the end recipient of all of the historic material derived from land surveys and pre-development archaeological work. It is by law the repository of all of the historic objects of the CNMI, charged with their preservation, management, and maintenance. The museum loans objects to American Memorial Park and partners with the Marianas Visitors Authority, CNMI Arts Council, and other organizations for events.\nIt is operated under the Saipan municipality  and listed in the Pacific Islands Museums Association Directory. It is part of the Garapan Heritage Trail, a project of the Northern Marianas Humanities Council with financial support by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Office of Insular Affairs, United States Department of the Interior.\nHistory\nThe museum was created by CNMI Public Law 10-5, which was enacted in 1996.

The museum preserves items donated to it by the families of American and Japanese veterans and Japanese, Okinawan, Korean, Chamorro, and Carolinian people who lived in the islands before and during the Pacific War.\nIn the 2020s, the museum plans to construct temporary huts to provide a venue for local artists to teach, display, and sell local products to guests. The CNMI Department of Community and Cultural Affairs, CNMI Arts Council, Indigenous Affairs Office, and the Chamorro Indigenous Affairs, and Carolinian Affairs Offices have expressed support. The museum also desires to build a Chamorro and Carolinian cultural center similar to Hawaii's Polynesian Cultural Center.\nBuildings\nThe museum is located at the old Japanese hospital, which was a medical facility on Saipan between 1926 and 1944. It is the largest Japanese building on the island to survive the war. The hospital was listed on National Register of Historic Places in 1974.\nIn 2019, the Japanese laboratory adjacent to the hospital building was renovated and is the proposed site for the museum gift and coffee shop. The structure will be repurposed to help generate revenue for the museum.\nFunding\nThe museum has experienced inadequate funding in the 21st century. In the 2000s and 2010s, there were cuts to its operational budget and personnel. Staff had to pay out of their own pockets for gallery light bulbs, lawn maintenance equipment, computers, museum vehicles and fuel, and other supplies. They also had to volunteer their unpaid time to keep the museum open late and on weekends for tours, presentations, and other activities.\nSome museum property was damaged or lost because of the lack of funds for renovations and preservation, as well as from tropical storms. In 2000, floods caused by heavy rains caused minor damages to artifacts and displays. In October 2008, a heavy downpour flooded the museum, which brought several inches of water and mud into the exhibition areas and administrative offices. In 2015, the museum and trees on the grounds sustained damage from Typhoon Soudelor. There was moisture and water damage. Vegetation grew in cracks of the building. The buildings had foundation issues. Damaged artifacts included a prehistoric Chamorro canoe, Japanese period photographs, Japanese military uniforms and gear, artifacts from a Spanish galleon, books on the history of the Concepcion, and remains of Pacific War soldiers.\nIn May 2014, leftover funds from the class action against the Saipan garment industry were donated to the museum.\nIn March 2019, the museum partnered with the Saipan Southern High School Student Council for a carwash fundraiser to support the institution.\nBenefactors\nThe Director of the museum told the Saipan Tribune, \"...there are students visiting and we want to help preserve the culture of the CNMI and to promote it as a tourist attraction\" and that benefactors will be \"investing in the future of the children of the CNMI.\"\nIn 2004, Pacific Development Inc. on Saipan provided financial assistance to the museum.\nThe museum has limited space for storage, curatorial and administrative work, and research. In 2017, the United States Department of Defense, Saipan Shipping Company, and IT&E donated three twenty foot containers that were modified to hold human remains and artifacts in the museum's possession.\nIn 2017, IT&E committed three small air-conditioning units for the museum. In the late 2010s, the museum received grants from the Marianas Visitors Authority to preserve the building and to safeguard its exhibits and IT&E Saipan provided phone, fax, and internet services.\nIn June 2018, McDonald's Saipan presented a $3,000 check to the NMI Museum. In July 2018, the Marianas Young Professionals raised over $2,000 for the museum, which included a $1,000 donation from Duty Free Saipan (DFS) Ltd.\nIn 2020, the Tan Siu Lin Foundation of the Tan Holdings Corporation donated to the museum.\nReferences"
