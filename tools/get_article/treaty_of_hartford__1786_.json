The area in dispute included all of western New York State west of, approximately, Seneca Lake, extending all the way to the Niagara River and Lake Erie, and north to south from the shore of Lake Ontario to the Pennsylvania border.\nTerms\nNew York and Massachusetts agreed to divide the rights in question with a treaty signed December 16. The states agreed that all of the land in question, about 6 million acres (24,000&nbsp;km2), would be recognized as part of New York State. Massachusetts, in return, obtained the right of preemption, the title to all of the land, giving it the exclusive right to extinguish by purchase the possessory rights of the Indian tribes (except for a narrow strip along the Niagara River, the title to which was recognized to belong to New York). The compact also provided that Massachusetts could sell or assign its preemptive rights.\nAftermath\nOn April 1, 1788, Massachusetts sold its rights to the entire six million acres (24,000&nbsp;km2) to Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham, known as the Phelps and Gorham Purchase, for $1,000,000, payable in three equal annual installments, and payable in specie or in certain Massachusetts securities then trading at about 20 cents on the dollar, the money used to repay some of the state's debt from the Revolutionary War. Similar western boundary issues involving these and other states were resolved by the Northwest Ordinance passed by the Congress of the Confederation in July 1787.\nSee also\n*Phelps and Gorham Purchase\n*Holland Land Company\n*The Holland Purchase\n*The Morris Reserve\n*The Pulteney Association\nReferences"
