It included Greenwich Parish and parts of Hampton, Kars, and Norton Parishes but part of the modern parish along the Kennebecasis River was in Westfield Parish.\nIn 1795 Kings County's parishes were reorganised, erecting Hampton and Norton.\nIn 1844 the boundary with Norton was altered.\nBoundaries\nKingston Parish is bounded:\n*on the northwest by the Long Reach of the Saint John River and Belleisle Bay;\n*on the east by a line beginning on the shore of Belleisle Bay at the end of the western line of the William Roden grant, nearly due north of the junction of Route 845 and Kiersteadville Road, the road is spelt Kiersteadville.}} then running south-southwesterly along the grant line to the rear of the grant, then southwesterly  about 300 metres along the northern line of the Jeremiah Maybe grant to its northwestern corner, then southeasterly along its western line for about 1.2 kilometres, then turning left 90º and running northeasterly parallel to the rear line of the Belleisle Bay shore grants until it strikes Rogers Road, then southeasterly along the prolongation of the eastern line of the John & Peter Cable grant on the Kennebecasis River until it strikes the rear of the Cable grant, about 1.3 kilometres northeast of Route 845 and near the northern bank of Pickwauket Brook, then west-southwesterly along the rear of the Kennebecasis River grants, including a dogleg toward the river, until it reaches the northwestern corner of the Freedom Burdock grant, about 150 metres past the Ketchum Road, then southeasterly along the western line of the Burdock grant to the Kennebecasis River;\n*on the southeast by the Kennebecasis River;\n*on the southwest by the southwestern line of the Stephen Baxter grant on Milkish Creek, prolonged southeasterly to the Saint John County line in the Kennebecasis, then northwesterly about 2.7 kilometres along the Baxter grant until it strikes the prolongation of the main tier of grants on the Kennebecasis, then northeasterly along the rear of the tier until it strikes the prolongation of the line between two grants to Robert and Caleb Merrit on the Long Reach, then northwesterly along the prolongation and the grant line to the Long Reach;\n*including Long Island and Mather Island in the Kennebecasis.\nGovernance\nBefore 2023, the entire parish formed the local service district of the parish of Kingston, established in 1968 to assess for fire protection. Non-fire related rescue was added in 2015. First aid and ambulance services (1976–2015) was formerly included.\nCommunities\nCommunities at least partly within the parish.\n*Bedford\n*Centreton\n*Chapel Grove\n*Clifton Royal\n*Elmhurst\n*Erbs Cove\n*Grays Mills\n*Holderville\n*Kingston\n*Kingston Corner\n*Long Reach\n*Lower Kingston\n*Moss Glen\n*Perry Point\n*Reeds Point\n*Shampers\n*The Cedars\n*Waltons Lake\n*Whitehead\n*Whites Bluff\n*Whites Mills\nBodies of water\nBodies of water at least partly in the parish.\n*Kennebecasis River\n**North Channel\n*Saint John River\n*Gorhams Creek\n*Kingston Creek\n*Salmon Creek\n*Belleisle Bay\n*at least twenty officially named lakes\nIslands\nIslands at least partly in the parish.\n*Long Island\n*Mather Island\nDemographics\nPopulation\nPopulation trend\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
