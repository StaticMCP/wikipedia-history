It is bordered to the north by the Belt Parkway and Conduit Avenue in Ozone Park, to the south by Jamaica Bay in Broad Channel, to the east by 102nd–104th Streets in South Ozone Park, and to the west by 75th Street in East New York, Brooklyn. The area consists mostly of low-rise single-family detached houses.\nHoward Beach is located in Queens Community District 10 and its ZIP Code is 11414. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department's 106th Precinct. Politically, Howard Beach is represented by the New York City Council's 32nd District.\nHistory\n]]\nEarly development\nHoward Beach was established in 1897 by William J. Howard, a Brooklyn glove manufacturer who operated a  goat farm on meadow land near Aqueduct Racetrack as a source of skin for kid gloves. In 1897, he bought more land and filled it in. In the following year, he built 18 cottages. He opened a hotel near the water, which he ran until it was destroyed by fire in October 1907. Gradually, he bought more land. In 1909, he formed the Howard Estates Development Company. He dredged and filled the land until he was able to accumulate  by 1914. He laid out several streets, water mains and gas mains, and built 35 houses that were priced in the $2,500–$5,000 range.\nThe Long Island Rail Road established a station named Ramblersville in 1905 and a Post Office by the same name opened soon thereafter. A casino, beach, and fishing pier were added in 1915 and the name of the neighborhood was changed to Howard Beach on April 6, 1916. Development continued and ownership was expanded to a group of investors who sold lots for about $690 each starting in 1922. Development, however, was limited to the areas east of Cross Bay Boulevard near the LIRR station now known as Bernard Coleman Memorial Square (then Lilly Place). The rest of Howard Beach consisted of empty marsh land except for the area to the south of Coleman Square, centered around Russell and 102nd Streets, which consisted of many small fishing bungalows that dotted alongside Hawtree Creek and Jamaica Bay. This area of Howard Beach retained the name Ramblersville. In 1919, the LIRR established opened the Hamilton Beach station, located about a quarter-mile south of the Howard Beach station at Coleman Square.\nAfter World War II, Queens and Long Island experienced a significant suburban building boom. The marshland west of Cross Bay Boulevard was filled in, paving the way for the construction of numerous Cape Cod and High Ranch-style homes on  and  lots. This area was developed as Rockwood Park to the north and Spring Park to the south, together comprising what would be known as New Howard Beach, while the area east of the boulevard became known as Old Howard Beach.\nIn the early 1950s, farmland north of Rockwood Park was transformed with the addition of red-brick, two-story garden-style cooperative apartments, six-story co-op and condo buildings, and private two-family homes. This new neighborhood was named Lindenwood. Development continued through the 1960s and 1970s, with Cross Bay Boulevard emerging as the primary shopping district for the area.\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, many older homes in the neighborhood were demolished and replaced with McMansions.\nPost-1980s\nHate crimes\nIn 1986 and 2005, Howard Beach became the site of two widely publicized anti-Black hate crimes.\nOn December 20, 1986, Michael Griffith, a 23-year-old Black man, was killed in Howard Beach following a racial attack. Griffith, along with Cedric Sandiford and Timothy Grimes, sought assistance in Howard Beach after their car broke down on Cross Bay Boulevard. They were attacked by a group of white youths at New Park Pizza, severely beating Griffith and Sandiford. Fleeing the assault, Griffith ran onto the Belt Parkway and was struck and killed by a car. New York City Mayor Ed Koch compared the attack to a lynching.\nBlack civil rights activists organized protests in Howard Beach and surrounding neighborhoods, calling for boycotts of white-owned businesses. During protests, mostly Black marchers carried signs comparing Howard Beach to apartheid-era South Africa, while white residents displayed racist signs. Three local teenagers—Jon Lester, Scott Kern, and Jason Ladone—were convicted of manslaughter, while another assailant was acquitted.\nOn June 29, 2005, a group of local white men in Howard Beach attacked three Black men with baseball bats, resulting in one victim being hospitalized with serious injuries. Police arrested two of the attackers, including Nicholas Minucci, who claimed the victims had attempted to rob him. Minucci, 20, was found guilty on June 10, 2006 of robbery and the racist attack of Glenn Moore, during which he used a racial slur. On July 17, 2006, Minucci was sentenced to 15 years in prison.\nHurricane Sandy\nAs Hurricane Sandy approached New York on October 28, 2012, city officials ordered the evacuation of residents in Zone A neighborhoods, including the Hamilton Beach section of Howard Beach, due to the threat of severe storm surges. Most of Howard Beach was in Zone B, where evacuation was voluntary. Many residents chose to remain, influenced by the relatively minor impact of Hurricane Irene the previous year.\nOn October 29, Sandy made landfall, bringing a ten-foot storm surge from Jamaica Bay that flooded Old Howard Beach, New Howard Beach, Broad Channel, the Rockaways, parts of Lindenwood, and sections of Ozone Park. The storm caused widespread destruction, including extensive damage to homes, businesses along Cross Bay Boulevard, the Howard Beach–JFK Airport subway station, and the IND Rockaway Line trestle over Jamaica Bay. Power outages lasted upwards three weeks.\nAfter Sandy, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the New York City Office of Emergency Management provisionally re-classified Howard Beach, along with the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Gerritsen Beach and Red Hook, as Zone A neighborhoods. The Howard Beach post office, heavily damaged during the storm, reopened on April 5, 2013, following significant repairs.\nGeography\n]]\nLike many New York City neighborhoods, Howard Beach is composed of several smaller neighborhoods including Howard Beach, Old Howard Beach, Hamilton Beach, Ramblersville, Spring Park, Rockwood Park, Lindenwood, and Howard Park. Often, Old Howard Beach, Ramblersville, Howard Park, and Hamilton Beach are collectively referred to as \"Old Howard Beach.\" The main section of Howard Beach is a small peninsula bordered by the Belt Parkway and Conduit Avenue to the north, Jamaica Bay to the south, Hawtree Creek to the east (separating it from Hamilton Beach), and Shellbank Basin to the west, which separates it from Cross Bay Boulevard.\nCross Bay Boulevard serves as Howard Beach's primary commercial hub. In the 1970s and 1980s, it was lined predominantly with locally owned shops and restaurants. Since the 1990s, chain stores and franchises have become more prominent along the boulevard. Former entertainment landmarks included Kiddie-Park and Cross-Bay Lanes. The Joseph P. Addabbo Memorial Bridge, named after a former U.S. Representative from the district, carries Cross Bay Boulevard over Jamaica Bay, linking mainland Queens to Broad Channel.\nBernard Coleman Memorial Square, near the Howard Beach – JFK Airport station, is a small plaza featuring a memorial honoring soldiers from Howard Beach who died in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War.\nHamilton Beach\nHamilton Beach is bordered by the 102nd Street Creek to the north, the IND Rockaway Line tracks and JFK Airport to the east, Hawtree Creek to the west, and Jamaica Bay to the south. Before incorporation, Hamilton Beach was characterized by dirt roads, bungalow-style homes, and the absence of a sewer system. Often referred to as West Hamilton Beach, it is one of the few New York City communities with its own volunteer fire department. East Hamilton Beach, once located on the east side of the Long Island Rail Road tracks, was demolished in the 1940s to allow for the expansion of Idlewild Airport (now JFK Airport). The neighborhood has no connection to Hamilton Beach Brands.\nUntil June 27, 1955, Hamilton Beach had a station on the LIRR's Rockaway Beach Branch. The station was closed when much of the branch was sold to the New York City Transit Authority. The community consists of one main road, 104th Street, with ten dead-end blocks connected to it, surrounded mostly by water. There is a single vehicular entrance and two pedestrian access points: a boardwalk linking the Howard Beach-JFK Airport station at Coleman Square to 104th Street, and the Hawtree Basin pedestrian bridge, which connects Hamilton Beach to Old Howard Beach.\nHamilton Beach features a small park at its southern end, including a 200-foot baseball field, a handball court, a jungle gym, and a beach. Gateways Hamilton Beach Park, located south of 165th Avenue, serves as the final stop for the Q11 bus. Since the early 21st century, housing development in the area has increased.\nLindenwood\nLindenwood, a section of Howard Beach, was developed in the 1950s and 1960s on landfill property and is considered part of New Howard Beach. The neighborhood features six-story orange- and red-brick apartment buildings constructed in the early to mid-1960s, smaller red-brick \"garden apartments\" built in the 1950s (visible from the Belt Parkway), and two-family homes, some attached, built in the 1960s. High-rise apartment buildings are primarily co-ops (red brick) or condominiums (orange brick), including Heritage House East and West, among the first condominium apartments in New York State. Additional townhouses near the Brooklyn border have been constructed since the 1970s. Many former playgrounds around apartment buildings have since been converted into sitting areas, with restrictions such as no dogs allowed.\nAt the heart of Lindenwood is P.S. 232, now known as the Walter Ward School, named after a longtime local City Councilman. The Lindenwood Shopping Center features a supermarket and about 20 stores. A second supermarket, \"The Village,\" opened in the early 1970s but later housed a mall, flea market, bingo hall, private school, and ultimately became a walk-in medical center. Another small strip mall is located on Linden Boulevard, next to the Lindenwood Diner.\nHistorically, Lindenwood's population was predominantly Jewish, Italian, and Hispanic. When the Jewish population was larger, Temple Judea on 153rd Avenue and 80th Street served the community. The building was later converted into apartments after the synagogue merged with the Howard Beach Jewish Center in Rockwood Park. The neighborhood once had two pool clubs, later replaced by walk-up apartments and townhouses, including one near P.S. 232 that was redeveloped in 1980. A tennis bubble at 153rd Avenue and 79th Street was built around 1980.\nOld Howard Beach\nOld Howard Beach is a section of Howard Beach that lies between Shellbank Basin and Hawtree Creek to the east of Cross Bay Boulevard. Coleman Square, Wetzel Triangle and Frank M. Charles Park are located in Old Howard Beach. The area is locally referred to as \"Old Howard Beach\" since it was the original place in which founder William Howard built his famous hotel, and later the area's first houses in the 1920s. The current housing in Old Howard Beach consists of several different types of houses. Those located near the former Howard Beach General Hospital (built in 1962) are mainly 1950s and 1960s detached two-family homes, while the areas near Coleman Square, Frank M. Charles Park, and Shellbank Basin contain primarily single-family homes. The Q11 bus serves the neighborhood.\nRamblersville\nRamblersville is a small neighborhood of about a dozen blocks between Hawtree Creek and JFK Airport. It is nearly surrounded by waterways leading into Jamaica Bay. The neighborhood is bordered by 160th Avenue to the north, Hawtree Creek to the west (across which lies Old Howard Beach), the IND Rockaway Line to the east (beyond which are Bergen Basin and JFK Airport), and 102nd Street Creek to the south. 102nd Street crosses the creek to connect to Hamilton Beach at Russell Street. The neighborhood spans approximately  on each side, and lacks the rectangular street grid of the surrounding neighborhoods.\nRamblersville is purportedly the oldest neighborhood in what later became Howard Beach and once considered itself independent of New York City when the city was unified. A 1905 Washington Post article described the neighborhood as having houses built on stilts, with a population of 1,000 in the summer and a dozen in the winter. In 1962, the city replaced the neighborhood’s private water mains; at that time, the population consisted of approximately 130 families.\nFishing was a significant industry in the neighborhood. In 2001, The New York Times compared Ramblersville to a fishing village, having pebbled streets and wooden bungalows built on pilings, surrounded by tall grass and marshy fields.\nNorth of Ramblersville is 159th Drive, also called Remsen Place, named after Jeromus Remsen, an American Revolutionary War officer. This area was historically known as \"Remsen's Landing.\" Before 1916, the entire area now known as Howard Beach was commonly referred to as Ramblersville, including Hamilton Beach to the south and Old Howard Beach to the west. The Howard Beach – JFK Airport station was originally the Ramblersville Station of the Long Island Rail Road.\nRamblersville is the smallest neighborhood in New York City in terms of real estate per square foot.\nRockwood Park\nRockwood Park primarily consists of single-family detached houses. Often referred to as part of \"New Howard\" by local residents, it is bounded by 78th and 92nd Streets (running north-south) and 156th and 165th Avenues (running east-west). Public transportation in the area is provided by the Q41 and Q21 bus routes. To the west of 78th Street, the neighborhood's westernmost boundary, lies Spring Creek Park, marking the border between Brooklyn and Queens.\nThe area remained undeveloped through the first half of the 1900s. After World War II, marshland west of Cross Bay Boulevard was filled in, leading to the construction of Cape Cod-style houses. In the 1960s and 1970s, high ranch-style houses were built. The area became associated with upscale living and was home to notable figures, including Gambino crime family boss John Gotti, who lived on 85th Street. Starting in the late 1980s and continuing through the 2000s, many original Cape Cod-style homes were replaced with McMansions.\nFolk singer Woody Guthrie also lived in the neighborhood, at 159-13 85th Street, after moving from Coney Island.\nDemographics\nBased on data from the 2010 United States census, the population of Howard Beach was 26,148, a change of -1,973 (-7.5%) from the 28,121 counted in 2000.
