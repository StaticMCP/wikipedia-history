One of these rules states that if the Dangôro, or inmate King, becomes too ill to govern, he must take his life. The ailing Dangôro Blackbeard is pressured to commit suicide by his subordinate Lass, who seeks to become Dangôro after Blackbeard. Hoping to postpone his death by appeasing the prisoners, Blackbeard says he will name a new Roman, a griot instructed to tell stories for the population during the upcoming red moon. A new prisoner, a thief and member of the \"Microbe\" gang, arrives at MACA and is assigned to Blackbeard’s cell block. Blackbeard speaks with the new arrival and chooses him as Roman.\nOnce the red moon rises, the prisoners gather around Roman to hear, and occasionally act out portions of, his story. Initially hesitant, Roman tells the story of the death of Zama King, the leader of the Microbes. During a meal break, Roman is warned in secret that he must keep the story going until morning, or he will be killed. When Roman resumes his story, he tells a highly embellished tale of Zama King’s early life: After the death of his mother, Zama is raised by his father Soni, a blind beggar. Soni becomes the advisor of a local queen after convincing her that he has mystical powers. The story is interrupted by the murder of Koby, one of Blackbeard’s confidants. After a period of mourning, Blackbeard and Half-Mad, his second-in-command, speak to each other privately. Half-Mad asks Blackbeard to name him as the next Dangôro. After Half-Mad leaves, Roman begs Blackbeard to call off the storytelling tradition. However, Blackbeard refuses and says that he wants to spill blood one last time. Afterwards, Blackbeard accepts his fate and drowns himself in a water tank.\nRoman continues his story: After failing to lead the queen to victory in a war against her brother, Soni disguises himself and flees with Zama, settling in the Lawless Quarter slum of Abidjan. Following the post-election crisis and the arrest of Laurent Gbagbo, Zama becomes a close ally of the new government and founds the Microbes. Later, Zama is surrounded by an angry mob and is killed via necklacing, thus ending the story.\nRealizing that morning has not yet come, Roman claims that the story has a twist ending, and attempts to explain that Zama was a foundling. Half-Mad accuses Roman of stalling and prepares to kill him. However, Roman is saved when a fight breaks out between Lass, Half-Mad, and their supporters. In order to prevent the brawl from escalating, prison Warden Nivaquine fires into the crowd with a handgun, killing several prisoners, including Half-Mad. In the prison courtyard, Roman watches the sun rise.\nRelease\nNeon acquired the US rights to the film in September 2020.\nNight of the Kings was released in the US in theaters and in virtual cinemas on February 26, 2021, and on video on demand on March 5, 2021.
