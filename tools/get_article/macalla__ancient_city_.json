      "text": "# Macalla (ancient city)\n\nMacalla or Makalla () was an ancient city of Bruttium.\nThe author of the Aristotelian Corpus writes that Philoctetes lived there after he returned from Troy, and adds that the hero had deposited there in the temple of Apollo Halius the bow and arrows of Hercules, which had, however, been removed by the Crotoniats to the temple of Apollo in their own city. We learn from this author that Macalla was in the territory of Crotone, Magna Graecia, about 120 stadia from that city; but its position cannot be determined. The author also add that the Philoctetes is honoured among the Sybarites.\nAccording to Lycophron, at Macalla was the sepulchre of Philoctetes, to whom the inhabitants paid divine honours.\nIt was doubtless an Oenotrian town: at a later period all trace of it disappears.\nReferences"
