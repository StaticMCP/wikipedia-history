Its financial provisions were gradually regularised, it came to rely on dedicated warships only, and it developed a professional officer corps with a defined career structure, superseding an earlier mix of sailors and socially prominent former soldiers.\nHistorical overview\nAfter 1603 the English and Scottish fleets were organized together under James I but the efficiency of the Navy declined gradually, while corruption grew until brought under control in an inquiry of 1618. James concluded a peace with Spain and privateering was outlawed. Between 1618 and 1628, a Navy Commission temporarily replaced the Navy Board, due to misappropriation of public funds by board commissioners. After the inquiry was over the office of the Lord High Admiral (held by the Duke of Buckingham) was restored. However, he was murdered and King Charles I put the office into commission. This led to the creation of a new Board of Admiralty which in its early formation was just the Privy Council in another reincarnation. This in turn also led to the removal of the Admiralty Court from direct control of the Lord High Admiral's. His office was temporarily restored again in 1638, but then put in commission once more after 1679 the Lords Commissioners of Admiralty became the permanent officers responsible for administration of the Navy.\nOrganization in the seventeenth century\nAdmiralty of England\nFile:Tudor Ensign 1485-1603.svg|Tudor Ensign 1600-1603\nFile:Stuart Royal Navy Squadron Ensign of 1620.svg|Stuart Navy Squadron Ensign 1603-1620\nFile:English White Ensign 1620.svg|English Navy White Ensign 1620-1707\nCommanders-in-chief\n* Queen Elizabeth I\n* King James I & VI\n* King Charles I\n* Lord Protectors, Oliver Cromwell, Richard Cromwell\n* King Charles II\n* King James II & VII\n* King William III and Queen Mary II\n* Queen Anne\nNaval Lords of England\n*Office of the Lord High Admiral of England\n**Vice-Admiral of England and Deputy Lord High Admiral\n***Rear-Admiral of England\nCivil administration of the Navy\nNotes: the Secretary of State England for the period 1628 to 1679 was responsible for all policy decisions and direction on behalf of the government due to a continued state of war.\nBoard of Admiralty\n''The Board of Admiralty and the Lord's Commissioners executing the office of the Lord High Admiral\n* The Board of Admiralty\nFirst Commissioner and First Lord of the Admiralty\n*First Lord of the Admiralty, and member of the English government\n**Clerk of the Admiralty\n***Messenger of the Admiralty, appointed, 1687\n***Housekeeper of the Admiralty appointed (1687 &ndash; 1799)\n***Doorkeeper of the Admiralty, 1687\n***Gardner of the Admiralty appointed (1687 &ndash; 1799)\nCivil Commissioner\n*Chief Secretary to the Admiralty (1628 &ndash; 1652)\n*First Secretary to the Admiralty (1652 &ndash; 1871)\nNaval Commissioner\n*Naval Lord from (1682 &ndash; 1689)\n*Senior Naval Lord from (1689–1771)\nLords Commissioners of the Admiralty\n91 commissioners served during the 17th century.\nNotes: Between 1693 and 1830 the commission always included either 1 or 2 additional naval lords except from 1757 until 1782 when it was just the Senior Naval Lord.

A junior naval lord is introduced in 1868 until 1903 then is re-styled Fifth Sea Lord from 1917.\nNaval operations\nSenior leadership\nNaval High Command\n*Office of the Lord High Admiral of England (1600 &ndash; 1628)\n**Office of the Vice-Admiral of England\n***Office of the Rear-Admiral of England\n*Office of the First Lord of the Admiralty (1628 &ndash; 1964)\n**Office of the Naval Lord of the Admiralty*\n***Admiralty Secretariat, (1690-1932)\n***Greenwich Hospital\n***Nautical Almanac Office\n***Register office\n***Royal Observatory\n***Sixpenny Office\nFleet commands\nFlag officers of the fleet\n*Admiral of the Fleet Red\n**Vice-Admiral of the Red\n*** Rear-Admiral of the Red\n*Admiral of the White\n**Vice-Admiral of the White\n***Rear-Admiral of the White\n*Admiral of the Blue\n**Vice-Admiral of the Blue\n***Rear-Admiral of the Blue\nFlag officers commanding fleets and stations\nFlag officer commanding individual fleets and stations\nHome commands\n* Admiral Commanding, the Narrow Seas, (1412-1688)\n* Admiral/Vice-Admiral Commanding, in the Channel.

At that time there were three such Courts, appointed by Admirals responsible for waters to the north, south and west of England. In 1483 these local courts were amalgamated into a single High Court of Admiralty, administered by the Lord High Admiral of England. The Deputy Lord High Admiral presided over the High Court.\nAdmiralty courts\n*Lord High Admiral of England\n**Vice Admiral of England and Deputy Lord High Admiral\n***Advocate General to the office of the Lord High Admiral\nLegal advisors to the admiralty courts\n*Office of the Lord High Admiral\n**Counsel to the Admiralty,(1673 &ndash; 1824), attached originally to the Navy Board\n**Solicitor for the Affairs of the Admiralty and Navy, appointed (1692 &ndash; 1799)\nHigh court of the admiralty\n*Office of the High Court of the Admiralty Court (1450 &ndash; 1875)\n**Judge of the High Court of Admiralty\n**Judge Advocate of the Fleet\n***Deputy Judge Advocate of the Fleet\n**Proctor of the High Court of Admiralty\n**Marshall of the High Court of Admiralty\n**Droits of the High Court of Admiralty\nVice admiralty courts\nThe Vice-Admiral of the Coast  was responsible for the defence of one of the twenty maritime counties of England, the North and South of Wales. As a Vice-Admiral, the post holder was the chief of naval administration for his district. His responsibilities included deciding the outcome of the Prize court (captured by pirate ships), dealing with salvage claims for wrecks, and acting as a judge in relation to maritime issues.\n* Vice-Admiral Cheshire (1559 &ndash; 1835)\n* Vice-Admiral Cornwall (1559 &ndash; 1917)\n* Vice-Admiral Cumberland (1559 &ndash; 1835)\n* Vice-Admiral Devon (1559 &ndash; 1835)\n* Vice-Admiral Dorset (1559 &ndash; 1835)\n* Vice-Admiral Durham (1559 &ndash; 1835)\n* Vice-Admiral Essex (1559 &ndash; 1835)\n* Vice-Admiral Gloucestershire (1559 &ndash; 1835)\n* Vice-Admiral Hampshire (1558 &ndash; 1846)\n* Vice-Admiral Kent (1558 &ndash; 1846)\n* Vice-Admiral Lancashire (1569 &ndash; 1861)\n* Vice-Admiral Lincolnshire (1565 &ndash; 1862)\n* Vice-Admiral Norfolk (1554 &ndash; 1846)\n* Vice-Admiral Northumberland (1559 &ndash; 1847)\n* Vice-Admiral Somerset (1561 &ndash; 1865)\n* Vice-Admiral Suffolk (1554 &ndash; 1947)\n* Vice-Admiral Sussex (1559 &ndash; 1860)\n* Vice-Admiral Westmorland (1559 &ndash; 1802)\n* Vice-Admiral Yorkshire (1559 &ndash; 1860)\nVice Admiralty jurisdictions and prizes abroad\nBy appointing Vice-Admirals in the colonies, and by constituting courts as Vice-Admiralty Courts, the terminology recognized the existence and superiority of the \"mother\" court in the United Kingdom.  Thus, the \"vice\" tag denoted that whilst it was a separate court, it was not equal to the \"mother\" court.  In the case of the courts abroad, a right of appeal lay back to the British Admiralty Court, which further reinforced this superiority.  In all respects, the court was an Imperial court rather than a local Colonial court.\nNorth America\n*Vice-Admiral Carolina\n*Vice-Admiral Maryland\n*Vice-Admiral Massachusetts\n*Vice-Admiral New Hampshire\n*Vice-Admiral New York, including Connecticut\n*Vice-Admiral Pennsylvania, including Delaware\n*Vice-Admiral Virginia\nWest Indies\n*Vice-Admiral Barbados\n*Vice-Admiral Jamaica\nSee also\n*Admiralty in the 16th century\n*Admiralty in the 18th century\nReferences\nSources\n*The Statutes of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, 3 George IV. 1822''.
