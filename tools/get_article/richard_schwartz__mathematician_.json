Geometric group theory is a relatively new area of mathematics beginning around the late 1980s which explores finitely generated groups, and seeks connections between their algebraic properties and the geometric spaces on which these groups act. He has worked on what mathematicians refer to as billiards, which are dynamical systems based on a convex shape in a plane. He has explored geometric iterations involving polygons, and he has been credited for developing the mathematical concept known as the pentagram map. In addition, he is author of a mathematics picture book for young children. In 2018 he is a professor of mathematics at Brown University.\nCareer\nSchwartz was born in Los Angeles on August 11, 1966. He attended John F. Kennedy High School in Los Angeles from 1981 to 1984, then earned a B. S. in mathematics from U.C.L.A. in 1987, and then a Ph. D. in mathematics from Princeton University in 1991 under the supervision of William Thurston. He taught at the University of Maryland. He is currently the Chancellor's Professor of Mathematics at Brown University. He lives with his wife and two daughters in Barrington, Rhode Island.\nSchwartz is credited by other mathematicians for introducing the concept of the pentagram map.\nAccording to Schwartz's conception, a convex polygon would be inscribed with diagonal lines inside it, by drawing a line from one point to the next point—that is, by skipping over the immediate point on the polygon. The intersection points of the diagonals would form an inner polygon, and the process could be repeated. Schwartz observed these geometric patterns, partly by experimenting with computers.\nHe has collaborated with mathematicians Valentin Ovsienko\nand Sergei Tabachnikov\nto show that the pentagram map is \"completely integrable.\"\nIn his spare time he draws comic books, writes computer programs, listens to music and exercises. He admired the late Russian mathematician Vladimir Arnold and dedicated a paper to him. He played an April Fool's joke on fellow mathematics professors at Brown University by sending an email suggesting that students could be admitted randomly, along with references to bogus studies which purportedly suggested that there were benefits to having a certain population of the student body selected at random; the story was reported in the Brown Daily Herald. Colleagues such as mathematician Jeffrey Brock describe Schwartz as having a \"very wry sense of humor.\"\nIn 2003, Schwartz was teaching one of his young daughters about number basics and developed a poster of the first 100 numbers using colorful monsters. This project gelled into a mathematics book for young children published in 2010, entitled You Can Count on Monsters, which became a bestseller. Each monster has a graphic which gives a mini-lesson about its properties, such as being a prime number or a lesson about factoring; for example, the graphic monster for the number five was a five-sided star or pentagram.  A year after publication, it was featured prominently on National Public Radio in January 2011 and became a bestseller for a few days on the online bookstore Amazon as well as earning international acclaim.\nThe Los Angeles Times suggested that the book helped to \"take the scariness out of arithmetic.\"\nMathematician Keith Devlin, on NPR, agreed, saying that Schwartz \"very skillfully and subtly embeds mathematical ideas into the drawings.\"\nPublications\nSelected contributions\n*The quasi-isometry classification of rank one lattices: Any quasi-isometry of a hyperbolic lattice is equivalent to a commensurator.\n*A proof of the 1989 Goldman–Parker conjecture: This is a complete description of the moduli space of the complex hyperbolic ideal triangle groups.\n*A proof that a triangle has a periodic billiard path provided all its angles are less than 100 degrees\n*A solution of the 1960 Moser–Neumann problem: There exists an outer billiards system with an unbounded orbit.\n*A solution of the 5-electron case of J. J. Thomson's 1904 problem: The triangular bipyramid is the configuration of 5 electrons on the sphere that minimizes the Coulomb potential.\n*The introduction of the pentagram map and a later proof (with Sergei Tabachnikov and Valentin Ovsienko) of its complete integrability.\nCorresponding articles\n*R.
