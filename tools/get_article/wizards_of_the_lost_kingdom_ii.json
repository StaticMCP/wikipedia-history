Griffith and starring David Carradine, Mel Welles and Lana Clarkson. It was Griffith's last feature film credit and is a sequel to the Argentine-American cult film Wizards of the Lost Kingdom (1985).\nPlot\nThe aging and incompetent wizard Caedmon is tasked by Grand-Wizard Vanir with training the young farmhand Tyor in the ways of magic, as he is the Chosen One, destined to free the three kingdoms from the three evil sorcerers that rule them with the power of three magical objects.\nTo do so, Tyor must pass a test in each kingdom. In the first kingdom, Baldor, he has to free Prince Erman to create an uprising and defeat the evil sorcerer Loki, who is holding three maidens hostage. Loki tries to defeat Caedmon and Tyor with the Amulet of Light, his source of power, but is disarmed by the latter and turned to stone with his own weapon.\nWith the help of Princess Amathea, a female warrior, they liberate her kingdom of Venir from the evil sorcerer Donar. As his second test, Tyor is tasked by Vanir to face Donar alone and obtain his source of power, the magical Sword of Justice. In the castle, he is almost seduced by the magic of Freya, Donar's mistress, but in the end he overcomes her spell and obtains the sword. At dawn, Amathea leads an attack on Donar's colliseum and liberates her kingdom, but Donar escapes to Zord, the third kingdom ruled by Zarz.\nOn their way there, they reencounter the Dark One, a legendary warrior, and are able to enlist his help in liberating the kingdom. The Dark One kills the Protector, a monster guarding the evil sorcerer Zarz's castle, but  Tyor, Caedmon, and Idun, the Dark One's wife, are taken prisoner. The Dark One takes the Sword of Justice and aids the townsfolk in their uprising, alongside Erman and Amathea. Zarz takes the amulet from Tyor and tries to seduce him to the dark side with his magical chalice, Tyor's final test, but fails. Caedmon attacks the two sorcerers but is overpowered. Just as they are about to kill him, Tyor unleashes his magic and kills Donar. Zarz faces Tyor, now armed with the Sword of Justice that the Dark One returned to him. Tyor hurls the sword at Zarz with magically enhanced strength and impales him.\nVanir appears and tasks the Dark One with naming the new ruler of the now united kingdoms, who chooses Erman and Amathea as king and queen. Tyor, now in possession of sword, chalice and amulet, is named the new Grand-Wizard by Vanir and tasked with training Caedmon and further honing his craft through training and travel. The Dark One returns to his inn.\nCast\n*Mel Welles\tas Caedmon\n*Robert Jayne as Tyor (as Bobby Jacoby)\n*David Carradine as The Dark One\n*Susan Lee Hoffman as Idun\n*Blake Bahner as Erman\n*Lana Clarkson as Amathea\n*Henry Brandon as Zarz\n*Wayne Grace as Vanir\n*Edward Blackoff as Loki\n*Sid Haig as Donar\n*Diana Barton as Freyja\nProduction\nThe film includes stock footage of characters, scenes as well as plot devices and objects from the first film, Deathstalker and its sequel, Barbarian Queen, Amazons and The Warrior and the Sorceress, all of which were also a co-production between Argentina and United States and starred several of the co-stars, such as Clarkson and Carradine.
