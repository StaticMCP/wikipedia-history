Local elections were held across Great Britain, with elections to 35 English local authorities and all councils in Scotland and Wales.\nNewly created combined authority mayors were directly elected in six areas of England: Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, Greater Manchester, the Liverpool City Region, Tees Valley, the West Midlands, and the West of England. In addition, Doncaster and North Tyneside re-elected local authority mayors. Local by-elections for 107 council seats also took place on 4 May.\nThe Conservative Party led under Prime Minister Theresa May enjoyed the best local election performance in a decade, making significant gains at the expense of the Labour Party. The UK Independence Party lost every seat they were defending, but gained just one seat at the expense of the Labour Party. The Liberal Democrats lost 41 seats, despite their vote share increasing. The Conservatives won four out of six metro-mayoral areas, including in the traditionally Labour-voting Tees Valley and West Midlands.\nThe local elections were followed by a general election on 8 June.\nEligibility to vote\nAll registered electors (British, Irish, Commonwealth and European Union citizens) who were aged 18 or over (or aged 16 or over in Scotland) on polling day were entitled to vote in the local elections. A person who had two homes (such as a university student having a term-time address and living at home during holidays) could register to vote at both addresses as long as they were not in the same electoral area, and could vote in the local elections for the two different local councils.\nIndividuals had to be registered to vote by midnight twelve working days before polling day (13 April 2017 in England and Wales; 17 April 2017 in Scotland). Anyone qualifying as an anonymous elector had until midnight on 25 April 2017 to register.\nSeats held prior to the election\nIn total, 4,851 council seats were up for election in 88 councils; additionally six new mayors were directly elected. Approximately 10,000 people were candidates for election. All 32 councils in Scotland (1,227 seats) and all 22 councils in Wales (1,254 seats) were up for election; an additional 34 councils (2,370 seats) in England were up for election. Of the 35 English councils up for election, 27 were county councils, seven were unitary authorities, and one was the Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council.\nAccording to a BBC News estimate, taking into account boundary changes, the major political parties were effectively defending the following notional results in council seats on election day:\n* Labour – 1,535 seats\n* Conservatives – 1,336 seats\n* Lib Dems – 484 seats\n* SNP – 438 seats\n* Plaid Cymru – 170 seats\n* UKIP – 146 seats\n* Green Party – 34 seats\nThere were also 687 independent councillors and 4 Mebyon Kernow councillors. The remaining 217 seats were held by residents' associations and minor parties. A by-election for the parliamentary constituency of Manchester Gorton (caused by the death of Gerald Kaufman, the sitting MP) was due to be held on the same day as the local election, but the by-election was cancelled after the general election was called for the following month.\nResults\nOverall results - Great Britain\n{| id=\"results\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:140px;\"| Party\n! colspan=\"3\" | Councillors\n! colspan=\"3\" | Councils\n|-\n!  style=\"width:50px;\"| Won\n!  style=\"width:50px;\"|After\n!  style=\"width:50px;\"|+/-\n!  style=\"width:50px;\"|Won\n!  style=\"width:50px;\"|After\n!  style=\"width:50px;\"|+/-\n|-\n|\n|1,899\n|9,239\n|563\n|28\n|200\n|11\n|-\n|\n|1,148\n|6,467\n|382\n|9\n|106\n|7\n|-\n|\n|441\n|1,812\n|42\n|0\n|8\n|\n|-\n|\n|431\n|431\n|7\n|0\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|\n|1\n|346\n|145\n|0\n|0\n|\n|-\n|\n|208\n|208\n|38\n|1\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|\n|39\n|187\n|5\n|0\n|0\n|\n|-\n|\n|702\n|1,525\n|33\n|6\n|8\n|1\n|-\n|\n| colspan=3\n|44\n|81\n|5\n|-\n|}\nAs elections were not held throughout the country, the&nbsp;BBC&nbsp;calculated a Projected National Vote Share (PNV), which aims to assess what the council results indicate the UK-wide vote would be \"if the results were repeated at a general election\". The BBC's preliminary Projected National Vote Share was 38% for the&nbsp;Conservatives, 27% for&nbsp;Labour, 18% for the&nbsp;Liberal Democrats&nbsp;and 5% for&nbsp;the UK Independence Party, with others on around 12%.\nThis is the highest vote share for the Conservatives in local elections since 2008, when they faced Labour a decade into government and suffering from the financial crisis. The Liberal Democrats have performed better than at any election since 2010, whilst Labour has not performed so badly since 2010. The turnout was 35.3%.\nUKIP lost 145 of their 146 seats. Prominent former UKIP members talked of the party being finished and that it should disband.\nResults by nation\nEngland\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Party\n! scope=\"col\" | Votes\n! scope=\"col\" | Vote %\n! scope=\"col\" | +/-\n! scope=\"col\" | Councils\n! scope=\"col\" | +/-\n! scope=\"col\" | Seats\n! scope=\"col\" | +/-\n|-\n|\n| 3,036,709\n| 46.5%\n| 12.2%\n|27\n| 10\n|1,439\n| 319\n|-\n|\n| 1,299,846\n| 19.9%\n| 1.6%\n|2\n| 1\n| 418\n| 142\n|-\n|\n| 1,164,779\n| 17.8%\n| 4.2%\n|0\n|\n|312\n| 28\n|-\n|\n| 302,368\n| 4.6%\n| 15.6%\n|0\n|\n|1\n|143\n|-\n|\n| 284,735\n| 4.4%\n| 0.8%\n|0\n|\n|20\n|\n|-\n|\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Others\n| 438,985\n| 6.7%\n| 0.2%\n|0\n|\n|199\n|6\n|-\n|\n|n/a\n|n/a\n|n/a\n| 5\n|9\n|n/a\n| n/a\n|-\n|\n|Total\n|6,545,055\n|100\n|\n|34\n|\n|2,389\n|\n|}\nNote that unlike in Scotland and Wales, where all local authorities were up for election, the England results are for only 34 councils out of 353, and should not be taken as reflective of the whole of England.\nWales\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=2 | Party\n! style=\"width:55px;\" | Votes\n! style=\"width:55px;\" | %\n! style=\"width:45px;\" | +/-\n! style=\"width:55px;\" | Councils\n! style=\"width:45px;\" | +/-\n! style=\"width:55px;\" | Seats\n! style=\"width:35px;\" | +/-\n|-\n|\n| 294,989\n|30.4%\n|4.5%\n|7\n|3\n|468\n|112\n|-\n|\n| 218,817\n|22.5%\n|1.3%\n|3\n|1\n|309\n|2\n|-\n|\n|182,520\n|18.8%\n|6.3%\n|1\n|1\n|184\n|79\n|-\n|\n|160,519\n|16.5%\n|0.5%\n|1\n|1\n|208\n|38\n|-\n|\n| 66,022\n|6.8%\n|1.2%\n|0\n|\n|63\n|10\n|-\n|\n|  12,441\n|1.3%\n|0.2%\n|0\n|\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|\n|11,006\n|1.1%\n|0.3%\n|0\n|\n|0\n|2\n|-\n| style=\"color:inherit;background:\" |\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Others\n| 24,594\n|2.5%\n|0.3%\n|0\n|\n|21\n|7\n|-\n|\n| n/a\n| n/a\n| n/a\n|10\n|1\n| n/a\n| n/a\n|-\n|\n|Total\n|970,908\n|100\n|\n|22\n|\n|1,254\n|\n|}\nFor comparative purposes, the table above shows changes since 2012 across 21 local authorities and the 2013 result from Anglesey Council.\nScotland\nFollowing boundary changes:\n}}\n|-style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9;text-align:center font-size:95%;\";\"\n!colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" width=\"175\"|Party\n!colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"2\" width=\"175\"| First-preference votes\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Councils\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 30px;\"| +/-\n! colspan=\"2\" | 2012 seats\n! colspan=\"2\" | 2017 seats\n! colspan=\"2\" | Seat change\n|-\n!

In 2015, several Independent councillors created their own group within the council called Conwy First. This group later on went to support the council instead of the remaining five independent councillors, so that the coalition was then made up of Plaid Cymru, Welsh Labour and Conwy First.\n: ‡ The Welsh Liberal Democrats later lost their only seat on the Council, thereby leaving the coalition.\n: †† At the original election Plaid Cymru won exactly half the seats; they later took control of the council by winning a by-election.\nSee also\n* 2017 City of London Corporation election\nNotes\nReferences"
