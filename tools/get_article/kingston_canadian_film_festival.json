It showcases exclusively Canadian cinema and artists. Founded in 2001, the festival has grown into the largest standalone showcase of Canadian cinema, presenting a range of programming including feature films, short films, documentaries, and in-person events such as panels, Q&As, and occasional live performances.\nThough the festival takes place in late winter, the organization also offers year-round programming.\nHistory\nThe Kingston Canadian Film Festival (KCFF) was founded in 2001 by Alex Jansen, who was then studying Film at Queen’s University. The inaugural event was a three-day showcase held at The Screening Room, a repertory cinema in downtown Kingston that Jansen managed at the time. The festival was launched with support from Moving Pictures: Canadian Films on Tour, which was succeeded by backing from the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) Group in 2003.\nBy its second year (2002), the festival added a second, larger venue on the Queen's University campus. The festival saw substantial growth in programming that year, from a shorts competition, to another day of the festival; making it the largest stand-alone showcase of feature films from across Canada. Subsequent years saw the introduction of new programming and outreach efforts. The Local Filmmaking Initiative (LFI) was launched in 2003 with support from the City of Kingston’s Healthy Community Fund. In 2006, a French Community Outreach program was added, followed by high school outreach programming in 2008 in partnership with Reel Canada.\nLeadership also shifted in 2006 when Alison Migneault, who had just become co-director the previous year, became Festival Director. Jansen continued to serve in a consulting role. The following year, the Festival launched its first-ever retrospective series, around the 50th anniversary of film-making by the acclaimed Canadian director Allan King.\nThe Festival held a local short film competition (10 Years, 10 Minutes), for a local team to produce a short film to be premiered at the 10th anniversary festival, awarding the winner $5,000 cash and professional mentorship. In 2011, they celebrated the 10th anniversary, premiered the winner, and hosted a special screening of the silent film Carry On Sergeant!.\nThe 2020 festival was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A fully digital format was adopted in 2021, shifted to hybrid in 2022, and returned fully to in-person programming in 2023, incorporating the newly renovated Broom Factory as a venue. This period also saw KCFF developing its year-round activities. New initiatives included the Slaight Music Video Program (launched in 2019), the 18mm Program (2023), and the KCFF Doc Factory (2025).\nIn 2024, KCFF awarded $25,000 to Blaine Watters (winner of the 25 Years 25 Minutes Pitch Competition) to create a short film for the 25th anniversary Fest in 2025.\nProgramming\nKCFF primarily showcases Canadian films, including narrative features, documentaries, and short films. The festival features both English- and French-language works, and regularly includes Indigenous cinema.\nKey Festival Programs and Events\nFeature Film Screenings\nThe festival typically screens 30–40 Canadian feature films annually, including works by first-time filmmakers, established directors, and award-winning productions.\nShort Film Programs\nKCFF screens approximately 50–75 short films each year, presented in four themed programs.\nSpecial Events\nThe festival features Q&As, podcasts, panels, and workshops with filmmakers and industry professionals, along with industry events like receptions, awards, and networking for both new and established creatives. It also offers special presentations, including live music, comedy, and stage performances by Canadian artists, and its own podcast called Rewind Fast Forward, with host Thom Ernst.\nYear-Round Activities\nIn addition to the annual festival, KCFF presents year-round programming such as community screenings, workshops, and special events. These are often produced in collaboration with local organizations, schools, and Queen’s University. KCFF worked in partnership with RAW Design and KPP Concerts to open The Broom Factory, a venue that hosts many of the festival’s educational and filmmaking initiatives and acts as the main office of the organization.\nOngoing programs include the 18MM Program, a mentorship and production initiative for youth filmmakers; the KCFF Doc Factory, which provides training for emerging documentary creators; and the Slaight Music Video Program, a collaborative project that pairs local filmmakers with musicians to produce original music videos.\nVenues\nKCFF takes place at various venues throughout downtown Kingston, including:\n* Isabel Bader Centre for the Performing Arts\n* The Screening Room\n* Grand Theatre\n* Broom Factory\nAwards\nKCFF presents a number of awards annually, including both audience-selected and juried categories:\n* People’s Choice Award – Voted on by audiences,  All feature films are automatically in competition.\n* Doug Falconer Award of Excellence – Awarded annually to a Kingston-based film professional for outstanding contributions to film.
