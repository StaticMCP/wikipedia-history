It is headquartered at Wyattville Road, Loughlinstown, County Dublin, D18 KP65, Ireland.\nGovernance\nThe foundation is overseen by a Management Board, executive director, and deputy director. The Executive Board meets once a year to set budgets and policy, and to decide on one-year and four-year work programmes. The current director, Ivailo Kalfin, was appointed in June 2021. The deputy director is Maria Jepsen.\nThe foundation budget (21,8M euros in 2021) comes from the general European Commission budget.\nReferences"
