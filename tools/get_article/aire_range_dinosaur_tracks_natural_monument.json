When discovered, it had the single longest known sauropod trackway in the world at  long.\nThe natural monument consists of approximately twenty different trackways on a broad limestone stratum exposure, part of the Calcários Micríticos da Serra de Aire formation, and 175 millions of years in age.\nUnusually well preserved, many footprints display claw and digit impressions, as seen in the gallery photos below, which allows for some level of determination of the paw anatomy of the animals.\nOrigin\nThe formation dates back to the middle Jurassic Period (between the Bajocian and Bathonian ages). At that time, Europe was still connected to the North American continent and, between Iberia and Newfoundland, penetrated a shallow sea of warm and clear waters, conducive to the formation of coral reefs.\nThe area in itself was a coastal plain, full of periodically flooded areas, consequence of aquifers, one to two meters thick. Geological interactions millions of years later gave rise to what is now the Serra de Aire mountain range, in which the slab sits slightly dipping at an approximate altitude of .\nHistory\nThe area was originally a quarry, the Pedreira do Galinha.\nOn July 2nd, 1994, Ricardo Matos da Silva, João Pedro Falcão and João Carvalho, discovered the footprints that would turn the quarry into the current monument.\nVisiting Tips\nThe site consists of a near-horizontal limestone bed, atop a sizeable anticline, which gently and progressively dips towards the northwest. The best times of the day to visit the site, and observe the shaded contrast between the footprints and the surrounding rock layer, are therefore as early as possible in the morning or late in the afternoon, when the sun is at a low incidence angle to the stratum.\nGallery\nFile:Pegadas de Dinossáurios da Serra de Aire Natural Monument Panorama.jpg|The trackway site as seen in 2012, when it was still known as Galinha Quarry.\nFile:Multiple dinosaur trackways.jpg|A closer look at some dinosaur trackways.\nFile:Img 8737 Pegadas de Dinossáurios da Serra de Aire.jpg|One of the several long sauropod trackways.\nFile:Sauropod footprints.jpg|Sauropod footprints along a major trackway.\nFile:Sauropod manus footprint.jpg|A sauropod manus print showing a claw and digit impressions.\nFile:Fossil dinosaur footstep in a Portuguese quarry2.jpg|A sauropod pes print showing digit impressions.\nFile:Pegada de dinossáurio na Serra de Aire.JPG|A dinosaur footprint.\nFile:Monumento Natural das Pegadas de Dinossáurios das Serras de Aires e Candeeiros - Portugal (182348849).jpg|The garden around the quarry site presents some living fossils of the Jurassic Period.\nReferences"
