The ZMA's mission, which seeks to recognize and honor great work in Zambia's musical field, focuses on the development of ideas that promote progression and originality. Consequently, the objective of ZMAs is to create a reliable and prestigious awards platform for all Zambian musicians as well as producers because they are part and parcel of this industry.\nHistory\nOrigin\nThe National Arts Council of Zambia and the stakeholders in the Zambian music industry created the awards in the year 2013. They were meant to foster talent, excellence, and creativity in the music industry of Zambia. These awards are run by the National Arts Council of Zambia with sponsorship from various judges and stakeholders across the industry. The National Arts Council of Zambia organizes the awards, which boasts a team of industry professionals, judges, and sponsors. As performers, presenters, and winners, the awards ceremony has had many prominent Zambian musicians, producers, and music industry experts take part in the ceremony.\nNomination and criteria\nThe nominees of the awards are drawn from the fan interactions that are reflected on the radio airplay in countrywide and the votes are tracked by the committee of the awards with partnership to various radio stations. The awards are then determined by the polls of the public and the fans via established channels that include websites, SMS, and social media. The awards are then verified by the auditing firms for transparency.\nObjectives\nThe ZMAs goals involve giving awards for excellent work, supporting Zambian music nationally and internationally, inspiring creative minds, giving space for networking as well as collaborations and finally contributing to growth as well as development in Zambia’s music sector.\nArtist of the year\nThe Artist of the Year category is one of the highest and most prestigious of the awards given at the event given to the artist(s). The artist winning most of the awards is Yo Maps.\nCurrent award categories\nMusic\n* Song of the Year\n* Best Hip-Hop Act\n* Artist of the Year (Female)\n* Artist of the Year (Male)\n* Music Video of the Year\n* Best Gospel Artist\n* Best New Artist (Female)\n* Best New Artist (Male)\n* Best Dancehall Act\n* Album of the Year\n* Producer of the Year\n* Best Duo/Group\n* Lifetime Achievement\nMedia\n* Best Radio DJ/Personality\n* Best Entertainment writer\n* Best TV personality\n* Media Legend\nFashion\n* Most Fashionable Celebrity\n* Model of the Year\n* Living Legend\n* Fashion Icon\n* Designer of the Year\nHost Cities\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

A mixture of these two events aimed at reaching out to more people while at the same time recognizing and promoting Zambian music, arts as well as culture so as it can be appreciated internationally. In this way we sought to reach out to a bigger audience while recognizing and appreciating Zambian music, arts and culture on the international scene. The awards served as a platform for acknowledging great talents in various genres such as hip-hop or Kalindula, thereby creating an opportunity for these individuals to come forward with their talent before massive crowds gathered in different places throughout our country where they were recognised as the best performers, producers or artists from Zambia. At the launch event, Permanent Secretary Stephen Mwansa emphasized the importance of collaboration and partnership in the music industry, highlighting the awards' role in bringing together the public and private sectors. He noted that the Mosi Lager Zambian Music Awards and the Mosi Day of Thunder embodied the Zambian experience, celebrating heritage and shaping the future.\nZambian Breweries Marketing Director Thomas Kamphuis stressed the significance of music in society, citing its ability to penetrate various aspects of life, including rest, entertainment, education, and worship. He emphasized the importance of championing local talent and celebrated the power of music to bring people together. The awards were a joint effort between Zambian Breweries, the National Arts Council of Zambia, the Zambia Adjudicators Panel, and the Zambia Association of Musicians.
