In 2013, it claimed to be the second largest narrow gauge network in the world. The network consists of the following lines:\n*the North Coast Line (NCL), extending  from Brisbane to Rockhampton, Townsville and Cairns\n*four east–west lines (and associated branch lines), including:\n**the Western line from Brisbane to Toowoomba and Charleville\n**the Central Western line from Rockhampton to Longreach and Winton\n**the Mt Isa line from Townsville to Mount Isa\n**the Tablelands line from Cairns to Forsayth\n*four export coal networks, including:\n**Moura to Gladstone\n**Blackwater to Gladstone\n**Goonyella to Hay Point\n** Newlands to Abbot Point\n*the original narrow-gauge Southern line that provided a rail connection to Sydney, extending from Toowoomba to the New South Wales border at Wallangarra, plus the South Western line west from Warwick to Thallon;\n*two lines extending south of Brisbane, a  narrow gauge passenger line from Brisbane to the Gold Coast, and a  line to the New South Wales border connecting to the line to Sydney\n*the isolated Normanton to Croydon line, now operated as a tourist service as The Gulflander\n*the isolated   private freight line at Weipa hauling bauxite from a mine to the export terminal\n*over 3,000&nbsp;km of  gauge sugar cane lines servicing 19 sugar mills (see Tramways section below).\nPassenger services include:\n*Long distance trains from:\n**Brisbane to Cairns\n**Townsville to Mount Isa\n**Brisbane to Longreach\n**Brisbane to Charleville\n**Brisbane to Sydney via XPT\n*the Translink network providing services:\n**north to Caboolture, Ferny Grove, Gympie, and Kippa-Ring\n**east to Brisbane Airport, Cleveland, Doomben, and Shorncliffe\n**south to Beenleigh and Varsity Lakes\n**west to Ipswich, Rosewood, and Springfield.\nThe Translink network consists of approximately 300&nbsp;km and 151 stations.\nHistory\nConstruction\nConstruction of the Queensland rail network began in 1864 with the first section of the Main Line railway from Ipswich  to Grandchester being built. This was the first narrow-gauge main line constructed in the world and, in 2013, was claimed to be the second largest narrow-gauge railway network in the world.\nNetwork extent\nAt its maximum extent in 1932, the system totalled ~10,500&nbsp;km of routes open for traffic.\nIn 1925, QR employed ~18,000 people, 713 locomotives, 930 passenger carriages, ~16,000 goods wagons, hauled ~five million tons of goods and ~30 million passengers, and made a return on capital of 3.2% before depreciation.\nElectrification\nThree significant electrification programs have been undertaken in Queensland which include the Brisbane suburban network, the Blackwater and Goonyella coal networks, and the Caboolture to Gladstone section of the North Coast line.\nPublic float\nOn 2 June 2009, the Queensland Government announced the 'Renewing Queensland Plan', with Queensland Rail's commercial activities to be separated from the Government's core passenger service responsibilities. The commercial activities were formed into a new company called QR National Limited. The new structure was announced by the Queensland Government on 2 December 2009, and took place from 1 July 2010.\nInfrastructure\nTrack gauge\nThe nascent Queensland Railways was persuaded that the way to reduce the cost of railway construction was to use a narrower gauge than the standard gauge of . A prototype existed in Norway, but Queensland became the first rail operator in the world to adopt narrow gauge for a main line. The proposed  gauge railway involved a  axle load and very sharp curves of  radius on the long climb to Toowoomba at about  above sea level. The maximum gradient was 1 in 50 (2%) uncompensated, which combined with a  radius curve gives an equivalent grade of 1 in 41 (about 2.5%). Although the proposed railway could only manage a top speed of , that was claimed to be sufficient for a hundred years.\nOne of the main advantages of a narrow gauge railway is that the earthworks required do not have to be as extensive as on railways of larger gauge. It was estimated that the cost of this standard of railway would be 25% of the cost of a standard gauge line built to the minimum standard considered possible with that gauge at the time. This was a vital consideration since the colony of Queensland had a non-indigenous population of about 30,000 at the time. Standard gauge branch lines were later constructed in NSW with  radius curves and had the same low maximum speed.\nThe choice of the non-standard  gauge, approved very narrowly by parliament, was and still is controversial. Thus the die was cast for a large narrow-gauge system, which was copied by three other Australian states as well as a number of other countries. Queensland's decision to use narrow gauge was influential on New Zealand's decision to adopt narrow gauge as its uniform gauge in 1870.\nA hundred and fifty years later, Queensland is still sparsely populated (5.5 million in 2024), but many trains hauling coal are some of the longest and heaviest in the world, with Aurizon currently trialling coal trains of 25,000 tonne gross load that are ~4.5&nbsp;km long.\nRack railway\nQR had one rack railway, with grades as steep as 1 in 16.5 (6%), which was on the branch to Mount Morgan. It was bypassed by a conventional line in 1951 with grades of 1 in 50 (2%). The bypass closed in 1987. The rack system was the Abt rack system, the same type used by the Mount Lyell Railway in Tasmania.\nOperators\nat the International Airport on its way to the Domestic Terminal]]\nHistorically, the government-owned Queensland Rail has been the main rail operator in Queensland. The exception has been the standard-gauge link from New South Wales into Brisbane. When opened in 1930, it was operationally a part of the New South Wales system and run by that government-owned railway, under agreement with Queensland which owned the line. From 1994, National Rail took over the operation of virtually all standard-gauge freight services to and from Brisbane, as part of a reorganisation of interstate freight in Australia.\nIn 2002, QR entered the standard-gauge market through subsidiary Interail, by 2004, it was running freight services from Brisbane through to Melbourne. Today, standard-gauge freight services are operated by Pacific National after its acquisition of National Rail, and Aurizon (formerly a Queensland Rail subsidiary, QR National).\nOn the narrow gauge, Queensland Rail operates all passenger services. In 2005, the first non-QR narrow gauge commercial rail operation started in Queensland, with Pacific National commencing operation of container services between Brisbane and Cairns, followed in 2009 by their entry into the export coal market. Queensland Rail's subsidiary Australian Railroad Group have also entered the Queensland narrow-gauge freight market, operating trains between Townsville and Mount Isa in its own right. Standard-gauge passenger services are provided by the New South Wales Government's NSW TrainLink using its XPT.\nAirtrain\nThe Airport railway line opened to passengers in May 2001. Under a BOOT scheme – build, own, operate and transfer – the Queensland Government licensed Airtrain Citylink to build the rail line, to own and operate it, and hand the entire infrastructure over to the Queensland Government after 35 years when the company will then cease to exist. Airtrain Citylink contracted Transfield Services to build, operate and maintain the line and finally Airtrain Citylink contracted Queensland Rail to provide rolling stock for the rail line.\nAurizon\nIn 2010, the Queensland government privatised the narrow gauge freight haulage and all standard gauge components of Queensland National. In 2012, the organisation renamed itself Aurizon.\nPacific National\nIn March 2005, Pacific National Queensland became the first non-Queensland Rail narrow gauge commercial rail operation in Queensland, with the commencement of container services between Brisbane and Cairns. They now operate intermodal services to various destinations along the coast of Queensland. In 2018 they became responsible for sugar haulage in Central and North Queensland.\nWatco Australia\nOn 16 August 2019, Watco Australia announced that the first two of eight WRA Class locomotives units were being delivered to Australia. The company have stated that they would begin operations in the fourth quarter of 2019. WRA001 and 002 arrived at the Port of Brisbane on the vessel Tarago on 9 October 2019 and were transferred to Warwick behind QR locomotive 1724.\nBHP Mitsubishi Alliance\nBHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA) is a 50/50 partnership between the two named companies, operating 9 coal mines in the Bowen Basin. BMA Rail was authorised to operate on the Goonyella coal network from 1 January 2014, and purchased 13 Siemens E40 AG-V1 electric locomotives, designated as the BMACC class, numbered BMACC001-BMACC013. It has the potential to operate its own trains if contract haulage rates from either Aurizon or Pacific National are unacceptable.\nTramways\nnear Mackay]]\nExcept where noted, this section relates to sugar cane lines in Queensland built to narrower than  gauge, and in this section the term ‘narrow gauge’ means a gauge less than . Non sugar cane tramways covered by their own entries are:\n*Aramac Tramway\n*Ballara Tramway\n*Beaudesert Shire Tramway\n*Belmont Tramway\n*Buderim Tramway\n*Cooloola Tramway\n*Innisfail Tramway\n*Laheys Tramway\n*Mapleton Tramway\n*Mill Point Settlement Site\n*Stannary Hills Tramways\n*Munro Tramway\nSugar cane tramways were usually developed in conjunction with sugar mills as the major transport system for conveying harvested sugar cane for processing. As this is a seasonal traffic, minimising cost was a significant consideration, and the adoption of  gauge enabled lines to be laid with minimal earthworks, sharp curves, and sometimes temporarily in cane fields so cut cane can be loaded directly onto wagons.\nHistory\n, ca. 1939]]\nThe first recorded use of a locomotive hauled tramway for sugar cane transport in Queensland was at a plantation at Morayfield (now an outer suburb of Brisbane) in 1866 using  gauge. The plantation was not a success, however another tramway built at Maryborough in the same year was successful.\nA  gauge tramway was established at the Pioneer Mill near Ayr in 1875, and in 1881 a  tramway network had been established to service CSR Homebush and Victoria mills. The Herbert mill had an  network by 1882, and further tram networks were established as the sugar industry expanded, all  gauge with the exception of the Pioneer Mill system.\nIn 1911 the Queensland Railway Department built a tramway from Chinchilla to Wongongera (now Barakula) to transport railway sleepers made from logs taken from the state forest at Barakula and milled at the Barakula sawmill (approx ). The route of the Barakula tramway was based on an earlier plan to construct a railway line from Chinchilla to Taroom that was subsequently abandoned in favour of a railway line from Miles to Taroom. The tramway operated until 1970.\nAt the end of World War I surplus equipment that had been used to rail supplies to the trenches was used to expand the sugar cane networks.\nOriginally cane was harvested by hand, and the ‘standard’ 4 wheel wagon was loaded by stacking the ~2 m lengths of cane between upright stakes.\nIn the 1950s mechanical harvesting was introduced, and cane ‘bins’ were required to hold the ~200&nbsp;mm lengths (‘billets’) of cane produced by that harvesting process. Most cane bins are 4 wheel with a 4–6 tonne capacity, but some mills utilise bogie bins with a capacity of ~10 tonnes.\nDiesel mechanical and diesel hydraulic locomotives replaced steam locomotives in the 1950s and 1960s. Cane must be processed within 12 hours of harvest for maximum yield, so the transportation timing dictated the size of a cane tramway network when mills were first established. When diesel locomotives were introduced, their increased utilisation rates enabled the size of a potential network to grow, resulting in the rationalisation of both the tramways and a reduction in the number of mills. Today some of the ‘main lines’ of tramways are of a standard equivalent to a  gauge main line, with (in some cases) concrete sleepers, ballast and heavy rail allowing relatively high speed transport of the cane from further distances whilst still meeting the 12-hour ‘delivery from harvest’ timeframe.\nQueensland Railways sold a closed branchline in 1964 to the Gin Gin Cooperative Mill in Gin Gin which converted it to a  sugar tramway.\nWith the development of higher standard road networks, some mills have converted to road transport for some or (in a few cases) all cane delivery.\nNambour, about 100&nbsp;km north of Brisbane had a sugar tram network until 2003, when the mill closed due to plantations being sold for urban development reducing the district crop harvest to an unviable size.\nThe Rocky Point Mill situated about 50&nbsp;km south of Brisbane had a  tramway which opened in 1924 and closed following flood damage in 1951. Road transport has been used for that mill since then.\nCurrent situation\n, 2015]]\nIn 2014 there were 19 sugar cane systems (18 of which use  gauge) with a combined trackage of  hauling approximately 36M tonnes of sugar cane each season. The average distance cane is hauled is 35&nbsp;km, with the longest line being 119&nbsp;km. Average speed is 40&nbsp;km/h (due to the wagons not having brakes), and the maximum load is 2000 tonnes, being 1&nbsp;km long.\nIt is understood the Pioneer Mill is considering converting its network to  gauge to enable it to more easily procure rolling stock and to facilitate greater efficiency of operations with two neighbouring mills, which currently share 25&nbsp;km of dual gauge track.\nContemporary sugar cane tramways are quite advanced technically, utilising relatively heavy rails cascaded second hand from other operators, remote-controlled brake vans, concrete sleepers (in places), ballast and tamping machines. The 19 separate tramways cooperate in research and development.\nIn the 2020s, railway enthusiast volunteers are making efforts to preserve Queensland's sugar cane tramway history. However, they are few in number, have limited resources, and many of the tramway relics have already disappeared. When a sugar mill closes, the owner or operator is often obliged to remove everything, and another difficulty is that tramway lines often run through privately owned farms.\nIn 2024 the so-called Inland Railway from Melbourne to Brisbane is under construction which will provide a dual gauge replacement for the sharp curved and steeply graded narrow gauge line from Helidon to Toowoomba.\nRolling stock\nPassenger\nCity network fleet\nin original colour scheme at Rocklea, 1987 with the dual gauge line in the foreground]]\n, 1999]]\nAll of the Queensland Rail City Network rolling stock is electric and air conditioned.\n* Suburban Multiple Unit (SMU)\n** 200 Series (SMU200) – 12 in service (12 built)\n** 220 Series (SMU220) – 30 in service (30 built)\n** 260 Series (SMU260) – 36 in service (36 built)\n* Interurban Multiple Unit (IMU)\n** 100 Series (IMU100) – 10 in service (10 built)\n** 120 Series (IMU120) – 4 in service (4 built)\n** 160 Series (IMU160) – 28 in service (28 built)\n* New Generation Rollingstock (NGR)\n** 700 Series – 75 in service\n* Queensland Train Manufacturing Program (QTMP)\n** XXX Series – 65 to be manufactured by Downer/Hyundai Rotem\nTraveltrain fleet\nOne of the two Diesel Tilt Trains in [[Queensland]]\nTraveltrain services mainly cater to a tourist market.\n*Locomotive hauled trains\n**The Electric Tilt Train operating from Brisbane to Rockhampton\n**The Spirit of Queensland, operating from Brisbane to Cairns\n**The Spirit of the Outback operating from Brisbane to Longreach\n**The Inlander operating from Townsville to Mount Isa\n**The Westlander operating from Brisbane to Charleville\n**The Kuranda Scenic Railway operating from Cairns to Kuranda\n*Rail motor trains\n**The Gulflander, a rail motor operating on the Normanton to Croydon line\n**The Savannahlander, a rail motor operating from Cairns to Forsayth\nHistory\nQueensland's first premier passenger service was the Sydney Mail, introduced in 1888 when the New South Wales line opened to Wallangarra. From 1923 it included a Parlour Car. The Parlour Car was transferred to the Townsville Mail in 1930 following the opening of the  line from Sydney to Brisbane.\nThe Sunshine Express was introduced between Brisbane and Cairns, being the first completely roller-bearing equipped train in Australia.\nThe Inlander was the first train in Australia with air-conditioned sleeping cars.\nThe Spirit of the Outback replaced the Capricornian and the Midlander.\nThe Spirit of Queensland replaced the Sunlander, a locomotive hauled train that was withdrawn in 2014.\nSee also\n*Rail transport in South East Queensland\n*Rail transport in Australia\n*List of tramways in Queensland\n*Railway accidents in Queensland\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.qr.com.au/ Queensland Rail]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091030090557/http://www.history.qr.com.au/ History of Queensland Rail]"
