The Warriors, led by seventh-year head coach Joe Gallo, played their home games at Hammel Court in North Andover, Massachusetts as members of the Northeast Conference (NEC).\nThe season marked Merrimack's final year of a four-year transition period from Division II to Division I. As a result, the Warriors were not eligible to play in the NCAA tournament. However, a rule change made by the Northeast Conference allowed the Warriors to compete in  the NEC tournament.\nThey finished the season 15–16, 12–4 in NEC play, to claim first place. In the NEC tournament, Merrimack defeated LIU, Saint Francis (PA) and Fairleigh Dickinson to win the championship. Due to their ineligibility to compete in the NCAA tournament, runners-up Fairleigh Dickinson were awarded the NEC conference auto-bid, ending the Warriors' season with a final record of 18–16.\nThey ended the season with the nations longest winning streak with 11 wins in a row.\nPrevious season\nThe Warriors finished the 2021–22 season 14–16, 10–8 in NEC play, to finish in fourth place. The Warriors, in their third year of a transition to Division I, were ineligible for the NEC tournament and the NCAA tournament. They received an invitation to play in The Basketball Classic, but their opponent, UMBC, withdrew from the tournament due to health concerns, unofficially ending their season.\nRoster\n)\n|asst_coach=\n* Micky Burtnyk ()\n* Phil Gaetano ()\n|roster_url=https://merrimackathletics.com/sports/mens-basketball/roster/2022-23\n|accessdate=November 15, 2022\n}}\nSchedule and results\n|-\n!colspan=12 style=| Regular season\n|-\n!colspan=9 style=| NEC tournament\nSources:\nReferences"
