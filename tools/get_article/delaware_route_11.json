It is signed north–south and runs from Maryland Route&nbsp;302 (MD&nbsp;302) at the Maryland border near Templeville, Maryland, northeast to DE&nbsp;300 near Kenton. The road, known as Arthursville Road for its entire length, passes through farmland in western Kent County and through the town of Hartly, where it intersects DE&nbsp;44. The route was built as a state highway in the 1920s and 1930s and received the DE&nbsp;11 designation by 1936.\nRoute description\nDE&nbsp;11 begins at the Maryland border in western Kent County, where the road continues west into that state as MD&nbsp;302 toward the town of Templeville. From the state line, DE&nbsp;11 heads northeast on two-lane, undivided Arthursville Road through a mix of woods and farms with occasional residences. The road enters the town of Hartly, where it passes several homes along with some commercial establishments. In the center of town, the route crosses DE&nbsp;44 and heads north before it curves northeast out of Hartly. DE&nbsp;11 continues into rural areas with some residences, making another turn north. The road runs northeast and crosses  Jordan Branch and Pinks Branch before it comes to an end at DE&nbsp;300 to the southwest of the town of Kenton.\nDE&nbsp;11 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 2,543&nbsp;vehicles at the north end of Hartly to a low of 1,503&nbsp;vehicles at the south end of Hartly.\nHistory\nBy 1920 what is now DE&nbsp;11 existed as an unimproved county road. The portion of the route north of Hartly was built as a paved state highway in 1927. The road south of Hartly was taken over by the state and paved by 1931. DE&nbsp;11 was assigned to its current alignment by 1936. The route has not changed since its inception.\nMajor intersections\n|notes=Maryland state line; southern terminus\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=Northern terminus\n}}\nSee also\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.aaroads.com/guides/de-011/ DE&nbsp;11 at AARoads.com]"
