They were monarchs of the Mughal Empire in the Indian subcontinent, mainly corresponding to the modern day countries of India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh. They ruled many parts of India from 1526 and by 1707, they ruled most of the subcontinent. Afterwards, they declined rapidly, but nominally ruled territories until the Indian Rebellion of 1857.\nThe Mughal dynasty was founded by Babur (), a Timurid prince from the Fergana Valley (modern-day Uzbekistan). He was a direct descendant of both Timur and Genghis Khan.\nThe Mughal emperors had significant Indian and Persian ancestry through marriage alliances as emperors were born to Persian princesses.\nDuring the reign of 6th Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, the empire, as the world's largest economy and manufacturing power, worth over 25% of global GDP, controlled nearly all of the Indian subcontinent, extending from Dhaka in the east to Kabul in the west and from Kashmir in the north to the Kaveri River in the south.\nIts population at the time is estimated to be around 158,400,000 (a quarter of the world's total population), over a territory of more than 4&nbsp;million square kilometres (1.5&nbsp;million square miles). Mughal power rapidly dwindled during the 18th century and the last emperor, Bahadur Shah II, was deposed in 1857, with the establishment of the British Raj in India.\nBackground\n;Titular emperors\nOver the course of the empire, there were several claimants to the Mughal throne who ascended the throne or claimed to do so but were actually never recognized.\nHere are the claimants to the Mughal throne historians recognise as titular Mughal emperors.\n# Shahryar Mirza (1627–1628)\n# Dawar Baksh (1627–1628)\n# Jahangir II (1719–1720)\nList of Mughal emperors\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! width=\"10\"  | No.\n! width=\"100\" | Portrait\n! width=\"150\" | Titular Name\n! width=\"250\" | Birth Name\n! width=\"150\" | Birth\n! width=\"200\" | Reign\n! width=\"150\" | Death\n|-\n| 1\n|\n| Babur\n| Zahir ud-Din Muhammad\n| 14 February 1483Andijan\n| 21 April 1526 – 26 December 1530)}}\n| 26 December 1530 (aged 47)Agra\n|-\n| 2\n|\n| Humayun\n| Nasir ud-Din Muhammad\n| 6 March 1508Kabul\n| 26 December 1530 – 17 May 1540)}}22 February 1555 – 27 January 1556)}}\n| 27 January 1556 (aged 47)Delhi\n|-\n| 3\n|\n| Akbar I\n| Jalal ud-Din Muhammad\n| 15 October 1542Umerkot\n| 11 February 1556 – 27 October 1605)}}\n| 27 October 1605 (aged 63)Agra\n|-\n| 4\n|\n| Jahangir\n| Nur ud-Din Muhammad\n| 31 August 1569Agra\n| 3 November 1605 – 28 October 1627)}}\n| 28 October 1627 (aged 58)Bhimber\n|-\n| 5\n|\n| Shah Jahan I\n| Shihab ud-Din Muhammad\n| 5 January 1592Lahore\n| 19 January 1628 – 31 July 1658)}}\n| 22 January 1666 (aged 74)Agra\n|-\n| 6\n|\n| AurangzebAlamgir I\n| Muhi al-Din Muhammad\n| 3 November 1618Dahod, Gujarat\n| 31 July 1658 – 3 March 1707)}}\n| 3 March 1707 (aged 88)Ahmednagar\n|-\n| 7\n|\n| Azam Shah\n| Qutb ud-Din Muhammad\n| 28 June 1653Burhanpur\n| 14 March – 20 June 1707)}}\n| 20 June 1707 (aged 53)Agra\n|-\n| 8\n|\n| Bahadur Shah IShah Alam I\n| Mirza Muhammad Mu'azzam\n| 14 October 1643Burhanpur\n| 19 June 1707 – 27 February 1712)}}\n| 27 February 1712 (aged 68)Lahore\n|-bgcolor=#66BB55\n| 9\n|\n| Jahandar Shah\n| Muiz ud-Din Muhammad\n| 9 May 1661Deccan\n| 27 February 1712 – 11 February 1713)}}\n| 12 February 1713 (aged 51)Delhi\n|-bgcolor=#DAF2CE\n| 10\n|\n| Farrukhsiyar\n| Muin al-Din Muhammad\n| 20 August 1685Aurangabad\n| 11 January 1713 – 28 February 1719)}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|19 April 1719 (aged 33)Delhi\n|-bgcolor=#DAF2CE\n| 11\n|\n| Rafi ud-Darajat\n| Shams al-Din Muhammad\n| 1 December 1699\n| 28 February 1719 – 6 June 1719)}}\n| 6 June 1719 (aged 19)Agra\n|- bgcolor=#DAF2CE\n| 12\n|\n| Shah Jahan II\n| Rafi al-Din Muhammad\n| 5 January 1696\n| 6 June 1719 – 17 September 1719)}}\n| 18 September 1719 (aged 23)Agra\n|- bgcolor=#DAF2CE\n| 13\n|\n| Muhammad Shah\n| Nasir al-Din Muhammad\n| 7 August 1702Ghazni\n| 27 September 1719 – 26 April 1748)\n| 26 April 1748 (aged 45)Delhi\n|-\n| 14\n|\n| Ahmad Shah Bahadur\n| Mujahid al-Din Muhammad\n| 23 December 1725Delhi\n| 29 April 1748 – 2 June 1754)}}\n| 1 January 1775 (aged 49)Delhi\n|-\n| 15\n|\n| Alamgir II\n| Aziz al-Din Muhammad\n| 6 June 1699Burhanpur\n| 3 June 1754 – 29 November 1759)}}\n| 29 November 1759 (aged 60)Delhi\n|-\n| 16\n|\n| Shah Jahan III\n| Muhi al-Millat\n| 1711\n| 10 December 1759 – 10 October 1760)}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1772 (aged 60–61)\n|-\n| 17\n|\n| Shah Alam II\n| Jalal al-Din Muhammad Ali Gauhar\n| 25 June 1728Delhi\n| 10 October 1760 – 31 July 1788)}}\n| 19 November 1806 (aged 78)Delhi\n|-\n| 18\n|\n| Shah Jahan IV\n| Bidar Bakht Mahmud Shah Bahadur Shah Jahan IV\n| 1749Delhi\n| 31 July 1788 – 11 October 1788)}}\n| 1790 (aged 40–41)Delhi\n|- bgcolor=\"#F5DEB3\"\n| 17*\n|\n| Shah Alam II\n| Jalal al-Din Muhammad Ali Gauhar\n| 25 June 1728Delhi\n| 16 October 1788 – 19 November 1806)}}\n| 19 November 1806 (aged 78)Delhi\n|- bgcolor=\"#F2D4CE\"\n| 19\n|\n| Akbar Shah II\n| Muin al-Din Muhammad\n| 22 April 1760Mukundpur\n| 19 November 1806 – 28 September 1837)}}\n| 28 September 1837 (aged 77)Delhi\n|-\n| 20\n|\n| Bahadur Shah II Zafar\n| Abu Zafar Siraj al-Din Muhammad\n| 24 October 1775Delhi\n| 28 September 1837 – 21 September 1857)}}\n| 7 November 1862 (aged 87)Rangoon\n|}\nFamily tree of Mughal emperors\nSee also\n* Timurid family tree\n* Mughal-Mongol genealogy\n* List of Mughal empresses\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* Keay, John, India, a History, 2000, HarperCollins,\n* .\n*  – [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/intoc.html India]  [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/pktoc.html Pakistan]"
