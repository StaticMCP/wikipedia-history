He then went to Northern Ireland to play for Ards before finding first team football at non-League club Yeovil Town.\nIn the summer of 2001 Patmore moved to Rushden & Diamonds, scoring on his debut for Rushden against York City.\nPatmore also played for the England non-League representative team on a number of occasions before ending his career at Margate in 2003.\nManagerial career\nPatmore was an instant success with Management gaining two promotions in three seasons with Devon & Exeter Football League side Morchard Bishop. Looking for a return to Somerset Patmore applied unsuccessfully for the vacant managerial job at Taunton Town. However he was successful with his application for the managerial position at Wellington in June 2009. In what was only Wellington's second season in the Premier Division he guided them to a tenth-place finish. On 9 May 2010, Patmore resigned as Wellington manager, citing distance to travel as the main reason behind his resignation. In June 2010 he was appointed as the new manager of South West Peninsula League side Witheridge, but left the club in November by mutual consent after issues with the chairman, and the club mid-table.\nHe later managed Crediton United but left the club after leading the club to their highest placed league finish in 21 years of 4th, due to \"club lacking the ambition to move forward\". He subsequently took charge of Tiverton Town's reserve team, but quit at the end of the 2016–17 season.\nSeason by season\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Division\n!Club\n!Games\n!Goals\n!Strike rate\n|-\n|1991–1992\n| Spartan League\n|Northwood\n|16\n|16\n|1.00\n|-\n|1992–1993\n| Division Two\n|Cambridge United\n|1\n|0\n|0.00\n|-\n|1992–1993\n| Southern League\n|Bashley\n|??\n|12\n|0.00\n|-\n|1992–1993\n| Division Two\n|Millwall\n|1\n|0\n|0.00\n|-\n|1992–1993\n| Division One\n|Cobh Ramblers\n|8\n|3\n|0.00\n|-\n|1993–1994\n| Division Three\n|Northampton Town\n|21\n|2\n|0.09\n|-\n|1994–1995\n| Premiership\n|Dundalk\n|9\n|2\n|0.22\n|-\n|1994–1995\n| Premiership\n|Ards\n|20\n|2\n|0.10\n|-\n|1995–1996\n| Isthmian Prem\n|Yeovil Town\n|38\n|23\n|0.60\n|-\n|1996–1997\n| Conference\n|Yeovil Town\n|38\n|19\n|0.50\n|-\n|1997–1998\n| Conference\n|Yeovil Town\n|37\n|16\n|0.43\n|-\n|1998–1999\n| Conference\n|Yeovil Town\n|38\n|20\n|0.52\n|-\n|1999–2000\n| Conference\n|Yeovil Town\n|38\n|13\n|0.34\n|-\n|2000–2001\n| Conference\n|Yeovil Town\n|36\n|18\n|0.50\n|-\n|2001–2002\n| Division Three\n|Rushden & Diamonds\n|4\n|1\n|0.25\n|-\n|2001–2002\n| Conference\n|Woking\n|26\n|11\n|0.42\n|-\n|2002–2003\n| Conference\n|Woking\n|37\n|14\n|0.37\n|-\n|2003–2004\n| Conference\n|Margate\n|6\n|1\n|0.16\n|-\n|2004–2005\n| Isthmian Prem\n|Northwood\n|1\n|1\n|1.00\n|-\n|2006–2007\n| Devon 4\n| Morchard Bishop\n|0\n|0\n|0.00\n|-\n|2007–2008\n| Devon 3\n| Morchard Bishop\n|0\n|0\n|0.00\n|-\n|2008–2009\n| Devon 2\n| Morchard Bishop\n|0\n|0\n|0.00\n|-\n|Total\n|\n|\n|375\n|163\n|0.43\n|}\nHonours\nManagerial\nMorchard Bishop\n*Devon & Exeter Senior Division 3 League winners 2006–07\n*Devon & Exeter Senior Division 4 League runners up 2007–08 (Champions Beacon Knights)\nCrediton Utd\n*South West Peninsula Football League 4th-place finish 2011–12\nTiverton Town Reserves\n*Devon & Exeter Senior Premier Runners up 2012–13\n*Devon & Exeter Senior Premier League Winners 2013–14\n*Throgmorton Champion's Cup Winners 2013–14\n*Southwest Peninsula League East Winners 2015–16\nReferences"
