Stewart would be assigned to a survey party in 1888, where he would be killed by Lushai headhunters under Chief Howsatta. This event would spark the Chin-Lushai Expedition.\nDeath\nTo settle with the borders of the Lushais and to reduce the cost of maintaining frontier outposts, the government of Bengal sought to demarcate and collect knowledge by surveying the frontier. The plan was to establish a winter reconnaissance to train officers as well as to collect information. In January 1888, two survey parties, one under the command of Lieutenant John Fraser Stewart with a party of ten sepoys and another under Lieutenant Baird of the Derbyshire regiment with a similar escort.\nThe plan was for one party to leave Rangamati and work along the Belisurri range. The second party would go up Khawthlangtupui to Demagiri, where both parties would meet on the Rang Khyong River. Stewart's party started from Rangmati on 16 January 1888 and worked towards Saichal. The escort for the survey party was small due to the lack of raids in over 15 years, which made the British believe that a large force to field was unnecessary. The frontier police were used more so as labour to build huts, clear jungles and guide coolies over combat roles. Stewart's party consisted of two corporals of the 1 battalion of the Leinster Regiment and ten men of the Chittagong Frontier police.\nAfter a few days, Stewart discovered the elephant assigned to carry the party's baggage could not travel further unless the road was improved. Hence, he left the elephant with three frontier policemen as he marched with the rest of the party up the Saichal range. On 2 February, Stewart sent two remaining men back, leaving him with a smaller party of 5 sepoys. A sentry was placed for the night, but after dawn, he was removed and not replaced. Early in the morning, most of the party was asleep, and Stewart was awake, partially dressed while having tea. The whole hillside was shrouded in white mist, which hangs near midday during the season. As a result, the Lushais successfully shot a volley along with shouting from the Lushais. The first shots broke the thigh of a sepoy and killed another. Due to panic and confusion, the two corporals who had been asleep were stabbed to death. A police havildar, a naick and one sepoy remained and managed to get their rifles to return their fire. Stewart also managed to get back into his hut and bring out a revolver and gun. However, the party was outnumbered by 200-300 Lushais armed with spears or muskets. Stewart retired up the hillside while firing but was shot at the edge of a ravine. His body fell down the ravine and was found a few days later tightly wedged in the bamboo in a way the Lushais could not free him. After a bounty of  to locate Stewart's body, a party of hillmen reported to location on 25 February 1888. However, he was found headless with his weapons looted off him. The rest of the party retreated towards the last supply camp, where the rest of the party had stayed behind. As a result of the attack, Lieutenant John Fraser Stewart was killed on 3 February 1888.\nNews of the massacre reached Mr. S. Walker, assistant superintendent of police at Demagiri, on 4 September 1890 at midnight. Within the hour, Walker assembled the frontier police and reached Baird's camp at 9 am on the Oiphum range. After recruiting the officers, Walker attempted to cut off the raiders but was too late. The lack of food among the force also constituted a need to return to Demagiri. Charles Stewart Murray, the deputy superintendent of police at the time, proceeded with an escort to Stewart's camp. The investigation revealed the bodies thoroughly looted, with heads, weapons, ammunition and accessories taken. Murray subsequently buried the deceased party members and Lieutenant Stewart.\nA punitive expedition was sanctioned; however, the season was not favourable. A plan for an expedition would be drawn up for the end of the year. In the meantime, 250 rifles of the 9th Bengal Infantry under Major Woodhouse was sent to reinforce the frontier. Frontier police occupied a line of outposts on the border. However, this would not be sufficient to prevent the Chengri Valley raid and the murder of Pakuma Rani. This would sanction the Chin-Lushai Expedition under Brigadier V.C. Tregear\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\nArchive"
