Their route took them along Mount Tkhab and the slopes of Mount Elbrus, where they engaged in battles against the Zhanievs, Kemirgoevs, and Besleneevs.\nIt is possible that the campaign extended to Kabarda. From the outset, this expedition was sanctioned by Sultan Suleiman I, who aimed not only to subdue the Circassians (Adyghe) but also to clear the way for Ottoman-Crimean forces to advance into Dagestan and the Caucasus. Several months after returning from the Circassian campaign, in the autumn of 1539, the Crimean Khan organized an attack on Russia.\nIn 1539, the Circassians attacked the Ottoman fortresses on the Taman Peninsula, as well as Anapa and Azov. In response, a large expedition of Ottomans and Crimean Tatars to Circassia followed, but this campaign did not yield results.\nIn 1542, after Kansavuk, could not supply enough slaves, the khan decided to attack again. Kansavuk's message with promises was rejected, and the Crimeans entered Circassia. In a night battle, attacked by the Circassians, the Tatars win and left with slaves.\nIn 1545, Sahib-Giray led two military expeditions to Circassia: one to its western regions and another to Kabarda.\nLike the 1539 campaign, these expeditions were conducted under the orders of the Sultan. The cause of the campaign was the refusal of the prince Kansuvek to pay tribute to the Sultan in slaves. The Crimean Khanate’s army included Ottoman artillery and Janissaries armed with firearms.\nThe Sanjak-bey of Kaffa ensured smooth transportation across the strait with 300 ships. Artillery played a decisive role: a 10,000-strong force of the Zhaneyevtsev was defeated and scattered. For over two months, the Crimeans ravaged the Circassian lands, and according to Remmal-Khodja, they took several thousand prisoners.\nAfter in 1546 and 1547, the Crimean Khan Sahib I Giray attacked Circassia. The Khan met with the leader of the Circassian tribe Zhaney, Kansavuk, who accepted to pay tribute. When leaving, on his way back collected, the khan collected slaves from villages.\nIn 1549, Circassians and Moscow Cossacks successfully forged the Ottoman Azov.\nReferences"
