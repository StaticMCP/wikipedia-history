They compete as members of the Ohio Valley Conference. SIUE plays its home games at Roy E. Lee Field at Simmons Baseball Complex, located in the northwest corner of the campus.\nHistory\nThe Cougars baseball program was started in 1967–68 by Roy Lee, who headed it for its first eleven years. In that time, his teams built a record of 237–144–3, going to 8 consecutive NCAA Division II playoffs and 3 Division II College World Series, with a runner-up finish in 1976.\nAfter Coach Lee's retirement, the program was led for 34 years by SIUE alumnus Gary Collins. Collins' teams won 1028 games (with 766 loses & 7 ties). While still in Division II, his teams made 14 NCAA appearances and went to the Division II College World Series 5 times. He led them into Division I and the Ohio Valley Conference, where the Cougars completed their first season in the OVC in 2012 with an overall record of 27–28 and a conference record of 13–14, which tied for fifth place in the ten-team league.\nIn 2012, Gary Collins moved from coaching to become SIUE's first Director of Development for Intercollegiate Athletics.\nWith Collins' job change, after thirteen seasons as Collins' assistant, SIUE alumnus Tony Stoecklin was named acting head coach for 2013 and continued as head coach from 2014.\nThe 2014 squad became the first to qualify for the OVC Baseball Tournament, earning the No. 4 seed in the six team field.\nStoecklin was reassigned within the athletic department in mid-April 2016, with assistant Danny Jackson named as interim coach and a national search for a new coach to be launched after the season.\nOn June 24, 2016, Sean Lyons, the associate head coach at Bradley, was named the fourth head coach in Cougars' history.\nRecord by year\n|endyear=1995\n|}}\n| confrecord =\n}}\n|endyear=2008\n|}}\n|endyear=present\n|}}\n| confrecord =\n}}\n| confrecord=\n}}\n| confrecord =\n}}\n| confrecord =\n}}\n| conference  =\n| poll        =\n| polltype    =\n| polltype2   =\n| legend      = yes\n| cbb_c1      =\n| cbb_c2      =\n| cbb_c3      =\n}}\n¶ = season ended early by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNotable former players\nThrough the years, many Cougars have gone on to play professionally, and twenty-one have been named All-Americans for their play at SIUE.\n* Mike Allaria/Third Base 1972\n* Nick Baltz/Pitcher 1975\n* Tim Bateman/Pitcher 1990\n* Mark Bugger/Shortstop 2000 & Second Base 2001\n* Dan Cole/ First Base1972\n* Ryan Cox/ Pitcher 1997\n* Tim Degener/Catcher 1991\n* Pete Delkus/Pitcher 1985\n* Tony Duenas/First Base & Pitcher 1985\n* Doug Duncan/First Base 1994\n* Bret Giaudrone/Pitcher 2001\n* Kyle Jones/Pitcher 2006\n* Chris Kabbes/Outfield 1992\n* Chad Opel/Shortstop 2001\n* Dustin Quattrocchi/Pitcher 2012\n* P.J.
