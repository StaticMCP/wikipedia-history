Located in the Plaza Benavides in front of the UST Main Building, the monument consists of a bronze statue of Benavides rising on top of a granite pedestal. The present monument was unveiled in 1946.\nHistory\nThe Benavides statue first stood in the Plaza de Santo Tomas in front of the original campus in Intramuros.\nDesign\nFile:University of Santo Tomas UST Benavides.jpg|Benavides holding the Santo Evangelio.\nFile:University of Santo Tomas UST Tony Noel.jpg|The sculptor's name at the base of the statue.\nThe pedestal is flanked at the base by four seated lions.\nFile:University of Santo Tomas UST Benavides pontifical.jpg|Coat of arms of the Holy See\nFile:University of Santo Tomas UST Benavides Royal.jpg|Coat of arms similar to the coat of arms of Spain used in 1700-1868 and 1834-1930\nFile:University of Santo Tomas UST Benavides Philippines.jpg|Coat of arms of the Philippines\nFile:University of Santo Tomas UST Benavides Dominican.jpg|Cross of the Dominican Order\nThe old university seal is featured on each side of the pedestal.

In the 1980s, the Intramuros Administration redeveloped the area into a usable park.\nIn 2002, the UST administration in cooperation with the Intramuros Administration, National Historical Institute, and the university alumni renovated the park. Manuel Cueto of the UST College of Architecture designed the renovation. The renovation project began in March 2001. Only the fences were retained from the original design of the plaza, which were based on a 1936 Unitas.\nAs part of the preparations for the Quadricentennial Celebration, a fiberglass replica of the statue was erected in its original location. The statue was sculpted by Dr. Crispin Viocencion and was inaugurated on January 25, 2002.\nBeside the Benavides statue is an obelisk containing the names of all the framers of the Malolos Constitution. A plaque on the base of the obelisk mentions the 53 names of the Thomasians who became part of the 1899 Malolos Constitution. However, based on historical documents, 54 Thomasians, who were also members of the Malolos Congress, signed the 1899 Constitution.\nAn octagonal concrete marker was also added. Each side of the marker contains pictures of the original campus and the plaza.\nStatue in Spain\nA statue of Benavides was unveiled in his hometown in Carrión de los Condes, Spain, on July 1, 2006. The bronze statue was made by Carlos Diez Galán. An inscription in the base of the statue reads, Miguel de Benavides, Carrión de los Condes. Primavera, 2006. Galán. In a bronze plaque in the front of the pedestal reads, Fr. Miguel de Benavides, OP. 1552 - 1605. Santo Misionero Prov. Ntra Sra Del Rosario. Arzobispo y fundador de la Universidad de Santo Tomas de Manila.\nAs part of the UST Quadricentennial Celebration in 2011, a mass at the Iglesia de San Andres and a wreath-laying ceremony at the statue were held. It was followed by the inauguration of a library named after Miguel de Benavides in the same town.\nDepictions\nDepictions of the monument have been used by the university in various occasions.\n* Benavides Outstanding Achievement Award medal\n* Logo of the Simbahayan project of the UST Office of Community Development\n* 2019-2020 car sticker\n* UST Quadricentennial commemorative coins, stamps, and official first day cover in 2011\n* UST Graduate School 50th Anniversary stamp in 1998\nReferences"
