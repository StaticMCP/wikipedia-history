It functions as a pedagogical application of a critical discourse analysis (CDA), which is a research approach that regards language as a social practice. More specifically, critical language awareness is a consideration of how features of language such as words, grammar, and discourse choices reproduce, reinforce, or challenge certain ideologies and struggles for power and dominance.\nRegarding linguistic variation, linguist Norman Fairclough argued that it is insufficient to teach students to use \"appropriate\" language without considering why that language is preferred and who makes that decision (as well as the implications for speakers who do not use \"appropriate language\").\nCLA generally includes consideration of how a person may be marginalized by speaking a particular way, especially if that way of speaking serves as an index of their race, ethnicity, religion, social status, etc.\nBecause power is reproduced through language, CLA is \"a prerequisite for effective democratic citizenship, and should therefore be seen as an entitlement for citizens, especially children developing towards citizenship in the educational system\".\nFrameworks\nIn 2022, Shawna Shapiro published the book Cultivating Critical Language Awareness in the Writing Classroom. It included chapters describing four pathways teachers can use to implement critical language awareness in the classroom: sociolinguistics, critical academic literacies, media literacy and discourse analysis, and  \"communicating-across-difference\".\nOthers have argued for the implementation of critical language awareness in other fields such as business and professional communications.\nApplications\nCritical language awareness has been applied to educating students in South Africa how language was used to maintain and perpetuate the apartheid state.\nIt has also been applied to present small groups of children with tasks which encourage a focus on the similarities and differences between languages.\nSee also\n* Critical applied linguistics\n* Critical discourse analysis\n* Critical pedagogy\n* Political correctness\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://cla.middcreate.net/ CLA Collective], \"an online resource hub and gathering space for teachers committed to promoting Critical Language Awareness (CLA) in our writing, literacy, and language classrooms and curricula\"\n* [https://www.routledge.com/Cultivating-Critical-Language-Awareness-in-the-Writing-Classroom/Shapiro/p/book/9780367767402 Critical Language Awareness in the Writing Classroom] by Shawna Shapiro\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110718170041/http://puslit2.petra.ac.id/ejournal/index.php/ing/article/shop/16757/16738 Addressing Political “Confusion Syndrome” Discourses: A Critical Applied Linguistics Perspective], Petra Christian University\n* [https://garyefltaiwan.blogspot.com/2007/05/critical-language-awareness-cla-and-efl.html Critical Language Awareness (CLA) and EFL]"
