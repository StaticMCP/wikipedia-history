A paper qualifies as a student paper if all authors are full-time students at the date of the submission. The award decision is made by the Program Committee.\nThe award is named after Michael Machtey, who was a researcher in the theoretical computer science community in the 1970s. The counterpart of this award at the ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC) is the Danny Lewin Best Student Paper Award.\nPast recipients\nPast recipients of the Machtey award are tabulated below.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
