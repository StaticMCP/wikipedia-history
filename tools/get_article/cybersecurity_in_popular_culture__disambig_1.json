As the digital age continues to expand and the importance of protecting computer systems, networks, and digital information grows, the awareness and understanding of cybersecurity have increasingly become a part of mainstream culture. Popular culture often portraits the gloomy underworld of cybersecurity, where unconventional tactics are used to combat a diverse range of threats to individuals, businesses, and governments. The integration of dark and mysterious elements into cybersecurity stories helps create a sense of uncertainty, rule-breaking, and intriguing ambiguity. This captures the public's attention and highlights the high stakes involved in the ongoing struggle to protect our digital world. This article highlights the creative works and cultural phenomena that have brought cybersecurity issues to the forefront, reflecting society's evolving relationship with technology, privacy, and digital security.\nHistorical evolution of cybersecurity in popular culture\nThe portrayal of cybersecurity themes in popular culture has evolved along with the growth of Internet and computer technology. Early examples from the 1980s and 1990s, such as \"WarGames\" (1983), \"Neuromancer\" (1984), \"The Net\" (1995), \"Snow Crash\" (1992), and \"Hackers\" (1995), introduced the hacker archetype and explored virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and ethical implications of hacking, as well as the risks of identity theft and cyberstalking.\nIn the 2000s, with the Internet becoming more prevalent, popular culture addressed the consequences of an interconnected world, including surveillance, privacy, and cybercrime. Television shows like \"Person of Interest\" (2011-2016) and \"Mr. Robot\" (2015-2019) tackled mass surveillance and digital vigilantism.
