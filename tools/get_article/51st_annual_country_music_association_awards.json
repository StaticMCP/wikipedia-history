Among adults 18–49, the show received a 3.2 rating, up from the 2.9 rating of the previous year.\nThe ceremony was noted for its parody of political subject matter in awards shows, specifically in the opening monologue by Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood, who told jokes referencing both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Paisley also performed a parody song about Trump's tweeting habits to the tune of Underwood's hit \"Before He Cheats.\"\nUnderwood's performance during the in memoriam segment, in which she broke down crying, received acclaim, with many citing it as one of the best and most moving and emotional performances of the night. People.com referred to the performance as \"heartbreaking,\" before describing how Underwood took to the stage to honor country music legends (such as Don Williams, Glen Campbell, Troy Gentry, and Jo Walker-Meador) and the 58 victims of the Las Vegas shooting. In addition, ET called Underwood's performance \"beautiful\" and \"gorgeous,\" mentioning a statement made by Paisley at the opening of the show about coming together in the face of tragedy.\nGarth Brooks, who won the prestigious Entertainer of the Year award, was heavily criticized for lip-syncing during his performance. Of his decision, Brooks stated that \"we made a game-time call on whether to sing to a track or lip-sync and we decided to lip-sync it. My voice just isn't going anywhere, and we wanted to represent country music as best we can.\"\nReferences"
