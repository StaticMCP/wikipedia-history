The fleet currently consists of two historic steam locomotives, three historic diesel locomotives, seventeen modern diesel locomotives in historic or commemorative paint schemes and nearly four dozen passenger cars used on office car specials and excursion trains.\nSteam locomotives\n, the only steam locomotive to never be officially retired from a North American Class I railroad.]]\n, the world's largest operating steam locomotive.]]\nSince 1960, the Union Pacific has operated steam locomotives on a variety of excursions. These include:\n*UP 844: a 4-8-4 Northern type express passenger steam locomotive (class FEF-3), operated in excursion service since 1960. It was the last steam locomotive built for UP and has been in continuous service since its 1944 delivery. Many people know the engine as the No. 8444, since an extra '4' was added to its number in 1962 to distinguish it from a diesel numbered in the 800 series. It regained its original number in June 1989, after the diesel was retired and donated to the Nevada Southern Railroad Museum in Boulder City, Nevada. A mechanical failure occurred on June 24, 1999, in which the boiler tubes from the 1996 overhaul, being made of the wrong material, collapsed inside the boiler and put the steam locomotive out of commission. The UP steam crew repaired it and returned it to service on November 10, 2004. It was rebuilt again in 2015 and returned to service in 2016. In addition to being one of UP's oldest locomotives, it is the only steam locomotive to never be officially retired from a North American Class I railroad.\n* UP 4014: a 4-8-8-4 Big Boy class freight steam locomotive, began operating in excursion service in 2019. It is the largest operational steam locomotive in the world. Delivered in 1941, the locomotive operated in revenue service until it made its last run on July 21, 1959, and was placed in storage until it was officially retired in 1961. Following retirement, it was donated in late 1961 to the RailGiants Train Museum in Pomona, California, where it became one of the eight Big Boys preserved around the United States. On July 23, 2013, it was announced that the UP was acquiring UP 4014 from The Southern California Chapter of The Railway and Locomotive Historical Society in Pomona, with the goal of restoring it to service. No. 4014 was moved from Pomona to the Union Pacific West Colton yard on January 26, 2014, then to Cheyenne, Wyoming from April 28, 2014, to May 8, 2014. Restoration to full operating condition was completed in May 2019, with its first excursion called \"The Great Race to Ogden\" taking place during the same month.\nHistoric diesel locomotives\nin August 1995.]]\nUP 949, 951 and 963B are a trio of streamlined General Motors Electro-Motive Division E9 passenger locomotives built in 1955. They are used to haul the UP business cars during excursions and charter specials. Originally built in 1955, the original twin 1,200-hp 12-cylinder 567 series engines have been replaced with single EMD 16-645E 2000&nbsp;hp (1.5 MW) engines and the electrical and control equipment similarly upgraded, making them more compatible with more modern locomotives. The set is made of two A units and one B unit, the latter which contains an HEP engine-generator set for powering passenger cars. They are painted in a historic paint scheme that Union Pacific Streamliners wore on such trains as the City of San Francisco and the City of Los Angeles. The two A units have been modified to eliminate the nose doors to increase safety in a collision.\nUP 951 has carried its original number since its entry into service. UP 949 was built with its current number, but later was sent to the Chicago and North Western Railway and Regional Transportation Authority as CNW/RTA #511 before being reacquired by the UP. UP 963B was built as UP E9B 970B and served as a heater car on Amtrak upon its formation before being reacquired by the UP.\nThe locomotives last ran in 2017. Since then, they have remained stored in the roundhouse at Cheyenne, WY.\nHeritage paint schemes\nSix EMD SD70ACe locomotives are painted in the liveries of railroads acquired by Union Pacific. The company says the locomotives \"pay homage to those railroads and the generations of men and women who helped to build a great nation and the foundation for our future\".\n* UP 1979: honors the  people of the union Pacific railroad, the locomotive  was painted in early 2025.\n* UP 1982: honors the Missouri Pacific Railroad, which became part of Union Pacific in 1982. Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD) delivered the locomotive on May 29, 2005. The locomotive was unveiled together with No. 1983 in a private ceremony on July 30, 2005, in Omaha, Nebraska, after which it entered regular revenue service.\n* UP 1983: honors the Western Pacific Railroad, which became part of Union Pacific in 1983. Delivered on June 6, 2005, and unveiled together with No. 1982 in a private ceremony on July 30, 2005, in Omaha, Nebraska, after which it entered regular revenue service.\n* UP 1988: honors the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad (\"the Katy\"), which became part of Union Pacific in 1988. Delivered on June 15, 2005, it was unveiled in early August 2005, after which it entered regular revenue service on August 4, pulling a train from Chicago to East St. Louis, Illinois.\n* UP 1989: honors the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad, which became part of the Southern Pacific in 1988. Delivered on May 24, 2006, unveiled on June 17, 2006, at a special UP employee event in Denver, Colorado. It also refers to the people who \"went everywhere the hard way.\n* UP 1995: honors the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company (CNW), which became a part of Union Pacific in 1995. The locomotive, painted at the Horicon, Wisconsin, shops of Wisconsin and Southern Railroad, was unveiled at a private ceremony for UP's ex-CNW employees at Proviso Rail Yard in suburban Chicago on July 15, 2006, before being publicly displayed at North Western Station (CNW's former station) in Chicago. After its unveiling, the locomotive pulled freight train from Proviso to Council Bluffs, Iowa, in conjunction with Nos. 8646 and 8701 (a set of GE Dash 9-44CW locomotives at the time still in CNW paint). The 1995 then entered regular revenue service. Metra has a heritage unit painted in similar CNW colors.\n* UP 1996: honors the Southern Pacific Transportation Company, which became a part of Union Pacific in 1996. It was unveiled on August 19, 2006, and is currently operating in regular revenue service. Southern Pacific 6051, a Daylight-painted EMD E9 locomotive that is preserved at the California State Railroad Museum was in attendance at UP 1996's unveiling. UP 1996's road number was previously held by an EMD SD40-2, which was repainted and renumbered for the 1996 Olympics. On January 26, 2014, No. 1996 helped move \"Big Boy\" locomotive No. 4014 out of the Los Angeles County Fairplex in Pomona, California, to West Colton, California.\nFile:UP 1982 EMD SD70ACe.jpg|UP 1982, which honors the Missouri Pacific Railroad\nFile:UP 1983 Leads SB Military Containers KCMO 9-15-18.jpg|UP 1983, which honors the Western Pacific Railroad\nFile:UP 1988 Freight FortWorthTX.jpg|UP 1988, which honors the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad (\"the Katy\")\nFile:Up1989 (4740457280).jpg|UP 1989, which honors the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad\nFile:UP 1995, Rochelle, 2007-03-11.jpg|UP 1995, which honors the Chicago and North Western Railway\nFile:UP 1996 (1290120334).jpg|UP 1996, which honors the Southern Pacific Transportation Company\nCommunity service paint schemes\nSix locomotives are painted to honor various people, organizations and sports events:\n* UP 1111: an EMD SD70ACe locomotive painted to honor the employees of the Union Pacific Railroad.

Delivered in 1943, it operated in revenue service until it was withdrawn from service in 1962. Following retirement, it was stored in the UP roundhouse until 1975, when it was moved to the employees' parking lot outside the depot in Cheyenne, Wyoming. It sat on display until 1979, when a team of employee volunteers restored it to service in 1981. Following the restoration, it was the largest operating steam locomotive in the world until it lost the title to UP 4014. In 2007, it underwent repairs for service and was back up and running in 2008 to continue its run, but further mechanical problems caused it to be placed back into storage in October 2010. It was subsequently retired in January 2020 following 4014's restoration.\n* UP 5511: a 2-10-2 Class TTT-6 steam locomotive. It is the last remaining member of its class and the only remaining 2-10-2 to be operated by the Union Pacific. It ran in revenue service until being withdrawn in 1956, but was used briefly in December 1958 during filming of the documentary Last of the Giants. Prior to being donated, the locomotive never operated in excursion service and has always remained in storage.\n* UP 6936: an EMD DDA40X \"Centennial\" diesel-electric locomotive, the last of its class in service. These were the largest diesel locomotives ever built and were manufactured specifically for UP. Built in January 1971, it served in revenue service over the next decade and into the mid-1980s across the Union Pacific system until making its last regular freight trip on May 6, 1985. It then became a part of the railroad's excursion fleet until being placed into storage in 2016. Union Pacific has marked DD40X on the cab exteriors, while EMD literature inconsistently refers to this model as either DD-40X or DDA40X.\nBesides the three locomotives, other pieces of equipment being donated include an unrestored E9B locomotive, four coaches, a diner lounge car, two business cars, a baggage car, and a caboose.\nRRHMA has plans to eventually restore the No. 3985 and 5511 steam locomotives to operating condition. As part of the deal, the Union Pacific has the option to reclaim the equipment at any time upon reimbursing the museum for its costs. On May 13, 2022, RRHMA launched a fundraiser to raise enough money for the restoration of the Nos. 3985 and 5511 steam locomotives. The first five cars were moved to Silvis in August 2022, while the rest of the donated equipment were moved to their new home in November 2022. Restoration efforts on the No. 3985 began in January 2023. As of May 2025, Nos. 3985 and 5511 are under restoration, No. 6936 is operational at the RRHMA, and many passenger cars have been repaired and repainted.\nFile:Union Pacific Challenger 3985 01.jpg|UP 3985 running through Alton, Iowa on October 1, 2008.\nFile:Union Pacific TTT-6 No. 5511.jpg|UP 5511 in Brady, Nebraska, being towed to Silvis, Illinois, in November 2022.\nFile:UP 6936 EMD DDA40X.jpg|UP 6936 near Watseka, Illinois in February 2008.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.up.com/heritage/fleet/ Heritage Fleet] Home Page"
