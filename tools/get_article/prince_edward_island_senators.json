      "text": "# Prince Edward Island Senators\n\nThe Prince Edward Island Senators were a professional ice hockey team that played in the American Hockey League (AHL) from 1993 to 1996. Originally located in New Haven, Connecticut, for 21 seasons, including one as the affiliate of the National Hockey League (NHL) Ottawa Senators, the franchise relocated to Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, for the 1993–94 season. During their three seasons in PEI, they finished either last or second to last in attendance in the AHL, with average attendance ranging from 2,300 to 2,500. The most notable NHL player to come out of the PEI organization was Pavol Demitra, who spent three seasons with P.E.I. The franchise suspended operations after the 1996 season, claiming that Charlottetown was too small to support an AHL team.\nSeason-by-season results\nRegular season\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Season!!
