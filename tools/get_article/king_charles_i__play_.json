      "text": "# King Charles I (play)\n\nKing Charles I is a 1737 tragedy by the British writer William Havard. Written as an imitation of the style of Shakespeare's  history plays, it focuses on the imprisonment of Charles I following  his defeat in the Civil War and execution by the English Republic. It was a major success and anticipated later works by portraying Charles as a devoted family man who is undone by the scheming of Oliver Cromwell and his allies.\nIt premiered at the Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre with a cast that included Henry Giffard as King Charles, William Giffard as Ireton, William Hamilton as the Duke of Gloucester, William Havard as Bishop Juxton, Thomas Wright as Oliver Cromwell, Benjamin Johnson as Fairfax and Anna Marcella Giffard as Queen Henrietta Maria.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Baines, Paul & Ferarro, Julian & Rogers, Pat.
