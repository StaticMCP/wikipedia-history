The film stars the voices of Kenneth Branagh, Uma Thurman, Mark Hamill, Pierce Brosnan, Roman Griffin Davis, Forest Whitaker, Ben Kingsley, and Oscar Isaac.\nThe King of Kings was released in the United States by Angel Studios on April 11, 2025. It received mixed reviews from critics and was a box office success, grossing $77.5 million.\nPlot\nCharles Dickens attempts to recite his story A Christmas Carol to a London theater audience, but is interrupted by his overly rambunctious son Walter, who enacts the exploits of King Arthur backstage along with his cat, Willa. Dickens considers punishing the boy for ruining the recital, but instead his wife Catherine suggests he tell his son about a king even greater than Arthur: the \"King of Kings\", Jesus Christ. Initially hesitant, Walter agrees to listen to his father's story, but on condition that he can stop if he finds it boring.\nAs the tale unfolds, Walter becomes so emotionally involved in the life of Jesus that he demands his father finish the story, despite Charles' warnings that it becomes upsetting. Walter begins to imagine himself and Willa within the story; travelling along with Jesus and the disciples, they witness all the events in Christ's life: the Nativity, the Ministry, the Miracles and the Passion. His father also explains him the meaning of Jesus' sacrifice by telling him the story of Adam and Eve and the original sin, but Walter has great difficulty accepting and understanding such an atrocious and unjust death.\nDeeply saddened by Jesus' death, Walter suddenly finds himself sinking to the bottom of the sea, like the apostle Peter when he attempted to follow Jesus as he walked on water. Walter calls out for help and is rescued by Jesus, who disappears underwater and replaced with an empty cross. Returning to dry land, Walter contemplates the cross and begins to feel redemption and salvation through Jesus' sacrifice and is overwhelmed with admiration and gratitude as he begins to understand Jesus' love for him.\nFinally, Walter finds the empty tomb of Jesus, where the resurrected Jesus bids him a silent goodbye before walking towards the horizon. Overjoyed to realize that Jesus still lives, Walter runs to tell his siblings the story, inspiring Dickens to write down the life of Jesus for his children. The film closes with words from the Gospel of John: \"I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.\"\nVoice cast\nProduction\nIn September 2024, it was announced that an animated adaptation loosely based on The Life of Our Lord by Charles Dickens was in development, with Kenneth Branagh, Uma Thurman, Roman Griffin Davis, Oscar Isaac, Forest Whitaker, Pierce Brosnan, Mark Hamill, and Ben Kingsley joining the cast. In March 2025, veteran voice actors Dee Bradley Baker, James Arnold Taylor, Jim Cummings, Fred Tatasciore, and Vanessa Marshall were each announced to be among the cast through social media.\nDespite being a South Korean production, visual effects were done by Animost Studio in Vietnam, the post-production was done at the SunJive Studios in Adelaide, and the voice cast are American and British. The total budget cost before marketing was ₩36 billion (around $25.2 million at the time of production).\nRelease\nIn November 2024, Angel Studios acquired the rights to the film in North America. The official teaser for the film was released in November 2024. The film was released on April 11, 2025.\nReception\nBox office\nThe King of Kings grossed $60.3 million in the United States and Canada and $17.3 million in other territories, for a total of $77.6 million worldwide.\nIn the United States and Canada, The King of Kings was released alongside The Amateur, Warfare, and Drop, and was projected to gross $12–14&nbsp;million from 3,200 theaters in its opening weekend.
