Unlike the Screen Award for Best Actress, which is determined by a jury, this category is decided by public voting and is awarded to the actress whose performance is deemed the most popular among viewers.\nAishwarya Rai was the inaugural recipient of the award in 2009 for her role in Jodhaa Akbar. Deepika Padukone holds the record for the most wins in this category, with five awards for her performances in 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2019. The final recipient of the award was Kangana Ranaut, who won in 2020 for her performances in Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi and Judgementall Hai Kya. Following that year, the category was discontinued.\nSuperlatives\nMultiple wins\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Wins\n!Actor\n|-\n|5\n|Deepika Padukone\n|-\n|2\n|Katrina Kaif, Aishwarya Rai\n|}\nWinners\nholds the record of maximum awards in the category, with five wins]]\n{| cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" border=\"0\" width=\"50%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#d1e4fd\"\n!
