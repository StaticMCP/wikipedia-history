The region is based around two river basins - Chorokhi and Kura (Mtkvari), and also partially includes the upper source of the Aras river. In modern usage it most often denotes the territory that was administered or claimed by Georgian Democratic Republic but is nowadays part of Turkey due to the Soviet-Turkish deal in 1921.\nThe term \"Tao-Klarjeti\" is based on the names of two most important provinces of the region — Tao and Klarjeti. The term is equivalent to “Zemo Kartli” (i.e., Upper Kartli or Upper Iberia) and is also a synonym for historical Meskheti.\nCultural and historical heritage\nMany important Georgian cultural monuments from the middle ages are located on the territory of Tao-Klarjeti and many of them are preserved as ruins. Several monuments of medieval Georgian architecture – abandoned or converted churches, monasteries, bridges and castles – are scattered across the area.\nBest known are the monasteries of Khandzta, Khakhuli, Ancha, the churches of Oshki, Ishkhani, Bana, Parkhali, Doliskana, Otkhta Eklesia, Opiza, Shatberdi, Rabati(\"New Rabati\"-\"Yeni Rabati\"), Parekhi and Tbeti.\nGallery\nImage:Oshki1.jpg|Oshki Cathedral\nImage:Khakhuli1.jpg|Khakhuli Church\nImage:DOLISKANA2.jpg|Dolisqana Church\nImage:Bana, Tao-Klarjeti.jpg|Bana Cathedral\nImage:ტბეთი, 1888 - პავლინოვის ფოტო.jpg|Tbeti Cathedral\nImage:Пархали, Тао, Турция.
