Often mischaracterized as gloomy, goth rock misanthropes -- only partly true -- JAMC were in truth huge fans of '60s sunshine pop, surf rock, and even hip-hop and aspired to a kind of D.I.Y. Phil Spector Wall of Sound aesthetic that found them substituting Spector's strings and horns with walls of feedbacking guitar.\" and concluded \"Ultimately, The Power of Negative Thinking isn't the whole JAMC story, but it's the whole story behind the scenes and A-side singles, and sometimes the B-sides. Even better.\"\nAaron Brophy of Chart Attack observed, \"When you look at it carefully, what the Chain attempted to do was nothing short of redefining the parameters and reigniting the spirit of rock 'n' roll. That's a lot to put on the shoulders of a couple angry brothers from Glasgow who dressed in too much black, but few others since them have done as much to advance the sound of old school rock 'n' roll.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n* Vanessa Atkins – Editorial Supervision\n* Glenn A.
