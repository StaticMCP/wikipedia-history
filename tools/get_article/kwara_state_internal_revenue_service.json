The service got certified in ISO 9001: 2015 Quality Management System and ISO/IEC 22301: 2012 Business Continuity Management System.\nThe service is currently under the leadership of Shade Omoniyi who was appointed as Executive Chairman on October 1, 2019. She is part of a cabinet which comprises over 50% women, appointed by Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRasaq.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.irs.kw.gov.ng Kwara State Internal Revenue Service Website]"
