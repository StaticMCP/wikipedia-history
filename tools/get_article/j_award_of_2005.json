It combines a lot of different influences which sound contemporary, fun and refreshing today. People have paid out on them for being retro. I'd like to remind everyone that Led Zeppelin were criticised early in their career for stealing from blues greats, as were the Rolling Stones, and Dylan was seen as a Woody Guthrie imitator when he started out. So hopefully Wolfmother are also now off to a highly successful career!\"\nReferences"
