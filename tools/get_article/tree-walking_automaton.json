The concept was originally proposed by Aho and Ullman.\nThe following article deals with tree-walking automata. For a different notion of tree automaton, closely related to regular tree languages, see branching automaton.\nDefinition\nAll trees are assumed to be binary, with labels from a fixed alphabet Σ.\nInformally, a tree-walking automaton (TWA) A is a finite state device that walks over an input tree in a sequential manner. At each moment A visits a node v in state q. Depending on the state q, the label of the node v, and whether the node is the root, a left child, a right child or a leaf, A changes its state from q to q&prime; and moves to the parent of v or its left or right child. A TWA accepts a tree if it enters an accepting state, and rejects if its enters a rejecting state or makes an infinite loop. As with string automata, a TWA may be deterministic or nondeterministic.\nMore formally, a (nondeterministic) tree-walking automaton over an alphabet Σ is a tuple\nwhere Q is a finite set of states, its subsets , , and  are the sets of initial, accepting and rejecting states, respectively, and {{math|δ ⊆ (Q × { root, left, right, leaf } × Σ × { up, left, right } × Q)}} is the transition relation.\nExample\nA simple example of a tree-walking automaton is a TWA that performs depth-first search (DFS) on the input tree. The automaton A has three states, Q = \\{ q_{0}, q_{\\mathit{left}}, q_{\\mathit{right}} \\}. A begins in the root in state q_{0} and descends to the left subtree. Then it processes the tree recursively. Whenever A enters a node v in state q_{\\mathit{left}}, it means that the left subtree of v has just been processed, so it proceeds to the right subtree of v. If A enters a node v in state q_{\\mathit{right}}, it means that the whole subtree with root v has been processed and A walks to the parent of v and changes its state to q_{\\mathit{left}} or q_{\\mathit{right}}, depending on whether v is a left or right child.\nProperties\nUnlike branching automata, tree-walking automata are difficult to analyze: even simple properties are nontrivial to prove. The following list summarizes some known facts related to TWA:\n*As shown by Bojańczyk and Colcombet, deterministic TWA are strictly weaker than nondeterministic ones (\\mathit{DTWA} \\subsetneq \\mathit{TWA})\n* Deterministic TWA are closed under complementation (but it is not known whether the same holds for nondeterministic ones)\n* The set of languages recognized by TWA is strictly contained in regular tree languages (\\mathit{TWA} \\subsetneq \\mathit{REG}), i.e. there exist regular languages that are not recognized by any tree-walking automaton, see Bojańczyk and Colcombet.\nSee also\n*Pebble automata, an extension of tree-walking automata\nReferences\nExternal links\n*Mikołaj Bojańczyk: [https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~bojan/papers/twasurvey.pdf Tree-walking automata].
