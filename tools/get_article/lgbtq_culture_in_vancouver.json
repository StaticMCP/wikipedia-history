Commercial Drive has historically acted as a gayborhood for the Vancouver lesbian community. Historically, LGBTQ people have also gathered in the Chinatown and Gastown neighborhoods. Former establishments include Dino's Turkish Baths, a gay bathhouse on Hastings, and the city's first drag bar, BJ's, on Pender Street.\nCBC has said Vancouver is seen as a haven for LGBTQ people, and Condé Nast Traveler has called Vancouver the most gay-friendly city in Canada.\nCommunity centres\nQmunity, founded in 1979 as the Vancouver Gay Community Centre and formerly known as The Centre, is located on Bute Street in Davie Village.\nEvents\n, 2014]]\nLGBTQ events in Vancouver include:\n* Pride Week 1973\n* Queer Arts Festival\n* Vancouver Pride Festival, annual LGBTQ+ pride event\n* Vancouver Queer Film Festival\nThe annual Gay Men's Health Summit is hosted by Vancouver's Community-Based Research Centre for Gay Men's Health (CBRC).\nThere is a walking tour that spotlights LGBTQ+ history in the city as well.

Its precursor was a newsletter for the Vancouver Gay Community Centre (now Qmunity) created in 1979. Angles was largely produced by volunteers. According to Alex Spence in their Angles and VGCC News index, “Angles presented a wide range... of coverage in its issues”. Everything from local and international news, a monthly Vancouver events calendar, cartoons, to a vast array of articles on local LGBTQ sporting groups. According to Spence “[by] 1996 Angles claimed 36,000 readers a month…” across Canada. Spence points to the increase in competition brought in by Xtra! West’s launch in 1993 that eventually caused Angles to close. Specifically, that there was a migration of advertisers from Angles to Xtra!, decreasing advertising revenue that Angles needed to maintain operations. In October 2024 Qmunity relaunched Angles as a digital publication.\nXtra Vancouver was a gay bi-weekly newspaper, published by Pink Triangle Press between 1993 and 2015.
