It is used in primary and adult education and in various publications.\nIt has mainly gained acceptance among the easternmost group of speakers, and is more prevalent among those who have been educated in it. Many other speakers prefer oral transmission of knowledge, Devanagari, or Latin, but Warang Chiti holds prestige among many Ho speakers.\nHistory\nCommunity leader Bodra invented it as an alternative to the writing systems devised by Christian missionaries. He claims that the alphabet was invented in the 13th century by Deowan Turi, and that it was rediscovered in a shamanistic vision and Bodra modernized.\nLetters\nWarang Citi is quite distinct from other writing systems of India, and it has features of an abugida and an alphabet. As in Brahmic abugidas, consonant letters have an inherent vowel, usually /a/ or /ɔ/ but sometimes /ɛ/. The inherent vowel is not pronounced at the end of the word. Unlike in Brahmic abugidas, and more like in an alphabet, the full vowel letters are always written after the consonant, letters usually don't form ligatures, and there is no virama character.\nIt follows capitalization rules as are done in English and follows English punctuation. There are few ligatures that combine to form new sounds, and there are conjunct consonants that are used as well by stacking in some cases. It is written from left to right in horizontal lines.\nThe script begins with the letter Ong, which corresponds to Om in other Brahmic scripts. It has 32 letters in total with capital and small letters.\n{| class=\"wikitable letters-table letters-pink\"\n|\n|}}\n|\n|\n|\n|}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}}\n|}\nNumerals\nWarang Citi uses its own set of numerals. The digits 0-9 are used in modern writing, but the signs for larger numbers are falling into disuse.\n{| class=\"wikitable letters-table letters-pink\"\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nUnicode\nWarang Citi was added to the Unicode Standard in June 2014 with the release of version 7.0.\nThe Unicode block for Warang Citi is U+118A0&ndash;U+118FF.
