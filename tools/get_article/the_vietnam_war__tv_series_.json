Ward, and narrated by Peter Coyote. The first episode premiered on PBS on September 17, 2017. This series is one of the few PBS series to carry a TV-MA rating.\nProduction\nThe series cost around $30 million and took more than 10 years to make. It was produced by Ken Burns and Lynn Novick, who had previously collaborated on The War (2007), Baseball: The Tenth Inning (2010), and Prohibition (2011). The production companies were WETA-TV in Washington, D.C., and Burns' Florentine Films. It was funded in part by the National Endowment for the Humanities.\nThe series features interviews with 79 witnesses, including many Americans who fought in the war or opposed it as Anti-war protesters, as well as Vietnamese combatants and civilians from both the North and the South. Burns deliberately avoided \"historians or other expert talking heads\" and \"onscreen interviews with polarizing boldfaced names like John Kerry, John McCain, Henry Kissinger and Jane Fonda.\" Instead, interviews were intended to provide a ground-up view of the War from the perspective of everyday people who lived through it. The third episode features an interview with retired UPI reporter Joseph L. Galloway, who was awarded a Bronze Star with \"V\" device for assisting with the wounded in the Battle of Ia Drang. Others interviewed include Vincent Okamoto, Karl Marlantes, and Tim O'Brien, author of The Things They Carried, a popular collection of linked short stories about the war.\nThe researchers for the film also accessed more than 24,000 photographs and examined 1,500 hours of archival footage. Within the series' 17-and-a-quarter-hours, there are scenes covering 25 battles, ten of which are detailed scenes documenting and describing the action from a number of perspectives.\nEpisodes\n|ShortSummary=\n|Aux4=1 hour 22 minutes (PBS)/55 minutes (BBC)\n|LineColor=DEDDE2\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|Aux4=1 hour 24 minutes (PBS)/55 minutes (BBC)\n|LineColor=DEDDE2\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|Aux4=1 hour 54 minutes (PBS)/55 minutes (BBC)\n|LineColor=DEDDE2\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|Aux4=1 hour 54 minutes (PBS)/55 minutes (BBC)\n|LineColor=DEDDE2\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|Aux4=1 hour 25 minutes (PBS)/55 minutes (BBC)\n|LineColor=DEDDE2\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|Aux4=1 hour 24 minutes (PBS)/55 minutes (BBC)\n|LineColor=DEDDE2\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|Aux4=1 hour 47 minutes (PBS)/55 minutes (BBC)\n|LineColor=DEDDE2\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|Aux4=1 hour 49 minutes (PBS)/55 minutes (BBC)\n|LineColor=DEDDE2\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|Aux4=1 hour 49 minutes (PBS)/55 minutes (BBC)\n|LineColor=DEDDE2\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|Aux4=1 hour 47 minutes (PBS)/55 minutes (BBC)\n|LineColor=DEDDE2\n}}\n}}\nInterviewees\nPhotographs and additional details about the interviewees can be seen on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20191102205540/http://thevietnamwar2.lunchbox.pbs.org/kenburns/the-vietnam-war/about/about-the-participants/ PBS website].\nHome media\nThe Vietnam War was released on Blu-ray and DVD on September 19, 2017. Extras include a 45-minute preview program, two segments on the lives of two of the series' participants, and deleted scenes. The series is also available for digital download, and can also be seen on Kanopy.\nBook\nAccompanying the series is a 640-page companion book, The Vietnam War: An Intimate History by Ward and Burns. Containing an introduction by Burns and Novick, it was published by Burns’ long-time publisher, Alfred A. Knopf, and released on September 5, 2017.\nReception\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the series an approval rating of 96% based on 49 reviews and a weighted average score of 9.36/10. The site's critical consensus states, \"The Vietnam War revisits a dark chapter in American history with patience, grace, and a refreshing – and sobering – perspective informed by those who fought.\" Metacritic, another aggregator, gave the series a normalized score of 90 out of 100 based on 19 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nWashington Post opinion writer George Will noted that the series is \"an example of how to calmly assess episodes fraught with passion and sorrow.\" He continues: \"The combat films are extraordinary; the recollections and reflections of combatants and others on both sides are even more so, featuring photos of them then and interviews with many of them now.\" Will concludes his column by declaring the series a \"masterpiece\".\nJames Poniewozik of The New York Times wrote, \"Will break your heart and win your mind.\"\nKen Burns anticipated politically motivated criticisms of the film from both the left and the right: \"After The Vietnam War I'll have to lie low. A lot of people will think I'm a Commie pinko, and a lot of people will think I'm a right-wing nutcase, and that's sort of the way it goes.\"\nSan Jose Mercury News writer Tatiana Sanchez reported that some American and South Vietnamese veterans were \"angry, [and] disappointed\" with the documentary. They characterized it as a \"betrayal\". She writes: \"veterans of the South Vietnamese military say they were largely left out of the narrative, their voices drowned out by the film's focus on North Vietnam and its communist leader, Ho Chi Minh. And many American veterans say that the series had several glaring omissions and focused too much on leftist anti-war protesters and soldiers who came to oppose the war.\"\nHistorian Mark Moyar published a review in which he criticized the series. Moyar felt that Burns and Novick overemphasized American battlefield defeats during 1966–1967 while glossing over the many victories. He also felt that Burns did not properly explain why American generals ordered their forces to fight so fiercely for seemingly meaningless hills; Moyar feels that engaging the Viet Cong in sparsely populated areas was a superior option to letting them draw near populated cities, where American airpower and artillery would require more careful use. Moyar also contended that Burns and Novick should have more strongly emphasized the amount of foreign aid that the North Vietnamese received from the Chinese and that both Vietnams were not entirely self-sufficient. He also believed that Nixon, a mercurial president who expressed many contradictory opinions, could not be taken entirely seriously in the tape excerpts used in the documentary wherein he appears to express a desire to cut South Vietnam loose immediately after the 1972 elections and the Paris Peace Accords, while the documentary let the excerpts stand as seeming fact.\nScholar Thomas Bass criticizes the film for its \"urge toward healing and reconciliation, rather than truth\". Bass's main objection is that the film perpetuates the narrative of the two Vietnams that justified U.S. involvement, arguing that \"Southern Vietnam was never an independent country\" and that Edward Lansdale played a role in that U.S. creation. He notes the prominent feature of Duong Van Mai Elliott in promoting this view, and the absence of a Daniel Ellsberg interview. Bass contends that this, together with the film's reliance on architects of the war such as \"former generals, CIA agents and government officials, who are not identified by rank or title, but merely by their names and anodyne descriptions\" is deemed as evidence of the film's \"conservative credentials\". Newsweek echoed Bass's objection that the movie obscures facts about the root causes of the war and its framing by the United States.\nUniversity of Chicago historian Mark Philip Bradley gave the mini-series a mixed review, saying \"it is mainly unsuccessful at evoking the complexities of Vietnam’s past... We never hear a discussion of how American empire and the broader political, economic, and cultural complexities of the making of twentieth-century American global hegemony were bound up in the U.S. intervention in Vietnam. Questions of race and racism are only lightly addressed.\" But Bradley argued that the series was successful in telling \"powerful individual stories that bring us into the quotidian dimensions of the American war in Vietnam in far more compelling ways than I have seen many other documentaries or books on Vietnam do.\"\nHowever, Mark Lawson of The Guardian contends that \"Such is the breadth of analysis here that Burns suggests the roots of the conflict began even before the story he told in The Civil War: the opening episode (of 10) is date-stamped “1858-1961”. Viewers’ double-take at that number 18 is soothed by a typically erudite explanation of the way French colonial ambitions in south-east Asia established faultlines that shaped the US’s later intervention.\" Although he acknowledges that \"The early programmes could have done more (especially for an international audience) to explain the toxin of anti-communism in the US at the time: there is no mention of the red-hunts of Senator McCarthy, which surely did as much to create the context for the US’s misjudgment as a mistaken solidarity with French aims.\"\nJournalist Huy Duc argued that the Vietnamese communist government did not like this documentary film because it did not follow their propaganda. Dr. Nguyen Tien Hung, former Minister of Planning of South Vietnam from 1973 to 1975, questioned the leftist and anti-South Vietnam bias of the film when it presented the views of leftist reporters without the voices of American reporters who were \"revisionists\". Lan Cao, daughter of the late South Vietnamese General Cao Van Vien, argued that the film was wrong in claiming that Vietnamese refugees from communism who came to the United States were only the elite of Vietnam, that American soldiers were mostly conscripts, that American soldiers relied on race and circumstance, that the communists breached the U.S. Embassy during the Tet Offensive, and that South Vietnamese soldiers were unwilling and unable to fight. She argued that American General Barry R. McCaffrey, advisor to the South Vietnamese Airborne Corps, believed that \"the sacrifice, valor and commitment of the South Vietnamese army was greatly diminished by American political and media consciousness.\" She also argued that the Viet Cong were not a disparate guerrilla but were supported by North Vietnam while North Vietnam received $3.2 billion in aid or even double that from the Soviet Union and China. Phan Quang Tue, a retired San Francisco Immigration Court employee, commented: “Looking through the films that have been made, I see that there is no film that can be more truthful, and I don’t think there will be another film in the future because by the time this film comes out, it will be 42 years after the war. Two or three generations have grown up, this film faithfully records history, not of the war but through the history of that war, the history of Vietnam, North and South. I think what needs to be done is to widely disseminate this film in Vietnam.”\nMusic\nScore\nDuring production, Burns and Novick approached Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross of Nine Inch Nails, asking them to create a score for the series. According to Reznor, he felt honored that they would offer them the opportunity, but immediately asked \"why us?\", feeling as their music wouldn't immediately come to mind for a documentary on the Vietnam War. Burns explained that he wanted a more \"modern take\" rather than just songs from the era. He then showed Reznor and Ross video clips of the documentary, with some of the group's other songs being used as a temporary soundtrack, which Reznor described as \"powerful\" and \"emotionally rich,\" convincing them to join the project.\nSoundtrack album\nThe PBS website describes the series as featuring \"more than 120 iconic popular songs that define the era\", including songs by then contemporary artists. Of these, 38 songs were selected for the series' soundtrack album, which was released on September 15, 2017.\nEpisode overview\n* Episode 1 includes Bob Dylan's \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\", T-Bone Walker's \"Mean Old World\", and Rosemary Clooney's \"Come On-A In My House\".
