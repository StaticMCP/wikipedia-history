The division was formed in September 1914 and organized over the next month, arriving in the line in mid-October. It was part of the first wave of new divisions formed at the outset of World War I, which were numbered the 43rd through 54th Reserve Divisions.  The division was initially part of XXV Reserve Corps.  The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. The division was initially recruited in the V Army Corps area, which covered the Prussian Province of Posen and much of Lower Silesia in the Province of Silesia, and later received many replacements from the IV Army Corps area, which covered the Prussian Province of Saxony, the Duchy of Anhalt, and several of the Thuringian states.\nCombat chronicle\nThe 49th Reserve Division initially fought on the Eastern Front, entering the line in mid-October. It fought in the Battle of Łódź in November–December 1914 and then spent most of the period until mid-1915 fighting along the Rawka and Bzura Rivers.  In July and August 1915 it fought in the Battle of Warsaw and then participated in the follow-on engagements as German forces drove the Russians back to a line along the Shchara and Servech Rivers.  The division remained on the Shchara/Servech line until August 1916.  The division then fought in various parts of the line, including in the Carpathians, until January 1917, when it was transferred to the Western Front.  In 1917, it fought in the Battle of Arras, the Battle of Passchendaele, and the tank battle of Cambrai.  It remained in the line in the Flanders region until the end of the war.  In 1917, Allied intelligence assessed the division as a good division.  In 1918 it was rated second class.\nOrder of battle on formation\nThe 49th Reserve Division was initially organized as a square division, with essentially the same organization as the reserve divisions formed on mobilization.
