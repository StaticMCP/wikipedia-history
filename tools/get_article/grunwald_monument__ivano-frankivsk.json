The grandeur of the celebrations in Kraków, including the unveiling of a monumental statue to the victorious Polish King Władysław II Jagiełło, inspired the spontaneous organization of similar commemorations in the city of Stanisławów. Many of the city's residents expressed a desire to attend the historic jubilee in Kraków; for this reason, local celebrations were postponed by two months to allow them to participate. At the commemorations, Vice-Mayor Karol Fiedler and Councilor Józef Sroczyński served as the city's official delegates.\nIn Stanisławów, a committee was formed to organize the celebrations marking the 500th anniversary of the Battle of Grunwald. C. Lachowski served as chairman and J. Krajewski as secretary. Among its members was the then-mayor of the city, . Plans to erect a monument in Stanisławów marking the anniversary were only unveiled in September, with the local newspaper Kurjer Stanisławowski (issue no. 1304 dated September 4, 1910) writing as follows:\n| author    =\n| title     =\n| source    =\n| character =\n| multiline =\n| class     =\n| style     =\n}}\nThe anniversary celebrations in Stanisławów were scheduled for 18 September 1910; however, work on the monument continued well into November, including the polishing of the obelisk column, which brought the monument’s height to nearly 8 meters. Finally, in December, with the committee nearing dissolution, it published a report on its expenses for the celebrations, including the construction of the monument, in the pages of Kurjer Stanisławowski. The cost of the monument alone amounted to 1,968 crowns and 20 heller, making it the largest single expenditure. The remaining expenses totaled 2,945 crowns and 31 heller, which included costs for printing and postage, commemorative materials, a theater performance, and street decorations.\nAt its unveiling, the monument was described as modest yet tastefully crafted. Contemporary observers noted the elegance of the obelisk. The monument was listed alongside the  in the 1930 Przewodnik ilustrowany po województwie stanisławowskiem (Illustrated Guide to the Stanisławów Voivodeship), published in collaboration with the Provincial Tourist Commission in Stanisławów.\nThe monument stood for a little over 30 years. By the time Stanisławów fell under German occupation in 1941 during the Second World War, it had already sustained damage. Ultimately, in 1942, the monument was blown up by the Germans. According to a local legend, the descendants of the Teutons could not tolerate a reminder of their ancient defeat in the city they had just captured. Today, a monument dedicated to Ukrainian poet and writer Shevchenko marks the location where the monument once stood.\nDescription\nThe Grunwald Monument stood in  in Stanisławów (present-day Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine). It was modest in form, resembling a victory column. Its dimensions vary between sources—per Kurjer Stanisławowski, it was originally projected to reach 6 meters. However, its column appears to have ultimately reached a height of 8 meters. At its top stood a white eagle, a Polish national symbol, made of cement with its wings outstretched. Its base, measuring 3 by 2.5 meters, consisting of boulders stacked against each other, with alpine flowers cultivated between them. A plaque was affixed to the base, bearing the following inscription:\n{| style=\"margin: 0 auto; width: 100%; max-width: 600px; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n| style=\"width: 50%; text-align: center; vertical-align: top;\" |\n| style=\"width: 50%; text-align: center; vertical-align: top;\" |\n|}\nSee also\n*Grunwald Monument, Kraków\nReferences"
