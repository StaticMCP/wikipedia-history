This was the 6th Presidential election held in the country's history, and the Nominations were accepted on 17 December 2009. Incumbent President Mahinda Rajapaksa proceeded to win re-election with 57.88% of the vote, defeating Sarath Fonseka of the New Democratic Front, back by the United National Party. Fonseka received 40%, carrying the formerly LTTE-occupied Northern and Eastern Provinces. The remaining twenty candidates each garnered less than 0.5% of the popular vote.\nThe elections were announced on 23 November 2009 when President Rajapaksa decided to seek a fresh mandate prior to the expiration of his term in 2011. Nominations were accepted on 17 December 2009.\nRajapaksa, who was elected president for a 6-year term in November 2005, was the candidate of the ruling United People's Freedom Alliance. General Sarath Fonseka, a former commander of the Sri Lankan Army, was his main opponent in the election. Fonseka had been endorsed by a number of main opposition parties, including the United National Party and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna.\nBackground\nIn 2005, Mahinda Rajapaksa was elected to his first term as president, defeating opposition leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, the United National Party (UNP) candidate. Prior to the election, Mahinda Rajapaksa served as Prime Minister under President Chandrika Kumaratunga from 2004 to 2005. Rajapaksa won a narrow victory, by 190,000 votes, or 50.29% of the popular vote. The separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam had called for a boycott of the election in the Northern and Eastern provinces, resulting in a minimal turnout, which the opposition claimed resulted in their defeat.\nThe term of the Office of the President is 6 years, and the 3rd Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka allows the president to ask for an Early Presidential election after four years into his first term of office. Rajapaksa, whose first term began on 19 November 2005, is constitutionally eligible to call an Early Presidential election since 19 November 2009. Accordingly, President Rajapaksa informed the Commissioner of Elections about his intention to hold a presidential election before the end of his current term of office. He announced his intention via a Gazette Extraordinary, issued on 23 November 2009.\nThe elections would be the first presidential elections to be held in Sri Lanka since the end of the Sri Lankan Civil War.\nPreparations\nOn 27 November 2009, Dayananda Dissanayake, Commissioner of Elections, issued that the Presidential election would be scheduled for 26 January 2010. Nominations were accepted from 9.00am to 11.00am IST, on 17 December 2009. Sri Lankans registered with the Department of Elections, and eligible to vote, totaled 14,088,500, a significant increase from 13,327,160 in the previous Presidential elections held in 2005. Over 11,000 polling booths were set up across the country for receiving ballots.\nCandidates\nMahinda Rajapaksa\nIn May 2009, the Sri Lanka Army tactfully defeated separatist the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, thus bringing an end to the 26-year long Sri Lankan civil war. A promise Sri Lanka's previous three presidents tried and failed to secure, the war victory greatly boosted the popularity of incumbent president Mahinda Rajapaksa, thus leading Rajapaksa's United People's Freedom Alliance to unprecedented victories in the provincial council elections following the war's end.\nIn November 2009, Rajapaksa called for an early presidential election almost two years prior to the expiration of his first term, and sought a fresh mandate and a longer term based on his current widespread support and popularity.\nSarath Fonseka\nGeneral Sarath Fonseka was considered a national hero for bringing an end to the Sri Lankan civil war as Commander of the Sri Lanka Army from 2005 to 2009. However, following the war victory, tensions grew between Fonseka and the incumbent president, with the former accusing Rajapaksa of sidelining him after the end of the war. Opposition parties expected early elections and approached Fonseka, asking him to run as a \"common candidate\" for the opposition against Rajapaksa.\nAfter weeks of rumours, Fonseka eventually retired from the military in November 2009 and announced his candidacy two weeks later. He ran as the candidate of the New Democratic Front, using the swan symbol. He was backed by a number of opposition parties, including the United National Party, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, and the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, and also signed a memorandum of understanding with Tamil National Alliance leader R. Sampanthan.\nMinor candidates\nApart from Rajapaksa and Fonseka, 20 other candidates had their nominations accepted, and appeared on ballot papers. One nomination—Nelson Perera of the Sri Lanka Progressive Front—was rejected on technical grounds. This was the most candidates in a Sri Lankan presidential election at the time, breaking the record of 13 in the 2005 presidential election.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|-\n!

The Centre for Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV) had recorded 809 incidents from 23 November 2009, when the elections were officially announced, to 25 January 2010. People’s Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) has recorded 666 incidents between 17 December 2009 and 25 January 2010. The UN, United States, and EU expressed concern over the level of violence. Election monitoring groups stated that this election was the most violent in more than 20 years. Although supporters of both main candidates were blamed for the incidents, the responsibility for most was pinned on Rajapaksa's supporters. However, government politician Wimal Weerawansa accused the opposition of orchestrating violence against their own supporters and meetings in order to blame Rajapaksa's backers. According to the National Polls Observation Center, criminal gangs and deserters from the army were employed to incite violence.\nThe government promised tight security on the day of the election, deploying over 68,000 policemen to keep the polls safe, with the Sri Lankan Military providing additional support. The election monitoring group Centre for Free and Fair Elections deployed 6,500 monitors on election day, with the PAFFREL deploying a further 6,000, including 14 foreign monitors. The government denied rumours of possible post-election violence, with Foreign Minister Rohitha Bogollagama saying, \"I don't think the people of Sri Lanka have time for street protests. It has never happened.\"\nElection day was largely peaceful, with a few minor incidents reported. According to Inspector General of Police Mahinda Balasuriya, no major incidents occurred during the election. A number of explosions, however, were heard in Jaffna and Vavuniya in the north of the country during the day.\nViolence\nThere were hundreds of violent incidents during the run-up to the election. Officially, there have been four murders related to the election:\n*12 January 2010 – Kusumawathie Kuruppuarachchi, a 58-year-old mother was shot dead when gunmen on motorbikes opened fire on a bus carrying Fonseka supporters in Hungama, Hambantota District.\n*16 January 2010 – Saman Kumara, a Rajapaksa supporter, was shot dead in a clash between supporters of the two main candidates in Madurankuliya, Puttalam District.\n*18 January 2010 – Dhammika Herath, a 33-year-old businessman, was beaten to death whilst pasting posters supporting Fonseka in Wariyapola, Kurunegala District.\n*18 January 2010 – D. M. Suranga Indrajith, a 27-year-old driver for government minister Jayarathna Herath, was killed in a grenade attack in Vanduragala, Kurunegala District.\nThe CMEV has linked a fifth death to the elections:\n*19 January 2010 – Lingeswaran, a Fonseka supporter, was found dead on the Kandy-Matale railway line in Warapitiya, Matale District.\nMisuse of state resources\nThere were accusations of widespread misuse of state property during the election campaign. State-owned institutions paid for numerous advertisements supporting Rajapaksa, while public officials, state owned buildings and vehicles were allegedly used for Rajapaksa's campaign. State-owned television stations gave extensive coverage to Rajapaksa's campaign, with little mention of other candidates. Elections Commissioner Dissanayake criticised the government for not preventing the misuse of state resources.\nVoting\nPostal voting for the presidential election took place on 12 and 13 January 2010. A grace period was granted until noon on 26 January for postal voters.  Applications for this form of absentee voting totalled 458,154, with 401,118 applications accepted by the Elections Department. More than 80% of postal voters cast their votes on 12 and 13 January, this period ending with \"no major incidents\" according to the National Polls Observation Centre and the People's Action for Free and Fair Election (PAFFREL).\nVoting for the presidential election began at 7:00&nbsp;am on 26 January 2010. A total of 11,098 election centres and 888 counting centres were set up throughout the country. The Elections Commissioner had requested that voters cast their ballots early in the day.\nRajapaksa voted in the morning at Medamulana, as did opposition leader Ranil Wickremesinghe in Colombo. Candidate Fonseka did not vote, claiming that he had not been allowed to do so despite his eligibility. The government later challenged this, stating that if he were not qualified to vote, he would \"not (be) entitled to become elected\". It announced that legal action would be sought against his candidacy, although the election commissioner had ruled that he was eligible to run in the election. By the time voting ended at 4.00&nbsp;pm, over 70% of eligible voters had turned out, though in the Northern and Eastern provinces, figures were less than 20%. Sri Lanka's stock market recorded an all-time high on election day; the Colombo Stock Exchange jumped 1.58%, putting it up 131% since the end of the war.\nResults\nFinal turnout was 74.5%, with 10,495,451 voting out of the 14,088,500 voters registered. Of these, 10,393,613 were ruled valid votes, with 101,838 rejected. According to the end result, Rajapaksa was elected to a second term of office with 6,015,934 votes, or 57.88% of the vote. Fonseka finished second with 4,173,185 votes, or 40.15%. Fonseka announced that he did not accept the results, and that legal action would be taken. Supporters of Rajapaksa took to the streets on the announcement of the result, waving national flags and lighting firecrackers. Rajapaksa called his victory \"a choice of the people\" and that he was then President of everyone in the country.\nDistrict results\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Districts won by Rajapaksa\n|-\n|Districts won by Fonseka\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ Summary of the 2010 Sri Lankan presidential election by electoral district\n|-\n!rowspan=3|District\n!rowspan=3|Province\n!colspan=2|Rajapaksa\n!colspan=2|Fonseka\n!colspan=2|Others\n!rowspan=3|Turnout\n|-\n! colspan=2 style=\"background:\"| !! colspan=2 style=\"background:\"|  !! colspan=2|\n|-\n!

State-owned news media all but shut out opposition candidates. Election commissioner Dayananda Dissanayake said the state media violated his guidelines, government institutions misbehaved, and he asked for approval to resign: \"I request to be released,\" he said, just after he announced the results.\nPost-election events\nOn the morning of 27 January, the Sri Lankan military surrounded a hotel where Fonseka and a number of opposition politicians had convened. The military claimed that 400 armed army deserters had gathered there, and demanded their surrender. Fonseka accused the military of preparing to arrest him if he won the elections. However, according to a military spokesman, they were there merely as a preventive measure, as the purpose of the gathering was uncertain. The military later arrested 10 men, who the opposition claimed were members of Fonseka's security contingent and not army deserters.\nPlot to assassinate Rajapaska and government officers\nAt a press briefing held on Thursday, 28 January, the Director of the Media Centre for National Security, Lakshman Hulugalle, told reporters that Gen. Fonseka moved into the hotel with over 70 retired army officers and deserters to plot the assassination of victorious President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his family. The Sri Lankan Ministry of Defence reported that they were still looking for evidence to prove Mr. Fonseka's involvement.\nPresidential Inauguration\nThe 3rd Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka stated that if a President was re-elected for a second term via an Early Presidential election, his second term starts on the next date corresponding to the date of the beginning of his first term. As such, Mahinda Rajapaksha was inaugurated for a second term of office at a Ceremony held on the footsteps of the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo, on 19 November 2010. His oath of office was administered by Chief Justice Asoka de Silva.\nInternational reaction\n* – President Pratibha Patil and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Wednesday congratulated Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa on his re-election and expressed confidence that the country would find lasting peace in which all communities would live with dignity and harmony. President Patil said, \"I am confident that under your continued leadership, Sri Lanka will attain greater heights and find lasting peace.\" Prime Minister Singh said Rajapaksa's electoral success \"is a reflection of the trust\" the people of Sri Lanka had placed in him.\n* Palestinian Popular Struggle Front – The Front sent a letter in support of President Rajapaksa. \"On behalf of the Palestinians in and out of Palestine, (we) express (our) grateful thanks to President Mahinda Rajapasksa, who has been fighting for the Palestinians during the last 40 years.\"\n* – UN chief Ban Ki-moon on Wednesday voiced relief that Sri Lanka's presidential polls went off relatively peacefully, and urged the country's political parties to abide by the official results.
