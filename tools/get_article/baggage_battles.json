It has received 7.4/10 ratings on TV.com and has received 2.3/10 ratings on TVGuide.co.uk. AV Club found it derivative of Storage Wars, but more positively said that the travel angle did add some local color and occasionally it did surprise with what the participants found.\nInternational distribution\n*: On Travel Channel Albania HD\n*: On A&E Australia and 7mate\n*: On Travel & Living Channel\n* : On Travel Channel Bulgaria and Discovery Channel Bulgaria\n*: OLN, DTour, CMT Canada\n*: On Discovery Channel Croatia\n*: On Discovery Channel France\n*: On DMAX Germany and TLC Germany\n*: On Lifetime (South East Asia), under the name \"行李大戰(Baggage Wars)\"\n*: On History TV18\n*: On DMAX Italia and Fine Living, under the name Affari in valigia\n*: on Travel Channel Ireland and Discovery Channel Ireland\n*: On Travel Channel HD (Asia), under the name \"行李戰爭(Baggage Wars)\"\n*: On Lifetime Channel\n*: On Discovery Channel Malta and Travel Channel Malta\n*: On Discovery Channel Norway\n*: On Discovery Channel Poland, under the name Walka o Bagaż.\n*: On Travel Channel Serbia\n*: On Discovery Channel Spain under the name \"Perdido, Vendido\"\n*: On Discovery Channel Sweden\n*: On SRF zwei\n*: On Discovery Channel Netherlands\n*: On Travel Channel UK and Discovery Channel UK\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
