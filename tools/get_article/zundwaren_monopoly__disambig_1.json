The only brands the Deutsche Zündwaren-Monopolgesellschaft could distribute were Welthölzer (\"World Matches\") and Haushaltsware (\"Household article\"). Local German manufacturers obtained licenses to produce preassigned volumes to sell domestically and were not allowed to export these matches or to establish new firms.\nThe official monopoly had been acquired by Swedish entrepreneur Ivar Kreuger, the \"Match King\", which made him a very rich man and remained in effect after the conclusion of World War II and through to 1983.  In 1930 the Weimar Republic struggled to deal with war reparations as determined by the  Treaty of Versailles while it also tried to tackle the Great Depression. Ivar Kreuger mediated German-French reparation talks and provided Germany with a loan of 125 million Dollars  (at that time 500 million  Reichsmark). The bonds ran until 15. January 1983 at which time the monopoly arrangement ended. After that, the price for safety matches in Germany fell by a third.\nEast Germany (1949-1990) did not recognize the effects of the Zündwaren monopoly, no payments were made.\nGallery\nImage:Safety matches Haushaltsware Eagle.jpg|Haushaltsware 3 Pfennig until 1945\nImage:Safety matches Haushaltsware Öl-Lämpchen.jpg|Haushaltsware 1945–1952\nImage:Safety matches Haushaltsware Frau.jpg|Haushaltsware 1952–1956\nImage:Haushaltsware 5Pf Schachtel.jpg|Haushaltsware 5 Pfennig since 1956\nImage:Haushaltsware 7Pf Schachtel.jpg|Haushaltsware 7 Pfennig until 1980\nImage:Deutsche Bundesbahn Sicherheitszündhölzer Etikett.jpg|Unsellable matchbox for employees of the \"Deutsche Bundesbahn\" (German Federal Railway)\nImage:Safety matches Welt-Hölzer.jpg|Welthölzer\nImage:Safety matches Welt-Hölzer Flachhölzer.jpg|Welthölzer rectangular cross section\nFile:003 Welthölzer anagoria.JPG\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://einestages.spiegel.de/s/tb/28687/streichholzkoenig-ivar-kreuger.html Empire from matches] Spiegel Online"
