The band has sold more than 170 million albums worldwide and has won 22 Grammy Awards, more than any other band.\nU2 formed in 1976 when the members were teenagers with limited musical proficiency. By the mid-1980s, however, the band had become a top international act, noted for its anthemic sound, Bono's impassioned vocals, and The Edge's textural guitar playing. Their success as a live act was greater than their success as a record-selling act until their 1987 album, The Joshua Tree, which brought them mega-stardom.\nAcademy Awards\nThe Academy Awards is an annual American awards ceremony hosted by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to recognize excellence in cinematic achievements in the United States film industry as assessed by the academy's voting membership.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
