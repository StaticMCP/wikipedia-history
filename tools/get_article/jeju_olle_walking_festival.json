      "text": "# Jeju Olle Walking Festival\n\nThe Jeju Olle Walking Festival () is an annual walking trail event held along the Jeju Olle Trail of Jeju Island, South Korea. The festival began in 2010 and is organized by the Jeju Olle Foundation and local government offices. Each iteration highlights three different trails out of the 27 available, allowing local residents, hikers, and international visitors to appreciate the island's environment during its mild autumn weather.\nThe festival showcases the local cuisine and culture of a particular area with events and performances hosted by area residents. It generally attracts around 10,000 participants from all over Korea and overseas who hike one route per day.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic it was scaled back in 2020 and 2021 to encourage individual hikes rather than group hikes (under the slogan \"We Walk: Apart Together\"). In 2022, it was canceled, along with many other events nationwide, in the immediate aftermath of the Seoul Halloween crowd crush.\nThe 2025 iteration of the festival was held from Thursday, November 6 to Saturday, November 8, organized around Route 17 on Day 1 (Forward Olle, 11.9&nbsp;km), Route 17-18 on Day 2 (Forward Olle, 16.3&nbsp;km), and Route 18 on Day 3 (Reverse Olle, 11.3&nbsp;km).\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.jejuolle.org/trail_en Jeju Olle Trail main page]\n* [https://contents.ollepass.org/static/festival_view/2025/01/eng/index.html?name=festival&access=app&seq=86 Jeju Olle Walking Festival main page]"
