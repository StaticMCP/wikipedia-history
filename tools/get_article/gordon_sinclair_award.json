Originally presented as part of the ACTRA Awards, it was transferred to the new Gemini Awards in 1986. During the ACTRA era, the award was open to both radio and television journalists; when it was taken over by the Academy, it became a television-only award.\nIn the late 1990s, the award transitioned from a competitive award with a shortlist of nominees, which was presented to honour journalism work within the past year, into a lifetime achievement award whose winner was announced in advance of the annual award ceremony.\nSince 2013, it has been presented as part of the Canadian Screen Awards.\nThe award is named in honour of television and radio commentator Gordon Sinclair.\nWinners\nACTRA\n*1972 - Pierre Berton\n*1973 - Max Ferguson\n*1975 - Jack Webster\n*1976 - Warner Troyer and Adrienne Clarkson\n*1977 - Judy LaMarsh\n*1978 - Linden MacIntyre\n*1979 - Barbara Frum\n*1980 - Ricki Katz and Susan Millican\n*1981 - Eric Malling\n*1982 - Stephen Lewis\n*1983 - Laurier LaPierre\n*1984 - Elizabeth Gray\n*1985 - Eric Malling and Hana Gartner\n*1986 - Roy Bonisteel\nGemini\n*1986 - Jim Reed and Eric Malling\n*1987 - Joe Schlesinger\n*1988 - no award presented\n*1989 - Patrick Watson\n*1990 - Peter Mansbridge\n*1991 - Pamela Wallin\n*1992 - Linden MacIntyre\n*1993 - Craig Oliver\n*1994 - Linden MacIntyre\n*1995 - Brian Stewart\n*1996 - Victor Malarek\n*1997 - Linden MacIntyre\n*1998 - Peter Mansbridge\n*1999 - David Studer\n*2000 - Ron Haggart\n*2001 - Bill Cunningham\n*2002 - Dennis McIntosh\n*2003 - Brian McKenna\n*2004 - Neil Docherty\n*2005 - David Halton\n*2006 - Hana Gartner\n*2007 - Tony Burman\n*2008 - Don Newman\n*2009 - no award presented\n*2010 - no award presented\n*2011 - Lloyd Robertson\n*2012 - Laurier LaPierre\nCanadian Screen\n*2013 - W5\n*2014 - Ric Esther Bienstock\n*2015 - Mark Starowicz\n*2016 - Simcha Jacobovici\n*2017 - Karyn Pugliese\n*2018 - no recipient\n*2019 - no recipient\n*2020 - Anton Koschany\n*2021 - no recipient\n*2022 - Rassi Nashalik\n*2023 - Lisa LaFlamme\n*2024 - Paul Workman\nReferences"
