Mrikandu Munivar (father of Markandeya) and a deer are said to have worshipped Shiva under a mango tree, and this legend is illustrated in stucco in the temple. Brahma, the Hindu god of creation, is said to have brought the Gayatri Nadi at the completion of his worship here, and his act of having made the false claim of having seen the top of the column of fire in which Shiva had manifested himself, was absolved here. It is believed that sage Mrikandeeswara is believed to have performed penance at this temple and hence it is also called Mrikandeswarapura.\nIndra, the king of celestial deities, is said to have worshipped Shiva to absolve himself of the sin of having deceived Ahalya, the wife of Gowtama Rishi.
