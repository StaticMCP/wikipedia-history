      "text": "# Heritage Malta\n\nHeritage Malta () is the Maltese national agency for museums, conservation practice and cultural heritage. Created by the Cultural Heritage Act, enacted in 2002, the national agency (along with the Superintendence for Cultural Heritage) replaced the former Museums Department.\nOriginally Heritage Malta was entrusted with the management of museums, sites and their collections but in 2005, the agency was also charged with the take over of the former Malta Centre for Restoration to become the national agency responsible for conservation.\nAs the national agency responsible for museums, cultural heritage and conservation, Heritage Malta is governed by a board of directors appointed by the minister. The board is headed by a chairman and is usually appointed for successive three-year terms.\nLogo\nUntil 2022, the logo of Heritage Malta consisted of a white uppercase Ħ on a red square. The H with stroke is a letter found only in the Maltese alphabet. In 2022, Heritage Malta changed its logo to a stylized lowercase \"M\" featuring a standard letter \"H\" in the middle, which was designed by the company BRND WGN. This new logo was noted for its similarity to that of the Hunter Museum of American Art.\nSites protected by Heritage Malta\nThe following archaeological sites and historical buildings and structures are under the management of Heritage Malta. All Maltese megalithic temples listed below are inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Site !! Type !!
