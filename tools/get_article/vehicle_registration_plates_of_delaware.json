Registrants provided their own license plates for display until 1909, when the state began to issue plates. Beginning in 1910, plates were issued in sequential order from the number 1 upwards.\n, plates are issued by the Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) through its Division of Motor Vehicles. Only rear plates have been required on standard passenger vehicles since 1945. All plates issued since 1942 can still be used with current stickers. Authorized reproductions of porcelain enamel plates can be obtained through a private vendor, provided they fall within the state's guidelines.\nIn 1956, the United States, Canada, and Mexico came to an agreement with the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators, the Automobile Manufacturers Association and the National Safety Council that standardized the size for license plates for vehicles (except those for motorcycles) at  in height by  in width, with standardized mounting holes. The first Delaware license plate that complied with these standards was issued in 1958.\nDelaware allows plate-owners to transfer the rights to display a particular number on their vehicle. The inherent scarcity of low-digit plates has spawned a vibrant secondary market for low numbers.\nSecondary market\nIn Delaware, plate number 1 is reserved for the governor, 2 for the lieutenant governor, and 3 for the secretary of state. But all other numbers 4 and higher are allowed to be traded. Additionally, plates up to 87,000 are allowed to display replica porcelain enamel plates. These factors have caused low plate-numbers to become positional goods and status symbols.\nMarketplaces have been created to facilitate exchanges. , one such market, Low Digit Plates, has priced five-digit plates in the low-thousands of dollars, and three-digit plates approaching $70,000. Single-digit plates are particularly valuable. Plate number 9 was traded for $185,000 in 1994 (). In 2008, number 6 went for $675,000 ($ in ).\nPassenger baseplates\nThis is a list of the plate templates used by Delaware.\n1909 to 1942\nNo slogans were used on passenger plates during the period covered by this subsection.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Image\n!First issued\n!Design\n!Serial format\n!style=\"width:95px;\"|Serials issued\n!Notes\n|-\n|\n|1909\n|White on black porcelain; \"DEL. 1909\" at top\n|1234\n|1001 to approximately 1500\n|Serials followed on from those on pre-state-issued plates.\n|-\n|\n|1910\n|Black on white porcelain; \"DEL. 1910\" at top\n|123\n|1 to approximately 900\n|\n|-\n|\n|1911\n|White on dark blue porcelain; \"DEL. 1911\" at top\n|1234\n|1 to approximately 1300\n|\n|-\n|\n|1912\n|White on maroon porcelain; \"DEL. 1912\" at top\n|1234\n|1 to approximately 1800\n|\n|-\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1913\n|White on black porcelain; vertical \"DEL\" and \"1913\" at left and right respectively\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1234\n|1 to approximately 2000\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n|\n|As above, but with \"DEL 13\" at right\n|2001 to approximately 2500\n|-\n|\n|1914\n|Yellow on black porcelain; \"DEL 14\" at right\n|1234\n|1 to approximately 3200\n|\n|-\n|\n|1915\n|Blue on white porcelain; \"DEL 15\" at right\n|1234\n|1 to approximately 4700\n|\n|-\n|\n|1916\n|White on dark green; \"DEL 16\" at right\n|1234\n|1 to approximately 7000\n|\n|-\n|\n|1917\n|White on black; \"DEL 17\" at right\n|1234\n|1 to approximately 10700\n|\n|-\n|\n|1918\n|White on brown; \"DEL 18\" at right\n|12345\n|1 to approximately 13000\n|\n|-\n|\n|1919\n|White on dark blue with border line; \"DEL 19\" at right\n|12345\n|1 to approximately 13100\n|\n|-\n|\n|1920\n|Black on light green with border line; \"DEL 20\" at right\n|12345\n|1 to approximately 18100\n|\n|-\n|\n|1921\n|Red on white with border line; \"DEL 21\" at right\n|12345\n|1 to approximately 20800\n|\n|-\n|\n|1922\n|Blue on white with border line; \"DEL 22\" at right\n|12-345\n|1 to approximately23-300\n|\n|-\n|\n|1923\n|White on black with border line; \"DEL 23\" at right\n|12-345\n|1 to approximately25-000\n|\n|-\n|\n|1924\n|Brown on white with border line; \"DEL 24\" at right\n|12-345\n|1 to 20-000;30-001 to approximately39-000\n|Serials 20-001 through 30-000 reserved for commercial vehicles.\n|-\n|\n|1925\n|Black on orange with border line; \"DEL 25\" at right\n|12-345\n|1 to 30-000;45-001 to approximately48-000\n|Serials 30-001 through 45-000 reserved for commercial vehicles and tractor units.\n|-\n|\n|1926\n|Yellow on blue with border line; \"DEL 26\" at right\n|12-345\n|1 to approximately37-000\n|\n|-\n|\n|1927\n|Red on gray with border line; \"DEL 27\" at right\n|12-345\n|1 to approximately40-000\n|\n|-\n|\n|1928\n|Black on white with border line; \"DEL 28\" at right\n|12-345\n|1 to approximately50-000\n|\n|-\n|\n|1929\n|Blue on golden yellow with border line; diamond at left and \"DEL 29\" at right\n|12-345\n|1 to approximately47-000\n|\n|-\n|\n|1930\n|Golden yellow on blue with border line; diamond at left and \"DEL 30\" at right\n|12-345\n|1 to approximately45-000\n|\n|-\n|\n|1931\n|As 1929 base, but with \"DEL 31\" at right\n|12-345\n|1 to approximately48-000\n|\n|-\n|\n|1932\n|As 1930 base, but with \"DEL '32\" at right\n|12-345\n|1 to approximately47-000\n|\n|-\n|\n|1933\n|As 1929 base, but with \"DEL '33\" at right\n|12-345\n|1 to approximately48-000\n|\n|-\n|\n|1934\n|As 1930 base, but with \"DEL '34\" at right\n|12-345\n|1 to approximately47-000\n|\n|-\n|\n|1935\n|As 1929 base, but with \"DEL '35\" at right\n|12-345\n|1 to approximately48-000\n|\n|-\n|\n|1936\n|Golden yellow on blue with border line; \"DELAWARE – 36\" at bottom\n|12♦345\n|1 to approximately 51♦000\n|First use of the full state name.\n|-\n|\n|1937\n|Blue on golden yellow with border line; \"DELAWARE – 37\" at bottom\n|12♦345\n|1 to approximately 53♦000\n|\n|-\n|\n|1938\n|Red on silver with border line; \"DELAWARE – 38\" at bottom\n|12♦345\n|1 to approximately 55♦000\n|\n|-\n|\n|1939\n|Silver on maroon with border line; \"DELAWARE – 39\" at bottom\n|12♦345\n|1 to approximately 58♦000\n|\n|-\n|\n|1940\n|Blue on golden yellow; \"DEL.
