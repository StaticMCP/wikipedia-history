The committee recognized his efforts in \"the struggle of the liberation of Tibet and the efforts for a peaceful resolution instead of using violence.\" The chairman of the Nobel committee said that the award was \"in part a tribute to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi.\"\nIn his acceptance speech the Dalai Lama criticised China for using force against student protesters during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. He said the victims' efforts were not in vain. His speech focused on the importance of the continued use of non-violence and his desire to maintain a dialogue with China to try to resolve the situation.\nReferences"
