The parish of Bocking was abolished in 1934, merging with Braintree to become the urban district of Braintree and Bocking, which was in turn abolished in 1974 to become part of Braintree District. Both parts of Bocking now form part of the Braintree built up area.\nBocking forms an electoral division for Essex County Council elections, and gives its name to Bocking Blackwater, Bocking North and Bocking South wards of Braintree District Council.\nHistory\nIn 1290 on 16 September, Bocking was visited by the Archbishop of Canterbury, John of Peckham, who there ordained to the priesthood William of Louth, bishop-elect of Ely.\nIn 1381, on 4 June, Bocking was the site of the first sit-down discussions between rebels leading to the full Peasants' Revolt, and the subsequent march towards London.\nThe Deanery Church of St Mary, Bocking, is mainly 15th- and 16th-century flint and limestone, with 19th-century restoration, built on a more ancient church site. It is Grade I listed. St Peter's Parish Church was built in 1896-97 of yellow brick, in a design intended to be extended at a later date, and is still unfinished; its website describes it as \"unusual in appearance from the outside\".\nBocking Windmill is a preserved 18th-century post mill and is Grade I listed. It is owned by Braintree District Council and run by the Friends of Bocking Windmill.\nIn 1862 ''Kelly's Directory of Essex already stated that \"Braintree and Bocking, although distinct parishes, form one continuous town, extending for a mile on the road between Chelmsford and Halstead, and the rivers Blackwater and Podsbrook, and having a united population in 1861 of 8,186.\"\nBocking was an ancient parish. The parish was abolished in 1934, when most of its area (including the old village of Bocking) merging with the adjoining urban district of Braintree, with the new urban district being called Braintree and Bocking. Smaller parts of the old parish were transferred instead to the neighbouring parishes of Gosfield and Stisted. At the 1931 census (the last before the abolition of the civil parish), Bocking had a population of 4,274. Braintree and Bocking Urban District was abolished in 1974, becoming part of the wider Braintree District. No successor parish was created for the former urban district and so Bocking is directly administered by Braintree District Council.\nEducation\nBocking has one school called Bocking Church Street School. It used to have another school called Edith Borthwick School but that moved to Springwood Drive in Braintree in September 2015 because its old school in Bocking was too small.\nBocking in 1870-72\nThe Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales gave the following description of Bocking in 1870-1872:\nH. G. Wells on Bocking\nH. G. Wells, in his What Is Coming? A European Forecast (1916), in the fourth chapter, \"Braintree, Bocking, and the Future of the World,\" uses the differences between Bocking and Braintree, divided, he says, by a single road, to explain the difficulties he expects in establishing World Peace through a World State.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*Hoffman, Ann Bocking Deanery: The Story of an Essex Peculiar (Phillimore, 1976 )\nPublished histories of Braintree & Bocking include:\n*May Cunnington & Stephen Warner Braintree & Bocking (Arnold Fairbairns, 1906)\n*W.
