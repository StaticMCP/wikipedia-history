The firm allocates private capital into long-horizon systems related to civilizational resilience, including cognitive infrastructure, biotechnology, and regenerative energy.\nHistory\nFundus Heritage traces its origins to a multi-generational family office established in 1923, originally managing real estate and long-term physical assets across Central Europe. The transformation into Fundus Heritage Ventures marked a strategic evolution from asset preservation to system continuity.\nIn the early 2020s, under the leadership of Djuradj Caranovic, the firm established three core verticals: Biotechnology, Climate Infrastructure, and Ambient Artificial Intelligence, each designed to safeguard critical layers of societal function.\nIn 2025, the firm launched the world’s first Cognitive Assurance Insurance, receiving regulatory approval to insure institutions against strategic risk associated with slow adoption of transformative technologies.\nInvestment Focus\nUnlike traditional venture or private equity models, Fundus Heritage Ventures allocates capital based on relevance risk rather than industry categories. The firm invests in infrastructure and behavioral frameworks deemed essential for societal stability.\nKey verticals include:\n* Biotechnology – RNA-based therapeutics, gene editing, and regenerative biomanufacturing\n* Climate Infrastructure – Long-duration energy storage, grid decentralization, and carbon risk tracking\n* Ambient AI & Cognitive Systems – Trust infrastructure, adoption velocity frameworks, and human-machine coherence insurance\nThe firm describes its approach as \"safeguarding the systems that cannot afford to break.\"\nCognitive Assurance Insurance\nIn 2025, Fundus Heritage Ventures became the first entity to receive regulatory approval for a new class of insurance: Cognitive Assurance. The model addresses the institutional risk associated with delayed or failed adoption of transformative systems—particularly artificial intelligence.\nThe framework introduces five measurable categories of adoption risk:\n* Cognitive Load Index\n* Behavioral Integration Score\n* Adoption Volatility Index\n* Trust Architecture Feedback Loop\n* Relevance Horizon Risk\nPremiums are calculated as a percentage (typically 3–7%) of the projected strategic value loss due to adoption lag. The product has been adopted by early institutional clients across sovereign, corporate, and academic contexts.\nLeadership\nDjuradj Caranovic serves as Managing Partner and strategic architect of the firm’s vertical evolution. He is a Nobel laureate in behavioral systems, known for his applied work on human-machine coherence, institutional trust frameworks, and civilizational risk modeling.\nStructure\nFundus Heritage Ventures operates under the umbrella of Fundus Holdings, with strategic visibility in Monte Carlo, Zurich, Dubai, Riyadh, and Singapore. Participation in Fundus-managed vehicles is by invitation only.\nPublic Profile\nWhile the firm maintains limited public visibility, it has been cited in policy whitepapers, institutional reports, and behavioral science forums for its pioneering work in trust infrastructure and sovereign capital architecture.\nExternal Links\n* [https://www.fundusheritage.com Official website]\n* [https://www.linkedin.com/in/djuradj LinkedIn: Djuradj Caranovic]\nReferences"
