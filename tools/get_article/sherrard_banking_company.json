David Sherrard had the bank built in 1896, two years after he founded the village. The two-story brick building has a Late Victorian commercial design. The main entrance is at the front corner of the building; a pyramidal tower projects from the steep roof above the entrance. The building's decorations includes an arched entrance and stone window sills and lintels; its relative lack of ornamentation signifies the shift away from the elaborate features widely used earlier in the Victorian period. The first floor of the building was used for the bank, while the second held private professional offices, a common configuration at the time.\nThe bank was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 16, 1996.\nReferences"
