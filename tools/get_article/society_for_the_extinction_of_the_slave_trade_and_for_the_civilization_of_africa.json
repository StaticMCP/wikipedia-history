Fowell Buxton was the principal person behind its establishment. Slavery had been abolished in 1833 throughout the British Empire.\nObjects\nThe objects of the society were:\n# \"To make the Africans acquainted with the inexhaustible riches of their own soil, and sedulously to direct their attention to its cultivation on a system of free labour. To convince them, moreover, of the immeasurable superiority of agriculture and innocent commerce, even in point of profit, over the Slave Trade which excludes them.\"\n# \"To instruct the natives in Agriculture and practical Science; to cultivate small portions of land as models for their imitation; distribute agricultural implements, seeds, plants, &c.; introduce local and other improvements; and suggest and facilitate the means of beneficially exchanging the produce of Africa for the manufactures of Europe.\"\n# \"To examine the principal languages of Africa, and reduce them where advisable to a written form.\"\n# \"To investigate the diseases, climate, and local peculiarities of Africa, for the benefit as well of natives, as of foreign residents and travellers; to send out medicines and practitioners; and thus to separate the practice of Medicine from the horrid superstitions now connected with it.\"\n# \"To co-operate by every means in its power with the Government Expedition to the Niger; to report its progress—assist its operations—circulate the valuable information it may communicate; and, generally, to keep alive the interest of Great Britain in the suppression of the Slave Trade, and the welfare of Africa.\"\nSee also\n*History of slavery#African participation in the slave trade\n*Abolitionism in the United Kingdom\nReferences"
