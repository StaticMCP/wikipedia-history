We’re a bit like original Gaelic-speakers, a dying breed.\n“There may be arguments for and against landscape painting, and for or against conceptual Charles Saatchi art, I'm just not interested in the arguments, not in the least. I love Scottish landscape painting and I want to see it live on. Unmade beds and bananas on a windowsill? I just don’t get it.”\nSee also\n* List of European art awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110103202841/http://www.jolomofoundation.org/past.html Past Award winners]"
