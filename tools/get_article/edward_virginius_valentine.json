In September 1859, he sailed to Europe. He studied in Paris with Thomas Couture and François Jouffroy, in Florence, Italy, under Bonanti, and with August Kiss in Berlin. He received a Doctor of Laws from Washington and Lee University.\nCareer\nIn 1865, Valentine returned to Richmond and opened a studio.\nHe briefly headed the Valentine Richmond History Center, which was founded by his brother, Mann S. Valentine Jr. The Wickham-Valentine House, part of the Valentine Museum in Richmond is on the National Register of Historic Places and was named for him and his brother.\nPersonal life\nValentine married Alice Churchill Robinson on November 12, 1872.
