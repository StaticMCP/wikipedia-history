These Intensives typically happen three times a year. Some students go backpacking for PE credit, while others get elective credit doing beekeeping, cooking, skateboard making, and many other choices, along with active service projects in the community throughout the year.\nAfter the 2022-2023 School Year, Joe Gawronski, the founding principal of Polaris retired, and the position moved to the previous Vice Principal, Starr Hill.\nReferences"
