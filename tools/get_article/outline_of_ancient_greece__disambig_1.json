It was a system of direct democracy, in which eligible citizens voted directly on legislation and executive bills.\n*** Solon (c. 638 – c. 558 BC)– Athenian statesman, lawmaker, and poet. Legislated against political, economic, and moral decline in archaic Athens. His reforms failed in the short term, yet he is often credited with having laid the foundations for Athenian democracy.\n*** Cleisthenes (born around 570 BC). – father of Athenian democracy. He reformed the constitution of ancient Athens and set it on a democratic footing in 508/7 BC.\n*** Ephialtes (died 461 BC) – led the democratic revolution against the Athenian aristocracy, which exerted control through the Areopagus, the most powerful body in the state. Ephialtes proposed a reduction of the Areopagus' powers, and the Ecclesia (the Athenian Assembly) adopted Ephialtes' proposal without opposition. This reform signaled the beginning of a new era of \"radical democracy\" for which Athens would become famous.\n*** Pericles – arguably the most prominent and influential Greek statesman. When Ephialtes was assassinated for overthrowing the elitist Council of the Aeropagus, his deputy Pericles stepped in. He was elected strategos (one of ten such posts) in 445 BCE, which he held continuously until his death in 429 BCE, always by election of the Athenian Assembly. The period during which he led Athens, roughly from 461 to 429 BC, is known as the \"Age of Pericles\".\n*** Ostracism – procedure under the Athenian democracy in which any citizen could be expelled from the city-state of Athens for ten years.\n*** Areopagus – council of elders of Athens, similar to the Roman Senate. Like the Senate, its membership was restricted to those who had held high public office, in this case that of Archon. In 594 BC, the Areopagus agreed to hand over its functions to Solon for reform.\n*** Ecclesia – principal assembly of the democracy of ancient Athens during its \"Golden Age\" (480–404 BCE). It was the popular assembly, open to all male citizens with 2 years of military service. In 594 BC, Solon allowed all Athenian citizens to participate, regardless of class, even the thetes (manual laborers).\n* History of Sparta\n* History of Macedonia (ancient kingdom)\n* History of Crete#Iron Age and Archaic Crete\n* Asia Minor#Greek West\n* History of Greek and Hellenistic Sicily\n* Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul\n** History of Marseille#Antiquity\n* Cyrenaica#Greek rule\n* Bosporan Kingdom\n* Ptolemaic Kingdom\n** Cyrenaica#Resumption of Greek rule\n* Coele-Syria\n* Seleucid Empire\n** Tylos\n* Greco-Bactrian Kingdom\n* Indo-Greek Kingdom\nAncient Greek History, by subject\n* History of the Greek alphabet\n* Names of the Greeks\nAncient Greek historiography\nWorks on ancient Greek history\n* History of the Peloponnesian War\nCulture of ancient Greece\n]]\n, the most common drinking vessel in ancient Greece]]\n, shows the common structural features of Ancient Greek architecture: crepidoma, columns, entablature, and pediment]]\n]]\n]]\n, statesman and orator of ancient Athens]]\nCulture of ancient Greece\n* Ancient Greek calendars\n**Attic calendar\n* Clothing in ancient Greece\n** Chiton\n** Chlamys\n** Exomis\n** Himation\n** Kolpos\n** Peplos\n** Tainia\n** Zone\n** Zoster\n* Clubs in ancient Greece\n* Coinage of ancient Greece\n* Cuisine of ancient Greece\n** Kykeon\n** Wine in ancient Greece\n***Symposium\n****Kottabos\n***Syssitia\n* Education in ancient Greece\n** Paideia\n* Fiction set in ancient Greece\n* Greek gardens\n* Marriage in ancient Greece\n* People in ancient Greece\n** Ancient Greeks\n*** Seven Sages of Greece\n**** Cleobulus of Lindos\n**** Solon of Athens\n**** Chilon of Sparta\n**** Bias of Priene\n**** Thales of Miletus\n**** Pittacus of Mytilene (c. 640 – 568 BC)\n**** Periander of Corinth (fl. 627 BC)\n*** Ancient Greek tribes\n** Ancient Greek personal names\n* Sexuality in ancient Greece\n**Adultery in Classical Athens\n** Homosexuality in ancient Greece\n***Homosexuality in the militaries of ancient Greece\n** Pederasty in ancient Greece\n***Athenian pederasty\n** Prostitution in ancient Greece\n* Slavery in ancient Greece\n* Women in Classical Athens\nArchitecture of ancient Greece\nArchitecture of ancient Greece\n* Acropolis\n** Acropolis of Athens\n* Agora\n** Ancient Agora of Athens\n* Ancient Greek baths\n**Greek baths of Gela\n**Greek Baths in ancient Olympia\n* Delphinion\n* Metroon\n* Odeon\n**Odeon of Athens\n**Odeon of Herodes Atticus\n* Propylaea\n* Ancient Greek roofs\n* Stoa\n**Ancient Greek stoae\n***Stoa of Attalos\n* Ancient Greek temple\n** Ancient Greek temples\n*** Parthenon\n*** Temple of Artemis\n*** Temple of Zeus\n*** Temple of Hephaestus\n*** Samothrace temple complex\n* Ancient Greek walls\nArt in ancient Greece\n(detail), bronze statue from the 2nd or 1st century BC]]\nkylix, ca. 530 BC]]\nred-figure kylix depicting Herakles and Athena, by Phoinix (potter) and Douris (painter),  ca. 480–470 BC]]\n, author of the Iliad and the Odyssey, two epic poems which are the central works of ancient Greek literature]]\nArt in ancient Greece\n* Death in ancient Greek art\n* Music of ancient Greece\n**Musical system of ancient Greece\n***Ancient Greek Musical Notation\n**Seikilos epitaph\n* Painting in ancient Greece\n* Pottery of ancient Greece\n**Ancient Greek vase painting\n***Bilingual vase painting\n***Black-figure pottery\n***Red-figure pottery\n***White ground technique\n**Greek terracotta figurines\n***Tanagra figurine\n**Hellenistic glass\n* Sculpture in ancient Greece\n**Severe style\n**Hellenistic art\n* Sport in ancient Greek art\n* Theatre of ancient Greece\n** Chorus of the elderly in classical Greek drama\n** Greek comedy\n***Old Comedy\n** Greek tragedy\n** Greek chorus\n** Satyr play\n** List of ancient Greek playwrights\n** List of ancient Greek theatres\n** Phlyax play\n** Representation of women in Athenian tragedy\n** Use of costume in Athenian tragedy\n* Warfare in ancient Greek art\nLiterature in ancient Greece\nLiterature in ancient Greece\n* Greek lyric\n* Greek novel\n* Writers\n** Aeschylus\n** Aesop\n** Aristophanes\n** Euripides\n** Herodotus\n** Hesiod\n** Homer\n** Lucian\n** Menander\n** Pindar\n** Plutarch\n** Polybius\n** Sappho\n** Sophocles\n** Theognis of Megara\n** Thucydides\n** Xenophon\nPhilosophy in ancient Greece\n, a famous fresco by the Italian Renaissance artist Raphael, with Plato and Aristotle as the central figures in the scene]]\nPhilosophy in ancient Greece\nAncient Greek schools of philosophy\n*Pre-Socratic\n**Atomism\n**Eleatics\n**Ephesian school\n**Ionian School\n**Milesian school\n**Pluralist school\n**Pythagoreanism\n: ''Plato's Academy mosaic from the Villa of T.
