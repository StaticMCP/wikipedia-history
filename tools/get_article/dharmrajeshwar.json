The complex features well-preserved Hindu shrine and bears some resemblance to the rock-cut heritage sites at Ellora, Maharashtra.\nThe temple complex dates to the 8th century and initially featured a shrine dedicated to Vishnu but was later remodelled as a Shiva temple. Consequently, the sanctum sanctorum features both an icon of Harihara as well as a Shivalinga. The Mahashivaratri is the primary festival celebrated at Dharmarajeshwara.\nPicture gallery\nImage:Dharmrajeshwar5.JPG|Dharmarajeshwara temple\nImage:Dharmrajeshwar3.JPG|Shivalinga\nImage:Dharmrajeshwar2.JPG|Dharmarajeshwara temple\nImage:Dharmrajeshwar1.JPG|Dharmarajeshwara temple\nFile:Stone Wheel for Mortar making.JPG|A Stone Wheel for Mortar making at Dharmrajeshwar\nReferences"
