The ships were , , , , and , all built between 1895 and 1901. The class saw the introduction of the traditional armament layout for German battleships prior to the advent of the dreadnought type of battleship in the early 1900s: four large-caliber guns, but of comparatively smaller size compared to their contemporaries, in two gun turrets. The German adoption of smaller guns was a result of a preference for higher volumes of fire over weight of shell. The  class also standardized the use of three screws for battleships and introduced water-tube boilers and Krupp cemented armor.\nOn entering service, the ships were assigned to I&nbsp;Squadron, of which  served as the flagship, while  served as the flagship for the overall fleet commander. The ships conducted routine training exercises and cruises in the early 1900s and  was badly damaged in a grounding accident while steaming in the Baltic Sea in 1901. As newer battleships entered service later in the decade, the ships of the class were moved to II&nbsp;Squadron in 1905 and all of the ships except  were rebuilt between 1907 and 1910. Thereafter they were reduced to reserve status beginning in 1908, since more powerful dreadnought battleships had begun to be commissioned; the rest of their peacetime careers consisted of periodic reactivations to participate in annual fleet training maneuvers.\nAt the start of World War&nbsp;I in July 1914, the ships were recommissioned and assigned to V&nbsp;Squadron; they were tasked with coastal defense in the North Sea but were quickly transferred to the Baltic to support German operations against the Russian Empire. They saw limited activity during this period, and they returned to the North Sea for guard duties in early 1915. The increasing threat of modern weapons, particularly the British submarines that had begun to operate in the area, combined with shortages of crews for more valuable vessels, led the navy to decommission all five members of the class in March 1915. They were used in a variety of secondary roles. They were all discarded in the early 1920s as Germany disarmed under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles.\nDesign\nIn the early 1890s, the German Navy attempted to secure funding from the  to replace the elderly ironclad , but parliamentary resistance delayed the appropriation until the 1894/1895 budget year. Design studies for the new ship had begun in June 1891 at the request of Kaiser Wilhelm II, and it was quickly decided to make significant changes from the preceding  design. The limitations of the fleet's infrastructure, particularly the dry docks and other harbor facilities, along with the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal then under construction, constrained the size of the new ship. To keep the new ship within the displacement limit, the center turret that had been used on the s would have to be sacrificed if a heavier secondary battery was to be incorporated. Five different design sketches were prepared, the first four incorporating a secondary armament of ten  guns and eight  guns and the fifth replacing the 10.5&nbsp;cm guns with eight  guns. All five variants carried a main armament of four  guns. Wilhelm II contributed his own proposal, but it suffered from serious stability problems and was not a serious option.\nWork continued on the ships' design while the navy pushed for funding in the , which was finally approved in March 1894, placing pressure on the design staff to complete their work so construction could begin. By May, the design staff had produced sketch XVI, which discarded the traditional two-gun turret used by most navies in favor of four single-gun turrets in the lozenge arrangement used in contemporary French battleships like . If weight permitted, all four were to be 28&nbsp;cm guns, but the option to reduce the wing turrets to  was available if necessary. The secondary battery was to be sixteen of the 10.5&nbsp;cm guns, with at least some in twin turrets, but over the following months the battery was increased to 15&nbsp;cm guns, as it was the accepted view at the time that secondary guns would do the most damage in a close-range fight. This view, which advocated the so-called \"hail of fire\" principle, was seemingly vindicated by the Japanese cruisers' victory over a more heavily armed Chinese fleet at the Battle of Yalu later in 1894. The smaller, faster-firing guns were intended to inflict serious damage on the superstructures of enemy battleships and demoralize the crew.\nDuring the design process, the commander of the Maneuver Squadron, Hans von Koester, suggested that the 28&nbsp;cm guns be discarded in favor of  guns, since they could be fired 2.5&nbsp;times as fast as the larger guns and they were large enough that they could still be used to penetrate heavy armor at the close battle ranges envisioned at the time. Koester convinced Wilhelm II to overrule the naval high command, who wished to retain the heavier guns. This decision set a pattern of German naval construction for the next two decades that favored lighter, faster-firing guns instead of larger, more powerful ones. Though the decision was criticized at the time on the basis that the 24&nbsp;cm gun was smaller and thus weaker than the 28&nbsp;cm, the larger gun offered little substantive advantage at close range, and the much greater rate of fire allowed it to produce a heavier broadside over time.\nIn August 1894, the navy settled on an  ship armed with four 24&nbsp;cm guns and eighteen 15&nbsp;cm guns. The decision was a gamble, as Krupp had not actually designed a 24&nbsp;cm gun, and if the tests had proved to be a failure, the ship would not have had a main battery gun, since her turrets could not be reworked to accommodate the 28&nbsp;cm gun. The advent of Krupp cemented armor allowed a significant saving of weight, as it was much more effective than traditional Krupp armor, so less armor could be used to achieve the same level of protection. They retained the same armor layout of the s, although the weight savings would have allowed the adoption of a more comprehensive layout that would be used in the subsequent . The propulsion system was improved with the adoption of water-tube boilers and reorganized to incorporate a third propeller shaft, which became standard for German capital ships. The navy had concerns about the reliability of the water-tube Thornycroft boilers, so the first vessel, , was completed with just four of the new types, with the remaining eight being older fire-tube boilers.\nAfter the first vessel was begun, the next member of the class was authorized for the 1896/1897 program; during the intervening two years, consideration was given to re-designing the second ship to match foreign developments, most significantly the adoption of  guns like those on the British . The change would have necessitated halving the main battery and the removal of four of the 15&nbsp;cm guns to offset the weight of the larger guns. Additionally, it would have left  with no counterparts, which would have complicated tactical control. The sacrifices were deemed to be too severe, and so the decision was made to go ahead with the 24&nbsp;cm gun, as successful proof-firing of the new gun had by then been completed.\nGeneral characteristics and machinery\ns and small bridge that distinguished the last three members of the class from the first two vessels]]\nThe -class ships were  long at the waterline and  overall. They had a beam of  and a draft of  forward and  aft. The ships displaced  normally and up to  at full load. The ships' steel hulls were of transverse and longitudinal frame construction. The hull contained twelve watertight compartments and a double bottom that covered 70&nbsp;percent of the hull.  was completed with a tall military mast for her foremast and a pole mainmast. The other four vessels were fitted with short military masts for both masts. In 1901, s foremast was shortened.  and , both intended to serve as flagships, were completed with large bridges, with a two-story bridge aboard the former and a single-story bridge on the latter. The remaining three vessels received smaller, open bridges.\nThe German navy regarded them as having excellent seakeeping. They had a tight turning circle and were very responsive. The ships rolled up to 15° and had a roll period of 12 seconds. They suffered only minor speed loss in heavy seas, but up to 40&nbsp;percent with the rudder hard over. Their metacentric heights were between . The ships carried a number of smaller boats, including two picket boats, two launches, one pinnace, two cutters, two yawls, and two dinghies. The crew numbered 39&nbsp;officers and 612&nbsp;enlisted men. When serving as a squadron flagship, a ship had its crew augmented by another 12&nbsp;officers and between 51 and 63&nbsp;enlisted men.\nThe -class battleships were powered by three 3-cylinder vertical triple-expansion steam engines that drove three screws. , , and  were equipped with three 3-bladed screws that were  in diameter.  and  were equipped with two of the 3-bladed screws on the outer shafts and a four-bladed screw that was  in diameter on the center shaft. The ships received different boiler arrangements owing to concerns among the naval high command about the reliability of the new water-tube boilers.  had an arrangement similar to , except the Thornycroft boilers were replaced by Marine-type fire-tube boilers.  and  were equipped with four Marine and six cylindrical fire-tube boilers, while  had four Thornycroft and six cylindrical fire-tube boilers. All of the ships' boilers were ducted into two funnels, but  and  had thinner aft funnels while those of the other three ships were identical.\nThe powerplants were rated at , but on trials could produce up to . This generated a top speed of . The ships carried  of coal, although the use of additional spaces within the ships increased fuel capacity to . This provided a maximum range of  at a cruising speed of . Electrical power was supplied by five 320&nbsp;kW 74&nbsp;volt generators in  and , and four 240&nbsp;kW 74&nbsp;volt generators in the other three ships.\nArmament\nThe primary armament consisted of a battery of four 24&nbsp;cm (9.4&nbsp;in) SK L/40 guns in twin-gun turrets,) denotes that the gun is quick firing, while the L/40 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/40 gun is 40 caliber, meaning that the gun is 40 times as long as it is in diameter.}} one fore and one aft of the central superstructure. The guns were mounted in hydraulically operated C/98 turrets, which allowed elevation to +30&nbsp;degrees and depression to −5&nbsp;degrees. At maximum elevation, the guns could hit targets out to . The guns fired  shells at a muzzle velocity of . Each gun was supplied with 75 shells, for a total of 300.\nSecondary armament included eighteen 15&nbsp;cm (5.9&nbsp;inch) SK L/40 guns. Six were mounted in single turrets amidships and the rest were mounted in MPL casemates; all were manually operated and elevated. (Central pivot mounting).}} Most of these guns were mounted at upper-deck level, with only four of the casemates at main deck level, which kept them high enough in the ship to avoid a common problem with battleships of the period where heavy seas could make the guns unworkable. According to the historian Aidan Dodson, the arrangement was \"perhaps the best of the period.\" These guns fired armor-piercing shells at a rate of 4&nbsp;to 5 per minute. The ships carried 120 shells per gun, for a total of 2,160 rounds total. The guns could depress to −7&nbsp;degrees and elevate to +20&nbsp;degrees, for a maximum range of 13,700&nbsp;m (14,990&nbsp;yd). The shells weighed  and were fired at a muzzle velocity of .\nThe ships also carried twelve 8.8&nbsp;cm (3.45&nbsp;in) SK L/30 quick-firing guns for defense against torpedo boats, also mounted individually in casemates and pivot mounts. These guns were supplied with between 170 and 250 shells per gun. These guns fired  shell at a muzzle velocity of 590&nbsp;mps (1,936&nbsp;fps). Their rate of fire was approximately 15 shells per minute; the guns could engage targets out to . The gun mounts were manually operated. The ships' gun armament was rounded out by twelve  Maxim machine cannon.\nThe ships were also armed with six  torpedo tubes, all in above-water swivel mounts. Four tubes were mounted on the sides of the ship, another in the bow, and the last in the stern. These weapons were 5.1&nbsp;m (201&nbsp;in) long and carried an 87.5&nbsp;kg (193&nbsp;lb) TNT warhead. They could be set at two speeds for different ranges. At , the torpedoes had a range of 800&nbsp;m (870&nbsp;yd). At an increased speed of , the range was reduced to 500&nbsp;m (550&nbsp;yd).\nArmor\nThe -class ships were armored with steel produced by Krupp. They were the last German capital ships to use the old-style narrow armor belt arrangement; older compound armor required a significant amount of steel to resist large-caliber shellfire, which meant that little of the ship could be covered with armor owing to its weight. Krupp's new steel was much stronger, but the design staff did not take advantage of the reduced weight to provide more comprehensive protection, which would arrive with the subsequent  class.\nThey had an armor belt that was  thick in the central portion of the hull at the waterline. It tapered to  in the forward section and  in the rear, although the belt did not extend fully aft. The lower portion of the belt ranged in thickness from . The entire belt was backed with  of teak. The main armored deck was  thick, but the thickness was increased to  aft of the rear main battery barbette, where the stern was not protected by the belt. This portion of the deck curved down at the sides to offer a measure of protection against shell hits.\nThe conning tower was protected by armored sides that were 250&nbsp;mm thick and a roof that was  thick. Each main-battery turret had a  thick roof and 250&nbsp;mm thick sides. The 15&nbsp;cm guns mounted in turrets were protected by 150&nbsp;mm thick sides and  thick gun shields. Those in the casemates also had 150&nbsp;mm worth of armor protection.\nConstruction\nThe five ships of the  class were built by a combination of government and private shipyards. Three of the ships—, , and —were delayed during construction;  had to wait for her main guns to be completed before entering service.  was damaged by an accidental grounding by the shipyard crew when they were moving the ship from Hamburg to Wilhelmshaven, and a fire at the shipyard slowed work on .\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Construction data\n! scope=\"col\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" | Contract name\n! scope=\"col\" | Builder\n! scope=\"col\" | Namesake\n! scope=\"col\" | Laid down\n! scope=\"col\" | Launched\n! scope=\"col\" | Commissioned\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|\n|rowspan=2|Kaiserliche Werft, Wilhelmshaven\n|Kaiser Friedrich III\n|5 March 1895\n|1 July 1896\n|7 October 1898\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|\n|Kaiser Wilhelm II\n|26 October 1896\n|14 September 1897\n|13 February 1900\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|\n|Germaniawerft, Kiel\n|Kaiser Wilhelm I\n|22 January 1898\n|1 June 1899\n|5 May 1901\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|B\n|Blohm & Voss, Hamburg\n|Emperor Charlemagne\n|17 September 1898\n|18 October 1899\n|4 February 1902\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|A\n|Schichau-Werke, Danzig\n|Emperor Frederick I\n|3 August 1898\n|21 April 1900\n|10 June 1901\n|}\nService history\nPrewar careers\nof  in 1902]]\nOn entering service,  became the flagship of Prince Heinrich, the commander of I Squadron of the Home Fleet.  became the flagship of Koester, the fleet commander. The two ships operated together into early 1901 until  was badly damaged in a grounding accident while cruising in the Baltic Sea in April. An investigation revealed several uncharted rocks and faulted the lightship in the area, which was out of position. While she was out of service for repairs, her crew was transferred to , which had just been completed. Over the course of the next four years, the ships of the class operated together in I Squadron, conducting training cruises, fleet maneuvers every August and September, and visits to foreign ports.\nBy 1905, as several new classes of battleships—the , , and es—had either entered service or were approaching completion, the members of the  class began to be transferred to II Squadron. In 1906,  was replaced as the fleet flagship by the new battleship . The normal peacetime training routine continued for the next several years, interrupted by a reconstruction program in the mid to late-1900s.  was the first to be rebuilt in 1905, a result of having been decommissioned for repairs to her rudder for damage incurred on a cruise to Spain in 1903.  was rebuilt in 1907,  and  were reconstructed in 1909–1910. The work involved cutting down their superstructure to reduce topweight, removing four of the 15&nbsp;cm guns and one of the torpedo tubes, and moving the 8.8&nbsp;cm guns to the upper deck.  was not modernized, however.\nBeginning in 1908, the members of the class transitioned out of front-line service, their place having been taken by the  class and the first dreadnought battleships of the .  was the first to be moved to the Reserve Squadron in 1908, followed by  and  in 1909 and  and  the next year. For the rest of their peacetime careers, they spent much of the year out of service but were reactivated for the annual fleet maneuvers every August and September. For the exercises, they formed III Squadron, with  serving as the squadron flagship.\nWorld War I\nFollowing the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, the five -class ships were reactivated to form V Battle Squadron, with  again as the flagship. They served briefly in a coastal-defense role in the North Sea before being transferred to the Baltic in September for operations against the Russian Empire. They were slated to carry an amphibious assault force to Windau in late September, but false rumors of British warships having entered the Baltic led to the operation being cancelled. They made a sweep into the northern Baltic in December but did not encounter any Russian warships. In January 1915, they were moved back to the North Sea for guard duties, but they were quickly decommissioned the next month. The ships were by then thoroughly obsolete and were far too vulnerable to modern weapons, particularly the British submarines that had begun operating in the Baltic. In addition, the navy was facing severe crew shortages and decided that older vessels of limited combat use like the  class could not be maintained in service.\nOn 5 March, the ships were dispersed to various ports, had their crews reduced, and were eventually disarmed.  was stationed in Wilhelmshaven as a headquarters ship for the commander of the High Seas Fleet, a role she continued to fill after the war.  was used briefly as an engine-room training ship before being converted into a prison ship;  and  also served as floating prisons in Kiel and Wilhelmshaven, respectively.  became a depot ship before being relegated to a torpedo target ship in 1916. The guns taken from the ships were used as coastal artillery in the North Frisian and East Frisian Islands in the North Sea and to guard Libau in the Baltic. All five ships were broken up between 1920 and 1922 after the end of the war to ensure Germany complied with the naval disarmament clauses of the Treaty of Versailles.
