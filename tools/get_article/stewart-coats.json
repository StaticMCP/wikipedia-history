Only one gasoline touring car prototype was built.  In 1922 an agreement was made to build the Coats Steam Car, with its operations located in Columbus moving to Bowling Green. The Stewart people called it the Stewart-Coats but only a pilot model was completed.\nReferences\n* David Burgess Wise, The New Illustrated Encyclopedia of Automobiles."
