It is the band's first full-length release of original material since Hearts and Unicorns (2005) and was released as a digital download on Giant Drag's Bandcamp music store.\nReception\nMarie Wood of Drowned In Sound gave the album an 8 out of 10 rating, writing: \"The main draw of the album...&nbsp;is that like Daniel Johnston, Eels and Pinkerton-era Weezer, Hardy still strikes the golden balance of juxtaposing fear, despair and rejection with sugary pop melodies and a dry near arid sense of humour that sweetens the blow of the heavy subjects at hand making them highly relatable.\"\nTrack listing\nbonus EP (What I Know About Nothing)\n| title1          = Firestorm\n| note1           = demo\n| title2          = Sobriety Is a Sobering Experience\n| note2           = demo\n| length2         = 2:55\n| title3          = Dennis the Pennis\n| note3           = demo\n| title4          = Messif My Face\n| note4           = demo\n| title5          = Meowch\n| note5           = demo\n| title6          = Heart Carl\n| note6           = demo\n| length6         = 3:42\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* at Bandcamp"
