He has served as the 12th director of athletics at his alma mater, the University of Michigan, since January 2016.\nHe was the director of athletics at the University of Connecticut from 2012 to 2016 and at the State University of New York at Buffalo from 2005 to 2012. He served as associate athletic director at the University of Michigan from 2000 to 2005.\nEarly life and education\nManuel played high school football at Brother Martin High School in New Orleans. He was a first team high school All-American. He was recruited and enrolled at the University of Michigan, where he played defensive tackle for the Wolverines from 1986 to 1989, for coach Bo Schembechler, before suffering a career-ending neck injury.\nManuel received a Bachelor of General Studies with a focus in psychology, a Master of Social Work, and a Master of Business Administration from the University of Michigan in 1990, 1993, and 2005, respectively.\nAdministrative career\nManuel developed his management skills as assistant athletic director and then associate AD at the University of Michigan. He credits Michigan coaches and staff for his success, including Bo Schembechler, Stephen M. Ross, and Greg Harden, now Director of Athletic Counseling at Michigan.\nManuel was responsible for the hiring of Turner Gill as the head coach of Buffalo's football team. Under Gill the team achieved its first winning season and first invitation to a postseason bowl game since the program joined NCAA Division I athletics in 1999. Manuel helped change Buffalo's image and marketing strategy. Immediately after he took office, Manuel replaced the old \"Bull Head\" logo with a sleeker, more modern bull. Manuel also increased the athletics budget from $11 million to $25 million within three years of his hiring.\nManuel has served on the College Football Playoff selection committee since 2022–23, and became the committee chair for the 2024–25 edition, the first to feature a 12-team playoff.\nReferences\nAdditional sources\n* [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BN&p_theme=bn&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=1257AF69B6B1A1F8&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM Manuel's can-do attitude does plenty (Buffalo News Archives)]\n* [https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/2006-02-28-buffalo_x.htm New Buffalo trifecta busting racial barriers (USAToday)]\nExternal links\n* [http://www.mgoblue.com/genrel/warde_manuel_1000490.html Michigan profile]\n* [http://www.uconnhuskies.com/genrel/manuel_warde00.html Connecticut profile]"
