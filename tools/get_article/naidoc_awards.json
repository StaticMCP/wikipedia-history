The name is derived from the National Aborigines and Islanders Day Observance Committee.\nThe committee\nThe awards are named after the committee that was originally responsible for organising the national activities to mark NAIDOC Week, the National Aborigines and Islanders Day Observance Committee. Each year, a different city hosts the National NAIDOC Awards Ceremony. The host city, National NAIDOC Poster Competition and the NAIDOC Awards recipients are selected by the National NAIDOC Committee. The awards are presented at the annual NAIDOC Awards Ceremony and Ball.\nCategories\nThe names of the categories have varied over time. In 1985 Awards for Aboriginal of the Year, and for Aboriginal young people aged 12 to 25 were introduced.\nthe categories comprise:\n* Person of the Year\n* Lifetime Achievement Award\n* Female Elder Award\n* Male Elder Award\n* Sportsperson Award\n* Youth Award\n* Creative Talent Award\n* Caring for Country and Culture Award\n* Education Award\n* Innovation Award\nPoster\nThe first NAIDOC poster was created in 1972 to promote \"Aborigines Day\", which had been established as part of a campaign for better rights for Aboriginal people. The posters continued to reflect the spirit of protest until 1977, with titles like \"Self Determination\" and \"Chains or Chance\". The 1978 poster was different, reflecting the move from a single day of demonstration to a celebration lasting a week each July, after the new committee was established. The 1988 poster, \"Recognise and Share the Survival of the Oldest Culture in the World\" reflected the name change to NAIDOC, which formally included Torres Strait Islander people in the event. In the 1990s a competition to design the poster was introduced.\nWinners 2021–2030\n2025 winners\n2025 recipients:\n* Lifetime Achievement Award – Michael Long\n* Person Award – Dr Daniel Hunt\n* Female Elder Award – Aunty Rosalie Kickett\n* Male Elder Award – Uncle Harry Hall\n* Sportsperson Award – Danielle Ponter\n* Youth Award – Anika Gosling\n* Creative Talent Award – Christine Anu\n* Caring for Country and Culture Award – Wadjemup Project Steering Group\n* Education Award – Professor Eddie Cubillo\n* Innovation Award – Blak Brews\n2024 winners\n2024 recipients:\n* Lifetime Achievement Award – Aunty Dulcie Flower\n* Person Award – Aunty Muriel Bamblett\n* Female Elder Award – Aunty Millie Ingram\n* Male Elder Award – Mr Kim Collard\n* Sportsperson Award – Alex Winwood\n* Youth Award – Dante Rodrigues\n* Creative Talent Award – Naarah\n* Caring for Country and Culture Award – Alick Tipoti\n* Education Award – Warlpiri Education and Training Trust\n* Innovation Award – Tui Nolan\n2023 winners\n* Lifetime Achievement – Aunty Dr Naomi Mayers OAM\n* Person of the Year – Professor Kelvin Kong\n* Female Elder of the Year Award – Aunty Dr Matilda House-Williams\n* Male Elder of the Year – William Tilmouth\n* Sportsperson of the Year – Donnell Wallam\n* Youth of the Year – Courtney Burns\n* Creative Talent – Rachel Perkins\n* Caring for Country and Culture – Lala Gutchen\n* Education Award – Bubup Wilam Aboriginal Child and Family Centre\n* Innovation Award – Daniel Motlop\n2022 winners\nThe awards ceremony was held in Melbourne on 2 July 2022.
