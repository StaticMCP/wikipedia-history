As an amateur he won a gold medal at the 2007 World Championships, as well as bronze at the 2005 and 2011 World Championships, all in the flyweight division.\nAmateur career\nAt the 1st AIBA American 2004 Olympic Qualifying Tournament in 2004, at the age of 17, he upset Rayonta Whitfield and Diego Hurtado and international competitors Raúl Castañeda (Mexico), and Miguel Miranda (Venezuela) to qualify as the U.S. boxing team's 106-pound light flyweight representative at the 2004 Athens Olympics. He was both the youngest boxer in the games and the youngest US male in all sports. He was eliminated by the favored  Zou Shiming of China in the first round.\nHe moved up to flyweight soon after and in 2005 and 2006 became US champion.  At the 2005 World Amateur Boxing Championships in Mianyang he avenged a previous loss to European champion Georgy Balakshin before losing to the Korean surprise winner Lee Ok-Sung and having to settle for bronze.\nIn 2006 Light middleweight Akima Stocks and Warren were named ''USA Boxing's 2006 Athletes of the Year''. That year he also moved up to fight as a bantamweight, and lost to highly regarded Cuban Guillermo Rigondeaux in November.\nIn 2007 he returned to the flyweight ranks and repeated as US champion.\nAt the 2007 World Amateur Boxing Championships in Chicago he defeated European Champion Georgy Balakshin in a rematch and Samir Mammadov to reach the finals. In the finals he defeated Thai Somjit Jongjohor.\nIn 2008 he became the first American boxer in more than 30 years to compete at two Olympic Games, accomplishing something not done since Davey Lee Armstrong in 1972 and 1976.\nAt the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Warren lost in the first round, again to Lee Ok-Sung, in a controversial decision given that he assumed that he had won on points.\nHe remained in the amateur ranks and ascended to the bantamweight division again at the US Nationals 2009 where he controversially lost his semifinal 19:19 (countback loss) to eventual champion Jesus Magdaleno.\nWhile competing for the Los Angeles Matadors in the World Series of Boxing, Warren secured a Bronze in the US nationals in 2009, gold in 2010, and in 2011 a bronze at the Worlds. A gold medal in the 2011 individual competition (they also compete for team titles) at the WSB secured champions in 5 WSB weight classes the first Olympic slots, so participation in WSB saw Warren's first near miss at qualifying (only top 2 ranked boxers after team competition selected for individual title fight). Warren won the 2011 US Olympic Trials and came home with the Bronze after the 2011 AIBA World Championships, securing his place in a 3rd Olympics, unprecedented for an American boxer, at only 25 years old.\nOn August 3, 2012 at the London Olympics, Rau'shee Warren failed to get past the first round of the brackets yet again for the third time of his amateur career losing to Nordine Oubaali of France in a close decision of 19-18.\nWorld Series of Boxing record\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=8 | 7 Wins, 0 Losses\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#e3e3e3;\"\n| style=\"border-style:none none solid solid;\" | Result\n| style=\"border-style:none none solid solid;\" | Record\n| style=\"border-style:none none solid solid;\" | Team\n| style=\"border-style:none none solid solid;\" | Opponent (Team)\n| style=\"border-style:none none solid solid;\" | Score\n| style=\"border-style:none none solid solid;\" | Date\n| style=\"border-style:none none solid solid;\" | Location\n| style=\"border-style:none none style style;\" | Notes\n|- align=center\n| Win\n| 7–0\n| Los Angeles Matadors\n| align=left |   Donchai Thathi (Bangkok Elephants)\n|\n|\n| align=left |  Los Angeles, U.S.\n|\n|- align=center\n| Win\n| 6–0\n| Los Angeles Matadors\n| align=left |   Khabibulla Ismail-Akhunov (Astana Arlans)\n|\n|\n| align=left |  Los Angeles, U.S.\n|\n|- align=center\n| Win\n| 5–0\n| Los Angeles Matadors\n| align=left |   Mirzhan Rakhimzhanov (Astana Arlans)\n|\n|\n| align=left |  Astana, Kazakhstan\n|\n|- align=center\n| Win\n| 4–0\n| Los Angeles Matadors\n| align=left |   Braulio Ávila (Mexico Guerreros)\n|\n|\n| align=left |  Mexico City, Mexico\n|\n|- align=center\n| Win\n| 3–0\n| Los Angeles Matadors\n| align=left |   Luis Miguel Diaz (Miami Gallos)\n|\n|\n| align=left |  Los Angeles, U.S.\n|\n|- align=center\n| Win\n| 2–0\n| Los Angeles Matadors\n| align=left |   Ronny Beblik (Memphis Force)\n|\n|\n| align=left |  Memphis, U.S.\n|\n|- align=center\n| Win\n| 1–0\n| Los Angeles Matadors\n| align=left |   Elias Emigdio (Mexico Guerreros)\n|\n|\n| align=left |  Los Angeles, U.S.\n|\n|}\nProfessional career\nWarren made his long-awaited professional debut on November 9, 2012, winning a four-round unanimous decision over Luis Rivera.\nHaving won thirteen of his first fourteen fights (the only blemish being a three-round no contest against Javier Gallo on December 12, 2014), Warren attempted to win his first world championship—the WBA (Undisputed) and vacant IBO bantamweight titles—on August 2, 2015, but lost a debatable split decision to Juan Carlos Payano.\nIn a rematch with Payano on June 18, 2016, Warren gained revenge by winning both titles with a majority decision.\nHowever, Warren lost in his first defense to Zhanat Zhakiyanov by split decision.\nOn 29 July 2017, Warren faced McJoye Arroyo in an IBF super flyweight eliminator. Warren outworked Arroyo in most of the rounds, often being the busier, sharper and tougher fighter. The scorecards read 118-110, 117-109 and 117-109 if favor of Warren.\nIn his next fight against Juan Gabriel Medina, Warren had another dominant performance and defeated his opponent via unanimous decision, winning every single round on all of the scorecards.\nOn September 5, 2018, it was announced that Warren would face former Olympics opponent Nordine Oubaali for the WBC bantamweight title, previously vacated by Luis Nery. Both fighters fought well, but it was Oubaali who was the bigger puncher and landed more eye-catching shots. In addition to that, Oubaali was simply busier and sharper than Warren, which ultimately made the difference. The scorecards read 117-111, 116-112 and 115-113 in favor of Oubaali.\nOn 15 February, Warren faced Gilberto Mendoza. Warren outclassed Mendoza and won the fight comfortably on all three scorecards, 100-90, 99-91 and 99-91.\nProfessional boxing record\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!\n!Result\n!Record\n!Opponent\n!Type\n!Round, time\n!Date\n!Location\n!Notes\n|-\n|24\n|Loss\n|}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Francisco Pedroza Portillo\n|UD\n|6\n|Aug 20, 2022\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|23\n|Win\n|19–3\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Damien Vázquez\n|KO\n|2 (10),\n|Aug 14, 2021\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|22\n|Win\n|18–3\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Sharone Carter\n|UD\n|10\n|Feb 20, 2021\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|21\n|Win\n|17–3\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Gilberto Mendoza\n|UD\n|10\n|Feb 15, 2020\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|20\n|Loss\n|16–3\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Nordine Oubaali\n|UD\n|12\n|Jan 19, 2019\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|19\n|Win\n|16–2\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Juan Gabriel Medina\n|UD\n|8\n|Apr 21, 2018\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|18\n|Win\n|15–2\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|McJoe Arroyo\n|UD\n|12\n|Jul 29, 2017\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|17\n|Loss\n|14–2\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Zhanat Zhakiyanov\n|SD\n|12\n|Feb 10, 2017\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|16\n|Win\n|14–1\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Juan Carlos Payano\n|\n|12\n|Jun 18, 2016\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|15\n|Loss\n|13–1\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Juan Carlos Payano\n|\n|12\n|Aug 2, 2015\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|14\n|Win\n|13–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Javier Gallo\n|TKO\n|1 (10),\n|Mar 6, 2015\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|13\n|style=\"background:#DDD\"|\n|12–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Javier Gallo\n|NC\n|1 (10),\n|Dec 12, 2014\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|12\n|Win\n|12–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Jose Luis Araiza\n|UD\n|10\n|Sep 6, 2014\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|11\n|Win\n|11–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Ricardo Alvarado\n|UD\n|10\n|May 2, 2014\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|10\n|Win\n|10–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|German Meraz\n|UD\n|8\n|Jan 25, 2014\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|9\n|Win\n|9–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Jose Silveira\n|UD\n|8\n|Dec 14, 2013\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|8\n|Win\n|8–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Jhon Alberto Molina\n|UD\n|4\n|Oct 14, 2013\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|7\n|Win\n|7–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Omar Gonzalez\n|UD\n|6\n|Sep 2, 2013\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|6\n|Win\n|6–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Jesus Bayron\n|UD\n|6\n|Jul 5, 2013\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|5\n|Win\n|5–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Jiovanne Fuentes\n|TKO\n|2 (4),\n|Jun 22, 2013\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|4\n|Win\n|4–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Angel Carvajal\n|TKO\n|4 (4),\n|May 18, 2013\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|3\n|Win\n|3–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Richard Hernandez\n|\n|2 (4),\n|Feb 16, 2013\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|2\n|Win\n|2–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|David Reyes\n|UD\n|4\n|Dec 8, 2012\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|1\n|Win\n|1–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Luis Rivera\n|\n|4\n|Nov 9, 2012\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.premierboxingchampions.com/raushee-warren Rau'shee Warren profile] at Premier Boxing Champions\n*[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A9544-2004Aug17.html Washington Post 2004]\n*[http://www.boxing-scoop.com/show_boxer.php?boxer_ID=920 Rau'shee Warren Amateur Boxing Record]\n*[https://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1819129_1819134_1826038,00.html \"Rau'Shee Warren\"], n°56 on Time’s list of \"100 Olympic Athletes To Watch\"\n*[http://amateur-boxing.strefa.pl/Nationalchamps/USA2009.html US championships 2009]\n*[https://box.live/boxers/raushee-warren/ Rau'Shee Warren - Profile, News Archive & Current Rankings] at [https://Box.Live Box.Live]"
