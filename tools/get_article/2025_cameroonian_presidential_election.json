Opposition candidate Issa Tchiroma of the Cameroon National Salvation Front finished second with 35% of the vote.\nBackground\nThe previous presidential elections on 7 October 2018 saw incumbent president Paul Biya, who has ruled since 1982, elected for another seven-year term following a 2008 constitutional amendment that removed term limits, allowing Biya to run again. Biya's candidacy remained plausible, however, with his declaration of wanting to continue to serve the nation, reaffirming during his 7 October campaign speech in Maroua that he will \"never resign...until significant progress has been achieved in this area.\" His candidacy for the 2025 presidential election caused controversy within the Cameroonian government, while a petition was filed by opposition candidate Akere Muna before the Constitutional Council seeking to disqualify Biya on grounds of the latter's advanced age, recurrent health absences, and presumed dependency on third parties.\nElectoral system\nThe President of Cameroon is elected by first-past-the-post voting; the candidate with the most votes is declared the winner with no requirement to achieve a majority. Registration for voting ended on 31 August 2024, with more than seven million people estimated to have signed up.\nCandidates\nA total of 83 people registered their candidacy in the election, of which seven were women. On 26 July, Elections Cameroon (Elecam) released a provisional list of 13 candidates, with Hermine Patricia Tomaïno Ndam Njoya as the only female candidate.

Despite official results not being released yet, Issa Tchiroma declared himself the winner of the election in a speech on social media post on 14 October, and called on president Biya to concede. Grégoire Owona, deputy secretary-general of Biya's RDPC, said that Tchiroma did not win and did not have the polling results. Atanga also accused Tchiroma of plotting \"a cleverly planned diabolical plan with his occult networks at home and abroad aimed at setting Cameroon ablaze\".\nOn 15 October, Tchiroma alleged that vote tampering had taken place, while protests broke out in several cities over allegations of electoral fraud, including at the Elecam headquarters in Douala. The offices of the RDPC in Dschang was set on fire. An armed vigil was established by Tchiroma's supporters outside his residence in Garoua. More than 800 were arrested nationwide, while conflict reports emerged as to the number of deaths, with authorities saying that 16 people were killed in the protests while opposition groups said the death toll was at 55. Data from United Nations sources suggest 48 dead, while Human Rights Watch said that 2,000 people had been detained, many of whom had not been presented in court.\nOn 19 October, Tchiroma released tallies showing him having won about 60% of the vote. The next day, the National Vote Counting Commission released provisional results showing Paul Biya leading with 53% of the vote, followed by Tchiroma at 35%. The announcement of Biya as the provisional winner set off protests in multiple cities. A teacher died after she was reportedly shot by a police officer during protests in Garoua on 21 October.\nOn 3 November, a three-day lockdown was launched by Tchiroma in protest against the election result, with Douala, Maroua and Garoua being particularly affected. A partial shutdown also occurred in Yaounde.\nThe Episcopal Conference of Cameroon, which monitored the election, noted several irregularities during the election, including the relocation of polling stations and failure to update the electoral register, which contained the names of deceased persons.\nThe Constitutional Council announced the official results of the election on 27 October.\nOn 6 November, Paul Biya was inaugurated for a new term as president.\nSee also\n*2020 Cameroonian parliamentary election\nReferences"
