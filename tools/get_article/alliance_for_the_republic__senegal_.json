It was formed by former Prime Minister and 4th president Macky Sall after his departure from the Senegalese Democratic Party (PDS) in December 2008. Macky Sall was also APR's candidate in the 2012 presidential election in which he defeated incumbent President Abdoulaye Wade. APR was joined by several former members of the PDS.\nIt is the dominant partner in the United in Hope coalition, which has held a majority in the National Assembly until 25 September 2022 when Aminata Touré announced she would no longer sit with the majority in the Assembly, accusing President Sall of promoting Amadou Mame Diop as president of the National Assembly due to \"familial ties\".\nElection results\nPresidential elections\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Election\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Party candidate\n! colspan=\"2\" |First Round\n! colspan=\"2\" |Second Round\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Result\n|-\n!Votes\n!%\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n!2012\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Macky Sall\n|719,367\n|26.58%\n|1,909,244\n|65.80%\n|Won\n|-\n!2019\n|2,555,426\n|58.26%\n|colspan=2\n|Won\n|-\n!2024\n|Amadou Ba\n|1,605,086\n|35.79%\n|colspan=2\n|Lost\n|}\nNational Assembly elections\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!Party leader\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n!+/–\n!Position\n!Outcome\n|-\n!2012\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Macky Sall\n|1,040,899\n|53.06%\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |}}\n|New\n| 1st\n|\n|-\n!2017\n|1,637,761\n|49.47%\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |}}\n| 6\n| 1st\n|\n|-\n!2022\n|Aminata Touré\n|1,518,137\n|46.56%\n|}}\n| 43\n| 1st\n|\n|-\n!2024\n|Macky Sall\n|531,466\n|14.67%\n|}}\n| 66\n| 2nd\n|\n|}\nSee also\n* Abdou Mbow, spokesperson for the Alliance for the Republic (Senegal)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.apr.sn/ Website of the Alliance for the Republic] (French)\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130909074713/http://fansdemacky.com/pages/ivoire.html Alliance for the Republic - \"Fans de Macky\"] (French)"
