It was based upon the business of the Birmingham private bankers Gibbins & Lovell, established in 1825 by Joseph Gibbins and Edward Bourne Lovell, and initially traded from their premises in New Street. The bank built itself a headquarters in Birmingham at the junction of Waterloo Street and Bennetts Hill which was constructed in 1830 to the designs of the architects  Thomas Rickman and Henry Hutchinson. They moved into this new building in 1831. It was altered in 1868 by Yeoville Thomason; and an extension in Bennetts Hill by Harris & Martin was added in 1881–4.\nThe firm grew rapidly and by the mid-1830s it was one of Birmingham's strongest banks.\nDuring the financial crisis of 1866 the bank suffered severe liquidity problems and failed on 14 July 1866 with liabilities of £1.8m () against a capital of £280,000 (). It was the largest bank to fail during the banking crisis of the mid-1860s. It was restructured and reopened in August 1866.\nIt amalgamated with the Royal Exchange Bank (formerly the Metropolitan Bank) in 1889 to form The Metropolitan and Birmingham Bank. This amalgamation enabled the Birmingham company to facilitate its London business as the Royal Exchange Bank had a seat in the clearing house, and until this time the Birmingham bank had paid fees of several thousand pounds a year for cashing their cheques in the London Bankers' Clearing House. The nominal capital of the bank increased at this time from £3.5m to £5.0m (equivalent to £ million in ).\nOn the acquisition of the South Wales Union in 1892 it was renamed the Metropolitan, Birmingham and South Wales Bank and on the acquisition of the National Bank of Wales in 1893 it changed its name again to the Metropolitan Bank (of England and Wales).\nThe Metropolitan Bank (of England and Wales) was acquired by the Midland Bank in 1914. The branch on Bennetts Hill closed in 2002 and the building was converted for use as a wine bar.\nAcquisitions\n*1838 Bank of Birmingham (est 1832)\n*1844 Dixon, Dalton and Amphlett, Dudley (est 1791)\n*1848 Charles Forster and Sons, Walsall (est 1793)\n*1865 Little and Woodcock, Coventry (est 1762)\n*1880 Stourbridge and Kidderminster Bank\n*1889 Staffordshire Joint Stock Bank\n*1889 Royal Exchange Bank\n*1889 Cooper Purton and Sons, Bridgnorth\n*1892 South Wales Union Bank\n*1893 National Bank of Wales\n*1910 Davis Banks and Company, Kington (est 1789)\nReferences"
