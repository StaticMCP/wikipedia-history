Pollock tried, in April 1876, the unprecedented case of the Queen v. Keyn, arising out of the sinking of the British vessel Strathclyde by the German steamship Franconia. The collision occurred within three miles of the English coast, and Keyn, the master of the Franconia, to whose culpable negligence-it was imputed, was indicted for manslaughter and found guilty.\nPollock deferred judgment pending the decision of the question of jurisdiction by the court for the consideration of crown cases reserved, and concurred with the majority of that court in quashing the conviction.\nHe took part in several other important decisions of the same tribunal.\nIn the ''St. Paul's reredos'' case in 1889 he differed from Lord Coleridge, and his judgment was sustained by both the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords.\nPollock was vice-president of the Rochester Diocesan Association, a member of the Commons' Preservation Society, and of the Board of Conservators of Wimbledon Common.\nHe died at his residence, The Croft, Putney, on 21 November 1897.\nFamily\nHe married three times: first, on 1 September 1848, Nicola Sophia, second daughter of the Rev. Henry Herbert, rector of Rathdowney, Queen's County, Ireland; secondly, on 25 May 1858, Georgiana, second daughter of George William Archibald, LL.D., M.R., of Nova Scotia; thirdly, on 23 December 1865, Amy Menella, daughter of Hassard Hume Dodgson, master of the court of common pleas and cousin of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson.\nHe had issue by all three wives.\nWorks\nPollock was joint author, with J.J. Lowndes and Sir Peter Maxwell, of\n*''Reports of Cases argued and determined in the Queen's Bench Practice Court : with Points of Practice and Pleading decided in the Courts of Common Pleas and Exchequer (1850-1), London, 1851–2, 2 vols. 8vo.\nHe was also joint author, with F. P. Maude, of\nA Compendium of the Law of Merchant Shipping; with an Appendix containing all the Statutes of practical utility, London, 1853, 8vo; 4th ed. by Pollock and Sir Gainsford Bruce, 1881.\nHe was author of the following works:\n* The Practice of the County Courts, London, 1851, 8vo; Supplements entitled\n**(1) An Act to facilitate and arrange proceedings in the County Courts, 15 & 16 Vict. c. 54; together with the Absconding Debtors Act, 14 & 15 Viet. c. 52, London, 1 852, 8vo.\n**(2) The Practice of the County Courts in respect of Probate and Administration, London, 1858, 8vo.\n**(3) Equitable Jurisdiction of the County Courts, London, 1865, 12rao); last edition, including supplements, revised by H.
