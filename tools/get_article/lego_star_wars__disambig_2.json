      "text": "# Lego Star Wars__disambig_2\n\n'Lego Star Wars (stylized as LEGO Star Wars') is a Lego theme based on the Star Wars media franchise created by George Lucas. It includes over 928 Lego building toy sets, 1389 Lego minifigures, an eponymous video game series containing six games, and multiple animated short films and television series.\nOriginally it was only licensed from 1998 to 2009, but The Lego Group extended the license with Lucasfilm, first until 2011, then until 2016, then again until 2022, and then once more until 2026.\nOverview\nLego Star Wars&nbsp;is based on the&nbsp;Star Wars saga and franchise. The product line directly focuses on the Star Wars characters from the films and TV Series, with the exception of a few special characters. It was first announced in February 1999 at the North American International Toy Fair, serving as a tie-in to Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, that would be released in May.\nDevelopment\nThe Lego Star Wars designers have revealed how they have \"changed strategy\" to get popular minifigures into cheaper and more accessible sets. Lego Star Wars Creative Lead Jens Kronvold Frederikcen explained, \"We have changed our strategy a little bit over the years,\" and continued, \"Where in the past, we often kept some of them – the most important especially – for the higher prices, we are now thinking young kids, maybe newcomers to Star Wars, want to get into it.\"\nThe designers revealed the Force Ghost minifigures as a result of changes to the company's transparent plastic. Creative Lead Jens Kronvold Frederikcen, \"The reason for not doing it was that the minifigures are made out of many different types of plastic, because they need to have different abilities and characteristics,\"&nbsp;Design Director Michael Lee Stockwell explained, \"Some have to be flexible, some need to use clutch power and whatnot,\" and continued, \"So the hands are different material than the heads, for example.\"\nStockwell explained how coming up with playsets based on new shows and movies is trickier than creating vehicles. Referring to a Lego set based on The Mandalorian, Stockwell explained, \"We were interested in [the Armourer's forge] already from the first season, but we didn't know enough about the context,\" and continued, \"We didn't know enough of what was happening around this. That's one of the major differences between designing a ship and a playset like this, because it's sometimes easier to understand a ship.\"\nThe designers explained the Death Star (set number: 75316) is a great example of how they decide which sets to produce. Frederiksen explained, \"If it's something that's exposed in more places, then there's a high chance that it's popular,\" and continued, \"We did the same thing when creating stuff from Star Trek. We always thought the best set was [vehicles] that were both from the prequel movies, but also in The Clone Wars, [because] then we make more people happy.\"\nThe designers explained the design process of a minifigures and how they feel responsible for their accuracy. Lego Star Wars designer Madison O'Neil explained, \"Part of that is just trying to fit these details in. The leg print, the arm print, wherever we can that's a new thing that we're starting to be able to do a little bit more of which is great to have the capacity to do that. We work within these frames that we have within the company that everyone has, and we just try to do the absolute best we can.\"\nConstruction sets\n's TIE Fighter Lego set]]According to the Lego-owned marketplace BrickLink, The Lego Group has,  released a total of 928 Lego sets and promotional polybags and 1389 minifigures as part of its Lego Star Wars theme.\nMinifigures\nSome minifigures repeatedly appear across multiple Lego sets, while others can be very rare, vastly increasing their resale value. Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader are the themes most prominent minifigures while battle droids are, by quantity, one of the most often appearing minifigures in all of Lego. The first Lego Star Wars minifigures to ever be released were Luke Skywalker and Ben Kenobi from #7110 \"Landspeeder\". Tan colored OOM battle droids are the first Lego Star Wars minifigure by production code (sw0001a) and have only four different unique designs, all of which are only different oriented arms and an additional backplate. Lego switched the skin tone from yellow to a more natural skin tone between 2003 and 2004, and by 2005 the yellow skin tone was retired in the Lego Star Wars line. In 2019, the number of Lego Star Wars minifigures has surpassed 1000, with the Battlefront II protagonist Iden Versio bearing code sw1000.\nLego Star Wars construction sets\nThe first few sets based on the original trilogy were released in 1999, coinciding with the release of The Phantom Menace. The first wave of Lego Star Wars sets included model 7140, an X-wing fighter. Sets based on the prequel trilogy (Episodes I to III) of Star Wars would follow, starting with Episode I – The Phantom Menace. As each new film in the prequel trilogy neared its release date, Lego issued new models of ships and scenes in those films, as well as additional sets from the original trilogy. Lego also produced models based on Clone Wars, The Clone Wars, The Old Republic, The Force Unleashed, Rebels, The Force Awakens, Battlefront, Rogue One, The Last Jedi, Solo, Resistance, The Mandalorian, The Rise of Skywalker, The Bad Batch, The Book of Boba Fett, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Star Wars: Andor, Ahsoka, and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. Sets based on Star Wars: Young Jedi Adventures, Galaxy's Edge, The Freemaker Adventures, and Vader Immortal have also been produced.\nIn 2022, The Lego Group announced the Lego Star Wars theme will continue until  December 2032.\nUltimate Collector Series (UCS) sets\nIn addition to the regular Minifigure-scale sets, Lego has released 37 sets in their Ultimate Collector Series line, also known as UCS. Starting in 2000 with models of the X-Wing and TIE Interceptor, these models are known for being considerably larger, more detailed, and meant more for display purposes than other sets. As a result, they tend to cost more than other Lego Star Wars sets. They often include an information plaque and display stand. For example, the 2017 UCS version of the Millennium Falcon contained 7541 pieces, including 10 Minifigures, and was the largest Lego Star Wars set ever released at the time, and the fifth largest set of any collection ever commercially released. On June 5, 2015, a sealed box of the older 2007 Millennium Falcon Lego set (10179) was auctioned at online auction house Catawiki for €5,000 ($5556.50 USD at the time), making it the most expensive Lego set to ever be sold on the secondhand market.  The Death Star (75419), which released on October 1, 2025, contains 9019 pieces and surpassed the 2017 Millennium Falcon'' as the largest UCS set on release by piece count, and was the first Lego set ever to be sold for $1,000 USD at MSRP.\nList of Ultimate Collectors Series sets\nThis list contains every Lego Star Wars set released under the Ultimate Collectors Series line, and contain some of the most notable sets in the Lego Star Wars line.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center; margin: 5px;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background-color:#ddddee;\" width=100 | Set Name\n!style=\"background-color:#ddddee;\" width=50 | Set Number\n!style=\"background-color:#ddddee;\" width=50 | Release Year\n!style=\"background-color:#ddddee;\" width=50 | # of Pieces\n!style=\"background-color:#ddddee;\" width=100 | Origin\n|-\n|TIE Interceptor\n|7181\n|2000\n|703\n|Return of the Jedi\n|-\n|X-Wing\n|7191\n|2000\n|1300\n|A New Hope\n|-\n|Darth Maul\n|10018\n|2001\n|1868\n|The Phantom Menace\n|-\n|Rebel Blockade Runner\n|10019\n|2001\n|1746\n|A New Hope\n|-\n|Yoda\n|7194\n|2002\n|1075\n|The Empire Strikes Back\n|-\n|Naboo Starfighter\n|10026\n|2002\n|187\n|The Phantom Menace\n|-\n|Imperial Star Destroyer\n|10030\n|2002\n|3106\n|A New Hope\n|-\n|Rebel Snowspeeder\n|10129\n|2003\n|1455\n|The Empire Strikes Back\n|-\n|Y-Wing Attack Starfighter\n|10134\n|2004\n|1489\n|A New Hope\n|-\n|Death Star II\n|10143\n|2005\n|3447\n|Return of the Jedi\n|-\n|Imperial AT-ST\n|10174\n|2006\n|1068\n|The Empire Strikes Back\n|-\n|''Vader's TIE Advance\n|10175\n|2006\n|1212\n|A New Hope\n|-\n|Millennium Falcon\n|10179\n|2007\n|5197\n|A New Hope\n|-\n|General Grievous\n|10186\n|2008\n|1085\n|Revenge of the Sith\n|-\n|Death Star\n|10188\n|2008\n|3803\n|A New Hope\n|-\n|Imperial Shuttle\n|10212\n|2010\n|2503\n|Return of the Jedi\n|-\n|Obi-Wan's Jedi Starfighter\n|10215\n|2010\n|676\n|Attack of the Clones\n|-\n|Super Star Destroyer\n|10221\n|2011\n|3152\n|The Empire Strikes Back\n|-\n|R2-D2\n|10225\n|2012\n|2127\n|A New Hope\n|-\n|B-Wing Starfighter\n|10227\n|2012\n|1487\n|Return of the Jedi\n|-\n|Ewok Village\n|10236\n|2013\n|1990\n|Return of the Jedi\n|-\n|Red Five X-wing Starfighter\n|10240\n|2013\n|1559\n|A New Hope\n|-\n|Sandcrawler\n|75059\n|2014\n|3296\n|A New Hope\n|-\n|Slave 1\n|75060\n|2015\n|1996\n|The Empire Strikes Back\n|-\n|TIE Fighter\n|75095\n|2015\n|1685\n|A New Hope\n|-\n|Assault on Hoth\n|75098\n|2016\n|2144\n|The Empire Strikes Back\n|-\n|Death Star\n|75159\n|2016\n|4016\n|A New Hope\n|-\n|Snowspeeder\n|75144\n|2017\n|1703\n|The Empire Strikes Back\n|-\n|Millennium Falcon\n|75192\n|2017\n|7541\n|A New Hope\n|-\n|Y-Wing Starfighter\n|75181\n|2018\n|1967\n|A New Hope\n|-\n|Imperial Star Destroyer\n|75252\n|2019\n|4784\n|A New Hope\n|-\n|A-Wing Starfighter\n|75275\n|2020\n|1673\n|Return of the Jedi\n|-\n|Republic Gunship\n|75309\n|2021\n|3292\n|Attack of the Clones\n|-\n|AT-AT\n|75313\n|2021\n|6785\n|The Empire Strikes Back\n|-\n|Razor Crest\n|75331\n|2022\n|6187\n|The Mandalorian\n|-\n|Luke Skywalker's Landspeeder\n|75341\n|2022\n|1890\n|A New Hope\n|-\n|X-Wing Starfighter\n|75355\n|2023\n|1953\n|A New Hope\n|-\n|Venator-Class Republic Attack Cruiser\n|75367\n|2023\n|5374\n|Revenge of the Sith\n|-\n|TIE Interceptor\n|75382\n|2024\n|1931\n|Return of the Jedi\n|-\n|Jabba's Sail Barge\n|75397\n|2024\n|3943\n|Return of the Jedi\n|-\n|Jango Fett's Firespray-Class Starship\n|75409\n|2025\n|2970\n|Attack of the Clones\n|-\n|AT-ST Walker\n|75417\n|2025\n|1513\n|The Empire Strikes Back\n|-\n|Death Star\n|75419\n|2025\n|9023\n|A New Hope\n|}\nMaster Builder Series (MBS) sets\nWith similar complexity to the Ultimate Collector Series sets, sets under the Master Builder Series are built with the purpose of playing, featuring numerous play features, functions, and interior details as compared to the UCS, which are meant more for display purposes.
