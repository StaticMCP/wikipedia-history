Led by seventh-year head coach Dan Curran, the Warriors compiled an overall record of 6–5. Merrimack had a record of 1–3 against NEC opponents, but the Warriors were ineligible for the NEC title, and those games did not count in the conference standings. The team played home games at Duane Stadium in North Andover, Massachusetts.\nSchedule\n| site_stadium = Duane Stadium\n| site_cityst = North Andover, MA\n| tv = NEC Front Row\n| score = 45–14\n| attend = 4,047\n}}\n|\n|\n|\n| site_stadium = Duane Stadium\n| site_cityst = North Andover, MA\n| tv = NEC Front Row\n| score = 76–7\n| attend = 3,123\n}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| site_stadium = Duane Stadium\n| site_cityst = North Andover, MA\n| tv = NEC Front Row\n| score = 57–0\n| attend = 1,685\n}}\n|\n}}\nPreseason\nPreseason coaches' poll\nThe NEC released their preseason coaches' poll on July 24, 2019.
