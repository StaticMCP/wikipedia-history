Hired a few years earlier to reinforce the eastern frontier, the Company had become increasingly difficult to control and entered into open conflict with the Byzantines after the murder of its leader Roger de Flor.\nMichael IX assembled the main imperial field army in an effort to bring the Company to battle, but the confrontation near Apros in Thrace ended in a decisive Catalan victory. The collapse of key Byzantine auxiliary troops at the outset of the fighting left the imperial centre exposed, and the army broke under pressure. The defeat effectively removed the Byzantine ability to challenge the Company. In its aftermath, the Catalans and their Turkish allies ranged freely through Thrace before advancing westward into Macedonia and Thessaly, ultimately establishing control over the Duchy of Athens.\nBackground\nentering Constantinople before Emperor Andronikos II (1303).]]\nBy the early fourteenth century the Byzantine Empire was struggling to resist the rising power of Serbia under Stefan Milutin and contain Turkish advances in Asia Minor. With limited resources and repeated defeats on the eastern frontier, the government of Andronikos II Palaiologos turned increasingly to foreign mercenaries for support.\nAmong these were the Catalan Company, a band of professional soldiers, led by former Templar Roger de Flor.}} Andronikos II hired them on generous terms, hoping they could stabilise the frontier. Their early campaigns relieved several besieged cities, driving the Turks from Kyzikos during the Battle of the Cyzicus, even challenging Osman’s emirate in 1304. Soon the Catalans started to plunder Asia Minor, quarrel with the Genoese of Galata and clash with the Alan mercenaries. By early 1305 the Catalans were in control of the  Gallipoli peninsula, operating independently of imperial control. Tensions escalated in April 1305 when Roger de Flor was murdered in Michael IX's camp at Adrianople, stabbed by an Alan leader, while the roughly three hundred men accompanying him were massacred. The Catalans swore revenge for the murder of their leader and entered into open war with the empire.\nPrelude\nMichael IX Palaiologos, son and co-emperor of Andronikos II, decided to strike the Company before it could consolidate its position. A first expedition was repulsed and the Catalans continued to hold Gallipoli while raiding surrounding regions. Michael IX then gathered the main Byzantine field army, supported by Alan mercenaries contingents with the goal of forcing a decisive confrontation. The Catalans, determined to avenge Roger's killing and assert their independence, prepared to meet the imperial force, electing Berenguar de Rocafort as their new commander. Rocafort strengthened their force by bringing in Turkish mercenaries from across the Hellespont (Dardanelles). The two sides moved toward Thrace.\nBattle\nIn July 1305 the Catalan Company and the Byzantine army met near Apros in Thrace. The imperial forces, commanded by Michael IX, were considerably larger and included Alan and Tourkopoulos contingents on the flanks under Bulgarian commander Vojisil. The Catalan army flew the banners of the kingdoms of Sicily and Aragon.\nWhen the fighting began, the Alan cavalry on the Byzantine left withdrew almost immediately, disrupting the cohesion of the imperial line. Their departure was followed by the desertion of the Tourkopouloi, who passed over to the Catalans together with the Turks already serving alongside them.\nThe collapse of the Byzantine flanks allowed the Catalans to press their attack and rout the remaining imperial troops. Contemporary figures cited by medieval historian Mark C. Bartusis describe the Catalan force as much smaller than Michael IX's army, yet the numerical advantage of the Byzantines did not prevent a decisive defeat. According to military scholars Nikolaos Kanellopoulos and Ioanna Lekea, it is very likely that the Byzantine cavalry was defeated by the Catalan infantry. Byzantinist Donald Nicol notes that Michael IX nearly lost all his army and barely escaped with his own life. The engagement ended in a clear Catalan victory.\nAftermath\nIn the months that followed, the Company moved aggressively against imperial auxiliaries. At the foot of the Balkan Mountains, the Alan contingents that had entered Byzantium in 1301 were overtaken and annihilated by a pursuing Catalan force. After the battle the Catalans, together with their Turkish allies and the defected Tourkopouloi, advanced across Thrace.\nEstablishing their base at Rhaidestos, which was closer to Constantinople, they spent more than two years raiding the surrounding region. As a last resort the Emperor ordered that all the country between Selymbria and Constantinople should be evacuated and the crops destroyed. The Catalans began a westward movement into Macedonia and Thessaly ultimately conquering the Latin Duchy of Athens in 1311.\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
