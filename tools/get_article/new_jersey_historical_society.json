Hornblower, Robert Gibbon Johnson, Peter D. Vroom and William A. Whitehead. In 1846, the society relocated to Newark and has been there ever since.\nIts original headquarters in Newark were located on Market Street. In 1931 it left Downtown Newark for a large colonial-style building partially paid for by Louis Bamberger at 230 Broadway, east of Branch Brook Park.\nIn 1997 the Historical Society returned downtown, to 52 Park Place, on Military Park. The new home is a Georgian style building vacated by the Essex Club that was designed by Guilbert & Betelle.  The building was built in 1926 and had been added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 22, 1991. In its first year in the downtown location visits increased almost fivefold.\nSee also\n*Newark Museum\n*Newark Public Library\n*List of historical societies in New Jersey\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Essex County, New Jersey\n*New Jersey Historical Trust\n*Jewish Museum of New Jersey\n*John T.
