Ewart was a double nominee (and one/time winner) of the AACTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role\nEarly life\nEwart was born in Melbourne, Victoria to Alfred Adam Ewart, an insurance agent and his wife Jennie Grace Madge Lois (nee Macauley).\nCareer\nEwart began his acting career when he was cast as Dopey at the age four in a 3XY radio production of Snow White. At the age of 18, he made his film debut in the lead role of Mickey O'Riordan in Charles Chauvel's production of Sons of Matthew.\nEwart appeared in hundreds of Australian radio, theatre, film and television productions. To many thousands of Australians who grew up in the 1950s and '60s, he will be remembered as 'Jimmy', the boyishly cheeky co-presenter of the ABC Radio ''Children's Session, and in the title role of its long-running serial The Muddle-Headed Wombat.\nHe was well known for his role in the film Sunday Too Far Away, his ongoing role in the Australian TV series The Restless Years in 1980–81, and his lead role opposite Nicole Kidman in Bush Christmas. He was proudest of his starring role in the 1977 film The Picture Show Man''.\nPersonal life\nEwart married four times, firstly to Lorraine Marie Croke, a Sydney beauty consultant in May 1951 and had twins, a son and a daughter, but divorced a few years later, he then married Susan Mary Newton, a classical singer and actress on radio, stage and TV on 17 April 1966, with whom he had two daughters. They divorced in 1978. On 24 December, he married public relations consultant Patricia De Heer.\nIn 1992 he became engaged to TV presenter Jane Fennell, but they postponed the wedding after the death of her father, Ewart's long time friend Willie Fennell. They were married on 8 March 1994 in a bedside ceremony as Ewart was dying of throat cancer. He died five days after the wedding.\nAwards and nominations\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Year\n!
