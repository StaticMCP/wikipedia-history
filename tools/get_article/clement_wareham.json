He played in two first-class matches for Wellington in the 1934–35 Plunket Shield season, but without success.\nWareham enlisted for duty in the New Zealand armed forces at the outset of World War II. While serving in England in September 1940 he died when he was struck by a car while crossing a road. A month earlier he had top-scored with 50 for a New Zealand Expeditionary Force XI in a victory over an Australian Imperial Forces XI in a one-day match at Aldershot.\nSee also\n* List of Wellington representative cricketers\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
