It is approximately  long and flows through Huntington Township. The watershed of the stream has an area of  and it has two unnamed tributaries. Wild trout naturally reproduce in the stream. The surficial geology in its vicinity mainly consists of alluvium, Wisconsinan Till, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift, bedrock, and wetlands.\nCourse\nKingsbury Brook begins in a valley southeast of the community of Southdale, in Huntington Township. It flows southwest for a short distance before turning south-southwest and then west-southwest, passing through a small pond. The stream then turns southwest and receives an unnamed tributary from the right. It then turns south for a few tenths of a mile before crossing State Route 4006 and then receives an unnamed tributary from the left. A short distance further downstream, it reaches its confluence with Huntington Creek.\nKingsbury Brook joins Huntington Creek  upstream of its mouth.\nTributaries\nKingsbury Brook has no named tributaries. However, it does have two unnamed tributaries. The first is approximately  long and the second is approximately  long and passes through several ponds.\nGeography and geology\nThe elevation near the mouth of Kingsbury Brook is  above sea level. The elevation near the stream's source is between  above sea level.\nThe surficial geology along Kingsbury Brook in its lower reaches mainly features alluvium, which contains stratified sand, silt, gravel, and some boulders. Some Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift, which contains stratified sand and gravel along with some boulders, is present along the sides of the stream's valley. Further away from the stream, the surficial geology includes a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till, as well as a patch of Wisconsinan Bouldery Till. The upper reaches of the stream mainly have Wisconsinan Till in their vicinity. The surficial geology of the area features bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale in a few places.\nWatershed\nThe watershed of Kingsbury Brook has an area of . The stream is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Stillwater.\nHistory\nKingsbury Brook was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1178500.\nThere is a patch of wetland in the vicinity of the lower reaches of Kingsbury Brook. The stream is near the community of Southdale.\nBiology\nThe drainage basin of Kingsbury Brook is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Wild trout naturally reproduce in the stream from its headwaters downstream to its mouth.\nSee also\n*Pine Creek (Huntington Creek), next tributary of Huntington Creek going downstream\n*Rogers Creek, next tributary of Huntington Creek going upstream\n*List of tributaries of Fishing Creek (North Branch Susquehanna River)\n*List of rivers of Pennsylvania\nReferences"
