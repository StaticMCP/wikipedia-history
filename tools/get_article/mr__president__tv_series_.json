Scott and premiered on May 3, 1987. It was part of the Fox Broadcasting Company's premiere season of prime time entertainment, alongside Married... with Children, The Tracey Ullman Show, and Duet.\nPlot\nThe series centered around newly elected President Samuel Arthur Tresch, the former governor of Wisconsin. Others in the cast were Meg Tresch, Samuel's wife, who left him at the start of the second season, and Samuel's children, 16-year-old Cynthia and 12-year-old Nick. Charlie Ross was the Chief of Staff.\nThe show takes place in the near future relative to its airing: it is mentioned in the episode “Freedom of Speech” that Tresch won the 1988 United States presidential election and a newspaper headline in “Strange Bedfellows” indicates that the events of that episode take place around October 8, 1990. It is implied in “Loisgate” that Meg and Samuel separated in April 1991.\nCast\n*George C. Scott ...  President Samuel Arthur Tresch\n*Conrad Bain ...

Scott to propose starring in a half-hour sitcom involving the day-to-day life of a man who \"just happened to be the President of the United States\", complete with 13 episodes as a premiere show for the upstart Fox Broadcasting Company, which had started in April. Scott found it an alluring challenge and chance to make a show better than the status quo type of programming. The result was a show that saw Scott butt heads with the attempts to emphasize gags and topical humor to go with shtick despite taking the time out of his Connecticut home to go to the West Coast (complete with a request for a motor home near the shooting stage) to volunteer services for story conferences. Scott came up with an idea for an episode where his character must appoint a Vice President and he picks a highly qualified black woman that sees repercussions ensue. However, the concept was rejected despite Scott paying a writer for a first draft, with Scott quoting the executive producer as saying, \"I don't know how to do a story like that.\" In the buildup to the premiere, Carson described it as “not a situation comedy...I would call it more of a drama – with humor and with comedy and all the other emotions people have within a family\", while Scott cited the talent alongside the chance to ensure his retirement with money.\nThe show was cancelled in the winter of 1987. Scott, describing the working situation as \"positively Byzantine\", wrote an article to the Los Angeles Times relating his experience with the show within a sardonic conversation between himself and his conscience (named Sam Tresch) after he had dealt with an acute myocardial infarction in January 1988; he stated that the show had managed to succeed only in \"trivializing the presidency.\"\nEpisode list\nSeason 1 (1987)\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%; background:#fff;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#;\"| No.overall\n! style=\"background:#;\"| No. inseason\n! style=\"background:#;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#;\"| Directed by\n! style=\"background:#;\"| Written by\n! style=\"background:#;\"| Original air date\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|}\nSeason 2 (1987–1988)\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%; background:#fff;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#;\"| No.overall\n! style=\"background:#;\"| No. inseason\n! style=\"background:#;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#;\"| Directed by\n! style=\"background:#;\"| Written by\n! style=\"background:#;\"| Original air date\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
