The expedition was initiated by the newly established Danish East India Company and led by 24-year-old Ove Gjedde. Despite not achieving its original goal of monopolizing Ceylon, the expedition still managed to receive control and trading privileges over various coastal towns and cities.\nBackground\nIn 1616 the Danish East India Company was established with the aim of starting Danish commerce in the East Indies. Originally, the Company's commercial interests lay in the Coromandel Coast, however, when courier for Kandy Marchelis Boschouver arrived in Copenhagen, he managed to convince the Company's shareholders, including Christian IV of Denmark, to invest in a monopoly on Ceylon. Subsequently, an expedition led by 24-year-old Ove Gjedde would be initiated.\nPreparations\nGjedde would personally lead the flagship Elephanten, while Boschouver would be on board on the David. Additionally, the two warships the Christian and Kiobenhavn, which were Swedish prizes from the Kalmar War, would also be attached to the fleet. As vanguard, experienced Dutchman Roland Crappé would sail for Ceylon a couple of months before the rest of the expeditionary fleet.\nExpedition\nThe main expedition took sail in November 1618, however, the journey to India became very difficult, and they only reached Ceylon in 1620. Scurvy killed at least half of the crew before they reached the Cape of Good Hope in July 1619 and the expedition had trouble with navigation, and as no European navigational map was brought on to the expedition. Furthermore, the majority of the crews were Dutchmen, who were discontent with the inexperienced Danish leadership. At one point, Boschouver tried to sail away, however, he got caught and died before the expedition reached Ceylon.\nArrival of the Øresund\nAs a vanguard, Crappé arrived with the Øresund in Ceylon in late 1619 to prepare for the arrival of Gjedde. The Raja of Kandy, Senarath Adahasin, ordered Crappé to wage war against the Portuguese, which culminated in a confrontation off Karaikal. Seven smaller Portuguese frigates sought to regain some vessels Øresund had seized, and in the initial battle, she caught fire and sank. Subsequently, Crappé and some of his men would be imprisoned by the Portuguese authorities, while many other Danes would be beheaded. However, Crappé succeeded in getting in contact with an official from the local Thanjavurian kingdom, and together Crappé and 14 of his men managed to escape the imprisonment. The men now traveled to Thanjavur, where, through local friends, Crappé could get in an audience with the Nayak Raghunatha. After negotiations, the Nayak promised Crappé the small fishing village of Tharangambadi to the Danes, however, a treaty confirming the matter was first issued in 1620.\nArrival of Ove Gjedde\n().

While meeting the Raja, Gjedde was informed that Kandy had established peace with the Portuguese three years prior, and therefore no longer felt Danish assistance necessary. However, the Sinhalese still sought to investigate the Danes in case they were able to drive out the Portuguese from the island. Subsequently, Gjedde would sail north to Trincomalee where he would, on 24 Jun, start negotiations with the Raja's envoys. As a result of the changed circumstances, the negotiations did not bear fruit, and Gjedde therefore found it necessary to meet with Senerat personally. On 16 August, Gjedde reached Venthanen (modern-day Mahiyangana)  east of Kandy, where a meeting with Senerat took place. After shifting attitudes and intense negotiations, the two parties agreed to a treaty, in which Denmark–Norway would receive the port of Trincomalee. Additionally, the Danes were granted generous commercial privileges and were free to introduce Christianity to Trincomalee. After signing the treaty, Gjedde went to Trincomalee, left some Danes, including Erik Grubbe, and sailed to Thanjavur where he had been informed that Roland Crappé operated.\nGjedde at Thanjavur\nGjedde arrived at Tranquebar on 13 September 1620 and sent word to Crappé, who was at Thanjavur city, to secure the deal with Nayak Raghunatha. Weeks followed with negotiations and mutual presents, which culminated on 19 November with the signing of the treaty. Tranquebar was ceded to Denmark for two years, and the Danes were allowed to fortify the village.\nVoyage to Siam\nIn the following year, Crappé with the Kiobenhavn headed across the Bay of Bengal to Mergui, Ayutthaya Kingdom. The Danes were warmly welcomed, as Mergui was an important Siamese trading post. The voyage proved to be a great profit for the Danes as they could load their ships with pepper. With this load, Gjedde left for Copenhagen on 13 February 2021. On his home voyage, Gjedde visited Trincomalee and saw that there had been no progress made on the fortress since he left. Gjedde continued his voyage and reached Copenhagen on 4 March 1622.\nAftermath\nGjedde completed his partially completed his mission and returned with a reasonable cargo, enough to convince the shareholders to continue the enterprise. It must also be admitted that Gjedde could hardly achieve such without the experienced Roland Crappé. Gjedde's fortress of Dansborg would become a monument of his expedition and still stands today.\nReferences\nNotes\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
