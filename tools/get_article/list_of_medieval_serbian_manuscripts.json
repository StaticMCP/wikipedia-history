Containing important works attributed to Serbia or Serbs. The majority of works are theological, with a few biographies and constitutions.\nThe number of early Serbian manuscripts, that is, those made before the end of the 14th century, is estimated at 800–1,000.\nThe number of Serbian manuscripts dating between the 12th and 17th centuries that are located outside Serbia is estimated at 4,000–5,000. The largest number of the manuscripts are located in Europe. The largest and most important collection is housed at the Hilandar on Mount Athos. Next, the second largest collection is most likely found in Russia, where hundreds of manuscripts are held.
