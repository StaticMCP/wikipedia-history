The new station would be built south of PA Route 2028 (River Road), about  west of the historic railroad station of the same name. Passenger rail service into New Jersey and New York City would be provided by NJ Transit or Amtrak via the Lackawanna Cut-Off.\nParking would be available at the Pennsylvania welcome center, located southwest of Interstate 80. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania recently completed improvements to the welcome center. A park-and-ride facility, a five-level garage with about 900 spaces, would be built in the current parking area. The amount of parking for the welcome center would remain unchanged.\nPedestrians would walk between the station platform, located between the track and Interstate 80, and the parking site via River Road (Route 2028), which would be improved to handle the foot traffic. Cars coming from Interstate 80 would also use River Road.\nThe proposed location is just outside Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area.\nSee also\n*Lackawanna Cut-Off\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.njtransit.com/pdf/lackawanna_1105.pdf Lackawanna Cut-Off map]"
