      "text": "# 2012–13 Legia Warsaw season\n\nThe HUKS Legia Warsaw ice hockey team competed in the Polish 1. Liga during the 2012–2013 season under the traditional name Legia Warsaw. This marked their 10th season in the league and their 8th consecutive one.\nIn the 2012–13 regular season, HUKS Legia Warsaw finished fourth, qualifying for the playoffs to compete for the 1. Liga championship and a chance to advance to the Polska Hokej Liga. Over 24 matches, the team, nicknamed \"Wojskowi\" (\"The Military\"), secured 11 victories in regulation time and one in overtime, while losing 11 games in regulation and one in overtime, accumulating 36 points. They scored 79 goals and conceded 105, resulting in a goal difference of -26.\nThe team's leading scorer was  with 12 goals, followed closely by  with 11. The team did not participate in the 2012–13 Polish Cup.\nPre-season\nIn June 2012, head coach Zbigniew Stajak resigned to become General Secretary of the Polish Ice Hockey Federation. On 10 August 2012, the club's board met with players to address financial challenges and appoint a new coach, Jacek Szopiński, formerly of Podhale Nowy Targ. Pre-season training began on 14 August 2012, led by physical trainer Paweł Krajczyński.\nThe club's budget, estimated at 100,000 PLN, was lower than the previous season, threatening their participation. Financial difficulties prompted club president Piotr Demiańczuk to request the withdrawal of UHKS Mazowsze Legia Warsaw from the 1. Liga on 20 August. In response, Polish Ice Hockey Federation president  wrote an open letter to Warsaw mayor Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, urging support for the team, which upholds the legacy of Legia Warsaw, a 13-time Polish champion.\nIn September 2012, the club underwent organizational changes, renaming itself HUKS Legia Warsaw. Michał Wąsiński, father of players Karol and Patryk, was appointed sports director. An agreement with ITI Group allowed the continued use of the Legia name, and a deal with city authorities covered rink rental costs, enabling the team to register for the 1. Liga. The first on-ice training session took place on 17 September 2012, led by new coach Lubomir Witoszek, with 33 players participating. The team trained four times a week, using the rink courtesy of UHKS Mazowsze.\nIn January 2013, the club unveiled a new logo, incorporating the previous crest into a black-and-white circular emblem, with crossed hockey sticks at the bottom and 13 stars on the sides, symbolizing their championship titles.\nBudget\nLacking a primary sponsor, HUKS Legia Warsaw secured several sponsorship deals. On 8 August 2012, they partnered with ALL-House, a Warsaw-based renovation company. Another deal was signed with ARAS Arkadiusz Szaniawski, a construction firm. In January 2013, the club collaborated with Testa Communications, a marketing and PR agency, and WPC, a distributor of Pilot pens. The club also sought city funding, applying for 91,000 PLN for 2012 and 680,000 PLN for 2013 through Warsaw's Sports and Recreation Office, but the application was rejected on formal grounds.\nSingle-match tickets cost 10 PLN, while season tickets for home games were priced at 100 PLN. The club raised additional funds by selling merchandise, including jerseys, hoodies, and pucks. Before a football derby against Polonia Warszawa, Legia fans collected 6,620 PLN for the hockey and basketball sections, which was used to purchase equipment. Legia Warsaw footballer Jakub Rzeźniczak supported the hockey team by donating a signed team jersey for auction. The website Legia.net provided media patronage.\nTransfers\nPer league regulations, 1. Liga clubs could make transfers until 31 January 2013. Before the season, top scorers from the previous year,  and , were loaned to GKS Katowice, a Polska Hokej Liga newcomer. Other departures included Łukasz Blot to Naprzód Janów, Krzysztof Gutkowski to , Norbert Karamuz, Tomasz Grunwald (retired due to health issues), Mateusz Wiśniewski (returned to Toruń), and Krzysztof Rostkowski. Coach Zbigniew Stajak also left.\nThe team was bolstered by former Legia players, some resuming their careers: , Paweł Popielarz, Maciej Maryniak, Marcin Pawłowski, Tomasz Pawłowski, Adrian Maciejko, Bartosz Pióro, Jakub Kosobucki, Aleksander Holszański, and Tomasz Rostkowski. New additions included , Mateusz Solon, Maciej Młynarczyk, Mariusz Szaniawski, Mateusz Jendrasik, Ryszard Zdunek, and Belarusian player Ilja Weczer. Czech coach Lubomir Witoszek was appointed.\nAfter the sixth round, defenceman Michał Porębski joined from KH Energa Toruń, which had withdrawn from the league. He played 13 games for Nesta without scoring. On 26 October 2012, national team goalkeeper  signed, having previously played for TH Unia Oświęcim. In February 2013, before a playoff series against Polonia Bytom, Legia loaned Jakub Serwiński, Filip Pesta, and Oskar Lehmann from Hockey Club Gdańsk until the season's end.\nExhibition games\nOn 16 December 2012, Legia played an exhibition game against HC Bohumin, a Czech team from the Moravian-Silesian regional league, to prepare for the second half of the season. Safety concerns arose due to threats from fans of the Czech football club FC Baník Ostrava, but the match proceeded in Bohumin, with the hosts winning 6–3.\nHome arena\nHUKS Legia Warsaw played home games at the Arena COS Torwar ice rink, which meets International Ice Hockey Federation standards. The facility seats 640 spectators on plastic chairs and features a 60-by-30-metre ice surface. Due to high organizational costs in the 2012–13 season, attendance was capped at 299 to avoid mass event regulations. From 8 December 2012, after a game against SMS Sosnowiec, the club received approval to host mass events, lifting the attendance limit. The rink also hosts figure skating, curling, and amateur hockey.\nTeam roster\nThe 2012–13 roster comprised 36 players.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+Team roster\n!No.\n!Player\n!Birth date\n!Height/Weight\n!Previous club\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" |Goalkeepers\n|-\n|29\n|\n|22 May 1985\n|184 cm / 82 kg\n| TH Unia Oświęcim\n|-\n|31\n| Michał Strąk\n|17 January 1988\n|180 cm / 75 kg\n|Homegrown\n|-\n|39\n| Kamil Janiszek\n|5 January 1991\n|184 cm / 83 kg\n|Homegrown\n|-\n|1\n| Aleksander Holszański\n|25 January 1993\n|173 cm / 50 kg\n|Homegrown\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" |Defencemen\n|-\n|77\n|\n|4 February 1984\n|177 cm / 77 kg\n| STS Sanok\n|-\n|8\n| Maciej Maryniak\n|7 March 1986\n|182 cm / 81 kg\n|No club\n|-\n|20\n|\n|28 September 1986\n|188 cm / 90 kg\n| Stoczniowiec Gdańsk\n|-\n|12\n| Damian Kran\n|24 September 1992\n|195 cm / 93 kg\n|Homegrown\n|-\n|14\n| Marcin Pawłowski\n|3 November 1983\n|180 cm / 78 kg\n|Homegrown\n|-\n|82\n| Tomasz Pawłowski\n|12 May 1982\n|185 cm / 85 kg\n|Homegrown\n|-\n|?\n| Bartosz Pióro\n|4 March 1987\n|177 cm / 83 kg\n|No club\n|-\n|23\n|\n|24 July 1986\n|179 cm / 74 kg\n|Homegrown\n|-\n|44\n| Paweł Popielarz\n|18 December 1985\n|? cm / ? kg\n|No club\n|-\n|80\n| Michał Porębski\n|15 April 1989\n|177 cm / 79 kg\n| KH Energa Toruń\n|-\n|71\n| Patryk Pronobis\n|11 January 1990\n|174 cm / 70 kg\n| KH Energa Toruń\n|-\n|19\n|\n|26 November 1986\n|187 cm / 85 kg\n| STS Sanok\n|-\n|7\n| Maciej Stępski\n|2 February 1990\n|176 cm / 74 kg\n|Homegrown\n|-\n|21\n| Mariusz Szaniawski\n|1 June 1991\n|181 cm / 74 kg\n|Homegrown\n|-\n|9\n| Karol Szaniawski\n|1 December 1993\n|187 cm / 78 kg\n|Homegrown\n|-\n|28\n|  (C)\n|24 October 1988\n|184 cm / 88 kg\n|Homegrown\n|-\n|75\n| Aleksander Wolski\n|17 November 1994\n|? cm / ? kg\n|Homegrown\n|-\n|1\n| Oskar Lehmann\n|21 June 1992\n|176 cm / 73 kg\n| Hockey Club Gdańsk\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" |Forwards\n|-\n|21\n| Mateusz Jendrasik\n|1993\n|? cm / ? kg\n|Homegrown\n|-\n|10\n| Jakub Kosobucki\n|11 May 1986\n|183 cm / 81 kg\n|No club\n|-\n|51\n|\n|18 March 1987\n|180 cm / 77 kg\n| TMH Polonia Bytom\n|-\n|?\n| Tomasz Rostkowski\n|17 February 1988\n|182 cm / 73 kg\n|Homegrown\n|-\n|73\n| Grzegorz Rostkowski\n|27 June 1989\n|180 cm / 72 kg\n|Homegrown\n|-\n|17\n| Mateusz Solon\n|19 April 1990\n|172 cm / 73 kg\n| TMH Polonia Bytom\n|-\n|13\n| Bryan Świderski\n|18 March 1994\n|? cm / ? kg\n|\n|-\n|87\n| Ilja Weczer\n|18 April 1990\n|188 cm / 93 kg\n| HK Brest\n|-\n|18\n| Patryk Wąsiński\n|29 August 1990\n|177 cm / 75 kg\n| TMH Polonia Bytom\n|-\n|95\n|\n|19 January 1995\n|171 cm / 65 kg\n| TMH Polonia Bytom\n|-\n|11\n|\n|9 August 1979\n|185 cm / 86 kg\n| Naprzód Janów\n|-\n|22\n| Ryszard Zdunek\n|31 March 1976\n|176 cm / 72 kg\n| TMH Polonia Bytom\n|-\n|21\n| Jakub Serwiński\n|6 January 1992\n|180 cm / 79 kg\n| Hockey Club Gdańsk\n|-\n|99\n| Filip Pesta\n|9 October 1993\n|184 cm / 81 kg\n| Hockey Club Gdańsk\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" |Coaching staff\n|-\n|N/A\n| Lubomir Witoszek\n|23 December 1972\n|\n|Head coach\n|-\n|N/A\n| Robert Tchórzewski\n|21 June 1966\n|\n|Assistant coach\n|}\nRepresentation\nCoaches Andrei Parfionov and Jarosław Morawiecki selected 28 players for the Poland men's national under-20 ice hockey team training camp held in Sanok from 5 to 10 November 2012.
