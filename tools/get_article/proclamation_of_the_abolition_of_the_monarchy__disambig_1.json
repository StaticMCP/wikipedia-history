Their middle-class origin and their political activity meant that most of them bore no sympathy for the monarchy, and the victory at the Battle of Valmy on 20 September (the revolution's first military success) occurred on the same day as their meeting, thus confirming their convictions.\nProposition for abolition\nWhen the député for Paris, Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois, proposed abolition he met with little resistance; at most, Claude Basire, friend of Georges Danton, tried to temper the enthusiasm, recommending a discussion before any decision. However, Abbé Henri Grégoire, constitutional bishop of Blois, replied strongly to any suggestion of discussion:\nJean-François Ducos supported him in affirming that any discussion would be useless \"after the lights spread by 10 August\". The summary argument served as a debate and the decision taken was unanimous, giving birth to the French First Republic.\nEnd of an era\nIn the wake of the proclamation, efforts grew to eliminate the vestiges of the Ancien régime. As the date of the Republic's first anniversary approached, the Convention passed a set of laws replacing many familiar ancien systems of order and measurement, including the old Christian calendar. This dramatic change was powerful encouragement to the growing wave of anticlericalism which sought a dechristianisation of France. The new French Republican Calendar discarded all Christian reference points and calculated time from the Republic's first full day after the monarchy, 22 September 1792, the first day of Year One.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  [https://web.archive.org/web/20090329170901/http://hypo.ge-dip.etat-ge.ch/www/cliotexte/sites/Arisitum/textes/revol/royaute.html L'abolition de la royauté] Source : \"Journal officiel de la Convention Nationale\", 1792–1793."
