The Sikhs were victorious.\nBackground\nBudh Singh Sandhawalia accompanied by 4,000 horsemen was sent towards Attock to assist in putting down the Yusufzai Rebellion. When Budh Singh arrived at Hazro, he was challenged by Ashraf Khan of Zaida, Fateh Khan of Panjtar and Khadi Khan of Hund along with some Ghazis. The Ghazis fell back. Following this, a battle was fought at Shaidu.\nBattle\nOn the eve of the battle, the Peshawer Sardars betrayed Syed and he was poisoned by the servants of Yar Muhammad. However, he still requested his men to take him to the battlefield. For few days, the Sikh army remained in trenches, under assault of Mujahideen, who were mainly Pashtuns. The action by Sikh army commenced at about ten in the morning. Budh Singh was joined by Gulab Singh, Suchait Singh and Atariwala Sardars. The Sikh army with 30,000 combatants was numerically inferior to Pashtuns but superior in training and discipline. The Gulabnama claims that the Pashtuns numbered more than 100,000, however, actual number of fighters was probably around 30,000, as Peshawer valley could not provide more fighters in the early 19th century. Around 6,000 troops were killed or wounded on the side of the Pashtuns. Yar Muhammad along with his men deserted the Muslim ranks.\nAftermath\nFollowing this battle, several skirmishes occurred between tribes in one of which Yar Muhammad was killed.\nSee also\n* Battle of Akora Khattak\n* Battle of Haidru (1828)\n* Battle of Balakot\nReferences\nSource\n*"
