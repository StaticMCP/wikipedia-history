      "text": "# Edward A. Oppen\n\nEdward Augustus William Oppen was a Prussian-born philatelist who was the creator of one of the first stamp catalogues in English as well as the author of a number of foreign language textbooks. He taught at Haileybury College. In a stamp collecting journal, he was described as a \"...classical teacher\".\nPostage Stamp Album and Catalogue\nIn January 1863, Oppen published the first edition of his Postage Stamp Album, and Catalogue of British and Foreign Postage Stamps, which combined for the first time a stamp catalogue and stamp album in one book. The publication quickly went through many editions as news of new stamps reached collectors. There were two editions in 1863, and three in 1864–65, all edited by Henry Whymper. A review of the second edition noted that it was \"...much improved by that prince of engravers, Henry Whymper.\"\nAn 1865 review of the sixth edition recorded that the editor had included, with permission, information from Mount Brown, Dr Gray and Mr Pemberton (presumably E.L. Pemberton). A further twenty-eight editions followed, edited by Charles Viner.\nSelected other publications\n*A description of the Northern Territory of South Australia: carefully compiled from the various explorers' and surveyors' journals and charts.
