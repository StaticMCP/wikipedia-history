Scotland was allocated 72 seats in total, of which 70 were territorial seats, comprising 32 burgh constituencies and 37 county constituencies. There were also two university constituencies, Glasgow and Aberdeen Universities and Edinburgh and St Andrews Universities. As voters in university constituencies voted in addition to their territorial vote, the results are compiled separately.\nAlthough the Liberals, led by William Ewart Gladstone won a majority of the seats in Scotland, when combined with results from across the United Kingdom the Conservatives, led by Lord Salisbury again won the greatest number of seats, however they were no longer able to command a majority in the House of Commons. Salisbury refused to resign on hearing the election results and waited to be defeated in a vote of no confidence on 11 August. Gladstone formed a minority government dependent on Irish Nationalist support.\nThe election was the first election in Scotland to see meaningful attempts by groups associated with the trades union movement to win seats: the Scottish United Trades Councils Labour Party stood in four seats whilst the Scottish Labour Party (1888) stood in three seats. Neither group was able to win seats.\nResults\nSeats summary\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! style=\"width:200px\" colspan=3 | Party\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Seats\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Last Election\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Seats change\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFD700\" | &nbsp;\n| colspan=2 | Liberal\n| align=center| 51\n| align=center| 43\n| align=center|  8\n|-\n| rowspan=3 | &nbsp;\n| colspan=2 | Conservative and Liberal Unionist (Total)\n| align=center| 21\n| align=center| 29\n| align=center|  8\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#2061a2\" | &nbsp;\n|Liberal Unionist\n| align=\"center\" | 11\n| align=center| 17\n| align=center|  6\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#0087dc\" | &nbsp;\n|Conservative\n| align=\"center\" | 10\n| align=center| 12\n| align=center|  2\n|-\n| colspan=3 | Total\n| align=center| 72\n| align=center| 72\n| align=center|\n|}\nBurgh & County constituencies\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! style=\"width:100px\" colspan=2 | Party\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Seats\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Seats change\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Votes\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| %\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| % Change\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#FFD700\"|\n| Liberal\n| align=center|51\n| align=center|  8\n| align=center|256,944\n| align=center|53.9\n| align=center|  0.3\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#0281AA\"|\n| Conservative & Liberal Unionist\n| align=center| 19\n| align=center|  8\n| align=center| 209,944\n| align=center| 44.4\n| align=center|  2.0\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"red\"|\n| Scottish Trades Councils Labour\n| align=center| 0\n| align=center|\n| align=center| 2,313\n| align=center| 0.5\n| align=center|  0.5\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#B22222\"|\n| Scottish Parliamentary Labour\n| align=center| 0\n| align=center|\n| align=center| 2,043\n| align=center| 0.4\n| align=center|  0.4\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#D3D3D3\" | &nbsp;\n| Other\n| align=\"center\" | 0\n| align=\"center\" |\n| align=\"center\" | 3,886\n| align=\"center\" | 0.8\n| align=\"center\" |  0.8\n|-\n| colspan=2 | Total\n| align=center| 70\n| align=center|\n| align=center| 475,130\n| align=center| 100.0\n| align=center|\n|}\nUniversity constituencies\nThe two university constituencies each elected an additional member to the house.
