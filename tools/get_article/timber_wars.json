The show discusses the conservation movement that took place in the Pacific Northwest in the 1990s. The show discusses the complicated conflict between environmentalists and loggers that occurred during the period known as the timber wars. The show discusses the history of logging and how forests were viewed as potential tree farms. Foresters and dendrologists wanted to study and preserve old-growth forests, but were viewed negatively until the 1990s when large environmental protests began. At the same time, wildlife conservation for animals like the northern spotted owl became an issue. The show discusses a twenty-five year period of forestry and forest management. Aaron Scott is the host of the show—he grew up in Steamboat, Oregon not too far away from where the events of the show took place.\nEpisodes\nIntroductory episode\n| Aux1                =\n| ShortSummary        =\n| LineColor           = 0CAE00\n}}}}\nSeason 1\n| Aux1                =\n| ShortSummary        =\n| LineColor           = 0CAE00\n}}\n| Aux1                =\n| ShortSummary        =\n| LineColor           = 0CAE00\n}}\n| Aux1                =\n| ShortSummary        =\n| LineColor           = 0CAE00\n}}\n| Aux1                =\n| ShortSummary        =\n| LineColor           = 0CAE00\n}}\n| Aux1                =\n| ShortSummary        =\n| LineColor           = 0CAE00\n}}\n| Aux1                =\n| ShortSummary        =\n| LineColor           = 0CAE00\n}}\n| Aux1                =\n| ShortSummary        =\n| LineColor           = 0CAE00\n}}\n| Aux1                =\n| ShortSummary        =\n| LineColor           = 0CAE00\n}}\n| Aux1                =\n| ShortSummary        = This bonus episode is from the podcast called \"Grouse\"\n| LineColor           = 0CAE00\n}}\n| Aux1                =\n| ShortSummary        = This bonus episode is from the podcast called \"How to Save a Planet\"\n| LineColor           = 0CAE00\n}}\n| Aux1                =\n| ShortSummary        =\n| LineColor           = 0CAE00\n}}\n| Aux1                =\n| ShortSummary        = This episode features an interview with Suzanne Simard about the Social World of Trees\n| LineColor           = 0CAE00\n}}}}\nReception\nNicholas Kristof of The New York Times commented on the show saying that \"Listeners are left with both an appreciation of the magnificence of old growth forests and the toll paid by logging communities when those forests were protected. Environmentalists and loggers don't agree on much, but I think they will concur that 'Timber Wars' is fair and brilliant journalism.\"\nAwards\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Award\n!Date\n!Category\n!Result\n!Ref.\n|-\n|National Headliner Awards\n|2021\n|Narrative Podcast\n|\n|\n|-\n|MIT Knight Science Journalism Program's Victor K.
