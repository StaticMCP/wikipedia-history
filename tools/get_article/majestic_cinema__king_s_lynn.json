He worked closely with the architects John Lewis Carnell and William Dymoke White in the design and construction of the Majestic. Mr. Adams bought the contents of the Empire Theatre, Leicester Square, London (which was being demolished) and these, once restored, formed part of the interior of the Majestic. The 'Picture House' (as it was initially known) opened on May 23, 1928, with the silent film version of 'Ben Hur', starring Ramon Navarro. The ownership of the cinema later passed to Union and subsequently ABC Cinemas. The original ballroom was used as a venue by King George V for his Sandringham Hunt Balls.\n2001: Multiplex demolition proposal\nIn , a scheme to demolish the Majestic Cinema and build a Multiplex in its place was denied.
