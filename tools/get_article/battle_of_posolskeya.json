The following day, around 80 Cossacks and an armored train attacked a much smaller platoon of M Company, 27th Infantry, which managed to capture most of the attacking force while leaving the rest dead. Subsequently, the withdrawal of the expeditionary force continued as planned with no further obstructions.\nReferences"
