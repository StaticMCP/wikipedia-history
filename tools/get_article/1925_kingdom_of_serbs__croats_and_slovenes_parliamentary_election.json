The People's Radical Party remained the largest faction in National Assembly, winning 123 of the 315 seats, with Nikola Pašić remaining prime minister.\nResults\nAftermath\nIn April 1926, faced with a series of corruption scandals, Prime Minister Nikola Pašić was forced to resign. A member of Pašić's party Nikola Uzunović became the new prime minister of Yugoslavia on 8 April 1926, however faced with internal conflict within the party, a succession of short term governments, came and went under his watch.\nIn April 1927 Uzunović resigned from the office of prime minister, after the Croatian Peasant Party decided to leave his government. He was replaced by Velimir Vukićević, who was also a member of People's Radical Party.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110826204256/http://scindeks-clanci.nb.rs/data/pdf/0352-3160/2008/0352-31600802084P.pdf Nebojša A.
