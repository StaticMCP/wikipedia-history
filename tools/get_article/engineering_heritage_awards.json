For an object or artefact etc. to be considered for an award, an IMechE member would be required to complete a nomination form and submit it to the Institution. Upon submission, two referees would be appointed, one nominated by the Regional Committee where the object is located and a second independent referee. The submissions from both referees would then be reviewed by the Institution's Technical Support department before a decision was taken on the application.\nEngineering Heritage Awards (EHA)\nIn 2007, the Institution established the Heritage Committee to relaunch and promote the now renamed Engineering Heritage Awards. It simplified the application process, making it more transparent and with a quicker decision-making process. Furthermore, the criteria were changed, and the Institution's own library and information service became involved in the verification of details being submitted. The Award plaque was also redesigned (see below).\nEHHA and EHA plaques\nSince 1984, the plaques presented to EHHS and EHA recipients have changed four times. The original plaque was a blue ceramic disc approximately 40&nbsp;cm in wide. This was replaced in the 1990s by a rectangular steel plate mounted on a wooden base.\nWith the launch of the Engineering Heritage Awards in 2008, a new cast plaque was created. This was slightly modified in 2009 to reflect the rebranding of the Institution.\nFile:Eling Tide Mill 16 Sept 09 008.jpg|The Original EHHS Blue Plaque which was used until the early 1990s\nFile:Late EHHA Plaque design.JPG|The final EHHS Plaque design.
