      "text": "# The Eighteenth Century Commonwealthman\n\nThe Eighteenth-Century Commonwealthmen was written in 1959 by Caroline Robbins and traced the transmission of English republican and radical Whig ideas from the seventeenth century into the eighteenth, arguing that this intellectual tradition helped shape modern liberal and democratic thought.\nThe book looked at the British commonwealthmen tradition that although was decidedly whig had rejected Walpole and his successors whig ministries.  Particular attention to Cato's Letters and then looked at radical thought in Ireland, and then at radical dissenters such as Richard Price, Joseph Priestley and the opposition to the American War of Independence.\nThe book has been highly influential in the study of early modern political thought, shaping both the Cambridge School’s analysis of republican ideology and the work of American intellectual historians such as Bernard Bailyn who drew on Robbins's concept of the Commonwealthmen to trace the transmission of civic republican ideas into the political culture of the American Revolution.\nIt won the American Historical Association's Herbert Baxter Adams Prize in 1960.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
