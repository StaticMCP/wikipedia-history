Reed Jackson of Pitchfork magazine stated that Pop Smoke raps about threatening to fight with someone, declaring he wants to \"tie that boy up like a cowboy\". Pop Smoke raps: \"We gon' tie that boy up like a cowboy/I'm the one that they envy like Calboy/Broke bitches ain’t allowed/She wanna fuck with a real one, but real niggas back in style/I ain't no window shopper, your man out here window shoppin'/I be in all the stores, and no, we ain't window shoppin'.\"\nCritical reception\n\"Christopher Walking\" has been met with mainly positive reviews from music critics. Bianca Gracie of Paper magazine called the song a \"head-rushing hit\". Erin Lowers, writing for Exclaim!, described the track as \"fresh\", and said it is \"the power of short and sweet\".

Gary Suarez of Entertainment Weekly cited it as one of the highlight tracks off Meet the Woo 2.\nWriting for Stereogum, Tom Breihan opined that \"Christopher Walking\" has the same \"eerie singsong charisma\" as \"Window Shopper\", mentioning that it possesses the \"ability to be sweet but threatening at the same time\". He continued, saying the rapper has a \"sound as thick and dark and absorbing as his voice\", which sounds \"casual and conversational, cool and uncaring. But he also sounds like a horseman of the apocalypse.\" Breihan concluded by saying it is a \"strong combination\". \"Christopher Walking\" was praised by Complex Andre Gee, who described it as \"urgent\", \"cocky\", and so \"charismatic that certain lines stayed in our head all year\". He concluded by saying: \"The sheer force of Pop [Smoke's] vocal presence is impossible to deny, though.\" BrooklynVegan Andrew Sacher wrote when Pop Smoke declared himself \"the king of New York\", he \"already sounded believable\". Thomas Hobb of The Independent lauded the track as exhilarating, and opined it \"bottled the energy of free-falling between two skyscrapers, cape flapping behind, as the street-smart MC convincingly framed himself as a black superhero\".\nYear-end lists\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+\"Christopher Walking\" on year-end lists\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Publication\n! scope=\"col\"| List\n! scope=\"col\"| Rank\n! scope=\"col\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Complex\n| The Best Songs of 2020\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| The Guardian\n| Best Music of 2020\n|\n| }}\n|}\nMusic video\nA music video for \"Christopher Walking\" was released the same day as the song.
