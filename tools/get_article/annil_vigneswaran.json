At the age of ten, he spent one year with Dutch side Ajax, before returning to Malaysia to join the Kuala Lumpur Youth Soccer (KLYS) team.\nMove to Germany\nAt the age of fourteen, Annil was scouted by German side SGV Freiberg, and eventually moved to Germany to join the club. In February 2022, he joined 2. Bundesliga side Sandhausen.\nFor the 2022–23 season, he joined Oberliga Baden-Württemberg side Freiburger, but was assigned to the club's second team in the Landesliga Südbaden 2.\nInternational career\nIn October 2021, he received a surprise call up to the Malaysia national under-23 football team, having not attended any of the training camps in Malaysia. This call up was criticised by fans, with then-coach Brad Maloney coming to Vigneswaran's defence, saying \"assistant coach, Khan Hung Meng used to train this player before he went to Germany a few years ago and he was seen as a very talented player and since then, his performance has started to be monitored.\"\nReferences"
