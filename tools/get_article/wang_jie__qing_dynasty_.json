Born in Hancheng county in Shaanxi province, he was celebrated as \"the most famous minister from Shaanxi\".\nWang obtained the position of zhuangyuan (the jinshi who ranked first) in the imperial examination and was selected a xiuzhuan (修撰) of the Hanlin Academy in 1761. He had served as Secretary of Cabinet (內閣學士), Vice Minister of Justice (刑部侍郎), Junior Censor-in-Chief (右都御史), Minister of War (兵部尚書), and Grand Councillor. Since 1786 he was made the chief tutor of the Palace School (上書房總師傅) for imperial princes, including the later Jiaqing Emperor. He was appointed the Grand Secretary of the Eastern Library in charge of the Ministry of Rites. He had made an exceptional contribution in Pacification of Taiwan and Gorkha, thus his portrait was painted twice in the Hall of Military Merits, known as Ziguangge (紫光閣).\nWang was described as an upright man. Seo Yu-mun (), a Korean diplomat who had joined the Dongzhi Festival mission () to Qing China as a Seojanggwan (서장관, 書狀官, the third of the mission) in 1798, reported that \"Heshen has been in power for decades. From the local government to the imperial court, almost every minister fawned over him. Wang Jie, Liu Yong, Dong Gao, Zhu Gui (朱珪), Ji Yun, Tiebao (鐵保), Yubao (玉保) and others are exceptions.\"\nPublications\n*''Pao-ch'un ko chi'' (葆淳閣集; 1815)\nReferences"
