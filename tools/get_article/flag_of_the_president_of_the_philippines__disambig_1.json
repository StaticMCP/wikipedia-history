While having the same design as the presidential seal since 1947, the flag has a separate history, and the designs on the flag and seal have at different times influenced each other. The flag is often displayed beside the president in official portraits, flown next to the coffin of a deceased president in state funerals, and flown on the president's motorcade. It is also customarily used during diplomatic visits in the review of honor guards. A lone honor guard traditionally holds the presidential flag while tailing  the president of the Philippines and the visiting foreign leader. The flag design is similar to that of the flag of the president of the United States.\n1935 flag\nThe first presidential standard was introduced during the presidency of Manuel Quezon in 1935, following the inauguration of the Philippine Commonwealth. Patterned after the U.S. presidential flag, the standard featured the Commonwealth coat of arms emblazoned on a navy blue field, with a five-pointed star in each of the four corners. The stars held no particular meaning.\nThis flag was said to have been based on the flag of the American Governor-General, which was itself inspired by the 1912 design of the U.S. presidential standard.\n1946 flag\nIn 1946, following the inauguration of the Third Philippine Republic, the coat of arms of the Commonwealth was replaced with the new coat of arms of the republic, designed by Galo Ocampo. The four stars in the corners were retained. The new coat of arms had the following blazon:\n1947 flag\nOn January 7, 1947, President Manuel Roxas signed Executive Order No. 38, which provided for the coat of arms, seal, and flag of the President of the Philippines. The national coat of arms was replaced by the introduction of the presidential arms, also designed by Galo Ocampo, featuring the Philippine sun and a golden sea-lion (ultramar) on a red equilateral triangle, with five-pointed stars at each corner.\nSection 3 of the order states that “the color and flag of the President of the Philippines shall consist of a dark blue background of sizes and proportions to conform to military and naval custom,” and that “the proportions of the elements of the coat of arms shall be in direct relation to the hoist and the fly shall vary according to the customs of the military and naval services.” While the order made no explicit mention of the use of four corner stars, they were nevertheless retained in practice.\n1951 flag\nOn July 4, 1951, during the celebration of the fifth anniversary of Philippine independence, President Elpidio Quirino issued Executive Order No. 457, amending Section 1 of the 1947 Roxas order to feature the presidential coat of arms surrounded by a ring of stars corresponding to the number of provinces of the Philippines as of the date of signing. This change followed the American practice of adding stars after new states were admitted to the union, adopted following their design revision in 1945.\nAlthough the stars in the official design were specified to be golden yellow, the reproduced flags that came into use featured white stars instead, an inconsistency that persisted until the flag's design was standardized in 2004. Subsequent designs continued this practice, increasing the number of stars in the ring each time new provinces were created.\n1981 flag\nIn 1981, Ferdinand Marcos had the presidential standard redesigned along with the seal, replacing the ultramar sea-lion with an eagle inside an inverted triangle.\nNo enabling order is known to have officially adopted the design, but it remained in use until Marcos was ousted by the People Power Revolution in 1986.\nRestoration of the 1951 design\nAfter the EDSA revolt, President Corazon Aquino abolished the use of many symbols associated with the Marcos regime, particularly the presidential seal and flag. The design was reverted to the 1951 version, but the navy blue field was changed to a lighter shade. Ambiguity in the issuances regarding the design’s details and inconsistencies in the production of the standard continued in succeeding administrations until that of President Arroyo in 2004.\nCurrent flag\nand Pope Francis during the latter's state visit to the Philippines.]]\nThe current flag is defined in Executive Order No. 310 signed by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo:\nReproduction\nThe manufacturing, reproduction, sale, purchase for sale, use, display, or possession in commercial quantities of the presidential standard is strictly prohibited, including its use on stationery, business cards, identification cards, or any other items, except as permitted under the exceptions provided in Section 3 of Executive Order No. 310, s. 2004.\nSee also\n*President of the Philippines\n*Flag of the vice president of the Philippines\n*Seal of the president of the Philippines\n*Flag of the Philippines\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.quezon.ph/?p=111 The Presidential Seal]\n* [https://op-proper.gov.ph/ Official website of the Office of President of the Republic of the Philippines]"
