Engineered by Delano “Rock” McLaurin and released on March 25, 1979, this song is often cited as the beginning of recorded hip hop music. The title refers to vocalist Tim Washington. A few months later, \"Rapper's Delight\" came out, which is widely regarded as the first commercially released hip hop song.\nThe song was originally the B-side of the 7-inch single, with the A-side \"You're My Candy Sweet\" a mid-tempo disco song. However the song stalled at #67 after 4-weeks on the R&B chart and was replaced the following week with \"King Tim III (Personality Jock)\" on the chart. It peaked at #26 on the R&B chart and stayed on for 11 weeks.\nOrigins\nBill Curtis and Gerry Thomas were in the studio recording Fatback XII and Curtis didn't think the album had a hit.
