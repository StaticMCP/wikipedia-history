He finished his career at Handsworth Parramore and is now retired.\nCareer\nWarne began his career as a trainee with Chesterfield in 2001. He made four first-team appearances in the 2002–03 campaign, and was given a professional contract in July 2003. Naturally right footed and operating mainly in the centre of midfield Warne has the ability to play across the midfield in a variety of positions and has been a regular and success at all the clubs he has played for.\nWarne made his professional debut for Chesterfield in the football league trophy against Port Vale on 12 November 2002 and went on to make 3 more appearances that year against Barnsley, Swindon and Wigan. Due to changes in the management in following seasons Warne was struggling to find opportunities for playing time and after spells on loan with Worksop Town and Matlock Town, he was released by Chesterfield at the end of the 2003–04 season and joined Conference North club Hucknall Town.\nReleased two months later, he signed for Matlock Town for the second time. In October 2007, Warne moved on to Conference North side Alfreton Town, but failed to settle and returned to Matlock at the end of the season.\nWarne eventually moved to Belper Town permanently in 2012 after being on loan with them for a brief spell in the 2011 season and helped the club to promotion to the Northern Premier League in the 2013–14 season through the play-offs. He joined Handsworth Parramore in July 2015.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
