It was on the northern side of Augustines Road (). In 1925, it was relocated to a new site near the O'Bil Bil railway station. In 1928, it was renamed O'Bil Bil State School. It closed circa 1964. It was at 80 O'Bil Bil Road ().\nThe Mungar Junction to Monto railway line opened in stages with the section from Mundubbera  to Ceratodus opening on 26 April 1924, with Malmoe railway station serving the locality ().
