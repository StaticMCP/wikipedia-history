New Jersey voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote, pitting the Republican nominee, businessman Donald Trump, and running mate Indiana Governor Mike Pence against Democratic nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and her running mate Virginia Senator Tim Kaine. New Jersey has 14 electoral votes in the Electoral College.\nClinton won the state with 55.5% of the vote over Trump's 41.35%, or a 14-point margin. Despite her victory in the state, Clinton's vote share was slightly poorer than the vote shares President Barack Obama got from the state in 2008 and 2012. This was the first time since 1976 that New Jersey did not vote for the same candidate as neighboring Pennsylvania, and the first time since 1932 that New Jersey voted Democratic while Pennsylvania voted Republican. Donald Trump became the first Republican to win the White House without carrying Somerset County since Benjamin Harrison in 1888.\nPrimary elections\nNew Jersey's presidential primaries were on June 7, 2016, with the Democratic, Republican, and Libertarian parties participating. Registered members of each party could only vote in their party's primary, while voters who were unaffiliated could choose any 1 primary in which to vote.\nDemocratic primary\nTwo candidates appeared on the Democratic presidential primary ballot:\n*Bernie Sanders\n*Hillary Clinton\nRepublican primary\n3 candidates appeared on the Republican presidential primary ballot:\n*Ted Cruz (withdrawn prior to primary)\n*John Kasich (withdrawn prior to primary)\n*Donald Trump\nGeneral election\nPredictions\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Source\n!Ranking\n!As of\n|-\n|align=\"left\" |Los Angeles Times\n|\n| November 6, 2016\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |CNN\n|\n|November 4, 2016\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Cook Political Report\n|\n|November 7, 2016\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Electoral-vote.com\n|\n|November 8, 2016\n|-\n| align=left | Rothenberg Political Report\n|\n| November 7, 2016\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Sabato's Crystal Ball\n|\n|November 7, 2016\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |RealClearPolitics\n|\n|November 8, 2016\n|-\n|align=\"left\" |Fox News\n|\n|November 7, 2016\n|}\nCandidate ballot access\n* Hillary Clinton/Tim Kaine, Democratic\n* Donald Trump/Mike Pence, Republican\n* Darrell L.

Overall, the trend from 2012 to 2016 was that suburban areas of central and northern New Jersey voted more Democratic, while the shore and southern New Jersey voted more Republican. Clinton's most notable improvements over Obama in 2012 were seen in Union, Somerset, and Morris Counties. In Morris, Clinton came within 5% of winning the county, which had not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1964, and would later vote Democratic in 2020. Clinton's stronger performance in the suburban towns of north-central New Jersey, such as Summit, Westfield, and Bridgewater, helped her narrowly win the 7th congressional district.\nOn the other hand, southern New Jersey, especially Cumberland County and Salem County, voted significantly more Republican than they had in 2012. For example, even though Cumberland County voted Democratic in both 2012 and 2016, Clinton won it by just 6%, whereas Obama won it by nearly 24% in 2012. Meanwhile, Trump flipped Salem County after Obama won it in 2012, and he also was the first Republican to win Gloucester County since 1988. Additionally, the four shore counties of Monmouth, Ocean, Atlantic, and Cape May all voted more Republican than they had in 2012, as Mitt Romney had won these four counties collectively by around 6% in 2012, but Trump won them by 17% in 2016.\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in New Jersey\n* First presidency of Donald Trump\n* 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries\n* 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries\n* Statewide opinion polling for the 2016 United States presidential election in New Jersey\nReferences"
