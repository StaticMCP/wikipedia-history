After the Roman Senate ordered his books burned, Liberius committed suicide. Caligula later lifted the ban on Liberius's books.\nLife\nAlmost nothing is known of his early life.  He was of the Labiena gens and grew up poor.\nDuring his lifetime, Augustus had become the first Roman emperor. Titus Labienus opposed Augustus, however, and even supported the non-existent Pompeian cause.\nTitus Labienus, in his historical works, criticized Rome's class structure, which led to his insulting epithet, Rabienus (\"Mad Dog\"). His writings contained anti-imperial material, thus, when he recited his works in public, he would have to omit certain sections. Instead, he said that these unread sections should be read after his death. Despite all of this, Titus Labienus was recognized as a great orator.\nDuring his waning years, Roman Emperor Augustus, who did not push censorship during most of his reign, began to put strict regulations on writing and began to censor writings. These new regulations upset Titus Labienus, as he wanted to write and teach without government restrictions.\nDuring the last decade of his rule, Augustus created laws with punishments for those voicing a dissenting opinion against the state in writing. Depending on how guilty one was or how serious the crime was, either one or all of one's life works were to be burned.\nIt was teachers like Titus Labienus who were affected by this censorship, which led to his trial from A.D. 6 to 8, the first of its kind, where the Roman Senate found him guilty of  literary treason.\nDeath\nUpon hearing that he was guilty of literary treason and that his library was to be burnt, Titus Labienus decided to kill himself.  He went to the ancestors' mausoleum, walled himself up, and committed suicide. He refused cremation of his body.\nLegacy\nWith his death, attention was brought to imperial censorship.\nSome 30 years later, Caligula began rolling back some of this censorship, yet simultaneously, he still pushed this censorship. He permitted the works of Titus Labienus, along with several others, like Cassius Severus, to be read, saying that it was best to have all events recorded.\nNear the end of the century, his works were listed as standard teaching material by the educator and rhetorician Quintilian.Frederick H.
