During his reign he received plenty of state visits from foreign heads of state, all of which were from European countries, including the first state visit to Britain by a President of the French Republic. The state banquets for the visiting heads of state were held at either Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle. A state visit normally included formal reception of the City of London at Guildhall. The King also received many less formal visits from foreign heads of state to Britain, including a visit of Shah Mozaffar ad-Din of Persia to Portsmouth in August 1902 and one of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia to Cowes in August 1909.\nList of visits\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n!No.\n!class=\"unsortable\" | Date\n!Country\n!Regime\n!class=\"unsortable\" | Guests\n!Venue for State Banquet\n|-\n| 1\n| 6–9 July 1903\n|\n| Republic\n| President Émile Loubet\n| Buckingham Palace\n|-\n| 2\n| 17–21 November 1903\n|\n| Monarchy\n| King Victor Emmanuel IIIQueen Elena\n| Windsor Castle\n|-\n| 3\n| 15–21 November 1904\n|\n| Monarchy\n| King Carlos IQueen Amélie\n| Windsor Castle\n|-\n| 4\n| 5–10 June 1905\n|\n| Monarchy\n| King Alfonso XIII\n| Buckingham Palace\n|-\n| 5\n| 13–20 November 1905\n|  Greece\n| Monarchy\n| King George I\n| Windsor Castle\n|-\n| 6\n| 12–19 November 1906\n|\n| Monarchy\n| King Haakon VIIQueen Maud\n| Windsor Castle\n|-\n| 7\n| 8–13 June 1907\n|\n| Monarchy\n| King Frederick VIIIQueen Louise\n| Buckingham Palace\n|-\n| 8\n| 11–18 November 1907\n|\n| Monarchy\n| Emperor Wilhelm IIEmpress Augusta Victoria\n| Windsor Castle\n|-\n| 9\n| 25–29 May 1908\n|\n| Republic\n| President Armand Fallières\n| Buckingham Palace\n|-\n| 10\n| 16–21 November 1908\n|\n| Monarchy\n| King Gustaf VQueen Victoria\n| Windsor Castle\n|-\n| 11\n| 15–22 November 1909\n|\n| Monarchy\n| King Manuel II\n| Windsor Castle\n|}\nSee also\n*List of official overseas trips made by Edward VII\n*List of state visits received by Queen Victoria\n*List of state visits received by George V\nNotes\nSources"
