Certain expediencies were taken within the existing structure of the Federal government, such as conscription and other violations of civil liberties, including the internment and later dispersal of Japanese-Americans. Still, elections were held as scheduled in 1944.\nOverview\nThe United States entered World War II with the  Administration that had been at the helm of the nation since 1932, that of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. This administration had been preparing for war for a while by the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.\nPresident of the United States\nPresident Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Vice President Henry A. Wallace won the election of 1940, and were at the helm of the nation as it prepared for and entered World War II. Roosevelt sought and won an unprecedented fourth term in office in 1944, but this time with Harry S. Truman as his Vice President. Roosevelt, who had been a victim of Guillain-Barré Syndrome early in life, died in April 1945, and Truman assumed the Presidency through the end of the war.\nCabinet\n*Secretary of State\n**Cordell Hull pre-war to November 1944\n**Edward Stettinius to war's ending a WW2\n*Secretary of the Interior\n**Harold Ickes throughout the war\n*Secretary of Commerce\n**Jesse H.
