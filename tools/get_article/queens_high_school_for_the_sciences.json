With an enrollment of only 498 pupils, it admits students based on their performance on the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT) and is the only specialized high school serving the borough of Queens.\nSharing a campus with York College and inhabiting the second floor of the science building, QHSS was founded in 2002 along with the High School for Math, Science and Engineering at City College and the High School of American Studies at Lehman College. QHSS is a member of the National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology (NCSSSMST).\nIn 2024, the U.S. News & World Report ranked QHSS as the #1 high school in New York State and #25 nationwide. According to the 2023-2024 school performance dashboard, the school enjoys high percentile graduation rates, test scores, advanced course participation rates, and attendance statistics compared to other NYCDOE high schools, however, the school quality snapshot of the same school year found that teachers at the high school had significantly deteriorated trust in the school's leadership.\nAcademics\nQHSS places an emphasis on the sciences and mathematics as part of its college-preparatory curriculum. The curriculum is centered about the Regents and Advanced Placement exams; the school generates some of the highest test scores in the country. As a New York City Department of Education high school, QHSS requires 44 credits to graduate with a New York State Regents diploma. Requirements for the Advanced Regents Diploma are set by New York State.\nSome students participate in mentorships and internships to develop research projects presented in various fairs and symposiums throughout the US, including the International Science and Engineering Fair.\nExtracurriculars\nThe school features a wide variety of extracurriculars, including many clubs and a few sports teams. These clubs may vary from year-to-year as many of them are extremely new. These clubs include QHSS Alchemists, QHSS Music Makers, Key Club, Model UN, Robotics Club, Asian American Association, Veritas Literary Magazine, Amnesty International, Esports Club, Gender Sexuality Alliance, No Place For Hate, Chess Club, Muslim Student Association, QHSS ACT!, CardinalFOSS, American Red Cross, Green Team and QHSS Bookworms.\nQHSS also has a bowling and swimming team fielded by the Public School Athletic League.\nHistory\nIn June 2006, founding principal Brian Jetter retired, and Jie Zhang took his place. In June 2011, Principal Jie Zhang was transferred to Stuyvesant High School, and Dr. David Marmor took her place. Dr. Marmor left after the 2012–13 school year and the position was then held by Lenneen Gibson as Principal until October 2016, where she was then temporarily replaced by B.D. Anthony. The principal is now Ana De Jesus, who became principal in November 2016.\nMarch 2022 bomb scare\nOn Monday, March 7, 2022, an anonymous caller sent a bomb threat to York College, which the high school's campus resides on. Students were evacuated around 11am to a local high school.\nJune 2025 assistant principal allegations\nIn June 2025, the New York Post reported that an assistant principal at QHSS was accused of sexually harassing multiple female students. The Department of Education stated that the administrator was reassigned pending investigation.\nTransportation\nThe New York City Subway's Sutphin Boulevard–Archer Avenue–JFK Airport station is located nearby, as well as several New York City Bus routes. Students residing a certain distance from the school are provided full-fare student OMNY cards for public transportation on their first day of school.\nSchool climate\nIn the New York City Department of Education’s 2024 School Quality Guide, QHSS scored significantly below citywide averages on measures of teacher–principal trust. Only 28% of teachers reported trust in the principal, compared to a citywide average of 81%. On teacher influence in school decision-making, QHSS scored 33%, compared to 68% citywide, and on instructional leadership 40%, compared to 84% citywide.\nFacilities\nThe school collaborates with York College in an agreement that allows the high school students to access campus facilities including the library, science and computer labs, theater, cafeteria, and physical education building. QHSS is housed on the second floor of the college's science building.\nIn 2025, the New York Post reported that students, parents, and faculty launched a campaign to relocate QHSS to a new high school building under construction at 165-18 Hillside Avenue.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://tools.nycenet.edu/snapshot/0/28Q687/HS/?utm_source=schools.nyc.gov&utm_medium=Public_Page&utm_campaign=School_Page 2023 School Quality Snapshot]"
