The term \"War Between the States\" was a name for the American Civil War espoused by the Lost Cause of the Confederacy. The museum's collection includes firearms, uniforms, swords, armor, personal items, books, and documents. Photographs of American Civil War soldiers, government officials, civilians, and sailors line the museum's walls. The collection includes items from the Florence Stockade, a Confederate prison camp.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054947/http://peedeerifles.homestead.com/wbtsmuseum.html War Between the States Museum]"
