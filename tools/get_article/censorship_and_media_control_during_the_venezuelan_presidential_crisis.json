      "text": "# Censorship and media control during the Venezuelan presidential crisis\n\nThere was censorship and media control during the Venezuelan presidential crisis between 2019 and January 2023.\nA crisis concerning who was the legitimate president of Venezuela began on 10 January 2019, when the opposition-majority National Assembly declared that incumbent Nicolás Maduro's 2018 reelection was invalid and the body declared its president, Juan Guaidó, to be acting president of the nation. The process and results of the May 2018 Venezuelan presidential election were widely disputed. The National Assembly declared Maduro illegitimate on the day of his second inauguration, citing the 1999 Constitution of Venezuela enacted under Hugo Chávez, Maduro's predecessor; in response, the pro-Maduro Supreme Tribunal of Justice said the National Assembly's declaration was unconstitutional.\nMaduro's government stated that the crisis was a \"coup d'état led by the United States to topple him and control the country's oil reserves\". Guaidó denied the coup allegations, saying peaceful volunteers backed his movement.\nSince the beginning of the presidential crisis, Venezuela was exposed to frequent \"information blackouts\", periods without access to internet or other news services during important political events. The National Assembly and Guaido's speeches were regularly disrupted, television channels and radio programs were censored and many journalists were illegally detained. The Venezuelan press workers union reported that in 2019 40&nbsp;journalists had been illegally detained as of 12 March. As of June 2019, journalists were denied access to seven sessions of the National Assembly by the National Guard.\nMost Venezuelan television channels are controlled by the state, and information unfavorable to the government is not covered completely. Newspapers and magazines are scarce, as most are unable to afford paper to print. The underfunded web infrastructure has led to slow Internet connection speeds.\nThe information blackouts have promoted the creation of underground news coverage that is usually broadcast through social media and instant message services like WhatsApp. The dependence of Venezuelans on social media has also promoted the spread of disinformation and pro-Maduro propaganda.\nVenezuela got the rank 148 of 180 in the World Press Freedom Index of Reporters Without Borders in 2019. The country went down five places since 2018.\nThe Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) made a call to the Maduro administration to reestablish television and radio channels that had been closed, cease on the restrictions to Internet access, and protect the rights of journalists.\nIn 2022, pro-government deputy  admitted that the government blocked digital outlets.\nInternet, television, and radio\n2019\nSeveral sources reported that starting 12 January 2019 until 18 January, internet access to Wikipedia (in all languages) was blocked in Venezuela after Guaidó's page on the Spanish Wikipedia was edited to show him as president. The block mainly affected the users of the state-run CANTV, the national telecommunications company and largest provider of the country. Several media outlets have suggested that Wikipedia directly or indirectly was taking sides with either group.* *\nshowing blocks of Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube on 21 January 2019]]\nLater on 21 January, the day of a National Guard mutiny in Cotiza, internet access to some social media like Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube was reported blocked for CANTV users. The Venezuelan government denied it had engaged in blocking.\nDuring the 23 January protests, widespread internet outages for CANTV users were reported, with Wikipedia, Google Search, Facebook, Instagram, and many other social media platforms affected. The widespread regional internet blackouts occurred again on 26 to 27 January.\nCanal 24 Horas, a news channel owned by Chile's public broadcaster, TVN, was removed from Venezuela's cable and satellite television operators by the state-run National Commission of Telecommunications (Conatel) on 24 January. Conatel removed 24 Horas once again during the 23 February conflicts in the Venezuelan frontier, no reason was given.\nSince 22 January, Conatel has repeatedly advised against the promotion of violence and the disavowing of institutional authorities, according to the Law on Social Responsibility on Radio and Television imposed in 2004. Some radio programs have been ordered off air, including Cesar Miguel Rondón's radio program, one of the most listened-to programs in the country. Other programs have been temporarily canceled or received censorship warnings, including a threat to close private television and radio stations if they recognize Guaidó as acting president or interim president of Venezuela.*  www.ntn24.com|language=es|access-date=31 January 2019}}*\nDuring the Venezuela Aid Live concert on 22 February, NatGeo and Antena 3 Internacional were removed from cable and satellite TV for broadcasting the concert. Access to YouTube was also blocked for CANTV users during the concert.\nWithout clear reason, Twitter was blocked for CANTV users on 27 February, and again on 4 March, with Guaido's return from his regional trip. The access to SoundCloud was also restricted all along between both dates. NetBlocks suspects that the first censorship on the 27th was related either to a SoundCloud recording published by Guaidó on Twitter or to a viral video showing several delegates leaving the UN Human Rights Council meeting during Jorge Arreaza speech. Soundcloud access was restricted during the following 3 months.\nWithout any official statement from Conatel, the German state owned TV channel, Deutsche Welle (DW) in Spanish, was blocked from Venezuelan cable networks from 14 to 15 April. Conatel had already censored the DW signal once before in 2018 during the broadcast of a documentary titled \"Venezuela—Escape from a Failed State\".\nDuring the 2019 Venezuelan uprising of 30 April, Juan Guaidó led a group of civilian and military forces in an uprising against Nicolás Maduro. Shortly after the announcement, NetBlocks reported that multiple social media and news websites were censored by the state-run CANTV internet provider. Internet service was restored 20 minutes before a live speech of Nicolás Maduro. During the clashes, the signal of BBC World News and CNN  was pulled off air from all cable providers ordered by Conatel. According to CNN, it was blocked one minute after its live feed showed government VN-4s running over protesters. Venezuela's oldest private local radio station Radio Caracas Radio (RCR) was also ordered off air. Broadcast issues and internet disruptions followed during the protests of 1 May.\nThe IACHR communication expressed that \"freedom of expression applies to the Internet in the same way as it does to all communication media\" and consider Internet restrictions as an \"extreme measure-analogous to the prohibition of a newspaper or a radio or television station\". The report emphasizes that \"such blockades or restrictions cannot be justified, not even for reasons of public order or national security\". The IACHR rapporteur also explained that the \"adjudication, revocation, and renewal of licenses must be established by law and guided by objective, clear, impartial, and public criteria compatible with a democratic society; the process must be transparent; the decision that grants or denies the request must be duly motivated; and be subject to adequate judicial control\".\nCommittee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) South coordinator, Natalie Southwick, has criticized the recent situation in Venezuela: \"We are alarmed by the increasingly brazen censorship in Venezuela, including the repeated and selective restriction of internet access, a popular tool of authoritarian regimes. Venezuelan authorities should ensure that all internet platforms and news outlets—digital, radio, and television—are available to citizens seeking to access and share information\".\nEdgar Zambrano vice-minister of the National Assembly and ally of Guaidó was detained by the Bolivarian Intelligence Service (SEBIN) on 8 May. During the three hours after his detention, NetBlocks reported disruption of YouTube and Google services for CANTV users.\nIn June, the Venezuelan news website La Patilla was charged with \"moral charges\" and a fine of 30 billion bolivars (about $5m dollars) after publishing an ABC News article about drug traffic in Venezuela, that implicated the president of the pro-Maduro 2017 Constituent National Assembly, Diosdado Cabello. The website director Alberto Federico Ravell, supporter of Juan Guaidó, wrote that Cabello was engaging in \"judicial terrorism\". Cabello also added that he will take control of the website if it was unable to pay. Cabello had previously tried to raise judicial processes against ABC and The Wall Street Journal for accusations of drug trafficking, but the cases were rejected. Nathalie Southwick (CPJ) considers that the measure against La Patilla is an \"attempt to bankrupt and shut down a critical outlet\" and provides an \"example of how the Venezuelan judicial system is being used to retaliate against critical media\".\nWithout any previous judiciary order, the access to online newspapers El Pitazo and Efecto Cocuyo, through national and private internet providers, was blocked during the visit of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) chief Michelle Bachelet to Venezuela in June.\n2020\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in Venezuela, the National Assembly created a webpage to provide information on the coronavirus disease to the public. The access to the site was restricted for CANTV users. The censorship was denounced by Guaidó.\nOn 1 April, the website AlbertoNews was indefinitely restricted after a coverage of  (Operation Knock-Knock), a search and seizure operation by the Maduro administration.\nLive speeches disrupted\nLive streams of the National Assembly sessions and Guaidó's speeches and appearances have been regularly disrupted for CANTV users since the end of January, mainly affecting access to streaming platforms like Periscope, Bing, Twitter video, and YouTube, along with some other Google services. DNS blocking is employed to generate the disruptions. The longest block of YouTube to date started during an Assembly session on 6 March, lasting 20 hours.\nAfter the events of 23 February to ship of humanitarian aid to Venezuela, Guaidó and Colombian President Iván Duque's evening speech in Las Tienditas Bridge was similarly blocked for CANTV users in Venezuela. More disruptions recurred during the Lima Group session on the 24th and during the US Vice President Mike Pence's speech on 25 February.\nAnother disruption on 15 April, affecting only CANTV users, occurred during the live stream of the press conference about Venezuela's crisis of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Duque in Cúcuta.\nVenezuelan politician Leopoldo López, detained during the 2014 protests and under house arrest by Maduro administration was released by pro-Guaidó military during the 30 April uprising. López and his family sought refuge in the Spanish embassy in Caracas. On 2 May, the disruption of internet services resumed during a press-conference where López spoke about his discussions with mid-military officers to oppose Maduro administration.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\"\n|+Disrupted live streamed speeches in 2019-2020\n!Year\n!Month\n!Day\n!Event\n|-\n| rowspan=\"36\" |2019\n| rowspan=\"2\" |January\n|27\n|Guaido's speech\n|-\n|29\n|National Assembly session\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" |February\n|12\n|Guaidó's speech during International Youth Day\n|-\n|18\n|Guaidó's speech\n|-\n|22\n|Venezuela Aid Live and joint press conference of Guaidó and the presidents of Chile, Colombia and Paraguay\n|-\n|23\n|Guaidó and Duque's speech\n|-\n|24\n|Guaidó's reception in Bogotá to attend Lima Group session\n|-\n|25\n|Pence's speech addressing Lima Group\n|-\n|27\n|National Assembly session\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |March\n|6\n|National Assembly session (20 hours)\n|-\n|28\n|Guaidó speech about Operation Freedom\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |April\n|15\n|Pompeo and Duque's speech\n|-\n|19\n|Guaidó's public speech on the anniversary of the Venezuelan War of Independence and on the 2019 Sudanese coup d'état\n|-\n|27\n|Guaido's public speech on the delivery of aid and state media censorship\n|-\n| rowspan=\"14\" |May\n|1\n|Guaido's speech\n|-\n|2\n|López press-conference from the Spanish embassy\n|-\n|3\n|Guaidó's speech on Edgar Zambrano investigation order, Guaido's speech to PDVSA union workers, and Lima Group conference in Peru about Venezuela's crisis\n|-\n|7\n|National Assembly session on TIAR treaty\n|-\n|9\n|Guaidó's press conference on Zambrano detention\n|-\n|11\n|Guaidó's speech about political persecution and military support\n|-\n|14\n|Guaidó's speech after security forces blocked the entry to the National Assembly\n|-\n|16\n|Guaidó's meeting with professionals and technicians from Frente Amplio.

Between 12 and 13 February, CANTV users that tried to access were redirected to a mirror site with a different URL address. The mirror site asked for personal information: names, ID, address and telephone numbers. The fake site also hosted other phishing websites with the aim of obtaining email addresses, usernames and passwords. All the phishing websites used the .ve domain controlled by Conatel. This manipulation was denounced as a technique to identify dissidents to the government.* *  www.ntn24.com}}*  Following the phishing incident, the official site was completely blocked for CANTV users on 16 February.\nAggression, arrests and releases of press personnel\nThe Venezuelan press workers union denounced that in 2019, 40&nbsp;journalists had been illegally detained as of 12 March; the National Assembly Parliamentary Commission for Media declared that there had been 173&nbsp;aggressions against press workers as of 13 March. The commission planned to report these aggressions to the International Criminal Court.\nA delegation led by Michelle Bachelet, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights visited Venezuela on March. In a preliminary oral report, Bachelet denounced the escalating freedom of speech and press restrictions in Venezuela.\nAccording to Efecto Cocuyo director, Luz Mely Reyes, \"journalism is becoming 'very complicated' in Venezuela where power outages, patchy internet and threats of violence have made reporting increasingly difficult\". Reyes told Agence France-Presse (AFP) in April that she is unsure that independent outlets like Efecto Cocuyo may \"survive\" in this economic and political situation.\nJanuary 2019\nTwo journalists—Beatriz Adrián of Caracol Televisión and Osmary Hernández of CNN—were detained while on-air and covering the 13 January detention of Guaidó.\nBetween 29 and 30 January, at least eleven press personnel were arrested.

The two Venezuelan journalists were released; the Chilean journalists were deported.\nTwo French journalists from French TV show, Quotidien, and their Venezuelan producer were detained for two days at El Helicoide on 30 January.* *  Three press workers of EFE were also arrested by SEBIN and DGCIM—a Colombian photographer, a Colombian companion, and a Spanish companion.\nJorge Arreaza, Venezuelan Minister for Foreign Affairs, defended the detentions, stating that press workers were part \"of the media operation against the country\" that wanted \"to create a media scandal\" by not \"complying with the minimum prerequisites required by Venezuelan law\". Press organizations stated that they complied with the migration laws of Venezuela. Maduro denied that journalists were detained by authorities.\nFebruary 2019\nanchor Jorge Ramos was detained by the Maduro administration in February 2019 after a live interview.]]\nDuring the 23 February clashes, there were numerous reports of Venezuelan authorities and paramilitaries attacking press workers, including workers of the Associated Press, Ecos del Torbes, La Prensa de Lara, Telemundo, TVVenezuela, VIVOplay, VPItv and others.\nSwedish reporter Annika Hernroth-Rothstein reported to the National Assembly that she was violently threatened, ransacked and beaten by pro-Maduro paramilitary groups known as colectivos on 23 February. Rothstein returned to Venezuela on 18 April, but she was briefly detained at the airport by the Venezuelan National Guard (GNB) and was subsequently deported.\nJorge Ramos, who The Guardian described as \"arguably the best-known journalist in the Spanish-speaking world\", was detained along with his Univisión crew members during an interview with Maduro on 25 February. Univisión equipment and materials were confiscated by Venezuelan authorities. During the interview, Maduro denied that a humanitarian crisis existed in Venezuela, which prompted Ramos to show Maduro images of Venezuelan children eating from a garbage truck and asking again if a crisis existed. After being released, Ramos stated that he and his group were held because this question bothered Maduro. The Univisión team was informed they would be deported, Maduro's Minister of Information Jorge Rodríguez described the incident as a \"cheap show\".\nTelemundo journalist Daniel Garrido was detained for eight hours by SEBIN on 26 February and was later irregularly released on a side street in Caracas.\nThe journalist and dissident Chavist Alí Domínguez was kidnapped on 28 February; he was found comatose on the roadside of a major highway on the morning of the next day, though this was not released even to his family until several days later, shortly before he died as a result of injuries of beating and suspected torture.\nMarch blackouts\nUS freelance journalist Cody Weddle and his Venezuelan coworker Carlos Camacho were detained for half a day on 7 March after Weddle house was raided and his equipment confiscated by military counterintelligence forces.

He said he had been physically attacked and that the intelligence agents had taken money from his house without reporting it. A group accompanied by his wife, journalist Naky Soto, protested in front of the prosecutor office. Michelle Bachelet, head of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, was in Caracas at that time and tweeted concern about the detention. The Spanish embassy in Caracas also contacted the government for information. Díaz was accused as an accomplice in a plot to cause the electricity outage, he was charged with instigation of a crime and is not allowed to leave Venezuela. He is also forbidden to participate in protests or to give statements to the media, and he must appear before court every eight days.\nGazeta Wyborcza Polish journalist, Tomasz Surdel, was briefly detained, threatened, and beaten, by police Special Actions Force (FAES) during the blackout, according to the Venezuelan press workers union.

The National Assembly session of  that day, concerning the detention of their vicepresident Edgar Zambrano, had to be rescheduled for the next day.  Jorge Millan, a National Assembly member, said that the report of \"bombs\" was false. Internet disruptions occurred during Guaido's public speech on the blockade. Guaidó tweeted \"they're trying to hold the legislative power hostage while the dictator entrenches himself alone in a palace where he shouldn't be\".

Five of the journalists were arbitrarily detained for three hours.\nOn 21 May, The Human Rights Watch and the CPJ called for the \"immediate release\" of the photojournalist Jesús Medina Ezaine held in Ramo Verde Prison.  Medina was first detained in October 2017 alongside journalist Roberto di Matteo of Italy and Filippo Rossi of Switzerland while reporting at Tocorón penitentiary. After the detention, Medina went missing, according to the security forces, he was not held at their headquarters. Medina later appeared in November, left in a highway, he reported how he was tortured and threatened to death by his abductors.

The allegations included the mismanagement of funds to resupply gas services and the resale of CLAP boxes at a higher price. The CPJ denounced the arrest indicating that \"allegations of corruption against public officials are not hate speech\". In August, Quintana García was taken to a hospital due to a possible cardiac arrest.\nThe Venezuelan Press Workers Union (SNTP) denounced and condemned attacks committed by members of Juan Guaidó's team against at least seven press workers during an activity in Maracay, Aragua state, on 31 August, stating that they were verbally and physically attacked. The Association of Venezuelan Journalists Abroad (APEVEX) denounced the attacks, declaring that \"Venezuelan journalists already had enough of the attacks by the regime to now also be victims of the interim government\".
