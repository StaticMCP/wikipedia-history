He scored a hat-trick in the 1951 final.\nInternational career\nKing was part of the 1954 New Zealand side which toured Australia. After being left out of the starting XI for the first game against a State side, he was given his chance against an Australian select XI in the second, and duly delivered with hat-trick in the 3-0 win. King's performance earned him a start for his only official A-international appearance for New Zealand. King scored the first of New Zealand's goals, Charlie Steele, Jr. the other in the 2-1 victory over Australia on 14 August 1954. King suffered a knee injury late in the first half and was unable to take any further part in the tour. Including unofficial matches, King played 6 times for New Zealand, scoring eight goals.\nReferences"
