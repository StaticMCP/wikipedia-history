This action had been done by a regional sect of the movement, however, the national organization soon joined in. In the next few days, leading members of the Lapua Movement and hundreds of armed members of Civil Guards arrived at Mäntsälä. The former Chief of General Staff, Major General Wallenius also joined the leadership of the rebellion. The men refused to disperse and demanded the cabinet's resignation and a change in political course.\nTwo days later, the cabinet ordered the leaders of the Lapua Movement arrested using the Protection of the Republic Act which the movement itself had urged for a year before. Army units prepared as the Chief of Defence, Lieutenant General Aarne Sihvo was prepared to use force to end the rebellion. Orders were given to reinforce the defence of Helsinki with tanks and artillery in case the situation worsened. As the tensions grew, so did the consumption of alcohol among the instigators.\nOn 2 March 1932, President Pehr Evind Svinhufvud gave a radio speech in which he urged the militiamen to return home and promised that only the leaders would be punished. The President's speech was as follows:}}\nThe men dispersed and the leaders were arrested a few days later. In spring, the Lapua Movement was disbanded. Only a small part of the Civil Guards had joined the rebels, while the majority remained loyal to the government. On 16 July 1932, an indictment sought the punishment of 102 rebels. Of these defendants, 52 of them received prison terms, 32 received conditional prison terms, 20 of them were pardoned, and 24 were released without any criminal convictions.\nThe Mäntsälä rebellion can be considered the last major radical-right-wing incident in Finland after the Civil War. In the coming years, the economic situation in Finland would improve and radical movements would lose support.\nSee also\n* History of Finland\n* Political violence in Finland (1918–1932)\nReferences\nExternal links"
