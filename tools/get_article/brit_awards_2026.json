It will be held on Saturday 28 February 2026 at the Co-op Live arena in Manchester, the first time in the ceremony's history that it will be held outside London.\nBackground\nFirst staged in 1977, the Brit Awards is an annual event recognising the best in British and International music, which has been held at venues in London since its launch, with The O2 Arena playing host to the ceremony since 2011. On 9 June, the BPI announced a two-year deal to hold the Brit Awards at Manchester's Co-op Live arena, meaning the 2026 and 2027 ceremonies will be held outside London, the first time in the Brit Awards history that this will be the case. On the same day, a three-year sponsorship deal was announced with Sony Music UK. Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, welcomed the move, describing it as a \"massive coup for Greater Manchester\".\nThe news followed an announcement in May that the 2025 Mercury Prize would be held in Newcastle instead of London.\nReferences"
