After plundering several Tatar settlements in the lands of Budjak and Nogai Hordes, Sirko was returning with his Cossack detachment, Kalmyk allies and loot. Polish-Tatar forces during that time planned an ambush in Saradzhinsky Forest, knowing Sirko will pass there.\nBattle\nPolish commanders S. Machowski, W. Leszczyński and Tatar Khan-Mambet Shirin with 3,000–4,000 Polish soldiers and unspecified number of Tatars chose a place of ambush on the hill where it would be difficult to retreat from. Polish-Tatar forces had observation over the path from which Cossack-Kalmyk forces would be passing.\nSirko with Cossacks advanced in a narrow column due to terrain, while Kalmyks served as the rearguard. The main blow was aimed at the end of the column, where Kalmyk detachment was stationed. The goal would be to isolate individual Cossack units in order to defeat them. With all of these factors taken into account, Cossacks would only be able to fight out of ambush by making a decisive breakthrough through Polish formations. It's unknown whether Polish forces attempted to peruse Cossacks, but the main blow of Cossacks would've been aimed at Polish soldiers while Tatars were busy engaging Kalmyks. Polish forces would need time to recover from Cossack blow and Tatars would be too busy fighting Kalmyks, plundering convoys afterwards. Kalmyks tried to break out of encirclement and have put up a desperate resistance, tying up significant portion of enemy forces. Sirko and Cossacks broke out of encirclement.\nAftermath\nSome sources say this battle resulted in defeat of both Kalmyks and Cossacks. Other sources say that only Kalmyks were defeated in battle, while Sirko and Cossacks fought out of ambush with light losses. Chronicle of Samovydets only mentions Kalmyk defeat, while Sirko and Cossacks with casualties reached Sich, then went to Kharkiv. Examination of Sirko's skeleton showed a presence of severe wounds, still visible after 300 years, which he allegedly received in this battle. Ukrainian researcher Draganenko believes that Sirko avoided defeat in this battle, since he continued his operations in Bratslav region against Polish-Tatar forces. Draganenko states that Sirko would've remained in Sich, if Cossacks suffered heavy losses and he was severely wounded.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
