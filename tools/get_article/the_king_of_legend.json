Besides historical information from the historical texts Samguk sagi and Samguk yusa, it was also inspired by a novel written by Lee Munyeol, a renowned Korean writer. The drama aired on KBS1 in South Korea, and internationally through KBS World.\nSynopsis\nThe drama tells the story of a warrior King of Baekje. Under his reign, the kingdom experienced its glory days, with military conquests that saw him controlling most of the Korean peninsula and a subsequent enhancement of Baekje's political power that was the greatest height of Baekje's power. The initial video references 2010 Seoul at the site of Pungnaptoseong then flashes back 1,700 years to Hanseong, Baekje (\"Bakchi\" as referred to in the English subtitles) in which the subject declares to make a new kingdom on that land near the West Sea. Yeogu, the ousted Prince, is banished to a life of selling salt to suppress any fears that he, being the second son, could attempt to take over the throne. The film about Yeogu's return to the kingdom displays many epic war scenes with Goguryeo, who feels the kingdom was stolen from him and deceives Baekje.\nThis King is not Gwanggaeto but Baekje's King Geunchogo, who seized and ruled a Chinese region at least 60 years ahead of Gwanggaeto.\nCast\n* Kam Woo-sung as Prince Buyeo Gu (Later as 13th Eoraha of Baekje, Geunchogo of Baekje)\n* Kim Ji-soo as Buyeo Hwa\n* Lee Jong-won as King Sayu or Gogugwon of Goguryeo (16th king of Goguryeo)\n* Lee Ji-hoon as Hae Gun (Jwapyeong Hae Nyeong's Son)\n* Ahn Jae-mo as Jin Seung (Jwapyeong Jin Jeong's Son)\n* Lee Se-eun as Wi Hongran (Wi Birang's sister)\n* Yoon Seung-won as King Biryu of Baekje (Geunchogo's father, 11th Eoraha of Baekje)\n* Seo In-seok as Heukganggong Sahul (King Biryu's father)\n* Choi Myung-gil as Haebi Hae Sosul (Biryu's 1st queen; Also known as Wanwoldang, Buyeo Chan's mother)\n* Kim Do-yeon as Jinbi Jin Saha (Biryu's 2nd queen; also known as Sosukdang, Buyeo Gu's mother)\n* Lee Jong-soo as Buyeo Chan (Crown Prince of Baekje)\n* Lee Byung-wook as Buyeo Hwi (Wisagun Army Division Commander)\n* Kim Tae-hoon as Buyeo San\n* Han Jin-hee as King Gye (known as Buyeo Jun, son of 10th Eoraha of Baekje, King Bunseo, head of Wiryegung faction.
