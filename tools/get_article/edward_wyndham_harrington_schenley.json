Schenley's father was an artillery officer who died in Cadiz, Spain in 1813.\nCareer\nSchenley was a volunteer in the Peninsular War and joined the Rifle Brigade as a 15-year-old lieutenant in 1814. Subsequently wounded in the Battle of Waterloo, he became friends with Lord Byron.\nSchenley served the Crown in Latin America. In 1825 he was appointed Vice Counsel in Guatemala, and in 1828 he became Counsel in Venezuela. In 1836 he was appointed as arbitrator to the British and Spanish joint commission addressing slavery in Cuba.\nSchenley was elected Liberal MP for Dartmouth at the 1859 general election, but was three months later unseated after an election petition committee found his win had been secured through bribery and corruption.\nPersonal life\nSchenley married three times, all via elopement.  He married his first wife, Catherine Inglis, in Leghorn (Livorno) Italy in 1823. He lived with her in Edinburgh, Scotland for several years, and she died in Havana, Cuba in three years later. A son from their union died.\nSecond marriage\nOn 12 February 1833, he married a second time to Jane Maria Pole, daughter of Sir William Templer Pole, 7th Baronet and Charlotte Fraser.
