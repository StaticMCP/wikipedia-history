He died in Seattle, Washington in 1923.\nCarrick was a genuine all-round sportsman, playing international rugby as a full-back for , and appeared in a few important cricket matches. He was clearly a highly accomplished player, the only batsman to take a century off Nottinghamshire CCC between 1887 and 1890 when they dominated county cricket.\nRugby union career\nAmateur career\nCarrick played with Glasgow Academicals.\nProvincial career\nHe also played at provincial level representing Glasgow District.\nHe also represented the West of Scotland District.\nHe was selected for the Whites Trial side in 1878.\nInternational career\nCarrick was capped for the Scotland international squad between 1876 and 1877.\nReferee career\nCarrick later became a rugby union referee. He refereed the East of Scotland District versus West of Scotland District match in 1886.\nHe refereed the Glasgow District versus Edinburgh District match in 1887.\nAdministrative career\nCarrick became the 15th President of the Scottish Rugby Union. He served the 1886–87 term in office.\nCricket career\nA notable cricketer who took the record for the world's highest score at the age of 29, Carrick scored 419 not out for the touring West of Scotland team against Priory Park in Chichester in July 1885.  A left-handed batsman, he batted for 11 and a half hours and the second day's play was extended by a few minutes to allow him to beat William Roe's 415.\nCarrick opened the innings and batted for the entire two-day match, making his score out of 745/4. He scored one eight (a huge hit to square leg), two sixes, two fives and 30 fours. The Priory Park bowling was headed by James Lillywhite, a bowler with over 1,200 first-class wickets, including eight in his two Tests, but who was caned for 170 here.  Carrick's innings featured strong off-driving and hefty blows to leg and was blemished by only two chances, to deep-mid-on and the keeper. Priory Park put the chance to become part of history above any resentment over the lack of a declaration and, the record achieved, Carrick was \"carried to the dressing room amid immense cheering\".\nHis brother, John Carrick, played cricket at first-class level.\nSee also\n* List of Scottish cricket and rugby union players\nReferences\n;Sources\n# Bath, Richard (ed.)
