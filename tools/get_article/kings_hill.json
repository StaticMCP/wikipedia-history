It is one of several new villages built in Kent since the 1950s (other examples including Vigo and New Ash Green). Development started in 1989 near West Malling, on land previously occupied by RAF West Malling which was operational during both world wars. The plan was for a multi-purpose site of both residential and office/business space.\nParts of the 2007 Channel 4 drama series Cape Wrath were shot in the village.\nDevelopment\nLiberty Property Trust carried out the principal development of the site, commencing on the old West Malling airfield site in 1989. The ultimate aim is to have some 2,750 homes and 2 million square feet (186,000 m²) of commercial properties. As of 2010, 2000 homes had been built along with  of business space. The development precipitated a major expansion of the A228 which passes the village.\nThe oldest parts of Kings Hill are around Worcester Avenue and Discovery Drive. Phase 2 is around Beacon Avenue to the north and there is also a Phase 3.\nConstruction of houses and other buildings is set to continue in Kings Hill as Kent County Council have purchased new land for building. In May 2010 plans were unveiled for the re-development of the old airfield's derelict control tower (now a listed building) and the surrounding area which, as of 2016, now plays host to a Costa Coffee and an office for Liberty staff.\nMany of the roads in Kings Hill are named after varieties of apple, a fruit which has been grown in Kent for centuries, including Bovarde Avenue, Braeburn Way, Discovery Drive, Melrose Avenue, Pippin Way, Winston Avenue and Worcester Avenue. Others pay homage to the site's past use as an RAF WWII aerodrome, with names such as Typhoon Road, Mosquito Road, Hurricane Road, Spitfire Road, Beaufighter Road, Javelin Road, Lancaster Way, Lysander Road, Meteor Road and Mustang Road.\nCommunity facilities\nsupermarket in Kings Hill]]\nThere are three primary schools in the estate (Kings Hill Primary, the Discovery School and Valley Invicta).\nOther facilities include Kings Hill Sports Park, an Asda superstore, a Little Waitrose, an Aldi, a Shepherd Neame pub named The Spitfire, a doctor's surgery, a veterinary surgery, opticians, pharmacist, traditional and eastern restaurants, takeaways, cafes, two churches and a David Lloyd Leisure health club.\nKings Hill is served by St Gabriel's Church of England church, which currently meets in the Discovery School. Kings Hill falls predominantly within the ecclesiastical parishes of Mereworth and West Malling. In 2003 the Diocese of Rochester appointed the first full-time resident minister to meet the pastoral needs of the growing business and residential community. In 2015 they appointed their second full-time minister.\nPublic art\nThe development features a number of major sculptures commissioned by the developers. On the roundabout between the business park and the residential area is A different ball game by Kevin Atherton which consists of a  diameter reflective ball being pushed in different directions by three life-size bronze figures which were cast from local people. On the A228 roundabout to the north of the business park is a  tall obelisk style sculpture called ''L'Ambiente'' created by Enzo Torcoletti. Smaller sculptures on the site include a statue depiction of a tug of war game on the roundabout near to Kings Hill Primary and memorials to Group Captain Peter Townsend and Bill Rouse, late chairman of the site's developers.\nTransport\nKings Hill has bus links to Maidstone, Tonbridge, Tunbridge Wells and Chatham, and most services are run by Arriva Southern Counties.
