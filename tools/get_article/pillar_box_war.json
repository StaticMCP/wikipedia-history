This was reflected in her royal cypher, which took the Latin form 'EIIR'. Some objected to this usage as the new queen was the first Elizabeth to reign over the United Kingdom or indeed Great Britain, Elizabeth I having been the queen of the former kingdoms of England and Ireland but not Scotland.\nIn 1953, John MacCormick took legal action against the Lord Advocate in the case of MacCormick v Lord Advocate, challenging the Queen's right to call herself Elizabeth the Second. The case failed on the grounds that the matter was within the royal prerogative, and thus the Queen was free to adopt any title she saw fit.\nActions and legacy\nSome occasions of vandalism  and even explosions of post boxes which carried the Queen's 'EIIR' insignia were recorded. One particular pillar box in Edinburgh's Inch district was repeatedly vandalised with tar, paint and a hammer before being blown to pieces less than three months after its unveiling.\nThe folk songs Sky High Joe and The Ballad of the Inch commemorate these events.\nAfter 1953, new post boxes were placed in Scotland carrying only the Crown of Scotland image rather than the 'EIIR' cypher, which continued to be used in the rest of the United Kingdom, and indeed in some of the Queen's other realms and territories. A post box with the  'EIIR' cypher was installed in Dunoon in 2018 and immediately scheduled for replacement on discovery of the error.\nCharles III cypher will also not be included on Scottish post boxes, despite the fact that Charles II also reigned over Scotland.\nSee also\n*Royal cypher\nReferences"
