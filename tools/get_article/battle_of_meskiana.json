He was told that it was Queen Dihya whom all the Berbers obeyed and that if he defeated her he would succeed in submitting the entire Maghreb.\nIn 698, Hassan ibn al-Nu'man attempted to seize the Aurès but he was defeated by Dihya and forced to retreat to Libya. The Umayyad army suffered heavy losses and a number of Arab soldiers were captured. Following this victory Queen Dihya became the uncontested ruler of the entire Maghreb for around five years.\nReferences"
