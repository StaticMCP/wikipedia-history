The Viking Ship Museum also conducts research and educates researchers in the fields of maritime history, marine archaeology and experimental archaeology. Various academic conferences are held here and there is a research library in association with the museum.\nOriginal Viking ships\nAround the year 1070, five Viking ships were deliberately sunk at Skuldelev in Roskilde Fjord in order to block the most important fairway and to protect Roskilde from an enemy attack from the sea. These ships, later known as the Skuldelev ships, were excavated in 1962. They turned out to be five different types of ships ranging from cargo ships to ships of war.\nThe Viking Ship Museum overlooking the inlet of Roskilde Fjord was built in 1969 with the main purpose of exhibiting the five newly discovered Skuldelev ships.\nThe original Skuldelev Viking ships are the main focus of the museum, but a small exhibition about the Roskilde ships and various temporary exhibitions with a broader scope can also be experienced here.\nRoskilde ships\nIn the late 1990s, excavations for the shipyard expansion of the Viking Ship Museum uncovered the remains of a further nine ships, the Roskilde ships, from the medieval period. It is the largest such discovery of  ships in Northern Europe. Most of these are from the period just after the Viking Age, 1060-1350 AD, but  is from 1025 AD and is the longest Viking ship ever found; about  long. All except Roskilde 8 have been excavated and their remains are at the National Museum of Denmark (Roskilde 6 on display, remaining in storage).\nReconstructed Viking ships and historical boats\nThe Viking Ship Museum has a long tradition of Viking ship reconstructions and boat building and also collects boats of interest from all over Scandinavia. The boat collection at the museum now comprise more than 40 vessels and the associated ship building yard is constantly building new ships by original methods as part of an experimental archaeology learning process. It is possible to follow or engage in the ship building process here. The shipyard is located on a small isle known as Museumsøen (Museum Island), connected to the main museum exhibition buildings by a drawbridge.\nEvery summer, a handful of boats are launched for extended sea voyages to accumulate more knowledge about the seafaring techniques and conditions of the Vikings.\nGallery\nVikingeskibsmuseet 15.jpg|A look down the halls\nViking-ship at roskilde-museum, denmark.JPG|Silhouette of an original Viking ship\nVikingeskibsmuseet 12.jpg|Small scale replicas\nBridge-to-the-Viking-Ship-Museum-Roskilde-island.jpg|The bridge to the shipyard of Museumsøen\nVikingeskibsmuseet 3.jpg|The reconstruction of Skuldelev 5 (1991)\nRoskilde 020.JPG|Boat building at the workshops\nRoskildeVikingWorkshop.jpg|Preservation of archaeological remains\nRoskilde 012.JPG|Fullscale navigable reconstructions of original ships are built at Museumsøen\nSee also\n* Äskekärr ship\n* Ladby ship\n* National Museum of Denmark\n* Viking Ship Museum in Oslo\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://alexandrerosa.free.fr/index.php?spgmGal=Voyages/Denmark/Roskilde/Viking_Ship_Museum Picture Gallery]\n* [http://www.modelships.de/Museums_and_replicas/Vikingeskibsmuseet_Roskilde/Viking_ship_museum_Roskilde.htm Pictures of the Viking ship replicas, from visit in August 2009] Many high resolution photos\n* [https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/dec/27/viking-ship-roskilde-british-museum \"Rebirth of the Viking warship that may have helped Canute conquer the seas\"], Maev Kennedy, The Guardian, 27 December 2012"
