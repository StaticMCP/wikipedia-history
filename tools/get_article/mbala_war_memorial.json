The truncated red stone column was one of the last war memorials designed by Edwin Lutyens.  It commemorates almost 1,500 native carriers from North Rhodesia who died in action, or from wounds or sickness, during the East African campaign.  Their names are not recorded.\nThe memorial bears a plaque with the inscription:\nA smaller plaque records\nBefore the independence of Zambia in 1964, the settlement was known as Abercorn, after James Hamilton, 2nd Duke of Abercorn, chairman of the British South Africa Company in 1895 when the company took over administration of North-Eastern Rhodesia.  The province was the most northerly outpost of British colonial presence in southern Africa.  It bordered the German colony in German East Africa to the northeast.\nAfter the outbreak of the First World War, Abercorn was defended against repeated German attacks in late 1914, and into 1915.  After being pushed back, the German forces eventually re-entered British territory in 1918.  The memorial stands near the place where the Imperial German forces in East Africa commanded by Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck formally surrendered to British General William F.S. Edwards on 25 November 1918, concluding the East African campaign.\nThe formal surrender at Abercorn came nine days after Lettow-Vorbeck had agreed a ceasefire at the Chambeshi River some  further south.  The ceasefire is commemorated by the Chambeshi Monument.\nReferences\n* [https://www.cwgc.org/visit-us/find-cemeteries-memorials/cemetery-details/4005065/ Abercorn Memorial], Commonwealth War Graves Commission\n* [https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mbala-wwi-surrender-monument Mbala Surrender Monument], Atlas Obscura"
