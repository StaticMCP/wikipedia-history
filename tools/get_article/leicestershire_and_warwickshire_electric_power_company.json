Electricity was supplied by the company from 1913 until the nationalization of the electricity supply industry in 1948.\nFoundation\nThe Leicestershire and Warwickshire Electric Power Company was incorporated in 1902. Its powers derived from the provisions of the  (2 Edw. 7. c. cxxxi). Its aim was to supply electricity throughout the counties of Leicestershire and Warwickshire. The company was one of the pioneering power companies that were founded from around 1900. This new type of enterprise operated at a larger scale at county and regional level, rather than the local authority areas of earlier undertakings. Another power company in the East Midlands was the Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire Electric Power Company, established in 1901.\nEarly plans\nThe company obtained further powers under the  (4 Edw. 7. c. lxxiii). This extended the period in which works on power stations should commence. Furthermore, it did not limit the construction of power stations to those sites specified in the 1902 Act.\nThe ambitious plans of the Leicestershire and Warwickshire company were to be realised through the construction of six new power stations. These were located at Glenfield (north-west of Leicester), Hinckley, Leek Wooton, Measham, Newbold-on-Avon and Whitacre. In the event these plans were abandoned and little development took place. Only one power station was built at Hinckley and then not until 1913. The Hinckley power station had an installed capacity of 1,700&nbsp;kW.\nAcquisition\nIn 1912 the Leicestershire and Warwickshire Company's entire share and loan capital was acquired by the Tramway Light and Power Company Limited. This company was founded in 1912 by the engineer George Balfour to acquire the assets and operating rights of electricity undertakings. In addition to the Leicestershire and Warwickshire company, it acquired the Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire Electric Power Company, the Midland Electric Light and Power Company Ltd, plus several traction or tramway companies. The Tramway Light and Power Company was renamed the Midland Counties Electric Supply Company Ltd in 1921, see Midland Electric Light and Power Company Limited.\nThe Leicestershire and Warwickshire Power Company built a new power station at Emscote, Warwick in 1920. The station was built adjacent to the River Avon and was also known as the Avon station, it had a generating capacity of 6,000&nbsp;kW. Operating parameters of the two stations in 1923 are summarised in the table.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Avon and Hinckley plant 1923\n!Parameter\n!Avon  section\n!Hinckley  section\n|-\n|Consumer  voltage\n|12  kV, 6.6 kV\n|433  & 250 V\n|-\n|Boiler  plant lb/hr\n|80,000\n|90,000\n|-\n|Generators\n|2  × 3 MW\n|1  × 0.2 MW\n2  × 1 MW\n1  × 3 MW\n|-\n|Maximum  load MW\n|2.15\n|3.83\n|-\n|No.  of connections\n|2,890\n|6,778\n|-\n|Electricity  sold MWh\n|7,179\n|6,924\n|}\nThe company obtained further powers under the Leicestershire and Warwickshire Electric Power Act, 1926, (16 & 17 Geo. 5. xxxiv). This increased the monies that the company may use on operation and construction of new plant.\nThe National Grid was constructed from 1927. A 132 kV line provided an export route from Hinckley to Coventry and thence to the 132 kV central midland ring. The ring comprised Hams Hill, Coventry, Leicester, Nottingham, Burton-on-Trent and Spondon.\nPower company\nBy 1937 the Leicestershire and Warwickshire company was operating as a power company, by generating or otherwise acquiring electric current for local undertakings. The extent of the electricity supply is shown in the table.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Undertakings supplied by the Leicestershire and Warwickshire Company 1937\n!Authorized undertaker\n!Sales MWh\n!Sales £\n|-\n|Atherstone & District\n|706\n|9,151\n|-\n|Barrow-on-Soar & District\n|2,355\n|23,288\n|-\n|Bedworth & Bulkington\n|814\n|11,328\n|-\n|Castle Donington\n|743\n|8,829\n|-\n|Colville\n|3,096\n|38,350\n|-\n|East Leicester\n|871\n|7,826\n|-\n|Fleckney, Kilsworth & District\n|739\n|6,661\n|-\n|Henley-in-Arden\n|1,077\n|7,163\n|-\n|Hinckley\n|2,545\n|31,432\n|-\n|Lutterworh & Rugby\n|2,966\n|25,367\n|-\n|Market Bosworth\n|1,642\n|17,042\n|-\n|Mid-Warwick\n|1,264\n|10,518\n|-\n|Napton & District\n|101\n|997\n|-\n|Southam & District\n|815\n|6,701\n|-\n|Wigston Magna, Blaby & District\n|2,839\n|31,561\n|-\n|Power Undertaking\n|126,803\n|376,057\n|-\n|Total\n|149,376\n|612,271\n|}\nAbolition\nThe Leicestershire and Warwickshire Power Company was abolished on 31 March 1948 under the provisions of the Electricity Act 1947 which nationalized the British electricity supply industry. The generating plant was vested in the British Electricity Authority and the distribution infrastructure in the East Midlands Electricity Board. The supply area of the Leicestershire & Warwickshire Power Company broadly corresponded to the Leicestershire and Warwickshire subarea of the East Midlands Board.\nGeneration of electricity ceased at Hinckley power station in 1954. The Warwick (Avon) power station continued to generate electricity until 1973.\nSee also\n* Timeline of the UK electricity supply industry\n* List of pre-nationalisation UK electric power companies\n* Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire Electric Power Company\n* Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire Electricity Company\nReferences"
