P2P banking principles vary depending upon historical contexts and incidents.\nDefinition in the traditional banking\nBorrowers can search for loans that meet their needs in terms of amount and interest rate. The system categorizes all members by risk level and allows them to browse potential lenders or borrowers based on various demographic factors.\nSince P2P banking does not use third-party banking institution intermediaries the rates and terms are often much more favourable for the members.\nUnlike conventional banking where the spread between deposit rates and lending rates is consumed to finance the bank's administrative and logistic expenses, both lenders and borrowers get to save on such costs while paying certain commissions to the P2P portal provider and/or the credit rating agency.\nProponents suggest that P2P banking and financing could accelerate renewable energy development by more equitably distributing investment returns. These concepts have now been instituted by Energy in Common and Kiva in their green funds.\nOld models\nThe following two pictures show the difference between the peer to peer banking approach and the normal way with a financial institute.\nFile:Traditional_banking_model_simplified.png|Traditional banking model (simplified)\nFile:Peer_to_peer_banking_simplified.png|Peer to peer banking model (simplified)\nSee also\n* LendingClub\n* Peer-to-peer\n* Social peer-to-peer processes\n* Peer-to-peer lending\nReferences"
