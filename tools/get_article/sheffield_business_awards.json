This allows businesses in some areas of Rotherham, Barnsley and Doncaster to take part in the event.\nBusinesses can nominate themselves or be nominated for one or more of several categories which are then judged by a panel of independent business leaders, Sheffield Chamber of Commerce representatives and representatives from the sponsoring organisations. The Outstanding Business of the Year Award is decided from all short-listed companies excluding Business Person of the Year and Young Business Person of the Year.\nThe Ceremony\nEach year a ceremony is held around the first week of December at Ponds Forge International Sports Centre.
