He was the son of LeRoy King (1857–1895) and the former Ethel Ledyard Rhinelander (1857–1925) of New York and Newport, Rhode Island.  His siblings included LeRoy King, Jr., who married Mary Isabel Lockwood (daughter of Benoni Lockwood), Katharine Bulkeley Lawrence (niece of Edward H. Bulkeley), and Pamela Anne Sutherland Woodbury (daughter of George Henry Sutherland); and art collector Ethel Marjory King, who married Charles Howland Russell. The Kings' Newport residence was designed for his father by Stanford White, at the corner of Berkeley and Bellevue Avenues.\nHis paternal grandparents were Edward King and Mary Augusta (née LeRoy) King.  Through his father, he was a direct descendant of both Nicholas Fish and Peter Stuyvesant, the last Dutch Director-General of New Netherland.  His great-aunt, Elizabeth Stuyvesant (née LeRoy) Dresser was the mother of D. LeRoy Dresser and Edith Stuyvesant Dresser, who was married to George Washington Vanderbilt II and, later, U.S. Senator from Rhode Island, Peter Goelet Gerry.  His maternal grandparents were Frederic William Rhinelander, trustee and the president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Frances Davenport (née Skinner) Rhinelander.
