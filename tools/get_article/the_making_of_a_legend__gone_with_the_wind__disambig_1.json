Selznick, from the time of the novel's 1936 publication to the Academy Awards ceremony of 1940. Included are interviews with many of the crew and office personnel involved in production. O. Selznick struggled to control his project, working with three directors along the way--George Cukor, Victor Fleming and Sam Wood. Each had their own vision and the strong-willed men often clashed.\nThe Making of a Legend brings up many of the \"what ifs?\" that arose as different scenarios were discussed. Among these were the possibilities of Errol Flynn and Gary Cooper as Rhett Butler.\nCast\n* Christopher Plummer ...  Narrator (voice)\n* L. Jeffrey Selznick ...  David O.
