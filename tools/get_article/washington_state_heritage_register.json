The register does not provide fiscal support to listed entries; instead, listing is an honorary designation which raises public awareness.\nSites which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places are automatically added to the Washington Heritage Register.\nExternal links\n* https://dahp.wa.gov/historic-registers/washington-heritage-register\nReferences"
