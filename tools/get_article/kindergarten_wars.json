Hosting the children of politicians, celebrities, businessmen, and other VIPs, Kindergarten Noir protects them from would-be assassins and kidnappers by employing former criminals as teachers in exchange for reduced sentences. Rita, also known as Convict #999, is a former assassin who finds herself working at Kindergarten Noir—both to get a reduced sentence by acting as a bodyguard and to find a hot guy along the way.\nCharacters\n;\n:\n:A 20-year old assassin from the Netherlands known as \"The Witch\" who takes on a new identity as a kindergarten teacher to protect the children of world leaders at a school called Kindergarten Noir. Rita has a running gag where she falls in love at first sight with an assassin trying to harm the children, and asks them a series of questions, and if they answer them with a response Rita doesn't like they would get shot.\n;\n:\n:A 23-year old womanizing American swindler from Nevada who accepted the job of working in the kindergarten. He develops feelings for Rita early on.\nMedia\nManga\nWritten and illustrated by You Chiba, the series began serialization on Shueisha's Shōnen Jump+ app and website on September 15, 2022.
