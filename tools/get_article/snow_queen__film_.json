Also known as The Winter Witch, the film stars Bridget Fonda as the title character and Chelsea Hobbs as her rival and the story's heroine, Gerda.

The DVD was released in the United Kingdom on November 9, 2009 and in Australia on September 2, 2011. This was Bridget Fonda's last acting role before her retirement.\nPlot\nGerda lives in a remote hotel in the far North with her father, her only real companion being the hotel's new bellboy, Kai. A mysterious woman comes to stay at the hotel, dressed in white fur and diamonds and accompanied by wolves. She is the Snow Queen and in the middle of the night she disappears, taking Kai away with her to her distant palace, where he is tasked to put together a large broken mirror, while guarded by a polar bear.
