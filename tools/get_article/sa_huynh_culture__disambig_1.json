Archaeological sites from the culture have been discovered from the Mekong Delta to Quảng Bình province in central Vietnam. The Sa Huynh people were most likely the predecessors of the Cham people, an Austronesian-speaking people and the founders of the kingdom of Champa.\nDescription\nThe site at Sa Huỳnh was discovered in 1909. Sa Huỳnh sites were rich in locally worked iron artefacts, typified by axes, swords, spearheads, knives and sickles. In contrast, bronze artifacts were dominant in the Đông Sơn culture sites found in northern Vietnam and elsewhere in mainland Southeast Asia.\nThe Sa Huỳnh culture cremated adults and buried them in jars covered with lids, a practice unique to the culture. Ritually broken offerings usually accompanied the jar burials. The culture is also typified by its unique ear ornaments featuring two-headed animals, believed by some to depict saola. The ornaments were commonly made from jade (nephrite), but also made from glass. Bead ornaments were also commonly found in Sa Huynh burials, most commonly made from glass.\nTrade network\nThe Sa Huỳnh culture showed evidence of an extensive trade network that existed between 500 BC to AD 1500, known as the Sa Huynh-Kalanay Interaction Sphere (named after the Sa Huỳnh culture and the Kalanay Cave of Masbate, Philippines). It was mainly between Sa Huỳnh and the Philippines, but also extended into archaeological sites in Taiwan, Southern Thailand, and northeastern Borneo. It is characterized by shared red-slipped pottery traditions, as well as double-headed and penannular ornaments known as lingling-o made from materials like green jade (sourced from Taiwan), green mica (from Mindoro), black nephrite (from Hà Tĩnh) and clay (from Vietnam and the Northern Philippines). Sa Huynh also produced beads made from glass, carnelian, agate, olivine, zircon, gold and garnet; most of whom use materials that are also imported. Han dynasty-style bronze mirrors were also found in Sa Huynh sites.\nTimeline of Iron age\nImageSize = width:800 height:80\nPlotArea = width:720 height:55 left:65 bottom:20\nAlignBars = justify\nColors =\nid:time value:rgb(0.7,0.7,1) #\nid:period value:rgb(1,0.7,0.5) #\nid:age value:rgb(0.95,0.85,0.5) #\nid:era value:rgb(1,0.85,0.5) #\nid:eon value:rgb(1,0.85,0.7) #\nid:filler value:gray(0.8) # background bar\nid:black value:black\nPeriod     = from:-1300 till:500\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:500 start:-1300\nScaleMinor = unit:year increment:100 start:-1300\nPlotData =\nalign:center textcolor:black fontsize:8 mark:(line,black) width:15 shift:(0,-5)\nbar:Vietnam color:era\nfrom: -771 till: -221 shift:(0,5) text:Sa Huỳnh culture\nfrom: -221 till: 500 shift:(0,4) text:Óc Eo culture\nbar:Vietnam color:filler\nfrom: -221 till: 500 shift:(0,-7) text:Imperial Vietnam\nbar: Philippines color:era\nbar:Philippines color:filler\nfrom: -108 till: -18 shift:(0,5) text:Ancient Barangay\nfrom: -18 till: 500 text:Archaic epoch\nbar: Indonesia color:era\nfrom: -500 till: -108 text:Prehistory of Indonesia\nbar:Indonesia color:filler\nfrom: -108 till: -18 shift:(0,4) text:Buni culture\nfrom: -18 till: 500 text:Early Kingdoms\n:::Dates are approximate, consult particular article for details\n::: Prehistoric (or Proto-historic) Iron Age  Historic Iron Age\nArtifacts\nFile:Bronze weapon Sa Huynh Culture.JPG|Bronze dagger\nFile:Pottery vase Sa Huynh Culture.JPG|Pottery vase\nFile:Pottery fruit tray Sa Huynh Culture 2.JPG|Pottery fruit tray\nFile:Pottery burial jar Sa Huynh Cultue.JPG|Pottery burial jar\nFile:Three node pendant (Jade), Artefacts of Phu Hoa site(Dong Nai province).JPG|Jade penannular lingling-o\nFile:Bicephalous pendant (Jade), Artefacts of Phu Hoa site(Dong Nai province) 01.jpg|Jade double-headed lingling-o\nSee also\n* Austronesian peoples\n* Plain of Jars\n* Cát Tiên sanctuary\n* Óc Eo\n* Champa\n* Buni culture\n* Tabon Caves\nNotes\nReferences\n* Higham, Charles, The Bronze Age of Southeast Asia,\n* Higham, Charles, Early Cultures of Mainland Southeast Asia,"
