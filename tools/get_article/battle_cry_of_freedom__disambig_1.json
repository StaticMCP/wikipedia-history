A patriotic song advocating the causes of Unionism and abolitionism, it became so popular that composer H. L. Schreiner and lyricist W. H. Barnes adapted it for the Confederacy.\nA modified Union version was used as the campaign song for the Lincoln-Johnson ticket in the 1864 presidential election, as well as in elections after the war, such as for Garfield in the 1880 U.S. presidential election. It is estimated that over 700,000 copies of its sheet music were put in circulation. The song was so popular that the music publisher had 14 printing presses going at one time and still could not keep up with demand. Louis Moreau Gottschalk thought so highly of the song that in his diary he confided that he thought \"it should be our national anthem\" and used it as the basis for his 1863 concert paraphrase for solo piano \"Le Cri de délivrance,\" opus 55, and dedicated it to Root, who was a personal friend. Charles Ives quoted the song in several compositions, including his own patriotic song, \"They Are There\".\n% Source: http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21566/21566-h/images/battlecry.pdf\n\\new Score {\n\\new Staff {\n>\n}\n}\nHistory\n\"Battle Cry of Freedom\" proved popular among Union soldiers during the American Civil War.

McWhirter, the song's success and popularity among the Union was due to its even-handed references to both abolitionism and unionism. Thus, both groups of Unionists, those opposed to slavery and secession, could utilize the song without reservation:\n(July 27, 2012)}}\nLyrics (Union version)\nShouting the battle cry of freedom!\nAnd we'll fill the vacant ranks with a million freemen more,\nShouting the battle cry of freedom.\n::(Chorus)\nWe will welcome to our numbers the loyal, true and brave,\nShouting the battle cry of freedom!\nAnd although he may be poor, he shall never be a slave,\nShouting the battle cry of freedom!\n::(Chorus)\nSo we're springing to the call from the East and from the West,\nShouting the battle cry of Freedom;\nAnd we'll hurl the rebel crew from the land we love the best,\nShouting the battle cry of Freedom.\n::(Chorus)\n}}\nExtended lyrics (Union version)\nAs published in Hoge, The Boys in Blue (1867) pp. 477–479.\nLyrics (Confederate version)\nChorus (1864 election campaign)\nIn popular culture\n| Eric Taylor has a live recording of this song as \"Rally 'Round the Flag\" on his Hollywood Pocketknife album in 2007.\n| Keith and Rusty McNeil perform both the \"Battle Cry of Freedom\" and \"Southern Battle Cry of Freedom\" on Civil War Songs with Historical Narration (WEM Records, 1989, ).\n| This song features prominently in Ken Burns' documentary The Civil War, where it is performed by Jacqueline Schwab.\n| Billy Bragg wrote a song based upon the music of \"Battle Cry of Freedom\" called \"There Is Power in a Union\" on the Talking with the Taxman about Poetry album.
