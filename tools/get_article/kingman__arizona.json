It is named after Lewis Kingman, an engineer for the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. The population was 32,693 at the 2020 census.\nHistory\nLt. Edward Fitzgerald Beale, a U.S. Navy officer in the service of the Army Corps of Topographical Engineers, was ordered by the U.S. War Department to build a federal wagon road across the 35th parallel. His secondary orders were to test the feasibility of the use of camels as pack animals in the Southwestern desert. Beale traveled through the present-day Kingman in 1857 surveying the road and in 1859 to build the road. Beale's Wagon Road became part of U.S. Route 66 and later Interstate 40. Remnants of the wagon road can still be seen in White Cliffs Canyon in Kingman.\nKingman was founded in 1882 before statehood, in Arizona Territory. Situated in the Hualapai Valley between the Cerbat and Hualapai mountain ranges, Kingman had its modest beginnings as a simple railroad siding near Beale Springs. Civil engineer Lewis Kingman supervised the building of the railroad from Winslow to Beale Springs. This spring had been used by Native Americans living in the area for centuries.\nThe Mohave County seat was originally located in Mohave City from 1864 to 1867. In 1865, the portion of Arizona Territory west of the Colorado River was transferred to Nevada after Nevada's statehood, and became part of Lincoln County, now Clark County, Nevada. The remaining territory of Pah-Ute County became part of Mohave County. Its seat was moved to Hardyville (now within Bullhead City) in 1867. The county seat transferred to the mining town of Cerbat in 1873, then to Mineral Park near Chloride. After some time, the county seat and all instruments were permanently moved to Kingman in 1887.\nDuring World War II, Kingman was the site of a U.S. Army Air Force (USAAF) airfield. The Kingman Army Airfield was founded at the beginning of the war as an aerial gunnery training base. It became one of the USAAF's largest, training some 35,000 soldiers and airmen. The airfield and Kingman played a significant role in this important era of America's history. Following the war, the Kingman Airfield was one of the largest reclamation sites for obsolete military aircraft.\nPostwar, Kingman experienced growth as several major employers moved into the vicinity. In 1953, Kingman was used to detain those men accused of practicing polygamy in the Short Creek raid, which was at the time one of the largest arrests in American history. In 1955, Ford Motor Company established a proving ground (now one of the Chrysler Proving Grounds) in nearby Yucca at the former Yucca Army Airfield. Several major new neighborhoods in Kingman were developed to house the skilled workers and professionals employed at the proving ground. Likewise, the development of the Mineral Park mine near adjacent Chloride, and construction of the Mohave Generating Station in nearby Laughlin, Nevada, in 1971 contributed to Kingman's population growth. Also, the location of a General Cable plant at the Kingman Airport Industrial Park provided steady employment.\nKingman explosion\nThe Kingman Explosion, also known as the Doxol Disaster or Kingman BLEVE, was a catastrophic boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE) that occurred on July 5, 1973, during a propane transfer from a Doxol railroad car to a storage tank on the Getz rail siding near Andy Devine Avenue/Route 66.\nFirefighters Memorial Park in Kingman is dedicated to the 11 firefighters who died in the blaze.\n1980s and on\nThe 1915-built Mohave County Courthouse and 1909-built Jail were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The downtown and other areas of Kingman were evaluated for historic resources in a 1985 study, the Kingman Multiple Resources Area study. The study identified 63 historic resources in Kingman and led to many of them being listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. The county courthouse and jail, a 1928-built locomotive (the Santa Fe 3759), a World War II gunnery school radio tower, and about 50 various houses and other buildings in Kingman are listed on the National Register, comprising the majority of National Register listings in Mohave County.\nGeography\nKingman is in central Mohave County, along Interstate 40 and U.S. Route 93. The city is served by three exits on I-40, which leads east  to Flagstaff and southwest  to Needles, California. US-93 leads northwest  to Las Vegas and southeast  to Wickenburg,  from Phoenix. US 93 is planned to be replaced by Interstate 11 once built to interstate highway standards. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city of Kingman has a total area of , all land.\nClimate\nKingman sits on the eastern edge of the Mojave Desert, but it is located in a cold desert climate (Köppen BWk) due to its plateau location. Kingman's higher elevation and location between the Colorado Plateau and the Lower Colorado River Valley keeps summer high temperatures away from the extremes ( or more) experienced by Phoenix and the Colorado River Valley. The higher elevation also contributes to winter cold and occasional snowfall. Summer daytime highs reach above  frequently, but rarely exceed . Summertime lows usually remain between . Winter highs are generally mild, ranging from around , but winter nighttime lows often fall to freezing, with significantly lower temperatures possible, and occasional snow.\nThe record low temperature in Kingman was set on January 9, 1937, at , and the record high temperature occurred on July 15, 2023, at . The wettest year was 1919 with  and the driest year was 1947 with . The most rainfall in one month was  in September 1939. The most rainfall in 24 hours was  on November 28, 1919. The snowiest year was 1949 with . The most snowfall in one month was  in December 1932. On December 31, 2014, and January 1, 2015, Kingman received  of snow. The storm was so significant that it was a contributing factor in the closure of Interstate 40 at the US 93 Junction for 24 hours.\n|date=March 2013\n}}\nDemographics\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+Kingman city, Arizona – Racial composition\n!Race (NH = Non-Hispanic)\n!\n!% 2010\n!% 2000\n!\n!Pop 2010\n!Pop 2000\n|-\n|White alone (NH)\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |75.2%\n|81.3%\n|85.3%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |24,585\n|22,806\n|17,119\n|-\n|Black alone (NH)\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |1.2%\n|1%\n|0.5%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |397\n|271\n|109\n|-\n|American Indian alone (NH)\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |1.4%\n|1.4%\n|1.6%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |463\n|402\n|329\n|-\n|Asian alone (NH)\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |2.1%\n|1.6%\n|1.4%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |674\n|452\n|284\n|-\n|Pacific Islander alone (NH)\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |0.2%\n|0.3%\n|0.1%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |80\n|85\n|27\n|-\n|Other race alone (NH)\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |0.4%\n|0%\n|0.1%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |141\n|14\n|17\n|-\n|Multiracial (NH)\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |5%\n|1.9%\n|1.6%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |1,639\n|535\n|328\n|-\n|Hispanic/Latino (any race)\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |14.4%\n|12.5%\n|9.2%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |4,710\n|3,503\n|1,856\n|}\n2022 American Community Survey\nAmerican Community Survey estimates, there were  people and  households.
