It was released on LP and CD by Beggars Banquet in 1996 and was highlighted with a new version of the Go-Betweens' \"Rock 'n' Roll Friend\", which was a single B-side in 1988.\nForster later said, \"It was about sweaty Brisbane nights, banana trees in the backyard, animals walking around at night, fruitbats flying in the air. I was looking at Brisbane with new eyes in this new suburb, and I was listening to this music that had more space, more rhythm. I wrote all the songs in about eight months, quicker than I had written since the late 70s.\"\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Robert Forster, except where noted.\n;Side one\n#\"I Can Do\" – 3:00\n#\"Warm Nights\" – 4:25\n#\"Cryin' Love\" – 5:28\n#\"Snake Skin Lady\" – 3:35\n#\"Loneliness\" – 3:21\n;Side two\n#\"Jug of Wine\" – 6:03\n#\"Fortress\" – 4:57\n#\"Rock 'n' Roll Friend\" (Forster, Grant McLennan) – 5:13\n#\"On a Street Corner\" – 5:29\n#\"I'll Jump\" – 3:01\nPersonnel\n*Robert Forster – vocals, guitar\n*Edwyn Collins – guitar\n*Martin Drover – trumpet, flugelhorn\n*Clare Kenny – bass\n*Oliver Karus – cell\n*Neil Pentelow – saxophone\n*Dave Ruffy – drums\n*J.
