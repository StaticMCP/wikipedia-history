He was the son of Charles Howard, 10th Duke of Norfolk, and Catherine Brockholes. He was known for actively participating in the Whig party as part of the opposition to King George III. He also spent a considerable amount of his money rebuilding and refurbishing Arundel Castle after inheriting his title and lands.\nFamily\nHe married, firstly, Marion Coppinger (daughter of John Coppinger), on 1 August 1767, who died a year later giving birth. He married, secondly, Frances Scudamore (1750–1820), the only child of Charles FitzRoy-Scudamore and his wife Frances, formerly Duchess of Beaufort, on 6 April 1771 at London, England. Frances became insane soon after her marriage and was locked away until her death in 1820. Howard then lived with several mistresses. His longtime mistress, Mary Ann Gibbon (a cousin of Edward Gibbon), was reputed to be his secret third wife and she had five children by him, including two sons who were officers of arms, Matthew Howard-Gibbon, and Edward Howard-Gibbon. An older illegitimate son by a previous mistress, Sir William Woods, later became Garter King of Arms.\nLife and politics\nNorfolk renounced his Catholicism to start his political life, but remained a staunch supporter of Catholic Emancipation, as well as opposing the war with the American colonies. He sat in Parliament from 1780 to 1784 and became a lord of the treasury in the Portland cabinet in 1783. He succeeded to the title of 11th Duke of Norfolk in 1786 upon the death of his father. Eventually, he was dismissed from the lord lieutenancy of the West Riding in 1798 for toasting “Our sovereign’s health—the majesty of the people” in terms displeasing to George III.\nNorfolk wrote Historical Anecdotes of some of the Howard Family (1769 and 1817). He was a good friend of Sir Bysshe Shelley, allowing him in 1786 to make out the patent for his baronetcy. Shelley was influenced by Norfolk and built the flamboyant Castle Goring, one side of which was a partial copy of Norfolk's residence of Arundel Castle.\nNorfolk died on 16 December 1815 at age 69, without issue from either of his two legal marriages. Upon his death, his lands and titles passed to his 4th cousin, Bernard.\nHe was noted for his convivial habits and his dislike of soap and water. It was said that his servants would wait for him to fall asleep and then douse him with water. In his Confessions of an English Opium-Eater, Thomas De Quincey refers to him as saying, \"Next Monday, wind and weather permitting, I purpose to be drunk.\"\nFamily tree\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\nExternal links"
