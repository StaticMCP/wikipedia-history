The Foundation was established on 25 June 2014 by Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca, during her term as the 9th President of Malta and terminated with the end of her tenure in 2019. A new organisation, the 'Malta Foundation for the Wellbeing of Society' now exists, unaffiliated with the President of Malta.\nThe Foundation consisted of two principal branches; the Research Entities and Consultative Fora. These operated alongside other constituent entities, including the Children's Hub (and its flagship project 'The President's Secret Garden') and International Institute for Peace and Wellbeing. The Foundation maintained memoranda of understanding with various international organisations, in order to further its goals of securing individual and communal wellbeing in Maltese society. Organisations with whom the Foundation maintained close contact include UNESCO, ISESCO,[http://www.isesco.org.ma/blog/2016/01/08/cooperation-agreement-signed-between-isesco-and-maltas-pfws/ Cooperation agreement signed between ISESCO and Malta’s PFWS | ISESCO] UN Women,[https://web.archive.org/web/20151008062040/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-10/04/c_134683984.htm Gender equality campaign launched in Malta - Xinhua | English.news.cn] and the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, and academic connections with the University of Cambridge and Columbia University.\nThe Director-General of the President's Foundation throughout its existence was Dr Ruth Farrugia,[http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150625/local/foundation-for-the-wellbeing-of-society-marks-first-anniversary.574014 Foundation for the Wellbeing of Society marks first anniversary - timesofmalta.com] and the Foundation Council of Governors included former presidents and prime ministers of the Republic of Malta Eddie Fenech Adami, Lawrence Gonzi, and Ugo Mifsud Bonnici.

Reports compiled from the findings of the Fora were then presented to the President of Malta, and circulated among the Research Entities and other entities within the President's Foundation and beyond.\nThe results of Fora consultations lead to further research through the Entities, or other actions on topics deemed to be of particular importance. The Consultative Fora included a Disability Forum, Interfaith Forum, Community Forum, Transcultural Dialogue Forum, Ageing With Dignity Forum, Child Forum, Culture Forum (chaired by Professor Joe Friggieri), and Gender Forum.\nReferences"
