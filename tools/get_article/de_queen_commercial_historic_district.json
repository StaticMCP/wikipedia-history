The district is centered on the block containing the Sevier County Courthouse, a three-story brick Colonial Revival structure built in 1930.  It includes buildings facing the courthouse square on West DeQueen Avenue, West Stilwell Avenue, and North Third Street, and extends an additional block eastward to North Second Street.  This commercial heart of the city was developed mainly between 1900 and 1920, and includes 21 historically significant buildings.  Notable among them is the former Hayes Hardware Building at 314 West DeQueen, built c. 1900, and the Bank of DeQueen at 221 West DeQueen, also built c. 1900.\nThe district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Sevier County, Arkansas\nReferences"
