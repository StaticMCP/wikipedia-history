The prize was conceived by Popjustice founder Peter Robinson in 2003 as a reaction to what he perceived as the pompous and elitist nature of the existing Mercury Prize, which recognises the best album of the previous year, and in particular its exclusion of pop music acts in favour of those from more esoteric genres. The shortlist for the Popjustice prize is announced in September of each year and the winner named the following month, to coincide with the presentation of the Mercury Prize. Popjustice gives a token prize of £20 to the winner of its award, in contrast to the £20,000 given to the winner of the Mercury Prize.\n!\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2012\n| \"Wings\"\n|rowspan=\"8\"|Track of the Year\n|\n|rowspan=\"7\"|\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2013\n| \"DNA\"\n|\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2014\n| \"Move\"\n|\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2015\n| \"Black Magic\"\n|\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2016\n| \"Love Me Like You\"\n|\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2017\n| \"Touch\"\n|\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2020\n| \"Break Up Song\"\n|\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2021\n| \"Sweet Melody\"\n|\n|\n|-\nThe Pop Hub Awards\nThe Pop Hub Awards is an annual internet fan-voted award show in Poland.\n!\n|-\n| 2019\n|LM5\n|Album of the Year\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |2021\n|Little Mix\n|Favorite Music Group\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Sweet Melody\n|Favorite Dance Track\n|\n|\n|-\n|Best Choreography\n|\n|\n|-\n|Mixers\n|Biggest Fans\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |2022\n|No\n|Favorite Music Video - Pop\n|\n|-\n|Confetti (feat.
