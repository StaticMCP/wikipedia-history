Elliott (Chinese name: ) is the Mark Schwartz Professor of Chinese and Inner Asian History at Harvard University, where he is Vice Provost for International Affairs.  He is also a seminal figure of the school called the New Qing History.\nBiography\nElliott's interest in East Asian history began at Yale, where he earned his BA and MA, the latter as a student of Jonathan Spence and Beatrice Bartlett. After several years of study and archival research in Taiwan, mainland China, and Japan, he earned his PhD in 1993 from the University of California, Berkeley, specializing in the history of the Qing dynasty under the guidance of Frederic Wakeman. Thereafter, he taught at the University of California, Santa Barbara from 1993 to 2002. After a year at the University of Michigan, Elliott came to Harvard in 2003 and was named the Mark Schwartz Professor of Chinese and Inner Asian History in the following year. He teaches a wide variety of courses including the History of Relations between China and Inner Asia and the famous \"Qing Documents\" seminar, and is considered a prominent scholar of the New Qing History school. His The Manchu Way: The Eight Banners and Ethnic Identity in Late Imperial China is a representative work of the Manchu-centered theory of Qing history. Elliott also oversees the Department's instruction in Manchu and Mongolian language. Beginning in 2015, he has served as Vice Provost of International Affairs at Harvard.\nIn March 2018, Elliott inaugurated Harvard's Lakshmi Mittal South Asia Institute in New Delhi.\nSelected works\nIn a statistical overview derived from writings by and about Mark Elliott OCLC/WorldCat encompasses roughly 10+ works in 20+ publications in 3 languages and 600+ library holdings.\nBooks\n*Emperor Qianlong: Son of Heaven, Man of the World.
