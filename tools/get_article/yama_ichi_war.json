When he died of natural causes in 1981, then wakagashira (underboss) Kenichi Yamamoto was in prison and the other top lieutenants decided to wait for his release. However, in early 1982, Yamamoto suddenly died of liver failure.  After his death, the top lieutenants could not immediately elect a boss, and they temporarily chose Hiroshi Yamamoto  as acting boss and Masahisa Takenaka as wakagashira.\nThe circumstances that precipitated the conflict were as follows: Hiroshi Yamamoto, accompanied by 18 of his lieutenants and 3,000 other individuals, seceded from the Yamaguchi-gumi to establish his own organization, the Ichiwa-kai. This division stemmed from professional envy, as Yamamoto was viewed as a potential candidate for the esteemed title of kumicho, or supreme godfather, within the Yamaguchi-gumi. However, his aspirations were thwarted when Masahisa Takenaka was chosen for the role by the other members, including the influential Fumiko Taoka, widow of Kazuo Taoka.\nFeud\nOn January 26, 1985, Yamamoto sent a team of hitmen to Takenaka's girlfriend's home in Suita. While waiting for an elevator, Takenaka, underboss Katsumasa Nakayama, and one other member of the  family were shot dead, sparking a bloody nationwide conflict that came to be known as the Yama–Ichi War. The enraged Yamaguchi-gumi and its newly chosen acting boss Kazuo Nakanishi and wakagashira Yoshinori Watanabe vowed to wipe out the Ichiwa-kai in revenge.\nIn the years that followed, 36 gangsters were killed and many more were seriously wounded in an estimated 300 gun battles.[http://www.kotan.org/books/books.html TOPPAMONO: Outlaw.

My Life in Japan's Underworld] At the time, local newspapers carried daily \"scorecards\" with the latest body counts on both sides.\nThe war continued for several years, and the Yamaguchi-gumi eventually prevailed. It proved to be a pyrrhic victory however, as many of the gang's members, including Masahisa Takenaka's high-ranking brother Masashi, were arrested in the ensuing police crackdowns.  Realizing they were outnumbered and outgunned, many Ichiwa-kai members sought police protection.  With the help of a neutral Tokyo gang, the Inagawa-kai, a peace accord was finally brokered under which the remaining Ichiwa-kai defectors were allowed to rejoin the Yamaguchi-gumi.\nAftermath\nIn 1989, Yoshinori Watanabe was elected as fifth kumicho of the Yamaguchi-gumi.\nReferences"
