      "text": "# Coming of Age (Breaking Point album)\n\n}}\nComing of Age is the debut album by the American rock band Breaking Point. Originally an eight-song demo, it was released on January 16, 2001, after the band signed with Wind-up Records. The album was digitally re-released in 2014 through Bicycle Music Company.\nThe original eight-song demo was recorded between late-1999 and mid-2000. While they were promoting the demo, the band was commissioned to write \"One of a Kind\" as the entrance music for professional wrestler Rob Van Dam, which introduced many new fans to the band. From this momentum, the larger album project was conceived.\nHistory\nAfter guitar player Justin Rimer obtained a job at the famous Ardent Studios, he became an assistant engineer for such then-emerging acts as 3 Doors Down and Train. Rimer's time at the studio led to Broken getting a deal at the studio. The result was an eight-track demo record that was later the basis for Wind-Up Records to sign the band. Five of the eight tracks on the record were later remixed and used on the band's debut album sharing the same title.\nThe Extended Play version of \"Open Wide\" features an extended intro that was cut on the later-released album. The song \"Under\" also features feedback and lead guitar lines not present in the album version. Additionally, the song features older vocal takes in the verses which were re-recorded for the album.\nTrack listing\nDemo track listing\nPersonnel\n* Brett Erickson - Vocals, rhythm guitar\n* Justin Rimer - Lead guitar\n* Greg Edmondson - Bass guitar\n* Jody Abbott – Drums\n* Chapman Baehler – Photography\n* Glen DiCrocco – Photography\n* Jim Baldree – Digital editing\n* Jeff Burns – Assistant\n* David Campbell – String arrangements\n* Paul Ebersold – Producer, engineer, string arrangements\n* Ted Jensen – Mastering\n* Chris Johnson – Vocal producer\n* Greg Ladanyi – Engineer\n* Matt Martone – Producer, engineer\n* Skidd Mills – Digital editing\n* Josey Scott – Rap vocals on \"Brother\"\n* Edward Sherman – Art direction\n* Mike Shipley – Mixing\nReferences"
