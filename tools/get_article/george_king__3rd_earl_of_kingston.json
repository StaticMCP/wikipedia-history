He was created Baron Kingston in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1821, thus giving him and his descendants an automatic seat in the UK House of Lords.\nIn 1823, he demolished the existing Palladian house on the Mitchelstown estate and replaced it with a new castle designed by James and George Richard Pain. It had 60 principal and 20 minor bedrooms, a 100-foot-long (30 m) gallery, three libraries, morning room, dining room (which could seat 100 guests at one sitting) and various other facilities.\nOn 5 May 1794, he married Lady Helena, the daughter of Stephen Moore, 1st Earl Mount Cashell. They had six children:\n*Lady Helena King (11 August 1793 – 20 November 1853), married Philip Davies-Cooke on 8 December 1829\n*Edward King, Viscount Kingsborough (1795–1837), antiquarian who predeceased his father\n*Robert King, 4th Earl of Kingston (1796–1867); his heir\n*Hon. George King (20 August 1798 – 2 May 1801)\n*James King, 5th Earl of Kingston (1800–1869)\n*Lady Adelaide Charlotte King (died August 1854), married Charles Tankerville Webber (died March 1854), son of Daniel Webb Webber, on 2 August 1834\nGeorge King's sister Margaret King married his wife's brother Stephen Moore, 2nd Earl Mount Cashell.\nReferences"
