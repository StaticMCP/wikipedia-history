It is the follow-up to 2001's Intelligence and Sacrifice and is notable for the fact that the use of electronics for which Empire is famed is reduced in favour of guitars and drum beats, giving the album more of a punk/metal sound than its predecessor.\nTrack listing\n#\"Kiss of Death\" – 3:33\n#\"Night of Violence\" – 3:31\n#\"Overdose\" – 3:59\n#\"Gotta Get Out\" – 3:29\n#\"Point of No Return\" – 3:36\n#\"Vertigo\" – 3:03\n#\"Make Em Bleed\" – 3:13\n#\"Hunt You Down\" – 3:49\n#\"Uproar\" – 2:30\n#\"In Disguise\" – 3:45\n#\"Terror Alert: High\" – 3:39\n#\"XXV3\" – 4:06\nSingles\nThus far, two singles have been released from Futurist: \"Gotta Get Out\" and \"Kiss of Death\".
