The Oscar is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. It was not created until the 1956 Academy Awards, in which a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since.\nAs of 2025, Turkey has submitted thirty-two films, but none of them were nominated.\nSubmissions\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award.\nFor different reasons, many Turkish films were submitted for the category by other countries. Switzerland submitted two: 1982's Yol by Yilmaz Güney, that had to be smuggled into Switzerland for post-production due to political considerations after the 1980 Turkish coup d'état, and 1990's winner Journey of Hope, about Turkish refugees in Europe. Over the years, several other European countries have chosen films that were partially set in Turkey and featured large sections in Turkish including Austria (For a Moment, Freedom), France (Mustang), Germany (The Edge of Heaven) and Greece (A Touch of Spice).\nIn 2008, Three Monkeys made the nine-film shortlist, but it was not nominated.\nFour directors have represented Turkey more than once: Tunç Başaran, Nuri Bilge Ceylan, Semih Kaplanoğlu and Yavuz Turgul.\nBelow is a list of the films that have been submitted by Turkey for review by the academy for the award by year and the respective Academy Awards ceremony.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!
