The Mahdist forces were routed, and only Khalil and Muhammad Hassan of Fadasi, who was leading the Bela Shangul contingent, with a small group of Ansar and Berta soldiers, were able to successfully flee the battlefield.\nThis engagement represents the high water mark of Mahdist activity in what is now southwestern Ethiopia. Despite raids over the next two years, local rulers west of Leqa Neqemte, such as 'Abd ar-Rahman Khojali of Qabesh, stopped paying tribute to Omdurman (the Mahdist capital) and ignored summons to present themselves there. Further, Ras Gobana's master, (then) king Menelik II of Shewa was able to continue extending his influence into the area south of the Abay River, which followed Menelik and Gobena's defeat of the Gojjame army six years earlier in the Battle of Embabo.\nReferences"
