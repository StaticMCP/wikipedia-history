The only individual who held the post was Jamie Hepburn, who was appointed by Humza Yousaf in March 2023. It was abolished by John Swinney following the formation of his government.\nOverview\nResponsibilities\nThe specific responsibilities of the minister were:\n*Independence strategy\n*Parliamentary co-ordination and liaison\n*communication with people, businesses and organisations regarding devolution, independence and Scotland's constitutional future\nMinister\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 0 0 0 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaaaaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; \"\n|colspan=\"7\"|\nMinister for Independence\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Name\n!width=75|Portrait\n!Entered office\n!Left office\n!Party\n!First Minister\n|-\n|\n|Jamie Hepburn\n|\n|29 March 2023\n|8 May 2024\n|Scottish National Party\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Humza Yousaf\n|-\n|}\nControversy\nThe decision to create a dedicated ministerial role for independence was portrayed as a partisan move by the Scottish National Party's critics. This included Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross and Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, who argued that creating a minister for independence represented a misallocation of resources and priorities when Scotland faces numerous challenges, such as social security issues and economic recovery post-pandemic. Despite these criticisms, Yousaf defended his decision, citing it as a fulfilment of the manifesto, and the role remained until its abolition by John Swinney following Yousaf's departure in May 2024.\nSee also\n*Scottish Parliament\n*Scottish Government\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.gov.scot/about/who-runs-government/cabinet-and-ministers/ Cabinet and Ministers] on Scottish Government website"
