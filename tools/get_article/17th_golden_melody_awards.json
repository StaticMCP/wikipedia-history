The award ceremony featured South Korean pop singer Se7en as a guest artist. Chinese American rap artist Jin also performed with Taiwanese American singer Leehom Wang for their song titled Heroes of Earth.\nThe Taipei Times also dubbed the ceremony as having one of the \"worst performances to date\" due to poorly rehearsed performances by Singaporean artist Stefanie Sun and Hong Kong singer Eason Chan.\nThe 17th Golden Melody Awards were held on 10 June 2006 at the Taipei Arena in Taipei, Taiwan.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://info.gio.gov.tw/webPage.asp?CuItem=31074 17th Golden Melody Awards nominees]\n* [http://info.gio.gov.tw/webPage.asp?CuItem=31075 17th Golden Melody Awards winners]\n* [http://star-ecentral.com/photos/gallerylist.asp?pixfder=69 17th Golden Melody Awards photographs]  by The Star via the Associated Press"
