It uses finite-state machines, in contrast to most other regular expression libraries.  RE2 supports a C++ interface.\nRE2 was implemented by Google and Google uses RE2 for Google products. RE2 uses an \"on-the-fly\" deterministic finite-state automaton algorithm based on Ken Thompson's Plan 9 grep. It is designed to avoid ReDoS (regex denial of service) attacks.\nComparison to PCRE\nRE2 performs comparably to Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE). For certain regular expression operators like | (the operator for alternation or logical disjunction) it is superior to PCRE. Unlike PCRE, which supports features such as lookarounds, backreferences and recursion, RE2 is only able to recognize regular languages due to its construction using the Thompson DFA algorithm. It is also slightly slower than PCRE for parenthetic capturing operations.\nPCRE can use a large recursive stack with corresponding high memory usage and result in exponential runtime on certain patterns. In contrast, RE2 uses a fixed stack size and guarantees that its runtime increases linearly (not exponentially) with the size of the input. The maximum memory allocated with RE2 is configurable. This can make it more suitable for use in server applications, which require boundaries on memory usage and computational time.\nAdoption\nRE2 is available to users of Google Docs and Google Sheets. Google Sheets supports RE2 except Unicode character class matching.  RegexExtract does not use [https://github.com/google/re2/blob/bb8e777557ddbdeabdedea4f23613c5021ffd7b1/doc/syntax.txt#L51 grouping].\nExample\nHere is an example of using re2 against a potential ReDoS (regular expression denial of service) attack.\nimport ;\nimport std;\nusing std::string;\nusing re2::RE2;\nint main(int argc, char* argv[]) {\nstring text = \"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!\"\nstring pattern = \"(a+)+$\";\nbool match = RE2::FullMatch(text, pattern);\nstd::println(\"Match result: {}\", match);\n}\nRelated libraries\nRE2 comes with a built-in Python wrapper, available on Python Package Index (PyPI) as google-re2.\nThe built-in regexp package in Go uses the same patterns and implementation as RE2, though it is written in Go.  This is unsurprising, given Go's common staff from the Plan 9 team.\nThe RE2 algorithm has been rewritten in Rust as the package regex. CloudFlare's web application firewall uses this package because the RE2 algorithm is immune to ReDoS.\nRuss Cox also wrote RE1, an earlier regular expression based on a bytecode interpreter. OpenResty uses a RE1 fork called \"sregex\".\nThere is an official Java binding, called RE2J (com.google.re2j).\nThe following languages have unofficial bindings:\n* C (cre2)\n* D (re2d)\n* Erlang (re2)\n* Inferno (inferno-re2)\n* JavaScript (RE2JS), a port of RE2J to JavaScript\n* Node.js (node-re2)\n* OCaml (re2)\n* Perl (re-engine-RE2)\n* R (re2)\n* Ruby (re2)\n* WebAssembly (re2-wasm)\nSee also\n* Comparison of regular expression engines\nReferences"
