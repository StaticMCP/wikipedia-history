of teams.  Through the last (postseason) poll of the 2017 season, the teams and the number of times they have held the #1 weekly ranking are shown below.  The number of times a team has been ranked #1 in the postseason poll (the national champion) is shown in parentheses.\nThere has been only one tie for the leading vote-getter in a weekly poll.  In 2015, Southern Oregon was tied with Marian (IN) in the preseason poll.\nIn 1999, the results of a postseason poll, if one was conducted, are not known.  Therefore, an additional poll has been presumed, and the #1 postseason ranking has been credited to the postseason tournament champion, the Northwestern Oklahoma State Rangers.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:40%;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#4169E1; color:white;\" |Team\n!style=\"background:#4169E1; color:white;\" |Total #1 Rankings\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||57 (6)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||55 (3)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||25 (2)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||24 (2)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||20\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|Saint Francis (IN)||17 (2)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||14 (1)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||12 (1)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||5 (1)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||4 (1)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||4\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||3\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||2\n|}\nReferences"
