She became the Minister of External Affairs in the union cabinet on 26 May 2014. Swaraj was called India's \"best-loved politician\" by the US daily Wall Street Journal. She decided not to contest the 2019 Indian general election as she was recovering from a kidney transplant and needed to \"save herself from dust and stay safe from infection\" and hence did not join the second Modi Ministry in 2019.\nAccording to the doctors at AIIMS New Delhi, Swaraj succumbed to a cardiac arrest following a heart attack on the night of 6 August 2019. She was awarded the  Padma Vibhushan, India's second highest civilian award, posthumously in 2020 in the field of Public Affairs.\nEarly life and education\nSushma Swaraj (née Sharma) was born on 14 February 1952 at Ambala Cantonment, Punjab (now Haryana), into a Brahmin family, to Hardev Sharma and Shrimati Laxmi Devi.

Later, she became a national leader of the BJP.\nPolitical career\nEarly political career\nShe was a member of the Haryana Legislative Assembly from 1977 to 1982, winning the Ambala Cantonment assembly seat at the age of 25; and then, again from 1987 to 1990.

Swaraj resigned from the position in December the same year.\nMinister of Information and Broadcasting (2000–2003)\nShe was re-elected to the 12th Lok Sabha from South Delhi Parliamentary constituency for a second term, in March 1998. Under the second PM Vajpayee Government, she was sworn in as Union Cabinet Minister for Information and Broadcasting with an additional charge of the Ministry of Telecommunications from 19 March 1998 to 12 October 1998. Her most notable decision during this period was to declare film production as an industry, which made the Indian film industry eligible for bank finance. She also started community radio at universities and other institutions.\nIn September 1999, Swaraj was nominated by the BJP to contest against the Congress party's national President Sonia Gandhi in the 13th Lok Sabha election, from the Bellary constituency in Karnataka, which had always been retained by Congress politicians since the first Indian general election in 1951–52. During her campaign in Bellary, she addressed public meetings in Kannada. She secured  votes in just 12 days of her election campaign. However, she lost the election by a 7% margin.\nShe returned to Parliament in April 2000 as a Rajya Sabha member from Uttar Pradesh.

She conveyed to the British High Commissioner that they should examine Modi's request as per their rules and wrote \"if the British government chooses to give travel documents to Lalit Modi -– that will not spoil our bilateral relations\". However, some people mentioned this incident as Swaraj helping Lalit Modi in the travel visa process.\nOn 12 August 2015, the leader of the Indian National Congress, Mallikarjun Kharge, moved an Adjournment Motion in the lower house seeking the resignation of Sushma Swaraj due to her alleged conduct in this regard. Initially, the motion was rejected by the Speaker, but it was accepted on Swaraj's insistence. Intervening in the motion, Swaraj clarified that Lalit Modi's right of residency was not cancelled, since the Enforcement Directorate did not file an extradition request. The Adjournment Motion was subsequently rejected with a voice vote.\nSushma Swaraj was heavily criticised in 2014 when she urged Prime Minister Modi to declare the Bhagavad Gita as the national book of India.\nAs External Affairs Minister, she played a pivotal role in bringing back the then 23-year-old hearing and speech-impaired Indian girl named Gita who was stranded in Pakistan for 15 years.\nIn December 2015, the Norwegian government took custody of an Indian origin child from his parents citing child abuse.
