The road connects the N6 near Carnot to the N3 in Baoro, forming a north–south axis in the western region of the country. As a dirt road, the N11 provides a link between these two routes, facilitating travel and commerce in the area. However, its unpaved surface poses challenges during adverse weather conditions.\nReferences"
