It is the third and final novel in the Bitterbynde trilogy and the sequel to The Lady of Sorrows.\nPlot summary\nThe war, detailed in the previous books in the trilogy, continues between the immortals High King Angavar and Prince Morragan.  Unable to return to the Fair Realm until they find the last remaining gate, the protagonist, Tahquil, along with her friends Caitri and Viviana, vow to find the gate and return to their homeland.\nCritical reception\nPublishers Weekly called this novel a \"strong conclusion\" to the trilogy.  They also noted: \"Those who esteem the Irish and Scottish myths of faerie folk will be delighted by the magic folklore and tales within tales that fill the book. Those looking for straightforward fantasy adventure, however, may be disappointed.\"\nKirkus Reviews also thought it would appeal to the author's readers: \"Beneath the padding, overblown prose, and interminable description, a genuinely moving tragedy sometimes glimmers through. Would that Dart-Thornton had simply let her characters find their way. Still, fans of the previous shouldn't be disappointed.\"\nReferences"
