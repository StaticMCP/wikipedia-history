The oldest part of this -story timber frame may have been built as early as 1686; its exterior styling suggests a construction date in the early 18th century, but the earlier structure may have been incorporated in new construction at that time.  The house is one a few First Period houses in Newton, and was associated for many years in the 19th century with the Kingsbury family, who were major landowners in the Chestnut Hill area.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986, and included in an expansion of the Old Chestnut Hill Historic District in 1990.\nSee also\n* List of the oldest buildings in Massachusetts\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Newton, Massachusetts\nReferences"
