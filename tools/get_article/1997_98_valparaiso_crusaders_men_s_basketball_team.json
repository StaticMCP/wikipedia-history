The Crusaders, led by tenth-year head coach Homer Drew, played their home games at the Athletics–Recreation Center as members of the Mid-Continent Conference. This season is one of the most memorable in program history as the Crusaders made a run to the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA tournament. The opening round victory over Ole Miss is best known for \"The Shot\" that sparked the Crusaders' Cinderella run. The team finished with a record of 23–10 (13–3 Mid-Con).\nRoster\n)\n|asst_coach=\n*\n|roster_url=https://www.valpoathletics.com/mbasketball/roster/1997-98/\n|accessdate=\n}}\nSchedule and results\n|-\n!colspan=9 style=| Regular season\n|-\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium = Athletics-Recreation Center\n| site_cityst  = Valparaiso, Indiana\n| gamename     =\n| score        = 75–85\n| overtime     =\n| attend       = 3,011\n| record       = 0–1\n}}\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium = Afook-Chinen Civic Auditorium\n| site_cityst  = Hilo, Hawaii\n| gamename     = Big Island Invitational\n| score        = 70–58\n| overtime     =\n| attend       = NA\n| record       = 1–2\n}}\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium = Afook-Chinen Civic Auditorium\n| site_cityst  = Hilo, Hawaii\n| gamename     = Big Island Invitational\n| score        = 75–73\n| overtime     =\n| attend       = NA\n| record       = 2–3\n}}\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium = Brown County Arena\n| site_cityst  = Green Bay, Wisconsin\n| gamename     =\n| score        = 52–60\n| overtime     =\n| attend       = 3,096\n| record       = 3–4\n}}\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium = Municipal Auditorium\n| site_cityst  = Kansas City, Missouri\n| gamename     =\n| score        = 80–68\n| overtime     =\n| attend       = 1,823\n| record       = 4–5\n| conference   = 1–0\n}}\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium = Striplin Gymnasium\n| site_cityst  = Nashville, Tennessee\n| gamename     =\n| score        = 78–62\n| overtime     =\n| attend       = 230\n| record       = 5–5\n}}\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium = Western Hall\n| site_cityst  = Macomb, Illinois\n| gamename     =\n| score        = 62–63\n| overtime     =\n| attend       = 3,144\n| record       = 5–6\n| conference   = 1–1\n}}\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium = Athletics-Recreation Center\n| site_cityst  = Valparaiso, Indiana\n| gamename     =\n| score        = 82–62\n| overtime     =\n| attend       = 2,214\n| record       = 6–6\n| conference   = 2–1\n}}\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium = Athletics-Recreation Center\n| site_cityst  = Valparaiso, Indiana\n| gamename     =\n| score        = 72–69\n| overtime     =\n| attend       = 3,102\n| record       = 7–6\n| conference   = 3–1\n}}\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium = America First Event Center\n| site_cityst  = Cedar City, Utah\n| gamename     =\n| score        = 79–70\n| overtime     =\n| attend       = 3,081\n| record       = 8–6\n| conference   = 4–1\n}}\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium = Mabee Center\n| site_cityst  = Tulsa, Oklahoma\n| gamename     =\n| score        = 60–68\n| overtime     =\n| attend       = 6,910\n| record       = 8–7\n| conference   = 4–2\n}}\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium = Athletics-Recreation Center\n| site_cityst  = Valparaiso, Indiana\n| gamename     =\n| score        = 82–80\n| overtime     =\n| attend       = 3,012\n| record       = 9–7\n| conference   = 5–2\n}}\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium = Athletics-Recreation Center\n| site_cityst  = Valparaiso, Indiana\n| gamename     =\n| score        = 87–73\n| overtime     =\n| attend       = 4,339\n| record       = 10–7\n}}\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium = Athletics-Recreation Center\n| site_cityst  = Valparaiso, Indiana\n| gamename     =\n| score        = 66–69\n| overtime     =\n| attend       = 4,413\n| record       = 10–8\n| conference   = 5–3\n}}\n|-\n!colspan=12 style=| Mid-Con tournament\n| overtime     =\n| attend       = NA\n| record       = 21–9\n}}\n|-\n!colspan=12 style=| NCAA tournament\n| overtime     =\n| attend       = 13,349\n| record       = 22–9\n}}\n| attend       = 13,369\n| record       = 23–9\n}}\n| overtime     =\n| attend       = 22,172\n| record       = 23–10\n}}\nSource\nRankings\n1998 NBA draft\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| 1 || 16 || Bryce Drew || Houston Rockets\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n|}\nReferences"
