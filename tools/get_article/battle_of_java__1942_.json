It occurred on the island of Java from 28 February – 12 March 1942. It involved forces from the Empire of Japan, which invaded on 28 February 1942, and Allied personnel. Allied commanders signed a formal surrender at Japanese headquarters at Bandung on 12 March.\nBackground\nThe Japanese forces were composed of a western and an eastern invasion force. On 18 February, the western force sailed from Cam Ranh Bay with 56 transports carrying the 16th Army Headquarters, 2nd Infantry Division, the 38th Infantry Division, and the 230th Infantry Regiment. On 8 February, the eastern force sailed from Lingayen Gulf with 41 transports carrying elements of the 56th Regimental Combat Group. Their goal was the capture of the Kalidjati airfield, where Japanese bombers and fighters would then be based in support of the invasion.\nThe allies naval forces under the command of Helfrich, were likewise deployed into an Eastern Strike Force out of Soerabaja, and a Western Strike Force out of Tanjung Priok. On 25 February Helfrich combined these forces when the Japanese eastern force was spotted moving south from Balikpapan. Exeter and Perth then joined De Ruyter, Java, with their associated destroyer screens. Air coverage was provided by six Brewster F2A Buffalos and seven Hawker Hurricanes.\nThe Allied forces were commanded by the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) commander, General Hein ter Poorten. Java Air Command was led by Ludolph Hendrik van Oyen. The 6th Infantry Regiment remained in eastern Java to guard the naval base, while remaining troops were deployed to western Java. West Group of 21,200 troops, was led by W. Schilling, consisting of the 1st Infantry Regiment and Blackforce. Java Bandoeng Group of 5,900 troops, was led by Jacob Pesman, consisting of the 4th Infantry Regiment and the IInd Mountain Artillery Battalion.\nlight tank of the 3rd Hussars disembarks at Sumatra on 14 February 1942.]]\nThe British, Australian and United States units were commanded by British Major General H. D. W. Sitwell. The British forces were predominantly anti-aircraft units: the 77th Heavy AA Regiment, 21st Light AA Regiment and 48th Light AA Regiment. The only British armoured unit on Java was B squadron from the British 3rd Hussars, which was equipped with light tanks. Two British AA regiments without guns, the 6th Heavy AA Regt and the 35th Light AA Regiment, were equipped as infantry to defend airfields. The British also had transport and administrative units.\nThe Australian formationnamed \"Blackforce\" after its commander, Brigadier Arthur Blackburn V.C.included the Australian 2/3rd Machine Gun Battalion, the Australian 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion, 2/6th Field Company Royal Australian Engineers, a platoon from the 2/1st Headquarters Guard Battalion, about 100 reinforcements diverted en route to Singapore, a handful of soldiers who had escaped from Singapore following its fall to the Japanese, two transport companies, a casualty clearing station, and a company headquarters unit. Blackburn decided to re-organise his troops as an infantry brigade. They were well equipped in terms of Bren guns, light armoured cars, and trucks, but they had few rifles, sub-machine guns, anti-tank rifles, mortars, grenades, radio equipment or Bren gun carriers. Blackburn managed to assemble an HQ staff and three infantry battalions based on the 2/3rd Machine Gun, the 2/2nd Pioneers, and a mixed \"Reserve Group\".\nThe only U.S. ground forces in Java, the 2nd Battalion of the 131st Field Artillery (a Texas National Guard unit intended for the Philippines) was attached to Black Force.\nJapanese landings\n, 1 March 1942]]\nmoving through Java.]]\nOn 27 February, Helfich ordered the evacuation of all seaworthy ships in Tjilatjap after Chūichi Nagumo's 1st Air Fleet was sighted to the south. On 28 February, Helfich ordered Koenraad to evacuate Soerabaja. On 1 March, Helfich then dissolved the Allied Naval Forces on Java, freeing William A. Glassford's United States Navy ships to head for Exmouth Gulf, and Arthur Palliser's Royal Navy ships to head for India. Helfich also ordered damaged Dutch submarines to head for Colombo, while those remaining were ordered to resist as long as possible, then break out or be scuttled. Starting on 2 March, remaining Dutch ships in the Netherlands East Indies were scuttled over the next week, along with the destruction of the Morokrembangan Naval Air Base and Perak Airfield.\nThe Japanese troops landed at three points on Java on 1 March. The West Java invasion convoy landed on Bantam Bay near Merak and Eretan Wetan. The West Java convoy had previously fought in the Battle of Sunda Strait, a few hours prior to the landings.\nMeanwhile, the East Java invasion convoy landed on Kragan after having defeated the ABDA fleet in the Battle of the Java Sea.\nOn 3 March, the U.S. Navy gunboat  was sunk south of Java by a Japanese naval squadron consisting of the destroyers Arashi and Nowaki, and the heavy cruiser Maya. Only one member of her crew survived.\nAccording to P.C. Boer, \"In the night of 28 February on 1 March 1942, in the middle of the 'wet' monsoon season, the Japanese troops landed in Java and the last phase in the final battle for the Netherlands East Indies began.\" The Japanese Sixteenth Army , composed of Masao Maruyama's 2nd Division and the Shōji Division, landed 23,500 men in western Java near Merak, in the Bay of Bantam, and near Eretan Wetan. They were opposed by 27,000 KNIL and allied troops. The landings at Eretan Wetan threatened Bandoeng, location of the KNIL logistic center with its warehouses and workshops. The 48th Division objective was Rembang and the Cepu Oil Field. The Sakaguchi Detachment objective was Cilacap.\nWest Java campaign\nOn 23 January, invasion plans were agreed in Manila between the Japanese 3rd Fleet and the Sixteenth Army under Hitoshi Imamura.\nThe convoy consisted of 56 transport ships with troops aboard from 16th Army Headquarters, 2nd Division and 3rd mixed regiment.

The convoy escort was under the command of Rear Admiral Kenzaburo Hara.\nAt 01:30 on 1 March, the Japanese 2nd Division, led by Yumio Nasu's 2nd Infantry, landed on the Merak coast, followed by Kyūsaku Fukushima's 4th Infantry Regiment, and Hanshichi Satō's 29th Infantry Regiment. The division objective was to rush towards Buitenzorg, and divide the allies between Batavia and Bandung.\nOn 1 March, Toshinari Shōji's unit captured the Kalidjati air base after their Eretan Wetan landing, and the 3rd Hiko Dan transferred fighter and assault aircraft there the next day.\nOn 2 March, the Nasu detachment reached the area between Lawangtaji and Bunar, the Fukushima detachment reached Pamarayan, the Satō held Kragilan, while the 2nd Division command post reached Petir.

Pesman made the following radio broadcast, \"The Japanese Army succeeded in breaking through into the intermountain area of Bandung. It has taken complete command of the air, which made it impossible for us to put up resistance for long in the intermountain area of Bandung. Therefore, we had no choice but to hold ceasefire negotiations. The Japanese Army demanded prompt talks with our governor-general and me. In these\ntalks, the Japanese Army commander made the following demands on 8 March: 1. Our overall surrender. 2. A prompt discontinuance of all hostilities. 3. The raising of white flags as a proof of our overall surrender. 4. All forces shall be disarmed and handed over. For this purpose, after disarmament, units in positions shall assemble at clearly visible places, and other units in barracks. Collected weapons and ammunition shall be gathered and put under supervision. 5. The demands stated in Items 1 to 4 shall be completed by 1200 on 9 March. 6. Bodies identified as Japanese military, goods of [Japanese] prisoners of war, and deceased and living Japanese residents shall be promptly handed over. 7. Any kind of destruction is prohibited. For example, the destruction of war materials, weapons, ammunition, roads or traffic structures is forbidden. 8. Communication with foreign countries is prohibited. 9. The operations of the Japanese Army shall be continued. 10. If the above demands are not met, attacks will be immediately resumed. In order to ensure [compliance with] the demands, armed patrol units necessary to maintain public order shall be formed and provided with a certain amount of weapons and ammunition. These patrol units need to be supervised by officers as much as possible. The patrol units shall be made distinguishable by a white armband and a white flag. After due consideration, I finally had no option but to meet these stipulated demands. I order you to suspend the current hostilities and obey the above-mentioned demands. When you have received this order, or when you have been contacted by the Japanese Army\ncommander, I ask you to communicate or broadcast [this] through the available radio communication facilities and broadcasting stations, on every whole hour and every thirty minutes starting at 0900 until 1200. This order applies also to the Navy and all directors of customs.\" The Shōji detachment then entered Bandung.\nEast Java campaign\nOn 1 March, Abe Kōichi's 48th Infantry Group started landing at Kragan.
