      "text": "# Tom Howard (comedian)\n\nThomas Black Jr. (June 16, 1885 &ndash; February 27, 1955), known professionally as Tom Howard, was an Irish-born American comedian in burlesque, vaudeville, radio, film, television and Broadway plays. He co-wrote and starred in the radio comedy show It Pays to Be Ignorant.\nHe was born to Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Black in County Tyrone, Ireland. The family emigrated to the United States when he was 11 months old.\nIn 1905, he embarked on his show business career, taking the stage name Tom Howard. After decades of working in medicine shows, burlesque, vaudeville and a few Broadway plays, he made his breakthrough in two Broadway musicals, Rain or Shine (1928) and Flo Ziegfeld's Smiles (1930), the latter at a salary of $1100 a week. He appeared in two feature films, Rain or Shine (1930, repeating his stage role) and Get That Venus (1933).\nHoward became better known in movie short subjects, filmed in New York by Paramount and then Educational. Many of these featured Howard's longtime burlesque and vaudeville partner George Shelton (1885–1971).\nHoward owned, co-wrote, and starred in the radio comedy show It Pays to Be Ignorant, which aired from 1942 to 1951, first on the Mutual Broadcasting System, then CBS, and finally NBC. And pay it did: a July 1949 Royal Bank of Canada Monthly Letter stated his salary was a staggering $219,000. Purporting to be a quiz show, the program had Howard posing ridiculous questions (\"What color is a red stoplight?\"), to which his panel of \"experts\"&mdash;Harry McNaughton, Lulu McConnell, and George Shelton&mdash;supplied dull-witted responses (\"Where is this stoplight located?\"). Howard's daughter Ruth wrote many of the show's jokes and scripts. The same cast brought the show to television, where it was broadcast as a summer-replacement series on CBS from June 6 to September 19, 1949, and on NBC from July 5 to September 27, 1951. Howard signed off every show with \"Good night and good nonsense!\"\nHoward died of a \"heart ailment\" at the age of 69 in Long Branch, New Jersey.\nFilmography\n:All shorts, with the exception of Rain or Shine and Get That Venus.\n:May be incomplete.\n:''Sourced from Howard's IMDb filmography, unless otherwise specified.\n* Hold Up (1929)\n* The Spy (1929)\n* Rain or Shine (1930)\n* One Good Urn Deserves Another (1930)\n* The African Dodger (1931)\n* Two A.M.
