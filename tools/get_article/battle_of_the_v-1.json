It was written by Jack Hanley, Eryk Wlodek and Bernard Newman based on Newman's 1955 novel They Saved London .\nPlot\nThe film tells the story of a Polish Resistance group, which discovers details of the manufacture of the German V-1 'Flying Bomb' at Peenemünde in 1943. Liaising with service chiefs in London, the group manage to pass on enough information to convince them to launch a bombing raid and, in the climax to the film, are able to steal a V-1 which lands in a field during testing and arrange for its transport back to the United Kingdom.\nMessages are got out from the camp via the dentist (at the loss of one tooth). The Poles are warned that a British bombing raid on Peenemünde is imminent and that they should prepare to escape during the raid.\nFollowing their escape, the second part of the film looks at the attempts to find an entire V-1 to send back to Britain. They are eventually rewarded by an unexploded V-1 landing in a field which they quickly conceal from the German search team. Through convoluted means, they send the dismantled weapon back to Britain just before the critical first use of this terrible weapon.\nCast\n* Michael Rennie as Stefan\n* Patricia Medina as Zofia\n* Milly Vitale as Anna\n* David Knight as Tadek\n* Esmond Knight as Stricker\n* Christopher Lee as Brunner\n* John G.

All the stock devices for screwing up tension are used shamelessly and repetitively – handing over information under the nose of German guards, bombs being rendered harmless by amateurs, aeroplanes that refuse to start while enemy patrols creep nearer and nearer... On the other hand the material is taken from actual history, and some of the sequences are authentic German newsreels of V.1 tests. It is a pity that the real heroism and daring of the 'people who stole and smuggled out the bomb are reduced to stripcartoon proportions by writing, direction, and acting of slapdash predictability.\"\nIn The Radio Times Guide to Films Allen Eyles gave the film 2/5 stars, writing: \"Weakly cast and excessively long&nbsp;... The low-budget production awkwardly mixes documentary footage from old enemy newsreels with standard underground heroics that were filmed in the Sussex countryside.\"\nIn British Sound Films: The Studio Years 1928–1959 David Quinlan rated the film as \"average\", writing: \"True-life war exploits trivialised into conventional action film.\"\nSee also\n*Home Army and V-1 and V-2\n*Operation Most III\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
