Like other countries with a vice president, if the president dies, resigned or is unable to complete his term, then the vice president becomes president.\nThe president has the authority to appoint the vice president from among the members of the Executive Committee, based on a nomination by the Committee's chairman and with the approval of its members. The president may assign duties to the vice president, relieve them of their position, or accept their resignation.\nThe position was established on 24 April 2025, during a session of the Palestinian Central Council. The decision was approved by 170 members present, with one opposing vote and one abstention.  The selection took place on 26 April during a meeting of the Executive Committee, where the current secretary Hussein al-Sheikh expected to be assigned the position.\nList of vice presidents (2025–present)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | No.\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Portrait\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Name\n! colspan=\"3\" | Term\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Political party\n! rowspan=\"2\" | President\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Ref.\n|-\n!
