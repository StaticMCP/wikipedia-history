It is one of the oldest sports clubs in Iceland, founded on 21 April 1908. Originally founded as a football club, it is now a multi-sport club that also operates divisions in handball, tennis, table tennis, karate and skiing. All sports include both male and female teams.\nIts men's football team currently plays in the top-tier Besta deildin and has won seven national championship titles and five Cup titles.\nVíkingur's handball department is one of the more successful ones in Iceland, with its men's team having won seven national championships and the women's handball team having won three national championships.\nCrest and colours\nClub crest\nÞorbjörn Þórðarson, who was the chairman of the Vikingur in the period of 1943–44, designed the original Víkingur badge.  In the foreground of Vikingur's original crest is a brownish 19th century leather ball framed with white badges and has red and black stripes in the background.\nTeam outfit\nVíkingur have played in red and black striped outfits since the club's early years.\nHome ground\nVíkin\nFacilities and home ground are located at Víkin since 1984 when a football pitch was first laid there. The club residence followed in 1988 and indoor facilities were built in 1991, significantly improving the overall facilities. Víkin is located in the district of Fossvogur (Háaleiti & Bústaðir), on the east side of Reykjavík.\nVíkingsvöllur\nThe sports venue was constructed in 2004 and completed in 2005. Víkingsvöllur holds around 2000 spectators when at maximum capacity using side-stands.\nYouth training\nThe youth training program at Víkin is notable for its contribution to the Iceland national senior and youth teams, providing in recent years players such as Kári Árnason, Sölvi Ottesen, Kolbeinn Sigþórsson, Aron Elís Þrándarson and Óttar Magnús Karlsson.\nClub history\nThe Founding Fathers of Víkingur (1908)\nVíkingur Reykjavik was founded on the 21 April 1908 with the purpose of financing a ball purchase for a group of boys in a Reykjavik neighborhood to play football. The club's inaugural meeting, with 32 boys present, was held in the basement of Túngata 12 in Reykjavik.\nThe founding fathers of Víkingur Reykjavik Football Club were:\n*Axel Andrésson (12 years old) who initially chaired the board of directors.\n*Emil Thoroddsen (9 years old) who served as a secretary.\n*Davíð Jóhannesson (11 years old) who took on the role of treasurer.\n*Páll Andrésson and Þórður Albertsson.\nThe Unbeaten Decade (1908–1918)\nIn the first 10 years of Vikingur's history, the team failed to win in only a single match. In that period Vikingur scored 58 goals and conceded 16. However, the team did not win a single title in that time due to them not yet having a regular senior side to play in the Icelandic Championship.\nFirst Championship Titles (1918–1947)\nThe Viking's first match in the Championship took place on 9 June 1918&nbsp;– when the team ensured a 5–0 victory over their rivals Valur. Two years later the club won its first Championship title. The second Championship title came in 1924.\nDuring the first 40 years of Vikingur's history, the club did not to have any actual club facilities.\nResidence at Suðurgata (1947–1950)\nVikingur's first residence was a former \"Iglo officers club\" in Camp Tripoli at Suðurgata which the club took on lease in the years between 1946 and 1950 by promises of being slotted an area of land south of University of Iceland at Vatnsmýri.  The residence at Camp Tripoli proved to be a true lever for the club for a period of time, since in Víkingur's first decades, meetings were held in various places in Reykjavik and the club did not have any sporting facilities. Vikingur was later assigned an area of land in conjunction with Íþróttafélag Reykjavíkur at Vatnsmýri.\nHæðargarður & First Cup Win (1950–1975)\nFollowing the years at Suðurgata, Víkingur continued its search for a suitable club location since the given area at Vatnsmýri was considered too small for the club.\nIn 1953, building constructions began for a new club house at Hæðargarður in the district of Bústaða- og smáíbúðahverfi Reykjavíkur, which at the time was being organized. However, despite the new club house, the club's working environment was poor as there were no sporting facilities or home pitch. Training continued to take place in various settings in Reykjavik.\nVíkingur's first Icelandic Cup title in men's football came in the year 1971, when the team was victorious in the final over rivals UBK Kópavogur, 1–0.\nGrowth in Fossvogur (since 1976)\nIt wasn't until the year 1976 that Víkingur got assigned an area of land in Fossvogur and began to build up its residence and sporting facilities. In general, the main service area of the club is demarcated by Fossvogsdalur, Kringlumýrarbraut, Miklabraut and Reykjanesbraut.\nMuch work was done to prepare the grounds in Fossvogur during the years of 1981,1982 and 1983 when the Vikingur team clinched the first consecutive football Championship- and Super Cup titles in the club's history. A couple of years later, in 1984, footballers could start training at Víkin. Construction of the indoor facilities were completed in 1991. Construction began in 2004 on the sports venue at Víkin and was inaugurated in 2005. Víkin seats around 1,200 spectators. In the 2015 season, the men's football team will take part in the UEFA Europa League, having reached the club's highest league position of 4th place since winning the Championship in 1991.\nLeague history\nMen's football\n*1918–56: Division 1\n*1957–69: Division 2\n*1970: Division 1\n*1971: Division 2\n*1972: Division 1\n*1973: Division 2\n*1974–85: Division 1\n*1986–87: Division 2\n*1988–93: Division 1\n*1994: Division 2\n*1995: Division 1\n*1996–98: Division 2\n*1999: Division 1\n*2000–03: Division 2\n*2004: Division 1\n*2005: Division 2\n*2006–07: Division 1\n*2008–10: Division 2\n*2011: Division 1\n*2012–13: Division 2\n*2014–: Division 1\n2013 Season\nAfter a period of struggle and re-organization at Víkin in the 2012 season, the Víkingur team won promotion to the football Championship.\nAron Elís Þrándarson was chosen both as the 'most promising' and 'best' player in the league.\n2014 Season\nHaving regained their place in the football Championship in 2013, the team finished 4th place, achieving the club's highest league position since 1991.\n2015 Season\nVíkingur men's team played their first Europa League qualifiers since 1992, and admit a 2–3 defeat on aggregate against Slovenian team FC Koper.\nArnþór Ingi Kristinsson scored both of Víkingur's goals in the away clash against FC Koper. Ólafur Þórðarson parted ways with the club.\n2016 Season\nOnly lacking the temporal difference to challenge for a spot in the Europa League qualification the team's fate was a mid-table finish.\nÓttar Magnús Karlsson was the standout player in the team as he was chosen 'most promising player' in the league.\n2017 Season\nThe season turned sharply by Miloš Milojević surprise resignation from the gaffers position early in the season.\nThis event cued the return to home of the then retired multiple championship winner and fans favourite Logi Ólafsson, who steered them to a safe mid-table finish.\n2018 Season\nMemorable for lively supporters match day experiences at Víkin, the 2018 early season performance was however highly affected by sloppy pitch conditions.\nAcclaimed Iceland International Sölvi Geir Ottesen made his return to Víkin - now alternatively known as the 'Homeground of Happiness'.\nAt the end of the season Logi Ólafsson moved back into retirement passing the managerial position to his assistant and former International Arnar Gunnlaugsson.\n2019 Season\nPlayers\nMen's Football - Current Squad\nMen's Football - Out on loan\nManagerial history – men's football\n20th century\n* Axel Andrésson (1908–24)\n* Guðjón Einarsson (1935–1938)\n* Fritz Buchloh (1939–)\n* Eggert Jóhannesson (1969)(1971)\n* Pétur Bjarnason (1973)\n* Billy Haydock (1976–1978)\n* Antony Sanders (1974–1975)\n* Yuri Illichev (1978–79)\n* Yuri Sedov (1980–82)(87–89)\n* Jean-Paul Colonval (1983)\n* Björn Árnason (1984–85)\n* Hafsteinn Tómasson (1985)\n* Logi Ólafsson (1990–92)\n* Lárus Guðmundsson (1993)\n* Kjartan Másson (1994)\n* Pétur Pétursson (1995)\n* Aðalsteinn Aðalsteinsson (1996)\n* Magnús Þorvaldsson (1997)\n21st century\n* Luka Kostić (1998–00)\n* Björn Bjartmarz (2001)\n* Luka Kostić (2002)\n* Sigurður Jónsson (2003–05)\n* Magnús Gylfason (2006–07)\n* Jesper Tollefsen (2007–08)\n* Leifur Garðarsson (2009–11)\n* Andri Marteinsson (2011)\n* Bjarnólfur Lárusson (2011)\n* Ólafur Þórðarson (2011–15)\n*  Miloš Milojević (2015–17)\n* Logi Ólafsson (2017–18)\n* Arnar Gunnlaugsson (2018–25)\n* Sölvi Ottesen (2025–present)\nNotable former players\nFollowing players have represented Víkingur and either made at least 100 league appearances for the club, or made at least 10 appearances for their national team.\n* Helgi Sigurðsson\n* Arnór Guðjohnsen\n* Kári Árnason\n* Sölvi Ottesen\n* Kolbeinn Sigþórsson\n* Aron Elís Þrándarson\n* Óttar Magnús Karlsson\n* Richard Keogh\n* Kemar Roofe\nPlayer records\nMen's football - Most appearances\nIn the current squad, Halldór Smári is the most capped player for Víkingur with 301 matches followed by Dofri Snorrason with 186.\nDavid Örn Atlason has 142 matches and Sölvi Geir Ottesen has 84 matches to his name.
