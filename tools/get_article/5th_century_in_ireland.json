The Annals of the Four Masters dates his accession to 378 and death to 405. The chronology of Geoffrey Keating's Foras Feasa ar Éirinn broadly agrees, dating his reign from 368 to 395, and associating his raiding activities in Great Britain with the kidnapping of Saint Patrick. However, the traditional roll of kings and its chronology is now recognised as artificial. The High Kingship did not become a reality until the 9th century, and Niall's legendary status has been inflated in line with the political importance of the dynasty he founded. Based on Uí Néill genealogies and the dates given for his supposed sons and grandsons, modern historians believe that he is likely to have lived some 50 years later than the traditional dates, dying circa 450.\n;410\n*At about this date, with the end of Roman rule in Britain, raiders from Ireland such as the Uí Liatháin and Laigin harry the coasts of Britain. They plunder towns and capture slaves but later colonise large areas of Gwynedd, in particular the Llŷn Peninsula, the coasts of Arllechwedd and Arfon and Anglesey.\n430s\n;431\n*Palladius sent by Pope Celestine I as bishop to Irish Christians\n;432\n*Saint Patrick arrives in Ireland to help convert pagan Gaelic kings to Christianity (traditional date) (but see also 456)\n;435 or 436\n*Death of Bressal Belach, King of Leinster\n440s\n;440\n*Death of Amalgaid mac Fiachrae, king of Connacht whose death led to a long-running dispute over the succession\n;444\n*Niall of the Nine Hostages active in Ireland and Britain (but see the year 405 as well)\n*Armagh founded as the chief church in Ireland.\n;445\n* Death of Dathí/Nath Í mac Fiachrae\n;446\n* Battle of Femen, in Brega; Mac Cairthinn mac Coelboth, King of Leinster, killed\n;447\n* Death of Secundinus/St Seachnaill, bishop in Ireland, on 27 November, founder of Dunshaughlin\n450s\n;450\n*Probable date of fall of Ulaid over-kingdom\n*Approximate date of the foundation by St Macculin of a monastery at Lusk\n*Death of Niall Noígíallach (see the entry for 405 for more on this)\n;451\n*Probable year of birth of Brigid of Kildare (Saint Brigid)\n;453\n*Probable date of death of Niall of the Nine Hostages (but see also the years 405 and 450)\n*Probable date of the start of the reign of Óengus mac Nad Froích, first Christian king of Munster\n;454\n*Lóegaire mac Néill, King of Tara, celebrates Feis Temro (Feast of Tara), pagan inauguration rite.\n;456\n* Suggested date  - 5 April - for arrival of St. Patrick in Ireland (but see also 432)\n;457\n*Probable death of Palladius\n;459\n* Death of Auxilius, missionary bishop in Ireland, founder of Killashee, County Kildare\n460s\n;461 or 462\n* Death of Lóegaire mac Néill, King of Tara, son of Niall Noígiallach, who founded the kingdom of Tír Eógain (modern County Tyrone)\n;464\n* The murder of King Conall Gulban of Donegal by the Masraighe at Magh Slécht\n;465\n* Death of Iserninus, missionary bishop in Ireland (Epsop Fith), founder of Kilcullen, County Kildare, and Aghade, County Carlow\n* Death of Eógan mac Néill, son of Niall Noígiallach, who founded the kingdom of Tír Eógain (modern County Tyrone) (but see also 461)\n;467\n* Death of St. Benigius, Bishop of Armagh\n;468\n* Battle of Bri Ele\n;469\n* Ailill Molt mac Nath Í/Dathí celebrates Feis Temro\n470s\n;470\n* First Battle of Dumha Aichir\n;476\n* First Battle of Granard\n480s\n;480\n* Second Battle of Granard\n;481\n* Death of St. Iarliathe mac Treno, third bishop of Armagh\n;482\n* Battle of Ochae (in Mide or Leinster).
