He joined the Independent Labour Party in 1928, and in 1930 co-founded the Marxian League (aka Marxist League). He joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1931, but was expelled the following year. He was one of the founders in 1932 of the Communist League, and remained active in International Left Opposition groups until he was drafted into the army in 1943. He worked as an adult education tutor.\nIn 1946, Dewar stood unsuccessfully for the ILP in the Battersea North by-election.\nIn early 1938 in London, Dewar married Margareta Watzova (1901-1995), a fellow Communist and Trotskyist, who had been born in Latvia in the Russian Empire.\nDewar died in West Sussex in 1980.\nSelected bibliography\n*Within the Thunder.
