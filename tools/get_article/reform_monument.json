A Roman doric column, it is surmounted by arms of Earl Marischal, inspired by the gateway of Inverugie Castle. (Architectural historian Charles McKean wrote that the arms were \"robbed\" from the castle.)\nThe Reform Monument should not be confused with the Reform Tower in the Meethill area of Peterhead, built a year earlier.\nSee also\n*List of listed buildings in Peterhead, Aberdeenshire\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://portal.historicenvironment.scot/designation/LB39673 REFORM MONUMENT, BROAD STREET] – Historic Environment Scotland"
