J.D. Shapiro later accepted his Worst Screenplay award in a radio program. The record was then beaten by Jack and Jill (with the total of 12 nominations and 10 wins).\nFollowing the 21st Golden Raspberry Awards on March 24, 2001, the film production and distribution company, Franchise Pictures, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on August 18, 2004.\nAwards and nominations\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\" align=\"centre\"\n|-\n!
