Gérard initially produced the painting as an official portrait of Napoleon I for his throne room at the Tuileries Palace. It was later moved to the Palace of Versailles. The painting spent time at the Louvre, at the Élysée Palace (from 1849 to 1851 under the presidency of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte), then at the Château de Saint-Cloud before returning to Versailles in 1894.\nDescription\nThe painting depicts the emperor Napoleon I at his coronation on 2 December 1804.  He is standing before a blue-cushioned gilt throne, wearing a white robe embroidered with gold thread, a long red  trimmed with ermine, and white .  His head is crowned with golden laurels, and he is wearing a golden collar of the Légion d'honneur.  He is holding a staff topped by an eagle in his right hand, and his left hand is resting by his side; further to his right is a stool bearing an orb and cross and an ivory-headed sceptre, a  typical of the French Crown Jewels.\nThe work measures  – with its frame,  – and weighs .  Many copies were produced during the First French Empire.  There are workshop paintings at, for example, the Château de Fontainebleau in Fontainebleau, the Hôtel des Invalides in Paris, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam (on loan from the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen since 1922), the  Pushkin Museum in Moscow, the Hofburg in Vienna, and the Deutsches Historisches Museum in Berlin.\nCapodimonte Museum\n]]\nA copy is now in the Capodimonte Museum in Naples, probably after being taken there by Joachim Murat, although it is not known where it was first exhibited. When the Bourbons were restored to the throne of Naples, the painting was initially moved off public display and into a barn at the Palace of Portici. The work was attributed to Gérard in the 1840s and the work was moved to the main floor of the palace. In an 1874 inventory, the work was reattributed to Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson and moved to the Palace of Capodimonte, where it still hangs in Room 54 within the Royal Apartments.\nDespite being a copy, the work has several notable differences to the original. In the copy, the figure's pose is modelled on that of Michaelangelo's David, standing with the sceptre of Charles V of France in one hand and a gold laurel wreath on his head. To his left is a cushion bearing the hand of justice and an orb, whilst there is a throne in the background. The work's celebratory tone is reinforced by a French-made frame surmounted by emblems of Napoleon.\nGallery of contemporaneous copies\nFile:François Gérard - Napoléon Ier en costume du Sacre - Musée national du château de Fontainebleau.jpg|Château de Fontainebleau\nFile:Berlín François Gerard Napoleón 01.JPG|Deutsches Historisches Museum, Berlin\nFile:Napoleon after Gerard Hofburg Wien.jpg|Hofburg, Vienna\nFile:Napoleão B. ed.
