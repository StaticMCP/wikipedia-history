He carried every county in the state. Sanders won all major demographics—age, gender, income and educational attainment levels. The electorate in Vermont was 95% white, with voters backing Sanders 86–13.\nAfter voting in the primary, Sanders said of his chances in other Super Tuesday contests: \"I am confident that if there is a large voter turnout today across this country, we will do well [...] If not we're going to be struggling.\"\nSee also\n* 2016 Vermont Republican presidential primary\nReferences"
