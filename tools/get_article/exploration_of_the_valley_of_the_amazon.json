Gibbon, who were lieutenants in the United States Navy. Volume I was written by Herndon, and Volume II was written by Gibbon. The publication was originally a report about their exploration, consisting of 442 pages. During the exploration, Herndon divided the main party into two groups so that he and Gibbon could explore different regions of the area.\nExpedition\nIn 1851, Herndon was ordered by the United States Navy to head an expedition exploring the Valley of the Amazon, a vast uncharted area. Departing from Lima, Peru, on May 21, 1851, Herndon, Gibbon, and a small party of six men headed into the wild.\nThe group split up into two and took different routes in order to cover a wider area and gather more information. After a journey of , which took Herndon through the wilderness from sea level to heights of , Herndon reached the city of Pará, Brazil on April 11, 1852.\nPublication\nOn 26 January 1853, Herndon submitted an illustrated 414-page report to John P. Kennedy, the Secretary of the Navy. The report was later published as Exploration of the Valley of the Amazon.\nThe two volumes, one written by Herndon and the other by Gibbon, described many “unusual” aspects of the Valley of the Amazon in detail. In response, \"10,000 additional copies [were to] be printed for the use of the Senate.” Three months later, another 20,000 copies were ordered; the book became an international best-seller.\nTheir orders were to report on all possible conditions in the Amazon region that they would each have to traverse alone from Lima, Peru on the Pacific coast to Para, Brazil, the mouth of the Amazon. The two volumes were published by presidential order.\nBackground documents\n32D CONGRESS, }       SENATE       {EXECUTIVE\n2d Session No. 36.\nEXPLORATION OF THE VALLEY OF THE AMAZON,\nMADE UNDER DIRECTION OF THE NAVY DEPARTMENT,\nBY\nWM.

Lardner Gibbon, under instructions of the Navy Department, bearing date February 15, 1851.\nThe desire expressed by the department for an early report of my exploration of the Amazon, and the general interest manifested in the public mind with regard to the same, have induced me to lay before you at once as full an account of our proceedings as can be made before the return of my companion. The general map which accompanies the report is based upon maps published by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, but corrected and improved according to my own personal observations, and information obtained by me whilst in that country.\nThe final report of the expedition will be submitted as soon after Lieut. Gibbon's return as practicable. I am in daily expectation of intelligence from him. At the latest accounts (26 July 1852) he was at Trinidad de Moxos, on the Mamoré, in the Republic of Bolivia, making his preparations for the descent of the Madeira.\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\nWM.
