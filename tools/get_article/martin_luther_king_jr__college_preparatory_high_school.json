The school was further expanded in 1959 with the addition of two portable classrooms.\nOn July 1, 2014, the newly formed Frayser Community Schools, a part of the Achievement School District, took over Frayser High School and renamed it MLK Jr. College Preparatory High.\nReplacement\nIn 2021, Shelby County Schools announced plans to replace MLK Prep High School and Trezevant High School with a new school.
