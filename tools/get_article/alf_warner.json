He made his debut for Tottenham on 6 September 1902 in the Southern League at home against Queens Park Rangers. The game finished in a 0–0 draw. He played in all the London League games that season helping Tottenham to win the trophy. Tottenham released Warner from his contract in 1905 and he then signed for Luton Town. He played for the club for two years and then retired. He was however persuaded to return to Notts County, but only played a few games before permanently retiring.\nHonours\nTottenham Hotspur\n* London League: 1902–03\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*"
