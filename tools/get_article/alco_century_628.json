A total of 186 C628s were built between December 1963 and December 1968. There were 135 C628s built for US railroads, 46 C628s built for Mexican railroads, and five C628s for Australia.\nThe C628 replaced the C624 (DL600C/RSD-41) as a part of ALCO's 'Century' line of locomotives. The C624 was intended to replace the earlier RSD-15 model, but was never built. The C628 was offered instead in August 1963.\nHamersley Iron purchased five to haul iron ore services in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. They were built in Schenectady. All had been retired by 1982, with one preserved on a plinth in Dampier.\nThe Southern Pacific purchased the four demonstrators in 1964, and an additional 25 C628s were delivered in 1965.\nOriginal Owners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Owner\n!Quantity\n!Road Numbers\n|-\n|ALCO\n(Demonstrators)\n|4\n|628-1 - 628-4\n|-\n|Atlantic Coast Line\n|11\n|2000 - 2010\n|-\n|Chihuahua Pacifico\n(Mexico)\n|4\n|901 - 904\n|-\n|Delaware & Hudson\n|18\n|601 - 618\n|-\n|Ferrocaril del Pacifico\n(Mexico)\n|10\n|601 - 610\n|-\n|Hammersley Iron\n(Australia)\n|5\n|2000 - 2002,\n2004, 2005\n|-\n|Lehigh Valley\n|8\n|625 - 632\n|-\n|Louisville & Nashville\n|15\n|1400 - 1414\n|-\n|Monon\n|9\n|400 - 408\n|-\n|Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México\n(Mexico)\n|32\n|8300 - 8331\n|-\n|Norfolk & Western\n|30\n|1100 - 1129\n|-\n|Pennsylvania Railroad\n|15\n|6300 - 6314\n|-\n|Southern Pacific\n|25\n|4845 - 4869\n|}\nPreserved\nAustralia\n* No. 2000 preserved by the Pilbara Railways Historical Society\nNorth America\n* Nacionales de Mexico 610, formerly Delaware and Hudson 610, preserved at the Yucatán Railway Museum in Mexico\n* Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Mexico 606, formerly Ferrocarril de Pacifico 606, preserved at the Yucatán Railway museum in Mexico\nReferences\n*Alco Century 628 Study by Win Cuisnier (Preston Cook) Extra 2200 South Issue #54 Oct-Dec 1975 p.&nbsp;21.\n*Alco Century (and predecessors) Spec-Profile by Don Dover Extra 2200 South Issue #54 Oct-Dec 1975 p.&nbsp;22\nExternal links\n*Sarberenyi, Robert.
