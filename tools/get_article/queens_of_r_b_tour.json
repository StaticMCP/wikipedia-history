Produced through television personality Mona Scott-Young's multi-media entertainment company Monami Entertainment and Live Nation while represented by Seth Shomes through Day After Day Productions (DADP), the 30-city tour launched June 27 with American singer Mýa and American girl groups 702 and Total featured as special guests.\nBackground\nOriginally in 2023, American girl groups Xscape and SWV had collaborated on a 2023 Bravo series entitled SWV & Xscape: The Queens of R&B which chronicle the female musicians as they attempted to get this tour off the ground. However, internal conflicts and a debate over which group would headline delayed the tour.\nIn March 2024, during Women History Month following a teaser — a hilarious video went viral showing Xscape and SWV in a makeshift therapy session with television personality Mona Scott-Young — on social media that ignited excitement among fans, news of the tour was announced officially on March 25, 2024 on Sherri Shepherd's talk show Sherri.\nTicketing\nPresale & General sale\nTickets for the tour became available starting with a Citi presale on Tuesday, March 26. Additional presales ran throughout the week ahead of the general on sale starting Friday, March 29, at 10:00 AM local time on Ticketmaster.com.\nCritical reception\nJim Harrington writing for The Mercury News praised the concert tour and commented, \"the show turned out to be as great, and maybe even better, than fans could have hoped for, as the two trios mixed and matched songs — and, most wonderfully, occasionally shared vocals — during the course of a thoroughly entertaining co-headlining set that touched on (at least parts of) some 30 songs.\" He concluded his review with, \"Yet, the most memorable moments came when the two vocal crews took the stage together, with six voices joining in glorious harmony to lift up 13,000 fans on The Clark Sisters powerful gospel number \"You Brought the Sunshine (Into My Life),\" the gorgeous Xscape ballad \"The Arms of the One Who Loves You\" and the fun show-closing cover of Lil'Kim's \"Not Tonight (Ladies Night Remix).\"\nSetlist\nThis setlist is representative of the June 27, 2024 show in Concord, California, not the entire duration of the tour.\n;702\n#\"Steelo\"\n#\"Beep Me 911\"\n#\"This Lil' Game We Play\"\n#\"I Still Love You\"\n#\"Get It Together\"\n#\"Where My Girls At?\"\n;Total\n#\"Trippin'\"\n#\"No One Else\"\n#\"Sittin' Home\"\n#\"Kissin' You\"\n#\"What About Us?\"\n#\"What You Want\"\n#\"Can't You See\"\n;Mya\n#\"Case of the Ex\"\n#\"Ghetto Supastar (That Is What You Are)\"\n#\"Best of Me, Part 2\"\n#\"Girls Dem Sugar\"\n#\"Fallen\"\n#\"The Best of Me\" / \"Ridin'\"\n#\"Movin' On\"\n#\"Take Me There\"\n#\"Can We Talk\"\n#\"Lady Marmalade\"\n#\"My Love Is Like...Wo\"\n#\"It's All About Me\"\n;Xscape & SWV\n# \"Can We\"\n# \"Feels So Good\"\n# \"Can't Hang\"\n# \"Keep On, Keepin' On\"\n# \"I'm So Into You\"\n# \"Right Here\"\n# \"Love on My Mind\" / \"What's Up\" / \"Don't Think I'm Not\"\n# \"You're the One\"\n# \"You're Always on My Mind\"\n# \"Use Your Heart\"\n# \"My Little Secret\"\n# \"Hold On\"\n# \"The Arms of the One Who Loves You\"\n# \"Is My Living In Vain\"\n# \"You Brought the Sunshine (Into My Life)\"\n# \"It's About Time\"\n# \"Downtown\"\n# \"Softest Place on Earth\"\n# \"Do You Want To\"\n# \"If Only You Knew\"\n# \"Tonight\"\n# \"Rain\"\n# \"Who Can I Run To\"\n# \"Weak\"\n# \"Anything (Old Skool Mix)\"\n# \"Understanding\"\n# \"Just Kickin' It\"\n# \"Not Tonight (Ladies' Night Remix)\"\nNotes\n}}\nTour dates\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of 2024 concerts\n!
