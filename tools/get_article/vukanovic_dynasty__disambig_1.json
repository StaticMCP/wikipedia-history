Several members of the Vukanović dynasty also ruled in some other regions (Zachlumia, Travunia, Duklja, and also Croatia). The house may have descended from the Vojislavljević dynasty of Duklja. Vukanović dynasty was later succeeded in Serbia by the closely related Nemanjić dynasty.\nThe Vukanović family was named by later historians, after its founder Vukan of Serbia. However, the family itself is also known as the Urošević dynasty (,  Uroševići / Урошевићи), after Vukan's nephew, Uroš I of Serbia.\nThe rulers of this dynasty were split into two branches: the branch in Raška and the branch in Zachumlia. Rulers of the first branch wore the title Grand Prince () of Serbia, while its Zachlumian branch wore the title Duke of Zachlumia. Other titles included Ban of Croatia, held by Beloš of the branch in Raška, Prince of Duklja and Travunia, held by Desa of the same branch, and Count of Split, held by Petar of the Zachlumian branch. Other titles included Duke of Upper Zachlumia, held by Toljen II of the Zachlumian branch, Duke of Southern Zachlumia, held by Andrija of the Zachlumian branch, and Prince of the Littoral, also held by Andrija of the Zachlumian branch.\nAccording to the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, Doclean king Constantine Bodin gained inner Serbia (c. 1083–1084) and assigned two princes from his court, brothers Vukan and Marko, to govern the region of Raška. According to Mavro Orbini, Bodin split Raška into two principalities, assigning one of the principalities to Vukan and the other to Marko.\nRulers\nBranch in Raška\n* Vukan and Marko (1083/84–c. 1112/15)\n* Uroš I (c. 1112/15–1131/c. 1145)\n* Uroš II (c. 1145–1155, 1155–1161/62)\n* Beloš (1142–1158, 1163 (Croatia); 1161/1162 (Raška))\n* Desa (1155, 1161/62–1165 (Raška); 1148–1162 (Duklja))\n* Tihomir (1165–1166)\n* Stefan Nemanja (1166–1196): (thereafter Nemanjić dynasty)\nBranch in Zachlumia\n* Zavida (fl. 1112)\n* Miroslav (Prince of Hum in 1166–1190 and 1192–1198)\n* Toljen (Knez of Hum in 1192–1198)\n* Petar (Prince of Hum in 1198–1216)\n* Andrija (Prince of Hum in 1216–1218 and  1250)\n* Toljen II (Prince of Hum in 1227–1239)\n* Nikola (Prince of Hum in 1239–?)\n* Bogdan (Prince of Hum in 1249–1252)\n* Radoslav (Prince of Hum in  1254)\nSee also\n* Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja\nReferences\nSources\n;Primary sources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n;Secondary sources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://sokol.editboard.com/Vukanovici-h27.htm Sokol Grad: Vukanovići]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080111050148/http://www.geocities.com/miljakovic/uz.htm Srpski vladari: Vukanovići]"
