      "text": "# Peterborough—Kawartha (provincial electoral district)\n\nPeterborough—Kawartha (formerly Peterborough) is a provincial electoral district in Ontario, Canada, that has been represented in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario since 1934.\nIt now consists of the City of Peterborough and the municipalities of Douro-Dummer, Trent Lakes, Havelock-Belmont-Methuen, North Kawartha and Selwyn plus the Curve Lake First Nation. Before 2018, it consisted of the County of Peterborough, excluding the townships of North Kawartha, Galway-Cavendish and Harvey and Cavan-Millbrook-North Monaghan.\nThe riding is considered a bellwether riding as it has voted for the party that has won the most seats in every election since 1977.\nAs part of the 2015 electoral redistribution, the district was renamed Peterborough—Kawartha. It lost the Townships of Otonabee-South Monaghan, Asphodel-Norwood, and the Hiawatha First Nation, while subsequently gaining the townships of Trent Lakes and North Kawartha. The 2018 election is the first with the new boundaries.\nMembers of Provincial Parliament\nPartial election results\n|}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | 2014 general election redistributed results\n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"130px\" colspan=\"2\" | Party\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"50px\" | Vote\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"30px\" | %\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| Liberal ||align=right| 24,413 ||align=right| 45.71\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| Progressive Conservative ||align=right| 16,407 ||align=right| 30.72\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| New Democratic ||align=right| 9,666 ||align=right|18.10\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| Green ||align=right| 2,292 ||align=right| 4.29\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| Others ||align=right| 635 ||align=right| 1.19\n|}\n}}\n2007 electoral reform referendum\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; clear:both\"\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"\n! colspan=4|2007 Ontario electoral reform referendum\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"\n! colspan=2 style=\"width: 130px\"|Side\n! style=\"width: 50px\"|Votes\n! style=\"width: 40px\"|%\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"blue\"|\n|First Past the Post\n|32,372\n|64.5\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"green\"|\n|Mixed member proportional\n|17,834\n|35.5\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"white\"|\n!Total valid votes\n|50,206\n|100.0\n|}\nSources\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071012015710/http://www.elections.on.ca/en-CA/Tools/PastResults.htm Elections Ontario Past Election Results]\n*[https://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/2017/preo/2017atlasmaps/086PeterboroughKawarthaAtlasMap.pdf Map of riding for 2018 election]"
