      "text": "# Timeline of geopolitical changes (2000–present)__disambig_1\n\nThis is a timeline of geopolitical changes around the world since 2000. It includes dates of declarations of independence, changes in country name, changes of capital city or name, and changes in territory such as the annexation, cession, concession, occupation, or secession of land. Territorial conquests as a result of war are included on the timeline at the conclusion of military campaigns. However, those changes in the course of specific battles and day-to-day operations are generally not included in this list. Changes in airspace and maritime territory are included only when they are subject to a dispute.\n2000s\n{|class=wikitable style=\"width:100%; text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=\"width:2em\"|Year||style=\"width:4em\"|Date||Event\n|-\n| rowspan=5|2000 ||20 March||style=text-align:left |Six weeks after the fall of Grozny, the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria is overthrown as a state following its defeat in the Battle of Komsomolskoye; as an insurgency it continues to resist Russian rule in Chechnya for years.\n|-\n|24 May||style=text-align:left |Israel completely withdraws from its occupation zone in southern Lebanon, where it is replaced by United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon peacekeeping forces.\n|-\n|12 June||style=text-align:left |Saudi Arabia and Yemen sign a treaty resolving their border dispute.\n|-\n|17 August||style=text-align:left |Colombia returns its capital city's name from Santa Fe de Bogotá back to Bogotá, Distrito Capital.\n|-\n|5 September||style=text-align:left |Taloqan, the de facto capital of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, falls to the Taliban's Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.
