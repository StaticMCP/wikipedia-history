Locomotives from different manufacturers had varying methods of controlling engines or braking systems. If a train required more than one locomotive, an additional driver was needed, at extra expense.\nSince then, locomotives have been built to work with other locomotives in the same code or system. Similar systems are assigned a coupling code, which is normally indicated on the front of the locomotive.\nEarly diesels were also fitted with communicating doors in the nose which allowed the secondman to access the train heating boiler of the rearmost locomotive. The doors actually saw little use and, as they frequently caused draughts in the cab, many of them were later welded shut.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Coupling code !! System !!

For instance, a Class 127 unit (hydraulic transmission) could be required to work in multiple with a Class 112 unit (mechanical transmission). For this reason, the drive selector on the Class 127 was fitted with positions marked \"D, 3, 2, 1\" to change the gears when working in formation with vehicles with mechanical transmission. However, because of damage to mechanical transmissions caused by improper gear selection on coupled hydraulic units, the Class 127 units had their coupling code changed from Blue Square to Red Triangle, which differed from Blue Square in name only and was unrelated to an earlier Red Triangle code used for the Derby Lightweight hydraulics.\nFirst-generation DMU coupling codes:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Some post-privatisation trains such as the Class 168, 170 and 172s were fitted with BSI couplers enabling them to operate in multiple with older stock, while other incompatible systems emerged. Examples included Dellner-couplers fitted to Class 171, 220, 221, 222, 350, 360, 375, 376, 377, 390, 700 and 710s while Scharfenbergs were fitted to Class 175 and 180s. Franchise changes and stock reallocation means that many train operating companies use fleets with a number of incompatible multiple working systems.\nSee also\n* Multiple-unit train control\n* Multiple unit\nReferences and sources\nReferences\nSources\n*"
