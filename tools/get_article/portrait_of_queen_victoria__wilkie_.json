It depicts the reigning British monarch Queen Victoria around the age of twenty one. It depicts the young sovereign in her robes or state beside the crown.  Known for his genre paintings, Wilkie been Principal Painter in Ordinary under William IV and was reapointed when Victoria succeeded to the throne in 1837.\nThe work was displayed at the Royal Academy Exhibition of 1840 at the National Gallery in  London where it met with widespread criticism. The Prime Minister Lord Melbourne wrote that Wilkie \"never could paint portraits and never will\". Queen Victoria particularly disliked it. The hostile reception to the painting upset Wilkie. That autumn he embarked on a tour of the Middle East, but died on his return voyage near Gibraltar in June 1841. After his death Victoria preferred artists such as George Hayter, Francis Grant and Winterhalter to portray her.\nAs late as 1899 Victoria intervened to stop it being acquired by the National Portrait Gallery.\nHaving at one point hung in the British Embassy in Paris it is today in the Lady Lever Art Gallery in Liverpool, having been acquired in 1906.\nSee also\n* The First Council of Queen Victoria, an 1839 painting by Wilkie showing Queen Victoria's accession to the throne\n* Portrait of Queen Victoria, an 1842 painting by the Irish President of the Royal Academy Martin Archer Shee\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Herrmann, Luke.
