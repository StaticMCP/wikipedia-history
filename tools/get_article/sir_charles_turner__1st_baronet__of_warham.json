He was also admitted to the Middle Temple on 22 July 1684 and became a country attorney like his father.

In April 1689, he married Mary Walpole, daughter of Robert Walpole and sister of Sir Robert Walpole the first Prime Minister.\nTurner helped his father-in-law's election at the 1695 English general election, when he was returned himself as Member of Parliament for King's Lynn with his uncle Sir John Turner. He was knighted on 22 March 1696. With his position unassailable, he was returned unopposed at every general election for the rest of his life. He was appointed a Lord of Trade in 1707 and was then Lord of the Admiralty from 1714 to 1717.\nIn 1720 Turner was appointed Lord of the Treasury. He was created a baronet on 27 April 1727. From 1729 he was a Teller of the Exchequer, retiring as Lord of the Treasury in 1730. He became Father of the House in 1730.\nTurner's first wife Mary died in 1701 and by 1705 he married, secondly, Mary Catelyn, widow of Sir Nevil Catelyn of Kirby Cane and daughter of Sir William Blois of Grundisburgh, Suffolk. He died suddenly on 24 November 1738, at Houghton and was buried at Warham. By his first wife he had a son who predeceased him and four daughters.
