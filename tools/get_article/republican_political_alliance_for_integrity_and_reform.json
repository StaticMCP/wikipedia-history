RePAIR is affiliated with Defending Democracy Together. The group's stated mission is to \"return to principles-based governing in the post-Trump era,\" calling for a change in leadership for the Republican party, and supporting the candidacy of Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election. The group was founded by former Trump administration official Miles Taylor and is led by former members of Republican administrations, including those of Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Trump.\nIn 2021, the A Call for American revival movement, which aims to create a new political party as an alternative for the GOP, was formed of members of RePAIR and Stand Up Republic.\nNotable members\nExecutive branch officials\n* Richard Armitage, former Deputy Secretary of State\n* Stuart M.
