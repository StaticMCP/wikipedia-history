The building that the school currently occupies used to be known as Handsworth Wood Boys' School but it went through a change over ten years ago. The headteacher is Ms Kiran Takhar.\nOriginally known as Handsworth Wood Girls School, in November 2012 the school converted to academy status and was renamed Handsworth Wood Girls' Academy. In September 2018 the school joined the Foundation of the Schools of King Edward VI and was renamed King Edward VI Handsworth Wood Girls' Academy.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.hwgs.org.uk/ King Edward VI Handsworth Wood Girls' Academy official website]\n*[http://www.education.gov.uk/edubase/establishment/summary.xhtml?urn=138937]"
