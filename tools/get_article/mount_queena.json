This unofficially named peak is situated on the Juneau Icefield,  north of Juneau,  west of the Canada–United States border, and  northeast of Mount Blachnitzky, on land managed by Tongass National Forest. Although modest in elevation, relief is significant since the east aspect of the mountain rises over 3,200 feet above the Gilkey Glacier in less than one mile. The nearest higher neighbor is Mount Ogilvie,  to the east.\nClimate\nBased on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Queena has a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and cool summers. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. The months June and July offer the most favorable weather for viewing this rarely climbed peak.\nGallery\nFile:Gilkey Glacier, valley glacier with banded ogives and dark moraines, 1955 (GLACIERS 6160).jpg|Mount Queena centered in the distance, with Mount Blachnitzky on right (1955)\nSee also\n*Geospatial summary of the High Peaks/Summits of the Juneau Icefield\n*Geography of Alaska\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lon=-134.339854&lat=58.862712#.XpDsgm5Fycy National Weather Service Forecast]\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/120725809@N03/13242765655/in/photolist-mbdCRM-ky9FdK Flickr photo]"
