This timeline documents all the storm formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, as well as dissipation. The season officially began on 1 November 2007, and lasted until 30 April 2008. However a tropical cyclone moving into the region from the South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season on 29 July, meant that the season started 29 days after the Southern Hemisphere tropical cyclone year started on 1 July 2007. The timeline includes information which was not operationally released, meaning that information from post-storm reviews by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, such as information about a Cyclone that was not upgraded operationally, has been included.\n__TOC__\nTimeline of storms\nPre season\n;1 July\n:0000 UTC&nbsp;– The 2007–08 Tropical Cyclone year begins.\n;29 July\n:1800 UTC&nbsp;–
