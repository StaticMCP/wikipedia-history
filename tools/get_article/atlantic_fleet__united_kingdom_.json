It existed for two periods; 1909 until 1914, and then 1919 until 1932.\nHistory\nOn 14 December 1904 the Channel Fleet was re-styled the 'Atlantic Fleet'. The Atlantic Fleet lasted until 1912 when rising tensions with Germany forced the Royal Navy to relook at fleet formations and the Atlantic Fleet became the 3rd Battle Squadron. The Atlantic Fleet was based at Gibraltar to reinforce either the Channel Fleet or the Mediterranean Fleet, from January 1905 to February 1907. It remained at Gibraltar until April 1912.\nThe Atlantic Fleet was again formed after the end of World War I, when British naval forces were reorganised to reflect the changed economic and political situation in Europe. The fleet was created upon the disbandment of the Grand Fleet in April 1919, absorbing many, but not all of its elements. It was placed under a Commander-in-Chief, who for part of that year held the title of Commander-in-Chief Atlantic and Home Fleets, before the Home Fleet became the Reserve Fleet and a totally separate command.  became the Fleet's flagship and served in that capacity until 1924.\nThe fleet never fought in a naval battle in its short history. In 1931, during the Invergordon Mutiny, sailors of the fleet openly refused to obey orders because of a dispute over pay with the government. The fleet's short history ended in 1932, when the Admiralty having been shaken by the events of the Invergordon Mutiny, renamed the fleet, as the Home Fleet.\nSenior officers\nCommanders-in-Chief Atlantic Fleet\nThe Commander-in-Chief's title was \"Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet\" between 1904 and 1910, and \"Vice-Admiral Commanding, Atlantic Fleet\" from 1910 to 1912.\n| date =\n| parent =\n| subordinate =\n* 8-9 Battleships not assigned to a squadron\n* 2nd Cruiser Squadron\n* Atlantic Fleet Flotilla\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+Commander-in-Chief Atlantic Fleet (first formation)\n|+\n! !!
