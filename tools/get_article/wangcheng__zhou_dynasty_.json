It was constructed in 1021BC on the model of the earlier and larger Chengzhou  to its east. It was the primary capital of the Eastern Zhou dynasty between 771 and 510BC.\nThe Eastern Han dynasty also chose the location in AD25 as the site of its capital Luoyang, which was built over the earlier Zhou city. The ruins of Wangcheng have been partially excavated and are visible in modern Luoyang's Wangcheng Park.\nReferences"
