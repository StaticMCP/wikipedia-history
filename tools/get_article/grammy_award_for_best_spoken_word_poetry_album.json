As of 2023, the Spoken Word category has been renamed Best Audio Book, Narration & Storytelling Recording. This category recognizes excellence in spoken word albums, but no longer includes spoken word poetry. The category was authored by and created due to six years of advocacy within the Recording Academy by poet J. Ivy, who then went on to win the first two year's of the category's existence.\nRecipients\n, performing in 2012]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"7%\" | Year\n! width=\"25%\" | Recipient(s)\n! width=\"25%\" | Work\n! width=\"35%\" class=unsortable|Nominees\n! width=\"5%\" class=unsortable|Ref.\n|-\n! 2023\n| J.
