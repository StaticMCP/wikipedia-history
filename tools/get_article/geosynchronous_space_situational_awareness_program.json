They were built by Orbital Sciences Corporation; their capabilities and development and construction budgets are classified. They operate in \"near-geosynchronous orbit\", The first launch was scheduled for 23 July 2014 aboard a United Launch Alliance Delta IV launch vehicle. Even during the testing process these satellites were pressed into early service to fulfill critical needs. In August 2023 the Space Systems Command announced the retirement of the GSSAP-2 satellite, the first of the constellation to be decommissioned, and its subsequent transfer into a graveyard orbit.\nAFSPC-6 (GSSAP-3 & 4)\nGSSAP 3 (USA-270) and 4 (USA-271) satellites were launched on 19 August 2016. On 12 September 2017, both were declared operational. USA-270 approached two Chinese satellites in GEO to examine them more closely. In 2023, Chinese researchers reported having observed 13 other instances where US satellites approached Chinese ones.\nUSSF-8 (GSSAP-5 & 6)\nAV-084 lifts off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, 21 January 2022 with GSSAP-5 and GSSAP-6.]]Two more satellites (GSSAP-5 and GSSAP-6) have been successfully launched on 21 January 2022 by a Atlas V launch vehicle.\nUSSF-87 (GSSAP-7 & 8) and future\nIn August 2023 the Space Systems Command revealed that two more satellites have been ordered to Northrop Grumman to keep up with the demand for GSSAP assets. The launches of the new satellites were planned for 2024 and 2027 respectively, with the spacecraft being the first of the constellation not to be launched in pairs.\nGSSAP 7 and 8 are scheduled to be launched together in 2025 by a Vulcan Centaur VC4S. GSSAP 9 and 10 will follow in 2027.\nReactions\nThe GSSAP satellites have a limit to the amount of maneuvering they can undertake, due to fuel supply limitations. In 2023 Aviation Week  reported that Northrop Grumman had a contract to install hydrazine refueling valves in future satellites, to enable on-orbit refueling.\nChinese astronomers track GSSAP satellite movements, enabling the prediction of their observations. Chinese satellites have been observed changing orbital trajectories to observe GSSAP satellites or to make observation by GSSAP satellites more difficult.\nSatellites\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Name\n!NSSDC ID\n!Launch date\n!Launcher\n|-\n|GSSAP 1, Hornet 1, USA 253\n|2022-174A\n| rowspan=\"2\" |23 July 2014\n23:28\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Delta IV 368\n|-\n|GSSAP 2, Hornet 2, USA 254\n|2022-174B\n|-\n|GSSAP 3, Hornet 3, USA 270\n|2016-052A\n| rowspan=\"2\" |19 August 2016\n04:52\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Delta IV 375\n|-\n|GSSAP 4, Hornet 4, USA 271\n|2016-052B\n|-\n|GSSAP 5, Hornet 5, USA 324\n|2022-006A\n| rowspan=\"2\" |21 January 2022\n19:00\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Atlas V AV-084\n|-\n|GSSAP 6, Hornet 6, USA 325\n|2022-006B\n|-\n|GSSAP 7, Hornet 7, USSF 87\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2025\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Vulcan Centaur VC4S\n|-\n|GSSAP 8, Hornet 8, USSF 87\n|\n|-\n|GSSAP 9, Hornet 9\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2027\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|GSSAP 10, Hornet 10\n|\n|}\nSee also\n*Combined Force Space Component Command\nReferences"
