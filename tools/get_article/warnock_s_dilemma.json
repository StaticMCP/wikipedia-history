The term originally referred to mailing list discussions, but has been applied to Usenet posts, blogs, web forums, and online content in general. The dilemma arises because a lack of response does not necessarily imply that no one is interested in the topic, but could also mean for example that readers find the content to be exceptionally good (leaving nothing for commenters to add).\nOn many internet forums, only around one percent of users create new posts, while nine percent reply and 90 percent are lurkers that do not contribute to the discussion. When no users reply, the original poster has no way of knowing what lurkers think of their contribution.\nWarnock's dilemma leads to online writers and publishers adopting more provocative writing strategies in order to ensure that they will get a response. However, this can also lead publishers to avoid producing the kind of content that might fail to generate comments due to its high quality. This problem arises particularly with sites that focus on viral content, such as BuzzFeed and Huffington Post.\nOriginal description\n– Original description of the dilemma}}\nSince Warnock's original description of the dilemma in August 2000, the expression has become used in the Perl world.\nSee also\n* Comments section\n* Like button\nNotes\nSources\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/15407 Warnock's later explanations]\n* [https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.10/mustread.html?pg=7 Mention in Wired Jargon Watch]"
