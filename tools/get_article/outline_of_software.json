It is held in various forms of memory of the computer. It comprises procedures, algorithms, and documentation concerned with the operation of a data processing system. The term was coined to contrast to the term hardware, meaning physical devices. In contrast to hardware, software \"cannot be touched\". Software is also sometimes used in a more narrow sense, meaning application software only. Sometimes the term includes data that has not traditionally been associated with computers, such as film, tapes, and records.\nTypes\n* Application software – end-user applications of computers such as word processors or video games, and ERP software for groups of users.\n** Business software\n** Computer-aided design\n** Databases\n** Decision-making software\n** Educational software\n** Emotion-sensitive software\n** Image editing\n** Industrial automation\n** Mathematical software\n** Medical software\n** Molecular modeling software\n** Quantum chemistry and solid state physics software\n** Simulation software\n** Spreadsheets\n** Telecommunications (i.e., the Internet and everything that flows on it)\n** Video editing software\n** Video games\n** Word processors\n* Middleware controls and co-ordinates distributed systems.\n* Programming languages – define the syntax and semantics of computer programs. For example, many mature banking applications were written in the language COBOL, invented in 1959. Newer applications are often written in more modern languages.\n* System software – provides the basic functions for computer usage and helps run the computer hardware and system. It includes a combination of the following:\n** Device driver\n** Operating system\n** Package management system\n** Server\n** Utility\n** Window system\n* Teachware – any special breed of software or other means of product dedicated to education purposes in software engineering and beyond in general education.\n* Testware – any software for testing hardware or software.\n* Firmware – low-level software often stored on electrically programmable memory devices. Firmware is given its name because it is treated like hardware and run (\"executed\") by other software programs. Firmware often is not accessible for change by other entities but the developers' enterprises.\n* Shrinkware is the older name given to consumer-purchased software, because it was often sold in retail stores in a shrink wrapped box.\n* Device drivers – control parts of computers such as disk drives, printers, CD drives, or computer monitors.\n* Programming tools – assist in writing computer programs, and software using various programming languages in a more convenient way. The tools include:\n** Compilers\n** Debuggers\n** Interpreters\n** Linkers\n** Text editors\n**Profilers\n** Integrated development environments (IDE) – single application for managing all of these functions.\nProducts\nBy publisher\n*List of Adobe software\n*List of Microsoft software\nBy platform\n*List of Macintosh software\n*List of old Macintosh software\n*List of Linux audio

development life cycle of a software product. It encompasses a planned and structured process from the conception of the desired software to its final manifestation, which constitutes computer programming, the process of writing and maintaining the source code. Software development includes research, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities that result in software products.\nSoftware engineering\n* Software engineering &nbsp;(outline) –\nComputer programming\n* Computer programming &nbsp;(outline) –\nDistribution\nSoftware distribution –\n* Software licenses\n**Beerware\n**Free\n**Free and open source software\n**Freely redistributable software\n**Open-source software\n**Proprietary software\n**Public domain software\n* Revenue models\n** Adware\n** Donationware\n** Freemium\n** Freeware\n** Commercial software\n** Nagware\n** Postcardware\n** Shareware\n* Delivery methods\n** Digital distribution\n*** List of mobile software distribution platforms\n** On-premises software\n** Pre-installed software\n** Product bundling\n** Software as a service\n** Software plus services\n* Scams\n** Scareware\n** Malware\n* End of software life cycle\n** Abandonware\nIndustry\n* Software industry\nPublications\n* Free Software Magazine\n* InfoWorld\n* PC Magazine\n* Software Magazine\n* Wired (magazine)\nInfluential people\n* Bill Gates\n* Steve Jobs\n* Linus Torvalds\n* Jonathan Sachs\n* Wayne Ratliff\nSee also\n* Outline of information technology\n** Outline of computers\n** Outline of computing\n** Outline of computer programming\n*Outline of free software\n* List of computer term etymologies\n* Bachelor of Science in Information Technology\n* Custom software\n* Functional specification\n* Product marketing\n* Service-oriented modeling Framework\n* Bus factor\n* Capability Maturity Model\n* Software publisher\n* User experience\nReferences\nExternal links"
