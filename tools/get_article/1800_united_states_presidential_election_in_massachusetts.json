Voters chose 16 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nDuring this election, Federalists John Adams and his running mate Charles Cotesworth Pinckney were the only two candidates on the ballot in Massachusetts. As both represented the Federalist Party there was no popular vote. While Adams won all 16 Massachusetts state electors in his home state, it was not enough to win the general election. The Democratic-Republican Party candidate, Vice President Thomas Jefferson, defeated Adams.\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Massachusetts\n* Massachusetts's congressional districts\nReferences"
