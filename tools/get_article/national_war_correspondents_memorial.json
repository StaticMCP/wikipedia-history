It is located at Crampton's Gap at South Mountain, near Burkittsville, Maryland, in the United States.\nCivil War correspondent George Alfred Townsend, or \"Gath\", built the arch in 1896, and it was dedicated October 16, 1896.\nIt is claimed that the arch is the only monument in the world dedicated to journalists killed in combat. However, a tree in Arlington National Cemetery was also dedicated as a war correspondents' memorial in 1986.''[https://archive.org/details/journalistsatris00sull/page/9  Journalists At Risk: Reporting America's Wars],  p. 9, George Sullivan, Twentieth Century Books, 2005 . In addition, there are at least two prominent US monuments more broadly commemorating journalists killed in combat or otherwise in the line of duty – the Overseas Press Club Memorial Press Center building in New York City which was dedicated in 1954 [https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=10153]; and the Freedom Forum Journalists Memorial in Freedom Park, Arlington, Virginia, dedicated in 1996 [http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itdhr/0297/ijde/memorial.htm]. The Journalists Memorial monument with a similar broad dedication and purportedly the first of its kind in Europe, was inaugurated by Reporters Without Borders in Bayeux, France in 2006 [http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=17943]\nDescription\nThe book George Alfred Townsend'' describes the monument:\nIn appearance the monument is quite odd. It is fifty feet high and forty feet broad. Above a Moorish arch sixteen feet high built of Hummelstown purple stone are super-imposed three Roman arches. These are flanked on one side with a square crenellated tower, producing a bizarre and picturesque effect. Niches in different places shelter the carving of two horses' heads, and symbolic terra cotta statuettes of Mercury, Electricity and Poetry. Tables under the horses' heads bear the suggestive words \"Speed\" and \"Heed\"; the heads are over the Roman arches. The three Roman arches are made of limestone from Creek Battlefield, Virginia, and each is nine feet high and six feet wide. These arches represent Description, Depiction and Photography.\nThe aforementioned tower contains a statue of the Greek god Hermes (Roman god Mercury), the messenger of the gods, identifiable by the winged cap on his head. with the traditional pipes, and he is either half drawing or sheathing a Roman sword. Over a small turret on the opposite side of the tower is a gold vane of a pen bending a sword. At various places on the monument are quotations appropriate to the art of war correspondence. These are from a great variety of sources beginning with Old Testament verses. Perhaps the most striking feature of all are the tablets inscribed with the names of 157 correspondents and war artists who saw and described in narrative and picture almost all the events of the tour years of the war.\nThis account errs in that \"Speed\" and \"Heed\" appear under the heads of Electricity and Poetry, and the \"statue of Pan\" is actually a zinc copy of Bertel Thorvaldsen's Mercury About to Kill Argos created by the J.W. Fiske Company.\nThe monument's text:\nSPEED – HEED\nSept. 14 – 62 – 96\nTo the Army Correspondents\nand\nArtists 1861–65\nWhose toils cheered the fireside\nEducated provinces of rustics into\na bright nation of readers\nand gave incentive to narrate\ndistant wars and explore dark lands.\nErected by subscriptions\n1896\nAnd on its north side:\nO wondrous youth\nThrough this grand ruth\nRuns my boy's life, its thread\nThe General's fame, the battle's name\nThe rolls of maimed and dead\nI bear with my thrilled soul astir\nAnd lonely thoughts and fears\nAnd am but history's courier\nTo bind the conquering years\nA battle's ray, through ages gray\nTo light the deeds sublime\nAnd flash the lustre of my day\nDown all the aisles of time\nWar Correspondent Ballad – 1865\nAlthough Townsend retained ownership of the property until his death in 1914, maintenance of the monument itself was entrusted to the National Park Service – previously to the War Department – in 1904.\nThe monument's plaques lists 157 names which are sometimes assumed to be all war correspondents. In the late 1990s, local historian Timothy J. Reese analyzed the list and asserted that only 135 can claim to be war correspondents or artists, and 33 of those are not identifiable in the historical record. Furthermore, many names are misstated and several important names are missing.\nAdditions\nUnchanged for over a century, the arch had four names added in 2003: David Bloom, Michael Kelly, Elizabeth Neuffer, and Daniel Pearl.\nReferences"
