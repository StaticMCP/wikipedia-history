GYP processes a file that contains a JSON dictionary in order to generate one or more target project make files. The single source .GYP file is generic while the target files are specific to each targeted build tool.\nIn 2016, the Chromium project replaced GYP with GN, a tool that generates ninja builds. The switch to GN resulted in a 20x speedup for their use case. Other projects that migrated from GYP to GN include the V8 Javascript engine, WebRTC and Dart.\nSoftware projects that are still built using GYP include Node.js and Telegram.\nSee also\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
