It had under command the 2/1st Royal 1st Devon Yeomanry, the 2/1st Royal North Devon Yeomanry, and the 2/1st West Somerset Yeomanry. All of which were converted in cyclist units in 1916 or 1917 and the brigade, never having seen any active service, ceased to exist.\nSee also\n* 2nd South Western Mounted Brigade for the 1st Line formation\n* British yeomanry during the First World War\n* Second line yeomanry regiments of the British Army\nReferences"
