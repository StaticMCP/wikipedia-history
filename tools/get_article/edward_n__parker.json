He then served as the first Assistant Director of the Weapons Evaluation and Control Bureau in the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency from January 1962 to November 1962, where he was responsible for organizing and initiating Project Cloud Gap, which tested  the feasibility of arms control and disarmament measures.\nEarly life\nEdward Nelson Parker was born in Avalon, Pennsylvania, on 26 July 1904. He was educated at schools in  New Orleans, Louisiana, and Louisville, Kentucky, and entered the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, in 1921. He graduated with the class of 1925, and was commissioned as an ensign. He was nicknamed \"Butch\".\nWorld War II\nAt time of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor that brought the United States into World War II, Parker, was a lieutenant commander, and the skipper of the destroyer , which was part of the Asiatic Fleet. He was awarded the Navy Cross for his part in the Battle of Balikpapan. His citation read:, and for extreme disregard of personal safety, devotion to duty, courage, leadership and alertness in successfully delivering a determined attack with torpedoes and gunfire during action with the enemy. On the night of 24–25 January 1942, the Parrot, together with the  and , delivered an attack upon enemy surface ships off Balikpapan, Borneo, Netherlands East Indies. The composition of the enemy's concentration was known to consist of cruisers, destroyers, and various types of transports and cargo ships. Although sorely outnumbered, the element of surprise was used to compensate for the numerical inequality of forces. By utter disregard of enemy challenges and skillful and precision-like maneuvering, the attacking force was able to so confuse the enemy as to gain admittance to his concentration, sinking and considerably damaging a great part of it by repeated torpedo and gunfire attacks. After remaining in close contact with the enemy for over an hour, and after having expended all torpedoes, an orderly retirement was effected. Lieutenant Commander Parker's skillful handling of the USS Parrott and the manifestly high morale and state of training of his command reflect most favorably on his ability as a commanding Officer and his qualities as a leader. His actions were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.}}\nThe following month he earned a second Navy Cross in the Battle of Badung Strait. His citation read:\nA week later he earned the Silver Star in the Battle of the Java Sea. His citation read:\nIn November, Parker earned a third Navy Cross in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. His citation read:, during an engagement with Japanese naval forces near Savo Island on the night of 12–13 November 1942. The force to which he was attached engaged at close quarters and defeated a superior enemy force. Commander Parker's daring and determination contributed materially to the victory which prevented the enemy from accomplishing his purposes. Lieutenant Commander Parker's inspiring leadership and the valiant devotion to duty of his command contributed in large measure to the outstanding success of these vital missions and reflect great credit upon the United States Naval Service.}}\nThis was followed in February 1943 by duty ashore in the Bureau of Ordnance in Washington, D.C., as the head of the Ship Characteristics and Fleet Requirement Section, and then as head of the Planning Engineering Section. He was Assistant Director of the Research and Development Division from February to July 1945, for which he was awarded a Commendation Ribbon.\nPost-war\nAfter the war ended, Parker returned to sea duty in the Pacific in November 1945, leading a destroyer squadron in the Allied occupation of Korea and North China until April 1946.

He responsible for organizing and initiating Project Cloud Gap, which tested  the feasibility of arms control and disarmament measures. He was awarded the Legion of Merit and the Navy Distinguished Service Medal for this service.
