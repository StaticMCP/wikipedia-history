The division was formed on March 6, 1915, and organized over the next two months. It was part of a wave of new infantry divisions formed in the spring of 1915 and was originally formed from troops from the Kingdom of Saxony and the Kingdom of Württemberg, but became a fully Saxon division by 1916.  The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I.\nCombat chronicle\nThe 58th Infantry Division initially fought on the Western Front, seeing action in the Second Battle of Artois.  In July 1915, it was transferred to the Eastern Front, and participated in the Gorlice-Tarnów Offensive.  In October 1915, it returned to the Western Front and went into the trenchlines in Lorraine.  In 1916, it fought in the Battle of Verdun and the Battle of the Somme.  In 1917, it fought in the Second Battle of the Aisne, also called the Third Battle of Champagne.  In late April 1917, the division went back to the Eastern Front, where it remained until October.  After returning to the Western Front, it saw action in the late phases of the Battle of Passchendaele, also called the Third Battle of Ypres.  The division remained in the Flanders region until August 1918, when it went to the Somme region, fighting at Monchy-Bapaume and later resisting the Allied offensive between Cambrai and St. Quentin.  Allied intelligence rated the division as second class.\nOrder of battle on formation\nThe  58th Infantry Division was formed as a triangular division.
