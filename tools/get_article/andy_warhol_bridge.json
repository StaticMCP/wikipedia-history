It is the only bridge in the United States named for a visual artist.  It was opened at a cost of $1.5 million on June 17, 1926, in a ceremony attended by 2,000.[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LkMqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=GkoEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6383%2C7041791 The Pittsburgh Press – Google News Archive Search]\nHistory and architectural features\nNamed for the artist Andy Warhol, a Pittsburgh native, this structure is one of three parallel bridges called The Three Sisters, the others being the Roberto Clemente Bridge and the Rachel Carson Bridge. The Three Sisters are self-anchored suspension bridges and are historically significant because they are the only trio of nearly identical bridges — as well as the first self-anchored suspension spans — built in the United States.\nThe bridge was renamed for Warhol on March 18, 2005, as part of the tenth-anniversary celebration for the Andy Warhol Museum. The museum is nearby at 117 Sandusky Street, a street which leads to the bridge from the north side of the river on Pittsburgh's North Shore.\nOn August 11, 2013, the Andy Warhol Bridge was covered with 580 knitted and crocheted panels in a yarn bombing project known as Knit the Bridge that lasted for four weeks.\nThis is the third bridge on the site, the first having been demolished in early 1884. Construction of its replacement began in 1884, opening to traffic in 1887.\nGallery\nImage:Andy Warhol Bridge - 2.jpg|Western side of the bridge\nImage:Andy Warhol Bridge - 3.jpg|Facing north on the bridge\nImage:AndyWarholBridgePittsburghBanner.JPG|Banner for the bridge's namesake, Andy Warhol\nImage:PGH knit the brdge.jpg|\"Knit the Bridge\" yarn bombing event on the bridge in August 2013\nImage:Andy Warhol Bridge - 4.jpg|Historic plaque for Seventh Street Bridge\nFile:Duquesne Wharf ca. 1912 Pittsburgh.jpg|Duquesne Wharf, circa 1912, showing the second Seventh Street Bridge\nSee also\n*List of bridges documented by the Historic American Engineering Record in Pennsylvania\n*List of crossings of the Allegheny River\nReferences\n*Pohla Smith (2005).
