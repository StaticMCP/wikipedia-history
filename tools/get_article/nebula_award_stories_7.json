Schuyler Miller in Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact, called the book \"one of the best\" of the SFWA annual anthologies, \"not only for good stories (which have been surpassed before), but for the 'bonus' chapters,\" the essays by Knight, Anderson and Sturgeon, which \"make the book outstanding.\"  He highlights the Anderson and MacLean stories as \"a pair of blockbusters,\" as well as calling attention to Silverberg's contribution. He notes that \"[m]ore of the others stories are fantasies and [genre] borderliners than is usual with these anthologies,\" describing their content in brief before turning to the Pangborn, Dozois and Buck pieces, with which he seems more taken.\nNotes"
