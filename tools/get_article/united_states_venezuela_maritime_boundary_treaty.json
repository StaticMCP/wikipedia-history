The boundary set out by the text of the treaty is  long and consists of 21 maritime straight-line segments defined by 22 individual coordinate points. Two-thirds of the boundary is an equidistant line between the U.S. Virgin Islands and Aves Island. The far eastern point of the boundary is a tripoint with the Netherlands Antilles and the far western point is a quadripoint with the Netherlands Antilles and the Dominican Republic.\nThe treaty came into force on 24 November 1980 after it had been ratified by both states. The full name of the treaty is Maritime boundary Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Venezuela ().\nSee also\n*Borders of Venezuela\n*Netherlands–Venezuela Boundary Treaty\n*United States–Venezuela relations\nNotes\nReferences\n* Anderson, Ewan W.
