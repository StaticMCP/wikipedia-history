Six by-elections were held in this period, all retained by the holding party.\nThe European Parliamentary Elections Act 1999 established a new system of  multi-member constituencies elected by a closed party list system based on the regions of England, plus Scotland and Wales. The single transferable vote system was retained in Northern Ireland. Because of the new system, retiring MEPs would be replaced by a different person from the list, so no further by-elections were held.\nSummary\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!By-election !! Date !!
