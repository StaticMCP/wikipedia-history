It was founded in 1979 by Ike Schambelan(who died of cancer in 2015), with sighted actors recording plays for the blind.  The theater then moved to performances for the blind and then blind performances for the sighted. They recently began doing a short play festival each year.\nCrystal Clear\nCrystal Clear by Phil Young opened in 1986 at the Long Wharf Theater's Stage II.  The show starred (George Ashiotis) who played a young actor who is gradually going blind from diabetes and his girlfriend who has been blind from birth (Lucia Puccia) .  Crystal Clear began as an improvisation on a London pub stage in 1982.\nThe production had mixed reviews from critics. Mel Gusso said for The New York Times, \"It is diagnostic rather than psychologically probing.\"  Another critic said the play was \"a wildly unfocused work that tries to cover too vast a terrain\" and that it contained \"a cornucopia of cliches\".\nA Midsummer Night's Dream\n''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' by William Shakespeare staged at the Barrow Group Theater in Manhattan, was the first play by TBTB to feature a character in a wheelchair:\nA note in the theater program said, \"Increasingly we feel we must include all disabled people [rather than blind people only] in our work.\" To reflect this shift in thought and philosophy, 2008 saw the company changing its name from Theater By The Blind to Theater Breaking Through Barriers. Productions, such as Romeo & Juliet, closely followed featuring an actor, Gregg Mozgala,  with Cerebral Palsy, their first in a subsequent line of productions incorporating actors with various disabilities. In 2020 as a result of the pandemic they presented playwriting intensives and performances via Zoom with captions and audio descriptions.\nNotes\nExternal links\n*"
