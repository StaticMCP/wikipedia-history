The ceremony was hosted by broadcaster Fred Davis.\nIn addition to being the year of Canada's 100th birthday celebrations, 1967 was the year that the Canadian Film Development Corporation was created. The corporation, later named Telefilm Canada, became the administrative body of a new $10 million fund established to assist Canadian feature film production.\nThis year also saw the beginning of a thorough reorganization of the CFAs. Recognizing that the current structure was not fulfilling the needs of the industry, the CFA joined with other organizations to form the Council of Canadian Film Organizations; its mandate was to explore the feasibility of establishing a Canadian Film Academy. In the interim, the 19th awards competition, which received 78 entries, was modified, with some categories dropped and others consolidated.\nWinners\nFilms\n*Film of the Year: Warrendale — Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Allan King producer and director\n*Feature Film: Warrendale — Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Allan King producer and director\n*Arts and Experimental: Angel — National Film Board of Canada, Guy Glover producer, Derek May director\n*Television Film: Land of the Loon — Dan Gibson Productions, Dan Gibson producer and director, tied with\n::Wojeck: The Last Man in the World — Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, David Peddie producer, Ron Kelly director\n*Films for Children: Dimensions — National Film Board of Canada, Jacques Bobet producer, Bernard Longpré director\n*Travel and Recreation: Adventure: Trent Severn Style — Dan Gibson Productions, Dan Gibson producer and director, tied with\n::The Entertainers — Crawley Films, F.
