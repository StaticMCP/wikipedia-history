It is one of the most academically successful schools in the United Kingdom, currently ranked 11th among state schools. It is one of fourteen schools in Birmingham that are part of the King Edward VI Foundation. It shares a campus with King Edward VI Camp Hill School for Boys and, in 1958, both schools moved from their original location in central Birmingham to Vicarage Road in the Birmingham suburb of Kings Heath. The buildings are connected and some facilities, activities and A-level subjects are shared, but they are separate establishments. The name has been retained from the school's former site at Camp Hill.\nAdmission\nAdmission to Camp Hill is based upon success in the 11+ exam along with consideration of proximity to the school. It is also guaranteed that at least 25% of students admitted will be \"Pupil Premium Pupils\", who are pupils whose families will have received free school meals at some point in the six years before application. Those living outside the catchment are able to attend Camp Hill, but only if they achieve a very high score in the 11+, and the quota for catchment pupils is not filled. This admissions policy replaced the previous one from 2020. Previously, there was no weight attached to proximity, and the quota for Pupil Premium Pupils was 20%.\nEntry in year 8 to 11 is also through examination only.\nAdmissions controversy 2020\nFor the academic year starting in 2020, changes were made to admissions criteria by The Schools of King Edward VI in Birmingham, the body which oversees the running of Camp Hill and the other King Edward schools in Birmingham. These changes were praised by some but were largely controversial, with only 27% of those consulted supporting the plans. The changes increased admissions of Pupil Premium students to 25%, and also largely restricted admissions to the wards immediately surrounding Camp Hill, by means of catchment areas. Previously, applications were open to any UK citizen. In public consultation, many concerns were raised about the catchment areas, including that they may be designed to increase applications to the private schools of KES, overseen by the same body. These concerns were brushed aside by the Schools of King Edward VI, which explained them as affluent parents outside Birmingham being disappointed at their loss of entitlement to a grammar school place. The BBC and others published articles on the changes, but all largely ignored the concerns about the catchment area, focussing instead on the issue of increased admission of deprived pupils, and the perceived class struggle. In a Freedom of Information request to The King Edward Schools, release of the consultation responses, and information regarding reasons for the catchment plans, was refused. A complaint regarding conflicts of interest and concerns raised in the consultation was also brushed aside.\nCurriculum\nAll National Curriculum subjects are studied, and the curriculum is enhanced to provide creative opportunities in drama and dance and support for all aspects of personal development in PSHE. From early on, the sciences are taught separately to support the large number of pupils who choose biology, chemistry and physics as A level options. Teaching groups are of the same age and, generally, of mixed ability. As in all secondary schools, pupils sit most of their GCSE examinations in Year 11, although more flexible pathways enable early entry in some disciplines, for example mathematics. Pupils take eleven GCSEs, and four A-levels from Year 12, but can choose to drop one in Year 13.\nEducation at the school has been enhanced by its specialisms in mathematics, computing and languages. In addition, success in a variety of fields has been recognised through a number of other awards including a Gold Award for celebrating Cultural Diversity, a Gold Artsmark for the range of arts activities supported by the School, the International Schools Award, a Healthy Schools Award and a Basic 21 Award for encouraging sustainability.\nHouses\nThe house system at Camp Hill allows girls to participate in a range of sporting, cultural and charitable activities, and house points form part of the rewards system. The six house names - Cartland, Lichfield, Meriden, Priory, Stratford and Warwick - are related to the school's history. There are various house events throughout the year such has a house festival, house fair and seasonal house sports competitions. At the end of each academic year, the House Cup is awarded to the house with the most points.\nKECHG Houses\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! House !!
