Bill Clinton in 1992 is the solitary Democratic presidential nominee to carry Warren County since Stephen Douglas in 1860, and Clinton only won with 37.1 percent of the vote.\nLike most rural and exurban areas throughout Northeast Missouri, voters in Warren County generally adhere to socially and culturally conservative principles which tend to influence their Republican leanings. The initiative narrowly passed the state with 51 percent of support from voters as Missouri became one of the first states in the nation to approve embryonic stem cell research. Despite Warren County's longstanding tradition of supporting socially conservative platforms, voters in the county have a penchant for advancing populist causes like increasing the minimum wage. In 2006, Missourians voted on a proposition (Proposition B) to increase the minimum wage in the state to $6.50 an hour—it passed Warren County with 77.48 percent of the vote. The proposition strongly passed every single county in Missouri with 78.99 percent voting in favor. (During the same election, voters in five other states also strongly approved increases in the minimum wage.)\nMissouri presidential preference primary (2008)\nFormer U.S. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-New York) received more votes, a total of 1,971, than any candidate from either party in Warren County during the 2008 presidential primary.\nEducation\nSchool districts in the county include:\n* Gasconade County R-I School District\n* Montgomery County R-II School District\n* Troy R-III School District\n* Warren County R-III School District\n* Washington School District\n* Wright City R-II School District of Warren County\nPublic schools\n*Warren County R-III School District - Warrenton\n**Daniel Boone Elementary School (PK-05)\n**Warrior Ridge Elementary School (K-05)\n**Rebecca Boone Elementary School (K-05)\n**Black Hawk Middle School (06-08)\n**Warrenton High School (09-12)\n*Wright City R-II School District - Wright City\n**Wright City East Elementary School (K-01) - Foristell\n**Wright City Elementary School (02-05)\n**Wright City Middle School (06-08)\n**Wright City High School (09-12)\nPrivate schools\n*Holy Rosary School – Warrenton (K-08) – Roman Catholic\n*St. Vincent De Paul School – Marthasville (K-08) – Roman Catholic\n*St. Ignatius Loyola School – Marthasville (PK-08) – Roman Catholic\nPublic libraries\n*Warrenton Branch Library, Scenic Regional Library\nCommunities\nCities\n*Foristell (Partly in St. Charles County)\n*Marthasville\n*Truesdale\n*Warrenton (county seat)\n*Wright City\nVillages\n*Innsbrook\n*Pendleton\n*Three Creeks\nUnincorporated communities\n* Bernheimer\n* Bridgeport\n* Case\n* Concord Hill\n* Dutzow\n* Gore\n* Holstein\n* Hopewell\n* Lippstadt\n* Macedonia Neighborhood\n* New Truxton\n* Peers\n* Pin Oak\n* Pinckney\n* Treloar\nMedia\n*KFAV, 99.9 mHz FM station featuring country music, sister station to KWRE\n*KWRE, 730&nbsp;kHz AM station featuring country music, sister station to KFAV\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Warren County, Missouri\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://warrencountymo.org/ Official site]\n* [http://mulibraries.missouri.edu/specialcollections/platbooks.htm Digitized 1930 Plat Book of Warren County]  from University of Missouri Division of Special Collections, Archives, and Rare Books"
