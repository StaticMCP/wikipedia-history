It was born to pursue an agreement with the Christian Democracy, by moving from the neo-fascist ideology of the Italian Social Movement to a post-fascist moderate ideology.\nThe movement became a fully fledged party in February 1977 and ceased to exist in December 1979 after the very poor result of the 1979 election (0.6%).\nLeadership\n* Secretary: Ernesto De Marzio (1976–1978), Raffaele Delfino (1978–1979), Pietro Cerullo (1979)\n* President:  Alfredo Covelli (1977–1979)\nElectoral results\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!
