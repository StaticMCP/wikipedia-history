Established in 1971, the center sits on a 27-acre historical park and features a collection of authentic ranching structures ranging from the 1780s to 1950s that tell the story of ranching in North America.\nVisitors can explore the evolution of the ranching industry through exhibits that showcase artifacts, tools, and memorabilia. The center also hosts educational programs, annual events, and demonstrations that provide insights into the cowboy way of life and the crucial role ranching played in shaping the American West and continues to impact everyday life. With its commitment to preserving the rich cultural legacy of ranching and educating the future, the National Ranching Heritage Center serves as a valuable resource for both locals and tourists interested in understanding the nation's Western heritage.\nIn 2024, the NRHC announced the location at the center of the forthcoming Red Steagall Institute of Western Art, named for Russell \"Red\" Steagall, an American actor, musician, poet, and stage performer born in Gainesville, Texas. Steagall focuses on American Western and country music genres. The addition will be an art institute featuring interactive classes and displays for the public to learn about Western culture. The Texas Tech System Board of Regents approved the NRHC's $28 million dollar expansion in May 2024. Jim Bret Campbell, executive director of the NRHC, said that the expansion comes after Steagall and his wife sought a location to donate his collection of Western songs, poetry, and various radio and television recordings of his programs.\nHistory\nOn January 22, 2019, the Heritage Center launched an exhibit which shows the importance of the different breeds of cattle brought into the southwestern United States. The first cattle, explains the exhibit, were Andalusian brought to the continent in the second voyage of Christopher Columbus. Later breeds, such as Hereford, Angus, and the Texas Longhorn shaped the destiny of the American West.\nGallery\nFile:Barton House in Lubbock, TX IMG 0052.JPG|The Barton House, an example of Queen Anne style architecture, was relocated to the Heritage Center from Hale County.
