In the accident, all 40 occupants were killed.\nIt was the second fatal air crash in less than a year for Air Nautic. On 29 December 1962, 25 people had been killed in the crash of an Air Nautic Boeing 307..\nInvestigation\nThe accident was investigated by the Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA).\nIn June 1964, the BEA published their findings. The crew made navigation errors after selecting a direct route without reporting their position. Weather conditions were poor and there was limited equipment in Perpignan. The crew also failed to use the Toulouse and Istres VORs for accurate positioning. Air Nautic was aware that the captain and the copilot did not meet the required qualifications for operating a public transport aircraft. Additionally, Air Nautic did not provide the crew with operational instructions that might have prevented the accident. Finally, the crew was in a state of fatigue, which may have affected their performance.\nSee also\n* 1962 Air Nautic Boeing 307 crash\nReferences"
