Prominent communists such as the senator Pablo Neruda fled into exile. González Videla also broke relations with the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact states. A pro-communist miners' strike in Lota was brutally suppressed. Demonstrations against the legislation led to the declaration of martial law and were successfully repressed.\nThe law was replaced by Law n.º 12.927, about State Security Law (Seguridad del Estado), on 6. August 1958 which ended the proscription of the Communist Party and lowered penalties for crimes against state security and public order to levels comparable with those that existed prior to 1948.\nSee also\n* Communist Party of Chile\n* McCarthyism\n* Neruda (2016 film)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.memoriachilena.cl/temas/dest.asp?id=gabrielgonzalezleydedefensa Memoria Chilena]"
