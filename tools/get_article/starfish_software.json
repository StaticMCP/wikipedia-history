It was located in Santa Cruz, California.\nStarfish developed intellectual property for device synchronization, especially for wireless devices. TrueSync was the first over-the-air synchronization system. Starfish was acquired by Motorola for $325 million in 1998.\nThe outspoken founding couple founded another company, LightSurf, in the same year, to develop mobile phone photograph technology.\nIn 2000, the company helped start the SyncML Initiative to standardize synchronization communication protocols.\nIn March 2003, Starfish was acquired by Pumatech in San Jose, California, which was headed by turn-around CEO Woodson Hobbs.\nPumatech later changed its name to Intellisync, and was acquired by Nokia in 2005.\nReferences"
