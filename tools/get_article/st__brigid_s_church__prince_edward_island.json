In 1868, under the guidance of their first priest Rev. James Aeneas McDonald (1820- ?), the Catholic settlers of Lot 11 began constructed their own church.  It was completed in 1873, although by Christmas Eve 1870, construction was far enough advanced that midnight mass was celebrated on a temporary altar.\nThe church was named due to the predominantly Irish pioneer settlement of the area. St. Brigid was a 5th-Century Irish saint.\nIn 1914 a sacristy was added to the church.\nIn 1931 the spire was struck by lightning and during repairs, a new copper cross was installed\nSince 1982, there has been no resident priest.
