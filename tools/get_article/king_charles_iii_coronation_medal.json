The British coronation medal was awarded to Britons as well as select individuals from other Commonwealth realms.\nCanada issued 30,000 coronation medals, awarding them to select members of the Canadian Armed Forces and Public Service, as well as individuals who made significant contributions to the country or achieved accomplishments that brought credit to Canada.\nThe British and Canadian medals are both made of nickel silver and have identical ribbons. However, the two medal designs differ. The British medal features effigies of both the King and Queen (left profiles), while the Canadian medal only features the King (right profile). On the reverse, the British medal has laurels, the royal cypher, and the Tudor Crown, whereas the Canadian medal displays the Canadian royal cypher with the Canadian Royal Crown over a sunburst design.\nBritish medal\nDesign\nThe medals are made of nickel silver and were issued by Worcestershire Medal Service. The effigy on the obverse face designed by Martin Jennings, while the reverse was designed by Phil McDermott of the Worcestershire Medal Service.\nThe obverse features a crowned effigy of the King Charles III and Queen Camilla facing left. The reverse shows the royal cypher R}} surmounted by the Tudor Crown, a laurel wreath and the date of the coronation, 6 May 2023.\nThe medal's ribbon is  in width and includes a red stripe in the centre, with white stripes on each side, followed by dark blue stripes, and then red edge stripes. The design of the ribbon is inspired by the ribbon used for the 1902 King Edward VII Coronation Medal. The ribbon is one of the few design elements which are identical between the British and Canadian medals.\nEligibility\nMore than 400,000 medals were distributed. Those who received the medal include:\n* Individuals who actively contributed to the official coronation events in Westminster Abbey and processions, and other officially recognised ceremonial Coronation events.\n* Serving members of the Armed Forces who had completed five full calendar years of service on 6 May 2023 or participated in Armed Forces Coronation events during the course of 2023.\n* Frontline emergency personnel who had been in paid service, retained or in a voluntary capacity, dealing with emergencies as part of their conditions of service, and who had completed five full calendar years of service on 6 May 2023;\n* Publicly employed prison services personnel who had completed five full calendar years of service on 6 May 2023.\n* Living individual recipients of the Victoria Cross (including Commonwealth versions) and the George Cross (including equivalents such as the Australian Cross of Valour).\nAustralians\nSeveral Australians were awarded the coronation medal administered by the United Kingdom as a personal gift from the King. Each of the recipients had previously been awarded one of Australia's highest honours, namely the Victoria Cross, the Victoria Cross for Australia, George Cross or the Cross of Valour. This followed past practices for awarding coronation and jubilee medals to Australians. Its conferment was a decision of the Buckingham Palace, not that of the Australian Government, although the Australian Government indicated that it had \"no objection\" prior to its conferment to Australians. They were:\n* Keith Payne VC AM\n* Corporal Mark Donaldson VC\n* Daniel Keighran VC\n* Ben Roberts-Smith VC MG\n* Michael Pratt GC\n* Victor Boscoe CV\n* Timothy Britten CV\n* Richard Joyes CV\n* Allan Sparkes CV OAM\n* Darrell Tree CV\nAmong the recipients was Roberts-Smith, a Victoria Cross for Australia recipient, who lost a 2023 civil defamation trial in which the court found that newspapers had successfully proven, on the civil standard of the balance of probabilities, that he was complicit in the murder of four unarmed civilians while deployed in Afghanistan. Three of the initial recipients were presented the medal at Government House, Brisbane on 2 May 2024. Another presentation ceremony for these recipients also took place at Government House, Perth on 27 June 2024.\nThe 60 Australian Defence Force (ADF) members who participated in the King’s coronation procession to Buckingham Palace were also awarded the medal. Additional ADF personnel were presented the medal by the British High Commissioner to Australia, Victoria Treadell, during a ceremony in November 2024.\nCanadians\nMembers of the Canadian Coronation Contingent who took part in the coronation events in London were awarded the British coronation medal, having been approved for wear by Canada. Contingent members who received the British coronation medal are ineligible to be nominated for the Canadian coronation medal.\nJamaicans\nSelect members of the Jamaica Defence Force were conferred the medal in 2025, with recipients including individuals who took part in the coronation.\nNew Zealanders\nSome New Zealanders were awarded the medal. The decision to award the medal is made by the United Kingdom, although New Zealanders requires the approval of the prime minister of New Zealand to wear the medal, as the British medal is considered a foreign honour in New Zealand. However, it is listed in New Zealand's official order of wear.\nThe New Zealand Government did not issue its own medal. Responding to a Official Information Act request, the Clerk to the Executive Council of New Zealand noted that New Zealand hadn't issued medals to mark royal occasions in \"recent times\", primarily due to cost and difficulty in administering a domestic medal programme.\nHistory\nThe British coronation medal was announced on 5 May 2023, the day before the coronation.\nThe Scottish Government initially stated they would not help fund the British coronation medal. However, the government reversed its decision in October 2023, agreeing to help fund its cost for all eligible Scots. The estimated cost to provide all eligible Scots the medal was £200,000.\nCanadian medal\nof the Canadian medal]]\nThe Canadian medal was the first domestic commemorative medal to mark a coronation.}} The Chancellery of Honours of the Office to the Secretary to the Governor General was responsible for administering the medal on behalf of the government of Canada. The medals were manufactured by the Royal Canadian Mint.\nDesign\nThe medal was designed by the Fraser Herald of the Canadian Heraldic Authority, Cathy Bursey-Sabourin. The medal is made out of nickel silver and is coloured silver, with a diameter of , and with a ring suspension.\nThe obverse features a crowned and robed effigy of the King facing right, circumscribed by the inscription \"CHARLES III DEI GRATIA REX • CANADA\" (Latin: \"Charles III, by the Grace of God, King • Canada\"). The reverse shows the royal cypher R}} surmounted by the Canadian Royal Crown, over the sunburst design of the Canadian coronation emblem. The date of the coronation is inscribed to the left of the cypher and the words VIVAT REX (Latin: Long Live The King) to its right.\nThe medal's ribbon design is identical to the British coronation medal, using a dark blue, bright red, and white arrangement.\nEligibility\nThe medal was awarded to 30,000 individuals, including 4,000 members of the Canadian Armed Forces and 1,000 Public Service employees, including those in the Department of National Defence. A further 1,300 were allocated to members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\nPartner organizations chosen by the government of Canada nominated and presented medals to individuals meeting the medal's eligibility criteria. To be eligible for the Canadian medal, a person must:\n*have made a significant contribution to Canada or to a particular province, territory, region of, or community in, Canada, or attained an outstanding achievement abroad that brings credit to Canada; and\n*have been alive on 6 May 2023, the date of the Coronation.\nThere was no requirement for the recipient to be a Canadian citizen.\nHistory\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the coronation medal program on 3 May 2023 to honour Canadians who made significant contributions to the country, a province, territory, region, or community, or achieved abroad in a way that brought credit to Canada. However, little update was provided for the rest of 2023 concerning the status of the medal program.\nExcerpting from a CBC News: Politics report, the Monarchist League of Canada claimed the delay in the medal program was due to two coinciding issues. First, there was a disagreement between the King and his Canadian Cabinet over whether Queen Camilla's effigy should appear on the medal's obverse, with the Cabinet arguing against her inclusion due to her absence from the Canadian order of precedence and the Queen not having a constitutional role. Second, the resignation of the secretary to the governor general, whose office manages the medal program, contributed to the delay.\nThe medal was eventually unveiled on 6 May 2024, on the first anniversary of the coronation. Governor General Mary Simon hosted a virtual ceremony to present the inaugural medals to lieutenant governors and territorial commissioners across Canada. On the same day, some lieutenant governors and territorial commissioners also held presentations in their province or territory, which included the first military recipients of the medal.\nPrecedence in each realm\nSome orders of precedence are as follows:\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background:white; border: 1px #01796F solid; border-collapse: collapse; width:100%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"white\"\n| align=\"center\"| Country || align=\"center\"| Preceding || align=\"center\"| Following\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#A9A9A9\" |  AustraliaOrder of precedence\n|Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee Medal\n|80th Anniversary Armistice Remembrance Medal\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#A9A9A9\" |  CanadaOrder of precedence || Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal|| Royal Canadian Mounted Police Long Service Medal\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#A9A9A9\" |  New Zealand\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee Medal\n|New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#A9A9A9\" |  United KingdomOrder of precedence || Royal Household Long and Faithful Service Medal\n|}\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links"
