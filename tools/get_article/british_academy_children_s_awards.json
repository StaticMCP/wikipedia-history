They were awarded annually since 1996, before which time they were a part of the main British Academy Television Awards. Categories included those for television productions, feature films and video games.\nThe final ceremony, the 25th British Academy Children's Awards, was held on 27 November 2022 at Old Billingsgate in London, and was hosted by television presenter Lindsey Russell. The ceremony marked the return of the awards after a three-year absence due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In September 2023, BAFTA confirmed that the children's awards would be folded and incorporated into the annual film, games and television award ceremonies in 2025 with new categories introduced for children's content.\nHistory\nThe awards were held for the first time in 1996, since then, the awards have been presented annually, with the exception 2020 and 2021, where the awards were not held due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to 1996, productions targeted to children or young audiences were included in the British Academy Television Awards, from 1983 to 1996, two children-oriented categories, Children's Programme – Factual and Children's Programme – Fiction or Entertainment were presented. The last winners for those categories were CBBC's programme Short Change for the former and television movie Coping with Christmas for the latter.\nThe first edition featured seven competitive categories (Animation, Drama, Entertainment, Factual, Pre-School, Schools - Documentary, Schools - Drama), plus two special awards, one for film producer John Coates and the other for Lewis Rudd, who was head to the children's programming for ITV. The number of categories has varied through the editions with the creation of several categories such as International and Feature Film, both in 1999, Pre-School Animation and Presenter, both in 2000, and Game in 2007, among others. Until 2016, the awards also presented categories voted by the public through online voting, these included categories for feature film, television, video game and website.\nCategories\nAs of 2022, the following fourteen competitive categories are presented:\n* Animation\n* Feature Film\n* Pre-School – Animation\n* Pre-School – Live Action\n* Non-Scripted\n* International\n* Content for Change\n* Game\n* Scripted\n* Game\n* Performer\n* Young Performer\n* Director\n* Writer\nCurrent awards winners\nAnimation\n* 2012: The Amazing World of Gumball\n* 2013: Room on the Broom\n* 2014: The Amazing World of Gumball\n* 2015: Shaun the Sheep\n* 2016: The Amazing World of Gumball\n* 2017: Revolting Rhymes\n* 2019: Hilda\n* 2022: The Snail and the Whale\n}}\nPerformer\nYoung Performer\nPre-School\nAnimation\nLive Action\nPresenter\nWriter\nDirector\nInternational\nFeature Film\nGame\n* 2011: Lego Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game\n* 2012: ''Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure\n* 2013: Skylanders: Giants\n* 2014: Mario Kart 8\n* 2015: Splatoon\n* 2016: Lego Dimensions\n* 2017: Pokémon Go\n* 2018: Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle\n* 2019: Astro Bot Rescue Mission\n* 2022: Sackboy: A Big Adventure\n}}\nScripted\nNon-Scripted\nContent for Change\nSpecial Award\nRetired awards winners\nChannel of the Year\nComedy\nDrama\nDrama in 2002|url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/2002/childrens/drama|publisher=British Academy of Film and Television Arts|access-date=16 January 2016}}\n* 2003: Bootleg\n* 2004: Feather Boy\n* 2005: My Life as a Popat\n* 2006: The Giblet Boys\n* 2007: That Summer Day\n* 2008: The Revenge Files of Alistair Fury\n* 2009: Rhestr Nadolig Wil\n* 2010: Tracy Beaker Returns\n* 2011: Just William\n* 2012: Roy\n* 2013: The Dumping Ground\n* 2014: Katie Morag\n* 2015: Katie Morag\n* 2016: Refugee\n* 2017: Like Me\n* 2018: Joe All Alone\n* 2019: Creeped Out\n}}\nEntertainment\nFactual\nFactual Entertainment\nShort Form\nIndependent Production Company\nInteractive\nOriginal\n* 2014: Dixi\n* 2015: Virry\n* 2016: Secret Life of Boys\nAdapted\n* 2014: Disney Animated\n* 2015: The Dumping Ground: You're the Boss\n* 2016: Get Well Soon Hospital with Dr Ranj\n* 2017: Hey Duggee: We Love Animals\nLearning\nPrimary\nSecondary\nPre-School\nDiscontinued in 2000, for separate categories for live-action and animation.\n* 1996: Tots TV\n* 1997: Tots TV (Lapland Out)\n* 1998: Teletubbies\n* 1999: Tecwyn Y Tractor\nSchools: Drama\nSchools Factual\nPrimary\nDiscontinued in 2006 for Learning: Primary.\nSecondary\nDiscontinued in 2006 for Learning: Secondary.\nInteractive\nDiscontinued in 2014 for separate Interactive categories: Original and Adapted''.\nBAFTA Kids' Vote\nDiscontinued in 2009, for separate voting categories for feature film, television, video game and website.\nWebsite\n* 2009: Club Penguin\n* 2010: Club Penguin\n* 2011: Bin Weevils\n* 2012: Bin Weevils\n* 2013: Bin Weevils\n* 2014: Bin Weevils\nFeature Film\nTelevision\nVideo Game\nWriter\nAdapted\nDiscontinued in 2006 for one sole Writer category.\n* 2004: Debbie Isitt (The Illustrated Mum)\n* 2005: Barbara Cox (Wipe Out)\nOriginal\nDiscontinued in 2006 for one sole Writer category.\n* 2004: Tony Collingwood (Yoko!
