Incumbent President Boris Tadić was re-elected as president in the second round with 51% of the vote, defeating challenger Tomislav Nikolić.\nThe elections for president were the first since Serbia became independent, when the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro was dissolved by the secession of Montenegro in 2006. The first round of elections was held on January 20, 2008, when none of the candidates secured an absolute majority of the votes cast. Thus a run-off election took place on February 3, 2008, between Tomislav Nikolić of the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) and Boris Tadić of the Democratic Party (DS) (the incumbent president) who finished first and second respectively in the first round. 6,708,697 registered voters were able to vote, which was around 50,000 more since the parliamentary election held in the beginning of 2007, on 8,481 electoral posts across Serbia and 65 in 36 foreign countries. Of that figure, 37,053 are abroad, 9,187 in military service and 8,201 in prison. Persons residing in Montenegro with Serbian citizenship were also allowed to vote in seven Montenegrin towns: Podgorica, Berane, Herceg Novi, Budva, Tivat, Sutomore and Andrijevica.\nA re-vote of the second round was held in Dobro Polje due to some irregularities on 12 February 2008. Tadić was sworn in for his second term on 15 February 2008.\nBackground\nThe previous session of the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia adopted a Constitutional Law on 10 November 2006 that proclaimed the new Constitution. As per it, parliamentary Speaker Oliver Dulić was to schedule the election by 31 December 2007 or 60 days after the new laws regarding the president of the republic, presidential elections, defense, the military, foreign affairs and the security services are passed. Five of the six necessary laws on presidential elections were passed by the parliamentary majority on 11 December 2007.\nOn 12 December 2007 Dulić had scheduled the first round of election for January 20 and second round for February 3, 2008. The Electoral Commission of the Republic of Serbia declared that candidates were due to apply on December 30, 2007, the latest, submitting 10,000 signatures.\nThe Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and Commonwealth of Independent States were the nationwide neutral observer of the election, including several British and American observers.\nTwo parties representing the Albanians from Preševo Valley, the Democratic Union of the Valley and the Party of Democratic Action called for Albanians from outside Kosovo to participate in the election.\nCandidates\nFirst round\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|Candidates\n|-\n|Tomislav Nikolić of SRS\n|Serbian Radical Party, has nominated Tomislav Nikolić (Томислав Николић)Supported by: Vlach Party, Vlachs of Democratic Serbia, Democratic Community of Serbian Vlachs and Movement \"I live for the Frontier\"Slogan: With All Heart (Свим срцем)\n|-\n|Jugoslav Dobričanin of RS\n|Reformist Party, has nominated Jugoslav Dobričanin (Југослав Добричанин).Slogan: Power of the south (Снага југа)\n|-\n|Boris Tadić of DS\n|Democratic Party has nominated Boris Tadić (Борис Тадић), current President of Serbia.Supported by: G17 Plus, League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina, Sanjak Democratic Party, Civic Initiative of Gora, Roma Union of Serbia, Reformists of Vojvodina, Serbian List for Kosovo and Metohija.Slogan: For a Strong and Stable Serbia (За јаку и стабилну Србију)\n|-\n|Velimir Ilić of NS\n|New Serbia, has nominated Velimir \"Velja\" Ilić (Велимир \"Веља\" Илић).Supported by: Democratic Party of Serbia, United Serbia, Serbian Renewal Movement and List for Sandžak.

Tadić emphasized Serbia's accession process to the European Union, whereas Nikolić stated that Serbia needed to cooperate with both the EU and Russia. Tadić and Nikolić exchanged accusations on each of their own stances regarding the European Union. Tadić criticized Nikolić's Serbian Radical Party for its eurosceptic history, after which Nikolić said that \"Serbia will never be a Russian governorate, but also never a European colony.\" They both shared similar concerns for corruption, poverty, and both candidates told the audience that Kosovo is an integral part of Serbia. However, Nikolić stated in the debate that Kosovo \"will declare independence as soon as the presidential election is finished.\" Just over a month later, Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia.\nForecasting\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\"\n!width=10%|Polling Firm\n!width=12%|Date\n!width=5%|Source\n|Tadić\n|Nikolić\n|Jovanović\n|Ilić\n|Mrkonjić\n|Second round\n|-\n||CeSID||June 2007||||14||10|| || || ||\n|-\n||CeSID||early 2007||||12||9||3|| || ||\n|-\n||Strategic Marketing||October 2007||||24||18|| ||4|| ||\n|-\n||Strategic Marketing||late 2007|| ||38||23||3|| || || Tadić 52 Nikolić 48\n|-\n||Angus Reid||November 7, 2007||||35||31||2|| || ||Tadić 56 Nikolić 44\n|-\n||Factor Plus||12 December 2007|| ||36.5||31.8||8.5||6|| ||\n|-\n||CeSID||10 January 2008||||19||21||3||4||4||Tadić 33 Nikolić 27\n|-\n||Glasaj za||12 January 2008||||22.4||29.5||17.8||3.6||16.9||\n|-\n||CeSID||24–28 January 2008||||||||||||||Tadić 51.1%, Nikolić 48.9%\n|-\n||CeSID||30 January 2008||||||||||||||Tadić 2.10-2.35 million voters Nikolić 2.00-2.25&nbsp;million voters\n|}\nResults\nGallery\nFile:2008 Serbian presidential election by district first round.png|First round results by district\nFile:2008 Serbian presidential election by district second round.png|Second round results by district\nFile:2008 Serbian presidential election by municipality first round.gif|Leading candidate by municipality (first round)\nFile:2008 Serbian presidential election by municipality second round.png|Leading candidate by municipality (second round)\nFile:SerbianPres2008-World.png|Results by country (second round)\nInternational reactions\nBoris Tadić gives a speech after his victory was announced.\n*  - Heinz Fischer, President of Austria, congratulated Tadić and stated \"I am absolutely convinced that your reelection will strengthen pro-European course of Serbia\".
