All 50 states and the District of Columbia, were part of the 1984 United States presidential election. Hawaii voters chose 4 electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president of the United States. Hawaii was won by incumbent United States President Ronald Reagan of California, who was running against former Vice President Walter Mondale of Minnesota. Reagan ran for a second time with former C.I.A. Director George H. W. Bush of Texas, and Mondale ran with Representative Geraldine Ferraro of New York, the first major female candidate for the vice presidency.\nHawaii voted 7% more Democratic than the national average in this election. This election and that of 1972 are the only two presidential races where Hawaii voted Republican. This is also the last time the Democratic presidential nominee failed to win every county in Hawaii, and the last time Republicans carried any congressional district in the state. This was the third and final presidential race in which Oahu voted Republican.\nReagan won the election in Hawaii with a decisive 11-point win. The election results in Hawaii are reflective of a nationwide reconsolidation of the base for the Republican Party which took place through the 1980s; called by Reagan the \"second American Revolution.\" This was most evident during the 1984 presidential election. No Republican candidate has received as strong of support in the American Pacific states at large, as Reagan did. Hawaii was one of five states Reagan lost in 1980 but won in 1984; the others were Georgia, West Virginia, Maryland and Rhode Island.\nDemocratic caucus\nGary Hart and John Glenn, who were not on the ballot, told their supporters to vote uncommitted. Uncommitted won the caucus. On May 26, the state convention selected 13 uncommitted and 6 Mondale delegates.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1984 United States presidential election in Hawaii\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f33; width:3px;\"|\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Republican\n| Ronald Reagan (incumbent)\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 185,050\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 55.10%\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 4\n|-\n! style=\"background:#33f; width:3px;\"|\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic\n| Walter Mondale\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 147,154\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 43.82%\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 0\n|-\n! style=\"background:#FFCC00; width:3px;\"|\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Libertarian\n| David Bergland\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 2,167\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 0.65%\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 0\n|-\n! style=\"background:#c00; width:3px;\"|\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Communist Party\n| Gus Hall\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 821\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 0.24%\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 0\n|-\n! style=\"background:#DDDDDD; width:3px;\"|\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Independent\n| Lyndon LaRouche\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 654\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 0.19%\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 0\n|-  style=\"background:#eee; text-align:right;\"\n| colspan=\"3\"| Totals\n|| 335,846\n|| 100.0%\n|| 4\n|}\nResults by county\n{| width=\"60%\"  class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"| County\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Ronald ReaganRepublican\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Walter MondaleDemocratic\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Various candidatesOther parties\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Margin\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Total votes cast\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| #\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| %\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| #\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| %\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| #\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| %\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| #\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| %\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| | Hawaii\n| | 20,707\n| | 52.90%\n| | 17,866\n| | 45.64%\n| | 570\n| | 1.46%\n| | 2,841\n| | 7.26%\n| | 39,143\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| | Honolulu\n| | 140,323\n| | 56.08%\n| | 107,444\n| | 42.94%\n| | 2,470\n| | 0.98%\n| | 32,879\n| | 13.14%\n| | 250,237\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| | Kauai\n| | 9,249\n| | 50.45%\n| | 8,862\n| | 48.34%\n| | 221\n| | 1.21%\n| | 387\n| | 2.11%\n| | 18,332\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| | Maui\n| | 14,720\n| | 52.45%\n| | 12,966\n| | 46.20%\n| | 381\n| | 1.35%\n| | 1,754\n| | 6.25%\n| | 28,067\n|-\n!Totals!!185,050!!55.10%!!147,154!!43.82%!!3,642!!1.08%!!37,896!!11.28%!!335,846\n|}\nCounties that flipped from Democratic to Republican\n*Hawaii\n*Kauai\n*Maui\nSee also\n* Presidency of Ronald Reagan\nReferences"
