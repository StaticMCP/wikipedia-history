The name is believed to be of Aboriginal origin, meaning thigh. In an 1883 map, the Durah run appears with Durah Creek flowing through it and joining Charleys Creek to the south. It is not known whether the creek (with gully and waterhole), or the run was named first.\nFairyland West Provisional School opened on 1 May 1941, becoming Fairyland West State School on 26 April 1957. It closed in 1980. It was located on Fairyland School Road, just east of Charleys Creek (approx ). Despite the name, the school's location is now within Durah.\nDemographics\nIn the , Durah had a population of 6 people.\nIn the , Durah had \"no people or a very low population\".\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Durah.
