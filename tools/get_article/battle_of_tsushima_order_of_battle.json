The utter destruction of Russian naval power at Tsushima was the climactic action of the Russo-Japanese War.\nThe Russian fleet had suffered such attrition from Japanese mines and combat with the Japanese fleet during 1904 that the Russian high command made the fateful decision to dispatch the Baltic Fleet in October of that year to the Pacific coast base at Vladivostok. This involved an exhausting voyage of over seven months; those ships that went down the Atlantic, around Cape of Good Hope, across the Indian Ocean and up the China Sea eventually covered  before ending in disaster as the fleet attempted to transit Tsushima Strait.\nVice-Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky, in command of the Russian fleet, rejected the idea of circling the Japanese home islands to the east as impractical and instead drove straight through Tsushima Strait as the most direct route to Vladivostok. Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō, in command of the Japanese fleet, was waiting in port at Busan on the Korean coast.\nDespite the devastation of its navy, Russia could have continued the war. For their part, the Japanese did not want to reveal how much they had been weakened by wartime expenditures and agreed to a settlement negotiated by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt at Portsmouth, New Hampshire.\nJapanese Combined Fleet\nFirst Squadron\nat Kure Naval Base near the city of Hiroshima]]\non the northwest coast of Kyushu]]\nat Yokosuka Naval Base at the mouth of Tokyo Bay]]\non the Inland Sea]]\nAdmiral Tōgō Heihachirō in Mikasa\nFirst Division\nVice Admiral Misu Sōtarō in Nisshin\n: 4 pre-Dreadnought battleships (all 4 × 12-inch (305 mm), 18 knots)\n:: 1 Formidable-class variant\n:::  (Capt.

This was most unfortunate for the Russians as Makarov was considered their most aggressive admiral by far.\n* His replacement, Rear-Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft, was killed along with his immediate staff by Japanese shellfire at the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August 1904.\n* Having completed the arduous voyage from the Baltic Sea, Vice-Admiral Rozhestvensky was severely wounded during the first day's combat at Tsushima and captured. Treated as an honored guest by the Japanese, he recovered from his injuries and was repatriated after the war.\n* Rear-Admiral Nebogatov surrendered himself and the remnant of the devastated Russian fleet the day after Rozhestvensky's wounding but found it to be unexpectedly challenging. Having been tricked earlier by a Chinese vessel that hoisted a white flag, Admiral Togo at first refused to believe the Russians were surrendering and continued shelling. Not until Nebogatov literally had Japanese rising sun flags hoisted on his ships' masts did Togo relent.\nFollowing repatriation, Rozhestvensky was court-martialed, pled guilty and pardoned. Nebogatov and other officers involved in the surrender of the fleet were assigned the death penalty but had their sentences commuted to prison.\nBattle Fleet\n]]\n]]\n]]\n]]\n: First Division\n: Vice-Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky in Knyaz Suvorov\n:: 4 Borodino-class battleships (4 × 12-inch (305 mm), 18 knots)\n::: Knyaz Suvorov  (Capt. 1st rank Vasily Ignatius)\n::: Imperator Aleksandr III  (Capt. 1st rank Nikolai Bukhvostov)\n::: Borodino  (Capt. 1st rank Pyotr Serebrennikov)\n::: Oryol  (Capt. 1st rank Nikolay Yung)\n:: 1 Izumrud-class protected cruiser (6 × 4.7-inch (120 mm) guns, 24 knots)\n::: Zhemchug (Capt. 2nd rank Pavel Levitsky)\n: Second Division\n: Captain 1st rank Vladimir Baer in Oslyabya\n:: 3 pre-Dreadnought battleships\n::: Oslyabya (Peresvet-class)  (Capt. 1st rank Vladimir Baer)\n::: Sissoi Veliky (battleship)  (Capt. 1st rank Manuil Ozerov)\n::: Navarin (variant of Trafalgar-class)  (Capt. 1st rank Baron Bruno von Vietinghoff)\n:: 1 Imperieuse-class armored cruiser (variant)\n::: Admiral Nakhimov  (Capt. 1st rank Aleksandr Rodionov)\n:: 1 'Izumrud-class protected cruiser'\n::: Izumrud  (Capt. 2nd rank Hans William von Fersen)\n: Third Division\n: Rear-Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov in Imperator Nikolai I\n:: 1 Imperator Aleksandr II-class battleship\n::: Imperator Nikolai I  (Capt. 1st rank Vladimir Smirnov)\n:: 3 Admiral Ushakov-class coastal defense ships\n::: General Admiral Graf Apraksin  (Capt. 1st rank Nikolai Lishin)\n::: Admiral Seniavin  (Capt. 1st rank )\n::: Admiral Ushakov  (Capt. 1st rank Vladimir Miklukha)\n: First Cruiser Division\n: Rear-Admiral Oskar Enkvist) in Oleg\n:: 2 protected cruisers\n::: Oleg (Bogatyr-class) (Capt. 1st rank Leonid Dobrotvorsky)\n::: Aurora (Pallada-class) (Capt. 1st rank Evgeny Egoriev, Capt. 2nd rank Arkady Nebolsin)\n:: 2 armored cruisers\n::: Dmitrii Donskoi  (Capt. 1st rank Ivan Lebedev)\n::: Vladimir Monomakh  (Capt. 1st rank Vladimir Popov)\n: Second Scouting Division\n:: 1 protected cruiser\n::: Svetlana  (Capt. 1st rank Sergei Shein)\n:: 1 armed merchant cruiser\n::: Ural  (Capt. 2nd rank Mikhail Istomin)\nDestroyer Flotilla\n* First Destroyer Division\n** Byedovy (Capt. 2nd rank Nikolai Baranov)\n** Bystryy (1902) (Lt.
