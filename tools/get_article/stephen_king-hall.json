This was to be supplemented by \"a defence system of non-violence against violence\" - what is often called \"defence by civil resistance\" or \"social defence\".\nIn Men of Destiny he criticised all sides for the creation of the Cold War and further promoted his aim of nuclear disarmament.\nThere have been several accounts and appraisals of his work advocating unilateral nuclear disarmament and defence by civil resistance.\nChildren\n* Letters to Hilary, 1928&nbsp;\n* Hilary Growing Up, 1929, E.
