The band—comprised of two Ukrainian artists and one Swedish-American—met while living in emergency residence at Ifö Center, a multidisciplinary art space in Bromölla, Sweden.\nIn the quiet chaos of temporary refuge, they began creating music using what was available. Their first sessions took place in abandoned factory spaces and makeshift studios, where limitations sparked innovation. From these raw beginnings, Cooking Potato developed a sound rooted in texture, intuition, and emotional honesty.\nTheir work blends ambient soundscapes, voice-as-instrument techniques, drone, and abstract noise. No two performances are alike. Each is an improvised, immersive event often held in unconventional spaces.\nWith no fixed genre or central front figure, Cooking Potato resists categorization. Their ethos is collaborative. “We listen deeply, we adapt, and we create without borders.” Since their debut, they’ve performed across Europe and continue to release new material. As they continue evolving, Cooking Potato invites listeners into an auditory space where uncertainty becomes fertile ground.\nMembers\nGuitar/ voice - Vitali Fesenko (Ukraine)\nBass/synth - Serg Golovatenko (Ukraine)\nDrums/percussion/voice/homemade instruments - Jonathan Haner (Sweden/USA)\nAlbums\n[https://soundcloud.com/cookingpotato1/sets/the-tesla-hall-sessions The Tesla Hall Sessions (August 10 2024)]\n[https://soundcloud.com/cookingpotato1/sets/the-bride-sessions Bride Sessions (October 24, 2024)]\n[https://soundcloud.com/cookingpotato1/sets/son-of-sessions Son Of Sessions (March 24, 2025)]\n[https://soundcloud.com/cookingpotato1/sets/lerlagret-sessions The Lerlagret Sessions (May 17, 2025)]\n[https://soundcloud.com/cookingpotato1/sets/midsummer-sessions Midsummer Session (June 22, 2025)]\n[https://soundcloud.com/cookingpotato1/sets/insect-apocalypse Insect Apocalypse (July 17, 2025)]\nS:T Petri Sessions (August 13, 2025)\nExternal links\n* https://soundcloud.com/cookingpotato1\n* https://www.cookingpotato.com/\n* https://cookingpotato.bandcamp.com/\n* https://ifocenter.com/"
