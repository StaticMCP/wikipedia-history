It is the highest of Spain’s multilateral cooperation bodies. It has no constitutional or statutory basis. It is chaired by the Prime Minister (in Spanish, President of the Government) and the 17 presidents of the autonomous communities and the 2 mayors-president autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla. A first meeting under the presidency of Felipe González in 1990 can be considered precedent-setting.\nThis is a common cooperation body in politically decentralised states. These top-level political meetings, with similar names, are also held in countries such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy and Canada. At the end of the twentieth century and the beginning of the XXI, it has assumed great importance as a driving force in the development of the so-called cooperative federalism, fundamentally in Germany and Austria.\nIn all these countries, the Conference of Presidents is institutionalized, either through agreements that regulate aspects relating to the functioning and contents of meetings (in the case of Switzerland or Italy), or through the recognition of a political practice by habit, which is inherent in the cooperative operation of the state (Germany, Austria or Canada).\nHistory\nThe creation of the Conference of Presidents was announced by the President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, in its inaugural meeting and was established on October 28, 2004. Given its nature and political level, its scope of action is open and its purpose is to debate and adopt agreements on matters of special relevance to the autonomous system.\nIts functioning is flexible and its decisions are based on the principle of the agreement of the participants, in practice it is a merely consultative body of the Central Government with the autonomous communities and cities.The Conference of Presidents, in its first editions, was held with irregular periodicity, and always at the proposal of the Government of the Nation. Starting with the V Conference of Presidents, held on December 14, 2009, the Government approved a regulation establishing that the conferences would be held on an annual basis, although this was not fulfilled.\nThus, Zapatero's first government held meetings on 28 October 2004, 10 September 2005 and 11 January 2007. During Zapatero's second government, only one conference was held, on 14 December 2009. Mariano Rajoy held only one conference during his first term, on 2 October 2012. In January 2017, during his second term, the second conference was held with Rajoy at the helm.\nThe prime minister, Pedro Sánchez was the one who convened the most conferences, up to twenty between 2020 and 2022, many of them due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact since the seventh conference, most of the meetings held between 2020 and 2021 were teleconferences.\nComposition\n{| class=\"wikitable col4cen\"\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" |Number\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" |Date\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" |Location\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" |Prime Minister\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=\"15%\" |Agenda\n|-\n|1st\n| align=\"center\" |28 October  2004\n| rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" |Palace of the Senate(Madrid, Madrid)\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color:\" |\n| rowspan=\"4\" |José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero\n|\n|-\n|2nd\n| align=\"center\" |10 Septiembre 2005\n|\n|-\n|3rd\n| align=\"center\" |11 January 2007\n|\n|-\n|4th\n| align=\"center\" |14 December 2009\n|\n|-\n|5th\n| align=\"center\" |2 October 2012\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color:\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Mariano Rajoy Brey\n|\n|-\n|6th\n| align=\"center\" |17 January 2017\n|\n|-\n|7th\n| align=\"center\" |15 March 2020\n| rowspan=\"14\" align=\"center\" |Extraordinary meetingsby teleconference due to the COVID-19 pandemic\n| rowspan=\"21\" style=\"background-color:\" |\n| rowspan=\"21\" |Pedro Sánchez Pérez-Castejón\n| rowspan=\"14\" |\n}}\n|-\n|8th\n| align=\"center\" |22 March 2020\n|-\n|9th\n| align=\"center\" |29 March 2020\n|-\n|10th\n| align=\"center\" |5 April 2020\n|-\n|11th\n| align=\"center\" |12 April 2020\n|-\n|12th\n| align=\"center\" |19 April 2020\n|-\n|13th\n| align=\"center\" |26 April 2020\n|-\n|14th\n| align=\"center\" |3 May 2020\n|-\n|15th\n| align=\"center\" |10 May 2020\n|-\n|16th\n| align=\"center\" |17 May 2020\n|-\n|17th\n| align=\"center\" |24 May 2020\n|-\n|18th\n| align=\"center\" |31 May 2020\n|-\n|19th\n| align=\"center\" |7 June 2020\n|-\n|20th\n| align=\"center\" |14 June 2020\n|-\n|21st\n| align=\"center\" |31 July 2020\n| align=\"center\" |San Millán de Yuso Monastery(San Millán de la Cogolla, La Rioja)\n|\n|-\n|22nd\n| align=\"center\" |4 September 2020\n| rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |Meeting by teleconference\n|\n}}\n|-\n|23rd\n| align=\"center\" |26 October 2020\n|\n}}\n|-\n|24th\n| align=\"center\" |30 July 2021\n| align=\"center\" |Saint Stephen Convent(Salamanca, Salamanca)\n|\n}}\n|-\n|25th\n| align=\"center\" |22 December 2021\n| align=\"center\" |Meeting by teleconference\n|\n}}\n|-\n|26th\n| align=\"center\" |13 March 2022\n| align=\"center\" |Benahoarita Archaeological Museum(Los Llanos de Aridane, Santa Cruz de Tenerife)\n| Finalmente se celebró el 13 de marzo en Los Llanos de Aridane, municipio de la isla de La Palma, unos meses después del fin de la erupción volcánica en Cumbre Vieja.
