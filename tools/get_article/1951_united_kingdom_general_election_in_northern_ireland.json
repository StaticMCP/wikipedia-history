Four Ulster Unionist candidates were returned unopposed, the last UK general election in which any candidates were so returned. The Nationalists also lost one seat to retirement. It was gained by Michael O'Neill, an independent Nationalist.\nIn the election as a whole, the Labour Party government led by Clement Attlee, which had won with a narrow majority in the previous election, lost out to the Conservative Party, which included the Ulster Unionists, led by Sir Winston Churchill, who returned as Prime Minister.\n}}\n|gain       = 0\n|loss       = 1\n|net        = -1\n|votes      = 274,928\n|votes %    = 59.4\n|seats %    = 75.0\n|plus/minus = -3.4\n}}\n|}\nMPs elected\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!
