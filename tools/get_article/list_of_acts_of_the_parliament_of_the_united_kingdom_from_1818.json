For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\nAll modern acts have a short title, e.g. \"the Local Government Act 2003\".  Some earlier acts also have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n58 Geo. 3\nThe sixth session of the 5th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 27 January 1818 until 10 June 1818.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 58 G. 3.\nPublic general acts\n|note4= }}\n|  to provide for the more deliberate Investigation of Presentments to be made by Grand Juries for Roads and Public Works in Ireland, and for accounting for Money raised by such Presentments.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and Solicitors, to make and file the same on or before the First Day of Hilary Term One thousand eight hundred and nineteen, and to allow Persons to make and file such Affidavits, although the Persons whom they served shall have neglected to take out their Annual Certificate.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  for repealing the Duties of Customs on Madder imported into Great Britain, and for granting other Duties in lieu thereof.|note4= }}\n|  for punishing Mutiny and Desertion, and to indemnify certain Persons in relation thereto.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  for preventing the further Circulation of Dollars and Tokens issued by the Governor and Company of the Bank of England.|note4= }}\n|  for the Encouragement of the Fisheries carried on in the Greenland Seas and Davis's , so far as relates to the Oaths thereby required to be taken.|note4= }}\n|  for reducing the Duties payable on Horses used for the Purposes therein mentioned.}}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  and Fifty sixth Years of His present Majesty's Reign, for regulating the Trade in Spirits between Great Britain and Ireland reciprocally, and to amend the same.|note4= }}\n|\n|  for establishing the Use of an Hydrometer called Sikes's Hydrometer, in ascertaining the Strength of Spirits, instead of Clarke's Hydrometer;
