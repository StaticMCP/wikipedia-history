In return for military support, Dularai Shah promised Sukaldeo assistance against the growing threat of the Chand rulers.\nThe Battle\nAs Purush Pant’s army advanced through the Katyur valley, Sukaldeo strategically cut off their supply lines, weakening the invading forces. The Garhwal army, reinforced by local warriors called Padyars, confronted the Chand troops.\nIn the ensuing battle, a Garhwali soldier fatally wounded Purush Pant by hurling a spear (bhuriya). After his death, the Padyars severed his head and, as per the king's orders, transported it in stages (charit charit) to King Dularai Shah . In return, those who carried the head were rewarded with villages as fiefs at their halts.\nAftermath\nThe initial Garhwal victory enraged Rudra Chand, who promptly organized a retaliatory campaign. He marched on Katyur, captured Sukaldeo, and later released him on parole with a promise secured by a local noble, Ratu Bora of Baurrarau. However, when the terms were not met, Rudra Chand re-invaded Katyur.\nIn the subsequent conflict, Sukaldeo and Ratu were executed, and Katyur was annexed to the Chand kingdom of Kumaon. Rudra Chand then consolidated his rule, extending the Chand dynasty’s influence further across the region.\nSignificance\nThe Battle of Badhangarh was a pivotal event in the medieval history of Kumaon and Garhwal:\n* It marked the decline of the independent Katyuri dynasty.\n* It demonstrated the military resilience of the Garhwal kingdom in defending its territories.\n* The battle and its aftermath reflected the political ruthlessness and territorial ambition of Rudra Chand.\nSee also\n* Chand dynasty\n* Garhwal Kingdom\n* History of Kumaon\nReferences"
