The limestone building is north across the street from the Church of Christ (Temple Lot) headquarters and diagonally opposite the Community of Christ Temple.\nThe Church began construction on the site in 1884, and the completed building was dedicated on April 6, 1888. From the early 1900s until the dedication of the Community of Christ Auditorium in 1958, the Stone Church was the headquarters building of the RLDS Church. Administrative offices and General Conference meetings were transferred in 1958 to the Auditorium, and in 1994 to the Temple after 1994. The structure is still in use today as a regular congregational meeting location and community outreach programs.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.stone-church.org/index.html Official Website, stone-church.org]"
