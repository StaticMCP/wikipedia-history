Her mother was a woman from the Gwangju Gim clan. Lady Sunhwa, King Chungseon's fifth wife, was one of her elder sisters.\nMarriage and palace life\nIn 1313, she married King Chungsuk and was promoted to Consort Deok (), while her biological parents were given the honorary titles of Internal Prince Namyang () and Grand Madame of Gwangju County (). She was rumored to be intelligent and tidy when she was young, and after entering the palace, it was said that she followed the etiquette carefully and was loved by the king.\nIn 1315, she gave birth to her first son, Wang Jeong. Although she was the king's first wife, Goryeo kings had to marry Yuan imperial women, so she had to move into Duke Jeongan's manor. However, the king left the palace every night to meet her, which made Yilianzhenbala, the Yuan princess, hate Lady Hong badly.\nIn 1318, Lady Hong, the king and the princess went to Yeongyeong Palace () to enjoy a banquet. At this time, when the king approached Lady Hong, Yilianzhenbala felt jealous and fought with him. The fight eventually escalated and he hit her. Yilianzhenbala suddenly died a year later and subsequently, the other Yuan princess, Jintong, also died during childbirth. Thus, the relationship between the king and Lady Hong deepened. In 1330, she gave birth to their second son, Wang Gi.\nNot long after this, the king abdicated the throne to Wang Jeong and their relationship began to crack little by little; finally, he expelled to her hometown and banned her from meeting their son. In 1332, Lady Hong was restored and she returned to Gaegyeong.\nTwo sons' reign\nDuring King Chunghye's reign, her residence was called as Deokgyeong Mansion (), but the name was changed into Munye Mansion () during King Gongmin's reign. Also under his command, she was elevated to Dowager Consort () and later received the new honorary name, Royal Queen Dowager Sungyeong () while stayed in Sungyeong Mansion ().\nShe was in a confrontation with Sin Don and frequently made remarks about the radical reform policies of Gongmin. In particular, when she saw him executing several officials who were obstacles to the policies, she reproached him. When Sin Don was executed, her relationship with her son improved.\nAfter Gongmin's death, her grandson ascended the throne as King U. In 1376, the boy's biological mother, a slave belonging to Sin Don called Banya, snuck into her residence to protest the fact that she was not acknowledged as the king's mother. Lady Hong drove the woman out, and later had her thrown into the Imjin River.\nDeath\nLady Hong lived for another 40 years after her husband's death, dying on 12 February 1380 (6th year reign of King U's reign) at 81 years old. She then received her posthumous name and was buried in the Yeongneung Mausoleum (). Until 1391, her ancestral rites were held alongside those of King Chungjeong's biological mother, Lady Yun. Shortly after her death, her relatives and supporters, such as Gyeong Bok-heung (), were immediately purged.\nFamily\n*Father\n**Hong Gyu (; 1242–1316)\n*Mother\n**Biological: Lady Gim of the Gwangju Gim clan, Grand Madame of Gwangju County (; 1258–1339)\n**Stepmother: Lady Im of the Jincheon Im clan ()\n* Sibling(s)\n**Older brother: Hong Yung ()\n**Older sister: Lady Hong ()\n**Older sister: Lady Hong ()\n**Older sister: Lady Sunhwa, Consort Hong of the Namyang Hong clan (; ? – 1306)\n***Brother-in-law: King Chungseon of Goryeo (; 1275–1325)\n**Older sister: Lady Hong ()\n*Husband: Wang Man, King Chungsuk (; 31 July 1294 – 3 May 1339)\n** Father-in-law: Wang Jang, King Chungseon (; 20 October 1275 – 23 June 1325)\n** Mother-in-law: Yaksokjin, Consort Ui (; ? – 6 August 1316)\n* Issue\n** Son: Wang Jeong, King Chunghye (; 22 February 1315 – 30 January 1344)\n** Son: Wang Gi/Jeon, King Gongmin (공민 왕기/전; 23 May 1330 – 27 October 1374)\nIn popular culture\n*Portrayed by Uhm Yoo-shin in the 2005–2006 MBC TV series Sin Don.\n*Portrayed by Kim Chung in the 2012–2013 SBS TV series The Great Seer.\n*Portrayed by Lee Duk-hee in the 2014 KBS1 TV series Jeong Do-jeon.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.doopedia.co.kr/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view&MAS_IDX=101013000899742 명덕태후] on Doosan Encyclopedia .\n*[http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Index?contents_id=E0018235 Queen Mother Myeongdeok] on the Encyclopedia of Korean Culture ."
