The company was established in 1875 and services started in 1877. It was promoted by Francis Needham, 3rd Earl of Kilmorey. It was the first tramway service in Ireland. The Earl sold the tramway in 1884 for £4,000 (equivalent to £|r=0}}}} in ).  In 1910, the manager was Bernard Reilly.\nFares\nIn 1890 the fares were\n*1st Class single 6d (equivalent to £|r=2}}}} in )\n*1st Class return 9d (equivalent to £|r=2}}}} in )\n*3rd Class single 4d (equivalent to £|r=2}}}} in )\n*3rd Class return 6d (equivalent to £|r=2}}}} in )\nExtension plan\nIn 1908 plans were made to purchase the tramway, electrify it and extend it as far as Newcastle, County Down, however, these plans came to nothing.\nClosure\nEarly in 1915 a storm washed away part of the line and following this, the service never resumed.\nSee also\n* Newry, Warrenpoint and Rostrevor Railway\nReferences"
