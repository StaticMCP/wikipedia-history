Over the years the building has served as a school, a hospital, a dormitory, a library, and a museum, and is currently occupied by apartments. It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.\nHistory\nThe original Fifth Ward School was completed in 1854. It burned down the next year, and the architect Isaiah Rogers was contracted to rebuild the school. The result, the current building in modified Renaissance Revival style, was completed in 1857. The school later came to be known as the Monsarrat School, after its first principal, Laura Lucas Monsarrat.\nThe Fifth Ward School would serve three hundred children annually. During the Civil War it served as a hospital. During World War II, the building became a dormitory for soldiers.\nFrom 1937 to 1951, the Monsarrat School was used to operate the Free Public Library and Museum, on loan from the Board of Education. This was due to the flood of 1937 that damaged the Louisville Free Public Library building. The museum was located on the first floor. Visitors had to pack into the small museum location until a new one could be afforded.\nOn May 20, 1940, the library on York Street reopened; however, the museum continued on at the Monsarrat for another 37 years. In 1977, the museum was relocated to downtown, where it is now known as the Kentucky Science Center.\nIn the 1980s the Monsarrat building was transformed into upscale apartments.\nReferences\n* [http://www.monopolyrealtyco.com/MS_BLDG_HIST.htm History of the Monserrat Building.
