The club would go on to reach the semi-finals without playing a match due to a combination of an inability to agree on a venue, opponents withdrawing from the competition and byes. After drawing with Wanderers at a neutral venue in London, Queen's were forced to withdraw as they could not afford to return to London for a replay.\nDuring the club's early years, the team would play in dark blue shirts, grey shorts and black socks. The now traditional black and white hoops weren't introduced until October 1873.\nResults\nFA Cup\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Date\n!Round\n!Opponents\n!H / A\n!ResultF–A\n!Scorers\n!Attendance\n|-bgcolor=#ddffdd\n|November 1871\n|First round\n| Donington School\n|H\n|colspan=\"3\"|Not played\n|-bgcolor=#ddffdd\n|December 1871\n|Second round\n| Donington School\n|colspan=\"4\"|Walkover\n|-bgcolor=#ddffdd\n|January 1872\n|Quarter-final\n|colspan=\"5\"|Bye\n|-bgcolor=#ffffcc\n|5 March 1872\n|Semi-final\n| Wanderers\n|N\n|0–0\n|\n|\n|-bgcolor=#ffdddd\n|March 1872\n|Semi-final replay\n| Wanderers\n|N\n|colspan=\"3\"|Walkover\n|}\n;Notes\nFriendly\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Date\n!Opponents\n!H / A\n!ResultF–A\n!Scorers\n!Attendance\n|-bgcolor=#ddffdd\n|7 October 1871\n|Granville\n|H\n|1–0\n|\n|\n|}\nSquad statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"bottom\"|Name\n!colspan=\"2|FA Cup\n|-\n!Apps\n!Goals\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|R.
