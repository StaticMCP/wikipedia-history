Inwoo Production which represented trot singers Jang Yun-jeong and Park Hyun-bin announced the boycott and questioned the fairness of the awards ceremony. SM Entertainment stated through a press release that they have reservations regarding the fairness and criteria used in their nomination process, citing that Girls' Generation had topped a music chart for nine consecutive weeks but was never placed first place on their show and only debut on their charts a month after the album was released. They also asked the organizers to remove their artists from a mobile poll requiring voters to pay a fee in order to participate stating that they \"do not want to see fans suffer any damage from the poll which has commercial intentions\". Also absent from the event were boy band SS501 represented by DSP Media, singer and actress Son Dam-bi, and girl group After School under Pledis Entertainment. However, they cited scheduling conflicts for their absence rather than a boycott.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
