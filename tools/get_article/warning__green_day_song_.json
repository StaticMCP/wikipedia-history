It is the second single and title track from their sixth album of the same name. The song was a number-three modern-rock hit in the United States. The song also peaked at No. 27 on the UK Singles Chart, and No. 1 on the UK Rock & Metal Singles Chart.\nComposition\nThe main guitar riff of \"Warning\" has been compared to the Kinks' song \"Picture Book\".\nMusic video\nThe music video for \"Warning\" premiered on MTV in January 2001. It was directed by Francis Lawrence and shows the life of a rather oblivious young man who does dangerous, socially unacceptable and trivial things during his day. His punch-in card reveals his name to be John Earle.\nLive performances\nDespite being included in the band's greatest hits albums International Superhits! and ''God's Favorite Band, as well as appearing as a playable track in the video game Green Day: Rock Band'', the band did not perform the song live for 21 years since 2001, until it was performed during a warm-up show before their performance at the 2022 Lollapalooza.\nTrack listings\nUS 7-inch single\n:A1. \"Warning\"\n:B1. \"Scumbag\"\n:B2. \"Outsider\"\nUK CD1\n# \"Warning\" (album version) – 3:42\n# \"Scumbag\" – 1:44\n# \"I Don't Want to Know If You Are Lonely\" – 3:08\nUK CD2\n# \"Warning\" (album version) – 3:42\n# \"Outsider\" – 2:17\n# \"Suffocate\" – 2:57\nUK 7-inch single\n:A. \"Warning\" (album version) – 3:42\n:B. \"Suffocate\"\nAustralian CD single\n# \"Warning\" – 3:42\n# \"Minority\" (album version)\n# \"Scumbag\" – 1:44\n# \"Outsider\" – 2:17\nJapanese CD single\n# \"Warning\" – 3:42\n# \"Scumbag\" – 1:44\n# \"Outsider\" – 2:17\n# \"I Don't Want to Know If You Are Lonely\" – 3:08\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Weekly chart performance for \"Warning\"\n!Chart (2000–2001)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Canada (BDS)\n|54\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Poland (Polish Airplay Charts)\n|align=\"center\"|12\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Year-end chart performance for \"Warning\"\n!Chart (2001)\n!Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Modern Rock Tracks (Billboard)\n|30\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Triple-A (Billboard)\n|48\n|}\nRelease history\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders unsortable\"\n|+Release dates and formats for \"Warning\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Region\n!scope=\"col\"|Date\n!scope=\"col\"|Format(s)\n!scope=\"col\"|Label(s)\n!scope=\"col\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|United States\n|December 5, 2000\n|Active rock radio\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Reprise\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|United Kingdom\n|December 11, 2000\n|\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Japan\n|December 20, 2000\n|rowspan=\"2\"|CD\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia\n|January 15, 2001\n|\n|}\nReferences\nit:Warning#Musica"
