The battle was from June 28 to July 10, and several raids and offensives after that until the fall of the Saqqawists. The Hazara volunteers from Jang Kala under the leadership of Fateh Mohammad Khan defended their positions and launched a few attacks on the Saqqawists in Jalrez and the surrounding areas. The hordes of the Saqqawist army were successfully repelled by the Hazaras and the Saqqawist army retreated after many of them were killed or captured. This was one of the battles recorded between the Hazaras and the Saqqawists when trying to enter Hazarajat\nThe battle\nThe battle lasted 11 days, from June 28, 1929, until July 8, 1929 The Hazaras were winning and in the later days especially on the last day (July 8) the Hazaras inflicted heavy losses on the Saqqawists and captured a lot of Saqqawist soldiers as well as capturing a large stock of weapons and ammunition. The Saqqawist army was ready to fight with 5000 men, but the Hazara soldiers Shouting \"Ya Ali\" killed and captured many of them and drove them back to Jalrez, capturing Qala-e-Majid (Majid fort) and several villages in Jalrez, then looting the fort and villages as well as setting them on fire, as revenge to what happened in Sare-Chashmah. Many of the Saqqawist soldiers unable to stand the onslaught attack of the Hazaras, dropped their weapons and surrendered themselves.\nReferences"
