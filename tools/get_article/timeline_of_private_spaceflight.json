Gardner holding a \"For Sale\" sign in 1984, referring to recovered non-functional private satellites (Palapa B-2 and Westar 6, both were later successfully relaunched)]]\nThe following is a timeline of important events in the history of private spaceflight, including important technical as well as legislative and political advances. Though the industry has its origins in the early 1960s, soon after the beginning of the Space Age, private companies did not begin conducting launches into space until the 1980s, and it was not until the 21st century that multiple companies began privately developing and operating launch vehicles and spacecraft in earnest.\nBefore 1980\n* 12 December 1961 – OSCAR 1, the first amateur built satellite, is launched aboard an American Thor-Agena rocket.\nin 1961 (recording from OSCAR 2, 1962)]]\n*10 July 1962 – Telstar 1, the first satellite to be used commercially, is launched on the first commercially sponsored space launch, aboard a Thor-Delta rocket.\n* 31 August 1962 – President John F.
