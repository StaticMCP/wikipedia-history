It is regarded as one of the first space operas.\nSignificance\nIt is often credited with being the first novel to introduce the concept of galactic empires, interstellar travel and fleets of starships in the thousands locked in combat.\nPlot\nThe British Empire has colonized the nations of Africa, Asia and others on Earth, and in which the 'Anglo-Saxon race' had 'long ago absorbed the whole globe'.\nThe expanding Anglo-Saxon Empire of Earth then clashes with a similar empire based on Kairet, a planet in the Sirius system. Both sides have forgotten spiritual and philosophical values, and are driven by greed. Commercial rivalries escalate into an interstellar war which results in the destruction of most of the Terran fleet and the invasion of Earth.\nFuture technology\nThe novel's technology includes antigravity, interplanetary radio, television, various forms of death ray and industrial transmutation.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://forgottenfutures.co.uk/struggle/struggle.pdf The Struggle For Empire (free PDF)]\n*[https://forgottenfutures.co.uk/struggle/struggle.epub The Struggle For Empire (free ePub)]"
