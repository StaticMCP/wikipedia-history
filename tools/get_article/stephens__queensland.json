      "text": "# Stephens, Queensland\n\nStephens is a former suburb of the City of Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.\nHistory\nStephens was named after the Stephens Swamp, an area of wetlands between Reedy Creek and Burleigh Heads. The swamp, in turn, was named after Thomas Blacket Stephens who purchased 6980 acres of hinterland in 1873 to drain it into Little Tallebudgera Creek to create land for dairy farming.\nIn the 1980s, Stephens began to develop a suburban character.\nBond University was established in Stephens in 1987 when the Parliament of Queensland granted it university status via the passage of the Bond University Act. The University commenced teaching in May 1989 with an initial intake of 322 students.\nIn 2002, Stephens was merged with Andrews and a portion of Robina, to form the new suburb of Varsity Lakes and the West Burleigh part of Burleigh Heads. Stephens is no longer an official placename.\nSee also\n*Suburbs of the Gold Coast\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
