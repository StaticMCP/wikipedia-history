      "text": "# GMA Dove Award\n\n}}\nA Dove Award is an accolade by the Gospel Music Association (GMA) of the United States to recognize outstanding achievement in the Christian music industry. The awards ceremonies presented annually and have been held in Nashville, Tennessee except in 2011 and 2012 when they were held in Atlanta, Georgia. The ceremonies feature live musical performances and are broadcast on TBN.\nThe awards were established in 1969 and represent a variety of musical styles including rock, pop, hip hop, country, and urban.\nHistory\nat a press conference after the GMA Dove Awards in Nashville, Tennessee, USA, in 2007]]\nThe Dove Awards were originally conceptualized by Gospel singer and songwriter Bill Gaither at a Gospel Music Association board meeting in 1968. The idea of the award being represented by a dove is credited to Gaither and the design for the award itself is credited to gospel singer Les Beasley and designer Bob McConnell. The first GMA Dove Awards were held at the Peabody Hotel in Memphis, Tennessee in October 1969. In 1971, the awards moved to Nashville.\nThe 3rd GMA Dove Awards of 1971 were deemed invalid due to apparent ballot stuffing by the southern gospel group the Blackwood Brothers and that year is still not considered an official awards year by the Gospel Music Association. There were no awards held in 1979 due to a decision by the Gospel Music Association to move the awards from autumn to spring. Every ceremony since then has been held in the spring. The first televised ceremony was the 15th GMA Dove Awards of 1984 which aired on the Christian Broadcasting Network.\nThe awards were held in Nashville until 2011 before being presented at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia in 2012. They returned to Nashville in 2013, and have been held at the Allen Arena on the campus of Lipscomb University since.\nCategories\nat the 2008 Dove Awards]]\nBecause of the large number of award categories (42 in 2012), and the desire to feature several performances by various artists, only the ones with the most popular interest are presented directly at the televised version of the award ceremony.\nGeneral\nThe \"General Field\" includes seven awards which are not restricted by genre:\n* Song of the Year is awarded to the songwriter and the publisher.\n* Dove Award for Songwriter of the Year (since 2015 two awards have been given in this category: one for a songwriter who is an artist, and one who is a non-artist)\n* Male Vocalist of the Year\n* Female Vocalist of the Year\n* Group of the Year\n* Artist of the Year\n* New Artist of the Year\n* Producer of the Year\nOther awards are given for performances in specific genres as well as for other contributions such as artwork and video.

The New York Times later attributed these stricter rules to backlash over the Amy Grant album Behind the Eyes winning the award for Pop/Contemporary album earlier that year, whose lyrics Christianity Today argued were effectively secular in nature. The new standards resulted in complaints by some fans and artists after thirteen entries were disqualified as being too secular in the 1999 Dove Awards. The rules were rescinded afterwards and many groups disqualified by the rulings in 1999 were winners in 2000.\n, the GMA's policy stipulates that eligible music is \"based upon the historically orthodox Christian faith contained in or derived from the Holy Bible or apparently prompted and informed by a Christian world-view\".\nSee also\n* Christian pop culture\n* Gospel Music Association of Canada Covenant Awards\n* List of religion-related awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.gospelmusic.org/ GMA website]"
