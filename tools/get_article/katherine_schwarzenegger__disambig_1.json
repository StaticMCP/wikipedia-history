She is of Irish and German descent through her maternal grandparents, Eunice and Sargent Shriver. She has a younger sister, Christina, two younger brothers, Patrick and Christopher, and a half-brother, Joseph Baena, through her father.\nShe graduated from University of Southern California in 2012.\nCareer\nin 2010]]\nIn 2010, Schwarzenegger wrote a book entitled, ''Rock What You've Got: Secrets to Loving Your Inner and Outer Beauty from Someone Who's Been There and Back''. In it, Schwarzenegger describes her personal journey and encourages other young women to achieve confidence and a positive self-image. She had body image issues, between fourth and seventh grade, but now controls her physical and mental health with walking exercises and yoga.\nAfter graduating from college in 2012, Schwarzenegger sought career advice from a variety of people, including athletes, singers, entrepreneurs, and actors.  She compiled their wisdom into her second book— I Just Graduated . . . Now What?—which was released in 2014 as a \"survival guide\" for recent college grads.\nIn 2017, Schwarzenegger authored a children's book, Maverick and Me.  The book tells the story of her rescue and subsequent adoption of her dog, Maverick.  Using her own experience as a \"foster fail\" (when a foster home turns into a \"furever\" home), the book touts the benefits of pet adoption and rescue. In 2019, she partnered up with Pedigree to host a limited-series podcast discussing the importance of adopting dogs.\nThe Gift of Forgiveness: Inspiring Stories from Those Who Have Overcome the Unforgivable is Schwarzenegger's latest book, which is a compilation of stories of forgiveness. The book features the stories of 22 people including Elizabeth Smart and Tanya Brown (sister of Nicole Brown-Simpson).\nPersonal life\nSchwarzenegger started dating actor Chris Pratt in 2018. They announced their engagement, in January 2019, and married the following June. They have two daughters and a son.\nSchwarzenegger is an American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ambassador and supports the Best Friends Animal Society. She and her husband, Chris Pratt, are also Global Ambassadors for Special Olympics.\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*"
