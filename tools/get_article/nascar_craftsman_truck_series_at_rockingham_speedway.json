Tyler Ankrum is the defending race winner.\nHistory\nOn September 2, 2011, NASCAR announced that Rockingham Speedway would hold a Camping World Truck Series event for the 2012 season. The inaugural race was run on April 15, 2012, and was won by Kasey Kahne.\nbeats Joey Logano to win the 2013 event]]\nIn 2013, Kyle Larson won his first truck series win in his first year but the race became notable because of controversy. Truck series veteran Ron Hornaday Jr. got contact with Kyle Busch Motorsports driver; the rookie Bubba Wallace In a similar fashion to an incident with Kyle Busch at Texas two years prior in the WinStar World Casino 350K. Hornaday tapped Wallace sending him into the fences. Ron Hornaday took responsibility and apologized but claimed that he did not intend to wreck Wallace; NASCAR, the media and fans felt differently when they saw a video that showed Hornaday frowning towards Wallace's truck before the tap. NASCAR black-flagged Hornaday and sent him to the back of the field on the restart, later fined him $25,000 and put him on probation until June 12. The penalties were also controversial because the fans, drivers, and medias wanted Hornaday's penalties harsher since Kyle Busch was parked after the Texas incident. In Hornaday's case, Rockingham is a slower circuit than Texas, where top speeds reached 200 MPH.\nIn 2014, the Truck Series did not return to the track due to financial struggles.\nTrack Enterprises, a short track promoter that promotes numerous regional races owned by Spire Sports + Entertainment, and promotes various ARCA races and the Champion Racing Association, was unable to agree with the Wisconsin State Fair with the Milwaukee Mile to host a race in Milwaukee after hosting from 2023 and 2024. Promoters moved the race to Rockingham after NASCAR's schedule released. It was held during the only off-week for the Cup Series for Easter. Tyler Ankrum won in the race's return.\nPast winners\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Date\n! rowspan=\"2\"|\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Driver\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Team\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Manufacturer\n! colspan=\"2\"|Race Distance\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Race Time\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Average Speed(mph)\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Ref\n|-\n!
