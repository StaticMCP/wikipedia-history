In 1931, Texas and Oklahoma jointly built a new, free span northwest of the existing toll bridge.\nOn July 10, 1931, the Red River Bridge Company obtained an injunction against the Texas Highway Commission (which oversaw the Texas Highway Department, now Texas Department of Transportation), keeping it from opening the new bridge. The company said that the highway commission had promised in July 1930 to buy the old toll bridge for $60,000 (equal to $}} today). In reaction to the injunction, Texas Governor Ross S. Sterling ordered that the new free bridge be barricaded at the Texas end.\nOn July 17, Oklahoma Governor William \"Alfalfa Bill\" Murray ordered the new bridge open by executive order. Murray issued this order on the grounds that the land on both sides of the river belonged to Oklahoma, per the Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819. Murray sent highway crews across the new bridge to destroy the barricades.\nGovernor Sterling sent Adjutant General William Warren Sterling and three Texas Rangers to the new bridge to defend the Texas Highway Department workers enforcing the injunction, and rebuilt the barricade that night. The next day, Oklahoma crews under Governor Murray's order demolished the Oklahoma approach to the toll bridge, rendering that bridge impassable.\nThe Texas State Legislature called a special session on July 23 to pass a bill allowing the Red River Bridge Company to sue the state over the issue, partially in response to meetings in Sherman and Denison, Texas, demanding the free bridge be opened. The next day, Governor Murray declared martial law at the site, enforced by Oklahoma National Guardsmen, and personally appeared at the site, armed with a revolver, hours before a Muskogee, Oklahoma, court issued an injunction prohibiting him from blocking the northern toll bridge approach. Murray directed the guardsmen to allow anyone to cross either bridge.\nMurray discovered on July 27 that the free bridge was in danger of being closed permanently. He expanded the martial-law zone across the river, stationing guardsmen on both free bridge approaches. The injunction against the bridge opening was dissolved and the martial law order rescinded on August 6.\nNews of the dispute made national and international headlines. Adolf Hitler may have believed that the events were evidence of infighting between the American states, weakening the union.\nThe free bridge that was the cause of the dispute was opened on Labor Day, September 7, 1931. It was replaced in 1995, though a portion of the bridge was saved as a historical attraction and relocated to the Colbert City park in Colbert, Oklahoma.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Rusty Williams, The Red River Bridge War: A Texas-Oklahoma Border Battle (Texas A&M University Press, 2016).\nExternal links\n*[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/mgr02 Red River Bridge Controversy – Handbook of Texas Online]\n*[http://www.tshaonline.org/daybyday/07-16-003.html Texas Day by Day – July 13, 1931]\n* Toll Bridge coordinates:\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121024013411/http://www.library.okstate.edu/okmaps/ Oklahoma Digital Maps: Digital Collections of Oklahoma and Indian Territory]"
