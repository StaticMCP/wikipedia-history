The book discusses addressing personal and societal problems through the application of secular concepts such as basic goodness, warriorship, bravery, and egolessness as a means toward the creation of what he calls \"enlightened society\". Shambhala vision is described as a nonreligious approach rooted in meditation and accessible to individuals of any, or no, religion. In Shambhala terms, it is possible, moment by moment, for individuals to establish enlightened society.\nExternal links\n* [https://atlanta.shambhala.org/resources/glossary-terms/ Glossary of Shambhala terms]"
