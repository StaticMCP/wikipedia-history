All the action happens simultaneously in game world and places could be seen from the map or at the ground level. Individual characters can also be seen in larger battles (in which they either survive or die). If the battle is less than 100 units, approximately, it can be watched on ground level. Otherwise it will be only displayed numerically. On ground level characters can  acquire objects and talk with non-player characters (such as Radagast or Tom Bombadil).\nReception\nThe game was reviewed in 1989 in Dragon #147 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \"The Role of Computers\" column. The reviewers gave the game 3 out of 5 stars. Computer Gaming World gave the game a mixed review, noting that, although it faithfully recreates the events of the books, genuine strategy is lacking and the game plays very similarly on subsequent playthroughs. Compute!s review was more positive, only criticizing an anticlimactic ending to \"an otherwise impressive game\" that was \"faithful to the Middle Earth story line\".\nThe Spanish magazine Microhobby valued the game with the following scores: Originality: 80% Graphics: 70% Motion: - Sound: 50% Difficulty: 100% Addiction: 80%\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0005629 War in Middle-earth] at World of Spectrum"
