The first coaster ever built by Custom Coasters International, it uses a single Philadelphia Toboggan Company train with buzz bars. The park's monorail runs through the structure of the ride.\nThe coaster opened on May 16, 1992 under the name Sky Princess. It quickly developed a reputation as a fun, but relatively tame, ride befitting of the park's family oriented nature, while also attracting coaster enthusiasts from around the world, especially those who favored wooden coasters over the more popular metal coasters of the era. As the first coaster by Custom Coasters International, some have argued that the Sky Princess's debut in 1992 marked an important shift towards a trend of innovation and artistry in wooden coasters and a renewed interest in them.\nThe name was changed from Sky Princess to Kingdom Coaster prior to the 2007 season.\nAs of the 2017 season, the minimum  height went from Amber (42\"-47\") level to 46\". Anyone at that height or at the Sapphire (48\"-53\") Level need to go with a responsible rider of the Ruby (54\" and up) level.\nRide experience\nAfter the train leaves the station, the ride makes two turns before riders climb the  lift hill. After the  drop, the ride turns and goes up a bunny hill. It is followed by many bunny hills, a tunnel, and even banked turns. Shortly after, the ride hits the brakes and returns the train back to the station.\nReferences"
