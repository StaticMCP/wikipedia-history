During the Civil War, the house was used as a surgery and lodging for officers after the Retreat from Gettysburg in 1863 by the Confederate Army while they prepared to cross the Potomac River.\nStyle and significance\nThe imposing structure was built in the Federal Style, with Flemish Bond brickwork, massive paired chimneys and parapets crowning the roofline.  The home was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing structure within the Williamsport Historic District in 2001.\nReferences"
