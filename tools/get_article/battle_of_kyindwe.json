The Chin Brotherhood Alliance, aided by the Arakan Army and People's Defence Force, started attacking Myanmar Army positions on December 22, 2023. Initially intending to capture the town by Christmas, constant airstrikes, heavy fire from entrenched junta forces, and ambushes by pro-junta militias impeded rebel efforts. After four months of constant fighting, anti-junta forces completely captured the town.\nReferences"
