Voters chose three representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.\nDelaware voted for the National Republican candidate, Henry Clay, over the Democratic Party candidate, Andrew Jackson. Clay won the state by a narrow margin of 1.98%. This was the first election in which Delaware voted by popular vote for president in a contested election. It had used the congressional district method in the uncontested election of 1788–89, but had since changed to selecting its electors through the state legislature from 1792 to 1828.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1832 United States presidential election in Delaware\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n!  width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | National Republican\n| Henry Clay\n| align=\"right\" | 4,276\n| align=\"right\" | 50.99%\n| align=\"right\" | 3\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic\n| Andrew Jackson (inc.)\n| align=\"right\" | 4,110\n| align=\"right\" | 49.01%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | Totals\n| align=\"right\" | 8,386\n| align=\"right\" | 100.00%\n| align=\"right\" | 3\n|-\n|}\nResults by county\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+1832 United States presidential election in Delaware\n|County\n| colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\" |Henry Clay\nNational Republican\n| colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\" |Andrew Jackson\nDemocratic\n| colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\" |Margin\n|Total votes cast\n|-\n|\n|#\n|%\n|#\n|%\n|#\n|%\n|\n|-\n|Kent\n|1,167\n|53.56%\n|1,012\n|46.44%\n|155\n|7.11%\n|2,179\n|-\n|New Castle\n|1,335\n|43.77%\n|1,715\n|56.23%\n| −380\n| −12.46%\n|3,050\n|-\n|Sussex\n|1,774\n|56.19%\n|1,383\n|43.81%\n|391\n|12.39%\n|3,157\n|-\n|Total:\n|4,276\n|50.99%\n|4,110\n|49.01%\n|166\n|1.98%\n|8,386\n|}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Delaware\nReferences"
