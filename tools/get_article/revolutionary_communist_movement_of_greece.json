Members of the EKKE were arrested in early 1974, tortured and imprisoned. After the fall of the dictatorship, they became active in the student sector, supported the factory trade union movement, while significant activity in the support for strikers, in districts facing emergency problems, etc.\nEKKE participated in the first post-dictatorial elections, collecting 0.03% of the vote. In the following ones in 1977 it took about 0.1%.\nRCP adopted the Chinese Maoist \"three worlds theory\", according to which the number one danger was the USSR. The RCP called for a front against the two superpowers, giving the Communist Party of Greece the role of the Soviet enemy. This policy, its support for the new China's new leadership after Mao's death, and the persecution of his collaborators in the Cultural Revolution, the insistence on projecting the danger of the outbreak of a Greek–Turkish war, and even, and fatigue from intensive activism, created problems in its ranks. Two successive departures of members, in 1979 and 1980, destroyed its potential.\nAlliances\nIn 1999, EKKE joined the Radical Left Front (MERA) political coalition and in 2009 Anticapitalist Left Cooperation for the Overthrow.\nSee also\n* Anticapitalist Left Cooperation for the Overthrow\n* Radical Left Front\n* List of anti-revisionist groups\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
