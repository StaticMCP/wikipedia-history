In the past, Yaksha was the northern (Pechora) end of the portage road connecting Cherdyn in the Kama River basin with the Pechora. A project of building a narrow-gauge railroad in the area to connect the Pechora Basin with that of Kama was considered in the late 19th century, but never acted upon. The 20th century plans for a Pechora–Kama Canal came to nought as well.\nSince 1935, the main office of Pechora-Ilych Nature Reserve has been located in Yaksha.\nSources\n*[http://www.pechora-portal.ru/biblio/pechorabook/ex.html?/biblio/pechorabook/1991pechorabook002.htm Alexander Nikolaevich Shuvalov (Александр Николаевич Шувалов), \"Pechora's White Nights\" (БЕЛЫЕ НОЧИ ПЕЧОРЫ)] (A guidebook).
