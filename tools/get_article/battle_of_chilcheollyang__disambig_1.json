Nearly the entire Korean fleet was destroyed by a Japanese fleet.\nBackground\nPrior to the battle, the previous naval commander Yi Sun-sin had been removed from his post due to a Japanese plot. The less experienced Wŏn Kyun was promoted in Yi's place.\nWŏn Kyun set sail for Busan on 17 August with the entire fleet, some 200 ships.\nBattle\nThe Korean fleet arrived near Busan on 20 August in 1597. As the day was about to end, they met a force of 500 to 1,000 Japanese ships arrayed against them. Wŏn Kyun, leading his first and only naval engagement, ordered a general attack on the enemy armada, but the Japanese fell back, letting the Koreans pursue. After a few back and forth exchanges, with one chasing the other, one retreating, the Japanese turned around one last time, destroying 30 ships and scattering the Korean fleet.\nWŏn's men docked at Gadeokdo and ran ashore to find water where they were ambushed by 3,000 enemy troops under Shimazu Yoshihiro. They lost 400 men and several vessels.\nFrom Gadeok, Wŏn retreated north and west into the strait between Geoje and the island of Chilchon, Chilchonnyang. Wŏn Kyun then retired to his flagship and refused to see anyone. The entire fleet sat in the strait for an entire week.\nThe Japanese commanders convened on 22 August to plan a joint assault on the Koreans. Shimazu Yoshihiro ferried 2,000 of his men to Geoje, where he arrayed them on the northwest coast, overlooking the Korean fleet below.\nOn the night of 28 August, a Japanese fleet of 500 ships moved into the strait and attacked. By dawn, nearly all the Korean ships had been destroyed.\nWŏn Kyun fled to the mainland but could not keep up with his men. He sat down under a pine tree until the Japanese found him. It is assumed that his head was cut off.\nYi Ŏkki also died during the battle after drowning himself.\nAftermath\nPrior to the destruction on 28 August,  shifted 12 ships to an inlet farther down the strait and managed to escape. Pae Sŏl set fire to the camps at Hansando before the Japanese arrived. He then sailed west with the remaining 12 ships, all that was left of the Korean navy.\nCitations\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* 桑田忠親 [Kuwata, Tadachika], ed., 舊參謀本部編纂, [Kyu Sanbo Honbu], 朝鮮の役 [Chousen no Eki]　(日本の戰史 [Nihon no Senshi] Vol.&nbsp;5), 1965.\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
