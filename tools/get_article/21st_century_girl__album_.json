The song was included to the album 21st Century Girl.\nThe Plot and Minerva's addition\nCamarillo is the name of the city in the US state of California. Three miles from Camarillo is Camarillo State Mental Hospital, which opened a disease like schizophrenia. According to eyewitnesses, during the period from 1936 to 1996 in the hospital from the experiments died large number of patients. In the same hospital spent the last years the mother of soloist of the band Brazzaville David Brown. Song is a poetic translation of one of her letters.\nOriginal song, \"Top of the World\" was written by Mikhail Galper (ex Korneev) an Ivan Korolyov in 2006. David Arthur Brown heard this song in summer of 2007 during his visit in Moscow for Siberian tour. He did his remake version in August, and in September, Mikhail made a suggestion to record his voice.\nMusic video\nIn 2007 for the song was filmed video, which was loaded on YouTube by Minerva's profile. The video shows David Brown and Mikhail Korneev in the city of Camarillo dressed in white clothes for the mentally ill. The most attention is paid to the woman, which is dancing on the road and playing with teddy baby in a pram. Also the singers are shown closed in a cage with the woman.\nAt the end of the video the woman walks into the sea and disappears into it.\nThe video was shown on popular TV Channels of United States, Russia and Ukrainian channel M1.\nPersonnel\n* Richie Alvarez&nbsp;– keyboards\n* Paco Jordi&nbsp;– guitars, backing vocals\n* Brady Lynch&nbsp;– bass\n*David Brown&nbsp;– synthesizer, guitar, keyboards, tambourine, vocals, shaker, audio production, cover photo\n*Janet Brown&nbsp;– photography\n*Narcis Coromina&nbsp;– saxophone\n*Maria Pi Sunier De Gispert&nbsp;– vocals\n*Juan Fortea&nbsp;– electric guitar, vocals\n*Rick Hake&nbsp;– synthesizer\n*Ivan Knight&nbsp;– bongos, drums, shaker, hi hat\n*Mikhail Korneev&nbsp;– vocals\n*Erik Radloff&nbsp;– drums\n*Todd Richard&nbsp;– synthesizer, guitar, audio production, hammond B3\n*Marina Sala&nbsp;– accordion, vocals\n*Natauko Sugao&nbsp;– trumpet\n*Naomi Wedman&nbsp;– violin\nReferences"
