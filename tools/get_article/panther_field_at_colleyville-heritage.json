It was also the home of the TCL Colleyville-Grapevine LoneStars in 2004 and later the Colleyville LoneStars in 2007. Due to financial limitations, the LoneStars existed in nearby Euless for the 2005 and 2006 seasons in between stints in Colleyville.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.chhspantherbaseball.com/ Colleyville-Heritage Baseball]"
