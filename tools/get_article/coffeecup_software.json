The name comes from the company's origins in an internet cafe owned by its founder.\nThe company develops software applications for creating, designing, and editing responsive websites and a number of online services for webmasters. The company's third product, CoffeeCup Direct FTP, was the first FTP program to incorporate text editing functionality directly into the interface in a \"split-screen\" fashion.\nIn the spring of 2007, CoffeeCup moved to its new headquarters where it employs just over 10 programmers and designers. In addition to a panel of user-advisers, CoffeeCup has a group of around 8000 “Ambassadors” who are invited to test drive new and existing software programs and report bugs and offer suggestions for improvements.\nCoffeeCup's Software has won the Shareware Industry Award six years running from 1999 to 2004 for the CoffeeCup HTML Editor. Other awards include being ranked #400 in the Interactive 500, 11 CNet Editors Choice Awards, 18 Tucows 5-Star Awards, and ZDNet Best Pick for Web Design Software.\nHistory\nCoffeeCup Software was started in a coffee house called “The Raven & The Sparrow” which was owned by the company's founder, Nicholas Longo. This was the only coffee house that offered free internet access in Corpus Christi, Texas, at the time.\nSince the coffee house already had the www.coffeecup.com domain name, the fledgling software company was named CoffeeCup Software and the first program was named CoffeeCup HTML Editor. Longo posted the program on his website. Eventually, CoffeeCup began charging US$20 for the program. In 1996 Longo decided to put away the espresso machines and devote full-time attention to developing software.\nCoffeeCup offers a core group of programs free to schools. CoffeeCup Software's K&ndash;12 Donation Program allows public schools to request the Educational Software Package (ESP) Free for classroom use to elementary and secondary public schools, and public libraries.\nIntroduction of Mac applications\nStarting at the end of 2011 CoffeeCup began to debut its new line of OS X compatible programs including the Web Editor, Web Form Builder and Web Image Studio. The Web Editor quickly received high reviews for the inclusion of tools such as an interactive preview pane, tag matching, drag-n'-drop coding, and search-based editing. The Web Editor won the About.com Readers Choice Awards in 2012. Responsive apps including Responsive Layout Maker Pro, Responsive Email Designer, and Responsive Site Designer were also introduced for the OS X platform.\nProducts\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.coffeecup.com CoffeeCup Software official site]"
