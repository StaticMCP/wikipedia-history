The nominations were announced on January 21. In line with Razzies tradition, both the nominee announcements and ceremony preceded the corresponding Academy Awards functions by one day.\nThe most nominated films of 2007 were I Know Who Killed Me, I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry and Norbit with eight nominations each. I Know Who Killed Me was the big winner of the evening, receiving seven awards. Eddie Murphy received a Razzie record five personal nominations, all surrounding his work (especially his performance of multiple characters) in Norbit. He ended up winning three awards, one for each character he portrayed. Actress Lindsay Lohan also won two awards for her dual roles in I Know Who Killed Me. The special category introduced this year was Worst Excuse for a Horror Movie.\nWinners and nominees\n, Worst Actor, Worst Supporting Actor, and Worst Supporting Actress winner]]\n, Worst Actress and Worst Screen Couple winner]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
