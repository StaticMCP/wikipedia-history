The operations of U.S. military and government aircraft, including those by agencies such as the CIA, led to several aviation accidents, often caused by mechanical failures, pilot errors, and challenging flying conditions. These events significantly affected US–Japan relations, military policies, and safety protocols.\nUnder the U.S.–Japan Status of Forces Agreement and its Agreed Minutes between Japan and the United States, the Japanese side is not granted investigative authority, and issues such as the inability to properly determine the causes have been pointed out.\nBackground\nAfter World War II the US Air Force set up several bases across Japan, including major sites in Okinawa, Misawa, and Yokota. These locations were strategically chosen during the early stages of the Cold War to serve as key operational points for American military activities in Asia. As the frequency of military flights increased within Japanese airspace, there was a notable uptick in aviation accidents. Factors such as technical faults, pilot errors, and challenging weather conditions, compounded by heavy air traffic near these installations, were common contributors to these incidents.\nProtests\nThe main island of Okinawa comprises only 0.6% of Japan's land mass but hosts approximately 75% of US forces stationed in Japan, occupying about 18% of the island. Protests against the US military presence in Okinawa have been ongoing since the Anpo protest movement in 1960, reflecting deep local opposition. Residents face high unemployment and limited economic growth due to the military's footprint. Major incidents, like the 1995 rape of a 12-year-old girl by US servicemen and the 2016 murder of a local woman, have fueled protests and calls for troop withdrawal. In 2019, a referendum saw over 70% oppose relocating Futenma Air Station to Henoko Bay, but the Japanese government proceeded, citing security needs.\nNotable incidents\n1951 Sunagawa United Air Force B-29 Superfortress crash\nThe  occurred on November 18, 1951, when a B-29 bomber from Yokota Air Base crashed during takeoff in Sunagawa, Hokkaido, Tokyo. The aircraft, carrying bombs, exploded upon impact, causing a fire that destroyed over 100 buildings and killed 15 people, including 10 firefighters. All 11 crew members survived. The explosion caused extensive damage in a 1,000-meter radius and led to the evacuation of nearby residents due to the danger of unexploded ordnance.\nTachikawa air disaster\nOn June 18, 1953 a C-124 Globemaster II crashed shortly after takeoff from Tachikawa Air Base, killing all 129 passengers and crew on board. The accident was attributed to engine failure and improper flap usage, which led to a stall and an unrecoverable dive. This incident was the deadliest military plane crash at the time and remains a significant point of reference in discussions about military aviation safety.\n1959 Okinawa F-100 crash\nThe 1959 Okinawa F-100 crash occurred on June 30, 1959, when a U.S. F-100 fighter jet crashed into Miyamori Elementary School in Ishikawa, Okinawa, killing 18 people, including 11 students, and injuring 210 others. The crash led to protests against U.S. military presence in Okinawa and calls for the return of the islands to Japan.\nCIA Fujisawa Black Jet Incident\nThe CIA Fujisawa Black Jet Incident occurred on September 24, 1959, when a CIA-operated Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft made an emergency landing at Fujisawa Airfield in Fujisawa City, Kanagawa Prefecture. During a public holiday, the unidentified aircraft performed a belly landing, overshot the runway, and came to a halt on grassy terrain. The aircraft had no markings indicating nationality, only the number \"449\". Foreigners in plain clothes arrived shortly after, securing the area with weapons. The pilot was picked up by helicopter and left the scene. The U-2, initially disguised as a weather reconnaissance aircraft, was on a Cold War mission over Eastern Bloc countries.\nJapanese police were blocked from investigating the site, and a photographer's home was searched by U.S. personnel. Major Japanese newspapers initially ignored the incident, with only minor coverage in local papers. The matter gained public attention after being discussed in the Japanese National Diet by Kazuo Asukata of the Japan Socialist Party in December 1959. The aircraft, later identified as Article 360, was operated by the CIA pilot Tom Cruell, who ran out of fuel after being impressed with the aircraft's performance. After repairs, it was redeployed to Incirlik Air Base and was shot down over the Soviet Union in May 1960 during a reconnaissance mission (see 1960 U-2 incident).\n1964 Machida F-8 crash\nThe 1964 Machida F-8 crash occurred on April 5, 1964 in Machida, Tokyo, Japan. A United States Marine Corps RF-8A Crusader crashed into a residential area due to mechanical failure, killing four and injuring 32 on the ground. The pilot ejected safely.\n1968 Kyushu University Computer Center McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II crash\nThe  occurred on June 2, 1968, when an RF-4C Phantom reconnaissance aircraft of the United States Air Force crashed into the under-construction Large Computer Center at Kyushu University in Fukuoka City, Fukuoka Prefecture. The crash destroyed the building's fifth and sixth floors and caused a fire. As it was a Sunday and no construction was underway, the two pilots ejected safely, and there were no casualties.\nThe unit to which the crashed Phantom belonged was deployed to South Korea after the Pueblo Incident and later moved to Itazuke Air Base. Following the crash, Kyushu University's President, Takaki Mizuno, issued a protest against the U.S. military and the Japanese government. This led to widespread protests by students and faculty. The U.S. military agreed to restrict night flights and adjust flight paths to avoid flying over the university until the cause of the crash was determined.\nFurther negotiations between the US and Japan considered the relocation of Itazuke Air Base. Within the university, there was debate over the wreckage; some wanted to remove it, while others wanted to retain it as a symbol of the anti-war movement. The wreckage was forcibly pulled down by unknown individuals in January 1969, leading to further unrest. President Mizuno resigned following the incident.\nThe incident heightened student activism, resulting in strikes and building barricades. In 1969, the Provisional Measures Law on University Management was enacted to address such unrest. The Large Computer Center's construction resumed in late 1969 and was completed in 1970.\nThe airbase was returned to Japan in 1972, becoming Fukuoka Airport. Due to concerns about safety, noise, and space limitations, Kyushu University decided to relocate to the Ito Campus. The Large Computer Center was reorganized in 2004 and moved to the new campus in 2016. The old facilities in the Hakozaki area were demolished in 2018.\n1968 Kadena Air Base B-52 crash\nOn November 19, 1968 a United States Air Force B-52D Stratofortress crashed at Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, Japan, during an aborted takeoff for an Operation Arc Light bombing mission to South Vietnam. The aircraft, carrying a full bomb load, broke apart and caught fire, leading to an explosion that created a crater 30 ft deep and 60 ft across. The blast damaged 139 houses and blew out windows 23 miles away. Two crew members and two Okinawan workers were killed. The incident intensified local opposition to U.S. military presence and nuclear storage in Okinawa.\n1977 Yokohama F-4 crash\nThe 1977 Yokohama F-4 crash was a military aviation accident that occurred on September 27, 1977, in Yokohama, Japan. A United States Marine Corps RF-4B Phantom II, a reconnaissance variant of the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, suffered a mechanical malfunction while en route from Naval Air Facility Atsugi to the USS Midway in Sagami Bay. The aircraft's port engine caught fire, causing it to crash into a residential area near present-day Eda Station (Kanagawa). The crash killed two young boys, aged 1 and 3, and injured seven others on the ground, several seriously. The boys' mother, Kazue Doshida, suffered severe burns and died in 1982 from complications related to her injuries. The aircraft's crew, Capt. J. E. Miller and 1st Lt. D. R. Durbin, successfully ejected and were not seriously injured.\nIn the aftermath, nine civilians were injured by the ensuing fire. The crash and its impact led to significant public outcry and was remembered as a tragic event in the history of Japan–United States relations. A statue was erected in a Yokohama park in 1985 to commemorate Doshida and her sons. In 1984, Toei Animation produced an anime titled Papa Mama Bye bye depicting the lives of the two young victims before the crash. The incident is a notable example of the risks associated with military aviation accidents in civilian areas.\n1988 Sadamaki Sikorsky CH-53 crash\nOn June 25, 1988, a United States Marine Corps CH-53 helicopter crashed on the Sadamisaki Peninsula in Ehime Prefecture, Japan. The helicopter was en route from Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni to Marine Corps Air Station Futenma. All seven crew members on board, affiliated with the Marine Corps Air Station Tustin, were killed in the accident. The crash occurred about 800 meters from the Ikata Nuclear Power Plant, raising concerns as it was believed the plant might have been a training target. Access to the crash site was restricted based on the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan and the Status of forces agreement.\nOkinawa International University U.S. military helicopter crash\nThe  occurred on August 13, 2004, when a United States Marine Corps Sikorsky CH-53D helicopter from Marine Corps Air Station Futenma lost control during a training flight and crashed into the grounds of Okinawa International University in Ginowan City, Okinawa Prefecture. The helicopter collided with Building No.1 and caught fire, causing injuries to all three crew members aboard but no casualties among the university staff or civilians. The crash site was cordoned off by the U.S. military, preventing Japanese authorities from accessing it, which led to criticism of the U.S.–Japan Status of Forces Agreement and concerns about sovereignty and investigative rights. The incident also caused suspicion of radioactive contamination due to the presence of Strontium-90 in the helicopter's rotor blades.\nA joint Japan-U.S. investigation concluded that the crash was caused by a maintenance error; a crucial pin was not installed on a bolt securing the rotor mechanism, leading to the loss of control. Following the incident, local protests highlighted grievances about the U.S. military presence in Okinawa, culminating in a rally attended by 30,000 people. Despite extensive investigations, the full details of the accident remained unclear due to jurisdictional challenges posed by the Status of Forces Agreement, and no charges were filed against the U.S. crew members involved. In response to the incident, guidelines on crash response outside military bases were revised in 2019 to allow Japanese authorities quicker access to U.S. military aircraft crash sites.\nOther incidents\n1950 United Air Force Iwakuni City B26 bomber crash\nwas an aviation accident that occurred on September 27, 1950, when a US Air Force B-26 Invader crashed near the Kintai Bridge in Iwakuni, Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan. The aircraft, having taken off from Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, crashed into a residential area, killing one crew member and three local residents, and injuring five others. The crash occurred shortly after the Korean War began. Press coverage of the incident was minimal, overshadowed by reports on the reconstruction of the Kintai Bridge, which had been damaged by Typhoon Kezia earlier that month. No apologies or compensation were offered by the occupying forces to the victims' families; the prefectural government provided a small amount of condolence money.\n1952 Habomai Islands RB-29 shootdown incident\nThe 1952 Habomai Islands RB-29 shootdown incident occurred on October 7, 1952, when a US Air Force RB-29 reconnaissance aircraft was shot down by Soviet fighters near the Habomai Islands, east of Hokkaido, Japan. All eight crew members were killed. The aircraft, part of the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron, was on an intelligence mission. The incident highlighted Cold War tensions and the risks of aerial reconnaissance operations between the US and the Soviet Union.\n1956 United Air Force North American FJ-2 Fury crash\nThe Shinkoiwa Station Front U.S. Military Aircraft Crash Incident occurred on February 3, 1956, when a U.S. FJ-2 fighter jet, part of a three-aircraft group from Atsugi Air Base, crashed near Shinkoiwa Station, Tokyo. The aircraft was conducting unauthorized training over urban areas, violating the agreement prohibiting U.S. military flights over Japanese cities. The jet suffered an engine failure at 30,000 feet during a sharp turn, entered a tailspin, and crashed into a densely populated residential area, causing an explosion and fire that damaged five houses and injured several civilians. Japanese fire brigades struggled to extinguish the fire, which was fueled by jet fuel, requiring additional chemical fire trucks. The U.S. military was slow to respond and initially refused to release the pilot's name, stating that the next of kin needed to be informed first. The frequent crashes of U.S. aircraft in Japan were attributed to the transition from propeller to jet aircraft and short runways. Japanese police and media demanded more transparency from the U.S. military, reflecting growing public concern over the repeated accidents.\n1957 United Air Force Ryan Navion accident\nThe 1957 United Air Force Ryan Navion accident occurred on February 3, 1956, when a U.S. FJ-2 fighter jet crashed near Shinkoiwa Station, Tokyo, during unauthorized training over urban areas. Three FJ-2 jets from Atsugi Air Base flew over densely populated regions, ignoring regulations set by the Japanese government and USFJ that prohibited flight training over cities. Around 11:00&nbsp;am, one jet experienced engine failure during a sharp turn at 30,000 feet, entered a tailspin, and crashed into a residential area in Katsushika, igniting a large fire that destroyed five houses and injured several civilians, including a woman who suffered a broken leg and others with burns. Despite the efforts of multiple fire brigades, the fire was only extinguished after several hours. The U.S. military was slow to respond, and initially withheld the pilot's name. Repeated accidents were attributed to the transition from propeller to jet aircraft. Japanese police and media demanded transparency from the US military.\n1964 United Air Force Kamikusayanagi F-8 Crusader crash\nThe 1964 United Air Force Kamikusayanagi F-8 Crusader crash was an aviation accident on September 8, 1964, involving a Vought F-8 Crusader from the U.S. Navy's Bon Homme Richard. The aircraft stalled shortly after takeoff from Atsugi Base due to engine failure and crashed into Kamikusayagi, Yamato, Kanagawa Prefecture, destroying the Tateno Ironworks and causing an explosion after igniting acetylene gas. Five people died (three instantly, two later in the hospital), three were injured, and surrounding houses were damaged. The pilot ejected safely. The aircraft's debris spread over nearby fields and homes.\nEarlier that day an F-105 from the U.S. Air Force had crashed in the Sagami River, killing two. In 1964 there were eight U.S. military aircraft accidents in Kanagawa. The crash site later became state-owned, and a memorial was erected in 1999. In 2014, a new monument was built.\nLitigation ensued when a bereaved father, who lost three sons, filed a lawsuit after a promised land sale was denied. The case settled in 1982 for 12 million yen without resolving the land sale issue.\n2023–2024 United Air Force V-22 Osprey crashes\nThe 2023–2024 United Air Force V-22 Osprey crashes include several significant incidents involving the US Air Force CV-22 Osprey aircraft, primarily during training missions. The most notable of these crashes occurred on November 29, 2023, off the coast of Yakushima, Japan, when a CV-22 from the 21st Special Operations Squadron crashed during a joint interoperability exercise. The crash resulted in the deaths of all eight airmen on board. Investigations revealed that the crash was due to a catastrophic failure in the left-hand prop rotor gearbox, causing an unrecoverable loss of control. Following this incident, the U.S. military grounded its entire fleet of V-22 Ospreys, and Japan also temporarily grounded its Osprey fleet as a precaution. Another incident occurred earlier, in August 2023, when an MV-22 Osprey assigned to the United States Marine Corps crashed during a training exercise in Australia, killing three Marines. The cause of this crash remains under investigation, but preliminary reports suggest possible pilot error and challenging flight conditions contributed to the accident.\nAdditionally, on September 14, 2023, two Marine V-22 Ospreys in Japan had to divert within hours of each other due to \"cockpit caution indications\" while flying near where the Air Force Osprey later crashed. These incidents prompted further scrutiny and contributed to the decision to ground the fleet temporarily.\nThe crashes led to a comprehensive review and investigation by the U.S. military and other agencies, including the Government Accountability Office (GAO), into the safety record of the V-22 Osprey fleet. The GAO is examining trends among the aircraft's multiple accidents, maintenance issues, and risk management practices across the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps fleets.\nImpact on US–Japanese diplomatic relations\nThe Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) between the US and Japan, which outlines the legal status of US military personnel in Japan,\nJapan has paid about 70.4&nbsp;billion yen in compensation for noise pollution caused by U.S. military aircraft, which was the subject of multiple lawsuits from Japanese residents. Under the Japan-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), the U.S. government is supposed to cover 75% of the compensation for accidents or crimes caused by U.S. personnel on duty, while Japan covers the remaining 25%. However, in this case, Japan ended up paying the full amount, including what the U.S. was expected to cover.\nFor instance, Japanese police are generally restricted from accessing U.S. military bases to investigate accidents or crimes unless under specific conditions. This arrangement has been criticized as being unfair, particularly following high-profile accidents and crimes involving U.S. military, particularly in Okinawa.\nIn response to these issues, both governments have worked on enhancing guidelines to improve responses to U.S. military aircraft accidents, including better coordination between U.S. and Japanese officials and more streamlined processes for handling accidents.\nChanges in military policy and safety guidelines\nIn response to these accidents, the US military has implemented several changes to improve safety protocols and reduce the likelihood of future incidents. These measures include stricter maintenance schedules, enhanced pilot training programs, and more rigorous flight safety checks. Additionally, there have been efforts to improve communication and cooperation with Japanese authorities to ensure prompt and effective responses to any future accidents. Revisions to the guidelines for responding to off-base aircraft accidents were agreed upon by both the U.S. and Japanese governments. These revisions aim to clarify roles, enhance information sharing, and ensure faster and more coordinated responses to accidents.\nSee also\n* List of accidents and incidents involving military aircraft\n* United States Forces Japan\n* U.S.-Japan Status of Forces Agreement\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.safety.af.mil/ US Air Force Safety Center]\n* [https://www.mod.go.jp/ Ministry of Defense Japan]"
