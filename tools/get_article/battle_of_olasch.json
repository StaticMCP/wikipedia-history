On 26 August 1696, after learning that Sultan Mustafa II's relief army was crossing the Danube at Pancsova, Augustus gave up the siege and headed to meet the Ottoman army. The battle near the Bega River resulted in a draw after both armies retreated with heavy casualties on both sides. Strategically, the Ottoman army's campaign can be considered a success, as it achieved its goal of retaining Temesvár.\nBattle\nThe battle of Olasch started late in the day, around five in the evening. During the battle, the left-wing of the Imperial army took heavy casualties, in contrast to the centre and the right-wing that had the better of the action. At night the fighting stopped and the next day both armies withdrew from the battlefield. The Imperial commander Heissler of Heitersheim was wounded or died days later after the battle. 3,000 Habsburg soldiers killed or wounded. The Turks lost 4,000 men.\nAftermath\nThe battle ended in a tactical draw, however, after Augustus is compelled to lift the siege of Temesvár, the Sultan claimed victory and was thus able to achieve operational success. According to historian Tony Sharp it is hard to come up with any other result for the battle than a scoredraw,}} British historian Robert William Seton-Watson called it an \"indecisive battle\", while according to the Encyclopædia Metropolitana, the encyclopedic work published from 1817 to 1845, \"the Turks claimed the victory though no decided advantage accrued to either side\".\nThe imperial army took over the Bega and united with the separate corps at Titel. As early as the autumn of 1696, Augustus resigned from his position and went home to obtain the royal throne of Poland after the death of John Sobieski. The same year, Emperor Leopold appointed the brilliant young military strategist Prince Eugene of Savoy, who had returned from the Rhine front, as the new commander-in-chief. On 11 September 1697, a greatly outnumbered Imperial army led by Prince Eugene faced the Turks at Zenta on the Tisza which resulted in the Ottoman Empire's greatest defeats.\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
