Dating back to 1654, it is the oldest continually serving coffee house in Europe, but it has only been on the present site (Oxford, England) since 1970. The building in which it operates is a Grade II listed building. It was in this coffee house where Jeremy Bentham discovered Utilitarianism.\nIn 2009, it rebranded itself as \"QL\". There is a second, smaller, QL Café. Another Café QL (now called Café Bonjour) in Headington was once owned by the same family but was sold years ago.\nThe café has been owned by the same family since 1983.\nSee also\n* English coffeehouses in the 17th and 18th centuries\n* History of coffee\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.qlcoffeehouse.com/ Official website]\n* [http://www.dailyinfo.co.uk/reviews/venue/321/Queens+Lane+Coffee+House/ Queen's Lane Coffee House] information from Daily Information\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061127163254/http://www.oxfordcityguide.com/Eat/ByCuisine.html Queen's Lane Coffee House] information from OxfordCityGuide.com\n* [http://oxford.openguides.org/wiki/?Queen's_Lane_Coffee_House Queen's Lane Coffee House] information from The Oxford Guide"
