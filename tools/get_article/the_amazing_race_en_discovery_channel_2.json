It featured eleven teams of two, with a pre-existing relationship, in a race across Latin America to win US$250,000.\nThe second season premiered on Sunday 26 September 2010 at 11.00 p.m. (UTC−3).\nThis was the final season that aired on Discovery Latin America.\nMexican brothers Mauricio and Carlos Coarasa were the winners of this season.\nProduction\nDevelopment and filming\nin Tikal, Guatemala.]]\nDiscovery Channel greenlit the second installment in November 2009. Race locations were scouted in January 2010 and filming took place between May and June 2010. The show was broadcast in high-definition television.\nFilming for the second season of The Amazing Race en Discovery Channel lasted for 25 days and covered nearly . The second season spanned eight countries in two continents. Among them, four were unvisited countries, including Bolivia and Ecuador. The season also included the first visits for an Amazing Race franchise to Guatemala and Venezuela, both of which have not been visited by the original American version. Previously visited countries were Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina. Colombia was also visited this season and was a country that had not been visited by the original American version at the time of air, until Season 28 in 2016.\nLeg 4 marked the first leg in the franchise to feature a variation of the \"Intersection\" marker, where teams competed against each other one-on-one in a specific task, and the winning team received their next clue while the other team was required to wait for another team before they could start the task over. If the team lost the final match, the team would incur a pre-determined time penalty (15 minutes) before receiving their next clue and could continue racing. This variation would later be renamed to \"Double Battle\", \"Versus\", \"Face Off\", \"Duel\" or \"Head-to-Head\" in other versions (the latter would be first officiated in the 30th season of the original American version in 2018).\nThe route markers in this season were coloured blue and black, including the clue envelopes and the Pit Stop. Starting from the following season, the route markers would adopt the original red and yellow scheme format.\nNone of the eliminated teams were present at the Finish Line.\nCasting\nApplications were accepted from 13 December 2009 and finished on 8 February 2010. Semi-finalist interviews were held sometime in March 2010 and the final casting interviews took place around April 2010.\nMarketing\nAccording to Discovery's official website, the four official sponsors of the second season of The Amazing Race en Discovery Channel were Bridgestone, Nintendo, Samsung and Visa.
