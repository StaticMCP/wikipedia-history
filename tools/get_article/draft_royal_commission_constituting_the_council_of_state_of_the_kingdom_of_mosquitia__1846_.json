Though not a constitution in the liberal-democratic sense, the Royal Commission functioned as a constitutional instrument of monarchical and executive authority, defining the structure, powers, and membership of the state’s central government during the monarch’s minority.\nBackground\nUpon the death of King Robert Charles Frederic in 1842, governance of the Kingdom of Mosquitia passed into the hands of a regency, to govern on behalf of his young son and successor, George Augustus Frederic. This regency was based on a Testamentary Deed executed in 1840, but by 1846, it was widely regarded as legally deficient: the deed lacked proper attestation, omitted the names of the appointed commissioners, and had become a source of confusion.\nIn light of these deficiencies, King George Augustus, with the support of his advisers and leading local figures, issued a Royal Commission to abolish the regency and constitute a new national government (Supreme Local Government) for the Kingdom of Mosquitia. This new authority was to be exercised through a designated Council of State, appointed by the King and tasked with overseeing the administration of the kingdom.\nProclamation and Ceremony\nThe new government was proclaimed on 10 September 1846 at the Court House in Bluefields, the Mosquitian capital. In a formal public ceremony attended by civil and military officers, magistrates, and prominent citizens, the King delivered a speech from the throne.\nIn this proclamation, the King declared:\n“It being necessary for the welfare of our Kingdom that a Supreme Local Government be established therein, and to that end, that a Council of State be appointed…”\nHe further noted that the Testamentary Deed of 1840 was “deficient and informal” and had therefore been abolished. In its place, the new Supreme Local Government would serve as the central executive authority, empowered to act in the monarch’s name.\nStructure of the Government\nThe Supreme Local Government of the Kingdom of Mosquitia was composed of a Council of State, structured into two classes:\nHonorary Members\n(Life Appointment)\nAppointed in recognition of distinguished service and loyalty:\n* Colonel Alexander Macdonald, Royal Horse Artillery\n* Rev. Matthew Newport, Rector of St. John’s, Belize\n* Colonel Thomas Fox Strangways, Royal Horse Artillery\n* Major William Hodgson Cadogan, of Northumberland\n* William Barron, Esq., of London\nCouncillors of State\n(Annual Appointment)\nAppointed for one-year terms with administrative authority:\n* James Stanislaus Bell, Esq.\n* George Hodgson, Senior\n* Alexander Hodgson\n* William Halstead Ingram\n* James Porter\n* John Dixon\n* James Green, Surgeon and U.S. Consul\nThese individuals served as the primary executive officials of the Supreme Local Government, exercising powers in the name of the King and under his authority.\nLegal Character of the Document\nThough sometimes referred to as a “constitution,” the 1846 document is more accurately described as a Royal Commission — a formal act of state by which a monarch establishes or empowers an institution. In this case, the commission created both the Supreme Local Government (the official executive authority) and the Council of State (its governing organ).\nSuch instruments were common within British protectorates and colonial contexts, where formal constitutions were rare, but government functions were institutionalized by royal or gubernatorial decrees.\nBy capitalizing and defining both “Supreme Local Government” and “Council of State” as official names, the document confirmed their legal and administrative standing as the national government and its executive body, respectively.\nPolitical and Diplomatic Significance\nThe creation of the Supreme Local Government and its Council of State marked a major step in the institutional development of the Kingdom of Mosquitia. It:\n* Replaced informal regency arrangements with a legally defined governing authority.\n* Affirmed the kingdom’s sovereign administration, distinct from surrounding Central American republics.\n* Reinforced the kingdom’s protectorate relationship with Great Britain, with several British officers and clergy named as Honorary Members.\n* Laid the constitutional foundation for subsequent reforms, such as the 1861 Municipal Constitution of the Mosquito Reservation, adopted under the Treaty of Managua.\nThe act also demonstrated the kingdom’s effort to present itself as a law-abiding, administratively modern state, capable of managing internal affairs and entering into diplomatic relations.\nLegacy\nThe 1846 Royal Commission remains a key milestone in the legal and constitutional history of the Kingdom of Mosquitia. It represents one of the earliest examples of formal statecraft and executive organization by an indigenous monarchy in Central America, guided by both local sovereignty and British political models.\nThe Supreme Local Government of the Kingdom of Mosquitia, with its Council of State, thus stands as an early and unique case of hybrid governance — blending monarchical authority, indigenous leadership, and imperial administration.\nReferences"
