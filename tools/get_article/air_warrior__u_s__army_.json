It leverages and integrates clothing and equipment, such as the Army Aircrew Combat Uniform, and ballistic protection from other product managers. As of April 2020, more than 18,000 AW systems had been used in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.\nComponents\nElectronic Data Manager\nThe Spiral 3.5 Electronic Data Manager (EDM) is a light, rugged, sunlight-readable touch-screen computer operating on Windows-based software. The EDM is in the form of a kneeboard and provides the aviator with an Aviation Mission Planning System interface, enhanced situational awareness, and GPS moving map capabilities. It also enables the aircrew to plan and execute missions, and react to mission changes in-flight.  More than 2,200 Spiral 3.5 EDMS have been fielded.\nPortable Helicopter Oxygen Delivery System\nThe Portable Helicopter Oxygen Delivery System (PHODS) is a lightweight breathing oxygen product worn by the aircrew that provides supplemental oxygen to soldiers without restricting their movements. An automatic regulator dispenses oxygen via nasal cannula in the correct amount and rate based on altitude and the individual’s breathing rate. It replaces the Helicopter Oxygen System, which weighed over 100 pounds, tethered the user to the aircraft, and could not be fitted on all Army rotary wing aircraft. Over 1,700 systems have been as of mid-2010.\nAircraft Wireless Intercom System(AWIS)\nThe Aircraft Wireless Intercom System (AWIS) provides hands-free, cordless communication between aircrew members. The system has a full duplex voice-activated mode, hands-free mode, and a push-to-talk mode. It features fifty independent channels/aircraft networks with up to six crew members on each aircraft network. AWIS enables simultaneous omnidirectional communications among all users in the aircraft network within 200 feet of the center of the aircraft and provides the first true intercom capability between the entire aircraft crew, hoist operators, and rescue personnel on the hoist. Over 130 systems are fielded as of mid-2010 and an encryption capability will be added in Fiscal Year 2011.\nHistory\nIncrement III\nAW Increment III includes:\n* Electronic Data Manager, a portable digital mission planning device for over-the-horizon messaging and enhanced situational awareness capabilities through connectivity to Blue Force Tracking-Aviation\n* Aircraft Wireless Intercom System for secure cordless, hands-free aircrew communications\n* Survival Kit, Ready Access, Modular (SKRAM)\n* Go Bag with integrated hydration\n* Portable Helicopter Oxygen Delivery System, a Soldier-worn supplemental breathing oxygen system for high-altitude operations\n* Communication Enhancement and Protection System (CEPS), providing helmet hear-through capability\nSuccessor\nBuilding on the legacy Air Warrior gear carriage and clothing system, the Air Soldier System (Air SS) Increment 1a initiative focuses on improving aircrew survivability, comfort, and efficiency by reducing weight and torso bulk, improving head and laser eye protection, and increasing rear crew member mobility.\nThe Air SS Increment 1a will feature optimized survival equipment (72-hour requirement) and a pocket system that eliminates unnecessary items. It also will include standardized survival gear components. It will reduce the bulk and weight of the legacy Air Warrior body armor system. As part of the AS Increment 1a, the Modular Aircrew Common Helmet (MACH) or an improved legacy HGU-56/P helmet will offer a 15 to 50 percent improvement in head impact protection. Advances in laser eye protection (from 3 to 5 fixed wavelengths) are also included in the initiative.\nThe Wearable Environmental Control System (WECS), powered by an Integrated Portable Power Source, will eliminate the cooling system umbilical for nonrated crew members. The AS Increment 1a will also feature enhanced SA/C3 capabilities to achieve JBC-P interoperability. Initial implementation of terrain/obstacle avoidance capability will be through the AW Electronic Data Manager.\nContract award for AS Increment 1a is expected in 2011.\nMicroclimate Cooling System\nThe Microclimate Cooling System (MCS) gives Army aircrews an increase of over 350 percent mission endurance (from 1.6 hours to 5.7 hours), while wearing chemical protective equipment or in other heat stress mission environments. The system features a vest and aircraft-mounted cooling unit that pumps chilled water via an umbilical to small tubes embedded in the vest.\nBecause of its success as part of the Air Warrior ensemble, the MCS were also being used by crews in ground vehicle platforms in Operation Iraqi Freedom, including Stryker, Abrams, and Bradley.\nSee also\n* Land Warrior\n* Future Force Warrior\nReferences\nThis article incorporates work from https://web.archive.org/web/20110719162954/https://peosoldier.army.mil/newpeo/Folio2010/PMSW/PM_CSW/XM205.xml, which is in the public domain as it is a work of the United States Military."
