C. Penney Co. Warehouse Building, formerly also known as Edison Brothers Warehouse Building, and now Edison Condominiums, is a historic warehouse building in downtown St. Louis, Missouri.  The building now serves as a condo-hotel.\nHistory\nThe building was constructed in 1929 as a warehouse for the J.C. Penney retail chain. It occupied the building until 1954, after which it was donated to the University of Missouri as a location for an education center, which never materialized. In 1967, the university leased the warehouse to Edison Brothers Stores, which used it as a warehouse for its retail operations until 1994. In 1983, the company commissioned muralist Richard Haas to paint a ''trompe-l'œil'' mural on three sides of the building that mimicked architectural stonework, using themes derived from the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair.\nThe building reopened in 2001 after a $54 million renovation as a combination of condominiums and the Sheraton St. Louis City Center hotel. The hotel left Sheraton in 2014 and was unbranded until 2018, when it became a Red Lion Hotel. It closed in 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and reopened in 2022 as an OYO Hotel. It is set to be renovated, at a cost of $46 million, and will regain its Sheraton flag.\nReferences\n*[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMB07 \"J. C. Penney Co.
