It was written by Bob Parkin.\nGameplay\nJust Another War in Space is a one-player strategic tactical game of space combat, in which the player can either ally with the Empire or the Federation.\nReception\nHosea Battles, Jr. reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \"this is an excellent tactical level combat game with a few strategic decisions (sort of an \"opposite twin brother\" to Star Control). It will appeal to those who like strategic wargaming with plenty of on-screen action.\"\nGreg Knauss for STart said that \"With a GEM front-end, I would easily recommend it to anyone looking for detailed space combat, but as it is, only the dedicated are likely to want to take the time.\"\nReferences\n}}"
