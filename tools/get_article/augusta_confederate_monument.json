Our Confederate Dead.” The monument is seventy-six feet high on a granite base, topped by a shaft of Carrara marble. The monument was commissioned in 1875 by the Ladies Memorial Association of Augusta. It was designed by the architectural firm of VanGruder and Young of Philadelphia, built by the Markwalter firm of Augusta, carved by Antonio Fontana, and dedicated on October 31, 1878.\nAround the base of the monument are the life size statues of four Southern generals in the American Civil War: Thomas R.
