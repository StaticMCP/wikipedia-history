There are 30 award categories, ranging from Best New Artist to Best Musical Producer. The winners of the awards are determined by a combination of an online vote on Bolivia Music's webpage and an evaluation by a panel of music industry experts from within Bolivia and from abroad. The 2023 ceremony took place at the Hard Rock Cafe in Santa Cruz de la Sierra.\nCategories\nThe Bolivia Music Awards originally had 22 categories.

The denunciation had various reactions, and opened a conversation about the transparency and the event's recognition criteria.\nAfter the denunciation, Luis Vega, who had won 11 previous awards, announced that he would no longer attend future awards in Bolivia, pointing out the need for more transparency and for recognition based on verifiable merit. Later, Lu de la Tower, another award-winner, also expressed her disagreement with the existence of fees to emerging artists, and communicated her disengagement with the organisation, affirming that during her previous experiences, she was never subjected to these types of requests.\nAmidst this public backlash, Diego Alba, the event's founder, clarified that the payments corresponded to optional participation packets, and were not a requirement to receive the award.\nLuis Vega later clarified that his critiques were not directed at a specific event and expressed respect to Diego Alba's work. He announced that his team would sponsor the Bolivia Music Awards and proposed a system of voting based on professionals in the field of music.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
