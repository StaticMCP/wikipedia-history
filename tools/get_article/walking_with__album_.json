It was released on October 1, 2014 by the artist's label Music Farm and distributed by LOEN Entertainment. Guitarist Lee Sang-soon (who has also been known as Lee Hyori's husband) and Superstar K2 runner-up John Park participated on the album as featured artists. The album is the singer's first solo release since the holiday album KimdongrYULE (2011), and also his first studio album since Monologue (2008).\nThe self-produced album features ten tracks in total, including the lead single \"How I Am\" and the track under the same title. Without any televised promotions, \"How I Am\" topped the Gaon Singles Chart for two consecutive weeks. The song also won Song of the Year at the 4th annual Gaon Chart K-Pop Awards.\nAn LP edition of the album, limited to 3,000 copies, was available for sale. As of  , Walking With has sold over 58,000 physical albums and three million digital singles in South Korea (see Chart performance).\nSingles\n\"How I Am\"\n\"How I Am\" () is the lead single from the album. The song depicts a man who misses his past lover, and actor Gong Yoo starred in its corresponding music video. After filming the music video, Gong stated \"I can't forget the memories when I listened to the music of Exhibition () using cassette tapes in my school years. Kim has been my favorite musician since then. I wanted to celebrate by starring in the music video, in my mind to cheer the 20th anniversary of his debut.\" The music video was released on October 1, 2014, via LOEN Entertainment's official YouTube channel.\nUpon its release, \"How I Am\" achieved an \"all-kill\" status in South Korea, reaching the pole position on all of the real-time music charts including MelOn, Bugs, Soribada, Genie, Mnet Music, Monkey3, Olleh Music, Cyworld Music, Daum Music, and Naver Music. Without any broadcast promotions, the song topped the Gaon Singles Chart for two consecutive weeks. It also won the first place on televised K-pop music shows like The Music Trend (SBS) and Music Bank (KBS), from October 12 to 17, 2014. This was Kim's first feat since he received a trophy for \"Should I Tell You Again That I Love You?\" () on MBC's Music Camp (currently Show! Music Core) in January 2002.\n\"How I Am\" was the 51st biggest selling digital song of 2014 in South Korea. Since its release, the song has sold about 900,000 digital copies domestically.\nPromotion\nInstead of having broadcast promotions, it was announced that Kim would hold his nationwide concert tour from November 1, 2014. Starting in Busan, he performed in cities including Seongnam, Gwangju, Goyang, Jeonju, Seoul, Daegu, and Daejeon until January 3, 2015, to promote his comeback album.\nTrack listing\nAll songs written and composed by Kim Dong-ryool.\n| title1           = Confession\n| note1            = 고백; Gobaek\n| length1          = 4:25\n| title2           = Those Days\n| note2            = 청춘; Cheongchoon, featuring Lee Sang-soon\n| length2          = 4:25\n| title3           = My Very Own\n| note3            = 내 사람; Nae Saram\n| length3          = 4:28\n| title4           = Advice\n| note4            = featuring John Park\n| length4          = 3:32\n| title5           = How I Am\n| note5            = 그게 나야; Geuge Naya\n| length5          = 4:44\n| title6           = Puzzle\n| note6            = 퍼즐; Peojeul\n| length6          = 4:28\n| title7           = Where My Heart Is\n| note7            = 내 마음은; Nae Maeumeun\n| length7          = 4:39\n| title8           = Today\n| note8            = 오늘; Oneul\n| length8          = 3:30\n| title9           = That Song\n| note9            = 그 노래; Geu Norae\n| length9          = 5:22\n| title10          = Walking With\n| note10           = 동행; Donghaeng\n| length10         = 4:25\n}}\n;Notes\n* The title of track 2 literally means \"The Youth\".\n* The title of track 5 literally means \"That's How I Am\".\n* The title of track 7 literally means \"My Heart Is\".\nChart performance\nAlbum charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2014)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n! scope=\"col\"| Sales\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| South Korean Gaon Weekly Albums Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2\n| rowspan=\"4\"|\n* KOR: 58,300+\n*}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| South Korean Gaon Monthly Albums Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| South Korean Gaon Year-End Albums Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 40\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard World Albums Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 3\n|}\nSingle charts\nHow I Am\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2014)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n! scope=\"col\"| Sales\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| South Korean Gaon Weekly Singles Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1\n| rowspan=\"3\"|\n* KOR: 900,000+ (digital downloads only)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| South Korean Gaon Monthly Singles Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| South Korean Gaon Year-End Singles Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 46\n|}\nOther charted songs\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak chart position\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Sales\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| KORGaon\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" align=\"left\"| \"My Very Own\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 5\n|\n* KOR: 402,000+ (digital downloads only)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" align=\"left\"| \"Confession\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 6\n|\n* KOR: 279,000+ (digital downloads only)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" align=\"left\"| \"Those Days\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 9\n|\n* KOR: 269,000+ (digital downloads only)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" align=\"left\"| \"Walking With\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 11\n|\n* KOR: 270,000+ (digital downloads only)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" align=\"left\"| \"Advice\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 12\n|\n* KOR: 221,000+ (digital downloads only)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" align=\"left\"| \"Where My Heart Is\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 13\n|\n* KOR: 210,000+ (digital downloads only)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" align=\"left\"| \"Puzzle\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 15\n|\n* KOR: 185,000+ (digital downloads only)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" align=\"left\"| \"That Song\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 16\n|\n* KOR: 185,000+ (digital downloads only)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" align=\"left\"| \"Today\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 19\n|\n* KOR: 172,000+ (digital downloads only)\n|}\nAwards and nominations\nAnnual music awards\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
