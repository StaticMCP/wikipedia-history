On the losing side against Victoria in late November 1969 he scored 39 not out, winning Australia's first man of the match award. His first-class debut came a month later when Tasmania played a New Zealand XI in Hobart.\nHoward's sole first-class century was scored for Tasmania during a match against New South Wales in Hobart during the 1976–77 season. He went to the wicket with the score at 3 for 8 and made 111 out of a team total of 227. He was a member of Tasmania's inaugural Sheffield Shield team in October 1977. He was an opening batsman for the Tasmanian team that won the Gillette Cup in 1978–79. In 1979 he played a season as the professional for Nelson in the Lancashire League.\nHoward also played senior Australian rules football with City-South in the NTFA during the late 1960s.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
