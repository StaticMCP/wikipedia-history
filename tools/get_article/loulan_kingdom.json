Chinese army officers were sent to colonize the area, and an office of commandant was established at Yixun. A number of settlements in the Tarim Basin such as Qiemo and Niya were described in the Book of Han as independent states, but these later became part of Shanshan. While the name of the kingdom was changed to Shanshan by the Chinese, the Loulan region continued to be known as Kroran by the locals.\nThe region remained under Chinese control intermittently, and when China was weak in the Western Regions, Loulan was essentially independent. In 25 CE it was recorded that Loulan was in league with the Xiongnu. In 73 CE, the Han army officer Ban Chao went with a small group of followers to Shanshan, which was also receiving a delegation from the Xiongnu at the same time. Ban Chao killed the Xiongnu envoys and presented their heads to the King, after which King Guang of Shanshan submitted to Han authority. This would ensure the first step of the 'Silk Road' from central China to Shanshan would be under stable Chinese control. Around 119, Ban Yong recommended that a Chinese colony of 500 men be established in Loulan. A later military colony was established at Loulan by General Suo Man. It was recorded that in 222 CE, Shanshan sent tribute to China, and that in 283, the son of the king was sent as a hostage to the Chinese court during the reign of Emperor Wu of Jin. Loulan was also recorded as a dependent kingdom of Shanshan in the 3rd century Book of Wei.\nThe town of Loulan was abandoned in 330 CE, probably owing to lack of water when the Tarim River, which supported the settlement, changed course; the military garrison was moved  south to Haitou (海頭). The fort of Yingpan to the northwest remained under Chinese control until the Tang dynasty.  According to the Book of Wei, King Bilong of Shanshan fled to Qiemo together with half of his countrymen after an attack by Juqu Anzhou in 442 CE; so, Shanshan came to be ruled by Qiemo. In 445 Shanshan submitted to the Northern Wei. At the end of the 6th century, the Sui dynasty reestablished the city state of Shanshan.\nAfter the 5th century, however, the land was frequently invaded by nomadic states such as Tuyuhun, the Rouran Khaganate, and the Dingling and the area gradually was abandoned. Around 630, at the beginning of the Tang period, Shanfutuo (鄯伏陁) led the remaining Shanshan people to Hami.\nThe Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang passed through this region in 644 on his return from India to China, visited a town called Nafubo (納縛波, thought to be Charklik) of Loulan, and wrote of Qiemo, \"A fortress exists, but not a trace of man\".\nDescriptions in historical accounts\nAccording to the Book of Han, Han envoys described the troops of Loulan as weak and easy to attack. Shanshan was said to have 1,570 households and 14,000 individuals, with 2,912 persons able to bear arms. It further described the region thus:\n}}\nAccording to the Commentary on the Water Classic, General Suo Mai (索勱, also Suo Man) of Dunhuang introduced irrigation techniques to the region by damming the Zhubin (possibly the Kaidu River) to irrigate the fields and produced bumper harvests for the next three years.\nThe Buddhist pilgrim Faxian who stayed in Shanshan in 399 on the way to India, described the country:}}The famous historical short story by acclaimed Japanese author Yasushi Inoue entitled \"Lou-lan\" recounts the continual flux of control in the area and how the inhabitants dealt with Chinese & nomadic invaders throughout its relatively short history.\nEthnolinguistic identity\ninfluences, from the mural paintings signed Tita in the Loulan site of Miran (Xinjiang), 3rd century CE]]\nThe earliest known residents in Loulan are thought to have been a subgroup of the Tocharians, an Indo-European people of the Tarim Basin. Excavations in Loulan and the surrounding areas have found mummies believed to be remains of these people, for example the so-called \"Beauty of Loulan\" which was found by Chinese archaeologists in 1979–1980 at Qäwrighul (Gumugou), around  west-north-west of Loulan. The mummies have been dated to as early as 1800 BCE. Genetic and proteomic analyses of the mummies, however, suggests that the local population were genetically isolated but were influenced by practices of neighbouring populations.\nThe official language found in 3rd century CE documents in this region is Gandhari Prakrit written in Kharosthi script; their use in Loulan and elsewhere in the Tarim Basin was most likely due to the cultural legacy of the Kushan Empire, and introduced by Gandharan migrants from the Kushan Empire. These Gandharan migrants are also believed to have introduced Buddhism to Loulan. Although Gandhari was used as the administrative language, some words generally thought to be of Tocharian origin are found in the documents, suggesting that the locals spoke a language that belongs to the Tocharian group of languages. This original language of Loulan is referred to as Krorainic or \"Tocharian C\", due to its relatedness to the two other Tocharian languages. It has been partially reconstructed from around 100 loanwords and over a thousand proper names used in these Prakrit documents that cannot be ascribed to Indic. In 2018, documents from Loulan written in Tocharian C were published, indicating a relationship to Tocharian A and B, but transcription of the texts in this study has been rejected by other scholars.\nThe native name of Loulan was \"Kroraina\" or \"Krorän\", written in Chinese as Loulan 樓蘭 (*glu-glân in reconstructed Han dynasty pronunciation, an approximation of Krorän). Centuries later in 664 CE the Tang Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang mentioned a place in Loulan named \"Nafupo\" (納縛溥), which according to Dr. Hisao Matsuda is a transliteration of the Sogdian word Navapa meaning \"new water.\" Sogdians, an Eastern Iranian people, maintained minority communities in various places in China at the time, especially Dunhuang in Gansu and Turfan in the Tarim Basin. Documents found in Loulan showed that Sogdians were present in the area in 313 CE, as well as Han Chinese and Tibetan tribesmen, indicating an ethnically diverse population in Loulan.\nArchaeology\n200–400 AD. The staff suggests the Greek deity Hermes.]]\nSven Hedin\nThe ruined city of Loulan was discovered by Sven Hedin, who excavated some houses and found a wooden Kharosthi tablet and many Chinese manuscripts from the Western Jin dynasty (266–420), which recorded that the area was called \"Krorän\" by the locals in Kharosthi but was rendered as \"Lou-lan\" in Chinese. Hedin also proposed that a change in the course of the Tarim river resulted in Lop Nur drying up may be the reason why Loulan had perished.\nAurel Stein\ndocument found in Loulan by Aurel Stein]]\nAurel Stein made further excavations in 1906 and 1914 around the old lake of Lop Nur and identified many sites in the area. He designated these sites with the letter L (for Loulan), followed by a letter of the alphabet (A to T) allocated in the chronological order the sites were visited. Stein recovered many artifacts, including various documents, a wool-pile carpet fragment, some yellow silk, and Gandharan architectural wood carvings.\nL.A. – A walled settlement lying to the north of the lake. The thick wall is made of packed earth and straw and was over  on each side and  thick at the base. It contains a large stupa and some administrative buildings and was occupied for a long time. It is usually thought to be the city of Loulan.\nL.B. –  A site with stupas at  to the northwest of the L.A.\nL.E. – A fortified town lying  to the northeast of L.A. It is the only known city in the region with a northern gate. Since a northern gate was mentioned in the Han Chinese text about the assassination of the king of Loulan, it has therefore been suggested to be the capital of Loulan in the 1st century BCE, before the Han Chinese gained control the region. Others, however, argue that the northern gate does not refer to Loulan but Chang'an. The site was occupied until the late 3rd century CE.\nL.F. –  to the northwest of L.A., containing building foundations and a cemetery. Archaeologists discovered the body of a young man in a wooden coffin, wearing a felt hat and leather boots and lying under a woolen blanket. A bunch of ephedra twigs was placed beside him in a similar fashion to many much older burials found in the region.\nL.K. – A walled city to the west of the lake with only a gateway in the city wall. It has been identified as Haitou by some archaeologists.\nL.L. – A fortress lying  northwest of L.K., similar in construction but smaller.\nChinese archaeological expedition, 1979–1980\n, Charklik]]\nIn 1979 and 1980, three archaeological expeditions sponsored by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Xinjiang Branch performed excavations in Loulan. They discovered a canal  deep and  wide running through Loulan from northwest to southeast, a  high earthen dome-shaped Buddhist stupa; and a home  long by  wide, apparently for a Chinese official, housing 3 rooms and supported by wooden pillars. They also collected 797 objects from the area, including vessels of wood, bronze objects, jewellery and coins, and Mesolithic stone tools Other reported (2003) finds in the area include additional mummies and burial grounds, ephedra sticks, a string bracelet that holds a hollowed jade stone, a leather pouch, a woolen loincloth, a wooden mask painted red and with large nose and teeth, boat-shaped coffins, a bow with arrows and a straw basket.\nGenetics\nPaternal Haplogroups\nThe inhabitants of Loulan had mainly haplogroup R1b, with O1a also present.\nMaternal Haplogroups\nThe inhabitants of Loulan had haplogroups such as H5a, T1a, R2, HV12, J1b, N1a, T2b, D4i, H2b, U5a, C7b.\nAutosomal DNA\nThe Loulan people have a diverse origin, mostly descended from steppe pastoralists associated with the Andronovo/Sintasha and Afanasevo cultures, but there is also significant influence from Bronze Age populations such as the bmac, Baikal HG and Yellow farmer, and there is also minor contribution from the AASI (probably brought from India) and APS.\n/Ancient North Eurasian ( EHG/ANE), Caucasian Hunter-Gatherer/Iran Neolithic Farmer ( CHG/INF), Anatolian Neolithic (), East Asian hunter gatherer ( ANA), Yellow River Neolithic Farmer ( YRNF), Ancient Ancestral South Indians ( AASI) and Ancient Paleo-Siberian ( APS)]]\n() Afanasevo culture (), BMAC (), Tarim mummies (), Baikal HG () and Yellow Farmer ()]]\nSee also\n*Charklik\n*Cherchen\n*Endere\n*Gushi culture\n*Lop Nur\n*Miran\n*Niya\n*Xiaohe Tomb complex\nFootnotes\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*Ma Dazheng. 2003.
