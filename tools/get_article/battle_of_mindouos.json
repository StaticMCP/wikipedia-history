Procopius wrongly claimed that the two battles were one. The Byzantine commander Belisarius was ordered to build a fortress at the location. When Persian forces arrived in the area, his forces were routed in a battle on a nearby hill. As Belisarius was promoted shortly afterwards, it is likely that he was not seen as being responsible himself for the defeat. It is possible but unlikely that Belisarius was not the overall commander of the Byzantine army, but a junior partner.\nReferences"
