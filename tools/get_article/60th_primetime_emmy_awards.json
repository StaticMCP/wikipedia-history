The ceremony was hosted by Tom Bergeron (who was also hosting ''America's Funniest Home Videos and Dancing with the Stars, both also on ABC, at the time), Heidi Klum, Howie Mandel, Jeff Probst, and Ryan Seacrest (all were nominated in the debut category—Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program) and televised in the United States on ABC. 28 awards were presented.\nThe nominations were announced on July 17 by Kristin Chenoweth and Neil Patrick Harris. The Creative Arts Emmy Awards were held eight days earlier (September 13) at the same venue. The ceremony was hosted by Neil Patrick Harris and Sarah Chalke.\nThe telecast was viewed by 12.20 million with a household rating of 8.86/12.79 making it the lowest rated and least viewed ceremony in its televised history. Many critics cited lackluster performances from the five hosts as a reason for the huge decline. Others pointed to the field of nominees which were dominated by low-rated and sparsely viewed programs, thus making the Emmys widely considered as a bust, which was panned by critics as \"... the worst ever, laid a big, fat ratings egg as well ...\"\nIn 2011, when TV Guide Network re-did their list of \"25 Biggest TV Blunders\", this ceremony was included.\nFor the first time in a decade, the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series was won by the defending champion. 30 Rock\nOutstanding Drama Series went to AMC freshmen series Mad Men. This marked the first series award for a program on a basic cable station. Mad Men led all dramas with six major nominations.\nThis would be the final ceremony to have five nominees per category, most major categories (acting and programs) were expanded to include at least six slots the following year.\nWinners and nominees\nWinners are listed first and highlighted in bold:\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program winner]]\n, Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program winner]]\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* '30 Rock (NBC)'\n** Curb Your Enthusiasm (HBO)\n** Entourage (HBO)\n** The Office (NBC)\n** Two and a Half Men (CBS)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Mad Men (AMC)'\n** Boston Legal (ABC)\n** Damages (FX)\n** Dexter (Showtime)\n** House (Fox)\n** Lost (ABC)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Recount (HBO)'\n** Bernard and Doris (HBO)\n** Extras: The Extra Special Series Finale (HBO)\n** The Memory Keeper's Daughter (Lifetime)\n** A Raisin in the Sun (ABC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'John Adams (HBO)'\n** The Andromeda Strain (A&E)\n** Cranford (PBS)\n** Tin Man (Sci Fi)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'The Daily Show with Jon Stewart (Comedy Central)'\n** The Colbert Report (Comedy Central)\n** Late Show with David Letterman (CBS)\n** Real Time with Bill Maher (HBO)\n** Saturday Night Live (NBC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\"  |\n* 'The Amazing Race (CBS)'\n** American Idol (Fox)\n** Dancing with the Stars (ABC)\n** Project Runway (Bravo)\n** Top Chef (Bravo)\n|}\nActing\nLead performances\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Alec Baldwin – 30 Rock as Jack Donaghy (NBC)'\n** Steve Carell – The Office as Michael Scott (NBC)\n** Lee Pace – Pushing Daisies as Ned (ABC)\n** Tony Shalhoub – Monk as Adrian Monk (USA)\n** Charlie Sheen – Two and a Half Men as Charlie Harper (CBS)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Tina Fey – 30 Rock as Liz Lemon (NBC)'\n** Christina Applegate – Samantha Who? as Samantha Newly (ABC)\n** America Ferrera – Ugly Betty as Betty Suarez (ABC)\n** Julia Louis-Dreyfus – The New Adventures of Old Christine as Christine Campbell (CBS)\n** Mary-Louise Parker – Weeds as Nancy Botwin (Showtime)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Bryan Cranston – Breaking Bad as Walter White (AMC)'\n** Gabriel Byrne – In Treatment as Dr. Paul Weston (HBO)\n** Michael C.
