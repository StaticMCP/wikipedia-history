It opened as the Grand Theatre on March 7, 1918, with Douglas Fairbanks in ''Headin' South and Winifred Westover in Her Husband’s Wife''. The theater was renamed Warner Theatre on January 2, 1930. In 1983 the theater was closed, the auditorium was demolished, and a two-story shopping center named Warner Center was built on the site.\nIt was turned into an indoor shopping mall.
