The Florida primary was a closed primary, with the state awarding the largest amount of delegates towards the 2000 Democratic National Convention with 186 delegates, of whom 161 were pledged delegates allocated on the basis of the primary results.\nVice president Al Gore was the clear winner of the Florida primary, receiving almost 82% of the vote and 144 delegates, winning every county in the state and significantly extending his delegate lead. Senator Bill Bradley placed second with only around 18% of the vote and 17 delegates.\nProcedure\nFlorida was one of six states which held primaries on March 14, 2000, alongside Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas after Super Tuesday the week before.\nVoting took place throughout the state from 7:00&nbsp;a.m. until 7:00&nbsp;p.m. local time. In the closed primary, candidates had to meet a threshold of 15 percent at the congressional district or statewide level in order to be considered viable. The 186 pledged delegates to the 2000 Democratic National Convention were allocated proportionally on the basis of the results of the primary. Of these, between 2 and 7 were allocated to each of the state's 23 congressional districts and another 21 were allocated to party leaders and elected officials (PLEO delegates), in addition to 35 at-large delegates.\nPost-primary congressional district caucuses convened to designate national convention district delegates. The state convention was subsequently held to vote on the 35 at-large and 21 pledged PLEO delegates for the Democratic National Convention. The delegation also included 22 unpledged PLEO delegates: 13 members of the Democratic National Committee, 9 members from Congress (1 senator, Bob Graham, and 8 representatives, Allen Boyd, Corrine Brown, Karen Thurman, Jim Davis, Carrie Meek, Robert Wexler, Peter Deutsch, and Alcee Hastings), and 3 add-ons.\nCandidates\nThe following candidates appeared on the ballot:\n*Al Gore\nWithdrawn\n*Bill Bradley\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2;margin-bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:0.2em 0.4em;\" | 2000 Florida Democratic presidential primary\n!
