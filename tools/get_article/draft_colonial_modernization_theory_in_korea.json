Proponents of this theory, including South Korean economist Yi Young-hoon, argue that modern institutions like private property rights, Company Law, and mass education were first institutionalized under Japanese rule, which enabled long-term economic development. According to this view, modernization occurred not only in physical infrastructure but also through the creation of legal-rational governance and market structures.\nSouth Korean historian and educator Bae Min shares elements of this revisionist perspective, particularly in his critique of contemporary Korean history education. He argues that the dominant nationalist framework used in school curricula often reduces the colonial period to a one-dimensional narrative of exploitation and fails to acknowledge the complexity of institutional transformations. Bae contends that reforms such as the abolition of forced labor and the development of modern taxation systems under Japanese administration marked a significant departure from the feudal practices of the late Joseon Dynasty and introduced liberal principles more consistently than previous Korean governments.\nDespite such arguments, critics of the colonial modernization theory maintain that these changes primarily served Japanese imperial interests rather than the Korean people. They point to widespread oppression, cultural assimilation policies, and economic exploitation during the colonial period. They also question the historical validity of statistics collected by Japanese authorities and argue that modernization efforts were already underway in the Korean Empire through internal reform movements. The debate remains polarizing in South Korea, where the theory is associated with the New Right and continues to spark contention among historians, educators, and the public.\nReferences"
