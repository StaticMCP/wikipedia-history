This has been the focus of his more recent expeditions such as the 'Africa Rainbow Expedition' and 'The Outside Edge Expedition'. This aim has been implemented through programmes such as the 'One Net, One Life' campaign which aims to give out thousands of mosquito nets to help prevent malaria simply and cheaply. The 'Right to Sight' campaign provides glasses to assist the hard of sight, allowing them to resume simple tasks such as sewing, reading and beadwork to help them contribute to their community. The third campaign 'Teaching on the Edge', a scheme supported by Centurus Colleges and Rotary International, aims to provide teaching resources and mobile libraries to remote communities to provide education and improve literacy.\nBooks by Kingsley Holgate\n*Cape to Cairo: A Family Expedition Along the Waterways of Africa\n*Africa: In the Footsteps of the Great Explorers\n*Capricorn: Following the Invisible Line\n*Afrika: Dispatches from the Outside Edge\nReferences\nExternal links\n*http://www.imagineering.co.za/boundlesssa\n*http://goafrica.about.com/od/peopleandculture/a/holgate.htm"
