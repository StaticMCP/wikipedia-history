The songs she recorded during that time period have received multiple releases in various configurations. This two-disc compilation re-issues both Odetta Sings Ballads and Blues and At the Gate of Horn.\nThe early Everest LP compilation (1963) of the Tradition recordings, Odetta, used tracks from both albums as well as The Tin Angel. Another compilation, Absolutely the Best, focuses on the same master tapes, but does not include both complete albums. The Best of Odetta: Ballads and Blues uses tracks from the same two albums, including 18 tracks compared to this set's thirty-one.\nThe songwriting credits for these traditional folk songs vary widely from one compilation to another.\nTrack listing\nAll songs Traditional unless otherwise noted.\n#\"Santy Anno\"  (Alan Lomax, John Lomax, Traditional) – 1:53\n# \"If I Had a Ribbon Bow\" (Prince, Singer) – 2:40\n# \"Muleskinner Blues\" (Jimmie Rodgers) – 2:49\n#\"Another Man Done Gone\" – 2:09\n# \"Shame and Scandal\" – 2:21\n# \"Jack o' Diamonds\"  (Alan Lomax, John Lomax, Traditional) – 3:13\n#\"'Buked and Scorned\" – 2:38\n#\"Easy Rider  (Lomax, Lomax, Traditional) – 5:04\n#\"Joshua\" – 1:51\n#\"Hound Dog\" – 3:48\n# \"Glory, Glory\" – 2:10\n#\"Alabama Bound\"  (Lomax, Lomax, Traditional) – 1:40\n#\"Been in the Pen\" – 2:30\n#\"Deep Blue Sea\" – 2:59\n#\"God's Gonna Cut You Down\" – 1:49\n#\"Spiritual Trilogy Medley: Oh Freedom/Come and Go With Me/I'm on My Way\" – 6:04\n#\"Gallows Tree (Gallows Pole)\" – 2:50\n#\"Lowlands\" – 2:34\n#\"The Fox\" – 1:47\n#\"Maybe She Go\" – 1:45\n#\"Midnight Special\" – 2:34\n#\"Deep River\" – 2:58\n#\"Chilly Winds\" – 2:41\n#\"Greensleeves\" – 2:48\n#\"Devilish Mary\" – 1:50\n#\"Take This Hammer\" – 3:25\n#\"He's Got the Whole World in His Hands\" – 1:51\n#\"Sail Away Ladies\" – 2:20\n#\"Lass of the Low Country\" – 4:31\n#\"Timber\" – 3:09\n#\"Pretty Horses\" – 2:59\nPersonnel\n*Odetta – vocals, guitar\n*Bill Lee – bass\nProduction notes\n*Remastering by Marco Marinangeli\nReferences"
