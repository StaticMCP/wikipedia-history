This increase translates to the average of 1,823 daily users increasing to 2,295 accessing the site at this reported time. According to The Huffington Post, among the 200,000 Sugar Daddy users, 42.1% reportedly identify as Republicans and 34.9% as Democrats.\nIn October 2013, the website had a surge in registrations during the U.S. federal government shutdown.\nIn 2016, American entrepreneur and part of the UK series, \"Dragon's Den\",  Doug Richard admitted to consensual sexual activity with a minor he met through SeekingArrangement, believing her to be 17 at the time. The court heard that the minor in question told Richard on a number of occasions that she was 17. On January 29, 2016, Richard was cleared of all charges brought against him by a unanimous jury decision.\nBy 2016, the website reported having five million members and that it generated nearly  in revenue each year.\nIn 2021, the company began encouraging users to focus more on finding long-term relationships. By February 2022, the website had completed a rebrand to Seeking.com to reposition the site as a luxury dating service. According to Wade, the decision to shift the focus of the site was inspired by the success of his own relationship with his wife and co-CEO, Dana Rosewall, who he met on the site in 2020.\nIn June 2022, the website's founder Wade stepped down as CEO and was succeeded by Ruben Buell, who served as CEO of Reflex Media, the company that maintains Seeking.com and several other similar websites. During Buell’s two year tenure as CEO, Wade remained a strategic advisor to the company.\nIn June 2024, Wade returned to Seeking as co-CEO alongside his wife Dana, who brought a female perspective to the company’s leadership, including the priority to encourage meaningful relationships.\nAs of 2024, the site has more than 46 million users.\nCollege users\nIn 2010, the website began offering free Premium Memberships to students who registered using their university email addresses. By January 2013, the website reported 2 million users, of which 44 percent were college students after seeing a significant increase in college students registering for the site compared to the previous year.\nIn 2014, over 1.4 million students were registered on the website. Requests from Sugar Babies varied from assistance with college expenses to monthly allowances for living expenses.\nOperations\nThe company's business model is based on a membership system. Members are able to register for site services free of charge, which provides them with a limited number of messages. Members have the option to purchase credits for expanded messaging privileges on either a monthly or annual basis with Premium and Diamond Memberships. The site promotes security and personal safety including background checks, two-factor authentication and a customer service department.\nIn 2025 the site made additions to enforce user verification, prevent fraud and address violations.\nThe website is used in more 130 countries and includes versions of the interface in eight languages. The company headquarters is presently located in Las Vegas, Nevada. There are additional offices located in Ukraine and Singapore.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
