This represented a national demographic increase of 54% from the 107,700 persons (0.2% of the population) in 2001.\nIn the United Kingdom censuses, 'Mixed White and Black African' is one of four subcategories of self-reported mixed ethnicity. The others are 'Mixed White and Black Caribbean', 'Mixed White and Asian', and 'Other Mixed'. Outside of the census, academics have studied the grouping, and resources regarding self-identity have explored emerging versions of mixed, white, black, and African identities in the United Kingdom.\nTerminology\nMixed White and Black African people are referenced and categorised across a multitude of areas of media, journalism and academia, as well as in relation to perceptions of personhood and self-identity. At times informally, they have been referred to as Mixed or Mixed-race White and Black African persons, people, and other variants, in the study and reporting of the group in the United Kingdom.\nWithin government-derived naming conventions, such as within the corresponding Office for National Statistics 'ethnic group' census category ('Mixed White and Black African'); the grouping is also widely referenced in relation to demographics of the country. This census category has been utilised by government, policing, the NHS, as well as non-governmental agencies, including charities, universities and other organisations.\nCensus\nThe option for the 'Mixed White and Black African' ethnic group was first introduced in the 2001 United Kingdom census. The category was listed alongside, and distinct from, various 'Mixed' subcategories, including 'Mixed White and Asian', 'Mixed White and Black Caribbean', and 'Mixed Other'.\nOther organisations and government\nKirklees Council uses the abbreviated 'Ethnicity Code' of MWBA for Mixed White and Black African persons. The Equality and Human Rights Commission use it to study ethnic groups in the United Kingdoms. In the country's education system, UCAS and  HESA collect statistics on the grouping, providing analysis to improve participation in higher education for person who identify with both white and black African ancestry. NHS in Central Bedfordshire defines members of the group as an ethnic minority. The Welsh Government has used the category to analyse different ethnic minority groups and population compositions in the UK.\nUse in academia\nEthnicity expert Peter J. Aspinall has made use of the category to evaluate changing perceptions of self-identity within the grouping between UK censuses. Professor of infectious disease epidemiology Ibrahim Abubakar has co-authored research in relation to COVID-19 which uses the grouping to analysis health outcomes of people with white and black African heritage within Britain.Figures unavailable for Scotland and Northern Ireland}}\n|}\nPopulation and distribution\nThe population of persons of Mixed White and Black African ancestry rose from 107,700 to 165,974 between the 2001 and 2011 censuses. This represented a national demographic rise from 0.2% to 0.3% for the whole UK population.\nIn England, the share of the population of persons identifying as Mixed White and Black African declined from 0.4% to 0.3%. With regards census-based identity, according to research by academic Peter J. Aspinall, 56.8 percent of those identifying with the category, chose the same ethnic group in the following UK census.\nReligion\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Religion\n! colspan=\"4\" |England and Wales\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |2011\n! colspan=\"2\" |2021\n|-\n!Number\n!%\n!Number\n!%\n|-\n|  Christianity\n|94,405\n|56.88%\n|122,830\n|49.21%\n|-\n| No religion\n|39,204\n|23.62%\n|82,522\n|33.06%\n|-\n|  Islam\n|15,681\n|9.45%\n|23,078\n|9.25%\n|-\n|  Judaism\n|432\n|0.26%\n|447\n|0.18%\n|-\n|  Buddhism\n|464\n|0.28%\n|552\n|0.22%\n|-\n|  Hinduism\n|339\n|0.20%\n|208\n|0.08%\n|-\n|  Sikhism\n|105\n|0.06%\n|51\n|0.02%\n|-\n| Other religions\n|708\n|0.43%\n|1,477\n|0.59%\n|-\n| Not Stated\n|14,636\n|8.82%\n|18,441\n|7.39%\n|-\n!Total\n!165,974\n!100%\n!249,596\n!100%\n|}\nCulture and society\nEducation\nIn 2016 data, Mixed White and Black African pupils had a 20% eligibility rate for free school meals. Of those eligible, 43% achieved 5 or more A* to C grade GCSEs, while those ineligible had a 60% rate, representing an 18% achievement gap. Chinese Britons had the smallest gap at 3% and White British had the highest at 33%. In contrast with other mixed groupings in the local authority, Mixed White and Black African pupils performed near to the group's national average in Lambeth.\nPeople who identify with mixed white and black African ancestry are eligible for Newcastle University's Partner Programme. The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, along with the Higher Education Statistics Agency, has attempted to identify underrepresentation within the grouping, and encourage higher education participation.\nHealth\nIn 2020 research on COVID-19-related deaths on different ethnic groups in the UK, data for standardised mortality ratios and confidence intervals showed that, while White British persons were at lower risk than the national average, and Black African persons were at higher risk; persons identifying as Mixed White and Black African demonstrated neither increased or reduced risk of mortality. A 2010 study also found the group demonstrating a median data position between the same two other census categories. They were found to be less likely to consume alcohol than White British persons, and more likely than Black African persons.\nRepresentations\nMany public figures from various fields and professions in the United Kingdom have spoken about their experiences as mixed race persons who possess what they, or various media, have defined as white and black African ancestry. Raised in Wales by an English mother and Nigerian father, singer Shirley Bassey's upbringing as a \"mixed-race child brought up by a white mother\" has been described as \"highly unusual\" for 1930s Britain. Also a singer, Emeli Sandé has referred to \"the Talk\" as a conversation that parents are faced with when black and mixed-race children first experience racism. Sandé, who has a white mother and black Zimbabwean father, was responding to the George Floyd protests in 2020. Fellow singer Raye, who has English, Swiss and Ghanaian heritage, believes that being mixed race has contributed to her ability to span music genres.\nActress Ashley Madekwe has stated \"I'm mixed race, and I'm very proud of that fact.\" Madwekwe suggested that \"I don't look white. I can't really play white\" characters. Also relating to casting in the film industry, Carmen Ejogo, who has Scottish and Nigerian ancestry, has proposed that her mixed-race heritage made her susceptible to a form of exoticism-based typecasting. With English, German Jewish, and Ghanaian ancestry, journalist Afua Hirsch concurs that the perceived exoticism of mixed race people has been exploited in media and advertising:\nAnd where as a child I longed for the normality of seeing a physical resemblance in others, now images of mixed-race people are everywhere. The trademark look; curly hair, brown skin, features that are a touch exotic but not so different as to be threatening to the mainstream, is used to sell sofas, house insurance, gym memberships and mobile phones. It's as if we have become the new, acceptable face of blackness.\nPoliticians Chuka Umunna and Helen Grant self-identify as mixed race; both being of English and Nigerian extraction. Actress Tupele Dorgu believes that her black Nigerian father and white English mother's marriage was judged in a discriminatory manner by members of her community growing up in Manchester, England.\nNotable contributions\nArts and entertainment\nNotable actors and actresses who are from or based in the UK have been described as being mixed race, and either referenced in media with or identify themselves as having both white and black African ancestry.
