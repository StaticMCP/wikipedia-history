It is situated on the R61 road (future N2 Wild Coast Toll Route) between Port Shepstone and Lusikisiki.\nHistory\nIn 1831 there was a crisis between the settlers in Port Natal (Durban) and Dingane, the Zulu king. Some settlers boarded a ship that was in the harbour and the others, including Henry Francis Fynn and his family, fled down the coast. The Zulu warriors caught up with them where Port Edward is today and massacred the fleeing settlers, which included local tribespeople of Langeni, on a hill called Isandlundlu (in English, shaped like a hut). The place has been known ever since as Tragedy Hill and its slopes are still littered with the bones of the victims.\nIn 1552, the Portuguese carrack \"Sao Joao\" ran aground at Port Edward and this is the first time in recorded history that peoples from Europe met peoples from South Africa.\nIn 1878, the ship \"The Ivy\" ran aground on Leisure Bay area beach.\nIn 1925, the area was partly owned by TK Pringle, and he named the inland portion Banner Rest as this was where he wished to \"strike his banner\". The village was laid out and was named Port Edward in honour of the Prince of Wales, who later became King Edward VIII.\nThe first holiday cottage in Port Edward was a shack built among the sand dunes in the early days by transport rider Edward Stafford. Unaware of their motility, however, he was surprised and dismayed to see his fine creation swallowed up.  The area was subjected to several name changes as property was bought and sold, but the practice came to an end in 1852 when the town of Port Edward was ceremoniously dedicated to the then Prince of Wales.\nGeography\nLocation\nPort Edward is the southernmost town of KwaZulu-Natal and lies north of the Mtamvuna River which separates KwaZulu-Natal from the Eastern Cape. It is situated approximately 46 kilometres (29 mi) south-west of Port Shepstone by road and 153 kilometres (95 mi) south-west of Durban by road.\nSuburbs\nThe 2011 census divided the main place of Port Edward into 16 “sub places” including:\n*Banners Rest\n*Black Rock\n*Doc Wilson Point\n*Ekubo Coastal Estate\n*Glenmore\n*Ivy Beach\n*Leisure Bay\n*Leisure Crest\n*Meadowbrook\n*Munster\n*North Sand Bluff\n*Palm Beach\n*Rennies Beach\n*Rocklands\n*Salmon Bay\n*Three Hills\nTourism\nPort Edward is a tourist resort for seasonal visitors from inland regions of South Africa.\nThere are many tourist seasons that influence Port Edward but the most significant is the Christmas/ New Year period spanning from early December to mid-January.
