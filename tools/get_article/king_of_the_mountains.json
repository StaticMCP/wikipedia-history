The climbs are categorised from 1 (most difficult) to 4 (least difficult) based on their steepness and length. A fifth category, called Hors catégorie (outside category) applies to mountains rated even more severe than first category. Similar ratings apply to climbs in the other major Tours.\nIn the Tour de France, the leader in the mountains competition wears a distinctive polka dot jersey (French: maillot à pois rouges). Although the King of the Mountains was first recognised in the 1933 Tour de France, the distinctive jersey was not introduced until 1975. In the Giro, the King of the Mountains leader wore a green jersey until 2011; in 2012, the jersey changed to blue at the behest of the corporate sponsor of the mountains classification. In the Vuelta several jersey designs have been used, but since 2010 it has been white with blue polka dots.\nAdditionally, King or Queen of the Mountains can also apply to the highest ranked user in certain activities tracked by services such as Strava.\nMountains classification winners of the Grand Tours\nWinners by year\n{| class=\"wikitable nowrap\" style=\"font-size:90%; width: 33em;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Legend\n|-\n| style=\"background: #ffffe8\" |\n| Rider also won General classification\n|-\n| style=\"background: #b1f0be |\n| Rider also won General and Points classification\n|-\n| style=\"background: #f5b8b5 |\n| Rider also won General and Young Rider classification\n|-\n| style=\"background: #f5c4e3 |\n| Rider also won Young Rider classification\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!
