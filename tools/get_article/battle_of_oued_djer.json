Following the seizure of Algiers, the Spanish sent a force against him but this Spanish force was defeated in the Algiers expedition of 1516.\nThe local population of Ténès called upon Arudj Reis to remove its ruler, who occupied the city with the help of the Spaniards. Arudj Reis set out with an almost entirely Kabyle army. Approximately 8,000 or 10,000 Arabs were assembled by the Sultan of Tenes, who was a Spanish agent. The Sultan of Ténès, Hamid Ben Abid, hastened to attack Arudj Reis. Due to his relations with the Spaniards of Oran, Arudj Reis was determined to make an example out of him. He left his brother Hayreddin in Algiers as its governor and set out with 1500 armed Moors from Spain or Janissaries and a large contingent of Kabyles. The battle took place at the banks of Oued Djer, near Blida, and Arudj Reis defeated his enemy and pursued them as far as Ténès, which was seized without resistance. Médéa and Miliana were also captured.\nArudj Reis would eventually seize Tlemcen upon the request of its inhabitants to remove its Spanish yoke.\nReferences"
