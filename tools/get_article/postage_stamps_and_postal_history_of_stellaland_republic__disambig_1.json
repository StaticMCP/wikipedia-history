It was incorporated in British Bechuanaland in 1885. British Bechuanaland was subsequently incorporated into the Cape of Good Hope in 1895.\nFirst stamps\nThe Stellaland Republic issued five values of postage stamps in February 1884. They were crudely printed, using the coat of arms as design, and inscribed \"REPUBLIEK / STELLALAND\". Postally used copies are much rarer than unused copies.\nOverprints\nSometime in 1885, \"TWEE\" (Afrikaans for \"two\") was overprinted on a few of the 4-pence stamps, halving their values. These are quite rare, selling at auction for several thousand dollars when they appear. It is not clear whether they were official government issues, or privately produced, perhaps as political propaganda, since the use of stamps had recently become nearly universal worldwide.\nSee also\n*Postage stamps and postal history of British Bechuanaland\n*Postage stamps and postal history of Bechuanaland Protectorate\nSources\n* Stanley Gibbons Ltd: various catalogues\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121010153223/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/home.html Encyclopaedia of Postal Authorities]\n*Rossiter, Stuart & John Flower.
