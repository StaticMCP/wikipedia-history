      "text": "# Battle of Woden's Burg (715)\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records a battle fought in the year 715 at '''Woden's Burg''', the Neolithic long barrow now known as Adam's Grave, near Marlborough, Wiltshire. The entry states: \"Her Ine 7 Ceolred fuhton æt Woddes beorge.\" (There Ine and Ceolred fought at Woden's hill.)\nIne was king of Anglo-Saxon Wessex and Ceolred was king of Anglo-Saxon Mercia. The identity of the opposing force is not recorded.\nThe Anglo-Saxon Chronicle also records an earlier battle on the same site. The area was of strategic importance since it lay near the intersection of the ancient Ridgeway with Wansdyke.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://archive.today/20121224082251/http://www.ravens-reenactment.org.uk/adams_grave.htm]"
