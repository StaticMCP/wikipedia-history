It requires Department of Homeland Security to coordinate with other Federal agencies and with State, local, and Tribal governments to develop a National Preparedness Goal with Emergency management. Congressional laws enacted, following the wake of 9/11, which resulted in new developments in the way security was  assessed and addressed in the United States, to prevent and respond to threatened or actual domestic terrorist attacks, disasters, and other emergencies by requiring a national domestic all-hazards preparedness goal. HSPD 5, HSPD-7, HSPD-8, and HSPD-8 Annex 1 are directives that deal with the preparedness goals.\nHSPD-8\nThe goal of HSPD-8, is the coordination and implementation of all-hazards preparedness in the United States, to help ensure the preparedness of the Nation to prevent, respond to, and recover from threatened and actual domestic terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other emergencies. The goal is to be attained by:\n*a. Providing for the effective, efficient, and timely delivery of federal preparedness assistance to state and local governments; and\n*b. Supporting efforts to ensure First responders are prepared to respond to major events, especially prevention of and response to threatened terrorist attacks. First responders can be civilians that are members of a United States national service program under the jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security,  'The National Office of Citizen Corp's' (FEMA) Individual and Community Preparedness Division, Community emergency response team (CERT)\nAnnex I\nHSPD-8, Annex I, National Planning; describes a common Federal planning process that supports development of a family of related planning documents, known as the Integrated Planning System (IPS).  The IPS concept provides the federal government with a consistent direction and delineation of authorities, responsibilities and requirements, common terms of reference, and plans based on shared assumptions.\nHistory\nThe domestic incident management plan is provided for from presidential directives HSPD-5 issued February 28, 2003, HSPD-7, HSPD-8, and HSPD-8 Annex 1, as a result of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. These directives set up the laws and regulations for managing domestic incidents by establishing the, comprehensive National Incident Management System (NIMS), and the National Response Framework (NRF). Both of these plans are augmented by the National Integration Center (NIC) and describes the way Federal departments and agencies will prepare for such a response, including prevention activities during the early stages of a terrorism incident.\nNational Security Presidential Directive 51, Homeland Security Presidential Directive 20 (NSPD-51/HSPD-20), and the National Continuity Policy, dated May 4, 2007, outline the continuity requirements for all Federal departments and agencies, with guidance for non-Federal organizations. These requirements include such things as essential functions, orders of succession, delegations of authority, continuity of operations, continuity of communications, vital records, and human capital. All of these rules and regulations for a national defense against any possible threat of national attack. HSPD-8 Annex 1 resulted in the Integrated Planning System (IPS) by using the Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101 (CPG).\n9/11\nThe attacks of September 11, 2001, brought about many changes in the country. An attack such as this had never before happened and steps had to be taken to ensure it didn't again.\nAround the world\nMany nations were affected by the attacks. Over 3000 lost their lives from the world including Australia, Bermuda, Canada, China, El Salvador, Germany, Grenada, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Sweden, United Kingdom, United States, and 30 that were listed as UNKNOWN.\nIn the U.S.\nCongress was swift to react and enacted laws to protect the United States with the Patriot Act, signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 26, 2001, and the Homeland Security Act of 2002 enacted November 25, 2002, as well as other laws for the protection of the country. This resulted in Presidential Directives, including HSPD-8, and HSPD-8 Annex 1, and formation of NIMS with offices in 10 locations.\nOffices\nRegion I: Boston\n*Federal Emergency Management Agency\n*99 High Street\n*Boston, MA 02110\nAreas:\nConnecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire,\nRhode Island, Vermont\nNIMS Coordinator:\nMike Brazel\nRegion II: New York\n*Federal Emergency Management Agency\n*26    Federal Plaza, Room 1307\n*New York, NY 10278-0002\nAreas:\nNew Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico,\nU.S. Virgin Islands\nNIMS Coordinator:\nMarshall Mabry\nRegion III: Philadelphia\n*Federal Emergency Management Agency\n*One    Independence Mall, 6th Floor\n*615 Chestnut      Street\n*Philadelphia, PA 10106-4404\nAreas:\nDelaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania,\nVirginia, West Virginia\nNIMS Coordinator:\nJohn Brasko\nRegion IV: Atlanta\n*Federal Emergency Management Agency\n*Federal Regional Center\n*402 South Pinetree Boulevard\n*Thomasville, GA 31792\nAreas:\nAlabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky,\nMississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee\nNIMS Coordinator:\nRupert    Dennis\nRegion V: Chicago\n*Federal Emergency Management Agency\n*536 S.

Existing White House defense and foreign policies will be under fire, such as a withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, as well as nuclear reduction attempts. The end result will be strengthened Homeland Security enforcement in anticipation of any possible retaliations from the Taliban or Al Qaida.\nOn March 30, 2011, President Obama issued Presidential Policy Directive 8, which replaces Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 8 - National Preparedness (issued Dec 17, 2003) and HSPD-8 Annex I - National Planning (issued December 4, 2007). The Obama directive places significant emphasis on an \"all-of-nation\" \"all-hazards\" approach to disasters, fusing together the capabilities of federal, state, and local authorities to respond to crises. It refocuses government resources on mitigation—preventing catastrophes from getting worse—and resilience—how communities actively respond to and recover from a major disaster.\nReferences"
