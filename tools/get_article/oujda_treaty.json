It was approved by Moroccan voters in a referendum on 31 August, and by the Libyan General People's Congress. The aim was to establish a \"union of states\" between the two, and eventually to create a \"Great Arab Maghreb\".\nThe treaty startled the administration of US president Ronald Reagan, who pointed out Libya's untrustworthy reputation and called his leader \"an instigator of international terrorism\". Other western countries like Spain or France also expressed their discomfort.\nReferences"
