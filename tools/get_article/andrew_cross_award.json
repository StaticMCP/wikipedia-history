They were awarded annually by the Churches' Media Council, an association which brought together churches, broadcasters, broadcasting authorities (both commercial and public service agencies) and media educators in celebrating and encouraging the best in journalistic reporting and analysis of religious news and current affairs in radio, television, in print media and online.\nThe Awards are named in honour of Bishop Agnellus Andrew (1908–1987) and Bishop Stewart Cross, former presidents of the Churches' Advisory Council on Local Broadcasting, the predecessor body of the Churches' Media Council.\nThe Andrew Cross Awards have not been presented since 2006, and in 2009 the Churches Media Council changed its name and its focus, becoming the Church and Media Network."
