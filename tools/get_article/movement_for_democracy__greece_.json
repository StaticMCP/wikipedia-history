The party's founding declaration was signed by, among others, five independent MPs, formerly members of the Syriza parliamentary group.\nHistory\nSyriza and Kasselakis\nFollowing Syriza's disappointing performance in the May and June 2023 legislative elections, Alexis Tsipras, its long-time leader, stood down from his position. In the following leadership election, Kasselakis as an outsider candidate was elected to succeed Tsipras. Kasselakis set about moving the party towards the centre, a controversial move which led to several figures leaving Syriza and the formation of party splits, including New Left.\nInternally, Syriza faced a crisis when key officials of central committee of the party attempted and succeeded to oust Kasselakis as party leader on accusations of \"autocratic behavior\". Kasselakis attempted to stand as a candidate in the new leadership election but was barred.\nNew party\nFollowing his expulsion from Syriza, Stefanos Kasselakis announced the creation of a new political initiative. Initially unnamed, he opened the party's name to a public vote.  On 23 November, 2024, he unveiled the party’s name as  \"Kínima Dimokratías\" (transl.: Movement for Democracy)\nIn April 2025, the party formalized its internal structures in preparation for elections later that month. It also expressed its intent to join the European Democratic Party (EDP). A proposal for membership was submitted to party members for an internal vote on 8–9 April. On 10 April, Kínima Dimokratías officially joined the EDP.\nIn May 2025, the party held elections for its presidency. Kasselakis faced a challenge from Elias Michalakopoulos, a fellow party member. Kasselakis secured the presidency with 96.8% of the vote.\nAffiliated members of parliament\nThe party has stated it seeks to at some point in 2025 to form an official parliamentary group. Until such time those MPs who are members or are affiliated with the party in a personal capacity sit as independents within parliament.\nEvangelos Apostolakis, an independent (formerly SYRIZA) MP, has been associating himself with the party, but has not joined the party.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Name\n!Constituency\n!Former party\n!Joined\n!Notes\n!\n|-\n|\n|Athens B3\n| rowspan=\"5\" |SYRIZA\n| rowspan=\"5\" |\n| rowspan=\"5\" |\n| rowspan=\"5\" |}}\n|\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* https://democrats.eu/en/the-european-democratic-party-welcomes-greeces-movement-for-democracy/"
