It is located alongside Charles Street, just east of Queen Street, in Kitchener. It opened in 2019.\nThe station serves southbound trains only; the nearest northbound platform is at Frederick station, about  away up Charles and Benton streets.\nThe station's feature wall consists of ceramic tiles in a pattern of teal, gray, orange and blue.\nThe platform is connected with Charles Street's sidewalks at either end, and pedestrians passing through walk along the platform.\nHistory\nThe current rapid transit station is the second train station in Kitchener which is named after (and located near) Queen Street. The Grand River Railway's main Kitchener station, which was located near the current Iron Horse Trail crossing with the street, was in service until 1955. The station building was demolished in the 1970s.\nThe station was structurally complete in October 2017, but only opened on June 21, 2019 along with the rest of the Ion light rail system.\nIn 2020, the City of Kitchener committed to a set of pedestrian infrastructure improvements on Queen Street near the station, which were designed to improve walkability in the area. These included wider sidewalks, more seating, and new trees and planters, as well as creation of a new parkette at Charles and Queen.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
