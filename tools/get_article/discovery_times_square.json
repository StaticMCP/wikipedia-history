It specialized in traveling exhibitions with 60,000 square feet of exhibition space. It was one of several exhibition spaces that catered to Times Square tourists (the others being Madame Tussauds and Ripley's Believe It or Not!).\nOperated by Discovery Communications and Running Subway Productions, it was located in Times Square in the basement in the former printing plant area of 229 West 43rd Street. Its goal was \"to create a home for traveling exhibitions that local museums might find either too large, too expensive, too nondisciplinary or too commercial for their nonprofit attention.\"\nThe President of Discovery Times Square was James Sanna. The museum had two directors, Guy Gsell from opening through November 2011 and Jim Arnemann from 2011 through closing. Discovery closed without public notice in September 2016.\nExhibitions\n* Titanic: The Artifact Exhibition (2009–2010)\n* Lucy's Legacy: The Hidden Treasures of Ethiopia (2009)\n* Leonardo da Vinci's Workshop (2009–2010)\n* King Tut (2010–2011)\n* Pompeii The Exhibit: Life and Death In The Shadows of Vesuvius (2011)\n* Harry Potter: The Exhibition (2011–2013)\n* CSI: The Experience (2011–2012)\n* Dead Sea Scrolls: Life and Faith in Biblical Times (2011–2012)\n* Terracotta Warriors: Defenders of China's First Emperor (2012)\n* SPY: The Secret World of Espionage (2012–2013)\n* SHIPWRECK!
