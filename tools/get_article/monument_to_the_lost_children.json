The monument is located on the grounds of the National Monument Camp Vught and was erected to commemorate the children's transports on June 6 and 7, 1943, from Camp Vught via Camp Westerbork to Sobibór. More than a thousand Jewish children and their parents were transported under the pretense of relocation to a special children's camp. Upon arrival at the extermination camp Sobibór in occupied Poland, they were immediately gassed.\nDescription\nThe monument was created by Teus van den Berg-Been and unveiled on September 5, 1999, by the Stichting Vriendenkring Nationaal Monument Vught. It consists of a base made of natural stone with bronze memorial plaques. The plaques are connected at the top with Stars of David. The names of all 1,269 children, along with their ages, are inscribed on the plaques. The lowest plaque bears a passage from the Bible:\nTHE CHILD IS NOT...AND I,\nWHERE SHALL I GO!Gusen concentration camp\nGENESIS 37:30\nIn front of the plaques lies cast bronze toys. The inscription on the plaque at the base of the monument reads:\nMORE THAN 1800 JEWISH CHILDREN WERE TRANSPORTED FROM HERE\nTO EXTERMINATION CAMPS.\nONLY A FEW SURVIVED\nTHE NAMES OF 1269 OF THESE CHILDREN ARE INSCRIBED HERE\nTHEY WERE DEPORTED WITH THE CHILDREN'S TRANSPORT ON JUNE 6 AND 7, 1943\nAND KILLED\nIN THEIR MEMORY, WE COMMEMORATE ALL THE CHILDREN WHO WERE DEPORTED FROM KAMP VUGHT\nNEVER TO RETURN\nMAY THEIR SOULS BE BOUND IN THE BUNDLE OF THE ETERNAL LIFE\nCommemoration\nAn annual commemoration ceremony is held at the children's memorial on or around June 6.\nGallery\nFile:Monument der gevallen kinderen Gedenksteen.JPG\nFile:Monument der gevallen kinderen detail 5.JPG\nFile:Monument der gevallen kinderen detail 4.JPG\nFile:Monument der gevallen kinderen detail 3.JPG\nFile:Monument der gevallen kinderen detail 2.JPG\nFile:Monument der gevallen kinderen detail 1.JPG\nFile:Monument der gevallen kinderen.JPG\nSee also\n* National Monument Camp Vught\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.4en5mei.nl/oorlogsmonumenten/zoeken/1981/vught-kindergedenkteken Description of the monument] at the National Committee for 4 and 5 May."
