It was the last general election to be held over several days and the last to be held before the First World War.\nThe election took place following the efforts of the Liberal government to pass its People's Budget in 1909, which raised taxes on the wealthy to fund social welfare programmes. The 1909 budget was only agreed to by the House of Lords in April 1910 after the January general election in which the Liberals and the Irish Parliamentary Party gained a majority. The Government called a further election in December 1910 to get a mandate for the Parliament Act 1911, which would prevent the House of Lords from permanently blocking legislation linked to money bills ever again, and to obtain King George V's agreement to threaten to create sufficient Liberal peers to pass that act (in the event this did not prove necessary, as the Lords voted to curtail their own powers).\nThe Conservative Party, led by Arthur Balfour with their Liberal Unionist allies, and the Liberal Party, led by Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, almost exactly repeated the numerical result produced in the January election, with the Conservatives again winning the largest number of votes. The Liberal Party under Asquith remained in government with the support of the Irish Parliamentary Party. This was the last election in which the Liberals won the highest number of seats in the House of Commons. It was also the last United Kingdom general election in which a party other than Labour or the Conservatives won the most seats.\nResults\nseat winners]]\n|}\n}}\nVoting summary\n|46.57}}\n|44.23}}\n|6.36}}\n|1.85}}\n|0.23}}\n}}\nSeats summary\n|40.60}}\n|40.45}}\n|11.04}}\n|6.27}}\n|1.19}}\n}}\nAftermath\nBoth the Liberals and the Conservatives won 272 seats, however the Liberals remained the largest party due to the Speaker having been Conservative, meaning they sat with 271 MPs.\nThe Liberals, still lacking a parliamentary majority, again went into coalition with the Irish Parliamentary Party, who insisted on a Home Rule Bill as a condition of coalition.\nSee also\n*List of MPs elected in the December 1910 United Kingdom general election\n*Parliamentary franchise in the United Kingdom 1885–1918\n*December 1910 United Kingdom general election in Ireland\n*December 1910 United Kingdom general election in Scotland\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Blewett, Neal (1972), Peers, the Parties and the People: General Elections of 1910 (U of Toronto Press); [https://archive.org/details/peerspartiespeop0000blew online]\n*  [https://archive.org/details/peerspartiespeop0000blew online]\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.election.demon.co.uk/geresults.html United Kingdom election results—summary results 1885–1979]\nManifestos\n*[http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1910/dec/december-1910-conservative-manifesto.shtml December 1910 Conservative manifesto]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070810223744/http://www.labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1910/dec/1910-dec-labour-manifesto.shtml December 1910 Labour manifesto]\n*[http://www.libdemmanifesto.com/1910/dec/december-1910-liberal-manifesto.shtml December 1910 Liberal manifesto]"
