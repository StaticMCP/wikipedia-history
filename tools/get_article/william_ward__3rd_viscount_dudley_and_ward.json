He was elected to the House of Commons for Worcester in 1780, a seat he held until 1788, when he succeeded his half-brother in the viscountcy and entered the House of Lords. In 1780 he married Julia Bosville, younger daughter of Godfrey Bosville of Gunthwaite, Yorkshire, and sister of the ardent Whig Colonel William Bosville (1745–1813). Ward died in April 1823, aged 73, and was succeeded by his son John, who served as Foreign Secretary and was created Earl of Dudley in 1827.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
