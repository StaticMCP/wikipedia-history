The song was a modest success, peaking at #32 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart. The song remained on the chart for 13 weeks.\nReception\nIn a mixed review of the album, AllMusic reviewer Whitney Z. Gomes praised the track and picked it as an AllMusic reviewer's pick.\nMusic video\nA video was produced for the song. It begins cutting between the band performing the song in a house and performing on a black stage. The band is later chained up in a dungeon before George Lynch breaks free and performs the song's solo. As Lynch performs the solo the other band members break free one by one. After the solo, Don Dokken wakes up chained to a bed, alone, before breaking free. The video ends with shots of the band performing in the house, in the dungeon, and against a backdrop of chains that explode as the video ends.\nJeff Pilson appears in the video on bass as Juan Croucier had left the band before filming began.\nTrack listing\n; 7\" single\n; 12\" single\nPersonnel\n* Don Dokken – lead vocals, rhythm guitar\n* George Lynch – lead guitar\n* Juan Croucier – bass, backing vocals\n* \"Wild\" Mick Brown – drums\nCharts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1983)\n!Peak position\n|-\n|US Top Rock Tracks (Billboard)\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" |32\n|}\nReferences"
