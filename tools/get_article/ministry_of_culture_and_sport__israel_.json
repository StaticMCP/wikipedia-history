Similarly, sport was part of the Education portfolio between 1994 and 1999 and 2003 and 2006. Both culture and sport were combined with the Science and Technology portfolio between 2006 and 2009, before being split into a separate post upon the formation of a new government in March 2009.\nList of ministers\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n!#\n!Minister\n!Party\n!Governments\n!Term start\n!Term end\n|-\n!colspan=6|Minister of Science, Culture and Sport\n|-\n|1||align=left|Matan Vilnai||align=left|Labor Party||28||5 August 1999||2 November 2002\n|-\n|2||align=left|Ophir Pines-Paz||align=left|Labor Party||31||4 May 2006||1 November 2006\n|-\n|3||align=left|Raleb Majadele||align=left|Labor Party||31||29 January 2007||31 March 2009\n|-\n!colspan=6|Minister of Culture and Sport\n|-\n|4||align=left|Limor Livnat||align=left|Likud||32, 33||31 March 2009||14 May 2015\n|-\n|5||align=left|Miri Regev||align=left|Likud||34||14 May 2015||17 May 2020\n|-\n|6||align=left|Hili Tropper||align=left|Blue and White||35, 36||17 May 2020||29 December 2022\n|-\n|7||align=left|Miki Zohar||align=left|Likud||37||29 December 2022||\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://mcs.gov.il/English/Pages/default.aspx Ministry of Culture and Sport]"
