It was established in 894 around Ganzhou in modern-day Zhangye, and lasted until 1036. During that time, many of Ganzhou's residents converted to Buddhism.\nThe Hexi Corridor, located within modern Gansu, was traditionally a Chinese inroad into Central Asia. From the 9th to 11th centuries this area was shared between the Ganzhou Uyghurs and the Guiyi Circuit. By the early 11th century both the Uyghurs and Guiyi Circuit were conquered by the Tangut people of the Western Xia dynasty.\nHistory\nThere was a pre-existing community of Uyghurs at Ganzhou by 840 at the very latest.\nIn 874, remnant forces of the Tibetan Empire known as the Wenmo, Han Chinese slave soldiers under the Tibetan Empire, in Ganzhou drove out the Uyghurs.\nAround the years 881 and 882, Ganzhou slipped from the control of the Guiyi Circuit.\nRemnants from the disintegrated the Uyghur Khaganate settled in Qinzhou 秦州, Liangzhou, Ganzhou, Suzhou 肅州, Guazhou 瓜州 and Shazhou 沙州. In 894 the Uyghurs led by Pangteqin (Huaijian Khagan) established the Ganzhou Uyghur Kingdom in Ganzhou.\nIn 902 the Ganzhou Uyghurs sent military aid to Emperor Zhaozong of Tang.\nIn 910 the Ganzhou Uyghurs attacked the Kingdom of Jinshan (Guiyi).\nIn 911 the Ganzhou Uyghurs attacked the Kingdom of Jinshan and forced them into an alliance as a lesser partner.\nIn 916 a Ganzhou Uyghur princess was married to Cao Yijin, governor of the Guiyi Circuit. The Guiyi Circuit regime of Dunhuang established marriage alliances, diplomatic, trade and cultural links with the Ganzhou Uyghurs.\nIn 920 Huaijian Khagan became sickly, and he died in 924; his sons Diyin and Renmei fought over the throne with Diyin coming out on top. They received a royal appointment from the Later Tang dynasty. The Khitans of the Liao dynasty offered to let the Ganzhou Uyghurs return to their former homeland on the Orkhon but they refused the offer.\nIn 925 Cao Yijin led an attack on the Ganzhou Uyghurs and defeated them.\nIn 926 Diyin died and Aduoyu succeeded him as Shunhua Khagan. Shunhua Khagan married Cao Yijin's daughter.\nIn 930 Cao Yijin visited the Ganzhou Uyghur court in Ganzhou.\nIn 933 Shunhua Khagan died and Jingqiong succeeded him.\nIn 961 the Ganzhou Uyghurs accepted the Song dynasty as suzerains. Due to freer status of women in Turkic society, the Ganzhou Kingdom often used both Buddhist monks and nuns as envoys to Song China, where Buddhist nuns were also highly patronized by the elite. The Song recognized the Ganzhou Uyghurs, as well as the Qarakhanids and the Qocho Uyghurs, as the collective descendants of the former Uyghur Khaganate. Arab sources, for example the account of Arab traveller Abū Dulaf (which may have been based on other sources of the period), seems to have referred to the Ganzhou Uyghur Kingdom as \"China\".\nIn 975 Jingqiong died and Yeluohe Mili'e succeeded him.\nIn 983 Jingqiong died and Lusheng succeeded him.\nIn 1003 Lusheng died and Zhongshun Baode Khagan succeeded him. The Tanguts attacked the Ganzhou Uyghurs but were defeated.\nIn 1008 the Ganzhou Uyghurs and Tanguts engaged in combat and the Uyghurs emerged victorious. The Liao dynasty attacked the Ganzhou Uyghurs and defeated them.\nIn 1009 the Ganzhou Uyghurs captured Liangzhou.\nIn 1010 the Liao dynasty attacked the Ganzhou Uyghurs and defeated them.\nIn 1016 Zhongshun Baode Khagan died and Huaining Shunhua Khagan succeeded him.\nIn 1023 Huaining Shunhua Khagan died and Guizhong Baoshun Khagan succeeded him.\nIn 1026 the Ganzhou Uyghurs were defeated in battle by the Liao dynasty, a defeat which weakened Uyghur control over the Hexi corridor sufficiently for the Tangut Li Yuanhao to seize control and proclaim the Western Xia. In 1028 the Ganzhou Uyghurs were defeated by the Tanguts, while Guizhong Baoshun Khagan died and Baoguo Khagan succeeded him.\nIn 1036 the Ganzhou Uyghur Kingdom was annexed by the Tanguts. After the destruction of their realm, the Ganzhou Uyghurs migrated and settled in Dunhuang (Shazhou) and Guazhou. The Guazhou Uyghurs surrendered to the Tanguts in 1030 and Shazhou surrendered in 1036. A record of a Huolasan Khan ruling in Shazhou in 1127 shows that the Uyghurs there retained some amount of autonomy in Western Xia. Another group that settled between Dunhuang and the Qaidam Basin came to be known as the Yellow Head Uyghurs. They practiced Buddhism and lived as pastoral nomads. In the 13th century they were called the Sali Uyghurs. Their descendants are today known as the Yugurs.\nEven though they had been conquered by the Tanguts, the Ganzhou Uyghurs maintained the practice of sending trade missions to the Song court.\nReligion\nThe Uyghurs of Ganzhou originally practiced Manichaeanism as their state religion but abandoned it for Buddhism at the end of the 10th century due to pressure from the Tanguts. Like the Tanguts, they sent Buddhist pilgrimages to Mount Wutai, but the real reason for the expeditions may have been to spy on the Liao dynasty. According to Hong Hao, a Song dynasty diplomat on his way to the Jurchen Jin dynasty, the Uyghurs of the Hexi Corridor still practiced Buddhism:\n|Hong Hao}}\nModern era\nThe modern day descendants of the Ganzhou Uyghurs are known as the Yugur.\nSee also\n*Yugur\n*Turkic peoples\n*Timeline of the Turkic peoples (500–1300)\n*Uyghur Khaganate\n*Qocho\nReferences\n*\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
