It is owned by Miquel y Costas, a Spanish company specialized in the manufacture of rolling paper booklets and other products such as filters, tubes or accessories.\nHistory\n1725 is the earliest documented reference of this company. It was not until almost 100 years later that the Miquel family started specializing in cigarette paper. In 1868 the brothers Lorenzo and Antonio Miquel y Costas began to manufacture cigarette paper and in 1879 \"El Pino\" was born, considered the predecessor brand of Smoking. Also that year, the company moved production to La Pobla de Claramunt and founded the company Miquel y Costas Hermanos.\nIn 1929, the company was incorporated and took its present name, Miquel y Costas & Miquel S.A.  Cigarette paper booklets first appeared in the 19th century and their international brand, Smoking, was introduced in 1924.\nThey manufacture Smoking, Pure Hemp, Guarani, Bugler, Bob Marley, SMK, Mantra and Bambú brand papers. They also produce many private label brands for other companies.\nIn 2006, Miquel y Costas was charged in Spain for allegedly using carcinogenic raw materials to cut production costs. The case was dismissed a few months later by the Audiencia Provincial de Barcelona, who found no basis for further proceedings.\nSee also\n* List of rolling papers\nReferences"
