However, the five non-incorporated territories that send delegates to the House of Representatives participated in the presidential primaries of both major parties.\nIn the presidential primaries, voters expressed their preferences for the Democratic and Republican parties' respective nominees for president. Registered members of each party only voted in their party's primary, while voters who were unaffiliated chose any one primary in which to vote. The caucuses for both parties were held in March 2016.\nCaucuses\nRepublican caucus\nPrior to the Republican caucus, Ralph Torres, the Governor of Northern Mariana Islands, endorsed Donald Trump. The Republican caucus took place on March 15, 2016:\nDemocratic caucus\nOn January 11, 2016, Northern Mariana Islander delegate Gregorio Sablan endorsed Hillary Clinton. The Democratic caucus took place on March 12, 2016.\nThis was the first time that the Northern Mariana Islands participated in the Democratic caucuses.\nSee also\n* Democratic Party presidential debates, 2016\n* Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016\n* Republican Party presidential debates, 2016\n* Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.gop.com/the-official-guide-to-the-2016-republican-nominating-process/ RNC 2016 Republican Nominating Process]\n* [http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P16/ Green papers for 2016 primaries, caucuses, and conventions]"
