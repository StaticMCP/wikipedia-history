It’s enough to entertain and, maybe, enlighten.\" Khalil Johnson from Punch Drunk Critics gave it mixed review writing: \"Call Her King isn’t trying to reinvent the wheel in regard to action movies, but it still doesn’t hit all the beats it needs to. Something like this could have been better served as a limited series. This would have meant a better budget as well as more time to flesh things out.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
