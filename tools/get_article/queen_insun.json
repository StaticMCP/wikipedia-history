She was queen consort of Joseon from 1545 until her husband's death in 1567, after which she was honoured as Queen Dowager Uiseong (). She served as regent of Korea during the minority of her adoptive son, king Yi Yeon, King Seonjo, from 1567 until 1568.\nBiography\nEarly life\nLady Sim was born on 27 June 1532 to Sim Kang and Lady Yi of the Jeonju Yi clan. She was the eldest within 10 siblings, including Sim Ŭigyŏm.\nMarriage\nIn April 1542, Lady Sim was arranged to marry Grand Prince Gyeongwon; the only son of King Jungjong and Queen Munjeong. Lady Sim was given the title of Princess Consort ().\nQueen\nIn 1545, when King Injong died, her husband was enthroned as the next king of Joseon as there were no heirs from Queen Inseong. The Princess Consort then became the next queen consort and had a son, Crown Prince Sunhoe, in 1551.\nThe Crown Prince died in 1563, leaving no heirs from King Myeongjong, who also died in 1567. This left Prince Haseong (the future King Seonjo), the youngest son of Grand Internal Prince Deokheung and Grand Internal Princess Consort Hadong, to become the next crowned prince.\nRegency and later life\nThe Queen Consort became queen regent in 1567 upon on the prince's enthronement as king because he was young. In 1568, she stepped down as regent and resumed being queen dowager. She was later given the title of Uiseong () in 1569.\nHer reign as queen dowager lasted 8 years as she died on 12 February 1575 within Changgyeonggung's Tongmyeongjeon Hall. Nearby where her mother-in-law, Queen Munjeong, is buried, the Queen is buried with her husband in Kangreung.\nFamily\nParent\n* Father − Sim Kang (심강,  沈鋼; 1514–1567)\n* Mother − Yi Hŭigyŏng, Internal Princess Consort Wansan of the Jeonju Yi clan (; 1511–1559)\nSibling\n* Younger brother − Sim Ingyŏm (; June 1533 – 17 November 1580)\n* Younger brother − Sim Ŭigyŏm (; 1535–1587)\n* Younger brother − Sim Yegyŏm (; 1537–1598)\n* Younger sister − Lady Sim of the Cheongsong Sim clan (; 1538–1579)\n* Younger brother − Sim Chi'gyŏm (; 1540–1568)\n* Younger brother − Sim Sin'gyŏm (; 1542–1596)\n* Younger sister − Lady Sim of the Cheongsong Sim clan (; 1543–1579); Yu Hŭibal's first wife\n* Younger brother − Sim Ch'unggyŏm (; 1545–1594)\n* Younger brother − Sim Hyogyŏm (; 20 September 1547 – 24 September 1600)\n* Younger brother − Sim Chegyŏm (; 1550–1589)\n* Younger sister − Lady Sim of the Cheongsong Sim clan (; 1556–?)\nConsort and Issue\n*Husband - Myeongjong of Joseon (; 3 July 1534 – 3 August 1567)\n#Son - Yi Bu, Crown Prince Sunhoe (; 1 July 1551 – 6 October 1563)\n##Daughter-in-law - Crown Princess Gonghoe of the Musong Yun clan (; 1550 – 14 April 1592)\n#Adoptive son - Seonjo of Joseon (; 26 November 1552 – 16 March 1608)\nIn popular culture\n* Portrayed by Jang Hee-jin in the 2016 JTBC TV series Mirror of the Witch.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}"
