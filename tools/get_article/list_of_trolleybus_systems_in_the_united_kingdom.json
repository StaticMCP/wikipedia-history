      "text": "# List of trolleybus systems in the United Kingdom\n\nThis is a list of trolleybus systems in the United Kingdom by Home Nation and by regions of England. It includes:\n*Past trolleybus systems in the UK.\n*Museums in the UK capable of running trolleybuses (i.e. possessing overhead wires and trolleybuses in working order).\nThere are currently no operational trolleybus systems in the UK.\nIn the United Kingdom the first trolleybus systems were inaugurated on 20 June 1911 in Bradford and Leeds, although public service in Bradford did not commence until 24 June. Coincidentally, the UK's last trolleybus service also operated in Bradford, on 26 March 1972.\nat the Black Country Living Museum]]\nEngland (by region)\nEast Midlands\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|-\n! width=15% | Name of system\n! width=20% | Location\n! width=15% | Date (from)\n! width=15% | Date (to)\n! width=35% | Notes\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| Chesterfield\n| 23 May 1927\n| 24 March 1938\n| See also Trolleybuses in Chesterfield.\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| Derby\n| 9 January 1932\n| 9 September 1967\n| See also Trolleybuses in Derby.\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| Nottingham\n| 10 April 1927\n| 30 June 1966\n| See also Trolleybuses in Nottingham.\n|-\n| Notts & Derby Traction Company\n| Nottingham\n| 7 January 1932\n| 25 April 1953\n| See also Trolleybuses in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire.\n|-\n|}\nEast of England\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|-\n! width=15% | Name of system\n! width=20% | Location\n! width=15% | Date (from)\n! width=15% | Date (to)\n! width=35% | Notes\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| Ipswich\n| 2 September 1923\n| 23 August 1963\n| See also Trolleybuses in Ipswich.\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| Southend-on-Sea\n| 16 October 1925\n| 28 October 1954\n| See also Trolleybuses in Southend-on-Sea.\n|-\n|}\nGreater London\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|-\n! width=15% | Name of system\n! width=20% | Location\n! width=15% | Date (from)\n! width=15% | Date (to)\n! width=35% | Notes\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |&nbsp;\n| rowspan=\"2\" |London\n| 1912\n| -\n| Demonstration\n|-\n| 16 May 1931\n| 8 May 1962\n|See also Trolleybuses in London.\n|-\n|}\nNorth East England\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|-\n! width=15% | Name of system\n! width=20% | Location\n! width=15% | Date (from)\n! width=15% | Date (to)\n! width=35% | Notes\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| Darlington\n| 17 January 1926\n| 31 July 1957\n| See also Trolleybuses in Darlington.\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| Hartlepool\n| 28 February 1924\n| 2 April 1953\n| See also Trolleybuses in Hartlepool.\n|-\n| Tees-side Railless Traction Board\n| Middlesbrough\n| 8 November 1919\n| 4 April 1971\n| See also Trolleybuses in Teesside.\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| Newcastle upon Tyne\n| 1 October 1935\n| 1 October 1966\n| See also Trolleybuses in Newcastle upon Tyne.\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| South Shields\n| 12 October 1936\n| 29 April 1964\n| See also Trolleybuses in South Shields.\n|-\n|}\nNorth West England\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|-\n! width=15% | Name of system\n! width=20% | Location\n! width=15% | Date (from)\n! width=15% | Date (to)\n! width=35% | Notes\n|-\n| South Lancashire Transport Company\n| Atherton\n| 3 August 1930\n| 31 August 1958\n| See also Trolleybuses in South Lancashire.\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| St Helens\n| 11 July 1927\n| 1 July 1958\n| See also Trolleybuses in St Helens.\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| Blackpool\n| 1983\n| &nbsp;\n| Demonstration.\n|-\n| Manchester Corporation Transport\n| Manchester\n| 1 March 1938\n| 30 December 1966\n| See also Trolleybuses in Manchester.\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| Ashton-under-Lyne\n| 26 August 1925\n| 30 December 1966\n| See also Trolleybuses in Ashton-under-Lyne.\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| Oldham\n| 26 August 1925\n| 5 September 1926\n| &nbsp;\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| Ramsbottom\n| 14 August 1913\n| 31 March 1931\n| System closed officially in 1928.
