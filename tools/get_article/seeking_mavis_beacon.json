The film is distributed by Neon and is Jones' directorial debut.\nSynopsis\nFilmmaker Jazmin Jones and her collaborator, Olivia McKayla Ross, search for the real-life woman who served as the face of Mavis Beacon, the fictional instructor in the widely used typing software Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing.\nThe documentary begins by outlining the history of the software, which was first released in 1987 by The Software Toolworks. The filmmakers explore how Mavis Beacon became an iconic figure despite not being a real person. Through interviews with former employees and industry experts, they confirm that the character was portrayed by Renée L'Espérance, a Haitian-born model who was photographed for the software’s cover but never credited or compensated beyond an initial payment.\nJones and Ross attempt to locate L'Espérance, traveling to various locations and speaking with individuals who may have known her. They uncover that she chose to disappear from public life after the software’s success. Their search leads to archival footage and documents, but L'Espérance ultimately declines to participate in the documentary.\nAs their investigation concludes, the filmmakers acknowledge the limits of their search, recognizing that L'Espérance’s absence remains a key part of the story. The documentary ends with reflections on Mavis Beacon’s cultural impact, while leaving L'Espérance’s fate unresolved.\nThe documentary was inspired by Cheryl Dunye's The Watermelon Woman, and Dunye moderated a panel following a screening of the film in Oakland.\nCast\n* Jazmin Renée Jones\n* Olivia McKayla Ross\nProduction\nSeeking Mavis Beacon was produced by filmmaker Guetty Felin and Neon, in association with Field of Vision.
