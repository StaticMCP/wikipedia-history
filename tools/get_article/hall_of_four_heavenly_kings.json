It is typically named due to the Four Heavenly Kings statues enshrined in the hall. In Chinese Buddhist temples, they are usually termed the Tianwang dian or Tianwang Hall. In Japanese Buddhist temples, they are usually termed the Tennō-den. In Korean Buddhist temples, they are usually termed the Cheonwangmun.\nChina\nTraditionally, the Hall of Four Heavenly Kings is built with the entrance facing north, and located before the Mahavira Hall. In the typical layout of a Hall of Four Heavenly Kings, the historical monk Budai, commonly regarded as an emanation of Maitreya Buddha, is enshrined at the front entry of the Hall of Four Heavenly Kings, with a statue of Skanda Bodhisattva behind him facing the back entry. Statues of the Four Heavenly Kings are usually enshrined at the four corners of the hall.\nIn Buddhism, the Maitreya Buddha, also the future Buddha is Sakyamuni's successor. In the history of Chinese Buddhism, Maitreya Buddha has the handsome image in which he wears a coronet on his head and yingluo () on his body and his hands pose in mudras. According to  (; Sung kao-seng chuan), in the Later Liang Dynasty (907-923), Budai was a big-stomached monk named \"Qici\" () in Fenghua of Mingzhou (now Zhejiang). Carrying a sack on his shoulder, he always begged in the markets and streets, laughing. So local people called him \"The Sack Monk\" (). When he reached his Parinirvana, he left a Buddhist Gatha: \"Maitreya, the true Maitreya, has thousands of hundreds of millions of manifestations, often instructing people of their time, even when they themselves do not recognize him.\" () So he was seen as the manifestation of Maitreya Buddha. Since then, in Chinese Buddhist temples, Maitreya statues were shaped into a big fat monk's image with a big head and ears, laughing with his upper body exposed and cross-legged.\nSkanda Bodhisattva is the dharmapala in charge of protecting Buddhist temples and scriptures. His image is typically depicted as a handsome ancient Chinese general who wearing armors, and wielding a vajra pestle. A few common poses he is depicted in include holding up the vajra pestle and leaning it on his shoulder with one hand while the other hand is held up in a mudra, leaning one end of the vajra pestle on the ground and gripping the other end with one hand while the other hand rests at his waist, and clasping both his hands together in a gesture of respect before his chest while the vajra pestle rests horizontally across his arms.\nThe statues of the Four Heavenly Kings are enshrined around the four corners on the left and right sides of the Hall of Four Heavenly Kings. There are the eastern Dhṛtarāṣṭra (; Dhṛtarāṣṭra wears white clothes and armor and has a pipa, a Chinese plucked string musical instrument, in his hand), the southern Virūḍhaka (; Virūḍhaka wears blue clothes with a sword in his hand), the western Virūpākṣa (; Virūpākṣa wears red clothes with a dragon or a snake wrapped around his arm), and the northern Vaiśravaṇa (; Vaiśravaṇa wears green clothes with a precious umbrella in his right hand and a silver sacred mouse in his left hand). The Four Heavenly Kings are said to live in Mount Meru and their task is to protect the world in their direction respectively.\nJapan\nIn Japan, Four Heavenly Kings Hall is exemplified at Manpuku-ji, the head temple of the Ōbaku Zen sect in Uji, Kyoto. Founded in 1661 by the Chinese monk Yinyuan Longqi (Ingen Ryūki), Manpuku-ji is renowned for its strict adherence to Ming dynasty Chinese architecture and rituals . The temple complex follows a symmetrical axial layout, with the Four Heavenly Kings Hall positioned between the Sanmon and the Mahavira Hall. The Four Heavenly Kings Hall features a hip-and-gable roof with ornate carvings, including peach-shaped door panels believed to ward off evil. Its design incorporates elements like \"×\"-shaped railings, reflecting Ming-era Yingzao Fashi standards. In 2024, the Four Heavenly Kings Hall, alongside the Mahavira Hall and Dharma Hall, was designated a Japanese National Treasure for its preservation of original construction. It enshrines a central statue of laughing Maitreya Buddha, crafted by the Chinese sculptor Fan Daosheng. Flanking him are the Four Heavenly Kings. It represents the transplantation of Chinese Chan Buddhism during Japan's Edo period.\nKorea\nIn Korea, Four Heavenly Kings Hall is often part of larger temple complexes. It typically enshrines statues of the Four Heavenly Kings, who protect the Dharma and the temple grounds. A notable example is found at Tongdosa Temple in Yeongsan, where the Four Kings guard the Vajra Altamundi platform near the Mahavira Hall. The platform, dating to the Unified Silla period (668–935), features sculptures of the Kings at its corners, alongside flying apsaras and Buddhist deities. Four Heavenly Kings Hall is characterized by traditional wooden architecture, multi-bracket systems, and deep eaves.\nVietnam\nIn Vietnam, Four Heavenly Kings Hall is integrated into temples like Thiên Mụ Pagoda in Huế, founded in 1601 by Nguyễn Lord Nguyễn Hoàng. The temple complex combines Chinese palace-style architecture with local elements, featuring hip-and-gable roofs, courtyards, and a iconic octagonal tower which called Phước Duyên Tower. It often houses Maitreya and the Four Heavenly Kings, while the Mahavira Hall enshrines the Three Saints of the West.\nExamples\nFile:Zhengding Longxing Si 2013.08.31 15-38-43.jpg|Song dynasty (960-1279) Tianwang dian of Longxing Temple in Zhengding, Hebei, China.\nFile:Shaolin Temple (10198851855).jpg|Yuan dynasty (1271-1368) Tianwang dian of Shaolin Temple in Dengfeng, Henan, China.\nFile:Pingyao Shuanglin Si 2013.08.26 08-55-25.jpg|Ming dynasty (1368-1644) Tianwang dian of Shuanglin Temple in Pingyao, Shanxi, China.\nFile:蔚州灵岩寺天王殿（南侧）.jpg|Ming dynasty (1368-1644) Tainwang dian of Lingyan Temple in Zhangjiakou, Hebei, China.
