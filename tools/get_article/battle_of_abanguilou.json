The attackers executed six civilians, and looted the camp.\nBattle\nFollowing the attack on the nomadic camp, Tuareg fighters in the MSA set off in pursuit of the ISGS militants, who were fleeing towards the border with Niger. The MSA fighters caught up, and clashes broke out between the two groups.\nThat same day, a French MQ-9 drone flying above Niger spotted a group of men on eight motorcycles heading back towards the border with Mali. Once the group crossed the border, and was assessed by French officials as being the perpetrators of the Abanguilou killings, the militants were killed by a French airstrike. French ground forces were then deployed. The ground forces, when assessing the damage, discovered a Glock-19 pistol that belonged to Jeremiah W. Johnson, an American soldier killed in the Tongo Tongo ambush a year prior.\nAftermath\nThe MSA stated in a press release that three fighters were killed in the clashes, and two were wounded. The group also stated a dozen ISGS fighters were killed. The French army stated six jihadists were killed and five motorcycles were destroyed.\nReferences"
