Between 1989 and 2019, the league was known as the State Basketball League (SBL).\nTraditionally, there were three main regular season awards given in the Men's and Women's competitions during the SBL era: Most Valuable Player, Coach of the Year and Most Improved Player/Rookie of the Year. There was also All-Star Five and All-Defensive Five.\nIn 2021, four main regular season awards were given for the first NBL1 West season: Most Valuable Player, Coach of the Year, Defensive Player of the Year and Youth Player of the Year. There was also Leading Scorer, Leading Rebounder, Golden Hands and All-NBL1 West First Team. In 2022, the league included Sixth Man/Woman of the Year for the first time.\nThe only individual award of the postseason is the Grand Final MVP. Between 1989 and 2019, there were perpetual trophies given to the champions of both competitions. These were discontinued in 2021.\nHonours\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" summary=\"Honor (sortable), Created (sortable), Description and Notes\"\n!scope=\"col\" width=15% class=\"unsortable\"| Honor\n!scope=\"col\"| Created\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:transparent;\"| All-NBL1 West First Team\n|align=center| 2005\n|Two five-player teams, one for Men and one for Women, composed of the best players in the league following every NBL1 West season.\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:transparent;\"| All-Defensive Team\n|align=center| 2016\n|Two five-player teams, one for Men and one for Women, composed of the best defensive players in the league following every NBL1 West season.\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:transparent;\"| All-Youth Team\n|align=center| 2024\n|Two five-player teams, one for Men and one for Women, composed of the best youth players in the league following every NBL1 West season.\n|}\nIndividual awards\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" summary=\"Award (sortable), Created (sortable), Description and Most recent winner(s)\"\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"22%\"| Award\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"1%\"| Created\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"50%\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"25%\" class=\"unsortable\"| Most recent winner(s)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:transparent;\"| Most Valuable Player\n|align=center| 1989\n|Awarded to the best performing player of the regular season in both the Men's and Women's competitions.\n|M: Isaac White (Rockingham Flames)W: Teige Morrell (Lakeside Lightning)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:transparent;\"| Grand Final MVP\n|align=center| 1996\n|Awarded to the best performing player in both the Men's Grand Final and Women's Grand Final.\n|M: Joel Murray (Mandurah Magic)W: Alexandra Sharp (Rockingham Flames)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:transparent;\"| Coach of the Year\n|align=center| 1989\n|Awarded to the best head coach of the regular season in both the Men's and Women's competitions.\n|M: Ryan Petrik (Rockingham Flames)W: Russell Hann (Cockburn Cougars)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:transparent;\"| Defensive Player of the Year\n|align=center| 2021\n|Awarded to the best defensive player of the regular season in both the Men's and Women's competitions.\n|M: Todd Withers (Warwick Senators)W: Stephanie Gorman (Cockburn Cougars)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:transparent;\"| Youth Player of the Year\n|align=center| 2021\n|Awarded to the best young player of the regular season in both the Men's and Women's competitions.\n|M: Johny Narkle (Geraldton Buccaneers)W: Alaska Rhebok (Perth Redbacks)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:transparent;\"| Sixth Man/Woman of the Year\n|align=center| 2022\n|Awarded to the best reserve player of the regular season in both the Men's and Women's competitions.\n|M: Verle Williams (Geraldton Buccaneers)W: Kyana Weir (Warwick Senators)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:transparent;\"| Leading Scorer\n|align=center| 2021\n|Awarded to the player with highest points per game tally of the regular season in both the Men's and Women's competitions.\n|M: Elijah Pepper (Warwick Senators)W: Karly Murphy (Kalamunda Eastern Suns)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:transparent;\"| Leading Rebounder\n|align=center| 2021\n|Awarded to the player with highest rebounds per game tally of the regular season in both the Men's and Women's competitions.\n|M: Josh Davey (Lakeside Lightning)W: Anneli Maley (Perth Redbacks)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:transparent;\"| Golden Hands\n|align=center| 2021\n|Awarded to the player with best assists plus steals to turnover ratio in both the Men's and Women's competitions.\n|M: Emmett Naar (Rockingham Flames)W: Stefanie Berberabe (Joondalup Wolves)\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
