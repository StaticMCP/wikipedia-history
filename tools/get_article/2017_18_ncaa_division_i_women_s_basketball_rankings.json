the AP Poll. It is compiled by a rotating group of 31 college Division I head coaches. The poll operates by Borda count. Each voting member ranks teams from 1 to 25. Each team then receives points for their ranking in reverse order: Number 1 earns 25 points, number 2 earns 24 points, and so forth. The points are then combined and the team with the most points is then ranked No. 1; second most is ranked No. 2 and so forth. Only the top 25 teams with points are ranked, with teams receiving first-place votes noted the quantity next to their name. The maximum points a single team can earn is 775.\n|Week2Date = Nov. 21\n|Week3Date = Nov. 28\n|Week4Date = Dec. 5\n|Week5Date = Dec. 12\n|Week6Date = Dec. 19\n|Week7Date = Dec. 26\n|Week8Date = Jan.
