The conflict resulted in a minor Russian success. It followed the action at Hollabrun and Schöngrabern, and preceded the Battle of Austerlitz. The relatively easy Russian victory convinced the Third Coalition Allies that the French army would be easy to beat, having reached the end of their supply and communication lines and having suffered several losses in previous weeks of fighting.\nOrders of Battle\nFrench forces\n*General of Division Frédéric Henri Walther\n**Division of Reserve Cavalry\n*General of Division Antoine Charles Louis de Lasalle\n**Division of Lannes' V Corps\n***6th and 11th  Dragoons (4 squadrons each)\n***9th and 10th Hussar Regiments (4 squadrons each), and\n***22nd Chasseurs Chevalier (4 squadrons)\n***12 guns\nTotal: 20 squadrons, 12 guns, approximately 1400 men.\n11th Dragoons lost an Imperial Eagle and a guidon during the fight.\nRussian forces\nAdvanced Guard\n*Lieutenant General Bagration commanding\n**Major Generals Dolgoruky, Ulanius, and Tschaplitz\n***6th Jägers (3 battalions)\n***9 battalions of the Infantry Regiments Alt-Ingermannland, Archangel, and Pskov\n***Leib Kür Regiment (4 squadrons)\n***Dragoon Regiment Twer (5 squadrons)\n***Dragoon Regiment St. Petersburg (5 squadrons)\n***Hussar Regiment Pavlograd (10 Squadrons\n***Hussar Regiment Mariupol (10 squadrons)\n***Cossacks (8 sotnia)\n***24 guns\nTotal: 12 battalions, 35 squadrons, and 8 sotnias, 24 guns, approximately 12,000 men.\nSources\n* Digby Smith.
