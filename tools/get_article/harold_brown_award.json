It is named for Harold Brown, a physicist who served as United States Secretary of the Air Force  from 1965-1969, and later as United States Secretary of Defense (1977-1981).\nThe Harold Brown award is presented annually to a person whose achievements in research and development have led to, or demonstrated promise of, a substantial improvement in the operational effectiveness of the Air Force. It is awarded through the United States Air Force chief scientist's office.\nThe winner of the award receives a brass medallion set in a block of Lucite and a certificate signed by the Secretary of the Air Force and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force. The name of the winner is also engraved on a plaque near the office of the Secretary of the Air Force and he or she may also wear the Air Force Recognition Ribbon (military) or Air Force Recognition Lapel Pin (civilian) as appropriate.\nList of recipients\nRecipients of the Harold Brown Award include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"10%\"|Year\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"15%\"|Name\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"75%\"|Notes\n|-\n|1969\n|Ronald W.
