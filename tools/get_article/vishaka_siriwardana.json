Her mother was Donna Lizzie Siriwardena and father was Desai Sarath Siriwardena. She was educated at Katupotha Tissa Maha Vidyalaya.\nShe was married to Daya Dharmasiriwardena. Daya was involved with a terrible road accident and as a result, he had to have one of his legs amputated.\nShe was being treated for a cancerous condition for long time, but continued to work in the industry. However, she died on 23 October 2021 at the age of 66, while receiving treatment at the Kurunegala Teaching Hospital. Her remains were laid to rest at the Kurunegala Municipal Council Florist Hall from 8.00 am to 5.00 pm on 24 October 2021. Funeral function was performed on 25 October 2021 at Katupotha Cemetery.\nCareer\nShe entered drama by accident. One day, Vishaka heard that the film Wasanthaye Dawasak was being shot in her hometown of Katupotha, Kurunegala. She went there with a group of her friends and saw the cast of the film including queen actress Malini Fonseka. After seeing the shooting, she also wanted to be an actress. Film director Siri Kularatne's brother was a classmate of Visakha, whereby he helped Vishaka to meet Siri Kularatne. Then Kularatne selected Visakha for his latest film Anuradha and she made her film debut along with Malini Fonseka which was shot in 1981. But her first screened film is Saaranga in 1981 directed by Gamini Hewawitharana.\nAfter the success of the film, she starred in the films, such as, Sanasanna Maa, and Yahalu Yeheli, both in 1982.

Later Visakha won the Sarasaviya Award for Best Emerging Actress for her performance in the film Sasara Chethana in 1985 at the 13th Sarasaviya Awards. She continued to receive invitations to films, but due to her husband's accident, she could not contribute to them. After that transition period, she returned to cinema with the film Sandamadala directed by Malani Fonseka. In 1986, she won the Best Performance Award at the 13th OCIC Award Ceremony for her role in Sura Duthiyo. Then she acted in the films such as, Puthuni Mata Samavenna, Sura Duthiyo, Asipatha Mamai, Sathyagrahanaya, Kristhu Charithaya, Cheriyo Doctor, Yasoma and Bheeshanaye Athuru Kathawak.\nApart from cinema, she made notable appearances in the television particularly through villain roles.
