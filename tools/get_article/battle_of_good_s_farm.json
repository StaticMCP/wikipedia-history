During the fighting, Confederate cavalry officer Turner Ashby was killed.\nWyndham’s Attack\nOn June 6, 1862, a company of the 1st New Jersey Cavalry Regiment attacked Confederate scouts stationed in Harrisonburg. Chasing the enemy to Good’s Farm on the outskirts of town, the company was fired upon by infantry of the 58th Virginia concealed behind two stone walls on either side of the road. The cavalry notified their commander Colonel Percy Wyndham, who marched with his soldiers towards the scene of the ambush. They then charged some woods atop a hill where the 7th Virginia Cavalry under Colonel Turner Ashby had blocked the road.\nAs soon as the 1st New Jersey began their charge the Confederate infantry again fired on them, this time from behind a fence concealed by woods. In an attempt to remove the Infantry, Colonel Wyndham dismounted and led a charge into the enemy line. However, finding the enemy too well concealed and being flanked by Ashby’s Cavalry, the 1st New Jersey started a hasty and disorganized retreat. In the end they had left behind Colonel Wyndham, 3 Captains, the regimental colours, and about a twelfth of their men.\nKane’s Attack\nMeanwhile, Colonel Thomas L. Kane of the 13th Pennsylvania Reserves or “Bucktails”, received permission to rescue the wounded from the field from Brigadier General George D. Bayard. Soon after, Bayard, the 1st Pennsylvania Cavalry, and the 13th Pennsylvania Reserves moved forward to Ashby’s position.\nFrom his position, General Bayard saw reinforcements from the 1st Maryland Infantry (Confederate) arrive. He promptly ordered the cavalry to fall back and sent a messenger to Colonel Kane, who had already entered the woods with his men.\nThe Bucktails hid behind trees at the edge of the woods and began firing into the Confederates, causing a number of casualties and checking their advance. Seeing his men falter, Ashby moved towards the front of the line on foot, his horse having been shot out from under him. He was attempting to rally his men when a combatant shot him directly through the heart, killing him instantly.\nThe origin of the fatal shot has been lost to history. Soldiers of the 13th Pennsylvania Reserves claimed credit, though some accounts blame friendly fire. Ashby's last words were \"Forward my brave men!\" He had been nominated for promotion to brigadier general just ten days before his death.\nThe 58th Virginia and the 1st Maryland Infantry Regiment (Confederate) counterattacked. Flanked and outnumbered, the 13th Pennsylvania Reserves retreated. Colonel Thomas L. Kane, wounded in the leg, and Captain Charles Frederick Taylor were both captured by the enemy.\nat the site of Ashby's death]]\nReferences"
