She appears in British-origin online sources between 1789 and 1792. She arrived in Britain from the whale fishery. After she arrived in Britain she made two more voyages as a whaler in the British southern whale fishery. She was last listed in 1796 with stale data.\nCareer\nQueen Charlotte arrived in London on 24 February 1789 from the Southern Whale Fishery. Her captain was William Lucas and her owner Oliver & Co. She had gathered two tuns of sperm oil, 90 tuns of whale oil, 40 cwt of whale bone, and 6500 seal skins. She had been reported whaling off the Falklands in 1786. However, she did not appear in ''Lloyd's List or Lloyd's Register (LR) before 1789, suggesting that she was not operating out of England; probably she was sailing out of Bermuda.\nQueen Charlotte first appeared in LR in 1789.\nQueen Charlotte'', of about 300 tons burthen, \"Plantation built\", was offered for auction on 11 August 1789  \"by the candle\" at Lloyd's Coffee House. The advertisement stated that she was suitable for whaling in the southern fishery as she had been recently employed in that trade.\n{| class=\" wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Master\n! Owner\n! Trade\n!
