In 2006, an award for Best Solo Show was given for the first time.\nAward winners are chosen by a panel consisting of the newspaper's principal Fringe reviewers and are usually announced in a ceremony on the last Sunday of the Fringe Festival. There have been only two Joint Winners awarded, in 1998 and 1999.\nAward winners\nBest Actor\n* 1995: Mark Pinkosh for Road Movie\n* 1996: Edward Halstead for Bartleby\n* 1997: John Stahl for Anna Weiss\n* 1998: Chris Pickles for Love!
