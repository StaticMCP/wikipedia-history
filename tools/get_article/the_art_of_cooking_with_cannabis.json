This is her fifth cookbook.\nSynopsis\nThe book is arranged by geographical region, and includes profiles of the featured brands and chefs. One section is devoted to hemp as food, another to the compound CBD found in cannabis, and another to THC also found in the plant.\nCritical reception\nA reviewer noted the author's use of terpene-focused recipes for flavor. Esquire said that it was \"like a traditional cookbook your gran would keep on her bookshelf. A really cool gran\", and identified it as one of the best 15 cookbooks of 2021.\nThe Los Angeles Times praised the book for showcasing a wide range of recipes, outside the usual \"tired pot-brownie cliché\".\nSee also\n*List of books about cannabis\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n* at Skyhorse"
