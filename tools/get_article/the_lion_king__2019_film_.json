Directed by Jon Favreau, written by Jeff Nathanson, and produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Fairview Entertainment, the film stars the voices of Donald Glover, Seth Rogen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Alfre Woodard, Billy Eichner, John Kani, John Oliver, Florence Kasumba, Eric André, Keegan-Michael Key, JD McCrary, Shahadi Wright Joseph, with Beyoncé Knowles-Carter, and James Earl Jones (reprising his voice role as Mufasa for the final time). The plot follows a young lion, Simba, who flees his kingdom when his father, Mufasa, is murdered by his uncle, Scar. After growing up in exile, Simba returns home to confront his uncle and reclaim his throne.\nPlans for a remake of 1994's The Lion King were confirmed in September 2016 following box office successes for Disney remakes such as The Jungle Book (2016). Favreau was inspired by certain roles of characters in the Broadway adaptation and developed upon elements of the original film's story. Much of the main cast signed on in early 2017, and principal photography began in mid-2017 on a blue screen stage in Los Angeles. The virtual reality tools utilized in The Jungle Books cinematography were used to a greater degree during the filming of The Lion King. Composers Hans Zimmer, Elton John, and lyricist Tim Rice returned to compose the score alongside Knowles-Carter, who assisted John in the reworking of the soundtrack and wrote a new song for the film, \"Spirit\", which she also performed. With a production budget of $250–260 million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever made, as well as the most expensive Disney remake.\nThe Lion King premiered in Hollywood, Los Angeles on July 9, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 19, in the Dolby Cinema, RealD 3D, and IMAX formats. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with many criticizing the lack of originality and for being nearly identical to the original. However, it grossed over $1.6&nbsp;billion worldwide during its theatrical run, and broke several box-office records, including becoming the highest-grossing animated film of all time from August 2019 to September 2024, the seventh-highest-grossing film at the time of its release, and the second-highest-grossing film of 2019. The film received nominations for Best Animated Feature Film and Original Song categories at the 77th Golden Globe Awards and 25th Critics' Choice Awards. It was also nominated at 73rd British Academy Film Awards and 92nd Academy Awards, both for visual effects. A follow-up, Mufasa: The Lion King, a film which serves as both a prequel and a sequel, was directed by Barry Jenkins and released on December 20, 2024.\nPlot\nIn the Pride Lands of Tanzania, a pride of lions rule over the kingdom from Pride Rock. King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi's newborn son, Simba, is presented to the gathering animals by Rafiki the mandrill, the kingdom's shaman and advisor. Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, covets the throne.\nMufasa shows Simba the Pride Lands and forbids him from exploring beyond its borders. He explains to Simba the responsibilities of kingship and the \"circle of life\", which connects all living things. Scar manipulates Simba into exploring an elephant graveyard beyond the Pride Lands. There, Simba and his best friend, Nala, are chased by a clan of spotted hyenas led by the ruthless Shenzi. Mufasa is alerted by his majordomo, the hornbill Zazu, and rescues the cubs. Though disappointed with Simba for disobeying him and endangering himself and Nala, Mufasa forgives him. He explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba. Scar visits the hyenas and convinces them to help him kill Mufasa and Simba in exchange for hunting rights in the Pride Lands.\nScar sets a trap for Simba and Mufasa. He lures Simba into a gorge and signals the hyenas to drive a large herd of wildebeest into a stampede to trample him. Scar alerts Mufasa, who saves Simba and tries to escape the gorge; he begs for Scar's help, but Scar betrays Mufasa by throwing him into the stampede to his death. Scar then deceives Simba into believing that Mufasa's death was his fault and tells him to leave the kingdom and never return. He then orders the hyenas to kill Simba, who escapes. Unaware of Simba's survival, Scar tells the pride that the stampede killed both Mufasa and Simba, and steps forward as the new king, allowing the hyenas into the Pride Lands.\nSimba collapses in a desert but is rescued by two outcasts, a meerkat and a warthog named Timon and Pumbaa. Simba grows up with his two new friends in their oasis, living a carefree life under their motto \"hakuna matata\" (\"no worries\" in Swahili). Meanwhile, Scar attempts to convince Sarabi to be his queen, but she refuses. Years later, an adult Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who is revealed to be Nala. Simba and Nala fall in love, and she urges him to return home, telling him that the Pride Lands have become drought-stricken under Scar's reign. Still feeling guilty over Mufasa's death, Simba refuses and leaves angrily. He encounters Rafiki, who tells Simba that Mufasa's spirit lives on in him. Simba is visited by the spirit of Mufasa in the night sky, who tells him that he must take his place as king. After Rafiki advises him to learn from the past instead of running from it, Simba decides to return to the Pride Lands.\nAided by his friends, Simba sneaks past the hyenas at Pride Rock and confronts Scar, who shames Simba over his supposed role in Mufasa's death. Scar then reveals to Simba that he killed Mufasa. Enraged, Simba retaliates and forces Scar to confess the truth to the pride. A battle ensues between Simba and his allies and the hyenas. Scar attempts to escape, but is cornered by Simba at a ledge near the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and attempts to deceive Simba by blaming his actions on the hyenas. Simba spares Scar's life but orders him to leave the Pride Lands forever; Scar refuses and attacks Simba. Following a brief battle, Simba throws Scar off the ledge. Scar survives the fall, but the hyenas, who overheard him betraying them, attack and maul him to death.\nWith Scar and the hyenas gone, Simba takes his place as king, and Nala becomes his queen. With the Pride Lands restored, Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the assembled animals, thus continuing the circle of life.\nVoice cast\nList of The Lion King (franchise) characters}}\n* Donald Glover as Simba, a young lion prince and the son of Mufasa and Sarabi who grows up to become the future king of the Pride Lands. Glover said that the film will focus more on Simba's time growing up than the original film did, stating that \"[Favreau] was very keen in making sure we saw [Simba's] transition from boy to man and how hard that can be when there's been a deep trauma\".\n** JD McCrary as Simba as a cub.\n* Seth Rogen as Pumbaa, a good-humored warthog who befriends and adopts Simba after he runs away from home. He also becomes one of Simba's best friends. Rogen said, \"[a]s an actor, I [...] don't think I'm right for every role—there are a lot of roles I don't think I'm right for even in movies I'm making—but Pumbaa was one I knew I could do well\". Favreau encouraged Rogen and Timon's Billy Eichner, who did their voice recordings together, to improvise a lot. Rogen's casting would also mark the first time that Pumbaa was not played by Ernie Sabella, who had reprised the role for every Disney project the character was involved in up to that point.\n* Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar, Mufasa's younger brother and rival who seizes the throne. Ejiofor described Scar as more \"psychologically possessed\" and \"brutalized\" than in the original film. Ejiofor said that \"especially with Scar, whether it's a vocal quality that allows for a certain confidence or a certain aggression, to always know that at the end of it you're playing somebody who has the capacity to turn everything on its head in a split second with outrageous acts of violence—that can completely change the temperature of a scene\". Ejiofor also said that \"[Scar and Mufasa's] relationship is completely destroyed and brutalized by Scar's way of thinking. He's possessed with this disease of his own ego and his own want\". Favreau said of casting Ejiofor, \"[He] is just a fantastic actor, who brings us a bit of the mid-Atlantic cadence and a new take on the character. He brings that feeling of a Shakespearean villain to bear because of his background as an actor. It's wonderful when you have somebody as experienced and seasoned as Chiwetel; he just breathes such wonderful life into this character.\"\n* Alfre Woodard as Sarabi, Mufasa's mate, Simba's mother, and the leader of the lioness hunting party.\n* Billy Eichner as Timon, a wise-cracking meerkat who befriends and adopts a young Simba after he runs away from home. Eichner described Timon as \"physically the smallest character, but he has one of the bigger personalities, and I love the combination of those two things. I kind of played into Timon, as I've done with many characters of mine, [the notion that] he might be small in stature but he has a huge sense of entitlement, which is always funny to play,\" and that \"when Timon speaks and when he's quote-unquote 'being funny', he's very loud and boisterous, but [his] singing allows this vulnerable side, a slightly softer side, especially in 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight' and other moments.\" Eichner also talked about having \"what some may consider a gay sensibility\" that he brought to the table when he voiced Timon.\n* John Kani as Rafiki, a wise mandrill who serves as the shaman of the Pride Lands and a close friend of Mufasa's. Likening his role to that of a grandfather, Kani said, \"Rafiki reminds all of us of that special wise relative. His wisdom, humor and his loyalty to the Mufasa dynasty is what warms our hearts towards him. [He's] always happy and wisecracking jokes as lessons of life and survival.\"\n* John Oliver as Zazu, a hornbill who serves as the majordomo to the King of the Pride Lands. Speaking of his role, Oliver said, \"I think Zazu is basically a bird who likes structure. He just wants things to be as they should be. I think there are British echoes there because we tend to favor structure in lieu of having an emotional reaction to anything.\"\n* Beyoncé Knowles-Carter as Nala, Simba's best friend and later his mate and Queen of the Pride Lands. According to Favreau, the character has a bigger role than in the original film. Favreau felt that \"part of [Beyoncé joining the film] is that she's got young kids, part of it is that it's a story that feels good for this phase of her life and her career, and she really likes the original very much. And then, of course, there are these wonderful musical numbers that she can be involved with, and my God... she really lives up to her reputation as far as the beauty of her voice and talent\".\n** Shahadi Wright Joseph as Nala as a cub. Joseph reprises her role from the Broadway production. Joseph chose to work on the film because \"Nala inspires little girls [...] She's a great role model\".\n* James Earl Jones as Mufasa, Simba's father, King of the Pride Lands as the film begins. Jones reprises his role from the original 1994 animated film. According to Favreau, Jones' lines remain mostly the same from the original film. Ejiofor said that \"the comfort of [Jones reprising his role] is going to be very rewarding in taking [the audience] on this journey again. It's a once-in-a-generation vocal quality\". Favreau saw Jones' return as \"carrying the legacy across\" the original film and the remake, and felt that his voice's change in tonality compared to the original film \"served the role well because he sounds like a king who's ruled for a long time\".\n* Florence Kasumba, Keegan-Michael Key, and Eric André voice Shenzi, Kamari, and Azizi: The Matriarch of the spotted hyena clan and her two lieutenants who join forces with Scar in order to kill Mufasa. While Shenzi is a character that was featured in the original 1994 animated film, Kamari and Azizi are the respective names of new characters loosely based on Banzai and Ed from the original film. The hyenas' characterizations were heavily altered from the original film's, as Favreau felt that they \"had to change a lot\" to fit the remake's realistic style, stating that \"[a] lot of the stuff around them [in the original film] was very stylised\". Kasumba elaborated, declaring that \"[t]hose hyenas were funny. These hyenas are dangerous.\" Kasumba also voices Shenzi in the German dub of the film.\nAdditionally, Penny Johnson Jerald voices Sarafina, Nala's mother. Amy Sedaris, Chance the Rapper, Josh McCrary, and Phil LaMarr voice a guineafowl, a bushbaby, an elephant shrew, and an impala, respectively, Timon and Pumbaa's neighbors in the oasis. J. Lee voices a hyena that chases after Timon and Pumbaa.\nProduction\nDevelopment\nOn September 28, 2016, Walt Disney Pictures confirmed that Jon Favreau would be directing a remake of the 1994 animated film The Lion King, which would feature the songs from the 1994 film, following a string of recent box office successes of Disney live-action remake films such as Maleficent, Cinderella, Favreau's The Jungle Book, and Beauty and the Beast, with the latter three also earning critical praise. On October 13, 2016, it was reported that Disney had hired Jeff Nathanson to write the screenplay for the remake.\nIn November, talking with ComingSoon.net, Favreau said the virtual cinematography technology he used in The Jungle Book would be used to a greater degree in The Lion King. Although some reports reported The Lion King would be a live-action film, it actually utilizes photorealistic computer-generated animation. Disney also did not initially describe it as live-action, only stating it would follow the \"technologically groundbreaking\" approach of The Jungle Book. While the film acts as a remake of the 1994 animated film, Favreau was inspired by the Broadway adaptation of the film for certain aspects of the remake's plot, particularly Nala and Sarabi's roles. Favreau also aimed to develop his own take on the original film's story with what he said was the spectacle of a BBC wildlife documentary.\nThis serves as the final credit for film editor Mark Livolsi, who died in September 2018. The film is dedicated to him.\nCasting\nIn mid-February 2017, Donald Glover was cast as Simba, with James Earl Jones reprising his role as Mufasa from the 1994 film. In April 2017, Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen were cast to play Timon and Pumbaa, respectively. In July 2017, John Oliver was cast as Zazu. In August 2017, Alfre Woodard and John Kani were announced to play Sarabi and Rafiki, respectively.\nEarlier in March 2017, it was announced that Beyoncé Knowles-Carter was Favreau's top choice for the role of Nala and that the director and studio would be willing to do whatever it took to accommodate her busy schedule. Later on November 1, 2017, her role was confirmed in an official announcement, which also confirmed that Chiwetel Ejiofor would play the role of Scar, and announced that Eric André, Florence Kasumba, and Keegan-Michael Key would be the voices of Azizi, Shenzi, and Kamari while JD McCrary and Shahadi Wright Joseph would be the voices of young Simba and young Nala, respectively. In November 2018, Amy Sedaris was announced as having been cast in a role created for the film. Director Jon Favreau stated that the film's predominantly black cast was a timely update that brought greater authenticity to the film's African inspirations.\nVisual effects\nThe Moving Picture Company, the lead vendor on The Jungle Book, provided the visual effects, which were supervised by Robert Legato, Elliot Newman, and Adam Valdez. The film uses \"virtual-reality tools\", according to Legato. Virtual Production Supervisor Girish Balakrishnan said on his professional website that the filmmakers used motion capture and VR/AR technologies. According to Favreau, MPC worked together with tech firms Magnopus and Unity Technologies to build the film's technology platform using the Unity game engine.\nMPC was in charge of all the VFX shots for the film. There are 1,490 VFX shots. The animals were designed from art and photo references. From that, the characters were built; all the rigging, shapes, textures, and furs were rendered step-by-step for further improvement. After that, the animation of the animals was crafted by hand, based on the reference clips. The movements, muscles, eyes, facial expressions, and the way the animals breathe was animated for more than 30 species. The environment was created entirely in CGI from reference materials such as high-definition photos of the African landscape. All the FX simulations—such as water, dirt and fire—were created by combining VR technology with cameras shots so that scenes could be digitally built within a VR-simulated environment. New software developed for the movie made it possible to create scenes with the shaky-cam look of a handheld camera. Sean Bailey, Disney's President of Production, said of the film's visual effects, \"It's a new form of filmmaking. Historical definitions don't work. It uses some techniques that would traditionally be called animation, and other techniques that would traditionally be called live action. It is an evolution of the technology Jon [Favreau] used in Jungle Book\".\nRather than have animators do everything, the team used artificial intelligence to allow virtual characters to behave in ways that mimicked real animals. The sole non-animated shot in the entire film is the sunrise in the opening scene.\nMusic\nThe Lion King (2019 soundtrack)|The Lion King: The GiftThe Lion King: The Gift}}\n'', an album inspired by the film]]\nHans Zimmer, who composed the 1994 animated version, returned to compose the score for the remake with Pharrell Williams as a collaborator. Elton John also returned to rework his musical compositions from the original film before his retirement, with Knowles-Carter assisting John in the reworking of the soundtrack. John, the original film's lyricist, Tim Rice, and Knowles-Carter were also slated in 2018 to create a new song for the film. However, the collaboration between Knowles-Carter and John did not pan out as the unreleased song was not added to the official soundtrack. John and Rice also wrote a new song for the film's end credits, titled \"Never Too Late\" and performed by John.\n\"Spirit\", performed by Knowles-Carter and written by herself, Ilya Salmanzadeh, and Labrinth, was released on July 9, 2019, as the lead single from the soundtrack. The film also features all the songs from the original film, a cover of The Tokens' \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\", and the song \"He Lives in You\" from Rhythm of the Pride Lands and the Broadway production. The soundtrack, featuring Zimmer's score and John and Rice's songs, was released digitally on July 11, 2019, and physically on July 19, 2019.\nKnowles-Carter also produced and curated an album titled The Lion King: The Gift, which features \"Spirit\", as well as songs inspired by the film. The album was released on July 19, 2019.\nMarketing\nThe first teaser trailer and the official teaser poster for The Lion King debuted during the Dallas Cowboys' annual Thanksgiving Day game on November 22, 2018.

On December 23, 2018, Sean Bailey, Disney's President of Production, said that while the film will \"revere and love those parts that the audience wants\", there will be \"things in the movie that are going to be new\". On April 18, 2019, Favreau stated that \"some shots in the 1994 animated film are so iconic\" he couldn't possibly change them, but \"despite what the trailers suggest, this film is not just the same movie over again\", and later said \"it's much longer than the original film. And part of what we're doing here is to (give it more dimension) not just visually but both story-wise and emotionally.\"\nOn May 30, 2019, Favreau said that some of the humor and characterizations are being altered to be more consistent with the rest of the film, and this remake is making some changes in certain scenes from the original film, as well as in its structure. On June 14, 2019, Favreau said that, while the original film's main plot points would remain unchanged in the remake, the film would largely diverge from the original version, and hinted that the Elephant Graveyard, the hyenas' lair in the original film, will be replaced by a new location. The film is approximately 30 minutes longer than the original. Despite Favreau's claims, upon release, the film was criticized by fans and critics alike for being nearly identical to the original, with many citing its overall lack of originality as a major flaw.\nRelease\nTheatrical\nThe Lion King premiered in Hollywood on July 9, 2019.

But I missed the simplicity and vividness of the original hand-drawn images.\" Among the vocal performances, the roles of Eichner and Rogen as Timon and Pumbaa, respectively, received particular praise by critics, with The A.V. Clubs A. A. Dowd proclaiming: \"Ultimately, only Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen, as slacker sidekicks Timon and Pumbaa, make much of an impression; their funny, possibly ad-libbed banter feels both fresh and true to the spirit of the characters — the perfect remake recipe.\"\nWilliam Bibbiani of TheWrap wrote in his review, \"Jon Favreau's remake looks incredibly literal, but the digital animal performers lack the facial expressions and body movement to tell the story.\" Sreeparna Sengupta of The Times of India praised the film, giving it a score of 3.5/5 and stating \"For those who haven't seen the original, 'The Lion King' (2019) is certainly worth a watch for its gorgeous visuals and technical genius.\" Helen O'Hara of Empire gave the film 3/5 stars, saying, \"The great circle of life has thrown up a gorgeous, star-studded story, but trading feeling for realism means that we lose something of the original film's excellence.\" Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film 3/4 stars, saying, \"The worst thing you can say about this movie, and perhaps the highest compliment you can pay it, is to say it would be even more dazzling if it told a different story with different animals and the same technology and style — and maybe without songs, because you don't necessarily need them when you have images that sing.\" Kevin Maher of The Times gave the film 4/5 stars, praising it as an improvement over the original, though he criticized the ending as \"descend[ing] into a sprawling Avengers-style donnybrook with little dramatic resonance.\" Edward Porter of The Sunday Times gave the film 3/5 stars, praising the visuals and performances, but criticizing the lack of expressiveness of the characters' faces.\nA. A. Dowd, writing for The A.V. Club, summarized the film as such: \"Joyless, artless, and maybe soulless, it transforms one of the most striking titles from the Mouse House vault into a very expensive, star-studded Disneynature film.\" Dowd bemoaned the film's insistence on realism, commenting, \"We're watching a hollow bastardization of a blockbuster, at once completely reliant on the audience's pre-established affection for its predecessor and strangely determined to jettison much of what made it special.\" Scott Mendelson at Forbes condemned the film as a \"crushing disappointment\": \"At almost every turn, this redo undercuts its own melodrama by downplaying its own emotions.\" David Ehrlich of IndieWire panned the film, writing, \"Unfolding like the world's longest and least convincing deepfake, Jon Favreau's (almost) photorealistic remake of The Lion King is meant to represent the next step in Disney's circle of life. Instead, this soulless chimera of a film comes off as little more than a glorified tech demo from a greedy conglomerate — a well-rendered but creatively bankrupt self-portrait of a movie studio eating its own tail.\"\nElton John, who worked on the film's soundtrack, disowned the film and stated \"The new version of The Lion King was a huge disappointment to me, because I believe they messed the music up. Music was so much a part of the original and the music in the current film didn't have the same impact. The magic and joy were lost.\"\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width: 99%\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20%;\"| Award\n! scope=\"col\"| Date of ceremony\n! scope=\"col\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|People's Choice Awards\n|rowspan=\"3\"| November 10, 2019\n| Movie of 2019\n|rowspan=\"2\"| The Lion King\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"3\"|\n|-\n| Family Movie of 2019\n|\n|-\n| Animated Movie Star of 2019\n| Beyoncé\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Hollywood Music in Media Awards\n| November 20, 2019\n| Best Original Song&nbsp;– Feature Film\n| Ilya Salmanzadeh, Labrinth and Beyoncé (for \"Spirit\")\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Hollywood Post Alliance\n| November 21, 2019\n| Outstanding Visual Effects – Feature Film\n| The Lion King\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Guinness World Record\n| rowspan=\"1\"|2020\n| Highest-grossing remake at the global box office\n|The Lion King\n|\n|rowspan=1 style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Satellite Awards\n| rowspan=\"3\"|December 19, 2019\n| Best Animated or Mixed Media Feature\n| Jon Favreau\n|\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n| Best Original Song\n| Ilya Salmanzadeh, Labrinth and Beyoncé (for \"Spirit\")\n|\n|-\n| Best Visual Effects\n| Andrew R.

While The Hollywood Reporter said the film would be a prequel about Mufasa during his formative years, Deadline said it would be a sequel centering on both Mufasa's origins and the events after the first film, similar to The Godfather Part II. Jeff Nathanson, the screenwriter for the remake, has reportedly finished a draft. In August 2021, it was reported that Aaron Pierre and Kelvin Harrison Jr. had been cast as Mufasa and Scar respectively. The film is not a remake of ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride, the 1998 direct-to-video sequel to the original animated film. In September 2022 at the D23 Expo, it was announced that the film would be titled Mufasa: The Lion King'' and that it would follow the titular character's origin story. Seth Rogen, Billy Eichner, and John Kani reprised their roles as Pumbaa, Timon, and Rafiki, respectively. The film was released on December 20, 2024.\nReferences\nNotes\nCitations\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
