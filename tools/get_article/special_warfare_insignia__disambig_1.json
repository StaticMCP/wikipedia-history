In 1978, the silver SEAL insignia was abolished, with the Special Warfare insignia being issued solely in gold thereafter. The SEAL insignia is therefore unusual in the Navy, in that it is one of the very few breast insignia issued identically for both officers and enlisted personnel. This is partly due to the combined training both officers and enlisted men receive, side by side, when involved in BUD/S training.\nThe Special Warfare insignia consists of an eagle clutching a U.S. Navy anchor, trident, and flintlock-style pistol. This gold badge is considered a successor to the obsolete Underwater Demolition Insignia.\nDesignator and title\nSailors who complete BUD/S training at Coronado, California are reclassified to the Special Warfare Operator (SO) rating. Sailors must complete SEAL Qualification Training (SQT) before receiving Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) 5326 Combatant Swimmer (SEAL) or, in the case of commissioned naval officers, the designation 1130 Naval Special Warfare (SEAL) Officer. Prior to the establishment of the SO rating in 2006, SEAL operators were sourced from regular Naval ratings, with the title of SEAL treated like a warfare qualification, attaching (SEAL) after the rating.\nSee also\n*Special warfare combatant-craft crewmen\n*List of United States Navy enlisted warfare designations\n*Badges of the United States Navy\n*Military badges of the United States\n*Obsolete badges of the United States military\n*Uniforms of the United States Navy\n*List of United States Navy SEALs\n*\nNotes\nReferences\n* National Archives and Records Administration, Military Personnel Records Center (U.S. Navy Breast Insignia Descriptions)"
