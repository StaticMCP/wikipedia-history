      "text": "# Warm (Herb Alpert album)\n\nWarm is a 1969 album by Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass. It reached number 28 on the Billboard 200 album chart.\nBackground\nWarm was a vast departure from previous Tijuana Brass albums and featured much slower-paced songs, leaning more toward a Brazilian type of sound. At this point in his career, Alpert had grown tired of the band's previous style of music, feeling that it was repetitive, and wanted to try a different direction.\nThe opening track, \"The Sea Is My Soil\", is among the longest songs ever released by the Tijuana Brass at four and a half minutes, while two songs on the album feature lead vocals by Alpert (\"Without Her\" and \"To Wait for Love\"), all of which were released as singles.\nCritical reception\n}}\nIn his review for Allmusic, music critic Richard S. Ginell called the album mellow, richly textured, but noted it \"couldn't crack the Top 20, for the Brass' cross-generational appeal was fading fast.\"\nTrack listing\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Track\n!Title\n!Composers\n!Time\n|-\n|1\n|The Sea Is My Soil\n|Dory Caymmi, Nelson Mota\n|4:30\n|-\n|2\n|Without Her\n|Harry Nilsson\n|3:24\n|-\n|3\n|Marjorine\n|Sol Lake\n|3:06\n|-\n|4\n|Girl Talk\n|Neal Hefti, Bobby Troup\n|2:54\n|-\n|5\n|Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\n|John Lennon, Paul McCartney\n|1:59\n|-\n|6\n|Zazueira\n|Jorge Ben\n|3:14\n|-\n|7\n|The Continental\n|Herb Magidson, Con Conrad\n|2:07\n|-\n|8\n|Pretty World\n|Antonio Adolfo, Tiberio Gaspar, Alan Bergman, Marilyn Bergman\n|3:46\n|-\n|9\n|Warm\n|Julius Wechter\n|2:33\n|-\n|10\n|To Wait for Love\n|Burt Bacharach, Hal David\n|2:59\n|-\n|11\n|Sandbox\n|John Pisano\n|3:24\n|}\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
