It won the 2006 Shogakukan Manga Award for children's manga.\nOricon notes that while actors releasing music as their characters have been notable, Kusumi portraying Kirari Tsukishima in voice and in a real-world context pioneered the \"idol voice actor\" crossover beginning in the late 2000s, along with Aya Hirano from the Haruhi Suzumiya series. Parallels have been drawn between Kusumi and Kirari, citing their similarities in age, career, and process of becoming an idol, which led Kusumi to be closely associated with the character. In the week of December 24–30, 2007, the Kirarin Revolution anime series had an average viewership rating of 2.6%. Kusumi was named #17 in Daitan Map's \"Top 50 Voice Actors of Popular Characters\" in 2007 for her role as Kirari.\nOn his review of the first volume, Carlo Santos from Anime News Network highlighted the focus on friendship, the story's light-hearted tone, and clean artwork as attractive to young readers; at the same time, Santos mentions the story presents a wish fulfillment fantasy and advises critics of the idol industry to \"avoid the series entirely.\" Kirarin Revolution was ranked #6 on Anime News Network's list of \"6 Idols that Fandom Forgot\", with Lynzee Loveridge stating that despite the series' long run, it failed to attract an audience outside of its target demographic and was quickly forgotten after its end.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110815220912/http://www.kirarevo.com/ Kirarin Revolution Official web site - Japan]\n* [http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/kirarin/ TV Tokyo Kirarin Revolution Official Homepage - Japan]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/200804100708/http://www.konami.jp/gs/game/kirarin/index.html Konami's Kirarin Revolution-Nintendo Konami video game profile - 2008April 1st]\n*"
