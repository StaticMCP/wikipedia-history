It is operated by the Institute of Radio Astronomy and Space Research of Auckland University of Technology and was constructed in 2008.\nTechnical information\nThe 12m diameter antenna was designed and constructed by COBHAM Satcom.\nThe antenna is a fully steerable dual shaped Cassegrain with a main dish diameter of 12.1m and a secondary reflector diameter of 1.8m. The focal Length is 4.538m. The surface precision is 0.35mm (RMS) and the pointing accuracy is 18 inches.\nIt operates in the L-Band, S-Band and X-Band with dual polarisation S and X-band feeds from COBHAM with room temperature receivers. The receiver systems cover 2.2 to 2.4&nbsp;GHz at S-band and 8.1 to 9.1&nbsp;GHz at X-band.\nIt is mounted alt-azimuth and has slewing rates of 5 deg/s in azimuth and 1.25 deg/s in elevation, and acceleration of 1.3 deg/s/s.\nResearch activity\nIn 2010 this dish was used for several very-long-baseline interferometry(VLBI) observations in conjunction with the Australian Long Baseline Array.\nFrom 2011 it was a part of the International VLBI Service for Geodesy and Astrometry. It is also co-located with a Land Information New Zealand and GNS Science 'PositioNZ' Global Navigation Satellite System station, to assist in maintaining the International Terrestrial Reference Frame.\nSee also\n* Warkworth Radio Astronomical Observatory\n* Warkworth 30m Radio Telescope\n* Radio astronomy\n* Radio telescope\n* List of radio telescopes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* http://www.irasr.aut.ac.nz"
