Built in 1987 and opened in 1988, it incorporates some elements of Turkish architecture and is one of the most prominent landmarks of Riyadh.\nThe mosque usually gets flocked by worshippers during the month of Ramadan to perform Taraweeh prayers and on religious holidays like Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha for Salat al-Eid. It is locally known for providing Islamic funerary services to the deceased, such as ritual baths and prayers and is named after King Khalid bin Abdulaziz, whose relatives funded the mosque's construction.\nHistory\nThe mosque was funded by relatives of King Khalid bin Abdulaziz, the ruler of Saudi Arabia from 1975 to 1982; and was built in 1987 and officially inaugurated on 14 April 1988. The following day, the mosque's inaugural sermon was held by Sheikh Abd al-Aziz Ibn Baz.\nThe mosque underwent expansion in 1993 when the women's section was added, and again in 2004. In April 2022, the French ambassador to Saudi Arabia paid a visit to the mosque.\nSee also\n}}\n* Islam in Saudi Arabia\n* List of mosques in Saudi Arabia\n* List of things named after Saudi kings\nReferences"
