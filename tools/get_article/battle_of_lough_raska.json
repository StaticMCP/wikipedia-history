It was part of a fight for control of the Uí Briain chieftaincy and part of the Anglo-Norman wars in Ireland. Forces loyal to Muircheartach Ó Briain were commanded by Diarmait Ó Briain in a pitched battle against Donnchadh Ó Briain, who was an ally of Mathghamhain Ó Briain and Richard de Clare. Both armies were about 9,000 men each. Diarmait Ó Briain's forces were victorious. This would be a precursor to the Battle of Dysert O'Dea.\nReferences"
