Many malls open early so that people may mall walk; stores and other such facilities generally do not open at this time, though vending machine concessions are available. Many choose to mall walk as the indoor climate is comfortable, secure, and there is easy access to amenities, such as benches, toilets, Wi-Fi for fitness tracking, media access, and water fountains. Others are attracted to mall walking strictly for the opportunity to spectate other visitors of the mall. Clean and level surfaces also provide a safe walking environment.\nMall walking is undertaken individually, in groups, or as part of an organized mall walking program. Mall walking in the United States is especially popular amongst senior citizens. Many mall walkers cite the camaraderie of walking in groups.\nIn popular culture\nMall walking was featured in the television show Better Call Saul on episode 9 of season 3, named \"Fall\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/03/28_baxtera_corringham/ \"The art of mall walking\"], Annie Baxter, Minnesota Public Radio"
