Their enmity is so deep that each harbors a deep hatred for the other. One has a son, the other a daughter. Despite helping in their respective stores, the children secretly fall in love. When the fathers discover their children's secret romance, they each one raises an objection, forbidding their child from associating with their enemy's offspring. Undeterred, the young couple devises a plan to save money and marry, eventually opening a store in direct competition to their parents' establishments.\nA travelling man comes to town and sells a supply of patent food choppers to each of the rival stores. A price-cutting war results from the popularity of the chopper and by the time that the son and daughter have been united in marriage and have started a store of their own, the rivals are each selling the food chopper at a loss from 20 to 25 cents. The young people secretly buy up all the choppers from each store at a price away below cost. When the two men become aware of the fact that they are both out of \"choppers\", and cannot secure additional ones from the factory inside of six months, they also realize the successful ruse of their children.
