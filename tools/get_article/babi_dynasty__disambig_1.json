The Babai community, originally of Afghan descent, largely resides in India and some parts of Pakistan. The community traces its royal origins to the dynasty founded by Sher Khanji Babi in 1654, who was himself a ruler from the dynasty's founding until 1690. The last Nawab of the British Indian princely state of Junagadh, Sir Muhammad Khanji, signed an Instrument of Accession and acceded his princely state of Junagadh, as well as its vassal state of Sardargadh, Bantva Manavadar, to the Dominion of Pakistan after the Partition of British India in 1947. However, the Dominion of India did not recognize the accession and annexed the princely state shortly afterwards.\nHistory\nThe Babai are a tribe of Pashtuns that originate in the Kalat region of the Zabul Province in southeastern Afghanistan. Babi or Babai are the mythical sons of Ghorghasht or Gharghashti. The first Babi is said to have entered Gujarat with Humayun. They claim to have come to India from Khorasan under the leadership of Usman Khan, a follower of Humayun, the second Mughal emperor. Bahadur Khanji Babi, son of Usman Khan, migrated to India and entered service under the Mughals. The hereditary title (Tribe) of Babi was conferred to him in 1554 from Emperor Humayun, for \"services against the Rana of Chittor\".\nSher Khanji Babi, the founder of the Babi dynasty in 1654 joined the service of Prince Murad Baksh in Kathiawar, the Imperial Viceroy and son of Shah Jahan. In Mughal sources, the members of the Babi tribe are recognized as \"Gujaratis\", due to their regional \"Gujarati\" identity, intermarriage and assimilation to its culture, and reference to their clan was mainly mentioned as a community within the different Gujarati subgroups, for example Shujaat Khan Gujarati of Ahmedabad. Aurangzeb also writes in the Ruqa'at-i Alamgiri: \"The 'Faujdarship' should be given to one of the Gujaratis: Safdar Khan-i Sani\", referring to Safdar Khan of the Babi tribe. They largely identified with those who had lived for generations in the country or were converts.\nAfter the collapse of the Mughal Empire, the Babis were involved in a struggle with the Gaekwad dynasty of the Maratha Empire for control of Gujarat. While the Marathas were successful in establishing control over all of Gujarat, the Babis retained sovereignty of the princely states of Junagadh, Radhanpur, Balasinor,  Manavadar, Bantva,  and Sardargadh.\nMembers of this dynasty ruled over the princely states of Junagadh, Radhanpur and Balasinor, as well as the small states of Bantva Manavadar,  Sardargarh.\nMembers of the Babi tribe are found throughout north Gujarat and Saurashtra. Iconic Bollywood actress Parveen Babi was of Babi lineage, but most contemporary Babis, barring those belonging to princely lineages, are in modest circumstances. Many are petty landowners, but there is marked urbanization among the Babi as well. Though the Babis observe a tradition of endogamy, there are cases of marriages with the Chauhan and Behlim communities, and they accept daughters from the Shaikhs and Sunni Bohras.\nNotable people\n*Sher Khanji Babi, Founder of the Babis in India\n*Imamuddin Murtaza Khan Babi of Pajod, known as:Ruswa Majhalumi\n*Ghulam Moinuddin Khanji of Bantva-Manavadar- India Capt Cricket, Hockey; President, Pakistan sports assn.\n*Parveen Babi, Indian film actress.\n*Muhammad Dilawar Khanji: 14th Governor of Sindh, Pakistan.\n* Muhammad Jehangir Khanji: Advisor to Chief Minister, Sindh.\n*Khan Saheb Hussainyawar Khanji Babi, chief of Sardargadh state\n*Sarwat Gilani Pakistani Actress.\nSee also\n* Pathans of Gujarat\n*List of Sunni dynasties\n* Nawab of Junagadh\n* Annexation of Junagadh\n* Babai (Pashtun tribe)\n* List of Pashtun empires and dynasties\n* Bantva-Manavadar\nReferences"
