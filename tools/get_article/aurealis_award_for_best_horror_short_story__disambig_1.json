To qualify, a work must have been first published by an Australian citizen or permanent resident between 1 January and 31 December of the corresponding year; the presentation ceremony is held the following year. It has grown from a small function of around 20 people to a two-day event attended by over 200 people.\nSince their creation in 1995, awards have been given in various categories of speculative fiction. Categories currently include science fiction, fantasy, horror, speculative young adult fiction—with separate awards for novels and short fiction—collections, anthologies, illustrative works or graphic novels, children's books, and an award for excellence in speculative fiction. The awards have attracted the attention of publishers by setting down a benchmark in science fiction and fantasy. The continued sponsorship by publishers such as HarperCollins and Orbit has identified the award as an honour to be taken seriously.\nThe results are decided by a panel of judges from a list of submitted nominees; the long-list of nominees is reduced to a short-list of finalists. Ties can occur if the panel decides both entries show equal merit, however they are encouraged to choose a single winner. The judges are selected from a public application process by the Award's management team.\nThis article lists all the short-list nominees and winners in the best horror short story category, as well as short stories that have received honourable mentions or have been highly commended. A work of fiction is defined as a short story if it is fewer than 40,000 words long. Since 2001, honourable mentions and high commendations have been awarded intermittently. Paul Haines has won the award four times, while three people have won the award twice – Simon Brown, Kaaron Warren and Sean Williams. Warren holds the record for most nominations, with nine. Robert Hood holds the record for most nominations without winning, having been a losing finalist four times.\nWinners and nominees\nIn the following table, the years correspond to the year of the story's eligibility; the ceremonies are always held the following year. Each year links to the corresponding \"year in literature\" article. Entries with a blue background have won the award; those with a white background are the nominees on the short-list. If the short story was originally published in a book with other stories rather than by itself or in a magazine, the book title is included after the publisher's name.\nWinners and joint winners\nNominees on the shortlist\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" width=\"85%\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! width=\"7%\"|Year\n! width=\"25%\"|Author(s)\n! width=\"35%\"|Short story\n! width=\"29%\"|Publisher or publication\n! width=\"4%\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" |\n| * ||  || Bambada Press (Olympia) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || MirrorDanse (The Man Who Lost Red) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Sybylla (''She's Fantastical) ||\n|-\n|  ||  ||  Reed Books (Dark House) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Penguin (Strange Fruit) ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" |\n| * ||  || Eidolon  ||\n|-\n|  ||  || F&SF (Vol 91 No 2) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Eidolon ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Bloodsongs ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Bloodsongs ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" |\n| * ||  || Eidolon ||\n|-\n|  ||  || MirrorDanse (Epiphanies of Blood) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Aurealis (#18) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Bloodsongs ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" |\n| * ||  || Bloodsongs ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Voyager (Dreaming Down-Under) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Moonstone (Fantastic Worlds) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Voyager (Dreaming Down-Under) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Aurealis (#22) ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" |\n|  & Simon Brown* ||  || Ticonderoga (New Adventures in Sci-Fi) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Longman (SpinOuts) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Gothic.net ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Harbinger ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Harbinger ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" |\n| * ||  || Altair ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Eidolon ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Ticonderoga Online ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Hodder (Tales from the Wasteland) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Aurealis ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" |\n| * ||  || Potato Monkey ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Orb ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Aurealis ||\n|-\n|  & Paul Collins ||  || Cosmos Books (Stalking Midnight) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || CSFG Publishing (Nor of Human...) ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" |\n| * ||  || Redsine ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Agog!
