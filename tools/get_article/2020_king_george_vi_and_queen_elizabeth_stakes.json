It was the 70th running of the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes.\nThe winner was Enable, a six-year-old bay mare trained at Newmarket by John Gosden, ridden by Frankie Dettori and owned by Khalid Abdullah. Enable's victory was a record-equalling seventh in the race for Dettori, the fifth for Gosden and the fourth for Khalid Abdullah. Enable became the first horse to win the King George three times, and the second six-year-old to win the race after Swain in 1998. The race was contested by only three runners, the smallest field in the event's history.\nRace details\n* Sponsor: QIPCO\n* Purse: £400,000; First prize: £226,840\n* Surface: Turf\n* Going: Good to Firm\n* Distance: 12 furlongs\n* Number of runners: 3\n* '''Winner's time: 2:28.92\nFull result\n{| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-  style=\"background:#7d7; text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"width:35px;\"| Pos.\n! style=\"width:45px;\"| Marg.\n! style=\"width:160px;\"| Horse (bred)\n! style=\"width:30px;\"| Age\n! style=\"width:160px;\"| Jockey\n! style=\"width:210px;\"| Trainer (Country)\n! style=\"width:50px;\"| Odds\n|-\n| 1\n|\n| Enable (GB)\n| 6\n| Frankie Dettori\n| John Gosden (GB)\n|\n|-\n| 2'\n| 5½''\n| Sovereign (IRE)\n| 4\n| William Buick\n| Aidan O'Brien (IRE)\n|\n|-\n| 3\n| 11\n| Japan (GB)\n| 4\n| Ryan Moore\n| Aidan O'Brien (IRE)\n|\n|}\nWinner's details\nFurther details of the winner, Enable\n* Sex: Mare\n* Foaled: 12 February 2014\n* Country: United Kingdom\n* Sire: Nathaniel\n* Owner: Khalid Abullah\n* Breeder: Juddmonte Farms\nReferences\nSee also\n*2020 British Champions Series"
