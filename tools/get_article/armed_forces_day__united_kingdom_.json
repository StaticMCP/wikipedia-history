Veterans' Day was first observed in 2006. Although an official event, it is not a public holiday in the UK. The name was changed to Armed Forces Day in 2009. Armed Forces Day has so far been observed on the last Saturday of June.\nOrigins\nPlans for a Veterans' Day were announced in February 2006 by then-Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, who said the aim was to ensure the contribution of veterans was never forgotten. The day is marked across the UK by local ceremonies and the presentation of medals to living ex-servicemen and women. The date of 27 June was chosen as it came the day after the anniversary of the first investiture of the Victoria Cross, in Hyde Park, London in 1857.\nVeterans' Day was created as a permanent extension of Veterans' Awareness Week first held in 2005. Armed Forces Day generally focuses on celebrating living current/ex servicemen & women, whereas Remembrance Day focuses on honouring the dead. Although it used to be called Veterans' Day in the UK, it is not the same as the United States' Veterans Day which is more similar to Remembrance Day in the Commonwealth.\nOn 25 June 2007 Jim Devine, the Member of Parliament for Livingston, tabled a House of Commons Early Day Motion calling for the day to be a public holiday, stating \"that this House recognises the outstanding contribution that veterans have made to the country; and believes that Veterans' Day should be a national public holiday across the United Kingdom.\"\nVeterans' Day\n2006\nThe first Veterans' Day in 2006 saw a series of events across the UK which included an event at the Imperial War Museum in London, which was attended by Lachhiman Gurung VC, a Nepalese recipient of the Victoria Cross, which was awarded for bravery in 1945 when he was a Rifleman in the 4th Battalion of The 8th Gurkha Rifles, British Indian Army during World War II in Burma (Myanmar), and Corporal Christopher Finney GC of the Blues and Royals who was awarded the George Cross for bravery under friendly fire during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Parades were held in Dundee and Staffordshire as well as a service at Westminster Abbey. There was also an evening reception at 10 Downing Street for representatives of veterans associations.\n2007\nThe 2007 national event was held in Birmingham as the start of a five-day event from 27 June to 1 July. In the morning there was a \"Parade of Standards\" which was led by The Central Band of the Royal Air Force, from the International Convention Centre (ICC) to the Hall of Memory in Centenary Square.\nThe day also included celebrations in Victoria Square where a Spitfire aircraft was on display and the Minister for Veterans Derek Twigg presented five Veterans' Badges and met the families of service personnel who died in the line of duty.\n2008\nFor the 2008 Veterans' Day, the national event was hosted in Blackpool as part of the resort's annual \"National Veterans' Week\" which ran from 21 to 29 June 2008.\nEvents were held throughout the UK and the day was promoted by a nationwide television advert. The National Veterans' Day Service was held at Blackpool Cenotaph, a Grade II Listed building which had just been restored, by North Pier on central promenade. The service was led by the Bishop of Blackburn and was attended by Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Derek Twigg and General Sir Richard Dannatt, the Chief of the General Staff, as well as Henry Allingham (at the time, he was the oldest surviving veteran of World War I). The service was followed by a \"Schools Veterans' Day Thank You\" performed by local school children.\nVarious other events were held throughout Blackpool during the day including a \"Badge Presentation ceremony\" in the Tower Ballroom with the Duchess of Cornwall presenting veteran badges to among others, Martin Bell. There was also a Veterans' Parade along the promenade and a Falklands War veteran abseiled down Blackpool Tower.\nThe weekly BBC Radio 2 programme Friday Night is Music Night was broadcast live from the Opera House presented by Ken Bruce with the BBC Concert Orchestra, Alfie Boe and Rebecca Thornhill. The Red Devils parachute display team performed an illuminated \"night time parachute drop\" outside North Pier and the day ended with a Firework Finale from the pier.\nOther events included a commemoration at Trafalgar Square in London.\nArmed Forces Day\n2009\nIn 2009 the name of the event was changed to Armed Forces Day, to raise awareness and appreciation for those on active duty. It took place on Saturday 27 June. The host town was Chatham, Kent with events elsewhere, including London.\n2010\nArmed Forces Day 2010 was held on Saturday 26 June, hosted in the Welsh capital of Cardiff.\nThe day-long celebrations included a military parade from Cardiff Castle to Cardiff Bay and the city's waterfront, where a range of events, activities and artistic performances were staged on land, sea and air. The parade was led by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. Royal Navy frigate HMS Kent was docked in Cardiff to take part in the events. An estimated 50,000 people attended the celebrations in the city.\nAmong the cities joining Cardiff in hosting events were Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Plymouth, Nottingham, Bristol and Manchester.\nEvents in Cardiff included:\n*A traditional Drumhead Service in Roald Dahl Plass\n*Fly-overs by the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, the Red Arrows and Helicopter Formation\n*Arena displays in Roald Dahl Plass including the Royal Marine Commando Display Team, and the Royal Marine Band\n*Military displays representing all of the armed forces throughout Cardiff Bay\n*Search and rescue Sea King rescue display on the water\n*The opportunity to go aboard HMS Kent docked in Roath Basin for the weekend\n*An evening of stage performances featuring The Soldiers and Welsh male voice choir Only Men Aloud!\n*A firework finale over the waters of Cardiff Bay\n2011\nArmed Forces Day 2011 took place on Saturday 25 June, with the main parade held on the Royal Mile in the Scottish capital of Edinburgh, which was that year's host city.

The PPU has argued the event \"has fuelled the rise of militarism in everyday life in the UK\" and \"presents children with a simplistic image of armed force as glamorous and fun\". In addition, the PPU has denounced the perceived failure of Armed Forces Day to support British veterans and criticises its compulsory nature in some locations. The PPU, along with other affiliated groups promoting pacifism in the UK, has regularly staged protests at Armed Forces Day events across Britain.\nIn Northern Ireland, Armed Forces Day is celebrated in some locations, including the town of Banbridge. However, the event has proved divisive, with unionists, including the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), largely supporting it and republicans, including Sinn Féin, mostly opposing it (due to some of the actions of the British military during the Troubles). In 2012, the Ministry of Defence requested that the day be marked in Belfast by flying the Armed Forces Flag for six days in the last week of June. The request was criticised by the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and Sinn Féin but supported by the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland (APNI) and the DUP. In 2020, the DUP attempted to pass legislation implementing the event in Belfast, which was supported by the APNI and opposed by the SDLP and the Green Party Northern Ireland. Sinn Féin politician Ciaran Beattie stated that \" [many] in [Belfast] will feel this is an offensive display, that it is unnecessary, that it will divide the city. It is unwanted, and it certainly won’t be supported by us\", adding that \"I’m sure the vast majority of nationalists out there think it is offensive\". The proposal narrowly failed in a vote held on 18 September 2020 at the Belfast City Hall.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.armedforcesday.org.uk/ Armed Forces Day website]\n*[http://www.facebook.com/armedforcesday/  Armed Forces Day Facebook page]\n*\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080612184447/http://www.veteransweek.co.uk/ 2008 Veterans' Week website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090216040435/http://veteransdaywales.co.uk/ Veterans' Day Wales website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20161105225340/http://www.andoverarmedforcesday.org.uk/ Andover Armed Forces Day website]"
