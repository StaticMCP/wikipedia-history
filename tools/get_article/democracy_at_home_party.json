It is the legal successor of the \"Democracy at Home\" Youth Movement (). Its president is Vasile Costiuc. It is a unionist party, supporting the unification of Moldova and Romania, and was defined by Deutsche Welle as right-wing populist.\nThe party participated in the 2019 Moldovan parliamentary election, obtaining the 11th place with a total of 4,463 (0.32%) votes. This represented an increase of 0.17% from the 2014 Moldovan parliamentary election, but this was not enough to exceed the minimum of 6% of the votes to enter the Parliament of Moldova. Its slogan during this election was .\nThe PPDA was part of the Union Political Movement (MPU), a political bloc established on 15 January 2020 to unite Moldova with Romania together with four other Moldovan political parties. At the time of its establishment, Costiuc declared that this was the first step towards \"the constitution of a large movement, with national support\" and that its aim was \"to stop the expansionism of the Russian Empire\". The MPU participated in the 2020 Moldovan presidential election through its candidate Dorin Chirtoacă. However, on 30 April 2021, the PPDA left the coalition composing the MPU as Costiuc considered the trajectories and objectives of both were not the same.\nIn the 2025 Moldovan parliamentary election, the party received 5.62% of the votes and won 6 seats. Moldovan NewsMaker journalist Ecaterina Dubasova described the PPDA's result as the election's main surprise, as polls gave the party 2–3% of the votes at most, below the 5% electoral threshold for entering the parliament. Costiuc was the first on the party's list of candidates, being followed by manager Sergiu Stefanco, international relations specialist Ana Țurcan Oboroc, philologist Valentina Meșină, lawyer Alexandru Chițu and politologist Alexandru Verșinin, who all also entered parliament. However, after the election, the ruling Party of Action and Solidarity filed a complaint to the Constitutional Court, asking for the invalidation of PPDA mandates, citing irregularities during the campaign, including support from the Romanian opposition politician George Simion. They also sanctioned the party over accused violations of the electoral code, removing their state funding.\nPositions\nAs a Moldovan–Romanian unionist conservative party, it has been backed by the AUR in Romania, whose leader called on Moldovans to support the party at the 2025 elections. On 22 October that year, the day of the session to establish the new legislature of the parliament, Costiuc stated that \"we declare ourselves pro-European opposition, to the pro-European government\".\nThe party's position on relations with Europe and Russia is ambiguous. While it was part of the pro-European Union Political Movement, it has been reported that party leader Vasile Costiuc has attended an event in Moscow organised by Aleksandr Kondyakov, a former advisor to Vladimir Putin. Journalist Sorin Ozon alleged that Kondyakov had been an agent of the KGB.\nThe party has declared its intention to join the European Conservatives and Reformists Party.\nElection results\nParliamentary elections\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n|+ Parliament\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Election\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Leader\n! colspan=\"5\" scope=\"col\" |Performance\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Rank\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Government\n|-\n!Votes\n!%\n!± pp\n!Seats\n!+/–\n|-\n!2014\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Vasile Costiuc\n|2,449\n|\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |New\n|}}\n|bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |New\n|16th\n|\n|-\n!2019\n|4,463\n|\n| 0.17\n|}}\n|\n|9th\n|\n|-\n!2021\n|21,255\n|\n| 1.13\n|}}\n|\n|7th\n|\n|-\n!2025\n|88,679\n|\n| 4.17\n|}}\n| 6\n|5th\n|\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
