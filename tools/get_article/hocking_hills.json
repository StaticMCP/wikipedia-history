The relatively extreme topography in this area is due to the Blackhand Sandstone (so named because of Native American graphics on the formation near Newark, Ohio), a particular formation that is thick, hard and weather-resistant, and so forms high cliffs and narrow, deep gorges.\nComponent open-space areas\nMost of the more scenic areas of the region are under state ownership, including:\n*Hocking Hills State Park (with five use areas: Ash Cave, Cedar Falls, Old Man's Cave, Rockhouse, and Cantwell Cliffs)\n*Hocking State Forest\n*Conkle's Hollow State Nature Preserve\n*Sheick Hollow State Nature Preserve (entry by permit only)\n*Little Rocky Hollow State Nature Preserve (entry by permit only)\n*Kessler Swamp State Nature Preserve\n*Lake Logan State Park\n*Wayne National Forest\n*Rockbridge State Nature Preserve\nThe core area also includes two privately owned preserves, Crane Hollow and Camp Oty-Okwa (owned by Big Brothers and Big Sisters of Central Ohio).\nThe geological series that forms the Hocking Hills extends south and west, gradually diminishing but still forming impressive bluffs and gorges in:\n*Clear Creek Metro Park, part of the Columbus and Franklin County Metropolitan Park District\n*Rising Park in Lancaster\n*Wahkeena Memorial State Nature Preserve in Fairfield County\n*Christmas Rocks State Nature Preserve in Fairfield County\n*Rhododendron Cove State Nature Preserve in Fairfield County\n*Shallenberger State Nature Preserve in Fairfield County\n*Saltpetre Cave State Nature Preserve in Hocking County\n*Boch Hollow State Nature Preserve (exposure is along the westernmost edge only) in Hocking County\n*Lake Katharine State Nature Preserve in Jackson County\n*Blackhand Gorge State Nature Preserve in Licking County\n*Liberty Wildlife Area in Jackson County\nThe Buckeye Trail, along with the North Country Trail and the American Discovery Trail, passes through the Hocking Hills region.\nHocking Hills area\nAlso nearby are:\n*Lake Hope State Park\n*Zaleski State Forest\n*Camp Wyandot\n*Tar Hollow State Park\n*Tar Hollow State Forest\n*Camp Akita (UCC church camp)\nClimate\nThe region has mild weather with an average rainfall of 40.3 inches per year and an average of about 175 sunny days per year.

The Shawnee people thought that a very narrow and straight creek above the waterfall on the Hockhocking River resembled a bottle's neck.\nOther notable settlers were George Starkey and Moses Dolson. The first election on county matters was held in Eby's mill near Queer Creek. The first post office in the area was called the \"Rockhouse\" and was located in Herschel Badford's home.\nHocking County formation\nHocking County was formed on March 1, 1818, from Ross, Athens, Fairfield and Logan. The county's boundaries and townships have not been altered since 1851. Due to its natural surroundings, it has become a tourist attraction.\nOutdoor activities\nVisitors can experience Hocking Hills through outdoor activities year round, including farmers' markets, wine tastings and train rides.
