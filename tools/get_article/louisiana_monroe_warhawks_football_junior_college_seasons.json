The school was known as Ouachita Parish Junior College from 1931 to 1934; Northeast Center of Louisiana State University from 1934 to 1948; Northeast Junior College of Louisiana State University in 1949; and Northeast Louisiana State College in 1950. During their junior college era, the Indians were led by head coach J. Paul Kemerer from 1931 to 1933 and by James L. Malone, who helmed the Indians for the next 20 seasons, until 1953. The Indians competed as an independent for all but their final season as a junior college in 1950 when they were a member of the Big Six Junior College Conference.\nThe school opened in fall 1931 and Kemerer served as head coach of the Indians for its duration as Ouachita Junior College. The team played its inaugural season at Forsythe Park before splitting time between Forsythe and Brown Field in 1932 and 1933. During his three years as head coach, Kemerer led Ouachita to an overall record of 6–14–2.\nIn summer 1934, Ouachita Junior College became Northeast Center of Louisiana State University. That July, Malone was hired as head coach at Northeast Center, and he would go on to remain as head coach of the Indians through their 1953 season. Brown Field served as the home field for Northeast Center through the remainder of their time they competed as a junior college. Highlights of the Malone era included undefeated seasons in 1935 and 1937 and a victory in the 1947 Junior Sugar Bowl. During his 17 years as head coach while classified as a junior college, Malone led Northeast to an overall record of 82–49–12.\nThe 1950 season was the last for the Indians as a junior college as Northeast Louisiana State College transformed from a two-year junior college to a four-year senior college.\n1931\nThe 1931 Ouachita Junior College Indians football team represented Ouachita Parish Junior College—now known as the University of Louisiana at Monroe—as an independent during the 1931 junior college football season. Led by first-year head coach J. Paul Kemerer, the Indians compiled a record of 4–1–1. Quarterback Leo Young was elected captain of the team. Ouachita Junior College played all six of its games at home, at Forsythe Park in Monroe, Louisiana.\nOuachita Junior College opened for its first classes on September 28, and this made this the first football team fielded by the junior college. Kemerer came to Ouachita after he served as an assistant coach at Penn State.\nSchedule\n| site_stadium = Forsythe Park\n| site_cityst = Monroe, LA\n| score = 20–0\n| source =\n}}\n| }}\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium = Forsythe Park\n| site_cityst = Monroe, LA\n| score = 7–6\n| source =\n}}\n| }}\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium = Forsythe Park\n| site_cityst = Monroe, LA\n| score = 0–6\n| source =\n}}\n| }}\n}}\n}}\n1932\nThe 1932 Ouachita Junior College Indians football team represented Ouachita Parish Junior College—now known as the University of Louisiana at Monroe—as an independent during the 1932 junior college football season.
