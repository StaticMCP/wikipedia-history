It lies on the eastern edge of the Pisz Forest close to , approximately  north-west of Pisz and  east of the regional capital Olsztyn. It is the sołectwo seat.\nName\nIn Polish, the name of the village means \"anthrax\", but no sources point to any actual connection between the name and the infection. The village first appeared on maps as Wonglik in the 17th century, while the bacterium Bacillus anthracis was first discovered in 1876. \"Wąglik\" also isn't mentioned as a word describing any infections in Polish vocabularies of the time.\nAnother theory suggests that the name may derive from a personal name, but no known historical sources confirm it as well.\nHistory\nThe settlement began as a forest estate on October 17, 1611, when Prince-Elector John Sigismund, in Szczytno, granted a charter establishing it. The grant included five łans of land (about 85 hectares) with forest, as well as a plot for a house for a man named Balzer Ebert. Ebert, who served as a forest ranger, gave the place its later German name, Balzershausen. This was the last such land grant in the Pisz district.\nIn the 17th century, the village appeared in records as Wonglik or Hans Ebert oder Wongligk (after the surname of its next owner, Balzer’s son). An account book from the Pisz Starostwo, dated 1663, mentions the estate under this name, while a 1660 map drawn by  lists it simply as Wonglik. After the Ebert family, the estate passed through the female line to the Beyl family. Both the Eberts and the Beyls belonged to the class known as “kulmers” – free peasants who ranked socially between tenant farmers and the nobility.\nIn 1710, the village suffered a plague outbreak which led to eight deaths.\nEconomy\nA small poultry farm is located in the northern part of the village.\nPopulation\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Population of Wąglik by year\n|-\n!
