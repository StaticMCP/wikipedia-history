In Britain this led to public debates between Decimus Burton and Augustus Pugin.\nLater in the century the revival of vernacular architecture led to an increasing palette of styles from which architects could choose, including Queen Anne style and \"Tudorbethan\" models. Numerous stylistic options led to a debate about prefabricated stylistic options in architecture, which eventually mutated into the Arts and Crafts style and then into Modernism.\nSee also\n* List of architectural styles\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Battle of the styles\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of the Styles"
