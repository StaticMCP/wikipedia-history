Neill's Summerhill School and other free schools in allowing an extreme amount of personal choice to students. Older students could choose which classes to attend or whether to attend classes at all. Within that context, the student was entirely responsible for whether they considered their learning satisfactory, as no grades were given. Nor were students segregated into grades; the only classifications were primary, intermediate, and secondary. Primary students had more guidance and restrictions than middle and secondary students.\nLearning at the Warehouse School did not occur in classrooms but in assorted ad hoc groupings of students and faculty in various formal and informal short- or long-term settings.\nBorrowing from Real Great Society (an outgrowth of a research project carried out in conjunction with Charles W. Slack's work toward his Ph.D. at Harvard), there was a big bulletin board where a schedule for all the classes/groups was posted. Classes ranged from French to Math to Woodworking.\nThe Warehouse School was named for its open-plan physical plant. After its early years, it moved into a former factory, which contained some classrooms but mainly was an ample hangar-like open space. This allowed students, faculty, and community members to construct or deconstruct spaces to serve current needs and desires.\nAs part of its cooperative model, parents or guardians of students were required to donate time to the school. This allowed the school to draw upon the skills of community members for teaching or other activities, involved parents closely in their child's education, and fostered group cohesion.\nA general comparison may be made to the Sudbury Valley School, founded in the same area almost simultaneously. The two schools differed in many significant particulars, though.\nNever financially secure, the Warehouse School folded in 1975.\nWarehouse School graduates include Susan Butcher, noted as a female Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race champion. Former faculty include naturalist and author Don Stokes and botanist Peter Del Tredici.\nRelated publications\n*Hurwitz, Al, editor.
