Aged 17, Taylor moved to New York, living in Essex County for two years, as well as Greene County and later Albany County. By 1834, Taylor had settled in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, where he remained until 1836. Taylor subsequently lived in Milwaukee for one year, before moving to Louisiana.

In April 1845, Taylor was elected to the Iowa Territorial Legislature by constituents in Cedar, Linn, and Jones Counties.

After Iowa attained statehood, Taylor served non-consecutive terms as a member of the Iowa House of Representatives for Jones County, from 1852 to 1854 numbered district 29, and from 1860 to 1862 numbered district 38. Throughout his political career, Taylor was affiliated with the Democratic Party, although he lived and repeatedly won elections in an area dominated by the Republican Party.\nPersonal life\nJohn Taylor married Elizabeth Graffort of Kentucky on December 25, 1844, in Dubuque.
