It served as the country's interim government following the coup d'état which ousted the President Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya on August 3, 2005. It was led by the former Director of the national police force, Colonel Ely Ould Mohamed Vall. After seizing power, it quickly pledged to hold elections within two years and promised that none of its own members would run.\nA few days after seizing power, Ely Ould Mohamed Vall named Sidi Mohamed Ould Boubacar as Prime Minister following the resignation of Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya's last Prime Minister, Sghair Ould M'Bareck.\nA presidential election took place in March 2007 and the new President Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi was sworn in on April 19, 2007.\nSeveral members of CMJD later became members of the next Mauritanian military junta, the High Council of State when it came to power in the 2008 Mauritanian coup d'état under the leadership of general Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz.\nMembers\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!\n!Portrait\n!Name\n!Elected\n! colspan=\"2\" |Term of office\n!Political party\n|-\n!\n|\n|Ely Ould Mohamed Vall\n|\n| rowspan=\"17\" |2005\n| rowspan=\"17\" |2007\n|Military Council for Justice and Democracy\n|-\n!\n|\n|Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz\n|\n|\n|-\n!\n|\n|Mohamed Ould Ghazouani\n|\n|\n|-\n!\n|\n|Abderrahmane Ould Boubacar\n|\n|\n|-\n!\n|\n|Ahmed Ould Bekrine\n|\n|\n|-\n!\n|\n|Sogho Alassane\n|\n|\n|-\n!\n|\n|Ghoulam Ould Mohamed\n|\n|\n|-\n!\n|\n|Sidi Mohamed Ould Cheikh El Alem\n|\n|\n|-\n!\n|\n|Negri Felix\n|\n|\n|-\n!\n|\n|Mohamed Ould Meguett\n|\n|\n|-\n!\n|\n|Mohamed Ould Mohamed Znagui\n|\n|\n|-\n!\n|\n|Kane Hamedine\n|\n|\n|-\n!\n|\n|Mohamed Ould Abdi\n|\n|\n|-\n!\n|\n|Ahmed Ould Ameine\n|\n|\n|-\n!\n|\n|Taleb Moustapha Ould Cheikh\n|\n|\n|-\n!\n|\n|Mohamed Cheikh Ould Mohamed Lemine\n|\n|\n|-\n!\n|\n|Isselkou Ould Cheikh El Wely.\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* Military Committee for National Recovery (CMRN) – Military Government in 1978–1979.\n* Military Committee for National Salvation (CMSN) – Military Government in 1979–1992.\n* High Council of State (HCE) – Military government in 2008–2009.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L03672585.htm Mauritania army says to rule country for 2 years] – Reuters\n* [https://archive.today/20070311084341/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1720255,00.html Oil wealth triggers army coup] – Times Online.\n* ''[http://www.aljazeerah.info/News%20archives/2005%20News%20Archives/August/3n/Mauritanian%20Military%20and%20Security%20Forces%20Overthrow%20Pro-Israel%20President,%20Ma'aouya%20Taya.htm Mauritanian Military and Security Forces Overthrow Pro-Israel President, Ma'aouya Taya] – Al Jazeera\n* [http://www.sabcnews.com/africa/north_africa/0,2172,109671,00.html Mauritania seize of power 'not a surprise'] and [http://www.sabcnews.com/africa/west_africa/0,2172,109667,00.html Jubilant Mauritanians celebrate end of Taya's rule] – SABC\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050810230309/http://voanews.com/english/2005-08-04-voa57.cfm US Envoy Meets Leaders of Mauritanian Junta] and [https://www.voanews.com/a/a-13-2005-08-04-voa46-67397042/275874.html Mauritania Remains Calm After Military Coup] – Voice of America\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061223194127/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-08/05/content_3313004.htm Mauritanian coup leaders dissolve National Assembly] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20110514133624/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-08/05/content_3313338.htm Int'l community intensifies pressure on Mauritanian coup leaders] – Xinhua\n* [http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/News/0,,2-11-1447_1749663,00.html Govt continues despite coup] and [http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/News/0,,2-11-1447_1749544,00.html Coup leaders assure diplomats] – [http://www.news24.com/News24/News24/0,,2-1568_1488021,00.html News24.com]\n* [https://www.theguardian.com/worldlatest/story/0,1280,-5190936,00.html Thousands Back Junta in Mauritania] – The Guardian\n*[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20050805/WORLD05-4/TPInternational/Africa African Union boycotts Mauritania after coup]'' – The Globe and Mail"
