Nielson received his Bachelor of Arts with university honors and summa cum laude from Brigham Young University and his J.D. degree with high honors from the University of Chicago Law School, where he was elected to Order of the Coif and served as articles editor of the University of Chicago Law Review.\nEarlier in his career, he served as a law clerk to Judge J.
