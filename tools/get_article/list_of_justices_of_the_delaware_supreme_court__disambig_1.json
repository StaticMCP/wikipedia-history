From 1772 to 1950, Delaware did not have appointed Supreme Court justices. Instead, appeals from intermediate appellate determinations were taken to \"The High Court of Errors and Appeals\" – a panel made up of the state Chancellor, and all judges of the \"Supreme Court\" and of the Courts of Common Pleas who had not previously been involved with the case; under that system, the sole \"Supreme Court\" justice was the chief justice of Delaware.\nIn 1950, Delaware created a new state Supreme Court, with three judges appointed by the governor.\nColonial Supreme Court of the Lower Counties\nChief justices\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n!Judge!!Began activeservice!!Ended activeservice!!Notes\n|-\n||| 1684 || 1707 || Also a justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.\n|-\n||| 1707 || 1710 || –\n|-\n||| 1710 || 1714 || –\n|-\n||| 1714 || 1717 || –\n|-\n||| 1717 || 1720 || –\n|-\n||| 1726 || 1727 || –\n|-\n||| 1727 || 1741 || –\n|-\n||| 1741 || 1743 || –\n|-\n||| 1743 || 1745 || –\n|-\n| || 1745 || 1764 || –\n|-\n||| 1764 || 1770 || –\n|-\n| || 1773 || 1777 || –\n|}\nAssociate justices\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n!Judge!!Began activeservice!!Ended activeservice!!Notes\n|-\n||| 1690 || 1699 || –\n|-\n||| 1710 || after 1723 || –\n|-\n||| 1713 || 1717 || Chief Justice from 1714 to 1717\n|-\n||| 1743 || 1753 || –\n|-\n||| 1746 || 1755 || –\n|}\nChief justices of the High Court of Errors and Appeals (1777–1951)\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n!Judge!!Began activeservice!!Ended activeservice\n|-\n||| 1777 || 1793\n|-\n||| 1793 || 1793\n|-\n||| 1793 || 1798\n|-\n||| 1799 || 1799\n|-\n||| 1799 || 1828\n|-\n||| 1828 || 1830\n|-\n| || 1830 || 1837\n|-\n||| 1837 || 1839\n|-\n||| 1839 || 1841\n|-\n||| 1841 || 1855\n|-\n| || 1855 || 1857\n|-\n||| 1857 || 1876\n|-\n||| 1876 || 1893\n|-\n||| 1893 || 1909\n|-\n||| 1909 || 1933\n|-\n||| 1933 || 1945\n|-\n||| 1945 || 1951\n|}\nJustices of the Delaware Supreme Court (1951–present)\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n!Judge!!Began activeservice!!Ended activeservice!!Term as chief justice\n|-\n||| 1951 || 1963 || 1951–1963\n|-\n||| 1951 || 1954 ||\n|-\n||| 1951 || 1973 || 1964–1973\n|-\n||| 1954 || 1962 ||\n|-\n||| 1962 || 1964 || 1963–1964\n|-\n||| 1963 || 1974 ||\n|-\n||| 1965 || 1985 || 1973–1985\n|-\n||| 1973 || 1982 ||\n|-\n||| 1974 || 1986 ||\n|-\n||| 1978 || 1994 ||\n|-\n||| 1978 || 1983 ||\n|-\n||| 1982 || 1994 ||\n|-\n||| 1983 || 1992 || 1985–1992\n|-\n||| 1986 || 2017||\n|-\n||| 1985 || 2003 ||\n|-\n||| 1992 || 2004 || 1992–2004\n|-\n||| 1994 || 2014 ||\n|-\n| || 1994 || 2000 ||\n|-\n||| 2000 || 2014 || 2004–2014\n|-\n||| 2003 || 2014 ||\n|-\n||| 2004 || 2015 ||\n|-\n||| 2014 || 2019 || 2014–2019\n|-\n||| 2014 || present ||\n|-\n||| 2014 || 2023 ||\n|-\n||| 2015 || present || 2019–present\n|-\n||| 2017 || present ||\n|-\n||| 2019 || 2023 ||\n|-\n||| 2023 || present ||\n|-\n||| 2023 || present ||\n|}\nReferences\n*[https://courts.delaware.gov/supreme/history.stm History of the Delaware Supreme Court]\n*Henry R.
