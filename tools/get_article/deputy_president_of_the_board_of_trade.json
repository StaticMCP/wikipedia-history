The office of Vice-president was created in 1786 but fell into abeyance in 1867. From 1848 onwards, the office was held concurrently with that of Paymaster General. The office of vice-president itself was effectively succeeded by that of Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade but the role is extant.\nNotable holders of the office of vice-president include Lord Grenville, William Gladstone, Lord Goderich and the Earl Granville.\nIn 2020, there was an unusual appointment of a Deputy President of the Board of Trade to assist the President, but the holder remained only an adviser to the Board. This appears to have been a one-off appointment, and this role no longer exists.\nVice-Presidents of the Board of Trade, 1786–1867 (currently in abeyance)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n!
