He was of Mizrahi descent on his father's side (Iraqi-Jewish) and of second-generation Ashkenazi descent on his mother's side (Austrian-Jewish). He originally trained as a lawyer at the Baghdad Law College, graduating in 1931.\nCareer\nShaul served as editor of the Iraqi Zionist journal  (; ) from 1924 to 1925. In his contributions to the publication, he wrote under the pseudonym \"Ibn al-Samaw'al\" in an allusion to the 6th-century Arabian-Jewish poet Samaw'al ibn 'Adiya.\nFrom 1929 to 1938, Shaul founded and worked as an editor for  ( ), a weekly literary magazine. It featured significant political commentary; mixing harsh criticism of European fascism and advocacy for both Iraqi nationalism and complete political independence from the British Empire. Under his editorial leadership,  became the foremost weekly magazine in Baghdad.\nIn addition to his publication of periodicals, Shaul published a number of longer works, including memoirs, translations of Western literature into Arabic, as well as anthologies of short stories and Arabic poetry.\nImmigration to Israel\nIn 1971, Shaul, who had long been resistant to emigrating despite intensive state-sponsored antisemitism in Iraq, reluctantly made aliyah. He continued to live in Israel until his death in 1984.\nReferences"
