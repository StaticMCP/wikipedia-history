Made of reinforced concrete, it is believed to be the first road bridge of this type in Ireland.\nThe bridge forms part of a one-way system along with the neighbouring Governor's Bridge. Together they connect the Stranmillis and Annadale Embankments, with King's Bridge carrying traffic from the former to the latter.\nHistory\nKing's Bridge was built to connect Sunnyside Street to the east with Ridgeway Street to the west. Stranmillis and Annadale Embankments weren't built until the 1920s. It was constructed by W.J. Campbell & Son for Belfast Corporation to a design by the Trussed Concrete Steel Company of Westminster. It was originally intended to build the bridge at an angle across the river in line with the two streets, but this was ruled out by the Belfast Harbour Commissioners due to the greater effect this would have had on barge traffic.\nStructure\nThe bridge uses the Kahn system of reinforced concrete, which consists of steel bars of a diamond cross section within the concrete. The bars are bent upwards to provide additional strength. It crosses the river in four spans, with a total span of . The bridge has a width of , with two traffic lanes, and a pavement on each side.\nKing’s Bridge is a steel arch bridge incorporating reinforced concrete elements and granite-faced parapets. Its arches span the River Lagan and it is located near other crossings such as the Albert Bridge and Queen's Bridge. The bridge has an approximate total length of 200 feet. It includes pedestrian pathways on both sides, which are separated from the main roadway by cast-iron railings. The original design included integrated street lighting, and lamp posts styled in the period of construction remain in place.\nSee also\n* River Lagan\n* Queen's Bridge, Belfast\n* Albert Bridge, Belfast\n* Transport in Belfast\nReferences"
