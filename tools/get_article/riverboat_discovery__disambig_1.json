The Binkleys were approached in 1950 by Alaska tourism entrepreneur Chuck West, who expressed interest in a local river tour in Fairbanks, Alaska, and asked if they could provide such a service.  Mary and Jim initially operated a small converted missionary boat, the Godspeed, on tours of the rivers near Fairbanks.\nThe company's first sternwheeler, Discovery I, was built by Jim Binkley in his backyard in 1955 to accommodate more passengers.  Later, more riverboats were added to the Discovery fleet; Discovery II was converted from a freighting steamboat in 1971, and Discovery III was built in 1987 at the Nichols Brothers Boat Builders shipyard on Whidbey Island near Seattle, Washington.\nTimeline\n1898: Charles M.

Discovery III goes into passenger service on July 4, 1987, taking over from Discovery II as the company's primary tour vessel.\n2000: The Discovery II resumes passenger service after being mothballed for approximately 10 years for renovations.\n2004: The Discovery I resumes light-duty operation as a vessel for special tours and charters.\nPresent-day operations\nAs of 2025, all three Discovery sternwheelers are still in operation.  The Riverboat Discovery operates daily tours and occasional charters with the sternwheelers from mid-May until mid-September.  In addition to the sternwheelers, the company also operates a sizeable gift shop and dining hall at the landing from which the boats depart.\nCurrent fleet\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Ship\n!
