It consists of more than 300 contributions from a broad range of Irish archaeologists and art historians on subjects such as Abbeys, round towers and individual chapels such as the 12th-century Gallarus Oratory and Cormac’s Chapel begun in 1112 AD. Later chapters cover high crosses, manuscript illumination, and various types of insular metalwork such as brooches, insular croziers, Crucifixion plaques, bell and house-shaped shrines.\nThe book was commissioned by the Royal Irish Academy and University College Dublin as the first of the five-volume Art and architecture of Ireland series, under the general editorship of the art historian Andrew Carpenter.
