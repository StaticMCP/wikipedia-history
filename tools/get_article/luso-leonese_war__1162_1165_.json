It was a conflict between Portugal and the Kingdom of León. It was due to disputes between Afonso Henriques and King Ferdinand II of León, who interfered in Portuguese foreign policy.\nBackground\nAfter the death of Emperor Alfonso VII of León in 1157, his domains were divided between his sons Sancho III, who remained with Castile, and Ferdinand II, who was left with León. Through the Treaty of Sahagún, the two brothers agreed to divide Portugal among themselves if the opportunity arose, but when Sancho III died shortly afterwards, Afonso I declared war on León in 1158.\nDuring hostilities, the Portuguese king signed an alliance with Aragon. His daughter, Mafalda, would marry the heir of Aragon Alfonso, son of Queen Petronilla of Aragon and Count Ramon Berenguer IV, who had proposed the pact. Peace was sealed with Leon at the end of 1160.\nThe foundation of Ciudad Rodrigo by Ferdinand II, in 1160, caused disturbances in the region and, in neighboring Salamanca, a revolt of its knights broke out. They were joined by the Castilian knights from Ávila and the Leonese knights from Zamora but were, however, all destroyed in the Battle of Valmuza, near Salvatierra de Tormes.\nIn the summer of 1162, the Count of Barcelona died. Ferdinand II then managed to get Queen Petronila to annul the marriage agreement between his son and Afonso Henriques' daughter.\nWar\nAfonso Henriques took possession of the Limia region (in Galicia) in 1162. In December of this year, the king provided weapons to all the residents, knights and peons of Mós, a village near the border with Leon to which he granted a charter, so that they could defend his castle.\nIn Castile, internal struggles continued between the Laras and Castros for dominance over their young king, disputes in which the king of León was involved. Unsatisfied with their defeat, in January 1163 the knights of Salamanca reignited the revolt and asked Afonso I for help. Having received the request for help, Afonso I advanced to Salamanca in the same month and took possession of it.\nThe following summer, the Leonese king defeated the Portuguese in the Battle of Campos de Arganara and forced them to withdraw from Salamanca. Returning to Portugal, Afonso I granted charters to Trancoso, , Aguiar da Beira, Celorico da Beira, and . His defeat in Salamanca led him to focus more on the safety of his eastern border, which depended more about the connection of people and knights to that land than the fate of weapons on the battlefield.\nExpelled from Salamanca, in the spring of 1165 the Portuguese king marched again on Galicia, occupied Turonio and conquered the Castle of Cedofeita, near Pontevedra. From Cedofeita, he raided Pontevedra, Ribadavia and Ourense.\nKing Ferdinand II met again with Afonso I in Pontevedra and in May 1165 they signed peace.\nAftermath\nIn exchange for peace, Ferdinand II committed to marrying Urraca of Portugal, daughter of Afonso I, despite the canonical impediment that made the marriage prohibited by the Catholic Church, as they had the same great-grandfather. From this marriage the future king Afonso IX of León was born.\nThe border territories of Limia and Turonio were annexed to Portugal but would not remain in the possession of Afonso Henriques for long. Like the previous peace, this one would not last long and hostilities between Portugal and León would be renewed just two years later.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* }}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
