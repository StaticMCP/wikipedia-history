It would succeed the current King Khalid International Airport,and would be built around it. The airport is being designed by British architectural firm Foster + Partners.\nHistory\nTo improve socio-economic development and boost tourism in Saudi Arabia, the sector on which the Government of Saudi Arabia has laid a strong emphasis by realising its potential since the last decade, in December 2022, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, proposed the plan of building a new airport with the goal of boosting tourism in Saudi Arabia, by expanding the existing King Khalid International Airport, as part of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030. The airport’s vice president is Ersel Göral.\nFacilities\nThe airport includes six passenger terminals, an iconic terminal, private aviation terminal and six runways among other facilities and amenities. The airport covers an area of 57 km2 (22 sq mi) and wants to handle 100 million passengers per year by 2030, and 185 million passengers per year by 2050. It also wants to handle 3.5 million tonnes of cargo per year by 2050. It is planned to use renewable energy, and hopes to get a LEED Platinum Certification. It is being designed by the British architectural firm, Foster + Partners and engineering consultancy, Jacobs, and is planned to have a single concourse area with a loop to connect other terminals, along with multiple entrances and exits. It is planned to also have a 4.2 sq.mi. area reserved for retail and office space. It wants to be among the world's largest airports.\nSee also\n* List of airports in Saudi Arabia\n* King Khalid International Airport\n* King Fahd International Airport\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-world-s-10-largest-airports-by-size.html The 10 Biggest Airports In The World]"
