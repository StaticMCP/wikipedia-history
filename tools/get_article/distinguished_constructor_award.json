The achievements of Queensland's most admired construction industry leaders are further acknowledged by their induction into the QUT Construction Hall of Fame.\nHistory\nThe award was established in 1998, the initiative of Professor Weilin Chang, the then Dean of the Faculty of Built Environment and Engineering, who saw it as a way to \"give something back to industry\".\nCriteria\nRecipients are selected by a panel of their peers, which includes senior academics from QUT and leaders from Queensland's construction industry and Government. There is no external nomination process – the panel brings forward people for consideration based on their extensive knowledge of the construction scene.\nThe Award\nThe award itself was designed by the then QUT industrial design lecturer Steve Curran while the original Hall of Fame display was designed by QUT student, Anna Nelson, after winning a design competition. The Award is presented annually at a venue on the Gardens Point campus of the QUT. A Construction Hall of Fame has been created at QUT's Gardens Point campus as a permanent site for the recognition of the endeavours of leaders of the construction industry in Queensland.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Year\n|-\n|Sir Manuel Hornibrook OBE, FAIB\nMr Clyde Ian Barclay CBE, AM, FAIB\n| 1998\n|-\n| Sir Leslie Thiess CBE\nMr Jack Hutchinson AM\n| 1999\n|-\n| Mr John Panizza OBE\nSir John Clifton Vaughan Holland AC, FTSE\n| 2000\n|-\n| Mr Cyril Golding\nMr Alfred John (Jack) Bond\n| 2001\n|-\n| Sir John Pidgeon\nMs Valmai Pidgeon AM\n| 2002\n|-\n| Mr Martin Carl Albrecht AC\nMr Alfred Henry Hodge\n| 2003\n|-\n| Dr Don Fry AO\nDr John Job Crew Bradfield CMG\n| 2004\n|-\n| Mr Ric Barton\nMr Ron McMaster OBE\n| 2005\n|-\n| Mr John Seymour\nMr Rollo Gallop\n| 2006\n|-\n| Mr Joshua Jeays\nMr Walter Sommer OAM\n| 2007\n|-\n| Mr Jose Goicoechea\nMr William Wild\n| 2008\n|-\n| Mr Michael Power AM\nMr Peter Dare AM\n| 2009\n|-\n| Mr John Petrie\nMr John Hull\n| 2010\n|-\n| Adjunct Professor John Hornibrook Mr Walter Taylor\n| 2011\n|-\n| Mr John KindlerMr Ken Casley\n| 2012\n|-\n| Mr Roger Trundle  Mr Greg Quinn\n| 2013\n|-\n| Mr John Taylor  Mr John Gaskin\n| 2014\n|-\n| Mr Geoff Murphy  Young Constructor Recipient: Mr Ben Cummins\n| 2015\n|}\nReferences"
