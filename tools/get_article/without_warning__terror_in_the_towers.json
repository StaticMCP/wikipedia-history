Levi and starring George Clooney, Andre Braugher and Fran Drescher.\nThe film chronicles the events surrounding the 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York, in which terrorists drove an explosives laden van into the public parking garage beneath the complex and detonated it. Six people were killed and over 1,000 were injured. The film aired just four months after the terrorist attack took place.\nPlot\nThe movie tells the story of the day through a series of vignettes, recounting the experience of people who were in the building when the bomb exploded and their efforts to escape safely. Fran Drescher and Susan Ruttan portray teachers who've brought their elementary school classes on a field trip to the twin towers.  One group gets stuck on an elevator while another must climb onto the roof to escape. George Clooney is a fireman who gets injured when he falls into a fiery basement. James Avery plays a maintenance worker who braves the wreckage looking for his friend. Andre Braugher leads the bomb squad, tasked with uncovering who brough the bomb into the building. Robin Thomas plays an office worker who must help a disabled co-worker down 87 flights of stairs.\nCast\n* James Avery as Fred Ferby\n* Andre Braugher as Tag\n* George Clooney as Kevin Shea\n* Fran Drescher as Rosemarie Russo\n* John Karlen as Jack McAllister\n* Scott Plank as Gary Geidel\n* Susan Ruttan as Anne Marie Tesoriero\n* Michael Stoyanov as Rob Daddio\n* Robin Thomas as Jack\n* Charles Bernard as Guard #1\n* Conrad Dunn as Mohammed A.
