Forces of Mysore's ruler Tipu Sultan very nearly overwhelmed a British East India Company force under the command of Captain John Floyd.\nTipu \"descended the Gajalhatti Pass on 9th September\", attacked Floyd and forcing Floyd to retreat to Coimbatore after suffering 500 casualties.  However, Tipu lost Burhan-ud-din, \"one of his able commanders.\"  Tipu left this front under the command of Kamar-ud Khan, while he dealt with British attacks elsewhere.\nReferences\n*\n*Marshman, John Clark (1863).
