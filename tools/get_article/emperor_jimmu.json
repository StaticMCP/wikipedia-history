His ascension is traditionally dated as 660 BC. In Japanese mythology, he was a descendant of the sun goddess Amaterasu, through her grandson Ninigi, as well as a descendant of the storm god Susanoo. He launched a military expedition from Hyūga near the Seto Inland Sea, captured Yamato, and established this as his center of power. In modern Japan, Emperor Jimmu's legendary ascension is marked as National Foundation Day on February 11.\nThere is no evidence to suggest that Jimmu existed, and he is regarded by most modern scholars as a legendary figure.\nName and title\nJimmu is recorded as Japan's first ruler in two early chronicles,  (721) and  (712).  gives the dates of his reign as 660–585 BC. In the reign of Emperor Kanmu (737–806), the eighth-century scholar Ōmi no Mifune retroactively designated rulers before Emperor Ōjin as , a Japanese pendant to the Chinese imperial title Tiān-dì (天帝), and gave several of them including Jimmu their posthumous names. Prior to this time, these rulers had been known as Sumera no mikoto (皇尊, \"divine highness\") or Ōkimi (大君, \"great lord\"). This practice had begun under Empress Suiko, and took root after the Taika Reforms with the ascendancy of the Nakatomi clan.\nBoth the  and the  give Jimmu's name as  or . Iware indicates a toponym (an old place name in the Nara region) whose precise purport is unclear. '-no-Mikoto' is an honorific, indicating divinity, nobility, or royalty.\nAmong his other names were: ,  and .\nThe Imperial House of Japan traditionally based its claim to the throne on its putative descent from the sun-goddess Amaterasu via Jimmu's great-grandfather Ninigi.\nLegendary narrative\nby Tsukioka Yoshitoshi (1880)]]\nIn Japanese mythology, the Age of the Gods is the period before Jimmu's accession.\nThe story of Jimmu seems to rework legends associated with the Ōtomo clan (大伴氏), and its function was to establish that clan's links to the ruling family, just as those of Suijin arguably reflect Mononobe tales and the legends in Ōjin's chronicles seem to derive from Soga clan traditions. Jimmu figures as a direct descendant of the sun goddess, Amaterasu via the side of his father, Ugayafukiaezu. Amaterasu had a son called Ame no Oshihomimi no Mikoto and through him a grandson named Ninigi-no-Mikoto. She sent her grandson to the Japanese islands where he eventually married Konohana-Sakuya-hime. Among their three sons was Hikohohodemi no Mikoto, also called Yamasachi-hiko, who married Toyotama-hime. She was the daughter of Ryūjin, the Japanese sea god. They had a single son called Hikonagisa Takeugaya Fukiaezu no Mikoto. The boy was abandoned by his parents at birth and consequently raised by Tamayori-hime, his mother's younger sister. They eventually married and had four sons. The last of these, Hikohohodemi, became Emperor Jimmu.\nMigration\n.]]\nAccording to the chronicles  and , Jimmu's brothers Itsuse no Mikoto, Inahi no Mikoto, and Mikeiri no Mikoto were born in Takachiho, the southern part of Kyūshū in modern-day Miyazaki Prefecture. They moved eastward to find a location more appropriate for administering the entire country. Jimmu's older brother, Itsuse no Mikoto, originally led the migration, and led the clan eastward through the Seto Inland Sea with the assistance of local chieftain . As they reached Naniwa (modern-day Osaka), they encountered another local chieftain, Nagasunehiko (\"the long-legged man\"), and Itsuse was killed in the ensuing battle. Jimmu realized that they had been defeated because they battled eastward against the sun, so he decided to land on the east side of Kii Peninsula and to battle westward. They reached Kumano, and, with the guidance of a three-legged crow }}, they moved to Yamato. There, they once again battled Nagasunehiko and were victorious. The record in the  of Emperor Jimmu states that his armed forces defeated a group of }} before his enthronement. The Emishi were an ethnic group who lived in Honshu, particularly the Tōhoku region.\nIn Yamato, Nigihayahi, who also claimed descent from the Takamagahara gods, was protected by Nagasunehiko. However, when Nigihayahi met Jimmu, he accepted Jimmu's legitimacy. At this point, Jimmu is said to have ascended to the throne of Japan. Upon scaling a Nara mountain to survey the Seto Inland Sea he now controlled, Jimmu remarked that it was shaped like the \"heart\" rings made by mating dragonflies, archaically .[https://www.kusuyama.jp/culture/tombo-dragonfly/ メンテナンス中] A mosquito then tried to steal Jimmu's royal blood but since Jimmu was a god incarnate Emperor, , a dragonfly killed the mosquito. Japan thus received its classical name the Dragonfly Islands, .\n, Nara Prefecture]]\nAccording to the , Jimmu died when he was 126 years old. The Emperor's posthumous name literally means \"divine might\" or \"god-warrior\". It is generally thought that Jimmu's name and character evolved into their present shape just before the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were chronicled in the . There are accounts written earlier than either  and  that present an alternative version of the story. According to these accounts, Jimmu's dynasty was supplanted by that of Ōjin, whose dynasty was supplanted by that of Keitai. The  and the  then combined these three legendary dynasties into one long and continuous genealogy.\nThe traditional site of Jimmu's grave is near Mount Unebi in Kashihara, Nara Prefecture.\nin Kashihara, Nara, the principal shrine devoted to Jimmu]]\nImperial Era veneration\nVeneration of Jimmu was a central component of the imperial cult that formed following the Meiji Restoration. In 1873, a holiday called Kigensetsu was established on February 11. The holiday commemorated the anniversary of Jimmu's ascension to the throne 2,532 years earlier. After World War II, the holiday was criticized as too closely associated with the \"emperor system.\" It was suspended from 1948 to 1966, but later reinstated as National Foundation Day.\nBetween 1873 and 1945, an imperial envoy sent offerings every year to the supposed site of Jimmu's tomb. In 1890 Kashihara Shrine was established nearby, on the spot where Jimmu was said to have ascended to the throne.\nBefore and during World War II, expansionist propaganda made frequent use of the phrase hakkō ichiu, a term coined by Tanaka Chigaku based on a passage in the  discussing Emperor Jimmu. Some media incorrectly attributed the phrase to Emperor Jimmu. For the 1940 Kigensetsu celebration, marking the supposed 2,600th anniversary of Jimmu's enthronement, the Peace Tower was constructed in Miyazaki.\nThat same year, numerous stone monuments relating to key events in Jimmu's life were erected around Japan. The sites at which these monuments were erected are known as Emperor Jimmu Sacred Historical Sites.\nand Empress Nagako presiding the celebration of the 2600th anniversary of mythical foundation of the Empire in November 1940|left]]\nIn 1940, Japan celebrated the 2600th anniversary of Jimmu's ascension and built a monument to Hakkō ichiu despite the fact that all historians knew Jimmu was a mythical figure. In 1941, the Japanese government charged the one historian who dared to challenge Jimmu's existence publicly, Tsuda Sōkichi.\nHistoricity\nSince after World War II, when the prohibition on questioning the Kojiki and the Nihongi was lifted, documentary research in China and archaeological research in Japan has undermined much of the information in both the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki. No evidence has been found for Jimmu's existence, except the mention in the  and . Today most modern scholars agree that the traditional founding of the imperial dynasty in 660 BC is a myth and that Jimmu is legendary. Emperor Sujin's historicity is considered possible by historians, while Emperor Kinmei is the first verifiable historical figure in the imperial lineage.\nThe dates of Jimmu reigning from 660 BC to 585 BC are improbable. According to Dr. Lu, the year 660 BC was probably selected by the writers of  to put the founding of Japan on a kanoto-tori year.\nHowever, the stories of Jimmu may reflect real events of the mid to late Yayoi period. According to historian Peter Wetzler, Jimmu's conquest of Osaka and Nara may reflect an actual event. Still, the dates and many of the details are fictitious. Historian Kenneth G. Henshall stated that Jimmu's conquest may also reflect a time when the Yayoi people from continental Asia immigrated in masses starting from Kyushu and moving eastward during the Yayoi period.\nSome scholars suggest that there may have been a real person behind Jimmu. He could have been a local ruler who conquered the area near Kashihara after 62 BC. Some scholars believe he was present in Miyazaki during the first century&nbsp;BC while others say he was there during the third or fourth century&nbsp;AD. Nevertheless, there is a high probability that there was either a foreign or indigenous dynasty in the vicinity of Miyazaki Prefecture during the Kofun period.\nAccording to Louis Frédéric, he may have been a fusion of emperors Sujin and Keitai. The Japanese historian Ino Okifu identifies Emperor Jimmu with the Chinese alchemist and explorer Xu Fu, a hypothesis supported by certain traditions in Japan and regarded as possible by some modern scholars. The Yayoi period, during which significant changes in Japanese metallurgy and pottery occurred, started around the time of his supposed arrival. However, the legend of Xu Fu's voyage also has numerous inconsistencies with the linguistic and anthropological history of Japan.\nConsorts and children\n* Consort: , Hosuseri's (Ninigi-no-Mikoto's son) daughter\n** First son:\n** Son:\n** Daughter: Princess Misaki (神武天皇)\n* Empress: , Kotoshironushi's daughter\n** Son:\n** Second son:\n** Third son: , later Emperor Suizei\nFamily tree\nSee also\n* 2600th Anniversary Celebrations of the Japanese Empire\n* Emishi people\n* Japanese imperial year\n* Jōmon period\n* King Arthur, a legendary figure from Britain who founded the country similar to Emperor Jimmu\n* Modern system of ranked Shinto shrines\n* National Foundation Day\n* Order of the Golden Kite\n* Yayoi period\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n* Brown, Delmer M. and Ichirō Ishida, eds.
