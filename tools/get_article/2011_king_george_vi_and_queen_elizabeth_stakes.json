It was the 61st King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes.\nThe winner was Lady Rothschild's Nathaniel, a three-year-old bay colt trained at Newmarket, Suffolk by John Gosden and ridden by William Buick. Nathaniel's victory was the first for his jockey, trainer and owner.\nThe race\nBefore the race, Nathaniel had contested five races, bypassing the Epsom Derby before recording his most important success when winning the Group Two King Edward VII Stakes at Royal Ascot in June. The 2011 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes attracted five runners, the smallest field since 1966, and Nathaniel was the only three-year-old to take part. The other contenders were Workforce (Epsom Derby, Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe), Rewilding (Dubai Sheema Classic, Prince of Wales's Stakes), St Nicholas Abbey (Racing Post Trophy, Coronation Cup) and Debussy (Arlington Million). Starting the 11/2 fourth choice in the betting, Nathaniel took an early lead before settling in second place behind Debussy. He moved up to regain the lead two furlongs from the finish at which point Rewilding fell heavily and was fatally injured. Workforce then emerged as Nathaniel's main challenger, but the Derby winner veered to the left in the closing stages and the three-year-old won by two and three-quarter lengths, with St Nicholas Abbey in third place.\nRace details\n* Sponsor: Betfair\n* Purse: £1,033,263; First prize: £611,124\n* Surface: Turf\n* Going: Good to Soft\n* Distance: 12 furlongs\n* Number of runners: 5\n* '''Winner's time: 2:35.07\nFull result\n{| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-  style=\"background:#7d7; text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"width:35px;\"| Pos.\n! style=\"width:45px;\"| Marg.\n! style=\"width:160px;\"| Horse (bred)\n! style=\"width:30px;\"| Age\n! style=\"width:160px;\"| Jockey\n! style=\"width:210px;\"| Trainer (Country)\n! style=\"width:50px;\"| Odds\n|-\n| 1\n|\n| Nathaniel (IRE)\n| 3\n| William Buick\n| John Gosden (GB)\n| 11/2\n|-\n| 2'\n| 2¾\n| Workforce (GB)\n| 4\n| Ryan Moore\n| Michael Stoute (GB)\n| 6/5 fav\n|-\n| 3\n| 1¼''\n| St Nicholas Abbey (IRE)\n| 4\n| Joseph O'Brien\n| Aidan O'Brien (IRE)\n| 7/2\n|-\n| 4\n| 20\n| Debussy (IRE)\n| 5\n| Ahmed Ajtebi\n| Mahmood Al Zarooni (GB)\n| 20/1\n|-\n| Fell\n|\n| Rewilding (GB)\n| 4\n| Frankie Dettori\n| Mahmood Al Zarooni (GB)\n| 3/1\n|}\n* Abbreviations: nse = nose; nk = neck; shd = head; hd = head\nWinner's details\nFurther details of the winner, Nathaniel\n* Sex: Colt\n* Foaled: 24 April 2008\n* Country: Ireland\n* Sire: Galileo; Dam: Magnificient Style (Silver Hawk)\n* Owner: Lady Rothschild\n* Breeder:  Kincorth Investments\nReferences"
