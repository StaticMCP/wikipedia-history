Pressure from encroaching white settlers united the Native nations, as recognized in Ratified Indian Treaty 273, while they suffered a reduction of their reservation lands to just 20% of what was provided in the original agreement within 22 years.\nSee also\n*List of Indian treaties\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.ktik-nsn.gov/history/treaties/1832-treaty/ Treaty of Castor Hill, Missouri, with the Kickapoo on October 24, 1832 7 Stat., 391.
