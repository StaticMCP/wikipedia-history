Former president Donald Trump is the Republican nominee, while George W. Bush declined to endorse a candidate, as he is \"retired from presidential politics\".\nThree out of the five living vice presidents besides Harris herself have endorsed her. Biden was also the outgoing incumbent president. Mike Pence, who served under Trump, had said he would not endorse either candidate, while fellow Republican Dan Quayle did not publicly weigh in on the race, though it was thought by some that he voted for Donald Trump (see List of Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign endorsements by former federal officials).\n]]\n]]\n]]\n]]\n]]\n]]\n]]\n]]\n]]\n]]\n]]\n]]\n]]\n]]\n]]\n]]\n]]\n]]\n]]\n]]\n]]\nPresidents\n* Joe Biden, 46th President of the United States (2021–2025) (under whom Harris served as vice president), 47th Vice President of the United States (2009–2017), U.S. Senator from Delaware (1973–2009), former 2024 Democratic presidential presumptive nominee\n* Jimmy Carter, 39th President of the United States (1977–1981), 76th Governor of Georgia (1971–1975)\n* Bill Clinton, 42nd President of the United States (1993–2001), 40th and 42nd Governor of Arkansas (1979–1981, 1983–1992), Attorney General of Arkansas (1977–1979)\n* Barack Obama, 44th President of the United States (2009–2017), U.S. Senator from Illinois (2005–2008)\nVice presidents\n* Dick Cheney, 46th Vice President of the United States (2001–2009), U.S. Secretary of Defense (1989–1993), House Minority Whip (1989), Chair of the House Republican Conference (1987–1989), U.S. Representative from Wyoming (1979–1989), White House Chief of Staff (1975–1977), White House Deputy Chief of Staff (1974–1975) (Republican)\n* Al Gore, 45th Vice President of the United States (1993–2001), U.S. Senator from Tennessee (1985–1993), U.S. Representative from TN-06 (1983–1985), and TN-04 (1977–1983), 2000 Democratic nominee for president\nCabinet-level officials\nCurrent\n* Xavier Becerra, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services (2021–2025), Attorney General of California (2017–2021), U.S. Representative from CA-34 (2013–2017), CA-31 (2003–2013) and CA-30 (1993–2003)\n*Pete Buttigieg, U.S. Secretary of Transportation (2021–2025), Mayor of South Bend, Indiana (2012–2020), 2020 Democratic presidential candidate\n*Miguel Cardona, U.S. Secretary of Education (2021–2025), Commissioner of the Connecticut State Department of Education (2019–2021)\n*Jennifer Granholm, U.S. Secretary of Energy (2021–2025), Governor of Michigan (2003–2011), Attorney General of Michigan (1999–2003)\n*Isabel Guzman, Administrator of the Small Business Administration (2021–2025)\n*Deb Haaland, U.S. Secretary of the Interior (2021–2025), U.S. Representative from NM-01 (2019–2021)\n*Gina Raimondo, U.S. Secretary of Commerce (2021–2025), Governor of Rhode Island (2015–2021), General Treasurer of Rhode Island (2011–2015)\n*Michael S.
