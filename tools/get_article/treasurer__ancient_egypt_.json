The office is known since the end of the Old Kingdom, where people with this title appear sporadically in the organization of private estates.\nIn the Middle Kingdom, the office became one of the most important ones at the royal court. At the end of the 18th Dynasty, the title lost its importance, although the famous Bay had this office.
