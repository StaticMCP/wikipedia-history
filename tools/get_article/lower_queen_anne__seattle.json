      "text": "# Lower Queen Anne, Seattle\n\nLower Queen Anne is a neighborhood in northwestern Seattle, Washington, at the base of Queen Anne Hill. While its boundaries are not precise, the toponym usually refers to the shopping, office, and residential districts to the north and west of Seattle Center. The neighborhood is connected to Upper Queen Anne—the shopping district at the top of the hill—by an extremely steep section of Queen Anne Avenue N. known as the Counterbalance, in memory of the cable cars that once ran up and down it.\nIn early April 2021, the Seattle City Council passed a resolution that officially recognized changing the name of the area previously known as Lower Queen Anne to Uptown.\nWhile \"Lower Queen Anne\" and \"Uptown\" are rarely used to refer to the grounds of Seattle Center itself, most of Seattle Center is in the neighborhood; these include Climate Pledge Arena (home of the Seattle Storm of the WNBA and the Seattle Kraken of the NHL), the Exhibition Hall, McCaw Hall (home of the Seattle Opera and Pacific Northwest Ballet), the Cornish Playhouse (home of the Intiman Summer Theatre Festival and Cornish College of the Arts), the Bagley Wright Theater (home of Seattle Repertory Theatre), and the studios for KEXP radio.\non the Counterbalance section of Queen Anne Hill|left]]\nLower Queen Anne also has a three-screen movie theater, the SIFF Cinema Uptown, and On the Boards, a center for avant-garde theater and music.\nGeography\nLower Queen Anne can be considered either a distinct neighborhood, or part of the larger Queen Anne neighborhood. Although the borders of Lower Queen Anne are not clearly defined, they usually include the area from Ward St. to Denny Way. Additionally, the area from the intersection of W. Galer St. and 5th Ave W. to W Prospect St. and Queen Anne Ave. N. are also usually considered part of the Lower Queen Anne area. However, as no borders for neighborhoods in the city of Seattle have been clearly defined, the boundaries of Lower Queen Anne remain merely set by popular opinion.\nLower Queen Anne, with Climate Pledge Arena in the bottom right, as seen from the [[Space Needle]]\nTransit\nThe Seattle Center Monorail, the city's only monorail line, runs from Lower Queen Anne to Downtown.
