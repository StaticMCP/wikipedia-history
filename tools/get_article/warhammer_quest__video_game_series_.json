The first game, Warhammer Quest, was released in 2013. The second game, Warhammer Quest 2: The End Times, was released in 2017. Warhammer Quest: Silver Tower, was released in 2020. The first two games are based on Games Workshop's 1995 board game Warhammer Quest, which itself is based on the tabletop wargame Warhammer. Silver Tower is based on the 2016 sequel board game of the same name.\nGameplay\nWarhammer Quest is a top-down turn-based dungeon crawler. The player controls a party of four warriors in search of treasure in the dungeons of The Old World. The dungeons are randomly generated. The rules are quite close to the original board game and in \"hardcore mode\" even less forgiving.\nWarhammer Quest 2 is set years after the events of the first game during Chaos' final assault on the Old World. Warhammer Quest 2 has full 3D polygonal graphics compared to the 2D top-down graphics of the first game.\nIn Silver Tower, the party has to find eight fragments of a Chaos Amulet hidden in the titular dungeon and deal with the master of the tower, the Gaunt Summoner, and his minions. Silver Tower is a free-to-play gacha game where the player is enticed to spend money to buy lootboxes and random heroes. A multiplayer mode was added to the game on 15 September 2022.\nRelease\nWarhammer Quest series was developed by Rodeo Games and Perchang Games, studios that are both based in Guildford, England.

Another expansion, The Undead Horde, was released in December 2013. PC, Linux and Mac versions were announced on 15 December 2014, for release on 7 January 2015. Android version was released on 26 June 2015. PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions were released in 2017, Nintendo Switch version was released in 2019.\nIn July 2017, Warhammer Quest 2 was announced to be released in September 2017. The game was released eventually on 19 October 2017. Android version was released on 11 April 2018. The PC and Mac versions were released on 30 January 2019.

It assumes that role-playing works better with all the dice and messy statistics brushed off the table, and it assumes that a multiplayer board game and a single-player video game are the same experience.\"\nBrad Cummings of TouchArcade summarized: \"Warhammer Quest, while being an excellent port of a classic board game, is actually an amazing dungeon crawler on iOS, no matter what your experience with the source material. You owe it to yourself to check out this excellent hack and slash experience.\"\nMike Futter of Game Informer summarized: \"Put simply, this is an excellent mobile translation of a tabletop experience – but random design elements in the source material hold it back.\"\nStace Harman of Eurogamer reviewed the PC version and said: \"Warhammer Quest is a competent example of a digital board game but in trying to sand its sharp edges and ensure that it's accessible to all, Rodeo has oversimplified the already slight source material.\"\nAdam Smith of Rock Paper Shotgun said: \"Its problems include a stack of day one DLC, an in-game gold shop and an interface that hasn't made the transition from touchscreen quite as smoothly as you might hope. Despite all of that, it's simple turn-based tactical combat is weirdly compelling and sundering skaven and snotlings can be a fine way to while away a few lazy evenings.\"\nPC Gamer listed the game seventh on its list of best Warhammer Fantasy games.\nOn 17 October 2023, Chilled Mouse announced that the game will \"shortly\" no longer be sold since the contract allowing the game to use the Warhammer intellectual property has ended or was not renewed.  Chilled Mouse is the studio responsible for porting the game on PC.\nWarhammer Quest 2: The End Times\nWarhammer Quest 2: The End Times received \"mixed or average\" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic.\nHarry Slater of Pocket Gamer said: \"Warhammer Quest 2 builds on the successes of its predecessor. It feels more like a game in its own right though, less tethered to the board games that inspired it. And that can only be a good thing as far as I'm concerned.\"\nMatt Thrower of Pocket Tactics summarized: \"Warhammer Quest 2: The End Times is a flashy but simplified successor to the original. It feels less like a board game than the first game and more like a game tailor-made for the digital medium. Unfortunately, a sense of challenge and tension has been lost along the way.\"\nJason Rodriguez of PC Invasion reviewing the PC version said: \"Unfortunately, a number of issues from RNG mechanics to monotonous dungeon runs mar what could’ve been an amazing experience. It might be stellar on mobiles and tablets owing to shorter bursts of playing time. Sadly, as a PC title — where it's common for strategy game playthroughs to last several hours per sitting — it needs more than just a retouch.\"\nWarhammer Quest: Silver Tower\nSean Martin of Pocket Tactics gave the game eight out of ten and summarized: \"Though its champion system could use a little work, Warhammer Quest: Silver Tower is an excellent turn-based strategy game with plenty of potential\".\nTommaso Pugliese of Multiplayer.it gave the game 7.0 out of 10 and said: \"Warhammer Quest: Silver Tower is a solid turn-based strategy game with nice environments and characters, but it doesn't represent the evolution that we expected to see from the third chapter of the series.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://rodeogames.co.uk/warhammer-quest/ Official website for Warhammer Quest]\n*[https://perchang.com/warhammer-quest-2.html Official website for Warhammer Quest 2: The End Times]\n*[https://perchang.com/wq--silver-tower.html Official website for Warhammer Quest: Silver Tower]"
