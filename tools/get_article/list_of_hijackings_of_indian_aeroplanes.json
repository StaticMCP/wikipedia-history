Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, then Foreign Minister of Pakistan rushed to Lahore and met the hijacker. On February 1, he persuaded them to release the crew and passengers who were then sent by road to Amritsar. The Government of India sought permission of Pakistan to send a replacement crew to fly the aircraft back to India. Pakistan authorities denied the permission, and the hijackers torched the aircraft on February 2.\n*1976 September 10: Indian Airlines plane Boeing 737 was hijacked from Palam Airport Delhi by a group of six terrorists from Kashmir: Syed Abdul Hameed Dewani, Syed M Rafique, M. Ahsan Rathore, Abdul Rashid Malik, Ghulam Rasool, and Khawaja Ghulam Nabi Itoo. it was scheduled from Delhi to Mumbai. Initially ordered to fly the plane to Libya, after knowing that there wasn't enough fuel for that journey, the leader of the terrorists told the pilot Captain B.N Reddy to take the flight to Karachi, Pakistan instead. To refuel the plane, they took permission from CAA Lahore airport in Pakistan to land and refuel. All the passengers and crew on board were duly returned to India the next day, after diplomatic relations between India and Pakistan were re-established and Pakistan helped with the rescue operations. The hijackers were caught in a trick during breakfast, being served colourless tranquilisers with water. All six hijackers were taken in custody and the plane was sent back to India with 83 passengers on board. The militants were later released in Pakistan citing \"lack of evidence\". Repercussions on the Indian side led to the suspension of 11 members of the security staff and a promise by the Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation, Raj Bahadur, to order a detailed and \"thorough inquiry\" into the event \"and into the security arrangements at the airport\".\n*1978 December 20: Indian Airlines Flight 410 was hijacked mid-air minutes before its touchdown at the erstwhile Palam Airport, New Delhi. The two hijackers, Bholanath Pandey and Devendra Pandey, both rumoured to be members of Youth Congress, hijacked the Indian Airlines plane on a domestic flight from Calcutta to Delhi. It is to note that the hijacking was performed with the aid of a toy gun. They demanded the release of opposition leader Indira Gandhi (who had been arrested by the Indian Parliament), the withdrawal of all charges against her son, Sanjay Gandhi, and for the Janata Party Government at the Centre to tender its resignation and leave. Initially the two demanded to fly the plane to Nepal and then Bangladesh, both of which were rejected due to shortage of fuel. Eventually the flight was taken to Varanasi where the flight was landed. It was here that the chief minister of the state of Uttar Pradesh was summoned for the negotiations. After discussions, both men released the passengers and crew. Their surrender in the presence of media was noted.\n1980s\n*1981 September 29: An Indian Airlines IC-423 plane on flight from Delhi to Amritsar was hijacked by Sikh separatists and taken to Lahore.

The hijacker was later identified as Manjit Singh an electrician from Amritsar. The militant demanded for the flight to be taken to Lahore but after being debited permission to land by the Pakistani government, it was no longer possible. Due to this the plane circled over Lahore airport more than 42 times before running short of fuel, due to which it was finally landed at Amritsar. Among the various demands that Manjit asked for was 8 Lakh Rupees in German marks, the transfer of power in Punjab to Akali Dal with the position of chief minister given to Prakash Singh Badal and the release of half Sikh security granthis. The hijacker was finally apprehended and shot dead in what was described in a rather \"Ham handed\" manner.

He forced the plane to land in Amritsar (after being denied landing permission in Lahore) and demanded political asylum in Pakistan.

It was later identified as being a combustible liquid capable of a small fire. They demanded changes to the college's courses, cancellation of an award to a professor and postponement of exams. One student narrated a 10-minute litany on their various grievances and demanded that unless they are allowed to meet with the governor of Uttar Pradesh they'll blow up the plane. In the words of Tom Segev, an Israeli journalist who was also a passenger on the flight: \"The whole thing was like a game.\" The passengers didn't put much attention to the hijackers and continued to do whatever they were doing. The flight flew in circles for 3 hours, while negotiations were done with the authorities through the control tower. After the flight landed the passengers overpowered the hijackers and successfully got the situation in control. All of the 52 passengers and 7 crew members were unharmed and saved.
