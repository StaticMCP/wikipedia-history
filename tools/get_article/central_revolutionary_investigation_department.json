The military junta immediately began to purge the state of the emperor's supporters and political opponents and formed a new secret police and intelligence service (intelligence agency firstly named \"Committee for peoples Security and Peace\"). Soon, the Derg regime carried out a bloody military campaign to suppress its opponents, known as the Qey Shibir or Red Terror, which killed an estimated 980,000 people in less than two years. If Red Terror was stopped in 1978, however, repressions was not: in August of the same year CRID was founded. CRID was responsible for suppressing dissent and identifying targets for state repression in Ethiopia. Department also has been monitoring opposition in government-controlled areas and regime dissidents. It is considered to be the most advanced institution of violence in Derg's Ethiopia. CRID also known as the \"third police station\".\nThe CRID was disbanded in May–June 1991 following the fall of the Derg regime because of a series of offensives by a coalition of opposition forces.\nReferences"
