It consisted of five recently formed infantry battalions. Home brigades had a purely static defence role.\nService\n203rd Independent Infantry Brigade (Home) served in SW Area/Devon and Cornwall County Division until 1 December 1942, when the County Division was renamed 77th Infantry Division and the brigade was redesignated 203rd Infantry Brigade. On 1 September 1944, 77th Division was disbanded and its personnel reformed as 45th (Holding) Division. At the same time 203rd Brigade was redesignated 134th Infantry Brigade (replacing a disbanded formation with the same number). All of these formations remained in the United Kingdom throughout the war.\nOrder of Battle\n203rd Brigade was composed as follows:\nAs part of the Devon and Cornwall County Division:\n* 11th Battalion, West Yorkshire Regiment (formed in July 1940 at York; to 214 Bde 14 July 1941)\n* 7th Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment (formed in July 1940, at Beverley)\n* 8th Battalion, Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment (formed in July 1940 at Bedford)\n* 6th Battalion, Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry (formed in May 1940 at Truro as 50th Holding Battalion, DCLI; became 6th Bn on 9 October 1940)\n* 8th Battalion, Duke of Wellington's Regiment (formed in Summer 1940 at Otley; converted into 145th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps, on 1 November 1941)\nBetween 30 June and 19 July 1941, the 7th East Yorks, 6th DCLI and 8th Beds & Herts were all transferred to reconstitute 73rd Independent Bde, which took over all the static units in Cornwall.
