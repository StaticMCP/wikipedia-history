Playing as a wicket-keeper he took a single catch and made stumping, in addition to batting in both of the Roshanara Club's innings'. He batted at number eleven in their first innings, ending it unbeaten having scored a single run. In their second innings he was promoted to open the batting, scoring three runs before being dismissed by Eustace Hill.
