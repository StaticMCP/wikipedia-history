In the , Howitt had a population of 48 people.\nGeography\nHowitt is on the western coast of Cape York Peninsula facing the Gulf of Carpentaria.\nThe Burke Developmental Road passes through the locality from north-east (Yagoonya) to the south-west (Normanton). The Karumba Developmental Road enters the locality from the west (Karumba), terminating at its junction with the Burke Developmental Road in Howitt.\nThe land use is grazing on native vegetation.\nHistory\nMany towns and localities in this area have names connected to the Burke and Wills expedition. Although not officially recorded, it is likely that Howitt is named after Alfred William Howitt, who led a relief mission that rescued the only survivor John King and buried the bodies of Burke and Wills (Howitt later disinterred the bodies and returned them to Melbourne for burial).\nDemographics\nIn the , Howitt had a population of 24 people.\nIn the , Howitt had a population of 48 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Howitt. The nearest government primary schools are Karumba State School in neighbouring Karumba to the west and Normanton State School in neighbouring Normanton to the south-west. The nearest government secondary school is Normanton State School (to Year 10). Some parts of Howitt are too distant from these schools and the alternatives are distance education and boarding school. There are no schools offering secondary Years 11 and 12 in the area; again the alternatives are distance education and boarding school.\nReferences\nExternal links"
