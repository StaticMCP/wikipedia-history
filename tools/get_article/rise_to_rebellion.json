Booklist praised it as \"an exciting evocation of events leading up to the formation of America,\" and Publishers Weekly appreciated the book's \"passion and vigor.\"  Kirkus Reviews, however, called the work \"dull\" and \"disappointing,\" saying that the characters were \"all so burdened by the task of providing the reader with huge dollops of sedulously digested information that Shaara neglects to give them any individual reality.\"\nRise to Rebellion spent six weeks on the New York Times fiction bestsellers list from July to August 2001.
