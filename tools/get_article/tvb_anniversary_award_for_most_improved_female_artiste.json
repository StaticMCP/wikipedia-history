It was separated into two categories—Most Improved On-screen Performance Award—Drama (螢幕大躍進獎—戲劇組) and Most Improved On-screen Performance Award—Non-drama (螢幕大躍進獎—非戲劇組), to individually recognize actors and variety presenters. The award was re-established in 2002, changing its name to My Favourite Most Improved Female Artiste of the Year (本年度我最喜愛的飛躍進步女藝員). In 2005, the name was changed to Most Improved Female Artiste (飛躍進步女藝員).\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Table key\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#FAEB86; height:20px; width:20px\"|\n| Indicates the winner\n|}\nwon in 2002 for her performance in Golden Faith.]]\nwon in 2004 for her performance in Angels of Mission.]]\nwon in 2006.]]\nwon in 2007.]]\nwon in 2010.]]\nwon in 2013.]]\nwon in 2015.]]\nwon in 2016.]]\n1990s\n2000s\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"width:10%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:25%;\"| Artiste\n!
