Its population was 32,027 at the 2020 census. The town contains three villages (Florida, Greenwood Lake, and Warwick) and eight hamlets (Amity, Bellvale, Edenville, Little York, Wisner, New Milford, Pine Island, and Sterling Forest).\nHistory\nIn the early 1700s, one of the original patent holders, Benjamin Aske, named his land \"Warwick\", presumably after an area of England near his original ancestral home. He began to sell it off to settlers in 1719. His first parcel of land, 100 acres, was sold to Lawrence Decker. Other familiar family names of the Valley appeared in subsequent years. The European population of the valley grew rapidly from 1730 to 1765, and the previously existing populations of indigenous native people declined as forests and land were cleared for pasture and were re-organized. By the start of the American Revolution, almost all of the native population had disappeared in various ways. The region has been referred to as Warwick since the early eighteenth century, but a governmental form for a town named Warwick was officially created in 1788.\nDuring the American War for Independence, Warwick was the site of a Continental Army encampment. The Hudson River Chain was forged at Sterling Iron Works in Warwick, preventing the British Navy from sailing up the Hudson River. In 1783, George Washington traveled through Warwick, stopping at Baird's Tavern and spending the night in the home of John Hathorn.\nof Warwick from 1887 with list of landmarks by L.R. Burleigh]]\nWarwick is situated along a freight rail line, which, as it did with many other towns in Orange County (such as Goshen, Middletown, and Newburgh), contributed to the growth of the area. The nineteenth-century writer and naturalist Henry William Herbert, writing as Frank Forrester, popularized the area with his 1845 book, \"The Warwick Woodlands\".\nBetween 1977 and 2011, Warwick was home to Mid-Orange Correctional Facility. The prison was closed in 2011 and transferred to the town in 2014. Part of the prison grounds became Wickham Woodlands Park, a large public park centred on Wickham Lake. The rest of the prison, including the buildings, became part of the Warwick Valley Office & Technology Corporate Park. Businesses on the site include the Hudson Sports Complex, Drowned Lands Brewery, as well as cannabis industry companies Green Thumb Industries, UrbanXtracts, Phyto-Farma labs, and Citiva Medical. Other companies with a presence in the town include Trans Tech.\nGeography\n]]\nThe town of Warwick comprises much of the southern tip of Orange County. It borders the townships of Vernon and West Milford to the south, both in the state of New Jersey. To its north, Warwick is bordered by Chester via Sugar Loaf, Orange County's oldest hamlet, antedating both Warwick and Chester, and which was part of Warwick until the mid-nineteenth century.

Greenwood Lake is Orange County's largest lake, and it is bisected by the border between New Jersey (to the south) and New York (on its north). Glenmere Lake, an extremely critical endangered species habitat, is bisected by Warwick and Chester.\nWarwick is served by Warwick Municipal Airport and two regional state highways, New York State Route&nbsp;17A (NY&nbsp;17A) and NY&nbsp;94.
