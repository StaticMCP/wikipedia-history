Though Hicks remains an enigma, his life is undeniably intriguing — and docu conveys this with conviction, as well as Hicks Sr.’s love for his wayward son\" On ABC's At the Movies both David Stratton and Margaret Pomeranz gave it 4 stars with Stratton saying \"This is a documentary which every concerned Australian should see.\"\nAwards\n*2004 Australian Film Institute Awards\n**Best Documentary - Curtis Levy - won\n**Best Direction in a Documentary - Bentley Dean, Curtis Levy - nominated\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
