This terrified the neighboring tribes (including the Vettones) into offering their surrender.\nAftermath\nThe conquest of Oxthracae terrified the surrounding tribes, including the Vettones, who immediately sought terms of surrender, temporarily securing Roman dominance in the region, however,\nonce Atilius withdrew his forces to winter quarters, the Lusitanians revolted and besieged some of Rome's allied settlements.\nSee also\n*Viriathus\n*Lusitanian War\nSources\n*[https://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_spain_00.html Appian's History of Rome.]"
