She was the second child of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor by his first wife Blanche of Valois. She was a member of the House of Luxembourg.\nLife\nMargaret was the second child of her father's first marriage. She was betrothed at the age of two to Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy, the contract being signed on 7 March 1338. The contract was, however, broken and Amadeus married Margaret's cousin, Bonne of Bourbon.\nAt the age of seven, Margaret was married in 1342 to Louis I of Hungary.\nThe marriage lasted seven years and no children were born of the union, probably because of Margaret's young age. She died in 1349 while still a minor, aged around fourteen, and was probably buried in Székesfehérvár Basilica. She had outlived her mother, Blanche, by only one year. Her husband remarried four years later to Elizabeth of Bosnia.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n|-\n|-"
