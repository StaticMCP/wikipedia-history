Sparhawk's father, a Dartmouth-educated lawyer from Templeton, Massachusetts, died on June 4, 1807, at the age of 37.\nMontreal\nIn his twenties, Vernon lived in Montreal, Lower Canada with fellow New Englander Ariel Bowman. Bowman published an anonymous book of poetry, Hours of Childhood and Other Poems, in 1820. There has been some contention as to whether the writer of the poems was Sparhawk or Bowman, but a footnote in a stanza memorializing the poet's brother refers to the wreck of the Resource in the Pacific, where Sparhawk's brother William perished in 1818. This points clearly to Sparhawk being the author.\nThe Canadian Times and libel charges\nSparhawk and Bowman founded and published The Canadian Times and Weekly Literary and Political Reporter, which was in print from January 1823 until some time in 1824. On January 31, 1823, The Times accused the Legislative Council and House of Assembly of Quebec of anti-British sentiment:\n:The resolutions and addresses of the Legislative Council and the House of Assembly will be found amongst the proceedings of the Provincial Parliament, and cannot be productive of surprise, when the majorities by which they were carried show how completely anti-British was the composition of these bodies.\nThe House of Assembly took offense, and on February 3, 1823, the Speaker issued warrants for the arrests of Bowman and Sparhawk for libel. Bowman was apprehended and held briefly before he escaped, while Sparhawk evaded capture.\nThe Widow Rock\nSometime in 1824, Sparhawk published The Widow Rock and Other Poems by the American writer Margaret Blennerhassett. The volume was published anonymously, the title page listing its author simply as \"A Lady.\"\nFirst marriage\nSparhawk returned to the United States, and on August 7, 1824, he married Julia Brush Lyman in Burlington, Vermont. They remained married until her death in 1836.\nDuff Green incident\nThe late 1820s found Sparhawk working as a reporter in Washington, D.C., for the National Intelligencer. On January 25, 1928, the owner and editor of the United States Telegraph, Duff Green, confronted Sparhawk in the United States Capitol and accused him of deliberately and maliciously misquoting a speech by John Randolph of Roanoke. The Intelligencer reported that Green viciously assaulted Sparhawk, while the Telegraph insisted that any physical altercation was minor and that Sparhawk has barely been hurt. A few days later, Sparhawk petitioned the United States Senate for redress.\nThe Southern Literary Messenger\nSparhawk became acquainted with James E. Heath, editor of the Southern Literary Messenger. His first contribution to the journal, entitled \"A Tale of a Nose,\" appeared under the pen name Pertinax Placid in the April 1835, issue.\nIn May Sparhawk succeeded Heath as editor of the Messenger. He was introduced in a \"Publisher's Notice\" by publisher Thomas Willis White as \"a gentleman of approved literary tastes and attainments.\" His editorship was short-lived, however, as in August of the same year White removed him from the position, although his relationship with the journal continued.\nSecond marriage\nSparhawk married his second wife, Eloise Warrell, in Richmond, Virginia, on August 8, 1837.\nDeath\nOn January 13, 1838, Sparhawk reported feeling weak and suddenly collapsed, and died shortly thereafter of a lung hemorrhage.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=cggTAAAAIAAJ Hours of Childhood and Other Poems] on Google Books\n* [http://collections.banq.qc.ca/ark:/52327/1964413 Selected issues of The Canadian Times]\n* [https://www.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.36184 Margaret Blennerhassett’s The Widow Rock and Other Poems] on Canadiana.ca\n* [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moajrnl/browse.journals/sout.html The Southern Literary Messenger] at the University of Michigan, including issues edited by (and contributed to by) Sparhawk."
