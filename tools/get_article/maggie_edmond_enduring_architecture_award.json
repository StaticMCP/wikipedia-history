The award recognises long lasting, significant and enduring architecture with usually 25 years passed since the completion of construction.\n, Victoria Chapter of RAIA|left|upright=0.9]]\nBackground\nThe award was established in Victoria in 2003 and initially called the 25 Year Award. In 2007 the award name was changed to the '25 Year Award for Enduring Architecture' later becoming the 'Victorian Award for Enduring Architecture'. In 2023 the award became a named award, recognising Melbourne based architect Maggie Edmond, recipient of the first 25 Year Award in 2003, for the Chapel of St Joseph in Mont Albert North designed by her firm Edmond & Corrigan and built in 1978.\nThe award recognises achievement for the design of buildings of outstanding merit, which remain important as high quality works of architecture when considered in the contemporary context. Nominations for the award can be made by AIA members, non–members and non–architects, but adequate material and information supporting the nomination must be provided for consideration of the jury.\nRecipients of the state-based award are eligible for consideration for the National Award for Enduring Architecture presented later in the same year, as part of the Australian National Architecture Awards.\nThe average age of the 23 projects that have won the award is 42.5 years (2003–2025).\nRecipients of the award\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" |Maggie Edmond Enduring Architecture Award (since 2003)\n|-\n!
