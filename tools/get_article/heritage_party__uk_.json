Kurten was also a member of the Brexit Alliance, a Eurosceptic technical group he formed in 2018 with fellow former UKIP member Peter Whittle.\nHistory\n, founder and leader of the Heritage Party]]\nIn January 2020, Kurten announced he would be running as an independent candidate in the upcoming London mayoral and London Assembly elections (then scheduled for May 2020, but both elections were postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic). Kurten founded the Heritage Party, and it was registered with the Electoral Commission that October.\nIn December 2020, Kurten rejected a COVID-19 vaccine, for which he was denounced by Conservative mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey, who saw this as irresponsible for an elected politician. Lockdowns in response to the coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom were condemned by Kurten.\nIn March 2025, the party gained representation in local government, when Becki Bruneau, a Kent County Councillor for Tunbridge Wells, defected from the Conservatives.\nElections\nParliamentary by-elections\nThe party has stood in eight by-elections so far:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!By-election\n!Candidate\n!Votes\n!Out of\n!Percentage\n!Place\n!Out of\n!Notes\n!References\n|-\n|2021 Hartlepool by-election\n|Claire Martin\n|468\n|29,933\n|1.6\n|4th\n|16\n|\n|\n|-\n|2021 Batley and Spen by-election\n|Susan Laird\n|33\n|37,786\n|0.1\n|16th\n|16\n|\n|\n|-\n|2021 Old Bexley and Sidcup by-election\n|David Kurten\n|116\n|21,733\n|0.5\n|9th\n|11\n|\n|\n|-\n|2021 North Shropshire by-election\n|James Elliot\n|79\n|38,093\n|0.2\n|10th\n|14\n|\n|\n|-\n|2022 Southend West by-election\n|Ben Downton\n|236\n|15,942\n|1.6\n|6th\n|9\n|Held due to the murder of previous MP David Amess on 15 October 2021.
