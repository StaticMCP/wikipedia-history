In early 2017, Sutton announced his intentions to leave the serial and the character departed on 9 March 2017.\nSutton reprised the role on 26 March 2019 for a cameo appearance, and four months later, it was announced that Sutton had reprised the role on a regular basis.

While Hannah is head over heels for him, it is apparent John Paul does not feel the same way. After John Paul breaks up with Hannah, everyone mistakenly believes it is because he has feelings for Sarah, who is Craig's girlfriend. John Paul and Hannah later reconcile.

Afterwards, John Paul tells Craig he did not mean it and they agree to forget about it.\nCraig drunkenly kisses John Paul at a school dance-off competition. Hannah sees the kiss and announces it to the whole school. John Paul tells a devastated Hannah that he is gay.

John Paul comes out to his family and while his sisters are supportive, Myra struggles with the revelation. John Paul also comes out to his friends and classmates, which leads to him being teased and bullied. Craig, not wanting to be perceived as gay, attacks John Paul physically, which effectively ends their friendship.\nJohn Paul and Craig later make up and become close again. John Paul begins dating a DJ named Spike (Tom Vaughan). Craig is jealous of all the time John Paul spends with Spike and John Paul tells him that he needs to accept his new relationship. Much to John Paul's surprise, Craig confesses he has feelings for him and they sleep together. Afterwards, John Paul is thrilled, but Craig pretends nothing happened between them. Eventually, they sleep together again and John Paul assumes this means Craig is going to come out. However, Craig tells John Paul that he is not gay, not finishing with Sarah, and wants to see John Paul on the side. John Paul is disgusted by the proposition at first, but he eventually gives in and the two begin an affair.\nCraig tells John Paul he loves him and they both agree to finish with their partners so they can be together.

Despite the disapproval of their friends and family, John Paul and Craig officially start a relationship. However, John Paul cannot get over how Craig seems ashamed to be with him. To prove his commitment to him, Craig asks John Paul to move with him to Dublin. At the airport, John Paul overhears Craig tell his brother, Jake (Kevin Sacre), that he is not gay. John Paul asks Craig to kiss him and when he cannot, John Paul tells Craig he loves him with all of his heart, but that he needs more than to be with a man who cannot even display affection towards him. Heartbroken, John Paul returns home, leaving a devastated Craig to go to Dublin alone.\nJohn Paul tries to move on with his life. He begins attending Hollyoaks Community College and makes friends with other students. Hannah has recovered from her eating disorder and she and John Paul agree to be friends.

An attraction grows between Kieron and John Paul, but Kieron refuses to break his vow of celibacy. Eventually, Kieron cannot deny his feeling for John Paul any longer and they begin seeing each other in secret. Myra is furious when she discovers the relationship, but John Paul tells her she needs to let him make his own choices. Kieron decides to leave the church and they take their relationship public. John Paul proposes to Kieron who joyfully accepts.\nA while later, John Paul realises he is too young to get married and calls off the engagement, but he still wants to be with Kieron. John Paul is stunned when Craig returns to the village. Kieron accuses John Paul of not being over Craig, but John Paul insists he is.

Finn agrees to reunite with Amber and their daughter, and later leaves.\nDevelopment\nCreation and characterisation\nJohn Paul McQueen was created in 2006; the backstory given to the character is that he grew up with five sisters (Jacqui, Mercedes, Tina, Carmel, and Michaela), his mum (Myra), and no father. He is characterised as smart, witty, and not afraid to stand up for himself and his beliefs. Sutton described his portrayal of John Paul's personality as different and similar to his own. \"He's very, very quick to take [offence] sometimes\", Sutton relayed. \"He's a bit up and down, so that's a side of him I'm not too keen on, but he's also very sensitive and loving and he cares a lot about his family and his friends and that side of it is very true to me as well and that's kind of what I kind of brought to the table.\" Sutton stated that he had no trouble portraying a gay character because he had \"spent a good part of [his] youth [in the theater] and there were a lot of openly gay men\".\nSexuality\nWhen detailing insight he gained about the gay community while portraying John Paul, Sutton stated, \"My character was straight when I first started so I had to do the whole sort of questioning your sexuality and finding out who you are and what you're about and what your likes are and what your sexual preferences are, so I got a real insight from the storyline and just how hard it is.\" Sutton cited that John Paul \"was very, very lucky in that his family were pretty much all supportive\". Further detailing his character's personality and how he did not want John Paul to be a gay stereotype, Sutton revealed, \"I was very, very keen to make this character a straight-acting gay man. He's just a normal guy, like any other guy. He plays football. He likes music. He likes going out. He likes all the same things that straight men like. He just happens to like blokes, and that's it.\" It was a joint effort by the writers and Sutton to characterise the character this way. \"We kind of met in the middle and that was the path we wanted to go down\", stated Sutton. \"I think it was really important for people to see because, like I say, even now, especially older generations, often in my mind view the stereotype of the gay man as this kind of screaming queen with glitter and all that kind of … feather boas and glitter and you know, Danny La Rue.\"\nDeparture (2008)\nIn 2008, Sutton decided to leave the role of John Paul, stating that it was not an easy decision to make. \"I'm twenty-five-years old and I've done this character for two years now\", he cited, \"and I feel like I've made my mark and I've got to get off my soapbox now. I kind of feel like I'm ready to take a risk before I hit 30 and realize that actually I've missed my opportunity. A calculated risk.\"\nReintroduction (2012)\nOn 12 October 2012, Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy revealed that Sutton had returned to Hollyoaks. The actor was seen back on the set, shortly after agreeing to reprise his role as John Paul. He had entered talks about a return with the show's producers earlier in the year. Kilkelly reported that little was known about John Paul's return storyline, but he would be seen on-screen in time for Christmas. He returned on 18 December 2012. At Christmas a baby was left on the McQueen's doorstep and it was revealed to be John Paul's. After speaking with his mother Myra, John Paul decided to keep his son and named him Matthew.\nHomophobic bullying and male rape\nIn January 2014, John Paul became the focus of an issue-led story when he is raped by his student, Finn O'Connor (Keith Rice), after enduring months of homophobic bullying from Finn and Robbie Roscoe (Charlie Wernham). Planning for the story by the production team began in 2012 due to the extensive research required to portray the issue. The plot marks the second time Hollyoaks has tackled the issue, having previously explored it in 2000 when Luke Morgan (Gary Lucy) was raped. Bryan Kirkwood, the show's executive producer, stated that the story would be explored \"within the constraints of a tea-time soap\". He also wanted to showcase the \"far-reaching consequences\" for John Paul, Finn and their respective families. He also complimented Sutton and Rice, who he thought would perform the plot with \"skill and empathy\".\nHollyoaks worked with multiple charities, including Stonewall, St Mary's Sexual Assault Referral, Survivors Manchester and Survivors UK. Richard Lane, the media manager at Stonewall, commented that the soap contacted them to make the story \"realistic and sensitive\". Survivors Manchester became heavily involved in the storyline and Sutton went onto become an ambassador to the charity. Duncan Craig, founder of the charity, was impressed by the work of the cast and crew across the story, which he called \"a culturally important milestone\". He thought it would form a good example when he performed seminars about the issue. Craig added that the story would help the charities providing \"services to males to break the silence\". Sutton visited the charity to understand how to tackle the story and explained that the story would explore the \"consequences of what happens to the character\", as well as \"how it changes him as a person\". Additionally, he expressed his interest in portraying the story.\nFinn, Robbie and other students begin bullying John Paul at school by insulting him and planning \"malicious stunts in the classroom\". After John Paul discovers evidence that could implicate Finn and Robbie, Finn argues with John Paul, before raping him at school. A press release from Hollyoaks explained that Finn is heterosexual, but attacks John Paul as \"an act of aggression\" and \"an attempt to assert power over him\". In the aftermath, John Paul began to blame himself for the assault. Sutton explained that John Paul believes that since he did not \"fight back\", he cannot justify it and is to blame for the incident. Consequently, John Paul is wondering \"why he didn't do anything\". Sutton added that the character feels \"ashamed\", \"dirty\" and judged following the assault. He also mentioned that John Paul is changed as a person by the attack, commenting, \"You see this outgoing, confident man be completely destroyed\".\nDeparture (2017)\nOn 11 January 2017, it was announced that Sutton was leaving his role as John Paul. The Sun newspaper reported that John Paul was set to meet a grisly ending after driving off the edge of a cliff in his car in dramatic scenes airing later in the year. However, bosses remained tight-lipped as to whether it would actually be John Paul's exit storyline or not.\nReintroduction (2019)\nOn 18 March 2019, it was announced that Sutton had reprised his role for a cameo appearance in one episode that month. John Paul returns for the wedding of his parents, Myra and Sally St. Claire (Annie Wallace). Sutton filmed a video appearance, which was played to the congression at the wedding. The actor was unable to commit to a longer return due to commitments in theatre.\nIt was confirmed on 19 July 2019 that two former cast members would be returning on a permanent basis in the build-up to Hollyoaks twenty-fifth anniversary during the following year. Sutton's return was announced five days later, following the announcement of Jamie Lomas' return as Warren Fox the previous day. Sutton expressed his delight at reprising the role, calling John Paul \"a character that [he cares] deeply about\". Executive producer Kirkwood called the character \"one of the most beloved characters in Hollyoaks history\" and was pleased that he would be returning. He explained that he wanted John Paul to become a \"figurehead\" at Hollyoaks High School and bring order to the McQueen household as he returns for \"another groundbreaking chapter\".\nKirkwood invited Sutton for dinner, where he asked him to reprise his role. The actor was surprised, but flattered to be asked to return, especially since the soap had recently won a Best Soap award. In his absence, John Paul reunited with Craig, but they have separated when John Paul returns. Sutton explained that Craig leaves John Paul for his personal trainer. He confirmed that the split would be discussed and it is \"not glossed over\". Kirkwood revealed that he also invited Burnet back to the cast, but he declined the offer. He explained that it would be foolish not to reintroduce John Paul because of this. On the characters' relationship, Kirkwood commented, \"I see them as having a lifetime of tortured romance — that will inevitably mean the occasional break-up.\"\nThe character returns for two episodes broadcast on 9 and 10 December 2019 prior to a permanent return on 2 January 2020. His initial return focuses on John Paul seeing Finn again following his release from prison. Craig (Survivors Manchester) saw Sutton's return as an opportunity to raise more awareness on male sexual violence. He also looked forward to seeing how John Paul \"continues his healing journey\" as a male survivor. Rice looked forward to working with Sutton on the story again. John Paul is called by Sally and Edward Hutchinson (Joe McGann) who want his help in getting Finn to leave the village. He initially refuses, but after speaking to James, he decides to confront Finn. Sutton explained that John Paul finds it hard to see Finn because that is the reason he left the village. He added that John Paul is \"still very afraid of what Finn might do\" so seeing him face-to-face is a struggle and \"very difficult\". The actor enjoyed filming John Paul's reunion with Finn and believed the storyline was \"complicated\" and \"a lot more fluid and subjective than many storylines\". He added, \"Whether or not you can rehabilitate someone who's done something so heinous is quite an interesting question to ask of an audience.\" The confrontation concluded with Finn's departure and John Paul announcing that he would return to the village after revisiting Singapore.\nJohn Paul returns and is appointed the deputy headteacher at the school. The job establishes the character as part of the show's year-long county lines drug trafficking storyline, which incorporates many families. Sutton looked forward to being involved in the story and working with the younger cast, calling them \"wonderful and so talented\". John Paul also reconnects with James after returning to the village. Sutton opined that they have \"a complicated history\", which would be explored. The actor was excited to work with Finnegan again. John Paul's relationship with the McQueen family, in particular with Mercedes, is explored upon his return. Sutton thought John Paul and Mercedes were \"a lovely brother and sister combination\" and observed how they were \"each other's confidants\" because they are similar ages and get on well. He added that he felt they shared a sibling relationship in real life too.\nFollowing his return, Sutton appears as John Paul in a special episode of Hollyoaks Later. The plot focuses on the conclusion of Breda McQueen's (Moya Brady) serial killer storyline. John Paul features in the story as he works with Mercedes to expose Breda. In a meeting with Kirkwood, Sutton was informed about his role in the story's finale, which he found exciting. While Mercedes searches Breda's pig farm, John Paul confronts her in the flat. Sutton explained that John Paul is confident as he prepares to speak with Breda, but when he actually sits opposite her, he becomes scared and realises that \"he's in a very dangerous position\".\nDeparture (2025–2026)\nIn September 2025, it was reported Sutton had quit the role. John Paul's exit, described as an \"explosive storyline\", will air sometime in 2026 as part of the soap's thirtieth anniversary.\nReception\nAfterElton.com stated that when they did a poll of their readers in 2007 for The 25 Best Gay Characters on Television, John Paul came in at #21. Sutton had not known about the poll, and when told of it stated, \"Wow. That's really cool. I don't tend to read too much press and stuff, but I mean I'm aware that we've sold the program to other countries and surfing through the Internet, I'm aware that there are people who really, really watch it. I mean I've heard from the States and there's a couple of people who are in the Far East, actually, who regularly post on forums about me and stuff. And that's just incredible.\"\nSutton's pairing with actor Guy Burnet, as John Paul and Craig, has also been successful, winning several LGBT awards. Sutton stated that he had spoken to young gay men and had e-mail conversations with people about his character and that it \"really\" opened his eyes to how difficult it can be and that \"there is still prejudice out there and there are still people who are living this.\" He added, \"We call it Middle England way out here. I don't know what you call it\", a reference to Middle America.\nWhen asked how popular his John Paul character is in the United Kingdom, Sutton relayed, \"It's incredibly, incredibly popular over here, the show. We broadcast an omnibus edition Sunday morning, which every student watches. Right now we're on five nights a week and it's an incredibly popular show, especially with young people.\" Sutton stated that the reaction he and the cast get is \"sometimes a bit frightening, but it's really, really big business\". Detailing how recognized he is when walking down the streets of Liverpool or London, Sutton revealed, \"Oh, pretty recognizable. Pretty recognizable. My girlfriend gets it worse than I do, actually. She gets pushed out of the way by people trying to get to me sometimes. She's my girlfriend and my official photographer. All these f**king cameras – pardon my language – these camera phones that people have right now. The bane of my existence.\"\nVirgin Media compiled a list of their \"Sexiest soap opera couples\", they included John Paul and Craig in the list and stated: \"The love affair between the Hollyoaks students gripped viewers so much that they started their own campaign for the pair to ride off into the sunset together. They got their wish, and we like to think that Craig and John Paul are now living happily ever after together in Dublin...\"\nIn September 2012, Inside Soap named John Paul and Craig's exit as their number 1 happy ending, \"This tentative, tremulous, tortured romance is still regarded by Hollyoaks fans as one of the show's greatest-ever storylines – if not the greatest. So fervently were viewers wishing for a happy ending for gay teenager John Paul and his no-I'm-not-gay-but-maybe-I-am friend Craig, the producer even promised a happy ending in advance. And so, as they flew off to Dublin together, they kissed in front of a holiday poster of a sunset. Aw!\"\nOn John Paul's romantic life, Joe Anderton of Digital Spy in 2019 observed, \"John Paul always comes running back to the village, newly single and ready to sleep with every available gay and/or bisexual man around (including those who shouldn't be available).\"\nSee also\n*John Paul McQueen and Craig Dean\n*List of soap opera villains\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.channel4.com/programmes/hollyoaks/profiles/all/john-paul-mcqueen-james-sutton/495 John Paul McQueen] at Channel4.com"
