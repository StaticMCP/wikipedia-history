(; Belgians, Rise up!), is a French-speaking political movement in Belgium, founded and led by  Belgian MP Laurent Louis, who was previously associated with the right-wing party People's Party and then the Islamist party ISLAM.\nHistory\n2011-2015\nWhen he left the People's Party in 2011, Laurent Louis founded the Movement for Freedom and Democracy (Mouvement pour la liberté et la démocratie), which aimed to establish participatory democracy and put an end to political parties. In 2013, the movement was dissolved for a brief period when Laurent Louis joined the ISLAM party.\nIn 2014, he relaunched the MLD under the name Debout les Belges (Stand Up, Belgians). The new party adopted a socially conservative, Belgian nationalist, anti-Zionist, Eurosceptic and republican agenda.\nThe party was associated with French comedian Dieudonné and the quenelle gesture which he has popularized, often considered a subversive allusion to the Nazi salute. Although its leader has criticized Alain Soral, another important leader of Reconciliation Nationale. The group has been accused of antisemitism and a planned gathering of notable anti-Zionists organized by Louis was banned in 2014.\nIn the 2014 Belgian federal election, DLB obtained 0.86% of the votes in the Chamber of Representatives, placing the party just below the People's Party with 1.52%.\nFor the Regional elections, the party obtained 0.81% in Wallonia. In Brussels, DLB obtained 2.3%, surpassing the People's Party (1.94%) and ISLAM (1.7%).\nHowever, the party did not win any seats anywhere.\nThe party was finally dissolved in 2015 following internal conflicts and legal proceedings.\nSince 2025\nBetween 2015 and 2025, Laurent Louis made several attempts to launch a new political party alongside his activities in cryptocurrencies for which he had been in trouble with the law but never convicted.\nIt was finally in 2025 that he officially launched his new political movement, with Laurence Kayser following his victory in court against Opaline Meunier.\nRévolution focuses on establishing e-democracy through Web3 technologies and the abolition of all political parties.\nAt the same time, the movement promotes its anti-Zionist and Eurosceptic positions and advocates leaving NATO and the WHO.\nElection results\nChamber of Representatives\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
