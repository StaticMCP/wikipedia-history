The Kings received the eighth overall pick in the 1994 NBA draft, and selected power forward Brian Grant out of Xavier University, and signed free agent Frank Brickowski during the off-season; however, Brickowski would miss the entire regular season due to a preseason shoulder injury.\nWith the addition of Grant, and second-round draft pick Michael Smith out of Providence College, and replacing Lionel Simmons as the team's starting small forward with Walt Williams, the Kings played above .500 basketball for the first half of the regular season with a 25–20 record at the All-Star break. However, after a 28–20 start, they struggled with a 7-game losing streak afterwards and began to slip under .500.\nOn the final day of the regular season on April 23, 1995, the Kings faced off against the Denver Nuggets at the McNichols Sports Arena for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference; the Nuggets would win, 102–89, as the Kings finished in fifth place in the Pacific Division with a 39–43 record, missing the NBA playoffs for the ninth consecutive year.\nMitch Richmond led the team in scoring with 22.8 points per game, led them with 156 three-point field goals, and was named to the All-NBA Second Team. In addition, Williams showed improvement, averaging 16.4 points and 1.6 steals per game along with 103 three-point field goals, while Grant averaged 13.2 points, 7.5 rebounds and 1.5 blocks per game, and was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team, Spud Webb contributed 11.6 points and 6.2 assists per game, Olden Polynice provided the team with 10.8 points and 9.0 rebounds per game, and Smith averaged 6.9 points and 5.9 rebounds per game off the bench.\nDuring the NBA All-Star weekend at the America West Arena in Phoenix, Arizona, Richmond was selected for the 1995 NBA All-Star Game, as a member of the Western Conference All-Star team; Richmond scored 23 points off the bench, and was named the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player, as the Western Conference defeated the Eastern Conference, 139–112. Meanwhile, Grant and Smith were both selected for the NBA Rookie Game, as members of the Green team.\nWilliams finished tied in ninth place in Most Improved Player voting, while Grant finished tied in fifth place in Rookie of the Year voting. Following the season, Webb was traded back to his former team, the Atlanta Hawks, while Brickowski was traded back to his former team, the Seattle SuperSonics, and Randy Brown signed with the Chicago Bulls.\nFor the season, the Kings revealed a new primary logo with the team name on a purple ribbon with a silver crown and jousting sticks, and changed their uniforms adding purple and black to their color scheme, plus adding new half black, and half purple alternate road uniforms with checkered flag side panels. The home and road jerseys both remained in use until 2002, while the primary logo lasted until 2016, and the alternate jerseys lasted until 1997.\nDraft picks\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\"\n!
