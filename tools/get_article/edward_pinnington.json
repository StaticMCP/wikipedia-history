He is mainly known for his authoritative biographies of Scottish artists but he also wrote several articles on Robert Burns and his family.\nLife\nAccording to census records, Edward Pinnington was born in Blairgowrie, Perthshire in 1846, though no birth records are available to confirm this. His father was John Hardman Pinnington, an Excise Officer, and his mother, Ann Fishwick. The family seems to originate from Lancashire, England and they lived in various parts of Scotland, namely, the 1841 census: Rose Street, Dundee; and the 1851 census: Logie in Clackmannanshire. The family eventually settled in the Rowans, Cupar Road, Auchtermuchty. Pinnington married Margaret Forbes (1861–1936) on 21 October 1885 in Edinburgh.  They subsequently had three sons John Noel (1886–1917), Edward Forbes (1888–1939) and Donald Stanley (1891–1976) who was awarded an OBE and Lloyd's Medal for Bravery at Sea during the Battle of the Atlantic. Edward Pinnington died in Thornton, Fife on 22 June 1921, aged 75.\nCareer\nAccording to his obituary, Pinnington began his working life as a journalist in the United States and was for a number of years the editor of Scotch American. However, there is as yet no corroborating record of this part of his life, though his style of writing suggests a training in journalism. In 1881, he was living in Edinburgh and by 1891 he had settled in Montrose, living with his spinster sister, Mary Ann, while his wife and family lived with her parents in Glasgow. It seems that his interest in art history began when he researched and published the life and work of the Montrose artist, George Paul Chalmers. Only a hundred copies of this massive tome were printed in 1896, and it is likely that Pinnington was commissioned to write and edit it. Between 1896 and 1912, he produced a formidable stream of books and articles and was an art critic for several Scottish newspapers. It appears that around 1912, the family moved to Argentina. At any rate, his wife and two elder sons are recorded as incoming passengers from Buenos Aires arriving at Liverpool on 22 October 1914. Pinnington himself presumably returned separately. According to his obituary, the family settled in Auchtermuchty at the family home, around 1914. Pinnington seems to have published nothing thereafter, though extracts from his unpublished biography of Sam Bough were published in The Carlisle Journal in 1922, after his death (for details see below).\nUnpublished letters\nTwenty one letters and a postcard written by Pinnington to George B. Simpson (1820–1892) have survived. They are held in the Royal Scottish Academy's George B. Simpson Collection. These cover the period from 9 March 1891 to 29 September 1891. They mainly concern Pinnington's research into George Paul Chalmers though there is also mention of Pinnington's articles on Robert Burns\nPublications\nArt books\n* The Art Collection of the Corporation of Glasgow.
