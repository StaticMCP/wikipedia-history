She was queen consort from 1468, until her husband's death in 1469, after which she was honoured as Queen Dowager Inhye () during her adoptive son, King Seongjong's reign, and later as Grand Queen Dowager Inhye () during her grandnephew, King Yeonsangun's reign.\nBiography\nThe future Queen Ansan was born on 18 April 1445 into the Cheongju Han clan, as the second child and eldest daughter of Han Baek-ryun and his second wife, Lady Im of the Pungcheon Im clan.\nOn her paternal side, Lady Han was a fifth cousin to Queen Jangsun and Queen Gonghye as they shared Han Ak as their ancestor. She was also a fourth cousin once removed to Queen Sohye,  as they also shared Han Ak as their ancestor.\nIn 1462, Crown Princess Han, the Crown Princess Consort of the then Crown Prince Yi Hwang, died. As Lady Han was born in the same year as Ansun, she was chosen as a concubine of Crown Prince Yi Hwang in 1463 and received the title of So-hun (junior 5th rank); thereafter she was known as Royal Consort So-hun of the Cheongju Han clan and lived temporarily within the residence of Dong Palace. Although she was not a primary consort, she received the treatment of one.\nRoyal Consort So-hun gave birth to two daughters and two sons, including Yi Hyeon, Grand Prince Jean and Princess Hyeonsuk, however only one prince and one princess survived through childhood.\nIn 1468, the Crown Prince took over the throne and became the 8th Joseon King, after Sejo abdicated due to illness. Consort So-hun was the one nominated by the former King to become the new Queen Consort. Since she was nearly due to give birth at that time, guards were sent to her maternal home to guide the future Queen.\nHer time as Queen Consort was short, as her husband died only 13 months after his ascension and, to make the situation worse, her son, Grand Prince Jean, was deemed too young to be invested as the new King. Hence, her mother-in-law, Queen Dowager Jaseong and Han Myŏnghoe, the Chief State Councillor at that time, chose Prince Jasan, Han Myŏnghoe's son-in-law and Yejong's nephew, to become the successor. Since the Queen was the former King's wife, she was legally the mother of the new monarch, Yi Hyeol, King Seongjong, and was honored as Queen Dowager Inhye ().\nConflicts happened when the King's deceased father, Crown Prince Uigyeong, was posthumously declared as King, which made his widow, Crown Princess Consort Su (Seongjong's mother), a Queen Dowager (with the honorary name Insu). Because there was a need to determine the seniority between Inhye and Insu, Grand Queen Dowager Jaseong, as the eldest member of the Royal Family, solved the problem by declaring that Insu was entrusted with the task of protecting Yejong by the late Sejo of Joseon, implying her seniority above both King Yejong and Queen Dowager Inhye.\nSeongjong's wife died in 1474, at the age 17, and was posthumously honoured as Queen Gonghye. The Ksitigarbha Pranidahana Sutra (The Great Vows of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva) was commissioned by the three Queens Dowager through the Royal Treasury Agency. This Sutra is now considered an important artifact for the study of printing and Buddhism during the Joseon Dynasty.\nGrand Queen Dowager Jaseong died in 1483, and was posthumously honoured as Queen Jeonghui. Her death made Inhye the most senior member of the royal family after Queen Insu.\nAfter Seongjong's death, in 1494, Inhye was honoured as Grand Queen Dowager Inhye.\nShe died at the age of 53, during the reign of her grandnephew, Yeonsangun, and was posthumously known as Queen Ansun ().\nFamily\nParents\n* Father − Han Baek-ryun (; 1427–1474)\n* Mother\n** Step - Lady Hwang of the Hoideok Hwang clan (회덕 황씨 懷德 黃氏; 1425–?)\n** Biological - Internal Princess Consort Seoha of the Pungcheon Im clan (; 1432–1472), Han Baek-ryun's second wife\nSibling\n* Older brother − Han Hwan (; 1441–?)\n* Younger sister − Princess Consort Cheonan of the Cheongju Han clan (; 1447–?)\n* Younger brother − Han Yeol (; 1449–?)\n* Younger sister - Lady Han of the Cheongju Han clan (; 1451–?); Nam Hyo-won's first wife\n* Younger brother − Han Hang (; 1451–?)\n* Younger brother − Han Sun (; 1453–1541)\n* Younger sister − Lady Han of the Cheongju Han clan (; 1459–?)\n* Younger sister - Lady Han of the Cheongju Han clan (; 1465–?)\nConsort\n* Yi Hwang, King Yejong (; 14 January 1450 – 31 December 1469)\nIssue\n* Daughter - Princess Hyeonsuk (; 1464–1502)\n* Son - Yi Hyeon, Grand Prince Jean (; 13 February 1466 – 14 December 1525).\n* Daughter - Princess Hyesun (; September 1468 – 5 August 1469)\n* Unnamed grand prince (; 1468–1472)\nIn popular culture\n* Portrayed by Lee In-hye and Kim Eun-ju in the 1994 KBS2 TV series Han Myeong-hoe.\n* Portrayed by Choi Eun-sook in the 1995 KBS2 TV series Jang Nok Soo.\n* Portrayed by Gyeong In-seon in the 1998–2000 KBS TV series King and Queen.\n* Portrayed by Lee Jae-in in the SBS 2007–2008 TV series The King and I.\n* Portrayed by Lee Yeon-doo and Kim Won-hee in the 2011–2012 JTBC TV series Insu, The Queen Mother.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n| as = sole grand queen dowager\n}}"
