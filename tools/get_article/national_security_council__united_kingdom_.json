The Council's terms of reference were said in September 2022 to include matters relating to national security, foreign policy, defence, trade, international relations, development, resilience and resource security. As of 2024, the meetings are held weekly.\nThe NSC has counterparts in the national security councils of many other nations. The incumbent National Security Adviser (NSA) is Jonathan Powell.\nHistory\nThe then National Security Council was established on 12 May 2010 by Prime Minister David Cameron. The NSC formalised national security decision making, which had previously been carried out in informal groups largely composed of officials. It increased the power of the Prime Minister, who chairs the council, and brought senior Cabinet ministers into national security policy making, giving them access to the highest levels of intelligence. It coordinates responses to threats faced by the United Kingdom and integrates at the highest level the work of relevant government entities with respect to national security. The council reflected the central coordination of national security issues seen in the Committee of Imperial Defence, which operated from 1902 until 1947, while also being partly modelled on the United States National Security Council.\nThe first National Security Adviser (NSA) was also appointed on 12 May 2010.\nFrom 1 April 2015 the council oversaw the newly created Conflict, Stability and Security Fund, a fund of more than £1 billion per year for tackling conflict and instability abroad. Following a critical inquiry into the fund by the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy in 2016, where the committee stated that the fund was secretive and \"There is a risk that the CSSF is being used as a 'slush fund' [for projects that do not] meet the needs of UK national security\", fund spending at the country level was disclosed and an annual report produced.\nIn April 2019, an inquiry, which could lead to criminal proceedings, was announced into the leaking to The Daily Telegraph of a decision by the NSC to allow Huawei to bid for 'non-core' elements of the construction of the prospective 5G network.\nIn the early months of Johnson's premiership, several sub-committees of the NSC ceased to exist. Additionally, the NSC met weekly during the ministries of David Cameron and Theresa May, but didn't meet at all between January and May 2020, under Boris Johnson. Johnson's non-use of the NSC has been criticised.\nThe Council was briefly renamed the Foreign Policy and Security Council (FPSC) under Prime Minister Liz Truss. The list of Cabinet Committees published 3 November 2022, confirmed the name had been changed back to National Security Council under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.\nIn September 2024, it was reported that Prime Minister Keir Starmer had begun holding weekly meetings for the first time in years.\nSince December 2024, when the role of National Security Adviser was taken up by a political appointee, the role of secretary to the National Security Council has been fulfilled by the Deputy National Security Advisers.\nMembership\nAs of October 2024, the National Security Council considers the strategic approach to national security, foreign policy, resilience, international relations, economic security, trade, development, defence and global issues. Its membership is as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Image\n! Member\n!

From July 2010, there were two Deputy National Security Advisers (DNSAs): Julian Miller for Foreign & Defence Policy and Oliver Robbins for Intelligence, Security & Resilience. By March 2013, Hugh Powell&nbsp;– previously a National Security Secretariat Director&nbsp;– had been promoted to a newly created third DNSA position.  As of 6 November 2014, there were three DNSAs: Hugh Powell as DNSA (Foreign Policy), Julian Miller as DNSA (Defence, Nuclear and Strategy) and Paddy McGuinness as DNSA (Intelligence, Security & Resilience). As of early December 2014, the National Security Secretariat was staffed by 180 officials and comprises five directorates: Foreign & Defence Policy; the Civil Contingencies Secretariat; Security & Intelligence; the Office of Cyber Security and Information Assurance, and UK Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT UK). As of 10 February 2015, Liane Saunders&nbsp;– previously the National Security Secretariat's Director for Foreign Policy and its Afghanistan/Pakistan Coordinator&nbsp;– was described as an Acting Deputy National Security Adviser (Conflict, Stability and Foreign Policy).\nOn 16 June 2016, the Cabinet Office released staff data, correct as of 31 March 2016, listing two current Deputy National Security Advisers: Paddy McGuinness (responsible for Intelligence, Security and Resilience) and then Brigadier Gwyn Jenkins (responsible for Conflict, Stability & Defence). Jenkins appeared to have been in post since at least June 2015. Prior to becoming a deputy National Security Adviser, Jenkins was the military assistant to prime minister David Cameron.\nAs of April 2017, it was announced that a diplomat, Christian Turner, had replaced Jenkins as the second Deputy National Security Adviser, with a portfolio comprising 'foreign and defence policy.' According to one of Turner's tweets, dated 13 April 2017, his first week as Deputy National Security Adviser was the week commencing Monday 10 April 2017. Turner is now the High Commissioner to Pakistan. Turner was replaced by David Quarrey in July 2019.\nIt was reported on 14 January 2018 that Paddy McGuinness was leaving the national security secretariat. His successor as deputy national security adviser for intelligence, security and resilience, Richard Moore, announced his appointment on 8 January via his personal Twitter account. Moore's tenure as deputy NSA was relatively brief (circa three months), ending in early April when he returned to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as Political Director, a move he also announced via Twitter on 8 April. Although unconfirmed publicly by the UK government, Madeleine Alessandri had replaced Moore as the second deputy national security adviser. However, in September 2018, Alessandri's name and appointment was mentioned in a government response to the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament and a list of government salaries. Alessandri apparently took up her appointment in July 2018. Alessandri has left her Deputy NSA post to work in the Northern Ireland Office in January 2020. Alessandri has been replaced by Beth Sizeland while Alex Ellis has also been added as a deputy with the title 'Deputy National Security Adviser for the Integrated Review on diplomacy, development and defence'. Sizeland's appointment was confirmed in an oral evidence by Mark Sedwill, however, as of 25 May 2020, her appointment has not been updated on the Cabinet Office website.\nAs of October 2020, Quarrey has taken over the post of acting NSA while Lord Frost remains Chief Negotiator for the European Union talks. On 29 January 2021, it was announced that Stephen Lovegrove, not Frost, would be appointed as National Security Adviser. In April 2022, Quarrey was appointed as the UK's Permanent Representative to NATO. He was succeeded by Sarah Macintosh. Beth Sizeland was succeeded by Matthew Collins at an unknown date and the title was retitled as Deputy National Security Adviser (Intelligence, Defence and Security). As of March 2025, there were reportedly three deputy National Security Advisers - Matthew Collins, Jonathan Black, and Nick Catsaras - although the precise dates of their appointments and distribution of responsibilities is not available on the Gov.uk website.\nSee also\n* British intelligence agencies\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/national-security-council Cabinet Office – National Security Council]\n*[http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/national-security Cabinet Office – National Security]\n*[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-cabinet-committees-system-and-list-of-cabinet-committees Cabinet Committees]\n*[http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/national-security-council Institute for Government/King's College London – The National Security Council: national security at the centre of government]"
