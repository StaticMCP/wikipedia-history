It has a population of 65,295 and is part of Chamber Taluka located in the south of the district at 25°19'5N 68°43'20E. It is one of the largest Union Councils of the District.\nEnvironment\nThe union council has a fresh environment but unfortunately located at the tail of water distributary minors like Zanur and Miran khori. Moreover, poor provincial administration and political influential lords make available water resources meager for the common people / peasants. The people of the vicinity face huge problem of drinking water which is rarely available from water supply scheme or water treatment plants and boring water is also undrinkable.\nEducation\nThe education system is well developed with primary and elementary schools separate for boys and girls but no staff. Owing to this, students have to travel far away to nearby city, town schools for acquiring education. The literacy ratio is about 50% and improvement in this direction is still awaited .\nHealth\nThe health system is also good but needs progress.\nVILLAG- ghulam Hussain in Dispensry\nAdministration\nMr. Nabi Bux Lund is Nazim of the union council.  The District Government is taking good decision for the progress of this union council.\nSee also\n* Ramapir Temple Tando Allahyar\nReferences"
