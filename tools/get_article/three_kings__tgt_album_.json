It was released on August 20, 2013 on Atlantic Records.\nCritical reception\n| rev2 = Independent Online\n| rev2Score =\n| rev3 = PopMatters\n| rev3Score = 6/10\n}}\nAllMusic editor Andy Kellman called Three Kings an \"hourlong affair that doesn't deviate much from any of the men's recent solo work [...] It's heavy on slow jams and ballads, drawing from elder leaders of the form, such as the Isley Brothers, Roger Troutman, and R. Kelly. Some of the songs are as strong as anything from the members' 2010s solo work, but not much truly stands out.\" Brent Faulkner from PopMatters called Three Kings a \"good and enjoyable R&B album. \"Great\" might be a stretch given the exhaustive length and overplay on sex and the profane, but there are plenty of pros about this effort. The biggest triumph is how well Tyrese, Ginuwine, and Tank blend vocally. Even when the material could use a boost, TGT impress vocally.\" Independent Onlines Munya Vomo found that the album \"was worth the wait [...] The album has a number of baby-making songs which comes as no surprise since the singers’ individual projects were about that too.\"\nCommercial performance\nThree Kings debuted at number three on the us Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 76,000 copies in the United States. The album also opened at number one on the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, becoming Tank's fourth, Ginuwine's third and Tyrese first album to do so.\nTrack listing\n| extra1        = Fabbien Nahounou\n| length1       = 4:23\n| title2        = No Fun\n| note2         = featuring Problem\n| writer2       =\n| extra2        = }}\n| length2       = 4:00\n| title3        = Sex Never Felt Better\n| writer3       =\n| extra3        = }}\n| length3       = 4:13\n| title4        = I Need\n| writer4       =\n| extra4        = }}\n| length4       = 4:35\n| title5        = Next Time Around\n| writer5       = Babbs\n| extra5        = Tank\n| length5       = 3:47\n| title6        = Interlude\n| writer6       = Gibson\n| extra6        = Tim & Bob\n| length6       = 1:00\n| title7        = Hurry\n| writer7       =\n| extra7        = Tim & Bob\n| length7       = 3:19\n| title8        = Weekend Love\n| writer8       =\n| extra8        = The Underdogs\n| length8       = 3:56\n| title9        = Lessons In Love\n| writer9       =\n| extra9        =\n| length9       = 3:53\n| title10       = Interlude\n| writer10      = Gibson\n| extra10       = Focus...\n| length10      = 1:05\n| title11       = Explode\n| writer11      =\n| extra11       = B.A.M.\n| length11      = 3:52\n| title12       = FYH\n| writer12      =\n| extra12       = B.A.M.\n| length12      = 4:09\n| title13       = OMG\n| writer13      =\n| extra13       = B.A.M.\n| length13      = 3:57\n| title14       = Running Back\n| writer14      =\n| extra14       = B.A.M.\n| length14      = 4:44\n| title15       = Burn Out\n| writer15      =\n| extra15       =\n| length15      = 3:41\n| title16       = Tearing It Down\n| writer16      =\n| extra16       = Tank\n| length16      = 4:23\n| title17       = Our House\n| writer17      =\n| extra17       = The Underdogs\n| length17      = 4:34\n| total_length  = 63:32\n}}\n| total_length  = 66:74\n| title18       = All for You\n| writer18      =\n| extra18       = The Underdogs\n| length18      = 3:21\n| title19       = Between the Lines\n| writer19      =\n| extra19       = }}\n| length19      = 3:42\n}}\nNotes\n* denotes co-producer(s)\nSample credits\n* \"No Fun\" contains a sample of \"Ain't No Fun (If the Homies Can't Have None)\", as performed by Snoop Dogg.\n* \"Explode\" contains a sample of \"I Wanna Rock\", as performed by Luke.\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from Allmusic.\n* Andrew Hey – guitars, recording engineer\n* Agape Jerry – guitars\n* Javad Day – keyboards\n* Mansur Zafr – drum programming\n* Ivan \"Orthodox\" Barias – drum programming\n* Michael \"Mike Jay\" Jimenez – background vocals\n* Harvey Mason, Jr. – keyboards, vocal production, mixing\n* David Boyd – assistant engineer\n* Michael Daley – drum programming, assistant engineer\n* Richard Furch – recording engineer, mixing, editing\n* Tyrese Gibson – primary artist, mixing, executive producer\n* Ginuwine – primary artist, executive producer\n* Tank – primary artist, producer, executive producer\n* Trina Bowman – production coordinator\n* Dave Kutch – mastering\n* Marc Baptiste – photography\n* Mark Obriski – art direction, design\n* Mitchell \"M.O.\" Owens – additional production\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+Weekly chart performance for Three Kings\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2013)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Korean International Albums (Gaon)\n|76\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Albums (OCC)\n|95\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK R&B Albums (OCC)\n|9\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Billboard 200\n|3\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums (Billboard)\n|1\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+2013 year-end chart performance for Three Kings\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2013)\n!scope=\"col\"|Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Billboard 200\n|143\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums (Billboard)\n|33\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+2014 year-end chart performance for Three Kings\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2014)\n!scope=\"col\"|Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums (Billboard)\n|54\n|}\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Three Kings release history\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Region\n! scope=\"col\"| Date\n! scope=\"col\"| Format(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Label\n! scope=\"col\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | United States\n|August 20, 2013\n|\n|Atlantic\n|\n|}\nReferences"
