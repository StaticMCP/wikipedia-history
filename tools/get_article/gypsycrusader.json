Described as antisemitic and racist by various advocacy groups and the United States Department of Justice, he frequently live streams himself cosplaying as various contemporary popular culture personas. Aside from politics, he is a former journalist, Muay Thai fighter and trainer.\nIn June 2021, Miller pleaded guilty to charges related to unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition, leading to a 41-month-long imprisonment. He is known to have cosplayed as the Joker, the Riddler, Mario, and others while video chatting with strangers on the now-defunct website Omegle. He is known for his advocacy for a race war, espousing white supremacy and neo-Nazism. He has been tied to multiple alt-right and far-right organizations, including the Proud Boys and the boogaloo movement.\nEarly life\nPaul Nicholas Miller was born on August 11, 1988 in New York, to a Roma father and a Mexican mother. At 18 years old, Miller was arrested for shooting several people with a pellet gun.\nFighting career\nMiller began training in Muay Thai in 2008, at the age of 20. He had his first amateur fight in 2008 after only 3 months of training. He trained with the 9 Weapons Muay Thai and later The Institute. He became the Regional Light-Heavyweight Champion and the US National Champion in the World Kickboxing Association. Following a career altering car accident, he then became a trainer and coach, including for The Institute.\nViews and online activity\nJournalism\nBefore his radical and far-right activity, Miller anointed himself as a \"conservative, confrontational journalist\", posting politely confrontational episodes on YouTube.\nOn the evening of October 12, 2018, Miller attended an event at the Metropolitan Republican Club on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York City, where Gavin McInnes, the founder of the Proud Boys, was speaking. Miller went there as a journalist without a portfolio. The event was sold out, and Miller was unable to gain entry. Instead, he shot video outside and livestreamed it on YouTube to show approximately 20 Antifa and left-wing protesters rattling barricades and shouting, \"No Nazis, no KKK, no fascist USA.\"\nMiller claims a member of Antifa knocked his phone out of his hand as he was filming. A short time later, as Miller was heading home, the leader and 10 Antifa followers attacked him. \"It was my first time seeing Antifa up close,” Miller would later say in one of his video sessions.\nA few days later, he sat down for an interview with One America News Network, in which he detailed the events. In the interview, he stated: \"[...] As I ran away from them because they were too many, these 2 men who are heroes—Galvin and Jake. Literally other people would have walk away on the street of New York, these 2 men sat there and help me fight these guys,\". Later it was revealed that these two men were members of the Proud Boys.\nHe claimed he was frequently threatened, doxed, and publicly shamed online — by people he said were affiliated with Antifa and Black Lives Matter. He claimed as a result he lost his gym membership, and with it, his profession as a personal trainer after an onslaught of harassing phone calls to the gym owner, which prompted him to kick Miller out. The same tactics cost him his part-time job pumping gas, he said.\nFar-right activity\n\"That is why I became so fucking radical. That is why I want these fucking niggas, and these fucking Jews, and these fucking communists to face the fucking wall,” he exclaimed in a post on BitChute in October 2018. “Who was gonna stand up for me? There was no one. There are people who will take it all away from you.\"\nAs for Miller in 2018, the enemy initially consisted of specific people — members of Antifa and Black Lives Matter — who attacked him. It later expanded to include all blacks, Jews, and homosexuals.\nHe often expresses his hatred towards racial minorities, fat people, women, and heavily opposes immigration. Miller also calls for a \"race war\" and is a conspiracy theorist who supports the \"Day of the Rope\", a white supremacist slogan that references William Luther Pierce's book The Turner Diaries (1978). In the novel, white supremacists take control of California and engage in mass lynchings of anyone perceived as a \"race traitor\"; these include journalists, politicians, and white people in interracial relationships. The day on which these murders are committed in the novel is referred to as the \"Day of the Rope\" which many neo-Nazis including Miller believe will one day become reality.\nOpinion on minorities\nMiller has shown hostility towards Jews, black people, LGBTQ people, and has frequently denied the Holocaust. He has expressed a desire to \"gas them\" and claims he is \"building an army\" online with the intent of carrying out his violent ideas. In several videos that he published online, he can be seen posing next to Nazi flags and wearing plate carriers brandishing swastikas in form of velcro patches.\nAn open white supremacist, Miller is widely  known for his hatred of black people. Due to his belief that they should be \"sent back to Africa\", he has been described as being a white nationalist. He has also used the phrase \"only white lives matter\" and has antagonized multiple Black Lives Matter protesters at several different protests.\nGeorge Floyd protests\nIn 2020, Miller stated that nobody has a right to protest the murder of George Floyd. He was also connected to the boogaloo movement and allegedly wore a Boogaloo mask during a protest on May 31, 2020.\nMiller attended a Trump rally and told a black woman with a sign that said \"Black Lives Matter\" that \"only white lives matter\" and \"Heil Hitler\" before calling another black woman a \"chimp\". Later that day, Miller drove by a Black Lives Matter rally in East Brunswick, New Jersey, and yelled \"Nigger lives don't matter\" several times at protesters.\nIn 2021, Miller and an unidentified man recorded themselves threatening a black man. Miller told the man to \"Get the fuck out of here\" and said that he and his friend will \"kick [his] ass\". He also referred to the man as a \"nigger\" multiple times and told the man he was in the \"wrong neighborhood\".\nOnline activity\nMiller is an influencer. He often dresses up as various different characters and talks to strangers on online chat websites like (the now defunct) Omegle, where he discusses his political views with the intent of trolling disturbing or angering whomever he is talking to for shock value. He has streamed content using the platforms DLive, Twitch, Bitwave.tv, and reuploaded to BitChute, Internet Archive and his Telegram channel. On Telegram, Miller has over 40,000 followers. and 240,000 followers on Twitter\nHe has been banned on most major social media platforms including Instagram, YouTube, Twitch, DLive, and Facebook.\nHe has been characterized for his racist remarks and inappropriate behavior online. He is also known for his affiliations with fellow white supremacists and internet personalities like Tor Brookes (better known online as CatboyKami) and Brandon Martinez, although he later had a falling out with Brookes.\nLegal issues\nAssault and drug possession charges\nIn 2006, at the age of 18, Miller was charged with aggravated assault. He pled guilty and was not sentenced to jail time.\nIn 2007, Miller was arrested and charged with possession of drugs and intent to sell. He served 180 days in jail and 4 years of probation.\nAntifa incident and fallout\nOn October 12, 2018, Miller was involved in an altercation with Antifa protestors. Miller alleges he was trying to attend a speech given by Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes in order to report on it. The incident took place outside of the Metropolitan Republican Club in New York City. Miller also reported that his backpack was stolen during the altercation. The police unsuccessfully searched for the person who stole Miller's backpack. Miller later stated \"they tried to kill me\" in reference to the altercation and called the attackers \"terrorists\". 20-year old Finbarr Slonim, 20-year old Kai Russo, and 35-year old Caleb Perkins were arrested and charged in connection with the assault.\nFollowing the incident, Miller claimed he had an \"awakening\" and became \"woke\". He was allegedly frequently doxed and bombarded with death threats from people he claims are affiliated with Antifa following their attack on him. He has also claimed that people affiliated with Antifa threatened to burn down his parents' house. His story quickly gained traction on the internet and Miller claims he lost his job and as a result moved to Florida.\n2020 FBI visit\nOn May 21, 2020, FBI agents showed up at Miller's parents' home and tried to reach him. It was revealed that they were sent after him regarding anti-protest statements he had made online and his proposal of an open-carry rally. Once they deemed he was not a threat, no further action was taken.\nAtomwaffen Division harassment\nIn 2021, Miller was targeted by a member of the neo-Nazi organization Atomwaffen Division. It is alleged that Miller was targeted for giving neo-Nazis and white supremacists a \"bad rep\". The attacker recorded videos threatening Miller that were allegedly taken outside of Miller's home in Florida. He also ordered takeout consistently and had it delivered to Miller's home and DoS attacked Miller so that he couldn't stream. Multiple taxis were also sent to Miller's address to pick him up.\nOn January 30, police received numerous calls relating to a suspect allegedly breaking into Miller's home although they were unable to locate the suspect upon arriving at the scene. They were continuously called regarding the alleged robbery upon leaving the scene. Miller later chose to leave his complex for a \"little while\" in hopes of allowing the situation to die down and to protect his neighbors.\n2021 FBI raid and firearm charge\nOn March 2, 2021, Miller was arrested on one charge of possessing a firearm as a convicted felon. According to reports, flashbangs went off during a raid of Miller's home in Fort Lauderdale, which took place at around 5 in the morning. The arrest stemmed from an incident that took place on January 17, 2018, in which Miller illegally possessed a gun. On February 25, 2021, he was indicted on the January 2018 charge. His first hearing took place on March 3. He offered up an apology during the hearing saying \"I'm really sorry for all of this. I really am.\" He also told the judge that he has enough money to hire his own attorney and had reportedly reached out to Mark O'Mara, the attorney who worked for George Zimmerman. He later hired the free speech activist and attorney Norman Kent. On March 10, during his bond trial, he was denied bail and was to remain incarcerated while on trial. On June 22, 2021, Miller pleaded guilty to one count each of possession of a firearm, possession of ammunition and possession of an unregistered firearm. On September 28, Miller was sentenced to 41 months' imprisonment followed by three years' supervised release.\nOn January 31, 2023, Miller was released from prison on good behavior and with parole. In April 2023, USA Today sent federal prison officials a list of questions about his access to the internet while in federal custody. While in prison, Miller had used the internet to harass people and sell racist paraphernalia. After being informed of this, the Federal Bureau of Prisons determined that this constituted a violation of the terms of his imprisonment. Within days, Miller was sent back to prison. He was released once again on July 2, 2023.\nNotes\nReferences"
