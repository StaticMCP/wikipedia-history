Architecturally, it is a notable example of Stripped Classicism.\nSituation\nThe memorial is situated upon Hill 204 and commands a wide view of the valley of the river Marne. It is located about  east of Paris,  southeast of the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and Memorial, and  southwest of the Oise-Aisne American Cemetery and Memorial.  It commemorates the achievements of United States forces that fought in the region during World War I. In 1918, the 2nd and 3rd United States Infantry Divisions took part in heavy fighting around the area during the Second Battle of the Marne, which took place during the wider German spring offensive. The 4th Marine Brigade, which made a name for itself in the Battle of Belleau Wood, fought as part of the 2nd Infantry Division. The bodies of a number of US servicemen who were killed during the fighting are interred in cemeteries nearby.\nTwo stone pylons mark the entrance to the memorial from Highway N-3 which runs from Paris to Château-Thierry. The monument consists of a double colonnade rising above a long terrace, as designed by Paul Philippe Cret. On its west facade are sculptured figures representing the United States and France.  The sculptor was the French-American artist Alfred Bottiau. The English inscription reads, \"This monument has been erected by the United States of America to commemorate the services of her troops and those of France who fought in this region during the World War.  It stands as a lasting symbol of the friendship and cooperation between the French and American Armies.\" On its east facade is a map showing American military operations that took place in the region and an orientation table pointing out the significant battle sites.\nThe Belleau Wood US Marines monument is located near the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, about 9.3&nbsp;km northwest.\nGallery\nFile:1952 André TOISON et la Maquette Cote 204.jpg|André Toison with a maquette\nFile:30th Infantry Division Monument Front.JPG|Detail of the building\nFile:American Monument Chateau Thierry Battle Map.jpg|Battle map on the front of the monument\nFile:Chateau-Thierry American Monument English Dedication.jpg|Dedication text in English\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n* Then and Now |year=2006 |publisher=Battleground Productions| isbn=978-0-9702443-0-7}}\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.abmc.gov/cemeteries-memorials/europe/chateau-thierry-monument#.VPDXj_nF9RI ABMC Chateau-Thierry American Monument web page]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090506052633/http://abmc.gov/copyright.php ABMC authorization]"
