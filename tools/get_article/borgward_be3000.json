In 1950, Borgward moved the production from Bremen to their other location in Hastedt, a district of Bremen-Hemelingen, and renamed the vehicle to Lloyd EL3000. The total production figure is not known, but about 30 vehicles of this type were built each year. The major customer was the British Army of the Rhine.\nThe truck had a range of 70 km (43 miles) loaded and 100 km (62 miles) unloaded. 7.50×20\" tires were used. The turning radius was 13 m. In addition to the hydraulic brake, a motor shortcut circuit was installed to retard the vehicle electrically. The motor was manufactured by Lloyd Dynamowerke Bremen.\nThe later type EL3000 was an electric mail delivery vehicle, produced from parts of various manufacturers.\nReferences"
