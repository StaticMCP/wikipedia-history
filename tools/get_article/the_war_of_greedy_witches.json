Agrat calls them Witches and explains that they can all manifest magical abilities by focusing on their greed, desires, and regrets. She commands them to enter a tournament called Walpurgis to take turns fighting to the death in an arena for her amusement and offers to grant a wish to the sole survivor, but warns that if they die, their soul will cease to exist.
