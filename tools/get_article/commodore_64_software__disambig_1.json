Info 64, the first magazine produced using desktop publishing tools, was created on and dedicated to the Commodore platform.\nPopular graphics software included KoalaPainter, known for its graphics tablet interface, and Doodle!, a widely used drawing program. Desktop publishing tools like The Print Shop and \"The Newsroom\" enabled users to create signs, banners, and newsletters. Light pens and CAD software were also available.\nMultiplan - [[spreadsheet program developed by Microsoft]]\nWord processors such as PaperClip and Vizawrite were popular, alongside the type-in program SpeedScript, published in ''Compute!'s Gazette. Spreadsheet programs included Multiplan by Microsoft and Calc Result, while Vizastar offered integrated software features. Office suites like Mini Office II and software from Data Becker were also available.\nThe GEOS operating system provided a graphical interface akin to the early Apple Macintosh, with office applications and support for peripherals like printers and light pens. It gained popularity for its affordability and capabilities.\nMusic software included Music Construction Set and MIDI cartridges, with the modern Prophet64 cartridge offering advanced sequencing and synthesis.\nGames\n}}\nGhostbusters by Activision, 1984.]]\nBy 1985, games comprised 60–70% of Commodore 64 software, driven by its advanced sound and graphics hardware.
