From 1927 to 1929, he studied with Heinrich Kaminski, who also taught Carl Orff. In 1938, he obtained a teaching position at the Musikhochschule in Berlin (now the Berlin University of the Arts). One of his most prominent pupils was Isang Yun.\nA devout Catholic, Schwarz-Schilling's music was often inspired by religious and spiritual themes. His tonal language follows in the tradition of Johann Sebastian Bach and is strongly influenced by that of his teacher Heinrich Kaminski. His best known work is the Cantata Die Botschaft (\"The Commission\"), composed between 1979 and 1982, although he also composed a wide range of orchestral, chamber and choral works. His Symphony in C major(1963), Sinfonia diatonica (1957) and Introduction & Fugue for string orchestra (1948) have been recorded for CD.\nHis son is the German politician Christian Schwarz-Schilling.\nReferences"
