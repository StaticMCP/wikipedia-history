He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 2016. He was a specialist in the architecture of medieval Central Europe.\nAcademic education\nCrossley was educated at Downside School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was elected President of the Cambridge Union. He studied law between 1963 and 1965 before switching to History of Art, graduating in 1967.\nCareer\nBefore joining the Courtauld Institute, he was Reader in the History of Art at the Manchester University from 1971 to 1990. He later served as Slade Professor of Fine Art at Cambridge between 2011 and 2012.\nDuring his career, he was Vice President of the British Archaeological Association, Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and Fellow of the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences.\nPhotographs taken by Crossley are held in the Conway Library at the Courtauld Institute, and are currently being digitised.\nScholarship\nMatthew Reeve suggests that \"from its beginning, Paul Crossley's scholarship offered a wholly catholic vision of late medieval art\". Crossley's PhD thesis focused on the architectural patronage of King Casimir III the Great (1320–80), \"research that, to a large extent, introduced the architecture of Poland to British scholarship\".\nZoë Opačić and Achim Timmermann edited two Festschrifts in honour of Crossley: Architecture, Liturgy and Identity: Liber Amicorum Paul Crossley (Studies in Gothic Art 1), and Image, Memory and Devotion: Liber Amicorum Paul Crossley (Studies in Gothic Art 2).\nPersonal life and death\nHe was married to Joany and had two children, Nick and Kate. Crossley died on 11 December 2019 at the age of 74.\nBibliography\n*[https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/192114464 Gothic Architecture in the Reign of Kasimir the Great: Church Architecture in Lesser Poland, 1320-1380], 1985, Kraków, Ministerstwo Kultury i Sztuki Zarza̜d Muzeów i Ochrony Zabytków\n*[https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/552632542 Seventy-Fifth Anniversary of the Courtauld Institute of Art], 2008, Warburg Inst\n*[https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/739976853 Medieval Architecture and Sculpture in the North West], 1978, Whitworth Art Gallery, University of Manchester\n*[https://sbc.digication.com/late_medieval_art_and_architecture_of_europe_and_the_mediterranean/Course_Schedule_and_Syllabus The Man from Inner Space: architecture and meditation in the choir of St. Laurence in Nuremberg.], 1988, University of Manchester Press\n*Revised ed. of Paul Frankl's [https://courtauld.ac.uk/professor-paul-crossley-1945-2019 Gothic Architecture], 2000 Yale\nFestschrifts\n*[https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/876630747 Image, Memory and Devotion: liber amicorum Paul Crossley], 2011, Brepols\n*[https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/758167381 Architecture, Liturgy and Identity: liber amicorum Paul Crossley], 2011, Brepols\nReferences"
