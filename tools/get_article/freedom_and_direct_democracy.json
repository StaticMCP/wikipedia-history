It is led by Tomio Okamura and it holds 19 seats in the Chamber of Deputies. Its political positions can be described as nationalist and neo-fascist,}} espousing right-wing populism, expressing opposition to immigration, and being staunchly Eurosceptic, while in their political program they state their support for direct democracy.\nAt the end of 2022, the party had 10,682 members and was the fastest-growing party in the country in terms of members.\nHistory\nThe party was founded in May 2015 by Tomio Okamura and Radim Fiala when eight Members of Parliament split from the Dawn of Direct Democracy parliamentary group. As the party was newly formed in that parliamentary term, these MPs sat as independents until the 2017 Czech legislative election. Following that election, the party held 22 seats in the Czech Chamber of Deputies.\nFreedom and Direct Democracy is named after the European Parliament Eurosceptic political group Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy. The party has links with Marine Le Pen's National Front, which is a member of the Europe of Nations and Freedom, a separate Eurosceptic political group in the European Parliament, and Marine Le Pen endorsed SPD before the 2017 Czech legislative election.\nIn December 2017, SPD hosted a conference of the Movement for a Europe of Nations and Freedom in Prague, alongside parties such as the French National Front, Dutch Party for Freedom, Freedom Party of Austria, and Lega Nord of Italy.\nIn 2019, following the European Parliament elections, SPD entered the European Parliament with two MEPs, who sit with the Identity and Democracy group.\nIn July 2020, SPD MP Tereza Hyťhová defected to become the third MP for the Tricolour Citizens' Movement.\nDuring the 2021 Czech legislative election, SPD finished fourth with 20 MPs.\nOn 25 February 2022, the party established its own think tank, the Institute of Freedom and Direct Democracy, focused on the \"development of democracy, the rule of law, pluralism of opinions and the protection of fundamental human rights\", with Josef Nerušil as its first Chairman.\nOn 14 September 2022, MEP Hynek Blaško left SPD due to disagreement with Okamura's leadership of the party.\nOn 28 June 2024, Freedom and Direct Democracy announced it would leave the Identity and Democracy group to form a new, Alternative for Germany-led group called \"Europe of Sovereign Nations\", citing disagreements with ANO 2011 on the European Green Deal, immigration, censorship, and Ukraine.\nMladí Espéďáci\nThe party's youth wing, Mladí Espéďáci (; MES) was established in April 2021 via Facebook, with Martin Malášek as the first leader. Diana Chodžajanová, a former contestant in Česko hledá SuperStar, became one of the faces of MES, appearing in short clips to promote the organisation. In July 2022, the MES page was removed from Facebook.\nCultural impact\nA 2017 song by SPD supporters Jan Žižka and Olivie Žižková called Já volím SPD (''I'm voting SPD) went viral in the Czech Republic and became the target of ridicule. This led to Žižková being jokingly voted into the top 30 female singers at the 2017 Český slavík awards.\nPolicies and ideology\nOn its website and policy brief, SPD refers to itself as \"a patriotic and democratic movement\" with a focus on political reform, law and order, direct democracy, entrepreneurship, and national sovereignty. The party also advocates for reducing state surveillance, reforming the Czech tax system, supporting internet freedom, and encouraging more citizen-led participation in national politics.\nPolitical commentators have variously described the party as right-wing populist, nationalist, and anti-immigration in its platform and rhetoric. SPD has described itself as a national conservative party. In April 2023, a court ruled that a description of the party as \"fascist\" by the magazine Respekt was \"in accordance with the requirement of proportionality\", and the magazine did not thus need to apologise for using this description. SPD has been described as neo-fascist by news outlets including Balkan Insight, bne Intellinews, Le Monde diplomatique, and European Interest''.\nThe party opposes Czech membership in the European Union and has been continuously calling for the Czech Republic to withdraw from the European Union. The party strongly opposes illegal immigration and the EU's policy of migrant quotas, and advocates a more restrictive immigration policy, particularly towards immigration from Islamic nations, and rejects multiculturalism. The party says that it does not seek to promote hatred towards any race or culture, but argues for the protection of \"Judeo-Christian\" values and believes that migrant quotas will lead to the \"Islamization\" of Europe. SPD takes a pro-Israel stance on the Gaza war, with Okamura stating that he supports Israel on all major issues. Okamura has repeatedly called for suspending Czech military aid to Ukraine in the Russo-Ukrainian War, alongside believing that the Russian invasion of Ukraine should be addressed through peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, while claiming that the war should be brought to an end, even at the expense of Ukraine. The party has been widely labelled as \"pro-Russian\".\nThe party strongly opposes same-sex couples having the right to hold civil weddings.\nThe party has been criticised for posting \"misleading and manipulative content on social media\", with the Ministry of Interior stating in July 2020 that SPD is the leading publisher of content featuring racial, ethnic, and religious hatred.\nMembership\nTomio Okamura often claims that SPD has a membership of thousands of members. In October 2017, he claimed that SPD has 7,000 members, and in November 2017 12,000 members. Doubt has been cast on these figures, with the suggestion that Okamura often conflates numbers of supporters with actual members. It was reported in 2015 that SPD had only 20 members, compared to Okamura's claims of 10,000. In February 2018, the party claimed to have 1,200 members, while in July of the same year, its membership figure reportedly stood at 1,400 individuals.\nElection results\nChamber of Deputies\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!
