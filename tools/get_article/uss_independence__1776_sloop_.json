Acting as a dispatch boat, she was sent to France on a diplomatic mission – carrying important dispatches. While there, John Paul Jones embarked on her, and she received additional salutes to the American Republic from the French.\nContinental Navy service\nIndependence was a Continental sloop built in Baltimore, Maryland, and purchased and fitted out by the Marine Committee.\nIn September 1776 she cruised under Captain John Young along the Atlantic Ocean coast to the Caribbean Sea to guard American merchant trade in the West Indies.\nIn mid-1777 she sailed for France, arriving at Lorient in late September with important diplomatic dispatches. She captured two prizes en route and disposed of these in France before the Royal Navy could interfere.\nShe was in Quiberon Bay 14 February 1778 when John Paul Jones in Ranger received the first national salute to the flag—the first official recognition of the American Republic by a foreign power. The following morning, Jones embarked in Independence and again exchanged salutes.\nWrecked on the bar\nIndependence soon sailed for the United States. She was wrecked on the bar 24 April 1778 while attempting to enter Ocracoke Inlet, North Carolina.  The wreck was heavily salvaged, including her guns, cargo and ship's bell.\nSee also\n* Continental Navy\n* American Revolution\nReferences\n*"
