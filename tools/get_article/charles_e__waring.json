He increased the number of chemistry faculty from 9 to 22, launched one of the university's first doctoral programs, and advised 24 PhD students and nine MS students.\nBorn in Philadelphia, Waring earned his BS from Muskingum College in 1931 and his MS and PhD from Ohio State University in 1934 and 1936.

He taught for ten years at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn before joining UConn. Waring also served as a technical advisor for the US Defense Department during World War II and thereafter from 1946 to 1966.\nContaining 64 modern laboratories, the research wing of UConn's Chemistry Building was named in Waring's honor in 1998. The Waring Chemistry Building, the former home of the chemistry department, was renamed the Philip E. Austin Building.\nWaring married Geraldine Howald on December 19, 1936. He died at Hartford Hospital after a long illness in 1981.\nReferences"
