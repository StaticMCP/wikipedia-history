An online zine published by Harmonix Music Systems (a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company located about an hour from Providence) refers to Kendall as a \"local legend.\"\nEarly career\nKendall was a member of the Amazing Royal Crowns rockabilly band that began in Providence in 1993.  They won the 1997 WBCN Rock & Roll Rumble in Boston and won four 1998 Kahlua Boston Music Awards (Rising Star, Debut Album of the Year, Video of the Year and Outstanding Club Band). The band toured extensively on their own and with other bands such as the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, The Cramps, Reverend Horton Heat, and were interviewed by Rolling Stone.

Early demos of Guitar Hero II used \"King Kendall\" as the name for the character who eventually became Eddie Knox.
