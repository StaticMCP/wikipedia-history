Spencer Poetry Awards are three awards administered by the West Chester University Poetry Center and are given annually during the West Chester University Poetry Conference \"to recognize the important role of arts and letters in American life.\" The Iris N. Spencer Poetry Awards were named by Kean W. Spencer, who provided the initial endowment, after his mother.\nHistory\nIn 2005, the creation of the Iris N. Spencer Poetry Awards was announced at the WCU Poetry Conference. Kean W. Spencer provided the initial endowment of $250,000. Though not a poet himself, Spencer did win the prestigious Hopwood Award for poetry from the University of Michigan as a young man. The following year, the original two awards—the Donald Justice Poetry Prize and the Iris N. Spencer Undergraduate Poetry Award—were given for the first time.\nLater on, the Myong Cha Son Haiku Award was added and presented for the first time in 2007.\nDonald Justice Poetry Prize\nGiven annually since 2006 to one poet for an unpublished book-length manuscript of poetry, the award includes $1500, publication, and a scholarship to the West Chester University Poetry Conference. The prize is named after poet Donald Justice.\nUndergraduate awards\nThese awards are open to all undergraduates who are enrolled in either a college or university. In 2012, both prizes went national. (Previously, the competition was only open to students in the Delaware Valley of Pennsylvania.)\nIris N. Spencer Undergraduate Poetry Award\nGiven annually since 2006 for an original poem composed in the traditional modes of meter, rhyme and form to one winner and one runner-up, the Iris N. Spencer Undergraduate Poetry Award includes $1500 and $500 respectively as well as an opportunity for publication for both.\nThe first place award was increased to $1500 from $1000 in 2012.\nThe following are the winners of the Iris N.
