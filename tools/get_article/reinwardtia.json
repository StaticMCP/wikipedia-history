She was raised by animals and her first human contact was in the form of a prince who had lost his way during a hunting expedition. She tended after him and of course he fell in love with her. He persuaded her to marry him and accompany him to his palace. Although she loved the prince she started wilting away in the absence of a natural environment. No one could cure her and finally she died pining for her flora and fauna friends. Her last wish was that she should be buried among her friends. The prince took her to be buried at the place he had first met her. Some time later a pretty, yellow flower came out at the spot. This flower was named after the pretty nature-loving belle.\nTaxonomy\nThe following are taxonomic synonyms for Reinwardtia indica:\nR. tetragyna, R. trigyna, Linum trigynum, Linum cicanobum, Linum repens, Kittelocharis trigyna, Macrolium trigynum\nReferences\n* \"Tales and legends from India\" (page 13) by Iris Macfarlane (1966)\n*Legends of the gods: strange and fascinating tales from around the world (page 33) by Noreen Shelley (1976),\nExternal links\n*[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=5&taxon_id=200012412 Reinwardtia trigyna (Roxb.)
