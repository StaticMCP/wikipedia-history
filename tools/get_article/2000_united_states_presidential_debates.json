Only Democratic nominee Al Gore and Republican nominee George W. Bush met the criteria for inclusion in the debates, and thus were the only two to appear in the debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The CPD-sponsored vice presidential debate took place between their respective vice presidential running mates, Joe Lieberman and Dick Cheney.\nDebate schedule\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"white-space:nowrap;\" |&nbsp;|| Date & time || Host || Location|| Moderator || colspan=\"11\" scope=\"col\" | Participants\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\" |Key: Participant &nbsp;   Non-invitee &nbsp;\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em; background: #34AAE0;\" |\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em; background: #FF3333;\" |\n|-\n!Vice PresidentAl Goreof Tennessee\n!GovernorGeorge W.

Bush and Vice President Al Gore met the CPD selection criteria for any of the presidential debates. As a result, only Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman met the criteria for the vice presidential debate.\nBush initially refused to participate in all three CPD debates, instead proposing that he and Gore meet for just one CPD-sponsored debate, and another two debates of one hour each, hosted on Meet the Press and Larry King Live. However, the Bush campaign eventually assented to the three Commission-scheduled debates.\nOctober 3: First presidential debate (University of Massachusetts Boston)\n|venue=University of Massachusetts Boston\n|location=Boston, Massachusetts\n|participants=Al GoreGeorge W.
