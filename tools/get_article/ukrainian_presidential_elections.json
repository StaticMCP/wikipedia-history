The next election would have been scheduled for 2024; however, it was not held because of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine ongoing since 24 February 2022 and the resulting imposition of martial law in Ukraine, under which elections legally cannot be held.\nProcedure\nThe presidential election rules are defined by the Constitution of Ukraine and the Electoral Code of Ukraine.\nEligibility requirements\nA candidate for the President's office must:\n* be a citizen of Ukraine;\n* be at least 35 years of age on the election day;\n* have the right to vote;\n* speak the official language (Ukrainian);\n* have lived in Ukraine for the last ten years prior to election day.\nThe same person cannot be elected President more than twice in a row.\nNomination process\nA candidate can be nominated by a political party or be self-nominated.\nCampaigning\nA presidential candidate may start his or her election campaign the next day after he or she is registered by the Central Election Commission.\nThe presidential election campaign ends at 24:00 of the last Friday before the election day.\nPopular vote\nRegular presidential elections are held on the last Sunday of March (formerly in October) of the fifth and last year of the incumbent President's term of office. If a president's term in office ends prematurely, the election of a new president must take place within ninety days of the president's office falling vacant.\nThe president is elected by direct popular vote in a two-round majoritarian contest. If no candidate receives a simple majority (over 50%) of votes in the first round, the two candidates with the most votes advance to a run-off, which is called for the third Sunday after the first round; the candidate who receives more votes in the run-off is then elected president.\nIf one of the two remaining candidates drops out at least 12 days before the run-off, the next-best candidate from the first round will advance into the second round instead. If there is only one candidate left in the second round (e.g. if a candidate withdraws less than 12 days before the second round, or if there are no other candidates who can replace a candidate who has withdrawn), the remaining candidate must win over 50% of the second-round vote to be elected president, or the election will be declared void.\nVoters must be Ukrainian citizens and at least 18 years old on the election day.\nThere are no requirements for a minimum voter turnout.\nUntil the 2010 election, Ukrainian voters had the option to vote \"against all candidates\"; however, this option was removed in 2011 after changes to electoral legislation.\nResults\nWhere available, this table shows percentages as reported by the Central Election Commission of Ukraine; these may differ from percentages calculated based on the valid vote only.\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+References for results can be found in the \"year\" column\n!\n! colspan=\"3\" |First round\n! colspan=\"2\" |Second round\n!\n|-\n!Year\n!Winner\n!Runner-up\n!style=max-width:5.5em | No. of other candidates\n!Winner\n!Runner-up\n!Notes\n|-\n|}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Kravchuk won absolute majority in first round; no second round needed\n|-\n|}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|, the only successful re-election bid by an incumbent President of Ukraine\n|-\n|}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|After election fraud leading to Orange Revolution, second round invalidated by Supreme Court of Ukraine and re-run; table shows re-run results\n|-\n|}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Incumbent President Viktor Yushchenko eliminated in first round with 5% of vote\n|-\n|}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Election originally scheduled for 2015, but brought forward after Revolution of Dignity; Poroshenko succeeded acting President Oleksandr Turchynov.Poroshenko won absolute majority in first round; no second round needed\n|-\n|}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Largest-ever margin\n|}\nVoter turnout\nThe highest voter turnout–84 percent–was recorded during the first election in December 1991.\nSee also\n* Elections in Ukraine\nReferences"
