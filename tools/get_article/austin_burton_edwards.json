They had four children.\nCaulfield Grammar School\nHe was educated at Caulfield Grammar School from 1916 to 1927—representing the school in both swimming and athletics over a number of years—where he was both School Captain and Dux of School in 1926.\nHe was a member of the Caulfield Grammar School Council for 12 years, from 1949 until his death in 1960.\nSportsman\nFootball\nOn 17 April 1931 he was awarded a \"half-blue\" for football by the University of Melbourne.\nIn June 1931, while playing with Old Caulfield Grammarians in C-Section of the Metropolitan Amateur Football Association, he was chosen (as a back-pocket resting ruckman), to play for a Combined C-Section team, against a Combined B-Section team as a curtain raiser to the inter-State amateur football match between Victoria and South Australia, on the MCG. He was one of the best on the ground.\nAthletics\nWhile studying at the Royal College of Science he was awarded \"colours\" in athletics.\nTertiary education\nMelbourne University\nHe studied at the University of Melbourne, graduating Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) with First-Class Honours in Geology on 12 April 1930.\nIn 1942, with 12 years having elapsed since his graduation as B.Sc., he was awarded a Doctor of Science (D.Sc.), on the basis of his submission of \"42 published papers, covering work in petrology, economic geology and physiography\". He graduated on 21 December 1942.\nRoyal College of Science\nHaving won a 1851 Royal Exhibition Scholarship for Science Research and free passage to England in 1932, he studied at the Royal College of Science at Imperial College London, and graduated Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) and Diploma of Imperial College (D.I.C.) in 1934.\nC.S.I.R.O.\nSoon after his return to Australia, he was appointed Research Officer in the mineragraphic section of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (C.S.I.R.) in 1935. In the process, he became the associate of Frank L. Stillwell (1888-1963); and on Stllwell's retirement in 1953, Edwards became officer-in-charge of the mineragraphic section of what had become the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (C.S.I.R.O.).\nFrom 1941 to 1955 Edwards, while still at C.S.I.R., lectured part-time in geology at the University of Melbourne, occasionally offering postgraduate lectures.\nDeath\nHe collapsed and died in Rome on 8 October 1960 while on a working visit to Europe. He is buried in Rome's Cimitero Acattolico Non-Catholic Cemetery tomb 878.\nWorks\nFor details of his more than 100 journal articles, see Stillwell (1961), pp.&nbsp;492–496.\n* [https://archive.org/details/proceedingsroyaxlivroya Edwards, A.B.
