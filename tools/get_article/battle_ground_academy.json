BGA is located in Franklin, Tennessee, US. Founded in 1889, the school was originally located in part on the site of the Battle of Franklin in the American Civil War. BGA has two campuses and a separate location for its pre-K program. The Harpeth Campus is located on Franklin Road in the historic Cox House and is home to grades K-4. The Glen Echo campus is centered on historic plantation house Glen Echo and is located off Mack Hatcher Parkway and is home to grades 5 to 12. The Early Learning Center, BGA's pre-K program, is located at [https://fpcfranklin.org/ First Presbyterian Church] of Franklin, Tennessee.\nHistory\n, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, currently serves as the Battle Ground Academy Lower School.]]\nBattle Ground Academy was established in 1889, and it was named for its original location during the Civil War Battle of Franklin.\nThe first campus was erected at the corner of Columbia Avenue and Cleburne Street. S. V. Wall and W. D. Mooney were chosen as the first to lead the new academy. In 1902, the original school building burned at which time the school was relocated to Columbia Avenue in Franklin.\nBGA was established to educate boys originally and girls began to attend some time later. The school operated as a day school though students came from outside the local area to attend. They boarded in private homes until the first dormitory was built in 1922. At this time, BGA evolved to become a boarding and day school.\nAfter the construction of the first dormitory, the decision was made to change to an all-male student body. The departure of the last girl students in 1929 ushered in a half-century when BGA was a boys' school.\nIn the early 1970s, the boarding program was phased out. BGA once again welcomed girls to its student body.  At present, the female enrollment accounts for approximately 50 percent of the student body.\nIn 1996, the location of the Battle Ground Academy Upper School changed to the current site on Ernest Rice Lane (off of  Mack Hatcher Parkway). In 2003, the Middle School joined the Upper School on the Glen Echo campus. Additionally, in 1998, Battle Ground Academy acquired the former Harpeth Academy. This became the BGA Lower School on Franklin Road. In 2024, BGA began its pre-K program, the Early Learning Center. Currently, the school operates at three physical campuses and has four divisions: the Early Learning Center, Lower School, Middle School, and Upper School.\nStudent Honors\nThe BGA Artist Guild was established in 1987. As the Guild grew in size and prestige, the group began to have public performances. Guild Night has become a tradition for parents and students each year.. Board of Trust Merit Scholarships are provided to some of BGA's most promising incoming freshmen. This scholarship program was established in 2005 to recognize outstanding academic performance.\nDigamma is an in-school honor society. Members are BGA students who are sophomores, juniors or seniors having a cumulative academic GPA of 3.1.\nNotable alumni\n*C. J.
