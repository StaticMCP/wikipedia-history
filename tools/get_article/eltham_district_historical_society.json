It was incorporated in 1988. Following the restructure of local government in Victoria in 1994, the Society changed its name to Eltham District Historical Society. Members have included the photographer Peter Bassett-Smith.\nLocal History Centre\nThe Society occupies the former historic Policeman's residence in the Eltham Justice Precinct. at 728 Main Road, Eltham. It was constructed in 1859–60 in brick as a single-story residence consisting of five rooms. It has a projecting front room and timber verandah. It discontinued being a police residence in 1952 when the Shire of Eltham lands department used it as a local office. After that it was used by Council's parks and environment department. The building is registered on the Victorian Heritage Register.  The detached weatherboard building situated beside the Local History Centre is a 1980s replica of the original police station which was located in the same position but later demolished.
