They are used by the Old Republic, the Galactic Empire, and the First Order for ground assault, reconnaissance or transport. Throughout the saga walkers have played a pivotal role in the fate of characters and the outcome of battles. Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) is responsible for their animation and design, often using models, stop-motion animation, and relevant matte paintings to depict their presence in the films.\nThere are a variety of walkers: The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi introduced the All Terrain Armored Transport (AT-AT) and All Terrain Scout Transport (AT-ST).  Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones, Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith and The Clone Wars introduced earlier Clone Wars-era models of walkers, such as the All-Terrain Tactical Enforcer (AT-TE), and the All Terrain Recon Transports (AT-RT). The Star Wars Legends continuity features numerous walker variants, several which have been merchandised in popular culture, while the later films Rogue One and Star Wars: The Last Jedi depicted, respectively, the former the AT-ACT variant to the standard AT-AT, the latter a restyled AT-AT for its new and more modern setting, and a new, even larger walker known as the AT-M6.\nAll Terrain Armored Transport (AT-AT)\n-->\n| affiliation       = Galactic Empire\n| maker             = Kuat Drive Yards\n| launched          =\n| decommissioned    =\n| captain           =\n| fighters          =\n| aux_vehicle       =\n| class             = Walker\n| registry          =\n| armaments         =\n| defense           =\n| max_speed         =\n| propulsion        =\n| chassis           =\n| power             =\n| mass              =\n| length            =\n| width             =\n| height            =\n*\n}}\n| population_volume =\n}}\nThe All Terrain Armored Transport () is a quadruped mechanized infantry combat vehicle used by Imperial ground forces.\nThe AT-AT (pronounced either casually as 'at at', or using only the letters ) was first introduced in The Empire Strikes Back'' (as the Galactic Empire's main units against Rebel Alliance infantry during the Battle of Hoth) and also appears in Return of the Jedi and in Rogue One (in the AT-ACT variant).\nThe  also appears in a destroyed form in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, explained in the video game Star Wars Battlefront (2015) to be a residue of the Battle of Jakku, which was the Empire's last defeat and resulted in its dissolution, where Rey uses its husk for shelter. Updated forms appear in The Last Jedi (used by the First Order to attack Resistance forces in a former Rebel base).\nThe theme park attraction Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance, set after The Last Jedi, features two full-sized AT-ATs in a hangar bay. These walkers, while mostly static, can move their cannons to allow for a scene in which the walker's drivers spot the ride vehicles and fire at them.\nOrigin and design\nJoe Johnston's original design for the Empire's war machines was a giant, multi-wheeled vehicle; this design later became the \"Juggernaut\" in West End Games' roleplaying material, and the design was reworked into the clone turbo tank for Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith. Johnston said Lucas wanted the walkers to look like anthropomorphic walking tanks to make them frightening.\nFor The Empire Strikes Back, however, the final design was a four-legged walker. Inspiration for the  came from Paraceratherium, an extinct genus most closely related to living rhinoceroses, and one of the largest known land mammals. George Lucas later dismissed claims that the  design was inspired by container cranes at the Port of Oakland (across San Francisco Bay from ILM's San Rafael offices), calling it a \"myth\"; animator Phil Tippett told the San Francisco Chronicle the same thing.\nILM created models ranging from  in height. ILM filmed the  using stop-motion animation against matte paintings created by Michael Pangrazio because attempts at compositing miniature footage against live-action background footage yielded mediocre results. Additionally, ILM studied elephants to determine the best way to animate the four-legged . Although the stop-motion animation style gave the  a jerky, \"staccato-like\" effect on film, ILM found this movement acceptable because of the  mechanical nature.\nThe sound of the AT-AT walking was created by sound designer Ben Burtt using a punch press.\nDepiction\nThe All Terrain Armored Transport is an assault walker used by Imperial ground forces to blast through enemy lines with its sheer mass and firepower and deploy a platoon of crack assault troops.  The thick armor plating on the AT-AT will deflect or absorb anything but the heaviest turbolaser weaponry. Standing over  tall, the  is as much a weapon of terror as anything else, and its mere presence is often enough to intimidate the local populace into obedience. Its prodigious height also helps the walker see over obstacles and provides a clear line of sight for its weaponry, carried in its heavily armored head. A pair of Class II heavy laser cannons mounted in the head's \"chin\" can be fired in quick succession or simultaneously for a single, power blast, and can engage targets from many kilometers away; on either side of the \"temples\" are mounted medium repeating blasters and targeting rangefinders. When it comes time to deploy, troops carried in the  exit out of the sides via harness-and-cable from extendable boom racks while speeder bikes exit out the front and back using harnesses.\nThe walker's crew consists of two  pilots and a vehicle commander; while both pilots are fully qualified, one usually serves as the driver and the other as gunner.  pilots receive specialized training in order to operate their walkers, using terrain sensors in the head and footpads to find sure footing, and as such warrant extra layers of protection and long-lasting power packs in their life-support suits.\nAlthough imposing, these weapons of terror have a number of design flaws. While AT-ATs can navigate most rugged ground, certain features such as steep hillsides or swamps can impede them. A high center of gravity and unstable legs also make them susceptible to tripping. Their size makes them conspicuous targets, especially on open terrain; while largely impervious to attack, their neck and underbelly are vulnerable to blasters and missiles.\nIn the Battle of Hoth, General Veers leads a group of  and AT-STs dubbed Blizzard Force in the attack on the Rebels' Echo Base, as only slow-moving ground vehicles can penetrate the base's shield system. During the battle, the AT-AT designated Blizzard Two is destroyed when Wedge Antilles and Wes Janson use their snowspeeder's tow cable to trip it up and target its now-exposed neck with blaster fire to blow it up. Luke Skywalker destroys another AT-AT, Blizzard Four, by using a magnetic grapple to reach its underbelly, cut open a hole with his lightsaber and throw in a grenade.  Ultimately the Empire is victorious as General Veers' Blizzard One destroys the shield generator, and in the ensuing rout he orders the remaining AT-ATs and AT-STs to overrun the Rebels' trenches and capture as many as possible.\nA ruined  appears in Star Wars: The Force Awakens as the makeshift home of the scavenger Rey on the planet Jakku. Using scavenged parts from the walker and other vehicles, Rey is able to construct a power system for her home along with booby traps and motion sensors to deter potential thieves. Information in the AT-AT's manifest reveal it was designated Hellhound Two, part of the complement of the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Interrogator, but the ultimate fate of its crew is unknown.\nThe First Order uses an updated model of the AT-AT during the Battle of Crait at the end of Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Built by Kuat-Entralla Drive Yards, these versions of the venerable AT-AT address some of the stability issues that plagued the Imperial walkers. They also use lighter armor material to add additional layers of protection and address weak points without increasing weight.\nAnalysis\nIn 2011, a fan-led effort to get a life-sized, fully functional AT-AT built was stopped by Lucasfilm as violating their intellectual property.  Commenting on the effort, Heiko Hoffman, a robotics expert at HRL Laboratories, argued that building an AT-AT would easily cost US$100 million or more.  He also argued that building such a vehicle would poses challenges since structural strength does not increase the same way as mass and there would be tremendous stress on the legs and joints, though he noted the AT-AT's method of walking was \"statically stable\" and appropriate for a heavy vehicle.  A later estimate conducted in 2016 argued that building a real-life AT-AT would cost US$228.5 million.  Using the M1 Abrams as a starting point, such a vehicle would weigh over 1,000 tons and generate 19 megawatts of power.\nDr. Malcolm Davis, director of the Defense & Strategy Program at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, argues that the AT-AT has several flaws which make it an ineffective design.  Compared to tracked vehicles, Davis states that while walking vehicles like the AT-AT can potentially step over obstacles, they cannot run as fast, and destroying a leg would topple one over.  The AT-AT also has a limited field of fire with all its weapons mounted in the head and its slab sides would be more vulnerable to shaped charge munitions as opposed to angled sides.  He notes however that its height would give its line-of-sight weaponry a greater reach and puts its occupants well above any IED explosion.\nJoe Pappalardo of Popular Mechanics also argues that the AT-AT is a poorly-designed troop transport, being slow, top-heavy and conspicuous with its legs being a particular vulnerability.  He contends that the Empire would have won the Battle of Hoth faster and more easily if they had deployed smaller conventional vehicles.\nAll Terrain Scout Transport (AT-ST)\n-->\n| affiliation       = Galactic Empire\n| maker             = Kuat Drive Yards\n| launched          =\n| decommissioned    =\n| captain           =\n| fighters          =\n| aux_vehicle       =\n| class             = Walker\n| registry          =\n| armaments         =\n| defense           =\n| max_speed         =\n| propulsion        =\n| chassis           =\n| power             = High-density power cells\n| mass              =\n| length            =\n| width             =\n| height            =\n*\n*\n}}\n| population_volume =\n}}\nThe All Terrain Scout Transport (AT-ST) is a two-legged mech walker introduced briefly in the Battle of Hoth in The Empire Strikes Back and featured extensively in the Battle of Endor in Return of the Jedi. These vehicles were designed to screen and protect the flanks of slower moving AT-ATs and the larger tanks used by the Empire.  Due to their design and movement, they are often dubbed as a \"chicken walker\".  The name Scout Walker is also used to refer to an .  This name was used for the official toy instead of the  name.\nAn AT-ST also appears briefly in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, patrolling Jedha City following an attack by Saw Gerrera's forces. A modified AT-ST later appears in The Mandalorian under the possession of a group of raiders, as the Empire has ceased to exist by the time of the series. An updated model of the AT-ST is used by the First Order in The Last Jedi. Shortly before the film's climax, an AT-ST is commandeered by BB-8.\nVideo games such as Star Wars: Rogue Squadron and Shadows of the Empire (in a much expanded Battle of Hoth) include numerous , and these can be destroyed by direct shooting from the player's craft, in contrast to the heavily armored  which have to be tripped by tow cables.  are also player-controllable units in several real-time strategy games.\nOrigin and design\nA single AT-ST makes a brief appearance in The Empire Strikes Back alongside the larger  during the Battle of Hoth. The  was meant to have more screen time; however, one scene depicting a snowspeeder shooting at the  model was ruined when the set's background shifted.\nFor Return of the Jedi, ILM made the  design more detailed. Numerous models were created, including a full-sized  for on-location shooting. Director Richard Marquand and producer Robert Watts had cameos as  operators for the scene in which Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and a pair of Ewoks commandeer an AT-ST.\nLee Seiler sued Lucasfilm in the mid-1980s, claiming that the  infringed on his copyright on what he called a \"Garthian Strider\", which he said he created in 1976 or 1977. The case was dismissed with the court noting that not only did Seiler not produce the supposed drawings at trial, but that the copyright came one year after The Empire Strikes Back debuted.\nDepiction\nAccording to Star Wars sources, the in-universe development of the  can be traced back to earlier walker models like the  and .  Constructed as a companion to the larger AT-AT, the scout walker's lightweight bipedal design allows it to travel across rugged ground and fulfill a variety of missions, including patrolling, reconnaissance and mop-up operations.  During major ground combat,  protect the flanks of  and hunt down any infantry or smaller threats which evade the assault walkers. A powerful gyro stabilizer, sophisticated shock absorbers, and terrain-measuring sensors in the footpads allow the scout walker to move faster and traverse areas which would be impassible to an . Standard weaponry includes a chin-mounted twin medium blaster cannon, with a twin light blaster cannon and a concussion grenade launcher on either side of the head. AT-STs may carry different side-mounted weapons, such as a light blaster cannon and/or concussion missile launcher.\nare crewed by two pilots, one who controls the weaponry while the other drives the walker.  Their uniforms include fire-resistant boots, jumpsuits over basic armor plating, and crew helmets with attached telemetry receiver units. The two operate the scout walker looking out of the forward viewports or by relying on viewscreens and holoprojectors which help them see the area all around the walker.  While the  computer can pilot it easily enough over level ground,  pilots must use their dexterity and superior sense of balance to help it navigate more difficult terrain.\nIn order to achieve its speed and size, the  is forced to sacrifice offensive and defensive capability. Its chin-mounted blasters are only effective out to , while the side-mounted weaponry has less range. Lightweight armor plating is proof against blasters and other small arms, but cannot withstand heavier laser cannons and missiles. The  must rely on high-intensity power cells as it is too small to carry a full power generator, limiting its range.\nIn The Empire Strikes Back,  scout for and provide support for the slower  during the Battle of Hoth; when the shield generator is destroyed, they race ahead of the assault walkers to capture as many of the fleeing Rebels as possible. During the ground skirmish of the Battle of Endor in Return of the Jedi, after initially inflicting heavy casualties on the Rebels and Ewoks, several  are destroyed when they prove highly vulnerable to the Ewoks' primitive booby traps, with one crushed between two large tree trunks swung on ropes. Another is hijacked thanks to Chewbacca climbing aboard and using his strength to rip open its roof hatch; he proceeds to turn its weapons against the other  to help win the battle.\nAn updated model of the AT-ST is used by the First Order during the Battle of Crait in The Last Jedi. Based on the classic Imperial scout walker, this version boasts improved stability and greater protection thanks to new lightweight armor plating.\nAnalysis\nIn episode 208 of MythBusters, the Build Team (Grant Imahara, Kari Byron and Tory Belleci) tested the plausibility of the scene in Return of the Jedi wherein a swinging log trap destroyed an AT-ST.  The team determined that the logs in the scene each weighed approximately  and were swung at a 45 degree angle at the walker, impacting with the energy equivalent of around two megajoules. To test this in real life, the team created a swinging log rig out of telephone poles and, after shoring the structure up with steel reinforcement, swung replica logs at an armored truck. The team declared the myth plausible when the logs succeeded in punching the truck's side panels off its frame.\nAll Terrain Tactical Enforcer (AT-TE)\n-->\n| affiliation       = Galactic Republic\n| launched          =\n| decommissioned    =\n| captain           =\n| fighters          =\n| aux_vehicle       = (2x) AT-RTs or speeders\n| class             = Walker\n| registry          =\n| armaments         =\n| defense           =\n| max_speed         =\n| propulsion        =\n| chassis           =\n| power             =\n| mass              =\n| length            =  (hull only)\n| width             =\n| height            =  (hull and legs)\n| population_volume =\n}}\nThe All Terrain Tactical Enforcer, or  walker, is a mechanized infantry combat vehicle used by the Grand Army of the Republic ground forces. Having six grappling legs and a low centre of gravity, this armored walker could navigate any terrain – even climbing vertical cliffs. It appears in Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith, The Clone Wars multimedia campaign, Star Wars Battlefront II and in the early episodes from the second season of Star Wars Rebels.\nOrigin and design\nConceived by Ryan Church as a predecessor to the , the  animation for Attack of the Clones was supervised by Rob Coleman. Tom St. Amand, who worked on the  scenes in The Empire Strikes Back, provided his experience to create a similar appearance for the .\nDepiction\nfirst appeared in Attack of the Clones during the Battle of Geonosis, where they serve as both assault vehicles and infantry transports for the Grand Army of the Republic.  Their in-universe manufacturer is Rothana Heavy Engineering, a subsidiary of Kuat Drive Yards and long-time enemy to the Trade Federation and Techno Union. A total of 2,160  were deployed in the battle, airlifted across the battlefield by special LAAT/c carriers to engage Separatist forces.\nThe walker's unique six-legged design and flexible midsection gives it excellent stability and allows it to traverse otherwise impassible terrain.  Its footpads contain terrain sensors and tractor-field generators which enhance its purchase on rough ground.  They can also be magnetized, allowing the  to even hang upside-down on metal surfaces.\nA turret-mounted mass driver cannon atop the  has a low rate of fire but can be used to bombard fixed emplacements or shoot down slow-moving aircraft.  Six turret-mounted laser cannons, four on the front of the hull and two in the rear, defend it against enemy infantry.  The 's conductive armor spreads heat to minimize penetration from enemy fire, and is well-shielded against electromagnetic pulse and ion cannon weapons.\nThe  carries two squads of clone troopers into battle, with seating split between the front and rear sections of the walker.  These are connected by a flexible \"concertina\" section which also houses the walker's power generators. Inertial compensators beneath this seating helps to keep troopers secure, with seat restraints in case of compensator failure.\nIn the Star Wars Rebels episode \"Relics of the Old Republic\", a heavily customized  is used by clone troopers Rex, Wolffe and Gregor as a mobile residence on the planet Seelos.  Modifications made to the walker include renovating the interior to make room for bunk beds and a kitchen, and replacing the main cannon with rod and reel for catching the planet's wildlife.  During a confrontation with a group of Imperial AT-ATs, the clones'  is destroyed, but thanks to the crew of the Ghost the Imperials are defeated and a captured  is used to replace it.\nAnalysis\nB.K. Lok of That Hashtag Show argues that the  is the best-designed walker in the Star Wars universe.  Specifically in comparison to the , they argue it's harder to hit, is more stable, and possess greater all-around weapons coverage.  Daniel Dimanna of Screen Rant, however, argues that the  is the superior walker.  While acknowledging the  better stability and maneuverability, he cites the  more powerful weaponry, impenetrable armoring, and greater carrying capacity as making it the definitive Star Wars walker.  Blake Hawkins of CBR refers to the  as \"slow, awkward and kind of ridiculous\" but states that Episode 10 of The Bad Batch helped redeemed it by showcasing its ability to navigate over difficult obstacles and its ability to intimidate the local populace. The AT-TE was similar to the All Terrain Open Top Transport (AT-OT), which was used for troop transport and lightly armed, while the AT-TE was more heavily armed and had less space for troops inside.\nAll Terrain MegaCaliber Six (AT-M6)\n-->\n| affiliation       = First Order\n| launched          =\n| decommissioned    =\n| captain           =\n| fighters          =\n| aux_vehicle       =\n| class             = Walker\n| registry          =\n| armaments         =\n| defense           =\n| max_speed         =\n| propulsion        =\n| chassis           =\n| power             =\n| mass              =\n| length            =\n| width             =\n| height            =\n| population_volume =\n}}\nThe All Terrain MegaCaliber Six, or  walker, is a mobile siege engine utilized by the First Order in their attempt to reconquer the galaxy.  Built around a massive turbolaser cannon carried on its back, this simian-shaped walker combines equal parts devastating firepower and psychological warfare.  These walkers made their theatrical appearance in The Last Jedi as the First Order attempted to wipe out the Resistance in the Battle of Crait, and have appeared in other multimedia related to the sequel trilogy.\nAs part of a promotional tie-in for the release of The Last Jedi, Nissan unveiled a concept car based on the  called the Nissan Titan.  Weighing about 6,500 pounds and using primarily molded aluminum parts, the Titan was built in partnership with Vehicle Effects, which also built cars for the Fast & Furious and Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) franchises.  It was the most labor-intensive of several Star Wars-themed cars debuted in the run-up to the movie's release.\nOrigin and design\nIn making a new walker vehicle based on the  for the First Order, the creative team behind The Last Jedi wanted to address the tow-cable vulnerability which had been highlighted in The Empire Strikes Back. Kevin Jenkins, the movie's design supervisor, suggested to Rian Johnson that it be based on a gorilla instead of a dog so they could not be tripped up.  Photos of real-life gorillas were used as a starting point for the final design and helped to give the  a distinctive and aggressive posture.\nDepiction\nAccording to background material, the  is considered the First Order's most powerful combat walker. Unlike the preceding  which functioned as an assault transport, the  is primarily a platform for a MegaCaliber Six turbolaser carried on its back. Capable of penetrating deflector shields rated to withstand planetary bombardments, the weapon requires a dedicated power plant and several auxiliary fuel cells to reduce recharge time. The  heavily armored front legs were modified to handle the weight and massive recoil of firing the weapon, and feature ventilation gates which double as cable-cutters. This locomotion system also gives the walker the appearance of a giant simian predator which, combined with firepower to rival a battleship, is meant to help intimidate an opponent into submission.\nWith the Resistance entrenched on Crait at a former Rebellion base, a contingent of  are among the First Order forces deployed to the planet's surface to engage them, providing escort for a massive superlaser siege cannon. Despite the Resistance's best efforts, the walkers are able to hold them off and the cannon punches a hole through their defenses. However, the arrival of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker distracts the First Order and allows the Resistance to successfully escape.\nAnalysis\nIn comparing the  to its predecessor, Dr. Malcolm Davis notes that, while the specific vulnerability to tow-cable attacks was addressed, many of the same criticisms applied to the  still hold true for the First Order's walker.  A more realistic design he argues would look similarly to the massive tanks which feature in the Bolo universe.  Joe Pappalardo likewise believes that the  is even worse than the  because it has all of the same problems but increased in scale.  He argues it was a lost opportunity to not give the walker the same agility as its simian inspiration and allow it to use its massive arms to walk, climb and swing more easily over obstacles.\nList of other Star Wars walkers\nMany vehicles were created for various Star Wars media and depicted as technological evolutionary predecessors and successors to the walkers featured in the original trilogy.\nIn film and television\n;Utilized by the Republic, Empire and First Order\n*All Terrain Attack Pod (AT-AP): Featured in Revenge of the Sith and Clone Wars media, as a variation of the AT-PT. Alex Jaeger designed the AT-AP per Lucas' request to \"diversify the Clone armor\". Nicknamed the \"sniper tank\", the AT-AP features a variety of artillery weapons, a retractable third leg for stability, and other offensive features.\n*All Terrain Open Transport (AT-OT): Introduced in Revenge of the Sith and other sources, is a heavily armored transport whose open design makes it vulnerable from above. The AT-OT can transport 34 clone troopers, who are protected by thick armor and four laser cannons. During the late stages of Revenge of the Siths development, it was called the \"Clone CAT walker\".\n*All Terrain Recon Transports (AT-RT): Introduced in Revenge of the Sith operated by clone troopers searching for Yoda (Frank Oz) on Kashyyyk. The AT-RT is described as a precursor to the AT-ST, though it also shares similarities to the AT-PTs of the same era. A scene cut from Revenge of the Sith would have shown Yoda distracting clone troopers while Chewbacca removes them from their AT-RT in a manner similar to how he obtains control of an AT-ST in Return of the Jedi. AT-RT animators studied AT-ST movement to recreate part of the \"original funkiness of movement\" caused by the stop-animation style used in the original trilogy.\n*All Terrain Defense Pod (AT-DP): Introduced in Star Wars Rebels, the AT-DP is described by Star Wars references as a successor to the AT-RT, combining speed with an armored cockpit to protect a pilot and gunner.  Standing  high and weighing , the AT-DP can reach speeds of .  Because it is only armed with a single Kyuzo Maad-38 heavy laser cannon, the Empire primarily uses AT-DPs for defensive purposes like policing or sentry duty.\n*All Terrain Mobile Artillery (AT-MA): Introduced in The Force Awakens, the AT-MA is a model of quadruped base defense walker used by the First Order to defend Starkiller Base. While it resembled the All Terrain Armored Transport once used by the Galactic Empire in terms of size and weaponry, the AT-MA was primarily designed for defense, rather than transport or assault. Several of these walkers were deployed across the planet to protect its installations, and at least three of them were present during General Armitage Hux's speech before the destruction of the Hosnian system. Several AT-MAs were portrayed in the ground vehicles storage area of a Resurgent-class Star Destroyer.\n*All Terrain Armored Cargo Transport (AT-ACT): Introduced in Rogue One, these walkers are slightly larger than the standard AT-AT, with a hollowed-out center section that can hold a cargo container. Director Gareth Edwards instructed the film's concept artists to design walkers based on their idealized memory of the AT-AT. According to background material, the AT-ACT was built for hauling cargo at Imperial construction sites and research facilities.  Larger than AT-ATs at  tall, an AT-ACT's central container can hold  of cargo.  Although not meant for use on the battlefield, the AT-ACT is heavily armored against most handheld weapons and equipped with two Taim & Bak MS-2 heavy laser cannons, allowing it to be deployed into combat in an emergency.\n*All Terrain Heavy Hauler (AT-HH): Featured in The Last Jedi, the AT-HH is described in Star Wars sources as a tug walker, a vehicle designed to pull heavy loads on the battlefield.  The walker measures  in length,  in width and  in height, and has a crew of two pilots, one commander, two engineers and four gunners.  With thirty-one legs in total split between three rows, the AT-HH can lose twelve of its legs and still fulfill its mission, using tow cables (each a bundle of 27,572 steelton wires) to drag objects into position.  In addition to heavy armor plating, each AT-HH is defended by medium fire-linked dual laser cannons, one per corner.\n* All Terrain Heavy Scout (AT-HS): A model of walker fielded by the First Order. The LEGO version of the AT-HS was based on a piece of concept art for The Last Jedi which, although canon, was ultimately not used in the final cut of the film.\n* All Terrain Cold-weather Mobile Heavy Cannon (AT-CMHC): A remodeled variant of the Umbaran UMHC used by the Imperial Military. This prototype model was specialized in sub-zero temperatures.\n;Utilized by other factions\n* Skara Nal Keeper: An ancient droid walker and superweapon created by the Ancients long before the founding of the Jedi Order, this walker was buried on the planet of Skara Nal, with a crystal known as the Heart of the Mountain keeping it dormant. The walker was massive and was propelled by four legs, and was armed with a head-mounted superlaser that was capable of significant amounts of destruction. It was the subject of a pirate legend that the Bad Batch investigated with treasure hunter Phee Genoa, who activated it by removing the Heart. The walker was destroyed when the crystal was returned to prevent the destruction of the Bad Batch's shuttle Marauder.\n* Umbaran mobile heavy cannon (UMHC): Used by Umbarans during the Clone Wars. Later, both the Imperial Army and Alliance to Restore the Republic used them during the Galactic Civil War. MHCs were heavily armored and had an articulated electromagnetic plasma cannon mounted on top of its dome-like body.\nIn Expanded Universe media\n*All Terrain Personnel Transport (AT-PT): Introduced during the climax of Timothy Zahn's novel Dark Force Rising, is a two-legged, one-person vehicle designed for the Old Republic as a one-man squad. These were designed to only fit one pilot, who gets in through a small side door. In an emergency, an extra person can be squeezed into the claustrophobic cockpit. This walker also had the interesting feature of having legs that can \"crouch\" when needed.The AT-PT is equipped with two blaster cannons, a concussion grenade launcher, and an array of sensors.The Empire would later end up finding and stealing these designs as the inspiration to the AT-AT and the AT-ST. The AT-PT is also featured in several video games, including Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, Star Wars: Force Commander, and Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds.\n*Mountain Terrain Armored Transport (MT-AT): Introduced in Jedi Academy Trilogy, dubbed \"spider walkers\", are octrupedalism specially for mountain terrain. These specific walkers can walk almost vertically, and are delivered through pods launched from larger ships\n*All Terrain Anti-Aircraft (AT-AA): Featured in various Expanded Universe media, is a four-legged anti-aircraft vehicle used by the Galactic Empire.\nThe All Terrain Advance Raider (AT-AR) appears in Marvel Comics' Star Wars series, and an All Terrain Experimental Transport (AT-XT) appears in LucasArts' Star Wars: The Clone Wars game. DK Publishing's Attack of the Clones: Incredible Cross-Sections book mentions an All Terrain Heavy Enforcer (AT-HE).\nMerchandise\nKenner released AT-AT and AT-ST toys as part of their Empire Strikes Back line, and Hasbro released toys based on those molds when the Special Edition trilogy was distributed.
