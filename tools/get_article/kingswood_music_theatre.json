Kingswood was open from May to September. The facility opened in 1983. The last concert was in 2019 and was removed from the grounds in the fall of 2021.\nKingswood was an open-air theater with a covered bandshell and exposed lawn seats for the audience.\nOn August 18, 1986, the reunion of Canadian folk duo Ian & Sylvia was filmed at Kingswood by CBC Television, with guests Gordon Lightfoot, Judy Collins, Emmylou Harris and Murray McLachlan.\nAfter the Molson Amphitheatre opened in 1995 and Air Canada Centre opened in 1999 in more populous and centralized downtown Toronto the use of Kingswood as a music venue declined.
