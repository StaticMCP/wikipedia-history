They formed part of a very complicated frontier, which sometimes passes through houses and has tiny enclaves because of land ownership dating back to the 12th century. A few of the Belgian enclaves within Dutch territory even have Dutch counter-enclaves within them.\nPart of the left bank of the Meuse, near Maastricht, was returned to the Netherlands.\nSee also\n* Iron Rhine and Iron Rhine Treaty of 1873\n* Maastricht Treaty of the European Union\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
