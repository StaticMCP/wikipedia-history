The Forum, as it is commonly referred to, is a global event which takes place every 3 years, in a different city each time, and seeks to reunite citizens from a varied range of cultures, languages, religions to foster inter-cultural dialogue and to promote global civil society empowerment. It was the second edition of the Universal Forum of Cultures.\nHistory\nThe forum was held in Monterrey in 2007.\nThis event gathered an approximate 4 million visitors to Monterrey, and was mostly free of charge.\nThe Closing Ceremony started at 18:00 on December 8. An estimated 230,000 people attended the Ceremony on Fundidora Park, where several events took place as part of the Closing Ceremony.\nThe biggest firework show ever seen on Latin America was the closure to the forum, with over 1,500&nbsp;kg on artificial fireworks.\nMain Objectives of the 2007 Forum\nThe main objectives of the Universal Forum of the Cultures Monterrey 2007, were the following:\n* To establish a Dialogue from a civil-society viewpoint, on the most relevant and urgent matters in the Global Agenda.\n* To empower international civil society in becoming relevant actors in the decision-making process in their local communities.\n* To promote interconnection and dialogues between the cultures of the modern world.\n* To know the world through multiple perspectives and distinct cultures.\n* To generate consciousness and commitment to adopt sustainable ways of life for our planet and our societies.\nCore Concepts\nThe Universal Forum of Cultures Monterrey 2007 revolved around 4 Core Concepts or Axis. These 4 topics sum up the vast majority of issues and problems faced by global civil society and will remain, according to experts, the most urgent and relevant working areas for the global community. The 4 Core Concepts of the 2007 Forum were:\n* Cultural Diversity\n* Sustainability\n* Knowledge\n* Peace\nCultural Diversity\nThe existence of cultural diversity in the world is an undeniable fact. People often coexist with others who share different beliefs, traditions and customs. Forum seeks to provide knowledge of the circumstances in which others live, new ways to see the world, respect our planet, and seek social advancement. Forum allowed us to understand the particular elements which entail the richness of our modern world, and seeks to identify the differences between cultures, to promote a respectful, peaceful coexistence.\nSustainability\nSustainability is an issue of major transcendence in the contemporary world, which needs to find new options for economic, social, and cultural development; seeking an improved utilization of natural resources for the benefit of the planet and its inhabitants. Forum took on this sensitive topic not only from an environmental perspective, but from a wide spectrum of approaches.\nKnowledge\nKnowledge is a human construction designed to organize and convey our experiences in the world. The challenge is learning how to make the best use of it so we can achieve an effective improvement in our quality of life. This topic was proposed by the 2007 Monterrey Forum, as it was not debated in Barcelona 2004.\nPeace\nPaving a way for peace does not only mean preventing armed warfare. In the Universal Forum of Cultures, new dialogues on peace were instituted on all levels. Peace with ourselves and the people around us, peace with our ecosystem, and peace amongst peoples and nations. Keeping in mind at all times that there can be no peace where basic needs have not been satisfied.\nActivities and Events for the 2007 Forum\nThe 4 Core Concepts of the Monterrey 2007 Forum were carried out in 4 separate activities programmes.

That meant, that during each particular week, all the Forum Dialogues were centered in one single topic, tackled from various angles and perspectives.
