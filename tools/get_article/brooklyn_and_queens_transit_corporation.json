It was created in 1929 to operate these routes, which had previously been operated by the BMT directly; its operations were transferred to the New York City Board of Transportation in 1940, and to the New York City Transit Authority in 1956.\nPreservation\nA number of cars from the B&QT and its predecessor companies have been preserved.  Several are in the Branford Electric Railway Historic District and one is at the Trolley Museum of New York.\nSee also\n*List of streetcar lines in Brooklyn\n*List of streetcar lines in Queens\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Brooklyn and queens transit corporation\n\n#REDIRECT Brooklyn and Queens Transit Corporation"
