The U.S. Army had assisted production and made edits in the script, but approval was abruptly reversed on the eve of release. The depiction of mistreatment and torture of prisoners of war complicated the courts martial of POW collaborators that were proceeding at the time.\nThe brainwashing and abuse of American prisoners of war during the Korean War was also dramatized in P.O.W. (1953), The Bamboo Prison (1954), and The Manchurian Candidate (1962, starring Frank Sinatra).\nReception\nAccording to MGM records the film made $785,000 in the US and Canada and $292,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $111,000.\nHistorical accuracy\nAuthor Robert J. Lentz of the book Korean War Filmography: 91 English Language Features through 2000 states that the film was \"undeniably overstated\".\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*"
