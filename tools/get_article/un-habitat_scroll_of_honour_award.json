      "text": "# UN-Habitat Scroll of Honour Award\n\nThe UN-Habitat Scroll of Honour Award was created by the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (UNCHS) in 1989 to encourage and recognize the countries, governments, organizations, and individuals who have made great contributions to the development of housing. It is the most prestigious human settlements award in the world by the United Nations, given by the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), and has recognized 192 initiatives since its launch in 1989.\nThe aim of the award is to honour and acknowledge initiatives which have made outstanding contributions in the field of human settlements, provision of housing, highlighting the plight of people living in poverty or who have been displaced, developing, and improving human settlements and the quality of urban life to leave no one behind echoing the Sustainable Development Goals 2030 with emphasis on Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities.\nThe award, a plaque engraved with the name of the winner, is handed over at the Global Observance of the World Habitat Day, the day the United Nations has set aside to remind the world that we all have the power and the responsibility to reflect on the state of our cities and towns and to shape the future. World Habitat Day was established in 1985 by the United Nations General Assembly through Resolution 40/202 and was first celebrated in 1986.\nEligibility\nIndividuals, organizations, the private sector, government, non-governmental, bilateral and multi-lateral aid agencies dealing with sustainable projects which have had great impact in society, and any Habitat Agenda partner who has improved the lives of people can be nominated for the UN-Habitat Scroll of Honour.\nEvaluation criteria\nA Committee comprising from UN-Habitat experts and senior management makes the initial assessment of the nominations and submissions of the candidates and verify that the submission conforms to the standards outlined in the guidelines. After strict reviewing and screening materials of all the candidates, the United Nations Human Settlements Programme chooses the winners.  In the past, every year the number of awards by the United Nations Human Settlements Programme depends, generally below ten. Since 2018 only five winners, ideally from each Region of the world, are selected. Past winners are outstanding in the international, regional or national level of human living and have extensive influences. On every World Habitat Day, the United Nations Human Settlements Programme will hold the award ceremony in a prior selected city.\nWinners\nEach year, the United Nations Human Settlements Programme receives a large number of projects nominated by governments after selection. Recommended candidates can be government organizations or agencies, individuals, or projects, and initiatives can address any aspects of human settlements, such as housing, infrastructure, urban renewal, sustainable human settlements development, or post-disaster reconstruction.\n2025\nAwards were given to the following:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Winner\n!Awarded For\n!Country\n|-\n| Smart Israel || \"For his transformative “Hydroponic Farm-in-a-Box” innovation, which exemplifies an inclusive, circular, and climate-smart approach to sustainable urban food systems and resilient community livelihoods\" || Nigeria\n|-\n| Just a Change || \"For combating housing poverty illustrated by its mission to “Renovate Homes, Rebuild Lives, and Restore Dignity” across vulnerable communities\" || Portugal\n|-\n| Public Works Studio || \"For its pioneering commitment to spatial justice and housing rights demonstrated by its innovative “Housing Monitor” initiative empowering vulnerable communities\" || Lebanon\n|-\n| Clara Marina Brugada Molina || \"For her visionary, participatory approach to urban regeneration and social justice exemplified by her “UTOPIAS” model of inclusive community spaces\" || Mexico\n|}\n2024\nAwards were given to the following:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Winner\n!Awarded For\n!Country\n|-\n| Ville de Rabat || \"For its pioneering approach to integrated and sustainable urban development, exemplified by its \"Rabat a Sustainable and Inclusive City\" vision\" || Kingdom of Morocco\n|-\n| Alcaldía de Santiago de Cali || \"For addressing urban and housing challenges by transforming public spaces, legalizing informal settlements, and promoting sustainable development\" || Colombia\n|-\n| Majlis Bandaraya Ipoh || \"For its efforts to transition the city from a resource-intensive economy to a regenerative model focused on health, waste management, and ecotourism while aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals\" || Malaysia\n|-\n| Allen Kong || \"For his pioneering work in socially and environmentally sustainable architecture, mentorship, and leadership in inclusive design through global programmes and indigenous advocacy\" || Australia\n|-\n| David Satterthwaite || \"For revolutionizing urban development by advocating for improved housing and living conditions for marginalized urban residents.\" || United Kingdom\n|}\n2023\nAwards were given to the following:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Winner\n!Awarded For\n!Country\n|-\n| Fundación Pro Empleo Productivo A.C. || \"For developing training programmes that promote job creation and improve economic productivity in cities\" || Mexico\n|-\n| Dubai Municipality|| \"For establishing and implementing the Fat, Oil and Grease Waste Recycling Programme (FOG) to deal with waste material from the hospitality industry\" || United Arab Emirates\n|-\n| FICA (Fundo Imobiliário Comunitário para Alaguel) || \"For its action devoted to fighting housing speculation and gentrification in central areas of three major cities in Brazil\" || Brazil\n|-\n| Assembleia de Moradores || \"For creating city-wide social, economic and environmental development solutions for all residents through facilitating relations between the City of Braga, the municipal housing company and the social housing beneficiaries of the City of Braga\" || Portugal\n|-\n| EcoVironment || \"For tackling the critical issue of plastic pollution and its detrimental impact on the urban environment\" || Sierra Leone\n|}\n2022\nAwards were given to the following:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Winner\n!Awarded For\n!Country\n|-\n| The 15'min City global initiative || \"For offering a compelling model of sustainable urban development\" || Global\n|-\n| Mr. Stanley Anigbogu || \"For pioneering simple technology to recycle waste and create energy for marginalized communities\" || Nigeria\n|-\n| Ms. Dipti Mahapatro, Bhubaneswar || \"For leadership in transforming a mass rapid transit system to make it inclusive and accessible\" || India\n|-\n| Programa Parceria, Recife || \"For efforts in reducing disaster risks, enhancing resilience and improving infrastructure in favelas\" || Brazil\n|-\n| URBAN Intergroup of the European Parliament || \"For enabling legislation, policies, and finance for sustainable urban development\" || European Parliament\n|}\n2021\nAwards were given to the following:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Winner\n!Awarded For\n!Country\n|-\n| New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA) || \"Its role in providing safe, affordable social housing projects in Egypt\" || Egypt\n|-\n| Shining Hope for Communities (SHOFCO) || \"Being a leading example of a community-led change to eradicate extreme poverty in Kenya’s urban slums\" || Kenya\n|-\n| Baoji City || \"Its innovative housing provision project benefiting low and middle-income residents in Baoji City\" || China\n|-\n| Let's Do It!
