It was dedicated to Viriathus and is located in the . The monument consists of a bronze sculpture of the Lusitanian chieftain-shepherd put on an unpolished stone pedestal that features a battering ram.\nHistory and description\nThe statue was the work of Eduardo Barrón. It is cast in bronze and was discovered in Rome at Nelli's foundry in 1883, it was later bought by the Spanish State.\nThe leading statue of the sculptural ensemble represents a standing and almost naked full-body figure of Viriathus, with his right arm extended in attitude of rallying his troops, while the left forearm holds a tunic and the left hand grabs a sheathed sword below the level of an abnormally long handle (creating a phallic perception from certain angles).\nThe statue stands 2-metre high and its bronze base reads  (\"terror of the Romans\"), an epithet for Viriathus attributed to the Orosius' chronicles. The statue and the quadrangular base stand on a granite pedestal taken from , one of the pretenders claimed to be the Viriatho's birthplace. The granite block features a battering ram emerging from its front side, cast in bronze in 1903.\nFailing to undergo a proper ceremony of inauguration, the monument was casually unveiled by transients on 12 January 1904.\nThe monument, with Viriathus' posture identified as performing a Roman (fascist) salute, was embraced by the Falange as an icon during the Francoist dictatorship.\nFile:WLM14ES - 06082013 125634 ZAMORA 0348 - .jpg|Detail of the head of the battering ram\nFile:Zamora - Plaza de Viriato, Monumento a Viriato 5.jpg\nReferences\n;Citations\n;Bibliography\n*\n*"
