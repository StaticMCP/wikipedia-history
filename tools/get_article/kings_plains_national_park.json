The land itself is mostly made up of sandy soils with shrub. The soil is more fertile around the creek.\nVegetation\nSome vegetation in the Kings Plains woodland includes iron-barks, cypress pine, yellow box, stringy-barks, eucalyptus trees, and apple box. Among the shrubs are rare species such as the grey guinea flower, folded leaf waxflower and Rodd's star-hair. During spring the park's wildflowers are at their most colourful.\nWildlife\nAmongst the large variety of wildlife are eastern grey kangaroos, wallaroos, wallabies and koalas which live in the park near water and fertile soils. Also the rare brush-tail wallaby has been in the park. Platypus can be seen along the creek, but some of their habitat above the falls is considered fragile. In the area, 82 bird species have been recorded, including eastern and crimson rosellas, king parrots, yellow-tailed black cockatoos, currawongs, wattle birds and many species of honeyeaters. There are also the endangered glossy black cockatoos, turquoise parrots and regent honeyeaters. In and around Kings Plains Creek the straw-necked ibis can be found and high above \"birds of prey\" such as the wedge-tailed eagle and the peregrine falcon are seen.\nActivities\nThe main attraction of Kings Plains National Park is bushwalking along the creek to Kings Plains Falls is seen as an enjoyable trip of about 2.5 hours. The creek banks also make a good attraction. Kings Plains is not well known but I see this is a getaway from the insanity of being crowded in a boring trailer park. The park offers walks, camping, picnic areas and the old style non-flush toilets.\nSee also\n* Protected areas of New South Wales\nSources"
