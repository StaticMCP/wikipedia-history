He first appeared in Invincible #61, published by Image Comics in August 2009. Conquest is a high-ranking member of the Viltrumite Empire and one of the most brutal villains in the series.\nConquest is one of the most experienced and strongest members of the Viltrumite race of the Invincible comic book series. He also endured the Great Purge and the Scourge Virus, a genetically engineered disease that killed off the Viltrumite population and left lasting harm on the majority of its survivors. Due to his fragile body, Conquest was gravely hurt in combat with several Rognarrs, a virtually unbeatable lineage reported to be among the sole weaknesses for Viltrumites. The assault left him with a severed-off right arm, pockmarked skin, and loss of his right eye. In spite of these lasting disabilities, Conquest equipped himself with a prosthetic arm and remained in service to the Viltrum Empire.\nConquest was brought into play after the \"Invincible War\" comic book tale as a way to raise the stakes of the current struggle involving Mark Grayson (Invincible) and the Viltrum Empire.\nFictional character biography\nConquest was born during the Argall Period on the planet of Viltrum and is one of the first well-documented Viltrumites. He has lived through two of the most pivotal moments in Viltrumite history: the Great Purge and the Scourge Virus. The latter, a genetically engineered virus targeting Viltrumites, killed about 99.9% of the population and weakened many survivors, reducing the population to around 50 individuals, as explained by Omni-Man to Allen the Alien in Invincible issue #66. Survivors, including Conquest, experienced long-term effects like reduced strength and resilience due to the virus's lasting damage.\nFollowing the Scourge Virus, Conquest encountered a pack of Rognarr, beasts known for their phenomenal strength and the fact that they can fight on equal grounds with Viltrumites. He lost his right arm and an eye in the process. Despite these injuries, he continued serving the Viltrumite Empire, replacing his arm with a prosthetic. Conquest held a very high rank, only a step below Grand Regent Thragg, and wielded vast authority and instilled fear throughout the Empire.\nArrival on Earth\nConquest arrives on Earth to monitor Mark Grayson (Invincible)’s efforts to subjugate the planet for the Viltrumite Empire. Aware of Mark’s resistance, the Empire deploys Conquest, their “nuclear option,” known for never failing to conquer a planet. Unlike other Viltrumites who might frame their actions as beneficial, Conquest openly expresses his enjoyment of violence, saying, “I’m here because I enjoy this.” His clash with Mark turns into a violent battle, causing significant destruction and casualties. During the fight, Conquest severely injures Atom Eve, provoking Mark’s fury. Mark eventually overpowers Conquest with repeated headbutts, leaving him apparently dead. Unbeknownst to Mark, Conquest survives and is secretly imprisoned by Cecil Stedman in a concrete bunker, hoping to extract information about Viltrumite plans.\nViltrumite War and demise\nConquest reappears during the Viltrumite War storyline, acting as an agent of the Viltrumite Empire. After recovering from his injuries, Conquest easily escapes Cecil's containment cell and reports back to the leader of the Viltrum Empire, Grand Regent Thragg. To atone for his failure, Thragg sends Conquest to intercept Omni-Man and Allen as they bring Invincible and his half-brother Oliver to aid the Coalition of Planets against the Empire. Conquest destroys the ship carrying the heroes and engages Mark in a second battle, with Omni-Man and Oliver intervening to aid Mark. Conquest sees Oliver flee to a nearby planet and chases after him, but Mark stops him and locks him in a choke-hold. The two drag each other across the surface, with Mark choking out Conquest as the latter repeatedly punches the former, impaling and disemboweling him. The fight ends with Conquest dying of suffocation, while Mark is left on the brink of death. Omni-Man and Oliver come across the battle's aftermath and stay on the planet for several months to watch Mark as he slips into a coma and slowly heals.\nPersonality and motivations\nIn the animated adaptation, Conquest is portrayed differently from his comic version. The series depicts him enjoying violence while also showing emotional isolation, as other Viltrumites reportedly fear and avoid him due to his notoriety. In his final confrontation with Mark Grayson, he admits, “I am a victim of my own success,” expressing regret that his reputation for mass destruction has led to loneliness and left him with only the name “Conquest.”\nPowers and abilities\nAs a member of the Viltrumite species, Conquest possesses a number of superhuman abilities characteristic of his race. These include superhuman strength and durability, enabling him to engage multiple enhanced opponents simultaneously and withstand extreme physical trauma. He is capable of unaided flight at supersonic speeds and exhibits enhanced longevity, aging at a significantly slower rate than humans.\nConquest also possesses a highly advanced healing factor, allowing him to recover from severe injuries, though he is not invulnerable or immortal. Over the course of centuries, he has honed his skills as a hand-to-hand combatant, developing a brutal and sadistic fighting style. Despite suffering extensive physical damage, including the loss of an arm and severe facial disfigurement, he remains a formidable and highly dangerous adversary.\nReception\nConquest has been recognized as one of the most brutal and memorable villains in the Invincible series. His appearances are often cited for their intense violence and psychological impact on the story’s protagonist. Critics praised his introduction as a turning point in the series, significantly raising the narrative stakes and highlighting the darker aspects of the Viltrumite conflict.\nIn other media\nConquest appears in the 2023 video game Mortal Kombat 1 as a cameo in Omni man's arcade ending.\nAs of 2025, Conquest has also appeared in the animated television series Invincible on Amazon Prime Video, voiced by Jeffrey Dean Morgan, and he has been teased as a potential future antagonist due to fan speculation and comments from the creators.\nCollected editions\nConquest’s key storylines appear in collected volumes:\n* Invincible, Vol. 8: Eleven (first appearance during the War aftermath, issues #61–64).\n* Invincible, Vol. 9: Heads Will Roll (continuation of his first battle).\n* Invincible, Vol. 11: The Viltrum War (marks his final defeat in issues #71–72).\nReferences"
