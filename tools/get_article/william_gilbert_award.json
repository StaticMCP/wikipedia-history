Every other year, the award is designated for an early-career scientist. The award is named after William Gilbert who first proposed the concept of a geomagnetic field in De Magnete (published in 1600).\nWilliam Gilbert Award Winners\nSource: [https://www.agu.org/Honor-and-Recognize/Honors/Section-Awards/William-Gilbert-Award American Geophysical Union]\n{|class=\"wikitable\" align=center\n|-\n!Year!!Name\n|-\n| 2022 ||Courtney Jean Sprain\n|-\n| 2021 ||Richard J.
