In a regular year there will be 600–800 reenactors. The 5-year-anniversaries are greater events with 1,500–2,000 reenactors from France, Belgium, The Netherlands, Great Britain, USA, Germany, Poland, Russia, Sweden, Finland, Spain, Portugal, Argentina and Chile among others.\nWaterloo 2015\nA major event, one of the largest ever staged, was held on the site of the battle to mark the 200th anniversary of the engagement.  6,200 re-enactors, 330 horses, and 120 cannons took part in actions in an arena area close to La Haye Sainte.  During the event, the Allied Army was camped at Hougoumont, with the French camped about a mile away from La Caillou.\nThe event was opened with a poetic interpretation of the Battle, created by Luc Petit.  The show was located on a stage 150 metres long, with giant projector screens, pyrotechnics, dancers, classical musicians and local choirs – in addition to cast members drawn from the re-enactment groups.  Three re-enactors were injured by explosives during this production, with one being taken to hospital with serious burns.\nGallery\nFile:Bataille Waterloo 1815 reconstitution 2011 2.jpg|French cavalry, June 2011\nFile:Bataille Waterloo 1815 reconstitution 2011 3.jpg|In the 2011 recreation, footsoldiers fire guns\nSee also\n* Waterloo (1970 film)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.waterloo1815.be/en/ Official Battle of Waterloo site]\n* [https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4110194.stm History fans recreate Waterloo] BBC\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1aVW3LuVo 360° Battle of Waterloo] National Geographic\n* [http://www.unseenwaterloo.co.uk Unseen Waterloo - The Conflict Revisited]"
