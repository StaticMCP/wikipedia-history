Enterprise Agents are available for Linux, macOS, Windows, Solaris, Microsoft SQL Server, a variety of browsers, and more.  Snare Enterprise Epilog for Windows facilitates the central collection and processing of Windows text-based log files such as ISA/IIS.  Snare Enterprise Epilog for Unix provides a method to collect any text based log files on the Linux and Solaris operating systems.  Opensource Agents are available for Irix and AIX.\nSnare is currently used by hundreds of thousands of individuals and organisations worldwide to meet local and federal information security guidelines associated with auditing and eventlog collection.\nSnare for Windows - Objective configuration\nHistory\nThe Snare series of agents began life in 2001 when the team at InterSect Alliance created a Linux kernel module to implement Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria auditing at the C2 level.\nAgents for Windows, and Solaris soon followed, and additional operating systems, and applications were added to the mix over time.\nThe Snare Server software was originally designed to meet the needs of Australian-based intelligence agency clients, and distribution was restricted to Australia only. The need for a server solution to complement the increasingly popular Snare agents, pushed the InterSect Alliance team to find overseas partners, and allow distribution internationally.\nDistribution\nSnare has been described as the 'De Facto standard for Windows event retrieval', and because of its deep roots in the open source movement, coupled with available commercial support options, is used by small non-profit organisations, right up to huge multinational, Fortune-500 companies.\nOrganisations that produce audit server software that competes with the Snare Server software, such as Cisco, Sensage, and LogLogic\n, all use and recommend the Snare agents to their customers.\nMost agents have both a supported commercial, and an open-source version available.\nDesign\nThe Snare agents have been designed to collect audit log data from a host system, and push the data as quickly as possible, to a central server (or servers), for archive, analysis, and reporting.\nThe central server can be either a syslog server, a Snare Server appliance, or a custom application. Snare agents are also able to push logs over a unidirectional network in order to facilitate log transfer from networks of low classification to networks of higher classification.\nThe Snare Server is an appliance, or software-only solution, that provides a variety of analysis tools and to facilitate the collection, analysis, reporting, and archival of audit log data.\nSnare Product Suite\n* Snare Enterprise Agent for Windows\n* Snare Enterprise Agent for Linux\n* Snare Enterprise Agent for Solaris\n* Snare Enterprise Agent for macOS\n* Snare Enterprise Agent for MSSQL\n* Snare Enterprise Epilog for Windows\n* Snare Enterprise Epilog for Unix\n* Snare Central\n** Snare Repository\n** Snare Reflector\n** Snare Agent Management Tools\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.snaresolutions.com/ Snare Solutions]\n* [https://www.snaresolutions.com/products/snare-central/ Snare Central]\n* [https://www.snaresolutions.com/products/snare-agents/ Snare Agents]\n* [https://sourceforge.net/projects/snare/ Snare Lite] on SourceForge"
