The model is named after Michael J. S. Dewar, Joseph Chatt and L. A. Duncanson. The Dewar–Chatt–Duncanson model describes the binding of a transition metal to the C=C bond.\nThe alkene donates electron density into a π-acid metal d-orbital from a σ-symmetry bonding orbital between the carbon atoms. The metal donates electrons back from a (different) filled d-orbital into the empty π* antibonding orbital. Both of these effects tend to reduce the carbon-carbon bond order, leading to an elongated C−C distance and a lowering of its vibrational frequency.\nIn Zeise's salt KPtCl3(C2H4)].H2O the C−C bond length has increased to 134 picometres from 133 pm for ethylene.  According to the DCD models, this small change in the C-C bond indicates that there is little back-donation from the Pt(II) center. In the nickel(0) compound Ni(C2H4)(PPh3)2 the value is 143 pm.  Ni(0) is expected to be a more powerful pi-donor, resulting in greater donation into the pi antibonding level of the alkene.\ninteractions.]]\nThe interaction also causes carbon atoms to \"rehybridise\" from sp2 towards sp3, which is indicated by the bending of the hydrogen atoms on the ethylene back away from the metal. In silico calculations show that 75% of the binding energy is derived from the forward donation and 25% from backdonation. This model is a specific manifestation of the more general π backbonding model.\nLike alkenes, alkynes adopt a similar bonding interaction, as shown in the image on the right. Not all alkyne-metal complexes utilize all four of these interactions for bonding (due to reasons like unviable d orbitals).\n2} (Ar = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl), which bears an Al-based spx lone pair, reacts with alkenes and alkynes to give alumina(III)cyclopropanes and alumina(III)cyclopropenes in a process analogous to the formation of π-complexes by transition metals.  However, in most cases, the backbonding interaction is absent in these complexes due to the lack of energetically accessible filled orbitals for backdonation, resulting in π-complexes that dissociate readily and are therefore more challenging to observe or isolate.-->\nReferences"
