Students learn Hebrew, eat kosher food, recite Jewish prayers, and celebrate Jewish holidays.\nThe school is unique for its multicultural intake and atmosphere. In the late 1950s, the declining local Jewish population led the school to accept non-Jewish students, most of whom were Muslim due to the changing demographics. As a result, in 2007 about half of the school's 247 students were reportedly Muslim, with less than 40% Jewish. An article in The Independent praised the school's ethos and its efforts in promoting inter-faith harmony from such a young age.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.kingdavid.bham.sch.uk/index.html King David School, Birmingham, England]"
