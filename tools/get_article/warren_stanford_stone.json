He was unusual as a labor leader in that he did not believe in compulsory union membership and was comfortable with \"labor capitalism\". He supported a radical plan in which workers in an industry would take one-third of the profits, the other thirds going to capital and the public. By the end of his tenure the Brotherhood controlled investments worth over $100 million.\nEarly years\nWarren Stanford Stone was born on 1 February 1860 on a farm near Ainsworth, Washington County, Iowa.\nHe attended Western College, Iowa.\nWhen Stone completed his academic education in May 1879, he considered studying to become a surgeon, while his father wanted him to become a lawyer.\nInstead of taking either course, he started work on a railway.\nHe obtained a job as a locomotive fireman with the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad in 1879, based in Eldon, Iowa.\nHe was promoted to engineman five years later.\nHe spent a further nineteen years in this position.\nIn 1884 he married Carrie E. Newell. They had no children.\nLabor leader\nIn August 1903 Stone was elected grand chief engineer of the International Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers to succeed Peter M. Arthur, who had died unexpectedly.\nStone was a Republican but had progressive views. Several U.S. presidents offered him political appointments, but he refused them.\nStone believed that if a worker \"wants to join a union, all right, but it is contrary to the principles of free government and the Constitution of the United States . . . to make him join.\"\nHe had no problem with \"labor capitalism\", where union members would invest their savings to achieve the maximum return, even if that meant investing in non-union enterprises.\nStone was proposed as a challenger to Samuel Gompers, President of the American Federation of Labor at that organization's Chicago conference in January 1920.\nGompers believed the federation should take a non-socialist approach in representing wage-earners, campaigning for better wages, better hours, better working conditions and the unfettered right to strike. Stone supported the radical Glenn E. Plumb plan for tripartite control of the railway industry by labor, capital and the public, and supported similar plans for other industries.\nStone appeared on the cover of Time magazine on 10 March 1924.\nStone was one of the main supporters of the Progressive Party that backed Senator Robert M. La Follette, Sr. as candidate for President of the United States in 1924. In June 1924 the triennial convention of the Brotherhood created the office of President and elected Stone to this position.\nHe was succeeded as grand chief engineer by L. G. Gritting.\nFinancier\n'' Cover, 10 Mar 1924]]\nStone was a financier as well as a labor leader. Under his leadership the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers engaged in a wide range of financial activities in banks, trust companies and other business ventures.\nThe Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers' Cooperative Bank was formed in Cleveland, Ohio in November 1920, and took over $1 million in deposits in the first two months.\nBased on this success, the Brotherhood opened a number of banks in different cities. To manage its investments the Brotherhood established the Brotherhood Holding Company in 1922 and the Brotherhood Investment Company in 1923.\nIt was on Stone’s initiative that the 22-story Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers' Bank building was erected, completed just before his death.  The building was owned by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and leased to the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers Co-Operatlve National Bank.\nStone and other members of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers became owners of the Coal River Collieries, and Stone became chairman of the board of directors of the mine. A dispute arose with John L. Lewis, president of the United Mine Workers of America. Lewis claimed that Stone was closing mines and throwing miners out of work rather than pay the union scale. Stone refuted this, saying the unions had not renewed their agreement, but the mines were being worked on a cooperative plan. He said \"We feel sure there are no better-satisfied men employed anywhere than in the Coal River Collieries.\"\nDeath and legacy\nWarren Stanford Stone died on 12 June 1925 of Bright's disease in a hospital in Cleveland, Ohio.\nAt the time of his death, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers had majority interests in enterprises with assets of approximately $150,000,000.\nThroughout his tenure as head of the railway engineers, they had never had to call a strike.\nStone was succeeded as president by William B. Prenter.\nAlvanley Johnston became grand chief engineer.\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\n*\n* |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/01/25/103198096.pdf\n|date=25 January 1920 |journal=The New York Times|title=Gompers or Stone to Control Labor Federation?|access-date=2013-07-29}}\n* |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,880792,00.html\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219130242/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,880792,00.html\n|url-status=dead\n|archive-date=February 19, 2012\n|title=Labor: Warren S.
