It features high-resolution graphics in a style reminiscent of Disney and Don Bluth animated films and is the first ''King's Quest game with multiple protagonists: Queen Valanice and Princess Rosella, who are both spirited away to the realm of Eldritch, and Rosella is transformed into a troll. They must find a way to return Rosella to normal and find her true love, defeat a powerful evil force threatening this realm, and return to the kingdom of Daventry.\nKing's Quest VII is the first game in the series to divide the story into chapters. Some puzzles have multiple solutions, and there are two possible endings. Critical reactions to the game were generally positive.\nGameplay\nKing's Quest VII has a different structure compared to previous King's Quest'' titles. The action and story is separated into six chapters, each set primarily in a different region of the realm of Eldritch. The player alternates between two protagonists, Valanice and Rosella, with each chapter. The two protagonists travel through some of the same places during the course of the game, finally meeting up again in the end. The player has the option to choose the chapter from which to begin playing the game, and will enter gameplay from the beginning of the selected chapter.\nAside from the multi-chapter layout, a significant change in game structure is the simplification of user interface by the use of a smart pointer. When playing the game, the pointer lights up when passed over an object that can be interacted with. Players can get or use objects, investigate areas, and talk to characters by directly clicking on them, whereas previous games required the player to select an action icon and then click on the environment. Occasionally, large environments are traversed across a continuous, panning screen instead of being divided into multiple screens. Additionally, although many dangerous characters and situations are encountered throughout the game that can lead to the death of the player character, the player is given the option to immediately return to gameplay and try again, rather than restore a saved game as previous King's Quest titles were designed.\nNotably, ''King's Quest VII makes use of SVGA graphics, new at the time, later used by other adventure games such as The Dig and Space Quest 6. As a result, King's Quest VII features painted environments and highly detailed and stylized animation.\nPlot\nThe name of this entry, The Princeless Bride, is a pun on the title of The Princess Bride. Like most King's Quest'' titles, it is also a reference to the plot: Princess Rosella is soon to be a bride, but ends up in another world shortly before her marriage. It is the only entry in the series to feature Queen Valanice in a major role, and also the only one in which King Graham is not shown or mentioned at all (with one minor exception in version 1.4).\nStory\nWalking through a forest in Daventry with her mother, Queen Valanice, Princess Rosella dreams of adventures in faraway lands while her mother pressures her to find a prince to marry. As they argue, Rosella sees in a pond an image of a castle in the clouds and leaps in, followed by the worried Valanice.\nAfter escaping the desert she was sent to by the portal, Valanice arrives in a forest where she finds out that Attis and Ceres, the Lord of the Hunt and Mother Nature, have been transformed into a stag and a tree respectively by the evil enchantress Malicia, who drove an iron stake into Ceres' roots, leaving her with a life-threatening wound that could endanger all of nature if Ceres dies. Making her way to the nearby town of Falderal, Valanice is arrested after recovering a giant block of cheese that falls from the sky, the moon of the realm.\nMeanwhile, Rosella is pulled out of the portal into the Vulcanix Underground by Otar, the Troll King. To Rosella's shock and disgust, she has been transformed into a troll herself and is to be married to Otar. Seeking a cure and escape, Rosella encounters the friendly troll Mathilde who offers to concoct a potion that can cure Rosella. Rosella is able to gather the ingredients and is cured, but Malicia locks her away to prevent Rosella from distracting Otar. Escaping, Rosella discovers Malicia conspiring with Otar to cause the volcano the Underground is part of to erupt which will destroy the entire realm. Rosella and Mathilde discover that Otar is being held prisoner in the Land of Ooga Booga, while the one Rosella has met is an imposter working with Malicia. Rosella uses an elevator lift to rise to the Land of Ooga Booga to search for the real Otar.\nRosella successfully reaches the Land of Ooga Booga, but the passage back to the Underground collapses behind her. With the help of local physician and mortician Dr. Mort Cadaver, Rosella begins seeking out the real Otar while evading many dangers, notably a boogeyman loyal to Malicia. After rescuing Dr. Cadaver's black cat, Rosella receives one of the cat's lives and the location of Otar. Rosella manages to find Otar and the two plot to return to the Underground to foil Malicia using a secret entrance hidden somewhere in Falderal. Leaving Ooga Booga to arrive in a swamp, Otar convinces Rosella to steal back a mysterious device from Malicia's house nearby that is the only thing that can stop Malicia. After evading the Were-Woods' werewolf-like inhabitants, the two manage to find the secret entrance in Falderal's town hall and reenter the Underground, only to find the imposter Otar having just activated the volcanic eruption.\nMeanwhile, Valanice has been pardoned after returning the moon to the sky and breaks Attis' curse by restarting the local river. Using a magic salve to safely cross the Were-Woods, Valanice makes her way to the Land of Ooga Booga where she learns about the former lord of the realm, Count Tsepish, from his dog. Valanice locates and returns Count Tsepish's missing head and in return, he allows Valanice use of his horse to reach Etheria, a kingdom in the sky. In Etheria, Valanice locates the Fates who tell her that King Oberon and Queen Titania, who can stop the volcano, are gone and she must travel to the dreamworld to speak to Mab, the lady of dreams. With the help of Dr. Cadaver, Valanice is able to enter the dreamworld while asleep, only to discover Mab frozen in a block of ice. By breaking the curses on Ceres and Mab, Valanice is able to contact King Oberon and Queen Titania, and they prepare to stop the volcano's eruption.\nMeanwhile in the volcano's control room, Rosella uses Otar's magic wand to restore the imposter to his true form, revealing him to be Edgar, the handsome fairy who she encountered in Tamir who had helped her to save her father. Malicia knocks Otar out, blows Edgar away and imprisons Rosella within the volcano's crater. As Oberon, Titania and Mab attempt to contain the volcano, Rosella manages to return to the control room and awaken Otar who stops the eruption. With the help of Edgar, Valanice is finally reunited with her daughter, only for Malicia to kill Edgar, but Rosella manages to use the device she recovered from Malicia's house to turn Malicia into an infant.\nMultiple endings\nThe game offers two different endings after the final confrontation with Malicia. In the good ending, Rosella revives Edgar using the extra life that she had received from Dr. Cadaver's cat. King Oberon and Queen Titania arrive and reveal that Edgar is their son who was kidnapped as a child by the evil fairy Lolotte before Rosella rescued him while in Tamir. He was subsequently kidnapped again and brainwashed by Malicia, who is revealed as Titania's sister who wished to rule Etheria and was driven out. Titania intends to raise Malicia from infancy in hopes that Malicia will not fall to evil again. Edgar reveals that he is the one who pulled Rosella to Eldritch and apologizes for his actions. Rosella agrees to Edgar's request to court her and the entire realm celebrates Malicia's defeat and the return of their prince as Rosella and Edgar fly away in a white swan-like carriage.\nIn the bad ending, Rosella fails to revive Edgar and he dies. Oberon and Titania arrive and sadly explain what happened to him before taking Valanice and Rosella home in a black carriage.\nCharacters\n* Valanice (voiced by Carol Bach y Rita) - After her daughter disappears, Queen Valanice ends up in the desert with nothing but Rosella's comb, which she picked up before going after her. Now the Queen of Daventry is on a quest to find her daughter, bring peace to Eldritch, and return to her kingdom.\n* Rosella (voiced by Maureen McVerry) - Not wanting to be married, Princess Rosella believes she saw a castle in the reflection of a lake and jumped in. She now must stop her marriage to the Troll King, find a way to put an end to the wicked Malicia's diabolical plan, and return home with her mother.\n* Malicia (voiced by Ruth Kobart) - The main villain of the game, Malicia is a vain and bitter enchantress who is both human and faerie. She has been banished from Etheria, a faerie kingdom in the clouds above Eldritch, after attempting to overthrow her good sister. After regaining her powers, Malicia decided to destroy Etheria in revenge through the use of the Vulcanix Underground's volcano. Malicia is encountered many times throughout the game and is eventually defeated.\n* Edgar (voiced by Jesse Moises) - Not seen until Chapter 6, Edgar is the Prince of Etheria who had previously appeared in ''King's Quest IV'', where he was kidnapped by the faerie witch Lolotte before he was rescued by Rosella. He was then enchanted by Malicia and turned into a Troll King, taking the place of the real king as her puppet, but is eventually restored to his rightful form. Depending on Rosella's actions, Edgar either lives and courts Rosella, or dies and is mourned by his parents Oberon and Titania.\n* Mathilde (voiced by Esther Hirsch) - The former nursemaid to King Otar, Mathilde befriends Rosella early on in her journey. In exchange for Rosella's help in investigating the troubles in the land, Mathilde supplies Rosella with a potion that reverses her transformation into a troll. After learning that Otar has been replaced by an imposter, Mathilde helps Rosella escape the Vulcanix Underground.\n* Mort Cadaver (voiced by Marcus Lewis) - The undead doctor, undertaker and coroner of the Land of Ooga Booga. He acts as a friend and ally to both Rosella and Valanice, particularly after Rosella gives him a new backbone to replace the one that he had recently given away. Mort supplies both women with information and supplies that help them on their journey, even giving Valanice a safe place to sleep at one point so that she can visit Mab in dreamland.\n* King Otar (voiced by Denny Delk) - The king of the trolls in the Vulcanix Underground. When Rosella and Valanice arrive in the Realm of Eldritch, he has been captured and replaced by an imposter. Rosella manages to rescue the real Otar in the Land of Ooga Booga and he helps her return to the Underground where Otar stops the volcanic eruption.\n* Attis (voiced by Toby Gleason) - The Lord of the Hunt in the Realm of Eldritch. When Valanice finds him, Attis has been cursed into the form of a stag by Malicia while his wife, Ceres, is cursed into the form of a tree. Attis' curse is broken when Valanice restores the River of Life and he drinks from it. Subsequently, Attis returns the favor by saving her from one of Malicia's monsters. After Valanice breaks Ceres' curse, Attis departs to help defend Etheria from Malicia.\n* Ceres (voiced by Carol Bach y Rita) - The wife of Attis and Mother Nature in the Realm of Eldritch. When Valanice finds her and Attis, Ceres has been cursed by Malicia into the form of a tree with an iron stake driven into one of its roots, a wound that will kill her and have devastating consequences for nature. After Attis is restored, he removes the stake, but Ceres' curse isn't broken until Valanice heals her with a pomegranate from a magical cornucopia. Ceres later gives Valanice information on how to break Mab's curse.\nDevelopment\nThe developers aimed for the effect of traditional animation works by Walt Disney Pictures and Don Bluth. As such, the full game contains more than five times the animation of any other Sierra game of the time. Art director Andy Hoyos specifically cited the intensity of the colors in Disney's Aladdin as an inspiration model. Composer Jay Usher said: \"Just seeing how a character carries himself, acts, or walks ultimately determines the outcome of the music. We've tried to give each character [their] own 'mini-theme'. Each character is unique, so the music should be as well\". The final game was much shortened from an earlier concept in order to fit the game on a single CD-ROM.\nThe game's backgrounds were hand-drawn and scanned. The game sprites were pencil-drawn on paper and also scanned, and then edited and colored digitally, not unlike the traditional animation process in animated feature films of the era. Of the 70 characters that appear in the game, some are more realistic and human-like (like the protagonists) and others more cartoony. According to lead animator (and character designer) Marc Hudgins, it was the first time when the art department had to use outside (Russian and Croatian) animation houses. Part of the challenge was that the animators had no experience in computer game animation.\nRelease\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Title !! Region !!

By November 2000, PC Data reported that King's Quest VIIs sales in the United States alone had reached between 300,000 and 400,000 units.\nSome critics and fans of the series disliked the use of Disney-style cartoon graphics. On the other hand, upon release PCZone praised its \"stunning graphics and superb gameplay\". A reviewer for Next Generation'' approved of the series's transition from idealized fantasy imagery to highly detailed cartoon graphics, and said the game maintained the ''King's Quest'' standard for outstanding soundtracks. He concluded: \"While it's certainly not the most challenging game available, it may be one of the most impressive in look and feel, and fans of the series should definitely check this one out\". A review in Computer Gaming World hailed the game's \"animation of quality that would make Disney proud\". A retrospective verdict in Adventure Gamers described it as \"an eminently playable, if not revolutionary, adventure game\", and \"a solid—if not stellar—entry in the King’s Quest collection\".\nComputer Gaming World nominated ''King's Quest VII as its 1994 \"Adventure of the Year\", although it lost to Relentless: Twinsen's Adventure. The editors called King's Quest VII'' \"one of the year's most charming releases\", and concluded: \"The feature-quality animation and the hodge-podge of classic tales make it the closest we're likely to come to a fairy tale on the computer\".\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.sierrachest.com/index.php?a=g&id=7&fld=s&gconf=1 ''King's Quest VII] at the Sierra Chest\n* [http://www.sierrahelp.com/Games/KingsQuest/KQ7Help.html King's Quest VII Technical Help] at the Sierra Help Pages\n* [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110267/ King's Quest VII: The Princeless Bride''] at the Internet Movie Database"
