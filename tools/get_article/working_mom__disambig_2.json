It aired on SBS from July 30 to September 18, 2008 on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:55 for 16 episodes.\nPlot\nWorking Mom revolves around the many difficult choices and tradeoffs working women make as they juggle career and family. Choi Ga-young is a successful career woman whose life turns upside down when she accidentally becomes pregnant with the child of her younger co-worker, the troubled but charming Park Jae-sung. Suddenly, she finds herself transformed into a full-time mom dealing with two rowdy little boys.\nDetermined to return to her glory days, Ga-young decides to start working again, but she has to leave her kids with someone. It would have been her mother, but she died a few years ago and now the only way is to persuade her father to get married again. At first, everything seems to be going smoothly, until Ga-young's plan takes a turn when her new stepmother refuses to take care of her step-grandsons. Thus, Ga-young's quest to win back her job and her husband (who is secretly having an affair with his colleague) begins.\nCast\nMain characters\n*Yum Jung-ah as Choi Ga-young\n*Bong Tae-gyu as Park Jae-sung\n*Cha Ye-ryun as Go Eun-ji\n*Ryu Tae-joon as Ha Jung-won\nSupporting characters\n*Kim Ja-ok as Kim Bok-sil\n*Yoon Joo-sang as Choi Jong-man\n*Im Dae-ho as Go Joo-mong\n*Hong Su-min as Jung Hyun-joo\n*Noh Jung-woong as Park Ji-ho\n*Jung Tae-won as Park Ji-min\n*Kim Ji-young as Ahn Heung-boon\n*Lee Sung-min as Kang Chul-min\n*Kwon Se-in as Park In-seong\n*Jung Suk-won as Swimming pool lifeguard\n*Kim Ga-yeon as Park In-hye\n*Jung Hyo-eun as Kang Soo-bin\n*Lee Eun-soo as Kang Won-jae\n*Ha Jae-young as Jang Kyung-tae\n*Lee Seung-hyung as Lee Bang-won\nOriginal soundtrack\n| length1         = 03:24\n| title2          = 사랑을 몰라요 (You Don't Know About Love)\n| note2           =\n| extra2          = Sunny (Girls' Generation)\n| length2         = 03:33\n| title3          = 그대를 꿈꾸다 (Dreaming of You)\n| note3           =\n| extra3          = Lee Yoon-jong\n| length3         =\n| title4          = 너만 있다면\n| note4           =\n| extra4          = Lee Yoon-jong\n| length4         =\n| title5          = Summer Latin\n| note5           =\n| extra5          = Various Artists\n| length5         =\n| title6          = 허무한 일상\n| note6           =\n| extra6          = Various Artists\n| length6         =\n| title7          = 기분 좋은 날 (Lovely Day)\n| note7           =\n| extra7          = Various Artists\n| length7         =\n| title8          = I'm Working Mom\n| note8           =\n| extra8          = Various Artists\n| length8         =\n| title9          = Sometimes\n| note9           =\n| extra9          = Various Artists\n| length9         =\n| title10         = 말썽 꾸러기 (Troublemaker)\n| note10          =\n| extra10         = Various Artists\n| length10        =\n| title11         = 천일몽\n| note11          =\n| extra11         = Various Artists\n| length11        =\n| title12         = Hunting\n| note12          =\n| extra12         = Various Artists\n| length12        =\n| title13         = 달콤한 휴식 (Sweet Relief)\n| note13          =\n| extra13         = Various Artists\n| length13        =\n| title14         = Sometimes (Guitar Ver.)\n| note14          =\n| extra14         = Various Artists\n| length14        =\n| title15         = Working Flamingo\n| note15          =\n| extra15         = Various Artists\n| length15        =\n}}\nAwards and nominations\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
