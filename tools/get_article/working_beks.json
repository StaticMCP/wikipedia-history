His decision could redefine his sense of self and his place in the world, risking the love and stability he has built with his fiancée.\nJet (Stefan), a promiscuous call center agent, experiences a paralyzing anxiety attack after learning that a recent hookup has committed suicide following an HIV diagnosis.
