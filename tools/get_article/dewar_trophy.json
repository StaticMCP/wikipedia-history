The three cars, all registered in London under the numbers A2EO, A3EO and A4EO, were driven 25 miles to the Brooklands race track at Weybridge. There, the cars completed ten laps of the track, or approximately 30&nbsp;miles, before being locked away until Monday, 2 March 1908, when they were released and disassembled completely, using only wrenches, screwdrivers, hammers, and pliers. Each car was reduced to a pile of 721 component parts, which were then scrambled into one heap by the RAC. Eighty-nine parts requiring extreme accuracy were withdrawn from the heap, locked away at the Brooklands club house and replaced with new parts from Anglo-American's showroom stock. The parts were then sorted into three piles, each with all the parts needed to assemble a car. A mechanic – Mr. E. O. Young – reassembled the cars with the help of his assistant – Mr. M. M. Gardner. Sometimes they had to work ankle-deep in water, using only wrenches and screwdrivers. The third car was re-assembled by Thursday morning, 12 March. With the painted parts on the original cars not being identical in color or style, the reassembled cars were mismatched in appearance, gaining the nickname \"harlequin cars\". By 2 p.m. on Friday 13 March the three cars had completed the mandatory 500-mile run with singular regularity. Only one point was lost owing to a broken cotter pin in the ignition lever (promptly replaced from stock). During the event, it was reported that one of the sheds where the parts were stored became partly flooded during a heavy storm and some parts became rusted. Only oily rags could be used to remove all traces of the immersion. On completion of the test, one of the cars was locked away until the start of the 2000-miles reliability trials in June 1908. It came out the winner of the R.A.C. Trophy for its class. Parts interchangeability had been publicly demonstrated and field tested.\n1909 Trophy-winning performance\nImmediately following the introduction of the sleeve-valve principle into the Daimler engine, the Daimler Company in 1909 asked the Royal Automobile Club to frame conditions of a test that should be of unprecedented severity and would demonstrate in the most public manner possible that the new Daimler engine was in every way reliable.\nThe two engines selected for this test were a 38 and a 22-h.p., having a bore and stroke, respectively, of 124 by 130&nbsp;mm. and 96 by 130&nbsp;mm. They were bolted down to the test bench close together in one of the large engine testing shops at the Daimler Works. The section of the shop in which they were placed was railed off and under the sole charge and observation of the R.A.C. officials from the start of the test to the finish. The observers kept watch day and night just as on board a ship, and periodically tested the revolution counters and spring balances to ensure that the engines were always running under full load. Every possible precaution was taken to keep constant and close observation upon the test, and there were never less than two observers on duty.\nBoth engines were started up at 6 a.m. on Monday, March 22, 1909, and each completed the 132 hours' bench test on the following Saturday evening. To appreciate more clearly the severity of the test, if the larger engine had been driving a car during the whole time, with the standard Daimler gear ratios, a distance of no less than 8,252 miles (13280&nbsp;km) would have been covered, at a mean speed of 43.45 m.p.h. (69.92&nbsp;km/h) while the smaller engine would have covered, similarly, a distance of 8,830 miles (14210&nbsp;km) at 48.4 m.p.h. (77.9&nbsp;km/h). The disparity in speed and distance between these results is, of course, attributable to the higher rate of revolutions of the smaller engine.\nDetails of the 38-H.P. Engine Test\nFirst Bench Test\nThe speed of the engine was 1200 r.p.m. giving a limit of 50.0 h.p. below which the h.p. was at no time to fall.\nThe duration of the test was 5 days 14 hours 15 minutes or 134.25 hours.\nThere were no stops incurring any penalties.\nThere were five stops totalling 1 hour and 56 minutes which did not incur any penalty under Rule 6 (2)\nThe load was eased for a total of 19 minutes for brake adjustments, but the engine was not stopped.\nAverage horse-power recorded, 54.3.\nPetrol consumed, 614 gallons equal to .679 pints per horse-power hour.\nRunning Test\nOn completion of the first test, the engine was removed from the bench and fitted under observation to the chassis without any vital parts being disturbed. A standard type four-seater body was fitted and the car proceeded from Coventry to Weybridge – 112 miles (180.2&nbsp;km). The average weight of the car and passengers on the road was 4,085&nbsp;lbs = 1 ton 16 cwt 1 qr 25&nbsp;lbs (1852.9&nbsp;kg).\nThe runs on Brooklands track amounted to 1,930.5 miles (3106.8&nbsp;km)at an average speed of 42.4&nbsp;mph (68.2&nbsp;km/h) with an average weight of car and passengers of 3,805&nbsp;lb (1726&nbsp;kg). A distance of 5 miles was traversed in running to and from the car-headquarters and the track, and this with the return journey to Coventry made a total mileage of 2,159.5 (3474.5&nbsp;km).\nThe petrol consumption on the track was equal to 20.57 m.p.g. and on the road 19.48 m.p.g.\nThe ton-miles per gallon of fuel were 34.94 on the track and 35.97 on the road.\nFinal Bench Test\nOn arrival in Coventry, the engine was replaced on the test bench and run for 5 hours 15 minutes during which there were no stoppages of any description; the load was eased for 15 minutes for brake adjustments.\nAverage horse-power recorded, 57.25.\nPetrol consumed, 22.5 gallons = .599 pints per horse-power hour.\nThe judges append the following remarks to their certificate:\n\"The engine was completely dismantled, and no perceptible wear was noticeable on any of the fitted surfaces.\nThe cylinders and pistons were found to be notably clean.\nThe only perceptible wear in any part was caused by two joint pins rubbing against adjacent parts.\nThe ports of the valves showed no burning or wear.\"\nDetails of the 22-H.P. Engine Test\nFirst Bench Test\nThe speed of the engine was 1,400 r.p.m. giving a limit of 35.3 h.p. below which the h.p. was at no time to fall.\nThe duration of the test was 5 days 12 hours 58 minutes or 132 hours 58 minutes.\nThere were no stops incurring any penalty.\nThere were two stops of 17 minutes total duration, which did not incur any penalty under Rule 6 (2)\nThe load was eased for a total of 41 minutes for brake adjustments, but the engine was not stopped.\nAverage horse-power recorded was 38.83.\nPetrol consumed, 476.5 gallons equal to .739 pints per h.p. hour.\nRunning Test\nThe conditions for the running test were the same as for the 38-h.p. car test, but with varying figures as to the results.\nAverage weight of the car and passengers on the road was 3,512.5&nbsp;lbs (1638.6&nbsp;kg); on the track, 3,332.5&nbsp;lb (1511.6&nbsp;kg).\nDistance covered on Brooklands track, 1,914.1 miles (3080.4&nbsp;km).\nAverage speed, 41.88&nbsp;mph (67.4&nbsp;km/h).\nThe petrol consumption on the track was equal to 22.44 m.p.g. and on the road 19.48 m.p.g.\nThe ton-miles per gallon of fuel were 33.37 on the track and 31.19 on the road.\nThe total mileage of 2,143.1 (3449&nbsp;km).\nFinal Bench Test\nDuration, 5 hours 2 minutes. No stoppages of any description; the load was eased for 1 minute.\nAverage horse-power recorded, 38.96.\nPetrol consumed, 18.25 gallons = .749 pints per h.p. hour.\nThe judges append the following remarks to their certificate:\n\"The engine was completely dismantled, and no perceptible wear was noticeable on any of the fitted surfaces.\nThe cylinders and pistons were found to be notably clean.\nThe ports of the valves showed no burning or wear.\"\nSee also\n* List of motor vehicle awards\n* Invicta – Double Dewar Trophy winner: 1926, 1929.\n* Fred Marriott – driver of the Stanley Rocket, the car that has held the Land Speed Record for a steam-powered vehicle from 1906 to 2009.\n* Ricardo plc – Double Dewar Trophy winner: 2002, 2005.\nNotes\nReferences\n* }}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*|chapter= 7 From a Class-based market...|chapter-url= |access-date= 26 March 2015 }}\n*"
