The facility also has the world's most extensive collection of American rodeo photographs, barbed wire, saddlery, and early rodeo trophies. Museum collections focus on preserving and interpreting the heritage of the American West. The museum has an extensive collection of paintings by Charles Marion Russell and Frederic Remington. It also hosts the annual Prix de West Invitational Art Exhibition and Sale each June, one of the leading events in the world of Western American Art. The Prix de West Artists sell original works of art as a fundraiser for the museum.\nHistory\nBulldogging photo of \"Cowboy Morgan Evans\", 1927 World Champion]]\nThe museum was established in 1955 as the Cowboy Hall of Fame and Museum, from an idea proposed by Chester A. Reynolds, to honor the cowboy and his era. Later that same year, the name was changed to the National Cowboy Hall of Fame and Museum. In 1960, the name was changed again to the National Cowboy Hall of Fame and Western Heritage Center. The American Alliance of Museums gave the museum full accreditation in 2000, when it took on its present name.\nTo maintain the memory of the founder, the museum grants the Chester A. Reynolds Memorial Award. This prize is granted to a person or institution contributing to the preservation of American West history and heritage.\nExhibits\nThe museum encompasses more than  of display space. The museum's collection includes over 2,000 works of western art, the \"William S. and Ann Atherton Art of the American West Gallery\".

The collection also includes over 700 pieces by Edward S. Curtis, and over 350 by Joe De Yong, along with the large plaster sculpture of James Earle Fraser's End of the Trail.\nThe museum also houses contemporary Western art created over the last 30 years by award-winning Prix de West artists. The first winner was a large oil by Clark Hulings, \"Grand Canyon - Kaibob Trail\", about a mule team barely crossing a Grand Canyon trail in deep winter snow.\nThe historical galleries include the American Cowboy Gallery, a look at the life and traditions of a working cowboy and ranching history; the American Rodeo Gallery, fashioned after a 1950s rodeo arena, provides a look at America's native sport; the Joe Grandee Museum of the Frontier West Gallery exhibits some of the more than 4,500 artifacts that once belonged to Western artist Joe Grandee; the Native American Gallery focuses on the embellishments that Western tribes made to their everyday objects to reflect their beliefs and histories; the Weitzenhoffer Gallery of Fine American Firearms houses over 100 examples of firearms by Colt, Remington, Smith & Wesson, Sharps, Winchester, Marlin, and Parker Brothers.\nThe museum also houses Prosperity Junction, a  authentic turn-of-the-century Western prairie town.
