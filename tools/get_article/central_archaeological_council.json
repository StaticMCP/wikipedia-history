This was renamed to Archaeological Committee (Ἀρχαιολογικὴ Ἐπιτροπὴ, Archaiologikí Epitropí) and given broader powers in 1899, to Archaeological Council (Ἀρχαιολογικόν Συμβούλιον, Archaiologikón Symvoúlion) in 1910, and to Central Archaeological Council (Κεντρικό Αρχαιολογικό Συμβούλιο, Kentrikó Archaiologikó Symvoúlio) in 1977.\nIts members are selected among scientists, educators, artists, and archaeologists. It is charged with the preservation and restoration of cultural monuments, the management of archaeological sites, the establishment and management of museums, and the supervision of research and excavation activities both by the local ephorates of antiquities as well as by the foreign archaeological institutes active in Greece.\nReferences"
