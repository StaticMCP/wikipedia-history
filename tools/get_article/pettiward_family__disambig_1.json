In 1763 Rev. Roger Pettiward gave to the parish of Putney a piece of ground adjoining the road from Wandsworth to Richmond, for the purpose of a cemetery, now Putney Old Burial Ground. In 1749 he married Miss Douglas Sandwell. In 1792 Daniel Lysons reported that the former residence of Mr White was occupied by \"Mrs Pettiward\" (née Douglas Sandwell), the widow of the late Rev. \"Roger Pettiward, D.D.\", (born Roger Mortlock). She was then in possession of \"a portrait of Henry White, Esq., represented in his High Sheriff's dress, and two excellent pictures of the celebrated Lord Falkland, by Cornelius Jansen; and Sir Abraham Dawes, by the same master. Sir Abraham was one of the farmers of the customs, an eminent loyalist, and one of the richest commoners of his time.

A sewer had been built under the land in 1855 by the Metropolitan Commissioner of Sewers, under compulsory powers, unbeknownst to Pettiward, who in 1865 claimed compensation of £1,500 as his plans would need redrawing. The Pettiward's building contractor was William Corbett and Alexander McClymont, who built most of the houses in the 1860s. About 220 houses were built at that time on land owned by R. J. Pettiward. He died in 1908 leaving no male progeny, only 9 daughters and thus in accordance with the tail male the estates passed to his cousin Charles Terry (1855–1933), who in 1908 by royal licence adopted the surname Pettiward in lieu of his patronymic.\nCharles (Terry) Pettiward (1855–1933)\nCharles (Terry) Pettiward (1855–1933), cousin, who in 1908 by royal licence adopted the surname Pettiward in lieu of his patronymic.
