It is not known when the church opened but it was operational by July 1937. Due to a declining congregation and the ease of attending Catholic services in Tully, the church held its last regular Mass on 2 November 1984, although it was used for occasional baptisms and weddings. The church was sold in 1992 to new owners who make the church available for services by any denomination, renaming it \"Chapel of the Pioneers\". It is on Tully Hull Road (). It is listed on the Cassowary Coast Local Heritage Register.\nDemographics\nIn the , Lower Tully had a population of 79 people.\nIn the , Lower Tully had a population of 88 people.\nEducation\nLower Tully State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 6 Collins Road ().
