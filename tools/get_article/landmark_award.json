The award was created in 2015 and was designed for people who were not drivers to be recognized in the Hall of Fame (drivers can still be nominated and win the award, Janet Guthrie in 2024 was the first driver to win the award). Previously, these people (such as the inaugural Landmark Award winner Anne France) were mixed in with members of race teams (drivers, crew chiefs, team owners, etc.) as nominees for the NASCAR Hall of Fame, although this is no longer the case.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
