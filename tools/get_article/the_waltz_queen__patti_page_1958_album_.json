      "text": "# The Waltz Queen (Patti Page 1958 album)\n\nThe Waltz Queen is a compilation album by Patti Page. It was released in January 1958 on Wing Records, a subsidiary company of the larger Mercury Records. It was distributed as a vinyl LP.\nIt should not be confused with an album of the same name released by Mercury in 1955 under catalog numbers MG-20049 and SR-60049. It was issued in two versions, one with 12 tracks and one with only 10.  The album was reissued with a similar cover as simply Patti Page because of the confusion in using the same title as a popular full-priced release by the label's top star. The stereo version didn't involve much stereo, as almost all the tracks originated as mono singles. One exception was \"Born to Be With You,\" intended for a single release which never took place.\nVic Schoen and his Orchestra provided the musical accompaniment. He was also the musical director, recording supervisor and engineer.\nTrack listing\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=2|Track number\n!Title\n!Songwriter(s)\n!Time\n|-\n|12-track version||10-track version\n|-\n|1||1||\"Mad About the Boy\"||Noël Coward||3:06\n|-\n|2||2||\"Born to Be With You\"||Don Robertson||2:31\n|-\n|3||3||\"The Strangest Romance\"||Fay Tishman||2:09\n|-\n|4||4||\"That Old Feeling\"||Lew Brown, Sammy Fain||\n|-\n|5||5||\"Steam Heat\"||Richard Adler, Jerry Ross||2:16\n|-\n|6||(absent)||\"Croce Di Oro (Cross Of Gold)\"||Kim Gannon||2:40\n|-\n|7||6||\"Once in a While\"||Michael Edwards, Bud Green||2:55\n|-\n|8||7||\"My Restless Lover\"||Pembroke Davenport||3:00\n|-\n|9||8||\"You Don't Know What Love Is\"||Gene DePaul, Don Raye||3:11\n|-\n|10||9||\"Tomorrow But Not Today\"||Tishman||2:58\n|-\n|11||10||\"I Wonder Where Oh Where You Are\"||Phil Springer, Sid Wayne||2:30\n|-\n|12||(absent)||\"You Are the One\"||Dorcas Cochran, Henri Contet, Paul Durand, Irving Taylor||2:32\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
