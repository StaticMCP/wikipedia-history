It can be as simple as a lockable bike cage or shed or as complex as a purpose-built multi-level building.\nSome bicycle parking stations offer additional services such as bicycle repairs or facilities such as showers or lockers. Some are staffed; others are not. Some require users to join as members, while others are on a per-use basis or completely free of charge. Some are based at railway stations to facilitate \"bike and ride\" multi-modal transport, while others are situated at the end of the commute and as such are located in town or city centres, universities, and workplaces. Some allow the storage of helmets and other personal belongings. To save space, many store bicycles vertically, either in a kind of tower or under the floor in shafts.\nOperation\nBicycle parking stations are often operated by local governments or municipalities or they can be private businesses run by bike shops or non-profit bicycle advocacy organizations. Some are fully automated.\nTypes\nThere are several types of bicycle parking stations.\nMost bicycle parking stations are non-automatic, and the user usually leaves their bike at bicycle parking racks in the facility. These facility are usually sheltered or indoor, but unsheltered outdoor facilities also exist.\nAutomatic bike parking stations exist in many forms, such as underground silos using automated storage and retrieval system.\nServices\nBike stations may have several services connected to the facility, including on-site security or a gate or door secured by key or by proximity card access to prevent thefts. Customers may also be able to use showers or locker rooms and changing rooms. There may be on site bathrooms and drinking fountains as well as food and beverages available via vending machines.\nThere may also be information available, such as pamphlets/brochures for bicycle safety, maps and other literature ,e.g. about cycling routes or nearby points of interest. Some may even provide classes, e.g. bike maintenance or local area knowledge.\nBike services\nSome bike stations (such as at many railway stations in the Netherlands) have staff who can perform simple or complex repairs for a fee. This is useful for commuters who can leave their bike there in the morning and pick it up repaired on the way home.\nStations may also provide an air pump, sell parts and accessories, or rent bicycles.\nPricing\nThe most common pricing scheme for bike stations are:\n* a user pays service: the stations cost money to use, either through daily, weekly, monthly payments or through periodic memberships (though sometimes non-members can pay for daytime locker use).\n* free-of-charge service: the bike stations are usually fully paid for by the local municipality, local regional government, or by the operating company (e.g. for bicycle parking stations located at railway stations)\n* mixed system: some small charge may be required from the end-user (e.g. an administration charge) but the bulk of the operating costs are paid for by another entity.\nConstruction costs\n* The bike station in Washington, D.C., opened in 2009 and cost 4&nbsp;million US dollars for  of space and storage for 150 bicycles.\n* The King George Square Cycle Centre in Brisbane, Queensland opened in June 2008 and cost 7&nbsp;million Australian dollars.  It has 33 showers, 420 lockers, and parking for 420 bicycles in two-level racks.\n* The bike station at Utrecht Railway Station in the Netherlands was completed in 2019 for around €30 million and holds 12,500 bicycles, making it the world's largest.
