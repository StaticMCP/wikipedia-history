The statutory law authorized criminal penalties for the unlawful aerial transportation of controlled substances. The Act of Congress mandated the revocation of aircraft registrations and airman certificates by the Federal Aviation Administration whereas an aircraft aviator knowingly engages in the transit of illicitly used drugs. The Act established authority and a statute of limitations for the reissuance of airman certificates by the United States Secretary of Transportation.\nThe S. 1146 legislation was passed by the 98th U.S. Congressional session and enacted into law by the 40th President of the United States Ronald Reagan on October 19, 1984.\nHistory\nIn 1982, the United States created the Operation Bahamas, American, Turks and Caicos (OPBAT) initiative harmonizing an interdiction for the narcotic drug trafficking in the West Indies waters. The Bahamas and Turks and Caicos initiative was a cooperative drug interdiction operation supported by an alliance of federal enforcement organizations as coordinated by;\n{|\n|☆ Drug Enforcement Administration\n|-\n|☆ Law Enforcement Detachments\n|-\n|☆ Royal Bahamas Police Force\n|-\n|☆ Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force\n|-\n|☆ United States Atlantic Command\n|-\n|☆ United States Coast Guard\n|-\n|☆ United States Coast Guard Tactical Squadron\n|-\n|☆ United States Customs and Border Protection\n|-\n|☆ United States Southern Command\n|}\nFederal Anti-Crime Task Force for Southern Florida\nIn January 1982, the Reagan Administration established the Federal Anti-Crime Task Force for Southern Florida standardizing a multi-jurisdictional law enforcement organization for confronting organized crime in the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and Southeastern United States. The Florida Counter-drug Task Force developed and governed containment measures for the domestic and international enterprises sustaining illegal drug trade activities in the Lucayan Archipelago and Straits of Florida.\nIn October 1982, United States President Ronald Reagan made a public announcement from the Great Hall of the Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building. The presidential public declaration addressed the federal initiatives related to the interdiction of drug trafficking and organized crime confronting the United States borders and continental maritime boundaries.\nNational Narcotics Border Interdiction System\nIn March 1983, the Reagan Administration announced the formation of the National Narcotics Border Interdiction System (NNBIS). The National Narcotics Border Interdiction established an air, land, and sea anti-smuggling engagement while supporting the federal controlled substance enforcement operations of the South Florida Task Force.\nSee also\n{| style=\"width: 85%; border: none; text-align: left;\"\n|-\n|Cannabis & Controlled Substances Schedule I || Illegal drug trade in Latin America\n|-\n|Capital punishment for drug trafficking || Marihuana Tax Act of 1937\n|-\n|Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act of 1983 || Mexican drug war\n|-\n|Central American crisis || Military Cooperation with Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies Act\n|-\n|Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act || Multijurisdictional Counterdrug Task Force Training\n|-\n|Drug prohibition law || Nicaraguan Revolution\n|-\n|Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act || Salvadoran Civil War\n|-\n|Guatemalan Civil War || Special Central American Assistance Act of 1979\n|}\n{| style=\"width: 45%; border: none; text-align: left;\"\n|-\n|Aviation Artifacts in Bahama Islands\n|-\n|\n|-\n|◎ Bimini\n|-\n|◎ Norman's Cay\n|-\n|◎ Spanish Wells\n|-\n|◎ Staniel Cay\n|}\nReferences\nIn popular culture\nThe Cinema of the United States developed motion pictures depicting covert activities of drug trafficking traversing America’s boundaries by aviation and ground payload during the last quarter of the 20th century.\n{| style=\"width: 100%; border: none; text-align: left;\"\n|★ Air America (1990) ||★ Mr. Nice (2010)\n|-\n|★ American Gangster (2007) ||★ Narcos (2015)\n|-\n|★ American Made (2017) ||★ Queen of the South (2016)\n|-\n|★ Blow (2001) ||★ Traffic (2000)\n|}\nPeriodical Bibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
