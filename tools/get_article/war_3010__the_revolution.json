It was released in 1996 only for North America. The story takes place in 3010 and is the sequel to War 2410.\nPlot\nIn the years following the victory of humanity over the three other factions in the fateful conflict of 2410, most of the known universe has been occupied by an intergalactic menace known as the Kyllen. Slavery, for most of the civilized species, only became an unavoidable reality once the freedom-loving citizens lost their political and social autonomy sometime in the year 2610. Even the humans have lost their freedom and must struggle in slavery amongst the rest of the universe.\nGameplay\nIn order to save humanity (and the rest of the civilized universe), the player must command a battle fleet; which was seized from the Kyllens by a group of human slaves. A space armada can be maintained each level by upgrading the vessels with the newest weapons and gears.\n}}\nIn a brief review for GamePro, Scary Larry deemed the game overly complex and said the static graphics and bland music made it dull to play. He gave it a 2.0 out of 5 in every category (graphics, sound, control, and fun factor).\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.mobygames.com/game/36078/war-3010-the-revolution/ War 3010: The Revolution] on MobyGames"
