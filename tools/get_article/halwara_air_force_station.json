It is one of the oldest frontline airbases of the IAF and was actively involved in both, 1965 and 1971 Indo-Pak conflicts because of its strategic location. It is home to the 220 Squadron known as \"Desert Tigers\" and 221 Squadron known as \"Valiants\" flying the Sukhoi Su-30MKI.\nThe state government signed a Memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Airports Authority of India (AAI) in December 2018 to construct a civil enclave at the air base. It will be spread over 135.5 acres and is expected to ready in three years.\nHistory\nThe airfield was built in 1942 by the Royal Air Force. Halwara was used as an allied Air Force staging base during World War II and was abandoned after the war. Halwara was reactivated under the Indian Air Force on 16 March 1950, and is one of the oldest frontline airbases of the IAF.\nThe base was home to two Spitfire squadrons in the early 1950s. The de Havilland Vampire, the first jet aircraft of the IAF, was introduced to the base in 1954. The 1800 metre runway was extended to its present length in 1963. Due to its strategic location, Halwara was actively involved in both 1965 and 1971 Indo-Pak wars. The base housed squadrons of MIG 23 BN for three decades until March 2009 when they were phased out. In September 2012, Halwara inducted its first squadron of the Sukhoi Su-30MKI becoming the first air base in the Western Air Command to operate the aircraft.\nLudhiana International Airport\nIn December 2018, the Government of Punjab a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the AAI in December 2018 to construct a civil enclave at the air force base.

The Government of Punjab will provide 135.54 acres of land by way of its equity in the project, while AAI will bear the costs of developing the airport.
