It is in the northern part of the Auckland Region,  north of Auckland and  south of Whangārei, at the head of Mahurangi Harbour. State Highway 1 runs past it.\nMahurangi Harbour and surrounding area has been settled by Māori since at least the 13th century. As Warkworth is the uppermost navigable point on the Mahurangi River, it was a crossroads between overland traffic and waka, and gained the name , referring to the waterfalls on the river. Māori people of the Mahurangi Harbour area moved seasonally between different kāinga based on available resources, and came to the dense kauri forests at Puhinui for food resources such as berries and eels, and to fell trees to build waka.\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, Ngāti Rongo, Ngāti Raupō and Ngāti Manuhiri were active in the Warkworth area. The area was depopulated during the Musket Wars of the 1820s, with Te Kawerau hapū taking shelter with differing tribes in the north. Ngāti Rongo returned to the area in 1836, followed by Ngāti Manuhiri in the early 1840s.\nEuropean settler John Anderson Brown first settled at Warkworth in 1843, establishing a timber mill on the banks of the Mahurangi River. The town was officially established in 1853, and became a hub for timber and shipbuilding industries. The town became a hub for the Wilsons Cement Works in 1884. By the 1930s, as roads improved, it transitioned into a commercial and service hub for the surrounding rural area.\nWarkworth and the surrounding areas was home to over 40 United States Army camps during World War II. In 1971 the Warkworth Radio Astronomical Observatory was established near the town. The town's population has grown significantly since the mid-2000s.\nEtymology\nWarkworth was named in 1853 by early settler John Anderson Brown, who took the name from Warkworth in Northumberland, allegedly because the Mahurangi River reminded him of the River Coquet at Warkworth, where a relative of Browns worked as a school headmaster. The major streets of Warkworth were named after villages adjacent to Warkworth in England, or after major Northumbrian families. For ten years prior to this, the area was known as Brown's Mill, after the John Anderson Brown sawmill, and until the 1870s the township was primarily known by the name Upper Mahurangi.\nThe traditional Māori name for Warkworth is  (\"Big Plume\"), referring to the Puhinui Waterfalls located in the township.\nGeography\nis a major waterway that flows through Warkworth]]\n-dominated forest until the mid-19th century. Some remnant kauri trees can be found at Parry Kauri Park]]\nThe Warkworth area is at the upper navigable point of the Mahurangi River, which flows south-east towards the Mahurangi Harbour. The township is located at the point where the river runs over a low waterfall and becomes a tidal estuary, The wider area is predominantly uplifted Waitemata Group sandstone. Historically, the area was heavily forested until European settlement.\nThe highest point in Warkworth is a  hill located between Falls Road and View Road, where a water reservoir and cellphone tower are located.\nOn the eastern side of the river is the Mahurangi Peninsula, with the seaside towns of Snells Beach and Algies Bay. It is here that the scenic Kawau Island is found, notable for its historic Mansion House, once the private retreat of Governor Grey.\nEast of Warkworth and north of Mahurangi East lies the Tāwharanui Peninsula, home of the Tāwharanui Regional Park and Tawharanui Marine Park. To the north is the town of Wellsford, with the thickly forested Dome Valley lying in between. On the west coast lies the Kaipara Harbour, while to the south is the small historic township of Puhoi and further south the larger town of Orewa.\nClimate\nKöppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as oceanic (Cfb), but it is rainier in winter.\n}}\nHistory\nMāori history\nThe wider Mahurangi area has been settled since at least the 13th century. Local traditions describe Toi-te-huatahi being the founding ancestor for Mahurangi peoples, and Toi is the namesake for many features in the area, including Little Barrier Island / Te Hauturu-o-Toi and the Hauraki Gulf (Te Moananui-ā-Toi). One of the first known iwi to have settled in the area is Ngāi Tāhuhu. Named for Tāhuhunui-o-te-rangi, captain of the Moekākara waka, the iwi also settled at Ōtāhuhu in Auckland, Whangārei and the Bay of Islands. Te Arawa and Tainui migratory waka are known to have visited the area, and descendants of captain Manaia of the Māhuhu-ki-te-rangi waka are known to have intermarried with Ngāi Tāhuhu. A location of significance near Warkworth is , the peak of the Dome Forest, which was used as a traditional boundary marker, and is the location where Tainui ancestress Reipae married the Ngāi Tāhuhu rangatira Tahuhupotiki.\nMahurangi peoples primarily focused settlement along the shores of the Hauraki Gulf, moving seasonally between different kāinga based on available seasonal resources. Puhinui was a crossroads, at the highest navigable point by waka. This led to overland ara. While the majority of known archaeological sites near Warkworth are on the Mahurangi Harbour coast, the Mahurangi River (traditionally called ) shores and adjoining forests would have been utilised for resources, such as berry collecting, bird snaring, flax harvesting, eel fishing and felling trees to construct waka.\nArrival of Maki\nhas traditionally been the focus of settlement in the wider Warkworth area]]\nIn the mid-17th century, the warrior Maki migrated from the Kāwhia Harbour to his ancestral home in the Auckland Region. Maki conquered and unified many of the Tāmaki Māori tribes, including those of the West Auckland, the North Shore and Mahurangi, and unified these peoples under the name Te Kawerau. In Mahurangi, this was done by conquering Ngāi Tāhuhu, and by forming peacemaking marriages with the Te Roroa and Ngāti Manaia/Ngātiwai tribes who were migrating from the north.\nAfter Maki's death, his sons settled different areas of his lands, creating new hapū, including the Mahurangi hapū of Ngāti Rongo, Ngāti Raupō, Ngāti Manuhiri, Ngāti Maraeariki, Ngāti Poataniwha and Ngāti Kahu.\nNgāti Rongo formed from the union of Maki's son Ngāwhetu and Moerangaranga of Ngā Rīriki, the latter of whom is also an ancestor for Te Uri-o-Hau of Ngāti Whātua. Ngāti Raupō descend from Maki's son Maraeariki, and settled on the Tāwharanui Peninsula, while Ngāti Manuhiri settled the Whangateau Harbour north to Pākiri. As these hapū developed, Ngātiwai developed strong ties to Kawerau hapū through successive generations of intermarriage, especially Ngāti Rehua, Ngāti Manuhiri, and Ngāti Kahu.\nBy the mid-1700s, Marutūāhu tribes from the Hauraki Gulf, especially Ngāti Pāoa, sought to control the shark fishery located on the Mahurangi coast, between Kawau Island and the Whangaparāoa Peninsula. War broke out between Ngāti Pāoa and the Kawerau hapū. By the early 19th century, Kawerau-descended hapū held exclusive land rights to the Mahurangi, while fishing rights were shared between these hapū and the Marutūāhu tribes.\nBy the early 19th Century, the Mahurangi Harbour was primarily settled by Ngāti Rongo and their related hapū Ngāti Kā and Ngāti Raupō, all of whom kept close ties to Ngāti Manuhiri, while Marutūahu tribes frequented the coast during the summertime.\nMusket Wars and Early European arrivals\nlogging has occurred in the Mahurangi Harbour area since the 1830s]]\nIn the early 1820s during the Musket Wars, Ngāpuhi and related northern tribes attacked the Mahurangi area settlements in retaliation for past losses, leading to the Mahurangi area being depopulated. Ngāti Rongo, then approximately 100 people, sought refuge with their Ngāti Manu relatives in the Bay of Islands under the protection of Pōmare II, Ngāti Raupō at Whangārei with Te Parawhau and Te Whareumu, and Ngāti Mahuhiri to the north of Whangārei with Ngātiwai.\nIn 1832, Gordon Browne established a spar station on the Pukapuka Peninsula of the Mahurangi Harbour. Browne obtained rights to fell kauri from Marutūāhu tribes, after which Ngāpuhi chiefs Patuone and Tītore brokered a deal with the British Royal Navy to supply kauri spurs for navy ships, using the spar station. This station was the first European settlement in the Auckland Region, and most of the station labourers were members of Ngāti Pāoa and Ngāpuhi. The station operated until 1834, and was contested by Kawerau descendant hapū.\nNgāti Rongo returned to the Mahurangi area in 1836, under the leadership of Te Hēmara Tauhia, focusing settlement at Te Muri. Ngāti Rongo and Ngāti Raupō occupied modern Warkworth by the late 1830s or early 1840s, with Ngāti Mahuhiri likely returning in the early 1840s. By this period, many of the Kawerau hapū had developed associations with Ngāti Whātua, and the Mahurangi area was contested between Kawerau, Ngāti Whātua and Marutūāhu tribes.\nLand sales and early colonial settlement\nFollowing the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, the Crown made the first purchases of the Mahurangi and Omaha blocks on 13 April 1841, which included the Mahurangi Harbour. While some iwi and hapū with customary interests had been engaged, such as Ngāti Paoa, Ngāti Rongo, Ngāti Raupō and Ngāti Manuhiri were not a part of this transaction, and it took the Crown until the 1850s to finalise a deal with these tribes. Te Hemara Tauhia and his people continued to occupy their lands at Te Muri during this time.\nIn 1843, early settler John Anderson Brown began squatting on land along the Mahurangi River, establishing a dam and timber mill on the left bank in 1844. The timber industry, later joined by shipbuilding, were the two major economic activities in the area during the mid-19th century. In 1853, Brown was among the first land owners in the area, when Warkworth was established as a planned settlement and he and his daughter Amelia purchased  of land from the Crown. The town developed slowly, primarily around the Mahurangi River wharf, where settlers could supply goods and services for the Auckland market. Bridge House Lodge, established on the site of John Anderson Brown's home next door to the Warkworth Bridge, is the oldest surviving building in Warkworth.\nThe Mahurangi Post Office and Library were established in 1859, followed by the first local government in the area, when the Mahurangi Highway Board was established in 1863. In the same year, the Mahurangi School opened, and by 1868 Henry Palmer had established a flour mill in the settlement. Shipbuilding declined in the area during the late 1870s, and ceased in 1880. Unlike other areas of northern Auckland and Northland, kauri gum digging did not appear to play a large part in the economy of the town. Orchards were established around Warkworth, with some continuing to operate today.\nIn 1883 the Masonic Hall was built and up until 1911 served as a public hall until a dedicated building was constructed on the corner of Alnwick and Neville Streets.\nNgāti Rongo continued to hold a presence in the area in the 19th century. While initially made landless through the Mahurangi Purchase, a native reserve was established between Pukapuka and Waiwera in 1853. Land in this block was gradually sold land to settlers, and when Te Hemara Tauhia died in 1891, his Ngāti Rongo family moved to Glorit. In the 21st century, 13 iwi and collectives have interests in the Warkworth area, of whom Ngāti Manuhiri are considered mana whenua; or having historic and territorial rights in the area.\nLime and concrete works\nJohn Sullivan began Warkworth's first roche lime production in 1849. John Southgate established a second limeworks at a site further downstream in 1857, selling it to Nathaniel Wilson in 1864.\nWilson became interested in cement in 1883 and formed the Wilsons Cement Works in 1884 with his brothers John and James. The site became the first portland cement manufacturing works in the Southern Hemisphere. The company built the Warkworth Bridge in 1899.\nBy 1910, the cement company had become one of the major employers in Warkworth. In 1918, it amalgamated with the New Zealand Portland Cement Company, who were based in Motu Matakohe – Limestone Island in Whangārei, and the operation was gradually moved to Whangārei, eventually closing entirely in 1929. Ruins remain and the mine is a popular local freshwater swimming hole.\nWorld War II, developing community\nhuts at the Warkworth Museum]]\nIn 1933, the road to Auckland had improved enough that the town no longer relied on the steamer service to transport goods, and the steamers stopped operating in 1937. After this time, Warkworth transitioned from a logging town into a commercial and service hub for the wider north Auckland area. Logging continued at Warkworth until the 1930s.\nDuring World War II, Warkworth and the surrounding area became home to over 40 camps for United States Army servicemen, including the 3rd Marine Division, 25th Infantry Division and the 43rd Infantry Division. The first personnel to arrive were the 43rd Infantry Division in October 1942, and camps included the modern-day Rodney Showgrounds, and a military hospital that was constructed near Hill Street.  The historic cement works, which had been closed since 1928, was used as demolition practice by the servicemen. By 1944 when the United States Army had left, the New Zealand Army requisitioned many of the camps.\nIn 1971, the Warkworth Radio Astronomical Observatory was established near the town, as the first major long-range telecommunication centre for satellite telephone circuits and television in New Zealand. By 2010, the facility had been redeveloped as an AUT radio observatory.\nThe Warkworth & District Museum, a local museum showcasing local history, opened in 1980.\nWarkworth saw significant suburban housing growth between 2008 and 2018, with the population increasing by 61% between 2006 and 2018. In 2023, the Pūhoi to Warkworth section of the Auckland Northern Motorway was opened, diverting traffic away from Warkworth. The town is currently projected to triple in size by the late 2040s.\nLocal government\nThe first local government for the township was the Upper Mahurangi Highway District, which was formed on 24 December 1864. It was one of the first highway districts to form north of the city of Auckland, and was formed to administer the road upkeep costs in the area. With the abolition of the provinces of New Zealand in 1876, Warkworth became part of Rodney County, which was formed at that time. The highway district was merged with the Lower Mahurangi Highway District in 1903 and it became the Warkworth Road Board. In 1908 the road board became a town board, and in 1954 it became a town council following the Municipal Corporations Act. In 1976 Warkworth became a district community council of Rodney County. From 1989 to 2010, Warkworth was part of Rodney District.\nIn November 2010, all city and district councils in the Auckland Region were merged into a single unitary authority, Auckland Council, with Warkworth in the Rodney Local Board area. Electors in Warkworth vote for the seven-member Rodney Local Board, and also a Rodney ward councillor, who represents the area on the Auckland Council. The local board operates from the Warkworth Service Centre on Baxter Street. The Rodney Local Board formerly held meetings outside of the local board area, in Orewa on the Hibiscus Coast. Since 2023, the local board has held meetings at 3 Elizabeth Street in Warkworth.\nDemographics\nWarkworth is described by Statistics New Zealand as a small urban area. It covers  and had an estimated population of  as of  with a population density of |R}}/15.58|0}} people per km2.\n}}\nWarkworth had a population of 6,675 in the 2023 New Zealand census, an increase of 1,089 people (19.5%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 2,406 people (56.4%) since the 2013 census.
