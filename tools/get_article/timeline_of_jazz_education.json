      "text": "# Timeline of jazz education\n\nTimeline of jazz education (a chronology of jazz pedagogy):  The initial jazz education movement in North American was much an outgrowth of the music education movement that had been in full swing since the 1920s. Chuck Suber (né Charles Harry Suber; 1921–2015), former editor of Down Beat, averred that the GI Bill following World War II was a key impetus for the jazz education movement in higher education.  During the WWII, the U.S. Armed Forces had been the nation's largest employer of musicians – including women musicians.  After the War, many of those musicians sought to pursue music as a career, and, with assistance of the GI Bill, found colleges offering curricular jazz.  Suber also pointed out that the rise of stage bands in schools was directly proportionate to the decline of big name bands.\nNon-academic (non-curricular)\nSocial services for children\n{| valign=\"top\"; border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" style=\"color:black; background-color: #FFFFFF\"\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|width=\"5%\" style=\"text-align:right\"| 1891:\n|width=\"95%\" style=\"text-align:left\"|Jenkins Orphanage of Charleston, was founded by Rev.

The school's influence in formalizing jazz education rapidly rose to prominence. Long before formalizing its jazz curriculum, the school had some of New York's top jazz artists on its faculty and as students.\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|width=\"5%\" style=\"text-align:right\"|Bridgeport:\n|width=\"95%\" style=\"text-align:left\"|The University of Bridgeport started its jazz studies program in 1971 under the direction of Neil Slater (born 1931), who ran it for 11 years. Slater then, from 1981 to 1982, was Chair of the Jazz Studies Department, and director of the One O'Clock Lab Band, at the North Texas.\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|colspan=\"2\" width=\"100%\" style=\"text-align:left\"|Jazz Studies PhD programs in the 1980s\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|width=\"5%\" style=\"text-align:right\"|\n|width=\"95%\" style=\"text-align:left; border: 1px darkgray; border-style: solid none solid none; background-color: #F8F9FB;\"|Few institutions offered doctorates in jazz in the 1980s.  And few jazz educators held doctorates.  Billy Taylor, who had over 23 honorary doctorates in his lifetime, had earned a PhD in 1975 from the University of Massachusetts. His dissertation was titled \"The History and Development of Jazz Piano: A New Perspective for Educators.\"  Donald Byrd earned an EdD from Teachers College, Columbia University in 1983, where he wrote \"The Performance and Analysis of an Original Afro-American Musical Composition for Trumpet and Orchestra.\"  Of the few jazz educators in the 1980s holding PhDs who were associated with jazz research, most had migrated from non-jazz fields such as general music theory, music history, musicology, and ethnomusicology.  In the 1980s, only two institutions offered a PhD in jazz:\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|width=\"5%\" style=\"text-align:right\"|NYU:\n|width=\"95%\" style=\"text-align:left\"|The Department of Music and Performing Arts at the Steinhardt School, New York University, offered a PhD in Jazz Performance and Composition, but the degree, at the time, had no research requirement.\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|width=\"5%\" style=\"text-align:right\"|\n|width=\"95%\" style=\"text-align:left\"|The University of Northern Colorado in Greeley offered a PhD in Jazz Pedagogy, but, according to Lewis Porter who published an article in 1989 on the topic, the degree did not require scholarly research.\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|width=\"5%\" style=\"text-align:right\"|\n|width=\"95%\" style=\"text-align:left; border: 1px darkgray; border-style: solid none solid none; background-color: #F8F9FB;\"|Porter, in 1989, stated that the field was in dire need of PhDs, and noted that, at the time, the existing programs did a poor job attracting African American scholars at PhD levels in jazz. Also in 1989, Warrick L. Carter (1942–2017), Chairman of the Department of Music at Governors State University, estimated that 15 or 20 schools offered postgraduate jazz programs leading to a master's degrees.\n|}\nNotes and references\nNotes\nFurther reading\n| \"Jazz Studies in American Schools and Colleges: a Brief History,\" by Daniel Murphy, Jazz Educators Journal, Vol. 26, 1994, pp. 34–38;\n| \"Das Hoch'sche Konservatorium in Frankfurt am Main (1878–1978)\" (thesis-dissertation), by Peter Cahn (de), Hoch Conservatory, Frankfurt: Kramer (de) (1979);\n| [https://archive.today/20060322085120/http://www.intstudy.com/articles/ec185a14.htm \"Jazz Education in Britain,\"] by Emma Hall (Leeds College of Music), originally published in Educational Courses in Britain (publish date not known, but before 2008);\n, retrieved October 30, 2008, is dead –  is a URL operated by BigChoice Group, Ltd., of London, founded 1999.
