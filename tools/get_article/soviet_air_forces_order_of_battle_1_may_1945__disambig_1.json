Area of\". The actual term used in the Russian order of battle is ob'yekty, which literally means 'objects'. However, in the military sense it can mean structures, and targets. One possible interpretation that can be offered to better define the use in English is that the meaning here is of the actual \"area of responsibility\" of the unit in terms of military installations, facilities, military logistics networks and other possible enemy targets. In this sense the meaning is more area-related then referring to a specific location, specifying the area that the air unit would have to cover.\n*Western Front PVO\n**2nd Corps PVO (Air Defence)
