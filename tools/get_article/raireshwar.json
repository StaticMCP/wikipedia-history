It is between various hills and forts, such as Kenjalgad. In the Maratha Empire age, it was a significant fort.\nRairashwar is known for its seven-coloured soil (mine with seven colour rocks which made this soil), which has evoked the interest of geologists.\nTemple\nRaireshwar has a temple famous for its historical importance. The temple is very old and of stone structure, but it was later re-constructed in the 18th century. The temple is on a plateau, with many beautiful flowers; during monsoon, it is the best time to visit.\nChatrapati Shivaji Maharaj took the oath of the foundation of ‘Hindavi Swarajya’ at Shri Raireshwar temple on Chaitra Shu. In 1645, Saptami and his companion Mavalas went against the invasive foreign dynasties of that time. Hence, Raireshwar holds special importance as the origin of Hindavi Swarajya.\nRaireshwar temple.jpg|Raireshwar temple\nPanorama View from Raireshwar.jpg|Panorama View from Raireshwar\nKenjalgad from Raireshwar.jpg|Panorama View from Raireshwar with Kenjalgad on left.\nTourism\nThe Raireshwar plateau in Pune's Bhor Taluka is renowned for its historical significance and is a popular tourist and trekking destination in Maharashtra.
