One new song, \"Don't Say No\" (released as a single in 1967), was also included.  The album did not make the Billboard LP chart.\nBoth mono (WDM 681) and stereo (WDS 681) versions were released.  International releases included Canada (Wand 681) and United Kingdom (Marble Arch MAL829, different cover, only ten tracks). The LP was also released in Germany in 1973 (Metronome 200 104, different cover). The album has not been reissued on CD.\nThe group described the album cover as a \"licorice pizza\".\nTrack listing\n# Louie, Louie &ndash; 3:00 (Richard Berry)\n# The Jolly Green Giant &ndash; 1:56 (L.
