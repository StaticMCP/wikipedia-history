However it remained open and volunteer groups repaired the track in 1973 at the cost of $150,000 after securing funding. The site was sold in 1980 to the Vancouver Community College, which resulted in the closure and subsequent demolition of the oval after the final meeting on 3 September 1980.\nReferences"
