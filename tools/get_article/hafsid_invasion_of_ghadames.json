It opposed the forces of the Hafsid caliph Abu Faris Abd al-Aziz II to those of the city of Ghadames.\nExpedition\nThe caliph Abu Faris Abd al-Aziz II, accompanied by Maliki scholars, marched to the fortified city of Ghadames with the goal of conquering it and spreading Malikism in Tripolitania. The city was looted and eventually surrendered to the caliph.\nAftermath\nCaliph Abu Faris Abd al-Aziz II imposed an annual tribute on Ghadames. He was the first ruler to effectively enforce such a tribute on the city.\nReferences"
