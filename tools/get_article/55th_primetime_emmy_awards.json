The ceremony was broadcast on Fox. The Sci Fi channel received its first major nomination this year for Outstanding Miniseries for Taken; the series won the award.\nWith the win for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for Debra Messing, Will & Grace became only the third television show to have all credited actors win a Primetime Emmy Award for their respective role, following All in the Family and The Golden Girls (also later tied by The Simpsons). For its seventh season, Everybody Loves Raymond won its first Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series. It led all comedies with four major wins and ten major nominations. The West Wing won Outstanding Drama Series for the fourth consecutive year, tying the record set by Hill Street Blues (also later tied by Game of Thrones and Mad Men).\nDespite failing to win Outstanding Drama Series, The Sopranos continued to rake in the awards, leading all dramas with four major wins, including James Gandolfini and Edie Falco winning their third and final trophy for their respective category. Also Joe Pantoliano's win for Supporting Actor in a Drama marked the first time HBO had won in this category.\nAdditionally, for the first time, not only did the Lead Male in a Comedy award go to a show outside the Big Four TV networks, with Tony Shalhoub's win, for Monk on the USA Network, it was that network's first ever Acting win.\nFor the first time since 1991, the Outstanding Drama Series field did not include Law & Order; it was nominated 11 times in the category, a record for drama series that still stands. The mark tied the overall record held by comedy series M*A*S*H and Cheers. For the first time since its premiere, Frasier, then in its tenth and penultimate season, didn't win a major award, with its only major nominations going to David Hyde Pierce and John Mahoney for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. The ceremony featured 11 presenters, which included: Ellen DeGeneres, Brad Garrett, Darrell Hammond, George Lopez, Conan O'Brien, Bernie Mac, Dennis Miller, Garry Shandling (who opened the show with a comedic monologue), Martin Short, Jon Stewart, and Wanda Sykes.\nWinners and nominees\nWinners are listed first and highlighted in bold:\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program winner]]\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Everybody Loves Raymond (CBS)'\n** Curb Your Enthusiasm (HBO)\n** Friends (NBC)\n** Sex and the City (HBO)\n** Will & Grace (NBC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'The West Wing (NBC)'\n** 24 (Fox)\n** CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (CBS)\n** Six Feet Under (HBO)\n** The Sopranos (HBO)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'The Daily Show with Jon Stewart (Comedy Central)'\n** ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien (NBC)\n** Late Show with David Letterman (CBS)\n** Saturday Night Live (NBC)\n** The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (NBC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Cher: The Farewell Tour (NBC)'\n** 75th Annual Academy Awards (ABC)\n** Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band (CBS)\n** Robin Williams: Live on Broadway (HBO)\n** Rolling Stones: Forty Licks World Tour Live at Madison Square Garden (HBO)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Door to Door (TNT)'\n** Homeless to Harvard: The Liz Murray Story (Lifetime)\n** Live from Baghdad (HBO)\n** My House in Umbria (HBO)\n** Normal (HBO)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Taken (Sci Fi)'\n** Hitler: The Rise of Evil (CBS)\n** Napoléon (A&E)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" colspan=\"2\" |\n* 'The Amazing Race (CBS)'\n** 100 Years of Hope and Humor (NBC)\n** AFI's 100 Years... 100 Passions: America's Greatest Love Stories (CBS)\n** American Idol: The Search for a Superstar (Fox)\n** Survivor (CBS)\n|}\nActing\nLead performances\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Tony Shalhoub – Monk as Adrian Monk (USA)'\n** Larry David – Curb Your Enthusiasm as himself (HBO)\n** Matt LeBlanc – Friends as Joey Tribbiani (NBC)\n** Bernie Mac – The Bernie Mac Show as Bernie McCullough (Fox)\n** Eric McCormack – Will & Grace as Will Truman (NBC)\n** Ray Romano – Everybody Loves Raymond as Ray Barone (CBS) (Episode: “Counseling”)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Debra Messing – Will & Grace as Grace Adler (NBC)'\n** Jennifer Aniston – Friends as Rachel Green (NBC)\n** Patricia Heaton – Everybody Loves Raymond as Debra Barone (CBS) (Episode: “Baggage”)\n** Jane Kaczmarek – Malcolm in the Middle as Lois (Fox) (Episode: “Baby”)\n** Sarah Jessica Parker – Sex and the City as Carrie Bradshaw (HBO)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'James Gandolfini – The Sopranos as Tony Soprano (HBO)'\n** Michael Chiklis – The Shield as Vic Mackey (FX)\n** Peter Krause – Six Feet Under as Nate Fisher (HBO)\n** Martin Sheen – The West Wing as President Jed Bartlet (NBC)\n** Kiefer Sutherland – 24 as Jack Bauer (Fox)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Edie Falco – The Sopranos as Carmela Soprano (HBO)'\n** Frances Conroy – Six Feet Under as Ruth Fisher (HBO)\n** Jennifer Garner – Alias as Sydney Bristow (ABC)\n** Marg Helgenberger – CSI: Crime Scene Investigation as Catherine Willows (CBS)\n** Allison Janney – The West Wing as C.
