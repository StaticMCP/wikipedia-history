This is the sixth game from the Rabbids games franchise and it is the first Rabbids game not released on the Nintendo Wii.

Once it worked, the invasion begins and the player must complete many minigames to contain the rabbids before it's too late.\nReception\n| 4P = 75%\n| GI = 5/10\n| Gamekult = 4/10\n| GMaster = 75%\n| GSpot = 4/10\n| GTM = 6/10\n| IGN = 3/10\n| JXV = 8/20\n| OXM = 5.5/10\n| PALGN = 6.5/10\n| rev1 = Common Sense Media\n| rev1Score =\n| rev2 = Digital Spy\n| rev2Score =\n}}\nRabbids: Alive & Kicking received \"mixed\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Mitch Dyer of IGN criticized the game for the gameplay but not for the controllers: \"Imprecise controls ruin the uncomplicated games. It started out unfulfilling and didn't get much better. It's the kind of mindless thing I'd load up on my phone for five minute bursts.\" However, GameSpot criticized the \"weak visuals\" and \"tedious navigation.\"\nCommon Sense Media gave the game three stars out of five, saying, \"Rabbids: Alive & Kicking isn't as good as it could have been. The games are often fun and inventive -- we particularly liked one that involved moving to different areas of our play space and calling out for a blind rabbid to walk towards us, luring him into stepping on tacks, slipping on an oil slack, and walking into a live wire -- but there are a few that are just plain confusing and left us scratching our heads.\" Digital Spy gave it a similar score of three stars out of five, saying that it \"Features more highlights than low points, which makes it a worthy mini-game compilation for those looking to party with Kinect.\" However, Metro gave it a score of two out of ten, saying, \"Thank goodness Rayman is back because his would-be usurpers have never seemed more inanely un-entertaining than in this vapid mini-game collection.\"\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
