Its foundation was announced in the journal Speculum:\nThe centre had originated in a Medieval Club that met at Hart House. It was inspired by the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies (PIMS), which had been founded in 1929 by Étienne Gilson. In turn, it was one of the inspirations for the University of Leeds Graduate Centre for Medieval Studies.\nThe Centre's logo was designed by Allan Fleming, while he was head of graphic design at University of Toronto Press, from 1968–1976.\nThe Centre is now located in the Lillian Massey Building, part of Victoria University, Toronto.\nReferences"
