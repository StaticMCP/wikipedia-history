It is written by group member Delroy Rennalls with Rainer Gaffrey, who produced it with Kai Matthiesen. It was also the group's seventh released single and the follow-up to their highly successful \"Coco Jamboo\". \"I Give You My Heart\" was a top-10 hit in the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Hungary and Switzerland. It was certified gold in Germany and the accompanying music video featured the group performing the song in a movie theater in Vienna.\nChart performance\n\"I Give You My Heart\" was quite successful on the charts across Europe. Although it didn't reach the same level of success as \"Coco Jamboo\", it became a top-10 hit in Czech Republic (8), Finland (9), Germany (7), Hungary (5) and Switzerland (6). In Germany, it peaked at number seven for two weeks. It spent 5 weeks inside the top 10 and 17 weeks in total on the German Singles Chart. Additionally, the single was a top-20 hit in Austria, Denmark and Norway, while on the Eurochart Hot 100, it peaked at number 25 in September 1996, after 4 weeks on the chart. It charted also in the United Kingdom, where it reached number 52 on the UK Singles Chart in its first week on the chart. \"I Give You My Heart\" was awarded with a gold record in Germany, after 250,000 singles were sold there.\nCritical reception\nBritish magazine Music Week gave \"I Give You My Heart\" three out of five, writing, \"Totally uncool, but this is one of those infectious Europop anthems where no sonic trick is left unexploited. A fun outing which should follow 'Coco Jamboo' into the charts.\"\nMusic video\nThe accompanying music video for \"I Give You My Heart\" was directed by John Buche & Florian Kehrer. It was released alongside the single and features the band's lineup singing at the Filmcasino theatre in Vienna, Austria, while different people watch a silent movie. Buche had previously directed the music video for \"Coco Jamboo\".\nTrack listings\n* CD maxi - Europe (1996)\n# \"I Give You My Heart\" (Radio Edit) - 3:37\n# \"I Give You My Heart\" (Extended Edit)\t- 5:43\n# \"I Give You My Heart\" (Robin Masters' Club Mix) - 5:08\n# \"I Give You My Heart\" (Steven Edwards' Kick Drum Mix) - 5:21\n# \"I Give You My Heart\" (Video Version)\t- 3:51\n# \"I Give You My Heart\" (Candy Stations President Mix) - 5:16\nCharts and certifications\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1996)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|Czech Republic (IFPI CR)\n|align=\"center\"|8\n|-\n|Denmark (IFPI)\n|align=\"center\"|20\n|-\n|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100)\n|align=\"center\"|25\n|-\n|Finland (Suomen virallinen lista)\n|align=\"center\"|9\n|-\n|Germany (GfK)\n|align=\"center\"|7\n|-\n|Hungary (Mahasz)\n|align=\"center\"|5\n|-\n|Netherlands (Dutch Top 40 Tipparade)\n|align=\"center\"|13\n|-\n|Netherlands (Dutch Single Tip)\n|align=\"center\"|14\n|-\n|-\n|Scotland (OCC)\n|align=\"center\"|33\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|UK Singles (OCC)\n|align=\"center\"|52\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1996)\n!Position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Germany (Media Control)\n|align=\"center\"|43\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Switzerland (Schweizer Hitparade)\n|align=\"center\"|55\n|}\nSales and certifications\nReferences"
