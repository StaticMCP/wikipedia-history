He was originally from St Louis.\nPlaying record\nHis significant championships were the 1926 French National men's doubles championship, where he and Vincent Richards beat Henri Cochet and Jacques Brugnon (a pairing who went on to win three other French National doubles titles) in the final, and the 1924 U.S. National men's doubles championship with his brother Robert Kinsey.\nBill Tilden wrote of the pair that he had \"seldom seen a team work together more smoothly than the Kinseys.\"  In 1926, he reached the Wimbledon final, losing to Jean Borotra.\nKinsey was ranked world No. 7 in 1924 by A. Wallis Myers in his amateur rankings for The Daily Telegraph. As a pro, American Lawn Tennis Magazine ranked Kinsey as world No. 6 in 1930.\nLater in 1926, he was one of the early players signed by the promoter Charles C. Pyle to play in his professional tennis league. After a split with Pyle, he joined Richards in forming an association of professional tennis players.\nIn 1936, he and Helen Wills Moody volleyed a tennis ball back and forth 2,001 times without missing. The feat took them 1 hour and 18 minutes. They only stopped the exchange so that Kinsey could go teach a lesson that he had scheduled.\nKinsey is a member of the USTA Northern California Hall of Fame.\nGrand Slam finals\nSingles: (1 runner-up)\n{| class='sortable wikitable'\n!Result\n!Year\n!style=\"width:190px\"|Championship\n!Surface\n!style=\"width:135px\"|Opponent\n!style=\"width:100px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score\n|-\n| style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|Loss  || 1926 || style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Wimbledon || Grass ||   Jean Borotra || 6–8, 1–6, 3–6\n|}\nDoubles: (2 titles, 1 runner-up)\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n!Result\n!Year\n!style=\"width:190px\"|Championship\n!Surface\n!style=\"width:135px\"|Partner\n!style=\"width:135px\"|Opponents\n!style=\"width:155px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score\n|-\n| style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win || 1924 || style=\"background:#ccf;\"|U.S. National Championships || Grass ||  Robert Kinsey ||  Pat O'Hara Wood   Gerald Patterson || 7–5, 5–7, 7–9, 6–3, 6–4\n|-\n| style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win || 1926 || style=\"background:#ebc2af;\"|French Championships || Clay ||  Vincent Richards ||  Jacques Brugnon   Henri Cochet || 6–4, 6–1, 4–6, 6–4\n|-\n| style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|Loss || 1926 || style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Wimbledon || Grass ||  Vincent Richards ||  Jacques Brugnon   Henri Cochet || 5–7, 6–4, 3–6, 2–6\n|}\nMixed doubles (1 runner-up)\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n!Result\n!Year\n!style=\"width:190px\"|Championship\n!Surface\n!style=\"width:135px\"|Partner\n!style=\"width:135px\"|Opponents\n!style=\"width:80px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score\n|-\n| style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|Loss || 1926 || style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Wimbledon || Grass ||  Mary Browne ||  Kitty McKane   Leslie Godfree || 3–6, 4–6\n|}\nSee also\n* Professional Tennis Championships\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
