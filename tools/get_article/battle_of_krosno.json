Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth forces under the command of Gabriel Wojniłłowicz defeated the Swedish forces, supported by their Polish allies under Colonel Aleksander Pracki. The battle was regarded as a symbol of Polish resistance to the Swedes, as it was first Polish victory since the Swedish invasion in the Summer of 1655.\nIn November 1655, when Swedish forces reached Krosno, the town opened its gates to them. The sejmik of the Przemysl Land, which convened here, pledged allegiance to Charles Gustav. Soon afterwards, however, the residents of Krosno turned against the Swedes, who looted, plundered, murdered people and burned houses. Organized by Colonel Gabriel Wojniłłowicz, they renounced their pledge and attacked the Swedish garrison, together with their Polish allies. The surprised Swedes lost the battle, and the Poles recaptured the town. The people who had pledged allegiance to Charles, together with Pracki, were hanged in the market square, while Wojniłłowicz with his unit headed towards Biecz and Nowy Sącz.\nReferences\n*Andrzej Borcz; Działania wojenne na terenie ziemi przemyskiej i sanockiej w latach \"potopu\" 1655-1657, Przemyśl 1999 r.,\n*Marian Ziobro, Krosno i okolice, Rzeszów 1986 r.\n*Samuel Grądzki, Historia belli Cosacco-Polonici, wyd.
