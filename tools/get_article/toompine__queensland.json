The name is believed to derive from the Aboriginal name Thaumpine, meaning leech.\nToompine Provisional School opened in 1900. In 1901, it became a half-time school in conjunction with Duck Creek Provisional School (meaning they shared a single teacher between the two schools). The school closed in July 1902.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Toompine nor nearby. Options are distance education and boarding school.\nAmenities\nThe town has a pub, a town hall, a recreation facility, a tennis court and a playground.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
