In 1976 the Estates had approved a referendum on the island's status. Voters were given the choice of independence or remaining in the Netherlands Antilles, with over 95% voting in favour of the former. In 1983 the Treaty of The Hague planned independence for Aruba by 1996, and the island seceded from the Netherlands Antilles in 1986. However, in 1994 the plan for full independence was scrapped.\nResults\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:right\n!Choice\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n|align=left|Independence||21,418||95.17\n|-\n|align=left|Remaining in the Netherlands Antilles||1,085||4.83\n|-\n|align=left|Invalid/blank votes||3,669||–\n|-\n|align=left|Total||26,172||100\n|-\n|align=left|Registered voters/turnout||37,346||70.08\n|-\n|align=left colspan=3|Source: [http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&id=aw011977 Direct Democracy]\n|}\nReferences"
