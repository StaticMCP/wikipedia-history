Apart from directly replacing men on active service, many were new positions arising through the exigencies of war – production of war materiel'', transcribing enemy communications, plotting ship and aircraft sightings, and so on, as well as the more traditional roles of nursing.\nThe policy of restricting female workers to homeland duties was relaxed as the war dragged on.\nIt also deals with changed modes of relaxation, as the cities became the province of young females: beach-going and dancing in particular – often, during the war with Japan, accompanied by well-dressed, well-paid and handsome American servicemen.\nThe interviewees' words are punctuated by contemporary film clips, including much privately owned, previously unreleased, footage contributed by the Cottee family. Assoc. Professor Melanie Oppenheimer and Dr Hera Cook served as historical consultants.\nHome media\nThe ABC published the film on DVD (Region 4, 16:9 format, CC, 70 mins).\nReviews\n\"''Girls' Own War Stories'' is a lively and engaging documentary and the women whose stories it tells are witty, articulate and reflective. The film could be well utilised in Humanities (History) and in any units focusing on gender roles, Australian cultural identity, war and social change. It would be appropriate for all levels of secondary school, particularly middle to senior.\"\nReferences"
