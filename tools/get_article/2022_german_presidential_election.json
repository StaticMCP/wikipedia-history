Therefore, the next Federal Convention could not convene later than 16 February 2022. The Bundestag's Council of Elders scheduled the 17th Federal Convention for 13 February 2022. If Steinmeier's term had ended prematurely, the Federal Convention would have met no later than thirty days after the start of the vacancy and the President of the Bundesrat would have become acting president in the interim.\nComposition of the Federal Convention\nThe Federal Convention consists of all the members of the current Bundestag (736 members) and an equal number of state electors, allocated to the sixteen states of Germany in proportion to their population. The state electors are elected by the state parliaments.\nThe composition of the Federal Convention:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n!Party\n!Bundestag members\n!State electors\n!Total electors\n!Percentage\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |SPD\n|206\n|185\n|391\n|26.56%\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |CDU\n|152\n|199\n|351\n|23.84%\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Grüne\n|118\n|115\n|233\n|15.83%\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |FDP\n|92\n|62\n|154\n|10.46%\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |AfD\n|80\n|72\n|152\n|10.33%\n|-\n|align=\"left\" |CSU\n|45\n|49\n|94\n|6.39%\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Die Linke\n|39\n|32\n|71\n|4.82%\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |FW\n|0\n|18\n|18\n|1.22%\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |SSW\n|1\n|1\n|2\n|0.14%\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |LKR\n|0\n|1\n|1\n|0.07%\n|-\n|align=\"left\" |Other\n|3\n|2\n|5\n|0.34%\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Total\n|736\n|736\n|1472\n|100%\n|}\nAs is common for the state-nominated delegates of the constitutional convention, a number of non-politicians - some of them celebrities - are nominated by various parties. During the 17th Federal Convention, virologists Sandra Ciesek and Christian Drosten are both among the members as is infectious disease specialist Marylyn Addo, all of whom came to broader public prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Baden-Württemberg, the SPD and FDP (both in opposition at the state level) agreed to nominate a joint list with 13 members proposed by the SPD and 12 by the FDP.\nCandidates\nEvery member of the Federal Convention (members of the Bundestag and state electors, once they are elected by their respective state parliament) can propose candidates for the presidency. It is required that the President be a German citizen and at least 40 years old. Every candidate has to declare their consent to running. Candidates can be proposed before the Federal Convention and (theoretically) during the convention before every ballot. If the president-elect is a member of a legislature or a government at the federal or state level, they have to resign from that office before the start of their term. A sitting president is not allowed to run for a third consecutive term.\nDeclared candidates\n*Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD), President of Germany (since 2017), former Vice Chancellor of Germany (2007–2009), former Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs (2005–2009 and 2013–2017), was constitutionally eligible for reelection; on 28 May 2021 he declared his candidacy for a second term. The leaders of SPD, Alliance 90/The Greens, FDP, CDU/CSU and SSW all expressed their support for Steinmeier.\n*Gerhard Trabert (independent, nominated by The Left), professor of social medicine and social psychiatry at the RheinMain University of Applied Sciences since 2009. He did not receive any endorsement other than that of The Left.\n*Max Otte (CDU, nominated by AfD), economist, publicist, political activist, and former professor of quantitative and qualitative business analysis and diagnosis at the University of Graz (2011–2016). He did not receive any endorsement other than that of AfD. In reaction to Otte accepting the nomination, the CDU suspended his party membership. On 3 August 2022, some five months after the election, Otte was formally expelled from the CDU as a direct result of Otte accepting the nomination.\n*Stefanie Gebauer (FW), astrophysicist and chairwoman of Kremmen city council. She did not receive any endorsement other than that of FW and BVB/FW.\nFile:Max Otte 16-10-22-01 cropped.jpg|\nFile:German Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier in Helsinki 8.4.2022 (51990305801).jpg|\nFile:Vorstellung von Gerhard Trabert, Kandidat zur Wahl des Bundespräsidenten - 51814847538 (cropped).jpg|Gerhard Trabertfrom Rhineland-Palatinate\nNone of the candidates were members of the Federal Convention themselves.\nResults\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:right\n|+Results\n!colspan=2 rowspan=2|Candidate\n!rowspan=2|Party\n!rowspan=2|Supporting party\n!colspan=2|First\n|-\n!Votes!!%\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#FF0000\"| ||align=left|||align=left|SPD|| align=\"left\" |SPD, CDU, CSU, Alliance 90/The Greens, FDP and SSW||1,045||78.04\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#000000\"| ||align=left|Max Otte||align=left|CDU || align=\"left\" |AfD||140||10.45\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#BEBEBE\"| ||align=left|Gerhard Trabert||align=left|Independent||align=left|The Left||96||7.17\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#F5BD1F\"| ||align=left|Stefanie Gebauer||align=left|Free Voters|| align=\"left\" |Free Voters and BVB/FW||58||4.33\n|-\n|colspan=6|\n|-\n|colspan=4 align=left|Valid votes|| 1,339|| 99.11\n|-\n|colspan=4 align=left|Invalid votes|| 12|| 0.89\n|-\n|colspan=4 align=left|Total|| 1,437|| 100\n|-\n|colspan=4 align=left|Abstentions|| 86|| 5.84\n|-\n|colspan=4 align=left|Abstents|| 35|| 2.38\n|-\n|colspan=4 align=left|Eligible voters/Turnout||1,472||91.78\n|}\nNotes\nReferences"
