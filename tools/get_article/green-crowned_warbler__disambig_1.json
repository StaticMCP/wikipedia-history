It was formerly included in the \"Old World warbler\" assemblage.\nIt is found in the Indian subcontinent, ranging across Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Pakistan. A single sighting was recorded from Sigiriya, Sri Lanka in 1993. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests.\nThe green-crowned warbler was previously placed in the genus Seicercus. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2018 found that neither Phylloscopus nor Seicercus were monophyletic. In the subsequent reorganization the two genera were merged into Phylloscopus which has priority under the rules of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Green-Crowned Warbler\n\n#REDIRECT Green-crowned warbler"
