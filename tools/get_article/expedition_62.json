The expedition consisted of Russian commander Oleg Skripochka, as well as American flight engineers Jessica Meir and Andrew Morgan. The second part of Expedition 62 was made up of the three crew members from Soyuz MS-16.\nCrew\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Position\n!First part(6February9April 2020)\n!Second part(917April 2020)\n|-\n!Commander\n|colspan=2 align=center | Oleg Skripochka, RSAThird and last spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight engineer\n|colspan=2 align=center | Jessica Meir, NASAFirst spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight engineer\n|colspan=2 align=center | Andrew Morgan, NASAFirst spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight engineer\n|align=center style=\"background:grey; color:white;\" |Off station\n|align=center | Anatoli Ivanishin, RSAThird and last spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight engineer\n|align=center style=\"background:grey; color:white;\" |Off station\n|align=center | Ivan Vagner, RSAFirst spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight engineer\n|align=center style=\"background:grey; color:white;\" |Off station\n|align=center | Christopher Cassidy, NASAThird and last spaceflight\n|}\nCrew notes\nSoyuz MS-16 was originally meant to transport the Expedition 63/64 crew to the ISS, carrying Tikhonov, Babkin and Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide to the ISS. On 31 October 2019 it was announced that NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy would fly the mission instead of Hoshide, in order to make sure an American astronaut was on board the station at all times, in the face of delays with the Commercial Crew Program. These changes also meant that Soyuz MS-16's crew would make up part of Expedition 62. The expedition also marked the first time the Russian segment of the ISS has had three crew members since Expedition 50 and was one of the shortest expeditions in the program at just over two months long.\nPatch design notes\nIn February 2019, graphic designer and art director Jessie Bowers (Cypha) designed the Expedition 62 patch. This mission patch is the final ISS expedition insignia that bears the crew's surnames. All succeeding patches have no names in their graphics since the expedition member sizes has expanded to eleven individuals.\nReferences"
