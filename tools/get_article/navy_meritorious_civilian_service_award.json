It is conferred for a contribution that applies to a local or smaller area of operation or a project of lesser importance than would be warranted for consideration for the Navy Distinguished Civilian Service Award or the Navy Superior Civilian Service Award. It is awarded by the local activity head to U.S. Navy employees for service or contributions resulting in high value or benefit to the Department of Navy. The award consists of a certificate and citation signed by the activity head, medal and lapel emblem. The award is the third highest Navy civilian award, ranking just behind the Navy Superior Civilian Service Award, which is itself behind the Navy Distinguished Civilian Service Award.\nEligibility\nAccomplished supervisory or non-supervisory duties in an exemplary manner, setting a record of achievement, and inspiring others to improve the quantity and quality of their work.
