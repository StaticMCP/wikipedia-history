It was originally built for the Denhoff family and in the late 18th century became the property of the Potocki family.\nAfter World War II the building served as the seat of the Ministry of Culture and Art (Ministerstwo Kultury i Sztuki). It now houses the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage (Ministerstwo Kultury i Dziedzictwa Narodowego).\nHistory\nThe original building at the site was burned down by Swedish and Brandenburgian forces during the \"Swedish Deluge\" of the 1650s. A new building was commissioned by Ernest Denhoff, and construction began in 1693 under architect Giovanni Pioli. From 1731 it was the property of August Aleksander Czartoryski.\nUnder the Czartoryski family, the palace underwent several renovations. In 1760 the building façade was refashioned and new alcove outbuildings and two wings facing the street were added, finished with storeyed pavilions with mansard roofs based on plans by Jakub Fontana. Between them a guard-house was erected (1763) with sculptures by Sebastian Zeisl and two gates on each side. The layout is shaped like a horseshoe, with a central part and two side wings. The building was set back from the street by a courtyard, protected by a wrought-iron fence with a gate. The fence was designed in the neorococo style by Leandro Marconi.\nPałac Potockich was torn down in 1944 by the Germans after the collapse of the Warsaw Uprising. It was rebuilt after the war in 1948-1950 according to a design by Jan Zachwatowicz.\nSee also\n* Potocki Palace, Lviv\n* Presidential Palace\nReferences\n::General:\n#\nExternal links\n* [http://um.warszawa.pl/v_syrenka/perelki/index_en.php?mi_id=100&dz_id=12 Potocki Palace]\n*  [http://www.warszawa1939.pl/index.php?r1=krakowskie_15&r3=0 www.warszawa1939.pl]"
