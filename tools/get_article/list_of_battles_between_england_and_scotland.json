They fought typically over land, and the Anglo-Scottish border frequently changed as a result. Prior to the establishment of the two kingdoms, in the 10th and 9th centuries, their predecessors, the Northumbrians, Picts and Dal Riatans, also fought a number of battles. Conflicts predating Anglo-Saxon settlement in Britain such as those between Celtic Britons and Picts are not covered in this article. Major conflicts between the two parties include the Wars of Scottish Independence (1296–1357), and the Rough Wooing (1544–1551), as well as numerous smaller campaigns and individual confrontations. In 1603, England and Scotland were joined in a \"personal union\" when King James VI of Scotland succeeded to the throne of England as King James I. War between the two states largely ceased, although the Wars of the Three Kingdoms in the 17th century, and the Jacobite risings of the 18th century, are sometimes characterised as Anglo-Scottish conflicts.\nThis list is arranged in chronological order.\nBattles between Northumbria and the Picts/Dal Riatans\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!style=\"width:3em\"|Date!!Name!!Notes\n|-\n|596\n|Battle of Raith\n| Battle where the Angles defeated an alliance of Scots, Britons and Picts under King Áedán mac Gabráin of Dál Riata.
