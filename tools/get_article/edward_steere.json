      "text": "# Edward Steere\n\nEdward Steere (1828 - 26 August 1882) was an English Anglican colonial bishop in the 19th century.\nLife\nSteere was educated at London University and ordained in 1850. After curacies in Devon and Lincolnshire, he joined William Tozer (Bishop in Central Africa) on a mission to Nyasaland in 1863. He was appointed Bishop in Central Africa in 1874 and died on 26 August 1882.\nSteere spent several periods in Zanzibar, 1864–68, 1872–74, and 1877–82. In 1873 he placed the foundation stone at Christ Church, Zanzibar, in Stone Town, Zanzibar. The cathedral was based on his vision; its concrete roof shaped in a barrel vault was Steere's idea. He also worked with David Livingstone to abolish slavery in Zanzibar. He is buried behind the altar in the church. David Livingstone's aides James Chuma and Abdullah Susi were part of an expedition led by Steere. Chuma was captain of the expedition and both men acted as interpreters.\nWorks\nSteere was a considerable linguist and published works on several East African languages and dialects, including Shambala, Yao, Nyamwezi, and Makonde. But he is especially known for his work on Swahili, publishing a Handbook of Swahili in 1870, and he also translated or revised the translation into Swahili of a large part of the Bible.\nNotes\nSee also\n* Annie Allen (missionary)\nReferences\n*   Steere was never Bishop of Grahamstown\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=XMgmAQAAIAAJ Robert Marshall Heanley (1898) A Memoir of Edward Steere, D.D., LL.D., Office of the Universities' Mission to Central Africa, London (Google ebook)]\n*\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=7FlKAAAAcAAJ Steere's A Handbook of the Swahili Language as spoken at Zanzibar] original 1870 edition.\n* [https://archive.org/details/handbookswahili00stee Steere's A Handbook of the Swahili Language as spoken at Zanzibar] revised by A.C.
