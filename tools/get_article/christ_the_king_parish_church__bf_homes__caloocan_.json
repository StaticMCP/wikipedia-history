It is under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Novaliches.\nHistory\nThe Christ the King Parish was established on January 7, 1983, by Cardinal-Archbishop Jaime Sin under the Columban Missionaries with John Leydon. Leydon was parish priest for 12 years. On March 12, 1995, the Columban turned over the leadership to the Diocese of Caloocan with the assignment of its first Filipino pastor, Jaime Z. Lara. Then, the Kaybiga and Bagbaguin areas of Caloocan were detached from the parish resulting in the reorganization of the latter.\nThe parish created seven sub-parishes: Sto. Kristo (Barangay Llano), Holy Family (Sunriser Subdivision), Mary Help of Christians (Silanganan Subdivision), St. Joseph the Worker (Dolmar Subdivision), Our Lady of La Naval (BF Homes III Deparo), and St. Martin de Pores (Cefels Subdivision).\nParish priests\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Parish priests\n|-\n!
