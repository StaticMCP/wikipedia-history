The player takes on the role of a researcher assigned to this project. (In reality, the chamber of the terracotta army is the farthest any archaeological team has progressed.) One night, as the researcher is exploring alone, a sudden earthquake opens up the ground underneath, and the researcher tumbles into a deeper part of the tomb. While exploring the tomb, which is immense, he is privy to the observations of the ghost of a Chinese scholar, who was aware of the brutal nature of the emperor and a witness to this brutality.\nThe game eventually leads to a goal the emperor sought in life—an elixir that can confer immortality. Possessing this, the player has a choice: give it to the dead-but-not-quite-gone Qin, who will revive; deliver it to Hal Davis; or pour it into a scale model of the planet. Each has its own result—the renewed emperor will re-take control of China, Hal Davis becomes immortal in a decaying world, or kick-start the renewal of the planet itself, respectively.\nReviews\n| NGen =\n| rev1 = PC Games\n| rev1Score = B\n| rev2 = MacHome Journal\n| rev2Score =\n}}\nA reviewer for Next Generation gave the game one out of five stars, saying that though the game's puzzles are trickier than most Myst clones, requiring the player to read up on Chinese history and mythology, it is still an excessively dull experience.\nThe Computer Game Developers Conference nominated Qin for its 1996 \"Best Prerendered Art\" Spotlight Award, which ultimately went to Zork Nemesis.\nEntertainment Weekly gave the game an A−.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
