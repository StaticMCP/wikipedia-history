In the pre-Christian beliefs of the Germanic people, for example, three Norns send fate up into the universe through a tree. Languages descended from these people include concepts such as \"knock on wood\", \"touch wood\" or \"three times wood\", although only the first two expressions are in the descended English language specifically. Meanwhile, the ancient Celtic peoples also believed that the act of touching wood called on spirits or gods of the trees. Christians tie the practice to the symbolism of the wood of the cross of crucifixion. Folklore researcher Steve Roud suggests that the widespread, modern use however derives from a form of tag called \"Tiggy Touchwood\" in which players are safe from being tagged if they are touching wood.\nSimilar traditions across the world\n* In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro and Serbia there is also the habit of knocking on wood when saying something positive or affirmative about someone or something and not wanting that to change. Frequently the movement of knocking on nearby wood is followed by  /  (\"I will knock on wood\"), or sometimes by  /  (\"I don't want to jinx it\").\n* In Brazil and Portugal,  (\"knock on wood\") is done physically; three knocks are required after giving an example of a bad thing eventually happening. No verbalization is required, just the three knocks on the closest piece or object of wood. In the absence of wood, someone can say , to prevent the bad thing to happen. People do not actually believe knocking three times on a piece of wood will really protect them, but it is a social habit and it is polite to do so to demonstrate that one doesn't want that bad thing one is talking about to actually happen.\n* In Bulgaria the superstition of \"knock on wood\" ( ) is reserved for protection against the evil, and is not typically used for attracting good luck. Usually people engage in the practice in reaction to bad news, actual or merely imagined. In most cases the nearest wooden object is used (in some areas, however, tables are exempt); if there are no such objects within immediate reach, a common tongue-in-cheek practice is to knock on one's head. Knocking on wood is often followed by lightly pulling one's earlobe with the same hand. Common phrases to accompany the ritual are \"God guard us\" ( ) and \"may the Devil not hear\" ( ).\n* In the Czech Republic, the phrase \"I have to knock it down\" () is often said, before knocking on wood, glass, one's own teeth, or occasionally, the forehead.\n* In Denmark the saying is 7, 9, 13 /  (usually accompanied by knocking under a table), as these numbers have traditionally been associated with magic.\n* In Egypt,   (\"hold the wood\") is said when mentioning either good luck one has had in the past or hopes one has for the future. When referring to past good luck the expression is usually used in hopes of the good thing continuing to occur via its spoken acknowledgment, as well as preventing envy.\n* In modern-day England the expression \"touch wood\" is more commonly heard than \"knock on wood\".\n* In Georgia, a   (\"knocking on wood\") is performed when one mentions a bad possibility that could take place in future. Usually the person knocks three times. It is also done when one experiences a bad omen.\n* In Germany, one finds the expressions \"knock on wood\" and \"three times wood\" .\n* In Greece and Cyprus the saying   (\"knock on wood\") is said when hearing someone say something negative in order to prevent it from happening.\n* In Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, when someone is saying bad things, the one that hears it would knock on wood (or other suitable surface) and knock on their forehead while saying  or  (Indonesia),  or  (Malaysia).\n* In Iran,  when one says something good about something or somebody, they might knock on wood and say   (\"[I] am knocking on wood to prevent [them]/it from being jinxed\"). The evil eye and the concept of being jinxed are common phobias and superstitious beliefs in Iranian culture, and Iranians traditionally believe knocking on wood wards off evil spirits.\n* In Italy,  (\"touch iron\") is used, especially after seeing an undertaker or something related to death.\n* In Catalonia,  (\"to touch iron\") is used, meaning protecting yourself against bad luck.\n* In Latin America, it is also tradition to physically knock or touch a wooden object. A variant requires that the object does not have legs (), which rules out chairs, tables and beds. In Argentina men also tap their left testicle, and women grab their left breast.\n* In Lebanon and Syria the saying   (\"knock on [the] wood\") is said when hearing someone say something negative in order to prevent it from happening. It is also largely observed when saying something positive or affirmative about someone or something and not wanting that to change.\n* In the Netherlands, there is a habit of knocking on a(n unpainted) piece of wood, both with and without saying  - literally, \"to (quickly) knock on [something]\".\n* In Norway the saying is  (\"knock on the table\").\n* In Poland, there is a habit of knocking on (unpainted) wood (which may be preceded by saying ; or simply ; – literally meaning \"to knock on unpainted wood\") when saying something negative – to prevent it from happening – or, more rarely, something positive – in order not to \"spoil it\". In the Czech Republic, this is often accompanied for stronger effect by knocking on one's teeth, a piece of building stone, or metal, reasoning that these (as opposed to wood) survive even fire.\n* In Romania, there is also a superstition that one can avoid bad things aforementioned by literally knocking on wood (). Wood tables are exempted. One of the possible reasons could be that there is a monastery practice to call people to pray by playing / knocking the simantron.\n* In Spain  and in France  (\"to touch wood\") is something that you say when you want your luck or a good situation to continue, e.g.  (\"It's been good all week and, touching wood, the weekend will stay good\").\n* In Sweden, a common expression is \"pepper, pepper, touch wood\" (), referring to throwing pepper over one's shoulder and touching a wooden object.\n* In Turkey, \"\" (\"to knock on wood\") is a physical gesture performed three times in quick succession, in reaction to actual or speculative bad news, as well as when giving and receiving praise, to protect against the evil eye. The knocks are often preceded with a gesture where the performer pulls their earlobe while making a short sound by inhaling through pursed lips. The gesture is usually accompanied by expressions such as \"\" (\"God forbid\", lit. \"may God protect\"), \"\" (from Arabic mashallah, lit. \"god has willed it\") or \"\" (lit. may the evil eye not touch).\n* In the United States in the eighteenth century, men used to knock on the wood stock of their muzzle-loading rifles to settle the black powder charge, ensuring the weapon would fire cleanly.\n* In Russia, Estonia and Ukraine, \"\" (\"to knock on wood\") has the same meaning. There is also an expression \"\" (\"Tfu Tfu Tfu\") phrase to represent the sound of spitting, similar with Assam in Northeast India. The difference, however, is that the person would have to \"spit\" with his head turned to the left shoulder which represents \"spitting away\" bad fortune because it is situated on the left (unstable) side of life.\nSee also\n* Alomancy, related to throwing salt over the left shoulder\n* Crossed fingers\n* Evil eye\n* Jinx\nReferences"
