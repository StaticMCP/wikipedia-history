Following the death of his father, with whom he had previously assisted in teaching, he succeeded him as principal of the Classical and Mathematical School at West Point in 1849.\nKinsley later spent nearly a year traveling in Europe, during which he narrowly escaped drowning after falling overboard while returning home. He experienced several family tragedies, including the deaths of his father and four sisters. Two of his sisters perished in the burning of the Henry Clay on the Hudson River in 1851.\nLater Life and Diplomatic Service\nKinsley struggled with poor health for several years. In 1867, he traveled to Europe once more, visiting London, Paris, and Madrid.

Hale, the American Minister to Spain. The ceremony was performed by the chaplain of the British Embassy.\nFollowing their marriage, the couple spent nine months traveling through Spain, Switzerland, Belgium, and France before returning to Madrid. There, Kinsley served as private secretary to the United States Minister and later as Acting Secretary of Legation for several months.\nIn 1869, he spent several months in Paris, where his son, John Parker Hale Kinsley, was born on October 2. The child was baptized by Rev. Dr. Robinson of the American Chapel but died shortly thereafter and was buried in the cemetery of Antenie.\nDuring the following winter, Kinsley visited Italy and later traveled through Germany before returning to West Point in June 1870. He was known to attend services at the Chapel of the United States Military Academy.\nDeath\nEdward Van Schoonhoven Kinsley died on April 1, 1888.
