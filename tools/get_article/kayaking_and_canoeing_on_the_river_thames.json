Above Teddington Lock in London the Thames is freshwater, with levels controlled by a series of weirs which are managed by the Environment Agency and can be used for whitewater and playboating by kayakers.\nSee also\n* Artificial whitewater\n* Locks and weirs on the River Thames\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.tvfreestylers.co.uk/ Thames Valley Freestylers weir levels]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071222020246/http://www.whitewaterthecanoecentre.co.uk/shepperton-weir.html Shepperton, the whitewater centre weir levels]\n\n---\n\n## Kayaking and Canoeing on the River Thames\n\n#REDIRECT Kayaking and canoeing on the River Thames"
