National broadcaster ITV was responsible for their participation and organised a national final to select the British entry. Ultimately, Joni Fuller was selected with the song \"How Does It Feel\".\nThe UK was selected to perform fifth in the running order, following the entry from Romania and preceding the entry from Sweden. The United Kingdom finished in fourteenth position with 28 points, which remains the lowest placing ever for the United Kingdom in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest. Following the 2005 contest, ITV withdrew from participation and the UK remained absent until 2022, when the BBC returned to the contest in Yerevan.\nBefore Junior Eurovision\nJunior Eurovision Song Contest 2005: The British Final\nA national final was held by Independent Television (ITV) to select the third Junior Eurovision entry for the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2005.

At the close of the voting Joni has received 28 points, placing 14th of the 16 competing entries, giving the United Kingdom their worst entry at the contest.\nIn the United Kingdom, the show was televised on digital channel ITV2 with commentary by Underwood. The British spokesperson, who announced the British votes during the final, was national finalist Vicky Gordon. A delayed broadcast, consisting of highlights, was aired on ITV1 the following afternoon. The contest was watched by 700,000 viewers on ITV1 (down 63.16% compared with 2004 viewing figures), with 171,000 watching live on ITV2 (down 22.62% compared with 2004).\nITV withdrew from the contest after 2005 due to poor viewing figures, and the termination of the Junior Eurovision contract signed by ITV in 2003. The UK returned to the contest in 2022, with the BBC replacing ITV as the country's broadcaster.\nVoting\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ Points awarded to the United Kingdom\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"20%\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" | Country\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 12 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 10 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 8 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 7 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 6 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 5 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 4 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2 points\n| ||}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1 point\n| |}}\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ Points awarded by the United Kingdom\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"20%\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" | Country\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:gold\" | 12 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:silver\" | 10 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#CC9966\" | 8 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 7 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 6 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 5 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 4 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1 point\n|\n|}\nNotes\nReferences"
