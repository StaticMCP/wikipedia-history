It involved an uprising and terrorist actions against the central power of the Shogunate in favour of the sonnō jōi (\"Revere the emperor, expel the barbarians\") movement.\nOutline\nA shogunal pacification force was sent to Mount Tsukuba on 17 June 1864, consisting of 700 Mito soldiers led by Ichikawa, with 3 to 5 cannons and at least 200 firearms, as well as a Tokugawa shogunate force of 3,000 men with over 600 firearms and several cannons.\nAs the conflict escalated, on 10 October 1864 at Nakaminato, the shogunate force of 6,700 was defeated by 2,000 insurgents, and several shogunal defeats followed.\nThe insurgents were weakening, however, dwindling to about 1,000. By December 1864 they faced a new force under Tokugawa Yoshinobu (himself born in Mito) numbering over 10,000, which ultimately forced them to surrender.\nThe uprising resulted in 1,300 dead on the rebels' side, which suffered vicious repression, including 353 executions and approximately 100 who died in captivity.\nOther\n*Mito and Hikone had been hostile since the Sakurada Gate incident in 1860. Mito and Hikone were reconciled by Tsuruga, the death place of Tengutō members, after 110 years of the incident.\n*Nuclear dense zones of Japan are concentrated near Mito and near Tsuruga, these two places are related by the Tengutō rebellion. Especially, Jōyō (Ōarai, a neighbor of Mito) and Monju (Tsuruga) are two sodium-cooled fast reactors in Japan.\nSee also\n*Mito Domain\n*Shinpūren rebellion\nNotes\nReferences\n* Totman, Conrad.
