      "text": "# The Kingsmen Volume 3\n\n}}\nThe Kingsmen Volume 3 is the third album by the rock band the Kingsmen, released in 1965.\nRelease and reception\n}}\nThe Kingsmen's third album featured \"The Jolly Green Giant\", a novelty number which reached #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart and #25 on the Billboard R&B chart, along with several other R&B classics and a couple of Wailers covers.  As with previous albums, crowd noise overdubs were added on some tracks to simulate a live performance.  The album sold well due to the success of \"The Jolly Green Giant\", the group's frenetic touring schedule, and the ongoing controversy over the lyrics of \"Louie Louie\".  It entered the Billboard Top LPs chart on February 20, 1965, and remained for 18 weeks, peaking at No. 22.\nThe February 27, 1965 issue of Billboard Magazine reviewed the album:\n:The boys are in the pop music forefront again with their hit single, \"Jolly Green Giant.\" This their third album contains the gutsy, earthy delivery that has marked their past hits (\"Louie Louie\") and the new single. To add to the excitement, Wand has dubbed in audience crowd noises.\nThe LP was released in the U.S. in mono (WDM 662) and stereo (WDS 662) versions, and also released in Canada (Reo 676) and Taiwan (First FL-1305, orange vinyl, titled Hello! The Kingsmen). The album was not released in the UK. In 1993 Sundazed and Bear Family reissued the album on CD with bonus tracks \"Since You Been Gone\", \"It's Only The Dog\" and \"The Wolf Of Manhattan\", and without crowd noise overdubs.  The CD also moved \"The Jolly Green Giant\" from track 1 to track 3.\nEarly LP pressings omitted bassist Norm Sundholm from the sleeve notes.  The title on the labels was \"Vol. III\" vs. \"Volume 3\" elsewhere.  The Canadian release had a yellow sticker at the top of the cover with \"Featuring Jolly Green Giant\", the Kingsmen single that reached #1 on the Canadian charts.\nTrack listing\n# Over You &ndash; 2:05 (Lynn Easton)\n# That's Cool, That's Trash &ndash; 2:12 (P.F.
