It is responsible for protecting, preserving and promoting the built, natural and cultural heritage of the Canadian province of Ontario. The Trusts headquarters are housed in the Ontario Heritage Centre, also known as the Birkbeck Building, itself a designated heritage building and National Historic Site.\nHistory\nThe trust traces its origins to the Archaeological and Historic Sites Board during the 1950s. It was incorporated into the Ontario Heritage Foundation in 1967 by the Ontario legislature. Its name was changed to the Ontario Heritage Trust in 2005 by an amendment to the Ontario Heritage Act.\nProvincial Plaque Program\n]]\nThe Trust administers the Provincial Plaque Program, which began in 1955. Since the installation of the first plaque at Port Carling, it has erected 1,287 blue-and-gold plaques, the vast majority of which are found across Ontario, but also in France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States.\nIn 2018, the Trust began reviewing its plaques for 'outdated interpretations and terminology', with plaques such as the Shingwauk Hall Residential Schools plaque in Sault Ste. Marie being replaced after it was vandalized in 2021.\nOntario Sports Awards\nIn 1965 the Ontario Heritage Trust began honouring sports achievements, with the Ontario Sport Awards Program being formally established in 1975.\nOntario Heritage Trust buildings\nSome of the properties managed in whole or in part by the Trust include:\n* Ashbridge Estate\n* Barnum House\n* Birkbeck Building\n* Canada Southern Railway Station\n* Duff Baby House\n* Elgin and Winter Garden Theatres\n* Enoch Turner School\n* Fulford Place\n* George Brown House\n* Josiah Henson Museum\n* Niagara Apothecary\n* Museum of Northern History\n* Wolford Chapel (in Devon, England)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
