The game was first released in 2023, with a second edition launched on November 29, 2024. It is designed for 2 to 4 players aged 6 and above, with an average playtime of 20–30 minutes. The game features uniquely shaped wooden blocks, challenging players to build a tower without causing it to collapse.\nGameplay\nIn Misfits, players take turns stacking uniquely shaped blocks, aiming to build a stable tower. If a player causes blocks to fall during their turn, they must collect the fallen pieces and add them back to their hand. The game features 40 different shapes, including triangles, cubes, and cylinders. The goal is to be the first to stack all their pieces without toppling the structure.\nDevelopment and release\nMisfits was developed by Alexander Neumann as a university project at University of the Arts London. It was first released in 2023 with the First Edition. The second edition, launched on November 29, 2024, expanded availability to independent game shops, gift stores, and board game cafes. Tom Vasel of The Dice Tower commented on the game, stating, \"While it's a well-produced quality version, I like it but wouldn't recommend it.\"\nReception\nThe Telegraph described the game as \"Best described, at the risk of trademark infringement, as 'Jenga for lunatics'\" and noted it \"will chiefly appeal to those who delight in teetering tension and noisy destruction.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
