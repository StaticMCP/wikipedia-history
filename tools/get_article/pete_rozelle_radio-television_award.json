      "text": "# Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award\n\nThe Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award, created in 1989 and named for the late longtime NFL commissioner, Pete Rozelle, is bestowed annually by the Pro Football Hall of Fame \"for longtime exceptional contributions to radio and television in professional football\".  In contrast to similar awards given by other American professional sports leagues, the Rozelle Award has occasionally been granted to broadcast executives and production people in addition to on-air personalities. Also, some award winners have gone on to be inducted by the hall at a later date.\nRozelle Award recipients\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Year\n!scope=\"col\"|Honoree\n!scope=\"col\"|Primary affiliation(s)\n|-\n| 1989 || Bill MacPhail || Executive: CBS\n|-\n| 1990 || Lindsey Nelson || Play-by-play: CBS\n|-\n| 1991 || Ed Sabol || Founder and executive: NFL Films\n|-\n| 1992 || Chris Schenkel || Play-by-play: DuMont, CBS, NBC\n|-\n| 1993 || Curt Gowdy || Play-by-play: NBC, CBS\n|-\n| 1994 || Pat Summerall || Color commentator and play-by-play: CBS, Fox\n|-\n| 1995 || Frank Gifford || Color commentator and play-by-play: CBS, ABC\n|-\n| 1996 || Jack Buck || Play-by-play: CBS, NBC, CBS Radio\n|-\n| 1997 || Charlie Jones || Play-by-play: ABC, NBC\n|-\n| 1998 || Val Pinchbeck || NFL broadcast official\n|-\n| 1999 || Dick Enberg || Play-by-play: NBC, CBS\n|-\n| 2000 || Ray Scott || Play-by-play: DuMont, CBS\n|-\n| 2001 || Roone Arledge || Executive: ABC\n|-\n| 2002 || John Madden || Color commentator: CBS, Fox, ABC, NBC\n|-\n| 2003 || Don Criqui || Play-by-play: CBS, NBC\n|-\n| 2004 || Van Miller || Play-by-play: Buffalo Bills\n|-\n| 2005 || Myron Cope || Color commentator: Pittsburgh Steelers\n|-\n| 2006 || Lesley Visser ||  Reporter: CBS, ABC\n|-\n| 2007 || Don Meredith || Color commentator: ABC, NBC\n|-\n| 2008 || Dan Dierdorf || Color commentator: CBS, ABC\n|-\n| 2009 || Irv Cross || Color commentator and studio analyst: CBS\n|-\n| 2010 || Chris Berman || Studio host: ESPN\n|-\n| 2011 || Jim Nantz || Studio host and play-by-play: CBS Radio, CBS\n|-\n| 2012 || Len Dawson || Studio host and color commentator: HBO, NBC, Kansas City Chiefs\n|-\n| 2013 || Al Michaels || Play-by-play: ABC, NBC, Amazon Prime\n|-\n| 2014 || Bob Trumpy || Color commentator: NBC, Westwood One\n|-\n| 2015 || Tom Jackson || Studio analyst: ESPN\n|-\n| 2016 || James Brown || Studio host and play-by-play: CBS, Fox\n|-\n| 2017 || David Hill || Executive: Fox\n|-\n| 2018 || Andrea Kremer || Reporter: NFL Films, ESPN, NBC, NFL Network, Amazon Prime\n|-\n| 2019 || Dick Ebersol || Executive: NBC\n|-\n| 2020 || Joe Buck || Play-by-play: Fox, ESPN\n|-\n| 2021 || John Facenda || Broadcaster and narrator: NFL Films\n|-\n| 2022 || Howard Katz || Executive: ABC, ESPN, NFL Films\n|-\n| 2023 || Fred Gaudelli || Producer: ABC, NBC, Amazon Prime\n|-\n| 2024 || Merrill Reese || Play-by-play: Philadelphia Eagles\n|-\n| 2025 || Brent Musburger || Play-by-play, studio: CBS, ABC\n|}\nReferences\nSee also\n*List of current National Football League broadcasters\n*Curt Gowdy Media Award - the NBA's comparable award\n*Ford C.
