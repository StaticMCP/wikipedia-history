The museum's exhibits include Native American arrowhead and artifacts, clothing, household items, antiques and decorative items, tools, and historic photographs.\nElroy M. Avery's personal collection of over 1,000 books was used to help establish the Avery Library and Historical Society on April 10, 1920 (which became the New Port Richey Public Library and West Pasco Historical Society Museum and Library).\nThe West Pasco Historical Society was formed in 1973. In 1974-75 the organization published a hardcover history, ''West Pasco's Heritage''. The building which houses the organization originally served as the Seven Springs schoolhouse from about 1915 to 1925. In 1981 it was moved to Sims Park and was dedicated as the home of the historical society in 1983. The library wing was added in 1992. In 2011, the museum was renamed the Rao Musunuru, M. D., Museum and Library, to honor a major donor to the project of remodeling the building.\nAccessibility\nThis museum is handicapped accessible.\nOperating Hours\nThe museum is open Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, from 1 to 4 p.m.\nSee also\n* List of historical societies in Florida\nFootnotes\nExternal links\n*[http://westpascomuseum.org/ West Pasco Historical Society]"
