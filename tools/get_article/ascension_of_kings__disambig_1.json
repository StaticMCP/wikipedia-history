While not being a concept album, the album includes a three part suite entitled ‘Clanaan Chronicles’ which will is planned to run and occur on the band's subsequent albums. It follows a story by keyboard player Darrel Treece-Birch in the vein of The Chronicles of Narnia and The Lord of the Rings which sees the rescue/redemption of a tortured realm from an evil dictator by a Seventh Rider who ultimately ascends to be a prophesied King.\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Nth Ascension.\n# Fourth Kingdom - 6:21\n# Return Of The King - 9:06\n# Strange Dreams - 7:24\n# Overture (Clanaan Part 1) - 6:08\n# Realm With A Soul (Clanaan Part 2) - 3:51\n# Seventh Rider (Clanaan Part 3) - 4:00\n# Weight Of The World - 6:43\n# Vision - 18:44\nPersonnel\n* Alan \"Spud\" Taylor - Vocals\n* Martin Walker - Guitars\n* Gavin Walker - Bass Guitar\n* Darrel Treece-Birch - Keyboards\n* Craig Walker - Drums and Percussion\nProduction\n* Recorded at Berlin Studios Blackpool for Drums in 2013, and at RW Studios in Rossall and at The War Room studio in Cleveleys from November 2013 to March 2014.\n* Engineered by Phil Brown and mixed by Martin Walker and Nth Ascension * Mastered at Digital Audio in Skipton, UK\n* Vocals Recorded at DogHouse Studio in Blackpool by Gary Hughes of Ten\n* Backing Vocals by Gary Hughes of Ten\nTrivia\nThe track entitled Strange Dreams has a ‘Matrix’ type theme to the lyric, while the track Vision recounts the story of Moses vs Rameses from the perspective of a slave.
