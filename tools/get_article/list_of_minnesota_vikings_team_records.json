      "text": "# List of Minnesota Vikings team records\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings is an American football franchise based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The team was established in 1961 and is part of the National Football League's NFC North division. Since then, the team has taken part in the NFL playoffs 31 times, reaching four Super Bowls in 1970, 1974, 1975 and 1977.\nThis list encompasses the major records set by the team, its coaches and its players. The players section of this page lists the individual records for passing, rushing and receiving, as well as selected defensive records. The team has had three full-time home stadiums since its establishment – Metropolitan Stadium, Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, and U.S. Bank Stadium; attendance records, both home and away, are included on this page.\nAll-time series\nThe Vikings have played against every other team in the NFL at least five times each in the regular season. They have a winning record against 20 teams, a losing record against 10 and an even record against one: the Cincinnati Bengals, whom they have played 14 times, winning seven each. The Vikings' best record is against the Houston Texans – they have won each of the six meetings between the two teams – and their worst record is against the Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts, whom they have beaten eight times in 26 meetings for a win percentage of .327. Their fewest wins against a specific franchise is three, in seven meetings with the Baltimore Ravens (.429). The Vikings have recorded the most wins in their history against the Detroit Lions (80), as well as the most points (2,690). The Vikings have conceded the most points to the Green Bay Packers (2,802), who are also the team against whom they have suffered the most losses (63) and ties (3).\nIn the postseason, the Vikings have faced 18 different opponents, but they only have a win percentage of .500 or higher against six of them. The Vikings' best postseason win percentage is against the Arizona Cardinals and the Cleveland Browns, whom they have beaten every time they have met – the Cardinals twice and the Browns once; meanwhile, they have faced eight teams without recording a single win, the worst being against the Philadelphia Eagles, whom they have met four times without winning. The Vikings have recorded their most postseason wins against the Los Angeles Rams, whom they have beaten five times in seven meetings, and their most losses against the San Francisco 49ers, to whom they have lost five times in six meetings. The Vikings have also conceded their most postseason points against the 49ers (181), and scored their most against the New Orleans Saints (161). As well as meeting the Rams seven times in the postseason, the Vikings have also met the Dallas Cowboys seven times, recording three wins and four losses.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\" width=\"150px\"|Team\n!width=\"30px\"|W!!width=\"30px\"|L!!width=\"30px\"|T!!width=\"30px\"|Win%!!width=\"100px\"|Points scored!!width=\"100px\"|Points allowed\n!width=\"30px\"|W!!width=\"30px\"|L!!width=\"30px\"|Win%!!width=\"100px\"|Points scored!!width=\"100px\"|Points allowed\n|-\n!colspan=\"6\"|Regular season\n!colspan=\"5\"|Playoffs\n|-\n!Arizona\n|16||12||0||0.571||689||636\n|2||0||1.000||71||35\n|-\n!Atlanta\n|20||11||0||0.645||739||541\n|1||1||0.500||57||54\n|-\n!Baltimore\n|3||4||0||0.429||178||187\n|0||0||—||—||—\n|-\n!Buffalo\n|9||6||0||0.600||353||279\n|0||0||—||—||—\n|-\n!Carolina\n|11||6||0||0.647||343||353\n|0||0||—||—||—\n|-\n!Chicago\n|66||57||2||0.536||2,620||2,399\n|0||1||0.000||18||35\n|-\n!Cincinnati\n|7||8||0||0.467||335||297\n|0||0||—||—||—\n|-\n!Cleveland\n|11||5||0||0.688||417||254\n|1||0||1.000||27||7\n|-\n!Dallas\n|12||15||0||0.444||624||647\n|3||4||0.429||135||123\n|-\n!Denver\n|8||8||0||0.500||352||360\n|0||0||—||—||—\n|-\n!Detroit\n|80||43||2||0.648||2,757||2,373\n|0||0||—||—||—\n|-\n!Green Bay\n|58||65||3||0.472||2,479||2,802\n|1||1||0.500||41||41\n|-\n!Houston\n|6||0||0||1.000||181||98\n|0||0||—||—||—\n|-\n!Indianapolis\n|8||17||1||0.327||538||683\n|0||1||0.000||14||24\n|-\n!Jacksonville\n|6||1||0||0.857||188||134\n|0||0||—||—||—\n|-\n!Kansas City\n|5||8||0||0.385||284||239\n|0||1||0.000||7||23\n|-\n!Las Vegas\n|7||9||0||0.438||317||349\n|0||1||0.000||14||32\n|-\n!LA Chargers\n|8||7||0||0.533||369||358\n|0||0||—||—||—\n|-\n!LA Rams\n|22||16||2||0.575||922||888\n|5||2||0.714||150||150\n|-\n!Miami\n|6||7||0||0.462||277||263\n|0||1||0.000||7||24\n|-\n!New England\n|5||9||0||0.357||287||310\n|0||0||—||—||—\n|-\n!New Orleans\n|21||12||0||0.636||840||657\n|4||1||0.800||161||101\n|-\n!NY Giants\n|18||10||0||0.643||685||499\n|1||3||0.250||57||111\n|-\n!NY Jets\n|5||8||0||0.385||259||306\n|0||0||—||—||—\n|-\n!Philadelphia\n|15||12||0||0.556||639||627\n|0||4||0.000||51||122\n|-\n!Pittsburgh\n|10||8||0||0.556||425||364\n|0||1||0.000||6||16\n|-\n!San Francisco\n|24||20||1||0.544||1000||1009\n|1||5||0.167||104||181\n|-\n!Seattle\n|6||12||0||0.333||417||476\n|0||1||0.000||9||10\n|-\n!Tampa Bay\n|33||24||0||0.600||1,214||1,046\n|0||0||—||—||—\n|-\n!Tennessee\n|9||5||0||0.643||375||235\n|0||0||—||—||—\n|-\n!Washington\n|13||10||0||0.565||577||507\n|2||3||0.400||86||102\n|-\n!Totals\n!528!!435!!11!!0.547!!21,680!!19,982\n!21!!31!!0.404!!1,015!!1,191\n|}\nLast updated: As of end of week 6 of the 2024 NFL season\nTeam records\nFirsts\n*First home game: Chicago Bears 13–37 Minnesota Vikings, September 17, 1961\n*First road game: Minnesota Vikings 7–21 Dallas Cowboys, September 24, 1961\n*First postseason game: Minnesota Vikings 14–24 Baltimore Colts, Divisional Round, December 22, 1968\n*First postseason win: Los Angeles Rams 20–23 Minnesota Vikings, Divisional Round, December 27, 1969\n*First Super Bowl: Minnesota Vikings 7–23 Kansas City Chiefs, Super Bowl IV, January 11, 1970\n*First game at the Hubert H.
