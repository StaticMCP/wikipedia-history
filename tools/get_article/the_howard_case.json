The acting is good though not oustanding.\"\nKine Weekly wrote: \"Unimaginative crime melodrama&nbsp;... The principal players strive hard to make something of the theme, but pedestrian treatment and cramped staging create too many loopholes for their efforts to be measured in terms of arresting entertainment. Quota booking for the unsophisticated.&nbsp;... To be a good crime drama, it is necessary to be slick, and this British effort is anything but that. Slow moving, amateurishly directed, and not too well photographed, it ploughs the obvious course, all too frequently unconscious of a responsibility to entertain. It is, in fact, the sincerity of the principal players that alone creates enough interest to carry the film into the bottom half of the supporting feature category.\"\nPicturegoer wrote: \"Very slow and obvious story, mechanically put over with a minimum of imagination and indifferent technique. Arthur Seaton is quite good in a dual role, and the other artists make the most of the material at their command under somewhat trying circumstances.\"\nThe Daily Film Renter wrote: \"Although there are various changes of scene, the production is played in cramped settings, while the plot is not at all convincing. Nevertheless, there are certain consolations, such as, for instance, the appearance of Olive Melville, an attractive newcomer, who gives a pleasing show as Pat. Arthur Seaton essays the dual roles of Howard and Phillips with as much credibility as his opportunities afford.\"\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Chibnall, Steve.
