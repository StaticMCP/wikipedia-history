It is composed of Royal Marine Commandos and commando qualified personnel from the Royal Navy, British Army and Royal Air Force.\nThe brigade was formed 1 September 1943 at Dorchester with personnel from 102 RM Brigade, during the Second World War, with a mixture of Army Commando and Royal Marine Commando units, and was deployed to the South-East Asian Theatre of World War II to conduct operations against the invading forces of Imperial Japan, such as the Burma Campaign. After the Second World War, the Army Commandos were disbanded and the brigade became a Royal Marine formation. Recently, United Kingdom Commando Force has again become a mixed formation with the addition of commando qualified soldiers from the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers to provide support for the Royal Marine Commandos. Since the end of the Second World War, it has been involved in a number of engagements such as the Suez Crisis, Falklands War, Gulf War and the War in Afghanistan.\nHistory\nSecond World War\nBetween September and November 1943, in Scotland, 102nd Brigade, Royal Marines Division, was detached from the division, to form the independent 3rd Special Service Brigade – a joint British Army-Royal Marines formation. The founding commander was Brigadier Wilfrid Nonweiler and it was composed of the following units:\n* No. 1 Commando (Army);\n* No. 5 Commando (Army);\n* No. 42 Commando (Royal Marines); and\n* No. 44 Commando (Royal Marines).\nNos. 1 and 5 Commandos had already earned battle honours as units in, respectively, the North African and Madagascar campaigns. Because \"Commando\", at the time, implied a company/battalion-sized unit, the name \"Special Service\" was instead used for British commando brigades. (However, the term \"Commando Brigade\" was often used informally, because \"Special Service\" was unpopular and had a superficial similarity to the name of the notorious German Schutzstaffel (SS).) The brigade was later officially renamed 3rd Commando Brigade.\nOn 10 November 1943, elements of the brigade embarked at Gourock, bound for India. It was intended that the brigade would be used in operations against Japanese forces in the South-East Asia theatre, such as the Burma campaign. However, the limited shipping capacity available at the time meant that the relocation was prolonged and the components of the brigade were not reunited until late 1944. Lt&nbsp;Col. Peter Young was transferred from the Normandy campaign to become second-in-command of 3rd Commando Brigade. Young succeeded Nonweiler as commander of the brigade.\nDuring January 1945, the brigade was involved in the campaign to recapture Arakan, including the battles of Myebon peninsula and Kangaw. The brigade was then withdrawn to India to prepare for Operation Zipper, a proposed amphibious operation to recapture the Malayan peninsula. The atomic bombs against Japan precipitated an earlier surrender of Japan than expected. The 3rd Commando Brigade moved to secure Hong Kong – a British crown colony that was under Japanese occupation in 1941–45. During 1946, British Army personnel and units within the 3rd Commando Brigade were demobilised or transferred elsewhere and it became a Royal Marine formation.\nPost Second World War\n3 Commando Brigade's most high-profile operation after the war was the Suez Crisis, when it took part in the amphibious assault against Egyptian targets. During Operation Musketeer, units of the brigade made a helicopter-borne assault.\n1971 saw the withdrawal of British forces from the Far East and Persian Gulf. The brigade returned to the UK with other British units. It moved to Stonehouse Barracks in Plymouth, where it remains to this day.\nOperation Corporate\nThe brigade's next large operation was in 1982. Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands, and 3 Commando Brigade, reinforced by 2 Para and 3 Para, was one of the two main British land formations that took part in operations to recapture the islands (the other was 5th Infantry Brigade). The brigade landed at San Carlos Water and marched across East Falkland to Stanley. Argentine units were defeated in several sharp engagements, and their forces surrendered on 14 June.\nGulf War\nIn the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War, the brigade was deployed on a non-combat task in northern Iraq. The Iraqi Kurds had suffered immensely during the war and in its aftermath, and the brigade was used due to its rapid deployment ability. It provided humanitarian aid to the Kurds and saved many from starvation.\n21st century\narmoured vehicle of 3 Commando Brigade, Royal Marines, on patrol during Operation Fibonacci near Kuh-e Baba and Shin Ghar, Helmand, Afghanistan.]]\nRecently, the brigade has been involved in two major campaigns, including Operation Veritas in Afghanistan, 2001 and 2002, and Operation Telic during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Iraq, however, saw heavy fighting occur in the early stages of the campaign, as the brigade made its first amphibious assault in over 20 years by landing on the Al-Faw peninsula in south-east Iraq. In 2006, the brigade returned to Afghanistan on Operation Herrick, replacing 16 Air Assault Brigade, where intense fighting occurred.\nIn 2022, 3 Commando Brigade was rebranded to the United Kingdom Commando Force (UKCF), a process that started in 2020 and completed in 2024.\nFalklands War order of battle\nThe order of battle was as follows:\nCommander: Brigadier JHA Thompson\n* 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery (Lt Col MJ Holroyd Smith)\n** 7th (Sphinx) Battery Royal Artillery / 105 mm L118 Light Guns x 6 Land Rover 101 Forward Control x 6　Land Rover series IIA x 6\n** 8th (Alma) Battery Royal Artillery / 105 mm L118 Light Guns x 6 Land Rover 101 Forward Control x 6　Land Rover series IIA x 6\n** 79th (Kirkee) Battery Royal Artillery / 105 mm L118 Light Guns x 6 Land Rover 101 Forward Control x 6　Land Rover series IIA x 6\n** 148th (Meiktila) Battery (Primary role is as a Naval Gunfire Support Forward Observation (NGSFO) battery.)\n* 40 Commando, Royal Marines (Lt Col MPJ Hunt) — Blue Beach 1 - Sapper Hill.

The ATG was normally based around specialist amphibious ships, such as the former , the only helicopter carrier in the British fleet until she was decommissioned and sold to Brazil in 2018. Ocean was designed and built to accommodate an embarked commando and its associated stores and equipment. The strategy of the ATG is to wait \"beyond the horizon\" and then deploy swiftly as directed by HM Government. The whole amphibious force is intended to be self-sustaining and capable of operating without host-nation support. The concept was successfully tested in operations in Sierra Leone.\nSince the disposal of both HMS Ocean and, in 2024/25, the Albion class assault ships, British amphibious forces are reliant on deployment from the Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers and from amphibious warfare vessels of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. Aircraft of the Commando Helicopter Force can be accommodated on these vessels.\nCommando Helicopter Force\nThe Commando Helicopter Force (CHF) forms part of the Fleet Air Arm. It comprises three helicopter squadrons and is commanded by Joint Aviation Command (JAC).\nCHF is neither under the permanent control of Headquarters Commando Forces nor that of the Commandant General Royal Marines, but rather is allocated to support Commando units as required by JAC. It uses both Merlin HC4/4A medium-lift and Wildcat AH1 light transport/reconnaissance helicopters to provide aviation support to Commando Forces.\nCommanders\nCommanders have included:\n*1943&ndash;1944 Brigadier Wilfrid Nonweiler\n*1944 Brigadier Peter Young (acting)\n*1944&ndash;1945 Brigadier Campbell Hardy\n*1948&ndash;1951 Brigadier Campbell Hardy\n*1951&ndash;1952 Brigadier Cecil Phillips\n*1952&ndash;1954 Brigadier James Moulton\n*1954&ndash;1955 Brigadier Ian Riches\n*1955&ndash;1957 Brigadier Reginald Madoc\n*1957&ndash;1959 Brigadier Robert Houghton\n*1959&ndash;1960 Brigadier Peter Hellings\n*1960&ndash;1962 Brigadier Norman Tailyour\n*1962&ndash;1964 Brigadier Francis Barton\n*1964&ndash;1965 Brigadier Leslie Marsh\n*1965&ndash;1966 Brigadier Anthony Willasey-Wilsey\n*1966&ndash;1968 Brigadier Ian Gourlay\n*1968&ndash;1970 Brigadier Peter Whiteley\n*1970&ndash;1972 Brigadier Patrick Ovens\n*1972&ndash;1975 Brigadier Roger Ephraums\n*1975&ndash;1977 Brigadier John Richards\n*1977&ndash;1979 Brigadier Jeremy Moore\n*1979&ndash;1981 Brigadier Michael Wilkins\n*1981&ndash;1983 Brigadier Julian Thompson\n*1983&ndash;1984 Brigadier Martin Garrod\n*1984&ndash;1986 Brigadier Henry Beverley\n*1986&ndash;1988 Brigadier Robin Ross\n*1988&ndash;1990 Brigadier Andrew Whitehead\n*1990&ndash;1992 Brigadier Andrew Keeling\n*1992&ndash;1994 Brigadier David Pennefather\n*1994&ndash;1995 Brigadier Jonathan Thomson\n*1995&ndash;1997 Brigadier Anthony Milton\n*1997&ndash;1998 Brigadier Robert Fulton\n*1998&ndash;1999 Brigadier David Wilson\n*1999&ndash;2001 Brigadier Robert Fry\n*2001&ndash;2002 Brigadier Roger Lane\n*2002&ndash;2004 Brigadier James Dutton\n*2004&ndash;2006 Brigadier John Rose\n*2006&ndash;2007 Brigadier Jeremy Thomas\n*2007&ndash;2008 Brigadier David Capewell\n*2008&ndash;2008 Brigadier Buster Howes\n*2008&ndash;2009 Brigadier Gordon Messenger\n*2010&ndash;2011 Brigadier Ed Davis\n*2011&ndash;2013 Brigadier Martin Smith\n*2013&ndash;2014 Brigadier Stuart M.
