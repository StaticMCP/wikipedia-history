He was an important part of the Early Music movement in the middle of the last century, in particular as a celebrated interpreter of 16th century polyphony In his later years he made notable recordings of the late French Romantic school of organ composers, particularly César Franck, on the Cavaillé Coll organ at St. Michael's Abbey in Farnborough.  The National Pipe Organ Register now claims that the organ appears in a list of organs by Mutin (originally attributed to Aristide Cavaille-Coll).\nEducated at Ellesmere College, Shropshire, Michael went on to study Organ (with G.D. Cunningham) and Composition (with William Alwyn) at the Royal Academy of Music in London. His organ studies continued with Ralph Downes at the Brompton Oratory, London, and Marcel Dupré at St Sulpice in Paris.\nIn 1944 he founded The Renaissance Singers with whom he gave numerous concerts and made many recordings and broadcasts for the next twenty years. He was organist of Tewkesbury Abbey (1943–1944), Christ Church, Woburn Square in London (1945–1950), Ely Cathedral (1953–1958), St. Marylebone Parish Church in London (1971–1979) and at St. Michael's Abbey in Farnborough (1984–1986). In the 1960s he formed and conducted the sixteen-voice group Cantores in Ecclesia.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110717025454/http://www.signumrecords.com/catalogue/sigcd161/index.shtml Information about the premiere recordings of Michael Howard's Seven Songs for Countertenor]\n*[http://www.verusrecords.com/main_page.html Information about restored and reissued recordings made by Michael Howard conducting The Choir of Ely Cathedral and The Renaissance Singers]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110723090751/http://www.heraldav.co.uk/catalogue?diskNum=154 Link to a recording made at Farnborough Abbey by Michael Howard]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090817113116/http://www.heraldav.co.uk/catalogue?diskNum=125 Link to a recording made at Farnborough Abbey by Michael Howard]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110723090900/http://www.heraldav.co.uk/catalogue?diskNum=147 Link to a recording made at Farnborough Abbey by Michael Howard]\n*[http://www.alibris.co.uk/search/classical/qwork/700056606/used/Purcell:%20Music%20for%20Westminster%20Abbey Link to a BBC Classics reissue of Music for Westminster Abbey (Purcell) by Michael Howard and Cantores in Ecclesia]\n*[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B001GLQWD6 Link to reissues by L'Oiseau Lyre of recordings of Byrd made by Michael Howard and Cantores in Ecclesia]"
