In that year he was residing at 29 Compton Street, Soho with his older brother Elias Childe. He was also the brother of magic lantern maker Henry Langdon Childe.\nHis first exhibited works were landscapes, chiefly taken from London and the immediate neighborhood.\nHe first appears as a miniature painter in 1815, and seems to have thenceforth adopted that particular line exclusively.\nFrom that year to 1853 he was a constant exhibitor of miniatures at the Royal Academy, and also at the Suffolk Street gallery. Most of his exhibited works were portraits of best known and most popular actors and actresses of the day.\nFamily\nHe married Ann, née Banfield on 25 June 1810. His own children, who included singer Ann Childe Seguin and artist Maria Louisa Childe, were also favorite subjects.\nChilde resided the greater part of his life at 39 Bedford Street, Covent Garden, and died at Searsdale Terrace, Kensington, on 19 September 1862, aged 82.\nHis middle name has also been listed as Wearing, Wearin or Waring.\nGallery\nFile:James Warren Childe, circa 1810-15 A subaltern of the 24th (2nd Warwickshire) Regiment of Foot.jpg\nFile:Mary Ann Paton by James Warren Childe.jpg\nFile:Mendelssohn Bartholdy.jpg\nFile:Portrait of a girl holding a bonnet, James Warren Childe.jpg\nFile:Portrait of two gentlemen, 1817.jpg\nFile:William Sterndale Bennett by James Warren Childe, c. 1832.jpg\nReferences\nAttribution\nExternal links\n*[http://www.artnet.com/artists/james-warren-childe/past-auction-results James Warren Childe at artnet.com]\n*"
