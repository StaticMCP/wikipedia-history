His best-known works are Introduction to Pali (1963), Indian Buddhism (1970), and the eight-volume Indian Kāvya Literature (1972–2011).\nLife\nWarder was born in England on 8 September 1924.\nHe studied Sanskrit and Pali at the School of Oriental and African Studies, and received his doctorate from there in 1954. His thesis, supervised by John Brough, was entitled Pali Metre: A Study of the Evolution of Early Middle Indian Metre Based on the Verse Preserved in the Pali Canon. (When it was published in 1967, the title was changed to Pali Metre: A Contribution to the History of Indian Literature.)\nFor a number of years, he was an active member of the Pali Text Society, which published his first book, Introduction to Pali, in 1963. He based this popular primer on extracts from the Dīgha Nikāya, and took the then revolutionary step of treating Pali as an independent language, not just a derivative of Sanskrit.\nHis began his academic career at the University of Edinburgh in 1955, but in 1963 moved to the University of Toronto. There, as Chairman of the Department of East Asian Studies, he built up a strong programme in Sanskrit and South Asian studies. He retired in 1990.\nStudies on Buddhism in Honour of Professor A. K. Warder was published in 1993, edited by Narendra K. Wagle and Fumimaro Watanabe.\nHe and his wife, Nargez, died of natural causes almost simultaneously on 8 January 2013. He was eighty-eight, and she was ninety. They had no children. They were buried together following a Buddhist service.\nNotable works\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20150911081554/http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Introduction%20to%20Pali_Warder.pdf Introduction to Pali] (1st ed. 1963, 2nd ed. 1974, 3rd ed. 1991)\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20161227203702/http://www.palitext.com/palitext/PaliMetre.pdf Pali Metre: A Contribution to the History of Indian Literature] (1967)\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20150911080535/http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Indian%20Buddhism_Warder_1970-2004.pdf Indian Buddhism] (1st ed. 1970, 2nd ed. 1980, 3rd ed. 2000)\n*A Course in Indian Philosophy (1st ed. 1971, 2nd ed. 1998)\n*An Introduction to Indian Historiography (1972)\n*Indian Kāvya Literature: Volumes IVIII (19722011)\nNotes\nReferences\n}}"
