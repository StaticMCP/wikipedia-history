The kingdom was contemporary of Pragjyotisha. In Puranic literature, Pragjyotisha and Sonitpura were located to the north-west of the Indian subcontinent in what is modern-day Punjab and Sindh. In Assam, the name of the legendary kingdom might be applied to the local inhabitants who were outside of the Hindu fold. In Kalika purana, Banasura, the last ruler of the asura kingdom is represented as an anti-Brahminical character.\nDynasty\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:25%;\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n!Nu.!!
