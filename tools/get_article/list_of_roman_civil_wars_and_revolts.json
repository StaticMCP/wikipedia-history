For the Eastern Roman Empire or Byzantine Empire after the division of the Empire in West and East, see List of Byzantine revolts and civil wars (AD 330–1453). For external conflicts, see List of Roman external wars and battles.\nFrom the establishment of the Roman Republic in 509 BC until the 1st century BC, there were a sparse number of civil wars. But with the Crisis of the Roman Republic (134–44 BC), a period of considerable political instability began. The cause of the late Roman Republican civil wars is contested, as is whether the wars were the cause of, or caused by, the end of the Roman Republic. Regardless, a nearly constant stream of civil wars marked the end of the Roman Republic and heralded the rise of the Roman Empire in 27 BC. The first century of Empire was marked by widespread revolt through territory Rome had captured in the preceding centuries. The second century AD was relatively peaceful, with a limited number of revolts. Political instability returned to the Empire with the Crisis of the Third Century (235–284 AD), which saw at least 26 civil wars in just 50 years as usurpers sought the imperial throne. The fourth and fifth centuries AD were characterized by a regular rising of usurpers. The overthrow of the last Western Roman emperor in AD 476 by the Germanic king Odoacer marked the final civil war or revolt, as well as the end of the Western Roman Empire.\nBecause the study of Roman civil war has been deeply influenced by historic Roman views on civil war, not all entries on this list may be considered civil wars by modern historians. Implicit in most Roman power struggles was a propaganda battle, which impacted how the struggle would be chronicled and referred to. For example, historians Lange & Vervaet suggest that the crisis after Caesar's assassination might be better understood as an internal emergency. Conversely, some revolts on this list may be properly considered to be civil wars, but were not referred to as such by Roman chroniclers. As Lange & Vervaet note, \"civil war often refuses to speak its name.\"\n6th century BC\n* 509 BC Overthrow of the Roman monarchy\n* 509 BC Tarquinian conspiracy\n5th century BC\n* 500 BC–287/286 BC Conflict of the Orders – political struggle between the plebeians and patricians of the Roman Republic\n3rd century BC\n* 269 BC: Revolt of the Samnites guided by Lollius - revolt suppressed\n* 269-268 BC: Picenti revolt - revolt suppressed and their land is conquered\n* 265-264 BC: Revolt of the Etruscan city Volsinii: revolt suppressed with city being destroyed\n* 241 BC: Falisci revolt – revolt suppressed and their city destroyed\n* 216–203 BC: Defection of Rome's Italic allies to the Carthaginians during the Second Punic War\n2nd century BC\n* 135–132 BC: First Servile War in Sicily - slave revolt suppressed\n* 125 BC: Fregellae's revolt - revolt suppressed\n* 104–100 BC: Second Servile War in Sicily - slave revolt suppressed\n1st century BC\n* 91–87 BC: Social War, between Rome and many of its fellow Italian allies – Roman victory.\n** 89 BC – Battle of Fucine Lake – Roman forces under Lucius Porcius Cato are defeated by the Italian rebels.\n** 89 BC – Battle of Asculum – Roman army of C.
