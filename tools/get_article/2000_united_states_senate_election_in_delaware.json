Incumbent Republican U.S. senator William Roth ran for re-election to a sixth term, but he was defeated by outgoing Democratic governor Tom Carper.\nCarper subsequently became the first Democrat to hold this seat since 1947. It was also the first time since 1943 in which both of the state's Senate seats were held by Democrats. Additionally, it was the only time Carper lost Kent County in his entire political career.\nGeneral election\nCandidates\n*Tom Carper, Governor of Delaware and former U.S. representative (Democratic)\n*Mark E. Dankof (Constitution)\n*Robert Mattson (Natural Law)\n*J. Burke Morrison (Libertarian)\n*William Roth, incumbent U.S. senator since 1971 (Republican)\nCampaign\nFor 16 years, the same four people had held all four major statewide positions in Delaware. Governor Tom Carper was term-limited and could not run for re-election again. Both he and U.S. representative Mike Castle wanted to be U.S. senator. However, Roth would not retire, and fellow Republican Castle decided against a primary.\nRoth, 79, had served in the U.S. Senate for 30 years. He was the chairman of the Finance Committee. Carper, 53, was a popular governor and former U.S. congressman of Delaware's At-large congressional district, who announced his candidacy against Roth in September 1999. Both candidates were moderates. Roth was one of the few Republicans to vote for the Brady Bill. Although Roth started the campaign with a 2-to-1 spending advantage, Carper went into the final month with more than $1 million on hand. In a contest between two popular and respected politicians, the main issue seemed to be Roth's age versus Carper's relative youth.\nDebates\n*[https://www.c-span.org/video/?159787-1/delaware-senatorial-debate Complete video of debate], October 15, 2000\nResults\nCarper defeated Roth by over ten points. Roth received more votes than presidential candidate George W. Bush, suggesting the strength of the Democratic turnout was a boon to Carper's candidacy. Some attributed Roth's loss to his age and health, as he collapsed twice during the campaign, once in the middle of a television interview and once during a campaign event.\n}}\n13.04\n}}\n12.12\n}}\n1.36\n}}\nBy county\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;font-size:90%;line-height:1.3\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |County\n! colspan=\"2\" |Tom CarperDemocratic\n! colspan=\"2\" |William RothRepublican\n! colspan=\"2\" |All Others\n|-\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" |#\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" |%\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" |#\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" |%\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" |#\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" |%\n|-\n!  |Kent\n|  |21,998\n|  |46.09\n|  |25,387\n|  |53.19\n|  |344\n|  |0.72\n|-\n!  |New Castle\n|  |128,491\n|  |60.09\n|  |83,554\n|  |39.07\n|  |1,786\n|  |0.84\n|-\n!  |Sussex\n|  |31,077\n|  |47.49\n|  |33,950\n|  |51.89\n|  |406\n|  |0.62\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n!
