His father and namesake founded the Cumberland Paper Mills in Maine. He had four siblings: Henry Clarke Warren, scholar of Sanskrit and Pali; Cornelia Lyman Warren, philanthropist; Edward Perry Warren, art collector; and Fredrick Fiske Warren, political radical and utopist.\nWarren graduated from the Boston Latin School, after which he entered Harvard College, earning his undergraduate degree in 1875. He graduated second in his class at Harvard Law School in 1877. The first-place student was his friend Louis Brandeis, later a justice of the United States Supreme Court. Warren was editor of The Harvard Crimson.\nMarriage\nWarren married Mabel Bayard, the eldest daughter of United States Senator from Delaware Thomas F. Bayard, at the Church of the Ascension in Washington, D.C., on January 25, 1883. The couple went on to have six children.\nCareer\nWarren and Brandeis founded the prominent Boston law firm of Nutter McClennen & Fish in 1879. At the end of 1890 they published their famous law review article \"The Right to Privacy\" in the Harvard Law Review.  It is \"one of the most influential essays in the history of American law\" and is widely regarded as the first publication in the United States to advocate a right to privacy, articulating that right primarily as a \"right to be let alone\" which referred to paragraph 11 of the 1868 law of the press of France. Brandeis later acknowledged that the idea for the essay originated with Warren's \"deep-seated abhorrance of the invasions of social privacy\" on the part of the press.\nIn 1899, he left law to oversee the family's paper production business. He managed the family trust established in May 1889 with the legal assistance of Brandeis to benefit his father's widow and 5 children. In 1906, Warren's brothers Edward and Fiske charged that Brandeis had structured the trust to benefit Samuel at the expense of his siblings.\nWarren served from 1902 to 1906 as president of the trustees of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.\nDeath and aftermath\nWarren committed suicide by firearm at his Dedham, Massachusetts, country home on the night of February 18, 1910, putting to an end the dispute over the family trust. His family disguised his suicide and the date of his death. The New York Times reported that he died of apoplexy on February 20. Following a funeral service at his Boston residence, he was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery on February 23.\nThe Warren Trust case became a point of contention during the 1916 Senate hearings on the confirmation of Brandeis to the Supreme Court, and it remains important for its explication of legal ethics and professional responsibility.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n* [http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/privacy/Privacy_brand_warr2.html Louis Brandeis & Samuel Warren,\" The Right to Privacy,\" 4 Harvard Law Review 193-220 (1890-91)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060706040310/http://www.nutter.com/about.php  Nutter McClennen & Fish LLP], the law firm founded by Brandeis and Warren\n*[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/127474275/samuel-dennis-warren Samuel Dennis Warren] at FindAGrave.com"
