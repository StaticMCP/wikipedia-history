The most notable example was the Soviet Socialist Republic of Abkhazia (1921–1931), which was united with the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic under the 1921 Union Treaty. In Soviet constitutional terminology, it was also known as a Contractual Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic ().\nOrigins and concept\nThe concept of a \"treaty republic\" arose during the formative years of Soviet federalism (1920–1924), when the Bolshevik leadership was experimenting with different models for integrating non-Russian territories into the emerging Soviet state. These arrangements were intended to balance local autonomy with central control, particularly in ethnically diverse regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia.\nUnlike standard autonomous republics, treaty republics were linked to a union or federated republic through a bilateral treaty that outlined mutual obligations and shared competencies, such as defence, finance, and trade. In principle, this arrangement gave the treaty republic limited sovereignty and the right to its own constitution and government, while remaining politically tied to a larger Soviet republic.\nThe Abkhaz example (1921–1931)\nThe most significant example of a treaty republic was the Soviet Socialist Republic of Abkhazia (SSR Abkhazia). Following the Red Army's advance into the South Caucasus, the Soviet Socialist Republic of Georgia was proclaimed on 18 February 1921, and the Soviet Socialist Republic of Abkhazia was declared on 4 March 1921.\nOn 21 May 1921, Georgia officially recognised the Abkhaz SSR. A formal Union Treaty between the SSR of Georgia and the SSR of Abkhazia was signed on 16 December 1921, establishing a framework for military, political, and financial-economic cooperation through joint commissariats. The treaty explicitly stated that foreign policy would remain under the jurisdiction of the Georgian SSR. It further stipulated that \"in every regional union, namely within the Federation of the Trans-Caucasus Republics, Abkhazia enters through Georgia.\"\nUnder this arrangement, Abkhazia maintained its own constitution, government, and symbols, and enjoyed a degree of internal sovereignty. Article 4 of the 1925 Constitution of the Abkhaz SSR stated that \"the Abkhaz Soviet Socialist Republic, united on the basis of a Union Treaty with the Georgian SSR, enters the Transcaucasian Soviet Socialist Federative Republic through the Georgian SSR and, as a member of the latter, the USSR.\"\nAt the same time, Article 5 declared Abkhazia to be \"a sovereign state, which exercises state authority on its territory independently from any other powers.\"\nThis ambiguous status made Abkhazia both a union republic (de jure) and an autonomous republic (de facto). Soviet historians and constitutional scholars often described it as an experiment in asymmetrical federalism.\nConstitutional evolution and abolition\nWhen the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic (TSFSR) was established on 13 December 1922, Abkhazia entered the federation \"through\" Georgia rather than as an independent member. This arrangement was confirmed in the 1925 Abkhaz Constitution and in Chapter 5 of the 1927 Constitution of the Georgian SSR, which defined Abkhazia as a \"Contractual Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.\"\nIn February 1931, during a session of the Sixth All-Georgian Congress of Soviets, Abkhazia's treaty status was unilaterally abolished. The republic was downgraded to the Abkhaz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Abkhaz ASSR) within the Georgian SSR.\nThis change removed its theoretical right of secession, since only full union republics—under the Soviet constitutions of 1924, 1936, and 1977—possessed such a right.\nAlthough Abkhazia retained certain autonomous institutions (a Supreme Soviet and Council of Ministers), real power was concentrated in the Georgian and all-Union Communist Party structures. The demotion coincided with the rise of Lavrentiy Beria and the start of political purges and policies of Georgianisation, including the closure of Abkhaz-language schools and the settlement of Georgian peasants in Abkhazia.\nLegal and political significance\nThe abolition of Abkhazia's treaty status had far-reaching constitutional implications. Under the original 1921–1931 arrangement, Abkhazia's formal sovereignty implied potential parity with Georgia within the Soviet federation. After 1931, this parity was removed, and Abkhazia became a sub-entity lacking the right to secede.\nDuring the late Soviet period, the historical precedent of the 1921 Treaty Republic was revived by Abkhaz legal scholars to argue for the republic's distinct constitutional status and right to self-determination. The 1990 Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Abkhaz SSR explicitly referred to its \"union treaty of 1921\" as a legal foundation for sovereignty.\nFollowing the collapse of the USSR, this interpretation underpinned Abkhazia's arguments for international recognition in the 1990s and beyond.\nOther cases\nWhile the Abkhaz SSR was the clearest instance of a treaty-based republic, similar though less formalised arrangements existed elsewhere in the early 1920s:\n* The Bukharan People's Soviet Republic and Khorezm People's Soviet Republic, which were initially independent socialist states that later joined the USSR through negotiated agreements before being transformed into union republics.\n* Early federative experiments in Central Asia (1920–1924), where entities like the Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Region were linked to larger republics under contractual frameworks prior to full incorporation.\nHowever, only Abkhazia maintained an explicit bilateral \"Union Treaty\" with another Soviet republic, making it a unique case in Soviet constitutional practice.\nLegacy\nThe notion of a treaty republic remains an important precedent in discussions of Soviet federalism and post-Soviet constitutional law. It illustrates the tension between the Soviet principle of self-determination and the reality of centralised control.\nIn Abkhazia, the treaty period (1921–1931) is remembered as an era of relative autonomy and cultural flourishing before the Stalin–Beria terror and the subsequent period of Georgianisation.\nContemporary Abkhaz historians often refer to the SSR Abkhazia as a \"state within a state\" and a model of asymmetrical federation that was prematurely dismantled by Stalin's centralising policies.\nSee also\n* Abkhaz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic\n* Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic\n* Georgian–Abkhaz conflict\nReferences"
