In 1852, he moved to Roxbury, Massachusetts. He was co-editor of the Journal of Agriculture from 1852 to 1862 and from 1855 to 1862 he served in the Massachusetts legislature as a representative of the Know Nothing Movement.\nAmerican Civil War\nKing enlisted in the Union Army on August 4, 1862 and mustered on August 10 as Captain of Company K, 35th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment.\nKing commanded the regiment in the battles of South Mountain and Antietam. The regiment suffered heavy losses; according to one source, nearly half of Company K was killed or wounded in these engagements. On September 17 he was severely wounded at Antietam. According to contemporary accounts, he was hit by shot and shell between twenty and twenty-one times and received seven wounds.\nAfter recovering from his wounds, King was promoted to Major of the regiment on December 15, 1862 and to Lieutenant Colonel on April 25, 1863. By 1864, he had served as chief of staff of the 2nd Division, IX Corps (1862), Provost-Marshal General of Kentucky (1863), and military commander of the district of Lexington, Kentucky (1863). He was discharged on November 14, 1864, to take the appointment as Colonel of the 4th Massachusetts Heavy Artillery Regiment on November 22.\nKing was honored by brevet to Brigadier General of Volunteers on March 12, 1865, and mustered out of the service on June 17, 1865, in Washington, D.C.\nLater career\nAfter the war, King lived in Lynn, Massachusetts. In July 1865 King was appointed by Governor John Albion Andrew as the first Constable of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, now the Massachusetts State Police. He is credited for designing the first badge worn by the state police.\nIn 1866, King was made an assessor of United States Internal Revenue, and in 1871 became Registrar of Probate and Insolvency. He returned to the Massachusetts legislature in 1875-1876.\nPersonal life\nKing married Miss Ellen Grinnell of Providence, Rhode Island, on May 6, 1844.
