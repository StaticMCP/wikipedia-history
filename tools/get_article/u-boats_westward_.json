(in English: U-boats Westward!) is a 1941 German war film promoting the Kriegsmarine. It centers on a U-boat mission in the Battle of the Atlantic and was produced by UFA. The U-boat used for the film was , which would later play a major role in Operation Drumbeat.\nPlot\nThe film opens aboard a U-boat as it returns from a mission. It then follows the crew onshore the day before they ship off for their next mission—meeting their families and sweethearts, spending a last night at a club, and so forth. Then they ship off, soon sighting and boarding a Dutch merchant ship, which they inspect for contraband. The boarding of the ship is shown being done professionally and in a non-confrontational manner. While they are aboard the Dutch ship, a Royal Navy ship spots them and tries to torpedo them, but the U-boat ends up sinking it.\nCast\n* Herbert Wilk as Kapitänleutnant Hoffmeister\n* Heinz Engelmann as Olt. zur See Wiegand\n* Joachim Brennecke as Lt. zur See v.
