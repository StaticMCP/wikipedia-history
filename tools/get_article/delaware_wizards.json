      "text": "# Delaware Wizards\n\nThe Delaware Wizards were a professional  soccer club based in Wilmington and New Castle, Delaware. The team played their first game in 1993 and their last in 2000. They played in the USISL.  They were considered DC United's farm team but ended up folding due to financial issues and losing players to other clubs.  Many players went to MLS and other USL teams.\nIn 2007, David Whitcraft was inducted into the Delaware Sports Museum and Hall of Fame for his efforts as the first captain of the team.\nIn 2008, a reincarnation of the Delaware Wizards was formed playing amateur soccer. Led by a group of former fans and ball boys of the original Delaware Wizards, they have enjoyed modest success. As of 2009, they currently play in the New Castle County Soccer League.\nYear-by-year\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Division\n!League\n!Reg.
