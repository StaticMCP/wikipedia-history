This list focuses on the level of interoperability (the ability for the software to be able to connect with another software) that a specific software or device has.\nThe intent of this list is to:\n# help doctors decide which platform would best suite their needs\n# help software vendors publicize their level or interest in interoperability\nOrthodontic Software and their level of Interoperability\nExplanation of Columns\n* Developer: the company producing the software product (Q01)\n* Product: the name of the software product (Q01)\n* Version: version and release year (Q01)\n* Description: Definition of the product as defined by the developer/producer\n* DICOM Import (Q11-Q14): Can the software ingest/import DICOM images?\n** Filesystem (Q12): Can read .dcm files, DICOMDIR\n** Network (Q13): Can read via DIMSE, WADO\n** Bulk (Q14): Can import entire database\n* DICOM Export (Q15-Q18): Can the software export/save/push DICOM images?\n** Filesystem (Q16): Can write .dcm files, DICOMDIR\n** Network (Q17): Can send via DIMSE, WADO\n** Bulk (Q18): Can export entire database\n* DICOM Conformance (Q19): Link to published DICOM conformance statement\n* HL7/FHIR Support (Q30-Q49): Level of HL7/FHIR implementation\n* i14y Friendly: Willingness to collaborate on interoperability standards\n* Updated: Last update date\n* Reference (Q02): Source of information\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
