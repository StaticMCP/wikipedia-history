Probably the son of Bishop Robert Peche, Dugdale and Banks claim that Robert of Peche (died 1126), medieval bishop of Coventry, had two sons, one of whom was the future Bishop of Lichfield, Richard Peche.\nThe book History of Ireland of 1885, mentions him as lord of the lands of St. Catherine, with the knight Adam de Hereford and lord of Leixilip, with the nobleman John Warrisius (probable son of Warrisius de Peche) prior of St. Catherine and lord of Lucan. The book tells that they had to find six chaplains to celebrate the divine offices forever in St. Catherine's Priory, for the souls of all their ancestors.\nCitations\nReferences\n*\n*\n*"
