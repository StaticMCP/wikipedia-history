Its members have competed at the Olympic Games since 1956. In 1970 the club made the news for preventing its female sailors from attending a function hosted by the club and attended by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. In 2006, the club's registration with Yachting Queensland was controversially suspended for a short period after the club failed to forward affiliation fees to the state governing body.\nSee also\n*List of International Council of Yacht Clubs members\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.rqys.com.au/ Official Website]"
