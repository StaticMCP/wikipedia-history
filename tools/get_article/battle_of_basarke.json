Buddha Dal was driven away towards the Malwa region by Lakhpat Rai, the Diwan of Zakariya Khan. The Buddha Dal was welcomed by Ala Singh, the leader of the Phulkian Misl. The presence of the Dal proved a great opportunity for him, because with Buddha Dal's help, he was able to extend his territory and annex the whole of Sunam.  After punishing the governor of Sirhind, Nawab Kapur Singh led the Sikhs back to the Majha to celebrate Diwali at Amritsar.\nBattle\nWhen the Sikhs were at Basarke, they were attacked by an army numbering 7,000 under the command of Lakhpat Rai. They were defeated and forced to retreat. The next morning when the Buddha Dal reached near Khemkaran, it was joined by Taruna Dal. Reinforcements numbering around 10,000 more troops joined the Muaghl army at Basarke. A battle was fought at Hujra Shah Muqeem near Lahore in which the Sikhs came out on top and defeated the Mughals. In this battle, thousands of troops along with Mukhlas Khan, a son of Jaspat Rai, Duni Chand and two famous faujdars named Jamal Khan and Tatar Khan lost their lives.\nAftermath\nAfter this battle, the Lahore government committed actions against all Sikhs. They took possession of the Golden Temple at Amritsar and the Sikhs were prevented from coming to the temple. It was made unlawful to shelter the Sikhs or help them in any way as well.\nReferences\nSee also\n* Nihang\n* Martyrdom and Sikhism"
