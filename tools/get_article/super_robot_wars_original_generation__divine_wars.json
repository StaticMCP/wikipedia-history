A sequel titled  began airing on October 1, 2010.\nSummary\nThe anime is not a direct adaptation of the original video game, it includes several changes to the plot. While the original game allows the player to decide which of the two protagonists' stories they will follow, the animated series focuses on Ryusei Date's side of the story, with all the other characters already introduced.\nPlot\nIt is two hundred years after the beginning of the Space Era, when human civilization on Earth began expanding into space. However, by the start of the 21st century, two meteors struck the planet, sending humanity into chaos. By the year 179 of the Space Era, secret technology, dubbed Extra-Over Technology, or EOT, was discovered by the Earth Federal Government within a third meteor that hit Earth in the Marquesas Islands of the South Pacific. Dr. Bian Zoldark, head of the EOTI Institute (Extra-Over Technological Investigative Institute), had evidence the creators of the EOT were heading to Earth, in order to reclaim it...or worse, invade the planet. In order to defend humanity from extraterrestrial threats, the government begins to research and develop humanoid mecha called Personal Troopers.\nThe alien race that created the EOT, the Aerogaters, attacked an Earth ship sent out to investigate their presence in the far reaches of the Solar System. This skirmish ends in a defeat for the Aerogaters, prompting the Earth government to negotiate with them. Talks are arranged to take place at a secret facility in Antarctica, but the event is targeted by a rogue faction called the Divine Crusaders. The Divine Crusaders destroy the Aerogater delegation, then turn on the Earth forces. Bian Zoldark, the faction's leader, uses this opportunity to rebel against the Earth government, in hopes of establishing a viable defense for Earth from the Aerogaters and future invaders.\nCharacters\nMain characters\n;\n:\n: A mecha otaku and finalist for the Burning PT Tournament, he is the protagonist of Divine Wars, drafted by the Earth Federation Army for their secret SRX Development Project.\n;\n:\n: A stalwart test pilot for the Earth Federation Army, he is the next person to be part of the SRX Development Project.\n;\n:\n: A relatively new and inexperienced member of the military, she is the third person to be part of the SRX Development Project.\n;\n:\n: A mysterious, yet influential military instructor, currently in charge of the SRX Development Project.\nSupporting characters\n;\n:\n: A quiet young girl who was the part of an experimental project to create Personal Trooper pilots.
