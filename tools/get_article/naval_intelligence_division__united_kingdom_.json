It was the intelligence arm of the British Admiralty before the establishment of a unified Defence Intelligence Staff in 1964.  It dealt with matters concerning British naval plans, with the collection of naval intelligence.  It was also known as \"Room 39\", after its room number at the Admiralty.\nHistory\nThe Foreign Intelligence Committee was established in 1882 and it evolved into the Naval Intelligence Department in 1887.\nThe NID staff were originally responsible for fleet mobilisation and war plans as well as foreign intelligence collection; thus in the beginning there were originally two divisions: (1) intelligence (Foreign) and (2) Mobilisation. In 1900 another division, War, was added to deal with issues of strategy and defence, and in 1902 a fourth division, Trade, was created for matters related to the protection of merchant shipping. The Trade Division was abolished in October 1909 in the wake of the Committee of Imperial Defence inquiry into the feud between the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir John Fisher and former Commander-in-Chief Channel Fleet, Admiral Lord Charles Beresford, when it was discovered that the captain heading the Trade Division had been supplying the latter with confidential information during the inquiry.\nIn 1910, the NID was shorn of its responsibility for war planning and strategy when the outgoing Fisher created the Navy War Council as a stop-gap remedy to criticisms emanating from the Beresford Inquiry that the Navy needed a naval staff—a role the NID had been in fact fulfilling since at least 1900, if not earlier. After this reorganisation, war planning and strategic matters were transferred to the newly created Naval Mobilisation Department and the NID reverted to the position it held prior to 1887—an intelligence collection and collation organisation.\nIn 1912 the division was established as a component part of the new Admiralty War Staff organisation when that body was abolished in 1917 it continued as a division of the new Admiralty Naval Staff until 1964 when the Admiralty Department was abolished.\nWorld War I\nDuring World War I the NID was responsible for the Royal Navy's highly successful cryptographic efforts, Room 40. The interception and decoding of the Zimmermann Telegram played a role in bringing the United States into the War. It has described as the most significant intelligence triumph for Britain during World War I, and one of the first occasions on which a piece of signals intelligence influenced world events.\nWorld War II\nNaval Ultra messages were handled differently from Army and Air Force Ultra because the Admiralty was an operational HQ and could give orders during a battle; while the Imperial General Staff (Army) and Air Staff would give commanders general orders such as, \"clear the enemy out of Africa\" without telling them how to do it. Hence verbatim translations of naval decodes were sent by Hut 4 to the NID and nowhere else (except for some naval intelligence sent directly from Bletchley Park to Commanders-in-Chief in the Mediterranean).\nHut 8 which decrypted Enigma messages for Hut 4 to translate and analyse had less information for Ultra as the Kriegsmarine operated Enigma more securely than the German Army and Air Force. Hut 4 also broke various hand cyphers and some Italian naval traffic.\nThe NID also initiated the 30th Assault Unit whose role was information gathering, reconnaissance and sabotage. Members of the unit, including Ralph Izzard, are acknowledged as inspirations for Ian Fleming (who also worked for the NID) in the creation of his fictional spy, James Bond.\nGeographical section\nThe Geographical Section of the Naval Intelligence Division, Naval Staff, Admiralty, produced a series of Geographical Handbooks from 1917 to 1922 to provide information for the British Armed Forces. The Naval Intelligence Division Geographical Handbook Series was produced between 1941 and 1946 to provide information for the British Armed Forces.\nAmalgamation\nIn 1965, the three service intelligence departments were amalgamated in the new Defence Intelligence Service at the Ministry of Defence.\nHowever, well before the mid-1990s another Royal Naval branch existed, namely the Directorate of Naval Security & Integrated Contingency Planning (DNSyICP), which is based at HM Naval Base Portsmouth under the staff command of the Second Sea Lord & C-in-C Naval Home Command.\nDirectors of Naval Intelligence\nDirectors of Naval Intelligence included:\n* Rear-Admiral Lewis Beaumont, 1895&ndash;1899\n* Rear-Admiral Reginald Custance, 1899&ndash;1902\n* Rear-Admiral Prince Louis of Battenberg, 1902&ndash;1905\n* Rear-Admiral Charles Ottley, 1905&ndash;1907\n* Rear-Admiral Edmond Slade, 1907&ndash;1909\n* Rear-Admiral Alexander Bethell, 1909&ndash;1912\n* Captain Thomas Jackson, 1912&ndash;1913\n* Rear-Admiral Henry Oliver, 1913&ndash;1914\n* Rear-Admiral Sir Reginald 'Blinker' Hall, 1914&ndash;1919\n* Rear-Admiral Hugh 'Quex' Sinclair, 1919&ndash;1921\n* Rear-Admiral Maurice Fitzmaurice, 1921&ndash;1924\n* Rear-Admiral Alan Hotham, 1924&ndash;1927\n* Rear-Admiral William Fisher (Acting), 1926&ndash;1927\n* Rear-Admiral Barry Domvile, 1927&ndash;1930\n* Rear-Admiral Cecil Usborne, 1930&ndash;1932\n* Rear-Admiral Gerald Dickens, 1932&ndash;1935\n* Vice-Admiral James Troup, 1935&ndash;1939\n* Rear-Admiral John Godfrey, 1939&ndash;1942\n* Rear-Admiral Edmund Rushbrooke, 1942&ndash;1946\n* Vice-Admiral Edward Parry, 1946&ndash;1948\n* Rear-Admiral Eric Longley-Cook, 1948&ndash;1951\n* Rear-Admiral Sir Anthony Buzzard, 1951&ndash;1954\n* Vice-Admiral Sir John Inglis, 1954&ndash;1960\n* Vice-Admiral Sir Norman Denning, 1960&ndash;1964\n* Rear-Admiral Patrick Graham, 1964&ndash;1965\nDeputy Directors of Naval Intelligence\nDeputy Directors of Naval Intelligence included:\n* Raymond A.
