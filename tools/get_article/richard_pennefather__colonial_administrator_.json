He was made responsible for Indian affairs for part of his time there but left Canada in 1861 when Head's term of office expired.\nHe was appointed Accountant General and Controller of Revenue of Ceylon on 25 April 1861, succeeding William Charles Gibson, and held the office until his death in 1865, when he was succeeded by Robert John Callander.\nReferences\n}}\n}}"
