The DME Award aims to promote the strategic use of design within European businesses. It awards the management and successful implementation of design in their processes and strategies to achieve their business goals. The DME Network consists of 24 partners from 17 countries that have been organizing the DME Award since 2007.\nHistory\nADMIRE (Award for Design Management Innovating and Reinforcing Enterprises, January 2007 – February 2009)\nThe DME Award started off as part of the ADMIRE programme in January 2007. The ADMIRE programme was a 2-year project in the European PRO – INNO programme of the Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry of the European Commission. The 6.4 million Euro programme addressed the Innovation management agenda of PRO – INNO Europe by raising the awareness of Design Management, in particular amongst European small and medium enterprises, to improve their competitiveness and to boost the European economy in general. It was one of the key project objectives to establish the DME Award. 18 European organisations participated in this programme under the coordination of the City of Eindhoven until the end of the ADMIRE project in February 2009.\nDME Organisation (February 2009 – Present)\nThe former ADMIRE partners have been organising the DME Award since the end of the funded ADMIRE project on a voluntary basis. The role of these DME partners is to promote and organize the annual DME Award. For this purpose, a DME Award board was elected. The board consists of five representatives from the following organisations:\n* Cardiff Metropolitan University\n* City of Eindhoven\n* European Design Centre\n* Design Austria\nThe costs of the DME Award ceremony are covered by the hosting cities and entering the Award is free for all participants. The entrants are challenged to represent their Design Management processes, strategies and procedures in poster format. These posters are judged by a jury of internationally recognised Design Management experts.\nJudging criteria\nThe DME judging Criteria are:\n* Resources : Level of allocated resources\n* Awareness of Benefits : Level of added value through design.\n* Planning : Plans, objectives and integration of design.\n* Process : The process for the use of design.\n* Expertise : Level of employment of internal and external expertise.\nCategories\nCurrent categories\nLarge Company:\n* Open to private companies with 250 employees or more or with an annual turnover in excess of €50,000,000\nMedium-sized Company:\n* Open to private companies with 50 to 249 employees or with an annual turnover not in excess of €50,000,000\nSmall Company:\n* Open to private companies with 10 to 49 employees and with an annual turnover not in excess of €10,000,000\nMicro Company:\n* Open to private companies with 9 employees or less and with an annual turnover not in excess of €2,000,000\nPublic or non–profit organisation (NPO):\n* Open to public or non–profit organisations such as charities, government programmes, city councils or schools and colleges\nOrganisations outside of Europe\n* Open to any private companies and public or non-profit organisations operating outside of Europe.\nPrevious categories\nFirst time design project (2007–2010):\n* This category was specific to SMEs (less than 250 employees and a turnover not in excess of €50,000,000).
