It is a five-tiered marble structure, topped by a bronze statue of an\nangel standing on a sphere, and a bronze Confederate Army soldier on the front of its fourth tier. It was erected in 1904–05, with funding from a variety of sources, including the state, primarily through the efforts of a consortium of Confederate memorial groups. Originally located prominently near the main eastern entrance to the capitol building, it was later moved to the northeast lawn.\nThe monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Little Rock, Arkansas\n*List of Confederate monuments and memorials\nReferences"
