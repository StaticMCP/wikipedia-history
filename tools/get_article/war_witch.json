It is about a child soldier forced into a civil war in Africa, and who is believed to be a witch. The film was primarily shot in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in French and Lingala.\nAfter premiering at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival, the film received positive reviews. It won several honours, including ten at the 1st Canadian Screen Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. War Witch was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film.\nPlot\nDuring a civil war in sub-Saharan Africa, a 12-year-old girl named Komona is abducted by a rebel group who raided her village to become a child soldier under a warlord known as the Great Tiger. The rebels compel Komona to kill her own parents. Then, she is sailed to a deserted island with many more children. They are used as porters, then taught to use automatic weapons and forced to go to war with the rebels. After drinking tree sap, she begins to experience vivid hallucinations. When her visions enable her to survive an attack, she is considered to be a child witch and is viewed as an asset by the Great Tiger.\nKomona and her young love interest, a boy with albinism known as Magician, eventually escape the rebels and move to live with her uncle. He hopes to marry her, and she asks him to capture a rare white rooster to secure her agreement. He does so  but she is tracked down and kidnapped by one of the Great Tiger's commanders, and Magician is killed. After Komona becomes the commander's concubine, she kills him and runs away to her uncle, narrating her life story to her fetus. On the way to her hometown, to bury her parents who have been haunting her, she gives birth to a baby boy whom she names after the magician.\nCast\nProduction\nwrote the screenplay after reading about child soldiers in Burma.]]\nMontreal director Kim Nguyen wrote the screenplay over a period of 10 years, inspired by an article about children in Burma leading a rebellion force. In researching the film, Nguyen met real child soldiers and humanitarian staff. He envisioned his project as \"a redemption story about a child who lives through war and peace.\"\nWar Witch was primarily filmed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Nguyen discovered Rachel Mwanza and numerous other child actors for his cast in Kinshasa, DRC, after open auditions. Mwanza had never acted before, and was 15 by September 2012. Nguyen said that \"Rachel was living in the streets before we did the film\". Besides the novice Congolese actors, professional Canadian actors joined the cast.\nMost of War Witch was filmed in the order of the story. It was only the second film shot in the DRC in 25 years, and due to security concerns, the crew was accompanied by soldiers with AK-47s, and insurance was challenging to obtain.\nRelease\nThe film had its debut at the Berlin International Film Festival on 17 February 2012, where it was seen by 1,500 people. Nguyen became the first Canadian to compete for the Silver Bear in 13 years. In the spring, it played in North America for the first time at the Tribeca Film Festival. It also screened from 14 to 15 September at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival.\nIt had a limited release in Toronto and Ottawa on 21 September 2012. At Tribeca, distribution rights were sold for the United States.\nReception\nCritical response\nreceived positive reviews and awards for her performance.]]\nWar Witch has a 94% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 63 reviews, and an average rating of 8/10. The website's critical consensus states: \"War Witch is a mature, intense drama that embraces the bruatlity of its subject and invites the audience to sympathize with its protagonist's nightmarish circumstances\". It also has a score of 84 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 16 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nGuy Dixon, writing for The Globe and Mail, gave the film three stars, saying it transcended war films and Rachel Mwanza gave a great performance. The National Post rated it three stars, declaring it \"a film you won’t be able to look away from no matter how hard you want to\". Jay Stone of The Winnipeg Free Press assessed the film as \"harrowing\" with \"strikingly authentic performances\", including from Mwanza.\nStephen Holden's The New York Times review complimented the film for its portrayal of Komona, lacking luridness or smugness. In Variety, Leslie Felperin said the treatment was appropriately \"harrowing\" for the topic, and positively reviewed Nguyen's aptitude. The Boston Globe's Ty Burr assessed it as \"grim yet clear-eyed, and it seeks out glimmers of hope in individual resilience and in the connections that bind us together\".\nIn The Hollywood Reporter, Deborah Young hailed it as an \"extraordinary story\". University of Berlin film scholar Claudia Kotte wrote War Witch, with Incendies (2010), Monsieur Lazhar (2011) and ''Inch'Allah'' (2012), represent a break from focus in the Cinema of Quebec on local history to more global concerns.\nAccolades\nThe film was Canada's entry in the Best Foreign Language Film category at the 85th Academy Awards. It was a rare Canadian submission for featuring a substantial amount of Lingala as well as French. It was among nine shortlisted in December 2012, and became one of the five nominees. Mwanza received a visa to allow her to attend the Academy Awards. It was the third consecutive Quebec film nominated, following Incendies and Monsieur Lazhar, with Nguyen proclaiming \"People around the world are looking at Quebec cinema now and waiting for the next director to come out of here. This has a tremendous impact on a country’s recognition outside of its borders\".\nThe film was in competition for the Golden Bear at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival in February 2012. It also triumphed at the 1st Canadian Screen Awards, which replaced the Genie Awards that year in honouring Canadian film.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Award\n! scope=\"col\"| Date of ceremony\n! scope=\"col\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" | Academy Awards\n| 24 February 2013\n| Best Foreign Language Film\n| Kim Nguyen\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=2| Berlin International Film Festival\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 9–19 February 2012\n| Silver Bear for Best Actress\n| Rachel Mwanza\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| Ecumenical Jury Special Mention\n| War Witch\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Cambridge Film Festival\n| 13–23 September 2012\n| Audience Award for Best Fiction Feature\n| Kim Nguyen\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=12| Canadian Screen Awards\n| rowspan=\"12\" | 3 March 2013\n| Best Motion Picture\n| Pierre Even, Marie-Claude Poulin\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"12\" |\n|-\n| Best Director\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Kim Nguyen\n|\n|-\n| Best Original Screenplay\n|\n|-\n| Best Actress\n| Rachel Mwanza\n|\n|-\n| Best Supporting Actor\n| Serge Kanyinda\n|\n|-\n| Best Art Direction/Production Design\n| Emmanuel Fréchette, Josée Arsenault\n|\n|-\n| Best Cinematography\n| Nicolas Bolduc\n|\n|-\n| Best Editing\n| Richard Comeau\n|\n|-\n| Best Overall Sound\n| Claude La Haye, Daniel Bisson and Bernard Gariépy Strobl\n|\n|-\n| Best Sound Editing\n| Martin Pinsonnault, Jean-François Sauvé, Simon Meilleur and Claire Pochon\n|\n|-\n| Best Costume Design\n| Éric Poirier\n|\n|-\n| Best Visual Effects\n| Ève Brunet, Marc Morissette and Alexandra Vaillancourt\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" | Independent Spirit Awards\n| February 23, 2013\n| Best International Film\n| Kim Nguyen\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=10| Jutra Awards\n| rowspan=\"10\" | March 2013\n| Best Film\n| Pierre Even and Marie-Claude Poulin\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"10\" |\n|-\n| Best Director\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Kim Nguyen\n|\n|-\n| Best Screenplay\n|\n|-\n| Best Actress\n| Rachel Mwanza\n|\n|-\n| Best Supporting Actor\n| Serge Kanyinda\n|\n|-\n| Best Cinematography\n| Nicolas Bolduc\n|\n|-\n| Best Editing\n| Richard Comeau\n|\n|-\n| Best Sound\n| Claude La Haye, Martin Pinsonnault and Bernard Gariépy Strobl\n|\n|-\n| Best Costume Design\n| Éric Poirier\n|\n|-\n| Best International Motion Picture\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Kim Nguyen\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" | NAACP Image Award\n| 21–22 February 2014\n| Outstanding International Motion Picture\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | Tribeca Film Festival\n| rowspan=\"2\" | April 2012\n| Best Narrative Feature\n| Kim Nguyen\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n| Best Actress\n| Rachel Mwanza\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=3| Vancouver Film Critics Circle\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 2013\n| Best Canadian Film\n| Kim Nguyen\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n| Best Actress in a Canadian Film\n| Rachel Mwanza\n|\n|-\n| Best Supporting Actor in a Canadian Film\n| Serge Kanyinda\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Vancouver International Film Festival\n| September 27–October 12, 2012\n| Best Canadian Feature Film\n| Kim Nguyen\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" | Prix collégial du cinéma québécois\n| 2013\n| Best Film\n| War Witch\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|}\nSee also\n* List of submissions to the 85th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film\n* List of Canadian submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*\n}}"
