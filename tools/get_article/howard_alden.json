Alden has recorded many albums for Concord Records, including four with seven-string guitar innovator George Van Eps.\nEarly life\nHoward Vincent Alden was born in Newport Beach, California, on October 17, 1958. He grew up in Huntington Beach, playing piano, harmonica, the four-string tenor guitar, and then four-string banjo at age ten. After hearing recordings of Barney Kessel, Charlie Christian, Django Reinhardt,  and other jazz guitar greats, he got a six-string guitar and started teaching himself to play. As a teenager he played both instruments at venues in the Los Angeles area. He studied guitar with Jimmy Wyble when he was 16. In 1977–78 he studied jazz guitar at the Guitar Institute of Technology (GIT) in Hollywood with Herb Ellis, Joe Pass, and Howard Roberts. At GIT he assisted Roberts in organizing and preparing curriculum materials. Alden then conducted some of his own classes at GIT.\nMusical career\nAlden made his first trip to the east coast in the summer of 1979, playing in a trio led by vibraphonist Red Norvo for three months at Resorts International in Atlantic City.\nHe moved to New York City in 1982 to play an extended engagement at the Café Carlyle with jazz pianist/songwriter Joe Bushkin. Soon afterwards, he was discovered by Joe Williams and Woody Herman. In 1983 he was already collaborating with Dick Hyman, when he appeared with him and a host of other musicians at Eubie Blake's one-hundredth birthday concert.\nAlden formed the Alden-Barrett Quintet in 1985 with Dan Barrett, which played in the swing idiom, as he has done for most of his career. He also began partnerships with Ruby Braff, Kenny Davern and Jack Lesberg. He joined George Van Eps, innovator of the seven-string guitar, on tour and recorded albums with him, switching to the seven-string himself in 1992.\nWhile in New York doing jazz guitar work, Alden sought out local trad jazz musicians to play tenor banjo with. He used banjo working with Dick Hyman, including a 1989 album of Harry Reser music.  He also played in the New York Banjo Ensemble with Eddy Davis and Cynthia Sayer, and after moving to Arizona he performed and recorded with The Great Banjo Summit.\nSweet and Lowdown\nAlden recorded the guitar performances for Sean Penn's character Emmet Ray in Woody Allen's 1999 film Sweet and Lowdown, and taught Penn how to mime the performances for the film. The score also featured Bucky Pizzarelli on rhythm guitar and arrangements by pianist Dick Hyman.\nIn 2015 Howard married dancer/costume designer Diane Garcia, and has happily made the southwest his home and base for their musical travels and adventures.\nAwards\n* Best Emerging Guitar Talent, JazzTimes (1990)\n* Talent Deserving Wider Recognition,  Down Beat (1992, 1993, 1995, 1996)\n* Guitar Player of the Year, American Guitar Museum (2003)\n* Top 75 Guitarists,  Down Beat (2008)\nDiscography\nAs leader\n* Early Indications (self-released, 1972)\n* Swing Street with Dan Barrett (Concord Jazz, 1988)\n* Swinging into Prominence with Norris Turney, Jake Hanna (Famous Door, 1988)\n* No Amps Allowed with Jack Lesberg (Chiaroscuro, 1988)\n* The Howard Alden Trio Plus Special Guests Ken Peplowski & Warren Vache (Concord Jazz, 1989)\n* The ABQ Salutes Buck Clayton with Dan Barrett (Concord Jazz, 1989)\n* Plays the Music of Harry Reser with Dick Hyman (Stomp Off, 1989)\n* Snowy Morning Blues (Concord Jazz, 1990)\n* 13 Strings with George Van Eps (Concord Jazz, 1991)\n* Misterioso (Concord Jazz, 1991)\n* Hand-Crafted Swing with George Van Eps (Concord Jazz, 1992)\n* Ken Peplowski and Howard Alden (Concord Jazz, 1993)\n* Seven and Seven with George Van Eps (Concord Jazz, 1993)\n* A Good Likeness (Concord Jazz, 1993)\n* Your Story: The Music of Bill Evans with Frank Wess (Concord Jazz, 1994)\n* Encore with Ken Peplowski (Concord Jazz, 1995)\n* Concord Jazz Guitar Collective with Frank Vignola, Jimmy Bruno (Concord Jazz, 1995)\n* ''Keepin' Time with George Van Eps (Concord Jazz, 1996)\n* Take Your Pick (Concord Jazz, 1997)\n* Full Circle with Jimmy Bruno, Joe Pass, Ray Brown (Concord 1998)\n* Love with Terrie Richards Alden (Nagel-Heyer, 2001)\n* My Shining Hour (Concord Jazz, 2002)\n* Soulmates with Butch Miles (Nagel-Heyer, 2002)\n* In a Mellow Tone with Bucky Pizzarelli (Concord Jazz, 2003)\n* Live in '95 with Dan Barrett (Arbors, 2004)\n* Live at Lewes with Geoff Simkins, Simon Woolf, Steve Brown (Woolfnotes, 2006)\n* Pow-Wow with Ken Peplowski (Arbors, 2008)\n* I Remember Django (Arbors, 2010)\n* A Splendid Trio with Scott Hamilton, Frank Tate (Arbors, 2011)\n* Solo Guitar (K2B2, 2014)\n* The Happenings: Music of Herbie Nichols with Marty Krystall, Buell Neidlinger (K2B2, 2017)\n* The Great Banjo Summit and Other Things with Strings (New Vintage Music, 2018)\nAs sideman or guest\nWith Ruby Braff\n* Me, Myself and I (Concord Jazz, 1989)\n* Bravura Eloquence (Concord Jazz, 1990)\n* Volume One (Concord Jazz, 1991)\n* Volume Two (Concord Jazz, 1992)\n* Cornet Chop Suey (Concord Jazz, 1994)\n* As Time Goes By...
