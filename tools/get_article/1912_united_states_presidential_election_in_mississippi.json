Mississippi voters chose ten representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nMississippi was won by the Princeton University President Woodrow Wilson (D–Virginia), running with governor of Indiana Thomas R. Marshall, with 88.90% of the popular vote against the 26th president of the United States Theodore Roosevelt (P–New York), running with governor of California Hiram Johnson, with 5.50% of the popular vote.\nMississippi was one of the states in the 1912 United States presidential election where the sitting U.S. president William Howard Taft came in fourth place due to the hatred of the Republican Party in the south. Louisiana and neighboring Mississippi were the only two states that voted more Republican than they did in 1908.\nResults\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Mississippi\nReferences"
