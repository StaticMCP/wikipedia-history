However, an injury sustained by Ward originally postponed the bout for 4 weeks. The injury was more severe than originally thought and led to the cancellation of the fight as well as the subsequent retirement of Pavlik.\nOn March 23, the WBC stripped Ward of the WBC super-middleweight title belt for being inactive and for failing to face a mandatory challenger. Ward stated that he did not believe the WBC had the right to strip him of the world title because he was willing and able to defend it within the period specified by the WBC's rules. Wouls spend most of 2013 recovering from injuries and feuding with his promoter Dan Goossen, before signing to face unbeaten contender Edwin Rodríguez on 16 November, 14 months after the Dawson fight.\nRodríguez forfeited 20% of his career-high $1 million purse after weighing in 2 lbs over the super middleweight limit. As such Ward's world titles were no longer on the line.\nThe fight\nThe fight started as roughhouse affair with much brawling on the inside until referee Jack Reiss penalized both fighters two points each and warning them that he would end the fight if it did not clean up. Ward went on to dominate the rest of the fight. The three judges scored the fight 118–106, 117–107, and 116–108 all in favour of Ward.\nAftermath\nAfter this win Ward spend the next 19 months inactive.\nUndercard\nConfirmed bouts:\nBroadcasting\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! align=center | Country\n! align=center | Broadcaster\n|-\n|  || Sport 1\n|-\n|  || Polsat\n|-\n|  || BoxNation\n|-\n|  || HBO\n|}\nReferences"
