The village is a short distance from Hampden House, originally owned by John Hampden and a further distance from Chequers, the country residence of the Prime Minister.\nThe village has an annual fete which is usually held on the first weekend of July and a bi-annual arts festival which consists of entertainment shows, a theatre production and general activities on Speen Playing Field.\nHistory\nThe village name originates from Anglo Saxon. The exact meaning is unclear, but possibly meaning 'wood-chip place'. The name of the village corresponds to the location of the hamlet in the Chiltern Forest where trees were regularly felled.\nThe Baptist church was built by men of the village in 1802. The flints were apparently collected in their aprons by local women from surrounding fields, helped by their children. It is a Grade II listed building.\nSurrounding Lands and Population\nThe village is in the style of a traditional 18th century village. Its surroundings consists of a mixture of woodland and agricultural fields. Due to the geographical location of the village no railway station was built. There are approximately 165 houses in the village which had a population at the time of the 2011 census of 637 and has an estimated population of 654 in 2019.\nSpeen Festival\nThe village hosts the Speen Festival, a culture and arts festival, in the September of odd-numbered years.\nThe first Speen Festival, in 2001, was based on a festival called The Leaves of Time, held in 1999 to celebrate the passing of the millennium.\nNotable residents\n* In 1928 the artist Eric Gill moved to Pigotts at Speen, where he set up a printing press, and lettering workshop and alternative community.
