Grant, formerly the 6th Commanding General of the United States Army (R-Illinois), running with Speaker of the House Schuyler Colfax, with 68.43% of the popular vote, against the 18th governor of New York, Horatio Seymour (D–New York), running with former Senator Francis Preston Blair Jr., with 31.57% of the vote.\nWith 68.43% of the popular vote, Tennessee would be Grant's fourth strongest victory in terms of popular vote percentage after Vermont, Massachusetts and Kansas.\nThis was the last presidential election in which Tennessee would back the Republican nominee until 1920.\nResults\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Tennessee\nReferences"
