He was the great grandson of Mayflower Pilgrim Edward Winslow. During Father Rale's War, Winslows older brother Josiah was given the command of Fort St. George (Thomaston, Maine) and was killed by natives of the Wabanaki Confederacy in the Northeast Coast Campaign (1724).  He was also the father of loyalist Edward Winslow.\nHe was originally from Plymouth and became the Clerk of the Court, Register of Probate, and Collector of the Port. He built his home in 1754 in Plymouth, which is now preserved as a museum.\nWinslow was buried with great honor.  His pall-bearers included Sir John Wentworth, General Edmund Fanning, Lt. Governor John Parr, Hon. Arthur Goold, Brigadier-General John Small, Hon. Judge Foster Hutchinson and Henry Lloyd.  He is buried in the Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia). His tombstone is inscribed in part \"his fortune suffered shipwreck in the storm of civil war\", the \"civil war\" being the American Revolution in which American Patriots were fighting American Loyalists.\nSee also\n*Nova Scotia in the American Revolution\nReferences"
