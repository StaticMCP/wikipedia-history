While the negotiations for the Peace of Westphalia were proceeding, Sweden took the opportunity to mount one last campaign into Bohemia. The main result, and probably the main aim, was to loot the fabulous art collection assembled in Prague Castle by Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor (1552–1612), the pick of which was taken down the Elbe in barges and shipped to Sweden.\nAfter occupying the castle and the western bank of the Vltava for some months, the Swedes stopped assaulting the Old and New Town at the eastern bank when news of the signing of the treaty reached them. They still remained a garrison on the western bank until their final withdrawal on 30 September 1649.\nIt was the last major clash of the Thirty Years' War, taking place in the city of Prague, where the war originally began 30 years earlier.\nOverview\nGeneral Hans Christoff von Königsmarck, commanding Sweden's flying column, entered the city, which was defended by the Governor Feldmarschall Rudolf von Colloredo, a veteran of the siege of Mantua and of the battle of Lutzen, where he served under Albrecht von Wallenstein. The Swedes, by a sudden night raid targeting a wall deemed weak due to ongoing construction, managed to enter the whole part of Prague on the western bank of the Vltava river – i.e., Prague Castle and quarters Hradčany and Lesser Town. They then rushed to Strahovská gate, where they killed the guards and opened the gate, allowing Königsmark and other Swedish divisions to easily enter the town. Two days later, they attempted to enter the Old Town on the eastern bank of the river, but were repulsed on the Charles Bridge by Colloredo's men. When a third Swedish army commanded by Prince Carl Gustaf came close to Prague (25 September), all three Swedish armies launched a number of attacks against the city – not only from the west, via the Charles Bridge, but also from the north (bombardment from the Letná Plain) and especially from the eastern plains, towards another city quarter, the New Town. These attacks were repelled largely thanks to the skill of the Feldmarschall and the energy of his troops, as well as the fierce resistance of the burghers' militia and student volunteer troops (Academic Legion) under Czech Jesuit priest Jiří Plachý and German priest jurist Hans Georg Kauffer.\nSack of Prague\nThe looting of Lesser town, Hrad town, and the castle began immediately after the assault on the left bank had begun; some historians have argued that this was the main purpose of the raid. Many of the treasures collected by Emperor Rudolf II (such as the Codex Gigas and Codex Argenteus) were taken to Sweden, where some can be found in Drottningholm Palace, for example, several statues by Adrien de Vries. However, before these could be taken to northern Germany, they had to wait for peacetime. Not all treasure made it to Stockholm either; many ordinary soldiers managed to take treasures. The cream of the artworks were taken into exile by Christina, Queen of Sweden (r. 1632–1654), and dispersed in groups after her death in 1689, the paintings forming the core of the Orleans Collection, which was sold in London after the French Revolution, so that many of Rudolf's paintings are now in the United Kingdom. A Swedish inventory of 1652 lists 472 paintings as having come from Prague.\nMonuments\nOn the Old Town Square a Marian column was erected to remember the salvation of Prague.\nA monument erected during the 19th century on Colloredo's tomb in the Church of the Maltese Order in Prague recalls his victory over the Swedes. Its German inscription reads thus:\nHIER RUHT RUDOLF GRAF COLLOREDO\nK.K. FELDMARSCHALL UND MALTHESERORDER GROSSPRIOR\nVertheidiger der Alt und Neusstad Prags gegen die Schweden\nGeb. am 2 Nov. 1585\nGest. am 27 Jan. 1657.\n(\"Here lies Rudolf, count Colloredo,\nImperial and Royal Feldmarshall and Grand Prior of the Order of Malta,\ndefender of the Old and New Town of Prague against the Swedes.\nBorn 2. Nov. 1585\nDead 27 Jan. 1657\")\nOn Charles Bridge tower a 17th-century Latin inscription says:\nSISTE VIATOR, SED LUBENS, AC VOLENS UBI SISTERE DEBUIT, SED COACTUS GOTHORUM, AC VANDALORUM FUROR\n\"Rest here, walker, and be happy: you can stop here willing, but unwilling were stopped the Goths (Swedes) and their Vandalic ferocity\"\nNotes"
