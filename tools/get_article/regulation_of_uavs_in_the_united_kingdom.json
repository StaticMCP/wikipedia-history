Further:\n* Follow the manufacturer's instructions.\nOn 20 February 2019, the Department for Transport announced legislation to extend the ‘no-fly’ zone around airports, banning drones from flying within 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) of runways.\nOperators of drones and model aircraft must obtain an 'Operator' ID and 'Flyer ID' from the Civil Aviation Authority before using their drone, which are awarded together after passing an online theory test. Children under the age of 18 cannot obtain an Operator ID, though they can be registered as flyers of their parent or legal guardian's drone by passing the same theory test and receiving a Flyer ID. After passing the theory test, all drones must display the owner's Operator ID when in operation. Flyer IDs must be renewed every three years, while Operator IDs must be renewed annually.\nCategories of Operations\nOpen Category (for low-risk, non-commercial flights)\n{|class=wikitable\n!Sub-category!!Weight range!!Requirements\n|-\n|A1 — Fly Over People||Less than 250 g||May be flown without specific permission from the CAA provided the pilot follows the manufacturer's operating instructions.\n|-\n|A2 — Fly Close to People||Between 250 g and 2 kg||Operators must complete the CAA's online theory test and comply with the relevant operational restrictions.\n|-\n|A3 — Fly Far from People||Over 2 kg but less than 25 kg||May only be operated in designated areas approved by the CAA, and require specific operational authorisation.\n|}\nKey Rules for Open Category\n* Maintain Visual Line of Sight (VLOS): The drone must be kept within the operator's direct line of sight during flight. The use of binoculars or visual aids is not permitted. A maximum horizontal range of 500 metres from the operator must be adhered to.\n* Observe Altitude Limits: In order to prevent interference with manned aircraft, flights above 120 metres (400 feet) ground level are not permitted.\n* Avoid Restricted Airspace: Stay clear of airports, airfields, and other controlled or restricted zones unless you have explicit permission.\n* Fly Safely and Responsibly: Do not fly near people, animals, or vehicles in a way that could pose a risk. Flying within 50 metres of uninvolved people is not permitted, except during take off and landing, when the required distance is 30 metres.\n* Register with the CAA: Drones over 250 g must be registered with the Civil Aviation Authority, and operators must obtain an Operator ID.\n* Complete Required Online Training: If flying in the A2 or A3 subcategories, you must pass the Civil Aviation Authority's online theory test and obtain a flyer ID.\n* Respect Privacy Laws: Be aware of and comply with privacy and data protection regulations when recording photos or videos in public or private spaces.\nSpecific Category (for higher-risk or commercial flights)\nThe specific category covers more complex UAVs operations that fall outside the standard limitations of the Open Category. These flights often involve drones weighing over 2 kg, or situations where restrictions of the A2 subcategory are too limiting. This category is for operators who intend to fly under the following conditions:\n* Conducting flights over crowds or large gatherings.\n* Dropping objects or spraying substances (such as for agricultural use).\n* Operating heavier drones (weighing more than 500 g) in close proximity (less than 50 metres during flight or 30 metres during take off and landing) to people, including in residential or built-up areas.\n* Flights exceeding 120 metres (400 feet) above ground level.\n* Flights exceeding the maximum horizontal range of 500 metres from the operator.\n* Flights outside of the visual line of sight of the operator.\nOperating under this category requires specific authorisation from the Civil Aviation Authority, which sets out the precise conditions and safety requirements for each mission.\nCertified Category (for the highest-risk drones)\nThe certified category is designated for drones used in commercial aviation. For example:\n* Operating an unmanned aircraft with a span or dimension of 3 metres or more over crowds or large gatherings.\n* Transporting people using an unmanned aircraft.\n* Carrying dangerous goods that would pose a significant risk to third parties in the event of an accident.\nFull certification and approval from the CAA is required to operate under this category.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.caa.co.uk/default.aspx?catid=1995&pagetype=90/ UK CAA Regulations and Overview]\n* [https://dronesafe.uk/drone-code/ Drone Safe]"
