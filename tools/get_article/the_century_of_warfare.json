Some of the material is highly complex...and the documentary does a very creditable job of presenting the facts and background information in a comprehensible manner. The Century of Warfare sets out on an ambitious program and lives up to its billing, offering an insightful and thorough look at the violent 20th century.\"\nNeutral\n\"While it was certainly a monumental task to edit all of the footage together, that is all it is: a patchwork.  Nothing new is offered:  no tours of battlefields, or anything that would bring it to life.  Naturally the film quality is poor due to its age, but images shown were clearly selected for their historical relevance to the narration, not their cinematography, and they are indeed excellent images.\"\n\"Certainly, this is a fine introduction to a vast subject and does a sturdy job of describing and explicating on a certain level. But, some matters are oversimplified and ultimately the result is less than satisfactory. However, anyone who views parts of this documentary and then goes on to read more about the Holocaust, the politics of nuclear war and the misuses of power in the pursuit of political domination will count as a victory for the producers.\"\nNegative\n\"You will find few war stories...interesting in The Century of Warfare, an interminable series from the History Channel. A low-budget 1993 British production that relies on public domain footage, library music, and a monotonous British narrator with a soporific voice, this 26-episode series somehow manages to make one of the most inherently interesting subjects stunningly pedestrian and dull.\"\nThe episode dealing with the events of 1943-45 (Episode 14) on the Balkan peninsula and the area of Yugoslavia may have several errors, namely Josip Broz Tito was not Serbian but rather born to Croatian and Slovenian parents, the Chetnik movement was not based in Croatia but in Serbia, and the flag colours depicting the partisans were incorrect.\nDVD\n*US Release Date: 24 June 2003\n*Number of discs: 7\n*Rating: NR (Not Rated)\n*Studio: A&E Home Video\n*Aspect Ratio: 1.33:1\n*Run Time: 1350 minutes\nThe DVD Bonus Documentary, although credited as 1994, includes information up to the capture of Saddam Hussein in December 2003, as well as the Madrid train bombings of 11 March 2004. It was narrated by Gerrard McArthur, and unlike the rest of the series, used computer simulations to recreate battles.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
