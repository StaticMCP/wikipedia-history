It was born in the University of Lisbon, Portugal, by the DIALNP research group that is hosted in the LaSIGE research unit.\nComponents\nAppia is composed by a core that is used to compose protocols, and a set of protocols that provide group communication, ordering guarantees, atomic broadcast, among other properties.\nCore\nThe Appia core offers a clean way for the application to express inter-channel constraints. This feature is obtained as an extension to the functionality provided by current systems. Thus, Appia retains a flexible and modular design that allows communication stacks to be composed and reconfigured in run-time.\nProtocols\nThe existing protocols include interface with TCP and UDP sockets, virtual synchrony, several implementations of total order, causal order, among others.\nSee also\n* Protocol stack\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
