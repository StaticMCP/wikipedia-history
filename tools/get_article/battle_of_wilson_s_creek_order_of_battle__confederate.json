Though identified with the Confederates, the Missouri State Guard were technically an independent army, as Missouri had not yet seceded, and were not folded into the Confederate Army of the West until March 17, 1862. Though identified with the Confederates, the Arkansas State Troops were technically not yet Confederate troops. Arkansas had seceded on May 6, 1861, and been recognized as a Confederate State, but Brigadier General Nichols Pearce's troops had not been transferred from the State of Arkansas to the Confederate Government and had not been sworn into Confederate Service. After the battle, Pearce's troops voted to disband rather than enter Confederate Service.\nThe Union order of battle is shown separately.\nAbbreviations used\nMilitary rank\n* BG = Brigadier General\n* Col = Colonel\n* Ltc = Lieutenant Colonel\n* Maj = Major\n* Cpt = Captain\nOther\n* k = killed\n* w = wounded\nConfederate Forces at Wilson's Creek\nBG Benjamin McCulloch\nWestern Army\nBG Benjamin McCulloch\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=25% | Brigade\n!
