The largest surge occurred immediately following the German invasion of the Netherlands from 10 to 15 May 1940. During this period, 388 individuals committed suicide, with hundreds more attempting to do so. The majority of these suicides, 211 in total, were among the Jewish population. The implementation of measures against Jews, particularly the deportations, contributed to subsequent peaks in suicide rates. Around the end of the war, at least 113 collaborators committed suicide in the Netherlands.\nMay 1940\n211 Jews committed suicide in May 1940. Notable Jews who committed suicide during these periods included Emanuel Boekman, Jacob van Gelderen and Louis Fles.\n177 of those who committed suicide were not of Jewish decent. Among them were Menno ter Braak and Willem Adriaan Bonger.\nCollaborators\nIn the period 1944–1947, 113 collaborators have been identified who committed suicide. Notable examples were Meinoud Rost van Tonningen and Robert van Genechten.\nSee also\n* Mass suicides in Nazi Germany\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\nCitations\nNotes"
