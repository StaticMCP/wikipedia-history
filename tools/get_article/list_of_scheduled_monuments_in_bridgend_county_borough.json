      "text": "# List of scheduled monuments in Bridgend County Borough\n\nBridgend County Borough stretches from the south coast of Wales up to the southern edge of the Brecon Beacons. The 57 scheduled monuments cover over 4,000 years of the history of this part of South Wales. There are chambered tombs of the Neolithic, and burial cairns and standing stones of the Bronze Age, Iron Age hillforts, and a Roman villa. Four early medieval sites and 23 from the medieval post-Norman period cover defences, dwellings, stones and churches. Finally the modern period, beginning with an Elizabethan manor house, marks 400 years of industrial history, and ends at defenses from World War II. All of the sites on this list (and the whole of Bridgend County Borough) are within the historic county of Glamorgan.\nScheduled monuments have statutory protection. The compilation of the list is undertaken by Cadw Welsh Historic Monuments, which is an executive agency of the National Assembly of Wales. The list of scheduled monuments below is supplied by Cadw with additional material from RCAHMW and Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust.\nScheduled monuments in Bridgend\n{| class=\" wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" border=\"1\" style=\"width:101%; margin-right:0; margin-left:0\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Image\n!scope=\"col\" |Name\n!scope=\"col\" |Site type\n!scope=\"col\" |Community\n!scope=\"col\"|Location\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Details\n!scope=\"col\" |Period\n!scope=\"col\" |SAM No& Refs\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|Coity Burial Chamber\n|Chambered tomb\n|Coity Higher\n|, SS926819\n|Ruins of a Neolithic chambered tomb, with four large stone slabs\n|1.2Prehistoric(Neolithic)\n|style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |GM068\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|Tythegston Long Barrow\n|Long barrow\n|Merthyr Mawr\n|, SS864792\n|Chambered tomb toward the east end of a long mound\n|1.2Prehistoric(Neolithic)\n|style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |GM022\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|Ogof y Pebyll Bone Cave\n|Cave\n|Pencoed\n|, SS951807\n|Cave in which have been found flint flakes and the teeth of numerous mammals\n|1.3Prehistoric(Neolithic or Bronze Age?)\n|style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |GM434\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|Bryn Defaid Mound\n|Round cairn\n|Garw Valley\n|, SS888916\n|Bronze Age cairn on the ridge between Maesteg and Blaengarw\n|1.4Prehistoric(Bronze Age)\n|style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |GM249\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|Round Barrow on the Werfa\n|Round barrow\n|Ogmore Valley, (also Garw Valley)\n|, SS913941\n|Round barrow on the crest of the Mynnydd Llangweinwyr ridge\n|1.4Prehistoric(Bronze Age)\n|style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |GM499\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|Bridgend Standing Stone\n|Standing stone\n|Bridgend\n|, SS902795\n|Standing stone with several feint 'cup mark' decorations.
