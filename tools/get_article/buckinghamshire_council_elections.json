A total of 147 councillors were elected, with the 49 wards electing 3 councillors each.\nBackground\nThe inaugural election was supposed to be in May 2020, but was postponed until May 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For this reason, it was announced on 18 March 2020 that all of the current shadow authority members would become councillors and the shadow executive members would form the cabinet. The first election to the new authority was eventually held in May 2021.\nCouncil elections\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=text-align:center\n!rowspan=2|Year\n!width=\"60\"|Con\n!width=\"60\"|LD\n!width=\"60\"|Wycombe Ind.\n!width=\"60\"|Lab\n!width=\"60\"|Ind.
