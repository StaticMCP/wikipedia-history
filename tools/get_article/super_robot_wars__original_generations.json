      "text": "# Super Robot Wars: Original Generations\n\n|genre = Tactical role-playing\n|modes = Single player\n|platforms = PlayStation 2\n}}\nis a 2007 tactical role-playing game for the PlayStation 2. OG is a remake of the two Original Generation games for the Game Boy Advance and is intended to celebrate the Super Robot Wars series' 15th anniversary. It was released on June 28, 2007.\nGameplay\nOG is developed by the team that produced Super Robot Wars MX and uses high-energy, dynamic action for the in-game battle sequences. There are similarities in the user interface and battle screen to the 3rd Super Robot Wars Alpha: To the End of the Galaxy, though it is merely coincidence, as the producing team may have been influenced by the design of Alpha 3.\nThe game includes a new variation of the squad combat system of the 2nd Super Robot Wars Alpha and Alpha 3, called the Twin Battle System. It allows two adjacent units to combine into one squad, which can then attack simultaneously. The units can either focus their fire on a single target (with a damage penalty for the secondary unit) or, when facing another squad, each target a different one of its members. Squads can also support other squads offensively and/or defensively, allowing up to four attacks in a single action. As in the Alpha games, a single unit can also use an ALL attack to strike both members of an enemy squad at once. The game also features new ALLW Attacks, similar to the Double Attacks in MX, which can strike both members of a target squad and a single unit (or squad) directly next to it.\nA small, but significant change in gameplay are the Spirit Commands, character abilities akin to magic spells. All characters retain their set of six Spirit Commands when fighting alone, but when placed into a squad, a seventh Spirit Command is available, known as the Twin Command. This Twin Command, unique to each character, takes SP (Spirit Points) from both characters in the squad, and is generally more powerful than the other Spirit Commands available to them. This makes Original Generations the first game in the franchise to break the six Spirit Command limit.\nChanges and additions\nOriginal Generations is primarily a remake of the two previous Original Generation games, replacing them in the official Original Generation continuity, thereby retconning the Game Boy Advance stories. Parts of the plot in the first Original Generation segment of Original Generations is derived from the animated Super Robot Wars Original Generation: Divine Wars, so as to follow continuity. The game also includes a fair amount of new content.\n*New mechs and characters from new series for the game include the following:\n**Compatible Kaiser, the giant robot from Banpresto's Super Nintendo Entertainment System game, The Great Battle IV (redesigned for the game by Masami Ōbari), as well as its pilot, Fighter Roar.\n***Roar's appearance in Original Generations is believed to be a direct continuation of the plot of The Great Battle IV, with Warrior Roar and the Compatible Kaiser being thrown into the universe of Original Generation. Roar manifests itself inside a human, Kouta Azuma, who transforms into Fighter Roar, using the Roar Armor. Roar, the Compatible Kaiser and Kouta make their playable appearance in the bonus segment.\n**Raul Gureden, the male protagonist of Super Robot Wars R for the Game Boy Advance.\n***Raul appears along with his friends, Raji Montoya and Mizuho Saiki, and pilots the EXF-02 Excellence. Only the Striker, Cosmodriver, and Flyer frames appear in the game. In Original Generation continuity, Fiona Gureden, Raul's female counterpart (also the other playable, selectable protagonist) in Reversal, is actually his (slightly) younger twin sister, and test pilot for the second Excellence unit. The Excellence units and both Raul and Fiona are playable in the Original Generation 2 part of the game. Despinoiz, Lalia and Tiz, the three homunculi of Duminuss, the main antagonist of Reversal, make an appearance in the bonus segment.\n**The bonus segment features the original characters from Super Robot Wars Compact 3.\n***The roster includes Shura King Alkaid Nassh, Shura Advisor Mizal Touval, Freedom Warrior Alion Lucada, Fernando Arduke and his Valefor and Compact 3 protagonist, Folka Albark with his Ialdabaoth. They are the antagonists against Fighter Roar, where Folka is seen working alongside the Shura, making his appearance more-or-less a prequel to the Compact 3 storyline.\n*Additional mecha designed specifically for the game include the following:\n**ART-1 (Advanced Real Personal Trooper Test Type-1; designed by Hajime Katoki)\n***It is an advanced test unit of the Real Personal Trooper Type-1, with the ability to transform into a flight mode, dubbed ART-Wing, piloted by Ryusei Date.

Both units appear in the bonus segment, an adaptation of the OVA's plot. The Mironga's first appearance is in Super Robot Wars Original Generation: The Sound Cinema. Kyle Bean, the pilot of the Mironga in the Sound Cinema, appears as an enemy pilot. The Mironga is available as a secret, playable unit only in the bonus segment.\n**XRAM-006VC Siegerlion\n***A heavily modified version of the DCAM-06C Guarlion Custom owned by Leona Garstein, it features additional technology, customized by Tasuku Shinguji.
