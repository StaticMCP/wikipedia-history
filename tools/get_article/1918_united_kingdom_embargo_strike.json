This was to distribute scarce skilled labor more fairly. This caused controversy, and on 23 July 1918 12,000 members of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers and the Tool-makers, and the Steam Engine Makers went on strike, demanding for this embargo to be removed.\nThen on July 25, the strike expanded to 100,000 munition workers.\nOn Saturday 27 July 1918 the Government issued a warning that the strikers in this strike must return to work, or they would lose their status as essential war workers and thus become liable to be conscripted into the armed forces.\nMany industrial workers outside the Embargo Strike organization were opposed to it and stayed at work in loyalty to the nation's war effort.\nOn Monday 29 July 1918 the strike was called off. There was afterwards a plan for a Government enquiry into the matter.\nReferences"
