However, some evidence and historical accounts indicate that this area was settled about 1100–1150&nbsp;AD, during the Rajput princely era. According to local evidence, there was a pond on the site long before the village was founded. The pond is known as Piparni Nadi or Pipaly Nadi and is regularly replenished with rainwater; so, it became a resting point on the route that was used between two principalities, Shekhawati and Marwar. Evidence shows that when traders, the army, banjaras, or others travelling along this way, they rested and took shelter here, because they always found sweet and clean drinking water for themselves and their animals. So, it was soon called Meethari. Because this was also the entrance to Marwar state, people started to call it Meethari Marwar.\nGeography\nMeethari Marwar village is in Ladnun tehsil of Nagaur district in Rajasthan state.
