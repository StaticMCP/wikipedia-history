Voters chose 10 representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nMississippi voted for the Democratic nominee, Governor Alfred E. Smith of New York, over the Republican nominee, former Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover of California. Smith ran with Senator Joseph Taylor Robinson of Arkansas, while Hoover's running mate was Senate Majority Leader Charles Curtis of Kansas.\nThis was the first election since 1888 that a Republican won any county in Mississippi, and the first time since 1892 that a Democrat would lose any county in the state. Pearl River, Stone County, George County voted Republican for the first time since their creation.\nSmith was a Roman Catholic, a poor fit for the overwhelmingly Protestant Southern states. Despite this, it was widely believed that Republican Herbert Hoover supported integration or at least was not committed to maintaining racial segregation, overcoming opposition to Smith's campaign in the Deep South.\nSmith won Mississippi by a margin of 64.20%. It was his second strongest state, after South Carolina.\nResults\nReferences\nNotes"
