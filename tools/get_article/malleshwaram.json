It was planned in 1889  after the great plague of 1898, developed as a suburb in 1892 and handed over to the city municipality in 1895. As per the 1878 Survey of India map, the area came under the village of Ranganatha Palya  and was later named after the Kadu Malleshwara Temple. The neighbourhood houses many offices, one them being World Trade Center Bengaluru. It has two shopping malls, Mantri Square and Orion Mall (at the two ends of the locality). As an education hub, it houses the education boards of the state KSEEB and PU boards, Mysore Education Society, Institute of Wood Science and Technology and Indian Institute of Science.\nHistory\nThe earlier name of Malleshwaram was Mallapura as documented in the Ekoji Inscription of Malleshwaram dated to 1669 CE located in the precincts of the famous Kadu Malleshwara temple. It records the donation of the Maratha chief Ekoji, half brother of Shivaji who donated a village Medaraninganahalli for the upkeep of the Kadu Malleshwara temple. Medaraninganahalli was a village that was located around the IISc campus. Another undated Kannada inscription in Sampige road was documented in the supplementary Volume 9 of Epigraphia carnatica, it mentions that the inscription was found near Jakkarayanakere which corresponds to the area around Krishna Flour Mill in Sampige Road, Malleshwaram. Much of the text published is incomplete and is a possible donatory inscription. However, the existence of Jakkarayana kere (lake) near Sampige road documented more than a century ago is established.\nH. V. Nanjundaiah, the first Vice-Chancellor of Mysore University is credited with the building of the then suburb of Malleshwaram. The neighbourhood of Malleshwaram has been host to many accomplished people: the Nobel laureate C.V. Raman, scientist Krishnaswamy Kasturirangan, badminton world champion Prakash Padukone and his daughter Deepika Padukone, noted Carnatic musician Doraiswamy Iyengar and film stars Saroja Devi, Ananth Nag and Jaggesh have all lived here.\nMalleshwaram is home to some of Bangalore's heritage cafés such as CTR\nShri Sagar (1920s), Janatha Hotel, Raghvendra Stores, New Krishna Bhavan, Veena Stores, and Snehajeevi Gowdara Egg Rice Adda.\nH.
