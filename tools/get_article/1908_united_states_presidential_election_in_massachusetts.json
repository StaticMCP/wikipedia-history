Voters chose 16 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nMassachusetts overwhelmingly voted for the Republican nominees, Secretary of War William Howard Taft of Ohio and his running mate James S. Sherman of New York. They defeated the Democratic nominees, former U.S. Representative William Jennings Bryan of Nebraska and his running mate John W. Kern of Indiana. Taft won the state by a margin of 24.17%.\nTaft was able to win every county in the state of Massachusetts, including a rare Republican victory in Suffolk County, home to the state's capital and largest city, Boston, although Bryan did narrowly win the city of Boston. Bryan had previously lost Suffolk County in 1896 but won it in his rematch with William McKinley in 1900. Bryan had also previously lost Massachusetts to McKinley in both 1896 and 1900, respectively.\nThis was the last election in which the town of Hyde Park participated in, as it was annexed by the city of Boston in 1912, ahead of that year's election.\nResults\n}}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Massachusetts\nReferences"
