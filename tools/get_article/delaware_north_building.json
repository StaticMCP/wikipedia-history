The 12-story, 330,000-square-foot mixed-use building features Class A office space, a 120-room Westin hotel, ground level retail, a 7,000-square-foot outdoor courtyard, and an adjacent structured parking ramp. Delaware North's World Headquarters anchors the building.\nConstruction\nThe new building replaces the two-story Delaware Court building (1917–2014) at the northwest corner of Delaware Avenue and Chippewa Street and occupies a 1.95-acre site. The new building replicates the iconic curved façade of the old, using terracotta features of the original structure. The building features 193,000 sq ft of class A office space on the sixth through 12th floors, a 116-room hotel occupying 104,000 sq ft, 18,000 sq ft of retail space, and indoor parking for 593 vehicles in a five-level attached parking ramp. The building's 2,600-square-foot lobby features the largest living green wall in Western New York, a 22&nbsp;ft × 21&nbsp;ft expanse of plants providing beauty, improving indoor air quality, and reducing energy use. In 2019, the building received a LEED Silver certification from the U.S. Green Building Council.\nOperations\nThe Delaware North Building serves as headquarters for namesake company Delaware North, which also operates a 116-room Westin hotel and Patina 250 restaurant within the building. Other tenants include KeyBank offices and retail branch, UBS Financial Services, the Department of Homeland Security, the Cullen Foundation, and Osteopathic Wellness Medicine.\nExternal links\n* [http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=100463 Skyscraperpage building page]\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150327100601/http://www.workzonecam.com/projects/joecascio/joecascio/workzonecam Live camera feed of building]\n* [http://uniland.com/Properties/250delaware.aspx 250 Delaware Avenue Property Page]\n* [https://vimeo.com/163543244 Time-lapse installation by Botanicus]\nGallery\nFile:Delaware court2.JPG|Previous building Delaware court building (2013 photo)\nFile:250 Delaware ave dec2014.JPG|Under construction (2014)\nFile:250 Delaware ave rear.JPG|Rear of building\nFile:250 Delaware ave terra cotta.JPG|Terracotta of 250 Delaware Ave\nFile:ChippewaStreet.jpg|Night view from Chippewa st.\nSee also\n*LECOM Harborcenter\n*The Avant\n*List of tallest buildings in Buffalo, New York\nReferences"
