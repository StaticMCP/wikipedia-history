The contest was held on Super Tuesday alongside primaries in 14 other states and territories.  This was a semi-closed primary where party members may only vote in their respective party's primary, but unenrolled voters may choose a party's primary to participate in. This change in law from Maine's previous closed primary went into effect on May 14, 2022, without Gov. Janet Mills' signature.\nBiden won in a landslide, with some opposition from Philips, who won almost 7% of the vote.\nCandidates\nThe filing deadline was December 1. Two candidates met the requirements to appear on the ballot:\n* Joe Biden\n* Dean Phillips\nWrite-in campaign\nThe Maine Coalition for Palestine launched an effort to convince voters to write-in \"Ceasefire\" in the primary, drawing inspiration from a similar campaign in New Hampshire and the success of the campaign for uncommitted votes in Michigan. However, as Maine state law only requires that votes for declared write-in candidates be tallied, these votes will be counted as blank ballots.\nEndorsements\n}}\nPolling\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;\"\n|- valign=bottom\n!

Phillips secured the second place in Franklin, Kennebec and Oxford counties, while falling to the third in the other thirteen.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! County\n! Biden\n! Phillips\n!

Both he and blank votes performed better in the smaller, more urban first district, while Phillips recorded a better result in the larger, more rural second district, which was also the only one in New England to back Donald Trump in 2020.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
