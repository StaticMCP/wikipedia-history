      "text": "# Back to Mine: Nick Warren\n\nBack to Mine: Nick Warren is a DJ mix album, the first in the Back to Mine series, compiled and mixed by Nick Warren.\nThe mix focuses on downtempo tracks, with Allmusic calling it \"a smart and non-confrontational mix safe from predawn noise complaints\". CMJ New Music Report called it a \"felicitous cocktail of psilocybin and mescaline\".\nIain Stewart, in The Rough Guide to Ibiza and Formentera, viewed Warren's mix as one of the best in the series.\nTrack listing\nReferences"
