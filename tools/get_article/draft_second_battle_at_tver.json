It took place on July 15, 1609, two days after a previous battle that had no decisive outcome. The battle resulted in a joint Swedish-Russian victory over the Polish-Lithuanian forces. However, despite this victory, the Swedish forces were unable to capture the city following the battle.\nReferences"
