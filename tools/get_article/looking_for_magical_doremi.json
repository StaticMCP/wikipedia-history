The film is directed by  and Junichi Sato. The events of the film are set in modern-day Japan and star Aoi Morikawa, Rena Matsui, and Kanako Momota in the roles of three women of different backgrounds who grew up watching Ojamajo Doremi. The film was first screened at the 33rd Tokyo International Film Festival on November 3 before being released to the general public on November 13, 2020.\nPlanning for the film began in September 2016, with the project formally announced in March 2019. Aiming for an adult female audience outside of Ojamajo Doremi fans, Toei Animation focused on the various common struggles Japanese women face in their daily lives, with each main character representing a particular generation. Upon release, Looking for Magical Doremi was praised for its themes of rediscovering the joys of life in adulthood through childhood. The film won Best Animation Film Award at the 75th Mainichi Film Awards.\nPlot\nis one of the locations that Sore, Mire, Reika, and Omiya visit in the final third of Looking for Magical Doremi, as the location was featured in episode 11 of Ojamajo Doremi Dokkān!]]\nThe film is centered on three women who grew up watching Ojamajo Doremi in their childhood: Sora Nagase, a 22-year-old college student whose parents are pressuring her to become a teacher; Mire Yoshizuki, a 27-year-old career-oriented office worker returning from overseas; and Reika Kawatani, a 20-year-old freeter. Sora is concerned about Yūji Makita, a student with a learning disability at the school she interns at; despite having her dream job, Mire feels disrespected by her managers; and Reika's boyfriend, Seiya Kubo, keeps stealing her savings for college. One day, Sora becomes curious when she hears rumors about a Western-style building located in Kamakura that served as the basis for the Mahodo, a magic shop featured in Ojamajo Doremi. When she visits, she meets Mire and Reika, who explore the building with her. That evening, the women bond over having watched Ojamajo Doremi when they were younger and the magic bead toys from the show. The women return home, but keep in contact.\nAs their daily lives become stressful, Sora invites Mire and Reika to visit Aichi Prefecture for Golden Week. There, the women go sightseeing in Hida-Takayama, the location where the film Ojamajo Doremi: The Secret of the Frog Stone takes place. At night, while discussing concerns from their daily lives, Reika confides in them that her father left after her parents divorced when she was in high school, with her mother dying two years later. On the third day of their trip, Mire suggests Reika make a wish on her magic bead to reunite with her father. The three are led to a hospital trying to retrieve her bead after she drops it. There, Reika sees her father with a new family while he pretends he does not know her. Mire chides Reika for not being assertive, but this causes Reika to become angry and return to Onomichi alone. That night, Mire stays at Sora's house and reflects on her actions after watching episode 19 of Ojamajo Doremi Sharp, where Doremi and Hazuki get into a fight. She then personally goes to Onomichi to apologize and manages to find Reika's apartment through the  shop that she works at. Upon finding Reika, Mire saves her from Seiya when he extorts her for money, with Reika finally breaking up with him. The two restore their friendship as Reika reveals that her magic bead was given to her by her father. Mire invites her to move in to help her pursue her studies.\nTired of being treated poorly at her job, Mire decides to quit and later learns that her co-worker, Hayato Yabe, has feelings for her. Meanwhile, Yūji is enrolled into a special education school, and Sora helps him successfully, gaining motivation to study for her teaching exams. By summer, the three women go to Nara and Kyoto, where two episodes of Ojamajo Doremi Dokkān! take place. While on the train, the women befriend Ryuichi Omiya, a college student. After noticing he has a keyholder of Onpu, they discover he is also a fan of Ojamajo Doremi and he comes along their trip as their guide. Sora falls in love with Omiya and confesses to him during their final day in Kyoto, but he rejects her. Despite this, at night, the three women realize the importance of moving forward, which they have understood since reconnecting with Ojamajo Doremi. Together, the three make a wish upon their magic beads as if to cast Magical Stage, concluding that they have magic in themselves.\nThree months after their trip, Sora, Mire, and Reika rent the building in Kamakura to open it under the name Café MAHODO as the culmination of all their dreams combined. They see a silhouette running in the halls in the process, and after giving chase, they find Doremi, Hazuki, Aiko, Onpu, Momoko, and Pop.\nCast\n* Aoi Morikawa as , a 22-year-old college student from Aichi Prefecture in her fourth year who watched the original broadcast of Ojamajo Doremi Dokkān! as a child.\n* Rena Matsui as , a 27-year-old career-oriented office worker from Tokyo who grew up overseas and first watched Ojamajo Doremi on DVD.\n* Kanako Momota as , a 20-year-old freeter from Hiroshima who watched re-runs of Ojamajo Doremi; while she was in high school, her father left her family after her parents' divorce and her mother died two years later.\n* Shohei Miura as , a fourth-year college student who meets the three women during their road trip and is a fan of Ojamajo Doremi, particularly Onpu.

Other voice actors who had recurring roles in Ojamajo Doremi, including Hyosei, Ai Nagano, , , , Kenji Nomura, , Kyousei Tsukui, , , and Yūta Mochizuki also make voice cameos.\nProduction\nDevelopment\nThe film project was first announced at AnimeJapan 2019 on March 23, 2019 to celebrate the franchise's 20th anniversary. On October 29, 2019, the production team revealed at the 32nd Tokyo International Film Festival that the film would be titled Looking for Magical Doremi and its story details, as well as announcing that staff members who worked on Ojamajo Doremi would be returning for the project, including director Junichi Sato, scriptwriter  (credited under the pseudonym Midori Kuriyama), character designer Yoshihiko Umakoshi, and producer Hiromi Seki. Pretty Cure writer  was also announced as a co-director of the film.\nSato and Seki began planning for the film project around September 2016. Sato was initially going to have the film centered on Doremi and the other main characters of the original anime as adults, with a \"miracle\" happening through a time paradox. After pitching the idea to Umakoshi, Umakoshi suggested focusing on a wider age appeal; he voiced concerns that since Doremi and her classmates were the same age, this would alienate viewers who would not relate to the characters due to not being in the same age range. Similarly, Yamada, who also wrote the Ojamajo Doremi 16 light novel series, elaborated that an earlier idea for the film would be about a 20-year-old Doremi trying to dig up a time capsule she and her friends buried during their elementary school graduation ceremony, only to find that it is missing, starting a search of what happened on the day it disappeared. He stated that while the story would have appealed to fans of Ojamajo Doremi, it would not have appealed to a general audience. Seki then researched concerns that from women in their 20s would have about their daily lives in order to find common ground. After agreeing to focus on a general audience instead of only Ojamajo Doremi fans, the staff created Sora, Mire, and Reika as the main characters with varying ages to show their generational differences. Approximately 100 women and men participated in the survey and the results were given to Yamada.\nYamada stated that Sora, Mire, and Reika were not based on anyone, and that each character borrowed traits from the main characters of Ojamajo Doremi: Sora wore glasses like Hazuki and had Doremi's \"teacher\" personality; Mire had Onpu's outspoken personality and was also a returnee like Momoko; and Reika had Aiko's responsible personality, Hana's face, and a tendency to fall in love with terrible men like Doremi. In comparison to Ojamajo Doremi's child-friendly setting, Looking for Magical Doremi contained eight scenes where the characters are drinking alcohol at a bar instead of coffee at a café. Seki noted that the setting felt natural as the characters were adults, especially Mire, who is often stressed with her job. Seki also came up with the idea that Mire's apartment is messy.\nFor Ojamajo Doremi, instead of using \"light and cute\" backgrounds that were expected for children's television shows, Sato opted to use \"heavier tones\" of color to create a more \"mature taste\" that would \"bring more depth to the world.\" Looking for Magical Doremi kept the same art scheme of not being too dark or too light. The art team also tried to keep balance between \"picturesque\" backgrounds and realism, but because Looking for Magical Doremi is set in the real world and in a separate setting from Ojamajo Doremi, the film leaned more on realism. In addition, Sato revealed that the dandelion motif present in Ojamajo Doremi and Looking for Magical Doremi was a nod to Yume no Crayon Oukoku, which Sato, Kuriyama, and Seki had worked on prior to Ojamajo Doremi, as the show had ended with a piece of fluff flying in the sky.\nVoice work for the film concluded in September 2020. The original six voice actresses of Ojamajo Doremi attended the final day of recording to record their lines for the final scene after Morikawa, Matsui, and Momota recorded their lines. During that time, Nami Miyahara coached Rena Matsui with her English lines, as her character, Mire, was described to be from overseas. On October 1, 2020, a promotional event was held at Marunouchi Toei announcing that production of the film had concluded.\nCasting\nIn February 2020, Toei announced that the starring cast consisted of Aoi Morikawa as Sora Nagase, Rena Matsui as Mire Yoshizuki, and Momoiro Clover Z member Kanako Momota as Reika Kawatani. Additional cast members were announced in March 2020, consisting of Shohei Miura as Ryuichi Omiya, Akira Ishida as Hayato Yabe, and Kenta Hamano as Seiya Kubo, who play three male characters involved with the main characters' lives.\nFor the starring cast, the production staff decided to choose actors and actresses who had grown up watching Ojamajo Doremi. Morikawa caught the attention of the staff after posting about the film project's announcement on social media. Hiromi Seki had personally sent a letter to Morikawa after seeing her acting in the live-action television drama adaptation of Kakafukaka and envisioned Sora to be like the character she portrayed. Likewise, Miura, who had also watched Ojamajo Doremi when he was young, mentioned the film's announcement on social media and his radio show, after which he later heard he had received an offer. He stated that, like his character Ryuichi Omiya, Onpu was his favorite character from the series, which Seki confirmed was coincidental.\nAs Morikawa had no voice acting experience prior, Sato and Kamatani provided her with examples and techniques on how to convey emotions through her voice. Likewise, Matsui visited one of Akira Ishida's recording sessions to observe how to voice act. Momota, on the other hand, had voice acting experience but stated that she still faced difficulties, as it was the first time she had recorded lines in a group setting.\nIn addition to the film cast, Chiemi Chiba, Tomoko Akiya, Yuki Matsuoka, Rumi Shishido, Nami Miyahara, and Sawa Ishige reprise their roles as Doremi Harukaze, Hazuki Fujiwara, Aiko Seno, Onpu Segawa, Momoko Asuka, and Pop Harukaze from the Ojamajo Doremi anime series. The voice actresses also cameo in several minor roles throughout the film. Other voice actors who had recurring roles in Ojamajo Doremi, including Hyosei, Ai Nagano, , , , Kenji Nomura, , Kyousei Tsukui, , , and Yūta Mochizuki also make cameos. Media personality Atsugiri Jason and rapper K Dub Shine make a cameo as Mire's business partners.\nMusic\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      =\n| length     =\n| label      = Nippon Columbia\n| producer   = Keiichi Oku\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nThe original soundtrack was produced by Keiichi Oku and was released on December 23, 2020 under the name .
