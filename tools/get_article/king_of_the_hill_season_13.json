Four episodes from this final season originally premiered in syndication during the first week of May 2010. Actress Brittany Murphy, who voiced Luanne Platter, died on December 20, 2009, five months before the final four episodes aired. It is the final season of the show's initial run and the last to air on Fox.\nProduction\nThe showrunners for the season were John Altschuler and Dave Krinsky. Beginning with the episode \"Lucky See, Monkey Do\" (and in preparation for the DTV transition scheduled for during the season), King of the Hill started being produced in 720p 16:9 high-definition. 20th Century Fox Television initially ordered thirteen production episodes, but decided to keep the show in production for four additional episodes.\nLike the previous season, because Fox wanted to make room for new shows on their \"Animation Domination\" line-up, two of the final six episodes that aired were \"The Boy Can't Help It\" and \"To Sirloin with Love\". Both episodes aired as a special one-hour final on September 13, 2009. The other four episodes \"The Honeymooners,\" \"Bill Gathers Moss,\" \"When Joseph Met Lori, and Made Out with Her in the Janitor's Closet,\" and \"Just Another Manic Kahn-Day\" premiered first on local syndication in May 2010, and later appeared on Adult Swim as well as TV channels Comedy Central and FXX and various streaming platforms. Despite this, \"To Sirloin with Love\" is usually considered by fans as the last episode of the series, since it was written as such. On Olive Films' DVD and Blu-Ray release of this season, \"To Sirloin with Love\" is ordered as the last episode, with the four episodes that aired in syndication during the first week of May 2010 being presented in their production order, rather than in their airdate order. On streaming platform Hulu, these four episodes are presented in their airdate order, with \"Just Another Manic Kahn-Day\" appearing as the final episode of the series. Film and television databases such as IMDb also typically ordered them as the final episodes, due to their airdates.\nEpisodes\n| ProdCode=CABE16\n| Viewers=7.10\n| ShortSummary=Bill, unwilling to change his sugary eating habits after collapsing from a blood sugar spike, is diagnosed with diabetes.
