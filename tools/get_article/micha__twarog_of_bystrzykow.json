He  brought Scotism to Poland and taught at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków from 1485,  serving as its rector in 1513–14.\nTwaróg was the author of many works of philosophy and theology revered by contemporary historians. As the abbot of the collegiate church in Wojnicz (1497–1520) he supported financially the functioning of the local hospital. A prominent student of Twaróg was Jan of Stobnica (c.1470–1519), a moderate Scotist, professor at the same Jagiellonian University (Kraków Academy) between 1498 and 1514, who took account also of the theories of the Ockhamists, Thomists and Humanists.\nSee also\n*List of Poles\nNotes\nReferences\n* George J.
