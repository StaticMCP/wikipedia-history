The battle holds an important place in North Korea.\nBattle\n''. The battle was reported in numerous newspapers across the world.]]\nAccording to the Korean Friendship Association, the battle was in retaliation to the brutality of the Japanese occupation of Korea at a time when \"the Japanese imperialists perpetrated unheard-of fascist tyranny against the Korean people\".\nAccording to the official North Korean version of the events, a small unit of about 150–200 guerrillas of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army's Sixth Division under Kim Il Sung crossed the Amnok River and arrived at the Konjang Hill on 3 June 1937. At 22:00, Kim Il Sung fired a shot into the sky, and the battle started. During the battle, the Japanese-occupied police station, post office, foresters' office, local elementary school, fire department hall were destroyed by the guerrillas. Kim took 4,000 yen from local people and inflicted damage estimated at 16,000 yen. He took the town but only occupied it for a few hours or a day before retreating to Manchuria.\nFollowing combat, Kim Il Sung made a speech, where he noted that the Korean people \"turn out as one in the sacred anti-Japanese war\". The battle is featured in Kim Il Sung's autobiography With the Century. In it, too, Kim describes his guerrilla troops acting spontaneously and motivated by emotion rather than reason and strategic insights.}}\nThis official version of the battle does not correspond with some contemporary records such as a Japanese newspaper, however, which suggest that the rebels were actually led by Choe Hyon. But Kim Il Sung's absence from Japanese reports does not necessarily refute his presence in the battle, nor does the Choe Hyon's mention necessarily mean he was the top commander of the battle, as it only means Choe Hyon was the only commander on the Korean side whom the Japanese were able to identify.\nAftermath and legacy\nThe news of the battle was reported in numerous newspapers across the world, including the Soviet Union, China, Japan and France. According to the Association for the Study of Songun Politics UK, a pro-North Korean Juche study group:\n}}\nThe event brought Kim some fame among both his comrades as well as the Japanese. As a result, his influence grew, though the Japanese Imperial Army also started to hunt him, and almost wiped out his force. He was eventually forced retreat into the Soviet Union in 1940. Northern Korea was officially liberated from Japan on V-J Day (15 August 1945). Kim subsequently returned to his home country, and when he managed to establish himself with Soviet help as head of People's Committee of North Korea and Party's north faction (predecessors of future North Korea and WPK, respectively), his reputation as hero of Pochonbo helped him to gain acceptance and support among the people.\nSince then, the North Korean government has continuously reinforced the importance of the Battle of Pochonbo and Kim Il Sung's role in it. As result, it was speculated that Kim Jong Un, Kim Il Sung's grandson, had purged Choe Hyon's son Choe Ryong-hae in 2014 to prevent the undermining of the official version of the battle. It later became clear, however, that Choe Ryong-hae had not been purged at all and remained an influential member of the North Korean government.\nThe battle first entered the history textbook of South Korea in 2003, account Kim Il Sung's efforts on Anti-Japanese in relatively circumspect narratives. Controversies were raised on whether it makes students idolize North Korean regimes, or it could become a sign of South Korean history education stepping out from the cold-war thinking.\nThe Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble takes its name from the battle.\nBattle site\nThe battle site is situated at Pochon County, Ryanggang Province at the Kusi Barrage on Kojang Hill.\nMonument\nSamjiyon Grand Monument complex (area 100,000 m2) was completed in 1979 and includes a 15m-high statue of a Kim Il-sung, a huge square for rallies and many sculptures. This place was chosen as it is said to be where the guerrillas rested before the raid.\nGrand Monument2.jpg\nGrand Monument Samjiyon 10.jpg\nGrand Monument Samjiyon 11.jpg\nSee also\n*Korean independence movement\n*Mt.
