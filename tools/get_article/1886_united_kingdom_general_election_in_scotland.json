Scotland was allocated 72 seats in total, with 70 territorial seats, comprising 32 burgh constituencies and 37 county constituencies. There were also two university constituencies, Glasgow and Aberdeen Universities and Edinburgh and St Andrews Universities. As voters in university constituencies voted in addition to their territorial vote, the results are compiled separately.\nThe election was called following the defeat of the Government of Ireland Bill 1886, which led to a split in the Liberal party: Liberals who did not support Home Rule for Ireland formed the breakaway Liberal Unionist Party. The election in Scotland was effectively fought between two blocs, as the Conservatives did not put up candidates against sitting Liberal Unionist MPs, whilst the Liberals did not oppose sitting Crofters Party MPs even where they did not take the Liberal whip (several Crofters candidates elected in 1885 had been endorsed by Liberals prior to  election, or had since become fully alligned with them).\nAlthough the Liberals won a majority of the seats in Scotland, when combined with results from across the United Kingdom the election resulted in the defeat for William Ewart Gladstone's government. Although the Liberal Unionists did not formally join with the Conservatives, in practice the two groups acted together to control a parliamentary majority in the House of Commons.\nResults\nSeats summary\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! style=\"width:200px\" colspan=3 | Party\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Seats\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Last Election\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Seats change\n|-\n| rowspan=3 | &nbsp;\n| colspan=2 | Liberal and Crofter (Total)\n| align=center| 43\n| align=center| 62\n| align=center|  19\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#ffd700\" | &nbsp;\n| Liberal\n| align=center| 41\n| align=center| 51\n| align=center|  10\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#DDFF55\" | &nbsp;\n| Independent Liberal & Crofters Party\n| align=center| 2\n| align=center| 11\n| align=center|  9\n|-\n| rowspan=3 | &nbsp;\n| colspan=2 | Conservative and Liberal Unionist (Total)\n| align=center| 29\n| align=center| 10\n| align=center|  19\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#0087dc\" | &nbsp;\n|Conservative\n| align=\"center\" | 12\n| align=center| 10\n| align=center|  2\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#2061a2\" | &nbsp;\n|Liberal Unionist\n| align=\"center\" | 17\n| align=center| New\n| align=center|  17\n|-\n| colspan=3 | Total\n| align=center| 72\n| align=center| 72\n| align=center|\n|}\nBurgh & County constituencies\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! style=\"width:100px\" colspan=2 | Party\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Seats\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Seats change\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Votes\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| %\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| % at last election\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| % Change\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#FFD700\"|\n| Liberal & Crofters Party\n| align=center| 43\n| align=center|  19\n| align=center| 193,801\n| align=center| 53.6\n| align=center| 65.7\n| align=center|  12.1\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#0281AA\"|\n| Conservative & Liberal Unionist\n| align=center| 27\n| align=center|  19\n| align=center| 164,314\n| align=center| 46.4\n| align=center| 34.3\n| align=center|  12.1\n|-\n| colspan=2 | Total\n| align=center| 70\n| align=center|\n| align=center| 358,115\n| align=center| 100.0\n| align=center| 100.0\n| align=center|\n|}\nUniversity constituencies\nThe two university constituencies each elected an additional member to the house.
