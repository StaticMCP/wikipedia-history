While most countries supported the protests and urged the Myanmar's State Peace and Development Council ruling military Junta to implement far-reaching reforms, several key countries, such as the People's Republic of China and India maintained commitment to the notion of noninterference. A number of protests against the Burmese Government's crackdown have been held worldwide.\nAfrica\n- Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu on September 25, appealed to the United Nations and international community to press the Burmese government to release political detainees.\n\"The courage of the people of Burma is amazing and now they have been joined by their holy men,\" the Nobel peace laureate said in a statement. \"It is so like the rolling mass action that eventually toppled apartheid,\" he said of the growing street protests in Myanmar. \"We admire our brave sisters and brothers in Burma and want them to know that we support their peaceful protests to end a vicious rule of oppression and injustice.\"\nAsia\n- China is one of the closest allies and economic supporters of the ruling junta in Myanmar. In China's first official comment on the protests, Zhang Zhijun, a vice minister of the party's International Department, said Beijing has had minimal contact with either side and would abide by its long-term policy of noninterference in the domestic affairs of its allies.  However, the Chinese government has quietly urged Myanmar's military rulers to ease the strife despite its stance that it would publicly stick to a hands-off approach toward its neighbor.\n- India, another important nation bordering Myanmar, was earlier reluctant to comment anything on the situation, although in a major boost to the ruling junta, India's oil ministry has decided to invest US$150 million in gas exploration in Myanmar. On 26 September, however, it broke its silence over the issue and said, \"Government is concerned at and is closely monitoring the situation in Myanmar... (and hopes) all sides will resolve their issues peacefully through dialogue.\" An external affairs spokesman also added \"India has believed that Myanmar's process of political reform and national reconciliation should be more inclusive and broad-based\".\n- Indonesia's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Marty Natalegawa, viewed the protests and crackdown in Myanmar (which is a member of ASEAN) with concern and called for restraint in part of the Burmese government:\n\"We are seriously following these developments very closely. We are concerned by it. We are calling on the authorities to exercise maximum restraint and desist from any acts that could cause further violence.\nIndonesia's approach has always been one of engagement, not necessarily meaning that we are less concerned about the situation therein. We are just convinced that the best way to go is through engagement and encouragement.\"\n- Japan has stated that it hopes that the government and the protesters can use dialog to bring peace. \"Japan strongly hopes that the Government of Myanmar will make sincere efforts including dialogue for national reconciliation and democratization, taking into account the wishes expressed in the protests by the people of Myanmar,\" said a statement of Japan Foreign Affairs.\n- The Government of South Korea stated that they are strongly concerned about its situation, and urged the Government of Myanmar that \"to exercise restraint in order to prevent the further aggravation of its situation\", and hoped to both the Government and the people of Myanmar to build their democracy and development peacefully, by the spokesperson of the MOFAT.

Soe Win, the News and Periodicals Enterprise Managing Director and head of Myanmar's information agency, lauded Malaysia's stand on the issue of sanctions, adding:\n\"Most of the Western media fabricate news about Myanmar, getting information from undesirable elements\".\nOn September 28, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi stood up to voice his view that ASEAN's constructive engagement with the Burmese junta has failed, as Myanmar does not occasionally appear to push for democratisation and fails to abide by ASEAN's demands:\n\"It has been the formula used when we deal with Myanmar but up to this stage, it has not been successful although it has been many years already\".\nThe Prime Minister also reiterated support for the dispatch of Ibrahim Gambari to Myanmar by the UN, stating ASEAN was giving its full backing.\nOn the same day, about 3,000 refugees, migrant workers and activists staged a march towards the Burmese embassy in Kuala Lumpur and handed a memorandum to minister-counsellor Win Myint, urging the junta to resolve the unrest in Myanmar.

Free Aung San Suu Kyi!\" they shouted.\n- Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont issued his statement against the Burmese government's decision to use force against protesters, sharing his views as a Buddhist and a former military official on the effects of any crackdown:\n\"I'm trying my best to convince the Burmese: 'Don't use the harsh measures.' At the least they should try to avoid the violent action from the government side.As a Buddhist and as a soldier, I can say that it will be very difficult for the Burmese government to use violence to crack down on the monks. It will be against the way of life of the Buddhists.\"\n- The topic was slow to make the headline in Vietnam until September 25, when a few news outlet began publishing terse accounts.\nEurope\n- The French government warned Myanmar's ruling junta on September 24, that it would be held accountable if it cracked down on protesters who have taken to the streets in large numbers in Yangon.President Nicolas Sarkozy requested on September 26 that French businesses freeze investments in Myanmar and he called for the UN Security Council to have 'sanctions to be adopted without delay.'\n- Swiss President Micheline Calmy-Rey spoke at the opening of the UN's 62nd General Assembly and addressed the use of force by Burma's military junta against pro-democracy demonstrators calling the situation \"alarming\".

The authorities must engage democratically with the democratic opposition and ethnic groups in open and inclusive dialogue. The world needs to speak with one voice in ensuring restraint on the part of the Burmese regime in dealing with the peaceful protests.”\nAhern also then stated that the European Union should impose more sanctions against Myanmar's military regime:\n\"Within the European Union, Ireland has long taken a strong and principled position on Burma. We are looking urgently at how to increase the pressure on the regime, including through further EU restrictive measures, without harming the ordinary people whose suffering is already so great.\"\n- Dutch Prime Minister Jan-Peter Balkenende has called for sanctions against Myanmar.\n\"In Myanmar, soldiers opened fire on monks and civilians taking part in peaceful demonstrations.

In that case, I am convinced that the European Union and the United States will decide on further measures, together with other benevolent countries.\"\nIn accordance, several sanctions are being considered by the Dutch government, including a possible ban on wood from Myanmar. Also, the Prime Minister remarked that these sanctions should target only the military junta, but not impair the population.\n- Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg and Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Støre both condemned the use of violence by the military junta, and urged the international community to take responsibility for the democratic development in Myanmar. Jens Stoltenberg stated that:\n\"The use of force is the last thing Burma needs right now. That's a message we're sending very clearly from the Norwegian government.\"\n\"We believe that the countries in the immediate area have a special responsibility. That applies, not least, to China.\"\n- Polish democracy leader Lech Wałęsa and a former Communist Polish political and military leader Wojciech Jaruzelski made a unique joint appeal to Myanmar's junta on Thursday to talk to protesters.\n\"In Myanmar, as in Poland, only a bloodless transition to democracy is in the interest of all.\"\n- On September 23, foreign minister Carl Bildt said in a statement that:\n\"(Sweden) demands that the regime fully respects the right to peaceful protests\" ... \"We—and the European Union—want to open up for cooperation and trade with a democratic Burma\".\nProtesters march in London\n- The UK Ambassador, Mark Canning, commented that the Burmese leaders were now in uncharted territory, and was concerned about any possible crackdown by the junta, saying:\n\"That would be a disaster, although in terms of probability, I'm afraid, ranks quite high.\"\nMike Ellam, Prime Minister Gordon Brown's spokesman, stated that:\n\"HM Government deplore(s) the continued repression of ordinary citizens by the Burmese regime and we were deeply concerned by reports of further acts of violence perpetrated this week by security officials against peaceful demonstrators.\"\nForeign Secretary David Miliband, at the Labour Party Conferences in Bournemouth, responded to events by saying:\n\"I for one thought it was brilliant to see Aung San Suu Kyi alive and well outside her house last week.
