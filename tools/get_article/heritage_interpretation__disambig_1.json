Note the use of a map, photographs, and text to explain the subject, sited at a relevant location.]]\nHeritage interpretation refers to all the ways in which information is communicated to visitors to an educational, natural or recreational site, such as a museum, park or science centre. More specifically it is the communication of information about, or the explanation of, the nature, origin, and purpose of historical, natural, or cultural resources, objects, sites and phenomena using personal or non-personal methods.  Some international authorities in museology prefer the term mediation for the same concept, following usage in other European languages.\nHeritage interpretation may be performed at dedicated interpretation centres or at museums, historic sites, parks, art galleries, nature centres, zoos, aquaria, botanical gardens, nature reserves and a host of other heritage sites. Its modalities can be extremely varied and may include guided walks, talks, drama, staffed stations, displays, signs, labels, artwork, brochures, interactives, audio-guides and audio-visual media. The process of developing a structured approach to interpreting these stories, messages and information is called interpretive planning. The thematic approach to heritage interpretation advocated by University of Idaho professor Sam Ham, the National Association for Interpretation, the US National Park Service, and others, is considered best practice.\nThose who practice this form of interpretation may include rangers, guides, naturalists, actors (who may wear period dress and do reenactments), museum curators, natural and cultural interpretive specialists, interpretation officers, heritage communicators, docents, educators, visitor services staff, interpreters or a host of other titles. The interpretive process is often assisted by new technologies such as visualizing techniques.\nPurpose\nat Biscayne National Park in Florida, USA, show a hermit crab to children.]]\nThe goal of interpretation is to improve and enrich the visitor experience by helping site visitors understand the significance of the place they are visiting, and connecting those meanings to visitors' own personal lives. By weaving compelling, thematic stories about environmental phenomena and historical events, interpreters aim to provoke visitors to learn and think about their experiences.\nEffective interpretation enables the visitors to make associations between the information given and their previous perceptions. According to Moscardo interpretation can produce 'Mindful Visitors' who are carefully processing information and negotiating the meanings of the observed object or intangible element.\nInterpretation is often used by landowning government agencies and NGOs to promote environmental stewardship of the lands they manage.\nDefinitions of heritage interpretation\n}}\n(United States), and adopted by The Definitions Project (a consortium of over two dozen federal and non-profit organizations in the United States)}}\n. These can include print and electronic publications, public lectures, on-site and directly related off-site installations, educational programs, community activities, and ongoing research, training, and evaluation of the interpretation process itself.|International Council on Monuments and Sites' Ename Charter for the Interpretation and Presentation of Cultural Heritage Sites (2008) }}}}\n\"Tilden's principles\" of interpretation\nIn his 1957 book, \"Interpreting Our Heritage\", Freeman Tilden defined six principles of interpretation:\nFor the past 50 years, Tilden's principles have remained highly relevant to interpreters across the world. In 2002 Larry Beck and Ted Cable published \"Interpretation for the 21st Century - Fifteen Guiding Principles for Interpreting Nature and Culture\", which elaborated upon Tilden's original principles. In 2011, Beck and Cable released a new version of their principles in \"The Gift of Interpretation\".\nInterpretation organizations\n]]\n* Association for Heritage Interpretation, UK ([https://www.ahi.org.uk/ external link])\n* Association for Living History, Farm and Agricultural Museums, USA ([http://www.alhfam.org external link])\n* International Centre for the Interpretation and Presentation of World Heritage Sites ([https://unesco-whipic.org/ external link])\n*Interpretation Latin América and the Caribbean ([https://www.i-pal.net/ external link])\n* Interpretation Australia ([https://www.interpretationaustralia.asn.au/ external link])\n* Interpretation Canada ([https://interpretationcanada.wildapricot.org/ external link])\n* Interpret Europe ([https://www.interpret-europe.net/ external link])\n* Interpret Scotland ([http://www.interpretscotland.org.uk/ external link])\n* Interpretation Network New Zealand ([http://www.innz.net.nz/ external link] )\n* ICOMOS Charter for the Interpretation and Presentation of Cultural Heritage Sites, International ([http://www.enamecharter.org/ external link])\n* ICOMOS International Committee on Interpretation and Presentation ([https://icip.icomos.org/ external link])\n* National Association for Interpretation, USA ([https://web.archive.org/web/20121030082515/http://www.interpnet.org/ external link])\n* Swedish Centre for Nature Interpretation ([https://www.slu.se/en/collaborative-centres-and-projects/swedish-centre-for-nature-interpretation/ external link])\nSee also\n* Blue plaque\n* Commemorative plaque\n* First-person interpretation\n* Interpretation centre\n* Interpretive planning\n* Living history\n* Natural Heritage Education\n* Thematic interpretation\n* Visitor center\nNotes\nReferences\n* Beck, L.; Cable, T.
