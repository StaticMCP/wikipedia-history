Voters chose 21 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.\nVirginia voted for the Democratic-Republican candidate and Virginia native, Thomas Jefferson, over the Federalist candidate, John Adams. Jefferson won Virginia by a margin of 36.72%. Virginia chose electors by popular vote per electoral district and as such granted 1 electoral vote to John Adams.\nPrior to the 12th Amendment, electors cast two votes, making no distinction if they were voting for Vice President or President, as such: Thomas Pinckney received 1 electoral vote, Aaron Burr received 1 electoral vote, Samuel Adams received 15 electoral votes, George Clinton received 3 electoral votes and George Washington received 1 electoral vote. It was well-known in 1796 that Jefferson and Adams were intended to be elected as president and Burr and Pinckney for vice president.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"6\" |1796 United States presidential election in Virginia\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Party\n!Candidate\n!Votes\n!Percentage\n!Electoral votes\n|-\n!\n|Democratic-Republican\n|Thomas Jefferson\n| align=\"right\" |3,721\n| align=\"right\" |68.36%\n| align=\"right\" |20\n|-\n!\n|Federalist\n|John Adams\n| align=\"right\" |1,722\n| align=\"right\" |31.64%\n| align=\"right\" |1\n|-\n|- bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" |Totals\n| align=\"right\" |5,443\n| align=\"right\" |100.0%\n| align=\"right\" |21\n|-\n|}\nCounty results\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |County\n! colspan=\"2\" |John Adams\nFederalist\n! colspan=\"2\" |Thomas Jefferson\nDemocratic-Republican\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Total votes cast\n|-\n! %\n!#\n! %\n!#\n|-\n|  |Charles City\n|56.27%\n|122\n|43.73%\n|35\n|157\n|-\n|  |Elizabeth City\n|90.91%\n|50\n|9.09%\n|5\n|55\n|-\n|  |Henrico\n|40.95%\n|104\n|59.05%\n|150\n|254\n|-\n|  |James City\n|8.4%\n|5\n|91.6%\n|55\n|60\n|-\n|  |New Kent\n|48.72%\n|57\n|51.28%\n|60\n|117\n|-\n|  |Warwick\n|0.00%\n|0\n|100%\n|56\n|56\n|-\n|  |Williamsburg\n|64.70%\n|33\n|35.30%\n|18\n|51\n|-\n|  |York\n|25.84%\n|23\n|74.16%\n|66\n|89\n|-\n|  |Essex\n|7.27%\n|17\n|92.73%\n|217\n|234\n|-\n|  |Sussex\n|0.00%\n|0\n|100%\n|118\n|118\n|-\n|  |Brunswick\n|32.59%\n|132\n|67.41%\n|273\n|405\n|-\n|  |Dinwiddie\n|2.89%\n|6\n|97.11%\n|202\n|208\n|-\n|  |Mecklenburg\n|89.70%\n|366\n|10.3%\n|42\n|366\n|-\n|  |Powhatan\n|82.05%\n|128\n|17.95%\n|28\n|156\n|-\n|  |Buckingham\n|0.00%\n|0\n|100%\n|89\n|89\n|-\n|  |Cumberland\n|0.00%\n|0\n|100%\n|127\n|127\n|-\n|  |Lunenburg\n|0.00%\n|0\n|100%\n|60\n|60\n|-\n|  |Prince Edward\n|0.00%\n|0\n|100%\n|43\n|43\n|-\n|  |Fairfax\n|51.97%\n|185\n|48.03%\n|171\n|356\n|-\n|  |Prince William\n|0.46%\n|1\n|99.54%\n|217\n|218\n|-\n|  |Stafford\n|2.66%\n|5\n|97.34%\n|183\n|188\n|-\n|  |Berkeley\n|19.78%\n|88\n|80.22%\n|357\n|445\n|-\n|  |Frederick\n|71.35%\n|137\n|28.65%\n|51\n|188\n|-\n|  |Bath\n|0.00%\n|0\n|100%\n|120\n|120\n|-\n|  |Rockbridge\n|0.00%\n|0\n|100%\n|65\n|65\n|-\n|  |Fauquier\n|55.20%\n|175\n|44.8%\n|142\n|317\n|-\n|  |Loudoun\n|23.47%\n|138\n|76.53%\n|450\n|588\n|}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Virginia\nReferences"
