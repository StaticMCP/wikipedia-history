The basic unit of memory, the \"byte\", was defined as 8 bits, with larger units such as \"words\" defined with sizes that were multiples of 8 bits, with many consequences. Many competing computers at the time used word sizes that were multiples of 6 bits. The marketing term \"IBM Compatible\" was often used, at this time, to indicate that the architecture used 8-bit bytes. Over 14,000 were shipped by 1968.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n| US\n| Project MAC begun at MIT by J.C.R.

It ran at a clock frequency of 2&nbsp;MHz and did 0.64&nbsp;MIPS.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n| US\n| Motorola announces the MC6800 8-bit microprocessor. It is easier to implement than the 8080 because it only needs a single power supply to operate and does not need support chips. Unlike the 8080 it is sold not as much as a general-purpose \"number cruncher / computer\" CPU but more as a control processor for industrial control and as a peripheral processor.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n| US\n| Engineers Chuck Peddle and Bill Mensch leave Motorola after completing work on the 6800 CPU and join MOS Technology.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n| Italy\n| Olivetti released the personal computer Olivetti P6060, the first with an integrated floppy disk drive.

It comes with 4&nbsp;KB or 8&nbsp;KB of RAM, and an integrated cassette deck and 9\" monochrome monitor.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n| US\n| |author=Ken Olsen, founder, president, and chairman of Digital Equipment Corporation}}\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n| US\n| Apple II computer introduced based on an 8-bit MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor running at 1&nbsp;MHz with 4&nbsp;KB of RAM. It had an open architecture, used color graphics, and an audio cassette interface for loading programs and storing data. Later, in July 1978, a floppy disk drive was made available with an elegantly designed interface. One of the first examples of a \"killer app\" (for the business world) was released for itthe VisiCalc spreadsheet programin 1979.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n| US\n| Tandy brought out the TRS-80 with \"Level I BASIC\". Despite simple black-and-white graphics, thanks to the nationwide chain of Radio Shack stores, it became a bestseller quickly.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n| US\n| Heathkit made the H8 Home computer kit available. It was based on an Intel 8080A processor and shipped with HDOS (Heathkit Disk Operating System) and Benton Harbor BASIC.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n| US\n| Tandy upgraded the TRS-80 with a much improved Microsoft 8K \"Level II BASIC\", and an \"expansion interface\" which added 32&nbsp;KB RAM, A floppy disk and a printer interface. With these extras the TRS-80 became a viable small business computer.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n| US\n| Introduction of the Speak & Spell educational toy by Texas Instruments. It consisted of a linear predictive coding speech synthesizer, a keyboard, and an alphanumeric vacuum fluorescent display. It had a vocabulary of 200 words stored in its internal 32K byte ROM.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n| US\n| Introduction of the 16-bit Intel 8086, the first x86 microprocessor. The available clock frequencies were 5, 8 and 10&nbsp;MHz, with an instruction set of about 300 operations. At its introduction, the fastest 8086 available was the 8&nbsp;MHz version which achieved 0.8&nbsp;MIPS and contained 29,000 transistors. Over three decades later, x86 remains the most popular and commercially successful instruction set architecture in the history of personal computing.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n| JAP\n| The arcade video game Space Invaders is released, sparking a video game craze. In 1979, Atari's Asteroids would prove to be incredibly popular.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n| US\n| Programming language Ada introduced by Jean Ichbiah and team at Honeywell for the US Department of Defense.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n| US\n| Introduction of the Intel 8088, compatible with the 8086 with an 8-bit data busbut this makes it cheaper to implement in computers. Chosen for the IBM PC, Intel processors were found in millions of IBM PC compatible computers.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n| UK\n| Commodore PET released in the United Kingdom. Based on a 1&nbsp;MHz 6502 processor it displayed monochrome text and had 8&nbsp;KB of RAM. Priced £569. A version with 16&nbsp;KB of RAM cost £776, while 32&nbsp;KB of RAM cost £914.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n| NEDJAP\n| Compact disc was invented.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n| US\n| The Motorola 68000 Microprocessor launched, the first of the 68k family. 5+ years later it was used in machines such as the Macintosh, the Atari ST and the Amiga.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 1979\n| US\n| Shortly after the release of V7 Unix, which included UUCP, a protocol for communication over standard telephone lines, Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis developed and released Usenet, a global discussion group system. Now, it uses Internet protocols and is still popular.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n| US\n| Four disgruntled Atari programmers leave and form Activision, the first third-party video game software publisher. Activision promotes both the game and the programmer, changing the way software is marketed.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n| US\n| Texas Instruments releases the 16-bit TI-99/4 microcomputer. This system generally used audio cassettes to store information, along with ROM modules, similar to gaming units, to hold commercial software. Additionally, TI made available a speech synthesizer, based on their own chip, for the TI-99/4 and its successor, the 4A.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n| US\n| VisiCalc spreadsheet software released.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n| US\n| WordStar word processing software released.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n| US\n| Atari releases the Atari 400/800, high-performance game-oriented home computers based on the 6502 microprocessor.\n|}\nSee also\n* Information revolution\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://trillian.randomstuff.org.uk/~stephen/history/ A Brief History of Computing,] by Stephen White.
