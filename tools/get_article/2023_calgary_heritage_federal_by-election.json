This part of Calgary has been represented by centre-right parties continuously since the 1972 election.\nRepresentation\nThe riding of Calgary Heritage was vacated on December 31, 2022 following the October 20 announcement from Conservative MP Bob Benzen that he would resign his seat by the end of the year in order to return to the private sector. Benzen had held the seat since a 2017 by-election in which he was elected to replace former Prime Minister and former Conservative leader Stephen Harper. The by-election was called for July 24, 2023, following the conclusion of the 2023 Alberta general election.\nCandidates\nShuvaloy Majumdar, global director for Harper's international consulting firm Harper & Associates defeated former parliamentary staffer Quinn Heffron for the Conservative nomination.
