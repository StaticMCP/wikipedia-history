The coat of arms consists of a circle, in the center of which is a red silhouette of a rider on horseback holding a banner, based on the prehistoric petroglyphs of the \"Shishkin pisanitsa\", against a white sun background. The central image is framed with a traditional Sakha ornament in the form of seven rhombic crystal-like figures and the inscriptions \"Республика Саха (Якутия) • Саха Өрөспүүбүлүкэтэ\". This coat of arms has been used officially since 26 December 1992.\nPrior to 1992, the Sakha Republic existed as the Yakut Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. Prior to 1937, Yakut ASSR used a coat of arms with the basis of korenizatsiya, on which it contained the depiction of the Lena River, Aurora, and the name of the ASSR. After 1937, the coat of arms of the Yakut ASSR is identical with the emblem of the Russian SFSR.\nSymbolism\nThe central element of the coat of arms is an image of an ancient rider with a banner. The image was one of the rock paintings found near the village of Shishkino in 1745 by members of the Great Northern Expedition of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The painting was believed to be made by Kurykans. Scientists believe that the rider depicted in the painting are the leaders of the clans and tribes of the Kurykans. The red banner in the image symbolized the unity and the strength of the Kurykan tribes.\nThe seven rhombic crystal-like figures of faceted diamonds symbolizes one of the natural resources of the republic. The amount of the faceted diamonds also symbolizes the unity of the peoples living in Yakutia : Yakuts, Russians, Evenks, Evens, Chukchi, Dolgans, and Yukagirs.\nHistory\nAs the Yakutsk Oblast\nThe coat of arms of the Yakutsk Oblast was approved on 5 July 1878. The coat of arms consisted of silver shield, with a black eagle holding a scarlet sable in its claws. The shield is decorated with the Tsar's crown and is surrounded by golden oak leaves, intertwined by Alexander's ribbon.\nFile:Якутская область МВД Бенке.jpg|Version by the Interior Ministry of the Russian Empire, 1880\nFile:Якутская область изд.Сукачова.JPG|Version by Sukachova, 1878\nFile:Якутская обл 1878 из Винклера.jpg|Version by Pavel Vinkler, 1899\nAs the Yakut ASSR\nFirst version\nThe first emblem of the Yakut ASSR was described in the Constitution of the Yakut ASSR, which was approved by the Fourth All-Yakut Congress of Soviets on September 25, 1926.
