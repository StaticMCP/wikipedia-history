The division was raised from volunteers for Lord Kitchener's New Armies, that was originally made up of infantry battalions raised by public subscription or private patronage. The division was taken over by the War Office in September 1915. It served in France and Belgium in the trenches of the Western Front for the duration of the war. The division's insignia was the \"double-three\" from a set of dominoes.\nFormation history\nThe Division was one of the six created for the Fourth New Army on 10 December 1914. It landed in France in November 1915. Major-General Herman Landon took command of the division on its arrival. It saw action at the Battle of the Somme in autumn 1916 and, after Major General Reginald Pinney had taken command, it also saw action at the Battle of Arras in April / May 1917 and the Battle of Passchendaele in autumn 1917.
