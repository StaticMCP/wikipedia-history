Shivaji  was forced to sign the agreement after Jai Singh besieged Purandar fort.\nBackground\nShivaji Maharaj attacked six Mughal generals at Lal Mahal of Poona (Now Pune). Then Shivaji Maharaj sacked Surat, a prosperous port city back then which inhabited lots of rich merchants from all parts of India, China, Turkey, England and the Netherlands. Shivaji Maharaj got huge amount of wealth in this loot. After that in 1665 Aurangzeb sent his general Mirza Raja Jai Singh to subdue Shivaji Maharaj and the Adil Shahi dynasty.\nSiege of Purandar\nof Amber receiving Shivaji a day before concluding the Treaty of Purandar (12 June 1665).]]Jai Singh besieged Purandar fort in 1665. He conquered the neighbouring Vajragad fort in the middle of April. He surrounded Purandar and attacked the walls of the fort with cannons. The Marathas suffered heavy casualties.  Due to this, Shivaji decided to meet Jai Singh and accept the terms of peace.  Shivaji is noted to have said when receiving Jai Singh:\nTerms of the treaty\nFollowing are the main points of the treaty:\n# Shivaji kept twelve forts, along with an area worth an income of 100,000 (1 lakh) huns.\n# Shivaji was required to help the Mughals whenever and wherever required.\n# Shivaji's son Sambhaji was tasked with the command of a 5,000-strong force to fight for Mughals as Mansabdar.\n# If Shivaji wanted to claim the Konkan area under Bijapur's control, he would have to pay 4 million (40 lakh) hons to the Mughals.\n# He had to give up his 23 forts, which include Purandar, Rudramal, Kondana, Karnala, Lohagad, Isagad, Tung, Tikona, Rohida, Nardurga, Mahuli, Bhandardurga, Palaskhol, Rupgad, Bakhtgad, Morabkhan, Manikgad (Raigad), Saroopgad, Sagargad, Marakgad, Ankola, Songad, and Mangad.\nAlong with these requirements, Shivaji agreed to visit Agra to meet Aurangzeb for further political talks.\nAftermath\nFollowing Shivaji's surrender, Jai Singh ended the siege on Purandar, allowing 7000 residents of the fort to come out which included 4000 Maratha soldiers. Shivaji handed over his forts to Jai Singh.  Following the failed rebellion, Shivaji wrote letters to Aurangzeb, requesting forgiveness for his actions and security for himself along with a robe of honour. He also requested Jai Singh to support him in getting his crimes pardoned by the emperor, stating \"Now you are protector and a father to me, so I beg you to fulfil the ambition of your son.\" On September 15, 1665, Aurangzeb granted his request and sent him a letter and a firman along with a robe of honor. Shivaji responded with a letter thanking the emperor:\nLater Shivaji travelled to Agra to Aurangzeb's court. But Aurangzeb put him under house arrest for a few months. Shivaji managed to escape and returned home. Aurangzeb blamed Jai Singh's son Ram Singh for Shivaji's escape and demoted him.\nReferences\n* .\n*\nSee also\n* Battle of Purandar\n* Agra fort\nReferences\n* .\n* ."
