It is a section of the League for the Fifth International.\nIn their words: \"''SOP follows revolutionary traditions of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Trotsky, striving to build a revolutionary worker's party''\". They established an independent youth group, called REVO, in 2000. Revo had a split in 2006.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://sop.revoluce.info/ Party website]  (in Czech)\n*[http://www.sds.cz/docs/prectete/epubl/mba_sop.htm Early years of the party] (in Czech)\n*[http://revo.revoluce.info REVO]"
