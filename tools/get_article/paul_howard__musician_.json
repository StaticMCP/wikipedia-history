He began playing cornet and also played oboe, bassoon, flute, and piano, but concentrated on being a tenor sax player.\nLater life and career\nAfter moving to Los Angeles in 1911, he gained early professional experience with Wood Wilson's Syncopators in 1916, Satchel McVea's Howdy Band, and Harry Southard's Black and Tan Band. Howard played in the bands of both King Oliver and Jelly Roll Morton when they toured California. He first recorded with the Quality Four in 1922-23, then played with Sonny Clay in 1925 before forming his own group, the Quality Serenaders, later that year. Among his sidemen were Lionel Hampton and Lawrence Brown (trombone). They played at Sebastian's Cotton Club in Culver City, California from 1927 to 1929 and recorded for Victor Records before disbanding in 1930, when Les Hite picked up some of the members. Howard then played with Ed Garland, Freddie Washington, Hampton again in 1935, Eddie Barefield (1936–37), Charlie Echols, and his own ensembles including one which held a residence at Virginia's in Los Angeles from 1939 to 1953. He played throughout the 1950s. He died in Los Angeles on February 18, 1980.\nRecording sessions\nHoward's band participated in only six recording sessions:\nApril 16, 1929, Hollywood\n50830-1-2 Overnight Blues - Victor rejected\n50831-1-2-3 Quality Shout - Victor rejected\nApril 28, 1929, Culver City\n50868-1 The Ramble - Victor V-38068 and Bluebird B-5804\n50869-2 Moonlight Blues - Victor V-38068\n50870-2 Charlie's Idea - Victor V-38070 and Victor 22001\nApril 29, 1929, Culver City\n50830-4 Overnight Blues - Victor V-38070 and Victor 22001\n50831-5 Quality Shout - Victor V-38122\n50877-1 Stuff - Victor V-38122 and Bluebird B-5804\nOctober 21, 1929, Culver City\n54477-1-2 Harlem - Victor rejected\n54478-1-2 Cuttin' Up - Victor rejected\nFebruary 3, 1930, Culver City\n54477-3 Harlem - Victor 23354\n54478-3 Cuttin' Up - Victor 23420\n54585-1 New Kinda Blues - Victor 22660\n54586-2 California Swing - Victor 23354\nJune 25, 1930, Hollywood\n54847-3 Burma Girl - Victor rejected (released on a Victor LPM-10117 LP)\n54848-1 Gettin' Ready Blues - Victor 23420\nSource:\nReferences"
