It was released as a double album on the band's own Spiderleg Records in 1984 as the follow-up to their debut, Strive to Survive Causing Least Suffering Possible.\nThe album's lyrical content concerned violence between men and women, based on the experiences of a band member who had been sexually assaulted. The title was a Dada-style ploy to get attention for this social message.\nThe album featured artwork by Crass guitarist Andy Palmer.\nA 2016 primer on Anarcho Punk in The Wire magazine noted the influence of Art Ensemble of Chicago and Whitehouse and described the album as:\n}}\nThe Fucking Cunts Treat Us Like Pricks reached number two on the UK Indie Chart, spending fifteen weeks on the chart in total. Music Week listed the album in its Indie Album Chart as \"The F.......................................\".\nObscenity controversy\nWhen reissued in 1986 on band member Derek Birkett's own One Little Indian label, the album was banned by several major retailers including HMV and Our Price due to its sexually explicit title and cover art.\nIn September 1987, Greater Manchester Police raided independent record shop Eastern Bloc following an alleged complaint by a member of the public. Copies of the album were seized and one of the owners, Martin Price, was warned that he could face prosecution under the Obscene Publications Act for \"indecent display\" as the album had been promoted in the shop's window. The Director of Public Prosecutions determined that prosecution was not viable. Under the direction of Chief Constable James Anderton the shop was charged with displaying \"Obscene Articles For Publication For Gain\". Martin Price represented the shop in court The case was eventually dropped by the police after several adjournments, due to costs. Price (who would later be a member of techno group 808 State) felt that this meant that morality could be bought, as he had been prepared to go to court to defend his, but the police had put a price on theirs.\nThe band, its two record labels, and its publishing company, Second Wind, were also charged under the Obscene Publications Act. Charges against One Little Indian were dropped in March 1988.}}\nSinger Colin Latter would subsequently describe the album as \"...rubbish. A total waste of time.\"}}\nThe New Musical Express review of the album included: \"This heroically ugly double LP has very little to do with 'punk'. It's a vast dog-eared canvas of sounds and visions in revolt, Thatcher's Britain force fed into a swollen stomach and the resultant vomit recorded on vinyl.\"\nThe 1992 book ''The Guinness Who's Who of Indie and New Wave Music described the album as \"little short of a directionless cacophony\".\nIn 2013, Uncut magazine suggested that the album was \"seemingly rejecting music as a bourgeois conceit\".\nThe 2016 The Wire'' magazine primer stated that:\nAlso in 2016, writer and academic Nigel Ball reflected on how the release had influenced him as a teenager:\n}}\nLegacy\n}}\nThe title of the album appears as a piece of grafitti in David Peace's 2002 novel Nineteen Eighty Three: Book Four of the Red Riding Quartet. It is also used in dialogue in Julian Gough's 2011 novel Jude In London.\nEnglish post-punk band Bilge Pump released a 10\" EP titled The Fucking Cunts Still Treat Us Like Pricks on Gringo Records in 2010.\nIn 2019, comedian Stewart Lee ironically claimed that \"80s anarcho-punks Flux of Pink Indians were privately dismayed by the Countryside Alliance's misappropriation of their album The Fucking Cunts Treat Us Like Pricks to soundtrack its campaign against rural post-office closures.\" at the conclusion of an extended routine about right wing individuals adopting left-wing songs.\nTrack listing\nSide one\n#\"Punk\"\n#\"Mind Fuckers Fucking Minds\"\n#\"Hard Sell\"\n#\"Love Song\"\n#\"Mickey on Tuneoil\"\nSide two\n#\"Desire\"\n#\"Blood Lust Rite\"\n#\"The Falklands War\"\nSide three\n#\"Punk\"\n#\"Life We Make\"\n#\"Trouble at the Heart\"\n#\"The Sun (the Paper That Supports Our Boys and Rapes Our Girls)\"\n#\"Shadow of Abuse\"\n#\"Very Funny\"\nSide four\n#\"Cure for the Coprolite\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
