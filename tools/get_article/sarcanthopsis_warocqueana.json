It has a long, thick, branched stems, thick, cord-like roots, many leathery, strap-like leaves and many cream-coloured, yellowish or greenish flowers with purple or brown spots. It grows near the sea, in coastal swamps and in rainforest, usually in full sun. It mainly only occurs in New Guinea.\nDescription\nSaccolabiopsis rectifolia is a large epiphytic or lithophytic herb that forms large, straggly clumps and has thick, cord-like roots and thick, branched stems  long. There are many fleshy, strap-like leaves  long and  wide at intervals about  apart. A large number of resupinate cream-coloured, yellowish or greenish flowers with purple or brown spots,  long and wide are arranged on a branched flowering stem  long with between five and fifteen flowers on each branch. The sepals are  long and  wide, the petals a similar width but slightly shorter. The labellum is white with rose-coloured spots, about  long and  wide three lobes. The side lobes are triangular and the middle lobe is fleshy with a spur and a large, fleshy callus. Flowering occurs from April to August.\nTaxonomy and naming\nThe goliath orchid was first formally described in 1891 by Robert Allen Rolfe who gave it the name Stauropsis warocqueana and published the description in Lindenia: iconography of orchids. In 1972, Leslie Andrew Garay changed the name to Sarcanthopsis warocqueana in The Orchadian. The specific epithet (warocqueana) honours \"M. G. Warocqué\", in whose garden it flowered, producing the type specimen.\nDistribution and habitat\nSarcanthopsis warocqueana grows from rocks on the coast, just above the water line to the branches of trees in rainforest at  above sea level. It is found in eastern New Guinea and nearby islands. A single juvenile plant has been observed on Moa Island, Queensland.\nReferences"
