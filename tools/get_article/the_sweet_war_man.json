A battle of wills ensues between the men.\nProduction\nThe story editor was Robert Banks Stewart.\nReception\nThe Observer called it \"very nearly very good\" but \"wrecked... by an inept payoff in which everybody behaved madly out of character.\" The Leicester Mercury called it \"strong, meaty drama.\" The Liverpool Echo said it had \"a tour de force from Kenneth More.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0769796/?ref_=ttsnd_ov The Sweet War Man] at IMDb"
