It runs from Maryland Route&nbsp;314 (MD&nbsp;314) at the Maryland border in Whiteleysburg east to an interchange with DE&nbsp;1 near Frederica. The route follows a mostly rural alignment, passing through the towns of Felton and Frederica. DE&nbsp;12 intersects U.S. Route&nbsp;13 (US&nbsp;13) in Felton and DE&nbsp;15 east of Felton. What would become DE&nbsp;12 was built as a state highway during the 1920s. DE&nbsp;12 was designated between Felton and Frederica by 1936 and extended west to the Maryland border by 1938. The eastern terminus was moved to its current location in 1965 when US&nbsp;113 (now DE&nbsp;1) was routed to bypass Frederica to the east. The DE&nbsp;1 intersection became an interchange in 2011.\nRoute description\nDE&nbsp;12 begins at the Maryland border in the community of Whiteleysburg, with the road continuing west into that state as MD&nbsp;314. From the state line, the route heads southeast on two-lane undivided Whiteleysburg Road briefly before turning northeast onto Whites Lane. A short distance later, DE&nbsp;12 intersects Two State Road and becomes Burnite Mill Road. The road runs through farmland with some woods and homes, passing through the community of Hollandsville. The route intersects Sandtown Road before it curves east and enters the town of Felton. At this point, DE&nbsp;12 becomes West Main Street and heads into residential areas, crossing the Delmarva Central Railroad's Delmarva Subdivision line at-grade. The road name changes to East Main Street and it comes to an intersection with US&nbsp;13 near businesses on the eastern edge of Felton.\nUpon leaving Felton, the route becomes Midstate Road and continues through agricultural areas with some woods and homes, passing to the north of the geographic center of Delaware.  DE&nbsp;12 crosses DE&nbsp;15 and comes to a junction with Andrews Lake Road, where the name changes to Johnnycake Landing Road. The road passes through more rural areas before intersecting Carpenter Bridge Road and entering the town of Frederica, where it becomes West Front Street and is lined with homes. In the eastern part of town, the route splits into the one-way pair of West David Street eastbound and West Front Street westbound. Upon crossing Market Street, the one-way pair becomes East David Street eastbound and East Front Street westbound. DE&nbsp;12 turns north onto two-way, two-lane undivided Frederica Road and passes through marshland, leaving Frederica upon crossing Spring Creek, a tributary of the Murderkill River. DE&nbsp;12 continues to its eastern terminus at an interchange with DE&nbsp;1.\nThe section of the route between Frederica Road and DE&nbsp;1 in Frederica is designated as part of the Delaware Bayshore Byway, a Delaware Byway and National Scenic Byway. DE&nbsp;12 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 6,719&nbsp;vehicles at the eastern border of Felton to a low of 1,244&nbsp;vehicles at the Sandtown Road intersection.\nHistory\nWhat is now DE&nbsp;12 existed as an unimproved county road by 1920. By 1924, the route was completed as a state highway between Hollandsville and Frederica and was proposed as a state highway between the Maryland border in Whiteleysburg and Hollandsville and within Frederica. The entire road between Whiteleysburg and Frederica was built as a state highway a year later. DE&nbsp;12 was designated to run from US&nbsp;13 in Felton east to US&nbsp;113 (now Frederica Road) in Frederica by 1936. By 1938, DE&nbsp;12 was extended west to the Maryland border in Whiteleysburg.\nIn 1965, US&nbsp;113 was moved to a bypass to the east of Frederica, and DE&nbsp;12 was extended north on the former alignment of US&nbsp;113 to end at that route a short distance north of Frederica. In November&nbsp;2009, construction began for a grade-separated interchange at DE&nbsp;1 (which had replaced US&nbsp;113); the interchange was completed in June&nbsp;2011.\nMajor intersections\n|notes=Maryland state line; western terminus\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=DE&nbsp;1 exit&nbsp;86; eastern terminus\n}}\nSee also\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.aaroads.com/guides/de-012/ DE&nbsp;12 at AARoads.com]"
