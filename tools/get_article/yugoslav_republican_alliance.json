It declared support for a \"Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\" and declared that it opposed the Serbian monarchy taking the position of head of state of Yugoslavia, and refused to have the ethnicities of Yugoslavia be forced to be assimilated into being exclusively a singular Yugoslav identity.\nReferences"
