During this period, the Byzantine state reached its greatest extent since the Early Muslim conquests, and the Macedonian Renaissance in letters and arts began. The dynasty was named after its founder, Basil I the Macedonian who came from the theme of Macedonia in the region of Thrace.\nOrigins\nThe dynasty's ethnic origin is unknown, and has been a subject of debate. During Basil's reign, an elaborate genealogy was produced that purported that his ancestors were not mere peasants, as everyone believed, but descendants of the Arsacid (Arshakuni) kings of Armenia, Alexander the Great and also of Constantine the Great. Some Persian writers such as Hamza al-Isfahani or Al-Tabari, called Basil a Saqlabi, an ethnogeographic term that usually denoted the Slavs, but it can be interpreted as a generic term encompassing the inhabitants of the region between Constantinople and Bulgaria.\nThus, claims have been made for the dynasty's founder (Basil I) being of Armenian, Slavonic, or \"Armeno-Slavonic\" descent from his paternal side.\nThe author of the only dedicated biography of Basil I in English has concluded that it is impossible to be certain what the ethnic origins of the emperor were, though Basil was definitely reliant on the support of Armenians in prominent positions within the Byzantine Empire.\nList of rulers\n*Basil I the Macedonian (Βασίλειος Α') (811–886, ruled 867–886) – married Eudokia Ingerina, mistress of Michael III; died in hunting accident\n*Leo VI the Wise (Λέων ΣΤ') (866–912, ruled 886–912) &ndash; son of Eudokia Ingerina, legal son and heir of Basil I; possibly the natural son of Michael III; created church crisis with his fourth marriage—Zoe Karbonopsina, who took over as regent for their son, Constantine VII, in 914 and ruled the empire until 919\n*Alexander (Αλέξανδρος) (870–913, ruled 912–913) &ndash; son of Basil I, regent for nephew\n*Constantine VII the Purple-born (Κωνσταντῖνος Ζ') (905–959, ruled 913–920 and 945-959) &ndash; son of Leo VI and Zoe Karbonopsina; married Helena, daughter of Romanos Lekapenos\n*Romanos I Lekapenos (Ρωμανός A') (c. 870–948, ruled 920–944) &ndash; staged a successful coup in 919 and became senior emperor in 920; deposed in 944 and exiled\n*Romanos II the Purple-born (Ρωμανός Β') (938–963, ruled 959–963) &ndash; son of Constantine VII\n*Nikephoros II Phokas (Νικηφόρος Β' Φωκᾶς) (912–969, ruled 963–969) &ndash; successful general, married Romanos II's widow, regent for Basil; assassinated (Origin: Cappadocian)\n*John I Tzimiskes (Ιωάννης Α')(925-976, ruled 969–976) &ndash; successful general, brother-in-law of Romanos II, lover of Nikephoros's wife but banned from marriage, regent for Basil II and Constantine VIII\n*Basil II (Βασίλειος Β') the Bulgar-slayer (958–1025, ruled 976–1025) &ndash; son of Romanos II\n*Constantine VIII (Κωνσταντῖνος Η') (960-1028, ruled 1025–1028) &ndash; son of Romanos II; silent co-emperor with Basil II, sole emperor after his brother's death\n*Zoe (Ζωή) (c. 978–1050, ruled 1028–1050) &ndash; daughter of Constantine VIII\n*Romanos III Argyros (Ρωμανός Γ') (968–1034, ruled 1028–1034) &ndash; eparch of Constantinople; Zoe's first husband, arranged by Constantine VIII; murdered\n*Michael IV the Paphlagonian (Μιχαήλ Δ') (1010–1041, ruled 1034–1041) &ndash; Zoe's second husband\n*Michael V the Caulker (Μιχαήλ Ε') (1015–1042, ruled 1041–1042) &ndash; Michael IV's nephew, Zoe's adopted son\n*Theodora (Θεοδώρα) (980–1056, ruled 1042) &ndash; daughter of Constantine VIII, co-empress with Zoe\n*Constantine IX Monomachos (Κωνσταντῖνος Θ') (1000–1055, ruled 1042–1055) &ndash; Zoe's third husband\n*Theodora (Θεοδώρα) (ruled 1055–1056) &ndash; restored\nNon-dynastic\n*Michael VI (Μιχαήλ Ϛ') (ruled 1056–1057) &ndash; chosen by Theodora; deposed and entered monastery\nFamily tree\n* Basil I the Macedonian (813–886)\n** from his marriage to Maria:\n*** Constantine (865–878), co-emperor with his father\n*** Anastasia\n** from his marriage to empress Eudokia Ingerina:\n*** Leo VI the Wise (866–912)\n**** Eudokia (died 892)\n**** Anna, betrothed and married to Louis the Blind\n**** Basil (died 900)\n**** Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (905–959), married Helena Lekapene, daughter of Romanos I Lekapenos\n***** Romanos II (938–963) married to Bertha, daughter of Hugh of Italy king of Italy\n****** childless by his marriage to Bertha of Italy\n****** from his marriage to Theophano:\n******* Basil II the Bulgar-Slayer (957–1025)\n******* Constantine VIII (961–1028) married Helena, daughter of Alypius\n******** Eudokia\n******** Zoe (978–1050), married:\n********# Romanos III Argyros (ca. 968–1034)\n********# Michael IV the Paphlagonian (1015–1042)\n********# Constantine IX Monomachos (ca. 1000–1055)\n******** Theodora (980–1056)\n******* Anna Porphyrogeneta (963–1011), married Vladimir I of Kiev\n***** Agathe\n***** Theodora, married John I Tzimiskes\n*** Stephen I (867–893), Patriarch of Constantinople\n*** Alexander (870–913)\nGenealogy\nSee also\n* Lekapenos\n* Phokas (Byzantine family)\n* Byzantine Empire under the Macedonian dynasty\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
