Further reform came into effect in July 1855 for all parts of Lower Canada other than Montreal, Quebec City and Saint-Hyacinthe, which included provision for the creation of local councils for parishes and townships, the representation of towns and villages on county councils, and the formation of towns and villages by order in council upon the recommendation of the relevant county council. The municipal law of Lower Canada was consolidated into a single Act in 1860.\nMunicipalities written in bold are on their current form.\n1599 to 1793\n1599\n* Foundation of Tadoussac\n1608\n* 3 July: Foundation of Quebec City.\n1634\n* 4 July: Foundation of Trois-Rivières.\n1642\n* 17 May: Foundation of Ville-Marie.\n1793\n* Foundation of Sherbrooke.\n19th century\n1802\n* 17 May: Creation of Sherbrooke.\n1832\n* 1 January: Montréal and Quebec City became Cities.\n1841\n* 15 April: Creation of the Municipal Districts.\n1845\n* 1 July: Creation of 167 Municipalities, 115 Parishes and 39 Townships to replace the Municipal districts.
