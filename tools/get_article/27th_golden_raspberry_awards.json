Basic Instinct 2 (which was dubbed by the ceremony as \"Basically, It Stinks, Too\") and Little Man received the most nominations with seven each.\nAs has been the tradition, the nominations were announced the day before the Academy Awards nominations, with the award show scheduled one day before to the Academy Awards ceremony.\nIn recent years, the organizers had added awards that were for a single year only. The Most Tiresome Tabloid Targets category from the previous year was replaced with Worst Excuse for Family Entertainment, which \"salutes the death of quality G and PG-rated movie fare in 2006\".\nThe category Worst Remake or Sequel was split into two separate categories: Worst Prequel or Sequel and Worst Remake or Rip-off.\nFor the first time, the awards program was broadcast over the Internet on MSNBC.com, via cell phone. In an experimental live webcast (referred to as \"The Cell-E-Cast\"), the show was shot on a series of cell phones and transmitted live by NBC Media Productions.\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\" align=\"centre\"\n|-\n!
