It is native in the south of Central America from Nicaragua southward, the southern West Indies, and southward through northern South America to Bolivia and central Brazil. It is the national flower of Trinidad and Tobago.\nThis evergreen shrub or small tree grows to 6&nbsp;metres tall, with leaves up to 60&nbsp;cm long and 30&nbsp;cm broad. It is remarkable for its inflorescence, a verticillaster up to 50&nbsp;cm long with up to a dozen clusters with bright red bracts (up to 7&nbsp;by&nbsp;5&nbsp;cm) and small flowers with inconspicuous yellow petals.\nIts habitat is lowland, forests and second growth. Its optimum altitude is from sea level to 500&nbsp;m altitude. It is rarely found in areas above 500&nbsp;m.\nCultivation\nIt is widely grown as an ornamental tree. A cultivar, Warszewiczia coccinea 'David Auyong', which has a double row of bracts, is the most widely cultivated form. This plant originates from cuttings taken from a wild plant found growing along a Trinidad roadside in 1957. All double chaconias have been propagated by cuttings from this individual.\n, St. Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago]]\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/rubiaceae/ World Checklist of Rubiaceae]\n* [http://www.news.gov.tt/index.php?news=177 News.gov.tt: The National Flower]"
