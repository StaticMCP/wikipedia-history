      "text": "# 1918 Portuguese presidential election\n\nPresidential elections were held in Portugal on 16 December 1918. Following Portugal's 1911 constitution, the Congress of the Republic must elect the president in Lisbon instead of the Portuguese people.\nThe election was held two days after the assassination of the Portuguese president Sidónio Pais on 14 December 1918. There were a total of four candidates. At the first ballot quorum wasn't reached, so the election was repeated, this time with the necessary members present. National Republican João do Canto e Castro won against his opponents and he was elected as the new President of Portugal succeeding the late Sidónio Pais.\nResults\nReferences"
