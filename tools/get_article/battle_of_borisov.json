The Russian vanguard under Charles de Lambert eliminated the Franco-Polish force under Dombrowsky.\nBackground\nThe French had suffered a defeat just two weeks earlier during the Battle of Krasnoi. Napoleon's army amounted to no more than 20,000 combatants. However, the union with Victor, Oudinot, and Dombrowsky brought the numerical strength of the  back up to some 49,000 French combatants as well as about 40,000 stragglers. But Minsk had been occupied by Chichagov on 16 November 1812 who reached the Berezina with about 31,500 combatants.\nBattle\nOn the 21 November, the Russians under Lambert occupied Borisov in the morning before Oudinot could come up as the sentries had been ambushed. Dombrowski had about 2,000 men left out of his total force. The Russian casualties were about 2,000. Lambert was seriously wounded in the leg.\nAftermath\nThe Russians destroyed the bridge at Borisov on 22 November. The Battle of Loschniza is Oudinot's reaction.\nSee also\n*List of battles of the French invasion of Russia\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
