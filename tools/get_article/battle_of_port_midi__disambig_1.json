Although Hadi loyalists seized the port, the Houthi fighters along with the popular committees  managed to conduct some attacks around Midi. The conflict also had spillovers in the rest of the Hajjah Governorate. On 26 January 2017, Hadi loyalists extended their control to Harad District in Hajjah Governorate.\nThe main battle\nThe battle began on 19 December 2015, when the loyalists captured the city of Haradh after fierce fighting left dozens dead on both sides. The port was a very strategic location for the Houthis because Port Midi was used to supply weapons to the capital, Sana'a, and for using the surrounding area to launch missiles against Saudi Arabian villages. At the end of December, the loyalists advanced very quickly as they managed to capture the surrounding area, pushing the Houthis back. The Houthi fighters suffered airstrikes from the Saudi Arabian coalition.\nOn 7 January 2016, the loyalists captured Port Midi after reported heavy fighting, but despite losing Port Midi, the Houthis, along with a battalion of troops loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, maintained control over a long stretch of the coastline.\nInsurgency\nOn 8 February, popular committees aligned with the Houthi Government attacked Saudi soldiers moving to reinforce the Midi area, destroying at least 2 armored vehicles before escaping.\nFour days later, on 12 February, fighters of popular committees backed by the Houthi government shot down a Saudi surveillance plane flying in Midi district, with no reported casualties. On 6 March, Saudi jets launched 11 raids on Midi district, targeting alleged pro-Houthi targets.\nIn late March, a Saudi airstrike killed more than 78 civilians, including 22 children. The death toll later rose to 107, with some humanitarian organisations claiming that 129 civilians were killed in the airstrikes and more than 100 wounded.\nOn 10 July, a local pro-Hadi commander was killed by a missile strike launched by pro-Houthi army forces.\nOn 3 September, Houthi forces launched an offensive in the region, killing at least 11 soldiers and wounding another 28, according to pro-Hadi forces. Saudi warplanes also launched at least 15 airstrikes against the advancing Houthi forces. Reports also emerged that Houthi fighters captured the port from Hadi loyalists.\nOn 21 September, at least 26 civilians were killed and 60 wounded when missiles from an Arab coalition air strike hit a residential area where rebel leaders were staying in Hodeidah, according to medics and residents.\nIn mid-November, fifteen loyalists and 23 fighters were killed in the clashes as loyalists launched an attack on three fronts to recapture the town of Midi and nearby Haradh.\nOn the night of 22 November, three soldiers were killed and four wounded by Houthi sniper fire near Midi. On the other day, fighting around the town of Midi killed 18 Houthis and four government soldiers, according to a loyalist commander on the ground.\nOn 26 November, pro-Hadi forces announced 22 Houthis were killed in artillery shelling and clashes with government forces in Midi district.\nHouthi forces retreated from the contested town of Midi, following clashes on December 5, according to pro-Hadi government sources.\nIn January 2017, pro-Hadi loyalists pushed back the Houthis and Saleh troops more than 40&nbsp;km and secured the Midi and Harad fronts. Air and artillery strikes from Saudi and Arab coalition forced the Houthis to retreat. It allowed Pro-Hadi forces to clear a wide area around port of Midi and extend their control up to the interior of Harad district in Hajjah Governorate.\nOn 30 January 2017, at least 37 Houthis and allied fighters were killed or injured, according to a statement issued by the Yemeni army's Fifth Brigade.
