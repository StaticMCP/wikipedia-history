However, Duke Conan promptly informed the Norman Duke that he would take the opportunity to invade the latter's Duchy.\nLoss of Breton lands\nDuke William's army therefore set out to appease the Breton threat.  While outside the monastery of Mont Saint-Michel, two Norman soldiers became mired in quicksand. Harold Godwinson, the Earl of Wessex and future King of England, saved them.\n(c.1066) showing Breton defenders within the castle of Dinan throwing down spears onto the Norman attackers, whilst some of the latter hold burning torches with which to burn down the wooden fortifications]]\n(d.1066) surrendering the keys (hanging from the tip of a lance) to the castle of Dinan, to the forces of William, Duke of Normandy, following the siege and Battle of Dinan]]\nBattle of Dinan\nThe Battle of Dinan occurred in 1065.  Harold fought on the side of Duke William, whose army had chased Duke Conan from Dol-de-Bretagne to Rennes. Duke Conan finally surrendered at Château de Dinan, Brittany. The battle is recalled in the Bayeux Tapestry (see illustration).\nDeath of the Breton lord\nDuring Duke Conan's 1066 campaign against Anjou, he took Pouancé and Segré, and arrived in Château-Gontier. There he was found dead on 11 December after donning poisoned riding gloves. Duke William was widely suspected.\nAftermath\nDuke Conan II was succeeded by his sister, Hawise, whose marriage to Hoel of Cornwall may have been a political move to consolidate and stabilize the east and west regions of the duchy.\nBretons would eventually invade England with the Normans in 1066 mainly as cavalry, which they specialized in.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
