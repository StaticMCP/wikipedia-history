The school is located next to the Gautrain Rosebank Station. Kingsmead College caters for girls from Grade 000 to Grade 12 and has around 870 students.\nHistory\nKingsmead College was founded by Doris Vera Thompson in October 1933 and in 1934 opened its doors to 136 girls, from Grade 1 to Post-Matriculation.\nOver the years, houses and gardens adjacent to the original property were purchased, providing further buildings needed to cater for a steadily increasing number of young girls coming to the school.\nDoris Vera Thompson helped to plan St Brigid's Chapel on the school grounds and she considered the simple building to be the “heart of the school.” From 1939 onwards, the Boarders used the Chapel regularly until 1999, when the Boarding House was closed.\nEach class attends Chapel Assembly regularly during the term.\nThe chapel is open daily during the week from 07h00 to 17h00 and, on Sundays, it is used by the Kingsmead Christian Fellowship for Christian worship and prayer. Many Old Kingsmeadians return to the chapel for weddings and Christenings. The chapel is dedicated to St. Brigid.\nOrganisation\nKingsmead College teaches Grades 000-Matric.\nJunior School\nThe Junior School consists of Grades 1–7.
