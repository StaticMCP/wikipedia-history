It was founded by Dr. Mahbubar Rahman, a retired professor from the Department of History at the University of Rajshahi. The archive aims to collect, document, and safeguard resources related to the history and heritage of Bangladesh.\nBackground\nDr. Mahbubar Rahman was inspired to establish Heritage Archives after visiting a similar repository in Netherlands in the 1990s. The building was officially established in 2006. It was expanded into a 3-floor-building by the Ministry of Cultural Affairs in 2011.\nReferences"
