It was formed against France on 27 December 1917 from the former Heeresgruppe Woyrsch command.  It served exclusively on the Western Front and was dissolved on 2 January 1919.\nHistory\n18th Army was one of three armies (along with 17th Army and 19th Army) formed in late 1917 / early 1918 with forces withdrawn from the Eastern Front.  They were in place to take part in Ludendorff's German spring offensive.  The Germans had realised that their only remaining chance of victory was to defeat the Allies before the overwhelming human and matériel resources of the United States could be deployed. They also had the temporary advantage in numbers afforded by nearly 50 divisions freed by the Russian withdrawal from the war (Treaty of Brest-Litovsk).\nAt the end of the war it was serving as part of Heeresgruppe Deutscher Kronprinz.\nOrder of Battle, 30 October 1918\nBy the end of the war, the 18th Army was organised as:\n{| style=\"float: right;\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"font-size: 100%; border: gray solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center;\"\n|- style=\"background-color:grey; color:black;\"\n! colspan=\"3\" | Organization of 18th Army on 30 October 1918\n|-\n|- style=\"background-color:grey; color:black;\"\n!
