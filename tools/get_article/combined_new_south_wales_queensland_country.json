Unlike the 2001 tour, the Lions faced a combined team made up of players representing the Queensland Country and New South Wales Country rugby unions.\nThe match was the fourth game of the tour and was played in Newcastle on 11 June 2013 at Hunter Stadium. Referee Steve Walsh was in charge of the game.\nThe Combined Country team was coached by former Wallaby prop, Cameron Blades.\nSquad\nOn 10 June a 23-man squad was announced to play the British & Irish Lions. Included were nine players from Super Rugby, 10 Country players (seven QLD, three NSW) and four players from Premier rugby in New South Wales and Queensland.\nReds flanker Beau Robinson was in the initial squad but withdrew following an injury he suffered while playing for the Reds against the Lions on 8 June. He was replaced by his Reds' teammate, Jarrad Butler. The other player forced to withdraw from the squad due to injury was NSW Country flyhalf Ben Greentree. He was replaced in the starting lineup by Queensland Country player Shaun McCarthy, with fellow Queensland Country player Rory Arnold brought into the lineup on the bench to complete the squad.\nMelbourne Rebels player Tim Davidson was named as captain.\nHead coach: Cameron Blades\nForwards\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Player\n!Position\n!Club\n!Region\n|-\n|Tom Kearney\n|Hooker\n|Noosa Dolphins\n|QLD Country\n|-\n|Joshua Mann-Rea\n|Hooker\n|Brumbies\n|Super Rugby\n|-\n|Rikki Abraham\n|Prop\n|Teachers West\n|QLD Country\n|-\n|Dylan Evans\n|Prop\n|Wanderers R.U.C.\n|NSW Country\n|-\n|Haydn Hirsimaki\n|Prop\n|S.C.
