      "text": "# Monument Draw\n\nMonument Draw is either of two ephemeral streams that rise in New Mexico and flow into Texas. Both take their name from Monument Springs,  west-northwest of Monument, New Mexico. One rises  west of Monument Springs and flows generally south into the Pecos River. The other rises  east of Monument Springs and south of Hobbs, New Mexico, and flows generally east-southeast to join with Seminole Draw to form Mustang Draw, which then flows generally south to then form Beals Creek, which ultimately flows into the Colorado River of Texas.\nSee also\n*List of rivers of Texas\nReferences\n*\n*[https://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/ USGS Geographic Names Information Service]\n*USGS Hydrologic Unit Map - State of Texas (1974)"
