      "text": "# Edward Barnard and Sons\n\nEdward Barnard and Sons was a firm of British silversmiths. They created the Lily font, a large silver gilt baptismal font used in the christening services of members of the British Royal family.\nThe company's origins date back to about 1680, when the silversmith Anthony Nelme (d. 1722) established a firm in Ave Maria Lane, London. Edward Barnard (d. 1855) was first manager and in 1829 became the proprietor, trading as Edward Barnard & Sons, with his sons Edward Barnard (d. 1868), John Barnard and William Barnard (d. 1851). Edward and his sons were buried on the western side of Highgate Cemetery. In 1838, the firm moved to Angel Street, London.\nThe Lily font was commissioned by Queen Victoria from Edward Barnard and Sons, for the christening of her first child, Victoria, Princess Royal on 10 February 1840, her parents' first wedding anniversary.\nIn 1898, they moved to Fetter Lane, and in 1920, to Hatton Garden, London. In 1977, they became a subsidiary of Padgett & Braham, and closed in 2003.\nReferences"
