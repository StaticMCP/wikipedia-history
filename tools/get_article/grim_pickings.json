On the first day of the harvest, various family tensions emerge among the 13 adults, largely centred around family matriarch Betsy Tender (Lorraine Bayly), who has a desire to control and manipulate all around her. Dinner is interrupted by the arrival of Damian Treloar (Brian Vriends), the recently divorced ex-husband of Betsy's daughter Anna (Eva Hamburg). Treloar is disliked by almost every member of the group, and ultimately spends the night in his van outside the house. The next morning he is found dead in the orchard, wearing Betsy's parka, next to several half-eaten apples that appear to have been deliberately sprayed with pesticide.\nWily and unorthodox Inspector Toby (Max Cullen) and his bewildered new assistant Detective Constable McClinchy (Tony Harvey) arrive to investigate. The suspects include Anna; Aunt Alice; Betsy; her meek husband Wilf (Neil Fitzpatrick); their loyal son Chris (Scott Higgins) and his wife, nurse Susie (Rosey Jones), who feels oppressed by the family; Chris' longtime friend Nick, a jealous academic specialising in  psychology (Stuart McCreery) and his de facto partner, Jill (Helen O'Connor), an editor who was recently working on a book with Damian; and a single mother who lives across the street, Theresa (Lynda Gibson). Also in attendance are another couple who are friends of the family, Kate (Catherine Wilkin) and Jeremy (David Cameron) and their young daughter Zoe (Caroline Winnall). This year, Kate has brought her friend - eccentric freelance researcher Verity Birdwood (Liddy Clark).\nAn outsider with limited people skills but a keen eye, Verity begins to suspect the death is not what it seems when she learns that the elderly Aunt Alice - whom most people think is going senile – is adamant that she didn't spray the apples this year. When Nick leaves immediately after the body is discovered, and doesn't come back for 24 hours, he becomes the prime suspect for Inspector Toby. Verity doesn't believe he can be the killer, so she sets out to investigate.\nProduction\nThe novel is set in the New South Wales Blue Mountains, but the film was shot in the Adelaide Hills. The miniseries was produced by the South Australian Film Corporation and aired on the Nine Network. The miniseries was released on DVD by Umbrella Entertainment in 2021.\nThe miniseries is largely faithful to the novel. However the character of Verity is portrayed quite differently. She is blonde rather than brunette, and a more extroverted and confident figure on screen. Rodney is the only character from the novel who was removed from the miniseries. Inspector Toby is a handsome character in the books who ultimately becomes a love interest to Verity; in the miniseries, this role is taken by Det. Con McClinchy, with Toby becoming an older and very eccentric figure.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096603/ Grim Pickings] at IMDb\n*[https://www.austlit.edu.au/austlit/page/6060522 Grim Pickings] at AustLit"
