The battle was indecisive, but a minor success for the Dano-Norwegian fleet commanded by Jørgen Vind, assisted by Grabow and King Christian IV, over a Swedish fleet commanded by Klas Fleming, assisted by Ulfsparre and Bjelkenstjerna.\nCourse of the battle\nThe Dano-Norwegian fleet consisted of 40 ships with about 927 guns, and the Swedish fleet consisted of 34 ships with 1018 guns and 7 fireships.\nThe Dano-Norwegian fleet, coming from the east, and the Swedish fleet, coming from the west, met just north of the island of Fehmarn (Femern). The Swedes turned and sailed south along the west side of Fehmarn, inshore of a shoal, while the Danes followed a little further offshore. The Swedes turned north and swung around before resuming their westward course alongside the Danes. As the battle progressed the fleets turned before the wind, north and then back east south of the island of Langeland. As they approached the island of Lolland the Swedes turned south and eventually ended up in Kiel Bay while the Danes continued south-east, anchoring to the east of Fehmarn.\nCasualties\nNeither side had lost a ship. Dano-Norwegian casualties were 37 killed and 170 wounded, and Swedish casualties were 32 killed and 69 wounded. Among the Dano-Norwegian casualties were commander Jørgen Vind, who died of his wounds soon after the battle, and the king, whose wounds included the loss of an eye.\nOutcome\nThe exact result of the battle is disputed by historians. Some claim that the battle ended with a Dano-Norwegian victory, with others claiming that it ended inconclusively.\nImpact\nWhile the Dano-Norwegian fleet gained a minor success when it subsequently managed to incarcerate the Swedish fleet at the Bay of Kiel, the battle was not decisive: in a subsequent encounter, the Dano-Norwegian navy was utterly defeated off the Fehmarn coast. The significance of the battle lies rather in it being retrospectively perceived as the last Dano-Norwegian victory over her long-time adversary, Sweden, in the two countries' struggle for control of the dominium maris baltici, as well as the heroization of the Dano-Norwegian king's personal commitment during the battle, memorized in the famous Marstrand painting and the first lines of the Danish royal anthem Kong Christian stod ved højen mast.\nList of ships involved\nDenmark-Norway\nFirst Squadron:\n*Patientia 48 (1st Sq. flag)\n*Oldenborg 42\n*Stormar 32 (Henrik Mund)\n*Fides 28\n*Svan 26 (Lucas Henriksen)\n*Prinds Christian (merchantman)\n*Lam 16\n*Havhest 14\n*Jomfrusvend 6\n*Ørn 4\nSecond Squadron:\n*Tre Løver 46\n*Lindorm 38\n*Kronet Fisk 20\n*Emanuel (merchantman)\n*Forgyldte Stokfisk (merchantman)\n*S.
