These classifications allow for competition between the schools, but give inherent advantages to Delaware.  Prior to 1980, Delaware competed in Division II, placing them on the same level as West Chester. , there are no future meetings scheduled in this series.\nGame results\n| team2 = West Chester\n| team2style =\n| September 27, 1941 | Newark, DE | Tie | 7 | Tie | 7\n| September 25, 1942 | Wilmington, DE | Delaware | 20 | West Chester | 0\n| October 19, 1945 | West Chester, PA | Tie | 6 | Tie | 6\n| October 9, 1948 | Wilmington, DE | Delaware | 19 | West Chester | 0\n| November 19, 1949 | Wilmington, DE | Delaware | 27 | West Chester | 14\n| September 30, 1950 | Wilmington, DE | Delaware | 16 | West Chester | 13\n| October 6, 1951 | Wilmington, DE | Delaware | 47 | West Chester | 20\n| October 11, 1952 | Wilmington, DE | West Chester | 24 | Delaware | 20\n| October 10, 1953 | Newark, DE | West Chester | 27 | Delaware | 13\n| September 25, 1954 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 40 | West Chester | 6\n| September 22, 1956 | Newark, DE | West Chester | 10 | Delaware | 7\n| October 19, 1968 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 28 | West Chester | 0\n| October 18, 1969 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 24 | West Chester | 8\n| September 12, 1970 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 39 | West Chester | 22\n| October 23, 1971 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 47 | West Chester | 28\n| October 21, 1972 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 31 | West Chester | 14\n| September 15, 1973 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 49 | West Chester | 14\n| November 16, 1974 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 31 | West Chester | 3\n| November 15, 1975 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 35 | West Chester | 7\n| November 13, 1976 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 42 | West Chester | 7\n| September 17, 1977 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 17 | West Chester | 15\n| September 16, 1978 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 56 | West Chester | 0\n| September 15, 1979 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 42 | West Chester | 6\n| September 13, 1980 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 28 | West Chester | 7\n| November 21, 1981 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 31 | West Chester | 14\n| November 13, 1982 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 55 | West Chester | 13\n| September 10, 1983 | Newark, DE | West Chester | 35 | Delaware | 27\n| September 22, 1984 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 21 | West Chester | 20\n| October 5, 1985 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 37 | West Chester | 22\n| September 20, 1986 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 33 | West Chester | 31\n| September 19, 1987 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 28 | West Chester | 21\n| November 12, 1988 | Newark, DE | West Chester | 33 | Delaware | 13\n| September 23, 1989 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 41 | West Chester | 21\n| September 22, 1990 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 13 | West Chester | 12\n| August 31, 1991 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 28 | West Chester | 0\n| September 26, 1992 | Newark, DE | West Chester | 21 | Delaware | 20\n| September 25, 1993 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 56 | West Chester | 41\n| September 24, 1994 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 58 | West Chester | 55\n| September 9, 1995 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 49 | West Chester | 21\n| September 21, 1996 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 24 | West Chester | 17\n| September 20, 1997 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 28 | West Chester | 7\n| September 19, 1998 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 42 | West Chester | 21\n| September 18, 1999 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 28 | West Chester | 0\n| September 23, 2000 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 84 | West Chester | 0\n| September 21, 2002 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 31 | West Chester | 10\n| September 20, 2003 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 49 | West Chester | 7\n| September 18, 2004 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 24 | West Chester | 6\n| September 17, 2005 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 42 | West Chester | 21\n| September 9, 2006 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 30 | West Chester | 7\n| September 8, 2007 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 41 | West Chester | 14\n| September 13, 2008 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 48 | West Chester | 20\n| September 4, 2009 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 35 | West Chester | 0\n| September 2, 2010 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 31 | West Chester | 0\n| September 10, 2011 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 28 | West Chester | 17\n| August 30, 2012 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 41 | West Chester | 21\n}}\nA game was scheduled for September 15, 2001, that was cancelled following the September 11 attacks.\nSee also\n* List of NCAA college football rivalry games\nReferences"
