It was founded with a $10 million fund courtesy of the Qatari state following the second \"Forum on Democracy and Political Reform in the Arab World\", organized by the National Human Rights Committee and sponsored by the Emir. Its stated mission is \"advocating for democracy as a culture, a way of life, and the best system for good governance\". Qatar itself remains an authoritarian monarchy under the rule of the Al Thani royal family.\nFounding\nThe second \"Forum on Democracy and Political Reform in the Arab World\" was held in Doha from 27 to 29 May 2007, sponsored by then-Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and inaugurated by his son, then-heir apparent and current Emir as of 2025, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. On the third day of the conference, in a session attended by many senior government officials, Sheikha Moza bint Nasser Al-Missned, wife of Hamad and mother of Tamim, announced the establishment of the ADF, and by July of the same year she was signed as founder and first member of the board on an Amiri Decree approving the establishment of the foundation.\nMission and resources\nADF aims at promoting democracy in the Arab region. It provides material and moral support to organizations and activists in this field, by using all possible peaceful means, and by channeling all human and financial resources available at the local, regional and international levels.
