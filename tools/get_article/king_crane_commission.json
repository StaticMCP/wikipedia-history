The Commission visited areas of Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, and Anatolia, surveyed local public opinion, and assessed its view on the best course of action for the region. Originally meant to be led by French, British, Italian, and American representatives, it ended as an investigation conducted solely by the United States government after the other countries withdrew to avoid the risk of being \"confronted by recommendations from their own appointed delegates which might conflict with their policies\". With the withdrawal of other allied nations, the commission lost any real credibility.\nThe Commission submitted its report to the Paris Peace Conference in August 1919. Its working being undercut from the beginning by France and the United Kingdom's pact, the Sykes–Picot Agreement, and colonialist designs, the Peace Conference had largely concluded the area's future by the time the report was finished.David Fromkin, A Peace to End All Peace, 1989, pp 396-97The proposal was viewed as childish by the French and British career officials, who did not believe that public opinion, in the European and American sense, existed in the Middle East. Nonetheless the British Prime Minister tried to make the best of it by attempting to get the commission to focus exclusively on the claims of France--and the resistance to those claims by the Arabs whom France sought to rule.... The British, like the French, had staked out an enormous claim in the Middle East, but Lloyd George successfully kept the British claims from being scrutinised. When President Wilson's Commission of Inquiry went out to ascertain the wishes of the Middle Eastern peoples, it did not go to Mesopotamia, where British India had instituted direct rule.\nContext\nof the United States was an avowed opponent of secret diplomacy.]]\nAt the Paris Peace Conference, France and Britain sought to divide the Ottoman Empire among themselves using the mandate system while President Wilson sought to oppose such plans. The conference began in 1919. In the wake of World War I, the participants were exhausted and particularly interested in the fate of their imperial rival, the Ottoman Empire.\nThe French, in particular, had extensive claims in the Middle East. Since as early 1900, the French began to build relationships and claims on political, moral and economic grounds. They created a role for themselves as the traditional protector of Lebanese Christians. The French supported the Maronites in Lebanon with missionaries and schools, deepening their relationship with the Christian religious community. Many Lebanese Christians feared domination as a religious minority and vocally supported the French Mandate. This gave the French political credibility in the region.\nFinally, French capitalists controlled 63% of the Ottoman Public Debt. This economic tie made France very concerned about the fate of the Ottoman Empire. The French were adamant that because of their unique relationship with Syria, they should be one of the nations to receive a mandate in Syria.\nMeanwhile, after World War I, people in the Levant, including Palestine, sought independence due to the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and global revolutionary activities, namely, the “year of traveling revolutions” across the North Africa and the Middle East. They aimed to establish independent nation-states, inspired by President Wilson's emphasis on self-determination. The King–Crane Commission played a crucial role in evaluating their aspirations. Many had relied on Wilson's assurances of security and autonomy, expecting democratic principles to guide the postwar period. They hoped for Western support to achieve self-rule, marking the end of imperialism in the Middle East. However, their disillusionment was palpable as reflected in the reactions during the King–Crane Commission, where \"William Yale’s disappointed expectations of Arab nationalist enthusiasm... found insufficiently proven by the Arabs' lackluster emotional reactions.\nSecret negotiations\nThe French allied themselves with the British in order to press their claims. While the British did not have the same connection with the Middle East, they were still interested in expanding and defending their existing colonial empire. In what came to be known as the Sykes-Picot agreement, the French and the British agreed to divide the Middle East between the two of them after the war. When they reached the Paris Peace Conference, this agreement made negotiation on the Middle East nearly impossible. When American diplomats proposed the King–Crane Commission to investigate popular sentiment in the region of Syria, both French and British diplomats greeted it with public approval, but behind the scenes the outcome had already been decided. Lord Snell criticized the British government's handling of Arab nationalism, noting that the King–Crane Commission report commented: \"Arab nationalism in Palestine has been artificially puffed up by methods which the Government should never have allowed. Only a little firmness is needed to deflate it.\nThe British also engaged in secret negotiations with the emir of Mecca in the Hussein-McMahon correspondence before the conference occurred. Ultimately, this would cause the British to fall into poor standing with the Arabs because they would betray Arab trust by conducting simultaneous negotiations in the Sykes-Picot agreement and the Balfour Declaration.\nThe commission\nThe Commission was originally proposed by the United States as an international effort to assess the state of opinion there with regard to [the post-Ottoman Middle East], and the social, racial, and economic conditions. The plan received little support from the other nations, with many claimed delays. The Americans gradually realized that the British and French had already come to their own backroom deals about the future of the region, and new information could only muddy the waters. So, the United States alone sponsored the commission.\nThe Commission's representatives appointed by President Woodrow Wilson were Henry Churchill King, a theologian and fellow college president (of Oberlin College), and Charles R. Crane, a prominent Democratic Party contributor.\nThe dispatch of the Commission, combined with Wilson's claim that the “nationalities which are now under Turkish rule should be assured an undoubted security of life and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of an autonomous development,” sparked optimism in the Arab world that the era of imperialism was coming to an end. The Arabs united to form their political proposals, based on ideas of self-determination and minority rights.\nThe Commission's effectiveness was hampered by the fact that it was the British army that actually protected them and controlled the translators, giving a skewed view of opinion where it was considerably easier to decry the French than the British. In spite of this, based on interviews with local elites, the Commission concluded that, while independence was preferred, the Americans were considered the second-best choice for a colonial power, the British the third-best, and the French easily the worst choice.\nBased on these interviews, King concluded that while the Middle East was \"not ready\" for independence, a colonial government would not serve the people well either. He recommended instead that the Americans move in to occupy the region, because only the United States could be trusted to guide the people to self-sufficiency and independence rather than become an imperialist occupier. From King's personal writings, it seems that his overriding concern was the morally correct course of action, not necessarily tempered by politics or pragmatism. The Republicans had regained control of the United States Senate in the 1918 midterm elections. In light of Republican isolationism, the probability of a huge military involvement and occupation overseas, even given British and French approval, was practically nil.\nThe British Foreign Office was willing to allow either the United States or Great Britain to administer the proposed Palestine mandate, but not the French or the Italian governments.Minutes of the Eastern Committee, UK Archives, PRO CAB 27/24. The point ended up being moot in any case, as Lloyd George and Georges Clemenceau, heads of governments of Great Britain and France, prevailed in drafting the provisions of the San Remo conference and the Treaty of Sèvres. Lloyd George commented that \"the friendship of France is worth ten Syrias.\" France received Syria while Britain would get Mesopotamia (Iraq) and Palestine, contrary to the expressed wishes of both the interviewees and the Commission itself. In the United States, the report floundered with Wilson's sickness and later death.\nDelay in publication\nThe Report was not intended to be published until the US Senate actually passed the Treaty of Versailles, which it never did. As a result, the report was only released to the public in 1922, after the Senate and House had passed a joint resolution favoring the establishment of a Jewish National Home in Palestine along the lines of the Balfour Declaration. Public opinion was divided when it was learned that the Arab majority had requested an American mandate with a democratically elected constituent assembly.\nConclusions regarding Syria, Palestine, and Lebanon\nThe commission's \"Report upon Syria\" covered the Arab territories of the defunct Ottoman Syria, then under the Occupied Enemy Territory Administration. This area covered would today encompass Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, and Jordan, as well as Hatay and Cilicia.\nThe commission's visit to the region was 42 days long, from June 10 to July 21, 1919; 15 days were spent in OETA South, 10 in OETA West, 15 in OETA East, and 2 in OETA North. With respect to OETA North (\"Cilicia\"), the Commission \"did not endeavor to give thorough hearings... feeling that it is not seriously to be considered a part of Syria, and desiring not to open up as yet the question of the Turkish-speaking portion of the former Turkish Empire.\" The population estimates included in the report are as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n|\n| OETA South\n| OETA West\n| OETA East\n| Totals\n|-\n| Muslims\n| 515,000\n| 600,000\n| 1,250,000\n| 2,365,000\n|-\n| Christians\n| 62,500\n| 400,000\n| 125,000\n| 587,500\n|-\n| Druses\n|\n| 60,000\n| 80,000\n| 140,000\n|-\n| Jews\n| 65,000\n| 15,000\n| 30,000\n| 110,000\n|-\n| Others\n| 5,000\n| 20,000\n| 20,000\n| 45,000\n|-\n| Totals\n| 647,500\n| 1,095,000\n| 1,505,000\n|\n|-\n| Grand Total\n|\n|\n|\n| 3,247,500\n|}\nThe Commission Report, which was published in 1922, concluded that the Middle East was not ready for independence and urged mandates be established on the territories whose purpose was to accompany a process of transition to self-determination.\nThe Commission hoped for a \"Syria\" built along liberal and nationalistic grounds that would become a modern democracy that protected the rights of its minorities. The Commission succeeded in convincing many of the educated, secular elite of this goal, but this didn't affect the negotiations at Versailles. Historian James Gelvin believes that the Commission actually weakened the stature of the pro-Western elites in Syria, as their vocal support of complete independence made no impact upon the result. The French Mandate of Syria was the result regardless, and the native elites were left either powerless or granted power only at the whim of the French. This helped set back the cause of an actual Syrian liberal democracy in Gelvin's view.\nAlthough the commission was sympathetic toward Zionism, the Balfour Declaration's requirement that \"nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights existing in non-Jewish communities in Palestine\" led the commission to recommend \"that only a greatly reduced Zionist program be attempted by the Peace Conference, and even that, only very gradually initiated.\" The commission found that \"Zionists looked forward to a practically complete dispossession of the present non-Jewish inhabitants of Palestine, by various forms of purchase\". Nearly 90% of the Palestinian population was emphatically against the entire Zionist program.\nThe report noted that there is a principle that the wishes of the local population must be taken into account and that there is widespread anti-Zionist feeling in Palestine and Syria, and the holy nature of the land to Christians and Moslems as well as Jews must preclude solely Jewish dominion. It also noted that Jews at that time constituted only 10% of the population of Palestine.\nThe Commission Report was skeptical of the viability of a Jewish state in \"Syria\". The logic of the Commission went along the lines that the first principle to be respected must be self-determination. It pointed out that \"feeling against the Zionist program is not confined to Palestine\", but \"people throughout Syria\" were also against the formation of a Jewish state. It concluded that the only way to establish a viable Jewish state would be with armed force to enforce it. This was precisely what the Commission wanted to avoid, so they dismissed the idea, saying that Zionists anticipated \"a practically complete dispossession of the present non-Jewish inhabitants to Palestine, by various forms of purchase\". That said, there would be nothing wrong with Jews coming to \"Israel\" and simply living as Jewish Syrian citizens, but noted \"nor can the erection of such a Jewish State be accomplished without the gravest trespass upon the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine\". The latter statement was based on the assumption that an army of at least 50,000 would be required to establish Jewish ownership by force. In respect to the creation of a Jewish state in the Middle East, the report cautioned \"Not only you as president but the American people as a whole should realise that if the American government decided to support the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, they are committing the American people to the use of force in that area, since only by force can a Jewish state in Palestine be established or maintained.\"\nAbout the international importance of Palestine, the report noted:\n::\"The fact that the Arabic-speaking portion of the Turkish Empire has been the birthplace of the three great religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and that Palestine contains places sacred to all three, makes inevitably a center of interest and concern for the whole civilised world. No solution which is merely local or has only a single people in mind can avail.\"\nNarrating the fear felt by Christians and Muslims over their holy places, it mentions: \"With the best possible intentions, it may be doubted whether the Jews could possibly seem to either Christians or Moslems proper guardians of the holy places, or custodians of the Holy Land as a whole. ..... The places which are most sacred to Christians-those having to do with Jesus-and which are also sacred to Moslems, are not only not sacred to Jews, but abhorrent to them. It is simply impossible, under those circumstances, for Moslems and Christians to feel satisfied to have these places in Jewish hands, or under the custody of Jews.\" The Commission recommended to include Palestine in a united Syrian State, the holy places being cared for by an International and Inter-religious Commission, in which also the Jews would have representation. All Syria should become under a single Mandate, led by a Power desired by the people, with America as first choice.\nResults of the petitions received\nThe King–Crane Commission created \"the first-ever survey of Arab public opinion,\" but its results went largely unheeded. The table below shows results of the petitions received from OETA South (became Palestine), OETA West (became Lebanon and Western Syria) and OETA East (became Syria and Transjordan).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! !! colspan=2 | OETA South !! colspan=2 | OETA West !! colspan=2 | OETA East !! colspan=2 | Syria Complete\n|-\n|  || No. || Per Cent. || No. || Per Cent. || No. || Per Cent || No. || Per Cent\n|-\n| Total Number of Petitions Received: || 260 ||  || 446 ||  || 1157 ||  || 1863 ||\n|-\n| A—Territorial Limits: ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n| 1.
