Originally two stories, the brick building was expanded in 1870 with a third story that includes a Mansard roof and dormers. A later expansion added a 2-story annex to the building.\nThe building was constructed for Dr. Walter Warfield (June 17, 1760 – March 12, 1826), a physician who served in the Continental Army during the American Revolution and who was admitted as an original member of The Society of the Cincinnati in the state of Maryland.   Warfield was a distant cousin of Elisha Warfield, both descendants of John Warfield (1672–1718) of Anne Arundel County, Maryland. Walter Warfield was a professor of midwifery in the medical department of Transylvania University in 1801, but his tenure may have been brief. Prior to construction of the Warfield Building, he practiced \"physic and surgery\" at the former offices of Samuel Brown and Elisha Warfield. In 1807 Walter Warfield purchased 27,500 acres of land in Montgomery County, although he may not have lived there. The previous owner had been John Jordan, namesake of Jordan's Row.\nReferences\nExternal links"
