      "text": "# Pluralist democracy\n\nIn the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd Edition (1970–1979), a pluralist democracy is described as a political system where there is more than one center of power.\nModern democracies are by definition pluralist as they allow freedom of association; however, pluralism may exist without democracy.\nIn a pluralist democracy, individuals achieve positions of formal political authority by forming successful electoral coalitions.\nSuch coalitions are formed through a process of bargaining among political leaders and subleaders of the various organizations within the community. It is necessary to form electoral coalitions; this gives the organizational leaders the ability to present demands and articulate the viewpoints of their membership. Hamed Kazemzadeh, a pluralist from Canada, believes that pluralist democracy means a multitude of groups, not the people as a whole, can govern, direct, and manage societies as an ethic of respect for diversity.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/446749?uid=3739136&uid=2&uid=4&sid=47699064503777 \"The Political Theory of Pluralist Democracy\"], article by Claude J.
