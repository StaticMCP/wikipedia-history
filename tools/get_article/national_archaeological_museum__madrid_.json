It is located on Calle de Serrano beside the Plaza de Colón, sharing its building with the National Library of Spain. It is one of the National Museums of Spain and it is attached to the Ministry of Culture.\nHistory\nThe museum was founded in 1867 by a Royal Decree of Isabella II as a depository for numismatic, archaeological, ethnographical and decorative art collections of the Spanish monarchs. The establishment of the museum was predated by a previous unmaterialised proposal by the Royal Academy of History in 1830 to create a museum of antiquities.\nThe museum was originally located in the Embajadores district of Madrid. In 1895, it moved to a building designed specifically to house it, a neoclassical design by architect Francisco Jareño, built from 1866 to 1892. In 1968, renovation and extension works considerably increased its area. The museum closed for renovation in 2008 and reopened in April 2014.\nFollowing a restructuring of the collection in the 1940s, its former pieces relative to the section of American Ethnography were transferred to the Museum of the Americas, while other pieces from abroad were destined to the National Museum of Ethnography and to the National Museum of Decorative Arts.\nIts current collection is based on pieces from the Iberian Peninsula, from Prehistory to Early-Modern Age. However, it also has different collections coming from outside of Spain, especially from Ancient Greece, both from the metropolitan and, above all, from Magna Graecia, and, to a lesser extent, from Ancient Egypt, in addition to \"a small number of pieces\" from Near East.\nPermanent exhibition\nForecourt\nFile:Reproduction of the Altamira Cave.jpg|Replica of Altamira Cave paintings\nIn the forecourt is a replica of the Cave of Altamira from the 1960s. Photogrammetry was used to reproduce the famous paintings on a mould of the original cave. The replica cave is related to an exhibit at the Deutsches Museum in Munich.\nMain building\nVisitors enter the building at basement level, and pass to the prehistory section.\nProtohistory\nThe halls devoted to the Protohistory of the Iberian Peninsula (1st floor) exhibit pieces from a number of Pre-Roman peoples existing roughly along the 1st millennia BC, as well as from the Punic-Phoenician colonisation. The former includes items from the Talaiotic culture, Iberian, Celtic, and Tartessian artifacts. The collection of Iberian sculpture from southern and southeastern Iberia is particularly notable, including  stone sculptures such as the iconic Lady of Elche, the Lady of Baza, the Lady of Galera, the Dama del Cerro de los Santos, the Bicha of Balazote, the Bull of Osuna, the Sphinx of Agost, one of the two  or the Mausoleum of Pozo Moro.\nFile:Proyecto REMAN3D 18529 (44188146514).jpg|Bicha of Balazote\nFile:Lady of Elche.jpg|Lady of Elche\nFile:Museo Arqueológico Nacional - 1969-68-155-123A - Dama de Baza 01.jpg|Lady of Baza\nFile:Gran Dama Oferente (M.A.N.

The collection of Roman artifacts is completed by items from the personal collection of the Marquis of Salamanca (purchased in 1874 and comprising artifacts from the Paestum and Cales sites in the Italian Peninsula). The main room of the area is a courtyard, where the artifacts are placed creating a sort of forum-like arrangement. Meanwhile, the room #27 exhibits a number of mosaics both on its floor and walls. The collection of Hispano-Roman legal bronzes includes the Lex Ursonensis, comprising five pieces found in the 1870s in Osuna.\nFile:Invierno M.A.N. 01.JPG|Mosaic of Winter, from Quintana del Marco\nFile:Lex Ursonensis - tabla 1 (M.A.N. 16736) 01.jpg|One the slabs part of the Lex Ursonensis\nFile:Museo Arqueológico Nacional - 33185 - Reloj solar de Baelo Claudia.jpg|\nFile:Museo Arqueológico Madrid (17227637735).jpg|Bacchus of Aldaia\nFile:Mosaic of Medusa and the seasons, 4th cent., National Archeological Museum, Madrid (5) (29327256296).jpg|Mosaic of Medusa and the seasons from Palencia\nFile:Statue of Hypnos, god of sleep, 2nd century AD, from Illici (Elche, Spain), National Archaeological Museum of Spain, Madrid (15540840737).jpg|Hypnos from Algorós\nFile:Museo Arqueológico Nacional - 2691 - Puteal de la Moncloa 03.jpg|\nLate Antiquity\nThe halls corresponding to the Late Antiquity (1st floor) host pieces related to the period of time corresponding to the Lower Roman Empire in the Iberian Peninsula—the Diocesis Hispaniarum (3rd–5th centuries AD)—, the Visigothic Kingdom of Toledo (6th-8th centuries AD), the Byzantine Empire (5th to 12th centuries AD), as well as some artifacts of other peoples from the Migration Period.\nStandout artifacts from this area include the , the Visigothic hoard of Guarrazar, including the votive crown of Recceswinth, or the .\nFile:Museo Arqueológico Nacional - 50310 - Sarcófago de Astorga.jpg|Paleochristian\nFile:Corona de (29049230050).jpg|Votive crown of Recceswinth\nFile:Alovera M.A.N..JPG|\nMedieval World, al-Andalus\nThe area dedicated to al-Andalus is located in the 1st floor.
