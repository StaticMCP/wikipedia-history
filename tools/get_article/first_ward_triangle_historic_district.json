The home was designed by one of Milwaukee's first architectural firms, German-trained Mygatt and Schmidtner, the house was inspired by German villas of the early 1800s.  The home was later converted for non-residential use, and was at one time the headquarters of the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation.\nMaster builder Stephen A.
