For m candidates, there are m! possible strict rankings (permutations).\nThere are three variations of the model that use different subsets of the full set of possible rankings, so that different election permutations are drawn with different probabilities:\nImpartial culture\nThis model assumes that each voter's ranking is randomly selected from a uniform distribution.  If these are chosen by n voters, there are thus m!^n possible elections (\"preference profiles\".)\nImpartial anonymous culture\nThis reduces the set of possible elections by eliminating those that are equivalent if the voter identities are unknown.  For example, the two-candidate, three-voter election {A>B, A>B, B>A} is equivalent to the election where the second and third voters swap votes: {A>B, B>A, A>B}, and so all variations on this set of votes are only included once.  The set of all such elections is called the anonymous equivalence class (AEC), and if the strict rankings are being chosen by n voters, there are  \\left ( \\frac {n+m!-1} {m!-1} \\right ) possible elections.\nThis is also referred to as the \"Dirichlet\" or \"simplex\" model.\nImpartial, anonymous, and neutral culture\nThis reduces the set of possible elections further, by eliminating those that are equivalent if the candidate identities are unknown.  For example, the two-candidate, three-voter election {A>B, A>B, B>A} is equivalent to the election where the two candidates are swapped: {B>A, B>A, A>B}.\nReferences"
