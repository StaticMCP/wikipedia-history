      "text": "# Young Republic League\n\nThe Young Republic League (, LJR) was a French political party created in 1912 by Marc Sangnier. It was a continuation of Le Sillon, Sangnier's Christian social movement which Pope Pius X (1835–1914) had intervened to close in 1910. The LJR supported personalist socialism on the model of Emmanuel Mounier's theory of personalism.\nThe Abbé Pierre was a member of the party for a short time after leaving the MRP. Members of the LJR later joined the Union of the Socialist Left, the first movement that included both Marxists and Social Christians.\nSee also\n*Marc Sangnier\n*Emmanuel Mounier's \"Personalism\"\nReferences"
