The wrong woman is artificially inseminated. And the sterile man learns his wife is pregnant.\nProduction\nIn 1962 it was announced that Elliot Kastner and Stan Shpetner would produce the play.\nIn 1964 it was announced the play would be the first of three produced by Garrick Productions in a recently formed alliance of play and film production with United Artists.\nThe Broadway production starred Robert Cummings and Lois Nettleton. The tour started in October 1965 and went for several months before reaching Broadway where it only ran for five performances.  It was Cummings' first Broadway appearance since Faithfully Yours in 1951. The play lost an estimated $125,000. United Artists had paid $60,000 for film rights, but the play did not run on Broadway the required three weeks that permit a producer and his backers to share in film money.\nCritical\nA review in The New York Times said Cummings \"is not in top form. He sounded a bit hoarse and somewhat strained. Usually he is a quite , breezy farceur.\"\nJohn Garver wrote \"Every season seems to have at least one show that could and should just stay on tour and not come to Broadway. This... was a prime example.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://playbill.com/production/the-wayward-stork-46th-street-theatre-vault-0000003105 The Wayward Stork] at Playbill"
