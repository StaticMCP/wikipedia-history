A few of us unknowingly got exposed to somebody with COVID-19 in London and ended up in quarantine in L.A. at my studio for two weeks. With only two songs left to finish, one of them happened to be 'Better Days'. We write about real experiences and events that happen to us - this is what happens when you write a song during a crisis.\"\nMusic video\nA music video to accompany the release of \"Better Days\" was first released onto YouTube on April 13, 2020. It depicts life during the pandemic, such as people staying at home and wearing face masks.\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\n* Brent Kutzle – producer, composer, lyricist\n* John Nathaniel – producer, composer, lyricist, mixer, studio personnel\n* Ryan Tedder – producer, composer, lyricist\n* Tyler Spry – producer, co-producer\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Italy (FIMI)\n| 38\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ)\n| 29\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| San Marino (SMRRTV Top 50)\n| 25\n|-\n|-\n|}\nCertifications\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Region\n! scope=\"col\"| Date\n! scope=\"col\"| Format\n! scope=\"col\"| Version\n! scope=\"col\"| Label\n! scope=\"col\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\"| Various\n| March 25, 2020\n| rowspan=\"4\"|\n| Original\n| rowspan=\"4\"| Interscope\n|\n|-\n| May 14, 2020\n| Live Quarantine Recording\n|\n|-\n| May 22, 2020\n| Mejores Días\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| May 29, 2020\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Giorni Migliori\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Italy\n| Contemporary hit radio\n| Universal\n|\n|}\nReferences"
