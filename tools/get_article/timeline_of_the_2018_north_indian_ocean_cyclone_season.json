The season featured 14 depressions, 10 deep depressions, 7 cyclonic storms, 5 severe cyclonic storms, 4 very severe cyclonic storms, and 1 extremely severe cyclonic storm. The season has no official boundaries, though storms typically form between April and December, with peaks in tropical cyclone activity from May–June and in November.\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) is the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre for the Northern Indian Ocean basin, and as such, it is responsible for tracking and issuing advisories on systems in the Arabian Sea and in the Bay of Bengal. If tropical cyclones in the Northern Indian Ocean reach winds of , it is given a name from a pre-defined naming list. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) unofficially issues advisories on systems in the Northern Indian Ocean, assigning tropical cyclones a numerical identifier and suffixing it with the letter A for systems in the Arabian Sra and B for systems in the Bay of Bengal. The IMD measures tropical cyclone wind speeds over a 3-minute average while the JTWC uses a 1-minute average.\nTimeline\nMarch\nMarch 13\n*03:00 UTC at  the IMD upgrades a well-marked low-pressure area in the Arabian Sea to a depression, estimating maximum 3-minute sustained winds of 45&nbsp;km/h (30&nbsp;mph) and a minimum central pressure of 1006&nbsp;hPa (mbar;
