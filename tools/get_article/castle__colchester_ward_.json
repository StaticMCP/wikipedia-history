It was first used in the 1973 election. It returns three councillors to Colchester City Council. The ward covers central Colchester, including the city centre, the historic Dutch Quarter neighbourhood and Colchester Castle, which lends its namesake to the ward. The ward was subject to boundary revisions in 1976, 1990, 2002 and 2016 of which only the 2002 revision made significant changes to the electorate.\nList of councillors\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
