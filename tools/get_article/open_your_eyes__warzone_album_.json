It was released in 1988 on Caroline Records, a year after their first album, ''Don't Forget The Struggle, Don't Forget The Streets.\nIt was co-produced by guitarist Dr. Know, of the Washington, D.C. hardcore band, Bad Brains. One of the tracks, \"Always – A Friend For Life\", was a re-recording of a song from their debut EP, Lower East Side Crew'' (1987),  as was \"We're The Crew\" from their previous album. In 1994, Another Planet re-issued the album on the same disc as ''Don't Forget The Struggle...''.\nLyrically, the band strived to distance themselves from the racist skinhead label, which had haunted them from inception. Other lyrics discussed oppression, togetherness, and the sense of belonging to a bigger, extended family. Musically, the album featured straightforward New York Hardcore with plenty of room for mosh indulgence. However, the first signs of musical experimentation emerged with occasional guitar flourishes.\nTrack listing\n*All songs written by Warzone\n#\"Open Up Your Eyes\"\t–\t4:29\n#\"Dance Hard or Die\"\t–\t1:17\n#\"Face Up to It\"\t–\t2:06\n#\"Always – A Friend for Life\"\t–\t2:41\n#\"Racism – World History Part I\"\t–\t2:44\n#\"Back to School Again\"\t–\t3:01\n#\"The American Movement\"\t–\t2:31\n#\"Fight the Oppressor\"\t–\t2:50\n#\"Deceive Us – No More\"\t–\t2:37\n#\"Striving Higher for a Better Life\"\t–\t2:23\nCredits\n* Raymond \"Raybeez\" Barbieri – vocals\n* Paul – guitar\n* Crazy \"Jay\" Skin – guitar\n* John \"Omen\" – bass\n* E.K. – drums\n* Produced by Dr. Know and Jerry Williams\n* Re-issue mastered by Alan Douches at West Westside Music\nNotes\nExternal links\n*[http://www.victoryrecords.com/AllBands.asp Victory Records bands page - Warzone are in Archives at page bottom]\n*[http://www.institutionalized.net/Music/raybeez.html Raybeez memorial]"
