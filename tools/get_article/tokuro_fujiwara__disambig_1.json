He is notorious for making his titles difficult for the average video game player and strict personality among peers. IGN listed Fujiwara at number 13 in its \"Top 100 Game Creators of All Time\" list.\nCareer\nCapcom\nFujiwara directed early Capcom titles such as the run-and-gun shooter Commando (1985), the platformers '' Ghosts 'n Goblins (1985) and Bionic Commando (1987), and the survival horror game Sweet Home (1989). He was also a main producer for the Mega Man series and worked on the CP System arcade game Strider (1989). He also conceived of Resident Evil as a remake of his earlier game Sweet Home and worked on the game as general producer.\nWhoopee Camp\nFujiwara left Capcom in 1996 to form his own studio, Whoopee Camp. He was joined at the new company by Harumi Fujita, who had composed music for his games at Capcom in the 1980s and 1990s. The studio was short lived, producing only Tomba and Tomba! 2: The Evil Swine Return before its closure in 2000.\nLater work\nFujiwara worked as a consultant on Extermination'' (2001). The game was being developed in the same building as Whoopee Camp's office at the time. Fujiwara has occasionally used the Whoopee Camp name since for his projects including ''Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection (2021), and Tomba: Special Edition (2024).\nWorks\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
