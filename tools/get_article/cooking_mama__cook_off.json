It is a spin off of the Nintendo DS game Cooking Mama. The game was released in Japan on February 8, 2007 and in North America on March 20, 2007. In Europe (other than in Germany), it was released on May 11, 2007, with an Australian release closely following on May 18, 2007. The Wii sequel to this game, Cooking Mama: World Kitchen was released in the US in November 2008.\nGameplay\nCook Off is a cooking simulation, where dishes are prepared by completing a series of short minigames.  Each minigame represents a step in the meal preparation process, with a complete dish requiring anywhere from two to more than a dozen such steps. Players use the Wii Remote to mimic real-life cooking movements such as rolling, slicing, chopping, and stirring. For example, during a minigame involving grinding up raw beef, the player might be instructed to move the Wii Remote in a circular motion as if grasping the handle of a meat grinder. Both the Wii Remote's motion sensing and positional/pointing capabilities may be utilized, depending on the minigame.\n|EGM = 7.5/10\n|EuroG = 5/10\n|Fam = 29/40\n|GI = 6.75/10\n|GSpot = 5.5/10\n|GSpy =\n|IGN = (US) 5.8/10(AU) 5/10\n|NP = 7.5/10\n}}\nThe game received \"mixed\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.\nPrior to the title's release, early press generated a certain level of excitement, with Wired proclaiming Cooking Mama: Cook Off the \"Best Game of CES 2007\". However, after playing the finished product, several reviews noted that the game was not nearly as responsive or intuitive as its predecessor. According to reviewers, a simple action with the Wii Remote can be difficult to perform successfully, leading to a frustrating experience. While the game was reported to still be fun, the lack of tactile feedback and several nagging control issues detract from the overall enjoyment.\nIn Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one six, two eights, and one seven, for a total of 29 out of 40. Elsewhere, in the May 2007 issue, Electronic Gaming Monthlys three editors gave the game marks of 7/10, 7.5/10 and 8/10, earning it an overall score of 7.5 out of 10. In 2009, Games Magazine gave it a favorable review, concluding that the game \"should appeal to anyone\".\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.ofcr.co.jp/html/products/wii_mama.html Official Japanese website]"
