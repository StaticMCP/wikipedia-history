Her career began after winning the television talent show Search for a Star in 2004. She signed with Viva Records and worked with producer Eugene Villaluz on her self-titled debut studio album released that same year. Go was named Most Promising Female Recording Artist at the Box Office Entertainment Awards, and earned an Awit Award nomination for Best Performance by a New Female Recording Artist for the cover single \"Don't Cry Out Loud\". The music video for the single \"Love of My Life\" received the MTV Pilipinas Music Award for Favorite Female Video. At the 2006 Myx Music Awards, she won Favorite Female Artist and Best Mellow Video for the single \"From The Start\". She released her second studio album I Care (2006), supported by the single \"If You Walk Away\", which was nominated for Best Performance by a Female Recording Artist at the Awit Awards.\nObsession (2007), Go's third studio album, yielded the single \"Alam Ng Ating Mga Puso\", for which she  won the Myx Music Award for Favorite Mellow Video. She also recorded a cover of \"Paano\" for Gary Valenciano's compilation album, earning the Awit Award for Best R&B Recording. She released Falling in Love (2009), which contained remakes of music from the 1970s and 1980s. For the production, she won the Star Award for Revival Album of the Year, and garnered nominations for Female Recording Artist of the Year and Female Pop Artist of the Year at the 2009 ceremony. Another single from the album, \"This Time I'll Be Sweeter\", earned her a Best Mellow Video nomination at the 2010 Myx Music Awards. The same year, she made a guest appearance in the musical television series Diva, and joined the ensemble of performers in the variety show Party Pilipinas. She then became a mentor in the reality talent show Protégé: The Battle for the Big Break (2011).\nIn 2011, Go made her theatre debut in the local production of The Little Mermaid, starring as the titular character. She won the BroadwayWorld Philippines Award for Best Actress in a Musical for the role. Three years later, she had her international breakthrough playing a hardened bargirl in the 2014 West End revival of Miss Saigon. For the show, she received the BroadwayWorld UK Award for Best Featured Actress in a New Production of a Musical and the WhatsOnStage Award for Best Supporting Actress. She followed this by playing Fantine, a prostitute dying of tuberculosis, in Les Misérables in 2015, winning Best Female Performance in a Long-Running West End Show at the BroadwayWorld UK Awards. In 2017, she reprised her role in Miss Saigon, which marked her Broadway debut, before being cast in the original West End production of Hamilton, where she portrayed Eliza Schuyler. For her performance in the latter, Go won a BroadwayWorld UK Award for Best Actress in a New Production of a Musical. She has since reprised her roles in various productions and tours of Les Misérables (2019–2022) and Hamilton (2023–2024).\nFilmography\nTelevision\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n!
