      "text": "# Dalton tradition\n\nThe Dalton tradition is a Late Paleo-Indian and Early Archaic projectile point tradition. It is named after S. P. Dalton, a judge who first discovered these artifacts in Missouri. These points appeared in most of southeast North America from  to at least c. 8,400 BCE.\nAccording to archaeologist Brian Fagan, Dalton points possess \"concave bases with 'ears' that sometimes flare outward\" and were used as saws and knives as well as weapons. They often changed form and function because the hunters would sharpen the points over and over, repurposing them into knives, then chisels or scrapers.  A variant on the Dalton point is the Hardaway point of North Carolina.\nSee also\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.bragg.army.mil/culturalresources/prehistory.htm  Dalton Tradition in No Carolina]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070808055356/http://www.usgennet.org/usa/mo/county/stlouis/native/prehist.htm  Site showing Dalton points]\n\n---\n\n## Dalton Tradition\n\n#REDIRECT Dalton tradition\n}}"
