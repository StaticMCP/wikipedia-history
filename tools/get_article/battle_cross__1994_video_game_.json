A top-down perspective is used and elements of the video game Bomberman are added in. An automatic steering mode is also available.\nThe goal of the game is to take a group of small futuristic air bikes and to go around one of the various race tracks. Players race each other to see who makes it to the finish line first. Various hazards are also scattered around each track, from puddles to speed bumps, pinball bumpers and even cannonballs. There are 12 courses (including the hidden bonus course). A \"Challenge Mode\" is also available.\nReception\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.gamefaqs.com/snes/571186-battle-cross/data Battle Cross reviews] at GameFAQs\n*[http://superfamicom.org/info/battle-cross/ Battle Cross] at superfamicom.org\n*[http://www.super-famicom.jp/data/ha/ha_0065.html Japanese title] at super-famicom.jp"
