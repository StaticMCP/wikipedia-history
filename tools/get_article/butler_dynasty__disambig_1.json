They rose to their highest prominence as Dukes of Ormonde. The family has produced multiple titles such as Baron Cahir, Baron Dunboyne, Viscount Ikerrin, Viscount Galmoye, Viscount Mountgarret, Viscount Thurles, Earl of Carrick, Earl of Kilkenny, Earl of Ormond, Earl of Ossory, Marquess of Ormonde and Duke of Ormonde. Variant spellings of the name include le Boteler and le Botiller. The Butlers were descendants of Anglo-Norman lords who participated in the Norman invasion of Ireland in the 12th century. The surname has its origins in the hereditary office of \"Butler (cup-bearer) of Ireland\", originating with Theobald Walter, 1st Chief Butler of Ireland. The arms of later family members depicted three cups in recognition of their original office.\nOrigin\nThe family descended from Theobald Walter (d. 1205), eldest son of Hervey Walter and Maud de Valoignes. During the reign of Henry II of England Theobald held the position of pincerna (Latin) or boteillier (Norman French), the ceremonial cup-bearer or butler to Prince John, Lord of Ireland. He also held the office of Chief Butler of England and was the High Sheriff of Lancashire during 1194.\nHis younger brother Hubert Walter (c.1160–1205) became the Archbishop of Canterbury and Justiciar and Lord Chancellor of England.\nButlers of Ormond\n(1496–1546), by Hans Holbein.]]\nThe Ormond line is the senior branch of the family and later produced the Earls, Marquesses and Dukes of Ormond.\nEdmund Butler was created the first Earl of Carrick in 1315 in reward for his service during the Bruce campaign in Ireland. Although the earldom did not pass to his son James, the latter was created the first Earl of Ormond in 1328 by Edward III.\nSubsidiary titles for the earl in the Peerage of Ireland were later added: Earl of Ossory (1538) and Viscount Thurles (1536). James Butler, 12th Earl of Ormond served as the commander of the Cavalier forces in Ireland and was made Marquess of Ormond in 1642, which title became extinct in 1758. He was made Duke of Ormonde in 1661, and with the title created in the Peerage of England in 1682; after 1682, the spelling \"Ormonde\" was used almost universally. Subsidiary titles for the duke in the Peerage of England were added: Earl of Brecknock (1660) and Baron Butler (1660).\n; a Jacobite sympathiser, his titles became forfeit in 1715]]\nJames Fitzjames Butler succeeded his grandfather and became the second duke. Accused of treason during the Jacobite rising of 1715, he was attainted and his English peerages declared forfeit.  In 1758 his brother Charles, the de jure third duke (Irish), died and the dukedom and marquessate became extinct.\nThe eighteenth earl, James Wandesford Butler, was created as Baron Ormonde of Llanthony, in the county of Monmouth in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1821 on the coronation of George IV. Later, he was created the Marquess of Ormonde in the Peerage of Ireland in 1816. On his death in 1820, that title became extinct and the earldoms passed to his brother, for whom the title \"Marquess of Ormonde\" was re-created in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1825.  That title became extinct in 1997, while the earldom became dormant.\nLands\nThe family seat, since 1391, was Kilkenny Castle; their main estate was previously at Gowran Castle. From Kilkenny, the Butlers claimed overlordship of the surrounding Gaelic kingdoms of Ormond, Éile, Ikerrin and part of Osraige.\nThe patrimony of the Butlers of Ormond encompassed most of the modern counties of Tipperary, Kilkenny and parts of County Carlow. Only the earldom of Desmond would have had more extensive land holdings than Ormond in the Lordship and Kingdom of Ireland. Following the successful Norman Invasion, the ancient Gaelic lands would have been annexed to the crown and passed as baronies or fiefs to the supporters of the crown (the victorious barons). These (administrative) baronies corresponded to the (Irish) túath (\"country\") or trícha cét (\"thirty hundred [men]\") of a Gaelic chief, for example Éile. However, sometimes baronies combined small territories, or split a large one, or were created without regard for the earlier boundaries.  In the Norman period most Gaelic chiefs were killed, expelled, or subordinated by the new Norman lord; in the Tudor period, many Gaelic and Hibernicized lords retained their land by pledging allegiance to the Crown under the policy of surrender and regrant.\nIn 1837, the remains of the following Butler castles were recorded in County Kilkenny alone by Lewis.\nMembers of the Butler family continued to live in Kilkenny Castle until 1935.\nNotable family members\n, Ireland]]\n, side view]]\n* Theobald Walter, 1st Chief Butler of Ireland (died 1206) married Maud de Vavasour; they had three children\n* Theobald le Botiller, 2nd Chief Butler of Ireland (died 1230) married Joan de Marais\n* Theobald Butler, 3rd Chief Butler of Ireland (1224–1248) married Margery de Burgh; they had four children\n* Theobald Butler, 4th Chief Butler of Ireland (1242–1285) married Joan FitzJohn FitzGeoffrey; they had three children\n* Edmund Butler, Earl of Carrick (1270–1321) married Joan FitzGerald, Countess of Carrick; they had two children\n* James Butler, 1st Earl of Ormond (1305–1338) married Eleanor de Bohun; they had six children\n* James Butler, 2nd Earl of Ormond (1331–1382) married Elizabeth Darcy; they had five children\n* James Butler, 3rd Earl of Ormond (died 1405) married Anne Welles; they had five children\n* James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond (1392–1452) married Joan de Beauchamp; they had three children\n* James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond (1420–1461)\n* John Butler, 6th Earl of Ormond (died 1478)\n* Thomas Butler, 7th Earl of Ormond (1426–1515) married Anne Hankford\n* Piers Butler, 8th Earl of Ormond (1467-1539)\nButlers of Dunboyne\nThe Baron Dunboyne peerage originated with Thomas Butler, 1st Baron Dunboyne (1271–1329), the son of Theobald Butler, 4th Chief Butler of Ireland.\nNotable family members\n* Thomas Butler, 1st Baron Dunboyne (1271–1329)\n* John Butler, 12th Baron Dunboyne (1731 – 7 May 1800)\nButlers of Clonamicklon and Ikerrin\nThis branch sprang from John Butler of Clonamicklon (1305–1330), the youngest son of Edmund Butler, Earl of Carrick (1268–1321) and Joan FitzGerald, Countess of Carrick (1282–1320).

Both baronies are in the northwestern corner of County Kilkenny. The Viscounts are recorded as significant landowners there (where they occupied lands around Clomantagh Castle for many centuries), as well as holding lands in the neighbouring civil parish of Coolcashin.
