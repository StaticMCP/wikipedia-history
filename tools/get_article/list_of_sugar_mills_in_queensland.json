Requiring a hot climate and plenty of water, sugarcane is predominantly grown in Queensland with some in northern New South Wales. Sugar is the second largest agricultural export from Queensland. Over 4000 sugar cane farms produce 32–35 million tonnes of sugar cane each year, from which 4–4.5 million tonnes of raw sugar is extracted at sugarcane mills. At 2011, there were 24 sugar mills in Australia, ranging from Mossman in Queensland to Grafton in New South Wales. Mackay Region is known for its five locally owned mills. Altogether they produce enough sugar to support Central Queensland and Northern Queensland. They range from Racecourse Sugar Mill, Farleigh Mill, Marian Mill, Proserpine Mill and Sarina Sugar Shed. Queensland's first industrial-scale sugar plantation commenced in Moreton Bay in 1864.\nList of operating sugar mills in Queensland\nThis is a list of the sugar cane mills in Queensland, ordered from north to south.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Sugar mills in Queensland\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Photo\n! scope=\"col\" |Name\n! scope=\"col\" |Location\n! scope=\"col\" |Local government area\n! scope=\"col\" |Crush capacity[million tonnes cane per year]\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Notes\n! scope=\"col\" |Coordinates\n|-\n|\n|Mulgrave Sugar Mill\n|Gordonvale\n|Cairns Region\n|1.2\n|Mulgrave Sugar Mill commenced operations in 1896.

With improved transport options, many of these smaller mills closed and only the larger more economic mills remain. This list is likely to be incomplete as many mills were small and operated only for a short period leaving few records. They are ordered from north to south, although in some cases the location is not known very accurately.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Former sugar mills in Queensland\n|-\n!\n! scope=\"col\" |Name\n! scope=\"col\" |Location\n! scope=\"col\" |Local government area\n! scope=\"col\" |Crush capacity[million tonnes cane per year]\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Notes\n! scope=\"col\" |Coordinates\n(may be approximate)\n|-\n|\n|Mossman Central Mill\n|Mossman\n|Shire of Douglas\n|0.85\n|Operated by Far Northern Milling.
