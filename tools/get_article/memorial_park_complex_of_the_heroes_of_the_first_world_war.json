It is located in the Sokol District of the Northern Administrative Okrug. The area of the park is 11.2 hectares.\nHistory\nEarlier there was the Moscow City Bratsky (Fraternal) Cemetery on the place of the park. The cemetery was founded in 1915 by the Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna. Almost 18,000 victims of the World War I were buried in the cemetery. In 1918 the Church of the Transfiguration was built here by architect Alexey Shchusev.\nIn 1925 the Fraternal Cemetery was closed for burials. In 1932 it was turned into a park. All the tombstones, with the exception of one, were demolished. In the late 1940s the Church of the Transfiguration was demolished too.\nDuring perestroika many public figures spoke out for the revival of the memorial in the park, set on the site of the Moscow City Fraternal Cemetery. The Chapel of the Transfiguration was built there in 1998. In 2004 the park got the name \"Memorial park complex of the heroes of the First World War\" and some monuments were erected there.\nGallery\nfile:Moscow City Brotherly Cemetery 1915.jpg|The graves in 1915\nfile:Main alley of the Memorial park (Moscow).JPG|Main alley of the Memorial park in 2010\nfile:Transfiguration Chapel at Sokol.JPG|The Transfiguration Chapel\nfile:Leningrad Cinema 2 (Moscow).JPG|The \"Leningrad Cinema\"\nBibliography\n*"
