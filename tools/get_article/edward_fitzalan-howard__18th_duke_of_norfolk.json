As Duke of Norfolk, he is the most senior non-royal peer in the Peerage of England. He is also the titular head of the House of Howard.\nBackground and education\nNorfolk is the son of Miles Francis Stapleton Fitzalan-Howard, 17th Duke of Norfolk, and his wife Anne Mary Teresa Constable-Maxwell. He was educated at Ampleforth College, a Roman Catholic independent school, before going up to Lincoln College, Oxford.\nHe has a brother and three sisters. His only brother, Lord Gerald Fitzalan-Howard, runs the Carlton Towers estate with his wife, Emma Fitzalan-Howard. The Duke's eldest sister is the Countess of Balfour. His second sister, Lady Carina Fitzalan-Howard, is the widow of broadcaster David Frost. His third and youngest sister is the actress Marsha Fitzalan.\nCareer\nNorfolk worked with various companies, and from 2000 to 2002 was Deputy Earl Marshal. Upon the death of his father in 2002, he inherited the late Duke of Norfolk's peerages and the position of Earl Marshal. He was a Cub Scout while at school at Ampleforth College and currently holds two appointments in the Scout Movement.

He also had several motoring convictions where he incurred an excess of penalty points, resulting in a driving ban. His barrister argued in mitigation that he needed the ability to drive to organise the coronation of King Charles III.\nFamily\n, by Allan Warren (1981)]]\nA Roman Catholic, the Duke of Norfolk is recognised by the Vatican as England's senior representative of the faith.
