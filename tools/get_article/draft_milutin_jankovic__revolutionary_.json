He died on 3 July (Julian Calendar) or 15 July (Gregorian Calendar) 1907 near Pasjane.\nIn the spring of 1907, the Bulgarian Exarchists launched a major offensive against the Serbian Chetnik Organization on the right bank of the Vardar. More than 100 well-armed Bulgarians headed towards Poreč and Azot to destroy the Serbian companies, burn down Serbian villages, and neutralize the Chetnik campaign. The Serbian companies were weakened and thinned by constant fighting at that time. Consequently, in March 1907, due to the strong Turkish forces in the Kumanovo region, Vojvoda Rade Radivojević's company was sent to help via Kosovo. All the Chetniks were dressed as Arnauts with the plan to sneak into Poreč as their local kachaks unnoticed, but that failed. The company was discovered near the village of Pasjane in the Gnjilane region on July 14, 1907 (lasting three days) in the local  Ranilug Serbian Orthodox church. A fight broke out that attracted the Turkish army and their  Arnaut vassals. The entire company was destroyed. Only Chetnik Sava Tomkic escaped the cordon and survived to tell the tragic story. That took the lives of 34 Chetniks and 25 local Serbian villagers. Some 70 Turkish soldiers and Arnaut auxiliaries were killed in the three-day-long battle from 14 to 16 July 1907.\nReferences\n* Translated from \"Bitka na Pasjane\" in Serbian Wikipedia: https://sr.wikipedia.org/sr-el/%D0%91%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B0_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B4_%D0%9F%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%98%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B5"
