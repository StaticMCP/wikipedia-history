In 1997, ten fossilized dinosaur eggs, believed to have come from a Hadrosaur, specifically a Hypacrosaurus were found at Devil's Coulee site. These were not the first fossils to be found in what was often called the Fossil Coulee region of the province and as a result the town of Warner established the museum to help interpret the story.\nAffiliations\nThe Museum is affiliated with: CMA, CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
