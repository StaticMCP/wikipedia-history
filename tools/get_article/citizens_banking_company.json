Main St. in Baxley in Appling County, Georgia, was built in 1911.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.\nIts first floor includes a section which was originally a bank, with an oblique corner entrance, and also separate commercial space.  The original bank was closed and sold at auction in 1917;  two other banks subsequently used the bank space.\nIt was deemed \"significant in architecture as a fine example of a building built to be a bank and commercial structure during the early 20th-century\nNeoclassical era\" including that it \"exemplifies the strong, secured look that bankers sought in their turn-of-the-century buildings, obviously to stress the strength\nof their institution\" and that it \"is also a good and relatively early use of poured reinforced concrete construction in a small Georgia town.\"  It was deemed \"significant in commerce as a good example of the development of a small-town pre-Depression banking and commercial institution in the early 20th century.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\nExternal links\n*"
