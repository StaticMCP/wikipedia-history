And during the last days of the war the Sulu attack multiple coastal villages. And one of these was Kampung Sembulan which the Bruneian army were heading to foil their attacks.\nBattle\nThe Bruneians numbered maybe more than 2,000 soldiers and the Sulu probably being outnumbered in this battle, probably thinking it would be easy to raid the village. The two forces then presumably skirmished and fought in close-quarters combat as many of their forces still used spears and swords as the village was fairly small and was one of many Bruneian water villages. The Sulu eventually retreated by suffering heavy casualties. Though this is mostly guessing.\nAftermath\nAfter defeating the Sulu, a Hulubalang who fought in the battle, Sharif Ali or Embo Ali became the official \"caretaker\" of Kampung Sembulan.\nNotes\nReferences"
