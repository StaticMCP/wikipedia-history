It is found only on Santiago in the Galápagos Islands.  Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry shrubland.\nIt was considered extinct since it was last recorded in 1906, but it was rediscovered in 1997. A smaller, related rice rat was also rediscovered—the Fernandina rice rat (Nesoryzomys fernandinae) on Fernandina.\nReferences\nLiterature cited\n*Musser, G.G. and Carleton, M.D. 2005.
