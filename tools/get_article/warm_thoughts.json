      "text": "# Warm Thoughts\n\nWarm Thoughts is an album by the American musician Smokey Robinson, released in 1980. It features the top 40 hit, \"Let Me Be the Clock\". The album was arranged by Reginald \"Sonny\" Burke. This album also featured the  semi-autobiographical tune \"Wine, Women and Song\", which proved to be the closest thing to a Miracles reunion that occurred in the 1980s, with Smokey doing a duet with his then-wife, former Miracle Claudette Robinson, and Miracle Marv Tarplin, with whom he shared songwriting credits, on guitar. The song \"Travelin' Thru'\" was written by Smokey's real-life sister, Rose Ella Jones, and two songs written by Robinson with fellow Motown artist, Stevie Wonder, and singer, songwriter, and former Starsky and Hutch star, David Soul. This album was a success, reaching the Top 20 of The Billboard 200 Pop Album chart, peaking at No. 14, and the Top 10 of Billboard's R&B Album Chart, peaking at No. 4.\nCritical reception\n| rev2      = Billboard\n| rev2Score = (unrated)\n| rev3      = Rolling Stone\n| rev3Score = (favorable)\n}}\nThe Boston Globe wrote that \"Robinson's silky smooth tenor glides over a collection of eight cuts, most lush, heavily orchestrated ballads.\"\nTrack listing\nAll tracks composed by Smokey Robinson, except where indicated.\n#\"Let Me Be the Clock\" - 5:10\n#\"Heavy on Pride\" - 4:07\n#\"Into Each Rain Some Life Must Fall\" (Doris Fisher, Allan Roberts) - 4:34\n#\"Wine, Women and Song\" (Robinson, Marv Tarplin, Pamela Moffett) - 4:45\n#\"Melody Man\" (Robinson, Stevie Wonder) - 4:53\n#\"What's in Your Life for Me\" (Robinson, Donny Soul) - 4:43\n#\"I Want to Be Your Love\" - 3:57\n#\"Travelin' Thru'\" (Rose Ella Jones) - 4:22\nPersonnel\n* Smokey Robinson – lead and backing vocals\n* Reginald \"Sonny\" Burke – keyboards, arrangements (1-4, 6, 7, 8)\n* Ron Rancifer – keyboards\n* Marlo Henderson – guitars\n* Melvin Ragin – guitars\n* Marv Tarplin – guitars\n* Phil Upchurch – guitars\n* David T.
