Hornet saw most of her active duty during the French Revolutionary Wars. During the Napoleonic Wars she served for about six years as a hospital ship before being laid up in 1811 and sold in 1817.\nCareer\nHornet was commissioned in March 1794 under Commander Christmas Paul.

Next, on 17 May, Hornet captured the French transport Emilie. Then in November 1796, Commander John Nash replaced Larkan.\nOn 10 March 1798 the Admiralty published a list of six vessels that , under Captain Henry Lidgbird Ball, and Hornet had captured off Gorée:\n*American snow Rebecca, which had sailed from Charlestown. Her cargo included pitch, tar, dry goods, tobacco, molasses and gunpowder. The British took the naval and gunpowder, which they landed, and then released the vessel.\n*American ship President, carrying a cargo of salt belonging to English merchants. The French had taken the ship off the Islands de Loss and the British had recaptured her off the mouth of the River Gambia. The British returned the vessel and her cargo to the owner after receiving salvage money.\n*Ship , late of Liverpool, which the British recaptured. She was of 260 tons, 10 guns and a crew of 36.

In August Hornet was part of the British fleet that captured the Dutch fleet in the Vlieter Incident. Payment for the captures on 30 August came later, in December 1802.}}\nNash then sailed Hornet to the West Indies. In 1800 she accompanied a convoy to the West Indies.\nWhile at Guadeloupe in October, a boat from Hornet attempted to press some men off the New Ceres, whose crew resisted, killing Hornets second lieutenant, and wounding another crewman. The next day Hornet tried again, this time in force, but all the crew except the chief mate and steward had disappeared. Captain Nash turned the two men over to the civil authorities.\nOn 27 November 1800, Hornet captured the French privateer Femme Divorcee. On 16 October Hornet captured the French privateer Mahomet.}}\nOn 15 January 1801, the 20-gun , Captain Richard Matson, 18-gun ship-sloops  and Hornet, captains Henry Matson and John Nash, and the  (a schooner serving as a tender), were at an anchor in the harbour of the Îles des Saintes. The British observed a convoy of French coasters, with an armed schooner as escort, sailing towards Vieux-Fort, Guadeloupe. At midnight Garland, together with two boats from each of the other three vessels, attempted to cut out the convoy. However, all of the convoy, but one, were able to shelter under the guns of Basse-Terre. The British were able to take the one French vessel that had anchored near Vieux-Fort.\nOn 17 January, boats from Hornet, together with boats from Daphne, set out to cut out a ship moored under the protection of shore batteries at Trois-Rivières, Guadeloupe. This was Eclair, a schooner that had recently sailed from Rochefort. Eclair was of 145 tons, had a crew of 45 men, and was armed with four 4-pounder guns and twenty 1½-pounder brass swivel guns, though she was pierced for 12 guns. A party from Garland succeeded in taking Eclair the next day. Fire from the schooner killed two men and wounded another. The French lost one seaman killed, two drowned, and her captain, first and second lieutenants, and six men wounded. The British took her into service as the 10-gun .\nIn March, Hornet participated in Rear Admiral Duckworth's successful attack on the islands of St. Bartholomew and St. Martin. On 23 March, Hornet and the 16-gun hired armed brig Fanny, later joined by 14-gun , attempted to capture two privateers, a brig and a schooner, but were unsuccessful though they chased the privateers for some 24 hours. The 32-gun frigate , Hornet, and Drake stayed at St. Martin to secure the island and to embark the garrison on 26 March, while the rest of Duckworth's force went on to St Thomas.

On 3 September Hornet captured a Dutch ship, whose name was not recorded, that was carrying 410 slaves., of 281 tons (bm), that had been launched at Batavia in 1796. The capture took place off the Suriname River. The capture resulted in a court case over the prize money.}}\nThen in September Hood went on to take the colonies of Demerara and Essequibo from the Batavian Republic. On 20 September Hornet, the schooner , and 200 troops entered the Demerara River and took possession of Fort William Frederick. At the capitulation, the British took over the Batavian Republic's sole warship there, . Hunt and Hornet carried back to England Hood's dispatches announcing the capture of Demerara. On Hunts arrival he was promoted to post captain.\nIn 1804 Commander John Lawrence took command of Hornet.\nHospital ship\nPaid off in 1804 from active service, Hornet was fitted at Plymouth between September 1804 and July 1805 for the Medical Military Staff, and was commissioned in June 1805 under Lieutenant Charles Williams as a hospital ship in the Isles of Scilly. Charles's brother, Henry Williams, fell overboard in 1810 and was drowned.
