It features stand-up comedy and sketches united by a theme for each episode. It was script-edited by Chris Morris and was initially executive-produced by Armando Iannucci, marking a rare reformation of a creative team formed for On the Hour in 1991. Lee had said that this is exactly the sort of show he wanted to do, saying \"I don't want to do any television that I don't have complete control of.\"\nThe first series aired in 2009, with subsequent series in 2011, 2014 and 2016. Stewart Lee announced in May 2016 that the BBC had declined to make any further series. This was due primarily to cuts to BBC Two's comedy budget, which would focus instead solely on scripted comedy.\nFormat\nThe bulk of the show is a Stewart Lee stand-up comedy performance, recorded live at the Mildmay Club in Stoke Newington with a club audience. Usually two episodes of the show were recorded per evening.  Each episode has a theme, which Lee performs with his material. The stand-up is punctuated with sketches, written by Lee but usually performed by Kevin Eldon and Paul Putner with cameos from other TV and circuit comedians. From series 2, the sketches were removed in favour of a short film at the end of each episode. An element of the programme is the \"hostile interrogator\", played by Armando Iannucci in the second series and by Chris Morris in Series 3 and 4. In a darkened room, the interrogator quizzes Lee about his approach to stand-up comedy and his attitudes toward his audience and the comedy industry. In Series 1, the interrogator segments (with Iannucci and Johnny Vegas as interrogators) were not included in the main programme, accessed instead via the BBC Red Button and included on the DVD releases as bonus features. The interrogator segments were integrated into the main body of the show by Series 2. The opening theme tune to Series 1 is \"Tom Hark\" by Elias & His Zig-Zag Jive Flutes. From series 2 there is a cold open and no theme tune or title card.\nDVD releases\n*Series 1 was released on 7 September 2009 as a 2-disc region-2 PAL set.  Red-button extras are included.\n*Series 2 was released on 20 June 2011 as a single-disc region-2 PAL issue.  Red-button extras are absent.\n*Series 3 was released on 10 November 2014 as a 2-disc region-2 PAL set.

The Guardian Guide said \"Lee's Vehicle feels well overdue, with his brand of bone-dry, spot-on scepticism a refreshing change from the perky, ambitious tones of the Mock the Week brigade [...] it's brilliant.\" Brian Viner of The Independent said \"In my front room, Lee was preaching not so much to the converted, as to an ayatollah. He did so brilliantly, though.\"\nThe Guardian named Comedy Vehicle as one of its top ten television highlights of 2009, commenting that it \"was the kind of TV that makes you feel like you're not the only one wondering how we came to be surrounded by so much unquestioned mediocrity\". One of the show's few negative reviews came in the Sunday Mercury, which stated: \"His whole tone is one of complete, smug condescension\". Lee subsequently used this line to advertise his next stand-up tour.\nWriting about the third series in The Metro, Keith Watson said \"It’s comedy that makes you stop and think, and there’s not enough of it about\", awarding the show four out of five stars. Ellen Jones writing in The Independent said \"this comedy about comedy would be unforgivably self-indulgent if Lee wasn’t just as incisive on every other facet of modern life as he is on his own comedic genius\".\nAwards\nIn May 2010, the series was nominated for a BAFTA Television Award for Best Comedy Programme, which was won by The Armstrong & Miller Show. In May 2012, the second series of Comedy Vehicle was nominated for the same award, and won.\nAt the 2011 British Comedy Awards, the series won the award for Best Comedy Entertainment Programme, and Lee won Best Male Television Comic.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n* [https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/mar/14/comedian-stewart-lee The barnacle of British comedy] - The Guardian, 14 March 2009.
