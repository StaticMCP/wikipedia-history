The Maine primary, the last in the state until the 2020, was a closed primary, meaning that only registered Democrats could vote in this primary. The state awarded 33 delegates towards the 2000 Democratic National Convention, 23 of which were pledged delegates allocated based on the results of the primary.\nVice president Al Gore won the primary with 54% of the vote while Senator Bradley finished second with a result of 41%. Gore gained three more delegates than Bradley statewide, resulting in his win of 13 delegates over Bradley's 10 delegates. Lyndon LaRouche Jr. finished 4th with 0.32% of the vote.\nProcedure\nMaine was one of 15 states and one territory holding primaries on March 7, 2000, also known as \"Super Tuesday\".\nVoting was expected to take place throughout the state from 6:00&nbsp;a.m. until 8:00&nbsp;p.m. In the closed primary, candidates had to meet a threshold of 15 percent at the congressional district or statewide level in order to be considered viable. The 23 pledged delegates to the 2000 Democratic National Convention were allocated proportionally on the basis of the results of the primary. Of these, 7 and 8 were allocated to each of the state's 2 congressional districts and another 3 were allocated to party leaders and elected officials (PLEO delegates), in addition to 5 at-large delegates.\nThe state convention would subsequently be held to vote on all pledged delegates for the Democratic National Convention. The delegation also included 8 unpledged PLEO delegates: 5 members of the Democratic National Committee, 2 members of Congress, of which both were representatives, Tom Allen and John Baldacci, 2 distinguished party leaders, and 1 add-on.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;float:none;padding:5px;\"\n! colspan=\"2\"| Pledged nationalconvention delegates\n|-\n!
