It was released by Syco Music and Sony BMG on 17 April 2006 in the United Kingdom. The release of the album came five months after he won the second series of the British talent show The X Factor, with the recording process taking place between late 2005 and early 2006. Ward worked with a variety of producers on his debut, including Cutfather, Jörgen Elofsson, David Kreuger, Steve Mac, Quiz & Larossi, and Nigel Wright.\nPromotion\nThe album produced five singles, including \"That's My Goal\", \"No Promises\" and \"Stand by Me.\" Initially released on 17 April 2006, Shayne Ward was later re-released on 18 December 2006, with the addition of a bonus DVD. The album was not issued in Japan until 2007, and the lead single in the region consisted of a double A-side of \"That's My Goal\" and \"No Promises.\" A new video for \"That's My Goal\" was filmed for the release. In November 2022, the album was released on vinyl record for the first time.\nCritical reception\n| rev2 = RTÉ.ie\n| rev2score =\n}}\nLinda McGee, writing for RTÉ.ie, found that Shayne Ward \"is pretty much your typical pop record. It's polished, filled with soft, gushy ballads and is therefore very easy to listen to – think Backstreet Boys-meets-Westlife [...] All in all, this isn't half bad for a debut.\" Similarly, Sharon Mawer from AllMusic wrote: \"Having four months to record and polish an album was still no guarantee of quality, however, and Ward delivered an album of ballads in the style of every boy band since the mid-'90s, with songs interchangeable from those on albums by Take That, Boyzone, Westlife, and Blue.\"\nCommercial performance\nShayne Ward debuted at number one on both the Irish Albums Chart and the UK Albums Chart. It was certified Silver, Gold and Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 21 April 2006. The same year, the album reached 4× Platinum in Ireland for shipments figures in excess of 60,000 copies. By November 2015, Shayne Ward had sold 538,918 copies in the United Kingdom.\n| title14         = Easy to Love You\n| writer14        =\n| extra14         = Stack\n| length14        = 3:14\n| title15         = Hit the Ground Running\n| writer15        =\n| extra15         = Stack\n| length15        = 3:41\n| title16         = That's My Goal\n| note16          = Music video\n| length16        = 3:41\n| title17         = No Promises\n| note17          = Music video\n| length17        = 3:44\n}}\n| title14          = If You're Not the One\n| note14           = Live on The X Factor\n| writer14         =\n| extra14          = Tom Foster\n| length14         = 2:16\n| title15          = Right Here Waiting\n| note15           = Live on The X Factor\n| writer15         =\n| extra15          = Foster\n| length15         = 1:32\n| title16          = Unchained Melody\n| note16           = Live on The X Factor\n| writer16         =\n| extra16          = Foster\n| length16         = 2:08\n| title17         = A Million Love Songs\n| note17          = Live on The X Factor\n| writer17        = Gary Barlow\n| extra17         = Foster\n| length17        = 5:05\n| title18         = Easy to Love You\n| writer18        =\n| extra18         = Stack\n| length18        = 3:14\n| title19         = Hit the Ground Running\n| writer19        =\n| extra19         = Stack\n| length19        = 3:41\n}}\n| title1          = That's My Goal\n| note1           = Music video\n| length1         = 3:41\n| title2          = No Promises\n| note2           = Music video\n| length2         = 3:44\n| title3          = Stand by Me\n| note3           = Music video\n| length3         = 4:15\n| title4          = That's My Goal\n| note4           = International music video\n| length4         = 3:41\n| title5          = Stand by Me\n| note5           = Making of the video\n| length5         = 2:00\n}}\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Weekly chart performance for Shayne Ward\n|-\n!
