Only 41 civilian vehicles survived the raids, and more than 3,000 bomb craters were counted.\nHistory\nAfter a lone Soviet air raid conducted on 4 September 1942, Vienna was reached by western Allied bombers in 1944, when the Allied invasion of Italy allowed them to establish an air base at Foggia. After the Normandy invasion, the greater part of the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) was transferred to the West. The rmaining Luftwaffe shot down one tenth of 550 bombers in June 1944.\nThe air defences of Vienna were aided by a ring of anti-aircraft batteries set up around the city and three pairs of Flak towers.  These were large anti-aircraft gun blockhouses built in the city. The increasing lack of fuel by autumn 1944 caused artillery on the ground to be the only defence against air raids. It typically took some 5,000 small-calibre and 3,400 large-calibre shells to bring down one bomber. During the day, one out of 125 planes was shot down on average. During the night, that dropped to only one out of 145. However, roughly one third of the bombers and escorts suffered heavy damage. Some Vienna factories were moved to bomb-proof sites such as caves (e.g. the Seegrotte near Hinterbrühl) or hidden in other ways. The military industry boosted its production, also by use of forced labour of concentration camp inmates and POWs. Bypasses for traffic junctions had been established before the bombings, and traffic did not come to a halt until the very last days of the war.\nBy early 1945 Vienna had already faced 1,800 bombs. In February and March 1945, 80,000 tons of bombs were dropped by American and British aircraft, which destroyed more than 12,000 buildings and left 270,000 people homeless.\nList of raids\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+valign=top style=\"background:silver\" | Chronology1944:\n[http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/jan44.html January] ,\n[http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/feb44.html February]\n[http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/mar44.html March] ,\n[http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/apr44.html April] ,\n[http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/may44.html May] ,\n[http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/jun44.html June] ,\n[http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/jul44.html July] ,\n[http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/aug44.html August] ,\n[http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/sep44.html September] ,\n[http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/oct44.html October] ,\n[http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/nov44.html November] ,\n[http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/dec44.html December] 1945\n[http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/jan45.html January] ,\n[http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/feb45.html February] ,\n[http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/mar45.html March] ,\n[http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/apr45.html April]\n! width=15%         | Date\n! width=15%         | Target/Topic\n!\n|-\n|\n| First air raid on Vienna during World War II\n|  Petlyakov Pe-8 bombers flew a  round trip also reaching Budapest, Königsberg and Breslau\n|-\n|\n| Floridsdorf\n| The first American air raid on Vienna targeted the Floridsdorf refinery and mined the Danube.\n|-\n|\n| Floridsdorf\n|  B-17s bombed the  oil refinery On this date the 464 BG bombed an oil-blending plant at Vienna.\n|-\n|\n| Kagran\n|  B-17s bombed the  oil refinery1944:\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/44/jan44.htm January] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/44/feb44.htm February] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/44/mar44.htm March] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/44/apr44.htm April] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/44/may44.htm May] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/44/jun44.htm June] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/44/jul44.htm July] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/44/aug44.htm August] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/44/sep44.htm September] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/44/oct44.htm October] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/44/nov44.htm November] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/44/dec44.htm December] 1945:\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/45/jan45.htm January] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/45/feb45.htm February] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/45/mar45.htm March] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/45/apr45.htm April] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/45/may45.htm May] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/45/jun45.htm June] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/45/jul45.htm July] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/45/aug45.htm August] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/45/sep45.htm September]\n|-\n|\n| Lobau\n|  B-24s bombed the Lobau oil refinery.\n|-\n|\n| Schwechat\n|  B-24s bombed the oil refinery at Schwechat in Vienna (Schwechat became a separate city in 1954).\n|-\n|\n| Winterhafen\n|  B-24s bombed the Winterhafen oil depot.
