To properly create such a draft page, please see the articles  ‘Your First Article’,  ‘Referencing for Beginners’ and  ‘Easier Referencing for Beginners’. In short, \"notability\" requires reliable sources about the subject, rather than by the subject.\nPlease note that many of the references would appear to be from sources that are NOT considered  for establishing notability and should be removed (including blogs, company websites, press releases, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Spotify etc).\nAdditionally, the draft tends to read too much like an advertorial, which Wikipedia is not; and contains prose that is not of a standard appropriate for an encyclopaedia (also see WP:PEACOCK).\nThe draft does not appear to show that the subject has any notability beyond the average coverage in trade publications for similar corporations (see WP:ROTM).\nAlso, if you have any connection to the subject, including being the subject (see WP:AUTOBIO) or being paid, you have a conflict of interest that you must declare on your Talk page (to see instructions on how to do this please click the link).\nPlease familiarise yourself with these pages before amending the draft. If you feel you can meet these requirements, then please make the necessary amendments before resubmitting the page. It would help our volunteer reviewers by identifying, on the draft's talk page, the WP:THREE best sources that establish notability of the subject.\nIt would also be helpful if you could please identify with specificity, exactly which criteria you believe the page meets (eg \"I think the page now meets WP:NCORP criteria #3, because XXXXX\").\nOnce you have implemented these suggestions, you may also wish to leave a note for me on my talk page, including the name of the draft page, and I would be happy to reassess.

It was introduced in 2021 as a pilot project and commercially launched in 2023. Pio adapts AutoStore’s cube storage technology into a compact, modular format intended for smaller warehouse operations.\nHistory\nAutoStore announced the Pio project on 30 November 2021 as a pilot initiative to create a simplified version of its cube storage system for small e-commerce businesses. The pilot phase included trials in several markets, with the goal of making warehouse automation more accessible to the small and medium-sized business segment.\nIn 2023, Pio was commercially launched as a smaller-scale adaptation of AutoStore’s high-capacity systems. The following year, AutoStore expanded the product into the United States, where it was covered in DC Velocity. In 2025, The Supply Chain Xchange reported that Bastian Solutions would deploy the first Pio system in a U.S. retail environment, scheduled to be operational ahead of the holiday season.\nServices and technology\nPio is based on AutoStore’s cube storage concept, in which standardized bins are stacked in an aluminum grid and retrieved by autonomous robots running on tracks above the system. The robots deliver bins to operator ports for picking and packing, while a cloud-based software platform provides inventory management and integrates with e-commerce, ERP, and warehouse management systems.\nThe system is modular and can be installed in smaller spaces compared to larger AutoStore deployments. SupplyChainIT reported that Pio is offered under a Robotics-as-a-Service (RaaS) subscription model, in which customers pay a recurring fee that covers the hardware, software, and maintenance.\nReferences"
