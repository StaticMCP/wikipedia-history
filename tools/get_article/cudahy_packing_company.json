In 1955, Purex acquired Old Dutch Cleanser from Cudahy. The Greyhound Corporation acquired the consumer products business of Purex (which included Old Dutch Cleanser) in 1985 and was combined with Greyhound's Armour-Dial division, forming The Dial Corporation. In December 2003, Dial was sold to Henkel for $2.9 billion.\nBy 1922, Cudahy Packing Company was one of the largest packing houses in the United States with over $200 million in annual sales and 13,000 employees around the country with operations in South Omaha, Kansas City, Saint Joseph, Sioux City, Wichita, Memphis, East Chicago, Salt Lake City, and Los Angeles, as well as distribution operations in 97 cities.  The business suffered during the Great Depression, but the company still employed about 1,000 Chicago-area residents during the mid-1930s.\nFollowing World War II, it moved its headquarters first to Omaha and then in 1956 to Phoenix, where it took the name Cudahy Company. In 1957, the company was one of 500 companies listed in the first S&P 500.\nIn 1957, Cudahy purchased the Seattle Packing Company which owned the Bar-S trademark and began selling various meat products under the Cudahy Bar-S name. In 1970, Cudahy was  acquired by General Host which split the Cudahy company into separate business components. The meat processing operations became a division known as Cudahy Foods.\nIn 1981, General Host sold the remnants of the Cudahy meat packing business to Tim Day, president of Cudahy foods who renamed the acquisition  Bar-S Foods Company. Bar-S Foods Company was acquired by the Mexican packer Sigma Alimentos in 2010, which continues to produce meat products in the U.S. under the Bar-S trademark.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* [http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/2635.html Cudahy Packing Co.] Encyclopedia of Chicago\n* Patrick Cudahy, His Life autobiography (1912)\n* History of Cudahy Packing Company and meat packing industry from the Nebraska State Historical Society (RG1605.AM)"
