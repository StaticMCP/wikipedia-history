On its creation in 2007 and in 2012 it returned four council members, using the single transferable vote system. For the 2017 Glasgow City Council election, the ward boundaries were redrawn with a smaller size and population, and it returned three members.\nBoundaries\nLocated in the far north-east of Glasgow, the core of the ward since 2007 includes neighbourhoods between the M8 motorway and the city boundary with North Lanarkshire: Easterhouse, Provanhall, Garthamlock, Craigend, Ruchazie, Hogganfield, Provanmill and Blackhill as well as the village of Gartloch, all bordered by open ground, much of which is within the Seven Lochs Wetland Park.\nThe 2017 changes removed the Robroyston, Barmulloch, Wallacewell and Balornock neighbourhoods located to the west of the M80 motorway, as well as the streets in Millerston within Glasgow, which were added to the Springburn ward. Following the alterations, it was the ward covering the largest area in the city, but with the lowest population spread the most thinly across the territory. A 2019 specific review caused the removal of a few streets of modern housing at Cardowan from the North East ward and the Glasgow council area, re-allocating them to the Stepps, Chryston and Muirhead ward of North Lanarkshire along with the rest of the developments in that area, addressing an anomaly dating back to when the boundary crossed open fields.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=6; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Grant R Thoms(SNP)\n|rowspan=5; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Gilbert Davidson(Labour)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Gerald Leonard(Labour)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Catherine McMaster(Labour)\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=1|Gerry Boyle(SNP)\n|rowspan=3|Maureen Burke(Labour)\n|rowspan=1|Sohan Singh(Labour)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=4|Ruairi Kelly(SNP)\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Mandy Morgan(SNP)\n!colspan=2; rowspan=4|3 seats\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Sharon Greer(Labour)\n|-\n!2024\n|rowspan=1|Mary McNab(Labour)\n|-\n!2025\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Donna McGill(SNP)\n|}\nElection results\n2025 by-election\n2024 by-election\n2022 election\n2022 Glasgow City Council election\n2017 election\n2017 Glasgow City Council election\n2012 election\n2012 Glasgow City Council election\n2007 election\n2007 Glasgow City Council election\nSee also\n*Wards of Glasgow\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/scotland/north-east-ward-glasgow-city#.Xm_v0renzN4 Listed Buildings in North East Ward, Glasgow City] at British Listed Buildings"
