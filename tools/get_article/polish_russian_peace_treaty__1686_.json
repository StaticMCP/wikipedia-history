It was signed in Moscow on 6 May 1686 by Polish–Lithuanian envoys Krzysztof Grzymułtowski, Voivode of Poznań and Marcjan Ogiński, Chancellor of Lithuania, as well as the Russian knyaz Vasily Vasilyevich Golitsyn. These parties were incited to cooperate after a major geopolitical intervention in the southern regions of Zaporozhie on the part of the Ottoman Empire.\nThe treaty confirmed the earlier Truce of Andrusovo of 1667. It consisted of a preamble and 33 articles. The treaty secured Russia's possession of left-bank Ukraine, plus the right-bank city of Kiev. 146,000 rubles were to be paid to Poland as compensation for the loss of the left bank. The region of Zaporizhian Sich, Siverian lands, cities of Chernigov, Starodub, Smolensk and its outskirts were also ceded to Russia, while Poland retained right-bank Ukraine. Both parties agreed not to sign a separate treaty with the Ottoman Empire. By signing this treaty, Russia became a member of the anti-Turkish coalition, which comprised Poland–Lithuania, the Holy Roman Empire and Venice. Russia pledged to organize a military campaign against the Crimean Khanate, which led to the Russo-Turkish War of 1686–1700.\nThe treaty was a major success for Russian diplomacy. Strongly opposed in the Polish–Lithuanian confederation, it was not ratified by the Sejm (parliament) until 1710. The legal legitimacy of its ratification has been disputed. According to Jacek Staszewski, the treaty was not confirmed by a resolution of the Sejm until the Convocation Sejm of 1764.\nThe borders between Russia and the Commonwealth established by the treaty remained in effect until the First Partition of Poland in 1772.\nFile:Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth 1635.svg|Polish-Lithuanian territorial losses 1657–1686 marked in orange\nFile:Truce of Andrusovo 1667.PNG|Truce of Andrusovo 1667: Russian gains in dark green\nFile:Irp1686.png|The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth after the 1686 treaty\nReferences"
