It is a collection of 22 songs (LP release) and 26 songs (CD release) by German composer Hanns Eisler and sung by Krause in English. She also sang the songs in the original German which were simultaneously released by Antilles on a companion album, Panzerschlacht: Die Lieder von Hanns Eisler on LP and CD.\nTank Battles was reissued by Voiceprint Records in 1994 with all its original tracks from Tank Battles, plus ten bonus tracks taken from the German edition, Panzerschlacht.\nReception\n}}\nIn a review of Tank Battles at AllMusic, John Dougan called it \"[a] worthy follow up\" to Krause's previous album, Supply and Demand. He said her vocals here are \"stunning\" and the instrumental backing is \"impeccable\".\nWriting in The Wire, Philip Clark called Tank Battles a \"laudable attempt\" by Krause to present a modern interpretation of songs by Eisler-Brecht. He said producer Greg Cohen's \"sensitive arrangements\" of the album's material \"winningly evokes 1920s Berlin\". Clark stated that Krause's \"vocal production, the shaping of her melodic contours and the brittle, staccato phrasing\" all owes itself to Eisler's work.\nLegacy\nThe album was included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\nTrack listing\nTank Battles: The Songs Of Hanns Eisler (Antilles, LP, 1988)\nAll titles composed by Hanns Eisler.
