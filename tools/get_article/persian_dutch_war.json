Petronhoting, the commander of the Dutch and in charge of the Dutch East India Company in the Persian Gulf at the time, who was stationed in Musselstein Kharg Castle and had lost an important part of his naval power, asked for help from Sheikh Saadun Bushehri, but Saadun made excuses because he was afraid of Mirmahna's attacks. In the end, he did not go to the help of his Dutch friends. In the end, Mir mahna landed part of his forces on Kharg Island (which was captured by the Dutch during the occupation of Kharg ) near the Armenian neighborhood and away from the Dutch cannons. On the 1st December (December 22, 1765) they attacked and besieged Musselstein Castle, until they captured it after some time.\nBattle\nOn December 12, 1765 (December 21, 1144), a Dutch ship came from Basra to Kharg, and the Dutch from Kharg sent their 2 Galliot warships to welcome and escort that ship. In order to avoid the attack of Mir Mahna in Khargo Island was to be protected, but Mir Mahna, on the orders of Karim Khan Zand with his men captured not only the mentioned cargo ship but also 2 Dutch warships and captured 40 European passengers and 18 local sailors.\nSee also\n* Dutch–Safavid relations\n* Portuguese–Safavid wars\n* Naval history of Iran\nReferences"
