Anti-terrorism resolutions adopted by the United Nations Security Council, such as Resolutions 1267, 1373, 1333, and 1456, are also important bases for China's anti-terrorism activities.\nDue to the high incidence of international terrorist activities and the infiltration and incitement of East Turkestan independence movement forces at home and abroad, the threat of violent terrorist activities in China has become increasingly prominent. Many violent terrorist cases have occurred, causing serious losses to the lives and property of the people and threatening China's national security, social stability, economic development, national unity and the safety of people's lives and property.\nIn October 2014, the 11th session of the Standing Committee of the 12th National People's Congress reviewed the Counterterrorism Law of the People's Republic of China for the first time. On November 3, 2014, the draft was published and public opinions were solicited.  On February 25, 2015, the 13th session of the Standing Committee of the 12th National People's Congress reviewed the draft Counterterrorism Law for the second time.\nOn December 27, 2015, the 60th Chairperson's Meeting of the 12th NPC Standing Committee decided to submit the draft Counterterrorism Law to the closing meeting of the 18th Session of the 12th NPC Standing Committee for voting. On the same day, the closing meeting of the 18th Session of the 12th NPC Standing Committee was held. 159 people attended the meeting out of 168 who were supposed to attend.

On the same day, President Xi Jinping signed Presidential Order No. 36 to promulgate the law in accordance with the decision of the NPC Standing Committee, which came into effect on January 1, 2016.\nProvisions\nThe Counterterrorism Law consists of 10 chapters and 97 articles, which provide for the identification of terrorist organizations and personnel, security precautions, intelligence information, investigation, response and disposal, international cooperation, safeguards, and legal responsibilities. It defines the system, mechanism, means, and measures of China's anti-terrorism work.\nArticle 3 provides a clear definition of terrorism, namely, \"the advocacy and actions of achieving political, ideological and other purposes by means of violence, sabotage, intimidation and other means to create public panic, endanger public security, infringe upon personal property, or coerce state organs or international organizations.\"\nSee also\n* Terrorism in China\nReferences"
