His father was a charcoal burner at the Knole House Estate. King became a caddy at the club as a boy, and learned to play.  By 1929, he was the assistant club professional, and began playing in local and national tournaments. In his career, King had nine top-10 finishes at The Open Championship between 1939 and 1959.\nKing was a member of Great Britain's 1937, 1947, and 1949 Ryder Cup teams, including scoring his team's only point in 1947. He had qualified for the 1939 team, but the event was cancelled after the outbreak of World War II.  During the war, he served in the Home Guard before returning to professional golf in 1946.\nKing became the head professional at Knole Golf Club in 1955, and later won the PGA Seniors Championship in both 1961 and 1962.  He retired in 1976 and moved to Lincolnshire.\nKing died at age 91 in 2003, after being hospitalized for pneumonia.  He is buried at St. Peter and St. Paul's church in Seal, Kent.\nProfessional wins (22)\nBritish PGA circuit wins (6)\n*1933 Daily Mirror Assistants' Tournament\n*1936 Dunlop-Southern Tournament\n*1937 Daily Mail Tournament, Dunlop-Southern Tournament\n*1944 Yorkshire Evening News Tournament\n*1949 Yorkshire Evening News Tournament\nOther wins (16)\n*1932 Kent Professional Championship\n*1933 Kent Professional Championship\n*1934 Kent Professional Championship\n*1935 Kent Professional Championship\n*1936 Kent Professional Championship\n*1937 Kent Professional Championship\n*1946 Kent Professional Championship\n*1947 Kent Professional Championship\n*1948 Kent Professional Championship\n*1949 Kent Professional Championship\n*1950 Kent Professional Championship\n*1951 Kent Professional Championship\n*1955 Kent Professional Championship\n*1960 Kent Professional Championship\n*1961 PGA Seniors Championship\n*1962 PGA Seniors Championship\nResults in major championships\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;text-align:center;\"\n!Tournament\n!1932\n!1933\n!1934\n!1935\n!1936\n!1937\n!1938\n!1939\n|-\n|align=left|The Open Championship\n|CUT\n|CUT\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|T23\n|T28\n|T29\n|T23\n|style=\"background:yellow;\"|T3\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;text-align:center;\"\n!Tournament\n!1940\n!1941\n!1942\n!1943\n!1944\n!1945\n!1946\n!1947\n!1948\n!1949\n|-\n|align=left|The Open Championship\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|NT\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|NT\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|NT\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|NT\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|NT\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|NT\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:yellow;\"|T6\n|style=\"background:yellow;\"|T7\n|style=\"background:yellow;\"|T4\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;text-align:center;\"\n!Tournament\n!1950\n!1951\n!1952\n!1953\n!1954\n!1955\n!1956\n!1957\n!1958\n!1959\n|-\n|align=left|The Open Championship\n|style=\"background:yellow;\"|T9\n|T35\n|style=\"background:yellow;\"|T5\n|style=\"background:yellow;\"|7\n|style=\"background:yellow;\"|T8\n|CUT\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|T24\n|T30\n|style=\"background:yellow;\"|T5\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;text-align:center;\"\n!Tournament\n!1960\n!1961\n!1962\n|-\n|align=left|The Open Championship\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|T35\n|CUT\n|}\nNote: King only played in The Open Championship.\nNT = No tournament\nCUT = missed the half-way cut\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place\nTeam appearances\n*Ryder Cup (representing Great Britain): 1937, 1947, 1949\n*England–Scotland Professional Match (representing England): 1934 (winners), 1936 (winners), 1937 (winners), 1938 (winners)\n*Llandudno International Golf Trophy (representing England): 1938 (winners)\nReferences\n}}"
