In 1483, Atabeg Kvarkvare II routed the royal troops at Aradeti. These events signaled the end of the united Kingdom of Georgia, which disintegrated into several principalities. Kvarkvare gained his long sought independence in Samtskhe while Eristav Bagrat seized the thrones of Imereti and Kartli and Giorgi VIII carved out his own realm in Kakheti.\nReferences"
