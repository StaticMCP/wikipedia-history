Mohamed Bey attempting to save himself allied with the Moroccans, albeit as they had no common borders, the Moroccans could do nothing other than send him weaponry. Knowing that his weak army couldn't defeat the Algerians, he decided to offer a tribute. Hadj Chabane refused this, and attacked the Tunisians after two unsuccessful attacks carried about by Mohamed Bey. The battle ended in a catastrophic defeat for the Tunisians, who fled from the invading forces.\nAftermath\nMohamed bey retreated into Tunis and planned on fortifying the town, and holding back the Algerian forces.\nReferences"
