      "text": "# Nostalgia for the Polish People's Republic\n\n\", Junak bike, 1956–1965, also since 2010]]\nIn modern Polish culture there is nostalgia for some aspects of life in the Polish People's Republic (, PRL), the communist period of the country's history between 1947 and 1989.\nAs with other manifestations of communist nostalgia, for people who lived during the period of the PRL, the two major factors that cause PRL nostalgia are a dissatisfaction with the present and memories of a happily recollected past.\nBusinesses were quick to respond to the phenomenon by renewing the manufacture of products from PRL times, such as warm ice cream, zapiekanka, Polo-Cockta, podpiwek, Grodziskie, Junak motorcycles, and Ludwik laundry detergent.\nSee also\n* Museum of the Polish People's Republic, Kraków\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://mzprl.pl/?lang=en Communism Museum, Warsaw]"
