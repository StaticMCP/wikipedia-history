The major parties contesting the election were the Queensland Labor Party led by Premier Vince Gair, the Labor Party led by former Deputy Premier Jack Duggan, and the Country-Liberal coalition led by Frank Nicklin.\nThe elections, only 15 months into the parliamentary term, were made necessary by the collapse of the nine-term Labor government. Gair had formed the Queensland Labor Party after being expelled from the Labor Party, and attempted to stay in power as a minority government.  However, a request for supply was denied on 12 June, forcing the election.  The Country-Liberal Coalition won a decisive victory, taking 42 seats against only 31 for the two Labor factions combined.\nKey dates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Date\n!

On 26 April, Gair and 25 MLAs met and formed the Queensland Labor Party (QLP) with those present, with Gair as leader. Those at the meeting included all of the Cabinet except Deputy Premier Jack Duggan and two ex-Labor Independents.  All these were also expelled from the party. Duggan resigned from the ministry on 29 April and succeeded Gair as leader of the Labor Party, which commanded the support of 22 MLAs.\nGair almost immediately began talks with Nicklin for confidence and supply support in the legislature.  However, Nicklin broke them off on the advice of federal Country Party leader Arthur Fadden (himself a Queenslander), who believed the ructions in Labor gave Nicklin a chance to become Premier himself, ending 22 years in opposition.  On 12 June 1957, Lieutenant Governor and Chief Justice of Queensland Alan Mansfield (Governor John Lavarack was indisposed) ordered Parliament to reassemble.  Shortly after 10:30 pm that night, Treasurer Ted Walsh moved that supply be granted to the Gair QLP government.  The motion was defeated after the ALP and Coalition rose to vote against it, bringing the Gair government down.  Gair immediately asked for new elections, which were called for 3 August.\nCampaign\nOn 1 July, Frank Nicklin delivered the Country Party's policy speech at Maroochydore, while Kenneth Morris delivered the Liberal Party's policy speech in Brisbane. The two coalition partners declared to the electorate that only they could deliver unity and effective government, an acceleration of development and civil rights, as well as court supervision of union ballots to limit strike action.\nOn 4 July, Jack Duggan, the Labor leader, announced Labor's campaign slogan, \"A fair go for all\", and promised three weeks' annual leave (the issue over which Premier Vince Gair and the party executive had split) would be implemented if his party was elected. On 8 July, Gair, the incumbent Premier representing the Queensland Labor Party (QLP), spent half his speech talking about the dispute that had led to the split, promised an attack upon Communism and a continuance of the previous government's development platform.\nNominations closed on 12 July, with a record total of 219 candidates. Four seats were uncontested, but many seats had both Labor and QLP contestants. Some contests became particularly bitter as the Labor Party accused their QLP opponents of sectarianism and alleged direct interference by ministers of the Catholic Church, despite Archbishop James Duhig's refusal to get involved. The campaigns were strongest in the leaders' and deputy leaders' own seats.\nPoliticians from around Australia, in particular from the Labor Party, came to Queensland during the campaign, including the federal opposition leader, Dr H. V. Evatt, Arthur Calwell, Clyde Cameron and former Victorian premier John Cain, who died of a stroke on 9 August after giving a speech in Townsville.\n| house = Legislative Assembly\n| series = Queensland state election\n| back = 1956\n| forward = 1960\n| enrolled = 747,455\n| total_votes = 706,909\n| turnout % = 94.58\n| turnout chg = +1.57\n| informal = 8,033\n| informal % = 1.14\n| informal chg = –0.07\n}}\n|}\n|28.90}}\n|23.23}}\n|19.99}}\n|3.40}}\n}}\n|32.00}}\n|26.67}}\n|24.00}}\n|1.33}}\n}}\n: 791,719 electors were enrolled to vote at the election, but three Country seats representing 30,956 enrolled voters and one Liberal seat representing 13,308 voters were unopposed.\nSeats changing party representation\nThis table lists changes in party representation at the 1957 election.\nParty changes before election\nThe following seats changed party representation before the election due to the split of the ALP.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Wood, the member for North Toowoomba, died in office on 29 March 1958, and Duggan returned as both a member of Parliament and leader of the party at the by-election on 31 May. Dittmer, meanwhile, was elected to the Australian Senate.\nFormer Prime Minister Frank Forde, who lost his seat of Flinders by one vote, alleged the wrongful disallowance of some votes and successfully lodged a petition against his opponent's return at the Court of Disputed Returns; however he lost the resulting by-election.\nSee also\n* Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, 1956–1957\n* Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, 1957–1960\n* Candidates of the Queensland state election, 1957\n* Gair Ministry\n* Nicklin Ministry\nReferences=="
