      "text": "# 2012–13 Golden State Warriors season\n\nThe 2012–13 Golden State Warriors season was the 67th season of the franchise in the National Basketball Association (NBA), and the 51st anniversary of their time in the San Francisco Bay Area.\nThe team finished with a record of 47–35 (.573), and finished the season as the number-six seed, clinching a playoff berth for the first time since 2007. The team had a winning record for the first time since 2008. This season included the first playoff series victory for the first time since 2007, as most of the squad experienced postseason play for the first time. The season began a streak of 7 straight winning records.\nThe Warriors had four draft picks in the 2012 NBA draft, a decisive draft year that was vital for a potential future for the team. The picks included Harrison Barnes with the 7th pick, Festus Ezeli with the 30th pick, Draymond Green with the 35th pick, and Ognjen Kuzmic with the 52nd pick. With Brandon Rush and his season-ending injury, Barnes was placed in the starting lineup and became crucial in bringing the team back to the playoffs for the first time in six years. Another injury mid-season from Andrew Bogut also affected the team with the lack of a true center for a majority of the season.\nThe season was marked by significant highlights, such as Stephen Curry surpassing the existing record for the most three-point field goals made in a single season; Curry's 272 three-pointers beat the 269 shot by Ray Allen in the 2005-06 season. During the 2014-15 season in which what would turn out to be the Warriors' breakout season, Curry and Klay Thompson would ascend to preeminence in the NBA. Ultimately establishing themselves as one of the most prolific duos in NBA history for their exceptional three-point shooting skills, earning the nickname \"Splash Brothers\" for their remarkable proficiency in shooting from beyond the three-point line in record-breaking numbers. A seven-game Eastern Conference road trip featured a 6–1 record, including a close win against the defending champion Miami Heat. David Lee was named as an All-Star in the 2013 NBA All-Star Game in Houston, and thus became the first Warrior since Latrell Sprewell in 1997 to be named an All-Star. Lee also led the league in double-doubles. The Warriors returned to the playoffs for the first time in six years; for most players the first time experiencing postseason play except Bogut. After a 4–2 series win against the number-three seed Denver Nuggets in the first round, the Warriors won a playoff series for the first time since 2007. In the conference semi-final, the Warriors faced the number two-seed San Antonio Spurs. Curry scored 44 points in a double-overtime loss in Game 1, but the team pulled off a 100-91 Game 2 win, which was the first Warriors victory, playoff or regular season, in San Antonio since February 1997 and did not occur again until April 10, 2016 (when the same Warriors' team also defeated the same Spurs' team in their only home loss of the 2016 season which tied the 1985–86 Boston Celtics home record for most wins at home during the regular season at 40–1), to tie the series at one game apiece. However, despite the willingness to fight, the inexperience and youth of the Warrior squad resulted in defeat as the Warriors lost to the eventual Western Conference Champion Spurs in six games.\nDraft\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\"\n|-\n!  style=\"background:#006bb6; color:#fdb927; width:10%;\"| Round\n!  style=\"background:#006bb6; color:#fdb927; width:10%;\"| Pick\n!  style=\"background:#006bb6; color:#fdb927; width:20%;\"| Player\n!  style=\"background:#006bb6; color:#fdb927; width:15%;\"| Position\n!  style=\"background:#006bb6; color:#fdb927; width:15%;\"| Nationality\n!  style=\"background:#006bb6; color:#fdb927; width:20%;\"| School / club team\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| 1\n| 7\n| Harrison Barnes\n| SF\n|\n| North Carolina\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| 1\n| 30\n| Festus Ezeli\n| C\n|\n| Vanderbilt\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| 2\n| 35\n| Draymond Green\n| PF\n|\n| Michigan State\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| 2\n| 52\n| Ognjen Kuzmić\n| C\n|\n|  Clinicas Rincón\n|}\nPre-season\n|- style=\"background:#cfc;\"\n| 1\n| October 7\n| @ L.
