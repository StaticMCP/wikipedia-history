      "text": "# Everton East (Liverpool ward)\n\nEverton East ward is an electoral district of Liverpool City Council within the Liverpool Riverside Parliamentary constituency.\nThe ward was created for the elections held on 4 May 2023 following a 2022 review by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England, which decided that the previous 30 wards each represented by three Councillors should be replaced by 64 wards represented by 85 councillors with varying representation by one, two or three councillors per ward. The Everton East ward was created as a single-member ward from the eastern half of the former Everton ward and parts of the former Anfield and Kensington & Fairfield wards. The ward boundaries follow Everton Road, Breck Road, behind Sedley Street, Belmont Grove, Belmont Road, Sheil Road and Boaler Street. The ward  includes the Liverpool Olympia.\nCouncillors\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Election!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor\n|-\n| 2023\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Ellie Byrne (Lab)\n|}\nindicates seat up for re-election after boundary changes.\nindicates seat up for re-election.\nindicates change in affiliation.\nindicates seat up for re-election after casual vacancy.\nElection results\nElections of the 2020s\n}}\n§Ellie Byrne was a re-standing councillor for Everton ward.\nReferences"
