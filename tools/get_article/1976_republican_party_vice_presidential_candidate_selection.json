At the 1976 Republican National Convention, incumbent President Gerald Ford narrowly won the presidential nomination over former California Governor Ronald Reagan. Ford had decided not to choose incumbent Vice President Nelson Rockefeller as his running mate, due to Rockefeller's unpopularity with the right wing of the Republican Party and Rockefeller wanting to retire from politics all together, which probably hurt his campaign for doing so. He instead chose Senator Bob Dole of Kansas. Dole was acceptable to the conservative wing of the party, and Ford hoped that Dole would help the ticket win the western states and the agricultural vote. The Ford–Dole ticket ultimately lost to the Carter–Mondale ticket in the general election.\nThough he would not win the presidential nomination, Reagan announced before the convention that he would pick Senator Richard Schweiker of Pennsylvania as his running mate. Dole went on to become Senate Republican leader, and the Republican presidential nominee in 1996 but ultimately lost to incumbent President Bill Clinton in the general election.\nPotential candidates\nNominee\nFile: Ks 1996 dole (cropped).jpg |alt=|\nOther potential candidates\nFile:Anne Armstrong - 1973 (cropped2).jpg|\nFile:Senator Howard Baker 1979.jpg|\nFile:Temple Black 1990.jpg|\nFile:John Connally (cropped).jpg|\nFile:Ronald Reagan, 14 May 1974 (cropped).jpg|\nFile:ElliotLeeRichardson.jpg|\nFile:WILLIAM RUCKELSHAUS, FIRST ADMINISTRATOR OF EPA - NARA - 549114 (3x4).jpg|\nFile:William E Simon (cropped).jpg|\nSee also\n*Gerald Ford 1976 presidential campaign\n*1976 Republican Party presidential primaries\n*1976 Republican National Convention\n*1976 United States presidential election\n*List of United States major party presidential tickets\nReferences"
