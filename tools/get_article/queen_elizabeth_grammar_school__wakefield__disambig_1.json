The school was founded by Royal Charter of Queen Elizabeth I in 1591 at the request of leading citizens in Wakefield (headed by Thomas Savile and his two sons) 75 in total and some of whom formed the first governing body.\nThe school is part of a foundation, with both QEGS Senior and Junior schools joined together, along with the nearby Wakefield Girls' High School and its Junior School, and Mulberry House, which is a nursery and pre-prep department.\nAs of September 2021, the headmaster of the school is Dr Richard Brookes, who was previously senior deputy head at City of London School.\nQEGS is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference.\nHistory\nFounding\nQueen Elizabeth Grammar School dates back to 19 November 1591 when a charter was granted to fourteen men to act as governors of the new school.  In 1598, it moved into a purpose-built building, now the Elizabethan Gallery.\nThe charter read:\nFive of the fourteen men designated to be governors bore the name Saville. Generations of the Saville family have played important roles in the school's history and hence the reason why the Old Boys' Association is called the Old Savilians' Club.\nCoat of arms\n}}\nThe school arms came into existence soon after the school was founded and features a lion, an owl and a Bible. The golden lion on a red field refers to the royal foundation; the silver owl on black is taken from the arms of the Savile family (one of the founding families) and the Bible indicates the religious side of education. The school motto, \"Turpe Nescire\", means \"It is a disgrace to be ignorant\".\nSchool song\nAround 1900, H. G. Abel, then the senior classics master, composed \"Floreas, Wakefieldia\" and Matthew Peacock, headmaster and honorary choirmaster at the cathedral, set the words to music. It was seen as fitting that the song should be written in Latin, thereby evoking echoes of traditional scholasticism. The song is still sung today – at Founders' Day, Speech Day and at all Old Savilian Club dinners.\nFacilities\nIn 1854 QEGS moved to its present site in Northgate, Wakefield, into premises designed by the architect Richard Lane and formerly occupied by the West Riding Proprietary School. The attached Junior school for boys aged 7 to 11 was founded in 1910.\nA new building (Savile Building) was opened in 2005 by Ted Wragg, the famous educationalist, who taught at the school in the early 1960s. The new building provides a new 6th form centre, English department, state-of-the-art theatre and Learning Resources Centre for the pupils of QEGS.\nSport\nThe school is often noted for its sporting ability, having achieved frequent success in a number of sports. Over 83% of the school's boys represent QEGS in one sporting event or another. The most popular sport is rugby union, followed by hockey, cricket, athletics, and basketball. Hockey in particular has experienced substantial growth in the school throughout the last decade, and is now close to matching rugby union's dominance internally. In 2006, 2013, 2014 and 2015 the under-15s Rugby side reached the Daily Mail Cup final, winning the 2015 competition in a tight 15–6 win over three time final rivals Warwick. In 2009 every age group won the hockey 'Yorkshire Cup' for the first time in the school's history with the under 16s going on to reach the national semi-finals, only to lose to Whitgift School. As well as plenty of sporting opportunities, the school also gives pupils the opportunity to participate in the Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme.\nIn popular culture\n*David Storey's Booker Prize winning novel Saville (1976) includes an account of the experiences of a working class boy at a Yorkshire grammar school in the 1940s. Storey, like the protagonist of Saville a miner's son, is an old boy of QEGS.\n*The school is mentioned in the novel Nineteen Seventy-Four by David Peace.\nHeadmasters\nHeadmasters of Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Wakefield from 1591 to the present time.\n* 1591–1598 Rev Edward Mawde MA, St John's College, Cambridge\n* 1600–1607 Rev John Beaumont MA\n* 1607-1607 Rev Jeremy Gibson MA\n* 1607-1607 Rev Robert Saunders MA, Fellow of King's College, Cambridge\n* 1607–1623 Rev Philip Isack MA, Emmanuel College, Cambridge\n* 1623–1663 Rev Robert Doughty MA\n* 1663–1665 Rev Samuel Garvey MA, Emmanuel College, Cambridge\n* 1665–1672 Rev Jeremiah Boulton MA, Magdalene College, Cambridge\n* 1672–1681 Rev John Baskervile BD, Emmanuel College, Cambridge\n* 1681–1693 Rev Edward Clarke MA, University College, Oxford\n* 1693–1703 Rev Edmund Farrer MA, St John's College, Cambridge\n* 1703–1720 Rev Thomas Clark MA, Jesus College, Cambridge\n* 1720–1751 Rev Benjamin Wilson MA, Trinity College, Cambridge\n* 1751–1758 Rev John Clarke MA, Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge\n* 1758–1795 Rev Christopher Atkinson MA, The Queen's College, Oxford\n* 1795–1814 Rev Thomas Rogers MA, Magdalene College, Cambridge\n* 1814–1837 Rev Martin Joseph Naylor DD, Fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge\n* 1837–1847 Rev John Carter DD, St John's College, Cambridge\n* 1847–1875 Rev James Taylor DD, Trinity College, Cambridge\n* 1875–1883 Robert Leighton Leighton MA, Balliol College, Oxford\n* 1883–1910 Matthew Henry Peacock MA BMus, Exeter College, Oxford\n* 1911–1916 Joseph E.
