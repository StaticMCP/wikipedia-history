At last Turenne prevailed and had the Imperialists at a disadvantage on the Sasbach, where, in opening the action, he was killed by a cannon-shot (27 July).\nDevastated by the loss of their commander, the French hastily surrendered all their advantages, and Montecucculi sharply following up their retreat, and drove them over the Rhine and almost to the Vosges.\nAt the same time the Imperial forces under Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine were besieging Trier, which Turenne had taken in the autumn of 1673.\nBattle\nCréquy was sent with 14,000 men and 11 guns to relieve the city.\nThey were stopped at the bridge over the Saar River at Konz.\nThe Imperialists sent a force under Ottone Enrico Del Carretto, marquis of Grana, to occupy what is today known as the Grana-heights. Another force crossed the bridge at Konz and a third force crossed the river over a pontoon bridge.\nThey attacked the French camp and an indecisive battle raged for three hours. Then Otto de Grana engaged his right flank on the right moment and the French fled the battlefield, leaving behind all their guns and wagons. The Germans pursued the French over 50 kilometers.\nCréquy made his way into Trier to assume command, but was forced to surrender on 9 September.\nOn the battlefield a Grana-memorial was erected in 1892 under Wilhelm II, not honouring Otto de Grana, but glorifying unified Germany.\nReferences\nSources\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://web.infinito.it/utenti/f/francots/ass/coalizi5.htm Battles of the Franco-Dutch War (Italian)]"
