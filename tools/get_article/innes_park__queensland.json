The town is  north of the state capital, Brisbane. In the , the locality of Innes Park had a population of 2,653 people.\nGeography\nInnes Park residential area is located on a low rocky section of the coast with two small beaches either side. The northern beach is 400 metres long and has a high tide sand beach fronted by a mixture of sand and boulders at low tide. There is good road access at the southern end, with a small foredune behind the beach and a now stable sand blow at the northern end. The southern Innes Park Beach () straddles the mouth of Palmer Creek (). It is 400 metres long and consists of a narrow strip of high tide sand fronted by a continuous, sloping boulder field, with some sand in the small creek mouth. The beach is backed by a casuarina-covered foredune and a park with BBQs, children's playground, exercise facilities, beach volleyball court, public conveniences and car parks grouped at its southern end. All four beaches are only suitable for swimming toward high tide, with low tide generally revealing a rocky shoreline. Currents in and out of the creeks can be very strong mid-tide. There are various reef breaks along this coast, which need to be checked out with the locals. There is rock fishing the length of the coast, as well as in the small creek at Innes Park.\nThe foreshore is part of the Great Sandy Marine Park. As such, there are limits on some activities off shore. It is part of a turtle monitoring area and spearfishing, bait netting, crabbing, and line fishing are forbidden south of the mouth of Palmer Creek to past Barolin Rocks for 500m east of the low tide line.\nHistory\nThe Innes Park area was first occupied by European settlers in 1863, as part of the Barolin pastoral station. The Barolin House homestead, near Elliott Heads, about  south of Innes Park, was later built on the station. In 1912, the property was acquired by Sidney North Innes. In 1930, Innes and his wife Caroline donated land to the Shire of Woongarra for recreation purposes. Their son Sidney Burnett Innes later subdivided land for rural and residential use. In 1986, the town was named Innes Park after the donors.\nHistorically, the locality had two quarries:\n* Bargara Quarry, Cockerills Road ()\n* Innes Park Quarry, 373 Back Windermere Road ()\nbut, in 2014, the Planning and Environment Court determined that no further quarrying should occur after 2016.\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Innes Park had a population of 2,302 people.\nIn the , the locality of Innes Park had a population of 2,653 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Innes Park.
