The battle was fought between the Kingdom of Castile, whose forces were commanded by Henry III of Castile, and the Emirate of Granada, whose troops were commanded by Sultan Muhammad VII.\nBattle\nThe Kingdom of Castile had signed a peace treaty with the Nasrid dynasty who controlled the Emirate of Granada. Power struggles and changes in the court of the Emirate of Granada prompted them to break the cease fire. Muhammad VII, encouraged and aided by the Marinid Dynasty of Morocco, invaded the territory of Murcia. Henry III of Castile, who had completed a series of battles against Portugal, saw his opportunity to counter the Granadan threat after signing a peace treaty with the Portuguese in 1402. One of the more famous Castilian knights that participated in this campaign was Juan de Tovar y Toledo, who was given land and title in part for his actions at Collejares. Henry III moved against Granada, the last Muslim stronghold on the Iberian Peninsula after centuries of Reconquista. The two armies met in the area around Collejares, localized near the towns of Úbeda and Baeza. The Castilian forces were able to rout the forces of the Emirate of Granada.  Henry III would die a few months later in December 1406.\nReferences"
