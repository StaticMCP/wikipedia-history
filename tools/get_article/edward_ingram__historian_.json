Having obtained his BA and MA degrees from Balliol College, Oxford, Ingram went on to receive his PhD in international history from the London School of Economics, completing his doctoral dissertation under the direction of Hilda Lee and Elie Kedourie. Most of Ingram's scholarly publishing focused on the so-called Great Game, the imperial rivalry between the British and Russian Empires in Central Asia. In 1966 he joined the faculty of Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. In 1978 he was made Professor of Imperial History at SFU and became editor of the International History Review, holding the former position until his retirement in 2003. He remained Professor of Imperial History Emeritus at SFU until his passing in 2022.\nIngram died in Carterton, New Zealand on March 15, 2022.\nSelected bibliography\nBooks\n*Two Views of British India: The Private Correspondence of Mr. Dundas and Lord Wellesley, 1798–1801 (Editor, 1970)\n*The Beginning of the Great Game in Asia, 1828–1834 (1979)\n*Commitment to Empire: Prophecies of the Great Game in Asia 1797–1800 (1981)\n*In Defence of British India: Great Britain in the Middle East, 1774–1842 (1984)\n*National and International Politics in the Middle East: Essays in Honour of Elie Kedourie (Editor, 1986, contributing \"Introduction: Six Variations on a Theme,\" pp.&nbsp;1–15, and a \"How and How not to Negotiate with Iran,\" pp.&nbsp;31–53.)\n*''Britain's Persian Connection, 1798–1828: Prelude to the Great Game in Asia (1992)\n*Eastern Questions in the Nineteenth Century: Collected Essays (Editor, 1993)\n*Anglo-Ottoman Encounters in the Age of Revolution (Editor, 1993)\n*Empire Building and Empire Builders (1995)\n*The British Empire as a World Power'' (2001)\nChapters in books\n*'India and the North-West Frontier: The First Afghan War' in Great Powers and Little Wars: The Limits of Power, Elizabeth Jane Essington & Hamish Ion (eds) (New York: Praegar) 1993.\nJournal articles\n*'The Disguising and Timing of Conquest', Indo-British Review, 1994.\n*'The Geopolitics of the First British Expedition to Egypt -
