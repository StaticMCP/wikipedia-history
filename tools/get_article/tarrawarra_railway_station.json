The station opened in 1889 and closed along with the line in December 1980. In the 1970s, timetables showed that the station was a flag stop because of the small number of passengers using the station.\nHistory\nThe section of track through the location of the station is now maintained by the Yarra Valley Railway, which is based at Healesville. A tourist service operates on weekends, and school and public holidays, using a restored Walker railmotor, to the rear of the Tarrawarra Estate Winery, just through the tunnel about 3&nbsp;km east of the former station.\nTarrawarra station is expected to become a crossing loop when the station reopens as part of the restoration of the line to Yarra Glen. Work has commenced to replace the wooden bridges between the station and Yarra Glen, which were burned in the Black Saturday bushfires in 2009. Currently the Tarrawarra yard is being used as a major staging area for the restoration project.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.street-directory.com.au/sd3/map.php?x=145.42654317960506&y=-37.657232817557684&l=13&mt=4 Melway map] at street-directory.com.au"
