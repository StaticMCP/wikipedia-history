In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 14 students with  2 teachers and 2 non-teaching staff (1 full-time equivalent). Following the absorption of the locality of Mistake Creek into neighbouring localities in May 2019, the school is now within the locality of Clermont.\nAmenities\nThere are other local organisations including Mistake Creek Progress Association and the Mistake Creek Playgroup.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  — map before Mistake Creek was discontinued\n*  — map after Mistake Creek was discontinued\n* '' School's page giving its address using location \"Mistake Creek\" and showing location of school on map''"
