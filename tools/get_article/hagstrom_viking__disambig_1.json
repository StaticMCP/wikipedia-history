It was originally launched in 1965 and was built until it was discontinued in 1979 a few years before Hagström closed down their manufacturing in Sweden. The Viking is currently being reproduced by the Hagström brand.\n1965 to 1979\nThe Hagström Viking was the first semi-acoustic guitar built by the Hagström company. It was launched in 1965 alongside Hagström's new 12-string guitar and two bass guitars. Two years later there was a twelve-string model launched simple called the Viking 12 and the Viking II Deluxe which featured gold plated machine heads and adjustable bridges. In 1967 Hagström player Frank Zappa's \"Nifty, Tough & Bitchen\" advertising agency was hired to promote the Hagström brand in the USA. This resulted in three print ads: \"Nifty\", \"Long and Slippery\", and \"Folk Rock is a Drag\", and a radio spot: \"Long and Slippery\".\nA vintage Hagström Viking fitted with a Bigsby vibrato.\nIn 1968 Hagström got much publicity when Elvis Presley played a Hagström Viking at the Elvis Presley Comeback Television Special for N.B.C. in the USA. Al Casey played a Viking II in the orchestra and was asked by producer Bones Howe if Elvis could borrow the guitar for the appearance. According to Elvis's drummer Hal Blaine it was considered a lucky charm by Elvis. To take advantage of this Hagström used pictures of Elvis with the Viking in ads until Elvis's manager advised them not to.\nIn 1972 the Viking I N replaced the original Viking; it was slightly reworked with two humbuckers replacing the original single-coil pickups and a new headstock called the ducks foot which previously had been used on the Hagström Swede. At the end of 1975 Schaller machine-heads replaced the older Van Ghent. From 1977 to 1978 all guitars featured Schaller machine-head with special butterfly design from Jimmy D´Aquisto. In 1979 the Viking was discontinued and four years later the Hagström plant in Sweden finally closed its doors.\n2004 to present\nAs of 2004 the Hagström brand has been resurrected and is currently marketing models based on the popular Swedish designs including the Viking. The new lineup is being produced in a dedicated plant in China, and includes four Viking models: the Viking, the Viking DeLuxe, the Super Viking and the Viking IIP. The Viking and Viking DeLuxe are fairly similar while the Viking IIP has several differences to allow a lower price.\nIn 2008 Dweezil Zappa joins up with Hagström to recreate the ads and to recreate some of his father's music in the \"Zappa plays Zappa\" tour.\nNotable users\n*Elvis Presley - 68 Comeback Special\n*Frank Zappa - The Mothers of Invention\n*Dweezil Zappa - Zappa plays Zappa\n*Pat Smear - Nirvana, Foo Fighters and the Germs\n*Uno Svenningsson - (Swedish singer/songwriter)\n*Johan Persson - Hovet\n* Tim Armstrong - Rancid (band)\n* Ginger Wildheart - The Wildhearts, Hey!
