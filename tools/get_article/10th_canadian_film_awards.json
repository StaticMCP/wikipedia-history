For this year, more than 140 films were entered, but the roster included no features, which was due to distrust, or lack of interest, on the part of the independent film community--this situation persisted until 1964. Also, as so many had requested, this year's ceremony was a luncheon; its host was Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Chairman Davidson Dunton.\nWinners\n*Film of the Year: City of Gold — National Film Board of Canada, Tom Daly producer, Colin Low and Wolf Koenig directors\n*Feature Film: No entries submitted\n*Theatrical Short: The Sceptre and the Mace — National Film Board of Canada, Nicholas Balla producer, John Howe director\n*Arts and Experimental: Legend of the Raven — Crawley Films, Judith Crawley producer, Peter Cock and Edmund Reid directors\n::A Chairy Tale — National Film Board of Canada, Norman McLaren and Claude Jutra directors\n::City of Gold — National Film Board of Canada, Tom Daly producer, Colin Low and Wolf Koenig directors\n*TV Information: Skidrow — Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Allan King producer and director\n*Films for Children: Le Vagabond et En roulant ma boule — Associated Screen Studios.
