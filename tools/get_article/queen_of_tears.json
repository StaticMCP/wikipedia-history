However, it was moved to the first half of 2024, due to the changes in the network's Saturday–Sunday lineup. According to a Metro Seoul article, the series was rescheduled to air in March 2024. tvN confirmed the news after releasing its 2024 drama lineup. The series premiered on March 9, 2024, at 21:20 (KST). It is also available for streaming on TVING and Netflix.\nReception\nCritical response\nForbes wrote that \"many K-dramas end with 'happily ever after', but Queen of Tears starts that way\", adding that the series \"not only has a solid cast, but boasts a talented screenwriter and two directors with a track record of drama success\". Tanu I. Raj of NME gave the series 4 out of 5 stars and described it as \"a whirlwind office romance\", which is \"buoyant and decidedly comic\". Geoffrey Bunting of Time described the first six episodes of the series as a \"bucks convention, sending up familiar tropes of the genre for a truly unexpected viewing experience\". Pierce Conran of South China Morning Post gave a score of 4/5, and wrote that \"through 16 episodes threaded between tales of family woes, illness and corporate intrigue\" and \"Baek Hyun-woo and Hong Hae-in captured each other's hearts, as well as those of the audience at home\". Joly Herman of Common Sense Media wrote that \"courtesan restraint is definitely not on display in this production, which features dynasty infighting in a current setting with hints of past Korean dramas\". Kate Sánchez of But Why Tho? gave a score of 9/10, and stated that \"sometimes unwieldy but always entertaining\" and \"already leading the pack for best drama of the year\".\nViewership\nAccording to Nielsen Korea, the series recorded a nationwide TV rating of 24.850% for its final episode and became the highest-rated tvN series, surpassing Crash Landing on You.\nQueen of Tears ranked third in Netflix's Global Top 10 TV (Non-English) category two days after its release and received a strong response from twelve countries, with 5.4 million hours watched by 2.6 million viewers in its first week.

On its fourth week, the series topped the chart with 41.4 million hours watched by 4.3 million viewers, and remained on the chart for the next 10 consecutive weeks. Queen of Tears amassed a total of 373.2 million hours during its broadcast run from March 9 to April 28.\nAccording to Netflix's biannual Engagement Report released in September 2024, Queen of Tears was the most-watched Korean drama of all time on Netflix, with 682.6 million hours viewed in total.
