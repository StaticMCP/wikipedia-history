It is the band's eighth full-length original album.\nAlbum information\nThis album marks a return to the standard thrash/punk/noise sound they are known for greatly more so than in previous Dwarves productions, the original sound of the Dwarves shows clearly in several tracks. This album follows a pop collaboration of Blag Dahlia's called \"Candy Now!\", as well as  \"Sunday School Massacre\", a solo album from HeWhoCannotBeNamed. A remake of the song \"Happy Suicide\" from that album appears on \"Born Again\" retitled as \"Happy Birthday Suicide\". Like several previous Dwarves albums, it features the dwarf (Bobby Faust) and naked women attributed to The Dwarves, this time in a pseudo-religious framework.[http://www.punknews.org/review/10207 Punknews.org | The Dwarves - The Dwarves Are Born Again][http://www.crawdaddy.com/index.php/2011/05/03/album-review-the-dwarves-the-dwarves-are-born-again/ Album Review: The Dwarves, The Dwarves Are Born Again][https://web.archive.org/web/20110507015442/http://www.avclub.com/articles/may-2011,55517/ May 2011 | Music | Loud | The A.V.
