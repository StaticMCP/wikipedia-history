The international community rounded on Maduro and condemned polling day violence in which up to 15 people were killed. President Maduro hailed the vote as a \"sublime\" victory for the Venezuelan people, as the Electoral National Council (CNE) said more than eight million people had cast ballots nationwide to give the president increased powers. But the opposition dismissed that figure as fabricated, pointing to reports of empty polling stations and citing anonymous government sources as putting the figure at just under 2.5 million. The United States has already imposed sanctions on several Venezuelan individuals and organisations, but, in taking the rare step of targeting a sitting head of state by name, it signalled growing alarm at the crisis.

The Smartmatic CEO Antonio Mugica said: \"We know, without a doubt, that the result of the recent elections for a National Constituent Assembly were manipulated,\" and added \"We estimate that the difference between actual and announced participation by the authorities is at least one million votes\". Reuters also reported that according to internal CNE documents leaked to the agency, only 3,720,465 votes were cast thirty minutes before polls were expected to close, though polls were open for an additional hour. The president Maduro stood by the official count of more than 8 million votes and said an additional 2 million people would have voted if they had not been blocked by opposition protesters. \"That stupid guy, the president of Smartmatic, pressured to the neck by the gringos and the Britains, said there were 7.5 million [voters]\", Maduro said in televised remarks. \"I think there were 10 million Venezuelans who went out.\"  The CNE principal rector Tibisay Lucena dismissed Mugica's allegations, calling it an \"opinion\" of a company (Smartmatic) that played only a secondary role in the election and had no access to complete data. Julio Borges, the leader of the opposition-held parliament, said voter fraud was \"the most serious crime that can be committed against democracy\". Meanwhile, international pressure mounted on president Maduro as his country and government became increasingly isolated after Federica Mogherini, the European Union's high representative for foreign affairs, said in a statement that the union would not recognise the new constituent assembly due to \"concerns over its effective representativeness and legitimacy\".\n* 3 August - South American bloc Mercosur begins to trigger its democratic clause to suspend Venezuela indefinitely furthering its past temporary suspension and not allowing the country to rejoin until the crisis is resolved.\n* 4 August - Antonio Ledezma was sent back home where he has been placed under house arrest and unable to express himself publicly.
