He was cast in dozens of productions on the New York stage, appeared in more than two dozen television programs, and acted in more than fifty feature films. Adept at both drama and musicals on the stage, he originated the role of Jud Fry in the original 1943 run of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Oklahoma!, and also portrayed the prosecuting attorney in the 1957 stage production of Compulsion. Da Silva was nominated for a 1960 Tony Award as Best Featured Actor in a Musical for his work in Fiorello!, a musical about New York City mayor LaGuardia. In 1961, da Silva directed Purlie Victorious, by Ossie Davis.\nMany of his early feature films were of the noir genre in which he often played villains, such as Eddie Harwood in The Blue Dahlia and the sadistic Captain Francis Thompson in Two Years Before the Mast (both 1946). Da Silva's performances as historic figures are among some of his most notable work: he was Lincoln's brawling friend Jack Armstrong in both play (1939) and film (1940) versions of Abe Lincoln in Illinois written by Robert Sherwood; Benjamin Franklin in the 1969–1972 stage musical 1776 and a reprisal of the role for the 1972 film version of the production; Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in The Missiles of October (1974); Franklin D. Roosevelt in The Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover (1977); and Louis B. Mayer in Mommie Dearest (1981).\nDa Silva's American television character work included the defense attorney representing the robot in The Outer Limits episode \"I, Robot\" (1964), and district attorney Anthony Cleese in For the People (1965). For his performance as Eddie in the Great Performances production of Verna: USO Girl (1978), the actor received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performance by a Supporting Actor in a Comedy or Drama Special.\nIn the 1970s, da Silva appeared in 26 episodes of the radio series the CBS Radio Mystery Theater.\nEarly life\nDa Silva was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Bertha (née Sen) and Benjamin Silverblatt, a dress cutter. His parents were both immigrants, Yiddish-speaking Jews born in the Russian Empire. His mother was a women's-rights activist. Before beginning his acting career on the stage, he was employed as a steelworker.\nDa Silva was a graduate of the Carnegie Institute of Technology. He studied acting with Eva Le Gallienne beginning in 1928 at the Civic Repertory Theatre. He changed his surname for acting purposes, adopting the Portuguese Da Silva (his name is sometimes misspelled Howard De Silva).\nCareer\n, Howard Da Silva and Olive Stanton in the Mercury Theatre production of The Cradle Will Rock (1938)]]\nDa Silva appeared in a number of Broadway musicals, including the role of Larry Foreman in the legendary first production of Marc Blitzstein's musical The Cradle Will Rock (1938). Later, he costarred in the original 1943 stage production of Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma!, playing the role of the psychopathic Jud Fry. He was the easygoing Ben Marino who opposed Tammany Hall in the Pulitzer winning musical Fiorello!.\nwith Richard Nixon following a performance of the Tony Award-winning musical in the East Room of the White House (1971)]]\nIn 1969, da Silva originated the role of Benjamin Franklin in the musical 1776''. Four days before the show opened on Broadway, he suffered a minor heart attack but refused to seek medical assistance because he wanted to make sure critics saw his performance. After the four official critic performances were over, the cast left to go to the cast party and da Silva went to the hospital and immediately took a leave of absence from the production. While da Silva recuperated, his understudy, Rex Everhart, took over the role and performed on the cast recording. Da Silva was able to reprise his role in the 1972 film version and appeared on that soundtrack album.\nDa Silva did summer stock at the Pine Brook Country Club, located in the countryside of Nichols, Connecticut, with the Group Theatre (New York) formed by Harold Clurman, Cheryl Crawford and Lee Strasberg in the 1930s and early 1940s.\nDa Silva appeared in over 60 motion pictures. Some of his memorable roles include a leading mutineer in The Sea Wolf (1941), Ray Milland's bartender in The Lost Weekend (1945), and the half-blind criminal \"Chicamaw 'One-Eye' Mobley\" in They Live by Night (1949). He also released an album on Monitor Records (MP 595) of political songs and ballads entitled Politics and Poker.\nDa Silva returned to the stage, and he was nominated for the 1960 Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical for his role as \"Ben Marino\" in Fiorello! (1959). After being blacklisted, da Silva and Nelson left Los Angeles for New York to perform in The World of Sholom Aleichem.\nDa Silva was nominated for the British BAFTA Film Award for Best Foreign Actor for his performance as Dr. Swinford in David and Lisa (1962). Da Silva portrayed Soviet Premier Khrushchev in the television docudrama The Missiles of October (1974). He won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Performance by a Supporting Actor in a Comedy or Drama Special for his role as Eddie in Verna: U.S.O. Girl (1978) with Sissy Spacek.\nDa Silva's TV guest appearances, after the era in which blacklisting was strongest, include such programs as The Outer Limits, Ben Casey, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., The Fugitive, Gentle Ben, Mannix, Love, American Style, Kung Fu, and ''Archie Bunker's Place.\nDa Silva also played President Franklin D. Roosevelt in The Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover (1977), Hollywood mogul Louis B. Mayer in Mommie Dearest (1981), and American statesman Benjamin Franklin in both 1776'' (1972) and a documentary depicting the life of Ben Franklin shown at Franklin's house in Philadelphia, as well as in a television commercial for Consolidated Edison. He appeared in two different film adaptations of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel, The Great Gatsby. In the 1949 production with Alan Ladd as Gatsby, da Silva played garage owner George Wilson; in the 1974 film with Robert Redford, da Silva was Meyer Wolfsheim, the flamboyant gambler with the interesting cufflinks. In his final appearance on screen, da Silva played a New York photographer fascinated with the reclusive Greta Garbo in the film Garbo Talks (1984), directed by Sidney Lumet.\nHe also did voice acting in 26 episodes of the popular 1974–82 radio thriller series CBS Radio Mystery Theater (between July 1974 and February 1977). In 1978, he recorded linking narration for episodes of the British television program Doctor Who broadcast in the United States.\nBlacklisting\nDa Silva became one of hundreds of artists blacklisted in the entertainment industry during the House Committee on Unamerican Activities investigation into alleged Communist influence in the industry. Following his March 1951 testimony, in which he repeatedly invoked his Fifth Amendment rights, his lead performance in the completed feature film Slaughter Trail was re-shot with actor Brian Donlevy.  Da Silva continued to find work on the New York stage, but did not work in feature films again until 1961 when he appeared in David and Lisa (a BAFTA-nominated performance). He was eventually cleared of any charges in 1960, but not before his career in television had also stalled, with no work between 1951 and 1959 when he appeared in The Play of the Week. The brief respite was followed by another television career void until his appearance in a 1963 episode of The Defenders. That was the beginning of the end of da Silva's blacklist, and the show's producer Herb Brodkin paired da Silva with William Shatner when he created the television series For the People.\nPersonal life and death\nDa Silva's first wife was Evelyn Horowitz. They were married on August 13, 1930, in Manhattan, New York City.\nHis second wife was stage actress Jane Louise Taylor, born in 1913 in New York. They were married in January 1941 in Yuma, Arizona, and had one son. They were divorced on July 28, 1948, in Los Angeles, California.\nHis third wife was actress Marjorie Nelson; they were married on August 19, 1950, in Hollywood, California. Da Silva and Nelson had two daughters and were divorced on May 9, 1961, in Juárez, Mexico.\nHis fourth wife was Nancy Nutter; they were married in May or June 1961 in Greenwich, England.\nDa Silva died of lymphoma, aged 76, in Ossining, New York.\nActing credits\nStage\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Opening date\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Closing date\n! scope=\"col\"|Title\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Role\n! scope=\"col\"|Theatre\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Notes\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Refs\n|-\n| scope=\"row\"|Apr 21, 1930\n|May 1930\n|Romeo and Juliet\n|Apothecary\n|Civic Repertory Theatre\n|\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\"| Oct 6, 1930\n| unknown\n|\n|Scaevola\n|Civic Repertory Theatre\n|Written in 1899 by Arthur Schnitzler as Der grüne Kakadu\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\"|Oct 6, 1930\n|Nov 1930\n|Romeo and Juliet\n|Apothecary\n|Civic Repertory Theatre\n|\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\"| Oct 20, 1930\n|Nov 1930\n|Siegfried\n|Mr. Patchkoffer, Schumann\n|Civic Repertory Theatre\n|Written by Jean Giraudoux; adaptation by Philip Carr\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\"| Dec 1, 1930\n|Jan 1931\n|''Alison's House\n|Hodges\n|Civic Repertory Theatre\n|Written by Susan Glaspell\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\"| Jan 26, 1931\n|Mar 1931\n|\n|Guest\n|Civic Repertory Theatre\n|Written by Alexandre Dumas, fils; translation by Henriette Metcalf\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\"| May 11, 1931\n|May 31, 1931\n|Alison's House\n|Hodges\n|Ritz Theatre\n|Written by Susan Glaspell\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\"| Oct 26, 1932\n|Oct 1932\n|Liliom\n|Wolf Beifeld\n|Civic Repertory Theatre\n|Written by Ferenc Molnár; adaptation by Benjamin Glazer\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\"| Nov 14, 1932\n|Nov 1932\n|Dear Jane\n|Dr. Samuel Johnson\n|Civic Repertory Theatre\n|Written by Eleanor Holmes Hinkley\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\"| Dec 12, 1932\n|Dec 1933\n|Alice in Wonderland\n|Cook, White Knight\n|Civic Repertory Theatre\n|Based on the Lewis Carroll books; written by Florida Friebus and Eva Le Gallienne\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\"| March 6, 1933\n|April 1933\n|\n|Stationmaster\n|New Amsterdam Theatre\n|Written by Anton Chekhov; translation by Constance Garnett\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\"| Dec 10, 1934\n|Mar 1935\n|Sailors of Cattaro\n|Sepp Kriz\n|Civic Repertory Theatre\n|From the 1930 German work Die Matrosen von Cattaro by Friedrich Wolf; translation by Keen Wallis; adaptation by Michael Blankfort\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\"| Mar 20, 1935\n|June 1935\n|Black Pitt\n|Hansy McCulloh\n|Civic Repertory Theatre\n|Written by Albert Maltz\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\"| Nov 4, 1937\n|June 1938\n|Golden Boy\n|Lewis\n|Belasco Theatre\n|Written by Clifford Odets\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\"| Jan 3, 1938\n|April 1938\n|\n|Larry Foreman\n|Windsor Theatre\n|Written by Marc Blitzstein\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\"|Feb 19, 1938\n|May 1938\n|Casey Jones\n|Old Man\n|Fulton Theatre\n|Written by Robert Ardrey\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\"|Oct 15, 1938\n|Dec 1939\n|Abe Lincoln in Illinois\n|Jack Armstrong\n|Plymouth Theatre\n|Written by Robert E.
