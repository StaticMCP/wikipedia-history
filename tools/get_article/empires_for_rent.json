It was published by Blue Panther Enterprises.\nHistory and development\nEmpires for Rent was a closed-ended wargame published by Blue Panther Enterprises. It was a strategic space-based game for twelve players. It was based on the publisher's earlier game Destiny. Flagship removed Empires for Rent from their PBM game listing in their January 1993 issue.\nGameplay\nPlayers vied for control of the \"Zeta Sector\" in a space setting. This involved conquest, expansion, and a wise investment. Combat, economics and diplomacy were key elements of gameplay. Individual victory came from majority ownership of \"total Production of the Zeta Cluster for two turns\", while an alliance could also score a victory.\nReception\nStewart Wieck reviewed the game in the June–July 1990 issue of White Wolf. He rated it 3 points out of 5 for Moderation, 4 points for Materials, Strategy, and Diplomacy, and 4 points for an overall rating. Marc Macagnone reviewed the game in the January–February 1991 issue of Paper Mayhem. He rated it 4 of 5 points for Complexity, Game Play, and Price, while rating the Rules, Result Sheets, Map Display, and All Around Enjoyment at 5 points. His overall rating was 4.75 stars. Eric Haddock reviewed the game in the January–February 1991 issue of Challenge, stating \"I would recommend this game for its strongest attribute: extreme ease of play.\"\nSee also\n* List of play-by-mail games\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*"
