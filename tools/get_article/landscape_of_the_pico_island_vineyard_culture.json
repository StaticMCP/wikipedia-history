The landscape is known for the network of basalt stone walls and vines planted in rectangular enclosures known as currais. Wine has been produced in the area since the late 15th century, and traditional techniques continue to be used.\nBackground\nInscribed as a UNESCO site in 2004, the site covers an area of approximately 987 ha, and the surrounding buffer zone with 1,924 ha, extend through most of the island's western, northwestern and southwestern coasts, with the majority on the municipality of Madalena and the rest on São Roque do Pico, at the foothills of Mount Pico.\nThe landscape is characterized by an extensive network of long, spaced apart black basalt stone walls that run parallel to the coast and penetrate towards the interior of the island. These walls were erected to protect the vines from the wind and the salty sea spray, which are planted in thousands of small rectangular enclosures locally called currais. Also part of the landscape are the buildings (manor houses, wine cellars, warehouses, conventional houses, and churches), pathways and wells, ports and ramps, that were produced by generations of farmers enabling the production of wine. Viticulture on Pico began in the late 15th century, introduced by Portuguese settlers—including Franciscan and Carmelite monks—who adapted to the island’s harsh volcanic terrain. By the 19th century, Pico’s wines, especially the Verdelho variety, gained international renown. This landscape has evolved over 500 years and is exceptionally well-preserved and fully authentic in its setting, materials, continued use, function, traditions, techniques, and management systems.\nThe Landscape of the Pico Island Vineyard Culture Interpretation Centre, dedicated to teaching more about the culture and history of the region, is located in the village of Lajido de Santa Luzia.\nGallery\nCenturies Old Vineyards (14762533930).jpg\nPaisagem da Cultura da Vinha da Ilha do Pico - Ilha do Pico, Portugal.jpg\nFile:Pico Island Vineyard 3.jpg|Typical protective walls and winery's house from basalt stones in the west of the island of Pico\nFile:Pico Island Vineyard 4.jpg|Vines planted on basaltic ground near Madalena, Pico Island, Azores.\nFile:Pico Island White Wine Selection.jpg|Wines from Pico Island\nAçores 2010-07-21 (5123362725).jpg\nFile:Pico Island Vineyard 1.jpg|A vinery and the walls around\nSee also\n* Pico IPR, the officially demarcated wine region of Pico.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110128030356/http://www.igespar.pt/en/patrimonio/mundial/portugal/122/ IGESPAR Landscape of the Pico Island Vineyard Culture]\n* [https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/landscape-of-the-pico-island-vineyard-culture/AQIy6w9uq3BzKQ Explore the Landscape of the Pico Island Vineyard Culture in the UNESCO collection on Google Arts and Culture]"
