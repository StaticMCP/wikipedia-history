The population was 1,335 at the 2020 census. It is included in the Michigan City, Indiana-La Porte, Indiana Metropolitan Statistical Area. Also known as \"Victory City,\" the town was built by the United States government for workers that worked in the Kingsbury Ordnance Plant, an ammunitions plant that served the US during World War II and later the Korean War.\nHistory\nDuring World War I, the U.S. east coast munitions plants faced devastating accidents and sabotage, prompting grave concerns among military planners in the late 1930s. To mitigate these risks and expand output, establishing inland facilities became a priority. In line with this strategy, the Kingsbury Ordnance Plant was established in 1940, playing a crucial role in the effort.\nOne of the primary challenges was accommodating the anticipated 10,000 workers and their families, considering LaPorte County's total population was only 16,000 in 1940. Federal planners responded by creating an entire village near the plant, originally named Victory City, which later became Kingsford Heights in 1942.\nThe original plans for Kingsford Heights included 3000 homes, along with several businesses, civic buildings, schools, a community center, and a park. However, with the conclusion of World War II and soon after, the Korean War, the development of Kingsford Heights ceased as the ordnance plant closed, and many workers relocated for new job opportunities.\nDespite the halt in development, the remaining residents purchased the land from the government and incorporated the town to sustain local services. They also opted to rename the town from Victory City to Kingsford Heights.\nKingsford Heights bears resemblance to other Federal projects like Penderlea Homesteads in North Carolina and to a lesser degree, Greenbelt, Maryland; Greendale, Wisconsin; and Greenhills, Ohio. While these projects often featured multi-family units, Kingsford Heights primarily consisted of single houses. The planning aspect of Kingsford Heights remains highly significant, reflected in the inclusion of the entire community within its boundary, even encompassing lots without houses.\nGeography\nAccording to the 2010 census, Kingsford Heights has a total area of , all land.\nDemographics\n2010 census\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 1,435 people, 509 households, and 374 families living in the town.
