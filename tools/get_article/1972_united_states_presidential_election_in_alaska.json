Voters chose three representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nAlaska was won by incumbent President Richard Nixon (R-California) with 58.1% of the popular vote against  George McGovern (D-South Dakota) with 34.6%. Nixon ultimately won the national vote as well, defeating McGovern and Representative John G. Schmitz (R-California), who ran under the American Independent Party ticket.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1972 United States presidential election in Alaska\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f33; width:3px;\"|\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Republican\n| Richard Nixon (incumbent)\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 55,349\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 58.10%\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 3\n|-\n! style=\"background:#33f; width:3px;\"|\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic\n| George McGovern\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 32,967\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 34.61%\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 0\n|-\n! style=\"background:#a54cba; width:3px;\"|\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | American Independent\n| John G.

Johnson in 1964, during the state's first four presidential elections Alaska was not substantially more Republican than the nation at-large: indeed owing to a fairly strong third-party campaign Nixon won 2.57 percent less of the vote in Alaska than over the entire country, although McGovern received 2.88 percent less than his national share.\nWhile Alaska would prove to be John Schmitz's second strongest state after Idaho, he failed to equal the success of George Wallace’s campaign in the previous election. This is the only time that Alaska voted to the left of Hawaii.\nSee also\n*United States presidential elections in Alaska\nReferences"
