The Alpini were supported by the Mountain Artillery, which both share the Cappello Alpino as identifying symbol. Below follow tables listing the regiments, battalions and groups, companies and batteries of the Alpini and Mountain Artillery active in World War I.\nAlpini\nHistory\nThe Alpini were founded in 1872 and their mission was to protect Italy's northern mountain border with France and Austria-Hungary. Recruited locally in the valleys of the Alps they were the trained in mountain warfare and based in locations along the Alpine arch. The regiments were numbered 1 to 8 from West to East and the regular battalions named for the locations of their depots, which served as training centers and for materiel storage. These were organized in standard TO&E of:\n* Regimental HQ\n* Three mountain infantry battalions\n* Support elements assigned to HQ\n* Depot elements\nAfter the raising of the Belluno battalion on 1 October 1910 the Alpini numbered 79 companies organized in 26 battalions. Each battalion, with the exception of the Verona, consisted of three Alpini companies of one captain, four lieutenants and 250 other ranks. The Verona was the only battalion to field four companies.\nAfter the outbreak of World War I in 1914 an additional 38 Alpini companies, numbered from 80 to 117, were raised from men, who had completed their military service in the preceding four years (i.e. completed it between 1910 and 1914). These companies were used to augment the regular battalions. Starting in early January 1915 each Alpini battalion activated a reserve battalion. Named after a valley (in Italian: Val or Valle) located near the regular battalion's depot, these Valle battalions were filled with men, who had completed their military service at least four years, but not more than 11 years earlier (i.e. completed it between 1911 and 1904). The companies of the Valle battalions were numbered from 201 to 281, with the numbers 227, 233, 237, 271, and 273 never assigned to a company (227th originally meant for the Val Pellice, but the battalion received the 224th Company instead; 233rd originally meant for the Val Dora, but the battalion received the 3rd Company instead; 271st originally meant for the Val Fella, but the battalion received the 8th Company instead).\nAfter the Italian declaration of war against Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915 the Alpini were heavily employed in the mountainous areas of the Italian front. At the end of 1915 the depots began to raise new battalions with drafted men born in 1896. These battalions were named after mountains (in Italian: Monte) located near the regular battalion's depots and they received the 38 companies already raised in 1914. The new companies of these battalions were numbered from 118 to 157. One additional Monte company (158th for the Fenestrelle battalion), and the Monte Mandrone battalion (159th, 160th, 161st company) were raised later (see 5th Alpini Regiment for details about the Monte Mandrone).\nAll in all the regiments of Alpini mountain infantry had during the First World War organized into between 9 and 14 battalions (3 regular and 6 to 12 reserve), operationally assigned to regiment-sized Groups (Gruppo), each Group attached to brigade-sized Groupings (Raggruppamento) with operational HQ and support elements.\nMachine Gunner Companies\n.]]\nAt the outbreak of war each infantry and Bersaglieri battalion of the Italian Army fielded one machine gun section with two Maxim 1911 machine guns carried by horses. Alpini battalions fielded two machine gun sections with two Maxim 1911 machine guns carried by mules. After the outbreak of the war this proved quickly to be inadequate and in spring 1916 the army began to raise dedicated machine gunner companies (Compagnia Mitraglieri). These companies were attached to brigades, divisions and army corps, which deployed them with tactical units (regiments, battalions, companies) as needed. 2,277 Machine Gunner companies were raised and numbered continuously. The Alpini depots raised 50 companies equipped with six Hotchkiss M1909 Benét–Mercié machine gunmachine guns each, and 119 companies equipped with six Fiat–Revelli Modello 1914 machine guns each.\nThe St. Étienne Mle 1907 equipped machine gunner companies were the: 78th, 79th, 87th, 89th, 91st, 92nd, 116th, 117th, 121st, 133rd, 141st, 143rd, 166th, 167th, 176th, 190th, 191st, 192nd, 350th, 416th, 417th, 441st, 442nd, 456th, 467th, 491st, 492nd, 2021st, 2057th, 2101st, 2191st, 2207th, 2227th, 2230th, 2231st, 2232nd, 2233rd, 234th, 2235th, 2236th, 2237th, 2238th, 2260th, 2262nd, 2265th, 2266th, 2268th, 2284th, 2275th, and 2276th.\nThe Hotchkiss M1909 Benét–Mercié machine gun equipped machine gunner companies were the: 201st, 202nd, 215th, 218th, 219th, 257th, 296th, 316th, 337th,347th, 348th, 503rd, 504th, 505th, 506th, 507th, 508th, 509th, 526th, 527th, 557th, 558th, 559th, 560th, 617th, 625th, 636th, 637th, 638th, 639th, 652nd, 661st, 662nd, 663rd, 664th, 665th, 670th, 671st, 691st, 692nd, 693rd, 694th, 695th, 741st, 742nd, 745th, 799th, 817th, 819th, 820th, 821st, 880th, 890th, 891st, 932nd, 933rd, 934th, 935th, 936th, 938th, 979th, 980th, 981st, 982nd, 983rd, 1259th, 1260th, 1261st, 1284th, 1337th, 1351st, 1355th, 1356th, 1357th, 1358th, 1359th, 1374th, 1380th, 1388th, 1397th, 1411th, 1451st, 1452nd, 1457th, 1559th, 1560th, 1602nd, 1603rd, 1604th, 1620th, 1621st, 1622nd, 1634th, 1635th, 1636th, 1637th, 1638th, 1734th, 1740th, 1741st, 1742nd, 1743rd, 1744th, 1747th, 1771st, 1772nd, 1773rd, 1774th, 1775th, 1776th, 1777th, 1778th, 1779th, 1801st, 1802nd, 1830th, 1831st, 1832nd, 1833rd, and 1834th.\nSkiers Battalions\nglacier.]]\nDuring the war each Alpini battalion raised a skiers platoon from its ranks. Starting on 9 January 1917 the army began to combine these platoons in twelve skiers battalions (Battaglione Sciatori) of two companies and one train unit each. Each company had 18 dog sleds: six configured to carry wounded and twelve to carry the company's six Villar Perosa submachine guns with their ammunition. Each company also fielded a machine gun section with two Fiat–Revelli Modello 1914 machine guns. Until the end of March 1917 twelve battalions and two autonomous companies had been formed and numbered from West to East. However already on 15 May of the same year ten of the battalions were disbanded or their men used to form seven regular Alpini battalions. Only the I and II Skiers battalion continued to serve on the glaciers of the Adamello-Presanella Alps and Ortler Alps. Ultimately both battalions were reformed as Alpini battalions in spring 1918. Until the end of the war a total of nine battalions were raised with men and companies of the former skiers battalions and their companies were numbered:\n* from 282 to 286 for newly raised companies\n* from 290 to 311 for former skiers companies\nThe numbers 287, 288, 289 were not assigned. As an example: on 15 May 1917 the two newly raised 282nd and 283rd companies were combined with the 302nd company, which contained the remaining men of the V Skiers Battalion to form the Pallanza Alpini Battalion. The battalions were assigned to higher commands as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Army !! Battalion !! Company !!

Their officers were used to create regiment-sized Groups (Gruppo), which numbered twenty by the war's end (1° to 20°) and brigade-sized Groupings (Raggruppamento), which numbered nine by war's end (I to IX). These had HQ and support elements under them and were responsible for the battalions. For larger operations divisional commands were assigned groupings and the necessary support units, however these divisions were not part of the Alpini corps. By war's end the 52nd and 80th divisional commands had at one point or the other commanded two Alpini groupings, while the 5th and 75th divisional commands, which were tasked with static defense in the Giudicarie and Bergamasque Alps fielded almost exclusively Alpini Groupings.\nAs an example for the operational deployment of the Alpini below follows the order of battle of the 52nd Division for the assault on Monte Ortigara on 10 June 1917.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"align: center; background: lavender;\" colspan=\"3\" | 52nd Division\n|-\n!

The Edolo battalion served for the entire war in the Adamello range and adjacent Tonale Pass area.\nIn spring 1915 the regiment's Morbegno Depot formed the 1st Alpini Volunteers Company, while in Milan volunteers formed the 2nd Alpini Volunteers Company. The two companies were merged in October 1915 as 1st Volunteer Unit (Reparto Volontari) and fought in the Ortler area until March 1918 when the company was renamed 3rd Alpini Company and assigned to the Mondovì Battalion. The 3rd Company was originally part of the Pieve di Teco battalion, until battalion and company were disbanded after suffering heavy losses. The company was then reformed and assigned to the Val Dora battalion, until battalion company were disbanded after suffering heavy losses in the Battle of Caporetto.\nAlso in spring 1915 the Edolo Depot formed the 3rd Alpini Volunteers Company Val Camonica, which served in the Tonale-Adamello area until June 1918 when it was assigned as 311th Alpini Company to the Alpini Battalion Monte Cavento. In Brescia a large number of volunteers formed another Volunteer Unit, which after training at the Vestone Depot was known as the Volunteer Unit Vestone. The unit was attached to the Vestone battalion and served in the Lake Garda area until August 1916 when it was merged into the 1st Volunteer Unit.\nIn August 1915 the 5th Alpini Regiment organized the Autonomous Company Garibaldi, which was tasked to garrison the area around the mountain hut of the same name in the Adamello range. On 20 April 1916 the company was elevated to Autonomous Battalion Garibaldi and staffed with Alpini soldiers of the 5th Alpini Regiment.

The Alpini units along the Isonzo front and in the Carnic Alps and Dolomites were badly mauled and 20 Alpini battalions had to be disbanded at the end of the battle. A further seven were disbanded two months later to bring the remaining battalions back up to strength. Worst hit was the 8th Alpini Regiment, whose units were all deployed in the Julian and Carnic Alps and had to retrat the farthest. Seven of its ten battalions had to be disbanded, and as the regiment's depots were all overrun by German and Austro-Hungarian troops it could not replenish its ranks.

Diaz reorganized the army and ordered the Alpini groups to be formed into permanent formations of three Alpini battalions, each battalion with its own machine gunner company, one mountain artillery group, two autonomous machine gunner companies, and a \"reparto cannoncini d'accompagnamento\" (loosely translated: small accompaniment cannons unit), with Italian copies of the Austrian 3.7cm Infantry Gun M.15.\nLikewise the Alpini groupings became permanent formations of two Alpini groups and one mountain artillery grouping, with two mountain artillery groups each. The Alpini groupings were combined in four divisions: the 5th and 75th static and tasked with the defense of front sectors in Western part of the theater, and the 52nd mobile and able to be deployed along the front as needed.\nIII Army Corps\nThe III Army Corps was one of two army corps of the 7th Army, which held the front from Stelvio Pass to the Western shore of Lake Garda. The III Army Corps held the northern part of the front from the Stelvio to Monte Listino, while the XIV Army Corps held the front from Monte Listino to Lake Garda. The XIV Army Corps consisted in 1918 of the 6th, 20th, 21st, and 22nd divisions.\n5th Alpine Division\nFormed on 24 May 1915 at the outbreak of war the 5th Alpine Division was formed initially by the infantry brigades Palermo and Cuneo, and the 27th Field Artillery Regiment. From its inception until the formation of the 75th Alpine Division the 5th Alpine Division garrisoned the front from the Swiss border through the Ortler Group to Tonale Pass and then through the Adamello Group to the Val Camonica. With the reorganization of the Alpini corps in 1918 the division ceded the III and V Alpini groups to the newly formed 75th Alpine Division and received the VII Alpini Group. For the rest of the war it focused on garrison the front from Gavia Pass to the Tonale pass and then through the Adamello Group and the Northern end of the Val Camonica.\nAfter the Battle of Vittorio Veneto and the following Austro-Hungarian retreat the units of the division advance from Tonale Pass into the Val di Sole on 3 November 1918. They reach Malè and Cles, while a detachment occupies the Mendel Pass overlooking Bolzano, before the Armistice of Villa Giusti comes into effect at 3pm on 4 November.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

From June to November the division patrolled the front in the upper Valtellina valley: from the Swiss border to Gavia Pass. For the last Italian offensive at Vittorio Veneto the division ceded on 15 October 1918 the command of the V Grouping and the 15th Group to the XXVII Army Corps. The grouping received the 18th Alpini Group and together the units crossed the Piave river near Vidor on 31 October 1918. While the 18th Group fought its way up the Piave valley towards Mel, the 15th covered the right flank and positioned itself around Valdobbiadene.\nMeanwhile back in Valtellina on 3 November 1918 the III Grouping attacked Monte Scorluzzo and Monte Cristallo, the two mountains flanking the Stelvio Pass, and after three years of futile attempts finally managed to dislodge the few remaining Austrian defenders from the pass. By morning of 4 November the battalions of the III Grouping had descended from the pass and reached Prad am Stilfser Joch, Schluderns and the train station at Spondinig, thus cutting railway and road through the Vinschgau valley and with it the route of escape of Austria-Hungary's fleeing troops.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

On 17 March of the same year the two infantry brigades were replaced by the 1st, 2nd, 8th, and 9th Alpini Group. Over the course of the year the division received infantry and Bersaglieri units for month long stints in the front line trenches, but its core units remained Alpini groups. After the Battle of Mount Ortigara the 2nd Alpini Group was replaced by the 3rd Group on 9 July and on 20 July 1917 the I Alpini Grouping (1st, 3rd Group) and IV Alpini Grouping (8th, 9th Group) were formally activated.\nAfter various changes due to the Italian retreat after the Battle of Caporetto and the reorganization of the Alpini corps, the division assumed its final organization on 6 March 1918:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Assigned to the XXX Army Corps for the last Italian offensive at Vittorio Veneto the division was deployed on the Monte Grappa massiv and tasked to conquer Col dell'Orso, Monte Casonet, Monte Fontanasecca and Monte Solarolo. Attacking on 24 October 1918 the division sustained heavy casualties and failed to meet its objectives until 31 October when the Austro-Hungarian forces began to retreat along the entire front. Until then the VIII Grouping alone had lost 88 officers and 3042 troops – nearly half its starting strength. The enemy's retreat allowed the battalions to advance and take the division's objectives and continue onward to the city of Feltre.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Division !! Grouping !! Group !!

Additionally each group stored the material for a fourth battery. The 1st Mountain Artillery Regiment was based in the West of Northern Italy and tasked to support the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Alpini regiments, while the 2nd Mountain Artillery Regiment was based in the East of Northern Italy and tasked to support the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th Alpini regiments. With the rising of tensions the army began to expand the mountain artillery and on 1 February 1915 the 3rd Mountain Artillery Regiment was raised in Bergamo. It received the mountain artillery groups Oneglia and Bergamo from the other two regiments and was tasked to support the 1st and 4th Alpini Regiment. At the same time the 36th Field Artillery Regiment began to raise two additional mountain artillery groups.\nAfter the outbreak of World War I in July 1914 an additional 11 mountain artillery batteries, numbered from 51 to 65, were raised from men, who had completed their military service in the preceding four years (i.e. completed it between 1910 and 1914). Each group of the mountain artillery regiments was supposed receive one of these batteries, however for lack of cannons the 53rd, 56th, 60th, and 62nd batteries were not raised until November 1916. Three of these batteries were raised by the 36th Field Artillery Regiment to create the XIV Mountain Artillery Group, the first of 53 mountain artillery batteries raised for the war.\nAdditionally seven batteries equipped with 70/15 cannons were part of the mountain artillery, with six of these deployed in the Italian colonies (41st, 42nd, 43rd in Libya) and one attached to 1st Army. The latter of these batteries was designated 4th Special Battery, while the other six were numbered 41st to 46th.\nAt the end of 1916 the mountain artillery had grown to 25 groups (I to XXIV, and XXVIII) with 82 batteries, which were numbered from 1 to 81, as the 4th Special Battery was not included in the sequential numbering of mountain artillery batteries. The mountain artillery continued to suffer from a lack of materiel as the army preferred to raise \"batterie someggiatti\" (loosely translated: pack animal carrying batteries) with the available 65/17 mod. 13 cannons. A mountain artillery battery required 195 horses and mules compared to 137 for a \"batteria someggiatta\" and therefore the army directed the available cannons to field artillery regiments tasked with raising of the latter type of batteries. In first year of the war 66 \"batterie someggiatti\" were raised compared to 25 mountain artillery batteries.\nIn 1917 the mountain artillery added a further six groups (XXV to XXVII, XXIX to XXXI) and 18 batteries for a new total of 31 groups and 100 batteries with 379 65/17 mod. 13 cannons. The size of the mountain artillery doubled in size in early 1918 when all the remaining 84 \"batterie someggiatti\" and associated groups were reformed as mountain artillery batteries.\nOperational Deployment\nMountain artillery batteries were initially often deployed alone or in twos. As the war progressed the mountain artillery groups were deployed in regiment-sized Groupings (Raggruppamento Artiglieria da Montagna), which numbered twelve by the war's end (1° to 12°). From early 1918 onward each Alpini group received a mountain artillery group, while each Alpini grouping received a mountain artillery grouping with two mountains artillery groups. Thus 38 mountain artillery groups were permanently assigned to Alpini groups and groupings, with the remaining groups assigned to divisions and army corps.\n1st Mountain Artillery Regiment\nThe 1st Mountain Artillery Regiment was based in Turin and recruited in Piedmont and the Aosta Valley. Three of the regiment's four groups were based in Turin – a fact reflected in the names of the groups, which combined the Italian name of the city \"Torino\" with the names of the Alpini battalions they were assigned to support. Only the Mondovì Group was based outside Turin. Until 1 February 1915 the regiment also included the depot in Oneglia with the Mountain Artillery Group \"Oneglia\", which both were transferred on that date to the newly formed 3rd Mountain Artillery Regiment.\nDuring the war the regiment's depots raised and trained the commands of nine mountain artillery groupings (Raggruppamento Artiglieria Montagna), the commands of 17 mountain artillery groups (Gruppo Artiglieria Montagna), and 37 mountain artillery batteries, which were each equipped with four 65/17 mod. 13 cannons. Furthermore, two commands of siege groups (''Gruppo d'Assedio''), and 14 siege batteries were raised and trained by the regiment.\n* The regiment raised the following mountain artillery groupings: 1°, 2°, 3°, 4°, 5°, 9°, 10°, 11°, and 12°.\n* The regiment raised the following mountain artillery groups: XV (66th, 67th, 68th bty.), XIX (14th, 51st, 55th bty.), XXII (47th, 48th, 49th bty.), XXV (82nd, 83rd, 84th bty.), XXIX (91st, 92nd, 93rd bty.), XXXIII, XXXIV, XXXV, XXXVII, XXXVIII, XXXIX, XLIII, XLIV, LII, LVIII, LXII, and LXV.\nDuring the war the regiment's groups fought:\n* in 1915 in the battles of Col di Lana, Monte Sief, Valsugana, Monte Nero, Monte Javorcek, and Coston del Mrzli\n* in 1916 in the battles of Col di Lana, Monte Sief, Monte Cauriol, Monte Cardinal, Busa Alta, Monte Pasubio, Monte Corno, Monte Sleme, and Monte Mrzli\n* in 1917 in the battles of Liga, Brodez, Monte Zebio, Bainsizza, Spinoncia, Monte Asolone, Colle dell'Orso, Monte Solarolo, Monte Pasubio, Monte Cucco, and Monte Vodice\n* in 1918 in the battles of Spinoncia, Monte Solarolo, Archeson, Conca di Schiavino, Monte Grappa, Monte Valderoa, Conca di Feltre, Passo del Monticello, and Passo Tonale\nAt the outbreak of war the mountain artillery groups lost their names and were numbered with Roman numerals instead.
