      "text": "# Draft:Chilai Howard\n\n\" is an example of both lazy wiring and a total misunderstanding of referencing.\nFirst, the lazy writing: This is a list of stuff, almost none of which Wikipedia cares about. What it cares about is a summary, in your own words of what references whcih pass WP:42 say about Howard\nThen the misunderstanding. For a living person we have a high standard of referencing. Every substantive fact you assert, especially one that is susceptible to potential challenge, requires a citation with a reference that is about them, and is independent of them,  in multiple secondary sources which are WP:RS, and is significant coverage. Please also see WP:PRIMARY which details the limited permitted usage of primary sources and WP:SELFPUB which has clear limitations on self published sources. Providing sufficient references, ideally one per fact cited, that meet these tough criteria is likely to make this draft a clear acceptance (0.9 probability). Lack of them or an inability to find them is likely to mean that the person is not suitable for inclusion, certainly today.\nThe great majority of your references are not of that calibre|ts=20250323201328}}\n----\nChilai Howard () is a Hong Kong interdisciplinary artist and designer, graduated at the Critical Intermedia Laboratory, School of Creative Media, CityU HK.. and HKUST, who experiments the possibility of mediums creating atmosphere that explores humans’ subconscious mind, behaviours and physical interactivity.\nHis experimental video art , moving images, mixed-media and interactive installations  have been exhibited internationally in Tate Modern London , ZKM Media Museum Karlsruhe , Museum of Contemporary Art Taipei , Arad Museum , National Centre for Contemporary Arts , Saint Petersburg and Kuandu Museum of Fine Arts .
