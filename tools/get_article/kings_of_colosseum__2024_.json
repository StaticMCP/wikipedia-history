It took place on January 6, 2024, at the 2300 Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and streamed live on Triller TV (formally known as FITE). It was the fourth event under the Kings of Colosseum chronology.\nAdditional matches were taped for \"MLW Reload,\" a TV special named after the 2002 event, which aired on BeIN Sports USA and MLW's YouTube channel on January 20.\nProduction\nBackground\nKings of Colosseum is a reoccurring professional wrestling supercard event produced by MLW that was first held on July 6, 2019. The first event would air live as a special episode of MLW's weekly television series, Fusion.\nOn September 3, 2023, at Fury Road, MLW announced that Blood & Thunder would take place on January 6, 2024. On December 11, however, it was announced that Kings of Colosseum would be taking place on January 6, at the 2300 Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, replacing Blood & Thunder on that date. As part of MLW's partnership with Triller TV to produce live specials for TrillerTV+ subscribers, the 2024 edition will also be the first to air live since the inaugural event in 2019.\nStorylines\nThe card consisted of matches that result from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches, with results predetermined by MLW's writers. Storylines were played out on MLW Fusion, and the league's social media platforms.\nAs part of MLW's \"Open Door Policy,\" several free agents and freelancers were set for the event. This included the MLW returns of Sami Callihan and Matt Riddle. In addition, several wrestlers from partner promotion Tokyo Joshi Pro-Wrestling (TJPW) also competed, including Hyper Misao, Nao Kakuta, and Moka Miyamoto.\nAfter Alex Kane successfully defended the MLW World Heavyweight Championship against Matt Cardona at One Shot, Kane called out anyone to challenge him. The lights went out and Richard Holliday appeared, marking his first appearance in MLW since Battle Riot IV in June 2022. Mister Saint Laurent then offered Holliday a world title match against Kane which Holliday accepted, joining the World Titan Federation (WTF). The match was then made official for Kings of Colosseum.\nFor several months, Love, Doug has attempted to attract the attention of B3cca. On the Fusion on Thanksgiving special aired on November 23, Doug received an invitation for a rendezvous. However, it turned out the invitation was sent by Brett Ryan Gosselin, who was B3cca's boyfriend. Gosselin would bludgeon Doug with a crowbar, leaving him bloody and with multiple injuries to the face. On December 13, MLW announced on their website that Doug and Gosselin will compete in a \"Love is Blind(fold)\" match at Kings of Colosseum.\nAkira and Rickey Shane Page of The Calling had been feuding ever since Akira lost the MLW World Middleweight Championship at Slaughterhouse. It came to a head at the following Fightland event, where The Calling lost the MLW World Tag Team Championship to the Second Gear Crew (Matthew Justice and 1 Called Manders). After the match, Page and the rest of The Calling attacked Akira, kicking him out of the group. On the season finale of Fusion, Akira challenged Page for the latter's MLW National Openweight Championship, but was quickly defeated. The Calling would conduct a post-match assault on Akira afterwards. On December 19, MLW announced a rematch between the two for the title in a Taipei Deathmatch, where both participants will have taped fists covered in broken glass.\nResults\n|results=\n|caption= Kings of Colosseum\n|match1 = Wasted Youth (Dyln McKay and Marcus Mathers) and Alec Price defeated The Dirty Ass Bastards (TJ Crawford, Griffin McCoy and Tony Deppen) by pinfall\n|stip1  = Six-man tag team match\n|time1  = 9:46\n|match2 = Janai Kai (c) (with Salina de la Renta) defeated Hyper Misao by submission\n|stip2  = Singles match for the MLW World Women's Featherweight Championship\n|time2  = 7:15\n|match3  = The Second Gear Crew (Matthew Justice and 1 Called Manders) (c) defeated World Titan Federation (Tom Lawlor and Josh Bishop) (with Mister Saint Laurent) by pinfall\n|stip3   = Tag team match for the MLW World Tag Team Championship\n|time3   = 15:40\n|match4  = Rickey Shane Page (c) defeated Akira by pinfall\n|stip4   = Taipei Deathmatch for the MLW National Openweight Championship\n|time4   = 12:23\n|match5  = Love, Doug defeated Brett Ryan Gosselin by pinfall\n|stip5   = Love is Blind(fold) match\n|time5   = 3:22\n|match6  = Alex Kane (c) (with Mr. Thomas) defeated Richard Holliday (with Mister Saint Laurent) by submission\n|stip6   = Singles match for the MLW World Heavyweight Championship\n|time6   = 13:55\n|match7  = Matt Riddle defeated Jacob Fatu by submission\n|stip7   = Singles match\n|results=\n|caption= Reload (January 20)\n|match1 = Zayda (with Mister Saint Laurent) defeated Notorious Mimi by pinfall\n|stip1  = Singles match\n|time1  = 4:48\n|match2 = Masked Good Brother #3 defeated Steph De Lander by pinfall\n|stip2  = Intergender match\n|time2  = 8:53\n|match3 = Ichiban defeated Jimmy Lloyd by pinfall\n|stip3  = Singles match\n|time3  = 6:03\n|match4 = Nao Kakuta defeated Moka Miyamoto by pinfall\n|stip4  = Singles match\n|time4  = 6:50\n|match5 = Delmi Exo defeated Tiara James by pinfall\n|stip5  = Singles match\n|time5  = 2:34\n|match6 = Alex Kane and Matt Riddle (with The Bomaye Fight Club (Faye Jackson and Mr. Thomas)) defeated World Titan Federation (Josh Bishop and Tom Lawlor) (with Zayda and Mister Saint Laurent) by pinfall\n|stip6  = Tag team match\n|time6  = 10:40\n|match7 = Satoshi Kojima defeated Sami Callihan by pinfall\n|stip7  = Singles match\n|time7  = 9:09\n}}\nReferences"
