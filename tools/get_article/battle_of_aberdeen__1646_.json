George, Marquis of Huntly the commander of a Royalist army, defeated a force of Covenanters under the command of Hugh, Lord Montgomerie.\nPrelude\nIn 1646 Montgomerie was engaged in the northern campaign under John Middleton and on 27 April entered Aberdeen with about 240 horse (cavalry) in four troops. In addition to his horse he had under his command 700 foot in two regiments, and he was entrusted with the duty of holding the city. Huntly, who having suffered some setbacks had retreated to Strathnaver in 1645 had since then returned to his lands around Strathbogie and raised a force of 1,600 foot and 600 horse.\nBattle\nOn 14 May Huntly, with about 1,500 foot and 500 horse, stormed Aberdeen and set it on fire. Montgomerie's defenders repulsed the first two assaults but were then overcome. The Covenanters suffered many casualties and over 300 were taken prisoner, but there were no civilian casualties.\nAftermath\nHuntly did not remain in Aberdeen, but with his usual indecision he soon returned to Strathbogie. A council of war declared on 8 June that Montgomerie had conducted himself in the affair \"with as much prudence and gallantry as could have been expected\".\nCitations\nReferences\n*\n* This source states that the commanders were Huntly and Colonel Harie Barclay.\nAttribution\n*\n*\n**"
