Created in 2007, it elects three councillors.\nAs its name suggests, its territory comprises the localities of Mossend (as well as parts of Bellshill including the town centre east of Motherwell Road, and the Thorndean and Milnwood neighbourhoods) and neighbouring Holytown (plus part of New Stevenston – streets north of the Shotts Line railway tracks). A 2017 boundary review reduced the territory in central Bellshill slightly, and caused a small decrease in the electorate. The ward had a population of 13,480 in 2019.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Paul Delaney(SNP)\n|rowspan=7; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|James Coyle(Labour)\n|rowspan=7; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Kevin McKeown(Labour)\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=3|David Baird(SNP/Alba)\n|rowspan=5|Frank McNally(Labour)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=5|Jim Reddin(Labour)\n|-\n!2021\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Beth Baudo(SNP/Progressive Change NL/Labour)\n|-\n!2023\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color:#192C40\" |\n|-\n!2024\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color:\" |\n|rowspan=1|Helena Gray(Labour)\n|}\nBeth Baudo defected from the SNP to Progressive Change North Lanarkshire in 2023.
