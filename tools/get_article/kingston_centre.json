The Kingston Centre name now belongs to a . campus-style open-air shopping centre on the same site, which replaced the now-demolished indoor mall.\nAnchored by the Loblaws supermarket and a Canadian Tire store and bordered by Sir John A. Macdonald Blvd, Bath Road and Princess Street.\nHistory\nThe Kingston Shopping Centre was built in 1955 and anchored by Simpsons-Sears (later Sears Canada) department store. It was located at 1100 Princess Street in what was then the west end of the city, and served as one of two main transfer points for all Kingston Transit routes and the starting point for the city's annual Santa Claus parade. Originally an outdoor mall, it was converted to an enclosed indoor mall in 1970-71, and once boasted 78 stores including the two-storey Sears and a Loblaws supermarket.\nThe Kingston Shopping Centre retained the title of largest shopping centre in the area until the Cataraqui Town Centre was constructed in 1982 in the former Kingston Township. Before then, its closest rival was the Frontenac Mall, built in 1967 as Kingston's first enclosed mall with 57 stores, anchored by Woolco.\nKingston Shopping Centre's retail traffic, once brisk, sharply declined after the relocation of Sears to the  Cataraqui Town Centre in 1999. The Loblaws supermarket, relocated into a new building constructed on the site of the former Sears store, became sole anchor. This move, combined with the disappearance of smaller department stores including Biway Stores, Family Fair, Marks and Spencer, Zellers and Woolworth, left Kingston Shopping Centre without a department store anchor. With one end of the mall a grocery store, the opposite end of the mall (which originally held Loblaws and a food court) was left as an empty ghostbox and eventually boarded up; it was the first section to be razed during the demolition of the remaining indoor mall building in 2004.\nFewer than a dozen retail tenants remained at the time of demolition: a barber shop, a health food store, two banks, a grocery store, a drugstore, a camera store and a restaurant. These businesses were moved to new buildings constructed in what had been the parking lot of the original indoor mall and remain in operation.\nThe former department store site is currently occupied by the Loblaws grocery store building, with the rest of the greyfield re-used for new retail construction or left vacant. No part of the original mall structure remains.\nThe area near the mall includes a large number of apartment buildings built in the 1960s and '70s, with a high percentage of senior citizen residents who made up a large portion of the mall's clientele.  Some have complained that the site is \"not as pedestrian-friendly as they (the developers) guaranteed it was going to be.\"\nBus terminal\nKingston Centre Transfer Point is located in the heart of the shopping centre and is a major transfer point for Kingston Transit. It is the terminus for daytime routes 2, 11, 31 and 32 with routes 4 and 16 passing through. Routes 501/502 and 701/702 also connect with the Kingston Centre through nearby road stops.\nAnchors & majors\n*Loblaws\n*Canadian Tire\n*Rexall\nSee also\n* Princess Street (Kingston, Ontario)\nReferences\n*[http://www.queensu.ca/surp/Executive%20Summary%20-%20M.%20Kader.pdf Kader, M.
