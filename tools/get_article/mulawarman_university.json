It was established on September 27, 1962, making it the oldest tertiary education institution in East Kalimantan. With more than 35,000 students, Universitas Mulawarman is the university with the most students in Kalimantan. Its main campus is in Gunung Kelua, while other campuses are in Pahlawan Road, Banggeris Street and Flores Street of Samarinda.\nHistory\nThe name \"Mulawarman\" is taken from the legendary king Mulavarman Nala Dewa of the Kutai Martadipura Kingdom who ruled in the 4th-5th century CE, historically one of the earliest Hindu kingdoms in Indonesia, located in current Kutai Kartanegara Regency, East Kalimantan.\nBeginnings\nOn June 6, 1962 the Governor of East Kalimantan Province, Aji Pangeran Tumenggung Pranoto, founded Perguruan Tinggi Mulawarman (Mulawarman College), located in Samarinda. Then the Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture approved the establishment as Universitas Mulawarman on September 28, 1962 and officially confirmed by the President on April 23, 1963. The date of September 27, 1962 was set as the date of the founding of the Universitas Mulawarman.\nAt first the Universitas Mulawarman had four faculties: Faculty of State and Trade Administration, Faculty of Agriculture, Faculty of Forestry\nand Faculty of Mining in Balikpapan. Only the Faculty of State and Trade Administration could be started at the opening in 1962, the Faculty of Agriculture followed in 1964. In 1966, the Faculty of State and Trade Administration was split into the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences and Faculty of Economics.\n1970s-1980s\nDue to difficulty to find teaching staff, the Faculty of Mining, in Balikpapan, was closed in 1970. In 1978, the Samarinda Teaching and Education Sciences Institute was integrated into Universitas Mulawarman as the Faculty of Teaching and Education Sciences on March 20. Thus since September 7, 1982, there were five faculties in Universitas Mulawarman: Faculty of Agriculture, Faculty of Economics, Faculty of Forestry, Faculty of Teaching and Education Sciences, and Faculty of Social and Political Sciences.\nOn December 3, 1985 Universitas Mulawarman Polytechnic was established.\n1990s-2000s\nSince the 1990s, Universitas Mulawarman established new faculties: Faculty of Fisheries and Marine Sciences in 1996, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences in 2001, Faculty of Medicine in 2001, Faculty of Law in 2005, Faculty of Public Health in 2005, Faculty of Engineering in 2007, Faculty of Pharmacy in 2008, and Faculty of Cultural Studies in 2009.\nOn April 28, 1997, Universitas Mulawarman Polytechnic was formed into Samarinda State Polytechnic, separated from Universitas Mulawarman.\n2010s onwards\nIn 2010, the university established the Faculty of Information and Communication Technology.\nUniversitas Mulawarman rector is Prof. Dr. H.
