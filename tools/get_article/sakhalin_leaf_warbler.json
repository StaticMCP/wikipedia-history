Its crown, upper parts, and bill are also dark brown. It has greenish-brown cheeks and its ear-coverts are mottled. Its bill has a pink base that extends to the lower mandible. Its legs are pale pinkish-brown.\nIt is easily confused with the pale-legged leaf warbler. One possible distinguishing feature is that its upperparts are slightly more greenish. It is more easily distinguished by its lower-pitched vocalizations, but some overlap does exist in the species' pitch ranges.\nBreeding\nIt nests in shrubs.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Sakhalin Leaf Warbler\n\n#REDIRECT Sakhalin leaf warbler\n}}"
