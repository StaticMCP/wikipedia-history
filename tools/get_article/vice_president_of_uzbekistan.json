It was the title of the deputy to the President of Uzbekistan. Shukrullo Mirsaidov was the first and only holder of the office from 24 March 1990 to 8 January 1992.\nHistory\nThe position of vice president was introduced on the same day Islam Karimov was elected President of the Uzbek SSR on March 24, 1990 at a session of the Supreme Council of the Uzbek SSR.

After the abolition of the post of vice president on January 8, 1992, the post of prime minister was introduced in the country.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Took office\n!Left office\n!Notes\n|-\n|Shukrullo Mirsaidov\n|March 1990\n|8 January 1992\n|\n|}\nFunctions\nThe main function of the vice-president of Uzbekistan was to, in the case of the president's incapacitation, death or resignation and until early elections, assume presidential powers as acting president At the same time, the vice-president of Uzbekistan, jointly headed the Cabinet of Ministers with the president.\nNowadays, article 96 of the Constitution of Uzbekistan states that should the President of the Republic fail to perform his duties due to poor health, confirmed by a certificate of a State Medical Commission formed by the Supreme Assembly of Uzbekistan (Oliy Majlis), an emergency session of the Oliy Majlis shall be held within ten days.
