The most successful president in the club’s history is Şamil Ekinci, who led Trabzonspor during its golden era from 1975 to 1980. Under his leadership, the club secured an astonishing 13 trophies, including four Süper Lig titles (1975–76, 1976–77, 1978–79, 1979–80), two Turkish Cups, five Turkish Super Cups, and two Prime Minister’s Cups. His tenure firmly established Trabzonspor as a dominant force in Turkish football. Another notable figure is Ahmet Ağaoğlu, who oversaw Trabzonspor’s return to glory during his presidency from 2018 to 2023. Under his guidance, the club ended a 38-year league title drought by winning the 2021–22 Süper Lig, in addition to securing one Turkish Cup and two Turkish Super Cups, for a total of four trophies. Mehmet Ali Yılmaz also played a key role in the club’s history, winning four trophies, including one Süper Lig title in 1983–84, during his multiple terms as president. Other presidents, such as Faruk Özak, who won three trophies in the mid-1990s, and Atay Aktuğ, who led the club to a Turkish Cup victory in 2003–04, contributed to Trabzonspor’s legacy. Özkan Sümer also played a key role, securing a Turkish Cup in 2002–03. Celal Ataman, Mazhar Afacan, and Sadri Şener also played significant roles, each delivering important trophies during their presidencies. Together, these leaders have shaped Trabzonspor’s history and ensured its place as one of Turkey’s most successful football clubs.\nPresidents\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n| 1\n| align=\"center\" | Ali Osman Ulusoy\n| 1967–1968\n|-\n| 2\n| align=\"center\" | Rıfat Dedeoğlu\n| 1968–1969\n|-\n| 3\n| align=\"center\" | Ali Osman Ulusoy\n| 1969–1970\n|-\n| 4\n| align=\"center\" | Rıfat Dedeoğlu\n| 1970–1971\n|-\n| 5\n| align=\"center\" | Suat Oyman\n| 1971–1972\n|-\n| 6\n| align=\"center\" | Salih Erdem\n| 1972–1975\n|-\n| 7\n| align=\"center\" | Şamil Ekinci\n| 1975–1980\n|-\n| 8\n| align=\"center\" | Celal Ataman\n| 1980–1981\n|-\n| 9\n| align=\"center\" | Mustafa Günaydın\n| 1981–1982\n|-\n| 10\n| align=\"center\" | Mehmet Ali Yılmaz\n| 1982–1988\n|-\n| 11\n| align=\"center\" | Mazhar Afacan\n| 1988–1989\n|-\n| 12\n| align=\"center\" | Mehmet Ali Yılmaz\n| 1989–1992\n|-\n| 13\n| align=\"center\" | Sadri Şener\n| 1992–1994\n|-\n| 14\n| align=\"center\" | Faruk Özak\n| 1994–1997\n|-\n| 15\n| align=\"center\" | Mehmet Ali Yılmaz\n| 1997–2000\n|-\n| 16\n| align=\"center\" | Özkan Sümer\n| 2000–2003\n|-\n| 17\n| align=\"center\" | Atay Aktuğ\n| 2003–2006\n|-\n| 18\n| align=\"center\" | Nuri Albayrak\n| 2006–2008\n|-\n| 19\n| align=\"center\" | Sadri Şener\n| 2008–2013\n|-\n| 20\n| align=\"center\" | İbrahim Hacıosmanoğlu\n| 2013–2015\n|-\n| 21\n| align=\"center\" | Muharrem Usta\n| 2015–2018\n|-\n| 22\n| align=\"center\" | Ahmet Ağaoğlu\n| 2018–2023\n|-\n| 23\n| align=\"center\" | Ertuğrul Doğan\n| 2023–\n|}\nHonours\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!\n!\n!SL\n!1L\n!TC\n!TSC\n!PMC\n!Total\n|-\n| 1 || Şamil Ekinci || 4 || 0 || 2 || 5 || 2 || 13\n|-\n| 2 || Ahmet Ağaoğlu || 1 || 0 || 1 || 2 || 0 || 4\n|-\n| 3 || Mehmet Ali Yılmaz || 1 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 1 || 4\n|-\n| 4 || Özkan Sümer || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 1\n|-\n| 5 || Atay Aktuğ || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 1\n|-\n| 6 || Sadri Şener || 0 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 0 || 2\n|-\n| 7 || Faruk Özak || 0 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 2 || 4\n|-\n| 8 || Celal Ataman || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1\n|-\n| 9 || Mazhar Afacan || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 1\n|-\n| 10 || Salih Erdem || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.trabzonspor.org.tr/tr Official website]\n*[http://www.tff.org/Default.aspx?pageId=535&kulupID=3596 Trabzonspor] on TFF.org\n*[https://www.uefa.com/nationalassociations/teams/52731--trabzonspor/ Squad, results and fixtures] at UEFA"
