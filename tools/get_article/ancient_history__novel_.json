The character Dom is sometimes described as a fictionalized Norman Mailer.\nThe title \"Ancient History\" refers to classical Roman, Greek, Egyptian, and Persian history, which Cy, the narrator, is something of an amateur expert in. It was the name for the course Cy took at Poly Prep. But it also the narrator's frequent dismissive phrase regarding his own obsessive retelling of trivial details from his own personal past.\nThe word \"paraphase\", used in the subtitle and a few times in the text, is Cy's neologism, never actually defined. In March 2014, Dzanc Books published a paperback edition, with an introduction by Jonathan Lethem.\nPlot summary\nThe setting is one evening, circa 1970.\nCy had intended to talk to the famous social scientist/writer/activist Dom (or Don, Cy isn't sure) who lives in the same Manhattan building as Cy. But upon arriving at Dom's floor of the building, he finds the police are removing Dom's body, reportedly a suicide. Cy enters the apartment, locks the door but leaves the chain off, and proceeds to commit in writing, with Dom's own paper and pen, all the things Cy had intended to say to Dom, and then some. The resulting manuscript is the sole content of the novel.\nCy tells the rambling story of his own life, his friendships since childhood with Al (on vacations in the country) and with Bob (his neighbor in Brooklyn Heights), his marriage to Ev and their daughter Emma, her ex-husband Doug, later a suicide which Cy feels partly responsible for, his stepson Ted. He makes a major issue of the fact that Al and Bob have never met by his own connivance, but are about to. He confesses to stealing Dom's mail. He also writes a great deal about Dom's life and theories, and expresses concern that Dom's suicide might be Cy's fault.\nHalfway through, the narrative breaks off mid-sentence. As we learn in the resumption of Cy's writing, Dom's son-in-law and a police officer entered the apartment and looked around. Cy was hidden behind a curtain, but he had left the just-written manuscript on Dom's desk. The officer wasn't sure if he should treat the apartment as a crime scene: he was suspicious of the son-in-law's removal of Cy's manuscript, but let it go. When the two leave, Cy sees that his writing was taken. Cy then resumes his writing, even more frantic.\nCharacter summary\n;Cy:Presumably short for Cyrus, also called C.C. Born around 1930, an only child, an early gift of a Junior Corona leads to Cy taking an interest in writing. Cy attended Poly. Cy has a strong interest in ancient history, and refers learnedly to Cyrus the Great, Harpagus, Herodotus, Hypatia and Lucretius. He makes erudite puns, like Forgetorix the First and Utmosis the Last. He has followed Dom's career, partly with a press pass, moving into Dom's building six months before Dom's death, and was introduced to Dom by a mutual acquaintance one week before Dom's death. He is married to Ev, whose son by a previous marriage is Ted. Cy and Ev have a daughter Emma, just learning to talk.\n;Dom:The great man, a New York Jewish liberal, writer, and activist. He led a great demonstration in 1968, the Anti-Abstraction March, which culminated with Dom falling&mdash;possibly pushed, not that Dom admits to caring&mdash;out of a ninth floor window and surviving unhurt. He is divorced from Dorothy, called \"Dot\". Their children are Richard and Lila. Lila is married to an unnamed psychiatrist, frequently referred to by his nationality, Hungarian.\n;Al:Cy's country friend, from near Heatsburg, a fictional town in Massachusetts, the far end of Red Sox territory. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of seemingly everything. He served in the Coast Guard from 1951&ndash;53. His sister Gail and Cy were attracted to each other as young teenagers. He has a cat named Epaminondas.\n;Bob:Cy's Brooklyn Heights childhood neighbor and friend. He married Perpetua \"Petty\" Belle Pound, a mutual childhood friend and neighbor of Bob and Cy. Their children are Robert and John B. He likes Beckett's plays, in contrast to Cy, who likes Beckett's novels. Their Beckett discussion is the first time Cy's name is mentioned.\n;Doug:Ev's ex-husband, and father of Ted, he committed suicide the day after meeting Cy. The description of the meeting itself, partway though the second half, is the second time Cy mentions his own name.\n;Fred Eagle:A book-seller, he tries to interest Cy and some friends in Charles Dickens, especially Great Expectations, the famed eleventh edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica, and Charles Kingsley Hypatia.  He later recounts a dream, where he saw his wife reading Hypatia, but she became Hypatia, and time ancient and present mixed together.\nWhat is \"paraphase\"?\nMcElroy has given the following explanation:\nCy's first use of the word occurs on page 139:\nThe \"phrases\" here refer to Cy's actual writing compared and contrasted with the reality they are describing, three phrases to Cy's personal \"ancient history\", and two phrases regarding Cy's current situation (although the \"thirty word\" count seems to be off by one). A reader of Beckett's novels, Cy has adopted a Malone-like style, including comments on his own handwriting.\nNot all readers have noticed the unusual spelling. For example, The New York Times review by Lehmann-Haupt gives the subtitle as \"Paraphase\", and similarly misspells the word in the above quotation from the novel.\nThemes and style\nThe novel is highly repetitious (one analysis calls it \"a verbal excess\"), with Cy amplifying the various back stories, in ways which emphasize, and sometimes are, the themes. Cy himself is a reader of Samuel Beckett's novels. Because Cy has too much memory (Cy wishes he \"could be Forgetorix the First, and leave behind ... a mass of Past\"), Cy is forced into florid repetitiveness. The \"connect-the-dot\" puzzles that Al's father did are echoed in the characters with names barely more than A, B, C, D, E, F, etc., and which the reader is forced to \"connect\".\nCy has a taste for \"para-\" as a prefix, including several uses of the subtitle neologism \"paraphase\". Cy muses that Dom's \"site\", now that he is occupying it, has become a \"para-site\".\n\"Parabola\" is used frequently. It first appears attached to two diagrams from Ted's geometry lessons, one of a parabola showing the curve as the locus of points equidistant from a focus and a directrix, the other as a cross-section of a cone. Later uses, along with \"equidistant\" and \"directrix\", are vague and metaphorical.\nCy has a theory concerning what he calls the Vectoral Muscle, located in the brain near the pons Varolii. It is a gift that usually only children might have, allowing them to see the geometric relations between everything. But it can go wrong, leading to Vectoral Dystrophy.\nReception\nIn the two reviews from the NYT cited below, note that the first review has the incorrect \"Paraphrase\" in the subtitle, while the second review has the correct \"Paraphase\".\n}}\n}}\n}}\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\nBook reviews\n* |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/joseph-mcelroy-6/ancient-history-a-paraphase/}}\n*\n*\n*\nLiterary analysis\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
