The documentary includes never-before-seen behind-the-scenes footage of Bruce Lee's life, as well as parts of the original footage of his incomplete film Game of Death, which had been left out of the film.\nPlot\nThe film has five parts, the first three of which present an overview of Bruce Lee's life, including interviews of his widow, Linda Lee Cadwell, Lee's best student Taky Kimura, Hapkido Grandmaster Ji Han-jae and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who co-stars in \"Game of Death\". The last two parts include 23 minutes of the original footage of \"Game of Death\".\nCast\n* Bruce Lee (Posthumous appearance, used with archive footage)\n* Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\n* Dan Inosanto\n* Ji Han-jae\n* John Little\n* Linda Lee Cadwell\n* Taky Kimura\n* Ted Hanulak\nProduction\nFive years after Bruce Lee's death in 1973, Golden Harvest used about 11 minutes of Lee's uncompleted original footage intended by him to become the film \"Game of Death\", completing the rest of their 1978 film using Lee look-a-likes. Twenty-three more minutes of Lee's original footage were considered lost for 28 years, until they were discovered by Bey Logan in 1999. John Little assembled these parts according to Lee's script notes, reflecting more accurately Lee's intentions.\nRelease\nThe documentary was released on VHS and DVD by Warner Home Video.
