Built from 1903 to 1904, it served as a meetinghouse for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints until 1982.  It is believed that the building was designed by James H. Pulley, a local carpenter and builder.  A large addition built in 1929 was designed by architects Young and Hansen of Salt Lake City.  In 1984, the building was sold to Michael Bigelow.  It became the home of Bigelow & Co. Organ Builders.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.\nSee also\n*American Fork Third Ward Meetinghouse, also NRHP-listed\nReferences"
