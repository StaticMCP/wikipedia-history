He is most-known for his Chesterfield cigarettes advertisements and Steinway & Sons portraits that ran during the early 1900s. Chambers also illustrated stories for writers W. Somerset Maugham and Pearl S. Buck, among others. These appeared in various magazines including, Cosmopolitan, ''Harper's, and Redbook''.\nPersonal life and education\nChambers was born on August 9, 1883, in Ottumwa, Iowa to Horatio Cox Chambers (1849-1914) and Rosa A. Lee Chambers (1849-1920). He had one sibling, Helen Lee Chambers (1880-1899).\nChambers received his education in art from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Later, he attended the National Academy of Design, where he studied under George Bridgman.\nOne of Chambers' teachers was Fanny Musnell (1884-1920). She was an illustrator for national magazines including, Cosmopolitan and ''Woman's Home Companion. Her style of illustration influenced Chambers, and the two would eventually marry. They remained together till her death in 1920.\nChambers later remarried to Pauline True (1912-?), the model from his 1933 Red Cross painting.\nOn November 4, 1941, Chambers died in New York, New York. He is buried in Ottumwa Cemetery in Iowa.\nCareer\nIn the beginning of his career, Chambers illustrated a short story series centered on con man, Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford. Throughout his career, he would continue to illustrate short stories for writers, Pearl Buck, Louis Bromfield, Faith Baldwin, and W. Somerset Maugham. These would appear in the magazines, Harper's, Cosmopolitan, Woman's Home Companion, Ladies' Home Journal, and McCall's''.\nChambers' illustrations worked for both advertisements and editorial assignments. He would frequently contribute to ''Harper's Monthly; many times his illustrations wound up on the cover. His illustrations also appeared on the cover of Redbook magazine. For years, Chambers had an exclusive contract with Cosmopolitan magazine.\nIn 1917, during World War I, Chambers illustrated a poster for the United States Food Administration, titled \"Food Will Win the War.\" On the poster, it reads: \"Food Will Win the War. You came here seeking freedom. You must now help preserve it. Wheat is needed for the allies. Waste nothing.\" Its target demographic was immigrants. To further drive this point, the poster was produced in many languages: Yiddish, Italian, Spanish, and Hungarian.\nIn the 1920s, Chambers was commissioned by Steinway & Sons to paint portraits of popular pianists. These portraits of pianists, which included Sergie Rachmaninoff, Josef Hoffman, Alfred Cortot, and Paderewski, were widely reproduced for nine years.\nChambers was also commissioned by Chesterfield cigarettes. His series of billboard advertisements ran for five years. In 1931, these depictions of radiant models smoking, alongside a memorable catchphrase, was considered by Advertising Outdoors'' as, \"the most beautiful posters ever painted.\" In all, he illustrated 45 billboard displays for Chesterfield cigarettes. Chambers was also responsible for illustrating billboard advertisements for Palmolive soap. His illustrations set high standards for twenty-by-four outdoor posters of the time.\nIn 1912, Chambers became a member of the Society of Illustrators. He was later President of the Artists Guild and member of the Allied AA.\nChambers' style of painting has been described as, \"extremely competent, marked by subtlety of value and color.\" Other critics have said that because of the \"polish\" of his paintings, one would think he had studied at the French Academy. The use of color was considered his strength.\nIn 1931, he was awarded the 2nd Altman Prize at the National Academy of Design exhibition for his portrait of artist John Alonzo Williams. In 2010, Chambers was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the Society of Illustrators.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.idesirevintageposters.com/chambers.html Chesterfield Posters]\n*[http://www.illustratedgallery.com/artwork/for-sale/artist/charles-e-chambers Various Chambers paintings at Illustrated Gallery]\n*[http://www.vintageadbrowser.com/tobacco-ads-1920s/8 1927 Chesterfield ad featured on Vintage Ad Browser]\n*[https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/07/29/the-posters-that-sold-world-war-i/ WWI poster featured in The Washington Post]\n*[http://www.yankeeclassic.com/miskatonic/dliterature/authors/chambers/works/rwcbibl-mag1921.htm ''McCall's covers illustrated by Chambers]\n*[http://www.artnet.com/artists/charles-edward-chambers/join-your-red-cross-needs-you-qHRTr1wYukJ6fII76JxuJA2 Red Cross poster illustrated by Chambers; Features his wife Pauline True]\n*[http://www.lucasmuseum.org/collection/category/illustration-43.html#77,undefined Pampered Treatment'' by Chambers]"
