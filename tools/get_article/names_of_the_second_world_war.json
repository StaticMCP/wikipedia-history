Before the attack of Pearl Harbor, the war was called the Second Great War, a reference to the Great War which was later named World War I, and the European War in June 1941, after Germany invaded the Soviet Union. The United States official documents adopted the name World War II but only got its popularity after the United States declaration of war on the Japanese Empire on 8 December 1941. Eventually, the name reached popularity among media outlets, and later the name was officially used by the public. The conflict was officially established as World War II when Harry S. Truman approved the term.\nBesides the generally used name for the war, other names for fronts are also used for memorials and to encourage people to fight, such as the term Great Patriotic War by the Soviet Union in the Eastern Front against Nazi Germany, and the Greater East Asia War by the Imperial Japan in the Pacific War.\nCommon name\nSecond World War\nThe earliest record for someone using the term Second World War appeared just two years after the First World War ended by British soldier and author Charles à Court Repington, though he didn't directly mention the name, he just referred to the Great War as the First World War as he believed that there would be other global wars. He wrote in his book The First World War:\n}}\nOn 3 September 1939, the day Britain declared war on Germany due to its invasion of Poland, the magazine The Times became the first newspaper in the world to call the war as the Second World War, using the phrase: \"The Second World War broke out yesterday\". Following The Times' use of name, every British media and official document used this term.}}\nIn June 1941, US official documents named the ongoing European conflict World War II when Germany invaded the Soviet Union. On 8 December 1941, when the US declared war on Japan, President Franklin D. Roosevelt publicly referred to the conflict as World War II. From 1942 to 1945, it was widely thought of as a global war against fascism in English-speaking countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States. In September 1945, just days after Japan surrendered, President Harry S. Truman approved the name use of World War II in government documents.\nEastern Front\nGreat Patriotic War\n]]\nIn the Soviet Union and modern-day Russia, the term Great Patriotic War refers to the 4-year long war between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany during the Second World War. The first usage of the term was during the 1812 French invasion of Russia, when the Russians called it the 'Patriotic War'. This term was also used in World War I when the Russian Empire fought the German Empire, Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Ottoman Empire.\nOn 23 June 1941, just one day after the Germans invaded the Soviet Union, the newspaper Pravda first used the term in an article titled: The Great Patriotic War of the Soviet People, published by Yemelyan Yaroslavsky. The term was chosen to motivate the Soviet people and promote defense against the invader (which is Nazi Germany). After the war in Europe was over, the term Great Patriotic War was mostly used inside of the Soviet Union and rarely mentioned outside of it. Nowadays, Russia and other post-Soviet nations still use the term. In 2014, Uzbekistan was the first post-Soviet nation to not recognize the term and designated World War II as the official name.\nGerman–Soviet War/Nazi–Soviet War\nAlso known as the German–Soviet/Nazi War, this term mostly used in modern-day Germany and Ukraine to refer the war on the Easter Front between the Soviets and Germans. Examples of this term being used include historians John Erickson (in The Road to Stalingrad and The Road to Berlin) and David M. Glantz in most of their works, the BBC and The National WWII Museum occasionally use this term.\nPacific War\n.]]\nMost Allied nations did not commonly distinguish the Pacific War from the Second World War, simply calling it the war against Japan. In the United States, terms like the War in the Pacific, Asia–Pacific War, Pacific–Asian Theater and the Pacific Theater were mostly used.\nJapanese official documents published on 12 December 1941 used the name Greater East Asian War after Pearl Harbor to include the ongoing wars between Western Allies and China. The term was prohibited during the Allied occupation of Japan from 1945 to 1952. Another term is the China Incident, which the Japanese government used in order to avoid declaring war before 7 December 1941.\nIn China, the war is called the War of Resistance against Japan or the Eight-Year War of Resistance, though these terms refer to the Second Sino‐Japanese War, which by definition is different from the Pacific War. Other names like the Far East War and War in the East were also used in Britain and its Commonwealths.\nSee also\n* Names of the American Civil War\nNotes\nReferences"
