All were later sold to AN Tasrail along with the 2350 class, and reclassified as the ZB class. The sole survivor, now numbered 2128 (ex-ZB14, formerly 2371) is now preserved at Don River Railway\nHistory\nThe 2370 class was an evolution of the 2350 class. They were built for use on the Blackwater and Moura coal lines and based at Gladstone. The class became surplus following electrification of the coal lines and in 1987 were all sold to AN Tasrail where they all entered service as the ZB class. They were very similar to the Tasrail Za class.\nIn 2003, one was sold to South Spur Rail Services and shipped to Western Australia to operate infrastructure trains, it is now owned by Greentrains.\nReferences\nExternal links"
