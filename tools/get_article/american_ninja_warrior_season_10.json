Hosts Matt Iseman and Akbar Gbaja-Biamila returned for their ninth and sixth seasons, respectively, alongside sideline reporter Kristine Leahy who returns for her fourth. Prior to the season premiere, NBC aired two special episodes. On May 17, 2018, a two-hour All-Stars special aired, while on May 24, 2018, the second annual Celebrity Ninja Warrior for Red Nose Day featured celebrities raising money for charity.\nChanges this season included the introduction of the 18-foot (5.5 m) \"Mega Wall\". It was next to the original 14'6\" (4.4 m) warped wall, and gave competitors the choice of which to climb. Competitors who chose the Mega Wall had only one attempt to reach the top, and if successful, would win $10,000. If unsuccessful, the competitor would only get one shot at the warped wall. Those who did not wish to attempt the Mega Wall had three chances to reach the top of the warped wall. The Mega Wall was only in play during the city qualifying. In addition, the age limit was lowered down from 21 in all previous seasons to 19 this season. The \"Last Ninja Standing\", the competitor who goes the farthest in the finals, if no one completes Stage 4, would now receive $100,000.\nSeason 7 champion Isaac Caldiero participated and finished the Indianapolis qualifiers, marking his return to competition in the series. He would later fall in the city finals, marking the end of his season as he fell at Block Run.\nCompetition schedule\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Qualifying airing !! Finals airing !! City !!

The lot is close to the Las Vegas Village location of the Route 91 Harvest Festival shootings, which led the producers to consider finding another venue before deciding to return. The taping took place on the first two nights of a weeklong session that also included tapings for the \"USA vs. The World\", \"All-Stars Team Challenge\", and \"All-Stars Skills Challenge\" special events.\nThis season, 97 competitors made it to Vegas. In attendance were the Vegas Golden Knights cheerleaders and mascot Chance cheering on the competitors.\nNote: Even though she earned a place in the Las Vegas finals, 5-time ANW finalist Jessie Graff cannot compete because of her shooting schedule while filming Wonder Woman 1984 (Wonder Woman sequel) as a stuntwoman. Jessie is seen on the Stage 1 finals Day 2 episode in Canary Islands, Spain telling the viewers about it and wishing her fellow competitors \"good luck\".\nStage 1\n30 Competitors made it through this grueling Stage 1 course. The Double Dipper knocked out 26 competitors on Stage 1, the most of any obstacle on Stage 1, including David Campbell, Brett Sims, Travis Rosen, Flip Rodriguez, Jeremiah Morgan, Chris DiGangi, Karsten Williams, Neil Craver, Abel Gonzalez, Tyler Yamuachi, Rigel Henry, Michael Johnson, Rachael Goldstein, Abby Clark, and the man who made it the farthest the previous season, Joe Moravsky. In Travis Rosen's case, he broke his ankle at the dismount, which eventually resulted in him urgently being rushed to the hospital, as it was confirmed by the paramedics that his right ankle had been fractured from the impact.\nThe highlight of Stage 1 was Jamie Rahn who became the first competitor in ANW to finish the course barefoot when he ran the course (for the most part) without shoes when his right sneaker came off during the Propeller Bar. He completed the course in 2:17.93.\nStage 1 featured four new obstacles, Archer Alley, Jeep Run, the Razor Beams, and Twist & Fly.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Table key\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" | Key\n!scope=\"col\" | Description\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center; height:20px; width:20px\" |\n| Run aired on Night 1\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center; height:20px; width:20px\" |\n| Run aired on Night 2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center; height:20px; width:20px\" |\n| Run unaired\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+\n|-\n!
