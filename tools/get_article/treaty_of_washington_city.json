The group also included Talking Warrior, Red Fort, Nittahkachee, Col. Robert Cole and David Folsom, both half-breed Indians, Captain Daniel McCurtain, and Major John Pitchlynn, the U.S. Interpreter.\nThe proposed route to Washington was to travel the Natchez Trace to Nashville, Tennessee, then to Lexington, Kentucky, onward to Maysville, Kentucky, across the Ohio River northward to Chillicothe, Ohio, (former principal town of the Shawnee), then finally east over the \"National Highway\" to Washington City.\nMeetings while in Washington City\npublished in History of the Indian Tribes of North America.]]\nPushmataha met with President James Monroe and gave a speech to Secretary of War John C. Calhoun, reminding him of the longstanding alliances between the United States and the Choctaws. He said, \"[I] can say and tell the truth that no Choctaw ever drew his bow against the United States ... My nation has given of their country until it is very small. We are in trouble.\".\"\nWhile in Washington, Pushmataha sat for a portrait by Charles Bird King in his Army uniform; it hung in the Smithsonian Institution until 1865.\nPushmataha also met with the Marquis de Lafayette, who was visiting Washington City. Pushmataha said, \"Nearly fifty snows have melted since you drew your sword with Washington and fought the enemies of the United States ... Our hearts have longed to see you.\"\nTerms\nThe preamble begins with,\nThe treaty had the following abbreviated terms,\n1. Lands ceded to the United States.\n2. $6,000 to be paid to Choctaws annually, forever.\n3. $6,000 to be paid them annually for 16 years.\n4. Provision for Choctaws who may desire to remain.\n5. A certain debt due by Choctaws relinquished.\n6. Payment for services rendered in the Pensacola campaign.\n7. Fourth article of the aforesaid treaty to be modified. The Congress of the United States shall not exercise the power of apportioning the lands ... and of bringing them under the laws of the United States, but with the consent of the Choctaw Nation.\n8. Payment to satisfy claims due by United States.\n9. An agent and blacksmith for Choctaws west of the Mississippi.\n10. Robert Cole to receive a medal.\n11. Friendship perpetuated.\n12. When to take effect.\nSignatories\nJ. C. Calhoun, Mooshulatubbee, Robert Cole, Daniel McCurtain, Talking Warrior, Red Fort, Nittuckachee, David Folsom, J. L. McDonald, Thos. L. McKenney, Hezekiah Miller, and John Pitchlynn ( United States interpreter).\nAftermath\n.]]\nApuckshunubbee died in Maysville, Kentucky; and Pushmataha died in Washington. Apuckshunubbee was reported to have died from a broken neck caused by a fall from a hotel balcony. Other historians say he fell from a cliff.\nPushmataha died of croup, even though the disease usually only afflicts infants and young children.\nApuckshunubee's successor was Robert Cole and later Greenwood LeFlore. Pushmataha's successor was Nittakechi. The deaths of these two leaders effectively crippled the Choctaw Nation. Within six years the Choctaw were forced to cede their last remaining territory in Mississippi to the United States.\nSee also\n* List of Choctaw Treaties\n*Treaty of Hopewell\n*Treaty of Fort Adams\n*Treaty of Fort Confederation\n*Treaty of Hoe Buckintoopa\n*Treaty of Mount Dexter\n*Treaty of Fort St. Stephens\n*Treaty of Doak's Stand\n*Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek\n* List of treaties\nCitations\nExternal links\n* [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/cho0211.htm Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties (Treaty with the Choctaw, 1825)]"
