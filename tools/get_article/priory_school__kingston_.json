Fowler was Priory's headmaster from its founding until his retirement in 1973.\nCampus\nPriory originally consisted of just one building, a former private residence \"The Priory\".  This had been built in 1907 by the Governor of Jamaica Hugh Clarence Bourne to replace the previous building destroyed in the 1907 Kingston earthquake. This previous building had been in use as a rectory and it was in allusion to this that the name \"Priory\" was chosen for the new building.\nSee also\n* Education in Jamaica\n* List of Schools in Jamaica\nReferences\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.wikimapia.org/#lat=18.0174006&lon=-76.7870682&z=18&l=0&m=b&v=8 Aerial view]\n* [http://www.prioryjamaica.com/ www.prioryjamaica.com ] - Website for former students and members of staff maintained by Priory 'Old Boy', Stephen Smith\n* [http://www.prioryyearbooks.com/ www.prioryyearbooks.com ] - An addendum to prioryjamaica.com"
