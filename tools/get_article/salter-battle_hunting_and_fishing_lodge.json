It was built about 1945, and is a simple one-story, side-gable, frame building set on concrete piers.  A gable-front, screened porch was added about 1948. Also on the property are a contributing cistern, storage shed, and cemetery with the graves of early settlers of the island (1810-1907).\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.\nReferences"
