In 1945, she served in the Far East with the British Pacific Fleet, designated Task Force 57 upon joining the United States fleet. On 6 May 1945 Wave King and Wave Monarch were with the Logistic Support Group 300 miles south-east of Miyako to refuel Task Force 57 which was launching air strikes against island targets in the Okinawa campaign.\nWave King struck a rock north of São Luís de Maranhão, Brazil, on 9 August 1956 and suffered severe damage. She arrived at Barrow-in-Furness on 16 April 1960 for scrapping.\nReferences"
