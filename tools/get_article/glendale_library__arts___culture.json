Founded in 1907, the Glendale Library, Arts & Culture Department includes six neighborhood libraries as well as the Brand Library & Art Center, a regional visual arts and music library and performance venue housed in the historic 1904 mansion of Glendale real estate developer Leslie Coombs Brand, and the Central Library, a 93,000 square foot center.\nCollections\nAccording to internal calculations, as of June 30, 2005, GLAC owned well over 700,000 volumes of print materials, with a majority (over 400,000) being housed at the Central Library. Not included in those totals are a wealth of currently uncataloged items of local historical importance (photographs and ephemera). GLAC also owns a large body of non-English print materials (specializing in Armenian titles), as well as a \"Genocide Memorial Collection\" of works pertaining to the Armenian Genocide.\nHistory\nLibrary services in Glendale were first provided in 1906. The women of the Tuesday Afternoon Club, a social and philanthropic organization, raised money through a series of lectures to fund a library collection. The library opened in a renovated pool room at Third and E (Wilson and Everett) Streets with seventy books, soon supplemented by a State Traveling Library of fifty more, and served a population of 1,186.\nIn 1907, the City Trustees passed Ordinance 53 which established and supported a library which \"...shall be forever free to the inhabitants and nonresident taxpayers of the City of Glendale...\" The first year the library had 251 books, 165 registered patrons, and a budget of $248.88. In 1913, a\nCarnegie grant of $12,500 made possible the construction of the main library at Louise and Fifth (Harvard Street). The building was completed and dedicated November 13, 1914. The building was enlarged in 1926. Between 1940 and 1942, two side wings were added, one becoming a children's library called the Hans Christian Andersen Room and the other housing Readers' Service.\nThe present Central Library building was designed by Welton Becket shortly before his death, and opened on March 13, 1973 on the former site of Glendale Union High School and Glendale College. With  it had over four times the floor space of the old structure. The library represents one of the rare examples of Brutalist architecture among Southern California's public buildings.\nThe Central Library's 2016 remodel has brought library users a larger Children's Room and a separate Audio Visual area, as well as the ReflectSpace an inclusive exhibition space. It showcases powerful exhibitions concerning human right issues with the leadership of Ara Oshagan and Anadid Oshagan curatorial team. The new upper level includes an expansion of the Special Collections room to accommodate the valuable historical information housed there. This effort to modernize the library's facilities while leaving the architectural heritage intact earned the library a Preservation Award in 2018 from the Los Angeles Conservancy.\nBrand Library & Art Center\nBrand Library & Art Center is the art and music branch of the Glendale Library, Arts & Culture Department. Facilities at Brand Library & Art Center include an art and music library, art galleries and recital hall.\nBrand Library is housed in a mansion built in 1904. Located in Brand Park high in the foothills overlooking Glendale and the San Fernando Valley, the mansion was built by Leslie C. Brand\nReflectSpace\nReflectSpace is an educational exhibition space that has explored the Armenian Genocide, presenting personal as well as reflective narratives, along with topics such as Asian Comfort women, slavery, the Holocaust, Native American genocide in the United States, LGBTQ issues, Internment of Japanese Americans, immigration, and the Incarceration in the United States. With a focus on Glendale and an international perspective, it delves into contemporary issues like displacement, borders, and societal violence, as well as other significant human rights issues.\nReflectSpace is a member of the International Coalition of Sites of Conscience, a global network of historic sites, museums, and memory initiatives that connect past struggles to today’s movements for human rights.\nComputer Services\nGlendale Public Library offers many services to its patrons, both at the Central location as well as its branches.
