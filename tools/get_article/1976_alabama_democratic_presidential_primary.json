In order to choose the state's thirty-five delegates, the state was divided up into twenty-seven delegate districts based on state house lines. Delegate districts were made up by grouping together three to five state house districts, based on their voting strength for national Democratic presidential nominees in 1968 and 1972, with weaker districts containing more House districts. The remaining eight delegates were hand-picked by the state Executive Democratic Committee in proportion to the winner's share of the popular vote. Governor of Alabama George Wallace won a large majority of the state's delegates.\nIn the first round of the primary, nineteen were elected outright, seventeen pledged to Governor George Wallace and two uncommitted, both of whom were Black state legislators. In the runoff, Wallace picked up four more delegates, two more uncommitted delegates were nominated, and Governor of Georgia and eventual nominee Jimmy Carter won his only two district delegates. In response to the primary results, the Committee was set to choose six Wallace delegates, one uncommitted delegate, and one Carter delegate at a convention. Wowever, Wallace withdrew from the race and threw his support behind Carter before the Committee could convene.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable tpl-blanktable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Alabama Democratic presidential primary, 1976\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=2 | Candidate\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=3 | Delegates\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" | Pl.\n!scope=\"col\" | Unpl.\n!scope=\"col\" | Total\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | George Wallace\n| 21 || 6 || 27\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Uncommitted\n| 4 || 1 || 5\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Jimmy Carter\n| 2 || 1 || 3\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Frank Church\n| 0 || 0 || 0\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Fred R.
