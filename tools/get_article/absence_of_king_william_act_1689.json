It did not apply to Scotland or Ireland.\nThe act was passed because, following the Glorious Revolution, the Bill of Rights had enacted that although William and Mary were to reign as joint monarchs (with Mary as a queen regnant, not a mere consort), William alone was to exercise the actual power of government. However William intended to travel to Ireland, and so another act was necessary to provide for the administration of the kingdom while he was abroad.\nThe act declared that \"whensoever and as often as it shall happen that his said Majestie shall be absent or continue out of this Realme of England It shall and may be lawfull for the Queens Majestie to exercise and administer the Regall Power and Government of the Kingdome of England Dominion of Wales and Towne of Berwicke-upon-Tweede and the Plantations and Territories thereunto belonging in the Names of both their Majestyes for such time onely dureing their joynt Lives as his said Majestie shall be absent or continue out of this Realme of England any thing in the said Act [the Bill of Rights] to the contrary notwithstanding\".\nSubsequent developments\nThe whole act was repealed by section 1 of, and the schedule to, the Statute Law Revision Act 1867 (30 & 31 Vict. c. 59).\nNotes\nReferences\n*The Statutes of the Realm, vol. VI, 1819."
