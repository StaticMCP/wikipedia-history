It entered into force on April 28, 2005. It aims at harmonizing and streamlining formal procedures such as the requirements to obtain a filing date for a patent application, the form and content of a patent application, and representation. The treaty \"does not establish a uniform procedure for all parties to the PLT but leaves parties free to require fewer or more user-friendly requirements than those provided in the PLT.\" As of February 2023, the PLT had 43 contracting states.\nHistory\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:35%; height:200px\" border=\"1\" align=\"right\"\n|+ Contracting States to the Patent Law Treaty and dates of entry into force\n! style=\"width:130px\" |Date\n!
