Drawing on underwater surveys, sediment-core reconstructions, ancient DNA, and high-resolution archaeology, it shows how exposed Late Pleistocene shelves sustained Proto-Sangam canoe networks (~10–7 ka BP); how an autonomous Iron Revolution at Sivagalai and Adichanallur (~5.3–4.9 ka BP) enabled canal-fed cultivation with iron tools two millennia before the Hittite Iron Age; and how multistage bloomery and crucible steel production at Thelunganur (c. 1435–890 BCE) marked the earliest known high-carbon steelmaking in South Asia; and how fully integrated Bronze Age ports linked to Mesopotamia, Egypt, Zhou China, and Southeast Asia.\nSangam texts such as Pattinappalai describe— Yavana ships unload gold, wine, and luxury wares at Kaveripoompattinam (Poompuhar), where Greeks, Romans, and West Asians barter with Tamil merchants during Tamilakam’s late development phase. Although William Dalrymple’s The Golden Road: How Ancient India Transformed the World (September 2024) situates Indo-Roman commerce as flourishing from the 1st century CE onward, this paper demonstrates that Sangam Tamilakam was already integrated into Mediterranean and West Asian maritime networks by the 3rd–2nd centuries BCE.\nSeasonal enclaves at Arikamedu, Alagankulam, and Poompuhar—attested by amphorae, rouletted ware, and Indo-Roman coins—underscore Tamilakam’s deep integration into transoceanic exchange centuries before European arrival. Submerged hubs at Poompuhar and Khambhāt, aceramic farming at Mehrgarh, and ASI genetic continuum from Mehrgarh to Tamilakam demonstrate parallel southern and northwestern innovations. Mid-Holocene sea-level rise spurred deltaic reorientation, fuelling agrarian surpluses at Keezhadi and Adichanallur that anchored early urbanism. The environmental-bridge framework (Section 4) demonstrates how gradual coastal transgression acted as a dynamic conduit between maritime-agrarian nodes and inland riverine networks.\nThis paper also addresses the long-overlooked primacy of India’s Iron Age, where early research often calibrated South Asian timelines against Mesopotamian and Levantine benchmarks. This led to a default assumption that iron metallurgy diffused from the Hittites (c. 1200 BCE) or Anatolia—rather than emerging locally in Tamilakam and spreading northward along the Dravidian Arc, including the Deccan Plateau and Andhra Pradesh.\nIt further proposes that the Indus Valley Civilization emerged through a strategic inland relocation, catalysed by catastrophic coastal submergence along the western and southern littorals—an upheaval memorialised in Kumari Kandam traditions of southern Dravidian groups/Tamilakam and the Manu legend of northern Dravidian groups seeking new homelands. This dual displacement catalysed inland settlement and ultimately the historically recognised emergence of the Indus Valley Civilization.\nBy integrating genetic, symbolic, metallurgical, agrarian, and maritime evidence, the Dravidian Arc challenges Mesopotamia’s—and more recently Anatolia’s—claims as sole cradles of civilization, reestablishing Southern Tamilakam as a self-directed nexus of agrarian, metallurgical, and maritime innovation. As outlined in the Overview section, this methodological critique of entrenched funding priorities, institutional frameworks, and historiographical traditions underpins our analytical framework. The paper concludes by advocating stratified offshore coring, targeted aDNA/isotopic campaigns, and high-resolution stratigraphy to refine this deep-time chronology—and secure the Dravidian Arc’s rightful recognition among humanity’s foundational civilizational theatres.\n1. Paleo-Shelf & Early Coastal–Inland Maritime Nodes (15–9 ka BP)\nSection 1 situates Ancient India’s Dravidian Arc’s deep-time roots on the Late Pleistocene shelf, defining “proto-urban” as emergent communal hubs, “maritime node” as a precursor port, and “Tamilkilam” as the southern estuarine network.\n·       Indian Subcontinent Exposed Shelf Corridor (~15–9 ka BP): As reconstructed from paleogeographic sea-level models and supported by marine stratigraphy, sea levels around the Indian subcontinent ~15 ka BP stood approximately 120 meters below present, gradually rising to –40 meters by ~9 ka BP. This exposed continental shelf formed a continuous terrestrial corridor linking Ilaṅkai (Sri Lanka) to the Arabian Sea coast of the Indian subcontinent. According to the NIOT coastal survey this landmass sustained Late Pleistocene shellfish gatherers, cold-steppe foragers, and estuarine communities across what is now a submerged cultural landscape.\n·       Gulf of Khambhāt Complex (Southern & Northern Metropolises): Marine surveys conducted by the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), led by geologist Badrinaryan, B in his published paper (2006) revealed a vast submerged urban grid beneath the Gulf of Khambhāt, spanning approximately 8 × 3 km. Side-scan sonar and sub-bottom profiler data documented rectilinear foundations, pottery, beads, and structural alignments—alongside citadel-like platforms (200 × 45 m), stepped bathing tanks, granaries, and canal systems —comparable in layout to Harrapan cities layout in later Indus Valley Civilisation (IVC). Human remains dated to ~9.5 ka BP confirm Early Holocene habitation, while OSL and thermoluminescence analysis on deeper hearths support initial activity dating back to ~13–15 ka BP, pending stratified excavation. Lower quay walls likely succumbed to rising sea levels around ~11.5 ka BP, but ridge-top communities persisted until the Mid-Holocene highstand (~7 ka BP), after which partial inundation spurred coastal populations to adopt mixed economies along emerging deltaic margins. These findings point to continuous occupation from the Late Pleistocene, signal a proto-urban maritime culture predating the Indus Valley Civilization, and mark the Gulf of Khambhāt as a foundational northwestern node in the Sangam-era Dravidian Arc.\nNIOT scan pictures available from published paper by Badrinaryan, B (2006), NIOT Gulf of Cambay: Cradle of Ancient Civilization.\nNIOT preliminary dating of submerged Khambhāt extracted finds (2001–2004):\n* NGRI (Hyderabad) – Radiocarbon (14C) – 2001 – Wood and charcoal samples\n* BSIP (Lucknow) – Radiocarbon (14C) – 2001 – Wood samples\n* PRL (Ahmedabad) – Thermoluminescence (TL) and Radiocarbon – 2001–2003 – Pottery and charcoal samples\n* Manipur University – Thermoluminescence (TL) and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) – 2002–2003 – Sediment and pottery samples\n* Oxford University – Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) – 2003 – Burial sediment samples\n* Deccan College (Pune) – X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) – 2003–2004 – Mineral composition analysis for artefact validation\n·       Proto-Poompuhar (Proto-Sangam Coastal Node): Initial geophysical surveys by S.R. Rao’s NIO team in the 1980s flagged submerged side-scan anomalies off the ancient Kaveri delta. More recently, Bharathidasan University–NIOT multibeam and side-scan mapping (2019–23) delivered high-resolution bathymetry, revealing submerged estuarine camps at 20–30 m depths—features that suggest human activity dating back to ~15 ka BP, including shellfish harvesting, mangrove timber extraction, and canoe exchange (BBC Tamil News images below; see Section 2 for mapping details). These early lifeways echo the Indus–Harappan fisheries at Lothal and, alongside the Gulf of Khambhat complex, rank among South Asia’s earliest submerged settlements within the Dravidian Arc network.\nPictures from BBC Tamil News, India. Courtesy: Bharathidasan University and NIOT sonar studies. A 2025 collaborative study by Bharathidasan University and the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT)—commissioned by the Government of Tamil Nadu—employed advanced marine instruments, including Multi-Beam Echo Sounders (MBES), Sub-bottom Profilers, and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), to digitally reconstruct submerged cultural architecture off the Poombuhar coast. The findings lend empirical support to Sangam-era accounts of coastal settlements lost to the sea.\nHistorical Context: Poompuhar —historically known as Kaveripoompattinam during the Sangam period — figures prominently in foundational Tamil texts such as Pattinappalai and the epic Manimekalai. These works depict the city’s stature as a maritime capital with advanced urban planning and ritual infrastructure. Crucially, Manimekalai (verses 200–201) documents its abrupt disappearance: “Aninagar thannai alaikadal kolkena…” —\n“The city of Kaveripoompattinam was engulfed by the roaring sea.”\nThe submergence is cast as divine retribution for neglecting Indra Vizha, as conveyed by Manimekala. This poetic account aligns with sonar-based evidence of offshore structures, merging literary memory with geophysical data. Silappathikaram (early CE), opening in Puhar, extends this remembrance — reaffirming the city’s ritual centrality and preserving echoes of earlier traditions, including spatial detail and Indra Vizha. The continuity underscores Kaveripoompattinam’s enduring status and the narrative shift from maritime ethnography to ritual allegory.\n·       Southern River Systems (“Tamilakam”): The Kaveri and Vaigai distributaries attracted foragers to estuarine shell beds and mangrove zones, supporting proto-sedentary camps as early as ~14 ka BP (e.g. radiocarbon-dated shell middens at Nagarjunakonda). These coastal aggregations—collectively termed Tamilakam—anchor the Dravidian Arc’s southern node.\n·       Early Agricultural Villages at Mehrgarh (~9 ka BP): The aceramic Neolithic site on the Kacchi Plain (c. 7000 BCE) evidences early domestication of wheat, barley, sheep, goats, and zebu cattle. These pioneer farmers contributed to the genetic and cultural foundations of the broader Dravidian Arc. Furthermore, Ancient-DNA (Narasimhan et al. 2019; Shinde et al. 2019) confirms uninterrupted ASI continuity from Mehrgarh’s Neolithic through early Iron-Age Tamilakam, with only minor Iran-Neolithic admixture entering after ca 3500 BCE—well after local crop domestication and iron‐tool–driven cultivation was already under way (see below for Iran-N influx).\n·       Genetic Signatures: Admixture models date the arrival of Iranian-Neolithic (Iran_N)—synchronous with Mehrgarh’s Neolithic onset. In the absence of direct Mehrgarh aDNA, these analyses infer gene flow between incoming Iran_N lineages and indigenous proto-Dravidian AASI populations (M130 carriers)—M130 haplogroup carriers who first settled the subcontinent roughly 50,000–70,000 years ago. Indus Valley Civilisation (IVC) periphery individuals (e.g., the Rakhigarhi genome, 2600–1900 BCE) display a balanced admixture of ~45–60 % AASI versus 40–55 % Iran_N. Narasimhan et al. (2019) date the primary AASI–Iran_N admixture pulse that formed the “Indus Periphery Cline” to ca. 5400–3700 BCE, underlining AASI persistence in the northern Dravidian Arc before the post-2000 BCE Steppe influx. While direct Tamilakam aDNA is expected by 2025–26, proxy data from IVC-margin contexts and first-millennium BCE sediments point to continued proto-Dravidian AASI dominance (~90–95 % AASI, 5–10 % Iran_N) in Iron Age Tamilakam. Coastal forager groups along the Palk Strait likely mirrored these admixture patterns, creating a north–south AASI cline, with AASI- and ASI-rich ancestries more pronounced in modern Vedda and certain south Indian tribal genomes. Furthermore, ancient-DNA studies (Narasimhan et al. 2019; Shinde et al. 2019) confirm uninterrupted ASI continuity across the Neolithic and early Iron Age phases, with minor Iran-Neolithic–related admixture entering only after ca. 3500 BCE—subsequent to the onset of indigenous crop domestication and iron-tool cultivation in Tamilakam, thereby validating its autonomous agrarian and metallurgical trajectory. Note that Ancestral South Indian (ASI) ancestry for the Indian subcontinent Dravidian Arc emerges from the varying admixture composition of the indigenous AASI and Iranian-Neolithic lineages along the Arc from its Neolithic onset until the post-2000 BCE Steppe influx and IVC refugia migrations southwards during their decline phase.\n[Genetic market M130 (AASI) identified in Madurai, Tamil Nadu. Photograph reproduced from Peoples and Cultures of Early Sri Lanka, by Dr S. Thiagararajah]\n·       Archaeological Signals: Stone tools, hearth lenses, and ephemeral camps on drowned ridges attest to a dynamic forager–fisher–canoe nexus across the exposed shelf.\n·       Pan-Indian Rock Art: From Bhimbetka’s Upper Palaeolithic paintings to Kupgal’s Neolithic petroglyphs, these symbolic motifs reflect a peninsula-wide ritual tradition that predates pottery and metallurgy.\n2. Proto-Sangam and Dravidian Arc Emergence (~10–5 ka BP)\nSection 2 addresses early cultural, genetic, and subsistence nodes across the Dravidian Arc—including Mehrgarh, Chopani-Mando, the Belan Valley, Paiyampalli, and Tamilakam—which share deep Ancestral South Indian (ASI) genetic threads and parallel agro-technological traditions. While some sites lie beyond classic Tamilakam, their ecological settings, symbolic motifs, and genomic profiles place them firmly within the Arc’s extended spine. This section reconstructs how ASI-linked forager–cultivator societies adapted to deltaic transgressions, seeded proto-urban hubs, and diversified coastal economies—laying the foundational grammar for later Iron-Age intensification.\n·       Gulf of Khambhāt Emergent Urbanism (Northern Metropolis): Building on the northern sector of the Gulf of Khambhāt submerged site in Section 1—assessed by the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) under Badrinaryan, B (2006) by ~9500–7500 BP, the scan reveals the planned urban features, submerged under 20–40 meters of water, and reflect early urban planning in response to rising seas.\nAs the Mid-Holocene transgression progressed, the palaeo-ridges of the Gulf of Khambhāt became true islands. Lower quay walls likely succumbed to rising waters by ~11.5 ka BP, but ridge-top communities endured until the ~7.3–6.8 ka BP highstand, after which full submergence prompted coastal populations to adopt mixed economies along emerging deltaic margins. Their rectilinear foundations hosted communal gatherings of an estimated 5 000–10 000 people—based on core port-city densities of 200–400 people/km², evidence for quay walls and mooring points, and provisioning by dozens of kilometre-scale agricultural and forager sites across the exposed shelf. Such a population magnitude is remarkable for its time. During this period, Ilaṅkai remained connected to mainland India until ~9–8 ka BP, facilitating canoe networks and ecological exchange. As transgression unfolded, coastal communities diversified subsistence—combining estuarine fishing with early cultivation and herding—mirroring developments along Tamilakam’s deltaic margins. By ~8 ka BP, Ilaṅkai had become a distinct island, with canoe-based exchange across the narrowing Palk Strait paralleling inter-island trade among the Gulf’s vestigial islands. Over time, sustained contact may have culminated in the formation of a shallow causeway—later known as Ram Setu or Adam’s Bridge—a chain of shoals and sandbanks partially walkable until the 15th century (see Section 11 for satellite-imagery evidence of a manmade structure). Early Islamic geographers, including Al-Biruni (c. 1030 CE), referenced this land bridge, which was likely rendered impassable by a cyclone around 1480 CE.\n[see pictures  from EXPRESS.CO.UK, 9 Dec, 2020: India’s 9,500-year-old underwater lost city; and GIF Coastal map (crude sketch)]\n·       Proto-Sangam Poompuhar (Emergent Coastal Hub at Kaveri Delta, ~7–5 ka BP):\nBuilding on the drowned estuarine camps and lobate-delta formations of Section 1 (~15 ka BP) and Sangam texts attributed name for ancient port of Poompuhar as Kaveripoompattinam, this phase marks the emergence of organized maritime infrastructure at the ancient Kaveri mouth:\n·       Refined multibeam and sub-bottom profiling (Bharathidasan University–NIOT, 2020–22) build upon S.R. Rao’s 1980s NIO side-scan anomalies and specifically document spiral pillar remnants and circular stone bases from this recent survey work.\n·       A submerged harbour zone 30–50 km offshore at 30–100 m depths feature terracotta ring-wells and brick platforms atop stabilized promontories, rectilinear dock alignments, and canal-like trenches linking settlement clusters.\n·       Spiral pillar remnants and circular stone bases are interpreted as early proto-lighthouse foundations—among the earliest known in the region—though their precise function remains debated.\n·       When tied to post-glacial sea-level reconstructions (e.g., Rohling, Lambeck), which chart a rise from –15 m to near modern between 7–5 ka BP, the bathymetric form indicates a proto-port phase circa 7000–5000 BCE (see table2.1 for Poompuhar’s ancient deep timeline).\n·       These deep-time lifeways at Poompuhar prefigure later Sangam port planning and resonate with Khambhāt and pre-Lothal maritime models.\n·       Under Tamil Nadu’s 2025–26 archaeology budget, stratified offshore trenching and coring between Poompuhar and Nagapattinam will empirically test these mid-Holocene dates.\n·       A subsequent Chola-period wharf and lighthouse base—first uncovered in 1981 and now exhibited at Poompuhar’ s Underwater Archaeological Site Museum—attests to the site’s enduring civic-planning logic from Proto-Sangam origins through classical port urbanism (see table2.1 for Poompuhar’s proposed proto-lighthouse timeline).\n·       Refer to Section 4 and Section 12 for Tamil Nadu’s 2025–26 approved archaeology budgeted plans for detailed stratified offshore coring and ROV imaging.\nTable 2.1 Timeline Matrix for Ancient Submerged Poompuhar\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Phase\n|Date BP\n|Key Features\n|Inheritance from Previous Phase\n|-\n|Section 1: Proto-Poompuhar A\n|~15,000\n|Drowned estuarine camps, lobate-delta formations, ring-wells, canoe exchange zones\n|Establishes deltaic promontories and subsurface terraces\n|-\n|Section 1B: Transitional Poompuhar B\n|~9,000–7,000\n|NW–SE ridges, rectilinear depressions, canal-linked terraces, early seawall formations\n|Resettlement atop delta-B as delta-A submerges; introduces proto-urban grid logic\n|-\n|Section 2: Proto-Sangam Poompuhar C\n|7,000–5,000\n|Terracotta ring-wells & brick platforms, rectilinear docks, canal-trenches, spiral pillar bases (proto-lighthouse)\n|Builds ports atop Section 1’s stabilized promontories and channels\n|}\nNote: The 2025 study by Sasilatha et al., published in Remote Sensing in Earth Systems Sciences, digitally reconstructs submerged harbour structures and trade networks at Poompuhar, reinforcing the phased evolution and maritime inheritance model outlined in Table 2.1. It builds upon and extends the sonar and bathymetric findings of Ramasamy et al. (2020), integrating them into a broader framework of Sangam-era urban planning and transoceanic exchange.\n·       Deltaic Outposts (“Tamilakam Extension”): By ~9 ka BP, the Kaveri and Vaigai distributaries had coalesced into broad, fertile alluvial fans, drawing foragers to estuarine shell beds and mangrove ecotones. These proto-settlements served as year-round aggregation hubs. By ~8–7 ka BP, Tamilakam’s deltaic outposts on the Kaveri–Vaigai floodplains were trialling pulse–millet cultivation and rudimentary canal systems—agronomic innovations that underpinned provisioning of emerging maritime hubs like Khambhāt and Poompuhar—thereby extending the Arc’s southern spine and laying the ecological and cultural groundwork for later Sangam-era urbanism (see Section 2 for paleo-bathymetry and coring details).\n·       Mesolithic Shelters: Rock-shelter pictographs in the Kalrayan and Jeypore Hills (c. 10–8 ka BP) depict humans, deer, and geometric motifs—echoing Bhimbetka and suggesting shared ritual landscapes across peninsular India.\n·       Maritime Network: Paddle-stone graffiti, rectilinear foundations, and shell-bead workshops hint at a ~10,000-year-old Sangam cultural web—linking inland foragers, coastal mariners, and offshore ridge-island dwellers.\n·       Seasonal Harbours: These ridge-islands and shoreline coves functioned as hubs for mangrove timber, estuarine fisheries, salt production, and inter-island exchange—supporting a diversified and resilient coastal economy.\n·       Beyond Fishing: Proto-Poompuhar and similar sites likely hosted canoe-builders, shell artisans, and salt harvesters—facilitating both local provisioning and small-scale trade with inland forest groups and coastal Ilaṅkai.\n·       Mehrgarh Parallel: Building on Section 1, Mehrgarh (in today’s Balochistan) from ~9 to 5.5 ka B transformed from an early farming village into a ceramic-rich agrarian hub during Periods II–III (c. 7000–5500 BCE). This phase features more advanced cultivation practices, refined pottery, and symbolic artifacts—beads, figurines, and burial goods—signalling a subcontinental shift toward sedentism and surplus economies. Tamilakam’s coastal foragers and estuarine settlers likely followed parallel trajectories within their own ecological niches, marking a pan-peninsular Neolithic horizon that prefigured both the Indus and Sangam worlds (see Section 2 for the vertical Dravidian Arc Neolithic Cultivation.\n·       Foundations for Iron-Aided Intensification (7–5 ka BP): Tamilakam remains under-excavated, albeit recent digs have uncovered revolutionary iron implements that build on this Neolithic base and Tamil Nadu’s 2025 radiometric program—combining – Accelerator-Mass Spectrometry (^14C-AMS) on charcoal and organic remains (Beta Analytic; IUAC) – Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) on ceramics (PRL Ahmedabad; BSIP Lucknow) – Thermoluminescence (TL) on slag—has pushed bloomery iron into the early 4th millennium BCE, directly tying it to a pulse-and-millet agrarian economy first rooted by 7000–6000 BCE:\n* At Adichanallur & Sivagalai (3345–2953 BCE), ^14C-AMS on urn charcoal and paddy, corroborated by OSL on interred pottery, dates bloomery furnaces alongside iron plough tines, hoe-heads and ritual implements.\n* At Mayiladumparai (c. 2172 BCE), ^14C-AMS on bloomery debris—supported by Single-Aliquot Regenerative-Dose (SAR) OSL on associated ware—secures local production of iron blades in the Vaigai Basin foothills.\nThis scientifically anchored dates demonstrate continuity with Tamilakam’s Neolithic pulse-and-millet tradition rather than an abrupt external rupture. For a full discussion of how these tools catalysed iron-aided cultivation across the Dravidian Arc, see Section 3: “Dawn of the Sangam Iron Revolution (6–5 ka BP).\n·       Dravidian Arc Neolithic Cultivation (8–5 ka BP): Radiocarbon-confirmed barley and wheat at Mehrgarh (8000–6000 BCE) parallel pulses (Vigna, Lens) and small-grain millets at Paiyampalli (7000–6000 BCE), as well as wild-rice trials and incipient paddying at Chopani-Mando and Mahagara in the Belan Valley (c. 5000 BCE)—early subsistence systems that mirrored developments in Tamilakam’s deltaic zones. Later rice-husk and paddy processing at Lothal and Rangpur (c. 2600 BCE) bridged the northern and southern flanks of the Arc, reinforcing post-submergence connectivity between the Gujarat coast and the Tamil estuarine hubs. These data demonstrate that local Dravidian Arc communities cultivated pulses and millets long before the diffusion of Fertile Crescent domesticates—first domesticated c. 10,000–6500 BCE in Southwest Asia—and prior to the detectable but relatively minor presence of the Anatolian–Iranian Neolithic genetic signature in South India, which appeared only after the region had already initiated indigenous pulse-millet cultivation and iron-tool intensification. This chronology underscores Tamilakam’s largely autonomous agrarian and metallurgical evolution, rather than one shaped by external diffusion. These coeval agro-foraging traditions laid the groundwork for Tamilakam’s eventual iron-powered agrarian systems at Sivagalai (~3300 BCE), though earlier cultivation may extend back to 7–8 ka BP; stratified dating across the Deccan and Ghats remains sparse and ongoing (see Section 11). Such genetic continuity further corroborates that Tamilakam’s pulse-millet systems and canal-fed cultivation (~8–5 ka BP) arose within AASI-dominant populations—well before significant Iran_N admixture—affirming a culturally endogenous Neolithic trajectory along the Arc.\n3. Dawn of Sangam led Iron Age Revolution (6–5 ka BP)\n·       Early Bloomery Breakthroughs & Technological Autonomy (c. 5.3–4.9 ka BP): AMS and OSL analyses at Sivagalai (3345–2953 BCE) and slags from Adichanallur, Mayiladumparai, Kilnamandi, Mangadu, and Thelunganur confirm high-temperature, multi-stage iron production—two millennia ahead of the Hittite Iron Age. These radiometric anchors position Tamilakam’s Iron Age in the early 4th millennium BCE and underscore an indigenous metallurgical tradition that arose independently of West Asian influence. Further investigation—particularly at submerged coastal hubs and under-sampled inland ridges—may extend this Iron horizon into the mid-Holocene (c. 5000–6000 BCE), revealing a pre-Chalcolithic Iron Revolution.\n[see picture from Excavations at Sivagalai and Iron-Age finds by courtesy of GOVERNMENT OF TAMIL NADU, DEPARTMENT OF ARCHAEOLOGY]\nTamil Nadu Department of Archaeology: Excavation Dating for Sivagalai and Adichanallur dating analyses were conducted at the following institutions:\n* BETA Analytic (Miami, USA) – Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) Radiocarbon – 2021–2024 – Charcoal and paddy grain samples\n* Arizona AMS Facility (University of Arizona) – AMS Radiocarbon – 2019–2021 – Iron sword from Thelunganur\n* Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences (Lucknow) – Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) – 2023 – Ceramic sherds\n* Physical Research Laboratory (Ahmedabad) – OSL – 2023 – Ceramic sherds\n* Inter-University Accelerator Centre (IUAC, New Delhi) – AMS Radiocarbon – 2022–2023 – Paddy and millet samples recovered from burial urns\n* Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR, Kalpakkam) – X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) – 2022–2024 – High-tin bronze artefacts from Adichanallur\nExcavations at Sivagalai and Iron-Age finds (courtesy of Government of Tamil Nadu, Department of Archaeology, 2025) demonstrate that Tamilakam’s archaeology remains in its infancy; ongoing digs may push its agricultural origins even further back.\n·      Vertical Arc Convergence of Metallurgy and Proto-Sangam Urbanism: Building on those multistage smelts the emergence and spatial–chronological distribution of pre-1000 BCE Iron Age sites across the Dravidian Arc reveal a multi-nodal pattern of vertical-arc convergence (see Table 3.1). Iron bloomery technology radiates from coastal Tamilakam (Sangam lands) into highland foothills, river valleys, and floodplain corridors—fuelling agrarian intensification and proto-urban growth well before external diffusion models predict.\nTable 3.1: Iron-Age Convergence Timeline Along the Dravidian Arc (from 1000 BCE)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Dravidian Arc Excavation Sites\n|Eco-Corridor / Region/ Influence\n|Dating (BCE)\n|Key Findings & Convergence Indicators\n|-\n|Sivagalai\n|Vaigai–Tāmirabarani Delta (Tamil Nadu)\n|3345–2953 (AMS ¹⁴C); 2590–2427 (OSL)\n|Earliest high-temperature, multi-stage bloomery smelting; iron chisels, plough tines and hoes in urn burials\n|-\n|Adichanallur\n|Vaigai–Tāmirabarani Delta (Tamil Nadu)\n|2522 (AMS ¹⁴C)\n|Early bloomery smelting in urn burials; ritual iron implements (sickles, ploughshares) driving pulses/millet harvest\n|-\n|Mayiladumparai\n|Vaigai Basin – Western Ghats Foothills (Krishnagiri dist.)\n|2172 (AMS ¹⁴C)\n|Iron blades and bloomery slag in habitation-cum-burial contexts; evidence of localized production\n|-\n|Gachibowli\n|Deccan Plateau Corridor (Telangana)\n|c. 2200\n|Iron tools in megalithic burials; charred millet residues imply agrarian linkage\n|-\n|Brahmagiri\n|Malaprabha Valley (Karnataka)\n|c. 2140\n|Iron arrowheads and chisels in cist-circle burials; megalithic mortuary tradition with slag inclusions\n|-\n|Kilnamandi\n|Eastern Ghats Foothills (Tamil Nadu)\n|1692 (AMS ¹⁴C)\n|Multi-stage bloomery slag and tuyère fragments in burial contexts; localized smelting traditions\n|-\n|Mangadu\n|Coromandel Coast Fringe (Tamil Nadu)\n|1510 (AMS ¹⁴C)\n|Sword-hilt charcoal and bloom residue; evidence for small-scale iron forging\n|-\n|Veerapuram\n|Godavari Delta Fringe (Andhra Pradesh)\n|c. 1300\n|Iron sickles and mattocks in megalithic graves; strong agrarian-tool connections\n|-\n|Komaranahalli\n|Woodland Plains Corridor (Karnataka)\n|c. 1100 (TL)\n|Slag-tapping furnaces and extensive slag heaps; sustained local smelting technology\n|-\n|Thelunganur\n|Western Ghats Foothills (Tamil Nadu)\n|c. 1435–890 BCE (AMS ¹⁴C)\n|Earliest ultrahigh-carbon steel(0.9–1.3 wt % C) from crucible fragments; advanced multi-stage steelmaking\n|}\nTable Sources: K. Rajan & R. Sivanantham, Antiquity of Iron: Recent Radiometric Dates from Tamil Nadu, Government of Tamil Nadu (Chennai, 2025).\nOther verified Iron Age nodes not listed in Table 3.1 include Lahuradeva, Raja Nāla-ka-Tila, Malhar, Atranjikhera, Pandurājār Dhībi, and Ilaṅkai (Delft Island, Pomparippu)—each producing iron slag, bloom fragments, or diagnostic implements such as sickles, ploughshares, and chisels used in agrarian contexts from stratified deposits dated to c. 1200–1000 BCE or earlier. Additional pre-1000 BCE centres such as Hallūr further bolster the evidence for a pan-subcontinental Iron Revolution in agriculture and proto-urbanism. Thelunganur’s crucible furnaces operated from c. 1435–1233 BCE, yielding ultrahigh-carbon crucible-steel (0.9–1.3 wt % C), with a steel sword fragment securely dated to c. 890 BCE and likely earlier (By contrast to Hittite bloomery blooms only dated to have trace carburization c. 1000 BCE —and to this corpus we must add the Southern-Arc wind-powered slag-tapping furnaces at Samanalawewa in Ilaṅkai with high-carbon steel fragments (c. 300 BCE) (See below), affirming the Southern Arc’s autonomous and advanced metallurgical sophistication—attesting to both its early innovation and prolonged use. Plotting these nodes alongside early port evidence at Poompuhar reveals how indigenous iron technology propelled agricultural intensification and emerging urban centres, validating their inclusion in the vertical-convergence-arc framework.\n·       Field Excavation & Agrarian Continuity (c. 5.3–0.9 ka BP): AMS and OSL dates from Beta Analytics, BSIP, and PRL Ahmedabad on Sivagalai slag and tool samples (c. 3300 BCE), excavated plough tines and hoe heads at Sivagalai, bloomery residues at Adichanallur (c. 2600 BCE), and iron sickle blades and ploughshares (c. 905–696 BCE) mark the first extensive iron-aided cultivation in Tamilakam. Excavated implements at Sivagalai and Adichanallur (c. 3300–2500 BCE) further attest to widespread agrarian intensification rooted in AASI-rich demographics; aDNA indicates that significant (>5 %) Iran_N-derived admixture doesn’t appear until after c. 3500 BCE, and then only in northern-arc sites, validating Tamilakam’s autonomous metallurgical and agricultural progression well before external admixture. Building on Neolithic agro-foraging traditions (7–8 ka BP), this breakthrough drove canal construction, field levelling, and a 30–50 % yield boost—spurring demographic expansion, surplus production, permanent settlements, and proto-urban complexity (see Table 12.1). When paired with archaeobotanical data from Mehrgarh (barley, wheat; 7000–5500 BCE), Paiyampalli (pulses, millets; 7000–6000 BCE), and Chopani-Mando (wild-rice trials; c. 5000 BCE), Tamilakam emerges as a leading case for an independent agrarian intensification trajectory that both predates and intermittently overlaps Fertile Crescent cereals and Anatolian urban models.\n·       Technological transmission from Tamilakam to Southern-Arc’s Ilaṅkai: Six sentinel sites trace the direct diffusion of Iron Age innovations from Tamilakam into Ilaṅkai (Sri Lanka’s) agrarian and architectural spheres:\n* Delft Island (c. 1200–1000 BCE, provisional): iron sickles, blades, and plough tips in megalithic burials demonstrate locally produced tools for tillage and harvesting, suggesting on-site metallurgy predating 1000 BCE.\n* Pomparippu (c. 1000–800 BCE): urn burials in the North-Western Province yielded microliths alongside iron sickles and chisels, showing rapid incorporation of metal implements into both farming practices and complex funerary rites.\n* Sigiriya (998–848 BCE): radiocarbon-dated smelting slag aligns with Tamilakam’s bloomery traditions, confirming parallel development of iron production in a riverine upland setting.\n* Anuradhapura (930–800 BCE): slag concentrations at the citadel attest to the swift adoption of Tamilakam-style smelting techniques within an emerging proto-urban centre.\n* Monsoon-driven furnaces at Samanalawewa (c. 300 BCE) produced high-carbon steel, verified through slag analysis and thermodynamic modelling; this aligns with Juleff’s 1996 Nature paper, which demonstrated wind-powered smelting as a viable indigenous technology. The parallels with Tamilakam’s early bloomery iron suggest a shared metallurgical continuum across the Southern Arc, reinforcing autonomous innovation rather than diffusion.\n* Mihintale (3rd century BCE): iron wedges used in a pyro-mechanical granite-splitting method at Mahinda’s temple reveal how agricultural metallurgy informed monumental architecture.\n* Outliers: Beragala (c. 2400 BCE) – where isolated slag fragments hint at proto-Iron Age smelting, but the lack of in-situ charcoal or multi-method dating keeps these early traces provisional until detailed stratigraphic analysis; and Kanniya hot water wells, where early iron technology may have been applied in hydrothermal engineering (c 1580 BCE) – see Future Research Priorities for further investigation\n·       These independent smelting-to-farming sequences occur across coastal, riverine, and upland zones—and overlap chronologically—embodying the vertical convergence of metallurgy and agriculture, validating their inclusion in the Dravidian vertical-convergence-arc framework.\n·       Section Synthesis: Radiometric dates, techno-genetic evidence, and diffusion patterns over five to six millennia demonstrate that Tamilakam pioneered indigenous iron production and agrarian intensification—and exported these breakthroughs along the Dravidian Arc, from its Sangam heartland to Ilaṅkai—thereby challenging traditional diffusionist models and highlighting an autonomous civilizational trajectory.\n4. Mid- to Late-Holocene Coastal Collapse & Maritime Reorientation (7–4.5 ka BP)\n·       Terminal Submergence (c. 7–5.5 ka BP): Rising sea levels completely submerged the 8 × 3 km ridge-platform in the Gulf of Khambhāt by ~7 ka BP (see section 2 GIF Coastal Map), leaving only 2–4 km² of shoals until ~5.5–4.5 ka BP (as confirmed by NIOT sonar surveys; 2025 artefact and skeletal dates). These drowned ridges mark the end of South Asia’s earliest offshore communal settlements and signal an ecological rupture across the Dravidian Arc.\n·       Inland Surge (c. 7–4.5 ka BP): Staple surpluses from Southern-Arc Sangam-era Sivagalai’s iron-tool agriculture underwrote the rapid growth of interior proto-urban centres as Khambhāt’s coastal settlements drowned—much like Lothal. Sites such as Madurai (as preserved in Sangam lore), Keezhadi, and Adichanallur emerged as inland civic hubs, paralleling contemporaneous urban expansion across the Western and Northern Arc in Indus cities like Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Rakhigarhi. These surpluses enabled occupational specialization, civic stratification, and the institutional scaffolding of Tamilakam’s early polities.\n·       Deltaic Port Genesis (c. 6–4.5 ka BP): As inland surpluses flowed downstream, new coastal nodes emerged in the Tamirabarani and Kaveri deltas. Korkai transformed into a seasonal redistribution centre—its pearl-rich estuaries, salt pans and canoe-accessible channels underpinning early exchange with Ilaṅkai and the Maldives.\n·       Maritime Reorientation (c. 6–4.5 ka BP): The drowning of ridge-islands redirected Tamilakam’s seafaring focus to river-mouth deltas and estuarine harbours. Canoe-based trade, shell-bead manufacture and salt-fish commerce flourished in these new coastal ecologies—laying the economic and spatial groundwork for later port urbanism\n·       Poompuhar Expanded Sangam Urbanism (c. 7–5 ka BP): Building on Section 1 and 2 the preliminary side-scan sonar anomalies flagged by S.R. Rao’s 1980s NIO missions have been spectacularly refined by Bharathidasan University–NIOT multibeam and sub-bottom surveys (2019–23), delineating a submerged harbour 30–40 km offshore at 30–100 m depths. Linear wharves, canal-like trenches, pier-wall alignments, and “proto-lighthouse” foundations—when tied to IPCC sea-level curves—point to a sustained maritime node ca. 7000–5000 BCE (Table 12.2). Under Tamil Nadu’s 2025–26 archaeology budget, stratified offshore coring, ROV imaging, and diver-assisted trenching between Poompuhar and Nagapattinam will recover datable sediments and artefacts, empirically anchoring Poompuhar’s mid-Holocene civic-planning lineage and prefiguring a classical Sangam-era port by ca. 5 ka BP—marking the shift to permanent maritime urbanism (See Section 12 Excavation Note).\n·       Section Synthesis: This phase bridges Mid-Holocene environmental upheaval and Iron-Age innovation, as coastal collapse funnels iron-powered agrarian surpluses into new inland proto-urban centres (Madurai, Keezhadi) and redirects maritime lifeways to deltaic ports (Korkai, Poompuhar), thereby setting the stage for fully integrated Classical Sangam urbanism.\n5. Indus–Sangam Tamilakam’s Arc Interface (4.5–1.5 ka BP)\n·       Submergence Trauma and Mythic Memory: This paper proposes that catastrophic coastal inundations along the western and southern littorals—Holocene events occurring between ~9.5 and ~7 ka BP—provoked strategic inland resettlement, a trauma echoed in Kumari Kandam narratives and the northern Dravidian Manu myth (see Section 7 for details). The Indus Valley complex may have emerged via an adaptive leap to upland refugia, while southern Tamilakam witnessed coastal populations migrating toward interior riverine basins—laying the ecological and cultural foundations for polities that later flourished in Sangam-era centres. Although present-day Madurai is canonically associated with the Third Sangam, its connection to the submerged Ten Madurai (First Sangam) and Kapadapuram (Second Sangam) remains inferential. Yet, if the advocated stratigraphy confirms that Madurai’s civic core predates Keezhadi (~580 BCE), it could rival—or even precede—the Indus Valley’s multi-city horizon (~3300 BCE), reshaping prevailing models of urban origin. This paper therefore advocates stratified offshore coring, targeted ancient-DNA and isotopic surveys, and high-resolution sediment profiling to refine this deep-time chronology—and reassert the Dravidian Arc’s primacy within global civilizational discourse (see Section 11). Furthermore, patterns of genetic continuity (ASI lineages), symbolic expressions (sea-serpent emblems, shell motifs), and residual maritime exchange routes collectively reposition submerged Khambhāt and inland Tamilakam as indigenous epicentres of agrarian, metallurgical, and navigational ingenuity. We still await renewed stratification protocols and improved excavation methods from the Archaeological Survey of India—whose prolonged inaction over the past quarter-century reflects not technical limitations, but a systemic reluctance to disturb entrenched civilizational hierarchies that marginalize archaeological narratives of earlier Dravidian origins. The submerged Khambhāt grid complex, long sidelined in official discourse, remains a litmus test for India’s archaeological impartiality—and its readiness to engage with deep-time complexity on empirically equal terms.\n·       Parallel Urban Trajectories: As the Northern Arc’s Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) peaked and declined (~1900–1300 BCE), Southern Arc Iron Age centres—Adichanallur with its agrarian-iron toolkit; Kodumanal as an industrial furnace hub; and Keezhadi as a fortified riverside settlement with nails, spear- and arrowheads, knives, and daggers—entered a phase of urban consolidation, expanding craft specializations, civic architecture, and long-distance trade. Keezhadi’s earlier Iron Age roots remain under-explored: most trenches target late Sangam levels. Given the wider c. 5.3 ka BP Iron Revolution in Tamilakam, targeted geo-survey, coring, and deeper excavations at Keezhadi and other sites are needed to uncover their full metallurgical, agrarian, and settlement histories.\n·       Graffiti & Script Parallels: Recent studies by the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology reveal that over 90% of graffiti marks found on potsherds across Tamil Nadu resemble those of the Indus script, with 60% showing direct morphological parallels. This suggests symbolic continuity or a shared trade literacy that spanned the Dravidian Arc, possibly rooted in a more common proto-literate tradition.\n·       Trade & Maritime Exchange: By the late 3rd millennium BCE, Harappan ports such as Lothal and Dholavira were embedded in a westbound seaborne corridor linking southern nodes like Korkai and Poompuhar to Mesopotamia via Magan and Dilmun. Indus carnelian beads, etched ornaments, and shell artefacts from Ur and Susa — together with cowries (Cypraea moneta / annulus) sourced from the Maldives–South India arc — document sustained Arc’s Khambhāt–Tamilakam–Fertile Crescent contact from c. 2600–1900 BCE. The Bronze Age Indian Ocean–Red Sea trade was already moving Cypraea moneta cowries into Predynastic Egypt (Badarian–Naqada phases, c. 4400–3000 BCE) as grave goods, often in women’s and children’s burials, and Indus‑derived etched carnelian into Egypt by the early 2nd millennium BCE. This evidences a polycentric exchange network linking Harappan and Tamilakam nodes to the Gulf, Levant, and Nile — with South Asian technologies and symbols traveling west via maritime brokers, long before later Indo‑Pacific expansions. These exchanges foreshadowed Arc’s later Indo‑Pacific‑wide trade networks and may also have transmitted glyphs and other mercantile literacies.\n·       Genetic & Cultural Threads: Building on Section 1 Genetic Signatures, this Bronze Age maritime corridor — which, as evidenced by the movement of Cypraea moneta cowries into Predynastic Egypt and Indus‑derived etched carnelian into early 2nd millennium BCE Egypt, formed part of a polycentric Harappan–Tamilakam–Gulf–Levant–Nile network — operated alongside enduring Ancestral South Indian (ASI) genetic continuity across both arcs. Ancient DNA studies and artefact typologies point to possible gene flow and cultural contact during the IVC’s late phase, while shared symbolic repertoires — from Indus‑style graffiti to Dravidian semiotic motifs — reinforce the view of a cohesive, pan‑arc cultural zone. See Section 7 for expanded genetic analysis.\n·       Metallurgical Links: Iron artifacts from mid–late Indus Valley contexts warrant retrospective comparison with Sivagalai’s early smelting assemblage to examine technological diffusion, parallel innovation, or trade-mediated transmission routes. Section 11 outlines proposed retro-provenance and residue analyses to clarify interregional metallurgical evolution.\n·       Linguistic Resonance: The undeciphered Indus script may share roots with proto-Dravidian, as suggested by Tamil Nadu’s ongoing initiatives to decode it and the recurrence of shared glyphs on trade seals and ceramic inscriptions. See Section 8 for civic literacy and Section 9 for linguistic caution.\n6. Reclassifying Tamilakam’s Classical Sangam Age & Beyond (from ~8,000 BCE)\n·       Sangam Age Reclassified: While the Classical Sangam period is conventionally dated to ~300 BCE–300 CE, recent archaeological discoveries—ranging from submerged maritime activity at Poompuhar and Korkai to Iron Age metallurgy at Sivagalai—alongside emerging linguistic evidence, suggest that the cultural and civilizational foundations of Sangam Tamilakam extend back to ~10,000 BP. Rather than ending, the Sangam tradition evolved—its maritime, agrarian, and literary legacies continuing to shape Tamil identity well beyond the Kalabhra interregnum and beyond.\n·       Global Links: Tamilakam exported pearls, iron, textiles, and spices to Rome, Egypt, Mesopotamia, and China—attested in both Sangam texts and Greco-Roman records. These exchanges positioned Tamilakam as a key node in early transoceanic trade networks.\n·       Yavana Settlements & Cultural Exchange: Sangam texts like Pattinappalai vividly describe Yavana ships unloading gold, wine, and luxury wares at   Kaveripoompattinam (Poompuhar), where Greeks, Romans, and West Asians bartered with Tamil merchants. Seasonal enclaves at Arikamedu, Alagankulam, and Poompuhar—attested by Roman amphorae, rouletted ware, and Indo-Roman coins—bear witness to their sustained presence. Some Yavanas served as mercenaries or palace guards in Madurai, while others introduced glassware, coral ornaments, and advanced metallurgical techniques. The Ancient Greek’s seafaring Periplus of the Erythraean Sea charts these anchorages along the Dravidian Arc, and later used by the Romans where Pliny laments that trade with India drained up to one-third of Rome’s annual wealth. Tamilakam’s sophisticated dock works and warehousing made its ports vital hubs for manufactured exports (textiles, beads, metalwork), complementing Malabar’s spice trade at Muziris. This deep integration into transoceanic exchange centuries before European arrival underscores Tamilakam’s cosmopolitan maritime identity.  William Dalrymple’s bestseller The Golden Road: How Ancient India Transformed the World revisits this Indo-Roman commercial axis from the 1st century CE onward and supports the above; however, it is important to note that Yavana settlements and Sangam literature reveal that Tamilakam’s embeddedness predates his scope by several centuries.\n·       Literate Polities: Legendary ports such as Korkai, Poompuhar (referred to administratively as Kaveripattinam, but in Sangam literature as Puhar or Kaveripoompattinam), and Periyapattinam flourished alongside Sangam assemblies — serving as commercial hubs and civic centres of poetic and political discourse.\n7. Dravidian Arc: Genetic Continuity, Symbolic Systems & Maritime Exchange\n·       Dravidian Arc as Civilisational Substrate: The Dravidian Arc—anchored in Khambhāt, Tamilakam, and Ilaṅkai—formed an indigenous civilisational substrate predating the Indus Valley Civilization (earliest excavation- Harappan c. 5.3 ka BP). This paper demonstrates that the Indus and Tamilakam complexes arose through a strategic inland relocation following traumatic coastal submergence along the western and southern littorals—an event memorialised in both the legendary Kumari Kandam traditions and the Manu/deluge narrative of northern ancient Dravidians seeking new homelands. By sequencing the Khambhāt ridge‑platform loss (Terminal Submergence (c. 7–5.5 ka BP), the c. millennia recovery window, and the eventual crystallisation of mature urban centres, the model aligns three strands of evidence: geomorphic (datable sea‑level and landform change), archaeological (refugia, re‑aggregation points, and early agrarian hubs), and textual‑mythic (deep‑time cultural memory preserved in the Ṛgveda and Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa). This textual‑mythic strand is further corroborated by early Tamil sources: Nakkīraṉār’s Iraiyanar Akapporul commentary on the First and Second Sangams lost to the sea; the Tiruvilaiyāṭal Purāṇam’s narrative of Pandyan‑era inundations; and the tradition, first recorded by Iraiyanar himself, that Tolkāppiyam was among the works to “survive” the Second Academy’s submergence. Together with Sangam poems recalling port landscapes such as ancient Kāveripūmpattinam (Maṇimēkalai 200–201), this triangulation frames post‑submergence agrarian intensification and urban emergence as historically grounded responses to real ecological trauma and demographic renewal.\n·       ASI–IVC Genetic Continuity: Building on Section 1’s genetic signatures, ancient DNA from (Northern Arc) Mehrgarh, Rakhigarhi, and Rajaggarhi confirms the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) emerged from a population deeply rooted in Ancestral South Indian (ASI) ancestry—lacking Steppe admixture and continuous with earlier Neolithic groups. Narasimhan et al. (2019) demonstrate strong ASI affinity in individuals from the Indus periphery, directly linking this genetic substratum to later South Indian populations. A 2020 analysis shows Kumhar (North India) and Kurcha (South India) populations share robust ASI signals across ~2,500 km, highlighting a pan–Dravidian-Arc genetic substrate predating Steppe admixture. Proxy data from IVC-margin contexts (3345–2953 BCE) indicate ~95 % AASI and 2–5 % Iran Neolithic contributions—suggesting proto-Dravidian (AASI) dominance likely persisted in the ASI admix into the Tamilakam Iron Age (see Table 7.1); these figures await direct confirmation by forthcoming Tamilakam aDNA expected in 2025–26.\nTable 7.1: Timeline of Genetic Admix and Population Along the Dravidian Arc\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Period\n|Event\n|Genetic Admixture Pattern\n|-\n|7000–6500 BCE\n|Arrival of Iran_N ancestry, Mehrgarh Neolithic\n|Iran_N gene flow into AASI (M130 carriers) (Northern Arc)\n|-\n|5400–3700 BCE\n|Indus Periphery Cline formation\n|~45–60% AASI, ~40–55% Iran_N\n|-\n|3345–2953 BCE\n|Iron Age Tamilakam - Proxy aDNA & sediment analysis\n|Predicted ~90–95% AASI, ~5–10% Iran_N admix\n|-\n|2600–1900 BCE\n|IVC periphery genomes (Rakhigarhi)\n|Balanced AASI–Iran_N admixture\n|-\n|Post-2000 BCE\n|Steppe influx\n|Dilution of Iran_N, persistence of AASI in Southern-Arc\n|-\n|IVC Decline-phase\n|Southward migration (of IVC refugia)\n|Reinforcement of Dravidian AASI cline in Southern Arc\n|}\n·      Tamilakam’s Indigenous Agrarian Evolution - A Civilizational Continuum: The agrarian trajectory of Tamilakam reflects an indigenous continuum that predates external civilizational currents, evolving organically from Mesolithic foraging nodes into sophisticated Iron Age agro-technologies. Far from being a periphery to diffusionist models, Tamilakam’s agrarian base demonstrates local innovation in crop domestication, water management, and metallurgical praxis—rooted in an AASI-rich demographic substratum. By the mid-4th millennium BCE, sites such as Adichanallur and Sivagalai exhibit archaeobotanical remains and irrigation-oriented artefactual assemblages that signal emergent agronomic systems. These transitions—while parallel in chronology to Harappan urbanization—suggest cultural autonomy rather than northern influence—\nEven as genomic data from Tamilakam’s Iron Age sites awaits formal publication (projected 2025–26), it is anticipated that stratified samples will exhibit temporal variability in ASI composition—where pre-IVC decline horizons may reflect a stronger AASI signal, and post-migration layers a more integrated AASI–Iran_N admixture.\nYet, despite shifts in proportions, the overarching ASI continuum remains intact, underscoring Tamilakam’s demographic resilience and its long-standing agro-cultural ingenuity. This techno-cultural arc, rooted in ecological adaptation and regional stability, affirms Tamilakam’s position as a cradle of autonomous agrarian evolution.\n·       IVC Scale without Tamilakam: Even without accounting for the Southern Arc of Tamilakam and the deep-time Sangam tradition, the Indus Valley Civilization (c. 3300–1300 BCE) remains one of the most expansive Bronze Age urban cultures—spanning over 1.25 million km² and supporting a population exceeding five million. The combined landmass of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and early dynastic China could fit within the IVC’s geographic footprint, underscoring the scale of South Asia’s early urban complexity.\n·       Southern Arc Inclusion & Indigenous Innovation: Building upon the ASI continuum and agrarian ingenuity detailed above, when the Southern Arc of Tamilakam is considered—particularly the iron-tool–enabled agrarian surge at Sivagalai (~5300 BP) and the early metallurgical evidence from Adichanallur—it becomes clear that Tamilakam not only inherited ASI composition lineage but also independently intensified farming and iron production, possibly even earlier than its northern counterparts. This redefines Tamilakam as a cradle of indigenous agrarian and metallurgical innovation. Incorporating the Southern Arc into the broader civilizational narrative demands a fundamental recalibration of Indian history—one that recognizes Tamilakam not as periphery, but as a parallel and autonomous centre of early complexity. Together, these arc strands—genetic, symbolic, and maritime—reveal the Dravidian Arc not as a marginal footnote to northern empires, but as a foundational axis of South and Southeast Asian civilization (see Table 12.1: Metallurgy-Driven Agricultural Intensification Across Early Civilizations).\n·       Indus–Tamilakam Cultural Bridge: This genetic and cultural continuum reinforces the deep connection between the IVC and southern Dravidian polities. Shared features in language, trade, urban planning, and symbolic systems—such as graffiti parallels, port layouts, and civic infrastructure— tie IVC and southern Dravidian polities into a pan-peninsular Dravidian arc.\n·       Symbolism & Iconography: Iconographic motifs—from Indus seals to a seated yogic deity plaque found in Jaffna (c. 300 BCE)—suggest shared traditions of yogic discipline and veneration of primal deities such as the Mother Goddess (Shakti) and a proto-Shiva figure, later reinterpreted within Vedic frameworks but rooted in Dravidian tradition.\n[see pictures: Harappa (Trench Ai, 1940) Archaeologist M. S. Vats unearthed a stone pillar resembling a Shiva-linga; Proto–Śiva–Śakti Continuum: deity worship and the uncoiled Kundalini life-force rising in disciples (Mohenjo-Daro Seal M453A, ca. 4.3 ka BP); Terracotta Female Figurine, Mature Harappan period (c. 2700–2000 BCE): painted in red pigment to evoke Shakti-energy—power, passion, fertility, and the capacity to destroy evil—arguably representing a Mother Goddess; and “Proto-Śiva Plaque” (Jaffna, c. 300 BCE). Photograph reproduced from Peoples and Cultures of Early Sri Lanka, by Dr S. Thiagararajah (2011), p. 287. Courtesy of Dr P. Pushparatnam.\nThe early Buddha statues at Mihintale in Ilaṅkai, portrayed in padmasana (lotus posture) and dated to the late 3rd century BCE, mirror the yogic seated forms found on Indus Valley seals—most notably the Pashupati seal—and the Jaffna Proto-Śiva Plaque, revealing a trans-cultural and trans-temporal continuum of meditative iconography across South Asia’s Dravidian Arc that stretches back over five millennia.\n·       Bronze Age Trade Network Expansion:\n* Mesopotamia & Sumer: Tamilakam’s ports exported carnelian beads, cotton textiles, and ivory to cities like Ur and Lagash, continuing IVC-era exchange traditions.\n* Egypt: Iron artifacts and gemstones reached Roman Egypt via Red Sea routes, with Arikamedu and Muziris serving as key entrepôts.\n* China: Silk, aromatics, and black pepper moved eastward through early coastal exchanges with Han-era ports, forming part of a proto–Maritime Silk Road.\n·       Cowrie Commerce & Dravidian Seafaring (2nd–1st millennium BCE): By c. 1500–500 BCE, Dravidian mariners—bearing strong ASI ancestry—harvested Cypraea moneta cowries from the Maldives. These shells served both as currency and ballast in long-distance trade vessels. Cowries moved north to Gujarat ports like Lothal, then inland to IVC cities, and westward into Mesopotamian markets (c. 2000–1600 BCE), evidencing a Maldives–Indus–Fertile Crescent corridor.\n·       Proto–Southeast Asian Exchange (3rd–1st millennium BCE): Scattered rouletted ware and Indo-Pacific beads at sites like Khao Sam Kaeo (Thailand), West Java, and the Malay Peninsula hint at early Tamilakam–Southeast Asia exchange long before the Chola era. Compositional analysis of carnelian beads at Khao Sam Kaeo reveals South Asian technological influence, likely originating from Kodumanal’s gemstone industry. These exports were routed through Korkai and Poompuhar, forming a maritime trade arc that prefigured the medieval Chola seaborne empire. Targeted underwater surveys, ceramic provenance studies, and palaeo-shoreline reconstructions are needed to map these pioneering routes.\nTaken together, these lines of evidence reposition the Dravidian Arc not as a peripheral cultural zone, but as a dynamic epicentre of early innovation, connectivity, and symbolic continuity across the Indian Ocean world.\n8. Dravidian Arc’s Civic Complexity & Cultural Continuity (3.5–1.5 ka BP)\n* IVC–Sangam Tamilakam Trade Interface: As the Indus Valley Civilization entered its declining phase (~1900–1300 BCE), Tamilakam’s urban centres were emerging along the Southern Arc. Archaeological and maritime evidence demonstrate sustained trade between Harappan ports such as Lothal and southern nodes like Korkai and Poompuhar—facilitating the movement of beads, ivory, copper, and ceramics. This interface underscores Tamilakam’s integration into wider Bronze Age networks and its role in sustaining cultural and economic continuity beyond the IVC’s collapse.\n* Urban Maturation in the Southern Arc: Sites such as Keezhadi, Adichanallur, and Kodumanal exhibit hallmarks of mature civic life by ~1500 BCE, including planned streets, brick-lined drains, script-bearing pottery and industrial zones. These features reflect a parallel trajectory of urbanism distinct from, yet contemporaneous with, post-Harappan developments in the north.\n* Technological Advances Complementing the IVC: Keezhadi’s deep terracotta ring wells and large-format bricks suggest advanced civic planning and water management. Kodumanal’s carnelian bead workshops and grooved polishing slabs attest to a thriving gemstone industry, reinforcing Tamilakam’s role in transregional craft exchange and technological innovation.\n* Script & Literacy Traditions: Graffiti marks and early Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions (from ~6th century BCE) point to indigenous literacy traditions that likely predate or evolved independently of northern Brahmi diffusion. Graffiti motifs and ritual artifacts at Keezhadi and Adichanallur reflect a symbolic vocabulary that persisted into classical Sangam temple architecture—underscoring Tamilakam’s autonomous intellectual and semiotic trajectory.\n* Guilds, Craft Specialization & Redistribution: The presence of ceramic kilns, iron workshops, and bead-making units indicates a high degree of craft specialization and surplus management. These were likely coordinated by merchant guilds and temple institutions, suggesting the emergence of complex economic governance structures.\n* Vaigai–Madurai Nexus: The Vaigai River, nourishing the alluvial plains around Madurai, served as a civilizational artery akin to the Kaveri–Tamirabarani corridor. Excavations at Keezhadi—just 12 km southeast of Madurai—have revealed planned brick structures, ring wells, craft workshops, and Tamil-Brahmi graffiti, all situated on Vaigai’s flood-bank terrace. Radiometric dating places Keezhadi’s urban horizon as early as ~580 BCE, suggesting that Madurai’s civic complexity emerged from a long-standing agrarian and metallurgical base established during the Dravidian Arc’s Iron Age intensification (see Section 3). While Sangam texts such as Maturaikkanci and Madurai-Kanchi extol Madurai’s urban grandeur, the city itself remains under-excavated. Systematic archaeological work in Madurai’s core holds the potential to uncover the untapped civic heart of early Sangam urbanism and clarify its role within the Arc’s broader cultural continuum.\n* Cultural Continuity Across Millennia: Burial practices, ritual motifs, and linguistic substrata reveal unbroken cultural threads from the early Iron Age through the Sangam period. This continuity affirms Tamilakam’s deep civilizational memory and reinforces the Dravidian Arc as a long-standing cultural and symbolic system rather than a late historical emergence.\n9. Dravidian Arc’s Linguistic Caution & Graffiti Parallels\n·       Tamil as a Linguistic Archive of the IVC: Eminent Indologist Asko Parpola, in a 2022 lecture titled “Dravidian and the Indus Valley Script,” stated, “Tamil, in many respects, is the most viable archive and repository for reconstructing the IVC.” While Parpola does not claim that the IVC spoke classical Tamil, he argues that Proto-Dravidian was likely the language of the Indus script—and that Tamil preserves the most archaic features of that tradition.\n·       Not All Dravidian Arc = Tamil: While “Tamilakam” refers to the southern Dravidian Arc cultural zone and is associated with the rich corpus of ancient Sangam literature, it is important to avoid retroactively projecting classical Tamil onto earlier civilizations. The IVC and Gulf of Khambhāt regions may have spoken early Dravidian dialects or proto-languages that diverged significantly from what later became Tamil. Early Dravidian societies likely encompassed a spectrum of linguistic forms across the subcontinent.\n·       Graffiti Evidence: A 2025 comparative study by the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology digitized over 15,000 graffiti-bearing potsherds from 140 sites across Tamil Nadu. The study found that over 90% of these graffiti marks resemble signs from the Indus script, with nearly 60% showing direct morphological parallels—suggesting a shared symbolic repertoire across the Dravidian Arc.\n·       Inference, Not Certainty: While these parallels point to a possible symbolic continuum between the IVC and early Iron Age Tamilakam, they do not confirm linguistic identity. The comparative analysis—led by Prof. K. Rajan and R. Sivananthan—employed a morphological rather than linguistic framework, reinforcing the hypothesis of symbolic exchange or cultural memory rather than direct script inheritance. These findings support the idea of a deep Dravidian semiotic tradition, but further epigraphic and linguistic research is needed to clarify its evolution.\n10. Reassessing Dravidian Arc (South) – Sangam Chronology\n·       Beyond the 300 BCE Benchmark: While classical Sangam literature is at present mistakenly dated to 300 BCE–300 CE, archaeological layers at Keezhadi, Mayiladum-para and Adichanallur —and the high-temperature, multi-stage iron smelting at Sivagalai (c. 3345–2953 BCE) and related technologically advanced farming—push Tamilakam’s urban, literary, and metallurgical antecedents well into the third millennium BCE. These findings compel a redefinition of both the origins and apex of Sangam-era civilization.\n·       Reframing the Three Sangam Phases (not be confused with infamous 3 Sangam Assemblies):\n* First Sangam (legendary, pre-literate): Likely reflects oral poetic traditions rooted in Mesolithic–Neolithic ritual landscapes (~10,000–5,000 BP), where symbolism and sacred geographies shaped collective memory.\n* Second Sangam (transitional): Corresponds to the Iron Age–early urban phase (~3000–1500 BCE), marked by proto-script, civic infrastructure, and trade networks—heralding Tamilakam’s shift toward urban complexity.\n* Third Sangam (textual): Aligns with the literate, port-linked polities of 300 BCE–300 CE, when Tamilakam emerged as a global maritime node and a prolific centre of literary production.\n·       Chronological Convergence: Genetic continuity (ASI), material culture (iron, script, urbanism) and literary motifs (from Tolkappiyam to Pattinappalai) all point to a deep-time civilizational arc—not a late cultural bloom, but a long process of unfolding. See Section 11 for targeted research priorities to test and refine these phases.\n·       Three Sangam Assemblies & Literary Legacy: Tamil tradition recounts three legendary Sangam gatherings—each chaired by sages and hosted by Pandiyan kings. The First Sangam, held at Madurai, said to have lasted 4,440 years with 549 poets but left no surviving texts. The Second Sangam, at Kapadapuram, said to have spanned 3,700 years with 1,700 poets and produced 12 Pattiyals—all lost to submergence, except the Tolkappiyam, which survived. The Third Sangam, again at Madurai (relocated new Pandyan city), said to have lasted 1,850 years with 449 poets and preserved the bulk of extant Sangam literature, including the Ettuthogai, Pattuppāṭṭu, and epics like Silappathikaram. See Section 11 for targeted research priorities to search for these two famous sunken cities, including Kapadapuram considered to be located east coast off Tamil Nadu.\n11. Future Research Priorities: Toward a Deeper Tamilakam (Southern Dravidian Arc)\n·       IVC–Sivagalai Metallurgical Interface: Launch comparative metallurgical studies between iron artifacts from mid–late Indus Valley sites and early smelting centres in Tamilakam, particularly Sivagalai. Investigate whether Harappan iron usage reflects trade exchange or technological diffusion from southern hubs. Sivagalai may have supplied iron via redistribution networks anchored in Madurai, with Keezhadi functioning as a logistical node. The goal is to test, through deeper stratified excavation, whether Keezhadi’s iron-tool usage and canal-fed agriculture predate the conventional 800 BCE benchmark—potentially aligning with the c.5300–4900 BP Iron Revolution verified at Sivagalai and Adichanallur. This research could clarify whether Tamilakam’s Iron Age metallurgy influenced or paralleled northern traditions—and whether Pandian patronage catalysed early industrial specialization.\n·       Retrospective Metallurgical Audit: Complementing future comparative studies, existing older artifacts excavated from Mehrgarh and Indus Valley sites should be reanalysed using advanced residue testing, metallographic scans, and updated stratigraphic profiling. Earlier excavations rarely employed radiometric methods capable of identifying iron smelting byproducts or tool fragments. As Tamilakam’s iron metallurgy dates to c. 5300 BP, it is essential to reassess northern datasets for overlooked parallels—potentially revealing unrecognized diffusion, divergent adoption patterns, or missed innovation centres.\n·       Chronological Deepening of Agrarian Horizons: Excavations at Sivagalai have yielded iron ploughshares and harvesting blades directly AMS-dated to c. 3345–3259 BCE—pushing South India’s iron-aided cultivation into the mid-4th millennium BCE. Yet Section 2 shows Neolithic farming at Paiyampalli (7000–6000 BCE), pulses and millets, and parallel cereal husbandry at Mehrgarh (8000–6000 BCE) and wild-rice trials in the Belan Valley (c. 5000 BCE). To test whether Tamilakam’s agrarian tradition likewise stretches into the 7–8 ka BP window, we need:\n* Stratified trenching and deep-core sampling at key ASI-linked sites (Paiyampalli, Adichanallur, Gachibowli).\n* High-resolution archaeobotanical floats, phytolith and starch analyses to secure early plant macro-remains.\n* Bayesian calibration of new ¹⁴C and OSL dates to integrate Tamilakam horizons with the Dravidian Arc’s pan-regional Neolithic timeline.\n·       Extending the Neolithic Arc into Ilaṅkai and Beyond: Northern Ilaṅkai (Jaffna) presents promising evidence of microliths, grinding stones, and polished axes, though deep-stratified Neolithic dates remain unconfirmed. In light of the Mehrgarh–Belan Valley–Paiyampalli parallels, targeted coring and test pits in Jaffna and coastal Tamilakam could determine whether agro-foraging hubs on these ridge-islands form part of the 7–8 ka BP Dravidian Arc continuum. Complementary palaeoecological coring at Poompuhar and Khambhāt will refine sea-level curves and deltaic phase models, anchoring early cultivation to precise environmental stages.\nAn important outlier is Beragala (c. 2400 BCE), where isolated slag fragments suggest proto-Iron Age smelting—a site that warrants renewed investigation to establish its chronological and technological significance with greater accuracy.\nNotably, Mihintale in Ilaṅkai, with its 3rd-century BCE temple attributed to Mahinda, demonstrates pyro-mechanical granite splitting techniques—involving timber and fire-induced thermal expansion followed by iron wedge application. Further inquiry is needed at Kanniya’s seven hot water wells, where early iron technology may have been employed in hydrothermal engineering (c. 1580 BCE). The linkage between Kanniyaand Koneswaram—one of the five Pancha Ishwaram temples—suggests deep cultural ties between Tamilakam and Ilaṅkai, underscoring a sophisticated integration of iron metallurgy within early Ilaṅkai architectural praxis, and offering a tangible anchor for Iron Age technological diffusion across the Dravidian Arc.\n·       Deeper coring warranted: Initiate deeper stratigraphic drilling at Sivagalai, Madurai (Sangam-cited city), and other key Vaigai–Tamirabarani basin locations to uncover pre-Iron horizons, spurred by Iron Age urns dated to ~5.4 kya.\n·       Submerged Port Complexes & Sangam Memory: Map harbour layouts, quays, and buried infrastructure at Korkai, Poompuhar–Nagapattinam, and the Tiruchendur coast using ROV-assisted trenching and stratified coring—tied to Tamil Nadu’s programme announced in the 2025–26 State Budget and implemented by the State Department of Archaeology. Locating submerged settlements such as ancient Kapadapuram (also known as Kuadam)—described in Sangam literature as the capital of the Pandiyan kingdom during the Second Sangam period—may yield vital evidence of early maritime urbanism and symbolic production lost to Holocene sea-level rise. These submerged landscapes could help contextualize Sangam-era literary references to vanished cities and drowned coastlines. The mythic memory of Naguleswaram Kovil’s (first temple structure) submergence—part of ancient Tamilkilam’s Ilaṅkai before continental separation—invites sonar-based investigation near Keerimalai coasts to test ritual-linked port activity encoded in devotional narrative.\n·       Re-examining submerged and terrestrial construction sites for early iron technologies: Given the radiometric evidence of iron smelting and fire-setting in Tamilakam by 3345 BCE, future studies should reassess structural and metallurgical features at Indus Valley Civilization sites—such as Dholavira, with its extensive stone architecture and water-management systems—for signs of early iron-tool usage, fire-based quarrying methods, and interregional technological exchange, including submerged settlements like Khambhat and Poompuhar.\n·       Paleoclimate & Sea-Level Archives: The satellite map illustrates ancient river paths between southern India and Ilaṅkai, particularly across the Gulf of Mannar. It presents compelling visual support for the hypothesis of a prehistoric land bridge and fluvial continuity—especially during lower sea-level phases in the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene. The submerged river channels visible in the image likely represent paleo-drainage systems—possibly extensions of the Vaigai, Thamirabarani, and Cauvery distributaries—feeding into a shared estuarine basin.\nThis paper recommends acquiring high-resolution sediment cores from offshore ridges, submerged shoals, and the paleo-floodplains of the Kaveri, Vaigai, and Tamirabarani rivers. Combining OSL dating, pollen/mangrove proxies, and foraminiferal Mg/Ca analyses will help reconstruct monsoon-driven sea-level changes (~9.5–4 ka BP) and precisely date submergence episodes at Poompuhar, the hypothesized Kapadapuram site near Tiruchendur, and Khambhāt on the western littoral—clarifying the environmental drivers behind Tamilakam’s deltaic shift and estuarine urbanism.\n·       Trans-Eurasian Trade Networks: Expand studies of cowrie shells, carnelian beads, and ceramic parallels that moved between Khambhāt, Poompuhar, and Mesopotamia/Anatolia (c. 3000–1500 BCE). Establish whether these exchanges extend into earlier periods and assess Tamilakam’s role in shaping Bronze Age trade corridors.\n·       Trans-Asian Ceramic Provenance: Apply geochemical sourcing to rouletted ware and Indo-Pacific beads found in Southeast Asia (e.g., Khao Sam Kaeo, West Java, Malay Peninsula) to map Tamilakam’s early trade footprint. Compositional fingerprinting can clarify export routes and craft diffusion from Kodumanal, Korkai, and Poompuhar.\n·       Madurai Urban Stratigraphy: Undertake deep excavations within Madurai’s historic core to recover pre-Sangam strata and correlate material layers with literary references in Maturaikkanci and Madurai-Kanchi. Target temple precincts, civic zones, and floodplain terraces to reconstruct the city’s urban evolution.\n·       Genetic Demography: Expand ancient DNA sampling along the Kaveri, Vaigai, and Tamirabarani corridors to illuminate long-term population continuity, migratory pulses, and admixture across 10,000 years. Prioritize stratified sampling from burial urns at Adichanallur and Sivagalai.\n·       Metal & Mobility Isotopes: Conduct isotopic provenance and trace-element analyses on Sivagalai slags, Keezhadi artifacts, and transoceanic metal finds. Use strontium and oxygen isotope testing on human and faunal remains to reconstruct material flows, artisanal networks, and individual life histories.\n·       Experimental Seafaring: Build and test reconstructions of Iron Age canoes using regional timbers to assess monsoon-season sailing capabilities, cargo limits, and navigational range. These reconstructions may validate Sangam-era accounts of seasonal voyages and port provisioning.\n·       Ram Setu Geo-Archaeology & Cultural Mapping: Ram Setu Geo-Archaeology & Cultural Mapping: Launch a multidisciplinary study of Ram Setu using sonar, sediment cores, and underwater excavation to assess its structural origins and symbolic significance. Historical records from Persian geographers and temple archives confirm its traversability until the 15th century, while satellite imagery reveals a linear shoal formation—possibly modified by ancient engineering and aligned with submerged paleo-river channels that once connected Tamilakam and Ilaṅkai. These fluvial traces, visible in the Gulf of Mannar, suggest Ram Setu may have formed atop or alongside a natural estuarine corridor, later mythologized in the Ramayana epic and utilized during Pandian-era trade. Ram Setu thus warrants comprehensive investigation as both a cultural monument and a geoengineered artifact embedded within a drowned riverine landscape.\n·       Gulf of Khambhāt Artefact & Genetic Analysis: Expand underwater excavations in the Gulf of Khambhāt, prioritizing stratified sampling over dredging. Focus on metallurgical analysis of iron tools and slag to assess technological sophistication, and initiate ancient DNA testing on skeletal remains to verify Ancestral South Indian (ASI) genetic signatures. These steps are essential to determine whether the submerged site represents an early urban node that predates or parallels the Indus Valley Civilization.\n12 Comparative Cradles of Civilization\nThis comparative section brings together the core agricultural, metallurgical, and urban-settlement developments (early to advanced) outlined earlier to place the Dravidian Arc in direct comparative dialogue with the Fertile Crescent, Mesopotamia, and the emergent Anatolian civilization. It positions the Dravidian Arc as a compelling contender to redefine civilizational primacy—appearing to be the earliest of the four.\nThe paper presents an expanded comparative framework through two updated tables that trace the emergence and intensification of agrarian and urban development across key civilizational cores.\nTable 12.1, titled “Metallurgy-Driven Agricultural Intensification Across Early Civilizations,” builds on Section 3 and Table 3.1 and maps the rise of multiple, overlapping agrarian hubs from the Neolithic revolution onward—chief among them the Fertile Crescent’s Bronze-Age irrigation systems and seed-ploughs (Uruk, 4000–3100 BCE) and the Dravidian Arc’s Southern Tamilakam sites, which pioneered advanced Iron-Age deep-tillage implements (c. 3300 BCE). These two regions represent the earliest widespread application of metal tools to enable large-scale, irrigated, or permanent-field agriculture, reinforcing the case for a polycentric, multi-axis model of early civilization.\nComplementing this, Table 12.2, “Key Milestones in Settlement Development across the Dravidian Arc and Anatolia,” evaluates the earliest urbanized developments, identifying two primary contenders: the Anatolian region (located in modern-day Turkey) and the proposed Dravidian Arc (Indian subcontinent, including Ilankai). It synthesizes key milestones in comparative settlement growth—highlighting Poompuhar (c. 15 ka BP), Khambhāt (c. 9.5 ka BP), Sivagalai (c. 7.3 ka BP), and the early Indus Valley Civilization (c. 5 ka BP) within the Dravidian Arc. These data collectively reveal a denser, more technologically advanced, and symbolically coherent civilizational complex than is commonly recognized, positioning the Dravidian Arc as a compelling contender to redefine civilizational primacy.\nTable 12.1: Metallurgy-Driven Agricultural Intensification Across Early Civilizations\nThis table traces the earliest widespread use of metal tools in support of intensive agrarian systems—whether through deep tillage, permanent-field expansion, or state-managed irrigation. It spans Bronze-Age hoes and seed-ploughs in Uruk (4000–3100 BCE), funnel-ploughs of the Akkadian Empire (c. 2300 BCE), advanced iron implements in Tamilakam (wrought plough tines, hoes, and sickles; c. 3300–696 BCE), forest-clearing tools in Hittite Anatolia (c. 1200–1000 BCE), and cast-iron mouldboard shares in Warring States China (c. 400 BCE). By aligning chronology, tool typology, and eco-cultural context, the table showcases how metallurgy catalysed agrarian intensification across multiple cradles of early civilization.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Region\n|Site / Context\n|Date (BCE)\n|Metal Implements & Intensive-Farming Features\n|-\n|Fertile Crescent\n|Uruk\n|4000–3100\n|Bronze hoes & seed-ploughs paired with canal irrigation networks for large-scale cereal cultivation\n|-\n|Mesopotamia\n|Akkadian Period\n|c. 2300\n|Bronze seed-plough with funnel attachment integrated into state-run irrigation networks\n|-\n|Tamilakam (Arc)\n|Sivagalai\n|c. 3345\n|Wrought-iron plough tines & hoe heads enabling deep tillage and permanent-field expansion\n|-\n|Tamilakam (Arc)\n|Mayiladumparai\n|c. 2172\n|Early bloomery smelting; iron sickles and ploughshares enabling canal-fed agriculture\n|-\n|Tamilakam (Arc)\n|Porunthal\n|c. 2000\n|Early bloomery smelting; iron sickles and plough tines associated with millet and pulse cultivation\n|-\n|Tamilakam (Arc)\n|Adichanallur\n|c. 2600\n|Bloomery smelting; ritual iron implements; and Iron on sickle blades & ploughshares; drove wide-scale harvests of pulses and millets\n|-\n|Tamilakam (Arc)\n|Mangadu\n|c. 1800\n|Iron hoe heads and sickles; evidence of deltaic field expansion and seasonal irrigation\n|-\n|Tamilakam (Arc)\n|Kodumanal\n|c.1500\n|Iron chisels, sickles, and ploughshares linked to textile-agriculture synergy and canal-fed cropping\n|-\n|Tamilakam (Arc)\n|Veerapuram\n|c. 1300\n|Iron sickles & mattocks in megalithic graves; linked to expanded delta-plain cultivation\n|-\n|Tamilakam (Arc)\n|Korkai\n|c. 1200\n|Iron tools in maritime-agricultural context; supports coastal agrarian intensification\n|-\n|Tamilakam (Arc)\n|Thelunganur\n|c. 1435–890 BCE\n|Multistage bloomery and earliest crucible steel in South Asia.

The table below synthesizes key milestones in comparative settlement growth—highlighting Poompuhar (c. 15 ka BP), Khambhāt (minimum begins 13 ka BP), Sivagalai (c. 7.3 ka BP), and the early Indus Valley Civilization (c. 5 ka BP) within the Dravidian Arc. These data reveal a denser, more technologically advanced, and symbolically coherent civilizational complex than is often acknowledged.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Feature\n|Dravidian Arc (Poompuhar, Khambhat, Sivagalai, IVC, Tamilakam/ Sangam)\n|Anatolia (Göbekli Tepe, Çatalhöyük, Hittites, Troy)\n|-\n|Earliest Settlement Activity\n|Poompuhar sonar scans (~15 ka BP), Khambhāt grid sonar scans (min 13 ka BP), Mehrgarh (~9 ka BP)\n|Göbekli Tepe (~11.5 ka BP), Çatalhöyük (~7.4 ka BP)\n|-\n|Urbanism & Civic Planning\n|Khambhāt grid (~9.5 ka BP), proto-port at Poompuhar (7000–5000 BCE), IVC’s multi-city expanse cluster incl.

When we consider the earliest expansive farming systems driven by iron—deep-tillage ploughs, permanent-field hoes and canal networks—building on Neolithic agro-foraging traditions traced to 7-8 ka BP across Mehrgarh, Belan Valley, and Tamilakam it underscores the need for a polycentric, multi-axis model of early civilization. This synthesis also highlights the critical importance of stratified and coring excavations in Tamilakam to probe deeper agrarian horizons—an inference already suggested by wrought-iron plough tines at Sivagalai (c. 3300 BCE), bloomery debris at Gachibowli (c. 2200 BCE), forging residues at Mayiladumparai (c. 2172 BCE), multistage bloomery and crucible steel at Thelunganur (c. 1435–890 BCE), and slag-tapping furnaces at Komaranahalli (c. 1100 BCE).\nExcavation Note: These data reflect emerging hypotheses and preliminary dating from submerged and terrestrial contexts; verification requires further stratified excavations—particularly offshore (Khambhāt, Poompuhar) and inland (e.g., coring at Madurai, which remains largely unexcavated). Based on recent development:\n* Khambhāt: Still under [contentious] debate, but sonar and artifact recovery conclusions awaited.\n* Poompuhar: Deep-sea excavations between Poompuhar and Nagapattinam were announced in the 2025–26 Tamil Nadu budget, with sonar mapping and AMS, OSL and radiocarbon dating underway for the submerged for harbour structures.\nAs of 2025, the Archaeological Survey of India has launched targeted underwater excavations at Khambhāt and world still waits for full transparent results for Poompuhar’s harbour structures.\nTaken together, Tables 12.1 and 12.2 demonstrate that breakthroughs in metal-driven agrarian intensification directly fuelled the rise of dense, planned urban centres with complex symbolic and civic systems—especially within the Dravidian Arc, with Tamilakam serving as a southern engine of agrarian and urban innovation. This convergence of agricultural and urban innovation underpins our polycentric model and leads naturally into the concluding discussion.\nConclusion\nSouthern Tamilakam—as an integral part of the Dravidian Arc—was never a latecomer. It can be confidently identified as an early Holocene maritime-agrarian civilization (c. 8000 BCE), rooted in estuarine deltas and offshore ridges, shaped not by sudden collapse but by gradual sea-level rise. Our environmental-bridge framework shows how this steady transgression redirected coastal maritime-agrarian lifeways into inland riverine networks, laying the groundwork for Sangam-era urban centres. By the Bronze Age, its ports connected to Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Zhou/Eastern Zhou China, with Chinese goods arriving via early first-millennium BCE trade routes. Deep genetic continuity with the Indus Valley Civilization, coupled with shared graffiti systems, deity iconography, and ritual motifs, reveals a cultural coherence that transcended geography.\nThis study repositions Tamilakam not as a peripheral outpost but as a civilizational core—marked by autonomous agrarian systems, early iron production, and metallurgical innovation. The presence of Yavana enclaves and Indo-Roman trade artifacts across its littoral—corroborated by Sangam texts and Greco-Roman accounts—further affirms Tamilakam’s maritime sophistication and deep integration into early global exchange networks, centuries before European contact. Together, these findings challenge diffusionist models and underscore Tamilakam’s enduring contributions to sustainable development, technological ingenuity, and transoceanic connectivity.\nOur comparative analysis confirms that Tamilakam not only harnessed metal-driven agrarian breakthroughs (Table 12.1)—including the earliest crucible steel at Thelunganur and, in the Southern Arc, wind-powered steel furnaces at Samanalawewa (c. 300 BCE)—but also pioneered dense, planned urban settlements alongside the Fertile Crescent and Anatolia (Table 12.2). This dual legacy of agricultural intensification and urban complexity cements its position within a truly polycentric model of early civilization.\nWhile we cannot yet assert that these early populations were “Tamil-speaking” in a strict linguistic sense, the cultural, genetic, and symbolic foundations of Tamilakam identity trace back to an ancient Dravidian continuum. The persistence of yogic postures and deity archetypes—from the Pashupati seal to the Jaffna plaque—suggests a continuity of ritual motifs predating the Vedic canon. These elements may have later informed the yoga and Shaiva–Shakti traditions, though direct historical and linguistic links remain under study. Such symbolic coherence, sustained over millennia, points to a devotional grammar embedded deeply in the subcontinent’s spiritual imagination for over 5,000 years and continues to resonate today.\nThis paper invites a broader comparative perspective: Southern Tamilakam must be seen not as a regional backwater but as a vibrant civilisation whose iron-driven agrarian innovations, planned urban centres, and rich symbolic traditions—enshrined in religious practices and Sangam-era texts like the Tolkappiyam—stand as a foundational axis of early human complexity. To date, Mesopotamia and the Fertile Crescent have dominated the cradle-of-civilisation paradigm, with Anatolian sites such as Göbekli Tepe, Çatalhöyük, and Troy joining the narrative. Our deep-time Dravidian Arc framework—anchored at Khambhāt, Tamilkilam, and Ilankai—places this South Indian continuum alongside these giants and suggests it may well have emerged first.\nAs the Overview warns, clinging to a single-cradle narrative erases half of human ingenuity. By exposing funding biases and historiographical blind spots across India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, this study levels the playing field—elevating Tamilakam from marginal footnote to rightful civilisational peer. Overlooking its revolutionary legacy would be an unforgivable travesty.\nOriginal Source: Dravidian Arc: Reframing Ancient India’s Civilisational Origins, v1.2.2 — Jeeva S.S, Independent Researcher (UK) (CC BY 4.0)\nReferences"
