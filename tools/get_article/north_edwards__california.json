Situated in the Mojave Desert, North Edwards is located about  north-east of Edwards Air Force Base, at an elevation of . As of the 2020 census it had a population of 1,054.\nHistory\nA developer announced in June 1955 that he was building houses on Clay Mine Road, within  of the north gate of the military installation. Soon construction was underway by other builders. In March 1960, the Boron Enterprise reported that in the \"bustling community\" north of the base, more than 1,000 residents were living in a half dozen subdivisions. In the following year, the community was named North Edwards.\nA chamber of commerce was organized in October 1958. It aimed to advance the civic, commercial, and industrial interests of the community, as well as foster beneficial social developments. Moreover, the organization hoped to exert \"controlled guidance\" in the community rather than allow \"uncontrolled mushroom growth\". By August 1957, volunteer firemen were constructing a fire station and receiving instruction in fire fighting from Kern County firemen stationed at Boron. The county assigned the volunteers a fire engine. Construction of the first phase of a shopping center began in March 1959 and it was ready for business by October. Thomas Stovall, formerly a Bakersfield retailer, opened a supermarket. Soon other merchants joined him. After the consolidation of several local water companies, two remained to serve the community, the Edgemont Acres Mutual Water Company organized in October 1960 and the North Edwards Water District formed in January 1987.\nIn May 1967 the Chamber of Commerce sponsored a community event called Western Silver Days. In a parade were a variety of floats, decorated cars, and marching units. Food was available at the firehouse and the local merchants and those of Boron donated goods and services as door prizes. Under the pastorate of the Reverend Thomas Morgan, the First Southern Baptist Church was built in June 1959. Subsequently, several other churches became a part of the community. In November 1964, the Muroc Joint Unified School District authorized a school. Upon its opening in November 1966, it accommodated kindergarten through third grade. Before opening a post office in the area of North Edwards-North Muroc, the postal authorities required the selection of a name that a majority of residents favored. Reaching an agreement proved to be difficult, and the problem was solved by establishing \"Contract Branch No. 1 of the Edwards Post Office\" in September 1959. In June 1961 the Chamber of Commerce and the Community League sponsored a postcard election with the understanding that all who cast votes would be willing to accept the outcome. The winning name was North Edwards and the post office opened in September 1961 with Nevajoe Roush as the postmaster.\nThe Kern County Planning Commission recognized North Edwards as a town in January 1963.\nNorth Edwards was also the first town to have a woman as president of the Chamber of Commerce, Ann L. Campen. She served until her death on August 15, 1973. She was responsible for having Clay Mine Road paved, also for having telephone service to Aerial Acres, she was a representative for Barry Goldwater Jr., and she helped organize an annual community parade for North Edwards and Boron Ca. bringing some famous people as Grand Marshall's to participate in the parades. Being an American Indian and born on a reservation, there is no real record of her birth, she always told her grandchildren at every birthday, she was 58.\nFor mostly reasons of economic viability, several prior establishments have been closed over the years, including 20 Mule Team Cafe, a bar & restaurant (The Bubbi North formerly The Red Barn), pizza parlor (Chuck's Pizza), hardware store (Hillman's True Value), movie rental, bowling alley (due to arson), and the local elementary school (Richard B. Lynch). Today, the town serves mainly as a bedroom community for those wishing to live near either Edwards Air Force Base or the U.S. Borax mine in Boron.\nGeography\nNorth Edwards is located at .\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land.\nClimate\nAccording to the Köppen Climate Classification system, North Edwards has a semi-arid climate, abbreviated \"BSk\" on climate maps.\nDemographics\n1850–1870 1880-1890 1900 1910 1920 1930 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990\n2000 2010\n}}\nNorth Edwards first appeared as a census designated place in the 1980 United States census.\n2020\nThe 2020 United States census reported that North Edwards had a population of 1,054.
