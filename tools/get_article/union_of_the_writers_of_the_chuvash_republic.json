Saveliev-Saruy), in Novocheboksarsk (head – V.P. Pugachev), in Ulyanovsk (head – N.N. Larionov), in the villages: of Urmary (head-N.I. Ivanov Parhatar) in Batyrevo (head – V.V. Vladimirov).\nHistory\nOn June 30, 1923 at the meeting of workers of the Chuvash book publishers and employees of the newspaper \"Kanash\" was established the Chuvash writers Community (Union Chuvash writers and journalists). Charter of the organization was approved July 1, 1923. The founders were writers Nikolai Yut, N. Patman, Nikolay Shooboushynni, S. Khoomma, S. Lashman and others.\nAfter the creation in 1934 of the Union of Soviet Writers, Community of the Chuvash writers and journalists has been transformed into the Union of Writers of the Chuvash Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. This Union has worked until 1991.\nIn 1991 the Union was a split in two organizations: the Union of Writers of the Chuvash Republic (is registered by the Ministry of Justice of the Chuvash Republic at 4 January 1992) and the Union of Chuvash Writers (20 February 1992). Both organizations on an equal footing are the legal successors of the Chuvash Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic of the Union of Writers.\nIn autumn 2001 the Writers Union of the Chuvash Republic was divided into two parts: the Union of Writers of Chuvash Republic \"Hurantash\" and the Union of the Professional Writers of the Chuvash Republic.\nTo maintain continuity and Commonwealth Writers' Association of Writers, the Union of the Chuvash Writers registered in the Ministry of Justice as the Union of the Writers of the Chuvash Republic.\nChairs\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"6\" style=\"background: LightSteelBlue;\"|Chairman of Union of Chuvash  Writers\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n! !!
