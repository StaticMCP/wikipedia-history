It comprises a broad class of tools designed to store, manipulate, visualize, and interpret data with a geographic or spatial component. These applications support tasks such as geostatistics, spacial modeling, network analysis, and raster-vector processing, enabling researchers and practitioners to derive meaningful patterns and relationships from location-based information.\nCurrently, there are several software packages, ranging from fully open-source projects to proprietary software, which address different layers of the spatial data infrastructure stack.\nPackages\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n-->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Package\n!Free of charge\n!Operating Systems\n!Developer institution/person\n!Field of interest (if any specific)\n!Main Features\n!Language\n!License\n|-\n|Snappy Mapper\n|Yes, for non-commercial use\n|Web-based\n|Snappy Mapper\n|Vector data\n|Bridges the knowledge gap between users and GIS entities, allowing data generation and sharing by non-technical users\n|\n|Proprietary (with free trial available).\n|-\n|CARTO\n|No\n|Web-based (Cloud SaaS)\n|CARTO\n|Spatial data science & location intelligence\n|Spatial SQL, spatial data science, location analytics, site selection, data visualization, mapping, geocoding and app development.
