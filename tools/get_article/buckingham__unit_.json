David Buckingham who was the first to measure a molecular quadrupole moment.}} It is defined as . This is equivalent to 1&nbsp;debye-ångström, where 1&nbsp;debye =  is the CGS unit of molecular dipole moment and 1&nbsp;ångström = .\nOne buckingham corresponds to the quadrupole moment resulting from two opposing dipole moments of equal magnitude of 1&nbsp;debye that are separated by a distance of 1&nbsp;ångström, a typical bond length. This is analogous to the debye for the dipole moment of two opposing charges of  separated by 1&nbsp;ångström, and the name Buckingham for the unit was suggested by Peter Debye in 1963 in honour of Buckingham.}}}}\nReferences"
