On the 19th, it is located on the edge of the Hunding Stellung.\nIn a position that dominated the Mont d'Origny bridgehead and the Renansart plateau, Debeney (1st Army) faces a slip road of the Hermann Stellung between Origny and Mesbrecourt.\nOpposing Forces\nFrance\n* 10th Army (France)\n** 16th Army Corps (France), 18th Army Corps (France), 35th Army Corps (France)\n* 1st Army (France)\n** 8e corps d'armée (France), 20e corps d'armée (France), 31st Army Corps (France)\nGerman Empire\n* 7th Army (German Empire)\n* 18th Army (German Empire)\nCourse of the battle\nMangin in front of the Serre marshes\nBetween Debeney (1st Army) and Guillaumat (5th Army), Mangin and his 10th Army approached the Sissonne marshes; opposite him, von Eberhardt's 7th Army. From October 19, between Liesse-Notre-Dame and Verneuil-sur-Serre, he approached the overflowed Serre and the drainage canal: broken bridges and flooded meadows battered by machine guns.\nOn the 25th, the 16th and 18th Corps gained a foothold on the north bank between Crécy-sur-Serre and Mortiers, Aisne; the 35th Corps  crossed the marshes north of Pierrepont, Aisne.\nOn 27 October, Mangin and his 10th Army  were secretly relieved by Humbert's 3rd Army to  attack east of Metz. On the 28th, the 3rd Army, Lœuilly's Army, received the order to await the results of Debeney's attack (1st Army) before emerging from La Serre.\nDebeney north of Serre\nTo outflank the Serre from the north, Debeney chose to bypass the massif of Villers-le-Sec, Pleine-Selve, Parpeville on both flanks: the 8th Corps to the east (Chevresis-Monceau), the 20th Corps to the north (Courjumelles) and the 31st Corps further north (elevation 120 south of Origny).\nAfter a long artillery preparation, the attack began on 24 October. Lucy (near Ribemont) and Ferrière farm (near La Ferté-Chevresis) were captured with 3,000 prisoners. On the 26th, the 20th and 8th corps seized the massif of Villers-le-Sec, Pleine-Selve, Parpeville and to the south, Chevresis-les-Dames.\nOutcome\nDuring the night of October 26-27, the armies of von Hutier and von Eberhardt retreated to the second Hermann position, from Guise to Dercy. On the 27th, the two French armies seized the plateaus of Jonqueuse, Landifay and Montigny-sur-Crécy. Debeney was at the gates of Guise.\nBattle Honour\n* LA SERRE 1918 is emblazoned on the flags of those French regiments that were present during this battle.\nVoir aussi\n* Hundred Days Offensive\nReferences\nBibliography\n* la Revue des deux Mondes, Paris : Au Bureau de la Revue des deux Mondes, 1919:6 ( et 322).\n*\n*\n*"
