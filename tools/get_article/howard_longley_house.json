Mr. Longley was \"the brother-in-law of Dr. Greene's [i.e., Charles and Henry Greene's father] sister, Alice.\" The house is significant as one of the earliest surviving residences designed by Greene & Greene. On 6 August 1897, the Los Angeles Journal reported that plans for the house were being prepared. The Longley house stands next to the Lucretia Garfield House (designed by Greene & Greene in 1904 for the widow of President James Garfield). The Longley House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 16, 1974.\nReferences"
