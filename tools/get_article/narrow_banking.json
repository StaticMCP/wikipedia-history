Under this model, banks would function as custodians and payment processors, separate from the lending function performed by other financial intermediaries. The concept emerged as a response to banking instability and gained attention following financial crises, though there is limited implementation.\nNarrow banking proposals fundamentally differ from current fractional-reserve practice by eliminating maturity and credit risk. Proponents argue this would enhance financial stability and reduce systemic risk, while critics claim it could reduce credit availability to the economy.\nConcept and structure\nNarrow banks' business model differs from traditional commercial banks. Instead of borrowing short-term deposits to make long-term loans, narrow banks would back demand deposits with 100% central bank reserves or short-term government securities.\nKey characteristics include:\nAsset restrictions: Banks would be restricted to holding safe assets like government bonds.\nFunctional separation: Deposit taking and payment functions would be separated from lending, which would be funded through uninsured deposits and capital. Money market funds might become an important source of finance for households and develop expertise in originating credit.\nFee-based revenue model: Since narrow banks cannot earn income from lending, they would be fee-driven.\nNarrow banking contrasts with full-reserve banking, which typically allows banks to make loans using equity capital or time deposits, while backing demand deposits with 100% reserves.\nTheoretical foundation\nThe case for narrow banking draws from financial stability concerns. Proponents argue the inherent instability of fractional-reserve banking arises from the conflict between the promise to convert deposits to cash on demand and the practice of lending most deposited funds.\nBanking fragility theory suggests traditional banks are inherently vulnerable to bank runs because of self-fulfilling market concerns about bank liquidity adequacy. Narrow banking would eliminate this fragility by always having liquid assets to meet withdrawal demands.\nRisk separation could reduce the need for deposit insurance. Separating the payment system from credit risk protects from losses in lending activities.\nMonetary policy could more effective as central banks improve their ability to directly control the money supply process, rather than being influenced by private bank lending.\nHistorical development\nEarly monetary economists laid the intellectual foundations, with the modern concept emerging in response to financial instability and banking crises.\nEarly influences include Irving Fisher's Great Depression reform proposals and Milton Friedman, who advocated for 100% reserve banking to minimize bank failure risk.\nContemporary development began in the 1980s savings and loan crisis, amidst questions of fractional-reserve stability. Academic work by economists John Kay, Laurence Kotlikoff, and others provided frameworks for narrow banking proposals.\nPost-2008 revival saw movement towards narrow banking with the Federal Reserve paying interest on reserves. The crisis showed the systemic risk of banks' combined deposits and lending. Academic research and policy discussion about fundamental banking reform increased.\nArguments in favor\nNarrow banking proponents make several arguments for fundamentally restructuring the banking system:\nFinancial stability would be improved since narrow banks would be immune to traditional bank runs. Removing risk of default and interest rate changes would reduce the need for deposit insurance.\nMarket discipline would apply to separate lending organizations since they would not be insured by the government.\nReduced moral hazard would result from removing deposit insurance for lending activities.\nPayment system stability would be enhanced by narrow banks' risk-free balance sheets. Depositors could be confident in deposit availability without taxpayer risk.\nCriticisms and concerns\nCritics of narrow banking raise several significant objections to the proposal:\nCredit availability concerns focus on whether specialized lending would adequately replace bank lending. Critics argue removing bank lending could reduce credit availability for small businesses and consumers.\nEconomic efficiency questions center on economies of scope and whether separation of functions would limit income stability of banks.\nImplementation challenges include restructuring to separate existing bank functions and the possibility of regulatory arbitrage as financial institutions adapt to supervision.\nProcyclical effects concern some critics who worry savers will shift cash to the protected sector when economic conditions worsen.\nRegulatory response\nUnited States regulatory stance became clear in 2019 when the Federal Reserve denied the TNB USA Inc. application to create a narrow bank, citing the potential for narrow banks to \"complicate the implementation of monetary policy,\" drain deposits from traditional banks, and affect the broader financial system's liquidity.\nOngoing regulatory debate continues among policymakers and academics on whether regulatory frameworks adequately address narrow banking. Some argue for a regulatory sandbox for niche banks.\nHistorical examples\nIn the 17th century, the Bank of Amsterdam operated as 100% reserve.\nThe Mit Ghamr Savings Bank in Egypt ran from 1963-67. It neither charged nor paid interest but shared profit. Islamic banking and finance requires tying financial transactions to real assets.\nSee also\n* Full-reserve banking\n* Monetary reform\n* Reserve requirement\n* Positive Money\n* Money market fund\nReferences\nja:ナローバンク論"
