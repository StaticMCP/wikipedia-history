According to the Records of the Three Kingdoms, he was the mentor of Liu Bei and Gongsun Zan. He was described as a tall man (approximately 1.89 metres or 6'2\") with a sonorous voice.\nLife\nLu Zhi was born in Zhuo Commandery }},}} Zhuōjùn; present-day Zhuozhou, Hebei). He studied under Ma Rong and Zheng Xuan was one of his classmates. As Ma Rong was a consort kin, his family was wealthy and his household had many songstresses and dancers. During his time studying with Ma Rong, Lu Zhi concentrated on his studies and never once looked at the songstresses and dancers, earning his teacher's respect.\nIn August 168, as a civilian, Lu Zhi wrote to Dou Wu, father of the empress dowager Dou Miao, advising him not to accept the titles given to him and his family for his role in crowning Emperor Ling of Han; Dou rejected the advice.\nIn 175, a rebellion led by \"barbarians\" in Jiujiang broke out. On account of his literary and martial abilities, Lu Zhi was made Administrator of Jiujiang. The rebels surrendered to Lu peacefully; Lu later resigned, citing an illness.\nHe was among the most pre-eminent scholars of the era, known for his study of texts on Chinese rituals and his assistance in compiling the Han Records of the Eastern Lodge }},}} }},}} Dōngguān Hànjì). His students included Gao You, later a scholarly commentator on the Chinese classics; Liu Bei, later the emperor of Shu during the Three Kingdoms; his relative Liu Deran; and Gongsun Zan, later a regional warlord. While in the service of the Han government, Lu Zhi led imperial forces to attack the Yellow Turban rebels in 184, but was removed from command after the eunuch Zuo Feng () made false accusations against him; Lu Zhi had refused to bribe Zuo Feng.\nHuangfu Song, who took over command of the imperial troops from Lu Zhi, continued to use Lu as a strategist and reported his contributions to the imperial court. Thus, in the same year, Lu Zhi regained his post as Master of Writing (尚书). Later, he warned against Dong Zhuo's sudden displacement of Emperor Shao.\nAfter Dong Zhuo's rise to power, Lu eventually resigned from court, citing his old age and ill health. As he feared that he may be harmed, he left the capital via a secluded route. Indeed, Dong Zhuo did send troops after him, but did not manage to capture him. Lu Zhi then became a hermit in Shanggu Commandery, refusing all contact with outsiders, even as Yuan Shao invited him to become an advisor. Lu Zhi then died in 192.\nFamily and descendants\nLu Zhi's youngest son, Lu Yu (183 - April 257), later served in the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period. Lu Yu had 2 sons: Lu Qin (died 24 April 278) and Lu Ting, who both served the Western Jin dynasty. Lu Ting's son Lu Zhi (盧志) was a general for Sima Ying, one of the princes associated with the War of the Eight Princes. A daughter of Lu Yu married Hua Yi (華廙), son of Hua Biao (華表), son of Hua Xin.\nLu Zhi's eldest son (Lu Ting's grandson) was Lu Chen (盧諶; 285 - April 351). One of Lu Chen's great-grandsons was Lu Xun (盧循; died 1 June 411), who was the brother-in-law (husband of younger sister) of Jin rebel Sun En, and whom continued Sun's rebellion after his death.\nSee also\n* Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n* Chen Shou.
