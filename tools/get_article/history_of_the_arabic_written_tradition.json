Over the years other academics would add volumes to the work, for example Fuat Sezgin has updated Brockelmann's list by adding some 12,000 titles and 9,000 writers.\nPublication\nThe first edition of the work was first published in two volumes (1898–1902), and aimed to give a framework which divided Arabic literature into periods and subjects.

Abd ar-Rahman Badawi in his Encyclopedia of Orientalists describes it as \"the single and essential source for everything relating to Arabic manuscripts and the places where they are kept.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Full text of the original 1898–1902 edition (German)"
