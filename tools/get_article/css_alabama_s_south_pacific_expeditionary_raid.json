The raid lasted from the beginning of December 1863 to Christmas (December 25), when the ship's captain, Semmes, made a decision to turn west back toward Europe for a planned overhaul and refit.\nThe primary area of operation during this expeditionary raid, was the southern Pacific Ocean, steaming east and then turning back west toward the Strait of Malacca.\nRaid overview\nCSS Alabama passed the Karimata Strait and reached Pulo Condore, anchoring in the western harbor north of White Rock on December 2, 1863. After a few weeks of steaming, she headed back toward Singapore, anchoring at Pulo Aor on December 19.  Arriving in the Strait of Malacca on December 24, Captain Semmes overtook the English vessel Martaban before spotting Texan Star, which Alabama captured and burned.  On Christmas Day, December 25, 1863, Captain Semmes put the Texan Star prisoners on Malacca Island, and proceeded to turn down invitations for Christmas dinner from British colonists.\nOn December 26, 1863, Alabama is at sea again and comes across two ships; Sonora of Newburyport and Highlander of Boston. Both ships are burned, and Captain Semmes discontinues his raiding, deciding to use 1864 as a time to refit and repair back in France.\nRaid bounty\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background:white; color:black\"\n|+ 'CSS Alabamas Indian Ocean Expeditionary Raid'\n!
