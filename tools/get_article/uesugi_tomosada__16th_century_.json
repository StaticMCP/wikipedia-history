He established himself in the temple of Kandai-ji, which he fortified as a castle. However, Hōjō Ujitsuna took Kawagoe castle soon afterwards from Tomosada's uncle, Uesugi Tomonari.\nLater, in the 1545 at battle of Kawagoe, Tomosada allied itself with Ashikaga Haruuji and Uesugi Norimasa of Yamauchi against Hōjō Ujiyasu. He was killed in battle, and the attempt to regain the castle for the Uesugi was ultimately unsuccessful.\nWith Tomosada's death, the Ōgigayatsu branch came to an end.\nReferences\n*Derived from the corresponding article on the Japanese Wikipedia."
