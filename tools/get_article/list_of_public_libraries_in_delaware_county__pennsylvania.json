The Delaware County Libraries is a federation of 26 library organizations, with 28 branches. The law library in the county courthouse is not a member of the county system, but its holdings are listed in the system catalog.  The Upper Chichester Library is also located in the county but not part of the system.\nThe libraries in the county system are mostly independent non-profit organizations which are funded by local municipalities, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania through the county system, and from donations. Some of the libraries in the system are municipal entities.  A library card from any library in the system is valid at all other libraries in the system and at most libraries in the state.\nThe county system serves 550,000 residents with a collection of 1,400,000 volumes. 2,150,000 items circulate per year.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Image\n! scope=\"col\" | Founded\n! scope=\"col\" | Built\n! scope=\"col\" | Location\n! scope=\"col\" | Description\n|-\n|Aston Public Library\n|\n| 1977\n| c.1985\n| 3270 Concord Road, Aston\n|In the community center\n|-\n|Collingdale Public Library\n|\n|\n|\n|823 MacDade Blvd. Collingdale\n|\n|-\n|Darby Free Library\n|\n|1743\n|1872\n|1001 Main Street, Darby\n|Organized March 10, 1743 by 29 Quakers as a subscription library.
