      "text": "# Knights of Buckinghamshire\n\nThis article contains a list of the known knights of the shire who represented Buckinghamshire in the Parliament of England and similar bodies of lesser status between 1290 and 1660. It also includes details of Parliaments from 1265 to which elected knights of the shires were summoned.\nPreliminary notes\nThe parliamentary electoral constituency, representing the historic county of Buckinghamshire, was created in (1265): see Montfort's Parliament for further details and History of Buckinghamshire for maps of the historic county. This county constituency was represented by two knights of the shire until 1832 and three 1832–1885.\nKnights of the shire are known to have been summoned to most parliaments from 1290 (19th Parliament of King Edward I of England) and to every one from 1320 (19th Parliament of King Edward II of England).\nAlthough at some periods several Parliaments were held in a year, at others there were considerable gaps between Parliaments. Knights of the shire were also summoned to meetings which have not been classified as Parliaments by modern expert opinion. The names of the members in some Parliaments are not known.\nThe English civil year started on 25 March until 1752 (Scotland having changed to 1 January in 1600). The years used for parliaments in this article have been converted to the new style where necessary. Old style dates would be a year earlier than the new style for days between 1 January and 24 March, for example the Parliament of 18 March 1313 – 9 May 1313 (new style) would be 18 March 1312 – 9 May 1313 (old style). No attempt has been made to compensate for the eleven days which did not occur in September 1752 in both England and Scotland as well as other British controlled territories (when the day after 2 September was 14 September), so as to bring the British Empire fully in line with the Gregorian calendar.\nThe names of knights of the shire, taken from the list in The History and Antiquities of Buckinghamshire by George Lipscomb (unless a volume from the History of Parliament Trust on the House of Commons at a particular period is available), are given in alphabetical order for each group of representatives.\nThere are some minor variations in names from the source used, which unless the contrary is known, are assumed to relate to the same person. It is possible that some entries relate to different persons of the same name. Where such cases have been identified the persons have been distinguished by a Roman number after the name (in order of first election); except where the number used to distinguish different candidates of the same name during the same period, by the authors of the books on the House of Commons mention in the references section, are used.\nAs the dates of Parliaments came from a twentieth century source and the names of persons elected came from Lipscomb (published between 1831 and 1847) it was sometimes impossible to be certain, from those sources, who served in a Parliament and who attended other meetings accorded lesser status. There is also some uncertainty as to whether Lipscomb did or did not use new style years and if so whether the method used in his list is consistent. An attempt has been made to give the best fit possible and to indicate the year (and if necessary the number within the year) from Lipscomb's list. The places of some Parliaments were indicated in footnotes to Lipscomb's list and are given here as they may assist with further research to confirm the link between specific knights of the shire and a particular Parliament.\nKnights of the shire 1265–1660\nThe lists below commence with Montfort's Parliament in 1265, when for the first time elected representatives from counties (or shires), cities and boroughs were summoned to Parliament.\nIt is known that the Sheriffs of the English Counties were ordered to send knights of the shire to attend a number of Parliaments before 1265, but they were not required to have them chosen by election. No such summonses are known to have required the attendance of some citizens of cities or burgesses of other boroughs. Records of this sort of summons survive for the Oxford Parliament which was the 7th Parliament of King Henry III (assembled 27 October 1258 and presumed dissolved when writs de expensis were issued on 4 November 1258) and the 16th Parliament of the King (summoned 4 June 1264 and assembled 22 June 1264, although the date of dissolution is unknown).\nThe lists before 1320 exclude Parliaments to which elected commoners (representing the Commons or communities of England) were not known to have been summoned. All Parliaments are believed to have been held at Westminster, unless otherwise indicated.\nParliament of King Henry III\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!No.!!Summoned!!Elected!!Assembled!!Dissolved!!1st member!!2nd member\n|-\n|17th || 14 December 1264 || 1264–65 || 20 January 1265 || 15 February 1265 || unknown || unknown\n|-\n|-\n|}\nParliaments of King Edward I\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!No.!!Summoned!!Elected!!Assembled!!Dissolved!!1st member!!2nd member\n|-\n|1st (a) || 16 February 1275 || 1275 || 25 April 1275 || ... || unknown || unknown\n|-\n|2nd (b) || 1 September 1275 || 1275 || 13 October 1275 || 24 October 1275 || unknown || unknown\n|-\n|19th (c) || 13 June 1290 || 1290 || 15 July 1290 || ... || John de Pateshulle || William de Turville\n|-\n|20th || ... || 1290 || 27 October 1290 || ... || unknown || unknown\n|-\n|21st || ... || 1290–91 || 7 January 1291 || ... || unknown || unknown\n|-\n|22nd || ... || 1291–92 || 8 January 1292 || ... || unknown || unknown\n|-\n|25th || ... || ?1293 || > 29 March 1293 || ... || unknown || unknown\n|-\n|26th || ... || 1293 || 13 October 1293 || ... || unknown || unknown\n|-\n|27th || ... || 1293 || > 25 December 1293 || ... || unknown || unknown\n|-\n|29th (d) || 30 September 1295+ || 1295 || 27 November 1295 || 4 December 1295 || Laurence de Bluntesdene || Roger de Tiringham\n|-\n|30th || 26 August 1296 || 1296 || 3 November 1296 || 29 November 1296 || unknown || unknown\n|-\n|33rd (e) || 6 October 1297 || 1297 || 15 September 1297 || 14 October 1297 || Robert Barry || Amery de Nowers\n|-\n|34th (f) || 15 March 1298 || March 1298 || 30 March 1298 || ... || Laurence de Bluntesdene || John de Chetewood\n|-\n|35th (g) || 10 April 1298 || 1298 || 25 May 1298 || ... || unknown || unknown\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 39th (h) ||rowspan=\"2\"| 29 December 1299 || 1299–00 ||rowspan=\"2\"| 6 March 1300 ||rowspan=\"2\"| 20 March 1300 ||rowspan=\"2\"| Hugh de Chastillon || Robert Pogeys\n|-\n| 1300 || Gerard de Braybroke I\n|-\n|40th (i) || 26 September 1300 || 1300–01 || 20 January 1301 || 30 January 1301 || Gerard de Braybroke I || Hugh de Chastillon\n|-\n|42nd (j) || 14 July 1302 || 1302 || 14 October 1302 || 21 October 1302 || John de Chetewood || William de Santresdon\n|-\n|43rd (k) || 12 November 1304 || 1304–05 || 28 February 1305 || 20 March 1305 || Roger de Tyringham || John Neyrunt\n|-\n|45th (l) || 5 April 1306 || 1306 || 30 May 1306 || 30 May 1306 || William Beauchamp || John Giffard\n|-\n|46th (m) || 3 November 1306 || 1306–07 || 20 January 1307 || 19 March 1307 || Miles de Beauchamp || Ralph de Wedon\n|-\n|}\nNotes:-\n* (a) 1st: For the first time since 1264–65 the representatives of the communities of the Realm are known to have been summoned to Parliament.\n* (b) 2nd: The knights of the shires only were summoned to this Parliament.

Commonwealth of England period. It existed (in a sense) de jure 1640–1660, as under a pre-English Civil War law, the Long Parliament could not be lawfully dissolved without its own consent which it did not give until 1660. As it was a Parliament originally summoned by King Charles I, the overall dates of the Long Parliament are given in the previous section.\nThe Barebones Parliament was an appointed body, so the county was not as such represented in it. That body was summoned on 20 June 1653, first met on 4 July 1653 and was dissolved on 12 December 1653.\nParliaments of the Protectorate\nDuring the Protectorate the county was allocated five representatives in the First and the Second Protectorate Parliaments (summoned 1 June 1654 and 10 July 1656 respectively), before reverting to two for the Third Protectorate Parliament (summoned 9 December 1658).\nThe boroughs of Aylesbury, Buckingham Town and Wycombe retained one seat each in the first two Parliaments, but the traditional pattern of constituencies and of seats was reintroduced for the third.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!No.!!Assembled!!Dissolved!!1st member!!2nd member!!3rd member!!4th member!!5th member\n|-\n|1st||3 September 1654||22 January 1655|| Bulstrode Whitelocke ||Richard Ingoldsby || George Fleetwood || Sir Richard Pigot || Richard Greenville\n|-\n|2nd||17 September 1656||4 February 1658|| Bulstrode Whitelocke || Richard Ingoldsby || Richard Hampden || Sir Richard Pigot || Richard Greenville\n|-\n|3rd||27 January 1659||22 April 1659|| Richard Greenville || William Bowyer\n|-\n|}\nIndex\n* John de Adingrave 1313:3 1333:1\n* Philip de Aylesbury 1324 1338 1340:1 1340:2 1341:1 1341:4 1344:1\n* Robert Barry 1297 1313:1\n* Miles de Beauchamp 1307 1314\n* William Beauchamp 1306\n* Ralph de Bellofago 1312:1\n* William de Berkhamstede 1337\n* John Blaket 1315:1 1327:2 1328 1329:4 1339:2\n* Thomas Blaket 1334 1335:1 1335:2\n* Laurence de Bluntesdene 1295 1298\n* Gerard de Braybroke I 1300:1 1300:2\n* Gerard de Braybroke II 1309 1336 1341:3\n* Gerard de Braybroke ? 1345\n* Gerard de Braybroke III 1352 1353:1\n* John Bryan 1339:1\n* Henry de Chalfhunte 1348 1349:1 1349:2\n* Hugh de Chastillon 1300:1 1300:2\n* John de Chastillon 1342 1344:2\n* Masculin de Chastillon 1313:3 1327:2 1329:3 1331:1 1333:1 1333:2\n* Richard de Chastillon 1332 1342\n* John de Chetewood 1298 1302\n* John de Chetyngton 1339:2\n* John de Cifrewast 1332\n* Henry Fermband 1349:1\n* James Freysel 1325 1329:1 1330 1331:1\n* John Giffard 1306 1309 1315:2 (de Boef) 1316 1341:4\n* John de Hampden 1353:1\n* John de Hamstede 1336\n* John de la Haye 1319 1329:2\n* Thomas de la Haye 1337\n* Hugh de Kymbell 1352\n* Geffrey de Lacy 1353:2 1354 1355\n* Alan de Leaumes 1323 1341:2\n* Robert Malet 1311 1312:1 1312:2 1313:2 1314 1315:1 1322 1323 1324 1326 1334 1335:2 1341:2 1344:1\n* John de Mareschal (1) 1329:1 1330\n* John Fitz-Ralph de Mareschal 1331:2\n* John Neyrunt 1305\n* Amery de Nowers 1297\n* John de Olney 1317\n* Richard Passelewe 1340:2\n* John de Pateshulle 1290\n* John de la Penne 1319 1327:1\n* Robert Pogeys 1300:1\n* Walter Poule 1338\n* Roger de Puttenham 1355\n* Thomas de Reynes 1340:1 1344:2 1347\n* Andrew de St. Liz 1326 1327:1 1329:2 1329:3\n* Thomas de Sakevill 1325\n* Alexander de Sanderton 1347\n* William de Santresdon 1302\n* John de Stretle 1333:2 1335:1\n* Robert de Tothale 1313:2\n* Roger de Tourney 1328\n* Nicholas de Turville 1315:2 1316 1317\n* William de Turville 1290\n* Roger de Tyringham 1295 1305 1329:4 1341:1\n* Richard de la Vache 1341:3\n* John le Veinour 1348 1349:2\n* Richard le Warde 1339:1\n* Ralph de Wedon 1307 1311 1312:2 1322 1331:2\nSee also\n* List of MPs for Buckinghamshire- MPs from 1660 onwards.\n* List of former United Kingdom Parliament constituencies\n* Unreformed House of Commons\n* List of parliaments of England\n* Duration of English parliaments before 1660\nReferences\n* The History and Antiquities of Buckinghamshire, Vol. 1, by George Lipscomb (1847)\n* The House of Commons 1509–1558, by S.T.
