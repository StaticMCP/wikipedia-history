The Leas-Cheann Comhairle acts as a member in place of the Ceann Comhairle if that office is vacant. The Leas-Chathaoirleach acts as a member in place of the Cathaoirleach if that office is vacant. The Commission may act with at least two members.\nPrior to the ratification by referendum on 4 October 2013 of the Thirty-third Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland, which established the Court of Appeal, Article 14 specified that the President of the High Court would act as a member in place of the Chief Justice. However, the Thirty-third Amendment placed the President of the new Court of Appeal ahead of the President of the High Court in the Irish judicial hierarchy, as the second most senior judge in the country. This necessitated the amendment to the membership of the Presidential Commission.\nA proposal to abolish the Seanad, which was rejected at referendum in 2013, would have seen the Leas-Cheann Comhairle take the place of the Cathaoirleach on the Commission.\nPowers\nThe Presidential Commission fulfills all functions and duties of the office of President of Ireland when the office of President is vacant, or when the President is unavailable.\nVacancy may occur:\n* on the death of the incumbent, as in 1974;\n* on the resignation of the incumbent, as in 1976 and 1997;\n* by impeachment of the incumbent, which has never happened;\n* in the short interval between the conclusion of one president's term of office and the inauguration of a successor the next day — although the Presidential Commission has never been required to act in this time.\nThe Presidential Commission has often acted when the president is abroad, typically while making a state visit. When the 22nd government of Ireland collapsed in November 1992, president Mary Robinson was abroad. The resignation of the Progressive Democrats ministers, the appointment by Taoiseach Albert Reynolds of caretaker Fianna Fáil replacement ministers, and Reynolds' request for a dissolution of the Dáil, were all effected by the Presidential Commission. Temporary illness may also indispose the President. No President has ever refused to fulfil any of the duties of office.\nBills have occasionally been signed into law by the presidential commission while the president is out of the country; for example, the presidential commission signed the Marriage Act 2015 legislating for same-sex marriage as Michael D. Higgins was in the United States.\nOrigins\nThe Presidential Commission was created in the 1937 Constitution of Ireland. It was first used between 29 December 1937, when the Constitution came into force, and 25 June 1938, when the first president was inaugurated. During this period, under the Transitory Provisions of the Constitution, the commission consisted of Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, and the Ceann Comhairle. Its composition differed from later commissions, as Seanad Éireann had not been constituted and elected.\nMembers of the Presidential Commission as acting President of Ireland\n1937&ndash;1938\nFrom the adoption of the Constitution of Ireland to the inauguration of Douglas Hyde.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Office\n!colspan=2|Period\n|-\n|Timothy Sullivan\n|Chief Justice\n|rowspan=3|29 December 1937\n|rowspan=3|25 June 1938\n|-\n|Frank Fahy\n|Ceann Comhairle\n|-\n|Conor Maguire\n|President of the High Court\n|}\n1974\nFrom the death of Erskine H.
