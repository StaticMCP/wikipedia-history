He graduated from Harvard University in 1854, embarked on a journey to Europe with Atherton Blight, and then studied in Germany. After returning to the United States, he was admitted to the Philadelphia Bar in 1858, but his growing deafness interfered with the practice of law.\nIn 1860, he joined the Shakspere Society of Philadelphia, an amateur study group that took its scholarship seriously. As he later wrote:\nAs editor of the \"New Variorum\" editions of Shakespeare—also called the \"Furness Variorum\"—he collected in a single source 300 years of references, antecedent works, influences and commentaries. He devoted more than forty years to the series, completing the annotation of sixteen plays. His son, Horace Howard Furness, Jr. (1865–1930), joined as co-editor of the Variorum's later volumes, and continued the project after the father's death, annotating three additional plays and revising two others.\nHe was a lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania, a long-serving trustee (1880–1904), and chairman of the building committee for its library. Designed by his brother Frank,  Horace selected the Shakepearean quotes for the 1891 building's leaded glass windows. He was the advisor for doctoral student Emily Jordan Folger who, with her husband Henry Clay Folger, would co-found the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC.\nAn 1890 review in ''Blackwood's Magazine'' may indicate the esteem in which British critics held Furness's scholarship:\nHe died on August 13, 1912, and was interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.\nNew Variorum\n[[File:HHFurness.jpg|thumb|Horace Howard Furness in his brick library at \"Lindenshade,\" c. 1910]]\n.]]\nVolumes edited by Horace Howard Furness\nThese volumes went through a number of reprints: the external links connect to the last online edition available.\n*[https://archive.org/details/romeoandjuliet01furngoog Romeo and Juliet] (published 1871)\n*[https://archive.org/details/newvariorumediti10shak Macbeth] (1873)\n*[https://archive.org/details/anewvariorumedi02furngoog Hamlet, vol. 1] (1877)\n*[https://archive.org/details/anewvariorumedi10furngoog Hamlet, vol. 2] (1877)\n*[https://archive.org/details/kingleareditedb02furngoog King Lear] (1880)\n*[https://archive.org/details/anewvariorumedi06furngoog Othello] (1886)\n*[https://archive.org/details/merchantvenice01furngoog Merchant of Venice] (1888)\n*[https://archive.org/details/anewvariorumedi03furngoog As You Like It] (1891, copyright 1890)\n*[https://archive.org/details/tempest00furngoog The Tempest] (1892)\n*[https://archive.org/details/amidsommernight01furngoog A Midsommer Nights Dreame] (1895)\n*[https://archive.org/details/anewvariorumedi08furngoog ''The Winter's Tale] (1898)\n*[https://archive.org/details/twelfenightorwh01furngoog Twelfth Night] (1901)\n*[https://archive.org/details/muchadoeaboutno00furngoog Much Ado About Nothing] (1904)\n*[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433075794176;view=1up;seq=8 Love's Labors Lost] (1904)\n*[https://archive.org/details/tragedieanthoni00furngoog Anthony and Cleopatra] (1907)\n*[https://archive.org/details/tragedyrichardt00furngoog Richard III] (1908)\n*[https://archive.org/details/tragedieofcymbel00shak Cymbeline] (1913) (published posthumously)\nVolumes edited by H.
