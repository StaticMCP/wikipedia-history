She was educated at Abbot's Hill School. On 27 January 1937, she married Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk at the Brompton Oratory. She did not convert to Roman Catholicism, her husband's religion. They had four daughters, only one (the youngest) of whom has children:\n* Lady Anne Fitzalan-Howard, later 14th Lady Herries of Terregles (1938–2014); married Colin Cowdrey, Baron Cowdrey of Tonbridge\n* Lady Mary Fitzalan-Howard, later 15th Lady Herries of Terregles (1940–2017); married Anthony Mumford\n* Lady Sarah Fitzalan-Howard (1941–2015); married Nigel Clutton\n* Lady Jane Fitzalan-Howard, later 16th Lady Herries of Terregles (b. 1945); married Michael Kerr, 13th Marquess of Lothian\nAt the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1937, the Duchess of Norfolk was one of four duchesses who held the canopy above Queen Elizabeth during the latter's anointing. In 1953, she took the part of Queen Elizabeth II during dress rehearsals for the coronation at Westminster Abbey. The Duke of Norfolk was hereditary Earl Marshal and organised both coronations as well as important state events in later years.\nCharities\nThe Duchess was involved with many charities and was appointed a CBE in 1971 for her work. Among firsts for women, she was the first woman Lord Lieutenant as Lord Lieutenant of West Sussex from 1975 (a post she took over from her husband after his death that year), first woman steward of Goodwood from 1975 and the first non-royal Lady Companion of the Order of the Garter.\nThe Duchess was Princess Anne's predecessor in the presidency of the Riding for the Disabled Association. The presidency passed from the Duchess to the Princess in 1986.\nSport\nFor many years, the traditional curtain-raiser to the English international cricket season was a match between Lavinia, Duchess of Norfolk's XI and the visitors, played at Arundel Castle. It played on in the Duchess' name after the Duke's death in 1975, reverting to its original name after her own death in 1995.\nThe Duchess was an owner of racehorses: her best winners included Moon Madness, Sheriff's Star and Lucky Moon (Goodwood Cup).\nArms\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.thepeerage.com/p6064.htm#i60636 Entry at ThePeerage.com]"
