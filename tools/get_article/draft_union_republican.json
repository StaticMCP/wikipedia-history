Edward Addicks in his bid for the United States Senate seat from Delaware.\nThe faction started in 1892 when Addicks began attempts to become a United States Senator. His attempts led to the Republican Party being split into supporters of Addicks, the Union Republicans, and those who opposed him, who were known as the Regular Republicans. Due to the divide, and as Senators were elected by state legislatures instead of through a direct election, an inability for either side to get a majority resulted in Delaware having a vacant Senate seat for 10 years, including having no members at all for two years. Addicks ended his attempts following the 1904 elections, when a decline in copper stocks led to his financial ruin.\nBackground\nJ. Edward Addicks was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and entered business at age 15. He was the son of a minor politician who also was president of a group known as the \"Union Republican club.\" Following five years of work at a dry goods business, he began serving as a partner to the owner of a flour mill in Philadelphia. He lost money from the Panic of 1873 and then went into railroad and real estate businesses. He also purchased several natural gas franchises, an industry that began rapidly developing, and made his money by forming monopolies. One of his purchases was a market in Wilmington, Delaware, and he also bought an estate in Claymont.\nAlthough he spent most of his time outside of Delaware, he announced his candidacy as a Republican for one of the state's United States Senate seats in 1888–89, causing \"quite a ripple in Delaware politics\" while being described as \"the mysterious candidate for the senate.\" The New York Times, in 1902, commented that \"[Addicks] conceived the idea of buying a seat in what was and is in his eyes the finest club in the world. If he had then or has now any idea of entering the Senate as an actual legisla[t]or and deliberator, he has kept that idea secret.\" As to why he chose Delaware, The Times said that \"Why Addicks selected Delaware for his venture is a question to be answered. It has been said that it was because he found the [[Delaware General Assembly|Delaware [General] Assembly]] an easy one to 'work' when he wanted a charter for one of his companies.\" The magazine Delaware Today noted that \"Addicks was a Republican, but seemed to have no political agenda. He never announced a platform.\" In his first attempt at the Senate, Addicks lost to Anthony Higgins, who was elected to the seat, although it took 43 ballots. The Times reported that although \"[h]is proposition fell flat, and while the people laughed at him[,] he set to work.\"\nHistory\nEarly history\nAddicks began using his money to gain supporters and by the 1892–93 United States Senate elections had brought together a faction known as the \"Union Republican Party\" or the \"Union Republicans\"; however, the Democrats won control of the Delaware General Assembly and elected George Gray. From 1893 to 1894, he spent at least $150,000 to support Republicans in hopes that they would support him for Senate; included among his payments were spendings to satisfy the poll taxes of voters and bribes to win people over.\n1894–1895: Winning the Delaware General Assembly\nHis efforts resulted in Republicans winning a majority of the Delaware General Assembly seats, and to try to convince the members to vote for him for Senate, he \"pointed out that Delaware might have remained forever Democratic without Addicks, and that he should be rewarded. To strengthen his argument, Addicks at once flooded the lobbies of the State House with his money,\" reported The New York Times. Although his efforts to get people to vote for Republicans were legal, they were criticized by many; major area newspapers, such as the Delaware Gazette and State Journal, Every Evening, The Morning News as well as the Middletown Transcript, with a notable exception of the Georgetown Daily Republican, denounced his efforts to win through \"bribery and corruption,\" and the Transcript noted that the \"newspapers of all parties are speaking with unanimity. If the Republicans of Delaware do not promptly and effectually stamp on this corrupt and scandalous movement they will inflict [incalculable] injury on themselves and their party. They will alienate all sympathy from outside and will destroy all hope of further success at home.\" The Transcript furthermore commented that \"No man will be for Addicks who is not in some way the immediate beneficiary of his corrupt and disgraceful methods. Independent of the scandal which comes to emphasize his personal disqualification and to repel every citizen who has any sense of private decency and public honor, the pretensions of this impudent jobber to be a member of the highest legislative body in the land are so ludicrous and absurd that they could secure no toleration in any quarter except for some personal consideration.\"\nIn the book Delaware: A Bicentennial History, Carol E. Hoffecker noted that \"Addicks's presence and tactics split the [Republicans]. While some jubilant Republicans saw Addicks's money as manna from heaven and flocked to support his senatorial campaign, others, particularly among the old party men of the northern county, regarded him as a self-seeking carpetbagger.\" Many of the Republicans from New Castle County were opposed to Addicks' senatorial bid; The Morning News published an article interviewing 11 \"prominent\" members of the party from Wilmington, all of whom were against him. Addicks' Union Republican faction not only had different views from the other Republicans, who would go on to be known as \"Regular Republicans,\" on whether to elect Addicks for Senate, but on candidates for other offices as well, starting with the Delaware Speaker of the House election at the beginning of the 88th Delaware General Assembly. Supporters of the Union Republicans were mainly located in Delaware's lower two counties, Kent and Sussex, while the northern county, New Castle, was \"dominated\" by those of the anti-Addicks faction.\nwas the closest to gaining election to the Senate, but was unable to be elected due to four Union Republicans standing by their slogan of \"Addicks or Nobody\"]]\nWhen it became time for the General Assembly to choose the state's next senator after the expiration of Higgins' term, two weeks after the start of the 88th Assembly session, the Republicans were divided.}} they stood by their slogan of \"Addicks or Nobody\" and, as the Republicans had only 19 of 30 seats and six refused to vote for anyone but Addicks, a deadlock took place. On the first day of voting, one vote resulted in a split ballot, whereas day two resulted in two more of the same; at mid-day every day thereafter the sessions resumed and could not elect a senator. The initial ballots resulted in Higgins receiving nine votes, Addicks six, and the others being for various others from both Republican and Democratic parties. When it became clear to the anti-Addicks Republicans that Higgins would be unable to receive a majority, the faction began going through other candidates to try to get the Unions to budge; on May 8, in the fifth month of voting, Henry A. du Pont was nominated for the post, and he had more success, flipping two Union Republicans, but his best result was one vote short. There were 48 votes held on May 8 and 28 the following day, including one point were a du Pont victory appeared to have occurred but ultimately did not: the state's governor had died and a the Democratic state senate president became his successor under the state's constitution. As the vote was going on for Senate, the new governor decided to cast a vote, which caused what would have been a du Pont majority to be a tie. The du Pont supporters were \"livid with rage\" and the members of the assembly then adjourned sine die, having not elected a senator in 210 ballots and leaving Delaware one senator short in Congress.\n1896–1897: Split,  Democratic control and Constitutional Convention\nRelations between the Republicans supporting Addicks and opposing him worsened until in 1896, the Addicks supporters held their own state convention separate from the other Republicans and officially adopted the name of the \"Union Republican Party,\" while thereafter the Addicks opposers became commonly known as the \"Regular Republicans.\" Both sides sent delegates to the Republican National Convention, held in St. Louis, Missouri, and submitted claims to decide which side would be considered as the true Republican Party. The American Magazine noted that \"a heated hearing\" was held, in which Regular Republican John C. Higgins called Addicks a \"moral idiot,\" and ultimately the regulars \"received the seal of party regularity.\"\nAlthough rejected at St. Louis, The American Magazine reported that the Union Republicans \"redoubled\" their efforts afterwards. The split greatly harmed the Republicans, both Union and Regular, in state politics; The Evening Journal noted that \"The Democrats are united on their entire ticket, while the Republicans and Addicksites are agreed upon candidates in some instances, and at loggerheads in others. Those Republicans who have Addicks endorsement have an excellent fighting chance, but the other regulars and their Addicksite opponents have no chance whatsoever.\" While there was agreement between all the Republicans on some state-wide ballots, for example the election for receiver of taxes and county treasurer, there were many splits on the nominees, most notably for governor; the Democrats nominated Ebe W. Tunnell, the Regulars nominated John C. Higgins, while the Unions chose John H. Hoffecker of Smyrna, and despite rumors of the factions uniting in selecting a candidate, they did not. Hoffecker ultimately received 11,014 votes, Higgins 7,154 (a combined 18,168 Republican votes), but Tunnell received the plurality with 15,507 votes and was elected governor. The Smyrna Times commented that \"[h]ad the Republican party been united on [Hoffecker], his victory would have been a magnificent majority and the whole [s]tate Republican.\" The split of the parties also resulted in the Democrats taking not only the governorship, but a majority of the Delaware General Assembly as well, allowing them to elect George Gray as senator. Of all the state and county-wide races the Union Republicans entered, only their candidates for sheriff, coroner, Kent County treasurer and several choices for the Levy Court were elected.\nStarting in December 1896, and lasting until June 1897, a Delaware constitutional convention was held with 30 delegates; 16 Democrats were elected and 14 Republicans, nine of whom were anti-Addicks and five Union Republicans, although the elections to the convention were marred by accusations of fraud by the Unions, who claimed that 10 of their nominees had actually won. The five Union Republicans ultimately seated at the convention included David S. Clark, Dr. Paris T. Carlisle, William T. Smithers, John W. Hering and George H. Murray, all of Kent County. Among the results of the convention was the increasing of the Delaware General Assembly size from 30 to 52 seats, and the elimination of the poll tax. The elimination of the poll tax meant that Addicks would go on to use direct bribes in order to get votes, including some cases as much as $50 per vote, or the paying off of voters' mortgages.\nTensions between the regulars and Unions worsened in February 1897, when the Unions proposed a meeting for reconciliation, the regulars agreed and went to the location, and the Unions never showed up, due to Addicks declaring that he did not like the idea; The Morning News reported that \"[a]s a result[,] the regulars declared that all talk of coming together was ended.\" However, both sides attended several conferences for the same purpose in September 1897, but still were unable to find unity. A reporter for The Philadelphia Inquirer noted that the Unions had \"a suspicion\" that the regulars were working with the federal government to get their candidates elected to national-level offices despite Unions having higher amounts of votes in the elections; the faction was \"angered\" by how, as the Inquirer reporter stated, \"the offices have, one after the other, gone to the regular side of the house,\" especially with the appointment of far-regular Frederick E. Bach to the role of superintendent of rural free delivery.\n1898–1899\nIn February 1898, state senator Hanby died, issuing a \"staggering blow\" to the party, according to The Philadelphia Times, as he was the second-most influential Union Republican behind Addicks and their only representative in the senate. Around this time, Regular Republican Bach organized a group known as the \"Lincoln Republican Club,\" headed by a local mayor who was part of the Unions, in order to try to bring the groups back together. Meanwhile, Addicks continued spending large amounts of money to try to win over influential men and gain more votes; The Outlook commented that \"[h]ow much he spent ... it is impossible to state,\" although Addicks admitted he spent at least $250,000 that year.\nAs the year went on, some progress was made towards unity between the factions, with them joint-submitting candidates for certain posts. A merger agreement was decided in June 1898 between the factions in Wilmington, with further discussion to have a single Republican ticket taking place shortly after. However, at a meeting in early July the sides failed to agree on several issues and remained split. A later meeting between Union members resulted in a number of them refusing to support a unification. The split was reaffirmed when, in August, both sides scheduled different primary selection dates; but in early September, it was reported that they decided to unify, with each side agreeing on candidates for most offices. The Unions then held a snap convention which brought back the split. Around this time, Addicks declared his intention to continue his efforts to be a senator \"until 1950\". Mid-September, an offer was made by the Regulars that they would support all statewide and local Union candidates as long as the national appointees would be Regulars; the Unions rejected this offer and thus the Regulars nominated their own candidates for most offices.\nDespite the split, the Republican party won 31 seats in the 52-member Delaware General Assembly (two did not take their seats, leaving it at 50 for the time); of the 29 to take their seats, 15 were part of the \"Addicks or nobody\" faction and 14 were part of the faction which was called the \"anybody but Addicks\" faction. The Democrats had a one-seat majority in the state senate while the Republicans had a majority of the house seats. From the start, conflict between the two factions took place; it took 92 ballots to elect the Speaker of the House. An agreement had been made that if Addicks did not have enough support to succeed George Gray as senator, the Unions were to choose a different candidate, but this was ignored when the voting actually took place. Ballots continued day after day and the Regulars nominated a dozen different candidates, but were unable to get the support of any Unions. Eventually, three Regulars flipped and supported Addicks, giving him 18 votes out of a needed 26. Soon after, rumors spread that the next ballot was \"fixed\" in favor of Addicks winning, and \"the Legislative Hall was packed, the excitement was intense, and Addicks's sympathizers were offering bets on his election,\" according to The American Magazine. As the roll call went on, a Democrat stunned the spectators by announcing his support for Addicks; chants of \"Judas!\" and \"Traitor!\" ensued. Two more Democrats flipped soon after, leaving Addicks with just five more votes needed for election, but spectators then began calling out \"Kill them!\" and \"Lynch the traitors!\" The American Magazine reported that it appeared as if \"the session would end in riot and murder\". Balloting was then stopped and the Democrats who voted for Addicks needed to be escorted by policemen; no more Democrats flipped and the Assembly adjourned once again without a Senator, having done 113 ballots. A record of the ballots in The Morning News noted that the Regular Republicans voted for 15 different candidates, the Democrats nominated 16 of their candidates, while every time each Union vote was for Addicks.\nIn local Wilmington elections held from May to June 1899, the factions remained split with different nominees for each position and the Democrats swept all races; newspapers credited the Democrats' victories to the Union Republicans. Later in June, the leaders of the party met with U.S. president William McKinley, although they later declared that McKinley was only trying to \"make fools of them\" due to believing that he had set up a patronage system with the Regulars.\n1900–1901: Two Senate vacancies\nBy this point, Delaware had become notorious throughout the country due to the Addicks affair: the book Delaware: A Bicentennial History noted that the \"National Republican party was acutely embarrassed by the bad publicity emanating from little Delaware, where journalists reported votes being sold as if at auction.\" Magazine The Outlook regularly reported on the event in Delaware, including sending a reporter down to the state who commented that it was \"a carnival of vote buying.\" Some from other states questioned why Delaware even deserved two Senators, considering they would not fill them.\nIn January 1900, \"rumors spread of a 'get together' movement\" that would unite the factions, but a proposal by the Unions was rejected by the Regulars. The Regulars noted that, among other reasons, they would not consent to unity unless there were a guarantee that Addicks were not to be a senator under any circumstance. While it was widely assumed that the January 1900 Union Republican proposals for unity were to be rejected, The Philadelphia Inquirer commented that the \"manner of rejection by the regulars took the people's breath.\" Whether the sides would unite at some point became a major and ongoing question; both factions initially scheduled state conventions on February 27, with the appearance that they would be able to meet and then discuss unity, but then shortly before the date the Regulars changed their convention day, leading Unions to think that the Regulars had \"deliberately la[id] a trap.\"\nOn April 3, 1900, the Union convention was ultimately held to send delegates to the 1900 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. When the National Convention was held in June, both the Regulars and Unions sent delegates, with each side claiming to be the true Republicans. A proposal was made at the Convention to seat delegates from both sides, but the Regulars strongly opposed such an action. With the help of Mark Hanna, who opposed what he called the \"stubbornness\" of the Regulars and thought that the Unions being seated would lead to Delaware Senate seats ultimately being filled, the Union side ultimately received the \"stamp of party regularity\", with Addicks becoming a National Committeeman.\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=2QuG62rGDbwC&q=addicks Outlook and Independent]\nhttps://delawaretoday.com/life-style/first-state-history-the-addicks-affair/\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=p8xIAQAAIAAJ&hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=j+edward+addicks+senate&pg=PA240&printsec=frontcover The International Year Book]\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=VElaAAAAYAAJ&hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=j+edward+addicks+senate&pg=PA399&printsec=frontcover American Monthly Review of Reviews]\nhttp://downfalldictionary.blogspot.com/2012/01/john-edward-addicks-not-for-sale.html\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=B6mLZn-PFmkC&hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22addicks%22+%22higgins%22+%221889%22&pg=PA161&printsec=frontcover American Illustrated Magazine]\n[https://archivesfiles.delaware.gov/ebooks/Democracy_In_Delaware.pdf Democracy in Delaware, The Story of the First State's General Assembly]\n[https://archivesfiles.delaware.gov/ebooks/Delaware_Bicentennial_History.pdf Delaware: A Bicentennial History]\nPolitical positions\nThe Philadelphia Times reported in September 1898 that \"Addicks is the one object of the Union Republicans, and were it not for this there would be absolutely no cause for dissension in the ranks of Delaware Republicans.\"\nA resolution adopted at a meeting on November 4, 1897, described the party's political views. Reprinted in the Middletown Transcript, it noted that (public domain) \"The Union Republican party of the State of Delaware, by their delegates in convention assembled, stands for unqualified and equal justice to all, without which, due respect for law is destroyed, social thrift obstructed, public peace disturbed and permanency of government imperiled. The Union Republican party stands for a reverential acquiescence in the expressed will of the majority, both in party management, and in municipal, state and national elections and legislation, for as the people are the recognized source of all political power and authority; so the will of the people can only be ascertained by the expressed will of the majority; and the ballotbox, which is the medium for the indication of that will and the enunciation of that authority, should be as impregnantly protected and as jealously guarded by the American voter. Whoever violates the ballot-box is a traitor to his country, an enemy to his race, a disgrace to human society and an object of contempt in the eyes of all patriots.\nThe Union Republican party stands for the largest and fullest interpretation of the Declaration, of Independence concerning the rights of man. It believes that anything in a system of government which tends to oppress any individual or any class is a defect in that system, and ought to be corrected as soon as possible; and that the mission of the Union Republican party of the country is to do that work in the future, as it has largely done it in the past. The Union Republican party believes in sound money, we mean a currency, every dollar of which shall be kept at par with every other dollar, and a standard in harmony with that of the leading commercial nations, so that our foreign and domestic trade may be healthy and unembarrassed, and our credit unquestioned in the money markets of the world; and we understand sound money under present conditions to mean a gold standard with all issues of. silver and paper kept at a parity by the pledged faith of the government. We believe that all notes of the government which are payable on demand in gold should be called in, and that such notes should only be issued when gold to the full amount of their face value is deposited in the treasury of the United States, to secure the redemption of them when so issued.\nBy a protective tariff, we mean not a tariff in anywise prohibitive, but a duty on foreign products equivalent to the difference between domestic and foreign wages, so that the American workman may have a fair competitive chance in the home market. We endorse the platform of principles adopted by the National Union Republican convention which met at St. Louis in June in 1896. Believing that the principles of the National Union Republican party are sound, right, entirely in accord with the purposes for which our national government was founded and best calculated to maintain \"a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to\" the citizens of these United States and their posterity; we congratulate the citizens of the nation that the policies and affairs of national government are formulated, declared, directed, managed and controlled by that party. The Union Republican party desires to express its sympathy with the struggling patriots of Cuba.\nWe believe that their independence will be secured as the price of noble patriotism and nameless sufferings, and that the dominion of Spain, a nation that has contributed nothing to the civilization of the world, nor the advancement of the human race for more than three centuries, will no longer desecrate the soil of that beautiful island with her barbarism, and that humanity and the commercial interests of the United States demand her intervention in the war now being waged in Cuba.\"\nResolution April 3rd, 1900:\n\"That firmly believing that the principles of the National Republican party are sound, right and entirely in accord with the purposes for which our national government was established and best calculated to maintain \"a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the blessings of liberty\" to the citizens of these United States and their prosperity, it again asserts its firm belief in and adherence to the organic principles of the National Republican party, and most unreservedly readopts each and every plank of the platform of the national party made and promulgated at St. Louis in the year A.D., 1896, excepting the one relating to the civil service law. 2— That prosperous, contented, happy condition of the people of the United States, which has existed since the return of the Republican party to the direction and control of the policies and affairs of the nation on March 4th, A. D., 1897, and still continues, was brought about and continued by reason of the confidence inspired by that return, and by the wise, sound, careful prudent, and patriotic management, control and direction of the national affairs by the present Republican Administration; and while we emphatically protest that in return for loyal support and the electoral vote of Delaware in 1896, the Union Republicans of this Slate have received unfair and unjust treatment by the present Administration, yet we believe that the general welfare and the exigencies of the nation, in order that certain beneficial, wise and good measures proposed.by the Administration, and not yet carried out to their fullest extent, demand and require the loyal support of toe Union Republicans of Delaware of the principles and candidates of the National Republican party. 3— That we heartily endorse and approve of the recent legislation by Congress by which the financial affairs of the nation are placed on a sound, safe, healthy and secure basis, and in view of that legislation we congratulate ourselves that we, first, in Slate Convention met, on November 4th, 1897, declared as follows: \"The Union Republican party believes in sound money, we mean a currency every dollar of which shall be kept at par with every other dollar, and a standard in harmony with that of leading commercial nations, so that our foreign and domestic trade may be healthy and unembarrassed, and our credit may be unquestioned in the money markets of the world; and we understand sound money, under present conditions, to mean the gold standard with all issues of silver and paper at a parity therewith by the pledged faith of the government. We believe that all notes of the government which are payable on demand in gold should be called in and that such notes should only be issued when gold to the full amount of their face value is deposited in the treasury of the United States, to secure the redemption of them when so issued,\"  and that on August 30th, 1898, again in State Convention met, also declared as follows: \"Believing that the money of the government should be the best in the world and that its value should be unquestioned everywhere, we demand the maintenance by the government of the present gold standard of the value of said money, that notes of the government payable on demand should only be issued when gold to the amount of the notes so issued is deposited with the national treasury for the redemption thereof, and that the gold so deposited shall be preserved and kept in such treasury for the sole purpose of redeeming such notes.\" We again positively affirm those beliefs in regard to the financial affairs of the government. 4— That while the Constitution and laws of the United States do not, by virtue of any inherent force, extend to our foreign possessions, yet we believe that that Constitution and those laws, so far as applicable, should, by appropriate legislation, be extended to said possessions; and that civil governments should be speedily established in those possessions. 5— That the armed rebellion existing in the Philippine Islands should be suppressed, and that if necessary the President should employ all the land and naval forces of the United States in rapidly accomplishing this end. ti—That an isthmian canal between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans should be constructed, owned, operated, managed, directed, controlled, and guarded solely by the government of the United States; and that to speedily accomplish this Congress should at once enact proper laws. 7-That our coasts should be should strongly and efficiently defended with the best munitions, weapons, defenses and men attainable for the protection of our people and their property. We also favor a strong and efficient navy, which is the strongest, best and most effective safeguard a from the effect of any foreign force. 8-That all combinations or trusts so called, whose operation, management and control increase the cost of any article or commodity to the consumer are a menace to the safety of the country and should be so regulated and controlled by proper and adequate legislation; that said operation, management and control will in the future. inure to the benefit of the people. And if it is found impossible to permit the existence of such combinations or trusts under restricted conditions, then we demand such legislation as will completely abolish them. 9-That imposts and duties should be continued on the manufactured goods of foreign countries, which enter into competition with American workmen, for his protection; and that such imposts and duties should be so laid that they discriminate in favor of goods imported in American ships. 10-That we endorse and approve of the bill now pending in Congress, for the rebuilding of our merchant marine and request our representatives in Congress to vote for and aid its passage as a law. 11-That the present laws of the United States which require the passing of any of the civil service examinations as a qualification to any office under the are not in accord with American institutions are calculated to establish and continue a privileged class of citizens, and ought to be repealed. 12-That just fair and honorable pensions should be granted to all those men who in time of peril to the nation, devoted their services to the defense thereof, and who in such services became disabled, and to the families of those who lost their lives in fighting for their country, the same pensions should be given by a grateful country. 13-That we condemn the legislation of the states L.y which a full and free opportunity for the honest expression of the will of the electors is prevented, and by which, under and by which, under forms of law, elections are a farce, and the true principles of government are ignored and set aside.  14— That the interstate commerce law ought to be rigidly and impartially enforced, so that the shipper of goods over a shorter haul should not be discriminated against in favor of a shipper of goods over a longer haul.\"\nNotable members and supporters\nAmong newspapers in support of the Union Republicans were the Milford Chronicle of Milford, the Delaware State Sentinel of Dover and the Smyrna Times of Smyrna. Another was The Union Republican of Georgetown, founded in 1898, which continued publishing until well after the party ceased.\nAlthough the party's actions were largely centered in Delaware, they had supporters in other states as well, including Pennsylvania ...\nChairmen\n* J.
