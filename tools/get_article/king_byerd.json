It is primarily used for cooking.\nThe fruit has green skin, which turns yellow when ripened, developing flecks of red and grey russet. It is harvested from late October, primarily in South-East England. It has a sharp, sweet taste, resulting in its mostly being recommended for cooking meals and desserts. It is considered at its best from January to March, when it mellows to have a sweet, sharp taste. The primary disease affecting the King Byerd cultivar is apple scab.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## King byerd\n\n#REDIRECT King Byerd"
