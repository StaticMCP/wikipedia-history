Previously known as the Firecracker Alternative Book Awards (FABs), in the current form they are known as the CLMP Firecracker Awards for Independently Published Literature, and are administered by the Community of Literary Magazines and Presses (CLMP).\nThe Firecracker Alternative Book Awards were established in 1996 and were presented through 2002. The Firecracker Awards returned in 2015, \"to celebrate books and magazines that make a significant contribution to our literary culture and the publishers that strive to introduce important voices to readers far and wide.\"\nNeither version of the Firecracker books awards are related to an identically named award given to \"women photographers born or working in Europe.\"\nProcess\nCLMP Firecracker Awards are given to one winner annually in each of five categories: Fiction, Creative Nonfiction, Poetry, Best Debut in Magazine, and General Excellence in Magazine. A shortlist of nominees in each category is announced beforehand. (There have previously been other categories but they have been retired or subsumed in the existing five.)\nAccording to a 2014 Publishers Weekly article, the awards are \"judged by a panel of writers, editors, booksellers, and agents. Members of the Firecracker Committee include representatives from, in addition to CLMP and the ABA, Tin House, Workman Publishing, Random House, Byliner, Greenlight Books, and a host of literary agents....\"\nIn the book categories, winning presses receive $1,000-2,000, and authors or translators receive $1,000. Magazine winners receive $1,000 each. The winning titles are also showcased in CLMP's national publicity campaigns.\nGenerally, the Firecrackers are announced each June. Each ceremony includes the naming of that year's recipient of the Lord Nose Award, \"given in recognition of a lifetime of superlative work in literary publishing.\"\nHistory\nThe Firecracker Alternative Book Awards were established in 1996 by John Davis of Koen Book Distribution, with support from Publishers Group West, Publishers Weekly, and Tower Books & Records. The FABs were designed to bring attention to \"the best in alternative printing\" by honoring books on the \"'unmapped edges of contemporary culture' that 'sharpen the cutting edge.'\" Categories included Fiction, Nonfiction,  Poetry, Politics, Sex, Music, Graphic Novel, Zine, Kids, Art/Photo, Drugs, and Special Recognition/Wildcard. Winners \"were selected via an online voting system.\"\nThe FABs were administered by volunteers rather than an official organization, and after 2002 the task became \"unsustainable.\" CLMP was approached at that time about continuing the awards, but the organization passed on the opportunity for a couple of reasons, one being that the voting system \"bore a lack of transparency that raised concerns,\" and the other being that CLMP felt it needed to gain more solid financial footing before it took on administering a set of literary awards.\nThe revitalized CLMP Firecracker Awards returned in 2015, \"broadening the focus from strictly unorthodox works.\"\nWinners\nFABs (1996–2002)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Firecracker Alternative Book Award winners\n!Year\n!Category\n!Author/Recipient\n!Title\n|-\n! rowspan=\"10\" | 1996\n!
