However, despite using the name \"office\", the organization \"was created out of necessity to fulfill some, if not all, of the functions of a political party\". It had branches all over the country.\nParliamentary election and presence\nOCPP issued an electoral list for the 1980 Iranian legislative election, that had candidates shared with the Freedom Movement, the National Front and the People's Mujahedin. The exclusive candidates of OCPP included Fathollah Banisadr (his brother), Mohammad Moballeghi-Eslami (Banisadr's choice for Channel 2) and Mohammad Ja'fari (editor-in-chief of Enghelabe Eslami). Ahmad Salamatian and Ahmad Ghazanfarpour were notable members elected to the parliament under banner of the organization.\nAccording to Houchang Chehabi, the group formed a minority in the parliament. Siavush Randjbar-Daemi estimates that they were less than a dozen deputies, however initially some forty independents were also \"ostensibly sympathetic to Banisadr\".\nSee also\n* List of Islamic political parties\nReferences"
