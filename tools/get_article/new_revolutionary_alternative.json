In 1998, RCWP member Alexander Biryukov carried out a bombing attack against the FSB. In April 1999, four women affiliated with the RCWP carried out a bombing of the Lubyanka Building, the headquarters of the FSB in Moscow. The latter bombing was allegedly carried out in protest against the carpet bombing of Grozny during the Second Chechen War. Following these attacks, the FSB announced the existence of a new far-left terrorist organisation, the \"New Revolutionary Alternative\", which the FSB held responsible for the bombings. In 2001, it was reported that NRA had also set off bombs in Moscow military offices (Ostankino in 1996 and Cheryomushkinsky in 1997).\nIn 2003, Nadezhda Raks, Olga Nevskaya, Larisa Romanova, and Tatiana Nekhorosheva-Sokolova were found guilty of the bombings. Romanova's sentence was later commuted. Alexander Biryukov was declared incompetent to stand trial and was sent to a psychiatric hospital.\nLegacy\nThe New Revolutionary Alternative has since become associated with anarchism and has been listed alongside other anarchist terrorist groups of the late 20th century, such as the German 2 June Movement and the Italian . The Combat Organization of Anarcho-Communists (BOAK) has cited the NRA as an inspiration for its attacks against Russian rail infrastructure following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nSee also\n*Anarchism in Russia\n*Black Guards\n*Chernoe Znamia\n*Narodnaya Volya\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\nNews articles\n*\n*\n*\nJournal articles\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nBook chapters\n*\n*\n*"
