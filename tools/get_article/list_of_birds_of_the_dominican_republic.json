The avifauna of the Dominican Republic included a total of 331 species as of October 2024, according to Bird Checklists of the World (Avibase). Of them, 16 have been introduced by humans and 85 are rare or accidental. One is endemic and an additional 28 species are endemic to the island of Hispaniola.\nThis list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 63rd Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them.\nThe following tags have been used to highlight several categories of occurrence.\n*(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in the Dominican Republic\n*(E-DR) Endemic-DR - a species endemic to the Dominican Republic\n*(E-H) Endemic-H - a species endemic to the island of Hispaniola\n*(Ex) Extirpated - a species that is no longer found in the island\n*(I) Introduced - a species introduced directly to the Dominican Republic or elsewhere in the New World\nDucks, geese, and waterfowl\nOrder: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae\nAnatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.
