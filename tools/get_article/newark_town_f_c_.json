The club disbanded at the start of the Second World War but the club had tasted FA Cup success during the early 1930s. They reached the second round of the FA Cup in the 1930–31 season and made the first round proper in three out of four seasons between 1929–30 and 1933–34.\nFor a brief period in the 1970s a group of players played under the Newark Town banner but it was not until the late 1980s that the club properly reformed. Initially the club only fielded junior teams but the decision was taken in 1994 to start an adults side and joined the Nottinghamshire Alliance in 1997. Newark progressed in that league, winning the Division One championship in 2003–04, earning the club promotion to the Central Midlands League. 2011 saw a re-organisation of the League and the club was placed in the South Division. They have since been transferred to the North Division.\nNewark Town won the Central Midlands League North Division title during the 2021–22 season and gained promotion to the United Counties League Division One which is step 6 in the National League System.\nCommunity Ownership\n\"Newark Town Football Club Limited was registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965.
