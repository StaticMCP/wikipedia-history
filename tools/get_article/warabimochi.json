Kuromitsu syrup is sometimes poured on top before serving as an added sweetener.\nHistory\nWarabimochi is a traditional Japanese dessert that is believed to date back to the Heian period (794-1185) in Japan, when it was a popular delicacy among the aristocracy. It was one of the favorite treats of Emperor Daigo.\nHayashi Razan's \"Heishin kikō (Travelogue of 1616) [...], which is considered to be the first travel diary to mention food on the road,\" highlighted Warabimochi as did other Tōkaidō travel guides in the 1600s. The dessert became more widespread during the Edo period (1603-1868) when it was served in tea houses as part of the traditional Japanese tea ceremony. It is now popular in the summertime, especially in the Kansai region and Okinawa.\nProduction\nWarabimochi differs from true mochi made from glutinous rice. Mochi refers to sticky food generally made with glutinous rice or waxy starch, and is categorized into tsuki-mochi and kone-mochi. Tsuki-mochi is a rice cake made by pounding steamed glutinous rice. Although warabimochi is not made from glutinous rice or other waxy starches, it is called \"mochi\" for its sticky texture.\nWarabimochi is also frequently made with katakuriko (potato starch) instead of bracken starch due to cost and availability. In 2021, Warabi starch sold for JPY 12,000–15,000 (USD 116–145)/kg, and it was 30–35 times more expensive than sweet potato or tapioca starch and 20–24 times more expensive than sago starch.\nFile:Warabimochi at Housen in Kyoto.jpg\nFile:Warabimochi yosimitsu.jpg|Dusted with kinako powder\nFile:Matcha warabimochi.jpg|With matcha and kuromitsu\nFile:抹茶蕨餅, 抹茶黃豆粉, 焦香黃豆粉, 108 MATCHA SARO 抹茶茶廊, 一〇八抹茶茶廊, 108 MATCHA SARO, 台北 (15256867190).jpg|With matcha powder\nFile:Warabi mochi 1.jpg|Warabimochi from a supermarket\nFile:Kurumi mochi.jpg|Kurumimochi (warabimochi filled with walnut paste)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.bashoudo.com/english/index.html Warabimochi]\n* [http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1234239 Homemade Warabimochi]"
