The battle ended in a Moroccan defeat, and the site of the battle was named after the defeated Moroccan king, Moulay Ismail.\nBackground\nOran which was then under Spanish rule was plagued by the attempts of Morocco and Algiers. Despite his previous unsuccessful siege in 1693, Moulay Ismail made another attempt to extend Moroccan domination to Oran in 1707. The Moroccan king raided the areas near Oran, with the objective of eventually taking control of the city.\nBattle\nThe attack took place in a forest not far from a small village called ''La Mare d'Eau.'' 35&nbsp;km east of Oran.\nMoulay Ismail and his army encountered the Bey of Mascara Mustapha Bouchelaghem who then severely defeated Moulay Ismail. Moulay Ismail's army was almost entirely destroyed.\nConsequences\nIt is said that the night of his defeat, while fleeing the battle, followed only by a few of his officers Ismail turned to them and said :«Oran is comparable to a viper sheltered under rock, misery to the unwise who touch it !».\nRight after the unsuccessful Moroccan invasion Mustapha Bouchelaghem captured Oran from the Spaniards.\nReferences"
