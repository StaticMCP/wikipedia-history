The American CIA puts them at 1.9% of the country's total population. Larger numbers of them can be found in the country's east, especially Ostrava and Brno, as the Czech Republic shares a border in the east with Slovakia. Brno especially is popular among Slovak university students.\nStatistics\nAccording to the 2021 census, ethnic Slovaks and people with some form of Slovak background formed 1.54% of the population of the Czech Republic (including those who included Slovak as their second ethnicity). In absolute numbers, that meant 162,578 people. People with Slovak ancestry can be found throughout the Czech Republic.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Rank\n!Region\n!Number of Slovaks\n!Share (%)\n|-\n|1\n|Prague\n|31,987\n|2.46\n|-\n|2\n|Moravian-Silesian\n|23,514\n|2.02\n|-\n|3\n|Central Bohemian\n|22,453\n|1.59\n|-\n|4\n|South Moravian\n|21,094\n|1.76\n|-\n|5\n|Ústí nad Labem\n|9,886\n|1.25\n|-\n|6\n|Plzeň\n|7,596\n|1.31\n|-\n|7\n|Olomouc\n|7,474\n|1.21\n|-\n|8\n|Zlín\n|6,938\n|1.23\n|-\n|9\n|South Bohemian\n|6,406\n|1.01\n|-\n|10\n|Karlovy Vary\n|5,745\n|2.06\n|-\n|11\n|Liberec\n|5,607\n|1.29\n|-\n|12\n|Hradec Králové\n|5,577\n|1.04\n|-\n|13\n|Pardubice\n|4,938\n|0.97\n|-\n|14\n|Vysočina\n|3,363\n|0.68\n|}\nNotable Czechs of Slovak origin\n* Andrej Babiš, politician and businessman\n* Erik Daniel, footballer\n* Martina Dubovská, alpine skier\nSee also\n*Czech Republic–Slovakia relations\n*Slovak diaspora\n*Demographics of the Czech Republic\n*Czechs in Slovakia\nReferences"
