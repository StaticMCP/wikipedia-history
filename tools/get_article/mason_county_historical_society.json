It operates the Mason County Research Center, the Port of Ludington Maritime Museum, and the White Pine Village, a living history museum, showcasing nineteenth-century history. The historical society hosts the Mason County Sports Hall of Fame and the Scottville Clown Band Collection, and maintains the Ludington Murals and the Pere Marquette Memorial Cross.\nHistory and organization\nThe Society was formally organized at the Mason County Courthouse on November 30, 1937, by 40 people. For many years, the Society lacked a permanent building; early displays were placed in various public buildings around Ludington, such as the City Center Building and the Ludington Public Library. In 1951, space was provided in a church basement, and in 1961, the Society acquired its own building at 305 E. Filer St., which served as both collection storage and display area. The organization formally  incorporated on May 15, 1957. In the late 1960s, the Society secured the Burr Caswell house, ’s oldest house, on the Buttersville Peninsula, which later became part of what was known as Pioneer Village, renamed Historic White Pine Village in 1976.\nMuseums and facilities\nThe Mason County Historical Society manages several sites related to regional history including:\nHistoric White Pine Village\nThere are thirty historic buildings in the vicinity of the museum, these include the Mason County Courthouse built in 1849 and a steam locomotive.
