Glasgow. No Official number is recorded for the vessel, as formal registration was not introduced until the Merchant Shipping Act 1854.\nLaunched on Saturday, 3 May 1834, Queen of the Isle entered service with the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company in September of that year.\nQueen of the Isle served the Steam Packet for eleven years, until the Company sold her in 1845.\nConstruction and dimensions\nQueen of the Isle was the third vessel to enter service with the line, and the second to be constructed by Robert Napier & Co.\nQueen of the Isle was a carvel built wooden paddle steamer which had a registered tonnage of . Length 128'; beam 21'6\"; depth 12'7\". Schooner rigged with a standing bowsprit, her engine developed a nominal horse-power of 140 h.p.; and gave her a design speed of approximately 9 knots.\nThe Queen of the Isle was said to be the fastest vessel on the Irish Sea in her day.\nThe launch of the Queen of the Isle attracted considerable attention from the Scottish press. A report in the Glasgow Herald in 1834 stated:-\nHer commencement of service was greeted with excitement on the Isle of Man, the ''Mona's Herald stating:-\nService life\nQueen of the Isle arrived in Douglas on Wednesday, 10 September 1834.\nCaptain Gill assumed command, his command of the Mona's Isle being taken by Captain Edward Quayle and on 11 September she took a party of excursionists on a trip around the Island.\n]]\n1834 also saw the beginning of the daily summer service between Douglas and Liverpool leaving Douglas at 08:00hrs, and Liverpool at 10:00hrs. The winter service was increased to two sailings a week in each direction throughout the winter.\nOn 25 March 1835, under the command of Capt. Quayle, the Queen of the Isle collided with the steamer Irishman in the Mersey approaches and, although damaged, towed the Irishman into Liverpool.\nOn 27 May 1835, in a race between the two vessels, Queen of the Isle beat the packet ship Richmond.\nIn 1842 a Queen of the Isle inaugurated a weekly service between Douglas and Dublin.\nDisposal\nBefore her disposal, Queen of the Isles engine was taken out and installed in the Ben-my-Chree.\nQueen of the Isle was then sold and converted to a full rig sailing ship in 1845.\nShe is reputed to have sailed all over the world, until she was eventually reported lost off the Falkland Islands.\nReferences\n;Bibliography\n* Chappell, Connery (1980).
