He served as the 16th governor of Oklahoma from 1959 to 1963, and the appointed United States Senator from Oklahoma from 1963 to 1964, losing to Fred R. Harris in a 1964 Democratic primary election for the U.S. Senate. When  he took office as Governor of Oklahoma at the age of 33, Edmondson was, and still is, the youngest governor in the history of the state.\nPrior to serving as governor, Edmondson practiced law in Muskogee, Oklahoma, worked as the chief prosecutor for the Tulsa County attorney, and was elected county attorney himself in 1954 and 1956.\nEarly life and career\nEdmondson was born in Muskogee, Oklahoma, attended elementary and secondary schools there and enrolled in the University of Oklahoma after high school graduation. He enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Forces in March 1942, and served until December 5, 1945. He returned to the University of Oklahoma, was married to his childhood sweetheart, Jeanette Bartleson, in May 1946, and completed his law degree in August 1948. He had a son, James Jr., and two daughters, Jeanne and Patricia.\nAfter practicing law in Muskogee, Edmondson moved to Tulsa to become the chief prosecutor in the office of the county attorney of Tulsa County. He was elected county attorney in 1954 and was re-elected in 1956.\nAs governor, Edmondson helped to establish a state merit system and central purchasing, but failed in his attempt to transfer control of county road funds to the Oklahoma Department of Highways. He resigned in the final weeks of his gubernatorial term and was appointed to  the United States Senate, where he was defeated by Fred Harris in his campaign for election to the seat. He later practiced law after leaving elective office and died of a heart attack and is buried in Oklahoma City.\nGovernor of Oklahoma\nEdmondson was inaugurated as Governor of Oklahoma on January 12, 1959, after winning the election by the largest majority ever given to a gubernatorial candidate in the state. He ran on a platform of reform, and passed many reforms despite opposition from the legislature during his first two years as governor. He was also committed to a special election to repeal prohibition of the sale of alcohol, and successfully pushed a referendum through the legislature. He was successful in establishing a state merit system and central purchasing, but failed in his attempt to transfer control of county road funds to the Department of Highways.\nUS Senate\nEdmondson resigned from office as governor two weeks before the end of his term, on January 6, 1963, and was appointed to the US Senate to fill the position left vacant by the death of Robert S. Kerr. He voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He served in the Senate until November 1964. He was ousted in that year's special election to finish the last two years of the Senate term by being defeated in the Democratic primary by Fred R. Harris.\nDeath\nWhile a practicing attorney in Oklahoma City, Edmondson died November 17, 1971, of a heart attack in his home.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=ED005 Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture - Edmondson, J.
