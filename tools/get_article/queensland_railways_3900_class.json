These were ordered to operate coal trains on the Blackwater and Goonyella railway lines that were in the process of being electrified. The contract was later extended to 80.\nThe bodies being built and assembled at Walkers's Maryborough factory with Clyde Engineering responsible for some of the electrical equipment and commissioning the locomotives.\nFollowing the decision to electrify the North Coast line from Brisbane to Rockhampton, the last 30 were built to a modified design for passenger and general freight use, and delivered as the 3900 class. They received modified bodies to allow them to pass through Brisbane's tunnels and received higher gearing to allow them to operate at .\n3550 class\nWith an increased need for locomotives on the Central Queensland coal lines, 19 were converted to 3550 class locomotives.\nReferences"
