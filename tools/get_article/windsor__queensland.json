In the , Windsor had a population of 7,811 people.\nGeography\nWindsor is located about  from the Brisbane central business district. It is largely residential, featuring many old Queenslanders, although there is also considerable retail commercial activity, primarily concentrated along Lutwyche and Newmarket Roads.\nHistory\n, 2015]]\nLand was first sold in this remote part of then New South Wales in 1854 and development was slow until the opening of the Bowen Bridge in 1860, named after the newly arrived first Governor of Queensland, Sir George Bowen, allowing easier access to the district. At that time the district was known as Breakfast Creek or Upper Breakfast Creek. Distinctive homes including Rosemount, Oakwal, The Bower, Wilston House and Eildon were built on large portions of land.\nIn 1864, pioneer settlers approached the Queensland Government for aid to establish a local school. The Bowen Bridge Road National School consisted of a simple wooden building and headmaster's house erected on a stone foundation and opened on 17 July 1865 on Bowen Bridge Road, adjacent to Thondley's Farm. Sixteen students enrolled for the first day and by the end of the first year, 112 students were on the register. In 1915, the school transferred across the road and was renamed Windsor State School. After World War I, the original school and headmaster's house was demolished and the land developed as the Windsor Memorial Park upon which a war memorial was constructed.\nSwan Hill, O'Connell Town, Eildon, Albion, and Lutwyche were locality names before the appearance of the Windsor name when the shire council was formed.\nThe Shire of Windsor was formed in 1887. It was named after Windsor Castle in England as it was Queen Victoria's golden jubilee year. In July 1895, the Council decided to erect permanent chambers and consulted Brisbane-born architect Thomas Coutts, to design a council chambers. The first meeting of the Windsor Shire Council in the new premises was conducted on 9 March 1897. The building, constructed out of Brisbane tuff from the adjacent quarry, now home of the Windsor and Districts' Historical Society, is open every Sunday and Monday from 1–4&nbsp;pm.\nThe Methodist Church opened on 13 August 1887 in a house on Nicholls Street in Swan Hill (now in Windsor) which was converted into a Sunday School and chapel. On 18 August 1889, a new church was opened on Swan Terrace. During the 1893 Brisbane flood, Swan Hill was badly flooded and many people took refuge in the church. After the flood, it was decided to relocate the church to higher ground to the present day location in Newmarket Road with the church re-opening there on 23 November 1902. When the Methodist Church amalgamated with the Presbyterian and Congregation Churches to form the Uniting Church in Australia in 1977, the church became known as Windsor Uniting Church.\nIn 1904, Windsor Shire Council became the Windsor Town Council. It contained the suburbs of Lutwyche, Wilston, Albion, Swan Hill, Eildon, O'Connell Town, The Grange (now simply Grange) and Wooloowin and portions of Kedron, Newmarket, and Eagle Junction.\nIn 1925, Windsor Town was amalgamated with 19 other shires and towns to form Greater Brisbane and former Windsor Town mayor, William Jolly became Mayor, and in the second term—Lord Mayor of Greater Brisbane.\nOn 18 August 1925, Archbishop Duhig purchased a property called Grafton Lodge on Bowen Bridge Road (now Roblane Street) for £1,750. Initially services were held in one of the houses on the property. On 1 August 1926, Monsignor James Byrne laid the foundation stone for a building to contain a church and a school. On 10 October 1926, Duhig blessed and opened the building, naming it Holy Rosary (and not St Anthony's as had been previously announced). The building was two storeys with the church above being  with the school below being . The architect was James Cavanagh and the builder Denis Cleary.\nWilson Ophthalmic Hostel School opened on 28 January 1929. Operated by the Queensland Government at Tenth Street (near Fifth Avenue, approx ). It was a boarding facility where children from outside of Brisbane could be housed and schooled while being treated for ophthalmia at the Royal Children's Hospital at Herston. In 1953, it was renamed Wilson Hospital School and its role expanded to children requiring treatment for a range of other conditions. It closed in 1958, as the children could then be accommodated at the hospital itself.\nHoly Rosary Catholic School opened on 28 January 1929 and was operated by the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart. 120 students attended on the opening day.\nThe Windsor Presbyterian Church opened and dedicated on 14 April 1934 by Reverend John Sinclair, Moderator of the Brisbane Presbytery. The church was in King Street (but this was renamed Maygar Street in 1938). On 19 April 1959, a foundation stone for a new extension was laid commemorating 25 years of service.\nWindsor Infants State School opened on 1 November 1934. It closed in 1971.\nSt Peter's Anglican Mission Hall on the corner of Lutwyche Road and Fuller Street (approx ) was dedicated on 15 December 1935 by Coadjutor Bishop Horace Henry Dixon. It was needed to cope with the growth of the congregation at St Andrew's Anglican Church at Lutwyche.  The building was a house converted to provide a chapel and a Sunday School with the intention to erect a purpose-built church at a later stage. On 12 April 1953, Archbishop Reginald Halse opened a new Sunday School building. St Peter's Anglican Mission Hall closed on 15 March 1987 with the approval of Assistant Bishop George Browning.\nOn Sunday 13 September 1953, Archbishop James Duhig laid the foundation stone for a new Holy Rosary Catholic Church costing £40,000. When the new church was completed, the school would expand into the old church. On 22 August 1954, Archbishop Duhig consecrated the new brick church in the presence of a crowd of 2000 people, many of whom listened from outside the church via loudspeaker.\nWilson Youth Hospital was established in June 1961 at Tenth Street following a refurbishment of the Wilson Hospital School () to create a more secure facility with a focus on detention. In 1983, it was renamed The Sir Leslie Wilson Youth Centre. In 1993, it was renamed the Sir Leslie Wilson Youth Detention Centre. It was operated by the Queensland Government and housed children who were breaking the law, \"troubled\" children as well as orphans, although the role of the centre changed over time. It was closed on 29 April 2001 and demolished soon after. There was an associated Wilson Youth Hospital School which operated from 1961 to 1968.\nOn 3 February 1964, \"opportunity classes\" (special education) were introduced at Windsor State School. On 23 January 1967, the special education program was established as a separate school, Windsor Special School, but still operating on the same site. The special school closed on 16 December 1994.\nThe 1974 floods affected the suburb. Various streets close to Breakfast Creek were affected.\nAt the start of 2013, Holy Rosary Catholic School was renamed St Mary of the Cross to commemorate St Mary MacKillop, Australian's first saint and the founder of the Sisters of St Joseph who had operated the school until 1977 after which it passed into lay leadership.\nDemographics\nIn the , Windsor had a population of 6,389 people, with 49.1% female and 50.9% male.

These services combined to provide the suburb with an off-peak service of a tram every 2½ minutes along Lutwyche Road in the late 1950s.\nTwo former tramway electrical substations remain features of Lutwyche Road, near Albion Road. One of these now houses the heritage collection of the Queensland Electrical Engineers Association.\nWindsor contains a corridor gazetted by the Queensland government since 1972 for the construction of the Northern Freeway between Bowen Hills and Carseldine. Although the freeway was not built, the official plan still exists and a freeway through Windsor may be constructed in the future. Part of the original Northern Freeway is now the Clem Jones Tunnel (Clem7). It emerges close to Campbell Street, Bowen Hills. Several businesses along Lutwyche Road in Windsor were resumed as part of this process and as part of the Airport Link Tunnel and Northern Busway projects. Several of these businesses have protested the City Council's moves.\nEducation\nWindsor State School is a government primary (Prep–6) school for boys and girls at Harris Street ().
