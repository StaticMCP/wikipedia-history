It is a popular holiday destination. In the , the suburb of Noosa Heads had a population of 5,120 people.\nGeography\nThe suburb is bounded to the west by Weyba Creek and the Noosa River and to the north and east by the Coral Sea. The northeast of the locality is within the Noosa National Park. Noosa Heads, Noosaville and Tewantin form a continuous urban area at the northern end of the Sunshine Coast.\nNoosa Hill in the national park is the highest point of the suburb () at  above sea level. There is also Laguna Lookout () on a low hill near the town.\nCoastal features\nThere are a number of headlands, lookouts, bays, and other coastal features along the Noosa Heads coastline, many of them on the coastal walking track through the national park, including (from north to south):\n* Noosa Inlet, the mouth of the Noosa River ()\n* Laguna Bay ()\n* Noosa Beach ()\n* Boiling Pot Lookout ()\n* Tea Tree Bay ()\n* Dolphin Point, a headland ()\n* Dolphin Point Lookout ()\n* Granite Bay ()\n* Fairy Pools, a rockhole ()\n* Noosa Head (also known as Low Bluff), a headland ()\n* Hell's Gates Lookout ()\n* Hells Gates ()\n* Alexandria Bay ()\n* Alexandria Beach ()\n* Roaring Cave (also known as the Blowhole) ()\n* Harrys Lookout ()\n* Devils Kitchen ()\n* Paradise Caves ()\nHistory\nGubbi Gubbi (Kabi Kabi, Cabbee, Carbi, Gabi Gabi) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Gubbi Gubbi country. The Gubbi Gubbi language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Sunshine Coast Region and Gympie Region, particularly the towns of Caloundra, Noosa Heads, Gympie and extending north towards Maryborough and south to Caboolture.\nIt is widely stated that name Noosa is a corruption of the Kabi word nuthuru, meaning a ghost or a shadow. However, that is unlikely because a 1870 map of Noosa shows the Noosa River written as Nusa River, and a notice to mariners published in 3 September 1873 refers to Nusa Head and the Nusa River in Laguna Bay.  Nusa is the Indonesian word for island, and the Noosa River contains  Makepeace Island, Sheep Island and Goat Island. \"Nusa Bay, or as it is better known, Lagoona Bay\" is mentioned in a 1866 newspaper article and the locality of Nusa is also mentioned in a 1869 article.\nThe beach at Noosa Heads has remained a popular tourist attraction since the 1890s. The Shire's tourism exponentially grew shortly after the Second World War.\nIn the 19th century, Noosa's early wealth came from the timber and milling industries, with tourism developing in the late 1920s.
