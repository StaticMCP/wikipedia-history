Its core area comprised Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire (the old county of Dyfed) in south-west Wales.\nThe Trust provides archaeological and related advice to central government, local planning authorities and other public and private organisations. It maintains the regional Historic Environment Record. The Welsh Archaeological Trusts were pioneers in developing Historic Environment Records (HERs) in the 1970s: Wales was the first part of the UK to develop a fully national system of what were then called ‘Sites and Monuments Records’; this fully computerised system was pioneered by the Dyfed Archaeological Trust Chief Executive, Don Benson.\nData included in the Historic Environment Record are publicly available on a dedicated website, Archwilio. The Trust also undertakes a wide range of field- and office-based projects, is a limited company and a registered charity.\nNotable people\n* W. F. Grimes, Chair of the Trust 1975-1988\n* Ken Murphy, Director of the Trust since 2007\n* Christopher R. Musson, Chair of the Trust 1989-1991 and 2005-2010\nMerger\nIn September 2023 the four Welsh Archaeological Trusts, including Dyfed Archaeological Trust, merged and were re-named Heneb: the Trust for Welsh Archaeology.\nSee also\n*Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust\n*Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust\n*Gwynedd Archaeological Trust\n*Cadw\n*Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales\n*Welsh Archaeological Trusts\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.dyfedarchaeology.org.uk/ Dyfed Archaeological Trust Website]\n*[http://www.archwilio.org.uk/ Archwilio website]"
