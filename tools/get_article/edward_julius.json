His mother was Sarah Jane Julius who had emigrated from Dromore, County Tyrone around 1875.\nHis early education was at Calder House in Redfern when Dr Joseph David Sly (1844–1934) was the proprietor and headmaster. After that notable independent school closed down in Sydney Julius was enrolled aged 12 at Newington College on 28 January 1880.

In July 1921 he was appointed Forester in charge of the North-Western District of Tasmania, based in Burnie.\nIn October 1923 he won an appointment as Conservator of Forests in South Australia, succeeding Walter Gill. The appointment was controversial, having been made by the Government against the recommendation of the Public Service Board, and also criticised by H. H. Corbin for having no knowledge of silviculture, or of South Australian conditions, when there were many Adelaide graduates of the university's School of Forestry better qualified.\nHe retired in 1935 and joined the staff of Sapfor. His replacement was C. J. Rodgers BSc, a graduate of the University of Adelaide.\nJulius, with J. S. Barnes and Charles H. Homes, general manager of Sapfor, developed and patented a technique for speedier kiln-drying of Pinus insignis (or radiata) timber. The patent rights were assigned to Homes.\nFamily\nJulius married Mary Louisa \"Minnie\" Clarke (died 24 June 1951) on 23 May 1900.
