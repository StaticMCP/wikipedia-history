The tramway was not built and with the locomotives considered unsuitable for railway use, they were stored. Per Queensland Railway's classification system they were designated the 6D11½ class, 6D representing they were a tank locomotive with six wheels, and the 11½ the cylinder diameter in inches.\nIn 1884 one was assembled at North Ipswich Railway Workshops and operated a trial from Ipswich to Brisbane. This confirmed its unsuitability for main line use, and it was instead employed as a shunter in Ipswich and South Brisbane. The other two were assembled and dispatched to Maryborough in 1888. They returned south in 1893 hauling trains on the Redbank-Bundamba Loop Line. All were withdrawn in 1902.\nReferences"
