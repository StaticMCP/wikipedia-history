It lies approximately  east of Wieliczki,  south-east of Olecko, and  east of the regional capital Olsztyn. It is located in the historic region of Masuria.\nHistory\nHistorically, the village was known in Polish as both Cimochy and Czymochy.  As of 1600, the population of the village was exclusively Polish.\nDuring World War II, the Polish resistance carried out acts of sabotage against Nazi Germany. In 1944, the Polish Home Army twice damaged a sawmill that produced timber for the German Army, and mined railroad tracks, causing a freight train to derail.\nNotable residents\n* Arno von Lenski (1893–1986), German general\nReferences"
