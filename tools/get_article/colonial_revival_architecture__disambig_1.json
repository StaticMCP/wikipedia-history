Fairly small numbers of Colonial Revival homes were built &ndash;1910, a period when Queen Anne-style architecture was dominant in the United States. From 1910&ndash;1930, the Colonial Revival movement was ascendant, with about 40% of U.S. homes built in the Colonial Revival style. In the immediate post-war period (&ndash;early 1960s), Colonial Revival homes continued to be constructed, but in simplified form. In the present day, many New Traditional homes draw from Colonial Revival styles.\nAlthough associated with the architectural movement, \"Colonial Revival\" also refers to historic preservation, landscape architecture and garden design, and decorative arts movements that emulate or draw inspiration from colonial forms.\nCharacteristics\nWhile the dominant influences in Colonial Revival style are Georgian and Federal architecture, Colonial Revival homes also draw, to a lesser extent, from the Dutch Colonial style and post-medieval English styles. Colonial Revival homes are often eclectic in style, combining aspects from several of these previous styles.\nSince Colonial Revival architecture pulls structural and decorative elements from other styles, there is not one single combination of elements that defines the style. However, some commonly found characteristics of Colonial Revival buildings include:\n* Gabled, hipped, or gambrel roofs\n* Broken pediments\n* Symmetrical facades\n* Double hung windows and shutters\n* Fanlights and sidelights\nCyril M. Harris's American Architecture: An Illustrated Book noted that \"Colonial Revival houses are usually the result of a rather free interpretation of their prototypes; they tend to be larger, may differ significantly from the houses they seek to emulate, and often exaggerate architectural details.\"\nGallery\nFile:Robinson Hall at LA Tech IMG 3763.JPG|Historic Robinson Hall on the Louisiana Tech University campus in Ruston, Louisiana, is named for the second president of the institution, William Claiborne Robinson.\nFile:Hyattsville PO Nov 08.JPG|Hyattsville Post Office in Hyattsville, Maryland, built in 1935\nFile:Henry M.
