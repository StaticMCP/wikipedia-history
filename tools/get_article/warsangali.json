In the Somali language, the name Warsangali means \"bringer of good news.\" The Warsangali primarily inhabit the Sanaag.\nOverview\nshowing distribution of the Warsangali tribe in the north eastern Somalia ]]\n]]\nIn 1848, C. J. Cruttenden reported that the Warsangali and Majeerteen territories were the most commercially valuable in the Nugaal Valley and that Banians from India had become successful exporters. The Cal Madow chain of mountains, which is partially inside the clan's territory, extends to the cities of Bosaso (the capital of the Bari region) and Ceerigaabo (the capital of the Sanaag region) both in an east and west direction.\nAn article titled \"Seychellois Rekindle Ties with Sultan of Somaliland,\" which was featured in one of the newspapers of the Republic of Seychelles, writes, \"the Warsengeli Sultanate has been in existence for the last hundred six hundred years.\"\nIndian Ocean diplomacy\nThe Warsangali Sultanate placed a value on maintaining diplomatic ties with rulers in Europe and South Arabia, as evidenced by archival files in Arabic text containing such correspondence. John Hanning Speke wrote that when he visited the Warsangeli country in 1855, “the United Kingdom would hold the Sultan Mohamed (21st Sultan) accountable” if his safety were compromised. Lidwien and Spaulding (2002) described two documents that signify how the Sultanate administered its affairs and guarded its independence. Lidwien and Spaulding mention a laissez-passer document issued by Sultan Mohamed to a French physician, Gerges Revoil, on 12 December 1889. The laissez-passer  instructs the French to observe the protocol of entering the country. Any foreign visitor or dignitary would enter the Warsangeli country via its sea port of Las Qoray. However, given the traveler's unfamiliarity with the established rules and customs of the land, the sultan allowed the French to enter by land through Bandar Mura’aya.\nThe Conquest of Abyssinia\nIn the Adal chronicler Futuh al-Habasha, Sihab ad-Din, who was an eyewitness in many of the battles to conquer Abyssinia, compares the 300 Harti army to an Arab knight whose name was Hamzah al-Jufi:“On the left was the Somali tribe of [Warsangeli] Harti, from the people of Mait (Sanaag); a people not given to yielding. There were three hundred (300) of them, famous among the infantry as stolid as swordsmen.....One of the Arabs called Hamzah al-Jufi engaged in a battle to the death in front of the Imam of the Muslims. He was one of the footsoldiers and stood his ground and stood the test, confronting war with a full heart. He never struck one infidel whom he did not unhorse, dead. He killed so vast a number of them in the middle of the river, that the river water was turned red by the blood. The whole tribe of Harti was like him\" (Sihab ad Din, p. 78).\nHistory\nToday, the influence of Sultans and other traditional leaders has waned with the advent of independence and the establishment of a central government in Somalia that exercises national sovereignty. However, the longest surviving Muslim sultanate ever established in the Somali peninsula is the Warsangali Sultanate. It has been in existence for the last six hundred years.\nThe Warsangali Sultanate has a history of civilization, characterized by a defined population and territory, along with an organized political structure. The Warsangeli inhabit a territory extending to the west of Erigavo from Bosaso (Bari region), straddling from the shore of Laaso Suurad, (“Ras Surad”), and bordered in the North by the Gulf of Aden to the plateaus of Sool Haud (a land mass the size of Sool and Awdal regions combined).\nThe Sultanate produced seafarers who made their mark in the field of social science. Ibrahim Isma’il's book, An Early Autobiography of a Somali (1919), a Warsangeli seafarer himself, describes a judgment issued by the Sultan and in compliance with a decision by the royal court. The sultan ordered a boat-making project as a redress to an incident at the port. To maintain the region's trade ties with the Arabian peninsula, the Sultan ruled that preserving its integrity as a place where traders have guarantees for the value and protection of their merchandise was important. Murrayat's travels (1848) in the interior of the Warsangeli Country shows a similar observation. Murrayat observed a widespread practice of good moral precepts in safeguarding the rights of private property and in deference to the law of the land. During his stay, not an article of his belongings was stolen. He states, “In this land, to call a man a thief is a deadly insult only to be washed by blood alone.”\nUntil 1920, the sultanate had maintained its independence after its sultan, Mohamoud Ali Shire, was exiled into the islands of Seychelles. The sultan was fiercely independent and detested foreign presence in his country.  A newspaper as cited by Seychelles Nation, states,  “His independent policy, strength and indifference to the powers surrounding him, including the British has vexed London and led to his arrest and deportation to Seychelles.\nThe Sultan was described as a sovereign ruler of immense influence and a man of mercurial image by the historian I.M. Lewis. He was the 24th sultan in  a long line of Gerads (a Somali royal court). In 1920, the sultan was exiled along with the two African Kings, King Prempeh of Ashanti (Ghana) and king Kabarego of Bunyoro (Uganda), and a former Prime Minister of Egypt, Sa'ad Zaghlul Pasha, as well as other luminaries of leaders in the wars of African resistance to the British colonialism were also there as exiles. He was the descendent of a six-hundred-year-old tradition (please see ‘What led to the discovery of the Nile’ by John Hanning Speke). In the 1940 and 50s, the Warsangeli leadership formed the United Somali Party (USP) following a three-month convention chaired by the Sultan himself following his return from exile. The USP was instrumental in Somalia's long and painful road to freedom and independence from colonial powers.\nLineage\nThe structures of the clans and sub clans are not clearly agreed upon. The divisions and subdivisions as they are presented here are condensed and incomplete. Numerous lineages are absent.
