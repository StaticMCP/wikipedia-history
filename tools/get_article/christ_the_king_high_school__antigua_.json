It is the only all-girls Catholic high school located on the island of Antigua; however, in the past it was once a co-ed school. Its brother school is St. Joseph's Academy. If the child is not of age to go to the School there is a school for children named St.John's Catholic and a pre-school named Early Childhood Pre-school.\nNotable alumni\n* Ashley Boodhoo, Miss Antigua and Barbuda 2018\n* George-Ann Ryan, Chief Financial Officer of The Sadie Collective and Chief Operating Officer at Ryan Group of Companies\nSee also\n*List of schools in Antigua and Barbuda"
