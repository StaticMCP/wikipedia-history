The population comprises 90% Mestizo, 7% Indigenous, 2% African descent, and 1% White. This influences all facets of the culture: customs, practices, ways of dressing, religion, rituals, codes of behavior and belief systems.  in Honduras.]]\nPopular culture\nPopular culture in Honduras, as in most countries, is expressed not so much through sophisticated artistic creations, but rather by popular events that draw big crowds. In Honduras, such artistic and cultural events are held on specific days of the year and through special celebrations. Punta is a kind of dance and music the Hondurans proudly gather to do.\nHondurans celebrate national holidays and special events in the form of carnivals, fairs and parades throughout the year. For instance, in La Ceiba the annual carnival is a week-long celebration with music, exhibitions and special food, culminating in the most popular carnival in the country: \"The Carnival of Friendship\".\nThe Feria Juniana (June Fair) of San Pedro Sula includes musical concerts performed throughout the week, sporting events and exhibitions.\nPuerto Cortés celebrates its fair in August with a \"Venice\" theme which includes parades of gondolas and other boats in the bay, and an evening fireworks display launched from boats.\nBeing a predominantly Catholic country, Honduras gives special attention to the celebrations of Holy Week. In some regions of the country, such as Comayagua, Choluteca, Copán and Intibucá, processions are held, especially during Thursday and Good Friday. Through these events, Hondurans commemorate the sacrifice Jesus Christ made for humanity by reenacting the events during the week between Palm Sunday and Jesus Christ crucifixion.\nProbably the most outstanding event is the creation of the sawdust carpets. People will decorate the trail where Jesus will walk through (to his crucifixion) to make the walk less painful for Christ. Some people - particularly the inhabitants of the North and South Coast - use this week as an opportunity to visit beaches, rivers and swimming pools, to escape the stifling heat.\nHondurans celebrate Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve on 24 and 31 December respectively. During these celebrations, the majority of Honduran homes cook special dishes to mark the occasion. Favorites include tamales wrapped with banana leaves, roast pigs' legs, and pastries. All of these celebrations are complemented at the end of the night with fireworks and firecrackers.\nOther celebrations of special interest to Hondurans include Mothers' Day, Children's Day, Labor Day, Teachers' Day and Friendship Day.\nEthnic cultures\nThe predominant ethnic group in Honduras are the mestizo - people of mixed native and European (mostly Spanish) descent. Mestizos account for over 84% of the population of Honduras. There are several other minority ethnic groups.  Amongst them are people who descend from native tribes that lived in the area before the Spanish arrived: Lencas, Chortís, Tolupanes, Pechs (also called Payas), Tawahkas, and Miskitos.\nThere is also a group called the Garífunas who descend from African slaves from the Caribbean islands.\nAccording to the 2001 census the Amerindian population in Honduras included 381,495 people (6.3% of the total population). With the exception of the Lenca and the Ch'orti' they still keep their language.\nSix different Amerindian groups were counted at the 2001 census:\n* the Lenca (279,507 in 2001;4.6% of the total population) living in the La Paz, Intibucá, and Lempira departments;\n* the Miskito (51,607 in 2001; 0.8%) living on the northeast coast along the border with Nicaragua.\n* the Ch'orti' (34,453 in 2001;0.6% of the total population), a Mayan group living in the northwest on the border with Guatemala;\n* the Tolupan (also called Jicaque, \"Xicaque\", or Tol; 9,617 in 2001; 0.2% of the total population), living in the department of Yoro and in the reserve of the Montaña de la Flor and parts of the department of Yoro;\n* the Pech or Paya Indians (3,848 in 2001; 0.1% of the total population) living in a small area in the Olancho department;\n* the Sumo or Tawahka (2,463 in 2001;\nFile:David Suazo Catania.jpg|David Suazo.\nFile:Izaguirre Nov2010.jpg|Emilio Izaguirre\nFile:Roger Espinoza 2018.jpg|Roger Espinoza\nFile:Wilson Palacios Spurs 2009.jpg|Wilson Palacios\nMusicians\nMusic in Honduras has flourished since pre-Hispanic periods, long before the colony, some of the autochthonous pre-Hispanic instruments are the following: Aerophones, Yaxchilan Mud Frog, Zampoñas, Quenas, Charangos, Drums. After colonization, new musical instruments were created: the snail, flutes, some percussion instruments and the Marimba. Within Creole or folk music we have the following: El Candú, El Pitero, Torito Pinto, Flores de Mimé, El Bananero.\nSome notable Honduran musicians include Rafael Coello Ramos, Lidia Handal, Victoriano López, Jorge Santos, Norma Erazo, Sergio Suazo, Hector David, Angel Ríos, Jorge Mejia, Javier Reyes, Guillermo Anderson, Victor Donaire, Francisco Carranza, Camilo Rivera Guevara, Héctor David, Javier Monthiel and Moisés Canelo.\nEscuela de Música Victoriano López in San Pedro Sula city.\nAt the international level the musical group Banda Blanca stood out, with their hits \"Sopa De Caracol\", \"Do you Know Who Came?\" and \"Fiesta\". Although the group produces merengueros rhythms, the Calypso and other Caribbean rhythms, their specialty is the Punta style, which they popularized during the 1990s.\nOther musical groups include The Professionals, The Gran Banda, The Rolands, Angeles negros, Cafe Guancasco, and Atomic Rose.\nWriters\nThe literature in the territory of present-day Honduras dates back more than 1,500 years ago, it was developed by the Mayan civilization in the city of Copán, the Mayan Script of our ancestors that used logograms and syllabic glyphs Mayan literature is preserved in the stelae, pyramids and temples at Copán. The city of Copán is home to the most informative pyramid in America, the Pyramid of Hieroglyphs that has more than 2,500 glyphs.\nAmong the most notable writers from Honduras are David Fortin, Froylán Turcios Juan Ramón Molina, Rafael Heliodoro Valle, Antonio José Rivas, Clementina Suárez, Ramón Amaya Amador, Marco Antonio Rosa, Roberto Sosa, Lucila Gamero de Medina, Roberto Quezada, Armando García, Helen Umaña, Alberto Destephen, Argentina Díaz Lozano, Rony Bonilla and Julio Escoto.

He used it to begin publication in 1830 of The Gazette of the government. Bulletins and informative weekly papers soon followed.\nIn 1831, the newspaper known as The Beam was born, which had a short duration. At the end of the 19th century, The Chronicle commenced publication; next came The Newspaper of Honduras and The People (an official newspaper of the Honduran Liberal Party, which later ceased publication).\nHonduras has a good number of newspapers and magazines, through which the Honduran people stay well informed. Of these the oldest is La Prensa, founded on October 26, 1964 in San Pedro Sula. El Tiempo was in publication from 1970 to 2015. In the capital city of Tegucigalpa, The Tribune and later The Herald appeared in the mid 1970s.With the Internet came Proceso Digital and the English weekly paper Honduras This Week. Recently sports magazines such as AS and Diez have appeared, with an emphasis on association football.\nTelevision was introduced in Honduras in 1959 with the arrival of channel 5. Today there are various channels produced in Honduras.\nWith the arrival of the cable system, Hondurans have the opportunity to watch programs from round the world. The cultural impact of these programs remains to be seen.\nRadio also has contributed to the cultural development of Honduras. Major players include Radio America and HRN, a member of the National System of Broadcasting Stations.\nTheatre\nTheatrical performances in Honduras date from the colonial period, they began in the 16th century, the first theatrical performance in Honduras was held in the year 1750, outdoors, in the city of Comayagua, the play represented was the Devil Cojuelo. In 1915 the Manuel Bonilla National Theater was founded.

His first cinematographic work was the experimental film Mi Amigo Ángel, produced in 1962 and is the first film in the cinematography of Honduras.\nOther national productions are \"No Land Without Owner\" (1984-1996), a fictional feature film by Sami Kafati. Currently, the playwrights Hispano Durón Gómez, Mario Jaén, among others, stand out.\nSome of the films produced in Honduras more recently are the following:\n* \"Anita, the insect hunter\", produced by Hispano Durón,\n* \"Amor y frijoles\" by Guacamaya Films in 2009,\n* \"Midnight Souls\", (2001) by Juan Carlos Fanconi,\n* \"The Strange Body\", by José A.

The Icaro Festival is the most important international film festival in Central America and the Caribbean.\nCuisine\nHonduras has a variety of traditional dishes: The baleada is one of the most representative dishes of Honduran Gastronomy. It is basically composed; for a flour tortilla, which is folded and filled with fried beans, dry cheese and cream butter. Others add to it; roast meat or scrambled eggs to taste, sometimes avocado or chorizo is also added but with any of these ingredients it is very delicious. In addition to the baleadas, they are also popular: Roast beef with chimol, chicken in corn rice, fried fish with pickled onion, and the typical Garífuna dish that is fish fried in coconut oil.\nThere is another very popular food called macheteada, which is a sugary flour dough frying with three slits, hence its name macheteados. The slices with meat or chicken are also very popular in Honduras and chicken with slices is better known as chicken chuco by Hondurans and is sold in many corners as well as the baleadas and people make them homemade and sell them and usually they It goes very well.\nOther dishes are montucas, enchiladas, corn nacatamales, \"tripe\" or tripe soup and an abundant selection of tropical fruits such as: mango, papaya, pineapple, plum, sapotes and passion fruit (maracuyá). Grilled meat, pork and chicken chops are also frequently prepared with tortillas, red beans, rice and, of course, fried plantains.\nIn coastal areas and in the Bay Islands, seafood is prepared in various ways and some dishes are prepared with coconut. The tourist areas have restaurants with international cuisine and American-style dishes.\nReligion\nHonduras enjoys freedom of worship. Hondurans are predominantly Christians with half of the country being Catholic and has an increasing number of its population practicing different forms of  evangelicalism. Before the conquest of Honduras in the national territory, each ethnic group had its own religion and its own gods, they were polytheistic and animistic religions, among them the Mayan Religion stands out, as well as the Chorotega Religion, the Lenca Religion and the Pech Religion. cathedral in Amapala.]]During colonial times, Christianity and some African religions such as the Garífuna Dugú religion were introduced to Honduras, which is a mixture of African, Christian (Catholic) and indigenous beliefs. Honduras was the country where the second Catholic Mass was celebrated in continental America. This was held on August 14, 1502, in Punta Caxinas, two weeks after the discovery of Honduras by Christopher Columbus. Since then, the Spanish were in charge of instilling the Christian faith among the natives of Honduras.\nAfter the independence of Honduras in 1821 and in the first constitution of the country promulgated on December 11, 1825, Honduras is declared a secular state, this supposes the null interference of any organization or religious confession in the government of the same, either in the executive, the legislative or the judicial.\nIn recent years, both the Catholic Church and Protestant churches have experienced significant growth in terms of the number of committed parishioners and communicate with the new mass media, have television channels, radio stations, newspapers, schools, colleges, universities and Internet pages.\n, one of the places of the Honduran Jewish community. ]]\nIn addition to these religions, there are smaller-scale groups in Honduras that profess other religions, such as: Islam, Judaism, and members of the Rastafari movement among others.\nToday a low percentage of the population is considered atheist, another low percentage of Hondurans consider themselves agnostic, 50% of the believers are Catholic and an important part of the autochthonous ethnic groups conserve their original religion.\nTribal and Indigenous Culture and Struggles within Honduras\nrepresentation at the Mayan Sculpture Museum in Copán. ]]\nThere are several different tribes located in the country of Honduras known as the Lenca, Miskitu, Tawahka, Pech, Maya Chortis, Xicaques, and many more. Each tribe has its own history, cultural traditions, and livelihood within Honduras. These indigenous people fight environmental justice-related issues daily throughout their lives. Many indigenous people face the risk of eventually being forced to change their culture and historical practices within their own land to adopt the new modern-day culture of Honduras. Hence, there is growing popularity in the belief that indigenous people stand in the way of the country’s national development.\nThe Lenca tribe, for example, is one of the largest in the country and has a population of around 100,000 and around 612 different Lenca communities. The majority of these communities are located in areas that are home to rough, mountainous terrain and are extremely difficult to reach. For those living in said conditions, essential daily tasks can be hard to complete in some locations as there is no roadway, running water, or even transportation. The Lenca tribe was unable to keep their language strong despite being somewhat isolated from the rest of the country. Income is made from selling coffee, weaving, and pottery; with their location, not a lot of money is made each day. The Lenca people have a true connection with the rivers, land, and nature. Non-indigenous people of Honduras pushed the Lenca people to live in the mountains, causing a lot of resistance between the two groups.\nAlong with the remote living conditions, hydroelectric facilities and mining are becoming popular in Lenca’s territory. The Lenca are ready to fight, even if it means losing their lives and some already have. Young Lenca people face challenges such as finding employment as there is little way of making a consistent income within most locations that the Lenca tribe inhabits. Instead, they must leave and likely will find themselves working in the military. The Lenca tribe is striving to find any possible solution to these problems and wants young Lenca people to be able to stay within their communities. There are major injustices occurring within the Lenca’s people and land. With these injustices, a complex multitude of issues arise. These problems all tie together and include isolation, unemployment, loss of aspects of their culture such as their own native language and land, and mining/other environmental hazards.\nHydroelectric, dams, and mining are all becoming very common in Honduras and tend to be located on tribal or indigenous lands. For instance, a damn was set to be constructed on the Gualcarque River. This river happened to be a very important and culturally significant river to the Lenca people and anyone surrounding that area. This dam’s main purpose would be to fuel hydroelectricity and mining for gold, silver, iron, and other valuable materials. A law was passed known generally as the “2013 mining law” that allowed open-pit mines and the use of harmful substances such as cyanide which is a threat to both the environment and human health. The law also required that the inhabitants of the land approve of the mining operations. However, the law often backfires and violent threats are used frequently as tactics to gain approval for the new construction of a mine or dam. Resistance often occurs with the Lenca tribe combined with other groups however it can become very dangerous even if the resistance is represented by means of a peaceful protest. The Honduran government has been present at these peaceful protests and often, violence such as shootings and other dangerous acts are at risk for breaking out.\nIn 2009, the Honduran government underwent a military coup d'état. During this event, mass corruption occurred and individuals from marginalized groups such as those from Lenca and Garifuna tribes were restored to the streets. It has been an uphill battle for all in this position since then. Honduras still remains in a coup-like atmosphere with electoral frauds, increased deaths, a large migration of its people, activists being arrested and killed, and so on. Honduras has one of the highest murder rates of activists and these people face a massive amount of danger each day. The organization known as the Civil Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (COPINH) plays a great role in activism towards these issues that the Lenca tribe and others face. Members of the COPINH group, such as Thomas Garcia, have been shot and killed during these protests against building dams and mining. The Miskitu tribe sums up around 5% of the indigenous population within the country of Honduras and is very large.\nSimilar to the Lenca tribe, these people are often marginalized and do not have proper access to healthcare, or educational opportunities. Miskitu people are extremely hard workers which can cause them many health problems. In addition, agriculture, being part of nature and the land is a major part of their traditions and ways of living. These people often face problems that arise from the Honduran government forcing them from their land, thus making them cut ties with the agricultural roots and values of their own land. Over a period of many years, tropical rainforests along the Caribbean coast, home to much of the Miskitu tribe as well as others, have been experiencing issues with groups such as miners, ranchers, and other illegal groups and people wrongfully utilizing the tribal land. As of 2009, the Honduras government has finally handed over a large chunk of land to the Miskitu people however, a major plan to construct a dam known as the Patuca 3 hydroelectric project was funded in the main cultural lands of the Miskitu and other tribes. As soon as this land was handed over, the government also began pestering these tribes about potential gas and oil uses within the land.\nThere are 41+ dam constructions which are all occurring in an area of tribal land. There have been several meetings between the tribes including the Tulupanes, Pech, Miskito, Maya-Chortis, Lenca, and Garifuna. The government of Honduras continues to jeopardize these tribal communities and utilize rivers that hold a huge link to the tribe's traditions, culture, and roots. With such resistance between indigenous peoples and the government, there is a popular belief that indigenous people are against any further development of their land. When, in reality, indigenous people are open to changes and modifications within their land if the choice is made by their own people. This strong willed-attitude and belief are held as if the changes to the land occur as a decision made within the tribe then they will not lose connection with the land and can continue on with their way of life. All members of the tribes are ready to fight for the rights and title of their land if the construction of dams becomes an official plan.\nDespite many tribes such as Garifuna having a long history with their land and their presence in Honduras, their and other tribes' lands are sometimes deemed to be practically non-existent. Not only is their land within Honduras also experiencing issues with the construction of dams and or mining locations but also with recent tourism that is steadily increasing. With tourism becoming popular, the Garifuna face an increased risk of losing their land, as do many other tribes of Honduras. Some are promised employment within this new wave of tourism however, their culture is also becoming more visible to others, making it not as sacred. In addition, because of this increase in tourism, new developers have begun stomping the lands of the Garifuna and constructing upon their land (large resorts for tourists, etc), taking their land, and ripping their culture away from them. There are massive conflicts over the land being utilized in this way.\nIn recent years, indigenous tribe members are still experiencing discrimination and a true lack of human rights toward their culture, land, and people. In 2016, 600+ activists gathered in the capital of Honduras known as Tegucigalpa. The event was known as the Summit for Indigenous and Peasant Communities in the Struggle Against Extractivism and was hosted by the Platform of Social and Popular Movement of Honduras. Struggles were shared by each tribe such as the problem of logging within the Tolupane tribes' land, extreme dam construction, and mining faced by the Lenca, members of the Garifuna tribe facing increased tourism and drilling within their lands, and so on. The groups combined in an effort to support one another and design resistance strategies together. Extraction methods are increasing rapidly and are often targeted to occur within indigenous people’s land instead of other prime locations. Activists are rising to promote these issues and improvements are being made but it will take a great deal of time to see them.\nSee also\n* Public holidays in Honduras\n* Virgin of Suyapa, perhaps Honduras' most popular religious image\n* Lluvia de Peces, rain of fish phenomenon\n* La Ceiba Carnival\n* Miss Honduras\n* Human rights in Honduras\n*\nReferences"
