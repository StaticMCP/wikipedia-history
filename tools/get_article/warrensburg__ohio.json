The development was the first of its kind in Scioto Township, attracting enough settlers to form a town known as Millville. The town expanded quickly but would be hampered when the railroad was built through the nearby town of Ostrander, Ohio.\nA post office opened in August 26, 1885, called Warrensburg, and closed a few years later due to the lack of mail.\nReferences"
