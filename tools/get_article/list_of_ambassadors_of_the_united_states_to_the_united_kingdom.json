The position is currently held by Warren Stephens, who presented his credentials to King Charles III on May 21, 2025.\nThe position is regarded as one of the most prestigious posts in the United States Foreign Service due to the \"special relationship\" between the United States and the United Kingdom. The ambassadorship has been held by various notable politicians, including five who would later become president: John Adams, James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, Martin Van Buren and James Buchanan. However, the modern tendency of American presidents (of both parties) is to appoint keen political fundraisers from previous presidential campaigns, despite the importance and prestige of the office.\nThe ambassador and executive staff work at the American Embassy in Nine Elms, London. The official residence of the ambassador is Winfield House in Regent's Park.\nDuties\nThe ambassador's main duty is to present U.S. policies to the government of the United Kingdom and its people, as well as report British policies and views to the federal government of the United States. The ambassador serves as a primary channel of communication between the two nations and plays an important role in treaty negotiations.\nThe ambassador is the head of the United States' consular service in the United Kingdom. As well as directing diplomatic activity in support of trade, the ambassador is ultimately responsible for visa services and for the provision of consular support to American citizens in the UK and oversees cultural relations between the two countries.\nList of U.S. chiefs of mission to the Court of St James's\nMinisters (1785–1812)\nIndependent\nDemocratic-Republican\nDemocrat\nWhig\nRepublican\nJohn Adams is referred to as the first \"ambassador\".  He is also referred to as the first \"minister plenipotentiary\".  Plenipotentiary means \"having full power\"; a minister that has power to act for their country in all matters.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The Congress of Vienna (1815) established a uniform system of diplomatic rank.  Under that system, the highest rank of \"ambassador\" was a personal representative of a sovereign, and the next rank of \"minister\", represented a government.  As a republic, the United States maintained diplomatic relations with Britain at the rank of Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary. The rank was colloquially known as Minister, and the position continued to be referred to as \"United States Minister to Great Britain\".\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

In 1893, the United States followed the French precedent and upgraded its relations with other Great Powers to the ambassadorial level.  The United States Legation in London became the United States Embassy, and the United States Minister to Great Britain became the United States Ambassador to Great Britain.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
