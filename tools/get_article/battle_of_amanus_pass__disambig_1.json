The Parthians, alarmed after their recent defeats by the forces of Publius Ventidius, began to concentrate their forces in northern Syria under the command of one of Parthia's best generals, Pharnapates.\nBattle\nPharnapates sent a strong Parthian detachment to protect the Syrian Gates, which protected a narrow pass over Mount Amanus. Ventidius sent forward one of his officers, Pompaedius Silo, with some cavalry, in order to capture this position. However, Pompaedius found himself compelled to engage with the forces of Pharnapates; the fighting was going in favour of the Parthians until Ventidius, who was concerned about his subordinate's situation,  brought his forces into the fight. This move turned the tide of the battle, which resulted in the Parthians being overpowered and defeated. Pharnapates himself was among the slain.\nAftermath\nWhen Pacorus I of Parthia heard news of this defeat he made the decision to retreat, and went about withdrawing his troops across the Euphrates. Ventidius did not hinder the Parthian withdrawal and instead proceeded to seize back Syria for the Roman Republic, which he succeeded in doing by early 38 BC.\nReferences\nSources\n* Dando-Collins, Stephen. \"Mark Antony's Heroes\".
