It was spearheaded by the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia and was considered the largest battle since the start of the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen in 2015.\nBeginning on 13 June 2018 and aiming to dislodge Houthi forces from the port, the objective of the assault was to recapture the city of Al Hudaydah and end the alleged supply of funds, weapons, and ballistic missiles to the Houthis through Al Hudaydah port. The Houthis countered by saying that they were defending Yemen from an American backed invasion.\nAs the port plays the crucial role of delivering over 80 percent of food and aid to Yemen, several humanitarian agencies warned of catastrophic humanitarian consequences. The United Nations warned that the battle could threaten the lives of 300,000 children in the populated area and prevent food delivery to millions or more. The UN has made various attempts and efforts to take over the control of Al Hudaydah port from Houthis and move it under its jurisdiction. The Houthis has said they are not against UN role and agreed to grant the UN \"a role of supervision\" on the condition the coalition withdraw from the offensive but said they won't withdraw from the city. Amid international pressure, the coalition promised the strategy of not entering any populated areas of Hudaydah, but work to isolate the Houthis by cutting their supply lines. Multiple reports indicate that the battle has exacerbated the humanitarian situation in Yemen.\nA UN-backed ceasefire agreement between the Hadi-led government and the Houthis was officially declared in December 2018 in Sweden with terms of troop withdrawal of both warring parties from Al Hudaydah. The deal was never fully implemented, with Hadi-led forces accusing the Houthis of repeated ceasefire violations, and Houthi forces refusing to withdraw in 2019.\nPro-government forces eventually withdrew from the city in 2021, ceding control of Al Hudaydah to the Houthis.\nBackground\nThe United Arab Emirates Armed Forces had previously proposed a naval attack on Al Hudaydah in 2016 to deprive the Houthis of getting resources from the port, however the United States advised against it as the operation was deemed to be too risky at that time. In the intervening two years, the UAE trained thousands of Yemeni soldiers, positioning them at bases in Eritrea and along Tihamah as part of the offensive on Al Hudaydah Governorate. According to the UAE, the dislodging of Houthis from Al Hudaydah will deprive the Houthis of their financial strength and force them to the negotiation table as well as stop the diverting of humanitarian aid to the Houthis and ensure it reached all Yemeni territories. The UAE gave the UN a deadline to negotiate with the Houthis to withdraw from the port city peacefully by midnight 12 June 2018 to avoid a military confrontation.\nGeographical location\nAl-Hudaydah, is a port city in Yemen located in Al Hudaydah governorate in the western coastline of Yemen. The city is located on the Tihāmah coastal plain which borders the Red Sea. Al-Hudaydah is the largest city by population in Al Hudaydah Governorate. Due to its location, Hudaydah port is one of the important and strategic ports in Yemen.\nHumanitarian situation\nThe Yemeni Civil war is an ongoing conflict that began in 2015, closely followed by a Saudi Arabian-led military intervention. The war and blockade by the coalition has led to what the United Nations describes as the \"world's worst humanitarian disaster\". The port city of Al Hudaydah has played a crucial role in delivering imported food into the country. This role has been disrupted several times over the course of the war.\nDuring the 2015 Yemeni Civil War, the Houthi-controlled city's port was bombed by the Saudi-led coalition on 18 August. The port's four cranes were destroyed and several warehouses were damaged. The coalition asserted that the port was housing a hostile naval base, but humanitarian aid organizations stated the coalition's naval blockade was preventing relief from reaching those in need.\nIn early November 2017, in response to a Houthi missile landing in Saudi Arabia, the Saudi authorities closed the port along with all other routes into Yemen. On 23 November 2017, the authorities allowed the port to reopen for aid deliveries, along with the Sana'a International Airport. According to World Health Organization, Hudaida governorate has one of the highest malnutrition rates in the country.\nUN attempt at political solution\nPrior to the beginning of the battle, three-quarters of humanitarian and commercial cargo entering Yemen arrived via the port of Al Hudaydah. Due to the risk of a humanitarian crisis if the port is besieged, the United Nations attempted to secure an agreement to manage the port under its jurisdiction and negotiated with the Houthis to take control of the port. The Houthis claiming that they have been cooperating with the international relief efforts to deliver aid to the Yemeni people. The coalition claims that Houthis use the port to raise war economy funds through taxation and smuggling weapons into Yemen, an allegation denied by the Houthis. A week before the start of the battle, the United Nations warned up to 250,000 of the city's 600,000 residents could be in danger. Martin Griffiths, UN peace envoy warned that the assault on Hudaydah would undermine the peace process. UNICEF Executive Director, Henrietta Fore, stated on 11 June that she was \"extremely concerned\" about reports of a military plan by Arab coalition to capture Hudaida. UN Secretary-General António Guterres, also said that he believed \"intense negotiations\" by UN representative can prevent start of a war.\nCriticism by Houthis\nIn a tweet on 15 June, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, the head of the Yemeni Supreme Revolutionary Committee criticized UN envoy Martin Griffith for failing to negotiate a peace deal, saying: \"the role played by the former UN envoy did not exceed the profession of postman, and his initiative was rejected by the US-Saudi aggression in agreement with the mercenaries who refuse to accept the choice of a consensual person for the presidency.\"\nMuhammad Abdel Salam, the Houthi spokesman also stated: \"Despite the UN envoy's visit to Sana'a more than once and meeting with Houthi officials for a comprehensive political solution, he has not done anything yet, which appears as a cover for the continuation of aggression.\"\nPrelude\nIn a statement, UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta H. Fore said the battle will harm 300,000 children who currently live in and around the city. \"There are 11 million children in need of humanitarian aid and the attack will lead to choke off this lifeline and have devastating consequences\", the statement said. The United Arab Emirates initially stated that it would not attack the port without the support of the United States and the United Kingdom. The United States Government initially expressed concerns about the risks of a battle, though Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense James Mattis subsequently offered qualified support.\nAccording to Emirati Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash, the Houthis were warned to evacuate the city within 48 hour and the deadline for Houthi forces to withdraw from Hudaydah expired on the morning of 13 June. The Houthis say that they took power through a popular revolt and are defending Yemen from invasion.\nCare International's acting country director, Jolien Veldwijk, warned from Sana'a of an even worse human catastrophe. \"People are already exhausted, starving, and have no means to cope with any further escalation of war.\" Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, the head of the Yemeni Supreme Revolutionary Committee, called on all international organizations to take a serious stance on the aggression and the unprecedented threat it poses to the vital port of Hudaydah, reiterating its continued full cooperation with the international relief efforts to deliver aid to all the Yemeni people.\nWestern support\nUnited States and other western powers have been criticized by human rights group for supporting Arab coalition airstrikes that have resulted in death of many civilians.\nFrance agreed to use minesweepers to clear explosive and sea mines which were placed by the Houthis around Al Hudaydah Port in anticipation of the attack, hence paving a way for the assault. France also sent special forces.\nHouthis have routinely accused Israel of being involved in the war against Yemen. On 2 June, Houthi spokesman, Muhammad Abd al-Salam said they have documented participation of Israeli planes in the war. He stated that the reason Israel does not acknowledge its role is that it does not want cause trouble for the Arab coalition.\nBattle timeline\nFirst phase\nJune: Initial advances\nThe coalition intended the battle to be short to avoid causing civilian casualties. The aim was to cut off Houthis supplies and force them to come to the negotiation table. Coalition forces have established a forward operating base at the nearby town of al-Khoka, south of Al Hudaydah.\n;13 June\nAccording to Yemeni officials, approximately 2,000 Emirati troops assaulted Al Hudaydah, departing from a UAE naval base in Eritrea. A worker for CARE reported hearing at least 30 airstrikes on the first day of fighting as the city population was caught in a panic. On the first day of the battle, Emirati and coalition forces reportedly moved to capture Hodeida International Airport, approaching within a few miles.\nOn the first day of fighting, 250 Houthi combatants were also reported killed.\nAlmasirah and Houthi spokesman Loai al-Shami claimed that Houthi forces hit a coalition ship with two missiles, though this remains unconfirmed. The Armed Forces of the UAE has reported that four Emirati soldiers died as of 13 June.\nIn an official statement the Houthi-allied Yemeni Marine and Coastal Defense Command expressed its high readiness to counter the offensive on the port, warning of more attacks on the invading naval forces. It also added that there is no concern for civilian ships to reach for Hudayda so long as they stayed committed to international maritime law. It also stressed the Yemeni naval forces' national and religious responsibility in defending Yemen's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n;14 June\nForces loyal to the internationally recognized Yemeni government claimed on 14 June that they could breach the first line of defence by Houthis defending the city. Medical sources reported that thirty Houthi militants were killed near Hodeida airport along with another nine pro-Hadi soldiers. According to Emirati Ambassador to the United Nations Obeid Salem Al Zaabi, coalition forces reached just 2&nbsp;km from the city airport.\nTwo Houthi commanders were reported to have been killed in the ensuing battle, and the coalition claims to have discovered \"hundreds\" of land mines planted by the Houthis to halt the advance of Pro-Hadi and coalition soldiers in Al Hudaydah.\n;15 June\nThe United Arab Emirates issued 10 ships and 3 flights carrying food and aid bound to Al Hudaydah.\nYemeni army officials claimed that dozens of its members have been killed mostly by Houthi landmines and roadside bombs planted around the city and disguised as rocks.\nHouthi official media, Almasirah, claimed death and injury of more than 40 coalition soldiers close to the seashore after being hit by a Houthi Tochka missile which was launched after intelligence gathering by a reconnaissance aircraft.\n;16 June\nThe coalition claimed it was close to capturing Hudayda airport from Houthi control amid clashes outside the airport. The coalition reportedly seized the airport on 16 June and engineers were placed to remove landmines placed around the airport.\nHouthis media denied that the airport was under coalition control and claimed that the coalition forces in the seashore were surrounded from three sides blocking reinforcements from reaching them by land.\nAlmasirah, a Houthi media outlet, claimed killing over 40 pro Hadi soldiers by Houthi snipers over the last two days in various fronts.\n;17 June\nAccording to The National, captured Houthi POW have indicated that Houthi forced intended to blow up Hodeida International Airport terminals if coalition forces continued their assault to capture it and has planted thousand landmines across the area. Commander of the coalition forces, Tareq Saleh, has indicated that many of captured Houthis were forced to fight in Al Hudaydah, many of whom were coerced into fighting with threats made against their family members if they refused.\n;19 June\nHouthis claimed to have fired a missile at the Saudi Aramco oil facilities in 'Asir in southwestern Saudi Arabia.\nMultiple news agencies reported that the coalition captured large areas of Al Hudaydah airport. However Almasirah, pro-Houthi news agency, wrote that numerous attempts by the coalition to take over the airport failed despite mobilization of all the coalition soldiers. Almasirah also reported destruction of all buildings inside the Al Hudaydah airport as a result of coalition's heavy aerial bombings and claimed several \"heroic\" victories by the pro-Houthi army, citing their advance preparations and intelligence work before the start of the war for their success and citing the destruction of 20 coalition armored vehicles and capture of another 10.\nAlmasirah also reported death of 6 Yemeni civilians including 4 women as a result of coalition on aerial bombings on Al Hudaydah. A claim that was denied by coalition Colonel Turki Al-Malki citing that there were no civilian casualties on the coalition advance on the airport. The coalition accused pro-Houthi militants of breaking international law and placing tanks inside residential areas of Al Hudaydah.\n;20 June\nAlmasirah reported a public statement by a pro-Houthi organization called Southern National Front to Resist the Invasion which protested against recruitment of young southern Yemenis by the UAE to fight against the Houthis, calling on the southern tribes to prevent their children from being sent to fight the Houthis.\nSaudi Arabia announced that Yemeni forces captured the airport from Houthi forces, which was again denied by Almasirah.\n;22 June\nReports regarding shortage of electricity and water for Al Hudaydah residents continue to rise, and relief workers attribute the water shortage due to damaged pipes caused by Houthi trench digging.\nAlmasirah released video of Houthi forces destroying coalition armored vehicles south of al-Hudaydah airport.\nOffensive pause and attempt for Geneva peace talks\nOn 23 June, the United Arab Emirates announced a pause to the military operations and the advance on Al Hudaydah to allow for UN-brokered talks spearheaded by UN envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths. A UN peace talk between Yemeni president Hadi and a Houthi delegation was organized to occur in Geneva on 6 September with aims of finding a peaceful resolution on the battle.\nContinued clashes on outskirts\nOn 4 August, a coalition airstrike was reported to have killed 30 people in a strike conducted near a hospital and Hudaydah fish market, the coalition denied the news source.\nOn 23 August, the coalition stated that it foiled a booby-trapped boat attack by Houthis in the Red Sea and blamed the Houthis of bombing the bordering village Al Ghalifqa in Al Duraihmi district with an Iranian-made ballistic missile.\nOn 31 August, according to Houthi-run al-Masirah television network report, a Saudi Arabian airstrike attacked  three fishing boats in Yemen's western coastline of Hudaydah city, near the island of Uqban. Based on initial reports, 70 fishermen were missed with later reports mentioning the missing of 19 fishermen.\nCollapse of peace talks\nOn 9 September, the peace talk collapsed after Houthis failed to show for 3 consecutive days to start Geneva peace talks on 6 September. The Houthis demanded that the UN transfer their wounded to outside Yemen for treatment as a condition to attend the peace talks and stated that the coalition has hindered their departure to Geneva by controlling Yemen's airspace.\nSecond phase\nSeptember–October: Supply lines\nAfter the attempted peace talks between Hadi government and Al Houthis collapsed on 9 September, heavy clashes occurred between Pro Hadi and Houthis with local hospital sources claiming 11 pro-Hadi soldiers and 73 Houthi rebels to have been killed.\n;11 September\nPro-Hadi forces advanced on Al Hudaydah and seized control of key Houthi supply routes from Al Hudaydah to Sanaa, Kilo 10 and Kilo 16. A Houthi supply commander, Abu Hashem, was also reportedly killed in the advance. Houthis denied losing control of kilo 10 and kilo 16 supply routes, stating that the advance on the routes was foiled.\n;14 September\nPro-Hadi forces advanced and captured Al Hudaydah University with reports of continued clashes between pro-Hadi and Houthi forces occurring south of the city.\n;24 October\nOne Saudi-led coalition airstrike hit a busy vegetable market in the town of Bayt el-Faqih south of the Hodeida city, killed 19 civilians including two children.\nThird phase\n;1 November\nOn the first of November, the coalition deployed approximately 10,000 additional reinforcements to take part in a new offensive in Al Hudaydah.\n;3 November\nOver 200 airstrikes were reported around the Hudaydah area, along with intense fighting around the airport and the University of Hodeidah.\n;4 November\nGeert Cappelaere, UNICEF regional coordinator, described Yemen as \"a living hell for children... a living hell for every single boy and girl\" citing death of one child every 10 minutes. He further added that \"with any assault on Hodedia, we not only fear for the lives of the thousands of children in Hodedia, we also fear for the impact on children and population, particularly those living in the northern part of the country.\"\n;6 November\nA Save the Children heath facility was damaged in the fighting. UNICEF reported that fighting had reached \"dangerously close\" to the Al Thawra hospital. Houthi fighters raided the 22 May Hospital, which they used as a sniper position.\n;9 November\nHouthis state that the coalition progress is limited.

A flight chartered by the United Nations evacuated 50 wounded Houthi fighters to Muscat, Oman for medical treatment, as part of the peace talks.\nIn an interview with Al Akhbar on 27 December, the spokesman for Houthi-aligned forces stated that the coalition has violated the ceasefire several times since its start in 13 December. He also said they have evidence that the coalition is transferring Al-Qaeda and ISIS terrorists from Syria to use them as their proxies in their war against the Houthis as part of a two million-dollar agreement with the terrorists.\nStockholm agreement\nThrough UN lead effort, officials from both the Houthi Yemeni government and internationally recognized Yemeni government agreed to meet in Stockholm, Sweden to agree on peace terms regarding the battle of Al Hudaydah. The Agreement constituted three parts.\n*A ceasefire in the city of Hudaydah and the ports of Hudaydah, Salif, and Ras Issa, as well as withdrawal and redeployment of both warring forces.\n*An opening of humanitarian corridors for the movement of aid via these ports to impoverished areas of Yemen\n*A prisoner swap between warring factions aiming to release more than 15,000 prisoners and detainees.\nThe agreement was spearheaded by the UN amid increasing concerns of humanitarian disaster in Yemen. Al Hudaydah is seen as the major port that facilitates the delivery of humanitarian aid to the rest of Yemen. The UN brokered ceasefire was organized by UN special envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths, while the main two officials representing the warring factions were Mohamed Abdel Salam, the Houthi spokesman, and Khaled al-Yamani, the Foreign Minister of the Internationally recognized Yemeni government. The agreement was hailed as a major step towards a peace process in Yemen, and the Saudi-led coalition welcomed the agreement. However, the agreement was never fully implemented, and no detailed arrangement for the withdrawal of forces was made, leading to an impasse. Houthi forces refused to withdraw from Hudaydah in 2019, and Hadi's forces have accused the Houthis of repeatedly violating the ceasefire around Hudaydah.\nUN Mission to Support the Hodeidah Agreement\nIn January 2019, the UN Mission to Support the Hodeidah Agreement began.\nHouthi takeover\nIn November 2021, Houthi forces completely occupied Hudaydah after the withdrawal of Yemeni government forces from the city.\nEffect on maritime traffic and threats of strait closure\nOn 26 July, Saudi Arabia confirmed that Houthis hit a Saudi oil tanker off the western coast. Saudi energy minister announced on 26 July that the country temporarily ceases oil shipment through Bab-el-Mandeb straight after two Saudi vessels were hit by the Houthi movement. The decision led to increase in oil prices. The Houthi officials had earlier threatened that they would block the vital strait to force the coalition to stop its air strikes on Yemen. Mohammed al-Houthi said that they are able to reach high seas and Saudi ports but they want to keep the strait open in order not to give the coalition an excuse to justify their ongoing war.\nHouthi's retaliation\nOn 27 July, Muhammed Abdel Salam, a senior Houthi spokesman warned that the coalition's cities would be targeted in response to their offense on Al Hudaydah stating: \"From now on, the capitals of the Arab coalition members will no longer be safe\". This followed Houthi's claim that they had targeted UAE international airport in Abu Dhabi, which was denied by UAE authorities. On 27 July, in response to the Houthi attack against two Saudi Arabia's oil tankers, the Saudi-led coalition intensified airstrikes on Houthi-controlled areas in Hodeidah, reportedly the airstrikes targeted military police headquarters and other bases controlled by the Houthi fighters in Hodeidah, causing damage to the city's infrastructure. As a result, dozens of families were forced to flee their homes following the intensive airstrikes. Houthis stated they would stop missile strikes at Saudi Arabia if Saudi-led coalition stopped their airstrikes against them.\nContinued UN attempt for political solution\nOn 16 June, Martin Griffiths, the UN special envoy to Yemen, traveled to the Houthi-held capital Sanaa to persuade the Houthis to give up control of Al Hudaydah port amid growing fears that the battle will cut the only lifeline to the country's population. On 26 June, Martin Griffiths traveled to  Aden to persuade Hadi for a political solution and to avert an assault on the city. The Houthis reportedly had shown willingness to hand over control of Al Hudaydah port to the UN but both Hadi and the UAE insisted that the Houthis must relinquish control of the entire city.\nOn 30 June, the coalition spokesman announced a temporary pause of the offensive for progress of political dialogue. However, Houthi spokesman, Abdl al-Salam called the UAE's declaration of ceasefire \"deception\", saying that the assaults on the West coast has not stopped.\nHouthis deputy prime minister, Hussein Maqbuli, discussed in Sana with the UN coordinator, Lise Grande the conditions of over 24,000 internally displaced families in Yemen who according to Maqbuli were intimidated and compelled by the coalition to evacuate their villages and towns.\nOn 30 January 2019, a UN de-mining team was fired on as they were trying to clear access to the Al Hudaydah grain silos, with both warring parties blaming each other for the incident.\nImpact on the humanitarian situation\nReuters reported on 16 June that the battle led to the closure of the northern entrance of the western city Hodeidah, which leads to Sanaa, blocking a main exit out of the city and making it harder to transport goods from the country's largest port to mountainous regions.\nThe pro-Hadi government minister of human rights denounced the Houthis tactics of planting sea and land mines around Al Hudaydah port.\nHouthi deputy prime minister claimed that the coalition has forced over 24000 families to evacuate their towns and villages.\nThe battle forced about 2000 high-school students in Al Hudaydah to escape to Sanaa to take part in university admission exams, which was organized by the Houthis to alleviate social frustrations.\nUNICEF and UN Humanitarian Coordinator, stated that the coalition airstrikes on infrastructure and Houthi trench digging tactics which disrupt water pipes have put the lives of innocent civilians at risk and are undermining UN efforts to prevent further escalation of the humanitarian disaster, warning of a possibility of an uncontrollable cholera epidemic.\nOn 29 July, UN Humanitarian Coordinator, Lise Grande, also issued a statement in response to a 23 July Saudi airstrike on a water facility in Hodaida saying that the recent airstrikes are putting innocent civilians at extreme risk. The statement read \"despite working under some of the most difficult conditions imaginable, we’ve reached 80 percent of the people displaced by fighting with some form of assistance. Cholera is already present in neighborhoods across the city and governorate. Damage to sanitation, water and health facilities jeopardizes everything we are trying to do. We could be one airstrike away from an unstoppable epidemic.\"\nCARE International warned that Yemeni food supplies might run out in two or three months if the Hodaida port is sealed off or put out of action.\nOn 7 November, Amnesty International stated that Houthi troops took up sniper position on top of 22 May hospital, violating international law and placing civilians inside in danger.\nOn 26 January 2019 a fire caused by mortar shelling damaged two wheat silos in Al Hudaydah at the Red Sea Mills grains facility, which holds 51,000 tonnes of World Food Programme (WFP) wheat. Both warring parties blamed each other for the fire. The Red Sea Mills was previously reported to be in pro-coalition held territory during coalition forces advances prior to the ceasefire.\nReactions\n*  Supreme Political Council\nHouthi leader Mohammed Ali al-Houthi blamed the assault on Western inaction, saying that the British assured them a week earlier that no coalition troops would attack Hudayda \"without their agreement and assistance\". Houthi spokesman Abdul Salem also stated that aggression in the West Coast \"lacks moral and social values, so the aggressors resort to media show off and psychological warfare\".\nWriting an op-ed in The Washington Post, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, head of the Houthi-led Supreme Revolutionary Committee, stated the November escalation of war against Hudaida showed that US calls for peace were empty, misleading and only meant to save face after Khashoggi murder scandal, arguing that Trump administration is also interested in continuation of the war because of economic profits. He also said that the coalition is using famine and cholera as weapons of war and has undermined UN efforts for peace by threatening to cut its funding. He pointed to 2015 power-sharing deal by UN which was disrupted by the coalition airstrikes. He said that they would stop missile strikes at Saudi Arabia if Saudi-led coalition also stop their airstrikes against Yemen. \"We love peace — the kind of honorable peace defended by our revolution’s leader, Abdulmalik al-Houthi. We are ready for peace, the peace of the brave. God willing, Yemenis will remain the callers of peace and lovers of peace,\" he said.\nInternational reactions\n*\nThe Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly condemned the operation, claiming it would cause a humanitarian disaster.\n*  Hezbollah\nHezbollah's Secretary General, Hassan Nasrallah, stated that Arabs must be fighting against Israel not Yemen. Alluding to the Saudi-led Operation Decisive Storm against Yemen, he stated \"for decades there has been no ‘Decisive Storm,’ not even a slight gust of resolve to fight Israel.\" He accused Saudi Arabia of abandoning the Palestinian people and warned that KSA would face a humiliating defeat if it did not resolve the conflict through negotiations. In reference to governments taking part in the war against Yemen, he asked \"should the region go to war because of Saudi money?\"\n*\nOn 13 June 2018, the United Kingdom requested an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the battle. More than forty members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom have called on Prime Minister Theresa May to call for a ceasefire and to stop supplying weapons to coalition nations if necessary.
