He was educated at Rugby School, before going up to Oriel College, Oxford. While studying at Oxford, he made a single appearance in first-class cricket for Oxford University against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Oxford in 1886. Batting twice in the match, he was dismissed for 4 runs in the Oxford first-innings by W. G. Grace, while in their second-innings he was dismissed without scoring by the same bowler. After graduating from Oxford, he became a solicitor in 1891. Bradby died at Kensington in November 1947. His siblings included the historian Barbara Hammond, the poet and cricketer Henry Bradby, and the author Godfrey Bradby. His brother-in-law, Arthur Chitty, was also a first-class cricketer.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
