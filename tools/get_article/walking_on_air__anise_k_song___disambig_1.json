The song originally features guest vocals from the American rapper Snoop Dogg and the American singer Bella Blue. In January 2014 it was re-released worldwide with additional vocals by Lance Bass (and additionally, for release in Belgium, Ian Thomas), produced by former Michael Jackson producer Marc Schaffel.\nBackground and composition\n\"Walking on Air\" was written by Anise K with KC Porter and rap parts by Snoop Dogg, while production was handled by Anise K, KC Porter and Seth Johnson. The song was originally produced with the intention of having Rihanna feature as the lead singer. Due to scheduling issues, Anise had to search for an alternative artist. Bella Blue was brought in as a session singer to pitch the song to potential other artists. The quality of her performance secured her role for the final song. Later, hip hop singer Snoop Dogg came aboard. It was recorded in Perth (Australia) taking opportunity of Snoop Dogg's visit for 2012 Summadayze.\nKC Porter, 3-time Grammy award winning producer, overlooked the project officially mixed by Phil Tan, also a 3-time Grammy award recipient.\nMusic video\nThe music video was released on Vimeo by video producer Igor Shmaryan on November 14, 2012. Later it was published through Sony Music to Vevo.\nThe video was shot in two sections. One portion of the video was shot in Las Vegas (Nevada) directed by KC Porter and the other portion was shot in Sydney (Australia) directed by Jared Beekhuyzen for JAI Films. Featured in the video are Anise K, Snoop Dogg and Bella Blue set in a mix of dry desert, Sydney streets, and Snoop Dogg shots.\nLive performances\nOn June 25, 2013, Anise K performed the song for the first time live on international television at the MAD Awards in Greece alongside Ivi Adamou and Shaya, two of Greece's top Pop sensations. Thousands of fans live in the stadium and millions across Europe watched the much anticipated performance at the awards. The song was also used as the opening number for the Miss Universe 2013 pageant in Moscow, Russia on November 9, 2013.\nChart positions\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Weekly chart performance for \"Walking on Air\"\n! scope=\"col\" |Chart (2013–14)\n! scope=\"col\" |Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Year-end chart performance for \"Walking on Air\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Chart (2013)\n! scope=\"col\" | Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Russia Airplay (TopHit)\n| 34\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Ukraine Airplay (TopHit)\n| 66\n|}\nReferences"
