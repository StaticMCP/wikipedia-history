The cabin was constructed of peeled logs with dramatically extended ends, cut to a tapered buttress shape. A large, battered stone chimney at one end echoes the log detailing. The roof is covered by cedar shakes.\nThe cabin has two rooms on  with an attached porch. A second chimney, plainer with straight sides, is located at the rear. The porch is inset into the front facade, covered by the main roof.\nThe Cedar Breaks Caretaker's Cabin was listed on the NRHP on August 4, 1983. The nearby Cedar Breaks National Monument Visitor Center was built to a similar design by the same CCC crew from the Zion CCC camp\nSee also\n}}\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Iron County, Utah\nReferences\nExternal links"
