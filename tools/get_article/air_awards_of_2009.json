The event was hosted by The Chaser's Julian Morrow.\nAIR GM Nick O'Byrne told Billboard the awards are slowly attracting more corporate sponsorship, saying \"As far as the awards themselves go, we're developing a history of recognising artists that are yet to hit widespread mainstream success - like Gotye and Hilltop Hoods did in 2006 - or are just starting to blossom like Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu and British India last year and Blue King Brown the year before.\"\nPerformers\nNominees and winners\nAIR Awards\nWinners are listed first and highlighted in boldface; other final nominees are listed alphabetically.\n{| class=wikitable style=\"width=\"150%\"\n|-\n! ! style=\"background:#589C89; width=;\"50%\"| Best Independent Artist of the Year\n! ! style=\"background:#589C89; width=;\"50%\"| Best Independent Album\n|-\n|\n*The Drones\n**Bertie Blackman\n**Dappled Cities\n**Sia\n**C.W.
