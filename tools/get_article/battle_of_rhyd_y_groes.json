The battle resulted in a victory for Gruffydd ap Llywelyn and the death of Edwin son of Leofwine.\nIn 1039, Gruffydd seized the throne of Gwynedd after killing King Iago ap Idwal. This alarmed Gruffydd's Anglo-Saxon neighbours who after the death of King Idwal, had lost a friendly ally and been left with a dangerous new ruler on their border. To oppose Gruffydd, an English army was assembled under command of Edwin son of Leofwine, the brother of Leofric, Earl of Mercia. Gruffydd led his force to the River Severn and ambushed the English army, killing many including Edwin. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that \"The Welsh killed Edwin, Earl Leofric [of Mercia]'s brother, and Thorkil and Ælfgeat and very many good men with them\". The battle was a resounding victory for the Welsh, securing Gruffydd's eastern flank against English interference. It allowed for Gruffydd to turn south, eventually re-establishing the authority that his father Llywelyn ap Seisyll had held over South Wales.\nReferences"
