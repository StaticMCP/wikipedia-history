The battle lasted eight hours causing deaths of thousands of soldiers, and ended with the decisive victory of the Ottoman army, which used firearms and cannons not available to their enemy.\nMonument\nThe district governor of Otlukbeli initiated the construction of a monument in 2008 near the village Küçükotlukbeli, which is  north of Otlukbeli. It is situated close to the Lake Otlukbeli, aka Acıgöl (literally: Bitter Lake), a small  nature reserve lake. It is built on an area of . The monument was inaugurated on August 11, 2008, on the 535th anniversary of the battle.\nThe monument is notable because it features the reliefs of the commanders Mehmed II and Uzun Hasan, and is dedicated to all the dead soldiers from both sides.\n}}"
