It is also one of the oldest and five most important Kovils in Sri Lanka and it is believed to be one of the two Kovils in Sri Lanka to have naturally built Sivalingam. The chariot festival of the temple is held annually usually in the month of September. One of the main chariots used in the festival was constructed with wooden sculptures in the 18th century.\nHistory\nThe temple is believed to have been originated in the 4th century BC and built by Ulaga Naachi who belonged to the Chola Empire. The temple is also well known for its miracles. One of them famously witnessed during the Portuguese era in Sri Lanka. A bull statue which is located inside the temple ate grass and chased the Portuguese soldiers away from the temple who were aiming to destroy the temple at that time.\nReferences"
