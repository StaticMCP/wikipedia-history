Motives for making them include allowing more debate, delaying the enactment of the legislation, or oftentimes a direct attempt to convince the bill's legislator to withdraw said bill.\nSome opponents of particular amendments will describe them as wrecking amendments because they regard the amendments as undermining the unity of the original proposal.  Proponents of the amendment may seek to deny the charge by saying that the original proposal brings together different steps, and while personally they oppose all the parts, some parts are even worse than others and legislators should have an opportunity to consider them separately.\nWrecking amendments can pick up more votes than motions against, because observers tend to focus on who voted in favour and against the Bill in the final count, rather than looking at the amendments made during the passage through the legislature.\nExamples\n*The Wyoming House of Representatives Committee of the Whole amended House Bill 0085, a proposal to study the state's emergency preparedness, in order to kill the bill. The amendment would have required the state to consider purchasing an aircraft carrier (even though Wyoming is a landlocked state), purchasing fighter jets, establishing a military, initiating a draft, and creating a currency. Also, the creation of a currency would violate the United States Constitution.\n*The US Civil Rights Act of 1964 was amended at the last minute by Rep. Howard W. Smith of Virginia to make \"sex\" a protected class alongside race in employment opportunity. This was regarded as a wrecking amendment by those who thought that labor unions would oppose this proposal. The author of the bill claimed otherwise, and the Civil Rights Act ultimately passed with the amendment.\nSee also\n*Christmas tree bill\n*Omnibus bill\n*Probing amendment\n*Rider (legislation)\nReferences"
