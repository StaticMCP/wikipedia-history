By 1978, the building, originally located at No. 141, Siwei Road, Da'an District, Taipei City, had fallen into a state of disrepair. It had failed to be registered as a historical site, putting it at risk of demolition for the Dunhua South Road expansion project.\nHowever, after petitions from many scholars and experts, Taipei City managed to relocate the building, and rebuilt it at its current situation. The building was opened to the public as a museum in May2000. In 2010, its courtyard underwent extension.\nArchitecture\nThe building follows the southern Fujian style courtyard. Rocks that cover the front yard of the house are the rocks taken from what was mainland merchants used to stabilize their ships. There is a pond in front of the house used for defense purpose and also for drinking and fire extinguisher.\nTransportation\nThe museum is accessible within walking distance east of Yuanshan Station of Taipei Metro.\nSee also\n* List of museums in Taiwan\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
