The genus name Phylloscopus is from Ancient Greek phullon, \"leaf\", and skopos, \"seeker\" (from skopeo, \"to watch\"). The specific nitidus is from Latin and means \"shining\".\nIt is most closely related to the greenish warbler but is brighter in colour, and the underside is much more yellow. It has one strong and one faint wing bar, especially in young birds.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Green Warbler\n\n#REDIRECT Green warbler\n}}"
