The tournament, organized by the European Hockey Federation, was held in Brasschaat, Belgium, from 30 September to 3 October 2021.\nFormat\nAs a secondary tournament to the Euro Hockey League, the Ranking Cup was created to determine the placings of the lower ranked teams for the 2020–21 EHL Season.\nThe tournament comprised 16 teams, competing in a round of 16 format. The victorious teams from the first knockout games went on to compete in the placement matches for fifth to twelfth place. The losing teams contested ranking matches to determine thirteenth to twentieth places.\nOriginal format\nThe tournament was originally scheduled to comprise eight teams in a knockout format, with the remaining 12 to appear at the Euro Hockey League. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic however, the EHL was rescheduled and reduced to four teams, with the remaining eight teams being added to the Ranking Cup.\nResults\nBracket\nGrange|0| Arminen ()|5\n|30 September| Dinamo Elektrostal|2| Kampong|5\n|30 September| Den Bosch|6| Saint Germain|0\n|30 September| Gantoise|4 (3)| Club de Campo (s.o.)|4 (4)\n|2 October| Mannheimer HC (s.o.)|2 (2)| Hampstead & Westminster|2 (0)\n|2 October| Minsk|5| Three Rock Rovers|4\n|2 October| Dinamo Ak-Bars|0| Rot-Weiss Köln ()|5\n|2 October| Dragons (s.o.)|1 (3)| Surbiton|1 (1)\n|1 October| Arminen|1| Kampong|5\n|1 October| Den Bosch|3| Club de Campo|2\n|3 October| Mannheimer HC|5| Minsk|1\n|3 October| Rot-Weiss Köln|1| Dragons|5\n}}\nRound of 16\n| score   = 0–5\n| team2   =  Arminen\n| report  = Grange forfeit the match.[https://eurohockey.altiusrt.com/matches/3407/reports/matchreport Report]\n| goals1  =\n| goals2  =\n| umpires =\n}}\n----\n| score   = 2–5\n| team2   =  Kampong\n| report  = [https://eurohockey.altiusrt.com/matches/3408/reports/matchreport Report]\n| goals1  = Dvoretskii\n| goals2  = Kempermann Janssen Lageman Kellerman\n| umpires = Alex Fedenczuk (SCO)Andrés Ortíz (ESP)\n}}\n----\n| score   = 6–0\n| team2   =  Saint Germain\n| report  = [https://eurohockey.altiusrt.com/matches/3409/reports/matchreport Report]\n| goals1  = Smith Wotherspoon Bijen Boers\n| goals2  =\n| umpires = Bruce Bale (ENG)Shane O'Donnell (IRE)\n}}\n----\n| score   = 4–4\n| team2   =  Club de Campo\n| report  = [https://eurohockey.altiusrt.com/matches/3410/reports/matchreport Report]\n| goals1  = Kina Scheen Masson Bugallo\n| goals2  = Lacalle Basterra Iglesias\n| umpires = Maarten Boxma (NED)Tim Meissner (GER)\n| penalties1 = Bugallo Masson Tynevez Kina Ferreiro\n| penaltyscore = 3–4\n| penalties2 =  Iglesias Abajo L.
