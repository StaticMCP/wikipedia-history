The final two issues were published bi-monthly under the name Warhammer Comic. It featured stories set within the fictional universe of Games Workshop's miniature wargames Warhammer and Warhammer 40,000, amongst others.\nFormat\nThe comic used an anthology format, usually featuring three or four stories each of seven to eight pages in length. The stories in Warhammer Monthly were usually serialised, and would run for several months. The most popular stories returned for more series, and were often collected in trade paperback form.\nThe December 2002 issue of the comic book was called Warhammer Warped Visions. It featured one-shot variations of Black Library's most popular comics, but with their settings reversed between the Warhammer and Warhammer 40,000 universes. For example, the Dark Elf Malus Darkblade was portrayed as a female Dark Eldar named Maless, while the Titan Imperius Dictatio was shown as an Empire Steam Tank.\nCancellation\nWarhammer Monthly was cancelled after issue 86.\nIn 2006, Games Workshop licensed the comic books rights to Boom! Studios. That publisher's first Warhammer 40,000 release was Damnation Crusade, written by Warhammer Monthly stalwart Dan Abnett.\nIn 2007, The Black Library started the Warhammer Monthly Archive, a site with free PDF versions of the comics.  However the site was closed in 2009.\nAwards\nWarhammer Monthly was voted the Best New British comic in the 1999 National Comics Awards.\nThe series was nominated for two Eagle Awards and won one:\n* 2000 - nominated for Favourite British Comic\n* 2001 - nominated for Favourite British Comic\n* 2005 - won Favourite British Comic\nSee also\n* Warhammer 40,000 comics, about the various releases\nNotes\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.blacklibrary.com/whm/default.htm Cached version of Black Library's Warhammer Monthly mini-site]\n* [http://www.blacklibrary.com/free-stuff/downloads/warhammer-monthly/default.asp WHM downloads], PDFs of the full issues #0-13, Black Library\n* [http://www.blacklibrary.com/product.asp?prod=60710299058&type=Book Warhammer Comic #86], details of the last issue"
