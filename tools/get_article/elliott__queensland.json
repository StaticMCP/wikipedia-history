In the , Elliott had a population of 156 people.\nGeography\nThe locality is bounded in part by the Childers Road to the west and by Goodwood Road to the east.\nThe Springs is a neighbourhood in the north of the locality ()\nThe Elliott River rises in the west of the locality () and flows east, forming part of the boundary with Alloway and exiting the locality. The river flows into the Coral Sea at Elliott Heads.\nSeveral large areas of the locality are within the Elliott River State Forest which extends into neighbouring Gregory River and Promisedland to the south-west.\nOther large areas are within the Bingera National Park and the Bingera Conservation Parks (1 and 2). These parks seek to protect coastal plant communities, the waterholes along Mahogany Creek and an important habitat corridor. Although open to the public, the parks do not have visitor facilities as they are intended to be natural places and therefore only suitable for \"self-reliant\" visitors.\nThe remainder of the locality is used for agriculture, mostly growing sugarcane with some grazing on native vegetation. There is a network of cane tramways in the locality to transport the harvested sugarcane to the Isis Central sugar mill.\nHistory\nThe locality is named after the Elliott River, which in turn is named after pastoralist and politician Gilbert Eliott (albeit with a slightly different spelling).\nElliott State School opened on 4 February 1886 and it is believed there was a \"school at Bingera and Baranyan Homestead near Bundaberg\" on the site prior to this. In 1960, it was renamed Alloway State School. It is now within the boundaries of the suburb of Alloway.\nThe Bundaberg Soaring Club (now the Bundaberg Gliding Club) was established in 1965.\nThe Bingera National Park was gazetted in 2006. The two Bingera Conservation Parks were gazette in 2010.\nDemographics\nIn the , Elliott had a population of 138 people.\nIn the , Elliott had a population of 156 people.\nEducation\nBurnett Youth Learning Centre is a private secondary (7-12) school for boys and girls at 3693 Goodwood Road ().
