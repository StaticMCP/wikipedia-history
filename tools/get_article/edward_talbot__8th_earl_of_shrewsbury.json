He entered Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1579. Edward and his brother Henry Talbot (1563–1596) had an audience with Queen Elizabeth in November 1580.\nHe served twice as Knight of the Shire (MP) for Northumberland in 1584 and 1586. He was a JP for Northumberland from c. 1592 and appointed Sheriff of Northumberland for 1601 and 1609. He was a member of the Council of the North from 1603 until his death in 1618. He died in London in his 57th year and was buried in Westminster Abbey.\nIn 1583, he married Joane Ogle, Baroness Ogle, the daughter of Cuthbert Ogle, 7th Baron Ogle. None of their children survived him, and he was succeeded by his nearest male relative, George Talbot of Grafton, who became the 9th Earl. However, some of the extensive family estates passed to the daughters of his elder brother and predecessor and devolved ultimately to the Dukes of Norfolk.\nReferences\nExternal links\n;Attribution\n*"
