As of the 2020 census, the population was 242,337. Its county seat is Lebanon and largest city is Mason. The county is one of Ohio's most affluent, with the highest median income of the state's 88 counties. The county was established on May 1, 1803, from Hamilton County; it is named for Dr. Joseph Warren, a hero of the Revolution who sent Paul Revere and the overlooked William Dawes on their famous rides and who died at the Battle of Bunker Hill. Warren County is part of the Cincinnati, OH-KY-IN Metropolitan Statistical Area.\nHistory\nWarren County was established in 1803. The first non-Native American settlers were migrants from New England. During the election of 1860 Abraham Lincoln received 60% of the vote in Warren County, and in 1864 he was reelected with 70% of the vote in the county.  From that time on the county was a stronghold of the Republican party, with Ulysses S. Grant going on to carry the county by large margins in both 1868 and 1872.\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which  is land and  (1.5%) is water. The county is a rough square with the sides about  long.\nAdjacent counties\n* Montgomery County (northwest)\n* Greene County (northeast)\n* Clinton County (east)\n* Clermont County (south)\n* Hamilton County (southwest)\n* Butler County (west)\nBoundaries\nWarren County was created by the first Ohio General Assembly in the Act of March 24, 1803, which also created Butler and Montgomery Counties. The act defined Warren County as \"all that part of the county of Hamilton included within the following bounds, viz.: Beginning at the northeast corner of the county of Clermont, running thence west with the line of said county to the Little Miami; thence up the same with the meanders thereof to the north boundary of the first tier of sections in the second entire range of townships in the Miami Purchase; thence west to the northeast corner of Section No. 7 in the third township of the aforesaid range; thence north to the Great Miami; thence up the same to the middle of the fifth range of townships; thence east to the County line; thence with same south to the place of beginning.\" Originally this included land now in Clinton County as far east as Wilmington.\nClinton County proved a continuing headache to the legislature. The Ohio Constitution requires that every county have an area of at least four hundred square miles (1,036&nbsp;km2). Clinton County's boundaries were several times adjusted in an effort to comply with that clause of the constitution. One of them, the Act of January 30, 1815, detached a strip of land from the eastern side to give to Clinton. That would have left Warren under four hundred square miles (1,036&nbsp;km2), so a portion of Butler County (the part of Franklin Township where Carlisle is now located) was attached to Warren in compensation. The 1815 act was as follows:\n* Section 1—That all that part of the county of Butler lying and being within the first and second fractional townships in the fifth range, and adjoining the south line of Montgomery County, shall be and the same is hereby attached to and made part of the county of Warren.\n* Section 2—That eleven square miles 28&nbsp;km2 of the territory of the county of Warren and extending parallel to the said eastern boundary of Warren County, along the whole length of such eastern boundary from north to south, shall be and the same is hereby attached to and made a part of the county of Clinton.\"\nExcept for the sections formed by the Great and Little Miamis, the sides are all straight lines.\nLakes and rivers\nThe major rivers of the county are the Great Miami River, which flows through the northwest corner of the county in Franklin Township, and the Little Miami River which zig-zags across the county from north to south. There is one sizable lake, the Caesars Creek Reservoir, created by a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dam on Caesars Creek in the northeast part of the county in Massie Township.\nMajor highways\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nDemographics\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census1790-1960 1900-19901990-2000 2010-2020\n}}\n2020 census\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+Warren County, Ohio – Racial and ethnic composition\n!Race / Ethnicity (NH = Non-Hispanic)\n!Pop 1980\n!Pop 1990\n!Pop 2000\n!Pop 2010\n!style=\"background-color: #ffffb3;\" | Pop 2020\n!% 1980\n!% 1990\n!% 2000\n!% 2010\n!style=\"background-color: #ffffb3;\" |% 2020\n|-\n|White alone (NH)\n|96,861\n|110,124\n|148,850\n|189,305\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |198,227\n|97.57%\n|96.68%\n|93.98%\n|89.00%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |81.80%\n|-\n|Black or African American alone (NH)\n|1,700\n|2,385\n|4,272\n|6,838\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |8,175\n|1.71%\n|2.09%\n|2.70%\n|3.21%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |3.37%\n|-\n|Native American or Alaska Native alone (NH)\n|79\n|223\n|267\n|289\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |288\n|0.08%\n|0.20%\n|0.17%\n|0.14%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |0.12%\n|-\n|Asian alone (NH)\n|169\n|626\n|1,978\n|8,261\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |17,278\n|0.17%\n|0.55%\n|1.25%\n|3.88%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |7.13%\n|-\n|Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander alone (NH)\n|x\n|x\n|40\n|93\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |158\n|x\n|x\n|0.03%\n|0.04%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |0.07%\n|-\n|Other race alone (NH)\n|89\n|27\n|118\n|272\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |704\n|0.09%\n|0.02%\n|0.07%\n|0.13%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |0.29%\n|-\n|Mixed race or Multiracial (NH)\n|x\n|x\n|1,225\n|2,851\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |9,769\n|x\n|x\n|0.77%\n|1.34%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |4.03%\n|-\n|Hispanic or Latino (any race)\n|378\n|524\n|1,633\n|4,784\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |7,738\n|0.38%\n|0.46%\n|1.03%\n|2.25%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |3.19%\n|-\n|Total\n|99,276\n|113,909\n|158,383\n|212,693\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |242,337\n|100.00%\n|100.00%\n|100.00%\n|100.00%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |100.00%\n|}\n2010 census\nAs of the 2010 United States census, there were 212,693 people, 76,424 households, and 57,621 families residing in the county.

Since the first presidential election after its founding, 1856, Warren County has supported the Republican candidate for president all but once, the exception being 1964 when Warren County voted for Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson over Barry M. Goldwater. Jimmy Carter is the only other Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win as much as 40 percent of the county's vote. In 2008, Warren County cast the largest net vote for John McCain of any Ohio county. Before the Republican Party was formed, Warren County supported the Whigs.\nThe Republican trend is no less pronounced at the state level. Since 1869, Warren County has almost always supported the Republican candidate for Governor of Ohio, the exceptions being in 1924 when it supported Vic Donahey, 1932 (George White), 1952 (Frank Lausche), and 1958 (Michael V. DiSalle). However, other than DiSalle, each of these four Democrats, who were all victorious statewide, were conservative Democrats.\nIn local races, Warren County occasionally elected Democrats for much of the 20th century. In 1976, two of the three county commission seats were won by Democrats, and as late as the 1990s, local elections between Democrats and Republicans frequently remained competitive. However, with the massive expansion of Warren County's population in the 1990s, the county turned as solidly Republican at the local level as it already was at other levels, with Republicans typically running unopposed. In elections between 1996 and 2012, in which eight county offices were on the ballot, no Democrat even filed. In November 1999, the last elected Democrat to hold office in Warren County, a member of the Educational Service Center (county school board), lost her seat to a Republican.\n}}\n|}\nEducation\nPublic school districts\nSchool districts include:\n* Bellbrook-Sugarcreek Local School District\n* Blanchester City School District (also in Brown, Clermont, and Clinton)\n* Carlisle Local School District (also in Montgomery)\n** Carlisle High School, Carlisle (the Indians)\n* Clinton-Massie Local School District (also in Clinton)\n* Franklin City School District\n** Franklin High School, Franklin (the Wildcats)\n* Goshen Local School District (also in Clermont), which operates Goshen High School\n* Kings Local School District\n** Kings High School, Kings Mills (the Knights)\n* Lebanon City School District\n** Lebanon High School, Lebanon (the Warriors)\n* Little Miami Local School District (also in Clermont)\n** Little Miami High School, Morrow (the Panthers)\n* Loveland City School District (also in Clermont and Hamilton)\n* Mason City School District\n** William Mason High School, Mason (the Comets)\n* Middletown City School District (also in Butler)\n* Monroe Local School District (also in Butler) (which operates Lemon-Monroe High School)\n* Princeton City School District (also in Butler and Hamilton)\n* Springboro Community City School District (also in Montgomery)\n** Springboro High School, Springboro (the Panthers)\n* Wayne Local School District\n** Waynesville High School, Waynesville (the Spartans)\n* Xenia City School District (also in Greene and Clinton)\nNon-geographic districts include:\n* Warren County Vocational School District\n** Warren County Career Center, Lebanon\nPrivate schools\n* Bishop Fenwick High School – Franklin\n* Lebanon Christian School – Lebanon\n* Mars Hill Academy - Mason\n* Middletown Christian Schools – Franklin\n* St. Margaret of York School – Loveland\n* Liberty Bible Academy – Mason\n* St. Susanna Parish School – Mason\n* Royalmont Academy – Mason\n* St. Francis de Sales – Lebanon\n* CinDay Academy - Springboro\nVirtual schools\n* Warren County Virtual Community School\nVocational schools\n* Warren County Career Center\nColleges and universities\nWarren County has no native colleges or universities, but was the original site selected for Miami University which instead located in Oxford, Ohio in 1809. National Normal University, a teachers college, was in Lebanon from 1855 until 1917 when it closed. Several colleges offer classes in Warren County at various locations, including Sinclair Community College of Dayton, the University of Cincinnati, and Wilmington College. Sinclair opened a branch in the Mason area in 2007. The University of Cincinnati owns  of land at the intersections of I-71 and Wilmington road, but no plans for development on the site have been announced.\nLibraries\nThe county has six public libraries:\n* Franklin Public Library - Franklin\n* Lebanon Public Library - Lebanon\n* Mary L.

The runway is a 4502' x 65' paved and lighted north–south runway (01/19), and parallel taxiway. Navigation and communications equipment includes PAPI, AWOS, Pilot Controlled Lighting, and UNICOM. The airport runway, taxiway, and navigation equipment is owned by the county. The county leases a public terminal, but other facilities are privately owned and operated under contract by a Fixed-base operator. The airport serves general and business aviation, but has no commercial airlines.\nThere are also two privately owned operating airports in the county; Waynesville airport, also known as Red Stewart Field (40I), and Caesar Creek Gliderport (2OH9), both with grass runways. Operations have ceased at two former private paved runway airports, Brownie's Lebanon Airport (19I), and Lebanon San Mar Gale (OH79).\nRail and Bus\nWarren County does not have passenger train service except for a scenic train that runs between Lebanon and Mason. Freight trains still serve Carlisle, and on a limited basis, Monroe, Mason, and Lebanon. Historically, there have been several trains that ran through the county whose stops became cities and villages. These trains include the Cincinnati, Lebanon and Northern Railway, the Middletown and Cincinnati Railroad, and the Little Miami Railroad whose path is now replaced by the Little Miami Bike Trail. There have been proposals to run commuter trains from Cincinnati to the Kings Island area, but none have ever found sufficient support or funding.\nThere is no public bus transportation based in Warren County, but there is limited service from Cincinnati to Mason and Kings Island. Middletown also runs bus service to eastern portions of Middletown that are in Warren County.\nWaterways\nThere are no commercially navigable waterways in Warren County, but the Warren County Canal did operate in the 19th century as a branch of the Miami and Erie Canal, bringing freight to Lebanon by canal boat. Recreationally, the Little Miami River can be traveled by canoe or kayak for its length through the county, and motorized boating can be done at Caesar's Creek Lake.\nMedia\nThe Journal-News circulates in Franklin, Springboro, Lebanon, and Turtlecreek Township. The Dayton Daily News, circulates in the northern part of the county. The Cincinnati Enquirer circulates through most of the county while the Cincinnati Post abandoned all distribution in the county in 2004.\nAmong its weekly papers was The Western Star, the oldest weekly in the state and the oldest newspaper west of the Appalachians published under its original name. It was closed on January 17, 2013. The Star, like the Pulse-Journal in Mason and the Star-Press in Springboro, was owned by the parent of the Middletown Journal and the Dayton Daily News, Cox Media Group. Other weeklies include the Franklin Chronicle.\nFor a time in the mid-1990s, Lebanon was the home of commercial radio station WMMA-FM, begun by Mike and Marilyn McMurray in 1994. The McMurrays sold to what was then known as American Radio Systems License Corp. a Boston-based chain of stations which also owned Cincinnati stations WGRR-FM and WKRQ (both since sold to various other owners). The new owners moved the station to Hamilton County. In 2010, the only radio station in the county at the time was WLMH-FM, a student-run station at Little Miami High School in Hamilton Township. It went off the air around 2010, and in 2012, the FCC removed WLMH from their database and cancelled their license as a result of no broadcasts for over a year.\nWarren County is assigned to the Cincinnati television market, but Dayton television stations treat it as part of their market as well.\nRecreation and attractions\n* Kings Island: Theme park\n* Cincinnati Open: Professional tennis tournament\n* Great Wolf Lodge: Indoor water park resort\n* Ozone Zipline Adventures: Ziplines ranging from 250 feet to 1300 feet\n* Lebanon Mason Monroe Railroad: Nostalgic, themed train rides\n* Fort Ancient: American Indian earthen mounds\n* Caesar Creek State Park and Caesar Creek Lake\n* Caesar's Creek Pioneer Village\n* Little Miami Scenic Trail: Scenic bike trail\n* Lebanon Countryside Trail\n* The Golden Lamb: Ohio's oldest continuously operating inn\n* La Comedia Dinner Theatre: Professional dinner theater\n* Morgan's Canoe Livery: Canoe rental on Little Miami National Scenic River\n* Bella Balloons & Gentle Breeze Balloons: Balloon sightseeing tours\n* Vertical Advantage Helicopters: Helicopter sightseeing tours\n* Start Skydiving: Skydiving\n* Red Stewart Airfield: Airplane sightseeing tours from a grass-strip airfield\n* Cincinnati AVP Open: Professional beach volleyball tournament\n* Warren County Historical Society Museum\n* Glendower State Memorial\n* Miami Valley Gaming\n* Ohio Renaissance Festival\n* Lebanon Horse-Drawn Carriage Parade & Festival\n* The Christmas Ranch\nCommunities\nCities\n* Carlisle (part)\n* Franklin\n* Lebanon (county seat)\n* Loveland (part)\n* Mason\n* Middletown (part)\n* Monroe (part)\n* South Lebanon\n* Springboro (part)\nVillages\n* Blanchester (part)\n* Butlerville\n* Corwin\n* Harveysburg\n* Maineville\n* Morrow\n* Pleasant Plain\n* Waynesville\nTownships\n* Clearcreek\n* Deerfield\n* Franklin\n* Hamilton\n* Harlan\n* Massie\n* Salem\n* Turtlecreek\n* Union\n* Washington\n* Wayne\nCensus-designated places\n* Five Points\n* Hunter\n* Kings Mills\n* Landen\n* Loveland Park\n* Roachester\nUnincorporated communities\n* Beedles Station\n* Blackhawk\n* Blue Ball (a neighborhood of Middletown)\n* Brown's Store\n* Cozaddale\n* Crosswick\n* Dallasburg\n* Dodds\n* Edwardsville\n* Fort Ancient\n* Fosters\n* Genn Town\n* Greentree Corners\n* Hagemans Crossing\n* Hammel\n* Hillcrest\n* Henpeck\n* Hicks\n* Hopkinsville\n* Kenricksville\n* Level\n* Mathers Mill\n* Middleboro\n* Mount Holly\n* Murdoch\n* Oregonia\n* Pekin\n* Red Lion\n* Rossburg\n* Ridgeville\n* San Mar Gale\n* Socialville\n* Twenty Mile Stand\n* Union Village\n* Utica\n* Zoar\nNotable people\n* Neil Armstrong, Astronaut\n* Robert Benham, Pioneer politician\n* Clarence Brown, Jr., Congressman\n* John Chivington, Civil War officer\n* Thomas Corwin, Governor\n* Brant Daugherty, Actor\n* William H.
