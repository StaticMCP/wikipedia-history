On June 6, 1761, Crimean forces, led by several commanders from the elite Kapı kulu, clashed with the combined forces of the Temirgoy, Bzhedug, Besleney, and Makhosh tribes near the Kuban River.\nThe Circassians, led by their tribal princes and supported by a significant military alliance, decisively defeated the Crimean forces. The Circassians captured a substantial portion of the Crimean troops, including several high-ranking officials such as three of the Kapı kulu commanders and five beys, the leading military and political figures of the Crimean Khanate. This victory significantly weakened the Crimean Khanate's position in the region.\nIn response to the defeat, Khan Qırım Giray attempted to raise a new large army to retaliate. According to Russian sources, a 30,000-strong force was reportedly sent to deal with the Circassians. However, due to internal struggles and defections—particularly the retreat of the Crimean commander Bahadır Giray — the Crimean counteroffensive was never realized. Despite rumors in November 1763 about a renewed invasion, the campaign was ultimately called off.\nThe military engagements between the Crimean Khanate and Circassian principalities were often not direct confrontations, but rather consisted of raids and skirmishes. According to historians, the Crimean Khanate could gather large cavalry forces, but the Circassian noble cavalry was highly skilled in combat, which allowed them to effectively resist the larger Crimean armies. One of the key elements in these conflicts was the use of raiding tactics by both sides.\nThe Battle of Ust-Labinsk, also known as \"Лэбэпэ зау\" in the oral tradition of the Circassians, was a defining moment in this struggle. In June 1761, the Crimean Khanate, under the leadership of Khan Bagadyr Giray, launched a military campaign against the Temirgoy tribe, one of the most influential Circassian factions. After an intense battle near the mouth of the Laba River, the Crimean forces were decisively defeated by the Circassian cavalry. The surviving Crimean soldiers fled in panic, and many were captured.\nReferences"
