      "text": "# The Raspberry Ripple Awards\n\nThe Raspberry Ripple Awards was an awards show broadcast in 1997 to celebrate (and sometimes ridicule) the representation of disabled people in the media. The idea, formulated by the 1 in 8 Group and produced by Kudos Productions was made for Channel 4.\nSynopsis\nThe Raspberry Ripple Awards were designed to recognise the inclusivity of disabled people within the media industry. Actor Alan Cumming presented the awards on the night. The awards ranged from radio to theatre, Children's television to Factual television. They also gave out awards to the worst portrayals, highlighting the ways that media companies should not address disability. Cumming said the words \"...could not be here tonight...\" to rapturous laughter and applause, although on some occasions did invite surprise guests linked to that production to the stage to catch them off guard.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Award\n!Nominee\n!Produced By\n!Result\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Best Theatre Production\n|Sympathy for the Devil\n|Grey Eye Theatre\n|Winner\n|-\n|Waiting for Godot\n|Tottering Bipeds\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Sitting Pretty\n|Arc Theatre\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Worst Theatre Production\n|The Cripple of Inishmaan\n|The National Theatre\n|Winner – only nomination\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Best Television Factual\n|The Clothes Show\n|BBC\n|Winner\n|-\n|\"Challenging Children\"\n|Q.E.D.\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Over the Edge – \"Strange Little Creatures\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" |BBC\n|Nominated\n|-\n|BBC United Kingdom – \"Tottering Bipeds\"\n|Nominated\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Worst Television Factual\n|Network First – \"Igor: The Boy Who Dared to Dream\"\n|ITV\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Panorama – \"Care in the Community\"\n|BBC\n|Winner\n|-\n|Picture This – \"Nick at New College\"\n|BBC/3BM\n|Nominated\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Best Radio Documentary\n|''Chris' Story\n|BBC Radio 4\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Disability Day\n|Talkradio\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Dear Diary – Bristol to Tuana\n|BBC Radio 4\n|Nominated\n|-\n|Peter White\n| -\n|Winner\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Best Radio Drama\n|Spoonface Steinberg\n| rowspan=\"2\" |BBC Radio 4\n|Winner\n|-\n|Minor Adjustment''\n|Nominated\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Best Children's Television Show\n|ZZZap!\n|CITV\n|Nominated\n|-\n|''Sonny's Ears\n|CITV\n|Winner\n|-\n|The Vibe''\n|Channel 4\n|Nominated\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Best Commercial\n|Coca-Cola – \"Eat Football, Sleep Football, Drink Coca-Cola\"\n|Coca-Cola\n|Nominated\n|-\n|The Co-operative Bank – \"See the Person, Not the Disability\"\n|The National Disability Council\n|Winner\n|-\n|Worst Commercial\n|\"Drinking Wrecks Lives\"\n|Ministry of Transport\n|Winner – only nomination\n|}\nReferences"
