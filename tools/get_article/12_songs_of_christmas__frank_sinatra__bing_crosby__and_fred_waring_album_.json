The singers previously collaborated on the album America, I Hear You Singing, which was released earlier the same year. The album was reissued as White Christmas on by WEA budget label Midi in 1973.\nWhile the album has never been reissued on a standalone CD, Reprise Records included it in a special 2-CD \"Christmas edition\" of their Frank Sinatra compilation Nothing but the Best in 2008.\nReception\n}}\nIn the US, Variety received the album favorably. \"This is an attractive compilation of seasonal standards delivered in standout style by Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra, singly and in tandem, with the polished support of Fred Waring's Pennsylvanians. Among the top sides in this set are \"Go Tell It on the Mountain,\" \"The Little Drummer Boy,\" \"I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day\" and \"The 12 Days of Christmas.\"\nGramophone in the UK was not so keen, commenting: \"'12 Songs of Christmas,' with Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra and Fred Waring and the Pennsylvanians (Reprise FS 2022). Plenty of expensive talent crammed uncomfortably into a small, well-worn stocking. Obvious, pallid stuff, with the two head groaners actually together on only two tracks, and neither of them anywhere in particularly good voice. Collectors of sheer corn may take a perverse delight in an item called 'We Wish You the Merriest.'\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n* Fred Waring and the Pennsylvanians (Tracks 1, 5, 8, 10)\n* Bing Crosby and Fred Waring (Tracks 2, 9, 11)\n* Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra and Fred Waring (Track 3, 12)\n* Frank Sinatra and Fred Waring (Track 4, 6, 7)\nReferences"
