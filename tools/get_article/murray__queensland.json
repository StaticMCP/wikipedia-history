The northern part of the suburb is occupied by the Lavarack Barracks.\nHistory\nVC, 1917]]\nMurray is situated in the traditional Bindal and Wulgurukaba Aboriginal country.\nThe origin of the suburb name is from Lieutenant Colonel Henry William Murray who was awarded the Victoria Cross in 1917 for his actions during the Battle of the Somme.\nOn 21 July 1939, with the Second World War looming, Murray volunteered for military service and was appointed as commanding officer of the 26th (Militia) Battalion, 11th Brigade, based in Townsville; he was mobilised for full-time service on 21 October 1941. The 26th became an Australian Imperial Force unit in 1942, and in August Murray was removed from his post by General Sir Thomas Blamey, Commander in Chief Australian Military Forces, on the grounds of his advancing age. He was instead appointed to command the 23rd Queensland Regiment, Volunteer Defence Corps, which he led until his retirement from active duty on 8 February 1944.\nThe suburb was named after Murray on 1 April 1969.\nIn 1972, the Lavarack Golf Club opened at the barracks on land leased from Australian Department of Defence (). It was an 18-hole course and open to membership by the wider community. In December 2021, the golf club closed as the Department of Defence did not wish to renew the lease as it intended to redevelop the land as sporting and training facilities for defence force use.\nDemographics\nIn the , Murray had a population of 1,491 people.\nIn the , Murray had a population of 1,739 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Murray.
