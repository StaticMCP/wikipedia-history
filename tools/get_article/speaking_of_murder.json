The original French title is Le rouge est mis, which means \"the red light is on\". The screenplay is based on a novel by Auguste Le Breton.\nPlot\nLouis Bertain (Gabin) is the owner of a Paris garage which is the front for a robbery gang. He and his accomplices are careful to keep up a civic veneer by day, indulging in criminal activities only when \"the red light is on\" at night. This status quo is upset when one of the gang members becomes convinced that Louis' younger brother is a police informer.\nCast\n* Jean Gabin as Louis Bertain / Louis le Blond\n* Paul Frankeur as Frédo\n* Marcel Bozzuffi as Pierre (as Marcel Bozzufi)\n* Albert Dinan as L'inspecteur Pluvier (as Dinan)\n* Antonin Berval as Zé (as Berval)\n* Thomy Bourdelle as Le catcheur\n* Serge Lecointe as Bébert\n* Jean-Pierre Mocky as Pierre\n* Jo Peignot as Mimile (as Georges Peignot)\n* Lucien Raimbourg as Jo\n* Gabriel Gobin as L'inspecteur Bouvard\n* Jean Bérard as Raymond, le matelot\n* Gaby Basset as Hortense\n* Gina Nicloz as Mme Bertain (as Gina Niclos)\n* Lucienne Legrand as La dame du garage\n* Josselin as Antoine\n* Claude Nicot as L'effeminé\n* Lino Ventura as Pepito\n* Annie Girardot as Hélène (as Annie Girardot de la Comédie Française)\nSee also\n* List of French films of 1957\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.cinema-francais.fr/les_films/films_g/films_grangier_gilles/le_rouge_est_mis.htm  Speaking of Murder at “Cinema-francais“] (French)\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9903E4D9133CE63BBC4A52DFB6678382649EDE Speaking of Murder movie review at The New York Times] Last accessed: July 3, 2014."
