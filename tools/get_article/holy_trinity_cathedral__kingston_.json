It is located between North Street and George Headley Drive.\nThe church is the seat of the metropolitan Archbishop of Kington in Jamaica and was consecrated in 1911. Its Byzantine Revival design was conceived by American architect Raymond F. Almirall, at the bequest of bishop John J. Collins. Pope John Paul II paid a visit on 10 August 1993.\nThe cathedral was built after the destruction, in the earthquake of 1907, of the Church of the Holy Trinity in the Duke and Sutton streets. It is located on a site adjacent to Winchester Park, the works beginning in 1908.\nThe religious services for the state funerals of Prime Ministers Michael Manley and Edward Seaga were held at the Cathedral.\nSee also\n*Catholicism in Jamaica\nReferences"
