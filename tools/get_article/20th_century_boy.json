Rex, written by Marc Bolan, released as a stand-alone single on 2 March 1973.\nAlthough at first considered as its closing track, \"20th Century Boy\" was not featured on the album Tanx, released at the same time in early March. It was later added as a bonus track on the 1985 reissue of Tanx and on all versions released since.\nRecording\n\"20th Century Boy\"\n\"20th Century Boy\" was recorded on 3 December 1972 in Toshiba Recording Studios in Tokyo, Japan at a session that ran between 3:00p.m. and 1:30a.m. For possibly the first time, producer Tony Visconti was not present at a T. Rex session, with Marc and Mick O'Halloran assuming the role. Despite this, Visconti is still officially credited with production. Backing vocals, hand claps, acoustic guitar and saxophones were recorded in England when T. Rex returned to the country after their tour.\nThe single version of the track fades out at three minutes and 39 seconds; however, the multi-track master reveals that the song ended in nearly a full three minutes' worth of jamming. A rough mix of the full-length version can be found on the ''Bump 'n' Grind'' compilation.\nAccording to Marc Bolan, the lyrics are based on quotes taken from notable celebrities such as Muhammad Ali. This can be seen through the inclusion of the line \"sting like a bee\", which is taken from one of Ali's 1969 speeches.\n\"Free Angel\"\n\"Free Angel\" was recorded during the first sessions for the Tanx album, between 1 and 4 August 1972. The single was mixed for release at Air Studios on 16 December 1972.\nRelease and reception\n\"20th Century Boy\" was released on 2 March 1973. It entered the UK Singles Chart at number 3 on 10 March 1973 and peaked three weeks in a row at that position. It stayed a total of nine weeks in the UK Chart while topping the charts in Ireland, although like most T. Rex singles it failed to chart in the US.\nThe song was met with a warm reception in Bolan's home country, where Chris Welch of Melody Maker noted that \"guitars tremble, Marc howls, and it's 'gang awa' with another in his series of rhythmic entertainments\". Charles Shaar Murray of NME thought it was the group's best since \"Telegram Sam\" with \"Marc's thunder guitar majestically assaulting you.\" Peter Jones at Record Mirror wrote that it was \"very, very good indeed\" and predicted it would top the charts. However, Penny Valentine at Sounds, who had praised earlier T. Rex hits, now lamented that Bolan \"hadn't extended his musical capabilities as far as he might have done.\"\nThe song returned to the UK Top 20 in 1991, peaking at number 13, after being used in a TV commercial for Levi's starring Brad Pitt. A version of the song by British rockabilly band The Big Six was used in The Truman Show in 1998. The song was also used in the opening of the 2016 film The Purge: Election Year, it also is the name of Magent Magent's Stand in Steel Ball Run, seventh part of the manga ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure by Hirohiko Araki, and it is the namesake of the manga series 20th Century Boys by Naoki Urasawa.\nTrack listing\n# \"20th Century Boy\" -\n# \"Free Angel\" -\nCharts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1973)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|Australia (Kent Music Report)\n|align=\"center\"|57\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|Spain (AFE)\n|align=\"center\"|28\n|-\n|-\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1991–1992)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|Denmark (IFPI)\n|align=\"center\"|5\n|-\n|Finland (Suomen virallinen lista)\n|align=\"center\"|13\n|-\n|-\n|Luxembourg (Radio Luxembourg)\n|align=\"center\"|5\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|UK Airplay (Music Week)\n|align=\"center\"|12\n|}\nCertifications\nCovers and renditions\nGirlschool version\nIn 1983, British rock band Girlschool recorded the song for their fourth studio album, Play Dirty'', and it was released by Bronze Records as the album's lead single in October 1983.
