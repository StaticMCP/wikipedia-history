From left to right: Yzma, Kronk, Kuzco (in llama form), and Pacha.]]\nThe following are fictional characters from Disney's 2000 animated film ''The Emperor's New Groove, its direct-to-video sequel Kronk's New Groove, and the spin-off television series The Emperor's New School.\nKuzco\nKuzco ( ; voiced primarily by David Spade; J. P. Manoux in spinoff media) is the 18-year-old emperor of the Incas. His name is a reference to the ancient city Cusco. He is also the main protagonist of the franchise.\nKuzco is initially portrayed as an arrogant, callous and spoiled narcissist, but has a sense of charm and style. In ''The Emperor's New Groove, Kuzco is turned into a llama by Yzma, who intends to poison him to claim the throne for herself. He is presumed dead and lost in the jungle. Kuzco teams up with Pacha, a llama herder, who helps Kuzco turn back into a human again, regaining his dignity and his throne.\nKuzco has occasionally appeared in Adventureland at Disney theme parks. He also featured in the television series House of Mouse and its direct-to-video film adaptation, Mickey's Magical Christmas.\nPacha\nPacha ( ; voiced primarily by John Goodman; Fred Tatasciore in the first season of The Emperor's New School'') is a farmer residing in the countryside of the Incas. He was a character added during the production process that completely revamped the story.  The original role to assist emperor-turned-llama Kuzco was to be female, and a potential love interest for the discourteous teen. The major overhaul of story made the film a buddy film, with Pacha and Kuzco having to work through the adventure together. His name is possibly a reference to Incan emperor Pachacuti and means \"earth\" in Quechua.\nPacha is a friendly peasant and family man, and a subject in Kuzco's kingdom. His courage, reliability, and value of both friendship and family helps Kuzco change into a genial and mature young man. Pacha is married to Chicha, who is pregnant with Yupi when first seen. During the time of the first film, they have two children: their daughter, Chaca, and their younger son Tipo. Yupi is born during the film's events and appears in spin-off material.\nYzma\nYzma ( ; voiced initially by Eartha Kitt) is Kuzco's primary parental guardian and advisor, and the main antagonist of the franchise. She is a conniving and power-hungry woman who wields potions that enable her to transform others into animals and continues to pursue vengeance against Kuzco while he grows into a wiser ruler.\nIn the first film, Yzma formulates a complicated plan to kill Kuzco before deciding to simply poison him. The concept of her formulating a nonsensical plan before settling on an easier-to-pull-off idea (always a potion) would later be used as a running gag in ''The Emperor's New School.\nIn the television series House of Mouse, Yzma makes a brief cameo appearance in the episode \"Pluto vs. Figaro\".\nYzma was one of the villains in the show Villains Tonight!'' for Disney Cruise Line's Disney Magic and Disney Dream.\nIn the Descendants franchise, she has a daughter named Yzla who appears in the Isle of the Lost novel series. In the animated short series Descendants: Wicked World, she has a son named Zevon (voiced by Bradley Steven Perry), who acts as the main antagonist in the series' second season.\nKronk\n'Kronk Pepikrankenitz' (voiced by Patrick Warburton) is the muscular and slow-witted henchman of Yzma. While he is the secondary antagonist of the franchise, he primarily serves as comic relief. Whenever he faces a moral dilemma, smaller versions of Kronk, his shoulder angel and devil, appear, but they usually fight one another instead of helping him.\nKronk stars in the spinoff film ''Kronk's New Groove'', where he is the head chef and owner of the restaurant Mudka's. His love interest, Birdwell, and his father, Papi (voiced by John Mahoney), are introduced.\nIn ''The Emperor's New School'', Kronk plays the role of Yzma's sidekick although he also has a friendly relationship with Kuzco, sometimes ending up helping him, being also his classmate at Kuzco Academy. As a running gag, he can never remember that Principal Amzy is really Yzma. Another running gag revolves around Kronk attempting to activate access to the secret lab, as originated from the original film with the secret lab's access procedure: more often than not, he constantly pulls the wrong one, and as a result, Yzma constantly gets booby-trapped before fixing the error. At the series' finale, Kuzco appoints Kronk as his new advisor, while Yzma is made Kronk's assistant.\nOther characters introduced in the films\n;Introduced in ''The Emperor's New Groove''\n*Pacha's family, which includes:\n**Chicha (voiced by Wendie Malick) is Pacha's wife.
