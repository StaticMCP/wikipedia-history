Kingsburgh is also often regarded  as being part of the Greater Amanzimtoti area considering that they share the same postal code.\nHistory\nOriginally known as Southern Umlazi, it became a township in October 1942 and reached borough status in August 1952. Probably named after Richard Philip (Dick) King (1811-1871) who rode along here from Durban to Grahamstown on horseback to secure assistance for beleaguered British troops in 1842.\nGeography\nLocation\nSituated on the Sapphire Coast, approximately 26 kilometres (16 mi) north-east of Scottburgh and 32 kilometres (20 mi) south-east of Durban, Kingsburgh is bounded by Amanzimtoti to the north, Umgababa to the south and the Indian Ocean coastline to the east.\nSuburbs\nBisected by the N2 freeway, Kingsburgh  comprises the coastal resorts of Doonside, Warner Beach, Winklespruit and Illovo Beach on the seaward side of the N2 and the hilly suburbs of Doonheights, Shulton Park, Illovo Glen, St Winifred’s and Astra Park on the inward side of the N2.\nEconomy\nTourism\nThe economy of Kingsburgh is heavily reliant on tourism and hospitality in the form of hotels and holiday accommodation that dot the coastline. Hospitality establishments of note include The View Boutique Hotel & Spa and ZAR Hotel, both in Doonside, the ATKV Natalia Resort and the Villa Spa Holiday Resort, both in Illovo Beach and Protea Hotel Karridene Beach in Karridene.\nRetail\nWinklespruit offers two primary shopping hubs for Kingsburgh residents — Kingsburgh Centre and DSM Mall — both conveniently located along Winklespruit Road. For a broader retail selection, most people travel to nearby Amanzimtoti, which hosts larger centres like Galleria Mall and Arbour Crossing.\nAfter a lengthy wait due to development approvals and community objections, construction has finally begun on Kingsburgh Junction, a new shopping centre in Doonside. Originally announced in March 2021 with an expected completion date of November 2023, it is now expected to open on 26 March 2026. Developed by AJ Property Holdings, Kingsburgh Junction will be located at the corner of Seadoone Road and Umfuleni Road, directly opposite the N2/Seadoone Road interchange.\nTransport\nRail\nKingsburgh is served by the South Coast railway line, connecting its five railway stations; Doonside, Warner Beach, Winklespruit, Illovo Beach and Karridene.  The South Coast service operated by Metrorail runs northwards to Durban via Amanzimtoti and southwards to Kelso via Umgababa.\nRoad\nKingsburgh is intersected by the major N2 freeway running between Durban in the north-east and Port Shepstone in the south-west.\nOther key arterial routes intersecting Kingsburgh include:\n* R102 (Andrew Zondo Road; Winklespruit Road) – connects eManzimtoti to the north with Umgababa and eMkhomazi to the south\n* R603 (Sbu Mkhize Drive) – connects Kingsburgh with Umbumbulu to the north-west and is often utilised as an alternative route to the N3 for travel between the South Coast and Pietermaritzburg.\nReferences"
