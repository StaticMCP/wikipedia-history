The war ended with a decisive Ottoman victory.\nDriven partly by the rapid expansion of Russia along the Caspian coast, the Ottoman Empire entered Iran in 1723. In 1724 the Ottomans concluded a treaty with Russia partitioning Iran’s western and northern regions. After a series of uninterrupted victories, the Ottomans advanced through the Caucasus and western Iran, approaching within 40 km of Qazvin, and secured their territorial gains through the Treaty of Hamadan in 1727.\nBackground\nFollowing the Treaty of Karlowitz (1699), the Ottoman Empire experienced its first major territorial losses in the West. Although later victories against Russia (1711–1713) and Venice (1715–1718) helped recover some territories, the defeat against the Holy Roman Empire forced the Ottomans to sign the Treaty of Passarowitz (1718), resulting in further losses. Afterward, the empire entered the so-called Tulip Era, a relatively peaceful period lasting until 1730.\nMeanwhile, the Safavid Empire, which had ruled Iran since 1502, was in decline. Baluch tribes raided Kerman, the Afghan Hotaks attacked Khorasan, and the Lezgins ravaged Shirvan and Dagestan. The Safavid attempt to impose Shi‘ism on the Afghan population of Kandahar sparked a rebellion led by Mir Wais. After killing the Georgian governor Gurgin Khan in 1709, the Afghans advanced westward, defeating the Safavids at the Battle of Gulnabad (1722) and capturing Isfahan on 23 October 1722. Shah Sultan Husayn abdicated, while his son Tahmasp fled to Qazvin and proclaimed himself Shah.\nRussian advance\nAfter ending the Great Northern War in 1721 with the Treaty of Nystad, Russia turned southward. A new treaty with the Ottomans in 1721 secured peace. In 1722 Peter the Great launched an invasion of Iran, occupying Makhachkala, Tarki, Derbent, Rasht (March 1723), and Baku (July 1723).\nThe Ottomans, concerned by Russia’s rapid advance, debated intervention. Envoys from Sunni-majority northern Shirvan requested Ottoman protection; their petition was accepted in late 1722. Rising tensions subsided only when Russia assured the Ottomans it would not cross south of the Caucasus.\nIn January 1723, the Ottoman envoy Osman Agha presented demands to Afghan ruler Mahmud but was rejected, prompting the Ottoman decision to invade Iran.\nThe War\nOttoman entry into Georgia (1723)\nOttoman forces aided Georgian ruler Vakhtang VI, who opposed the Safavid appointee Muhammad Quli Khan. Administratively, Kartli was granted as an ocaklık (hereditary governorship) to Vakhtang’s son Ibrahim. Tbilisi fell to the Ottomans on 23 June.\nCapture of Ganja and Somkhiti (1723)\nOttoman armies continued their advance, capturing Ganja and reorganizing Somkhiti under Ottoman administration.\nDiplomatic maneuvering between Safavids, Russia, and the Ottomans\nRusso–Safavid Treaty (1723)\nOn 23 September 1723, Safavid Iran ceded Derbent, Baku, Shirvan, Gilan, Mazandaran, and Astarabad to Russia. In exchange, Russia promised (though was unable) to help Tahmasp II regain the throne from the Afghans.\nSafavid efforts for peace with the Ottomans\nTahmasp sent envoys to Istanbul, but the Ottomans—angered by the Russo–Iranian treaty—refused negotiations unless Iran ceded territories equivalent to those given to Russia. When this was rejected, the Ottoman advance continued.\nOttoman–Russian Partition Treaty (1724)\nAfter prolonged negotiations mediated by the French ambassador, the Treaty of Istanbul (24 July 1724) partitioned northern and western Iran. Russia acknowledged Ottoman suzerainty over Shirvan, while the Ottomans recognized Russia’s authority over Tahmasp II in its sphere.\nOttoman offensives (1723–1725)\nCapture of Kermanshah and Luristan\nBaghdad governor Hasan Pasha seized Kermanshah, defeated Ali Mardan at Aleşter, and brought Luristan under Ottoman rule.\nSiege of Khoy (1724)\nKhoy fell after heavy fighting on 10 April (city) and 12 May (fortress).\nSiege of Hamadan (1724)\nAhmed Pasha captured Hamadan on 1 September, followed by Dercezin, Samin, and Ashtaneh.\nSiege of Erivan (1724)\nAfter the victory at the Battle of Akçakal, Ottoman forces besieged and captured Erivan: the city on 7 July and the fortress on 28 September.\nSiege of Tabriz (1724–1725)\nThe Ottomans attempted to seize Tabriz twice, with the second attempt in July–August 1725 succeeding after heavy combat.\nOttoman gains in Lori, Ganja, Luristan, Ardabil\nGanja and Lori were annexed, while Ardabil submitted peacefully on the condition that Safi al-Din’s shrine remain untouched.\nHotak diplomacy and renewed conflict (1725–1726)\nAshraf Khan sent an embassy to Istanbul, demanding Ottoman withdrawal, but these demands were rejected. War resumed in 1726.\nOttoman victories (1726)\nOttoman forces won at Arpaçay, Naka, Ordubad, and in Shirvan.\nHotak victory at Anjedan\nAt Anjedan (20 November), the Ottoman army was defeated when Kurdish cavalry refused to fight another Sunni force.\nPeace Negotiations — Treaty of Hamadan (1727)\nExhausted and threatened by both Ottomans and Safavid loyalists, the Hotaks sought peace. Negotiations began on 23 September 1727, and a 12-article treaty was signed on 4 October.\nKey terms:\n* Hotaks recognized Ottoman gains since 1723 in the Caucasus and western Iran.\n* Ottomans recognized Ashraf Khan’s royal title.\n* Both sides pledged to protect pilgrimage routes.\n* Each side was permitted to station a qadi (judge) for commercial matters in the other’s capital.\n* Hotaks surrendered Zanjan, Sultaniyeh, and Abhar.\n* A joint border commission was established.\nAftermath\nThe Ottoman victory was one of the few major successes of the so-called Ottoman “Era of Decline” (1683–1792). However, the Treaty of Hamadan proved short-lived. Nader Shah rose to power, expelled the Hotaks in 1729, restored the Safavids under Tahmasp II, and in 1730 initiated new campaigns against the Ottomans, sparking another prolonged conflict.\nNader Shah's sudden offensive and the Ottoman setbacks contributed directly to unrest in Istanbul, culminating in the Patrona Halil uprising of 1730, which ended the Tulip Era.\nReferences\n* Uzunçarşılı, İsmail Hakkı.
