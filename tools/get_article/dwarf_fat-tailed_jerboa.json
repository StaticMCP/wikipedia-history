It is found in China, Iran, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and Russia. They mostly reside in desert environments which can explain their size. They go long periods of time without food and water, which means they need a lower metabolic rate, and can be a reason for their size.\nReferences\n*\n*\n\n---\n\n## Dwarf Fat-tailed Jerboa\n\n#REDIRECT Dwarf fat-tailed jerboa"
