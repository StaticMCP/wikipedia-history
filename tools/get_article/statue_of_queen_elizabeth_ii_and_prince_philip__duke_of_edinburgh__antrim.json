It was sculpted by Anto Brennan.\nIt is sculpted in bronze and depicts Queen Elizabeth II with her consort, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and two of their Welsh Corgi dogs. The queen's relationship with corgis was renowned.\nThe statue was proposed in January 2023. It was unveiled on 6 September 2024 in a ceremony attended by David McCorkell, Lord Lieutenant of Antrim, and Paul Dunlop, the Deputy Mayor of Antrim and Newtownabbey. Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council wrote that the statue \"captures Her Majesty in a dignified pose, reflecting her grace, steadfastness and lifelong dedication to public service\".\nSince its unveiling, the statue has been critically poorly received and has attracted disparaging remarks regarding the likeness of the two figures to their subjects.\nReferences"
