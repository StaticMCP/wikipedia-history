After the band's breakthrough in 1988 with the release of \"I Want Your Love\", \"Revolution Baby\" was subsequently reissued in September of that year, this time reaching #30 in the UK and #24 in Australia. The sleeve design differed radically between the 1987 and 1988 issues as did the track listings.\nCritical reception\nUpon release, Chris Twomey of British magazine Record Mirror reviewed the single positively and called it \"sugar rock in the best bubblegum tradition\". He wrote: \"More glam than Bolan, sexier than Westworld, and only S S Sputnik surpass them in the tacky imagery league. Transvision Vamp should be good for one hit, at least.\"\nTrack listing\n;7\" vinyl (1987) (TVV 1)\n#\"Revolution Baby\" – 4:00\n#\"Vid Kid Vamp\" – 2:58\n;12\" vinyl (1987) (TVVT 1)\n#\"Revolution Baby\" (Electra-Glide Mix) – 6:02\n#\"No It U Lover\" – 3:06\n#\"Vid Kid Vamp\" – 2:58\n;7\" vinyl (1988) (TVV 4 / TVVPR 4)\n#\"Revolution Baby\" – 4:00\n#\"Honey Honey\" (Dave Parsons) – 2:37\n#\"Long Lonely Weekend\" (Anthony Doughty) – 3:34\n*A limited edition poster sleeve 7\" was also released (TVVPR 4).\n;12\" vinyl (1988) (TVVT 4 / TVVTP 4)\n#\"Revolution Baby\" (Electra-Glide Mix) – 6:02\n#\"Honey Honey\" – 2:37\n#\"Long Lonely Weekend\" – 3:34\n*A limited edition 12\" picture disc was also released (TVVTP 4).\n;CD single (1988) (DTVV 4)\n#\"Revolution Baby\" (Electra-Glide Mix) – 6:02\n#\"Honey Honey\" – 2:37\n#\"Vid Kid Vamp\" – 3:02 *\n#\"Long Lonely Weekend\" – 3:34\n** \"Vid Kid Vamp\" was remixed from the original b-side version.\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Chart performance for \"Revolution Baby\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (1988)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia (ARIA)\n|align=\"center\"|24\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ)\n|align=\"center\"|37\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (OCC)\n|align=\"center\"|30\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.itm-ed.de/tvamp/music/discography/revolutionbaby.html Worldwide releases]"
