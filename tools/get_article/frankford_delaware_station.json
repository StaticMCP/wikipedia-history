The station serves the area surrounding Rivers Casino Philadelphia.\nThe loop opened in 2012 to serve then-SEPTA Route 15 trolleys. In that same year, Route 15 was redirected to this loop, due to the reconstruction of Interstate 95 (I-95) near Richmond Street. The I-95 reconstruction project caused the trolleys to be redirected to Frankord–Delaware station, while service to Richmond–Westmoreland station was replaced with buses. From 2020 until 2024, the whole of then-SEPTA Route 15 ran with buses, due to the SEPTA PCC IIs needing refurbishment. On June 16, 2024, eight newly-refurbished SEPTA PCC III cars, alongside buses, returned to service on the whole of Route 15.\nGallery\nFile:NorthernLibertiesLoop.jpg|The Northern Liberties Loop\nFile:SugarHouse casino.jpg|Rivers Casino Philadelphia is visible from the Frankford and Delaware Avenue station\nFile:FrankfordDelaware.jpg|Close up of the trolley station\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.septa.org/schedules/G1?startStop=31347&direction=1&date=2024-06-19 Frankford Av & Delaware Av Loop]"
