The temple is on the bank of the Tons River, built on top of a natural cave, which holds the temple's main shivalinga.\nHistory\nThe Tapkeshwar Temple is believed to be 6,000 years old. It has a natural shivalinga in the cave, which became a place of reverence for the local people.\nIt is also believed that this was used as a residence by Dronacharya, the teacher of the Pandavas and Kauravas in the Hindu epic Mahabharata; the cave is called Drona Cave after him. Dronacharya's wife Kalyani was unable to breastfeed their newborn son Ashwatthama. As Dronacharya was unable to afford a cow or cow's milk, Ashwatthama prayed to Shiva, who then fed him milk dripping from the shivalinga in the cave.\nOperations\nThe temple is popular as both a tourist destination and a pilgrimage site in Dehradun. Pilgrims bathe in the nearby sulphur-water springs before entering the temple.\nDrona Cave, surrounded by hills, is a popular site for picnickers from Dehradun and nearby districts.\nEvents\nEvery year during Mahashivratri, a fair is held in Tapkeshwar Mahadev temple for over a week.
