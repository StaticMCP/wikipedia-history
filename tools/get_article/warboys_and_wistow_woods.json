Wistow Wood is an  nature reserve owned and managed by the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire.\nThese woods have high conservation value because they are ancient ash and maple, and this habitat has sharply declined in extent since 1945. The woods have diverse flora and fauna, particularly invertebrates.\nThere is access to Wistow Wood from Wistow Fen Lane, but Warboys Wood is private land with no public access.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
