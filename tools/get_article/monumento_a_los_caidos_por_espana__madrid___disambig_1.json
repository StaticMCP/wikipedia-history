It lies on the centre of the .\nHistory and description\nIt is located at the Plaza de la Lealtad, between the Madrid Stock Exchange Building and the Ritz Hotel, next to the Paseo del Prado.\nStanding close to 30 metres high, the monument is built on the place where General Joachim Murat ordered the execution of numerous Spaniards after the Dos de Mayo Uprising of 1808. After various attempts to create a memorial as an homage to the participants of the uprising, the inauguration of the monument took place on May 2, 1840, the anniversary of the event. On November 22, 1985, King Juan Carlos I re-inaugurated the monument as a memorial to all those who gave their life for Spain, including those who died in conflicts other than the Peninsular War. Since then, a flame fueled by gas has been constantly burning on the front of the monument. This parallels other war memorials around the world of national symbolic importance, such as the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.\nReferences"
