Now a museum, it is also known as the Goulburn Rail Workshop and Goulburn Roundhouse. The workshops were added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The workshops were saved from demolition by the Goulburn Locomotive Roundhouse Preservation Society and is now a museum open to the public with large collection of rolling stock and various exhibits, as well as privately owned locomotives and carriages with some commercial repair work happening on site.\nHistory\nFollowing the completion of the first railway from Sydney to Parramatta Junction in 1855, proposals for the first railways to the rest of NSW included a line to the inland centre of Goulburn. A single line from Marulan to Goulburn opened on 27 May 1869.\nA depot was built by the New South Wales Government Railways on the southern outskirts of the town when the line from Sydney was opened to Goulburn in May 1869. In 1918, a 42 road roundhouse opened.\nAssociated railway structures at Goulburn included the goods shed (1868), carriage shed (1869), engine shed (1869), a coal stage, water pump, turntable, and the station master’s residence (1870).\nThe roundhouse was constructed of brick and corrugated iron in 1918 around a  electric-powered turntable.\nThe locomotive depot closed in July 1986 with its allocation of locomotives transferred to Junee Locomotive Depot, but remained as a stabling and refueling point for a few years. Goulburn City Council took out a lease on the roundhouse hoping to establish a national rail museum.\nThe Goulburn Roundhouse Museum became home to several preserved locomotives with the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum transferring 2419 from Thirlmere in August 1989.\nIn 1980, a wagon building and maintenance facility was constructed to the north of the roundhouse. In July 2006 this was transferred to UGL Rail. Following UGL Rail deciding to close the workshop in June 2010, in September 2010 Chicago Freight Car Leasing Australia signed a ten-year lease for the site to maintain both its locomotive and wagon fleets. As well as maintaining its own fleet, Chicago Freight Car Leasing Australia also perform maintenance for other operators including Aurizon.\nMuseum exhibits\nThe Museum has a collection of railway locomotives, carriages, wagons and other railway equipment including:\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n! colspan=\"8\" bgcolor=\"#ffb300\" |Steam Locomotives\n|-\n!No\n!Description\n!Manufacturer\n!Year\n!Location\n!Status\n!Ref\n|- style=\"background:#E5E5FF\"\n|1072\n|70T accident crane\n|Craven Brothers\n|1929\n|Goulburn\n|stored – out of service\n|\n|-\n|1076\n|0-6-0T Tank Engine\n|Vulcan Foundry\n|1884\n|Goulburn\n|operational\n|(formerly 1804)\n|- style=\"background:#E5E5FF\"\n|2419\n|2-6-0 goods\n|Dübs and Company\n|1891\n|Goulburn\n|static exhibit\n|[http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=4807217 Locomotive, Steam 2419]\n|-\n|3085\n|4-6-4T passenger\n|Eveleigh Railway Workshops\n|1912\n|Goulburn\n|static exhibit\n|[http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=4807221 NSW  Locomotive, Steam 3085]\n|- style=\"background:#E5E5FF\"\n|5908\n|2-8-2 goods\n|Baldwin Locomotive Works\n|1952\n|Goulburn\n|static exhibit\n|[http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=4807236 Locomotive, Steam 5908]\n|- style=\"background:#E5E5FF\"\n|5916\n|2-8-2 goods\n|Baldwin Locomotive Works\n|1952\n|Goulburn\n|static exhibit\n|\n|-\n|}\nOther Locomotives\n* 48 Class diesel locomotive 4821 (operational)\n* General Electric Bo-Bo L80T diesel locomotive D1 (under restoration)\n* Clyde Engineering Co-Co GM12 Class  diesel locomotive GM19 (owned by RailPower)\n* Beyer, Peacock & Co 4-6-0 C32 class steam locomotive 3237 (Operational, owned by Lachlan Valley Railway)\nGallery\nFile:Goulburn Roundhouse Museum Locomotive 4821.jpg|Locomotive 4821\nFile:Goulburn Roundhouse Museum Wheel Lathe.jpg|Wheel Lathe\nFile:Goulburn Roundhouse Museum NSWGR Locomotive 3085.jpg|Locomotive 3085\nFile:Goulburn Roundhouse Museum Signalling Display.jpg|Signalling Display\nFile:Goulburn Roundhouse Museum General Electric Bo-Bo L80T diesel locomotive D1.jpg|General Electric Bo-Bo L80T\nFile:Goulburn Roundhouse Museum Telegraphy.jpg|Telegraphy\nFile:Goulburn Roundhouse Museum Breakdown Crane 1072.jpg|Breakdown Crane 1072\nFile:Goulburn Roundhouse Museum Carriages.jpg|Carriages\nFile:Goulburn Roundhouse Museum Entrance.jpg|Entrance\nFile:Goulburn Roundhouse Museum Carriage under restoration.jpg|Carriage under restoration\nFile:601 - Railway Workshops (former) - PCO Plan Number 601 (5045001p1).jpg|Heritage boundaries\nReferences"
