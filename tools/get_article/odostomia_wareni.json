The sculpture of the surface is smooth and shiny. The outer lip is thin. There is no umbilicus. The columellar tooth is weak and is deeply seated inside the pyriform aperture.\nThe species was discovered and named by Christoffer Schanderin in  honour of Irish conchologist Amy Warren in 1994.\nDistribution\nThis species occurs in the Atlantic Ocean in the following locations:\n* Cape Verdes\n* Ghana\n* São Tomé and Principe Archipelagos\n* Senegal\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.eol.org/pages/10294304 Encyclopedia of Life]\n*"
