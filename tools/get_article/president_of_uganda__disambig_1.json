The president leads the executive branch of the government of Uganda and is the commander-in-chief of the Uganda People's Defence Force.\nBackground\nThe office of the president of Uganda was formed on 9th October 1963 to replace the queen of Uganda (which was last held by Elizabeth II) as head of state. It was entirely a ceremonial role i.e without executive powers during the time of the first holder Mutesa II of Buganda until the end of the Mengo Crisis in 1967 when Milton Obote took over ending the alliance between the Uganda People’s Congress and the Kabaka Yekka parties combining the roles of prime minister and president and therefore creating the first president of Uganda with executive powers.\nThe office has been held by 9 people, 8 of whom (besides Edward Muteesa) came into power through military coups and civil war.\nThe incumbent Yoweri Museveni came to power in 1986 and is the longest serving president of Uganda, ahead of Idi Amin who ruled from 1971 to 1979.\nQualifications\nIn 2005 presidential term limits were removed, and in 2017, the previous upper age limit of 75 was also removed.\nUnder Article 102 of the Constitution, in order to be allowed to run for the presidency one must be a citizen of Uganda by birth, be no younger than thirty-five and eligible to be a member of Parliament.\nState House\nState House is the official residence of the president of Uganda. The main State House was constructed in 1925 during the governorship of Sir Geoffrey Archer at Entebbe the then capital to serve as the official viceregal residence (Government House) of the Governor of Uganda. After the country gained independence in 1962, the residence continued to be the official residence of the president of the Republic of Uganda. However, it was first inhabited by Sir William Frederick Gowers, while the second State House is at Nakasero.\nSee also\n*List of heads of state of Uganda\n*Vice President of Uganda\n*Prime Minister of Uganda\n*Politics of Uganda\n*History of Uganda\n*List of political parties in Uganda\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.statehouse.go.ug/ State House of the Republic of Uganda] official site\n*[http://www.ugpulse.com/search.asp?ugaSrch=uganda+elections Uganda Elections 2006: Coverage on UGPulse]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20041021031648/http://www.cwm-uganda.org/uganda/rulers.htm Uganda's Rulers Past and Present], Children's Welfare Mission, Uganda\n*[https://www.youtube.com/tomska More about Uganda's current President] Youtube's Channel"
