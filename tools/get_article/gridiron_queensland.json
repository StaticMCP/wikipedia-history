There are currently nine teams registered in the men's GQ League and six teams in the women's league. GQ also supports the North Queensland Gridiron League consisting of 4 teams across Townsville, Mackay, Cairns and Rockhampton.\nIn the end of the season (late November or early December), the Sunbowl takes place where finalists of each division faceoff to win the championship.\nAfter the season, players across the league are selected to form the Queensland Sundevils teams which plays in the National championships. Both the men's and women's Sundevils are current undefeated national champions having won their respective national championships in early 2014.\nFemale Gridiron League\nThe Female Gridiron League of Queensland (FGLQ), the first league of its kind in Australia, is a full kit, women's tackle American nine-a-side football competition that commenced on 24 August 2012. The FGLQ was founded by the Logan City Gridiron Football Club and is sanctioned by Gridiron Queensland. Three teams participated in the first season in 2012, the Logan City Jets, Kenmore Panthers and Gold Coast Sea Wolves. The first officially sanctioned game of women's gridiron was played between the Kenmore Panthers and Gold Coast Sea Wolves on 24 August 2012 at Logan Metro Sports, Browns Plains, Queensland. The Logan City Jets defeated the Kenmore Panthers 38-20 in the Summerbowl I championship game played on 2 November 2012. On 23 March 2013 the Female Gridiron League of Queensland Allstars, a team consisting of players who played in the 2012 FGLQ season, toured to Croydon, Melbourne to play the Western Foxes the first women's American Football team in Victoria. The FGLQ Allstars won the game 28-14.   Four teams participated in the 2013 FGLQ season which commenced on 6 September 2013; Logan City Jets, Kenmore Panthers, Gold Coast Stingrays (formally Sea Wolves) and new team the Western Jaguars.  Following on from the pioneering efforts of the FGLQ other states across Australia established women's gridiron leagues including Gridiron NSW in 2013, Gridiron Victoria in 2013 and ACT Gridiron in 2014.\nIn 2014 Gridiron Queensland took over the administration of women's gridiron in Queensland. The first ever Women's national championship of American football contested between QLD, NSW and ACT was held in early 2014 and players who played season II of the Female Gridiron League of Queensland (FGLQ) were eligible to be selected for the first ever Queensland SunDevils women's team.  The SunDevils were undefeated champions defeating ACT 14-6 in a hard-fought final. Most Valuable Player for the national championship was Queensland player Kristy Moran.\nMen's League members\n*Bayside Ravens\n*Logan City Bears\n*Gold Coast Stingrays\n*Brisbane Rhinos\n*Sunshine Coast Spartans\n*Moreton Bay Raptors\n*Townsville Cyclones\n*Cairns Falcons\n*Mackay Mavericks\n*South Brisbane Saints\n*Rockhampton Wolverines\nWomen's League members\n*Logan City Jets\n*Kenmore Panthers\n*Gold Coast Stingrays\n*Western Jaguars\n*Southern Steelers\n*Moreton Bay Raptors\n*Griffith University Thunder\n*Bayside Ravens\nPrevious Sunbowl champions\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-   valign=\"bottom\"\n!
