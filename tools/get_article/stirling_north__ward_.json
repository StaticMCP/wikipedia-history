Originally known as Castle from its creation in 2007, it returned three councillors and covered northern parts of the small city of Stirling, including Causewayhead, Cornton, Raploch and the town centre, as well as Stirling Castle from which the name derived. A 2017 national boundary review saw the ward become larger; this new territory consisted largely of an uninhabited area on the western slopes of the Ochil Hills and a rural area south of Blairlogie, but also incorporating the Cambuskenneth and Riverside neighbourhoods, with an increase in the electorate and an additional seat. It was also re-named at that time to the more descriptive Stirling North title. In 2019, the ward had a population of 15,885.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=4|Jim Thompson(SNP)\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|John Hendry(Labour)\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Graham Reed(Liberal Democrats)\n!colspan=2; rowspan=2|3 seats\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Johanna Boyd(Labour)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=2|Danny Gibson(Labour)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Susan McGill(SNP)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Ross Oxburgh(Conservative)\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1|Rachel Nunn(Conservative)\n|}\nElection results\n2017 election\n2017 Stirling Council election\n|numcounts  = 8\n}}\n2012 election\n2012 Stirling Council election\n2007 election\n2007 Stirling Council election\nReferences"
