It experiences a fairly mild climate subsequently drawing many animals for summer breeding.\nIn the summer, the station supports up to 68 people, including scientists and staff from the Korea Polar Research Institute and guest scientists from other institutions as well. Over winter, it accommodates only 22 engineers and scientists who maintain the station and routinely collect data (meteorological records, oceanographical parameters, etc.), but their main focus is on tracking the general change of the natural environment. Researchers from Korea continually collaborate with various other institutes in Antarctica and the rest of the world by participating in, monitoring, and contributing to the World Meteorological Organization, the Global Sea-level Observing System, the International Seismological Center, and the Intermagnet Project.\nThe station is usually re-supplied yearly by the RV Onnuri and more frequently by planes flying from Jubany in Argentina and the Chilean Eduardo Frei Base.\nThe RV Araon was commissioned in 2009, and she supplies South Korea's research stations, including the Jang Bogo Station.\nResearch\nThe primary research that is conducted at the King Sejong Station:\n*Environmental monitoring\n*Geodesy/mapping\n*Geomagnetic observations (since 1989)\n*Glaciology - sea ice zone (since 1998)\n*Ionospheric/auroral observations (since 1989)\n*Lower/upper atmospheric science\n*Meteorological observations\n*Oceanography\n*Offshore marine biology\n*Onshore geology/geophysics\n*Seismology\n*Stratospheric ozone monitoring (since 1998)\n*Terrestrial biology\n*Tide measurement\nIn popular culture\nThe station is used as a basis for the major tournament map King Sejong Station LE in the game StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm.\nSee also\n* List of Antarctic research stations\n* List of Antarctic field camps\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://eng.kopri.re.kr Official website of the Korea Polar Research Institute (KOPRI)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120914201057/http://eng.kopri.re.kr/home_e/contents/e_3110000/view.cms Introduction of the King Sejong Station in the Official website of KOPRI]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080424075823/http://www.comnap.aq/facilities COMNAP Antarctic Facilities]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110220115654/https://www.comnap.aq/publications/maps/comnap_map_edition5_a0_2009-07-24.pdf/view COMNAP Antarctic Facilities Map]"
