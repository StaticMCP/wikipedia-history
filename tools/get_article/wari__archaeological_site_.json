It was the capital city of the Wari Empire and one of the largest urban settlements in ancient Peru.\nHistory\nWari was founded ca. 400 AD and gained prominence around 550 AD. At its height, the city was inhabited by around 70,000 people from different cultures, making it the center of a new religion that synthesized the beliefs of those various peoples. The city was abandoned ca. 1000 AD.\nLayout\nThe archaeological site spans an area of 2000 hectares, and comprises several areas or neighborhoods. Buildings are made of stone and mudbrick, and painted in red and white.
