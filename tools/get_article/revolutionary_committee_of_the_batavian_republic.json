The French army defeated William's army and he fled to Great Britain. Many refugees, who had fled the Netherlands after the Prussian invasion on behalf of prince William V in 1787, could now return. The presidents of the Revolutionary Committee acted as heads of state of the Netherlands (only recognized by France).\nDutch Heads of state in 1795\n17 January 1795 - 6 February 1795\n*Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck\n*Wijbo Fijnje\n*Pieter Paulus"
