From 2001 to 2006 they were led by Mike Peters of the Alarm and Kirk Brandon, of Spear of Destiny, with a varying cast of musicians. Since 2015, they split into two bands, one led by Peters called the Jack Tars, and another led by Brandon keeping the Dead Men Walking name.\nCareer\nThe band started in 2001, with Brandon and Peters being joined by Pete Wylie (Wah!) and Glen Matlock (Sex Pistols) for the first live album.  For the second album, Wylie was replaced by Billy Duffy (the Cult) and a drummer was added in Slim Jim Phantom (Stray Cats).  For the third album, Duffy was replaced by Bruce Watson (Big Country).  For the fourth and fifth albums, Watson dropped out and Matlock was replaced by Captain Sensible (the Damned) on bass.\nThe Peters/Brandon/Sensible/Phantom line-up recorded an original album in 2008, but it was never released as there were disagreements between the band members.\nEventually Peters revived the band in 2014 with Chris Cheney (the Living End) replacing Brandon.  This line-up produced the first album of original material by the band, Easy Piracy, the previous releases having all been live albums.\nBrandon also formed a new version of the band, with Jake Burns (Stiff Little Fingers) and Dave Ruffy and John \"Segs\" Jennings (both of Ruts DC). After a name dispute, Brandon kept the name and Peters renamed his band as the Jack Tars.\nDiscography\nBrandon/Peters line-up\n* Live at Guildford (Resistance 001, 2001)\n* Live at Leeds (Resistance 002, 2003)\n* Live at The Darwen Library Theatre (Resistance 003, 2004) CD\n* Live at The Darwen Library Theatre (Resistance DVD 002, 2004) DVD\n* Live at CBGB New York City (Resistance 004, 2005)\n* Graveyard Smashes Volume 1 (Resistance 005, 2006)\nPeters line-up\n* Easy Piracy (Slimstyle Records THIN0084, 2015)\nBrandon line-up\n* Live in Bristol (2016)\nMembers\nDead Men Walking are now –\n* Kirk Brandon – Spear Of Destiny, Theatre Of Hate\n* Jake Burns – Stiff Little Fingers\n* Dave Ruffy – Ruts DC\n* John \"Segs\" Jennings – Ruts DC\nThe Jack Tars, are now –\n* Mike Peters – The Alarm (singer/rhythm guitar)\n* Chris Cheney – The Living End (lead guitar)\n* Slim Jim Phantom – Stray Cats (drummer)\n* Captain Sensible – The Damned (bass guitar)\nPrevious musicians include\n* Pete Wylie – Wah!\n* Glen Matlock – Sex Pistols\n* Bruce Watson – Big Country\nGuest musicians include\n* Mick Jones - The Clash\n* Topper Headon - The Clash\n* Duff McKagan - Guns N' Roses\n* Derek Forbes - Spear of Destiny, Simple Minds\n* Billy Duffy - Theatre of Hate, The Cult\n* Lemmy - Motörhead\n* Brian Setzer - Stray Cats\n* Pauline Black – The Selecter\n* Fred Armisen - Trenchmouth, Saturday Night Live\n* Mike Scott - The Waterboys\n* Roddy Frame - Aztec Camera\n* Ian McNabb - The Icicle Works\n* Dave Dederer - Presidents of the United States of America\nTimeline\nImageSize   = width:1100 height:auto barincrement:25\nPlotArea    = left:100 bottom:60 top:0 right:50\nAlignbars   = justify\nDateFormat  = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod      = from:01/01/2001 till:19/09/2020\nTimeAxis    = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nColors =\nid:guitar      value:teal    legend:Guitar\nid:guitar2     value:brightgreen      legend:Guitar2\nid:bass        value:blue      legend:Bass\nid:drums       value:orange    legend:Drums\nid:drums2      value:claret    legend:Drums2\nid:album       value:black     legend:Releases\nLegend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom\nScaleMajor = increment:4 start:2001\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2001\nBarData =\nbar:Mike     text:\"Mike_Peters\"\nbar:Kirk     text:\"Kirk_Brandon\"\nbar:Phantom  text:\"Slim_Jim_Phantom\"\nbar:Glen     text:\"Glen_Matlock\"\nbar:Capt     text:\"Captain_Sensible\"\nbar:Pete     text:\"Pete_Wylie\"\nbar:Billy    text:\"Billy_Duffy\"\nbar:Bruce    text:\"Bruce_Watson\"\nbar:Chris    text:\"Chris_Cheney\"\nbar:Jake     text:\"Jake_Burns\"\nbar:Segs     text:\"Segs Jennings\"\nbar:Ruffy    text:\"Dave Ruffy\"\nPlotData=\nwidth:10 textcolor:black Align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4)\nbar:Mike     from:01/01/2001 till:end        color:guitar\nbar:Kirk     from:01/01/2001 till:31/12/2014 color:guitar\nbar:Kirk     from:01/01/2016 till:end        color:guitar2\nbar:Phantom  from:01/01/2003 till:end        color:drums\nbar:Glen     from:01/01/2001 till:31/12/2004 color:bass\nbar:Capt     from:01/01/2005 till:end        color:bass\nbar:Pete     from:01/01/2001 till:31/12/2002 color:guitar\nbar:Billy    from:15/09/2003 till:23/10/2003 color:guitar\nbar:Bruce    from:24/10/2003 till:31/12/2003 color:guitar\nbar:Chris    from:01/01/2015 till:end        color:guitar\nbar:Jake     from:01/01/2016 till:end        color:guitar2\nbar:Ruffy    from:01/01/2016 till:end        color:drums2\nbar:Segs     from:01/01/2016 till:end        color:guitar2\nLineData =\nat:05/08/2001 color:black layer:back\nat:20/07/2003 color:black layer:back\nat:03/11/2003 color:black layer:back\nat:23/09/2005 color:black layer:back\nat:02/10/2006 color:black layer:back\nat:01/07/2015 color:black layer:back\nat:16/06/2016 color:black layer:back\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20030731000000*/http://www.deadmenwalking.co.uk/ Original homepage] (Archives from July 2003-Jan 2007)\n* [http://www.deadmenwalkingband.com/ Official website] (Kirk Brandon's Dead Men Walking)\n* [https://www.facebook.com/thejacktars/ Facebook page] (Mike Peters' The Jack Tars)"
