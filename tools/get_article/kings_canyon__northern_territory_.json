The creek was named by Giles in 1872. He wrote in his book Geographic Travels in Central Australia from 1872 to 1874: \"I called King's Creek after Mr. Fielder King... an old and kind friend of mine\".\nThe Aboriginal (Luritja and Arrernte) name for the creek and canyon is \"Watarrka\" (pronounced what-ARR-kah), which is the Luritja word for the local umbrella bush (Acacia ligulata) that grows in the vicinity. The national park thus gets its name from this landform.\nLocation, access, and description\nKings Canyon is located  southwest of Alice Springs via Larapinta Drive (only accessible by 4WD), or  along the Stuart Highway, Lasseter Highway, and the Red Centre Way, which are all sealed.\nIn 1986, Kings Canyon was listed on the Register of the National Estate, when it was described by the Department of Environment as follows:One of the most spectacular canyons in Central Australia. Kings Canyon contains some 60 rare or relict plant species and a total of 572 different plant species and 80 species of birds. It is a 'living plant museum' and is notable for its stands of cycads & permanent rock pools. There are some well-preserved Aboriginal paintings and engravings in the area...\nThe walls of Kings Canyon are over  high, with Kings Creek at the bottom, with several Aboriginal sacred sites.  Part of the gorge is an Aboriginal sacred site. The Garden of Eden is a permanent waterhole surrounded by plant life, and while visitors are permitted on the walking track, the waterhole is   an important men's sacred place for the traditional owners, with particular Dreaming stories associated with it, so visitors are not allowed to swim in it. There are some distinctive rock formations known as the \"Lost City\".\nWalks\nThere are four short walks for visitors:\n*The  (loop) Kings Canyon Rim Walk traces the top of the canyon and takes three to four hours to complete.  It is graded \"Grade 4 - moderate to difficult\".\n*The  (return) and approximately one-hour Kings Creek Walk traces the bottom of the gorge. (Grade 2 - easy)\n*The  South Wall return takes around two hours to complete. A steep climb at the beginning of the walk takes visitors up to the top, with views of the gorge below. It ends at a one-way gate. Grade 3 - moderate.\n* Kathleen Springs is an easy walk on a sealed track and suitable for wheelchairs. At around , allow around 1.5 hours for the return trip.\nThe  Giles Track connects Kings Canyon to Kathleen Springs, and can be followed in either direction. It is advised to spend a night on the track.\nGeology\nAccording to geologists, the valley was formed more than 400 million years ago. It cuts through a layer of Mereenie Sandstone, which was deposited here 400 million years ago. The sandstone can be viewed in the form of 30-m high cliffs, and as you go deeper, you can witness the softer Carmichael Sandstone, which has been present here for 440 million years. These two layers of sandstone are divided by a thin layer of purple shale or mudstone which depicts the environmental changes between the two formations.\nFlora and fauna\nBirds in the canyon area include the spinifex pigeon, zebra finch, several species of honeyeater, purple-backed fairywren, budgerigar, rufous grasswren, nankeen kestrel, and many more.\nOther animals include:\n* Blistered pyrgomorph\n* Centralian Green Frog\n* Desert tree frog\n* Dingo\n* Long-nosed dragon\n* Perentie\n* Ring-tailed dragon\n* Termites\n* Rock wallaby\nMore than 750 plant species have been recorded in the area, with at least 60 of them unique to the region. They include rare cycads, ferns, eucalyptus, acacia, and desert oaks.\nKings Creek Station\nKings Creek Station was established by Ian and Lyn Conway in 1981. It lies  from Kings Canyon, and offers accommodation and tourist experiences. It was originally run as a cattle station and camel property, and still runs these animals, but tourism is now its main business. The property covers , of which  is freehold, with the remainder being a pastoral lease. Tony McFadzean took over as CEO and co-owner some time after the Conways retired in April 2019.\nPower station\nKings Canyon Power Station is a photovoltaic power station. With a generating capacity of 225  kWp and electricity production of 372,000 kWh of electricity per annum. It was the largest single installation of its kind in Australia when it began operation in December 2003. Kings Canyon Power Station, part of the Territory Generation network, is the only commercial source of electricity in the Kings Canyon area. It provides up to 1.1MW from a combination of solar and diesel generation.\nIn popular culture\nKings Canyon featured in the 1994 film The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert as the rock climbed by the lead characters at the end of their trip of self-discovery.\nReferences\nExternal links"
