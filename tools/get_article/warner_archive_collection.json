It started as a manufactured-on-demand (MOD) DVD series by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment on March 23, 2009, with the intention of putting previously unreleased catalog films on DVD for the first time. In November 2012, Warner expanded the Archive Collection to include Blu-ray releases. Some Warner Archive releases, such as Wise Guys, previously had a pressed DVD release but have lapsed out of print and have since been re-released as part of the Warner Archive collection.\nDVDs are manufactured on-demand for the consumer and authorized distributors for online resale using DVD-R Recordable media rather than the traditional business model of pressing large batches of discs that ship to \"brick and mortar\" retailers. This saves on the costs of storing unsold stock in a warehouse and mitigates the risk of a retailer holding unsold merchandise, especially since the majority of the films in the archive do not have widespread public demand. However, the use of DVD-R Recordable media for manufacturing DVDs on-demand created an opportunity for the sale of counterfeit DVDs, as their quality was much easier to replicate than that of traditional mass-produced discs. Warner Archive claim the discs are indistinguishable in quality from to their mass-produced counterparts.\nIn addition, Warner Archive also sells films and television shows as downloadable Windows Media files, and formerly operated a subscription-based streaming video service, Warner Archive Instant, which allowed members to stream many of the Warner Archive properties in a format similar to Netflix. In 2018, Warner Archive Instant merged with its sister service FilmStruck. The combined FilmStruck / Warner Archive streaming service was discontinued on November 29, 2018, and was replaced by HBO Max.\nCollection and operations\nThe collection consists of theatrical films, television shows, and television films from the libraries of Warner Bros.

Television, post-1970 The Wolper Organization, post-August 1946 Allied Artists Pictures, post-1946 Monogram Pictures, post-November 1984 New Line Cinema and post-1994 Castle Rock Entertainment.\nSony Pictures (including Columbia Pictures titles), Paramount Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Universal Pictures, Walt Disney Studios, and 20th Century Studios also started MOD services after the success of Warner Archive. Their services are named Sony Pictures Choice Collection (formerly Screen Classics By Request), MGM Limited Edition Collection, Universal Vault Series, Disney Generations Collection, and Fox Cinema Archives, respectively. Including Warner, major film studios and including Lionsgate, CBS, MTV, and Nickelodeon also started to offer MOD discs of catalog titles through Amazon CreateSpace. On April 13, 2011, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Group and Sony Pictures Home Entertainment announced that Warner Archive would offer on-demand titles from Sony. MGM Limited Edition titles are also sold through Warner Archive. In 2013, as part of Paramount's agreement with Warner Bros., select Paramount titles were released under the Warner Archive moniker.\nBlu-ray\nThe Archive Collection began releasing titles on Blu-ray in November 2012, with the first two releases being Deathtrap and Gypsy.
