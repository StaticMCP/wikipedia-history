On this day ceremonies are held at the Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Memorial.\nHistory\nIn 1973, July 27 was designated as the Day of Victory in the Great Fatherland Liberation War. Ceremonies such as central plenary meetings (중앙보고대회, also alternatively translated as national meetings) were done in a small scale only in the 5th and 10th anniversaries.\nFrom 1993 to 1998, central plenary meetings were held annually.\nIn 1996, during the 43rd anniversary, the day was promoted to the status of a national holiday, which involved raising the North Korean flag and resting for one day. In 1999, central plenary meetings were omitted. From 2000 to 2002, the ceremonies were reduced in size and was mainly run as a cultural athletic event due to the inter Korean summits. In 2003, the size of the ceremonies increased due to international tensions and nuclear crisis.\nSee also\n*Culture of North Korea\nReferences"
