The Order emerged victorious and managed to liberate the Christian slaves held by the Ottomans.\nBackground\nAfter relocating from Rhodes to Malta, the Knights Hospitaller relied heavily on naval power to disrupt Ottoman shipping in the Mediterranean. Throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, they expanded their fleet from galleys to larger warships such as galleons and ships of the line, enabling more ambitious raids against Ottoman commerce and supply routes.\nBattle\nIn July 1732, Grand Master António Manoel de Vilhena instructed Jacques-François de Chambray to intercept an Ottoman convoy near Damietta. On 16 August 1732, Chambray's squadron encountered the Ottoman convoy, consisting of about 40 merchant ships escorted by the Sultana, a 70-gun ship of the line under the command of Ottoman vice-admiral Kali Michamet.\nChambray's two 60-gun ships of the line, Saint Antoine and Saint George, engaged the Sultana, while the Hospitaller corvettes attacked the merchant vessels. Despite fierce resistance, the Sultana was heavily damaged and dismasted. Kali Michamet initially refused to surrender, but by dawn his situation was untenable and he capitulated.\nAlthough the Ottoman flagship remained afloat, it was set ablaze by the crew of the Saint George, denying Chambray the chance to claim it as a prize. Several merchantmen were captured, though many were empty of valuable cargo. The Knights nevertheless seized cannons, gunpowder, sails, cables, food supplies, and other useful equipment.\nAftermath\nThe Hospitallers took 117 Ottoman prisoners and freed 14 enslaved Christians, who were transported to Malta. The liberated captives underwent quarantine before being reintegrated into Maltese society or into the Order's naval service. Meanwhile, Ottoman captives were sold in Valletta's slave markets for between 200 and 500 écus each.\nThe Knights suffered relatively light losses, 8 killed and 12 wounded. In recognition of his success, Jacques-François de Chambray was promoted to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Malta.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*"
