It was first described in 1873 and is native to the rainforests of eastern Queensland, Australia.\nDescription\nRockinghamia angustifolia is an understorey tree reaching up to  tall with a trunk diameter of up to . The trunk may be fluted or buttressed. Leaves are simple and clustered towards the ends of the branches and are held on petioles (leaf stalk) up to  long. They measure up to  long by  wide and have 7–10 lateral veins. The petiole has a  at either end.\nThe inflorescence is a panicle up to  long and comprises both male and female flowers. The pink or red flowers have sepals about  long but do not have petals. The fruit is a three-lobed, red, pink or green capsule about  long and  wide, containing up to eight roughly spherical seeds about  long.\nTaxonomy\nThis plant was first described in 1873 as Mallotus angustifolius by English botanist George Bentham. In 1966, Herbert Kenneth Airy Shaw reviewed the material on which Bentham's description was based and concluded that it did not belong in the genus Mallotus, and he created the new genus Rockinghamia to accommodate the species.\nEtymology\nThe genus name Rockinghamia is for Rockingham Bay, the area where the type specimen was collected. The species epithet angustifolia is derived from the Latin words angustus, 'narrow', and folium, leaf.\nDistribution and habitat\nRockinghamia angustifolia inhabits rainforest of eastern Queensland, Australia, and occurs in two distinct populations. The northern population extends from about Rossville to Paluma Range National Park, and the southern population is in the area around Eungella National Park west of Mackay. The altitudinal range is from sea level to about .\nEcology\nThe seeds of this species are eaten by Australian king parrots (Alisterus scapularis).\nConservation\n, this species has been assessed to be of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and by the Queensland Government under its Nature Conservation Act.\nGallery\nFile:Rockinghamia angustifolia 285056078.jpg|Trunk\nFile:Rockinghamia-angustifolia-SF25170-04.jpg|Foliage\nFile:Rockinghamia-angustifolia-SF25170-01.jpg|Pseudo-whorled leaves\nFile:Rockinghamia angustifolia 285055556.jpg|Fruit\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n* [https://avh.ala.org.au/occurrences/search?taxa=Rockinghamia+angustifolia#tab_mapView View a map] of herbarium collections of this species at the Australasian Virtual Herbarium\n* [https://inaturalist.ala.org.au/observations?taxon_id=782663 View observations] of this species on iNaturalist\n* [https://flickriver.com/search/Rockinghamia+angustifolia View images] of this species on Flickriver.com"
