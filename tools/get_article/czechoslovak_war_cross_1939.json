It was created and issued not as a general service medal, but as a meritorious decoration for those had provided great service to the Czechoslovak state during the years of World War II. The award was mainly intended for persons who had helped liberate Czechoslovakia from the rule of Nazi Germany. Several American officers received the award, such as Dwight D. Eisenhower or George S. Patton, and the decoration was also bestowed to national heroes, such as the men who had assassinated Reinhard Heydrich in operation Anthropoid.\nThe second Czechoslovak War Cross was known as the Czechoslovak War Cross 1939 and a common phrase for the decoration was also the Czechoslovak Croix de Guerre. In cases where an individual had received both the World War I and World War II versions, both medals could be worn simultaneously.\nThe validity of the War Cross was confirmed after the end of World War II, in January 1946.\nThere were no further versions of the Czechoslovak War Cross after 1945 and the medal became obsolete with the division of the Czechoslovak state in 1992.\nDesign\nThe medal was dye-struck and high in detail, with a bronze finish. On the obverse of the cross there was the lesser coat of arms of Czechoslovakia, on the reverse – symbols of the three historical Czech lands and two other adjoined lands in circles: symbol of Bohemia proper in the middle, Slovakia above, Moravia on the left, Silesia on the right, and Subcarpathian Rus' below. In the spaces around the middle circle, the year 1939 is spread. The medal was suspended from a white ribbon with red and blue stripes.\nNotable recipients\n*Clift Andrus\n*Omar Bradley\n*Aaron Bradshaw Jr.\n*Pierre Brossolette\n*Emil Boček\n*Albert E.
