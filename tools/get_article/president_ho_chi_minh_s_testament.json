In his thousand word testament, Ho Chi Minh extols his countrymen to continue the fight for independence and communist revolution in a unified Vietnam. The testament also provides instructions for the Communist Party of Vietnam to lead the Vietnamese people towards socialism and national liberation. The continues testament is the subject of wide discussion and study in Vietnam, and was central to the development of Ho Chi Minh Thought.\nIn 1965, due to his deteriorating health, Hồ Chí Minh began to write his last testament. The testament underwent multiple drafts and was finally published in 1969.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://archive.org/details/hochiminhtestament President Ho Chi Minh’s Testament]'', a 1995 English translation of the Testament and associated documents published by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam"
