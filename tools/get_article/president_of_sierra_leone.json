In 1971, the parliamentary system was abolished in favor of a presidential system. This adoption of a new constitution made Siaska Stevens the first executive President of Sierra Leone. &nbsp;\nEventually, the APC would become the only recognized political party in the country. In 1978, a new constitution was adopted via referendum. This constitution replaced the multi-party system, instituting a single party state. Additionally, executive powers were increased and the presidential term limits increased from four to seven years. &nbsp;\nIn October 1990, President Momoh appointed a thirty-five member National Constitutional Review Commission. This was in response to the growing opposition of a one-party state. The review commission recommends constitutional changes, providing alternatives to the one-party state. &nbsp;\nList of presidents\nSee also\n*List of colonial governors of Sierra Leone\n*List of heads of state of Sierra Leone\n*List of heads of government of Sierra Leone\nReferences"
