The Shelby Street Bridge had later been renamed the Korean War Veterans of Tennessee Memorial Bridge, and a commemorative plaque was installed. In 1998, the Shelby Street Bridge was closed to traffic. When it was reopened as the John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge in 2003, the memorial plaque had been removed.\nConstruction on the Gateway Bridge began in 2001, and it was completed in 2004. It was built by Ray Bell Construction. In 2006, it was renamed in honor of veterans of the Korean War.\nThe bridge was renovated with light-emitting diodes by Domingo Gonzalez Associates in 2016.\nThe bridge is a prominently featured as part of the Nashville Street Circuit. It is one of the few large bridges to be used on a street circuit anywhere in the world.\nReferences"
