In 308BC, after many delays and misgivings, he attempted to seize the government with the aid of 500 citizens and a number of mercenaries, but his followers were induced to desert him by promises of pardon. He himself was taken and crucified.\nSee also\n* Other Bomilcars in Carthaginian history\n* Melqart, the Canaanite deity\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n* .\n*"
