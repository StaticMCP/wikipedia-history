C. Johnson & Son in September 1935.\nHe flew from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Fortaleza, Ceará, in an amphibious twin-engine Sikorsky S-38.\nHis aim was to learn more about the carnauba palm tree (Copernicia prunifera) of north eastern Brazil which produced wax, one of the main products of his company, and to determine whether groves of these trees could produce enough to meet future demand.\nBy 1937 the company had a carnauba processing factory in Fortaleza, and in 1938 had a research farm, later donated to the school of agronomy of the University of Ceara.\nIn 1960 the company created a Brazilian subsidiary in 1960, and in 1990 launched the environmental project that led to creation of the Serra das Almas Natural Reserve.\nLocation\nThe reserve was created on 8 September 2000 with an area of  of the municipality of Crateús in the state of Ceará.\nAlmost half of the reserve's original Caatinga vegetation had been devastated.\nIt is the property of the Caatinga Association (Associação Caatinga}}).\nThe reserve was gradually expanded through acquisition of adjacent lands.\nIn November 2015 the reserve reached  through the purchase of the Fazenda Gameleira, with  of preserved Caatinga.\nThe reserve now covers parts of the municipalities of Crateús, Ceará and Buriti dos Montes, Piauí.\nConservation\nThe reserve is supported by the Samuel Johnson Fund for Conservation of the Caatinga and the S. C. Johnson company. Through the Caatinga Association it has also received support from partners such as The Nature Conservancy, Petrobras, Fundação O Boticário, Fundo Nacional do Meio Ambiente and FUNBIO.\nThe November 2015 purchase was achieved through the support of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\nThe expansion, with monitoring, will help protect the reserve against indiscriminate hunting and fires.\nThe reserve planned to expand biodiversity monitoring, surveillance and scientific research, and also to expand environmental education and ecotourism.\nThe main threat is illegal hunting of the rich fauna of the reserve.\nThe deer, peccary, armadillo, agouti and rock cavy are under constant threat from hunters.\nThe Saffron finch is much sought after by live bird traffickers.\nOther birds on the endangered list are the Blue-fronted amazon and the guan.\nNotes\nSources\n*\n*\n*|language=Portuguese\n|title=Quem Somos|publisher=Associação Caatinga\n|url=http://www.acaatinga.org.br/index.php/pt-br/quem-somos|accessdate=2016-05-18}}\n*\n*"
