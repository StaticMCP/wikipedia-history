      "text": "# List of English and Welsh endowed schools (19th century)\n\nThis is a list of some of the endowed schools in England and Wales existing in the early part of the 19th century. It is based on the antiquarian Nicholas Carlisle's survey of \"Endowed Grammar Schools\" published in 1818 with descriptions of 475 schools but the comments are referenced also to the work of the Endowed Schools Commission half a century later. Most English and Welsh endowed schools were at the time described as grammar schools, but by the 18th century there were three groups: older prestigious schools becoming known as \"public schools\"; schools in manufacturing towns that innovated to some extent in syllabus; and more traditional grammar schools in market towns and rural areas.\nA medieval grammar school was one which taught Latin, and this remained an important subject in all the schools, which generally followed the traditions of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, from which almost all of their graduate schoolmasters came. Some of the schools listed by Carlisle had long been fee-paying public schools, although in most cases (as at Eton and Winchester) retaining some provision for the teaching of \"scholars\" who paid reduced or no fees.\nAn endowment for educational purpose was intended by the founder or founders to be legally binding in perpetuity. However the object of such endowments was not always fully honoured by those controlling the schools.\nCarlisle compiled his list by means of a questionnaire, which was not always answered. The Commission's report built on his research, while not accepting all his claims on the continuity of certain schools from monastic and chantry foundations, which affected the dating of schools. The chronological list in the report has numerous further details of endowments.\nThere is little consistency in the actual names of grammar schools from this period. Many were called \"free schools\". Carlisle used some unorthodox spellings, and he listed Hampshire under its alternative historical name of Southamptonshire.\nBedfordshire\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Standard name\n!Other names\n!Foundation\n!Status now\n!Comments\n!References\n|-\n| Bedford Grammar School\n| Bedford School\n| 15 August 1552\n| Independent\n| Sir William Harpur Knt, alderman of London, endowed the school in the name of the Commonalty of Bedford, with letters patent granted by King Edward VI. Visitors were elected from the warden and fellows of New College, Oxford. Harpur stood surety of 13 acres and 1 rood of meadow in St Andrew, Holborn for the letters patent. An act of Parliament of 1764 granted 12 acres and a rood on a case decision reserved in chancery to Sir Thomas Fisher, Bt. This land became housing called the Charity Estate. Another act, in 1793, made the town corporation responsible for \"repairing leases\". New College, Oxford controlled the appointment of master and usher.\n|\n|-\n| Houghton Conquest Grammar School\n|\n| 5 June 1632\n| Maintained Lower ('Primary') School\n| Sir Francis Clerke, MA Cantab, was the founder around 1630, when an almshouse and close (6 acres and 4 small closes called the pighties) were conveyed by deed of title.

An endowment of lands valued at £140 was bequeathed in 1691; In 1720 described thus \"here is a publick school endowed...\". Trustees included the Earl of Upper Ossory and the Duke of Bedford. In an account published by the Bedfordshire County Records Archive Office, there is continuity shown between the old endowed school and the current local maintained school, Houghton Conquest Lower School The old school and almshouses were demolished in 1970.\n|\n|}\nBerkshire\nFor Eton College see Buckinghamshire.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Standard name\n!Other names\n!Foundation\n!Status now\n!Comments\n!References\n|-\n|Abingdon Grammar School\n|Roysse's School; Abingdon School\n|1562\n|Independent\n| A benefaction by John Roysse, citizen and mercer of London was to an existing grammar school.

Another teacher, George Bagley, paid for kitchens for the school. In 1855 he was replaced by Alfred Lee Taylor, a Cambridge graduate, who oversaw repairs and maintenance to a dilapidated building. The 32nd Charity Commissioners' report noted it had a school-room and a master's room. The original building appears to have had a Victorian conversion into a shop. It was built of red brick with a Welsh slate roof. The original windows date from the early 19th century. The hipped roofs were in place when it was inspected. The downstairs timbered mullion windows to the right of a stack, to which a door was built during the 20th century. The beams were champfered; above the fireplace was a lozenge dated 1698; the purlins and tie-beam above dated from the same period. Iron cramps were added in 19th century for stability. In 1853, the grammar school was reconstituted with new trustees, prompting Mr Bagley's resignation. Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn became patron, paying for the reconstruction of new buildings in 1858 that now represent the oldest part of the old school. It was the first in Wales to receive funds as a County School in 1894, being overseen by the new Denbighshire County Council. It still functioned like a competitive grammar school, with academic selection and examinations for Oxbridge. Headmaster Rev Bowen broached the idea of a girls' school.
