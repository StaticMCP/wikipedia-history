They play at the Slough Ice Arena, having previously played at the John Nike Leisuresport Complex in Bracknell.\nThe club operates three teams, which compete in various levels of the EIHA's Women's National Ice Hockey League (WNIHL):\nThe Queen Bees compete in the WNIHL Elite.\nThe Fire Bees compete in the WNIHL League.\nThe Ice Bees compete in the WNIHL Division U16 South.\nThe Queen Bees club was founded in November 1987, when the rink at Bracknell opened. It has supplied players for the GB ice or inline / skater hockey teams in most years since. The Firebees team was formed later as a development squad in September 2005, entering Division 1 for its maiden season in 2006 after 6 friendlies. In 2007 the Ice Bees were formed, specifically for girls under 16.\nIn July 2020, after having been shut for 4 months due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the team's home rink in Bracknell was permanently closed. This forced the relocation of the Queen Bees as well as the men's Bracknell Bees team to Slough Ice Arena, where they both play to this day.\nAll teams play in the same strip. Previously the Queen Bees played in black and gold (away) or black and white (home) horizontal stripes. To conform with new league rules the strip was altered in 2006, but the club colours of black and gold remain the same.\nThe head coach is Gareth Endicott, assisted by Claire Fay and player-coaches Katherine Gale and Nicola Lazarczuk.\nHistory\nThe Queen Bees\n1988–89\nThe Queen Bees first season.
