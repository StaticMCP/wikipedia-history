It is located in the region of Masuria.\nHistory\nAs of 1539, the population of the village was solely Polish. In 1881, the village had a population of 122.\nUnder Nazi Germany, the village was renamed to Fischborn in attempt to erase traces of Polish origin, and was the site of the Oflag 63 prisoner-of-war camp and a subcamp of the Stalag I-F POW camp.\nAfter World War II, the historic Polish name Dłutowo was restored.\nReferences"
