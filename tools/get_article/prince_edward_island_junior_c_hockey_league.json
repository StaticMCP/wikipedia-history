The league was known as the Prince Edward Island Minor Junior Hockey League until 2009.\nThe winner of the playoffs competes in the Maritime-Hockey North Junior C Championship.\nLate in the 2023-24 season the league changed sponsors, welcoming a rebrand to the Township Chevrolet Jr Hockey League.\nHistory\nIn 2015 the South Side Lynx won their first league championship and then proceeded to be the first PEI representative to advance to the Maritime-Hockey North Junior C Championship final game. In the championship game the Lynx played against the Baffin Blizzard with both teams vying to be the first team from their province/territory to claim a Maritime-Hockey North title. The Baffin Blizzard prevailed, winning 6–5.\nAfter a one-year absence a Summerside team, now known as the Crunch, was announced as returning to the league for the 2016–17 season.\nSherwood Metros became the first PEI team to win the Maritime-Hockey North Championship in 2018. The Metros defeated South Side Lynx 4–1 in the final.\nIn January 2019 the South Side Lynx ceased operations due to a lack of healthy players. The team posted a 5–13–0–2 record, last in the five-team league. The team announced a return for 2020–21.\nTeams\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"  bgcolor=\"#dddddd\"\n!Team!!Centre\n!First season\n|- align=\"center\"\n| Morell Lions ||Morell\n|2024–25\n|- align=\"center\"\n| North River Flames ||Cornwall\n|2005–06\n|- align=\"center\"\n| Pownal Ice Dogs ||Pownal\n|2019–20\n|- align=\"center\"\n|Sherwood Metros||Sherwood\n|2015–16\n|- align=\"center\"\n| South Side Lynx ||Crapaud\n|2001–02\n|- align=\"center\"\n|Tignish Aces||Tignish\n|2002–03\n|}\nFormer teams (1997–present)\n* Bedeque Red Wings (1998–99)\n* Belfast Sabres (2001–17)\n* Charlottetown Abbies (1997–2005; 2009–12)\n* Evangeline Loggers (2005–07)\n* Georgetown Eagles (2017–18)\n* Georgetown Timberwolves (1997–98)\n* Holland College Hurricanes (2010–12)\n* Montague Norsemen (1998–2001; 2003–04)\n* Montague Sharks (2010–11)\n* Morell Crunch (2010–13)\n* Morell Flyers (2003–10; 2015–16)\n* Morell Mustangs (1997–2002)\n* North River Flames (1997–98) - returned to league in 2005\n* Pownal Nicks (1997–98)\n* Pownal Red Devils (2003–12)\n* Rustico Whitecaps (1999–2005)\n* Sherwood Falcons (1997–98; 1999–2009; 2013–15)\n* Souris Boat Haulers (2008–09)\n* Souris Hawks (1999–2000; 2013–15)\n* South Side Lynx (2001–2019) - returned to league in 2020\n* Summerside Capitals (2003–05; 2013–14)\n* Summerside Crunch (2016–20)\n* Tignish Aces (1997–98; 2000–01) - returned to league in 2002\n* Tyne Valley Clover Farmers (2001–06; 2011–13)\nChampions\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Playoff Champions\n!Season\n!Champion\n!Finalist\n!Result\n|-\n|1992\n|Kings County Kings\n|\n|\n|-\n|1993\n|Sherwood Falcons\n|\n|\n|-\n|1994\n|North River Flames\n|\n|\n|-\n|1995\n|Sherwood Falcons\n|\n|\n|-\n|1996\n|North River Flames\n|\n|\n|-\n|1997\n|North River Flames\n|\n|\n|-\n|1998\n|Tignish Aces\n|Charlottetown Abbies\n|4–3\n|-\n|1999\n|Charlottetown Abbies\n|Morell Mustangs\n|4–0\n|-\n|2000\n|Charlottetown Abbies\n|Souris Hawks\n|2–0\n|-\n|2001\n|Montague Norsemen\n|Sherwood Falcons\n|3–0\n|-\n|2002\n|Sherwood Falcons\n|Rustico Whitecaps\n|4–2\n|-\n|2003\n|Tignish Aces\n|Sherwood Falcons\n|4–3\n|-\n|2004\n|Sherwood Falcons\n|South Side Lynx\n|4–2\n|-\n|2005\n|Tignish Aces\n|Sherwood Falcons\n|4–1\n|-\n|2006\n|Sherwood Falcons\n|Tignish Aces\n|4–3\n|-\n|2007\n|Sherwood Falcons\n|North River Flames\n|3–2\n|-\n|2008\n|Tignish Aces\n|North River Flames\n|4–1\n|-\n|2009\n|Tignish Aces\n|North River Flames\n|4–3\n|-\n|2010\n|Tignish Aces\n|Charlottetown Abbies\n|4–0\n|-\n|2011\n|Charlottetown Abbies\n|Tignish Aces\n|4–3\n|-\n|2012\n|Tignish Aces\n|Pownal Red Devils\n|4–2\n|-\n|2013\n|Tignish Aces\n|South Side Lynx\n|4–0\n|-\n|2014\n|Tignish Aces\n|Southside Lynx\n|4–1\n|-\n|2015\n|South Side Lynx\n|Belfast Sabres\n|4–2\n|-\n|2016\n|South Side Lynx\n|Belfast Sabres\n|4–0\n|-\n|2017\n|South Side Lynx\n|Sherwood Metros\n|4–2\n|-\n|2018\n|Sherwood Metros\n|Tignish Aces\n|4–3\n|-\n|2019\n|Tignish Aces\n|Sherwood Metros\n|4–1\n|-\n|2020\n|Cancelled due to Covid-19 pandemic\n|\n|\n|-\n|2021\n|Cancelled due to Covid-19 pandemic\n|\n|\n|-\n|2022\n|Pownal Ice Dogs\n|Sherwood Metros\n|3–0\n|-\n|2023\n|Tignish Aces\n|Pownal Ice Dogs\n|4–1\n|-\n|2024\n|Tignish Aces\n|Pownal Ice Dogs\n|4–1\n|-\n|2025\n|Tignish Aces\n|Pownal Ice Dogs\n|4–2\n|}\nSee also\n*List of ice hockey teams in Prince Edward Island\n*Island Junior Hockey League\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.peijuniorc.com/ PEI Junior C League]"
