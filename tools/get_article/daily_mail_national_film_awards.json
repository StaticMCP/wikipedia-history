They were sponsored by the Daily Mail'' newspaper with readers voting at cinemas across the country, for Best Actor, Actress, and Film. The inaugural event was held at the Dorchester Hotel, London in 1946.\nThe first awards were awarded to James Mason and Margaret Lockwood for most outstanding British actor and actress during the war years.\nThe award is seen as the predecessor to the British Academy Film Awards (also known as the BAFTA Film Awards) which, although it began in 1947, did not give Best Actor/Actress awards until 1952 and the inspiration behind the National Film Awards UK which is voted on by movie fans and commenced its award ceremonies since 2015.\nAwards\nThe awards ran from 1946 to 1951. It was always held at the Dorchester Hotel in London and was hosted by Lord and Lady Rothermere.
