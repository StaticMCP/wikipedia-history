Its territory comprises a corridor of land in the west of the city with a northern boundary formed by the railway lines between the  and  stations, encompassing the Broomhouse, Dalry, Gorgie, Longstone, Parkhead, Saughton, Sighthill and Stenhouse neighbourhoods. It elects four Councillors (a minor boundary change in 2017 caused the loss of the Calders neighbourhood and the northern parts of Wester Hailes, with a small decrease in population but no change to the number of councillors). In 2019, the ward had a population of 33,826.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Joanna Toomey(Liberal Democrats)\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Nick Elliott-Canon(SNP)\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Donald C Wilson(Labour)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Eric Milligan(Labour)\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Catherine Fullerton(SNP)\n|rowspan=3|Denis Dixon(SNP)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Ashley Graczyk(Conservative)\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1|Ross McKenzie(Labour)\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Dan Heap(Green)\n|}\nElection results\n2022 election\n2017 election\n2017 City of Edinburgh Council election\n|numcounts=7\n}}\nOn 4 July 2018, Conservative councillor Ashley Graczyk resigned from the party and became an Independent, saying the UK government's policies on disability issues and social justice were \"incompatible with my beliefs and conscience\".\n2012 election\n2012 City of Edinburgh Council election\n2007 election\n2007 City of Edinburgh Council election\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/scotland/sighthillgorgie-ward-city-of-edinburgh#.YGRQKFPTVkw Listed Buildings in Sighthill/Gorgie Ward, City of Edinburgh] at British Listed Buildings"
