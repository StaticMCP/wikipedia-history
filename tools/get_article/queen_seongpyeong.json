In 1211 (7th year reign of her husband), she was given the Royal title Princess Hampyeong () and formally became the queen consort. Together, they had 5 sons and 5 daughters. When her husband tried to kill Ch'oe Ch'ung-hŏn at Suchang Palace (), he failed and was forced to abdicate the throne as a result. Then, Huijong and their eldest son were exiled to modern-day Incheon and she became the only senior member left in the main palace, which believed that it was due to her close relationship with the next Kings, Gangjong and Gojong.\nUpon the Goryeo-Mongol war breaking out, the court moved the Palace and she later died without being able to leave Ganghwa-gyeong () on 1247 (34th year reign of Gojong of Goryeo). The queen was later buried in Soreung tomb () and received Jeongjang () as her posthumous name given by King Gojong in 1253.\nIn popular culture\n*Portrayed by Chae Min-seo in the 2003–04 KBS1 TV Series Age of Warriors.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Index?contents_id=E0029668 Queen Seongpyeong] on the Encyclopedia of Korean Culture .\n*[http://db.history.go.kr/KOREA/search/searchResult.do?sort=levelId&dir=ASC&limit=20&page=1&pre_page=1&codeIds=PERIOD-0-3&searchTermImages=%EC%84%B1%ED%8F%89%EC%99%95%ED%9B%84&searchKeywordType=BI&searchKeywordMethod=EQ&searchKeyword=%EC%84%B1%ED%8F%89%EC%99%95%ED%9B%84&searchKeywordConjunction=AND#searchDetail/kr/kr_088r_0010_0970/9/1/9/r Queen Seongpyeong] on Goryeosa ."
