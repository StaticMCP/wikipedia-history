The event was hosted by Jack Black. Voting began March 3 on Nick.com and Nicktropolis. A \"Bring on the Nominees\" special hosted by Lil' JJ also aired. The Naked Brothers Band and Miley Cyrus were the musical performers. A sweepstakes was announced to promote the show. The number of votes cast broke the record previously set in 2007. 86,708,020 kids cast 88,254,272 votes (since kids were allowed to vote multiple times) between March 3–29 in 18 categories, to honor and vote for their favorites. Votes were cast via Nick.com, Nicktropolis, TurboNick, and for the first time via Nick's new mobile website (wap.nick.com). The award show attracted 7.7 million viewers.\nThe 2008 Kids' Choice Awards is notable for being the only time that SpongeBob SquarePants did not win the Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Cartoon since the show was first nominated in 2003, with Avatar: The Last Airbender winning instead.\nPresenters and Performers, and Stunts for KCA 2008\nPresenters (in order of appearance)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Celebrity (ies)\n!Presenting\n|-\n|Jack Black\n|Hosted the Awards\n|-\n|Miranda Cosgrove\n|Cameo appearances throughout the show\n|-\n|Tom Kenny\n|Newly titled himself, \"The Voice in a Box\" (announcer), SpongeBob\n|-\n|Josh PeckJanet Jackson\n|Favorite Movie Actress\n|-\n|Emile HirschAmerica Ferrera\n|Favorite Music Group\n|-\n|Laila Ali\n|Introduced Akon, Usher and Heidi Klum for the slime stunts\n|-\n|James MarsdenHayden Panettiere\n|Favorite Female Singer\n|-\n|Shia LaBeoufHarrison Ford\n|Favorite Voice From an Animated Movie\n|-\n|Ryan ShecklerAbigail Breslin\n|Introduced The Naked Brothers Band\n|-\n|Pete WentzAshlee Simpson-Wentz\n|Favorite Reality Show\n|-\n|Jennifer Love HewittDevon Werkheiser\n|Favorite Male Singer\n|-\n|Ashton Kutcher\n|Wannabe Award\n|-\n|Howie Mandel\n|Introduced the YMCA burping contest\n|-\n|Jaden, Willow & Will Smith\n|Introduced Miley Cyrus\n|-\n|RihannaBrendan Fraser\n|Favorite TV Show\n|-\n|Steve CarellAmy Poehler\n|Favorite Movie\n|}\nPerformers (in order of appearance)\n*The Naked Brothers Band performed \"I Don't Want to Go to School\"\n*Miley Cyrus performed \"G.N.O (Girl's Night Out)\"\nSlimed Celebrities\n*Harrison Ford – While presenting Favorite Voice From an Animated Movie with Shia LaBeouf, Ford replaced an orb containing the winner with a blimp, similar to the classic scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark.

The cast aired from 9/8c - 11/10c. Carly, Sam, Freddie, and Spencer were at the Kids' Choice Awards because Spencer was hired to make a Kids' Choice Awards Blimp out of Wieners. Although Spencer was working on his sculpture, he happened to peek around the show, like the Gift bags for the Celebrities, going into Jack Black's Dressing Room, and stealing some mini wienies from the Snack table. In the end, his sculpture was destroyed when the Snack lady attacked him. People actually believed that it was a fan who destroyed the sculpture as security tackled the Snack Lady.\nMusical Guests\n'''Countdown to Kids' Choice''':\n*Lil' Mama - Shawty Get Loose\nThe Show:\n* The Naked Brothers Band, \"I Don't Want To Go to School\"\n* Miley Cyrus, \"G.N.O.
