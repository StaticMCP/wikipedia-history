Independent candidate Bonnie Critchley won 9.82% of the vote, placing second.\nBackground\nOn May 2, 2025, Prime Minister Mark Carney affirmed his commitment to promptly ask Governor General Mary Simon to issue a writ for the by-election when requested, stating, \"If it's the decision of him and the Conservative Party to trigger... a by-election, I will ensure that it happens as soon as possible.\" Kurek announced his resignation later that day. Kurek said in a statement his resignation is what is best for the party and his constituents. Kurek said he intends to run again in the riding in the next general election.\nBy law, Kurek's resignation could not be officially tendered until 30 days after the publication of the election result in the Canada Gazette, which occurred on May 15, 2025. Kurek officially resigned on Tuesday, June 17, 2025. The governor general, who could issue a writ of election no sooner than 11 days after notice is given of a vacancy, dropped the writ on June 30, 2025, for a by-election to be held on August 18, 2025. The riding is considered a \"stronghold\" for the Conservatives.\nThe riding was targeted by the Longest Ballot Committee which pushed the number of registered candidates to a record 214. Elections Canada opted to use write-in ballots instead of standard ballots, normally used for early voting at Elections Canada offices or when using a mail-in ballot. This is permitted by the Canada Elections Act during \"an unusual or unforeseen circumstance.\"\nTimeline\n* April 28: 2025 Canadian federal election\n** Damien Kurek wins the Battle River—Crowfoot seat\n** Pierre Poilievre loses the Carleton seat in Ontario\n* June 17: Kurek resigns his seat\n* June 18: The Speaker informs the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada that the seat is vacant\n* June 30: Writ of Election is dropped by Governor General Mary Simon on the instruction of the prime minister\n* July 28: Nomination period closed\n** Elections Canada announces that write in ballots will be used\n* July 29: Candidate forum, hosted by the Camrose & District Chamber of Commerce\n*July 30: Official candidate list published\n*July 31: Candidate forum in Tofield, hosted by Talk Truth\n*August 5: Candidate forum, hosted by the Drumheller & District Chamber of Commerce\n*August 7: Candidate forum, hosted by the Stettler Public Library and the Stettler Regional Board of Trade\n*August 8–12: Advance voting\n*August 13: Elections Canada reports that 14,454 votes were cast in advanced voting\n*August 18: Election day.

She is in favour of electoral reform, particularly in light of the 'Longest Ballot Committee', is opposed to Albertan Independence, and says that a focus of hers is on tackling the 'increasing cost of living\".\nShe had been described as the \"most visible threat to Poilievre’s [re-election] prospects\".\nMichael Harris\nMichael Harris is a political sciences student who ran for the Libertarian Party to push forward a referendum on Albertan independence. Harris said he is running on a \"platform focused on individual liberty, Alberta autonomy, and ending federal programs like equalization and supply management.\" Harris criticized Poilievre for using the riding as a \"stepping stone to national ambitions\".\nKenneth Kirk\nKirk was the Marijuana Party candidate, and leader of the party's unregistered provincial counterpart since 2000.

The committee previously targeted Poilievre's former electoral district of Carleton in the 2025 federal election and claimed responsibility for adding 85 names to the ballot in that vote. All of the declared independents except Colquhoun, Critchley, and Spanier are LBC candidates, a total of 201, far surpassing their previous record set earlier in 2025, and reaching their goal of 200 names. The grand total of 214 candidates on the ballot also more than doubles the previous all-time record of 91 set during the 2025 Carleton election and the 2024 LaSalle—Émard—Verdun federal by-election, both attributed to the LBC's efforts.\nDebates\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-justify: none; font-size:90%\"\n|+ 2025 Battle River—Crowfoot federal by-election debates\n|- style=\"font-size:small;\"\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Date\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Organizers\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Location\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Link\n! colspan=\"11\" | Participant Invitee  Absent invitee  Non-invitee\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Sources\n|-\n! style=\"width:6em;\" | PoilievreConservative\n! style=\"width:6em;\" | SpadyLiberal\n! style=\"width:6em;\" | SwampyNDP\n! style=\"width:6em;\" | BridgesPPC\n! style=\"width:6em;\" | MacDonaldGreen\n! style=\"width:6em;\" | WillertonChristian Heritage\n! style=\"width:6em;\" | HarrisLibertarian\n! style=\"width:6em;\" | KirkMarijuana\n! style=\"width:6em;\" | AbrahamUnited\n! style=\"width:6em;\" | CritchleyIndependent\n! style=\"width:6em;\" | SpanierIndependent\n|-\n! style=\"background:\" |\n! style=\"background:\" |\n! style=\"background:\" |\n! style=\"background:\" |\n! style=\"background:\" |\n! style=\"background:\"|\n! style=\"background:\" |\n! style=\"background:\" |\n! style=\"background:\" |\n! style=\"background:\" |\n! style=\"background:\" |\n|-\n| July 29, 2025 || Camrose & District Chamber of Commerce || Cargill Theatre, Jeanne & Peter Lougheed Performing Arts Centre Camrose || [https://vimeo.com/event/5261323 Vimeo]\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| July 31, 2025 || Talk Truth/Heritage Christian Ministries Association || The House Ministries Church Tofield || [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFUgiYHo3BY YouTube]\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| August 5, 2025 || Drumheller & District Chamber of Commerce(with support from the Hanna & District Chamber of Commerce) || Badlands Community Facility – Banquet Halls B & C Drumheller || [https://www.facebook.com/boom995/videos/1350268843108433/ Facebook]\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| August 7, 2025 || Stettler Public Library and Stettler Regional Board of Trade || Stettler Community Hall || [https://www.facebook.com/StettlerPublicLibrary/videos/691352987290790/ Facebook]\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nResult\nPrevious result\nSee also\n* 2025 Canadian federal election in Alberta\n* 2025 Alberta provincial by-elections\nNotes\nReferences"
