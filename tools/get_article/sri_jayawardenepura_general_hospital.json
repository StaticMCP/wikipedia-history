The hospital was gifted by Japan in appreciation of Sri Lankan President J. R. Jayewardene's support of Japan and diplomatic efforts on their behalf; the hospital was donated with 1001 beds, with 1000 beds to the public and 1 bed reserved for Jayawardene in his lifetime. A special Act of Parliament (Sri Jayewardenepura General Hospital Board Act, No. 54 of 1983) was established for the governance of the SJGH.\nWhile the hospital functions as part of Sri Lanka's free healthcare system, it also contains a non-free section where paying citizens may be cared for in private rooms and more personalized levels of treatment and care.\nReferences"
