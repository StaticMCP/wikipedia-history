The group originally consisted of Bushwick Bill, DJ Ready Red, Sire Jukebox and Prince Johnny C. Following the release of Making Trouble, Rap-A-Lot Records dropped Sire Jukebox and Johnny C from the group, and added Scarface and Willie D.\nMaking Trouble received little attention, negative reviews, and is often forgotten in the midst of the group's later successful, acclaimed and controversial albums.\nStyle and influence\nThe group used a style of rap similar to Run-DMC at this time as opposed to the more hardcore rap style that Scarface and Willie D provided in later albums. Insane Clown Posse's Violent J, who was influenced by the Geto Boys, regards the song \"Assassins\" as the first horrorcore song ever recorded. It was covered by Insane Clown Posse on their 1999 album The Amazing Jeckel Brothers.\nTracklist\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!align=\"center\" |#\n!align=\"center\" |Title\n!align=\"center\" |Time(s)\n|-\n|1\n|\"Making Trouble\"\n|5:19\n|-\n|2\n|\"Snitches\"\n|2:43\n|-\n|3\n|\"Balls and My Word\"\n|3:50\n|-\n|4\n|\"Assassins\"\n|5:45\n|-\n|5\n|\"Why Do We Live This Way\"\n|6:53\n|-\n|6\n|\"I Run This\"\n|4:20\n|-\n|7\n|\"No Curfew\"\n|3:36\n|-\n|8\n|\"One Time Freestyle\"\n|3:26\n|-\n|9\n|\"Geto Boys Will Rock You\"\n|3:45\n|-\n|10\n|\"You Ain't Nothin'\"\n|2:46\n|-\n|11\n|\"The Problem\"\n|2:58\n|}\nPersonnel\nGhetto Boys\n* Prince Johnny C. – vocals, production\n* The Sire Jukebox – vocals, production\n* DJ Ready Red – vocals, turntables, production\nAdditional personnel\n* Karl Stephenson – production, sampling\n* Cliff Blodget – production\nReferences"
