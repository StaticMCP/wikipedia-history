      "text": "# Draft:Trendjacking\n\nTrendjacking is the process of creating news from other currently trending, related news. It originated in 2000 during the dot.com boom.\nBecause larger brands, celebrities and politician garner disproportionate new coverage, it can be difficult for those without pre-existing profiles to become newsworthy and attract attention.\nTrendjacking leverages the fame or reputation of existing high-profile trends, brands, or high profile characters to bring relevance to a relatively less-known subject, brand or point of view. It has been compared to the martial arts move in aikido, where an opponent's mass is used against them.\nExamples of early usage include the trendjacking of Ernst & Young's divestiture of its IT consulting business to Cap Gemini in 2000, where upstart consultancy, Scient, inserted itself into the media debate to boost its credibility in the management consultancy space.\nTrendjacking, has now become a mainstream marketing tactic for smaller profile organizations who need to build profile faster. In contrast, it is a tactic which established organizations need to be alert to as it can weaponise their previous success and established reputation against them.\nSee also\n*Newsjacking\nReferences"
