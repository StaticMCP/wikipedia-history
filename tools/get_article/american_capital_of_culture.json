The organization's leaders claim the initiative is based closely on the European Capital of Culture program; it enjoys the backing of the Organization of American States, but the OAS is not involved in the selection process.\nThe organization was founded in 1998 with the objectives to raise awareness of culture in the Americas and to promote the city selected as the Capital of Culture for the year. The chosen city is publicized on the television networks Antena 3 and the Discovery network.\nWhile the NGO claims that the designation \"is aimed at all the countries of the Americas\",  the 26 locations (includes two in 2003) designated as the American Capital of Culture have only been chosen from Latin America and the Caribbean. Furthermore, the designation has increasingly become Mexico-centric; Mexico has dominated the program since 2014, being given the designation six times in the 11 years from 2014 to 2024.\nList of dates of American Capital of Culture\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+American Capitals of Culture\n!Year !!City !!Country\n|-\n!2000\n| Mérida ||\n|-\n!2001\n| Iquique ||\n|-\n!2002\n| Maceió ||\n|-\n!rowspan=2|2003\n| Panama City ||\n|-\n| Curitiba ||\n|-\n!2004\n| Santiago ||\n|-\n!2005\n| Guadalajara ||\n|-\n!2006\n| Cordoba ||\n|-\n!2007\n| Cuzco ||\n|-\n!2008\n| Brasília ||\n|-\n!2009\n| Asunción ||\n|-\n!2010\n| Santo Domingo ||\n|-\n!2011\n| Quito ||\n|-\n!2012\n| São Luís ||\n|-\n!2013\n| Barranquilla ||\n|-\n!2014\n| Colima ||\n|-\n!2015\n| Mayagüez ||\n|-\n!2016\n| Valdivia ||\n|-\n!2017\n| Mérida ||\n|-\n!2018\n| Anzoátegui ||\n|-\n!2019\n| San Miguel de Allende ||\n|-\n!2020\n| Punta Arenas ||\n|-\n!2021\n| Estado de Zacatecas ||\n|-\n!2022\n| Ibagué ||\n|-\n!2023\n|  Aguascalientes ||\n|-\n!2024\n| Nayarit ||\n|-\n!2025\n|  San Luis Potosí ||\n|}\nSee also\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
