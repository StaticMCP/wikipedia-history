      "text": "# King of Vegas\n\nKing of Vegas is a gambling series that first aired on Spike TV in the United States on January 17, 2006.  It was hosted by boxing commentator Max Kellerman and co-hosted by handicapper Wayne Allyn Root, who gave color commentary and his odds-on favorites for each game. The tournament director was Matt Savage, who has also directed tournaments at the World Series of Poker.\nFormat\nUnlike other gambling series on television, King of Vegas includes competition in eight different casino games; four per week, all starting with blackjack and ending a final game of Texas Hold 'Em. All games are played with players getting a fresh set of $10,000 in chips (the format would later change a bit, but the $10,000 chip gain remained constant until the final episode). All games are played with limited hands/rounds to fit with the show's fast pace and hour-long time slot. All games have no limits on betting.\nThe show features twelve players, gathered by the producers/creators of the show. Six of the players are gambling pros of varied games and ages. The other six are unknowns in gambling, never having broken into the pro circuit of any game, some of which possibly involved in games on a small level (such as a card dealer). Each week, one player is eliminated, leaving the show with no prize whatsoever. The winner of the tournament takes home $1,000,000 and is crowned King of Vegas.\nTo start, the players are randomly divided into two groups. One half plays one game (called a \"Round\"), with a certain number of players with high scores going to the \"Sitting Pretty\" couch, meaning they are safe from elimination for that week. The other half then play a different casino game with a certain number of players again \"Sitting Pretty.\" A third game is then played with the players who still haven't qualified. Again, a certain number \"Sit Pretty.\" The episode then culminates in the \"Texas Hold 'Em Deathmatch,\" which includes four players (until the final two episodes). Players try to double their chip stacks to automatically sit pretty. The first two players to Bust go to head-to-head \"Sudden Death,\" same rules as Death Match, where the loser is out of the tournament.\nWhen the player count thins down, the format changes a little bit. When six or less players are left in the competition, all players will play in all three opening games. At six players, all chips won in Round 2 carry over to Round 3. When five or fewer players are left, chips won in both Rounds 1 & 2 will carry on. All players still get a fresh $10,000 in chips at the beginning of all games, on top of whatever they carried over from previous rounds. At the end of the three games, the player on top of all the others in chip count goes to the Sitting Pretty couch while the rest go to the Death Match. When the show drops to three players left, there are no Sitting Pretty seats. Instead, the player with the lowest chip count is eliminated from the tournament after the first three games, and the remaining two players battle it out in the Death Match with $500,000 in chips each. Doubling the chips up wins the tournament and the King of Vegas title.\nThe show was recorded in a temporary studio constructed in the parking lot of Bally's Las Vegas.\nPlayers involved\nGambling pros\n* Ken Einiger, Blackjack player\n* Mike \"The Mouth\" Matusow, Poker player\n* Evelyn Ng, Poker player\n* \"Hollywood Dave\" Stann, Blackjack player\n* David Williams, Poker player\n* Joanna Wlodawer, Blackjack player\nAmateur players\n* Alan Borman, producer of TV & radio commercials\n* \"The Chainsaw\" Steve Dempsey, plumber\n* Jerry Goldberg, gambling retiree\n* Todd Haushalter, casino administrator\n* Gerald Brandon Fanning Betsy Layne High School graduate.\n* Katie Porrello, dealer\n* Josh MacDonald, Student\nStandings\nOrder of elimination\n* Week 1 - Joanna Wlodawer, eliminated by Katie Porrello\n* Week 2 - Todd Haushalter, eliminated by Jerry Goldberg\n* Week 3 - Ken Einiger, eliminated by Katie Porrello\n* Week 4 - Mike Matusow, eliminated by Evelyn Ng\n* Week 5 - Gerald Brandon Fanning, eliminated by Katie Porrello\n* Week 6 - Steve Dempsey, eliminated by David Williams\n* Week 7 - Evelyn Ng, eliminated by Dave Stann\n* Week 8 - Katie Porrello, eliminated by David Williams\n* Week 9 - Dave Stann, eliminated by Alan Borman\n* Week 10 - David Williams, eliminated due to chip count\n* Week 10 - Jerry Goldberg, eliminated by Alan Borman\n* King of Vegas - Alan Borman\nDeath match/sudden death records\n* Joanna Wlodawer - Death Match: 0-1 / Sudden Death: 0-1\n* Todd Haushalter - Death Match: 0-1 / Sudden Death: 0-1\n* Ken Einiger - Death Match: 0-1 / Sudden Death: 0-1\n* Mike Matusow - Death Match: 1-1 / Sudden Death: 0-1\n* Gerald Brandon Fanning - Death Match: 1-1 / Sudden Death: 0-1\n* Steve Dempsey - Death Match: 0-1 / Sudden Death: 0-1\n* Evelyn Ng - Death Match: 0-2 / Sudden Death: 1-1\n* Katie Porrello - Death Match: 2-4 / Sudden Death: 3-1\n* Dave Stann - Death Match: 3-2 / Sudden Death: 1-1\n* David Williams - Death Match: 3-2 / Sudden Death: 2-0\n* Jerry Goldberg - Death Match: 3-1 / Sudden Death: 1-1\n* Alan Borman - Death Match: 4-1 / Sudden Death: 2-0\nGames played\n* Blackjack\n* Caribbean Stud Poker\n* Craps\n* Horse racing\n* Mini-Baccarat\n* Pai Gow Poker\n* Red Dog\n* Roulette\n* Texas Hold 'Em\nEpisode summaries\nEpisode 1: Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is\nThe first episode featured rounds of Blackjack, Caribbean Stud, and Roulette.
