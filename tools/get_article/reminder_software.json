Most programs provide a calendar or list view of events, as well as a reminding technique.  Most common reminding techniques are pop-up dialog boxes and auditory alarms.\nEvents may include birthdays, holidays, anniversaries, various one-time events. Often the software comes with a set of pre-installed events (such as holidays) and allows the user to create custom events.\nAs software has made the transition to web services, a number of online reminder services have appeared. Users subscribed to those services usually receive their reminders by email or SMS. Context-aware reminder systems can set reminders based on the user's current location.\nSee also\n* Reminders (Apple)\n* Cortana Reminders\n* Notification system\n* Digital calendar\n* Personal information manager\nReferences"
