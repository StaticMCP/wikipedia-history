The office of the president of the SADR was established in August 1982, after a change in the constitution made by the fifth general congress of the Polisario Front, where it was decided the post were to be held by the Secretary-General of the Polisario. The first President was Mohamed Abdelaziz from August 1982 until his death in 2016.\nThe powers of the presidency are extensive, and they have been subject to modification in various constitutional amendments, the last occurring in 1995.\nChairmen/Presidents of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (1976–present)\n| born_year         = 1948\n| died_year         = 1976\n| died              = y\n| term_start        = 29 February 1976\n| term_end          = 9 June 1976\n| timeinoffice      =\n| alt_party         = Polisario Front\n| ref               = —\n}}\n| alt_party         = Polisario Front\n| ref               = —\n}}\n| alt_party         = Polisario Front\n| ref               = —\n}}\n| alt_party         = Polisario Front\n| ref               =\n}}\n| alt_party         = Polisario Front\n| ref               = —\n}}\nTimeline\nColors =\nid:polisario value:rgb(1,0.44,0.16) legend:Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Saguia_el-Hamra_and_Río_de_Oro\nid:gray1  value:gray(0.85)\nid:gray2  value:gray(0.95)\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/01/1976 till:$today\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor = gridcolor:gray1 unit:year increment:5 start:1976\nScaleMinor = gridcolor:gray2 unit:year increment:1 start:1976\nLegend     = columns:1 left:150 top:35 columnwidth:170\nTextData =\npos:(20,38) textcolor:black fontsize:M\ntext:\"Political party:\"\nBarData =\nbar:El-Ouali\nbar:Beiba\nbar:Abdelaziz\nbar:Addouh\nbar:Ghali\nPlotData =\nwidth:5 align:left fontsize:S shift:(5,-4) anchor:till\nbar:El-Ouali\nfrom: 29/02/1976 till: 09/06/1976 color:polisario text:\"El-Ouali Mustapha Sayed\"\nbar:Beiba\nfrom: 09/06/1976 till: 30/08/1976 color:polisario text:\"Mahfoud Ali Beiba (acting)\"\nbar:Abdelaziz\nfrom: 30/08/1976 till: 31/05/2016 color:polisario text:\"Mohamed Abdelaziz\"\nbar:Addouh\nfrom: 31/05/2016 till: 12/07/2016 color:polisario text:\"Khatri Addouh (acting)\"\nbar:Ghali\nfrom: 12/07/2016 till: $today     color:polisario text:\"Brahim Ghali\"\n}}\nSee also\n* History of Western Sahara\n* List of colonial governors of Spanish Sahara\n* Prime Minister of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/presidentedelarasd/ President of the SADR photo gallery]\n* [http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Western_Sahara.html World Statesmen – Western Sahara]"
