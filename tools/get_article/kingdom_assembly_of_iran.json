The group is currently banned in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Tondar means 'thunder' in Persian.\nOrganization\nThe Kingdom Assembly of Iran formerly ran a satellite television service from London, named 'Your TV'. It stopped broadcasting in 2008. API then initiated radio and television broadcasts from Los Angeles named 'Radio Tondar'.\nExact membership of the API remains unknown. In 2010, the group claimed \"100,000 members in the U.S.\", despite experts estimating it to have a size of a few hundred worldwide.\nIdeology and platform\nThe core ideology of the Kingdom Assembly of Iran is monarchism, which it embraces more on organic, emotional and romantic elements rather than a political reasoning. In contrast to typical monarchists who glorify the Pahlavi dynasty, the group looks back more to pre-Islamic Persian Empire as a source of inspiration.\nThe group is staunchly against Islam and characterizes it as \"alien\" and \"violent\". In a posting, the Kingdom Assembly of Iran blames 1,400 years of \"shameful Islamic tradition\" as the fundamental problem of Iran due to Gender Inequality and Oppression, Cultural Repression and Violence and Intolerance which existed in Iran ever since the Arab invasion. Tondar opposes the violent and forced destruction of Iranian culture following the Arab invasion, asserting that Iranians had a distinct cultural identity prior to this event. It argues that Iranians were indirectly pressured to convert to Islam through the imposition of the 'jizya,' a Tax paid by non-Muslims instead zakat, usually lowe than zakat and gave military exemption and to be ruled by their own laws. The organization draws a clear line between Arab people and between Iranian/Persian and Islamic/Arabic identity.\nThe group considers anyone associated with the Iranian government to be a \"traitor\", and does not recognize any distinguishment between the reformists and the conservatives. It considers the Green Movement of Iran to be a deception by the regime, arguing that the elected president holds no real authority, which rests entirely with the Supreme Leader, who possesses dictatorial power. Like most Iranian opposition groups, Tondar views reformists as merely a faction within the existing regime. However, Iranian authorities tried to discredit 2009 Iranian presidential election protests by linking them to groups such as the Kingdom Assembly of Iran during a series of trials.\nIn a 2010 interview with The Wall Street Journal, spokespersons for the group acknowledged that the group has \"fighters\" who seek replacing of Iran's current system with monarchy. On its Facebook page, as of May 2010 the API called for \"the overthrow of the Islamic regime... by ALL MEAN[s]!!!!\". In 2020 the intelligence minister of the regime accused the group of planning 27 attacks.\nActivities and alleged activities\nBombings\nThe Jamestown Foundation reported that the organization took responsibility for the 2008 Shiraz explosion at the Hosseynieh Seyed al-Shohada Mosque where 12 people were killed and 202 injured.  Mohammad-Reza Ali-Zamani and Arash Rahmanipour, alleged by the government to be members of the assembly, were arrested and tried for the bombing by the Judiciary of the Islamic Republic of Iran. In January 2010 they were executed for moharebeh (\"waging war against God\") and attempting to overthrow the Iranian government. An Assembly spokesperson has denied that Ali Zamani had played any role in the post-election protests, stating that he had worked with the organization, but his job was \"simply to pass on news for our radio station and to make broadcast packages\".\n2005\nIn 2005, 56 Iranians staging a sit-in against the Iranian Islamic government were arrested at the Brussels airport for refusing to leave a Lufthansa plane. At least one protester, Armin Atshgar, identified himself as a member of the group and told the press that \"We want the European Union to remove the Islamic leaders from Iran.\"  The group was also reportedly active at the annual Nowruz Persian parade in New York City.\n2010\nIn 2010, the Iranian regime accused the organization of planning terror attacks in Iran. The group runs pro-Iranian opposition radio and television stations and has called for the overthrowing of the Iranian government.\nThe group members have denied that the group is a terrorist organization and denied involvement with the attacks in Iran.\nIran analysts said Iran may be pointing the finger at Tondar because it prefers to \"blame the internal dissent and tumult on outside forces\".\n2020\nOn 1 August 2020, Iran's Ministry of Intelligence announced they detained Jamshid Sharmahd, spokesperson of the assembly. Iranian state television (IRIB) broadcast a report on Sharmahd's arrest, linking him to the 2008 bombing of the Hosseynieh Seyed Al-Shohada Mosque in Shiraz. It also said his group was behind a 2010 bombing at Ruhollah Khomeini's mausoleum in Tehran that wounded several people.\nSee also\n* Monarchism in Iran\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.tondar.org/ Website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929230917/http://tondar.org/exdoc/invitation.pdf Invitation for debate on Islam], published by The Washington Post"
