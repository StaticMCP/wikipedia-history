Wente\n\nEdward Frank Wente (born October 7, 1930) is an American professor emeritus of Egyptology and the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations at the University of Chicago. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1959 and lectured there from 1963 to 1996. He is also a longstanding member of the Oriental Institute, Chicago. Wente also republished and retranslated the voluminous \"Late Ramesside Letters\" correspondence from Deir el-Medina in 1967.  One of his major works is Letters from Ancient Egypt (1990), published by the Scholarly Press.\nEarly life and education\nBorn in New York City in October 7, 1930 to mother Sophia Wente from York, Pennsylvania who herself had graduated from Columbia University Teachers College in New York and Edward Frank Sr. from Iowa who in 1940 worked as a physicist at a telephone company. Edward Wente had one sibling, Henry C. Wente. Wente graduated from Summit High School in Summit, New Jersey in 1948.\nCareer\nWente received his AB, graduating in three years from the University of Chicago in 1951. In 1954 Wente was a Fulbright exchange student at Cairo University, \"serving as a director of the Cairo office of the American Research Center in Egypt.\" In 1959 he received his PhD, with William F. Edgerton his advisor. Wente's dissertation was titled, \"The Syntax of Verbs of Motion in Egyptian.\" He taught at the University from 1959 to 1996. University professors were John A. Wilson, Edgerton and Keith C. Seele. Wente was consulted as one of the Egyptian experts for the TV documentary 'Pyramid' to \"make sure this show was historically on track\".\nIn the preface to the anthology Gold of Praise Wente's peers acknowledged his long career in Egyptology, within which his interests ranged from \"grammar to studies of chronology, iconography, and religion. In each of these fields he has made significant and lasting contributions, easily on par with colleagues who have a single, more restricted focus.\" Editors, Emily Teeter and John A. Larson go on to state that Wente's books have become classic references for study in the field, but his \"greatest legacy may be the fact that the majority of Egyptologists in major American institutions received their training from Professor Wente. Their own vast body of publications, and in turn their own students, can be taken as yet another tribute not only to his intellect but also to his commitment to teaching. The fact that the contributions in this volume come from the United States, Europe, and the Middle East is an indication of the high regard in which Professor Wente is held by his colleagues.\"\nTiye\nA long-haired Egyptian mummy found in 1898 of an older woman in a side chamber of the tomb of Amenhotep II was rumored to be the mother of pharaoh Akhenaten and grandmother of Tutankhamun, Queen Tiye. Other archeologists believed the unwrapped and looted mummy could not be Tiye and was named \"the Elder Lady\". University of Michigan Professor, James Harris and team x-rayed the mummies of Yuya and Thuya who were known to have been the parents to Tiye. When uploading the scans to a computer it was discovered that the profiles matched that of the Elder Lady.\nBased on the position of the Elder Lady's left arm, Wente suspected it was a woman of royalty. Her hand was closed in a fist and positioned over her chest as if she had been holding a scepter. A lock of hair in a miniature gold casket with a scroll mentioning Queen Tiye was found in the tomb of Tutankhamun. In 1976, Wente and Harris were given three hairs from the casket  and used microprobe analysis to compare the hair found in the casket with the hair on the head of the mummy, which they found to be identical. In 2010, DNA found on the mummy was tested and Wente and Harris's theory was verified, though Wente stated in 1978 that the Michigan team did most of the work.\nPublications\nAs of November 2025, Scopus lists 2 publications by Wente, which have been cited 22 times and a h-index of 2.\nBooks\n*Wente, Edward F.
