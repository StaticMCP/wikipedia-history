The first and second chapters were released on April 16, 2013, and August 5, 2014, by Megaforce Records and were Skid Row's final recordings with singer Johnny Solinger. A third chapter was planned and scheduled for a 2015 release  but was pushed back to 2016 due to Solinger's departure and pushed back again due to Tony Harnell's sudden departure. The third installment was planned to feature ex-DragonForce lead singer ZP Theart, but he was later replaced by Erik Grönwall. The third chapter was ultimately scrapped with the band's next record having the title ''The Gang's All Here instead.\nRelease and promotion\nUnited World Rebellion: Chapter One\nUnited World Rebellion: Chapter One'' was released on April 16, 2013, and is the band's first EP since 1995, and the first in a set of upcoming EPs over the next 12–18 months.
