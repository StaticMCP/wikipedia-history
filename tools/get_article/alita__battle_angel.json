It was directed by Robert Rodriguez, produced by James Cameron and Jon Landau, and written by Cameron and Laeta Kalogridis. Using motion-capture and CGI animation, Rosa Salazar stars as Alita, a cyborg who awakens in a new body without memory of her past and sets out to uncover her destiny. Many of the supporting roles, played by Christoph Waltz, Jennifer Connelly, Mahershala Ali, Ed Skrein, Jackie Earle Haley and Keean Johnson, used live-actors.\nAnnounced in 2003, production was repeatedly delayed due to Cameron's work on Avatar (2009) and its sequels. After years of development hell, Rodriguez was announced as Alitas director in April 2016, with Salazar cast as the lead the following month. Principal photography began in October 2016 in Austin, Texas, mostly at Rodriguez's Troublemaker Studios, and lasted until February 2017.\nAlita: Battle Angel had its world premiere at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on January 31, 2019, and was released in the United States on February 14, 2019, by 20th Century Fox. The film grossed $405 million worldwide, making it Rodriguez's highest-grossing film, and received mixed reviews from critics. A sequel is in development.\nPlot\nIn the year 2563, 300 years after Earth was devastated in a catastrophic war against the United Republic of Mars (URM), scientist Dr. Dyson Ido scavenges a disembodied female cyborg with an intact human brain in the Iron City scrapyard. He unites it with a new cyborg body and names her \"Alita\" after his late daughter. Alita wakes with no memory and befriends Hugo, who dreams of moving to the wealthy sky city Zalem. She also meets Dr. Chiren, Ido's ex-wife. Hugo introduces Alita to Motorball, a Rollerball-like sport played by cyborg gladiators. Hugo secretly robs cyborgs of their parts for Vector, owner of the Motorball tournament and de facto ruler of the Factory, Iron City's governing authority.\nOne night, Alita follows Ido. They are ambushed by killer cyborgs led by Grewishka. Ido is injured and Alita instinctively fights using \"Panzer-Kunst,\" a lost combat art for machine bodies. She kills two cyborgs and damages Grewishka who retreats. Ido reveals that he is a Hunter-Warrior, a bounty hunter hired by the Factory. Grewishka seeks help from Dr. Chiren, who is working for Vector. Alita believes fighting will help her rediscover her past but Ido discourages her from becoming a Hunter-Warrior. Alita finds an advanced cyborg body of a Berserker — shock troops of the enemy URM, of which Alita realizes she was a member. Ido refuses to install Alita in it, which upsets her.\nAlita registers as a Hunter-Warrior. At the Kansas Bar, she and Hugo attempt to recruit other Hunter-Warriors to help take down Grewishka. Hunter-Warrior Zapan provokes Alita and she beats him in a fight, triggering a bar brawl until Ido arrives. An upgraded Grewishka appears and challenges Alita to a duel, having been sent by Zalem's overlord, Nova, to destroy her. Alita's body is damaged by Grewishka before Ido, Hugo, and Hunter-Warrior dogmaster McTeague force Grewishka to retreat. Ido apologizes and transplants Alita into the Berserker body.\nHaving fallen in love with Hugo, Alita enters a Motorball tryout for the prize money to send Hugo to Zalem. Hugo decides to quit his criminal job. He confronts his partner Tanji, but Zapan appears, kills Tanji and frames Hugo for the murder. Hugo escapes and calls Alita for help; she abandons the race and finds him just as Zapan mortally wounds Hugo. Dr. Chiren saves Hugo by attaching his severed head to Alita's life support system. When Zapan attempts to stop Alita, she seizes his Damascus blade and cuts off his face.\nIdo transplants Hugo's head onto a cyborg body and tells Alita that Vector's offer to help Hugo reach Zalem was a lie, and that citizens of Iron City can only enter Zalem by becoming a Motorball champion. Alita confronts Vector, who reveals that Chiren has been harvested for her organs. Vector summons Grewishka whom Alita easily destroys with her new body. Nova speaks to her through Vector. When Nova threatens to harm her friends, Alita fatally impales Vector.\nIdo contacts Alita to tell her that Hugo is climbing a cargo tube towards Zalem. Alita catches up to him and pleads with him to return with her. He agrees, but a serrated defense ring dropped by Nova shreds his body and throws him off the tube. Alita catches him but cannot pull him up. He thanks her for coming to save him, then falls.\nMonths later, Alita is a rising star in Motorball. She swears revenge, pointing her sword toward Zalem where a smirking Nova watches.\nCast\n* Rosa Salazar as Alita, a revived cyborg suffering from amnesia\n* Christoph Waltz as Dr. Dyson Ido, a renowned cyborg scientist, part-time bounty hunter and Alita's father figure\n* Jennifer Connelly as Dr. Chiren, Ido's estranged former wife, a masterful cyborg engineer who works for Vector\n* Mahershala Ali as Vector, an influential entrepreneur at the Factory with criminal connections who also serves as Nova's proxy\n* Ed Skrein as Zapan, an arrogant sword-wielding bounty-hunting cyborg who embarks on an egotistic vendetta against Alita\n* Jackie Earle Haley as Grewishka, a huge criminal cyborg who works for Nova as his personal assassin and enforcer\n* Keean Johnson as Hugo, Alita's love interest and a morally conflicted scrap dealer\n* Jorge Lendeborg Jr. as Tanji, Hugo's scrap-dealing friend and accomplice in crime who is more underhanded and does not share Hugo's ethics\n* Lana Condor as Koyomi, a teenager who is friends with Hugo and Tanji\n* Idara Victor as Nurse Gerhad, Ido's assistant\n* Jeff Fahey as McTeague, a Hunter-Warrior who leads a pack of cyborg dogs\n* Eiza González as Nyssiana, a wanted criminal cyborg assassin and one of Grewishka's subordinates\n* Derek Mears as Romo, a wanted criminal cyborg assassin and one of Grewishka's subordinates\n* Leonard Wu as Kinuba, a top league Motorball player whose limbs were cut off by Hugo's jacking gang\n* Rick Yune as Master Clive Lee, a Hunter-Warrior who claims a record of 207 kills\n* Casper Van Dien as Amok, a cyborg who is responsible for the death of Ido's daughter\n* Elle LaMont as Screwhead, a cyborg who's referred to as being one of the most lethal Hunter-Warriors hired by the Factory\nAppearing in uncredited cameo appearances are Michelle Rodriguez as Alita's cyborg mentor Gelda, Jai Courtney as Motorball champion Jashugan, and Edward Norton as Nova.\nProduction\nDevelopment\nBattle Angel Alita, an early-1990s Japanese cyberpunk manga series written by Yukito Kishiro, was originally brought to James Cameron's attention by filmmaker Guillermo del Toro, and Cameron immediately became enamored with the concept. The domain name \"battleangelalita.com\" was registered to James Cameron by 20th Century Fox around June 2000. Fox also registered the \"battleangelmovie.com\" domain. In April 2003, it was reported by Moviehole that Cameron had confirmed he would direct a Battle Angel film. Cameron confirmed that a script for the film was in production during an interview on the Tokudane! program on Fuji TV on May 4, 2003. It was originally scheduled to be his next production after the TV series Dark Angel, which was influenced by Battle Angel Alita. It was later scheduled to be his next film after Aliens of the Deep in January 2005.\nIn June 2005, The Hollywood Reporter claimed that the film was being delayed while Cameron developed a film known as Project 880, which would later be renamed Avatar. Entertainment Weekly ran an interview in February 2006 in which Cameron stated that his deal with 20th Century Fox was that he produce both films. The article also claimed that Battle Angel was slated to be released in September 2009. In June 2006, Cameron commented that Battle Angel was the second of two planned film trilogies he was developing, with the first being Avatar. In May 2008, Cameron indicated he would be working on a film titled The Dive, a biography of freedivers Francisco Ferreras and Audrey Mestre, thus delaying the film again. That July, at San Diego Comic-Con, he reiterated that he was still committed to making the film. In December 2009, Cameron commented during an interview with MTV News that a script for Battle Angel had been completed.\nIn February 2010, producer Jon Landau commented that he was trying to convince Cameron to change the title from the manga to Alita: Battle Angel for the film. Cameron later explained the reason for rearranging the film title from the initial source material, was to allow the possibilities of sequel titles, \"It's Alita, colon, Battle Angel. Because the next one will be \"Alita: Fallen Angel\" and then Alita...you know \"Avenging Angel\" and then Alita whatever. I mean, that's assuming we make some money.\" Landau also revealed that screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis had worked on writing the film. In August 2010, Cameron stated that the film was \"still on [his] radar,\" but he did not know when he would make it. However, that October, he confirmed that his next films would be two Avatar sequels instead of Battle Angel. He still stated that he did not intend to abandon the film, stating that he loved the project too much to hand it off to another director, but reiterated in June 2011 that it would not be produced until the two Avatar sequels were completed, stating that \"Battle Angel is not going to happen for a few years.\" According to Cameron, his reason for producing Avatar first is because he believes that the film can raise public awareness of the need for environmental protection.\n, the director of the film]]\nDuring an interview with Alfonso Cuarón in July 2013, Cameron set 2017 as the date at which production on the film would begin. In October 2015, The Hollywood Reporter reported that director Robert Rodriguez was in negotiations to direct the film, now titled Alita: Battle Angel, and Cameron would be attached as producer alongside Jon Landau. Rodriguez had been brought in by Cameron to condense and combine Cameron's 186-page screenplay and some 600 pages of notes into what could be the shooting script. Satisfied by Rodriguez's work on the shooting script, Cameron offered him the directing job. In April 2016, The Hollywood Reporter reported that 20th Century Fox had not yet greenlit the film, as they were attempting to reduce the budget to something below $175–$200 million. The article also announced that Rodriguez had been signed as director. In late May 2016, Fox scheduled the film for a July 20, 2018 release date.\nPre-production\nWith James Cameron as potential director, the film was to be produced with the same mix of live-action and computer-generated imagery that Cameron used in Avatar. Specifically, Cameron intended to render the main character, Alita, completely in CGI. Cameron had stated that he would make use of technologies developed for Avatar to produce the film, such as the Fusion Camera System, Facial motion capture, and the Simulcam. In May 2006, Variety reported that Cameron had spent the past ten months developing technology to produce the film.\nIn October 2018, Mark Goerner, a digital artist who had worked on the film for a year and a half, commented that pre-production work on the film was mostly finished. In a February 2019 interview, Cameron revealed that he set the floating city of Zalem in Panama, specifically Panama City. He explained that the city Zalem is not floating, but hanging from a space elevator, which would only work physically near the equator. As a result of the new location, Iron City was designed with Spanish signage and Latin American architecture.\nCasting\nAn April 2016 article in The Hollywood Reporter reported that Maika Monroe, Rosa Salazar, and Zendaya were among the final actresses being considered to take the role of Alita in the film, with a decision due within a few weeks. The article reported that Zendaya's former Shake It Up co-star Bella Thorne had also auditioned for the role. Near the end of May 2016, Collider reported that Salazar had been chosen. In August 2016, it was reported that Christoph Waltz was in negotiations to play Dr. Dyson Ido, the equivalent of Daisuke Ido from the original manga. On September 14, 2016, it was announced that Jackie Earle Haley had been cast as a cyborg villain. On September 21, 2016, Variety reported that Ed Skrein was in talks for a role in the film; The Hollywood Reporter later confirmed that he had been cast as the antagonist Zapan.\nOn September 30, 2016, Keean Johnson was reported to have been cast in the film to play Hugo, Alita's love interest, who later becomes the reason for her to play a gladiator-style game called Motorball. The studio also considered Avan Jogia, Douglas Booth, Jack Lowden, and Noah Silver for the role, but decided on Johnson because they were looking for someone more \"ethnically ambiguous.\" On October 3, 2016, Mahershala Ali was reportedly in talks for the villainous role of Vector, a man who rigs Motorball combat matches. In an interview following his Best Supporting Actor win at the 89th Academy Awards, Ali revealed that he would play two roles in the film, although he did not elaborate on the nature of the second role.\nOn October 5, 2016, it was reported that Eiza González had joined the film. González is one of the leads in Rodriguez's television series From Dusk till Dawn: The Series. Jorge Lendeborg Jr. was announced for a role in the film on October 7, 2016. He would play Hugo's friend. Lana Condor was reported to have joined the cast on October 11, 2016, portraying the orphaned teen Koyomi. On October 18, 2016, Leonard Wu was cast as the cyborg Kinuba. Marko Zaror joined the cast as the cyborg Ajakutty in December 2016. On February 7, 2017, Jennifer Connelly joined the film in an unknown villainous role. Michelle Rodriguez was retroactively announced for a role on February 22, 2017, after the film had completed shooting.\nFilming\nThe film began shooting at Robert Rodriguez's Troublemaker Studios in Austin, Texas on October 17, 2016, and concluded on February 9, 2017. In late January 2017, a casting call went out looking for rocker, punk, or emo extras to film scenes in Austin on the nights of February 3, 6 and 7, 2017.\nSalazar went through \"five months of exhaustive martial arts training\" to prepare for the action sequences in the film, learning Eagle Claw Kung Fu, Muay Thai, and staff work. James Cameron also decided that the film would pay homage to Bruce Lee, seen through Alita's punching technique during a scene where she practises in front of a mirror.\nVisual effects\nThe visual effects were provided by Weta Digital, DNEG and Framestore and supervised by Joe Letteri, Eric Saindon, Nick Epstein, Raymond Chen and Nigel Denton-Howes. Weta Digital was the main visual effect company for the Alita digital puppet, which required the company to redesign its motion capture methods to motion capture all the subtleties and complexities of Salazar's performance.\nMusic\nOn December 17, 2018, it was announced that English-Albanian singer Dua Lipa would have a song featured on the film's soundtrack titled \"Swan Song.\" The song and official music video were released on January 24, 2019, with the official music video directed by Floria Sigismondi. Tom Holkenborg composed the score for the film as well as the song \"Swan Song\" as a co-writer. The soundtrack album for the film was released digitally on February 14, 2019 by Milan Records, with a physical release, the following day.\nMarketing\nThe teaser trailer for the film was released on December 8, 2017, with a July 2018 release in mind. The footage received a mixed response, with a majority of the commentary focusing on the appearance of the titular character, Alita. Andrew Liptak of The Verge stated that \"The character looks like an anime doll come to life, or like a Disney character that's just a hair off from normal. It's probably a deliberate choice, meant to remind viewers at every moment that Alita isn't human. But after so many years of CGI animators trying to mimic convincing human faces and not entirely succeeding, it's still unsettling to see a character hovering this close to realistic, while staying this far away from it.\" Adam Chitwood of Collider was intrigued and cautiously optimistic, saying, \"This thing looks bonkers, and now it's crystal clear why Cameron was considering directing this in the first place. The choice to make your protagonist a photo-real CGI creation interacting with actual human characters is mighty ambitious, and I can say with certainty this doesn't look like anything Robert Rodriguez has done before. I don't know if it'll be good, but it definitely seems like it'll at least be interesting.\"\nThe first trailer was shown at SDCC 2018 and made its way online on July 23, 2018, with a December 2018 release in mind. The trailer featured a cover of Linkin Park's \"New Divide,\" covered by composer J2 featuring vocalist Avery. The third trailer was released in November 2018, almost a year after the first trailer was launched.\nA tie-in novel was released on November 20, 2018, written by sci-fi author Pat Cadigan. Entitled Iron City, the novel's story acted as a prequel focused on some of the residents living in Iron City before the events of the film. An audiobook adaptation of the novel was also released on the same date, narrated by Brian Nishii. Alongside the release of the film, another novel titled ''Dr. Ido's Journal by Nick Aires was published on February 19, 2019. Three hundred limited-edition copies of The Art and Making of the Movie'' by Abbie Bernstein were signed by Robert Rodriguez. The official novelization of the film was released on the same date, written by Pat Cadigan.\nIn January 2019, Cameron and 20th Century Fox collaborated with Open Bionics to give 13-year-old double amputee Tilly Lockey a pair of Alita-inspired bionic Hero Arms for the film's London premiere. In February 2019, 20th Century Fox collaborated with Iam8bit to create \"Passport to Iron City,\" a recreation of the film's setting for fans to tour. \"Passport to Iron City\" is available in New York City, Los Angeles, and Austin.\nRelease\nTheatrical\nThe film held its world premiere on January 31, 2019, at the Odeon Leicester Square in London, and was released by 20th Century Fox in the United States on February 14, 2019. It was originally set to be released on July 20, 2018, but in February 2018, the film was delayed to December 21 before later being pushed back again in late September to its final release date, with a PG-13 cut of Deadpool 2 taking its place.\nOn January 28, 2019, Cameron announced that the film would hold free one-day previews in the United States on January 31, 2019, before the general release. It was also released in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Macau, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan on February 5, 2019, marking Chinese New Year. the Philippines on February 6, India on February 8, and Japan and Mainland China on February 22. It is also notable for being the final film from Fox to be released as a stand alone studio, as a month later on March 20, 2019, the studio was acquired by The Walt Disney Company and would distribute future films under them starting with the release of Breakthrough.\nLawsuit\nOn January 30, 2019, Epic Stone Group, a Florida-based multimedia company, sued 20th Century Fox for trademark infringement over the \"Battle Angel\" name. The lawsuit claims that Epic Stone Group had filed the trademark for \"Battle Angel\" in 2009 for computer games, action figures and other merchandise, and it had filed a new application in April 2018 to use the name on DVDs, e-books, films and television programs. On May 30, 2019, Epic Stone Group filed to dismiss their trademark infringement suit against 20th Century Fox.\nHome media\nAlita: Battle Angel was released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on digital platforms on July 9, 2019, with Blu-ray, 4K Ultra HD and DVD releases following on July 23.

Rivkin and Ian Silverstein is enough to power through any narrative bumps with quickly paced action and bleak, yet colorful, imagery\" and gave the film 2.5 out of 4. Emily Yoshida of New York magazine was critical of the film but ultimately found it charming, and praised Salazar's performance \"The only reason any of this works at all is Salazar and, I hate to say it, those goddamned big eyes. They're the windows to the soul, after all, and this ungainly, lurching cyborg of a would-be blockbuster has more of that than meets the eye.\" Jeffrey Anderson gave the film 2 out of 5 stars, and noted that \"This juggernaut-sized sci-fi movie mechanically rehashes a huge collection of genre clichés while bashing its way through an onslaught of visual effects, bad dialogue, and dull, lifeless characters. Co-written by James Cameron and directed by Robert Rodriguez, Alita: Battle Angel feels lost in a bubble; it's clueless about the real world, about real emotions, or about any other, grindingly similar movies that have come out in the real world.\"\nKishiro praised the movie adaptation, claiming it to be \"the greatest movie in the world.\" He added, \"Every time I see, I can find something new. The composition is amazing. All scenes are special and there are no unneeded ones. It is so exciting that I can't believe that I created the original story. The core part of the manga was brilliantly passed on to the film. Including the characters' emotion and raison d'être, they were perfectly reflected in the film, so I was very happy.\"\nAccolades\nIn addition to the numerous awards and nominations, Alita: Battle Angel was submitted for consideration in the Best Visual Effects category at the 92nd Academy Awards, but failed to get shortlisted.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Award\n! scope=\"col\"| Date of ceremony\n! scope=\"col\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |Annie Awards\n|January 25, 2020\n|Outstanding Achievement for Character Animation in a Live Action Production\n|Michael Cozens\n|\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |Austin Film Critics Association\n|January 7, 2020\n|Best Motion Capture/Special Effects Performance\n|Rosa Salazar\n|\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |Dragon Awards\n|August 7, 2019\n|Best Science Fiction or Fantasy Movie\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Alita: Battle Angel\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Florida Film Critics Circle\n|December 23, 2019\n|Best Visual Effects\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" scope=\"row\" |Golden Schmoes Awards\n| rowspan=\"3\" |February 8, 2020\n|Most Underrated Movie of the Year\n|\n|\n|-\n|Best Sci-Fi Movie of the Year\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|Best Special Effects of the Year\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" |Hollywood Critics Association\n| rowspan=\"2\" |January 10, 2020\n|Best Visual Effects or Animated Performance\n|Rosa Salazar\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|Best Visual Effects\n|Joe Letteri, Eric Saindon and Nick Epstein\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |Hollywood Professional Association\n|November 21, 2019\n|Outstanding Visual Effects – Theatrical Feature\n|Eric Saindon, Michael Cozens, Dejan Momcilovic, Mark Haenga, Kevin Sherwood\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Hollywood Music In Media Awards\n|November 20, 2019\n|Best Original Score in a Sci-Fi/Fantasy Film\n|Tom Holkenborg\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Imagen Awards\n|August 12, 2019\n|Best Actress – Feature Film\n|Rosa Salazar\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |ReFrame Stamp\n|February 26, 2020\n|Top 100-Grossing Narrative Feature\n|20th Century Fox\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" scope=\"row\" |Satellite Awards\n| rowspan=\"3\" |December 19, 2019\n|Best Animated or Mixed Media Film\n|Alita: Battle Angel\n|\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|Best Visual Effects\n|Joe Letteri and Eric Saindon\n|\n|-\n|Best Original Song\n|\"Swan Song\" – Tom Holkenborg, Dua Lipa\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"row\" | Saturn Awards\n| September 13, 2019\n| Best Science Fiction Film\n|Alita: Battle Angel\n|\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |Seattle Film Critics Society\n|December 16, 2019\n|Best Visual Effects\n|Joe Letteri, Eric Saindon and Nick Epstein\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" |St. Louis Film Critics Association\n| rowspan=\"2\" |December 15, 2019\n|Best Action Film\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Alita: Battle Angel\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|Best Visual Effects\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"5\" scope=\"row\" | Visual Effects Society Awards\n| rowspan=\"5\" scope=\"row\" |January 29, 2020\n| Outstanding Visual Effects in a Photoreal Feature\n| Richard Hollander, Kevin Sherwood, Eric Saindon, Richard Baneham and Bob Trevino\n|\n| rowspan=\"5\" scope=\"row\" |\n|-\n| Outstanding Animated Character in a Photoreal Feature\n| Michael Cozens, Mark Haenga, Olivier Lesaint and Dejan Momcliovic\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Created Environment in a Photoreal Feature\n| John Stevenson-Galvin, Ryan Arcus, Mathias Larserud and Mark Tait\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Virtual Cinematography in a CG Project\n| Emile GhorayebSimon JungNick EpsteinMike Perry\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Compositing in a Photoreal Feature\n| Adam BradleyCarlo ScadutoHirofumi TakedaBen Roberts\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |Washington D.C.

Additionally, the uncredited cameos by Michelle Rodriguez and Jai Courtney were meant to set up larger roles in a sequel.\nIn April 2020, Christoph Waltz stated that he had not heard any discussions about a potential sequel to the film, and thought the possibility was unlikely following Disney's acquisition of 20th Century Fox as it may not fit in with the Disney culture. However, in January 2021, Robert Rodriguez said that he was hoping that a sequel to the film would be made. Later on, during an interview with \"The Nerdy Basement,\" Rodriguez claimed that he would try pitching an Alita sequel if The Book of Boba Fett series, directed by him, succeeded in \"knock[ing people's socks off.\" In December 2022, Rodriguez and Cameron took a virtual blood oath to make a sequel. In April 2023, producer Jon Landau confirmed that the sequel was in active development with Rodriguez and Rosa Salazar returning as director and star, respectively. In July the same year, James Cameron reiterated that he is working on more than one sequel. In November 2025, Cameron stated that Rodriguez and him were working on the script together and that they were committed to making it.\nLegacy\nIn September 2020, a social media campaign took place with fans petitioning for U.S. cinema chain Cinemark to re-release the film in theaters before the end of the year as a way to gauge public interest in a potential sequel. Cinemark quickly responded stating that they were considering it. On October 7, James Cameron confirmed that the film would indeed be returning to select theaters on October 30 while voicing support for #AlitaArmy. Director Robert Rodriguez also voiced his support for the movement. Regal Cinemas and AMC Theatres also confirmed that the film would be shown in their theaters before the former announced the temporary closure of their locations due to diminishing returns as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was re-released in theatres on October 30, 2020.\nAbout the film's reception, Rodriguez said, \"The fans still didn't let anyone forget that they loved that movie. It's almost better than having a movie that does really well but no one remembers in 6 to 8 years.\"\nReferences\nBibliography\n* 2018: Pat Cadigan: Alita: Battle Angel - Iron City (Prequel-Novel), Titan Books,\n* 2019: Pat Cadigan: Alita: Battle Angel - The Official Movie Novelization, Titan Books,\n* 2019: Abbie Bernstein: Alita: Battle Angel - The Art and Making of the Movie, Titan Books,\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*"
