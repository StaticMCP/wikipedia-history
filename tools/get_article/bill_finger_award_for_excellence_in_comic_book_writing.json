The awards committee, chaired by Mark Evanier, is charged each year with selecting two recipients, one living and one deceased. In 2020 and 2021, when the awards could not be presented in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic there were six deceased honorees each year and no living ones.\nThe award, along with the Eisner Awards, is presented in July of each year at the annual San Diego Comic-Con. It was established by Bill Finger's colleague and fellow writer Jerry Robinson.\nEvanier in 2003 said the premise of the award was \"to recognize writers for a body of work that has not received its rightful reward and/or recognition. That was what Jerry Robinson intended as his way of remembering his friend, Bill Finger. Bill is still kind of the industry poster boy for writers not receiving proper reward or recognition.\"\nRecipients\n*2005 – Jerry Siegel (deceased), Arnold Drake\n*2006 – Harvey Kurtzman (deceased), Alvin Schwartz\n*2007 – Gardner Fox (deceased), George Gladir\n*2008 – Archie Goodwin (deceased), Larry Lieber\n*2009 – John Broome (deceased), Frank Jacobs\n*2010 – Otto Binder (deceased), Gary Friedrich\n*2011 – Bob Haney (deceased),\n*2012 – Frank Doyle (deceased), Steve Skeates\n*2013 – Steve Gerber (deceased), Don Rosa\n*2014 – Robert Kanigher (deceased), Bill Mantlo, Jack Mendelsohn\n*2015 – Don McGregor, John Stanley (deceased)\n*2016 – Elliot S!
