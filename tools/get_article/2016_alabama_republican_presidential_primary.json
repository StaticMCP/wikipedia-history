This was the fifth primary held in the 2016 Republican primary. Donald Trump won the primary handily. The election was also held on Super Tuesday. Trump eventually won the Republican primary. He was elected President of the United States on November 8, 2016, against Hillary Clinton.\nAhead of the primary, Alabama was considered one of Donald Trump's strongest states. Trump enjoyed the endorsement of Senator Jeff Sessions, who would later join his Department of Justice as Attorney General. Sessions was Trump's first endorsement in the U.S. Senate.\nCandidates\n* Donald Trump\n* Ted Cruz\n* Marco Rubio\n* John Kasich\n* Ben Carson\nEndorsements\n}}\nPolling\nAggregate polls\n{|

Trump carried 43% of Evangelicals compared to 22% for Ted Cruz, according to exit polls by Edison Research. Many pundits were perplexed by Trump's dominance among culturally conservative Southern whites who were expected to view him as immoral, but he benefitted from voters' racial, cultural, and economic angst that mattered more than shared values.\nReferences"
