Quartermaine on General Hospital. His last known acting credit was in 2011.\nEarly life\nBilly Warlock was born William Alan Leming in Gardena, California, the oldest of three siblings. He has a brother, Lance, and a sister, Rhonda. Their father, Dick Warlock ( Richard Anthony Leming), was a successful Hollywood stunt man (who did stunts for Kurt Russell and was the stunt driver in the Disney picture, The Love Bug).\nAfter graduation from Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, California in 1979, Warlock's father landed him a stunt job as Robin Williams's stunt double in a Mork & Mindy episode, one that was produced by Garry Marshall. Several months later, Warlock auditioned for Marshall and won his first major television role as Leopold \"Flip\" Phillips, Roger (Ted McGinley)'s brother and Marion Cunningham (Marion Ross)'s younger nephew, in the ninth and tenth seasons of Happy Days.\nCareer\nAs a young adult, Warlock had a small role in Halloween II (1981), and Lovely But Deadly (1981), directed by David Sheldon. He later appeared in Hotshot (1987), directed by Rick King, and played the lead role in the horror film Society (1989), directed by Brian Yuzna. The same year, Warlock appeared as an original cast member of Baywatch, where he played lifeguard Eddie Kramer for the first three seasons. In the early 1990s, he also was on the short-lived TV Series The Hat Squad, with Nestor Serrano and Don Michael Paul from 1992 to 1993, and portrayed Lyle Menendez in the 1994 television movie Honor Thy Father and Mother: The True Story of the Menendez Murders.\nWarlock starred on soap operas such as Days of Our Lives and General Hospital. In the latter, he portrayed A. J. Quartermaine from June 13, 1997, to December 11, 2003, and for several visits in 2005 from February 4 to February 11, when his character was presumed dead. He reprised the role from March 15 until April 26 when his character was actually murdered in his hospital room by Dr. Asher Thomas (Larry Poindexter) after he kidnapped his biological son, Michael Corinthos (Dylan Cash). On Days of Our Lives, Warlock portrayed Frankie Brady from 1986 to 1988, from 1990 to 1991, and again beginning in June 2005. In 1988, he won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series at the 15th Daytime Emmy Awards for his performance on the series. He was let go from the soap and his final airdate was November 2006. In spring 2007, he joined the cast of The Young and the Restless in the role of Ben Hollander, Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman)'s campaign manager. Warlock appeared on the show from May 2007 to January 2008.\nIn 2003, Warlock reprised his role of Eddie Kramer in the Baywatch: Hawaiian Wedding television film. The following year, he appeared in an off-Broadway revival production of The Normal Heart at the Public Theater in New York City. Charles Isherwood of Variety praised his performance as \"sincere and nicely understated.\" During the summer of 2010, Warlock appeared on As the World Turns as Anthony Blackthorn.\nPersonal life\nWarlock was once engaged to his Baywatch co-star Erika Eleniak, who had played his character Eddie's love interest on the show, Shauni McClain, as well. Warlock was married to soap actress Marcy Walker but they later divorced. He married former Days of our Lives and As the World Turns co-star Julie Pinson on August 26, 2006, in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nFilmography\nFilm\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Title\n!
