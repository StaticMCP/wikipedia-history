In response, the judges stated that they would assess each film on overall effectiveness, including its realization of purpose and quality of craftsmanship. As to the former issue, the judges agreed to reduce the number of Honourable Mentions and issue Special Mentions for films that had qualities worthy of recognition.\nSixty-eight films were submitted for this year's awards, which were presented by Imperial Oil president J. R. White.\nThe event's Master of Ceremonies was renowned photographer Yousuf Karsh.\nWinners\n*Film of the Year: The Seasons — Imperial Oil, Christopher Chapman producer and director\n*Theatrical Feature Length (Documentary): Not awarded\n*Theatrical Short: Farewell Oak Street — National Film Board of Canada, Gordon Burwash producer, Grant McLean director\n::Honourable Mention: Danish Seining — Atlantic Films and Electronics, Herman Noelle director\n::Honourable Mention: 'The Settler (L'Abatis) — National Film Board of Canada, Guy Glover producer, Bernard Devlin and Raymond Garceau directors\n*Non-Theatrical, Open: The Seasons — Imperial Oil, Christopher Chapman producer and director\n::Honourable Mention: Embryonic Development: The Chick — National Film Board of Canada, J.V.
