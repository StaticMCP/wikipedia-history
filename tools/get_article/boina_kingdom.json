Andrimandisoarivo was a son of Andriandahifotsy, the founder of the Sakalava Kingdom, and had that kingdom after a succession dispute for the north, where he founded his own kingdom. It was centered on Boina Bay in north-west Madagascar.\nBy the 1690s about 500 European pirates had set up bases of operation along the northern coast of Madagascar. Andrianamboniarivo had as his chief minister for a time Tom Similaho whose father was an English pirate and whose mother was a Malagasy woman.\nSome time after 1832 it was occupied by Imerina and was annexed by Madagascar in 1840. The last ruler of this kingdom was Queen Tsiomeko.\nBoina in the north west and Menabe in the west were the kingdoms sprong in the 18th century. The king of Boina was considered to be quasi-divine, interceding with god and ancestors. The land belonged to him. In the extreme north of the island the Antankarana kingdom paid tribute to Boina.\nRulers of Boina\nThe list of rulers of Boina:\n* c. 1690-1720 –  (Tsimanata)\n* c. 1720-1730 –  (Toakafa)\n* c. 1730-1760 –\n* c. 1760-1767 – Andrianahilitsy\n* 1767-1770 – Andrianiveniarivo\n* 1770-1771 – Andrianihoatra\n* 1771–1777 – Andrianikeniarivo\n* 1777–1778 – Andrianaginarivo (f)\n* 1778 – Tombola (f)\n* c. 1778–1808 – Ravahiny (f)\n* 1808–1822? – Tsimalomo\n* 1808 – Maka (Andrianaresy) (pretender)\n* 1822–1832 –\n* 1828–1829 – Oantitsy (f) – Regent\n* 1832–1836 – Oantitsy (f)\n* 1836–1840 – Tsiomeko (f)\nSee also\n*Boeny\nReferences\n* [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9080448/Boina Britannica]"
