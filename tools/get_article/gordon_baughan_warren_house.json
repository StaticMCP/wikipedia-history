The original section was built about 1835, and is a -story, Greek Revival style vernacular frame dwelling. It was subsequently enlarged over the years in at least three building campaigns – c. 1860, c. 1910, and c. 1920.  The house is seven-bays wide and has an irregular plan.  Also on the property are the contributing guesthouse (c. 1860) and a garage (c. 1860, c. 1910).\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.\nReferences"
