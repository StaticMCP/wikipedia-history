After Emanuel Steward died in 2012, SugarHill worked with some of his uncle's former fighters, including Adonis Stevenson, Anthony Dirrell and Charles Martin.\nTyson Fury\nAfter Fury parted ways with former trainer Ben Davison in December 2019, Steward was appointed as Fury's head trainer, despite having been in conversations with Fury to join the team in a different role. At the time, Steward's existing clients were less prominent fighters such as Shohjahon Ergashev and Apti Davtaev.\nAfter Fury's victory in a rematch against Deontay Wilder in February 2020, Steward paid tribute to his uncle, saying: \"Emanuel Steward is smiling down from heaven. He knew Tyson Fury would become a champion way back then.\"\nIn September 2020, Steward arrived in the U.K. to prepare Fury for a planned trilogy fight with Deontay Wilder, despite hinting he would retire as a professional trainer after the second Wilder fight.\nFollowing on from Fury's knockout win over Wilder in the second fight, Fury retained Steward as his head coach for a trilogy fight between the two heavyweights. The trilogy fight ended in a knockout win for Tyson Fury culminating in the end of a three-year rivalry and resulting in Steward getting his first heavyweight title defense as a head coach.\nBenjamin Whittaker\nIn 2022 SugarHill Steward became Benjamin Whittaker's trainer, as Whittaker had signed a professional deal with Boxxer.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://kronkgym.com Kronk Gym]"
