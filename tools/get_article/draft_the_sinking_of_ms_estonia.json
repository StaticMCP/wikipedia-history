      "text": "# Draft:The Sinking Of Ms Estonia\n\nBold text\nMs Estonia sank on 1994 september 28 at 1am, carryng over 900 passangers and crew members.\nThe bow visor probably fell off. But MS Estonia sank too quickly for that to be the only reason. It needs to be hole/holes below the water line for everything to happen that fast.\nOtherwise the ship would've capsized and stayed floating for a while, because of air being \"stuck\" in the ship.\nInterestingly enough, the investigation made by the German shipyard in the 90's claimed that MS Estonia was sunk by several explosions. They claimed that the visor was blown off, and that there should be additional holes below the water line. Now, almost 30 years later, it seems like they might have been the one's with the correct assumption all along.\nLast year a hole below the water line was found by a documentary crew filming with a ROV\nThat find forced the Swedish and Estonian accident investigation board to resume the investigation. They also dived with a ROV, and ended up finding another hole.\nAnd as if that ain't enough. Parts of the bow visor was transported to Norway's University of technology in Trondheim. They made tests that concluded that the visor had been exposed to extremely high temperatures.\nSafe to say that the horrible story of MS Estonia is far from over.\nDiving Video: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYlz1HMUsxY&feature=youtu.be).\nHere is a good video with English subtitels:(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zup7OxqMyoo&feature=youtu.be).\nSources: Reddit, Youtube, Tv documentaries and Simulations"
