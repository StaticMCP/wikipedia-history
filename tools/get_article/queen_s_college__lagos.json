Often referred to as the \"sister college\" of King's College, Lagos, it was founded on October 10, 1927, when Nigeria was still a British colony.\nNigeria has a 6-3-3-4 system of education. Queen's College takes the secondary pupils in the middle two phases. There are six year groups, or grades; each year group contains about 600 students divided into several arms. Recently, class sizes are an average of 55 per class. The total population for the 2022/2023 session was 3505 students.\nThe school has returned the best results nationwide in the West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) conducted by the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) seven times since 1985 and is widely considered to be one of the top schools in Nigeria, and one of the top girls' schools on the African continent. The Queen's College motto is \"Pass On The Torch\".\nHistory\nQueen's College was established on October 10, 1927, with an enrolment of 20 students, a Principal and eight part-time teachers. Sylvia Leith-Ross was appointed \"Lady Superintendent of Education\" in 1925 and she helped to establish Queen's College as a girls' boarding school.\nQueen's College has grown to a population 3000 students, and a staff strength of well over 300 full-time teachers.\nQueen's College has provided education for girls in Nigeria - creating equal gender opportunities for them in professional fields. Girls are given the opportunity to pursue courses in the Sciences, Medicine, Engineering, Law, Architecture, the Arts, etc.\nThough originally established in 1927, Queen's College is now one of 104 unity schools in Nigeria managed by the federal government to bring together children from different geographic, ethnic, and socio-economic backgrounds to build Nigeria's future, especially in the aftermath of the Biafran War.\nStructure\nThe school operates at two levels: junior and senior school. The lowest forms, JS I to JS III, make up the junior school. Students in those forms study for the Junior School Certificate Examination conducted by the National Examination Council (NECO) and taken at the end of their third year. The Senior School Examination is the goal of the students in the upper forms.\nTwo examination bodies – West African Examinations Council and National Examinations Council – are each empowered to conduct separately the end-of-course examination and students are to enter for both examinations.\nThe senior and junior schools are distinct in their operations. Each stream of JS 1 through SS 3 has about eleven classrooms with varying numbers of students.\nFor management of both sections, the school is headed by the principal, designated PQC (Principal Queen's College) who is assisted by six vice principals:\n* The Vice Principal Administration\n* The Vice Principal Special Duties\n* The Vice Principal Academics 1\n* The Vice Principal Academics 2\n* The Vice Principal Student Affairs 1\n* The Vice Principal Student Affairs 2\nCurriculum\nThe curriculum of the school covers Science, Social Science, Arts -and vocational subjects as well as co-curricular activities. In line with the 6-3-3 4 system of education, the scope has been enlarged to give a broad-based education with subjects that can lead to courses in tertiary institutions. Staff and twelve Guidance Counselors are available to assist students in learning, in their choice of career, social adjustment, as well as their welfare.\nSubjects offered in both Junior and Senior schools are:\n* English Language, Literature-in-English, History\n* Mathematics, Further mathematics\n* Social Studies, Geography\n* Integrated Science (Biology, Chemistry and Physics)\n* French Language\n* Business Studies, Economics, Commerce, Accounting\n* Introductory Technology\n* Christian Religious Studies/Islamic Religious Studies\n* Nigerian language - Yoruba/Hausa/Igbo Languages\n* Agric/PHE\n* Arabic\n* Music/Fine art\n* Home Economics\n* Typewriting\n* Computer Studies\n* Government\n* Trading\n* Insurance/Book -keeping\n* Home economics/Food And Nutrition/Clothing And Textile.\nThe girls are involved in games and sports.
