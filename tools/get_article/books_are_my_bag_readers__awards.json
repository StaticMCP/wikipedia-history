They are sponsored by National Book Tokens.\nHistory and administration\nThe awards were launched at the 2016 Booksellers Association conference with the aim of being the first literary awards voted for by the public. A shortlist of books is voted for by bookshops who are members of the Booksellers Association, and the winner of each category is chosen by an online public vote, with over 40,000 people voting in the 2017 awards. The ceremony takes place in November in Foyles bookshop in London.\nIn 2016, the awards were presented in seven categories: Fiction, Non-Fiction, Biography & Autobiography, Children's, Beautiful Book, Breakthrough Author and Readers' Choice.\nIn 2017, the Fiction category was renamed Popular Fiction, and three extra categories were added: Novel, Young Adult and Middle Grade. The number of categories and their names continues to fluctuate.\nShortlist and winners\n2016 to 2023\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Year !! Category !! Shortlists !!
