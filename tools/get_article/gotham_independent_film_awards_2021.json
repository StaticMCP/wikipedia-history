Collins received her tribute award posthumously.\nCeremony information\nStarting with this ceremony, the awards for Best Actor and Best Actress were replaced by two new, gender neutral award categories: Outstanding Lead Performance and Outstanding Supporting Performance. Furthermore, a gender neutral award category for acting in a series, called Outstanding Performance in a New Series, was added. These three new categories each have up to ten nominees instead of the usual five. In addition to these changes to the acting categories, an award for Breakthrough Nonfiction Series was created for this ceremony.\nWinners and nominees\nFilm\n{| class=\"wikitable\" role=\"presentation\"\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n*The Lost Daughter\n** The Green Knight\n** Passing\n** Pig\n** Test Pattern\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n* 'The Lost Daughter – Maggie Gyllenhaal'\n** The Card Counter – Paul Schrader\n** El Planeta – Amalia Ulman\n** The Green Knight – David Lowery\n** Passing – Rebecca Hall\n** Red Rocket – Sean Baker and Chris Bergoch\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n* Flee\n** Ascension\n** Faya Dayi\n** President\n** Summer of Soul (...Or, When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n*Drive My Car\n** Azor\n** The Souvenir Part II\n** Titane\n** What Do We See When We Look at the Sky?\n** The Worst Person in the World\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n* 'Maggie Gyllenhaal – The Lost Daughter'\n** Edson Oda – Nine Days\n** Rebecca Hall – Passing\n** Emma Seligman – Shiva Baby\n** Shatara Michelle Ford – Test Pattern\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n* 'Emilia Jones – CODA  as Ruby Rossi'\n** Natalie Morales – Language Lessons as Cariño\n** Rachel Sennott – Shiva Baby as Danielle\n** Suzanna Son – Red Rocket as Strawberry\n** Amalia Ulman – El Planeta as Leonor Jimenez\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n* 'Olivia Colman – The Lost Daughter as Leda Caruso (TIE)\n* Frankie Faison – The Killing of Kenneth Chamberlain as Kenneth Chamberlain Sr. (TIE)'\n** Michael Greyeyes – Wild Indian as Makwa\n** Brittany S.
