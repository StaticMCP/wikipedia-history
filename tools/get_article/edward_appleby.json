He is a two-time British national champion. On the junior level, he is the 2021 JGP France II bronze medalist, 2020 Mentor Toruń Cup junior men's champion, and a two-time British junior national champion.\nPersonal life\nEdward Appleby was born in Colchester, England. His older brother, Elliot, is also a figure skater and competes in men's singles and pairs skating.\nCareer\nEarly years\nAppleby began learning to skate in 2009. In October 2018, he debuted on the ISU Junior Grand Prix (JGP) circuit, finishing eighteenth in Ljubljana, Slovenia. He placed thirty-sixth at the 2019 World Junior Championships and twenty-sixth at the 2020 World Junior Championships.\n2021–22 season\nIn late August, Appleby won bronze in Courchevel, France, at the second event of the 2021–22 ISU Junior Grand Prix season. It was the first Junior Grand Prix medal won by a British skater in almost 20 years. In April, he qualified to the final segment at the 2022 World Junior Championships in Tallinn, Estonia. Ranked eighteenth in the short program and twenty-first in the free skate, he finished twentieth overall.\n2022–23 season\nAppleby made his senior ISU Grand Prix debut at the 2022 MK John Wilson Trophy, where he placed last overall. At the British Figure Skating Championships, he competed in the senior category for the first time and placed second behind Graham Newberry. He was selected to compete at the 2023 World Junior Championships, where he placed seventeenth.\n2023–24 season\n]]\nCompeting in the 2023–24 ISU Junior Grand Prix series, Appleby placed sixth at the 2023 JGP Austria and fourth at the 2024 JGP Poland. In December, Appleby won his first senior national title at the 2024 British Championships. The week after, he competed at the Golden Spin of Zagreb, where he placed sixth and achieved the technical minimums to be eligible for the 2024 World Figure Skating Championships. At his first European Championships, he placed twenty-fifth in the short program and did not advance to the free skate.\nAppleby was assigned to the 2024 World Junior Championships, and finished ninth, his highest-ever placement at the event. Weeks later, he competed at the 2024 World Championships, placing thirty-eighth in the short program and failing to advance to the free skate.\n2024–25 season\nPrior to the season, Appleby added Alina Mayer-Virtanen to his coaching team, making frequent trips to Laukaa, Finland to work with her, while also continuing to train in Romford with John Wicker. He ultimately began the season with a sixth-place finish at the 2024 CS Nebelhorn Trophy. He would then go on to finish fifth at the 2024 Tayside Trophy. Continuing to compete on the 2024–25 ISU Challenger Series, he finished seventh at the 2024 CS Nepela Memorial.\nIn December, Appleby won his second consecutive national title at the 2025 British Championships. The following month, he competed at the 2025 European Championships in Tallinn, Estonia, where he finished twentieth overall.\nShortly before the 2025 World Championships, Appleby left his longtime coach, John Wicker, and relocated to Swindon to train under Christopher Boyadji and Lloyd Jones. In addition, he continued working with Alina Mayer-Virtanen in Laukaa. At the World Championships, he placed thirty-second in the short program and did not advance to the free skate segment.\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Season\n!Short program\n!Free skating\n!
