The term \"Ancient North Arabian\" is defined negatively. It refers to all of the South Semitic scripts except Ancient South Arabian (ASA) regardless of their genetic relationships.\nClassification\nMany scholars believed that the various ANA alphabets were derived from the ASA script, mainly because the latter was employed by a major civilization and exhibited more angular features. Others believed that the ANA and ASA scripts shared a common ancestor from which they both developed in parallel. Indeed, it seems unlikely that the various ANA scripts descend from the monumental ASA alphabet, but that they collectively share a common ancestor to the exclusion of ASA is also something which has yet to be demonstrated.\nThe hypothesis that all ANA alphabets derive from a single ancestor gave rise to the idea that the languages which these scripts express constitute a linguistic unity, a so-called ANA language. As a hypothetical language or group of languages, Ancient North Arabian forms one branch of the North Arabian group, the other being Proto-Arabic. They are distinguished from each other by the definite article, which in Arabic is ʾal-, but in ANA is h-. They belong to a different branch of the Semitic languages than the Ancient South Arabian languages.\nThe validity of this hypothesis has been called into question. This is particularly the case for Taymanitic, which has been determined to be a Northwest Semitic language. Safaitic and Hismaic are also now considered forms of Old Arabic due to shared features.\nGeographical distribution\nThe Ancient North Arabian scripts were used both in the oases (Dadanitic, Dumaitic, Taymanitic) and by the nomads (Hismaic, Safaitic, Thamudic B, C, D, and possibly Southern Thamudic aka Thamudic F) of central and northern Arabia.\nTable of letters\nAncient North Arabian script has a one-to-one correspondence with the Arabic alphabet except for 𐪏‎ and 𐪊‎ which correspond to .\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" id=\"letters_chart\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Ancient North Arabian Letter\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Phoneme\n! rowspan=\"2\" | IPA\n! colspan=\"8\" | Corresponding letter in\n|-\n!
