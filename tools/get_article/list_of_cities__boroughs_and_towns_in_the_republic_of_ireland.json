The first tier consisted of administrative counties and county boroughs. The county boroughs were in the major municipal population centres. The second tier consisted of urban districts, governed by urban district councils; some of the urban district retained a higher status of borough with a corporation. Below that were towns with town commissioners, administered under the Towns Improvement (Ireland) Act 1854.\nUnder the Local Government Act 2001, administrative counties and county boroughs were redesignated as counties and cities respectively. The lower tier consisted of boroughs and towns (including both former urban districts and towns administered by town commissioners).\nUnder the Local Government Reform Act 2014, only Dublin, Cork and Galway retain separate city councils. Limerick and Waterford were merged into the corresponding county councils and all borough and town councils were abolished. Municipal districts were created from local electoral areas with councillors being those elected to the county councils. In the case of Limerick and Waterford, these are called Metropolitan Districts; in the case of Drogheda, Wexford, Sligo and Clonmel, these are called Borough Districts; and in the case of Kilkenny, it is called the Municipal District of Kilkenny City.\nExplanation of table\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Column name !! Meaning !! Explanation !! Sources\n|-\n! Name(s)\n| Names of the town\n| The first name listed is the commonest English name, and links to the relevant article. Alternative names are listed in parentheses. If the official name used in census reports is not the linked name, it is in italics. Only the name of the municipality is given, not that of any suburban areas (e.g. Tallaght is not named separately from Dublin).\n|\n|-\n!Council\n|Type of municipal council\n|The Local Government Act 2001 defines three types of municipal council, namely \"City\", \"Borough\", and \"Town\". The \"Town council\" label replaced the earlier \"Urban district council\" and \"Town commissioners\", but did not abolish the distinction in their respective powers. Values listed in this column are as follows:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!City\n|For the 5 former county boroughs with the same powers as county councils.\n|-\n!Borough\n|For the few ancient boroughs whose charters were not extinguished by the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840 or promoted to the status later. Their powers were practically identical to those of the former urban districts and later town councils, but the label \"borough\" was more prestigious. Abolished in 2014.\n|-\n!UD\n|Area which was governed by an urban district under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 and a town council under the Local Government Act 2001. Abolished in 2014.\n|-\n!Comm\n|Area which was governed by town commissioners under the Towns Improvement (Ireland) Act 1854, less powerful than an urban district council, and a town council under the Local Government Act 2001. Abolished in 2014.\n|}\n|\n|-\n! Core County\n| Core county for town || County is that in which the municipal area is entirely located. In the case of cities, the namesake county is considered the core county even though the city is administratively separate from it.\n|\n|-\n! Other Counties\n| Other counties || For towns whose suburbs/environs span a county boundary, any county other than the core county.\n|\n|-\n! 2011 Tot\n| Total population in 2011. || Sum of the municipal population and the suburban population.\n|\n|-\n! Tot area\n| Total area of the town || 2011 area in square kilometres (km2). Only for towns with a total population of at least 1,500.\n|\n|-\n! Tot dens\n| Population density of total area || Persons per km2. Based on 2011 total area and population.\n| Calculated\n|-\n! 2011 Mun\n| Population of the municipal area in 2011 || Population within the 2011 municipal area.\n|\n|-\n! % change Mun\n| Change in population of the municipal area. || As a percentage of 2006 population. Where the municipal area changed in the interim, this is noted.\n| Calculated. For changed areas:\n|-\n! Mun area\n| Municipal area of the town || Area within the legally defined municipal boundary in 2011. Where this had increased since 2006, this is noted.\n| For changed areas:\n|-\n! Mun dens\n| Population density of municipal area || Persons per km2. Based on 2011 municipal area and population.\n| Calculated\n|-\n! 2009 elect\n| Electorate for the 2009 local elections. || The Local Government Act 1994 extended the boundaries of some towns for electoral purposes only. That is, people living outside the municipal area were entitled to vote for the town council even though their residence was outside its jurisdiction. In a few cases, the municipal boundary of the town was subsequently extended to remove this anomaly. The remaining cases are marked by an asterisk in this column. Where the municipal area changed between the 2006 census and the 2009 election, this is noted. (No municipal area changed between the 2009 election and the 2011 census.)\n|\n|-\n! 2011 Sub\n| Population of the suburbs/environs in 2011 || Called \"Suburbs\" for cities and \"Environs\" for boroughs and towns. Defined as \"the continuation of a distinct population cluster outside its legally defined boundary in which no occupied dwelling is more than 100 metres distant from the nearest occupied dwelling. In applying the 100-metre criterion, industrial, commercial and recreational buildings and facilities are not regarded as breaking the continuity of a built-up area. New suburbs or environs are defined only where there are at least twenty occupied dwellings outside the legal boundary within the new limit.\" The 2006 definition was changed by reducing the limit from 200 metres to 100.\n|\n|}\nCities, boroughs and towns up to 2014\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
