He was the compiler of the historical text Book of the Later Han. The fourth son of Fan Tai (), Fan Ye was born in present-day Shaoxing, Zhejiang, but his ancestral home was in Nanyang, Henan. After his birth, he was made heir of another male relative Fan Hongzhi ().\nHe was a noted atheist who heavily criticised Buddhism, Yin and Yang, and the concept of the Mandate of Heaven. To this end, he cited Zhang Heng's scientific studies as evidence.\nIn January 446, Fan Ye was accused of rebellion and executed, along with many associates including his son Fan Ai ().\nAppearance and personality\nThe Book of Song described Fan as \"less than seven chi in height, fat and dark in complexion, with no eyebrows or beard\".\nWhen Fan Ye was young, his elder brother Fan Yan (范晏) frequently mentioned that Fan Ye was drawn towards advancing his interests and that this habit would bring disaster to their clan, which was what eventually happened.\nReferences\nSources\n*  }}\n*  }}\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*"
