The airplane arrived in Evansville the following February and was delivered to the University of Southern Indiana. The Commission attempted to raise money by holding a bingo game in 1991, but was accused of violating state gambling laws. A group called the P-47 Foundation, led by Andy Easley, purchased the project from the commission.\nFollowing Frank's death in 1992, his son Jim took over the project. The intent was to display it in the airport terminal that was under construction at the time. However, the airframe was destroyed on 18 March 1997 in a fire at the Franklin Industrial Center where it was being restored. Immediately following the fire, the foundation attempted to obtain an example from the Air Force Museum System, but was unsuccessful. It was also forced to return an engine that had been on loan.\nEstablishment\nIn 2013, plans were announced to open the Freedom Heritage Museum at the Evansville Regional Airport. The museum opened on 27 May 2017, shortly after changing its name to the Evansville Wartime Museum. It was finally able to acquire a P-47, Tarheel Tal, from the Lone Star Flight Museum in 2020. The airplane was repainted the following year as Hoosier Spirit II, to represent the first P-47 built in Indiana. Following an effort by the foundation, the P-47 was designated the official state aircraft of Indiana in 2021.\nThe museum was significantly damaged by a storm on 2 April 2024.\nExhibits\nThe museum has a number of galleries focused on World War I, World War II, the Korean War and Vietnam War as well as three flight simulators.\nCollection\nAircraft\n* Boeing N2S-1\n* Republic P-47D Thunderbolt\nGround vehicles\n* DUKW\n* M4A4 Sherman\nSee also\n* Indiana Military Museum, A  military museum in nearby Vincennes, Indiana\n* USS LST Ship Memorial Museum, A museum concentrating on Evansville's production of LSTs in Downtown Evansville\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.p47foundation.org Evansville P-47 Foundation]"
