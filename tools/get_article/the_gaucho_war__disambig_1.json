It is one of the most celebrated works of the Golden Age of Argentine cinema. The film's script, written by Homero Manzi and Ulyses Petit de Murat, is based on the novel by Leopoldo Lugones published in 1905. The film premiered in Buenos Aires on November 20, 1942 and is considered by critics of Argentine cinema to be one of the most successful films in history.\nIt won three Silver Condor awards, including Best Film, Best Director (Lucas Demare),  and  Best Adapted Screenplay  (Ulises Petit de Murat and Homero Manzi), given by the Argentine Film Critics Association at the  1943 Argentine Film Critics Association Awards for the best films and performances of the previous year.\nThe film is set in 1817 in the Salta Province of northwest Argentina during the Argentine War of Independence. It is based on the actions taken by the guerrillas under the command of the general Martin Güemes against the royalist army, loyal to the Spanish monarchy. For exterior filming, a village was established in the same area where the actual conflict had taken place. The cast of some thousand participants was unprecedented in Argentine cinema until that time.\nThe origins and content of the film are linked to a particular moment in Argentine history in which there was an intense debate over whether the country should take the side of either the Axis or the Allies during World War II, or maintain its neutrality during the war. The film stresses the values associated with nationalism as expressed in the union of the people, the army, and the church in defense of the country, which was considered by some a prelude to the revolutionary ideology that led to, on June 4, 1943, the overthrowing of the government of president Ramón Castillo.\nThe film was produced by Artistas Argentinos Asociados (Associated Argentine Artists), a cooperative of artists created just a short time before production began. It required an investment far beyond other productions of the period but the commercial success of the film allowed it to recover the cost in the first-run theaters, where it remained for nineteen weeks.\nIt was selected as the third greatest Argentine film of all time in the polls conducted by the Museo del Cine Pablo Ducrós Hicken in 1977 and 1984, while it ranked 7th in the 2000 edition. In a new version of the survey organized in 2022 by the specialized magazines La vida util, Taipei and La tierra quema, presented at the Mar del Plata International Film Festival, the film reached the 49 position.\nPlot\nPrologue\nThe film begins with a prologue on screen providing the historical circumstances of the place and time in which the action is placed, and advancing the position of its authors. From 1814 to 1818, General Martín Miguel de Güemes and his gauchos resisted the Spanish royalist armies that systematically ransacked the country, attacking Argentina's Northwest from the Spanish base in Upper Peru since the withdrawal of the country's regular troops. This conflict consisted in Guerrilla warfare movements designed by Güemes and constant small battles characterized by the heroism of the irregular patriot forces commanded by Güemes.\nThe opening states:\nSummary\n1817: in Argentina's Salta Province, during the War of Independence, the irregular gaucho forces commanded by General Martín Miguel de Güemes carry out a series of guerrilla actions against the Spanish Royalist Army. The commander of a Spanish army contingent, Lieutenant Villarreal, is wounded, captured by the guerrillas, and put under the medical care of Asunción, the mistress of an estancia. Asunción finds out from Villarreal's identification papers that the Lieutenant, though serving in the Spanish army, was born in Lima (Peru). She persuades him in understanding the importance and true justice of liberating America from Spain's colonial rule.\nThe patriot forces receive help from the Sacristan of a chapel located next to the grounds of the royalist troops. The sacristan fakes loyalty to the Spanish king, but in the midst of the battles he sends messages to the gaucho guerrillas hiding in the mountains by means of a messenger boy and by the ringing of a bell. When the royalists discover this, they attack and burn the chapel and smash the sacristan's eyes. Blinded, the sacristan unwittingly guides the royalists to the patriot camp. The royalists then proceed to annihilate the gauchos.\nAfter the battle, the only four survivors are the dying sacristan, an old man, a young boy, and Lieutenant Villarreal, who has fallen in love with Asunción and converted to the patriot cause. Though the group seems doomed, they suddenly see Güemes' arriving troops, which will continue the battle against the invader troops.\nCast\nÁngel Magaña, [[Enrique Muiño and Sebastián Chiola ]]\n*Enrique Muiño as Sacristán Lucero\n*Francisco Petrone (Francisco Antonio Petrecca Mesulla) as Capitán Miranda\n*Ángel Magaña as Teniente Villarreal\n*Sebastián Chiola as Capitán Del Carril\n*Amelia Bence as Asunción Colombres\n*Ricardo Galache\n*Dora Ferreiro\n*Elvira Quiroga\n*Juan Pérez Bilbao\n*Carlos Campagnale\n*Aquiles Guerrero\n*Roberto Combi\n*Amílcar Leveratto\n*Antonio Cytro\n*Carlos Enzo\n*Roberto Prause\n*René Mugica\n*Raúl Merlo\n*Ricardo Reinaldo\n*Alberto Contreras (son)\n*Antonia Rojas\n*Laura Moreno\n*José López\n*Jacinta Diana\nProduction\nThe novel\nLeopoldo Lugones (June 13, 1874 – February 18, 1938) was a prolific Argentine writer and journalist of whom Ricardo Rojas said:\nRojas, Ricardo, Historia de la literatura argentina, 4* edición, t. VIII pág. 638, Buenos Aires, 1957, Editorial Guillermo Kraft.}}\nTo write La guerra gaucha Lugones traveled to Salta Province, to visit the actual places where the events happened and to record the oral tradition of the area. It is an epic story composed of several histories described with a wide vocabulary full of metaphors. Dialogs are short, but descriptions and subjective vision are plentiful. The landscape characteristics and Salta's nature are described in detail and have great importance in the book.\nHistorical context in Argentina\nFrancisco Petrone in a scene from the film\nOn February 20, 1938 Roberto M. Ortiz became president of Argentina. A member of the Unión Cívica Radical Antipersonalista party, he expressed his intention of ending the systemic electoral fraud imposed since the 1930 military coup. This idea found resistance within the political coalition named \"The Concordance\" (\"La Concordancia\") to which he belonged. Finally the worsening of his diabetes forced him to relinquish the presidency to his vice president Ramón Castillo, first in provisionally and after June 27, 1942 permanently. The new president was not in agreement with Ortiz's policies and from his post he condoned the fraud practices, disappointing the followers who believed in the changes proposed by his predecessor.\nAt the start of World War II the Argentine government declared itself neutral (on September 4, 1939), repeating the position taken during the First World War (1914–1918). Great Britain supported the decision as it was interested in Argentina being neutral and continuing the supply of food during the war.\nIn December 1941, the United States of America declared war on the Axis powers after the attack on Pearl Harbor. In January 1942, the Third Consulting Meeting of Chancellors of the American Republics met in Rio de Janeiro as the U.S. wished other American nations to break relations with the Axis powers. Argentina, which had had frictions with the U.S. in previous years, was opposed to said goals and influenced successfully to \"recommend\" the breakup of relations instead of making it mandatory.\nThe problems associated with foreign policy took on more importance in Argentina and revived the conflict between the three political factions, the one pushing for siding with the Allies, the neutrals, and the one more in tune with the Axis. This latter minority group included the followers of nationalism and some officers of the army. The subject of the position the country should take on the war displaced other issues in the national political arena.\nStarting in the 1930s, and following a general tendency in Latin America, nationalist ideas were fortified in the countryside and many diverse sectors of Argentina. Political parties such as the Unión Cívica Radical, the Socialist Party of Argentina, and in the unions organized under the umbrella of the Confederación General del Trabajo the favorable currents for the State to become interventionist were growing, in order to push the preservation on the national interests and promote industrialization.\nThis ideological change was also observable in the cultural movements, with the vindication of the tango and the indigenous \"gaucho roots\". La guerra gaucha was then selected as the subject, written and filmed in the context of expansive nationalism and debates over issues of war.\nState of the film industry in Argentina\nIn 1938, 41 films opened and 16 new directors debuted. In 1939, the number increased to 51 films. Argentine cinema was very popular. In Mexico, almost all Argentine films were shown. In 1940, 49 films opened, despite the shortage of celluloid due to the war. In 1941, there were 47 openings and in 1942, 57.\nFrancisco Petrone\nArtistas Argentinos Asociados\nA group of unemployed artists, Enrique Muiño, Elías Alippi, Francisco Petrone, Ángel Magaña, the director Lucas Demare and the chief of production of a movie company Enrique Faustín (son) met regularly at the beginning of the 1940s at the \"El Ateneo\" cafe in Buenos Aires.\nThe Ateneo Group (\"Barra del Ateneo\") decided to found a cooperative film production company following the style of the American United Artists, so on September 26, 1941 they started \"Artistas Argentinos Asociados Sociedad Cinematográfica SRL\".\nOrigins of the film\nArtistas Argentinos Asociados had the idea of making this movie since the company had been established. Homero Manzi had the idea since he wrote the script to the film \"Viento Norte\" (\"North Wind\") and convinced director Lucas Demare of the project's viability. Francisco Petrone proposed that the script be written by Manzi and Ulyses Petit de Murat. The rights for the movie were purchased from Leopoldo \"Polo\" Lugones (son of the writer) for 10,000 pesos received two jazz records that were unavailable in the country.\nUlyses Petit de Murat, Lucas Demare y Homero Manzi\nMeanwhile, Elías Alippi, who would star in the role of captain Del Carril, fell ill with cancer (he would die on May 3, 1942). The company, knowing he was not in physical condition to survive the tough filming schedule and not wishing to replace him for another actor while he was alive, postponed the filming with an excuse and started to film El viejo Hucha (\"Old Man Hucha\"), in which he had no role.\nRemembering the proposal to write the screenplay, Ulyses Petit de Murat said:\nDue to having had spent all the budget needed for La guerra gaucha on El viejo Hucha, the partners at Artistas Argentinos Asociados decided to fund the film with their own fees. This financial effort was insufficient and they had to partner with San Miguel Studios and undersell the exhibition rights for the movie earlier in some areas. These decisions allowed them to make the film with \"a little less belt-tightening but without splurging\".''\nScript\nHomero Manzi\nHomero Manzi\nHomero Manzi was born November first of 1907 in Añatuya (province of Santiago del Estero), Argentina. He was interested in literature and tango since he was young. After a brief incursion in journalism, Manzi worked as a literature and castilian professor but for political reasons (in addition to his membership in the Unión Cívica Radical) he was expelled of his professorship and decided to dedicate himself to the arts.\nIn 1935 he participated on the beginnings of FORJA (Fuerza de Orientación Radical de la Joven Argentina – Force of Radical Orientation of the Young Argentina), a group whose position has been classified as “peoples nationalism”. It was centered in the problematic Argentina and Latin America and on its discussions suggested “reconquer the political Sunday from our own land” since it considered the country was still under a colonial situation. It supported neutrality in WWII on the premise that was no great interest was in play in Argentina or Latin America, it was more of a rejection position towards fascism just as much as communism.\nIn 1934, Manzi founded Micrófono (\"Microphone\") magazine which covered subjects related to radiotelephony, Argentine movies and film making. He wrote the screenplay for Nobleza Gaucha in 1937 in collaboration with Hugo Mac Dougall, and a remake of Huella (\"Footprint\") (1940), for which they received second prize from Buenos Aires City Hall and also Confesión (\"Confession\") (1940), without achieving commercial success with any of these movies.\nIn 1940 Manzi started what would be a long collaboration with Ulyses Petit de Murat, writing the screenplay for Con el dedo en el gatillo (\"Finger on the trigger\") (1940) and later Fortín alto (\"High Fort\") (1940).\nUlyses Petit de Murat\nUlyses Petit de Murat was born in Buenos Aires on January 28, 1907 and was interested in literature and journalism from a young age. He was in charge of the music page in the daily magazine Crítica and, with Jorge Luis Borges, co-directed its literary supplement.Ulyses Petit de Murat. In 1932 he moved to the motion film section of Crítica and in 1939 wrote his first cinematographic script for the movie Prisioneros de la Tierra, an adaptation of four tales of Horacio Quiroga, made with his son, Dario Quiroga, who later in 1940 wrote Con el Dedo en el Gatillo, with the collaboration of Homero Manzi.\nThe screenwriters started by selecting the stories that would provide them with the elements for the work. Dianas was chosen as the main source, some characters were taken from Alertas and some from other stories. They compiled the words, traditions, life styles and idioms from that era for which they used books and even a trip was made to Salta to talk with the locals. A script Then a text was made from the tales and a first draft of the images. At this point the director and actors collaborated with their comments and finally the final script was written.\nDirection\nBorn July 14, 1907 Demare was a music scholar. In 1928, he traveled to Spain as a bandoneón player for the Orchestra Típica Argentina, where his brother Lucio also played. In 1933 he worked as an interpreter and singer for Spanish movies Boliche and Aves sin rumbo. Lucas Demare\nDemare quit the orchestra and started working in the film industry; he quickly rose from chalkboard holder to director assistant. Some time later he was hired to debut as a director, but the civil war broke out and he returned to Buenos Aires.\nEmilio Zolezzi, aside from being a movie critic, was also the Artistas Argentinas Associados attorney. He tells about the director:  Zolezzi, Emilio, Noticias del viejo cine criollo, pág.84, 2006, Buenos Aires, Ediciones Lumiere S.A., }}\nWhen he returned to Spain, his brother Lucio got him a job as custodian in the Rio de la Plata cinematographic studios. In 1937, he was hired as director and screenwriter for the movies Dos amigos y un amor (Two friends and one love) and Veinticuatro horas de libertad (Twenty-four hours of liberty), both starring comedy actor Pepe Iglesias. In 1939, he directed El hijo del barrio (1940, Son of the neighborhood), Corazón the Turco (1940, Turkish Heart) and Chingolo (1941) all of them with their own script.\nThis movie was well received by the public and critics, “It consolidated the exceptional tech team accompanied by Artistas Argentinos Asociados: his brother Lucio on the music band, the assistant Hugo Fregones, the montajussta Carlos Rinaldi, the set builder Ralph Pappier, the lighting specialist from the United States Bob Roberts (from the American Society of Cinematographers), the cinematographer Humberto Peruzzi, the electrician Serafín de la Iglesia, the make up artist Roberto Combi and some others.”\nThe following movie was El cura gaucho, in which he met Enrique Muriño, but even with his abundant commercial success, he was fired from Pampa Films.\nFilming\nLucas Demare thought that January and February (summer) were the best months to work on the filming in Salta but they were told that it was better to do it in winter due to summer being flood season. Demare travelled to Salta to reconnoiter the area. Later, the crew and equipment moved to an old estate and big house. They worked on a big ballroom and had two small rooms; each crewman had a cot and an upside down beer wooden box as night-stand. The actresses and Enrique Muiño, due to his age, stayed in a hotel.\nEnrique Muiño\nAt their arrival in Salta, they met with the local military commander, Colonel Lanús, but he was not eager to help, instead placing obstacles in their way. Demare told how they solved the problem:\nMaranghello, César, Artistas Argentinos Asociados. La epopeya trunca, 2002, Buenos Aires pág. 51, Ediciones del Jilguero, }}\nDemare had brought gaucho clothing for the cast, but he realized they were not appropriate for the feel he wanted in the movie as they were brand-new, so he traded the new clothing for local gauchos' own clothing.  Demare sent Magaña and Chiola on long horse rides to \"weather\" their uniforms and accustom the actors to riding. The locals were surprised to encounter two soldiers in antiquated uniforms.}}\nIn another scene where the characters played by Amelia Bence, Petrone and Magaña argue, the latter was supposed to fall down the stairs but doubted his ability to do so. Demare stood at the top of the stairs with his back to it and rolled down, to demonstrate that the scene could be done without undue risk. This was in fact the sequence shown in the movie.\nA scene where a group of horses ran down a hill with burning branches tied to their tails needed to be filmed from in front, so the crew built a hut made of wood, stones, and rocks in which stood Peruzzi the cameraman, who tells that \"At the order of Action! I saw this mass of heads and hooves coming at me at full speed, and did not breath until I saw them open up to the sides of the hut, right in front of me. We had to improvise and replace the lack of technology with smarts, ingenuity and valor.\"\nThe filming included more than 1,000 actors as extras for the crowd scenes, although only eighty actors had speaking parts. Among the extras there were local gauchos hired by the producers and others provided as laborers by their employer, the Patrón Costa, a wealthy local family. There were also the aforementioned fencing trainer and soldiers lent by the military garrison and two pato players from Buenos Aires, experts falling from horses. As the gauchos did not want to be dressed as Spaniards, military conscripts played the part.\nLocation\nFor the scenes in the local village where the royalists had established their headquarters, they selected the village of San Fernando. Nearby is the Gallinato Creek, where they filmed the gaucho encampment scenes and the assault against Miranda's woman.\nThey brought material from Salta in fifty trucks to build a village. It had an area of about a thousand square meters, fifteen houses, a church with a belfry, hospital, horse barn, corrals, commander's office, cemetery, and ovens, all of which was destroyed by the fire in the final scenes. The director requested five hundred horses, four hundred cattle, oxen, mules, burros and chickens. Also many props such as wheelbarrows, wagons, and period-military equipment. Sebastián Chiola y Amelia Bence\nThe interior and exterior scens of the Asunción ranch, the royalist encampment at night, the interior of the church and belfry, the death of the child and the musical number by the Ábalos Brothers group were filmed at the studios in Buenos Aires.\nFilming delays meant that the producers spent part of the monies they had earned on the film El Viejo Hucha. To recoup this, they had to undersell the exhibition rights in advance in some areas. Spending as little as possible, the production ended up costing 269,000 pesos  approximately 55,000 US dollars. The extras in Salta were paid between 3 and 4 pesos per workday, when a theater seat cost 3 pesos. Amelia Bence was paid 5,000 pesos for about six days of filming. This was completely recouped in the nineteen weeks the film stayed at the opening theaters.\nThe musical numbers and native dances were choreographed and played by the Ábalos Brothers group.\nSoundtrack and Film Score\nThe music score was done by Lucio Demare, a composer and brother of director Lucas Demare. Born in Buenos Aires on 9 August 1906, Lucio studied music from the age of six and from the age of eight he was playing piano in movie theatres &ndash;it was still the age of silent movies.\nIn Spain in 1933, Demare created the music for two movies in which he also acted. He started his work in Argentine cinema in 1936 with the musical score for the film Ya tiene comisario el pueblo (\"The Village Now Has a Constable\"), directed by Claudio Martínez Payva, and in 1938, he continued with Dos amigos y un amor (\"Two Friends and One Love\"), with Francisco Canaro, and also directed by his brother Lucas Demare.\nReception\nLa guerra gaucha was well received by the critics and the public and received several awards. The article in the El Heraldo de Buenos Aires said:  diario El Heraldo de Buenos Aires, cit. por Manrupe, Raúl y Portela, María Alejandra, Un diccionario de films argentinos (1930-1995) pág. 261, 2001, Buenos Aires, Editorial Corregidor, }}\nLa Guerra Gaucha program La Nación said: diario La Nación, cit. por Zolezzi, Emilio, Noticias del viejo cine criollo, pág.86, 2006, Buenos Aires, Ediciones Lumiere S.A., }}\nClaudio España wrote: España, Claudio, El cine sonoro y su expansión pág. 80 en Historia del cine argentino (Jorge Miguel Couselo, director), 1984, Buenos Aires, Centro Editor de América Latina}}\nThe opinion of film critic José Agustín Mahieu is as follows:  Mahieu, José Agustín, Breve historia del cine argentino, pág. 30, 1966, Buenos Aires, Editorial Universitaria de Buenos Aires}}\nLastly, César Maranghello says:  Maranghello, César, Artistas Argentinos Asociados. La epopeya trunca, 2002, Buenos Aires pág. 49, Ediciones del Jilguero, }}\nThe film stayed on the opening theaters for nineteen weeks where it was seen by 170,000 viewers, including four weeks in Montevideo by that time. Nonetheless, due to the producer partners' lack of business experience and their scant resources put into starting the business, critical and public acclaim did not translate into big earnings.\nAwards\nLa guerra gaucha received the following awards:\n*The Silver Condor for Best Picture, Best Director (L. Demare), and Best Screenplay (Ulyses Petit de Murat y Homero Manzi) from the Argentine Film Critics Association\n*The Condor Diploma for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay (Petit de Murat and Manzi), Main Actor (Francisco Petrone), Best Sound Editing and Best Cinematography, from the Argentine Academy of Cinematography Arts and Sciences\n*Best Screenplay (Petit de Murat and Manzi), from the Comisión Nacional de Cultura\n*First prize for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Lead Actress (Amelia Bence), Best Actor (Francisco Petrone), Best Photography, Best Music and Best Sound Editing, from Municipalidad de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires\n*Best Foreign film in Cuba shown in 1947, from the Asociación de Cronistas Cinematográficos de La Habana (Cuba, 1948)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.cinenacional.com/peliculas/index.php?pelicula=979 La guerra gaucha] at Cinenacional\nAuthorization\nThis article incorporates material from [https://web.archive.org/web/20080920085015/http://www.ataquenuclear.com/ ataquenuclear.com], which has given authorization to the use of content and images and published them under GNU license."
