It was responsible for the defence of the Adriatic coast including the two major naval bases at Boka Kotorska and Šibenik. The divisions were the Hercegovina Division, the Boka Kotorska Fortress Division and the Šibenik Fortress Division. The Hercegovina Division was only partly mobilised at the time of the invasion, and the two fortress divisions were still in the process of mobilising. The Coastal Defence Command was supported by a coastal reconnaissance flight based out of Mostar Jasenica Airport, near Mostar.\nNotes\nReferences\nBooks\n*\nPapers\n*\n*"
