The cemetery is named after Gideon King, who came to the area in 1796, died two years later, and is buried in the cemetery with his two sons.\n\"King's Landing\" refers to the landing point on the Genesee River, below the bluffs on which the cemetery is located. After the original settlement was disbanded in 1809, the area was resettled by seven brothers by name of Hanford, from Rome, New York, and thereafter came to be known as \"Hanford's Landing\".\nThe cemetery is currently maintained by the Eastman Kodak Company. Many of the grave sites are unmarked, but some gravestones are scattered throughout the cemetery. A large monument at the front of the cemetery lists known graves by name and date of death. It was created in 2001 as part of a public-service project by Boy Scout Troop 68.\nReferences"
