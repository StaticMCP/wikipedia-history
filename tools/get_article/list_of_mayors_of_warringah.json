      "text": "# List of mayors of Warringah\n\nThis is a list of the shire presidents, administrators and mayors of Warringah Council, a former local government area of New South Wales, Australia. The official title of Mayors while holding office was: His/Her Worship The Mayor of Warringah. First incorporated on 7 March 1906 as Warringah Shire Council, the council became known as Warringah Council on 1 July 1993 following the enactment of a new Local Government Act which also stipulated that the term 'Shire President' be replaced with 'Mayor'.\nUpon its establishment a temporary council of five nominated representatives was installed. The first meeting of this temporary council took place in the Narrabeen Progress Hall on 19 June 1906, with George Brock in the chair. The election of the first Warringah Shire Council took place on 24 November 1906, and the first meeting of the six elected councillors took place on 3 December, when Thomas Fisbourne was elected Shire President. Originally a role nominated by the council annually, from 2008 to 2016 it was directly elected every four years. The last Mayor of Warringah was Councillor Michael Regan (Your Warringah), elected in 2008, who served until the council's amalgamation into the new Northern Beaches Council, which was established with former Warringah administrator, Dick Persson, at its head.\nShire presidents and deputy shire presidents\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! # !!
