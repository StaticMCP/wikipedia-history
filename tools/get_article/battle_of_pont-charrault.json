The Vendéen insurgents, led by Charles de Royrand, were pitted against a Republican column commanded by General .\nThe battle, which occurred in the Guérinière valley, near the Gravereau and Basse-Rivière bridges, between the communes of L'Oie and Saint-Vincent-Sterlanges, is known in historiography as the \"Battle of Pont-Charrault.\" This designation is due to inaccuracies in initial Republican reports.\nThe Republican troops, dispatched from Rochefort and La Rochelle to suppress the uprising, encountered significant impediments at this location due to the destruction of both bridges. They were further disadvantaged by an unexpected insurgent attack at nightfall. After three hours of sustained combat, the patriots were compelled to retreat in disorder towards La Rochelle, leaving several hundred men on the battlefield.\nOn this day, the peasant insurgents protesting against mass conscription inflicted the most significant defeat on the Republicans since the inception of the revolt. The news reached Paris and caused considerable astonishment among the deputies of the National Convention, who perceived themselves to be confronting a vast conspiracy. Accused of treason, General Marcé was sentenced to death by the Revolutionary Tribunal and subsequently executed by guillotine in Paris.\nThe repercussions of this battle, which took place in the Vendée department, were so significant that the uprising in the West subsequently became known as the \"War in the Vendée.\" Additionally, the rebels from the various insurgent departments began to be collectively referred to as \"Vendéens.\"\nPrelude\nIn the opening days of March 1793, the introduction of universal conscription gave rise to a series of insurrections across a dozen departments in western France. In the eastern portion of the Vendée department, the insurrection commenced with the capture of Tiffauges and the disarmament of its National Guard on March 12. On the 13th, the insurgents proceeded to seize Les Herbiers and Montaigu, where they perpetrated the massacre of approximately 50 to 60 National Guardsmen and patriotic administrators. On the same day, the National Guard of Fontenay-le-Comte was decisively defeated at the Quatre-chemins crossroads, in L'Oie, south of Saint-Fulgent, and subsequently withdrew to Sainte-Hermine, resulting in the deaths of between 25 and 30 individuals. The peasantry rapidly selected members of the nobility as their leaders, largely due to their extensive military experience. Prominent figures included Charles de Royrand, , and Charles Sapinaud de La Rairie. However, many demonstrated minimal enthusiasm for an insurrection they perceived futile and were compelled to participate.\nIn La Rochelle, located to the south of the insurgent-controlled territory, the 12th military division was under the command of Division General , who was assisted by Colonels  and . In response to a request for assistance from the districts of Sables-d'Olonne and Challans, Verteuil announced the deployment of reinforcements on March 12. On March 13, Division General  arrived in La Rochelle with 900 men gathered in Rochefort. Verteuil initially appeared to intend to assist Les Sables. However, during the night of March 13–14, he received a letter from Sainte-Hermine that indicated the route to Nantes was obstructed by approximately 10,000 rebels and that the bridges north of Chantonnay had been destroyed. The initial objective was subsequently modified at the request or with the agreement of the representative on mission Joseph Niou. On March 14, General Marcé departed from La Rochelle with a column of 1,100 to 1,200 men and four cannons, embarking on the road to Nantes.\nOn March 15, the insurgents succeeded in capturing Chantonnay after a prolonged engagement with the National Guards of Fontenay. On the 16th, Marcé arrived in Sainte-Hermine. On the 17th, he recaptured the village of Chantonnay with a vanguard of 500 men. The Vendéens then retreated to L'Oie, leaving behind 40 dead and three cannons. That same day, Marcé received reinforcements and announced his intention to continue his march to Nantes.\nOn March 18, the civil commission of Sainte-Hermine requisitioned horses and carts for the purpose of supplying the column with food.\nForces present\nRepublican army\nUpon its departure from La Rochelle on March 14, Marcé's column comprised over one thousand combatants. The contingent comprised 400 men from the , 3rd, and 4th battalions of Charente-Inférieure volunteers and 500 men from the Rochefort-sur-Mer National Guard, including 100 cavalrymen. Additionally, the contingent comprised 150 men from the La Rochelle National Guard, 140 from the 4th Marine Infantry Regiment, 50 from the , a platoon of gendarmes, and a few gunners with four field pieces. However, the column was reinforced along the way by several hundred National Guardsmen, notably from Surgères, Chaillé-les-Marais, Luçon, Marans, and possibly from Niort and Saintes, with four cannons. The majority of the combatants were inexperienced and some were lacking ammunition. Marcé stated that he had 2,000 men when he entered insurgent territory. In his report dated March 21, Verteuil stated that he had 2,400 men at his disposal, along with nine cannons. Deschamps, the commissioner of the Deux-Sèvres department, reported 3,500 men on March 18. In their report to the National Convention, representatives on mission Niou and  mentioned 2,300 men with eight cannons. This last number is cited by historians Jean-Clément Martin, Alain Gérard, Roger Dupuy, and Claudy Valin.\nVendéen army\nThe insurgents from the eastern part of the Vendée department were the first to adopt a military organization, establishing a precedent that was subsequently emulated by other groups. As early as March, they constituted a gathering designated the \"Catholic Army\" or the \"Catholic-Royal Army.\" Charles de Royrand was appointed as the general-in-chief. Other commanders included Louis Sapinaud de La Verrie, Charles Sapinaud de La Rairie, Jean-Félix Clabat du Chillou, the brothers Auguste and Amédée de Béjarry, , Aimé de Vaugirard, Jacques Alexis de Verteuil, and .\nFrom March 16 to 19, a considerable number of insurgents, estimated at between 5,000 and 6,000, assembled at the L'Oie camp. They were equipped with diverse weapons, including rifles, pikes, and scythes. During this period, the bands from the La Roche-sur-Yon region, led by William Bulkeley, Céleste Bulkeley, and , joined the ranks of Royrand's army.\nCourse of events\nDespite the common designation of the engagement as the \"Battle of Pont-Charrault,\" a designation that reflects an initial tendency to present inaccurate information in Republican reports, the battle occurred to the north of Saint-Vincent-Sterlanges, specifically within the confines of the Guérinière valley. The precise location of the battle was situated between two bridges: the Gravereau Bridge, to the south along the ; and the Basse-Rivière Bridge, to the north along the Vendronneau.\nOn March 19, the Republican forces initiated their advance, only to encounter the Gravereau Bridge obstructed and impassable. At 7&nbsp;am, the 200 men of the vanguard, stationed at Saint-Vincent-Sterlanges, commenced efforts to restore the passageway under the direction of Adjutant General Frésat. At 12:30&nbsp;pm, Marcé departed from Chantonnay with most of his troops. Representatives Niou and  accompanied him. The weather conditions were challenging, with low temperatures, precipitation, and strong winds. After passing Saint-Vincent-Sterlanges, Marcé reunited with his vanguard at approximately 2&nbsp;pm. However, upon crossing the Gravereau Bridge, the Republicans discovered that the Basse-Rivière Bridge had also been obstructed. While awaiting the necessary repairs, the soldiers proceeded in a line through the Guérinière valley.\nAt approximately 3 or 4&nbsp;pm, as repairs on the second bridge were nearing completion, a group was observed in the northern vicinity of Saint-Fulgent. The Republicans were indecisive. Some troops suspected an enemy attack, while others believed they heard the singing of the French national anthem, La Marseillaise, and thought reinforcements were arriving from Nantes. In response to orders from the representatives, a trumpet and one or two aides-de-camp were dispatched to investigate. Two additional hours elapsed without any discernible action. Marcé even initiated the process of establishing a camp for his troops. The emissaries subsequently returned to raise the alarm, but it was already too late. The Vendéens had gained the upper hand and initiated an attack. The lyrics being sung were those of the La Marseillaise des Blancs.\nThe engagement commenced at approximately 6 or 7&nbsp;pm, shortly before nightfall. The Vendéens assumed positions in the woods and on the heights, from which they opened fire. After the initial volleys, the fighting transitioned into close combat. On the left wing, the National Guardsmen exhibited signs of panic, which rapidly disseminated throughout the entire army. According to Colonel , the battalions \"were so panicked that they perceived enemies in every direction, even in the absence of any actual adversaries.\"}} After three hours of combat, the Republicans were completely routed.\nThe fugitives traversed the municipalities of Saint-Vincent-Sterlanges and Chantonnay, subsequently reaching Sainte-Hermine between 3 and 4&nbsp;am. There, representatives Niou and Trullard were joined by their colleagues  and Jean-Louis Carra, who had proceeded from Fontenay-le-Comte. Marcé arrived in Sainte-Hermine at 6 a.m. and was promptly dismissed by the representatives on mission. The officers were unable to rally their men, and the flight resumed the following morning, only stopping at La Rochelle. The first fugitives reached the city on March 20 at 5&nbsp;am. The four representatives on mission arrived at approximately 8 or 9&nbsp;pm. Marcé followed shortly after and was among the last to return. Other soldiers retreated to Niort.\nLosses\nThe precise number of human casualties is uncertain, as no official record was kept and the death registers of the municipalities within the combat zone have been lost. On the Republican side, Deputy Jean-Baptiste Martineau reported 300 deaths in a letter dated March 21 and addressed to his colleague, , a deputy to the National Convention.}} Amédée de Béjarry, relying on the notes of his grandfather Amédée-François-Paul de Béjarry, posits a toll of 400 to 500 dead and 200 to 300 prisoners. In their respective historical accounts, , , and  cite a figure of 500 dead. Additionally, the Republicans left behind a cannon, a considerable quantity of rifles, 2,400 cartridges, and a thousand pounds of gunpowder in the hands of the insurgents.\nIn contrast to the relatively low number of casualties reported by Amédée de Béjarry, which he attributes to the statements of an insurgent leader, Dominique Ussault, the figures provided by Deputy Martineau are considerably higher. Martineau's account suggests that the insurgents sustained losses amounting to more than half of their total strength. However, the historian Yves Gras offers a figure of 250 dead, which is considerably higher than the other estimates.\nConsequences\nMassacres in La Rochelle\nIn La Rochelle, the announcement of the defeat caused a general sense of astonishment among the population, and a pervasive fear of \"brigands\" emerged. On March 21, four priests, Noirlieu, and Largeasse, all in their sixties.}} who had been imprisoned since October 1792 for refusing to comply with the orders of the French Revolution were removed from the  prison and transferred to the Île de Ré. However, en route, they were slaughtered by a mob of 200 to 300 individuals, and their corpses were decapitated, emasculated, or dismembered. The following day, two religious men from Saint-Laurent-sur-Sèvre}} were disembarked in La Rochelle by a ship from Les Sables-d'Olonne and suffered the same fate.\nDismissal and execution of General Marcé\n, engraving by , 1797, Bibliothèque nationale de France.]]\nFollowing his dismissal, General Marcé was apprehended on the evening of March 20 and incarcerated in the  by the representatives on mission. He was subsequently replaced by his second-in-command, Colonel , of the .\nOn March 21, Niou and  drafted their report, attributing the defeat to General Marcé, whom they accused of inaction. In the aforementioned report, Niou asserted that he had advised Marcé to vacate the position held by the Republicans before the Vendéens' assault. However, the account presented by the representatives is contradicted by that of Boulard. In his report, dated March 21 and addressed to the Minister of War, as well as in his deposition before the commissioners of the district and municipality of La Rochelle on March 22, Boulard stated that the representative on the mission had believed in the imminent arrival of patriot reinforcements and had forbidden firing.|title=Excerpt from the interrogation of General Marcé by Judge Antonin Roussillon, in the presence of Public Prosecutor Fouquier-Tinville, on July 26, 1793.}}}} General Marcé provided a similar account during his interrogation.\nNiou and Trullard merely alluded to a \"strange and cruel\" defeat, whereas the representatives  and Carra elaborated further. Having observed the troops' defeat in Sainte-Hermine, they accused Marcé of \"the most cowardly incompetence\" or \"the most cowardly treason.\" Furthermore, they had his eldest son, aged 18, arrested, citing compelling evidence that both were complicit in the Marquis de La Rouërie's plot. Ultimately, on April 6, Auguis and Carra drew a parallel with General Dumouriez's betrayal in Belgium following the Battle of Neerwinden. They recalled that Dumouriez had served as a field marshal in Vendée in 1791 and 1792, concluding that \"the treason of the former General Marcé at Saint-Vincent on the 19th of last month occurred on the same day, the 19th, as the treason of the infamous Dumouriez at Neerwinden.\" [...] Therefore, it can be concluded with certainty that there was a general plot and that Marcé and Dumouriez were in agreement.\nIn the context of mounting suspicion towards aristocrats, Auguis and Carra, upon learning that one of the insurgent leaders was named Verteuil, posited that he must be the son of , the commander-in-chief of La Rochelle. They also contemplated dismissing him. However, the relationship between the Republican general and the insurgent leader proved to be quite distant, and Verteuil remained in his position for another three months.\nThe news of the Pont-Charrault rout reached Paris on March 23, eliciting shock among the deputies of the National Convention. They found the defeat of regular troops at the hands of peasants incomprehensible and could only offer an explanation that invoked treason. The Montagnards exploited the opportunity to accuse the Girondins of moderation and incompetence. Girondin deputy Lecointe-Puyraveau advanced the hypothesis of an English conspiracy. Tallien, a member of the Montagnard faction, asserted that Marcé could only be \"a fool or a traitor.\" Barère petitioned for the convening of a court-martial in La Rochelle to try Marcé, but Robespierre interceded, urging instead that the general be tried in Paris before the Revolutionary Tribunal. On May 11, the Society of Friends of Liberty and Equality of La Rochelle also submitted a formal complaint to the Revolutionary Tribunal in Paris. The document accused Marcé of \"sacrificing the troops of the Republic\" and demanded that he be tried for treason. It further stated that, two months after his actions, Marcé was still at large and that the Revolutionary Tribunal must take action. The document concluded by expressing hope that Marcé would be punished severely, in the interest of the Revolution and national justice.\nMarcé was incarcerated in May at the Abbaye prison. He was brought before the Revolutionary Tribunal on July 26, 1793, and put on trial on January 28, 1794. The general attempted to justify his actions by claiming that the defeat was merely the unfortunate consequence of a battalion's panic. However, in his indictment, Fouquier-Tinville accused the general of \"wickedly and deliberately betraying the interests of the Republic [...] by favoring the progress of the brigands' arms on his territory.\" In its judgment, the tribunal accused Marcé of treason, negligence, and unworthiness. It reproached the officer for failing to order a necessary retreat for abandoning the troops in disarray and exposed artillery through a cowardly and criminal flight. This resulted in the Republic losing brave defenders and providing the rebels with huge progress. Marcé was condemned to death and subsequently guillotined on January 29, 1794.\nThe hypothesis in question lacks historical support. Accordingly, Jean-Clément Martin posits that the failure of Marcé can be attributed to the mediocrity of the revolutionaries' military resources and their lack of resolve. The region spanning Nantes to La Rochelle had a limited number of regular troops at its disposal. The preoccupation with the potential of an English landing on the coastline necessitated the continuous deployment of troops in the ports and islands that dominated the coastline.\nBeginning of the \"War in the Vendée\"\nIn the early days of April 1793, the Republican forces could successfully suppress the insurrection that had been occurring in the regions of Brittany and Maine. Nevertheless, the insurgents retained control of a region encompassing the southern portion of the Loire-Inférieure department, the southwestern section of the Maine-et-Loire department, the northwestern region of the Deux-Sèvres department, and the northern zone of the Vendée department. This territory is historically designated as the \"Military Vendée,\" a term used to differentiate it from the department.\nFollowing the Battle of Pont-Charrault, which took place in the Vendée department, all insurgents from the West were collectively designated as \"Vendéens,\" and the conflict became known as the \"War in the Vendée,\" even though the insurrection involved numerous other departments. In the view of the historian Jean-Clément Martin, the designation 'Vendée' was born from the characterization of the conflict as a 'war' following the battle lost on March 19, 1793, situated in the Vendée department. Following this battle, the designation \"rebels of the Vendée department and neighboring areas\" gained traction in subsequent discussions, ascribing responsibility for the civil war to the Vendée alone, or more specifically, to its administrators, who were deemed incapable. The designation \"War in the Vendée\" is rooted in this interpretation, which was accepted by the administrators of the surrounding departments. These administrators could thereby emphasize their republican credentials. In July and August 1793, the patriot inhabitants of the Vendée department petitioned the Convention to alter the designation of the war, thereby avoiding the stigmatization of their region. This plea was ultimately unsuccessful. [...] In the competition between the departments of the West to designate themselves as the most exemplary Republicans, the Deux-Sèvres department highlights its vigilance against royalist forces, as do Maine-et-Loire and Loire-Inférieure. All three departments allow the war to be called \"of Vendée.\" Despite the displeasure of their administrators, the Vendée was transformed in a matter of days into a hotbed of subversion, further exacerbated by its association with counter-revolutionary plots.\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
