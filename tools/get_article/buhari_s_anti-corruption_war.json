During the president's election campaign in 2015, he had vowed to fight against corruption and insecurity if elected. The U.S. Secretary of State, John Kerry, at the World Economic Forum held at Davos in Switzerland extolled Buhari's anti-corruption fight. In October 2015, the United Kingdom pledged support for Buhari's anti-corruption war. According to Grant Shapps, the minister for international development, \"UK is fully committed to helping Nigeria increase its security, stability and prosperity. \"We would continue to provide capacity building, technical and investigative support to Nigeria to tackle corruption. Corruption in Nigeria also affects the UK directly. Where we have evidence, we will continue to take action to protect the integrity of the UK's financial system and prevent. William Kumuyi, the founder and general overseer of Deeper Christian Life Ministry described Buhari's anti-corruption war as a step in right direction.\nHowever, the president has been criticized and accused of leading a selective war against corruption.

Olu Falae had earlier been named one of the beneficiaries of the controversial $2 billion arms deal, an allegation he refuted in an interview with The Punch.\nOn 24 August 2015, Abdulkadir Balarabe Musa, a former governor of Kaduna State challenged President Muhammadu to probe his military regime between 1983 and 1985 if he was really serious about anti-corruption war. He accused the president of violation of federal character law. On 8 February 2016, Ezenwo Nyesom Wike, the governor of Rivers State and former minister of state for education in the Cabinet of President Goodluck Jonathan accused the president of bias in his anti-corruption war.

On 27 September 2015, Dr. Frederick Fasehun, the founder of Oodua Peoples Congress advised the president to shun selective justice and focus on good governance.\nOn 21 January 2016, Fasheun urged the president to slow down in his fight against corruption saying that the government may run into problems in the way the anti-graft war is being handled by the president.

He expressed concern on why these people had not been invited by the anti-graft agencies for questioning. He said \"We are dissatisfied with the way the anti-corruption war is being fought and we are afraid that we may not achieve anything better than what we had before Buhari assumed office.\"\nIn January 2016, Bishop Hyacinth Oroko Egbebo of Apostolic Vicariate of Bomadi, during the consecration of a Catholic priest under his vicariate, expressed concern over what he described as \"high level of impunity and abuse of human rights in the anti-corruption war of President Muhammadu Buhari\". He accused Buhari of selective anti-graft war. He raised a concern over how Buhari disobeys court order in his fight against corruption. He said \"In as much as we would want to commend President Buhari on his zero tolerance on corruption, it is very disheartening and a risk to our democracy that the President would have the impunity to set aside court orders under the guise of his anti-corruption war\".\nIn January 2016, Carol Ajie, a constitutional lawyer petitioned President Barack Obama and National Judicial Council over the disobedience of court order by President Muhammadu Buhari in his fight against corruption.

According to Daily Post, a Nigerian newspaper, Sheriff said \"I was never invited, the EFCC never said they were declaring me wanted. It was the reports in the media that attracted my attention and I paid EFCC a visit. There was nothing about N300 billion.\"Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, the Emir of Kano and former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria exposed part of the illegal oil deals during the administration of President Goodluck Jonathan. He raised concern over the failure of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to deposit the sum of $20 billion of oil revenues into the federation account.\nDiezani Alison-Madueke, the former minister of Petroleum resources named all the persons involved in the deal and others in the controversial concession of oil wells, Jide Omokore and Kola Aluko were named.

The committee report showed extra-budgetary spending to the tune of N643.8 billion and additional spending of about $2.2 billion in the foreign currency component under the Goodluck Jonathan's watch. Preliminary investigation suggested that about $2 billion may have been disbursed for the procurement of arms to fight against Boko Haram insurgency in Nigeria.\nThe investigative report indicated that a total sum of $2.2 billion was inexplicably disbursed into the office of the National Security Adviser in procurement of arms to fight against insurgency, but was not spent for the purpose for which the money was disbursed. Investigations on this illegal deal led to the arrest of Sambo Dasuki, the former National Security Adviser who later mentioned prominent Nigerians involved in the deal.

Nigeria was to provide the gas, which PI&D was to refine so that it could be used to power the Nigerian electrical grid. PI&D could keep valuable byproducts for its own use. In 2012, PI&D demanded arbitration in London, alleging that Nigeria had not supplied the agreed quantity of gas or to construct the infrastructure it had agreed to build. The arbitral tribunal awarded damages of more than £4.8 billion. The compensation was valued £8.15 billion with interest when the case was heard in London High Court in December 2022.\nReferences"
