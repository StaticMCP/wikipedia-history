After completing his education, Hayward worked as a jackaroo in New South Wales for several years. He started in the retail sector for the first time in 1929, working for Sydney Snow and Co. Ltd., and moved back to Adelaide in 1931 to join the family business, John Martin's.\nOne of his first jobs at John Martin's was to visit Canada and the United States to gather ideas from department stores in those countries. It was on this trip that he came up with the idea to start the Adelaide Christmas Pageant, being in particular inspired by the Toronto Santa Claus Parade and by Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City. Since the first pageant in 1933, it has become a much loved Adelaide tradition.\nDuring World War II Hayward served in the Australian Army; he was 36 when he enlisted in the army. During the war Hayward noted the popularity of the soft drink Coca-Cola with the Americans. After the war Hayward established a franchise to bottle and sell Coca-Cola in Adelaide. He served either as president or chairman of the franchise for a total of 33 years.\nIn 1951 he co-founded Vintage Cellars. Hayward was chairman of the St John Council in South Australia when, in 1952, it became responsible for ambulance services in that state, and he was made a Knight of the Order in 1959. He was made a Knight Bachelor on 10 June 1961.\nHayward and his wife, Ursula (née Barr-Smith), were art enthusiasts and built up a magnificent art collection in their Adelaide home Carrick Hill. The house, its lands, and the collection were bequeathed to the state on Hayward's death (Lady Hayward having died before him), and now form a museum and cultural centre.\nReferences\n*Christmas Pageant creator dies at 79, The Advertiser, 15 August 1983, p.&nbsp;14\n*Cockburn, Stewart.
