The supporting cast includes Gene Evans, Lance Fuller, Jack Elam, Chubby Johnson, and Morris Ankrum.\nPlot\nPop Jones inherits a piece of family land in Montana, so he and his daughter, Sierra Nevada, decide to leave their Texas ranch and move there. As she bathes in a pond along the trail, Sierra Nevada encounters a stranger, Farrell, a hired gunman who warns her about dangerous Indians nearby.\nFarrell is on his way to work for Tom McCord, a rich rancher. Quite a bit of rustling has been going on in the territory of late. McCord is in cahoots with Indians, in particular Natchakoa of the Blackfoot tribe, whose braves stampede the Jones family's cattle, knock Sierra cold, wound her cowhand Nat and kill Pop, after which McCord steals a document from Pop's dead body that grants rights to the land.\nSierra is nursed back to health by Colorados, a young Blackfoot who attends school among the whites, to the displeasure of the tribal chief, his father. McCord offers a $2,000 bounty to Farrell if he kills Sierra and Nat, but instead Farrell comes to her rescue.\nFarrell reveals that he is actually an agent for the U.S. Cavalry, investigating the rustling and killing. With the help of Sierra, he blows up a McCord wagon filled with ammunition being sold to the Indians, doing away with McCord once and for all and bringing peace to the territory at last.\nCast\n* Barbara Stanwyck as Sierra Nevada Jones\n* Ronald Reagan as Farrell\n* Gene Evans as Tom McCord\n* Lance Fuller as Colorados\n* Anthony Caruso as Natchakoa\n* Jack Elam as Yost\n* Yvette Duguay as Starfire\n* Morris Ankrum as J.I.

He watched the film on January 14, 1989, six days before leaving the presidency.\nSee also\n* List of American films of 1954\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
