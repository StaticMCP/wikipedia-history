In the shadow of an incomplete economic recovery from the Panic of 1837, Whig nominee William Henry Harrison defeated incumbent President Martin Van Buren of the Democratic Party. The election marked the first of two Whig victories in presidential elections, but was the only one where they won a majority of the popular vote. This was also the third rematch in American history.\nIn 1839, the Whigs held a national convention for the first time. The 1839 Whig National Convention saw 1836 nominee William Henry Harrison defeat former Secretary of State Henry Clay and General Winfield Scott. Van Buren faced little opposition at the 1840 Democratic National Convention, but controversial Vice President Richard Mentor Johnson was not renominated. The Democrats thus became the only major party since 1800 to fail to select a vice presidential nominee.\nReferencing vice presidential nominee John Tyler and Harrison's participation in the Battle of Tippecanoe, the Whigs campaigned on the slogan of \"Tippecanoe and Tyler Too.\" With Van Buren weakened by economic woes, Harrison won a popular majority and 234 of 294 electoral votes. Voter participation surged as white male suffrage became nearly universal, and a contemporary record of 42.4% of the voting age population voted for Harrison. Van Buren's loss made him the third president to lose re-election.\nThe Whigs did not enjoy the benefits of victory. The 67-year-old Harrison, the oldest U.S. president elected until Ronald Reagan won the 1980 election, died a little more than a month after inauguration. Harrison was succeeded by John Tyler, who unexpectedly proved not to be a Whig. While Tyler had been a staunch supporter of Clay at the convention, he was a former Democrat, a passionate supporter of states' rights, and effectively an independent. As President, Tyler blocked the Whigs' legislative agenda and was expelled from the Whig Party, subsequently the second independent (after Washington) to serve as president. Van Buren would be the last incumbent president to lose his reelection bid in a general election until fellow Democrat Grover Cleveland in 1888. This was also the last time a challenger to an incumbent President got a majority of the vote until 1932. This was also the last time as of 2024 where the incumbent president seeking re-election flipped a state yet failed to secure re-election, with Van Buren winning South Carolina, despite losing it four years earlier, and losing re-election to Harrison.\nNominations\nWhig Party nomination\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|1840 Whig Party ticket\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#F0DC82; width:200px;\"|\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#F0DC82; width:200px;\"|\n|-  style=\"color:#000000; font-size:100%; background:#F0DC82;\"\n| style=\"width:3em; font-size:100%; color:#000; background:lightyellow; width:200px;\"|for President\n| style=\"width:3em; font-size:100%; color:#000; background:lightyellow; width:200px;\"|for Vice President\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n| United States Minister for Gran Columbia(1829)\n| U.S. Senatorfrom Virginia(1827–1836)President pro tempore of the Senate(1835)\n|-\n| colspan=2 |Campaign\n|-\n|}\nThe first national convention of the Whig Party was called for by members of the party in Congress and it was attended by almost 250 delegates in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Henry Clay, William Henry Harrison, and Winfield Scott ran for the party's presidential nomination. The delegations of each state balloted separately before meeting together with the other representatives of the states. Clay initially led on the first ballot, but Harrison won on the final ballot with 148 votes compared to Clay's 90 votes and Scott's 16 votes after supporters from Scott switched to Harrison. John Tyler was selected as a factional and geographical balance to Harrison.\nDemocratic Party nomination\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|1840 Democratic Party ticket\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#3333FF; width:200px;\"|\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#3333FF; width:200px;\" |\n|-\n| style=\"width:3em; font-size:100%; color:#000; background:#C8EBFF; width:200px;\"|for President\n| style=\"width:3em; font-size:100%; color:#000; background:#C8EBFF; width:200px;\"|for Vice President\n|-\n|\n|-\n| 8thPresident of the United States(1837–1841)\n| N/A\n|-\n|}\nDemocratic members of the New Hampshire General Court made a call for the 1840 Democratic National Convention which was held in Baltimore, Maryland in May 1840. Delegates from twenty-two states attended the convention, but the sizes of the delegations varied with New Jersey having fifty-nine delegates to cast its eight votes while Massachusetts only had one delegate to cast its fourteen votes.\nA committee was formed to make recommendations for the nominations and the committee supported Van Buren for renomination which was approved by acclamation. However, the vice-presidential nomination was left vacant due to opposition to Vice President Richard M. Johnson's personal life.\nAnti-Masonic Party nomination\nAfter the negative views of Freemasonry among a large segment of the public began to wane in the mid-1830s, the Anti-Masonic Party disintegrated. Many leaders began to move to the Whig party. Remaining leaders met in September 1837 in Washington, and agreed to maintain the party. The third Anti-Masonic Party National Convention was held in Philadelphia on November 13–14, 1838. By this time, the party had been almost entirely supplanted by the Whigs. The delegates unanimously voted to nominate William Henry Harrison for president (who the party had supported for president the previous election along with Francis Granger for vice president) and Daniel Webster for vice president. However, when the Whig National Convention nominated Harrison with John Tyler as his running mate, the Anti-Masonic Party did not make an alternate nomination and ceased to function and was fully absorbed into the Whigs by 1840.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|+ Convention vote\n|-\n!

Birney, Myron Holley, Joshua Leavitt, and Gerrit Smith proposed the creation of an anti-slavery party. In July 1839, two resolutions proposed by Holley at the American Anti-Slavery Society's meeting in Cleveland, called for the creation of an abolitionist party. They failed. Nevertheless, the supporters nominated Birney and Francis Julius LeMoyne as a presidential ticket at a meeting in Warsaw, New York. However, Birney declined the presidential nomination as he preferred a nomination to be made by a regular body of abolitionists and LeMoyne also declined the vice-presidential nomination. Smith and Holley made a call for an abolitionist nominating convention to be held on April 1, 1840, in Albany, New York. 121 delegates attended the delegation and selected a presidential ticket of Birney and Thomas Earle. which was accepted. It took the name Liberty Party.\nBirney was unable to campaign during the election as he was in England until November. The Liberty Party received opposition from followers of William Lloyd Garrison and abolitionist Whigs. The Liberty Party received 7,453 votes.\nGeneral election\nCampaign\nIn the wake of the Panic of 1837, Van Buren was widely unpopular, and Harrison, following Andrew Jackson's strategy, ran as a war hero and man of the people while presenting Van Buren as a wealthy snob living in luxury at the public expense. Although Harrison was comfortably wealthy and well educated, his \"log cabin\" image caught fire, sweeping all sections of the country.\nHarrison avoided campaigning on the issues, with his Whig Party attracting a broad coalition with few common ideals. The Whig strategy overall was to win the election by avoiding discussion of difficult national issues such as slavery or the national bank and concentrate instead on exploiting dissatisfaction over the failed policies of the Van Buren administration with colorful campaigning techniques.\nLog cabin campaign of William Henry Harrison\nHarrison was the first president to campaign actively for office. He did so with the slogan \"Tippecanoe and Tyler too\". Tippecanoe referred to Harrison's military victory over a group of Shawnee Native Americans at a river in Indiana called Tippecanoe in 1811. For their part, Democrats laughed at Harrison for being too old for the presidency, and referred to him as \"Granny\", hinting that he was senile. Said one Democratic newspaper: \"Give him a barrel of hard cider, and ... a pension of two thousand [dollars] a year ... and ... he will sit the remainder of his days in his log cabin.\"\nWhigs took advantage of this quip and declared that Harrison was \"the log cabin and hard cider candidate\", a man of the common people from the rough-and-tumble West. They depicted Harrison's opponent, President Martin Van Buren, as a wealthy snob who was out of touch with the people. In fact, it was Harrison who came from a family of wealthy planters, while Van Buren's father was a tavernkeeper. Harrison however moved to the frontier and for years lived in a log cabin, while Van Buren had been a well-paid government official.\nNonetheless, the election was held in the wake of the Panic of 1837, one of the worst economic depressions in the nation's history, and voters blamed Van Buren, seeing him as unsympathetic to struggling citizens. Harrison campaigned vigorously and won.\nResults\n31.9% of the voting age population and 80.3% of eligible voters participated in the election. This was the first time that a majority of southern voters participated in the election. (A majority in the north had first participated in an election in 1828.)\nHarrison won the support of western settlers and eastern bankers alike. Of the 1,179 counties/independent cities making returns, Harrison won in 699 (59.29%) while Van Buren carried 477 (40.46%). Three counties (0.25%) in the South split evenly between Harrison and Van Buren.\nThe extent of Van Buren's unpopularity was evident in Harrison's victories in New York, the president's home state, and in Tennessee, where Andrew Jackson himself had come out of retirement to stump for his former vice-president.\nThis was the first time a Democratic president lost re-election, as well as the first of only two times (the other being 1980) that a Democratic president lost re-election and lost the popular vote.\nThis was also the first election in U.S. history in which a candidate won more than a million popular votes.\nThis was the last election where  Indiana voted for the Whigs. It was also the only election where the Whigs won Maine, Michigan, and Mississippi. The election was also the last time that a majority of voters in Mississippi voted against the Democrats until 1872, the last in which a majority of voters in Indiana voted against Democrats until 1860, and the last in which a majority of voters in Maine and Michigan voted against Democrats until 1856. This is the only election in American history in which a majority of voters in Alabama and a majority of voters in Mississippi voted for different candidates.\nThe 1840 presidential election was the only time in which four people who either had been or would become a U.S. President (Van Buren, Harrison, Tyler, and Polk) received at least one vote in the Electoral College when it voted for president and vice-president.\nHarrison's victory won him precious little time as chief executive of the United States. After giving the longest inauguration speech in U.S. history (lasting about 1 hour and 45 minutes, in cold weather and rain), Harrison served only one month as president before dying of pneumonia on April 4, 1841.\nSource (Popular Vote):\nSource (Electoral Vote):\n(a) The popular vote figures exclude South Carolina where the Electors were chosen by the state legislature rather than by popular vote.\n|52.88}}\n|46.81}}\n}}\n|79.59}}\n|20.41}}\n}}\nGeography of results\nCartographic gallery\nPresidentialCounty1840Colorbrewer.gif|Map of presidential election results by county\nWhigPresidentialCounty1840Colorbrewer.gif|Map of Whig presidential election results by county\nDemocraticPresidentialCounty1840Colorbrewer.gif|Map of Democratic presidential election results by county\nLibertyPresidentialCounty1840Colorbrewer.gif|Map of Liberty presidential election results by county\nOtherPresidentialCounty1840Colorbrewer.gif|Map of \"Other\" presidential election results by county\nCartogramPresidentialCounty1840Colorbrewer.gif|Cartogram of presidential election results by county\nCartogramWhigPresidentialCounty1840Colorbrewer.gif|Cartogram of Whig presidential election results by county\nCartogramDemocraticPresidentialCounty1840Colorbrewer.gif|Cartogram of Democratic presidential election results by county\nCartogramLibertyPresidentialCounty1840Colorbrewer.gif|Cartogram of Liberty presidential election results by county\nCartogramOtherPresidentialCounty1840Colorbrewer.gif|Cartogram of \"Other\" presidential election results by county\nResults by state\nSource: Data from Walter Dean Burnham, Presidential ballots, 1836–1892 (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1955) pp 247–257.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|States/districts won by Van Buren\n|-\n|States/districts won by Harrison/Tyler\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 |\n! align=center colspan=3 | William Henry HarrisonWhig\n! align=center colspan=3 | Martin Van BurenDemocratic\n! align=center colspan=3 | James G.
