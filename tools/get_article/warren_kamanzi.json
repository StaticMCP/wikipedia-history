He also played futsal for Vegakameratene during the 2019–20 season.\nIn 2020 he signed a contract to become a part of the first team squad. In 2021, he was loaned out to Ranheim in the Norwegian First Division for the entire season.\nTromsø\nAt the start of 2022, Kamanzi signed for Tromsø. In the last match of 2022 Eliteserien, pundits discussed whether Kamanzi had performed the \"assist of the year\", following a rabona assist against Aalesund.\nToulouse\nOn 2 January 2023, Kamanzi signed for Ligue 1 club Toulouse in a transfer worth €600,000. He signed a contract until 2026.\nInternational career\nIn the autumn of 2022, Kamanzi was called up to the Rwanda national team. For the time being, he declined the call-up, hoping to instead be called up to the Norwegian under-21 team some time before the 2023 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. His first under-21 callup then came on 18 September 2022. Kamanzi featured in a victory over Switzerland at Marbella, before drawing 1–1 away in France in November 2022.\nCareer statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|National cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Europe\n!colspan=\"2\"|Other\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|Rosenborg\n|2020\n|Eliteserien\n|0||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||1||0\n|-\n|Ranheim\n|2021\n|OBOS-ligaen\n|19||2||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||22||2\n|-\n|Tromsø\n|2022\n|Eliteserien\n|28||4||3||1||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||31||5\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|Toulouse\n|2022–23\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Ligue 1\n|11||0||4||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||15||0\n|-\n|2023–24\n|24||0||2||0||6||0||1||0||32||0\n|-\n|2024–25\n|24||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||24||1\n|-\n|2025–26\n|10||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||10||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!69!!1!!6!!0!!6!!0!!1!!0!!82!!1\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"|Career total\n!116!!7!!12!!1!!7!!0!!1!!0!!136!!8\n|}\nHonours\nToulouse\n* Coupe de France: 2022–23\n* Trophée des Champions runner up: 2023\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
