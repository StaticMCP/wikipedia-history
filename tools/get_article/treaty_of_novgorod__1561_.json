It settled the common border, with Reval (Tallinn) submitted to Swedish rule since June, revised the truce established in the Treaty of Novgorod (1557) and renewed in early 1561 to last twenty years.  The treaty was renewed and extended by the Treaty of Dorpat (1564).\nSources\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120303161305/http://www.ieg-mainz.de/likecms/index.php?site=site.htm&dir=&nav=&siteid=133&treaty=689&page=2&lastsiteid=77&sq=&is_fts=1&filter_select=&filter_wt=&filter_id=&filter_l=&filter_p=&searchlang=de&searchstring=1561&date=&year_from=&year_till=&location= Scan of the treaty (IEG Mainz)]"
