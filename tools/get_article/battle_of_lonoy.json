It was fought in Lonoy, Jagna, Bohol on Bohol island.\nFilipino forces laid an ambush along a narrow path. They were poorly armed, with daggers, machetes, and spears and few firearms. The American force learned of the ambush from a pro-American local, Captain Francisco Acala, the last Spanish Mayor of Jagna. He led the Americans to the rear of the Filipinos. In a surprise attack, the Filipinos found themselves trapped in their own trenches. All but seven were killed, a total 406, including the commander, Captain Gregorio \"Guyo\" Casenas. Americans casualties were three killed and ten wounded, which came toward the end when the Filipinos launched a counter-attack.\nIn April 24, 2011, Captain Casenas and his men were honored by the municipality of Jagna with a statue at the municipal's plaza.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://philippineamericanwar.webs.com/thewarin19001901.htm Philippine–American War]"
