The conservation area is a popular location for recreation, including bush walking, scenic viewing, picnicking, camping, bird watching, rock climbing and horse riding. The park comprises six separate sections extending over 40 kilometres, from Stanwell Park in the north to Horsely in the south.\nThe 30-million-year-old site was inhabited by the Wodi Wodi for 20,000 years, and some of the summits in the region are of spiritual significance for the local Aboriginal people. It also has many colonial roads which were built by Surveyor-General Thomas Mitchell and convicts during 1834.\nSee also\n* Illawarra Escarpment\nReferences"
