Wynne and Franklin J. Horne.  It was noted for its big band entertainment and dancing.  After two fires, the club was rebuilt and opened on July 2, 1941, as the King and Prince Hotel.  Used as a training facility and radar station by the Navy during World War II, the island resort reopened its doors to the public in 1947.  In 1972 and 1982 the resort underwent substantial building renovations and expansions.\nThe King and Prince was the host of the 1957 Bilderberg Meeting.  The King and Prince Beach and Golf Resort was made a member of Historic Hotels of America in 1996, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.\nPhotos\nFile:King & Prince view 1, St Simons, Georgia.JPG|Main entrance\nFile:King & Prince logo, St Simons, Georgia.JPG|Logo\nKing and Prince Hotel NRHP plaque.JPG|Historic Hotels of America plaque and National Register of Historic Places plaque\nAerial of The King and Prince Resort.jpg|Aerial view\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
