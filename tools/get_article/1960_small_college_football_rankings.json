Separate rankings were published by the Associated Press (AP) and the United Press International (UPI). The AP rankings were selected by a board of experts, and the UPI rankings were selected by a board of 47 small-college coaches from throughout the country.\nThree small-college teams finished the 1960 season with perfect 10–0 records: the Ohio Bobcats, the Lenoir Rhyne Bears and the Humboldt State Lumberjacks. In their final vote, the AP board members selected Ohio as the small-college champion, based on its tougher strength of schedule. Lenoir Rhyne and Humboldt State finished second and third, respectively, in the AP rnakings.\nThe UPI board of coaches also selected Ohio as the small-college champion with first-place votes from 28 of the participating coaches. The UPI ranked Bowling Green second with its sole setback having been in a close loss to Ohio.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D8FFEB; width:20px; border:1px
