Inside the main temple there are other ancient idols of Lord Ganeśa, Hanumān. The temple is situated on the banks of the Khiḍkali Lake. There are several small temples near-by: Dattātreya, Hanumān and other Gurūs. There is a small park inside the temple campus for children's recreation.\nAccording to the legend, once when Pānḍavās visited this place during Araṇyavasām, Yudhiṣhṭhira wanted to perform Śiva pūja. So the Pānḍavās built this temple for Yudhiṣhṭhir‘s pūja.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://teerthayaatra.wordpress.com/2012/04/23/khi%e1%b8%8dkaleswar-mandir-shilphata-thane Link to a blog.]"
