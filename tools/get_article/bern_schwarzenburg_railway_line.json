It was built by the Bern-Schwarzenburg-Bahn (Bern-Schwarzenburg Railway, BSB). It was opened on 1 June 1907 between  and Schwarzenburg.\nA train derailed in Ausserholligen station on 28 June 1916 and a carriage and overturned; one passenger died and 20 were injured.\nThe railway company merged on 1 January 1944 with the Gürbetalbahn (GTB) to form the Gürbetal-Bern-Schwarzenburg-Bahn (GBS), which continued the operation of the BSB line.\nThe GBS was then part of an operating group led by the Bern–Lötschberg–Simplon railway (Bern-Lötschberg-Simplon-Bahn, BLS). The four group companies merged in 1997 to form the BLS Lötschberg Railway, which in turn merged with the Regionalverkehr Mittelland (RM) in 2006 to form BLS AG, which now owns the former BSB line.\nExternal links\nReferences\nFootnotes\nSources\n*"
