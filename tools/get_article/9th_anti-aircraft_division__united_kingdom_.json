It defended South Wales and the Severn Valley during The Blitz but only had a short career.\nMobilisation\nThe 9th Anti-Aircraft Division was one of five new divisions created on 1 November 1940 by Anti-Aircraft Command to control the expanding anti-aircraft (AA) defences of the United Kingdom. The 8th and the 9th AA Divisions were formed by splitting off parts of 5th AA Division. The 9th AA Division took over responsibility for South Wales, Gloucestershire, and Herefordshire.\nThe divisional headquarters (HQ) was at Cardiff and the General Officer Commanding (GOC) was Major-General Douglas Paige, MC, who had been commander, Corps Royal Artillery, of XI Corps. The existing 45th AA Brigade continued to control the whole South Wales area and report to the 5th AA Division until the end of 1940 while the 9th AA Division and 61st AA Brigade HQs were being established. 61st AA Brigade finally assumed responsibility at the beginning of February 1941.\nOf the formations and units assigned to the new division, a number had served with the British Expeditionary Force in the Battle of France and had been reformed and re-equipped in the Severn Valley and West Wales after the Dunkirk evacuation. The others were mainly Territorial Army units formed locally just before the outbreak of war.\nThe Blitz\nAt the time the 9th AA Division was created, the towns of South Wales, including important coal and oil port facilities, refineries, steelworks and ordnance factories, were under almost nightly air attack (the Cardiff Blitz and Swansea Blitz), to which the AA defences replied as best they could. The division's fighting units, organised into three AA Brigades, consisted of Heavy (HAA) and Light (LAA) gun units and Searchlight (S/L) units of the Royal Artillery. There were major concentrations of HAA guns in the Gun Defence Areas (GDAs) at Cardiff (covering Barry, Cardiff, and Newport) and Swansea (covering Llanelli, Port Talbot, and Swansea), LAA units were distributed to defend Vulnerable Points (VPs) such as docks and Glascoed Royal Ordnance Factory, while the S/L detachments were widely spread and crossed brigade boundaries.\nThe 1st Searchlight Regiment was deployed under both the 45th AA Brigade and the 61st AA Brigade to complete the 'Illuminated Area' in South Wales. The regiment assisted the AA guns of the Cardiff and Swansea GDAs and Night fighters of No. 10 Group RAF, while the S/L detachments occasionally engaged the raiders directly with their Light machine guns (LMGs). Meanwhile, the 37th (Tyne Electrical Engineers) S/L Rgt in the 5th AA Brigade had one battery operating the 'Cardiff–Newport Dazzle Area', others were at Hereford and Stonehouse, Gloucestershire, the latter also providing homing beacons for aircraft returning to RAF Colerne and RAF Moreton-in-Marsh. The latter batteries reported enemy air activity as 'slight' and 'small scale' during the winter of 1940–41, with one significant raid on Cheltenham on 11 December.\nThere was enemy air activity over the Bristol Channel and South Wales coast on most nights, but usually these were reconnaissances or nuisance raids, Heavier raids began against Cardiff and Swansea in January and February, 1941. The Luftwaffe began a new tactic of hitting the same towns on successive nights in an attempt to put them completely out of action. Swansea was the first town so attacked. On the night of 19/20 February the building housing both the Regimental HQ of the 79th (Hertfordshire Yeomanry) HAA Rgt and the Gun Operations Room (GOR) of the 61st AA Brigade at Swansea was destroyed by a bomb during a heavy raid. Two officers and five other ranks were killed or died of wounds, but the guns continued firing under local control and communications were maintained.\nThe Luftwaffe returned to continue the 'Swansea Blitz' on the nights of 20/21 and 21/22 February. On the latter night, there was confusion between the Sector Operations Room (SOR) at RAF Pembrey and the Swansea GOR, resulting in the guns ceasing fire between 20.20 and 21.10 but no night fighters arriving, leaving the town centre unprotected. Although some raiders were shot down once the restriction was lifted, the centre of Swansea was devastated, and fires and delayed-action bombs destroyed communications. The GOR had to be temporarily relocated to Neath.\nBy the end of February 1941, the HAA guns (3-inch and the newer 3.7-inch and 4.5-inch guns) in the Cardiff and Swansea GDAs only numbered 52 and 18 out of a planned establishment of 64 and 36 respectively. These had been increased a month later to 56 and 36, though further additions to the establishment were already being called for. The position on LAA gun sites was worse: only small numbers of Bofors 40 mm guns were available at the start of the Blitz, and most LAA detachments had to make do with LMGs.\nOrder of Battle 1940–41\nThe division's composition during the Blitz was as follows:\n* 5th AA Brigade – from France, covering Gloucester and Hereford\n** 85th (Tees) HAA Rgt (part) – from France\n** 88th HAA Rgt (part)\n** 47th LAA Rgt – new unit formed from part of 20th LAA Rgt\n** 37th (Tyne Electrical Engineers) S/L Rgt – from France\n* 45th AA Brigade – from 5th AA Division, covering Cardiff and Newport\n** 77th (Welsh) HAA Rgt\n** 85th (Tees) HAA Rgt (part)\n** 88th HAA Rgt (part)\n** 20th LAA Rgt\n** 34th LAA Rgt (part)\n** 1st S/L Rgt (part) – from France\n** 67th (Welch Regiment) S/L Rgt\n* 61st AA Brigade – formed by splitting 45th AA Brigade, covering Swansea and Milford Haven\n** 79th (Hertfordshire Yeomanry) HAA Rgt – from France\n** 34th LAA Rgt (part)\n** 1st S/L Rgt (part)\n* 8th AA 'Z' Regiment – new divisional unit equipped with Z Battery rocket launchers, formed in September 1940\n* 9th AA Divisional Signals, Royal Corps of Signals (RCS) – formed at Cardiff\n* 9th AA Divisional Royal Army Service Corps (RASC)\n** 95th Company\n** 914th Company – from 10th AA Division May 1941\n* 9th AA Divisional Company, Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC)\n* 9th AA Divisional Workshop Company, Royal Army Ordnance Corps (RAOC)\nMid-War\nAfter a busy period for the AA defences of South Wales in early May 1941, the Blitz effectively ended in the middle of the month. Desultory raiding continued through June and July while the gaps in AA defences were filled as more equipment and units became available. Searchlights, now assisted by Searchlight Control (SLC) radar, were reorganised, with a 'Killer Belt' established between the Cardiff and Bristol (the 8th AA Division) GDAs to cooperate closely with RAF night fighters. The HAA and support units increasingly became 'Mixed', indicating that women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) were fully integrated into them. At the same time, experienced units were posted away to train for service overseas (sometimes being lent back to AA Command while awaiting embarkation). This led to a continual turnover of units, which accelerated in 1942 with the preparations for the invasion of North Africa (Operation Torch) and the need to transfer AA units to counter the Luftwaffes Baedeker Blitz against largely unprotected towns and hit-and-run daylight attacks against South Coast towns.\nIn June 1942, the 5th AA Brigade HQ was transferred to the 5th AA Division defending the South Coast and was replaced by the 67th AA Brigade HQ from the 11th AA Division in the West Midlands. On 27 July 1942, the lights of the 37th S/L Rgt were engaged during a Baedeker raid on Cheltenham.\nOrder of Battle 1941–42\nDuring this period the division was composed as follows:\n* 5th AA Brigade – to the 5th AA Division June 1942\n** 52nd (London) HAA Rgt – from the 61st AA Brigade January 1942;
