Most of the northern part of the Rest Bay ward includes the course of the Royal Porthcawl Golf Club.\nRest Bay is a ward to Porthcawl Town Council, electing three of the nineteen town councillors.\nThe Rest Bay county electoral ward was created by The County Borough of Bridgend (Electoral Arrangements) Order 1998 and is represented by one county councillor on Bridgend County Borough Council.
