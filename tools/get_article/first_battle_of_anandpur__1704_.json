General Sayyid Khan was replaced by General Ramjan Khan. During the battle, Ramjan Khan was severely wounded after being hit by an arrow shot by Guru Gobind Singh while battling against the Khalsa Army at the well militarized fort of Anandpur Sahib. Hence, because of the failure of all their efforts, the Mughal forces were repulsed by the Sikhs, causing the Mughals to retreat.\nReferences"
