Reforms ranged from suppressing contemplative monasteries to asserting state oversight of seminaries and episcopal appointments. These policies, together with the radicalization of the French Revolution, generated pockets of Catholic resistance—some intellectual and pastoral, others openly insurgent—that contested the scope of state sovereignty over the Church.\nFrance\nCivil Constitution and the oath\nThe Civil Constitution of the Clergy (1790) reorganized dioceses, made clergy salaried state officials, and required an oath of loyalty. A substantial minority—later a majority—of bishops and many parish priests refused the oath, becoming “refractory” or “non‑juring” clergy. Papal briefs in 1791 condemned both the Constitution and the oath, sharpening the divide between constitutional clergy and resisters.\nRefractory clergy and underground worship\nRefusing priests celebrated mass in barns, private homes, forests, and coastal caves; laity created covert networks to hide clergy, signal safe houses, and circulate sacraments. Persecution peaked during dechristianization (1793–1794), when public worship was suppressed in many areas and the “cult of Reason” and “cult of the Supreme Being” briefly replaced Catholic rites. After Thermidor, toleration widened, but clandestine worship persisted where local authorities or patriots remained hostile.\nVendée and Chouannerie\nThe War in the Vendée (1793–1796) and related Chouan insurgencies in western France fused defense of religion, local autonomy, and royalism. Rural communities—often rallied by refractory priests and local nobles—resisted conscription and anti‑clerical measures. Government response was severe, producing cycles of guerrilla war, pacifications, and reprisals that left enduring memories of martyrdom and sacrificial fidelity among Catholic populations.\nÉmigré literature and networks\nClergy and lay émigrés built print networks in London, Rome, Turin, and German states. Works by Augustin Barruel, Joseph de Maistre, and Louis de Bonald framed the Revolution as a philosophical and conspiratorial assault on Christianity and social order. The apologetic turn reached a mass audience with François‑René de Chateaubriand’s Génie du christianisme (1802), which helped re‑legitimize Catholic culture in the Napoleonic era.\nHabsburg and German lands\nJoseph II’s ecclesiastical policies (the so‑called Josephinism) dissolved many contemplative houses, curtailed pilgrimages, and put seminaries under state direction. Resistance tended to be administrative and pastoral: bishops protested particular edicts, communities sought exemptions, and popular devotions re‑surfaced when surveillance loosened. After 1790, parts of the program were moderated, but secularization linked to revolutionary and Napoleonic wars led to broad confiscations of ecclesiastical territories and property in the German lands.\nItalian peninsula and the Papal States\nRevolutionary and Napoleonic armies exported church reforms across the peninsula, suppressing monastic houses and seizing assets. Papal responses under Pius VI and Pius VII combined doctrinal condemnation with diplomacy. Pius VI died in French captivity (1799); Pius VII, aided by Cardinal Ercole Consalvi, concluded the Concordat of 1801 with Napoleon, restoring public worship in France while recognizing certain state gains. In the Kingdom of Naples, Cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo’s Armata della Santa Fede (1799) mobilized popular and clerical forces to topple the short‑lived Parthenopean Republic.\nSpain and Iberian contexts\nLate Bourbon reformers curtailed aspects of ecclesiastical privilege and enacted limited confiscations, including the 1798 sale of certain church properties. Clerical responses varied by region, from accommodation to organized petitions. During the Peninsular War (1808–1814), parish clergy, religious symbols, and vows to “religión y rey” became rallying points for anti‑French resistance, intertwining Catholic identity with insurgent patriotism.\nLegacy\nThe Concordat framework normalized relations between state and Church across much of continental Europe, yet left lasting state leverage over appointments and property. Memories of persecution and clandestine fidelity fed nineteenth‑century ultramontanism, Marian devotions, and new congregations, while polemical narratives shaped conservative critiques of liberalism. The period also forged durable models of lay‑clerical organization—from clandestine worship cells to charitable societies—that would reappear in later conflicts over schooling, civil marriage, and church lands.\nNotable figures\nPope Pius VI (1717–1799): Issued briefs condemning the Civil Constitution and oath; died a prisoner after French occupation of the Papal States.\nPope Pius VII (1742–1823): Concluded the 1801 Concordat; later clashed with Napoleon and was held captive before the Restoration.\nCardinal Ercole Consalvi (1757–1824): Papal secretary of state and chief negotiator of the Concordat settlements.\nCardinal Fabrizio Ruffo (1744–1827): Organizer of the Sanfedisti army that overthrew the Parthenopean Republic.\nAugustin Barruel (1741–1820): Jesuit publicist whose multi‑volume polemic blamed philosophes and secret societies for the Revolution.\nJoseph de Maistre (1753–1821): Royalist philosopher defending throne and altar against revolutionary ideology.\nLouis de Bonald (1754–1840): Theorist of traditional society and Catholic monarchy; influential in Restoration debates.\nFrançois‑René de Chateaubriand (1768–1848): Author of Génie du christianisme, a cultural apology for Catholicism in 1802.\nHenry Essex Edgeworth (1745–1807): Irish‑born non‑juring priest, confessor to Louis XVI, emblematic of clerical exile networks.\nJean‑François de La Marche (1729–1806): Bishop of Saint‑Pol‑de‑Léon who refused the oath and advocated for refractory clergy.\nSee also\nJosephinism\nCivil Constitution of the Clergy\nWar in the Vendée\nChouannerie\nConcordat of 1801\nUltramontanism\nReferences\nNigel Aston, Religion and Revolution in France, 1780–1804 (Washington, D.C.: Catholic University of America Press, 2000).\nJohn McManners, The French Revolution and the Church (London: SPCK, 1969).\nOwen Chadwick, The Popes and European Revolution (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981).\nDerek Beales, Joseph II: Volume II, Against the World, 1780–1790 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009).\nUlrich L.
