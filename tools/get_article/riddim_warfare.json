Club said, \"the record is a surprisingly lithe and notably straightforward exercise in hip-hop psychedelia.\" Marc Weingarten of Vibe called it \"the most cohesive and rhythmically righteous album of his career.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n* DJ Spooky – nmbara, wind chimes, gongs, street noises, additional vocals, bass, electric guitar on track 3, acoustic guitar on track 8\n* Sir Menelik – vocals on tracks 3, 9\n* Kool Keith – vocals on tracks 3, 17\n* Akin Atoms – guitar on tracks 4, 14, 20\n* Karsh Kale – drums on tracks 4, 14, 20\n* Arto Lindsay – guitar on track 7\n* Lucio Maia – guitar on track 7\n* Dhengue – bass on track 7\n* Jorge Du Peixe – drums on track 7\n* Gulmar Bola8 – drums on track 7\n* Gira – drums on track 7\n* Pupilo – drums on track 7\n* Toca Ogan – percussion on track 7\n* Marcos Matias – percussion on track 7\n* Prince Poetry – vocals on track 8\n* Pharoah Monch – vocals on track 8\n* Vinicius Cantuaria – acoustic guitar on track 8\n* Ambassador Jr. – vocals and scratches on track 10\n* Grisha Coleman – vocals on track 11\n* Killah Priest – vocals on track 13\n* Manny Oquendo – keyboard on tracks 14, 20\n* Micah Gaugh – saxophone on track 14\n* Julia Sher – vocals on track 16\n* Thurston Moore – guitar on track 19\n* Ben Neil – trumpet on track 20\n* Mariko Mori – vocals on track 21\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
