Two books were often printed in one volume, and 49 works in all were in 37 volumes. Washington Irving's Bracebridge Hall, ''Traveller's Tales and Oliver Goldsmith were included. There were also the Memoirs'' of Sir Fowell Buxton. Melville's works Typee and Omoo were at first issued separately. Murray required that Typee appear as Four Months among the Natives of the Marquesas.\nNotes\nExternal links\n* [http://www.publishinghistory.com/home-and-colonial-library-john-murray.html Home and Colonial Library (John Murray) - Book Series List] - includes series description"
