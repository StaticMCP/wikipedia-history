The Five Dynasties refer to the succession of dynasties which ruled northern China following the Tang collapse while the Ten Kingdoms, with the exception of Northern Han, ruled in southern China. This era of division ended in 979 AD with the rise of the Song dynasty under Emperor Taizu of Song, although the Song would never reconquer the northern territory lost to the Khitans, collectively known as the Sixteen Prefectures.\n900s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n! style=\"width:6%\" | Year || style=\"width:10%\" | Date || Event\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" valign=\"top\" | 907 || || Later Liang: Zhu Wen deposes Emperor Ai of Tang and founds the Later Liang in Kaifeng, ruling over North China\n|-\n| || Later Liang: The Khúc clan takes control of Annam and establishes tributary relations with Later Liang\n|-\n| || Jin: Li Keyong stays independent as Jin in Shanxi\n|-\n| || Chu: Later Liang makes Ma Yin Prince of Chu\n|-\n| || Wuyue: Qian Liu becomes Prince of Wuyue\n|-\n| || Former Shu: Wang Jian declares himself emperor of Former Shu in Chengdu\n|-\n| 908 || || Jin: Li Keyong dies and is succeeded by his son Li Cunxu\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\" | 909 || || Later Liang: Zhu Wen moves the Ancestral Temple to Luoyang\n|-\n| || Min: Wang Shenzhi becomes Prince of Min in Fuzhou\n|}\n910s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n! style=\"width:6%\" | Year || style=\"width:10%\" | Date || Event\n|-\n| 911 || || Yan: Liu Shouguang declares Yan around modern day Beijing\n|-\n| 912 || || Later Liang: Zhu Wen is killed by his son Zhu Yougui, who usurps power\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\" | 913 || || Jin: Defeats Liu Shouguang\n|-\n| || Later Liang: Zhu Yougui is killed by his brother Zhu Youzhen, who seizes power and moves the capital to Kaifeng\n|-\n| 916 || || Abaoji declares himself emperor of the Khitans\n|-\n| 917 || || Southern Han: Liu Yan declares himself emperor of Great Yue in Guangzhou\n|-\n| 918 || || Southern Han: Liu Yan renames Great Yue to Southern Han\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\" | 919 || || Wu: Yang Longyan declares himself Prince of Wu\n|-\n| || The gunpowder slow match appears in China.\n|}\n920s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n! style=\"width:6%\" | Year || style=\"width:10%\" | Date || Event\n|-\n| 922 || || Abaoji raids Jin\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | 923 || || Later Tang: Li Cunxu conquers Later Liang and founds Later Tang\n|-\n| || Qi: Li Maozhen submits to Later Tang\n|-\n| || Abaoji raids Later Tang\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\" | 924 || || Later Tang: Capital is moved to Luoyang\n|-\n| || Jingnan: Gao Jixing becomes Prince of Nanping in Jingzhou\n|-\n| 925 || || Later Tang: Conquers Former Shu and names Luoyang its Eastern Capital\n|-\n| 926 || || Later Tang: Li Cunxu is killed and Li Siyuan becomes emperor in Luoyang\n|}\n930s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n! style=\"width:6%\" | Year || style=\"width:10%\" | Date || Event\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\" | 930 || || Southern Han: Invades Annam and removes the Khúc clan from power\n|-\n| || Later Tang: Yelü Bei flees to Later Tang\n|-\n| 931 || || Southern Han: Dương Đình Nghệ expels Southern Han from Đại La and declares himself governor\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\" | 932 || || Wuyue: Qian Liu dies and is succeeded by his son Qian Yuanguan who dies not long after and is succeeded by Li Congke\n|-\n| || The Twelve Classics and other texts are printed\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\" | 934 || || Later Tang: Li Siyuan dies and is succeeded by his son Li Conghou\n|-\n| || Later Shu: Meng Zhixiang declares himself emperor of Later Shu and dies not long after and is succeeded by his son Meng Chang\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\" | 936 || 28 November || Later Jin: Khitans install Shi Jingtang as emperor of the Later Jin.
