After the war, he remained in Europe, working for Lucille, Paul Poiret, and Molyneux, and designing for the theatre. He returned to America in 1921, and through his theatre work was hired as chief designer for Famous Players–Lasky studios, which was later to emerge from several reorganizations and mergers as Paramount Pictures.\nGreer left his post at Paramount and opened his own couture operation in Hollywood in December 1927, where he designed custom clothing for the stars until his retirement in 1962. He also continued to create costumes for films into the 1950s, and designed mass-market clothing. Greer designed the wedding gowns of actress Bessie Love and socialite Gloria Vanderbilt.\nHis best-known film work includes the Katharine Hepburn films Christopher Strong (1933) and Bringing Up Baby (1938), and the gowns for 1940's My Favorite Wife.\nGreer published an autobiography, Designing Male, in 1951.\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n*\n*\n* [http://www.virtual-history.com/movie/person/30636/howard-greer Howard Greer] at Virtual History\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160422080014/http://www.corbisimages.com/stock-photo/rights-managed/U745434INP/dorothy-parker-sitting-down/?tab=details&caller=search Howard Greer], 1935, back row center behind Dorothy Parker in hat (Wayback Machine)"
