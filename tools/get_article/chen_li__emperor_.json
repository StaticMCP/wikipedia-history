He reigned from 1363 to 1364.\nBiography\nChen Li was born in Mianyang ( now Xiantao, Hubei) as the second son of Chen Youliang, the first emperor of the Chen Han during the Yuan-Ming transition. His brother, Chen Shan (), was a crown prince who joined the Ming army.\nIn 1363, his father, Chen Youliang, was shot by an arrow in the Battle of Poyang Lake. His brother, Chen Shan, fled to the Ming. Later, Zhang Dingbian () and other top generals protected Chen Li and his descendants, escorting Chen to Wuchang, where Chen succeeded the throne and changed era name to Deshou (). In the winter of the same year, Zhu Yuanzhang personally visited Wuchang.\nChen Youliang's father, Chen Pucai, was named Marquess of Cheng'en (), his eldest brother, Chen Youfu (), was named Earl of Guiren (), and his second brother, Chen Youzhi, was named Earl of Huai'en (). He posthumously presented his fourth brother, Chen Youren (), as King of Kangshan (), and ordered the relevant officials to set up a temple to offer sacrifices, and his fifth brother, Chen Yougui (), was in charge of sacrifices.\nIn 1364, he surrendered to Zhu Yuanzhang of the rising Ming dynasty. Zhu then appointed him Marquis of Gui'de (). Chen was later sent to Korea, where he became known as King Chen. In Korea, Chen settled down and had children, starting the Yangsan Jin Clan (see below).\nDescendants\nSome of Chen Li's descendants after the Chen Han and Ming have the surname Cheng ().\nYangsan Jin clan\nAccording to Korean and Chinese historical sources, in 1372, he migrated to Goryeo and had offspring, starting the Yangsan Jin clan. One of his known sons was Chen Mingshan ().\nOn 19 May 1372, Chen Li and Ming Sheng () arrived in Korea with a group of 27 people, who were received by the King of Korea. At that time, Chen Li was 22 years old.\nAfter Chen Li arrived in Korea, he was called Chen Wang () or King Chen. On 6 June, King Gongmin () gave Chen Li nine bamboo cloths (). Chen was also given some land, a wife, housemaid, and food. During this time he had children, including Chen Mingshan. Chen Li died due to illness but is survived by his descendants in Korea and the Yangsan Jin Clan.\nSee also\n* Yangsan Jin clan (Chen's descendants in Korea)\n* Ming Yuzhen\n* Yeonan Myeong clan\n* Seochok Myeong clan\nNotes\nCitations\nFurther reading\n* The Cambridge History of China Volume 7, pp. 65-89"
