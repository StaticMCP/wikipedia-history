He supposedly was the first one to use an electric tattoo machine in Germany.\nBiographical and career information\nWarlich was born and raised in Hannover-Linden. He left his parental home at the age of 14, went to Dortmund and reportedly became a boilermaker. He went to sea and might have had contact with tattooists in the US. He got married in 1914 in Hamburg and opened a pub at Kieler Straße 44 (today Clemens-Schultz-Straße) around 1919. There was a separate area where he tattooed. His grandson and Theodor Vetter, a close friend of the family, worked as a business tout for Warlich.\nAccording to his own account Warlich tattooed „everything the male body should express […] politics, eroticism, athleticism, aesthetics, religion, in all colours, at every location.“ Though, in the context of a legal dispute about a face tattoo which was done by a competitor, Warlich claimed „a decent tattooer does not tattoo a face.“\nIn over 40 years of working as a tattooist he had more than 50.000 customers, also Prince Axel and Prince Viggo from the Danish Royal family.  Warlich died at work in his pub.\nAfter Warlich's death Theodor Vetter (Tattoo Theo) took care of a part of the estate, the second part, including the famous flash book (Vorlagealbum) and photos, was sold to the Museum für Hamburgische Geschichte in 1965. So it was possible to show Warlich's flash book in the exhibit „Wohin mit der Stadt“ in 2013. The Museum für Hamburgische Geschichte is planning to re-publish the Vorlagealbum, which was previously brought out by Stephan Oettermann. In 1981, he published the album with an accompanying text in cooperation with the museum. Although, over the next ten years, three editions of the volume were published, it is no longer available today.\nOettermann's publication was a groundbreaking and pioneering work. However, the low reproduction quality of the images do not entirely do justice to Warlich's work. The quality of the original designs deviates strikingly from that of the reproductions. Therefore, a completely new and appropriate edition is planned.\nResearch project\n- Museum Hamburger Geschichte 2019]]\nThe Hamburg-based art historian Ole Wittmann was the head of the research project „Der Nachlass des Hamburger Tätowierers Christian Warlich (1891–1964)“ – also known as „[https://www.nachlasswarlich.de/ Nachlass Warlich]“ – which is carried out in cooperation with the Museum für Hamburgische Geschichte. Wittmann is a postdoc scholarship holder of the Hamburg Foundation for the Promotion of Science and Culture (Hamburger Stiftung zur Förderung von Wissenschaft und Kultur).\nThe exhibition Tattoo Legends. Christian Warlich in St Pauli was on display in the Museum of Hamburg History from 27 November 2019. It was a large-scale show about Warlich, who became known as the ‘King of Tattooists’ and is considered one of the most important tattooists of the 20th century. On 13 March 2020 the museum was suddenly closed to visitors due to the COVID 19 pandemic.\nOn March 20 the exhibition was the only current international special exhibition that could be [https://my.matterport.com/show/?m=fv4HDgwSFmu visited online]. A show that had already been declared dead was reanimated only a few days after the sudden lockdown and there was active participation of a community in the topic of tattoo history. In addition, the online tour allowed virtual excursions and curatorial tours, among others for a seminar at the Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel.\nThe virtual tour was awarded gold at the Annual Multimedia Award 2021 in the category ‘Events on the Internet’.\nMHG 2020 Warlich 01.jpg\nMHG 2020 Warlich 02.jpg\nMHG 2020 Warlich 03.jpg\nMHG 2020 Warlich Finke Dix 01.jpg\nWarlich MHG 2020 Manfred Kohrs.jpg\nMHG 2020 Warlich Vetter 01.jpg\nCeramic artist Antony Natsoulas created this artwork for the special exhibition \"Tattoo Legends.
