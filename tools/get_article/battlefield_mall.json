Opened in 1970, the mall features 153 stores in  of mall shop space. The anchor stores are JCPenney, Dillard's, and Macy's. There are 2 vacant anchor stores that were formerly separate Dillard's Women's and Men's stores. It is managed and owned by Simon Property Group, the successor of the same company that built it.\nHistory\nMelvin Simon & Associates, now known as Simon Property Group, built and developed Battlefield Mall. Their plans had begun in 1963 with a proposed Montgomery Ward department store. By 1968, J. C. Penney and Dillard's had also been confirmed as the second and third anchor stores. After two years of construction, it opened to the public on July 23, 1970. On opening day, the mall was 93 percent occupied, consisting of  of shop space along with the three department stores. Among the tenants of the mall at the time were a McCrory dime store, Piccadilly Restaurants, and Osco Drug. After only five years in operation, the McCrory store was closed and converted to local department store Heer's, which opened there in 1975.\nThe mall's owners announced an expansion plan in 1979, to consist of over  of mall shops and two new anchor stores. Upon opening in 1982, this expansion added about 85 stores, including a Sears department store and a new location for Dillard's. At the same time, the original location of Dillard's in the mall was sold to Famous-Barr. In 2001, following the closure of Montgomery Ward, Dillard's moved some of its departments into the former Montgomery Ward location, while retaining other departments in the store built in 1982. This new store, known as Dillard's South, opened in 2002. The addition of Dillard's South allowed the chain to offer a greater variety of merchandise between the two stores.\nOn May 30, 1998, Old Navy opened at the mall. Another anchor store change ensued in 2006 when Federated Department Stores (now Macy's, Inc.) acquired Famous-Barr's parent company The May Department Stores Company, and renamed all of that company's stores to Macy's.\nOn February 6, 2020, Sears announced it would close its Battlefield Mall location in mid April 2020, as part of a plan to close 39 stores nationwide.\nOn February 6, 2025 Dillard's announced that it would move into the former Sears space on the west side of the mall, consolidating its separate Men's and Women's stores into one larger store. The new Dillard's store opened on July 31, 2025.\nNotes\nExternal links\n*[http://www.simon.com/mall/battlefield-mall Official website, including complete store listing]"
