The Ottomans were invited by Karl Thopia to support him in his feud against Balša II.\nBackground\nIn 1372, Balša II married Comita Muzaka, the daughter of Andrea II Muzaka. As a dowry, Balša II gained Vlorë, Berat, Kaninë and Himarë which constitued the Principality of Vlorë. This arrangement, made after the death of Alexander Komnenos Asen in 1371, also ensured Balša's support against mutual enemies like Marko. It's unclear whether Muzaka had already conquered the cities or if Balša was planning to take them, but the agreement solidified Balša's claim to the territories through marriage. By 1383 or 1385, Balša II had conquered Durrës, presumably from Karl Thopia and in a charter issued to Ragusa during this period, he referred to himself as \"Duke of Durrës\". The expansion of Balša's realm into Epirus brought him to the frontline against the Ottomans. Aware of Ottoman aspirations to his territory, on 8 August 1385 Balša II asked Venetians to support him with four galleys.\nBattle\nKarl Thopia invited the Ottomans to support him in his conflict with Balša II. Thopia's invitation was accepted and Hayreddin Pasha brought his forces from the region of Ohrid (modern-day Macedonia) to Saurian field, near Lushnjë. News about the incursion of the Ottoman forces into the region of Berat reached Balša II while he was in Durrës. According to Mavro Orbini, Balša II rounded up 1,000 men in Durrës and, ignoring the advice of his nobles, headed out to take on the Ottoman raiders. Unsurprisingly, Balša's small forces had little success and Balša II was killed. Orbini's work is the only source that mentions Ivaniš Mrnjavčević as participating in this battle. Some scholars believe he did not even exist, while others believe that he was not an independent medieval lord, but a loyal member of the Balša family. Another person mentioned only by Orbini is Balša's voivode Đurađ Krvavčić, described as a brave warrior who also died in this battle. Mavrini explains that the body of Balša II was decapitated and his head taken to Hayreddin Pasha.\nAftermath\nSince the Ottomans were victorious, most of the local Serbian and Albanian lords became their vassals. Immediately after this battle Thopia recaptured Durrës, probably under the Ottoman suzerainty. The Ottomans captured Krujë, Berat, and Ulcinj but soon retreated from them, keeping only Kastoria under their permanent control.\nThe work of Mavro Orbini (The Realm of the Slavs) is one of the main primary sources about this battle. It contains many incorrect and imprecise data. Another primary source about the Battle of Savra is Marin Barleti who says that Balša II was brave and idealistic.\nThis battle set the foundation for centuries-long Ottoman presence in this part of the Balkans. Serbian historian Stojan Novaković emphasized that the battle's importance for these Serbian and Albanian lords was comparable to that of the Battle of Marica and Battle of Kosovo put together. The important result of this battle was the influx of Albanians into Ottoman forces who remained a significant source of its strength during the next 527 years.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
