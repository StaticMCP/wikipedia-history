On General Aslan Maskhadov's orders, the Chechen resistance shifted from conventional warfare to guerrilla warfare, relying on the mountains.\nBattle\nOn March 6, 1996, Chechen fighters launched a surprise attack on Grozny, striking from three directions and encircling outlying Russian posts and  local pro-Moscow Chechen police stations, catching Russian troops off guard, inflicting significant losses, overrunning much of it and capturing weapons and ammunition stores. The attack was supposedly intended to show that the Chechens could still operate against Russian forces.\nAftermath\nThree days later, after the Chechens left the city, fighting in the Grozny continued for several more days; the Russian units that entered Grozny periodically engaged in battle with one another, mistaking each other for the enemy.\nPresident Dzokhar Dudayev allegedly called the attack a \"little harassing operation\". The attack was only a rehearsal for a much larger operation that took place in August 1996.\nSee also\n* Battle of Grozny (disambiguation)\n* Battle of Grozny (August 1996)\nNotes\nSources\n*\n*\n* https://reliefweb.int/report/russian-federation/chechnya-russian-federation-situation-report-1-february-14-march-1996"
