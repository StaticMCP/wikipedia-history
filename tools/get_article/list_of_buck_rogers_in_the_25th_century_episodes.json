He awakens in the year 2491 aboard the alien flagship Draconia which is headed to Earth disguised as a diplomatic mission. The Draconians repair Buck's shuttle, but secretly plant a homing beacon aboard to track its way through Earth's defense shield. Upon arriving at Earth, Buck is escorted to the city of New Chicago by starfighters commanded by Colonel Wilma Deering. Once at the city, Buck is met by Dr. Elias Huer who tells him he is now in the 25th century and that everyone he knew had been killed centuries ago in a nuclear holocaust. When the tracking device is discovered, the authorities accuse Buck of espionage, but Buck claims the Draconians have set him up and that their representative, the ravishing Princess Ardala, is arriving in an armed warship which violates the peace treaty with Earth. The authorities refuse to believe Buck and sentence him to be executed. However, Wilma has second thoughts and arranges to give Buck a chance to prove his innocence. Wilma and Buck lead a force of Starfighters to the Draconian ship to surreptitiously search it, but before they can the ship is attacked by seven Marauders (in reality Draconian ships masquerading as pirates); in the ensuing combat Buck shoots down most of the attackers and saves Wilma's life. When a celebration of the treaty with Draconia ensues on Earth, Buck sets out to prove the Draconians' hostile intent by seducing Ardala, returning with her to the Draconian ship, and sabotaging her attack fighters before she can launch them against Earth.\n----\nNote: This two-hour pilot episode is a revised version of the theatrical release Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, with a different opening credit sequence, additional scenes, and also the use of Vic Perrin as voice of the Draconia's PA system.

Armat believes his competitor, the feared crime boss Morgan Velosi, kidnapped Felina because she knows too much about his organization after stumbling upon a computer code that controls three-fourths of Armat's covert operations. If helped, Armat offers to turn himself in for his crimes, for Felina is not only an employee, but his daughter as well (a fact of which she is unaware). Huer initially refuses but is persuaded by Major Marla Landers when she questions that Armat has technical secrets of Draconian Marauders that have been preying on Earth's shipping lanes.

During the attack, Buck and Wilma are captured by Corliss and his wife Roxanne Trent who both show off horrible scars from injuries they received thanks to Wilma during a previous confrontation.
