In 2002, the Commission was dissolved and most of its functions transferred to the newly created China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC).\nIn response to their swelling debt loads, undercapitalization and non-transparent business practices, the government of China recapitalized the banks and set up the CBRC as the country's independent banking regulator in 2003. Liu Mingkang was appointed its first chairman and served until 2011, when he was replaced by Shang Fulin. In 2017, Shang was replaced by Guo Shuqing as the new chairman.\nActive in developing policies to promote financial inclusion, the Bank is a member of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion.\nIn April 2018, as part of the deepening the reform of the Party and state institutions, the China Banking Regulatory Commission was merged with the China Insurance Regulatory Commission to form the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission.\nSee also\n* China Securities Journal\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
