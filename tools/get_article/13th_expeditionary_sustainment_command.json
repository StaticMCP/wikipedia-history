Fogg\n| identification_symbol =\n| identification_symbol_label = Distinctive unit insignia\n| identification_symbol_2 =\n| identification_symbol_2_label =\n}}\nThe 13th Armored Corps Sustainment Command—the \"Lucky 13th\"—is a U.S. Army modular sustainment command which serves as a forward presence for expeditionary operations for a theater, or in support of a regional combatant commander. Corps Sustainment Commands (CSC), such as the 13th, synchronize distribution of supplies and services within their operational areas and provides distribution oversight. Formed at Fort Hood, Texas when the 1st Logistics Command deployed to Vietnam, the organization then known as the 13th Support Brigade was initially responsible for the training of technical services units to assume combat service support missions in Southeast Asia.\nAs the Army redefined the missions of its logistics forces in response to building towards a 16-division Army, it was designated a corps support command (COSCOM). In 1992, the 13th COSCOM deployed to Somalia as part of Operation Restore Hope where for the first time a COSCOM was given the mission to provide theater-level support in a major U.S. operation. The 13th ACSC has deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kuwait, and served as the logistics command for hurricane relief efforts in support of the American people after hurricanes Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita devastated the Gulf Coast.\nOrganization\nThe 13th Armored Corps Sustainment Command was constituted on 11 August 1965 in the Regular Army, and activated 24 September 1965 at Fort Hood, Texas as the 13th Support Brigade. The 13th Support Brigade was formed as the nation's involvement in Vietnam increased, and was tasked with the training of technical services units to assume combat service support missions in Southeast Asia. With reorganization from the \"technical service\" concept to the \"combat service to the Army\" concept, functional training of units was decentralized in the Continental Army Command to post, camp and station level.\nThe command continued to evolve due to increased missions and changing roles. Along with similar units, it was redesignated as 13th Corps Support Command (COSCOM) on 21 June 1975, and then the 13th Support Command (Corps) on 16 October 1980. As part of Army Transformation, it was reflagged to its current configuration as the 13th Sustainment Command (Expeditionary) during a formal ceremony on 23 February 2006.\nInsignia\nThe distinctive unit insignia was originally approved for the 13th Support Brigade on 25 August 1966. It was redesignated for the 13th Corps Support Command and amended to revise the symbolism effective 21 June 1975. The insignia was redesignated for the 13th Support Command on 17 October 1980. It was redesignated for the 13th Corps Support Command on 10 August 1989. The insignia was redesignated for the 13th Sustainment Command on 7 March 2006.\nDescription/Blazon\nA gold color metal and enamel insignia  in height overall consisting of a blue star of thirteen points, one point up, bearing a gold saltire between three smaller gold saltires, all above a gold scroll, the middle section surmounting the star, inscribed \"SERVICE TO THE SOLDIER\" in red letters.\nSymbolism\nThe star of thirteen points refers to the unit's numerical designation. The central saltire stands for the command and the three smaller saltires for the Corps which it supports. The colors gold (for buff), red and blue are used in the flags of combat service support units. They refer to the supply and service, maintenance, transportation and other support functions of the command.\nShoulder Sleeve Insignia (Patch)\nThe shoulder sleeve insignia was originally approved for the 13th Support Brigade on 11 August 1966. It was redesignated for the 13th Corps Support Command and amended to revise the symbolism effective 21 June 1975. The insignia was redesignated for the 13th Support Command on 17 October 1980. It was redesignated for the 13th Corps Support Command on 10 August 1989. The insignia was redesignated for the 13th Sustainment Command on 7 March 2006.\nDescription/Blazon\nOn a yellow octagon with a  blue border  in height overall, a scarlet saltire throughout surmounted by a blue star of thirteen points fimbriated in yellow.\nSymbolism\nThe octagon reinforced by the saltire refers to the unit's mission of supporting the combat, combat support and combat service support organizations of the Corps. The star symbolizes the many far reaching missions of the command, and having thirteen points, the star also alludes to its numerical designation. The octagon is a symbol of regeneration; it alludes to the combat service support functions of the unit as consistently renewing the strength and vigor of the Corps.\nYellow (substituted for Quartermaster buff) alludes to the supply and service functions of the command. Scarlet (substituted for Ordnance crimson and Transportation brick red) alludes to the maintenance and transportation functions of the command. The blue represents other support rendered by the command. This combination identifies the colors which are used in the flags of combat service support organizations.\nEarthquake Relief, Managua, Nicaragua\nSoldiers of the 13th ACSC first deployed as the 13th Support Brigade in response to the Managua earthquake, where its soldiers served at Camp Christine, Managua, Nicaragua, assisting in disaster relief from 23 December 1972 to 19 January 1973. Units of the 13th deployed in Nicaragua included:\n*21st Evacuation Hospital\n*255th Medical Detachment\n*528th Transportation Company (-)\nDesert Storm\nThough the headquarters did not deploy to Desert Shield and Desert Storm, units from the 13th COSCOM began to deploy in the fall of 1990 to Saudi Arabia to provide combat support and combat service support during the Gulf War. During Operation Desert Calm and Operation Provide Comfort, soldiers of the 13th ESC deployed to the Persian Gulf area. In 1992, 13th COSCOM soldiers deployed to Cuba to aid Haitian refugees during Operation Safe Harbor, and later assisted victims of Hurricane Andrew in Florida. 13th ESC soldiers led the way as III Corps units deployed to Kuwait to train and ensure the peace in support of Operation Intrinsic Action.\nOperation Restore Hope\nIn 1992, the U.S. Central Command established Unified Task Force Somalia (UNITAF) in light of the worsening situation in Somalia and 13th COSCOM was called to duty. 13th COSCOM Commander Brig. Gen. Billy K. Solomon deployed along with a portion of the 13th COSCOM headquarters to Mogadishu to serve as the nucleus of Joint Task Force Support Command, the first time where a COSCOM was given the mission to provide theater-level support. Soldiers of the Lucky 13th returned in May 1993.\nTheir major units included:\n:593rd Corps Support Group (Fort Lewis)\n:36th Engineer Group (Fort Benning)\n:7th Transportation Group (Fort Eustis)\n:62nd Medical Group (Fort Lewis)\nHumanitarian aid and peacekeeping\nFrom October through December 1994, 13th COSCOM soldiers provided multifunctional logistical support to Army forces supporting Operation Vigilant Warrior in Kuwait. Units of the 13th COSCOM conducted humanitarian and/or peacekeeping missions in Cuba as part of Operation Sea Signal V, Haiti Operation Uphold Democracy, Honduras JTF-B, Operation Strong Support, and were a part of Stabilization Force (SFOR) 6 in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The 13th COSCOM also deployed their engineers to Thule Air Base, Greenland, for additional support missions.\nSoldiers from the command have assisted in removing snow in Massachusetts, aiding flood victims in Louisiana, processing refugees in Arkansas, fighting forest fires in Montana, assisting earthquake victims in Mexico or helping flood victims in Curio, Texas.\nFollowing the attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon, elements of the 13th COSCOM supported Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.\nOperation Iraqi Freedom\nOperation Iraqi Freedom again saw 13th COSCOM units deployed, including 64th Corps Support Group, directly supporting the 4th Infantry Division. Elements of the 49th Movement Control Battalion have been continuously deployed in the region since 1997 and remain a critical node supporting all U.S. and coalition forces.\n13th COSCOM first deployed a medical evacuation headquarters and an air evacuation company on 12 February 2003, to Kuwait. Those units were to reposition forces as required to support the president's global war on terrorism. Eventually, the 13th COSCOM deployed both of its local Brigades in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom while the headquarters and separate units supported the families at Fort Hood, Texas.\nIn August 2003 deployment notification came for the soldiers of the 13th COSCOM headquarters to participate in the ongoing operations in Iraq. In preparation for its first major deployment since Somalia, the 13th COSCOM colors were cased in a deployment and retreat ceremony held on the afternoon of 18 December 2004, at Sadowski Field on Fort Hood.\nOIF II\nCampaign: Transition of Iraq - 2 May 2003 to 28 June 2004\nCampaign: Iraqi Governance - 29 June 2004 to 15 December 2005\nOn 31 January 2004, the 13th COSCOM completed a transfer of authority with the 3rd Corps Support Command (COSCOM) at Logistics Support Area (LSA) Anaconda in Balad, Iraq, and assumed responsibility to provide logistics support to Combined Joint Task Force 7 in Iraq, later redesignated as the Multi-National Corps Iraq (MNC-I).\nMajor units serving with the 13th COSCOM for OIF II were:\n* Corps Distribution Command (Provisional)\n* 172nd Corps Support Group (Broken Arrow, Oklahoma)\n* 1st Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division(-) (January–April 2004) (Fort Bragg, North Carolina)\n* 81st BCT(-) (April–December 2004) (WAARNG)\n* 593rd Corps Support Group (Fort Lewis, Washington)\n* 167th Corps Support Group (Londonderry, New Hampshire)\n* 300th Area Support Group (Fort Lee, Virginia)\n* 362nd Military Police Detachment (Ashley, Pennsylvania)\n* 2632nd AEFTC Air Force transportation company(Joint Air force command of vehicle ops 2t1x1)\nOn 12 December 2004, the 13th COSCOM transferred authority to the 1st Corps Support Command. During its time at LSA Anaconda, the 13th COSCOM processed 2,000 tons of mail; averaged over 200 convoys a day for a total of 62,000 convoys involving 750,000 vehicles; and was responsible for quality of life improvements for the joint forces. The 13th COSCOM uncased its colors, signifying its return home and the end of its mission, at Fort Hood, Texas, on 21 January 2005.\nOIF 06-08\nCampaign: National Resolution - 16 December 2005 to 9 January 2007\nCampaign: Iraqi Surge – 10 January 2007 to 31 December 2008\nThe 13th, under its new designation as a sustainment command (expeditionary) deployed once again to Logistics Support Area Anaconda in August, 2006.

The 13th ESC redeployed to Fort Hood in August, 2007, and quickly started training and preparations for their deployment in support of OIF 09–11.\nOIF 09-11\nCampaign: Iraqi Sovereignty – 1 January 2009 to 31 August 2010\nThe command headquarters again deployed to the former LSA Anaconda, now under Air Force control under the redesignation of Joint Base Balad on 17 July 2009, and assumed the mission for theater logistics on 7 August. The 13th ESC was faced with the largest movement of American forces and military equipment in more than 40 years to facilitate a responsible withdrawal from the Iraq theater of operation. Over the course of a year-long deployment, the 13th ESC brought more than $1&nbsp;billion worth of equipment back into the U.S. Army supply system.\nDuring an average day for the 13th ESC in OIF 09–11, they issued 96,000 cases of bottled water,  of fuel, and delivered 137 tons of mail.\nSome of the major accomplishments of the 13th ESC during OIF 09-11 included: signing a $31&nbsp;million contract with a local Iraqi company to conduct container repair, opening the first Iraqi bank on Joint Base Balad, partnering with the Iraqi transportation network to get American trucks off the road, and Operation Clean Sweep, a comprehensive effort to reduce excess throughout the entire area of operation.\nSix soldiers in the command were killed in OIF 09-11: PFC Taylor Marks, SGT Earl Werner, SPC Paul Andersen, SPC Joseph Gallegos, SGT William Spencer and MAJ Ronald Culver.\n*15th Sustainment Brigade - TX\n*36th Sustainment Brigade - Texas Army National Guard\n*256th Infantry Brigade Combat Team - Louisiana Army National Guard\n*278th Armored Cavalry Regiment - TN\n*155 Heavy Brigade Combat Team - Mississippi\n*41st Infantry Brigade Combat Team - Oregon Army Nation Guard\n*321st Sustainment Brigade - Louisiana\n*287th Sustainment Brigade - Kansas\n*304th Sustainment Brigade - California\n*96th Sustainment Brigade - Utah\n*90th Sustainment Brigade - Arkansas\n*3rd Sustainment Brigade - Georgia\n*10th Sustainment Brigade - New York\n*16th Sustainment Brigade - Germany\n*224th Sustainment Brigade - California\nHurricane Katrina\nDeep in the process of deploying and redeploying 13th COSCOM units, key elements of 13th COSCOM supported Joint Task Force Katrina/Rita hurricane relief efforts in the summer of 2005. 13th COSCOM provided 100&nbsp;million rations, collected human remains with dignity, executed emergency engineering operations, transported, distributed and stored over one billion dollars in humanitarian relief from both non-governmental and federal sources from across the nation.\nNumbering nearly 1,000 soldiers at the height of operations, the command and staff of the 13th COSCOM formed Logistics Task Force Lonestar, composed of several different units from the support command. Soldiers representing transportation companies, medical and engineer units, maintenance groups and others worked to bring stability back to the storm-ravaged city of New Orleans and, after Hurricane Rita came ashore, close to Lake Charles, La.\nWith a humanitarian support mission for the people of New Orleans, the task force performed logistical missions from purifying water to providing engineer support to help clean up the streets in support of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Joint Task Force Katrina.
