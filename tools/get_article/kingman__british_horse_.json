He is now a successful sire.\nThe horse is owned by Khalid Abdullah and was trained by John Gosden.\nRacing career\n2013: two-year-old season\nKingman's career began with a six-length win in a maiden race at Newmarket under jockey Ryan Moore. Moore was impressed by the colt but called the ante-post price for the 2000 Guineas of 10/1 an overreaction. His next race was the Group 3 Solario Stakes at Sandown Park Racecourse this time with Khalid Abdullah's new retained jockey James Doyle on board. Kingman won by two lengths from Godolphin's colt Emirates Flyer. Following the win his price for the 2,000 Guineas was again cut. Gosden shared plans for a run in the Dewhurst Stakes but these were scrapped following a bone chip.\n2014: three-year-old season\nFollowing recovery from an operation to remove the bone chip, Kingman made his three-year-old debut in the Greenham Stakes at Newbury Racecourse. He accelerated in the final two furlongs to win by four and a half lengths. Following the victory the Guineas price was once again cut with some bookmakers making Kingman joint favourite to the Aidan O'Brien trained Australia  Kingman started favourite for the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket but was beaten into second place by Night of Thunder, with Australia in third place. On 24 May, Kingman recorded his first Group One success when he won the Irish 2000 Guineas at the Curragh Racecourse.\nOn 18 June at Royal Ascot, Kingman reversed the Newmarket result, beating Night of Thunder by two and a quarter lengths in the St James's Palace Stakes. For his next race, the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood, he was matched against the Richard Hannon-four-year-old Toronado in what was billed as a second Duel on the Downs. He won by a length from Toronado, with Darwin in third. The colt was then sent to France for the Prix Jacques le Marois over 1600 metres at Deauville Racecourse on 17 August. He started the 2/7 favourite against four opponents, headed by the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes winner Olympic Glory. Doyle restrained him at the back of the field before taking the lead 200 metres from the finish and drew clear to win by two and a half lengths from Anodin, who beat Olympic Glory and Rizeena in a close race for second.\nKingman's retirement from racing was announced on 22 September. He had contracted a throat infection which prevented him from being trained for projected runs in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes and the Breeders' Cup Mile.\nStud career\nKingman has stood at Banstead Manor Stud alongside Frankel since the 2015 breeding season. His first yearlings sold for up to 1.7 million guineas in 2017. In 2018, he sired Group 2 Coventry Stakes winner Calyx at Royal Ascot, Group 3 winner Persian King and three further stakes winners from his first crop of two-year-olds. He was the fourth leading sire in Europe by yearling average behind Galileo, Dubawi and Frankel.\nNotable progeny\nc = colt, f = filly, g = gelding\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\"\n|- style=\"background:#eee;\"\n| style=\"width:35px;\"| Foaled\n| style=\"width:140px;\"| Name\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| Dam\n| style=\"width:35px;\"| Sex\n| style=\"width:510px;\"| Major Wins\n|-\n| 2016\n| Persian King\n| Pretty Please\n| c\n| Poule d'Essai des Poulains, Prix d'Ispahan, Prix du Moulin de Longchamp\n|-\n| 2017\n| Kinross\n| Ceilidh House\n| c\n| Prix de la Forêt, British Champions Sprint Stakes\n|-\n| 2017\n| Palace Pier\n| Beach Frolic\n| c\n| St James's Palace Stakes, Prix Jacques Le Marois (twice), Lockinge Stakes, Queen Anne Stakes\n|-\n| 2017\n| Domestic Spending\n| Urban Castle\n| g\n| Hollywood Derby, Turf Classic Stakes, Manhattan Stakes\n|-\n| 2018\n| Schnell Meister\n| Serienholde\n| c\n| NHK Mile Cup\n|-\n| 2020\n| Commissioning\n| Sovereign Parade\n| f\n| Fillies' Mile\n|-\n| 2020\n| Feed The Flame\n| Knyazhna\n| c\n| Grand Prix de Paris\n|-\n| 2020\n| King Colorado\n| More Aspen\n| c\n| The J.
