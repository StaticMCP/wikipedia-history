In the , Mount Hutton had a population of 32 people.\nGeography\nThe locality lies east of the Great Dividing Range with the eponymous mountain, Mount Hutton, in the north-east of the locality () rising to  above sea level.\nThe land use is grazing on native vegetation.\nHistory\nIn May 1916, the Queensland Government purchased the leasehold of the Mount Hutton pastoral property for £73,500, which included 10,243 cattle and 260 horses. The government's intention was to subdivide the property for closer settlement.\nFollowing World War I in 1919, the subdivision of blocks occurred with about half being available to soldier settlers and others being open to any purchasers. The open blocks attracted little interest but returned soldiers took up the soldier settlement blocks. Like many other soldier settlements in Queensland, the scheme was mostly a failure. The land was not suitable for the government's proposed use for dairying and crop growing due to receiving lower levels of rainfall than claimed, the soldiers had insufficient capital to develop their land, the blocks of land were too small to provide the income needed by a family, there was insufficient timber available for building houses, and so on.\nMount Hutton East Provisional School opened on 13 February 1922 and closed circa 1924.\nDemographics\nIn the , Mount Hutton had a population of 34 people.\nIn the , Mount Hutton had a population of 32 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Mount Hutton. The nearest government school is Injune State School in neighbouring Injune to the east which provides primary and secondary schooling to Year 10. There are no schools providing schooling to Year 12 nearby; the alternatives are distance education and boarding school.\nReferences"
