It was erected in 1912 by the Tom Johnson Chapter No. 886 of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC).\nThe entire  monument is made of granite; mostly gray granite, but with some white granite. The southward-facing statue has been said to be \"defiant\", with its back to the North, its defiant gaze, and its proud mustache.\nThe monument was constructed by John Davis and Sons Marble and Granite Works of Princeton, Kentucky, at a cost of approximately  raised privately by the Tom Johnson UDC chapter and surviving local Confederate veterans.\nThe statue's inscription reads \"C.S.A. / IN MEMORY OF / CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS / AND THE CAUSE FOR / WHICH THEY FOUGHT / 1861-1865 / ERECTED BY / TOM JOHNSON CHAPTER / U.D.C.\" \"OUR HEROES DEEDS AND / HARD WON FAME WILL LIVE.\" \"1912\" A Confederate battle flag is engraved on the left side of the statue's base.\nIt was dedicated to a large crowd including surviving local Confederate veterans of Jim Pearce Camp No. 527, United Confederate Veterans, on November 12, 1912. Many businesses in Princeton closed for the ceremony.\nOn July 17, 1997, the Confederate Soldier Monument of Princeton was one of sixty-one different monuments related to the Civil War in Kentucky placed on the National Register of Historic Places, as part of the Civil War Monuments of Kentucky Multiple Property Submission.\nThe monument is still located outside the courthouse.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
