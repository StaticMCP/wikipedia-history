In 1643 he was chosen university mathematical lecturer, but he was deprived of his fellowship next year for opposing the Solemn League and Covenant (with Isaac Barrow, John Barwick and Peter Gunning).\nAcademic\nIn the 1640s, he took instruction in mathematics from William Oughtred, and stayed with relations of Samuel Ward.\nIn 1649, he became Savilian professor of astronomy at Oxford University, and gained a high reputation by his theory of planetary motion,  propounded in the works entitled In Ismaelis Bullialdi astronomiae philolaicae fundamenta inquisitio brevis (Oxford, 1653), against the cosmology of Ismael Boulliau, and Astronomia geometrica (London, 1656) on the system of Kepler.\nAbout this time he was engaged in a decades-long philosophical controversy with Thomas Hobbes: Seth Ward and John Wallis, both Savilian professors and members of the Anglican clergy, felt offended by the works of Hobbes, particularly after Leviathan was released.\nA small part of the debate with John Webster launched by the Vindiciae academiarum he wrote with John Wilkins which also incorporated an attack on William Dell.\nIn 1659, Ward was appointed President of Trinity College, Oxford, but not having the statutory qualifications he resigned in 1660.  Also in 1660, Ward became one of the founding fellows of the Royal Society of London.  After Isaac Newton demonstrated his reflecting telescope before the Society, Ward nominated Newton as a new fellow, a position to which Newton was duly elected in 1672.\nChurchman\nKing Charles II appointed him to the livings of St Lawrence Jewry in London, and Uplowman in Devonshire, in 1661.\nHe also became dean of Exeter Cathedral (1661) and rector of St Breock, Cornwall in 1662.\nIn the latter year he was consecrated Bishop of Exeter, and in 1667 he was translated to the see of Salisbury. The office of Chancellor of the Order of the Garter was conferred on him in 1671.\nIn his diocese he showed great severity to nonconformists, and rigidly enforced the act prohibiting conventicles (unofficial religious meetings). He spent a great deal of money on the restoration of the cathedrals of Worcester and Salisbury.\nHe died at Knightsbridge on 6 January 1689.\nIn 2017 Bishop Wordsworth's Grammar School named its new, fifth house (Ward House) after Bishop Ward.\nReferences\nAttribution\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*"
