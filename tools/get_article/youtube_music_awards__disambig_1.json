The live award show was preceded by a series of events all-day in locations around the world; including Seoul, Moscow, Rio de Janeiro, and London, respectively. Performers included Arcade Fire, Lindsey Stirling, Tyler, The Creator, M.I.A., Lady Gaga and Eminem, among others. The award show started at 6pm EST and was scheduled for 90 minutes.\nFans voted in each category by sharing specific links from the Youtube.com/YTMA on either their Facebook, Google+ or Twitter accounts or by video views for nominees. The video with the most views, shares, comments, and/or likes in each category was determined the winner. Artist of the Year was won by Eminem and Video of the Year was won by Girls' Generation for their video \"I Got a Boy\".\nThe 2013 edition was directed by Spike Jonze. The show was mostly unscripted because Jonze wanted the show to \"..feel like a YouTube video — the raw messiness of making stuff...\"\nThe winners of the 2015 edition of the award show were announced on March 2, 2015. Fifty winners were chosen based on the \"growth in views, subscribers, and engagement over the last six months.\"\nWith that YouTube personally gives out plaque/button for milestones reached on subscriber counts. These can be reached through the videos.\n*Silver Play Button - 100,000 subscriber count\n*Gold Diamond Play Button - 1,000,000 subscriber count\n*Diamond Play Button - 10,000,000 subscriber count\n*Red Diamond Play Button - 100,000,000 subscriber count\nList of ceremonies\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
