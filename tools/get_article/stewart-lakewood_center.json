It was built in 1962 by the same company and in the same style as Ansley Mall near Midtown Atlanta. It was considered a major regional retail center.\nTenants at one time or another included J.C. Penney, Lerner's, Woolworth, Woolco, Warehouse Grocery, Otasco, Colonial Stores grocery (later a Big Star Market), Western Auto, Rhodes Furniture, W.T. Grant, Lee's Men's Shop, Dipper Dan's Ice Cream, Bell Brothers Shoes, the Stewart-Lakewood Fabric Center and a National Shirt Shop.\nLubie Geter, one of the children murdered in the Atlanta murders of 1979–1981, was last seen at the Stewart-Lakewood Center.\nToday part of the original 40+ unit mall has been demolished. A handful of the remaining units are occupied by a dollar store, wig store, and others. In 2005 Atlanta newspaper Creative Loafing named it one of \"five undiscovered redevelopment gems\".\nThe center was the filming location, representing for the Reseda, California strip mall in home to the Cobra Kai dojo in the hit 2018 Netflix series Cobra Kai, the spin-off of the original 1984 film, The Karate Kid.\nExternal links\n*[https://skycity2.blogspot.com/2007/02/stewart-lakewood-mall_26.html Stewart-Lakewood page on Sky City] (blog)\n*[https://mall-hall-of-fame.blogspot.com/search/label/Atlanta%27s%20Stewart-Lakewood%20Center Stewart-Lakewood page on Mall Hall of Fame'']\nReferences"
