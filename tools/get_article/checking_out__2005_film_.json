It stars Peter Falk, Laura San Giacomo, David Paymer and Judge Reinhold.\nPlot\nMorris Applebaum, an eccentric, celebrated stage actor of Jewish origin summons by letters his three adult children to his Manhattan apartment for the celebration of his 90th birthday and a special event they'll never forget; when the party's over, Morris plans to take his \"final exit\". He is healthy and not unduly depressed although he's missing his wife, but he just wants to go out the way he's lived, on his own terms and as a performance. Now it's up to his hilarious offspring – Flo, Ted, Barry and his daughter-in-law and her teen son and daughter – to put aside their own excessive baggage from childhood and convince Morris that he touched many people and changed their lives. But Morris escapes from his apartment by hiring a taxi cab and, assisted by the NYC geriatric psychiatrists Dr. Sheldon Henning, the adventure begins.\nСast\n* Peter Falk as Morris Applebaum\n* Laura San Giacomo as Flo Applebaum\n* David Paymer as Ted Applebaum\n* Judge Reinhold as Barry Applebaum\n* Jeffrey D.
