The campaign, led by princes Aslanbek Kaytukin, Tatarkhan Bekov, and Baituk Bek, resulted in a Kabardian–Cossack victory and widespread raids on Chechen settlements.\nBackground\nThe Kabardino-Russian friendship goes way back to the 16th century, when the Kabardian prince Temryuk Idarovich established an alliance with the Russian Tsar Ivan the Terrible.\nTemryuk explored the possible allies, and settled his choice on the Tsarist Russia. In 1557, temryuk settled on to Moscow to seek alliance with the Russians. The delegation included his sons Sultan Qul and Bulat Gery, who were welcomed by Ivan the Terrible. Ivan agreed to join the alliance with Kabardia.\nIn 1560, Anastasia Romanovna, Ivan's first wife, died. It was proposed that Ivan would marry Catherine Jagiellon in order to strengthen diplomatic relations with Poland. However Ivan instead decided to marry Temryuk's daughter, Gushaney. high-level delegation was sent to betroth Gwashanay. She was accompanied by her brother, Sultan Qul, on her way to Moscow. Gwashanay was later baptized and became known as Maria Temryukovna. Her brother married the daughter of a member of the tsar's entourage who handled the state treasury. He was later baptized and became known as Mikhael.\nThis campaign of Aslanbek Kaitukin wasn't the first conflict between Kabardians and Nakh peoples, in 1596, the Kabardian princes Solokh Tapsorukov of Talostania and Aitek-Murza invaded the Daryal Gorge and expelled the Vainakhs from the region, taking control over the lands of Sultan-Murza, a Vainkah noble in the Central Caucasus who controlled the Darial Gorge.\nHistory\nCampaign\nIn 1720, when several Kabardian princes appealed to Peter I of Russia for support against their regional opponents. In their letter the Kabardian nobles reported that, together with detachments of the Don Cossacks, they had carried out a punitive campaign against nearby Chechen settlements. According to the document, Kabardian and Cossack forces attacked several Chechen communities, inflicted notable casualties, seized property, and took a number of women and children captive.\nShortly after this campaign, Kabarda itself came under pressure from the Crimean Khanate. The Kabardian princes reported that forces of the Crimean khan, supported by Kuban Tatars and several Circassian groups that had broken away from Kabarda, conducted an incursion that devastated local supplies. This situation prompted the Kabardian leadership to request military assistance from Russia and to propose the construction of a Russian fortress in their territory.\nThe campaign inflicted heavy losses on the targeted clans and demonstrated Kabardia’s loyalty to Russia, but the forces soon withdrew to their homeland without establishing permanent control over the area because of low supplies In August 1720, Aslanbek Kaytukin and other Kabardian princes wrote to Peter I about their raids against the Chechens and asked him to build a town in their land:\nReferences"
