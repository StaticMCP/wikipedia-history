They therefore resigned their seats to contest them at a by-election, and were returned unopposed on 20 April 1899 (Melbourne Argus, 14 April 1899, p. 6).\n: On 6 July 1899, one of the Ministerial members for South Brisbane, Abraham Luya, died. Labour candidate and former member Henry Turley won the resulting by-election on 22 July 1899.\n: At the 1899 election, William Hood had been returned by a one-vote majority in Warrego. His sole opponent, Labour candidate David Bowman, filed a petition against his return and on 21 November 1899, the election was declared void. Bowman won the resulting by-election on 16 December 1899 with a majority of 44 votes.\n: On 7 December 1899, James Drake, the Opposition member for Enoggera, was appointed to the Queensland Legislative Council. Labour candidate Matthew Reid won the resulting by-election on 23 December 1899.\n: Thomas Glassey, elected as the Labour member for Bundaberg, resigned from the party and his seat in 1900.

Ministerial candidate Walter Paget won the resulting by-election on 25 May 1901.\n; Federal election\nThe first federal election was held on 30 March 1901. Unlike later elections, nobody resigned from their seats to contest it, but those who got elected to the federal parliament subsequently resigned their Assembly seats. This triggered a series of by-elections:\n: Andrew Fisher, Labour member for Gympie, became the member for the Federal division of Wide Bay, and resigned his Assembly seat on 9 May 1901. Labour candidate Daniel Mulcahy won the resulting by-election on 8 June 1901.\n: William Henry Groom, Opposition member for Drayton and Toowoomba, became the member for the Federal division of Darling Downs and resigned his Assembly seat on 4 June 1901.

Labour candidate George Barber won the resulting by-election on 6 July 1901.\n: Anderson Dawson, the Labour member for Charters Towers, became a Senator for Queensland and resigned his Assembly seat on 11 June 1901.
