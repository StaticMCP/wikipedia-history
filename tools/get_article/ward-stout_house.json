It is a -story wood-frame structure, with a gabled roof, stucco exterior, and a concrete foundation.  The main roof has a large \"doghouse\" dormer with three sash windows, and projects slightly over the shed roof of the front porch, which is supported by four stuccoed piers.  Both roofs have exposed rafter ends.  Built about 1932, it is a good example of late Craftsman architecture in the community.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in White County, Arkansas\nReferences"
