Helm became a strong believer, and described his participation in Prevent, the government's deradicalisation programme, as 'insight'. He is now rumoured to have begun recruiting for his own nexion in the North West.\" – Hope not Hate, [https://www.hopenothate.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/state-of-hate-2020-final.pdf \"State of Hate 2020\"]\n*\"More worryingly, is the influence O9A appears to have on the Sonnenkrieg Division. Leading the group is Andrew Dymock, who is obsessed with the occult and believed to be close to Ryan Fleming and Garron Helm. Under his leadership, the Sonnenkrieg Division has produced some of the most frightening and sickening material seen on the British far right for decades, including open interest in Satanism and the promotion of paedophilia, rape and murder\". – [https://www.hopenothate.org.uk/2019/02/16/state-of-hate-2019-order-of-nine-angles/ \"Order of Nine Angles\"] , Hope not Hate\n*\n*\n*\"[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-arrests-16-neo-nazi-24007848 Russia arrests 16 'neo-Nazi murder cult members' accused of plotting terror attacks\"].

Additionally, the leader of the eco-extremist group Individualists Tending to the Wild has claimed to have been influenced by the ONA.\nAllegations have been made by antifascist organisations, several British politicians and the media that the ONA condones and encourages sexual abuse, and this has been given as one of the reasons why the ONA should be proscribed by the British government. Many ONA members openly advocate rape as an effective way to undermine society by transgressing against its norms. White Star Acception commits rapes by their own admission, and ONA texts such as \"The Dreccian Way\", \"Iron Gates\", \"Bluebird\" and \"The Rape Anthology\" recommend and praise rape and pedophilia, even suggesting rape is necessary for \"ascension of the Ubermensch\". To advance in rank, ONA member must perform assaults, with lynchings and sexual assaults being the most recommended. Material promoting pedophilia has also appeared in ONA's in-house magazines Fenrir and Drums of Tophet, the latter of which also contained \"borderline [child porn]\". According to BBC News, \"the authorities are concerned by the number of paedophiles associated with the ONA\".\nConsequently, ONA has been linked to hundreds of cases of terrorism and child sexual abuse.\nTimeline of crimes involving the Order of Nine Angles\n1997\nIn the summer of 1997 two members of the Swedish ONA group called Misanthropic Luciferian Order perpetrated the so-called Keillers Park murder, an alleged ritual sacrifice of an Algerian man.

Corwyn Storm Carver was found to be another member in communication with the group and in possession of ONA paraphernalia and literature while stationed in Kuwait. Shandon Simpson, member of the Ohio Army National Guard sent to quell the George Floyd protests in Washington, D.C. openly espoused neo-Nazi views and was also found to be in the RapeWaffen. Simpson told that he was planning to shoot the protesters as part of \"racial holy war\" and was intercepted by the FBI but only after he had already been deployed.\nIn January 2020, ONA followers Luke Austin Lane, Jacob Kaderli and Michael Helterbrand were arrested for and later convicted of stockpiling weapons and plotting to kill an antifascist couple and their young children. In preparation Lane along with dozen other people had engaged in paramilitary training and sacrificed a ram, drank its blood and consumed psychedelic drugs in an occult ritual on his property.\nThe British political advocacy group Hope not Hate reported in March 2020 that there were six cases of neo-Nazis connected to ONA being prosecuted for terrorist offenses during the year alone.\nIn March 2020, Hope not Hate began a campaign to have the Order of Nine Angles banned, proscribed, as a terrorist group, a campaign supported by several British members of Parliament including the Labour Party's Yvette Cooper, Chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee.\nOn 18 September 2020, Toronto Police arrested 34-year-old Guilherme \"William\" Von Neutegem and charged him with the murder of Mohamed-Aslim Zafis.

Home office however dropped the charges after concluding \"she had been a victim of trafficking who had been groomed and sexually exploited.\" Rudd was allegedly radicalized by Atomwaffen and ONA. She died by suicide on 19 May 2022.\nDanyal Hussein who killed two sisters, Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman, in a Wembley park in London was \"closely associated\" with the Order of Nine Angles and took part in an ONA internet forum.

In Russia four members of the Order of Nine Angles were arrested after two confessed to ritual murders involving cannibalism in Karelia and Saint Petersburg. Two of them were also accused of large-scale drug trafficking as a large amount of narcotics was found in their home.\nOn 11 December 2020, the UK based video hosting service BitChute removed all ONA material for violating the site's anti-terror policy, citing ONA's \"close connections with other proscribed organisations\". The same month Yahoo! News acquired a report by the US National Counterterrorism Center, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security circulated to U.S. intelligence agencies, assessing that the ONA poses a violent threat and that it plays an influential role among right-wing terror groups. The report however added that the ONA was rejected by certain groups for inciting its members to commit rape and pedophilia.\nONA member Andrew Dymock, who was convicted of 15 terror offences, has also been questioned by the police regarding the sexual assault of a teenage girl who had Nazi and occult symbols carved on her body.

Tchorzewski also possessed Nazi and \"satanist literature depicting rape and paedophilia\". Tchorzewski's co-defendant Michal Szewczuk \"ran a blog that encouraged the rape and torture of opponents, including small children\" and was likewise sentenced to four years in prison for terror offences. Ethan Melzer also belonged to an encrypted ONA chatroom where members encouraged one another to perpetrate sexual violence and shared videos of these rapes.\nIn March 2020, a prominent ONA member and former leader of Atomwaffen Division John Cameron Denton was accused by prosecutors of possessing and sharing child sexual abuse material of a young underage girl by his group, in addition to making 134 death and bomb threats against reporters and minority communities.

In addition to this he was described in the Old Bailey as a firearms enthusiast and living with his two young sisters at the time of the arrest.\n2021\nIn January 2021, after the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol, discussion about proscribing far-right groups was renewed by the Public Safety Minister Bill Blair, and the ONA was named by experts as one of the most dangerous groups in Canada whose proscription is a priority. In April 2021, Democratic Representative Elissa Slotkin pressed Joe Biden's administration to designate ONA as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) in a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

He had a foster family and weekly psychologist visits in Romania, even so he became mostly active on the internet which resulted in him being involved with the ONA.

Krasnov allegedly splintered from another far right group along with 15 other members after they were expelled for committing extreme violent acts. According to MKU's own texts, the group adheres to \"nihilistic national socialism\" and ONA Satanism.}} In July 2024, a leader of MKU, Michail \"Butcher\" Chkhikvishvili, native of Georgia, was arrested and is facing 50 years in prison for a plot to poison Jewish people. Under him MKU co-operated with another Eastern European Nazi group Feuerkrieg Division, based in Estonia. According to the Combating Terrorism Center MKU is responsible for at least 50 murders and 150 assaults with possibly more that have not been made public. MKU \"allegedly made specific attempts to recruit individuals with experience/expertise in demolitions and/or chemical/biological weapons\" to \"graduate\" from simple assault and murder to mass casualty event. MKU also implemented a system where aspiring members need to upload videos of assault or murder to be considered for membership. Members are graded with a system of \"murder points\", where members need to perpetrate acts of violence to be considered an active member.\nAlina Afanaskina, perpetrator of the 2023 Bryansk school shooting, was suspected of having communicated online with \"curators\" from MKU prior to the attack. The organization claimed responsibility for June 23, 2024 bombing of a mosque in Fryazino, Russia. Maniac Murder Cult was designated a terrorist group in the United Kingdom on July 2, 2025.\nReferences"
