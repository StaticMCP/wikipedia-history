It was written by Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb of the Bee Gees for her 1982 studio album of the same name, while production was helmed by Barry Gibb, Albhy Galuten and Karl Richardson under their production moniker Gibb-Galuten-Richardson. Barry Gibb's backing vocal is heard on the chorus.\nThe song hit the top ten in over a dozen countries and stands as one of Warwick's biggest career hits, selling an estimated 4 million singles worldwide. In the U.S., it reached number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in January 1983. The track was Warwick's eighth number one Adult Contemporary hit and reached number 14 on the Hot Black Singles chart. It was ranked as Billboard magazine's 80th-biggest US hit of 1983. On the UK Singles Chart, the track reached number 2 in November 1982.\nBackground\n\"Heartbreaker\" was written by Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb of the Bee Gees as the title track for singer Dionne Warwick's album of the same name. Maurice Gibb said later that he wished they had saved the song for themselves. The Bee Gees' demo version, sung by Barry Gibb, was not released until 2006 when it appeared on The Heartbreaker Demos (2006), the group's album of demo tracks that formed the basis for Warwick's album.\nWarwick admitted in The Billboard Book of Number One Adult Contemporary Hits by Wesley Hyatt that she was not fond of \"Heartbreaker\" (regarding the song's international popularity, she quipped, \"I cried all the way to the bank\"), but recorded it because she trusted the Bee Gees' judgment that it would be a hit. Maurice Gibb, who co-wrote the song, commented, \"I cried my eyes out after we wrote it. I drove home and thought, 'We should be doing this one', and when she did it, it was brilliant. Barry sang on it, and it became a duet between Barry and Dionne Warwick\".\nTrack listings\nAll tracks produced by Gibb-Galuten-Richardson.\n| length1         = 4:16\n| title2          = I Can't See Anything (But You)\n| writer2         =\n| length2         = 3:24\n}}\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Chart (1982–1983)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia (Kent Music Report)\n|2\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Denmark (Hitlisten)\n|2\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Finland (Suomen virallinen lista)\n|3\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|France (IFOP)\n|17\n|-\n|-\n! scope=row | Italy (Musica e dischi)\n| 24\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Portugal (AFP)\n|1\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|South Africa (Springbok)\n|4\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Spain (AFYVE)\n|3\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Cash Box Top 100\n|15\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Zimbabwe (ZIMA)\n|3\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Chart (1982)\n!Rank\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Belgium (Ultratop 50 Flanders)\n|40\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Denmark (Hitlisten)\n|27\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Netherlands (Dutch Top 40)\n|66\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Netherlands (Single Top 100)\n|65\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (BMRB)\n|18\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Cash Box Top 100\n|94\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Chart (1983)\n!Rank\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia (Kent Music Report)\n|18\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Billboard Hot 100\n|80\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|West Germany (Official German Charts)\n|35\n|-\n|}\nBee Gees version\nThe Bee Gees' own version, with Barry Gibb on lead vocals, was recorded in 1994.
