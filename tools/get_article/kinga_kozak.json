She came to notice playing for her primary school team UKS Biskupianka Stara Krobia, and was scouted by Medyk Konin. In 2017–18, she was the national top scorer for Medyk at under-16 level, but transferred to GKS Katowice that summer because she wanted to play at first team level in the Ekstraliga.\nShe was successful in three years at GKS Katowice, scoring 29 goals in 71 games across all competitions. In June 2021, she signed a one-year contract with the national champions Czarni Sosnowiec. With Czarni Sosnowiec, she won the Polish Cup and played in the 2021–22 UEFA Women's Champions League first round defeat by Ferencváros.\nIn June 2022, Kozak signed for Scottish Premier League club Glasgow City,.\nAfter two years abroad, on 22 August 2024 she returned to GKS Katowice on a one-year contract with an option for another year. In her first season back in Poland, she scored 10 goals in 18 Ekstraliga appearances, contributing to GKS' second title win.\nOn 9 July 2025, Kozak moved to Italian side Napoli.\nInternational career\nKozak made her senior international debut for Poland aged 18 years and eight days old in a 3–0 UEFA Women's Euro 2022 qualifying Group D win over Azerbaijan, played behind closed doors in Warsaw on 23 October 2020. She scored her first goal in Poland's 7–0 win over Kosovo in the final game of the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification – UEFA Group F series on 6 September 2022.\nPersonal life\nKozak's older brother Miłosz is also a professional footballer.
