Roosevelt signs a declaration of war against Nazi Germany on 11 December 1941.]]\nA declaration of war is a formal act by which one state announces existing or impending war activity against another. The declaration is a performative speech act (or the public signing of a document) by an authorized party of a national government, in order to create a state of war between two or more states.\nThe legality of who is competent to declare war varies between nations and forms of government. In many nations, that power is given to the head of state or sovereign. In other cases, something short of a full declaration of war, such as a letter of marque or a covert operation, may authorise war-like acts by privateers or mercenaries. The official international protocol for declaring war was defined in the Hague Convention (III) of 1907 on the Opening of Hostilities.\nSince 1945, developments in international law such as the United Nations Charter, which prohibits both the threat and the use of force in international conflicts, have made declarations of war largely obsolete in international relations, though such declarations may have relevance within the domestic law of the belligerents or of neutral nations. The UN Security Council, under powers granted in articles 24 and 25, and Chapter VII of the Charter, may authorize collective action to maintain or enforce international peace and security. Article 51 of the United Nations Charter also states that: \"Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right to individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a state.\"\nDeclarations of war have been exceedingly rare since the end of World War II. Scholars have debated the causes of the decline, with some arguing that states are trying to evade the restrictions of international humanitarian law (which governs conduct in war) while others argue that war declarations have come to be perceived as markers of aggression and maximalist aims.\nHistory\nannouncing the German declaration of war against the United States  on 11 December 1941.]]\nThe practice of declaring war has a long history. The ancient Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh gives an account of it, as does the Old Testament. The Roman Republic formalized the declaration of war by a special ceremony, the ritual of the Fetials, though the practice started to decline into the Imperial era.\nHowever, the practice of declaring war was not always strictly followed. In his study Hostilities without Declaration of War (1883), the British scholar John Frederick Maurice showed that between 1700 and 1870 war was declared in only 10 cases, e.g. the 1812 French declaration of war on Russia or the Declarations of war by Great Britain and the United Kingdom, while in another 107 cases war was waged without such declaration (these figures include only wars waged in Europe and between European states and the United States, not including colonial wars in Africa and Asia).\nIn modern public international law, a declaration of war entails the recognition between countries of a state of hostilities between these countries, and such declaration has acted to regulate the conduct between the military engagements between the forces of the respective countries. The primary multilateral treaties governing such declarations are the Hague Conventions.\nThe League of Nations, formed in 1919 in the wake of the First World War, and the General Treaty for the Renunciation of War of 1928 signed in Paris, France, demonstrated that world powers were seriously seeking a means to prevent the carnage of another world war. Nevertheless, these powers were unable to stop the outbreak of the Second World War, so the United Nations was established following that war in a renewed attempt to prevent international aggression through declarations of war.\nDenigration of formal declarations of war before WWI\nIn classical times, Thucydides condemned the Thebans, allies of Sparta, for launching a surprise attack without a declaration of war against Plataea, Athens' ally – an event that began the Peloponnesian War.\nThe utility of formal declarations of war has always been questioned, either as sentimental remnants of a long-gone age of chivalry or as imprudent warnings to the enemy. For example, writing in 1737, Cornelius van Bynkershoek judged that \"nations and princes endowed with some pride are not generally willing to wage war without a previous declaration, for they wish by an open attack to render victory more honourable and glorious.\" Writing in 1880, William Edward Hall judged that \"any sort of previous declaration therefore is an empty formality unless the enemy must be given time and opportunity to put himself in a state of defence, and it is needless to say that no one asserts such a quixotism to be obligatory.\"\nFormal declarations of war during World War I\nFormal declarations of war during World War II\nDeclared wars since 1945\nDeclarations of war, while uncommon in the traditional sense, have mainly been limited to the conflict areas of the Western Asia and East Africa since 1945. Additionally, some small states have unilaterally declared war on major world powers such as the United States or Russia when faced with a hostile invasion and/or occupation. The following is a list of declarations of war (or the existence of war) by one sovereign state against another since the end of World War II in 1945. Only declarations that occurred in the context of a direct military conflict are included.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | War(s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Date\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Titled\n! colspan=\"2\" | Belligerents\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Ended\n! rowspan=\"2\" | References\n|-\n!

At the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Putin gave a televised broadcast announcing the start of the invasion with the term \"special military operation\", side-stepping a formal declaration of war. The statement was, however, regarded as a declaration of war by the Ukrainian government and reported as such by many international news sources. While the Ukrainian parliament refers to Russia as a \"terrorist state\" in regards to its military actions in Ukraine, it has not issued a formal declaration of war on its behalf.\nProcedures\nIn Title II, Article 2 of the first Hague Convention of 1899, the signatory states agreed that at least one other nation be used to mediate disputes between states before engaging in hostilities:\nThe Hague Convention (III) of 1907 called \"Convention Relative to the Opening of Hostilities\" gives the international actions a country should perform when opening hostilities. The first two Articles say:\nArticle 2\nThe existence of a state of war must be notified to the neutral Powers without delay, and shall not take effect in regard to them until after the receipt of a notification, which may, however, be given by telegraph. Neutral Powers, nevertheless, cannot rely on the absence of notification if it is clearly established that they were in fact aware of the existence of a state of war.}}\nThe United Nations and war\nIn an effort to force nations to resolve issues without warfare, framers of the United Nations Charter attempted to commit member nations to using warfare only under limited circumstances, particularly for defensive purposes.\nThe UN became a combatant itself after North Korea invaded South Korea on 25 June 1950, which began the Korean War. The UN Security Council condemned the North Korean action by a 9–0 resolution (with the Soviet Union absent) and called upon its member nations to come to the aid of South Korea. The United States and 15 other nations formed a \"UN force\" to pursue this action. In a press conference on 29 June 1950, US President Harry S. Truman characterized these hostilities as not being a \"war\" but a \"police action\".\nThe United Nations has issued Security Council Resolutions that declared some wars to be legal actions under international law, most notably Resolution 678, authorizing the 1991 Gulf War which was triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.  UN Resolutions authorise the use of \"force\" or \"all necessary means\".\nLegality\nThe legality of who is competent to declare war varies between nations and forms of government. In many nations, that power is given to the head of state or sovereign. The official international protocol for declaring war was defined in the Hague Convention (III) of 1907 on the Opening of Hostilities.\nSince 1945, developments in international law such as the United Nations Charter, which prohibits both the threat and the use of force in international conflicts, have made declarations of war largely obsolete in international relations, though such declarations may have relevance within the domestic law of the belligerents or of neutral nations. The UN Security Council, under powers granted in articles 24 and 25, and Chapter VII of the Charter, may authorize collective action to maintain or enforce international peace and security. Article 51 of the United Nations Charter also states that: \"Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right to individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a state.\"\nRequirements by country\nDeclaring war is usually done through a process that involves prior approval before a formal announcement is made. This differs by country as some do not have a formal or codified pre-approval process, and in such a case, a given head of government can declare war with no pre-conditions.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=col | Country\n! scope=col | War declarer\n! scope=col | Legal cause\n! scope=col | Authorized by\n! scope=col | Additional information\n|-\n! scope=row | Australia\n| Governor-General\n| Section 61 and 68 of the Australian constitution\n| Governor-General\n(de jure)\nGovernment (de facto)\n| Per the Australian Constitution executive powers relating to defence are vested in the Governor General as the representative of the Monarch of Australia, including the power to formally proclaim a state of war, which has only been used during World War 2, in contemporary day to day practice the deployment of forces and military action against hostile powers is the responsibility of the Prime Minister and Ministers under the Defence Act 1903 and other related acts.\n|-\n! scope=row | Austria\n| Parliament\n| Article 38 and 40 of B-VG\n| Parliament\n| The President has to announce a declaration of war.\n|-\n! scope=row | Brazil\n| President\n| Article 84 of the Brazilian constitution\n| Congress\n| The President of Brazil has the power to declare war, in the event of foreign aggression, when authorized by the National Congress or, upon its ratification if the aggression occurs between legislative sessions, and decree full or partial national mobilization under the same conditions.\n|-\n! scope=row | Canada\n| Monarch\n| None\n| Monarch (de jure)\n| See: Declaration of war by Canada.\n|-\n! scope=row | China\n| President\n| Article 62(15), 67(19) and 80\n| Congress (de jure)\n| The National People's Congress is vested with the power to decide \"on issues concerning war and peace\" while the President \"in pursuance of the decisions of the National People's Congress...proclaims a state of war.\" The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress may \"decide, when the National People's Congress is not in session, on the proclamation of a state of war in the event of an armed attack on the country or in fulfillment of international treaty obligations concerning common defense against aggression\".\n|-\n! scope=row | Finland\n| President\n| Article 93 of the Finnish constitution\n| Parliament\n| The President of Finland may declare war or peace, with permission from the Parliament of Finland\n|-\n! scope=row | France\n| Government\n| Article 35 of the French constitution\n| Parliament\n| The Parliament \"authorize\" the declaration of war.\n|-\n! scope=row | Germany\n| Parliament\n| Article 115a GG\n| Parliament\n| A necessary requirement is a determination by a two-thirds majority in the lower house and a majority of the upper house that the territory of Germany is under armed attack or that such an attack is imminent.
