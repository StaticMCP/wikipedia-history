It was fought between several militias and was ended by a ceasefire.\nPrelude\nClashes between militias broke out in Tripoli from 26 to 27 August 2018, touching off renewed fighting in the city after 18 months of relative calm. The clashes pitted the 7th Brigade, originating from the town of Tarhuna, against three militias from Tripoli: Ghneiwa, the Tripoli Brigade and the Nawasi Brigade. All four militias were, however, officially affiliated to the Government of National Accord led by Fayez al-Sarraj.\nSince 2016, Tripoli had been controlled by four militias: the Tripoli Brigade, the RADA Special Deterrence Forces, the Nawasi Brigade and Ghneiwa. RADA was Madkhalist and Salafist, while the other three groups did not profess any particular ideology. According to analysts Wolfram Lacher and Alaa al-Idrissi, these four militias formed a \"cartel\" monopolizing state resources while being protected by their support for the GNA. In June 2018, Lacher and al-Idrissi further stated that \"such a situation is untenable\" and \"risks provoking a new major conflict started by political-military forces who feel excluded from this cartel in access to the levers of the administration.\" The August 2018 announcement of the reopening of Tripoli International Airport from having been damaged by warfare in 2014 aroused hostility from the 7th Brigade, which was excluded from the cartel and claimed that residents of Tarhuna had a right to a share of the revenues generated by the airport.\nJalel Harchaoui, a Libya expert at Paris 8 University Vincennes-Saint-Denis, reported that \"the four or five largest Tripoli militias have provided relative security on a daily basis, which is appreciated by the population but also foreign states interested in maintaining a diplomatic and commercial presence to take advantage of reconstruction opportunities.\" However, \"this situation was untenable\" because the cities of Zintan and Misrata \"felt excluded from this new balance of power.\" Militias from these cities had dominated Tripoli after the First Libyan Civil War until those from Zintan were expelled from the city in 2014, while those from Misrata withdrew in 2016 with the formation of the GNA.\nThe GNA and Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj, meanwhile, claimed that they had issued orders of dissolution to the 7th Brigade in April 2018, but RFI reported that the force continued to draw salaries before the Battle of Tripoli. The brigade soon declared that it was now part of the army and was aiming to \"liberate\" the capital. Some days after fighting began, the Somoud Brigade, an Islamist force from Misrata led by Salah Badi, intervened in support of the 7th Brigade.\nBattle\nOn 27 August, the 7th Brigade engaged several brigades from Tripoli on its way there from Tarhuna. Fighting first broke out in the neighbourhoods of Salah Eddine and Qasr bin Ghashir, south of Tripoli. On 31 August, Tripoli International Airport was closed after suffering damage from rocket fire. The same day, a ceasefire was announced, but it was not respected by belligerents. On 2 September, the GNA declared a state of emergency in the capital and its surrounding areas. 400 prisoners from Ain Zara Prison, south of Tripoli, took advantage of the fighting to escape the same day.\nVarious other groups then joined the battle, further complicating the situation. The GNA, meanwhile, lacked a formal military or real control over the warring militias. al-Sarraj then called upon brigades from Zintan and an \"anti-terrorist brigade\" from Misrata that had participated in the 2016 Battle of Sirte to intervene between the belligerents. On 2 September, the Misrata Brigades arrived on the outskirts of Tripoli. They did not immediately engage in combat but urged other militias to cede control of government buildings in the city centre. Still, new militias from Misrata and Zintan as well as smaller units loyal to Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar continued to reinforce the 7th Brigade.\nOn 4 September, the United Nations Support Mission in Libya announced the signing of a new ceasefire agreement between the armed groups in Tripoli. Nevertheless, fighting continued in the hours following the signing of the accords. On 6 September, Haftar threatened to march on Tripoli. The fragile truce was eventually respected by all parties. On 9 September, several armed groups agreed to cooperate on \"consolidating\" the ceasefire.\nOn 10 September, the headquarters of the National Oil Corporation was attacked by three to five armed men. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the incident. The building was subsequently recaptured by RADA, which reported that two attackers and two NOC employees had been killed.\nOn 12 November, rockets hit Mitiga International Airport, the only functional airport in Tripoli, which was controlled by RADA. All flights were cancelled, having previously been stopped from 31 August to 6 September.\nIn mid-September, UN Special Envoy to Libya Ghassam Salamé recorded 14 ceasefire violations in one week, although he still described it as \"generally respected.\"\nHowever, on 18 September, fighting resumed in southern Tripoli, causing power outages in the southern and western Libya. The main clashes took place in Salah Eddine and on the road to Tripoli International Airport. By 20 September, the fighting had killed nine people, including two civilians, and wounded 13, included four civilians.\nOn 25 September, a new ceasefire was signed between the Tarhuna and Tripoli militias and Mitiga International Airport was reopened. The agreement also mandated the formation of a mixed regular force composed of Tripoli and Tarhuna police to secure the southern suburb of Tripoli.\nCasualties\nOn 3 September 2018, the Ministry of Health published an official report recording at least 50 deaths and 138 people wounded since 27 August. On 8 September, the casualties reached at least 78 dead and 313 wounded. This increased to 115 dead and 400 wounded on 23 September. After the new ceasefire of 25 September, the toll was recorded as least 117 deaths and 400 wounded.\nAnalysis\nAccording to analyst Carlo Degli Abbati, \"France's decision to accelerate the electoral process by fixing the [elections] date on 10 December increased tensions in the country and provoked a change in alliances for the 7th Brigade, a Tarhuna brigade that joined the side of Marshal Haftar. Having the wind in their sails due to their strong external support, they could have staged a coup d'état to take power. That's probably what just happened.\"\nAftermath\nFurther combat occurred in Tripoli from 18 to 19 January, killing 10 people and wounding 41.\nReactions\nSupranational\n*, UNSMIL has called for an end to the clashes as well a adherence to the cease-fire.\n*: The European Delegation to Libya condemned the violence, Being quoted as saying \"The EU Delegation and the EU Heads of Mission to Libya strongly condemn the latest escalation of violence in Tripoli which has caused civilian fatalities, injury and displacement of people and destruction of critical infrastructure\"\nNational\n*, in August the British ambassador to Libya Frank Baker, wrote on Twitter, \"Very concerned by the clashes in Tripoli.
