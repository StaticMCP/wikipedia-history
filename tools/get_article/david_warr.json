He is also the owner of Cooper & Co., a local coffee shop business.\nPolitical career\nWarr stood for election as deputy of St Helier South in the 2022 general election under the Better Way banner. Warr was elected with a majority of 25 votes, the smallest of any successful candidates in the election.\nWarr supported Kristina Moore in the 2022 Chief Minister of Jersey election, and was subsequently appointed Minister for Housing and Communities in the Moore ministry. He held this position until the collapse of the Moore ministry in January 2024.\nControversies\nIn February 2024, following his replacement as housing minister by Reform Jersey leader Sam Mézec, Warr told Mézec that the three Reform deputies of St Helier South would no longer be able to hold their constituency surgeries at Warr's coffee shop Cooper & Co. Warr denied that the decision had anything to do with recent political events, whilst Mézec decried it as a \"revenge eviction\".\nReferences"
