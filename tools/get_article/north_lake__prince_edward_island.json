It lies within Lot 47 and is situated near the northeastern tip of the island.\nSituated on the coast of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, North Lake is built around a traditional fishing harbour. The community relies on the Atlantic fishing industry, particularly in the seasonal fishing of lobster, herring, and mackerel. While the year-round population is small, temporary workers, tourists, and fishing vessels use its limited but functional infrastructure during the summer season.\nIn 1976, Ken Fraser caught the world's largest Atlantic bluefin tuna off the coast of North Lake.\nSee also\n*List of communities in Prince Edward Island\nReferences"
