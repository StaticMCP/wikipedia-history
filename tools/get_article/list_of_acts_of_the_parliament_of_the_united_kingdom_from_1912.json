For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\n2 & 3 Geo. 5\nThe second session of the 30th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 14 February 1912 until 7 March 1913.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 2 & 3 G. 5.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  with respect to the Limit imposed by that section as amended by subsequent enactments on the Amount to be provided annually for the purposes of the Metropolitan Police.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  as originally enacted and as applied by any other Act.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  in respect of its Imprisonment Penalty.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  the Vagrancy Act, 1898, and the Immoral Traffic (Scotland) Act, 1902. }}\n}}\nLocal acts\n|  and for other purposes.}}\n|\n|  and to extend the time for the sale of surplus lands.}}\n|  and for other purposes.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  relating to the embankment and drainage of certain low lands in the townships of Everton Scaftworth Gringley-on-the-Hill Misterton and Walkeringham in the county of Nottingham and to make further and better provision in respect thereof.}}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  of a Company to take over the investments securities property and assets of the Birkbeck Share and Debenture Trust and for other purposes.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|  relating to the Aberdeen Market Company.|po1=Aberdeen Market Company Order 1912|Provisional Order to provide for the registration of the Aberdeen Market Company as a limited Company under the Companies (Consolidation) Act 1908 and to repeal the Act relating to the Company from the date of such registration and for other purposes.}}\n|  relating to the Glasgow and South Western Railway.|po1=Glasgow and South Western Railway Order 1912|Provisional Order to empower the Glasgow and South Western Railway Company to divert a road at Ayr and to acquire lands and for other purposes.}}\n|  relating to Prestonpans Combination Water Supply (Finance).|po1=Prestonpans Combination Water Supply (Finance) Order 1912|Provisional Order to extend the period for the Repayment of Moneys borrowed by the County Council of the County of Haddington the Town Council of the Burgh of Prestonpans and the Town Council of the Burgh of Cockenzie and Port Seton for the purposes of the Prestonpans Combination Water Trust and for other purposes.}}\n|  relating to Kilmarnock Gas.|po1=Kilmarnock Gas Order 1912|Kilmarnock Gas.
