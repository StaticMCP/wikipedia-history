The battle was a heavy defeat for the Ethiopians and would spur the modernization of the Ethiopian army.\nHistory\nIn the late 1840s, Abyssinian Emperor Tewodros II embarked on a campaign to consolidate his empire by invading Gonder, which he occupied in 1847. With his victory in the south secured, Tewodros decided strengthen his position by damaging his major rival, namely the Muslim power Egypt, then a nominal province of the Ottoman Empire. Invading through Ethiopia's western frontier, the Ethiopian army advanced into the Egyptian-controlled Sudan and occupied Metemma.\nIn March 1848, Tewodros decided to attack Dabarki, a fortified post garrisoned with Egyptian and Ottoman troops. The Ethiopian attack faced heavy resistance and suffered heavy casualties from the Egyptian-Ottoman artillery. The attack failed and led to the collapse of Tewodros' campaign, forcing him and the Ethiopian army to retreat into the nearby highlands.\nThe battle at Dabarki greatly effected Tewodros' military thinking, inspiriting him to modernize the Ethiopian army with more modern artillery and firearms. Several sources have described the battle as the first significant defeat in Tewodros' military career.\nReferences"
