It was similar in overall form to Clitendoceras, from which it may have been derived. Mcqueenoceras, like Clitendoceras, has ventral siphuncle but the endocones are thicker on the ventral side and thinner on the dorsal. Also the sutures in Mcqueenoceras retreat rearward, forming lobes as they cross the venter. The type species is Mcqueenoceras jeffersonense, named by E.O. Ulrich and A.F. Foerste in 1935, and it is known from Missouri and New York. In 1956, Rousseau H. Flower named two other species, M. cariniferum and M. ventrale, both known from Maryland.\nReferences\n*Flower, R.
