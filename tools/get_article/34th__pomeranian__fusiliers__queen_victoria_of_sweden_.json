The regiment was first founded under the rule of the Swedish Empire in 1720, under the name the ''Queen's Life Regiment of Foot (). It was an enlisted infantry regiment that was set up in Stralsund in 1720, during the Great Northern War. It operated under Swedish rule until 1815, when the regiment was transferred together with the dominion of Swedish Pomerania to Prussia following a decision at the Congress of Vienna.\nin uniform as an honorary Colonel-in-Chief of the regiment.]]\nHistory\nSwedish service 1722–1815\nThe regiment served as a garrison regiment and was created from the Västgöta Regiment and parts of  the Uppland Regiment. From 1722 the regiment was called \"The Queen's Life Regiment of Foot\"''. During the 1750s, the regiment was occasionally stationed in mainland Sweden. The regiment participated in most of the wars that Sweden waged at this time; The Pomeranian War (1757-1762), the Russo-Swedish War (1788-1790), the Finnish War (1808-1809) and the Napoleonic Wars against France in the early 19th century.\nSwedish Pomerania was ceded as compensation to Denmark after the Treaty of Kiel in which Sweden acquired Norway, however Sweden and Denmark agreed with Prussia in June 1815 that the area would go to Prussia instead. The regiment's soldiers and officers were released from their oath to Sweden on October 23 of the same year and handed over by Lieutenant General Gustaf Boije to the Prussian government's representative, Colonel Wilhelm von Steinwehr. Boije took the regimental colours, as well as a handful of officers who had not sworn allegiance to Prussia, back to Sweden. The regiment then changed its name to the 34th (Pomeranian) Fusiliers Regiment ().\nGallery\nFile:Hennes Kongl. Maÿestet Drottningens Lif Regemente.
