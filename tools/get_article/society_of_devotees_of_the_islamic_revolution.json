It is informally referred to as the Isargaran, a word which connotes altruism in Persian and is associated with other political movements. Many members of the party are veterans of the Iran–Iraq War. It is one of the most powerful and least discussed movements in Iran.\nMahmoud Ahmadinejad was a founding member of the party.\nElectoral results\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Election\n!Candidate\n!Votes\n!Result\n|-\n|2005\n|Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\n|17,284,782\n|Elected\n|-\n|2009\n|Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\n|24,592,793\n|Elected\n|-\n|2013\n|Saeed Jalili\n|4,168,946\n|Lost\n|}\nParty leaders\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:100%; line-height:16px;\"\n|-\n|+ Secretaries-general\n!Name\n!Tenure\n!Ref\n|-\n||Hossein Fadaei\n||1995–2017\n||\n|-\n||Mohammad Javad Ameri\n||2017–\n||\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:100%; line-height:16px;\"\n|-\n|+ Deputy secretaries-general\n!Name\n!Tenure\n!Ref\n|-\n||Ali Darabi\n||–2005\n||\n|-\n||Lotfollah Forouzandeh\n||2005–2015\n||\n|-\n||Mohammad Javad Ameri\n||2015–2017\n||\n|-\n||Mohammad Esmaeili\n||2019–\n||\n|}\nReferences"
