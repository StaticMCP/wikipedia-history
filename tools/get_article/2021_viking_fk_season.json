The club participated in the Eliteserien and the Norwegian Cup. It was the club's first season with Bjarte Lunde Aarsheim and Morten Jensen as managers. Viking ended the Eliteserien season in 3rd place, the club's first top-three finish since 2007.\nSeason events\nPre-season\nBjarne Berntsen left his position as manager after the 2020 season, being replaced by Bjarte Lunde Aarsheim and Morten Jensen, who took over as joint managers on 1 January 2021.\nIn March 2021, Stig Christiansen was reinstated as chairman of the club, a position he also held between 2017 and 2020.\nOn 11 March 2021, the 2021 Eliteserien season, that was due to start on 5 April, was postponed by one month due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Norway. On 31 March, the new start date for the league was announced to be 8 May 2021.\nOn 15 March, Viking confirmed the signing of forward Mai Traore from Vasalunds IF.

Viking managed to bounce back in the next game, winning 3–1 away from home against Lillestrøm, in a game where Zlatko Tripić scored his first goal after his return to the club. The next match also resulted in a victory, 2–1 over Mjøndalen on 27 May 2021.

On 23 October, Viking won 5–1 against Lillestrøm. Veton Berisha scored a hat-trick, while Harald Nilsen Tangen and Sebastian Sebulonsen scored one each.
