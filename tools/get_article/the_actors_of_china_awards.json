The awards recognize excellent actors and actresses in the Chinese television industry.\nHistory\nThe Actors of China Award was originally named \"Image List of Chinese Television Actors\" in 2014. It was renamed to \"The Actors of China\" in 2015. In 2016, the committee awards were added. The award ceremonies were hosted in Yangzhou in the first 4 years. In 2018, Chengdu acquired the right to host award ceremonies for the next 6 years.\nAward categories\nBallot awards\nThe ballot awards are divided into four main sections:\n* The Ruby Award (), also known as The Best Actor/Actress of the Year Award in the Red Group, is awarded to actors/actresses over 55 years old.\n* The Sapphire Award (), also known as The Best Actor/Actress of the Year Award in the Blue Group, is awarded to actors/actresses aged between 36 and 54\n* The Emerald Award (), also known as The Best Actor/Actress of the Year Award in the Green Group, is awarded to actors/actresses aged between 18 and 35.\n* The Web Series Award (), also known as The Best Actor/Actress of the Year Award in the Web Series Group, is awarded to actors/actresses cast in the web series and aged between 18 and 40.\nThe steps for deciding the ballot awards are as follows:\n* Step 1: A recommendation group consisting of performing artists, directors, producers, and screenwriters recommends candidate actors. After summarizing and reviewing, a list of candidates is determined and announced online.\n* Step 2: The audience vote online. The top 6 with the highest votes for each category, a total of 48 people (4 sections, each section consisting of actor/actress categories), entered the finalist. In addition, these 48 people are all awarded with The Excellent Actor in the Actors of China ().\n* Step 3: The committee select the final winners among 48 people through a non-anonymous ballot. The final winners will accept their awards in the ceremony.\nCommittee awards\nIn addition, the committee also decide other awards without ballot. The categories of committee awards vary in different years, including:\n* The Committee Actor Award (), also known as The Expert Award in the 3rd ceremony, recognizes senior artists.\n* The Best Character Actor Award (), recognizes actors who have never played any lead role in their long-term acting career, but have played classic \"small roles\".\n* The Lifetime Achievement Actor Award (), also known as The Artistic Achievement Actor Award in the 7th ceremony.\nCeremony\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!Edition\n!Date\n!Venue City\n!Refs\n|-\n| 1st || April 18, 2014|| rowspan=\"4\"| Yangzhou, Jiangsu\n|\n|-\n| 2nd || December 27, 2015\n|\n|-\n| 3rd || December 28, 2016\n|\n|-\n| 4th || January 12, 2018\n|\n|-\n| 5th || December 28, 2018 || rowspan=\"4\"| Chengdu, Sichuan\n|\n|-\n|6th || December 19, 2019\n|\n|-\n|7th || November 29, 2020\n|\n|-\n|}\nAward recipients\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n!Edition\n!Ruby Award/Red Group\n!Sapphire Award/Blue Group\n!Emerald Award/Green Group\n!Web Series Award\n!Committee Actor Award\n!Best Character Actor Award\n!Lifetime Achievement Actor Award\n!Refs\n|-\n|2||Ma Shaohua, Yan Minqiu ||Wang Zhifei, Zhang Guoqiang, Zhou Xun, Yan Ni||Yu Shaoqun, Liu Tao||||||||||\n|-\n|3||Ni Dahong, Peng Yu||Feng Yuanzheng, Song Jialun, Sa Rina, Jiang Hongbo||Hu Ge, Ma Su||Meng Asai, Wang Ning, Ai Xiaoqi, Gan Lu, Yuan Zhongfang, Xiao Yin||Liu Jia, Wang Liyun||Liu Lin, Wang Jinsong||||\n|-\n|4||Sun Chun, Liang Danni||Jin Dong, Zhang Luyi, Qin Hailu, Mei Ting||Tong Liya, Zhai Tianlin||Zhang Yishan, Lin Yushen, Jiao Junyan, Wang Zixuan||||Li Naiwen, Lu Yuan||Lü Zhong, Li Xuejian||\n|-\n|5||Liu Peiqi, Song Chunli||Liu Yijun, Calvin Li, Wan Qian, Zuo Xiaoqing||Yu Xiaoguang, Yang Mi||Nie Yuan, Pan Yueming, Qin Lan, Wu Jinyan||Liu Jing, Xu Di||Lei Kesheng, Zheng Yuzhi||||\n|-\n|6||Wu Gang, Chen Jin||Wang Kai, Zhang Xilin, Fu Jing, Yan Danchen||Zhu Yilong, Wang Xiaochen, Guan Xiaotong||Zeng Shunxi, Xing Zhaolin, Song Yiren, Chen Yuqi||Zhang Guoli, Han Tongsheng||Zhang Zhijian, Liu Mintao||||\n|-\n|7||Liang Guanhua, Cao Cuifen||Hu Jun, Chen Shu||Li Yifeng, Jiang Shuying||Zhang Ruoyun||Xi Meijuan||||Niu Ben||\n|-\n|}\nNote: The Excellent Actor in the Actors of China is awarded to all 48 candidates completing the step-2 ballot, thus are not listed in the table.
