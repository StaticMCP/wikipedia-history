They were triggered by the resignation of President Charles de Gaulle on 28 April 1969.\nBackground\nIncumbent president Charles de Gaulle proposed a referendum on government decentralisation and a reform of the Senate. In the referendum on 27 April, 53.5% of voters rejected the proposed amendments. Following the announcement of the results, De Gaulle resigned as president at noon the following day, having threatened to do so if the referendum had failed.\nCandidates\nIn the presidential election, the Gaullist Party (Union of Democrats for the Republic, UDR) was represented by former Prime Minister Georges Pompidou. He was very popular in the conservative electorate due to economic growth when he led the cabinet (from 1962 to 1968) and his role in the settlement of the May 68 crisis and winning the June 1968 legislative campaign. In his presidential campaign, he obtained the support of the Independent Republicans and their leader Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, who had voted \"no\" in the referendum.\nThe left-wing French Communist Party (PCF) proposed to the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO, later formed the Socialist Party) to present a candidate with a common programme, but the SFIO refused. The Left was severely divided in this election. The PCF candidate was Jacques Duclos, one of the historical leaders of the party. The mayor of Marseille, Gaston Defferre, was the SFIO candidate and campaigned with Pierre Mendès France, who would have become Prime Minister had Defferre been elected to the presidency. This candidacy was the first – and so far, only – dual \"ticket\" in a French presidential election. But Defferre's campaign was weakened by the decision of centrist interim President Alain Poher to run. As Chairman of the Senate, Poher had led the \"no\" campaign in the referendum. The success of the \"no\" campaign gave him the legitimacy to run for the presidency and he rallied a large swathe of centre-right and centre-left voters.\nMichel Rocard and Alain Krivine stood as candidates expressing the ideas of the May 1968 movements, though the Trotskyist Krivine took a far more radical stance.\nFirst round\nThe first round of voting was held on 1 June 1969. Out of a total of 28,774,041 eligible voters, participation in the first round hovered around 78% of the electorate. Pompidou and Poher won the right to compete in the second round by claiming 43.9% and 23.4% of the vote respectively.\nSecond round\nThe second round saw Pompidou facing Poher. None of the left-wing candidates reached the second round, despite a good campaign and the result for Duclos, who scored the best ever result for a Communist in a presidential election. The Socialists supported reluctantly the centrist Chairman of the Senate. The Communists refused to choose and used a slogan which was equivalent to the phrase \"It's six of one and half a dozen of the other\" (''c'est bonnet blanc et blanc bonnet).\nThe second round was held on 15 June 1969. About 69% of eligible voters participated. Pompidou was elected President of France with a comfortable majority of more than 58%.\nResults\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*Penniman, Howard. \"French Elections, 1969.\" World Affairs'' 132.2 (1969): 101–117.
