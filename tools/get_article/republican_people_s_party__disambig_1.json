It is the oldest political party in Turkey, founded by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the first president and founder of the modern Republic of Türkiye. The party is also cited as the founding party of modern Turkey. Its logo consists of the Six Arrows, which represent the foundational principles of Kemalism: republicanism, reformism, laicism, populism, nationalism, and statism. It is currently the second largest party in Grand National Assembly with 138 MPs, behind the ruling conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP).\nThe political party has its origins in the various resistance groups founded during the Turkish War of Independence, with most members being previously associated with the Committee of Union and Progress. Under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, they united in the 1919 Sivas Congress. In 1923, the \"People's Party\", soon adding the word \"Republican\" to its name, declared itself to be a political organisation and announced the establishment of the Turkish Republic, with Atatürk as its first president. As Turkey moved into its authoritarian one-party period, the CHP was the apparatus of implementing far reaching political, cultural, social, and economic reforms in the country.\nAfter World War II, Atatürk's successor, İsmet İnönü, allowed for multi-party elections, and the party initiated a peaceful transition of power after losing the 1950 election, ending the one-party period and beginning Turkey's multi-party period. The years following the 1960 military coup saw the party gradually trend towards the center-left, which was cemented once Bülent Ecevit became chairman in 1972. The CHP, along with all other political parties of the time, was banned by the military junta of 1980. The CHP was re-established with its original name by Deniz Baykal on 9 September 1992, with the participation of a majority of its members from the pre-1980 period. Since 2002, it has been the main opposition party to the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). Özgür Özel is the chairman of the CHP since 8 November 2023.\nCHP is an associate member of the Party of European Socialists (PES), a member of the Socialist International, and the Progressive Alliance. Many politicians of CHP have declared their support for LGBT rights and the feminist movement in Turkey. The party is pro-European and supports Turkish membership to European Union and NATO.\nHistory\nEstablishment: 1919–1923\nThe Republican People's Party has its origins in the resistance organizations, known as Defence of Rights Associations, created in the immediate aftermath of World War I in the Turkish War of Independence. In the Sivas Congress, Mustafa Kemal Pasha (Atatürk) and his colleagues united the Defence of Rights Associations into the Association for the Defence of National Rights of Anatolia and Rumelia (Anadolu ve Rumeli Müdâfaa-i Hukuk Cemiyeti) (A–RMHC), and called for elections in the Ottoman Empire to elect representatives associated with the organization. Most members of the A–RMHC were previously associated with the Committee of Union and Progress.\nAfter the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies, A–RMHC members proclaimed the Grand National Assembly as a counter government from the Ottoman government in Istanbul. The Grand National Assembly forces militarily defeated Greece, France, and Armenia, overthrew the Ottoman government, and abolished the monarchy. After the 1923 election, the A–RMHC was transformed into a political party called the People's Party (Halk Fırkası) soon changing its name to Republican People's Party (Cumhuriyet Halk Fırkası, and then Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi) (CHP). With a united parliament, the republic was proclaimed with Atatürk as its first president, the Treaty of Lausanne was ratified, and the Caliphate was abolished the next year.\nOne-party period: 1923–1950\nAtatürk era\nand his Prime Minister İsmet İnönü, 1936. İnönü would succeed him as president and CHP chairman after his death.]]\nMustafa Kemal Atatürk's People's Party began as a de facto successor of the Young Turks and the CUP. In 1924, a right-wing opposition to Atatürk led by Kâzım Karabekir, reacting against the abolition of the Caliphate, formed the Progressive Republican Party. The life of the opposition party was short. The Progressive Republican Party faced allegations of involvement in the Sheikh Said rebellion and for conspiring with remaining members of the CUP to assassinate Atatürk in the İzmir Affair. Atatürk's prime minister, İsmet İnönü, proposed the passage of the Law on Ensuring Peace which gave the government extraordinary powers. Martial law was declared, all political parties except the CHP were banned, all newspapers beyond state approved papers were banned (this ban would be lifted by 1930), and Karabekir's supporters were purged from the government. Republican Turkey was the third one-party state of Interwar Europe, after the Soviet Union and Fascist Italy. For the next two decades Turkey was under a paternalist one-party authoritarian dictatorship, with one interruption; another brief experiment of opposition politics through the formation of the Liberal Republican Party.\nstatue in the garden of the Grand National Assembly during the 4th Republican People's Party Ordinary Convention, 1935]]\nFrom 1924 to 1946, the CHP introduced sweeping social, cultural, educational, economic, and legal reforms that transformed Turkey into a republican nation state. Such reforms included the adoption of Swiss and Italian legal and penal codes, the acceleration of industrialization, land reform and rural development programs, nationalization of foreign assets, forced assimilation policies, strict secularism, women's suffrage, and switching written Turkish from Perso-Arabic script into Latin script, to name a few. In the party's second ordinary congress in 1927, Atatürk delivered a thirty-six hour long speech of his account of the pivotal last eight years of Turkish history, which ended with an appeal to the Turkish youth to protect the Republic. Its narrative has served as the basis of a growing cult of personality associated with Atatürk and the historiography of the transition to the Republic from the Sultanate. In the period of 1930–1939, Atatürk's CHP clarified its ideology from a vague left-wing-unionism for 'The Six Arrows': republicanism, reformism, laïcité (secularism), populism, nationalism, and statism, as well as borrowing tenets from communism and (Italian) fascism. They defined Atatürk's principles, which were soon known as Kemalism, and were codified into the constitution on 5 February 1937.\nWith the Ottomanism question settled, Turkish nation-building was prioritized which saw nationalist propaganda, language purification, and pseudo-scientific racial theories propagated. Opposition to Atatürk's reforms were suppressed by various coercive institutions and military force, at the expense of religious conservatives, minorities, and communists. The party-state cracked down on Kurdish resistance to assimilation, suppressing multiple rebellions and encouraging the denial of their existence. Anti-clerical and anti-veiling campaigns peaked in the mid-1930s. In the party's third convention, it clarified its approach towards the religious minorities of the Christians and the Jews, accepting them as real Turks as long as they adhere to the national ideal and use the Turkish language. However under the state sanctioned secularist climate Alevis were able to make great strides in their emancipation, and to this day make up a core constituency of the CHP. With the onset of the Great Depression, the party divided into statist and liberal factions, being championed by Atatürk's prime minister İnönü and his finance minister Celal Bayar respectively. Atatürk mostly favored İnönü's policies, so economic development of the early republic was largely confined to state-owned enterprises and five-year plans. Further left-wing Republicans centered around the Kadro circle were deemed to be impermissible, so they were closed down.\nİnönü era\nOn 12 November 1938, the day after Atatürk's death, his ally İsmet İnönü was elected the second president and assumed leadership of the Republican People's Party. İnönü's presidency saw heavy state involvement in the economy and further rural development initiatives such as Village Institutes. On foreign affairs, the Hatay State was annexed and İnönü adopted a policy of neutrality despite attempts by the Allies and Axis powers to bring Turkey into World War II, during which extensive conscription and rationing was implemented to ensure an armed neutrality. Non-Muslims especially suffered when the CHP government implemented discriminatory \"wealth taxes,\" labor battalions, and peon camps. Over the course of the war, the CHP eventually rejected ultranationalism, with pan-Turkists being purged in the Racism-Turanism Trials.\nIn the aftermath of World War II, İnönü presided over the democratization of Turkey. With the crisis of war over, factionalism between the liberals and statists again broke out. The Motion with Four Signatures resulted in the resignation of some CHP members, most prominently Bayar, who then founded the Democrat Party (DP). İnönü called for a multi-party general election in 1946 – the first multi-party general election in the country's history, in a contest between the DP and CHP. The result was a victory for the CHP, which won 395 of the 465 seats, amid criticism that the election did not live up to democratic standards. Under pressure by the new conservative parliamentary opposition and the United States, the party became especially anti-communist, and retracted some of its rural development programs and anti-clerical policies. The period between 1946 and 1950 saw İnönü prepare for a pluralistic Turkey allied with the West. A more free and fair general election was held in 1950 that led to the CHP losing power to the DP. İnönü presided over a peaceful transition of power. The 1950 election marked the end of the CHP's last majority government. The party has not been able to regain a parliamentary majority in any subsequent election since.\nRoad to the center-left: 1950–1980\nDue to the winner-take-all system in place during the 1950s, the DP achieved landslide victories in elections that were reasonably close, meaning the CHP was in opposition for 10 years. In the meantime, the party began a long transformation into a social democratic force. Even before losing power İnönü created the Ministry of Labour and signed workers protections into law, and universities were given autonomy from the state. In its ninth congress in 1951, the youth branch and the women's branch were founded. In 1953, the establishment of trade unions and vocational chambers was proposed, and support for a bicameral parliament, the establishment of a constitutional court, election security, judicial independence, and the right to strike for workers was added to the party program.\nThough the DP and CHP were rivals, the DP was founded by Republicans and mostly continued Kemalist policies. But despite its name, the Democrat Party became increasingly authoritarian by the end of its rule. İnönü was harassed and almost lynched multiple times by DP supporters, and the DP government confiscated CHP property and harassed their members. The DP blocked the CHP from forming an electoral alliance with opposition parties for the 1957 snap election. By 1960, the DP accused the CHP of plotting a rebellion and threatened its closure. With the army concerned by the DP's authoritarianism, Turkey's first military coup was performed by junior officers. After one year of junta rule the DP was banned and Prime Minister Adnan Menderes and two of his ministers were tried and executed. Right-wing parties which trace their roots to the DP have since continuously attacked the CHP for their perceived involvement in the hanging of Menderes.\nThe CHP emerged as the first-placed party at the general election of 1961, and formed a grand coalition with the Justice Party, a successor-party to the Democrat Party. This was the first coalition government in Turkey, which endured for seven-months. İnönü was able to form two more governments with other parties until the 1965 election. His labor minister Bülent Ecevit was instrumental in giving Turkish workers the right to strike and collective bargaining. As leader of the Democratic Left faction in the CHP, Ecevit contributed to the party adopting the Left of Centre (Ortanın solu) programme for that election, which they lost against the Justice Party.\nİnönü favored Ecevit's controversial faction, resulting in Turhan Feyzioğlu leaving the CHP and founding the Reliance Party. When asked about his reasoning for his favoring Ecevit, İnönü replied: \"Actually we are already a left-to-center party after embracing Laïcité. If you are populist, you are [also] at the left of center.\" With Feyzioğlu's departure, the CHP participated in the 1969 election with a Democratic Left program without qualms, though it achieved a similar result as its performance from last election due to the growing perception that the party primarily appealed to the educated urban elite. İnönü remained as opposition leader and the leader of the CHP until 8 May 1972, when he was overthrown by Ecevit in a party congress, due to his endorsement of the military intervention of 1971.\nwith Nicolae Ceaușescu, 1978]]\nEcevit adopted a distinct left wing role in politics and, although remaining staunchly nationalist, attempted to implement democratic socialism into the ideology of CHP. His arrival saw support for the party increase in the 1973 election. After establishing a coalition arrangement with an Islamist party, Ecevit made the decision to invade Cyprus in an atmosphere of deteriorating order on the island. The 1970s saw the party solidify its relations with trade unions and leftist groups in an atmosphere of intense polarization and political violence. The CHP achieved its best ever result in a free and fair multi-party election under Ecevit, when in 1977, the party received 41% of the vote, but not enough support for a stable government. Ecevit and his political rival Süleyman Demirel would constantly turnover the premiership as partisan deadlock took hold. This ended in a military coup in 1980, resulting in the banning of every political party and major politicians being jailed and banned from politics.\nRecovery period: 1980–2002\nBoth the party name \"Republican People's Party\" and the abbreviation \"CHP\" were banned until 1987. Until 1999, Turkey was ruled by the centre-right Motherland Party (ANAP) and the True Path Party (DYP), unofficial successors of the Democrat Party and the Justice Party, as well as, briefly, by the Islamist Welfare Party. CHP supporters also established successor parties. By 1985, Erdal İnönü, İsmet İnönü's son, consolidated two successor parties to form the Social Democratic Populist Party (SHP), while the Democratic Left Party (, DSP) was formed by Rahşan Ecevit, Bülent Ecevit's wife (Bülent Ecevit later took over the DSP in 1987).\nAfter the ban on pre-1980 politicians was lifted in 1987, Deniz Baykal, a household name from the pre-1980 CHP, reestablished the Republican People's Party in 1992, and the SHP merged with the party in 1995. However, Ecevit's DSP remained separate, and to this day has not merged with the CHP. Observers noted that the two parties held similar ideologies and split the Kemalist vote in the nineties. The CHP held an uncompromisingly secularist and establishmentalist character and supported bans of headscarves in public spaces and the Kurdish language.\nFrom 1991 to 1996, the SHP and then the CHP were in coalition governments with the DYP. Baykal supported Mesut Yılmaz's coalition government after the collapse of the Welfare-DYP coalition following the 28 February \"post-modern coup.\" However, due to the Türkbank scandal, the CHP withdrew its support and helped depose the government with a no confidence vote. Ecevit's DSP formed an interim-government, during which the PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan was captured in Kenya. As such, in the election of 1999, the DSP benefited massively in the polls at the expense of CHP, and the party failed to exceed the 10% threshold (8.7% vote), not winning any seats.\nMain opposition under Baykal: 2002–2010\nIn the 2002 general election, the CHP came back with 20% of the vote but 32% of the seats in parliament, as only it and the new AKP (Justice and Development Party) received above the 10% threshold to enter parliament. With DSP's collapse, CHP became Turkey's main Kemalist party. It also became the second largest party and the main opposition party, a position it has retained since. Since the dramatic 2002 election, the CHP has been racked by internal power struggles, and has been outclassed by the AKP governments of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Many of its members were critical of the leadership of CHP, especially Baykal, who they complained was stifling the party of young blood by turning away the young who turn either to apathy or even vote for the AKP. Baykal proclaimed the party to be the secularist establishment's bulwark as he pivoted the party away from the center-left towards the center.\nin Anıtkabir, Atatürk's mausoleum]]\nIn 2007, the culmination of tensions between Turkey's secularist establishment and AKP politicians turned into a political crisis. The CHP assisted undemocratic attempts by the army and judiciary to shut down the newly elected AKP. The crisis began with massive protests by secularists supported by the CHP in reaction to the AKP's candidate for that year's presidential election: Abdullah Gül, due to his background in Islamist politics and his wife's wearing of the hijab. The CHP's campaign focused on the alleged İrtica (Islamic reaction) that the AKP victory would bring into government, which served to alienate liberals and democrats from the party. The CHP chose to boycott the (indirect) election. Without quorum, Erdoğan called for a snap election to increase his mandate, in which the CHP formed an electoral alliance with the declining DSP, but gained only 21% of the vote. During the campaign season, a memorandum directed at the AKP was posted online by the Turkish Armed Forces. The CHP boycotted Gül's second attempt to be voted president, though this time Gül had the necessary quorum with MHP's participation and won. The swearing-in ceremony was boycotted by the CHP and the Chief of the General Staff Yaşar Büyükanıt.\nThe party also voted against a package of constitutional amendments to have the president elected by the people instead of parliament, which was eventually put to a referendum. The \"no\" campaign, supported by the CHP, failed, as a majority of Turks voted in favor of direct presidential elections. The final challenge against the AKP's existence was a 2008 closure trial which ended without a ban. Following the decision, the AKP government, in a covert alliance with the Gülen movement, began a purge of the Turkish military, judiciary, and police forces of secularists in the Ergenekon and Sledgehammer trials, which the CHP condemned.\nBetween 2002 and 2010, Turkey held three general elections and two local elections, all of which the CHP received between 18 and 23% of the vote.\nIn the lead up to the US-lead coalition invasion of Iraq, AKP leadership failed to come to a consensus whether to participate. By a thin margin, parliament vetoed invading Iraq, due to half of the AKP's parliamentary group voting with the CHP against war. CHP leadership briefly held a soft Euroscepticism as the AKP government came close to an ascension plan with the European Union.\nMain opposition under Kılıçdaroğlu: 2010–2023\nOn 10 May 2010, Deniz Baykal announced his resignation as leader of the Republican People's Party after a sex tape of him was leaked to the media. Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu was elected to be the new party leader. Kılıçdaroğlu returned the CHP to its traditional social-democratic image and cast away its secularist-establishmentalist character. This involved building bridges to voters it has traditionally not attracted: the devout, Kurds, and right-wing voters. However even with Kılıçdaroğlu at the helm, after five general elections, the CHP still did not win an election, receiving between only 22 and 26% of the vote in parliamentary elections. The CHP supported the unsuccessful \"no\" campaign in the 2010 constitutional referendum. In his first general election in 2011, the party increased its support by 25% but not enough to unseat the AKP. The 2013 Gezi Park protests found much support in the CHP.\nduring the 2017 March for Justice]]\nThe 2014 presidential election was the first in which the position would be directly elected and came just after a massive corruption scandal. The CHP and MHP's joint candidate Ekmeleddin İhsanoğlu still lost to Erdoğan with only 38% of the vote. The two parties were critical of the government's negotiations for peace with the PKK, which lasted from 2013–July 2015. In the June 2015 general election, the AKP lost its parliamentary majority due to the debut of the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP), which was possible because of strategic voting by CHP voters so the party could pass the 10% threshold. Coalition talks went nowhere. MHP ruled out partaking in a government with HDP in a CHP lead government and the CHP refused to govern with the AKP after weeks of negotiations. In a snap election held that November, the AKP regained their parliamentary majority as well as MHP's support.\nKılıçdaroğlu supported the government in the 2016 coup d'état attempt, the subsequent purges, and incursions into Syria. This support went so far as to help the government pass a law to lift parliamentary immunities, resulting in the jailing of MPs from the HDP, including Selahattin Demirtaş, as well as CHP lawmakers. The party lead the unsuccessful \"no\" campaign for the 2017 constitutional referendum.\n, Leader of CHP Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu and Mayor of Istanbul Ekrem İmamoğlu]]\nBy 2017, dissidents from MHP founded the Good Party. Kılıçdaroğlu was instrumental in the facilitating the rise of the new party by transferring MPs so they would have a parliamentary group to compete in the 2018 election. In the 2018 general election the CHP, Good Party, Felicity, and Democrat Party established the Nation Alliance to challenge the AKP and MHP's People's Alliance. Though CHP's vote was reduced to 22%, strategic voting for the other parties yielded the alliance 33% of the vote. Their candidate for president: Muharrem İnce, lost in the first round, receiving only 30% of the vote. The Nation Alliance was re-established for the 2019 local elections, which saw great gains for the CHP, capturing nearly 30% of the electorate. A tacit collaboration with the HDP allowed for CHP to win the municipal mayoralties of İstanbul and Ankara.\nKemal Kılıçdaroğlu was nominated as the CHP and the Nation Alliance candidate for the 2023 presidential election. Ekrem İmamoğlu and Mansur Yavaş, mayors of İstanbul and Ankara respectively, along with other party leaders in Nation Alliance, ran to be his vice-presidents. Despite the government's lackluster response to the economic crisis, COVID-19 pandemic, and the Kahramanmaraş earthquake, Kılıçdaroğlu lost his bid to Erdoğan after taking the race to a run-off and receiving 48% of the vote. The Nation Alliance again lost the parliamentary election to the ruling People's Alliance. Smaller parties to the CHP's right ran on its lists, which resulted in them receiving 35 seats in parliament for minimal electoral gains. At the 38th ordinary party congress held shortly after the election, Özgür Özel was elected leader of the CHP, defeating the incumbent Kılıçdaroğlu who had held the position since 2010.\nMain opposition under Özel: 2023–present\nThe party won a major victory in the 2024 local elections. CHP mayors were reelected in Istanbul and Ankara, along with new victories in rural Aegean and Central Anatolian provinces. Since 1977, this was the first time the CHP won the popular vote winning 37.8% of the electorate, and was the AKP's first nation-wide defeat.\nEkrem İmamoğlu, the CHP mayor of Istanbul, was detained and later arrested by police in March 2025, along with over 100 other individuals. Major protests occurred immediately following the arrests across the country, with CHP officials backing the protesters. The party's primary election to choose its nominee for president in 2028 took place on 23 March, the day of İmamoğlu's arrest, which he won in a landslide.\nFactions\nReformists\nReformists (Turkish: Değişimciler) is a colloquial term for the social democratic and progressive opposition to Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu that emerged following the 2023 Turkish presidential election. The morning after the election, Ekrem İmamoğlu posted a video on his official Twitter account, calling for \"change\" in the CHP and Turkey. On 19 July 2023, a 14-minute part of the Zoom conference between İmamoğlu and other prominent CHP officials, discussing the future strategies of the party, was leaked on YouTube. The meeting was held without the knowledge of the then-CHP leader, Kılıçdaroğlu, and it sparked outrage of some factions in the party.\nIn the meanwhile, reformists announced a website called \"İktidar İçin Değişim\", expressing the future plans for both the CHP and Turkey. The manifesto focused on change in the opposition and emphasized democratization, inclusivity, and mass participation in the decision-making process.\nThe 38th Republican People's Party Ordinary Convention was originally set for summer 2022, but the Party Assembly postponed it to November 2023, in accordance with the national COVID-19 measures. The convention was held on 4–5 November 2023, which was won by Özgür Özel, by first a slight margin, but then a landslide victory in the runoff. Following the change in the office, CHP introduced many changes in its bylaw, including a term limit for MPs, a 50% women and 30% youth quota in internal bodies, wider representation for disabled people, and primaries.\nUnder the reformist leadership, CHP achieved an unexpected victory by defeating Erdoğan's AK Party in the 2024 Turkish local elections, for the first time in two decades. In addition to mayors, the party also guaranteed majority in the municipal councils of many key cities, such as Istanbul and Ankara. It alleviated the ruling AK Party's obstructions to municipalities already held by CHP. Days after the elections, with the refreshed delegates, Ekrem İmamoğlu was elected the President of the Turkish Municipalities Union by a landslide margin, handing over a central government body to CHP for the first time since 1977.|Ekrem İmamoğlu 7 March 2024 (cropped).png||title=|align=center|footer=|style=|state=|mode=packed|height=150|width=60|captionstyle=}}\nUlusalists\nUlusalists (lit. nationalists) are a vague group within the CHP that encompasses of hardliner Kemalists and populists who draw attention to the safeguarding of the secular republic and the Turkish Revolution. Ulusalists disagreed with the then-CHP leadership in regards to reaching out to Kurds, and consolidated grounds to run against Kılıçdaroğlu. They were eventually defeated at the 18th Republican People's Party Extraordinary Convention, causing most prominent figures to leave the CHP. Muharrem İnce, who ran for president in 2018, founded the Homeland Party, a populist and self-identified Kemalist political party that was proposed as an alternative to the CHP.\nThough the Ulusalists no longer pose a united front, there are still some politicians that confront the CHP leadership. Tanju Özcan, the Mayor of Bolu, is an example. He is known for excessive xenophobist policies against Syrian migrants, such as raising water bills and marriage fees merely for the residents of foreign origin. A criminal investigation was eventually carried out by the Public Prosecutor's Office, in which he admitted that his actions were against law. Özcan was dismissed from the CHP in 2022, but the new reformist leadership pardoned him.\nY-CHP\nThe New Republican People's Party (Turkish: Yeni Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi), abbreviated Y-CHP, is a term that was first derived from the New Labour and is nowadays used in a pejorative sense to denote the fundamental reforms under Kılıçdaroğlu leadership to liberalize the CHP into becoming a centrist political party that addresses broader communities.\nIdeology and political positions\nThe Republican People's Party is a centre-left political party that espouses social democracy and Kemalism. The CHP describes itself as a \"modern social democratic party, which is faithful to the founding principles and values of the Republic of Turkey\".\nThe distance between the party administration and many leftist grassroots, especially left-oriented Kurdish voters, contributed to the party's shift away from the political left.\nSome leftists critical of Kemalism criticize the party's continuous opposition to the removal of Article 301 of the Turkish penal code, which caused people to be prosecuted for \"insulting Turkishness\" including Elif Şafak and Nobel Prize winner author Orhan Pamuk, its conviction of Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink, its attitude towards minorities in Turkey, as well as its Cyprus policy.\nNumerous politicians from the party have espoused support for LGBT rights, and the feminist movement in Turkey.\nKemal Kılıçdaroğlu and then Özgür Özel have repeatedly called for Selahattin Demirtaş and Osman Kavala to be released from jail.\nForeign policy\nThe party holds a significant position in the Socialist International, Progressive Alliance and is an associate member of the Party of European Socialists. In 2014, the CHP urged the Socialist International to accept the Republican Turkish Party of Northern Cyprus as a full member.\nDuring the Gaza war, Chairman Özgür Özel accused Israel of committing state sanctioned terrorism on the Palestinian people, declaring \"The Turkish left is never far from the Palestinian cause.\" Özel considers Hamas' October 7 attack against Israeli civilians \"an act of terrorism.\"\nWhile the CHP has voted against Turkish intervention in Iraq since 2021, and since 2023, it has also voted against intervention in Syria. In a close parliamentary vote, the CHP goaded enough AKP defectors to veto Turkey joining America's 2003 invasion of Iraq in the 1 March Memorandum.\nThe party is pro-European and supports Turkish membership to the European Union. They also support Turkish membership to NATO and the expansion of the alliance. The party MPs voted overwhelmingly in favor of both Finland's and Sweden's accession into NATO.\nElectorate\n.]]\nThe CHP draws its support from professional middle-class secular and liberally religious voters. It has traditional ties to the middle and upper-middle classes such as white-collar workers, retired generals, and government bureaucrats as well as academics, college students, left-leaning intellectuals and labour unions such as DİSK. The party also appeals to minority groups such as Alevis. According to The Economist, \"to the dismay of its own leadership the CHP's core constituency, as well as most of its MPs, are Alevis.\" The party's former leader, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, was also an Alevi.\nThe CHP also draws much of their support from voters of big cities and coastal regions. The party's strongholds are the west of the Aegean Region (İzmir, Aydın, Muğla), the northwest of the Marmara Region (Turkish Thrace; Edirne, Kırklareli, Tekirdağ, Çanakkale), the east of the Black Sea Region (Ardahan and Artvin), and the Anatolian college town of Eskişehir.\nParty leaders\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!
