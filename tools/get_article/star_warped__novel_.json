      "text": "# Star Warped (novel)\n\nStar Warped is a farcical 2005 spoof novel by British writer Adam Roberts, based on the six Star Wars films.\nPlot synopsis\nThe story takes place in the production order of the films, rather than the chronological order, starting with episodes 4-6 and ending with episodes 1–3. The bulk of the story concentrates on the character of Luke Seespotrun as he joins the Rebelend in their struggle against the nefarious forces of the Imperial Empire of the Imperium, trying to prevent them from enslaving the entire galaxy.\nDue to page restrictions the last three episodes are heavily abbreviated with Episode II being only three chapters and Episode III only one chapter long.\nThe Chapters\n*Episode IV: A Nude Hope\n*Episode V: The Empire Strides around in Black\n*Episode VI: Return of the Son of Jobbi Rides Again\n*Episode I: The Fans-of-Tron Menace\n*Episode II: Attack of the Clichés\n*Episode III: Revenge of the Return of the Son of Psmyth Rides Again: the Next Generation - The Early Years\nCharacters\n*Luke Seespotrun is based on Luke Skywalker.
