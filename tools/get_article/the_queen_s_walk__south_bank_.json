However, the last section was not established until the completion of construction of London Bridge City c.1990.\nIn 1996, the Walk was recognised as a foundation for establishing the Thames Path national trail through London.\nThis is a convenient route of several miles for tourists to walk from the London Eye Ferris wheel past numerous attractions to Tower Bridge and the Tower of London.\nExternal links\n* [http://www.walklondon.com/london-walks/the-queens-walk-london.htm The Queen's Walk London]\n* [http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/thamespath/ Thames Path National Trail]\n\n---\n\n## The Queen’s Walk (South Bank)\n\n#REDIRECT The Queen's Walk (South Bank)"
