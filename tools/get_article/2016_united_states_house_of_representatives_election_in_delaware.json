The election coincided with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, as well as other elections to the House of Representatives, elections to the United States Senate and various state and local elections. The primaries were held on September 13.\nDemocrat John Carney, the incumbent representative, did not run for reelection, instead successfully running for governor of Delaware. Democrat Lisa Blunt Rochester won the open seat on November 8.\nWhen she was sworn into office on January 3, 2017, she became the first woman and the first African-American to represent Delaware in Congress.\nDemocratic primary\nDemocrats Bryon Short, a member of the Delaware House of Representatives from Highland Woods, and Bryan Townsend, a member of the Delaware Senate from Newark, Delaware, had previously said they would run for the seat if Carney ran for governor. Following Carney's announcement that he would run for governor, both Short and Townsend declared their candidacies in the race to succeed him. Lisa Blunt Rochester, the former State Labor Secretary, also joined the race. Short later withdrew from the race, citing difficulties fundraising. Rochester won the primary with 43.8% of the vote.\nCandidates\nNominee\n* Lisa Blunt Rochester, former state labor secretary, former state personnel director, and former CEO of the Metropolitan Wilmington Urban League\nEliminated in primary\n* Sean Barney, former policy director for Governor Jack Markell and nominee for state treasurer in 2014\n* Mike Miller, businessman and perennial candidate\n* Bryan Townsend, state senator\nWithdrawn\n* Bryon Short, state representative\nDeclined\n* Chris Bullock, president of the New Castle County Council (running for re-election)\n* John Carney, incumbent U.S. representative (running for governor)\n* Marla Blunt Carter, college professor and former congressional aide\n* Jack Markell, governor of Delaware\n* Brenda Mayrack, former executive director of the Delaware Democratic Party and nominee for state auditor in 2014\n* Collin O'Mara, president and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation and former State Natural Resources and Environmental Control Secretary\n* Dennis E.
