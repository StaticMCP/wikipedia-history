While the Local Government Act 1972 and the Localism Act 2011 set out general powers to do anything necessary to fulfill their duties, and to act with full capacity (such as a limited company can), there is no codified list of powers set out in a statute. Instead, there are around 220 duties found in various pieces of legislation falling under the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, and 1120 pieces of legislation falling under other departments. Further local devolution is anticipated following the 2024 King's Speech under an \"English Devolution Bill\"\nList of powers\nDepartment of Communities administered duties\nIn 2011, there were 220 legislative duties of local authorities for which the Department of Communities is responsible.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | Accountability\n!
