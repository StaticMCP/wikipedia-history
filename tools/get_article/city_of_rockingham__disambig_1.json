The area at the time fell within the responsibility of the Fremantle District Road Board. The name \"Clarence\" was declined by the Department of Lands and Surveys, and the Rockingham Road District was gazetted on 4 February 1897.\nThe agricultural hall on the corner of Flinders Lane and Kent Street in Rockingham was used for the Roads Board's administration until an office was constructed for the Roads Board on the corner of Office Road and Mandurah Road in East Rockingham in 1905. In 1929 the Board resolved to relocate the administration to Rockingham Beach and the various buildings, including the Agricultural Hall and the vacated Rockingham Beach Primary School building on Kent Street, were used as the Board's offices.\nA new office was constructed for the Roads Board in 1946 on the corner of Flinders Lane and Kent Street.\nIn February 1954 the Kwinana Road District was formed from the northern portion of the Rockingham Road District.\nOn 1 July 1961, the Road District became the Shire of Rockingham following enactment of the Local Government Act 1960. In 1971, the Shire relocated to new offices on Council Avenue on land donated by developers Rockingham Park Pty Ltd 2&nbsp;km southeast of the traditional centre of Rockingham Beach, which was to become the new major centre of Rockingham and Kwinana. The Rockingham City Shopping Centre opened in the new centre in 1971. Despite the move to the new \"city centre,\" the community apparently considered Rockingham Beach to be the rightful civic heart of Rockingham, as evidenced by the Shire's decision to construct Flinders Hall on Flinders Lane, despite the new Council offices being constructed in the same year.\nOn 12 November 1988 the Council attained City status. In 1994, the City relocated to new Council chambers and civic centre on Civic Boulevard.\nIn 2008, the Council adopted a plan for the Rockingham Strategic Regional (or Primary) Centre which incorporated both the traditional centre at Rockingham Beach and the \"City Centre\" of the 1970s into a larger, encompassing centre. The plan seeks to increase the residential population within this new city centre envelope from 12,000 to 36,000 through the provision of transit-oriented development, which would in turn support the operation of light rail between the Rockingham Train Station and Rockingham Beach.\nWards and mayor\nThe city has been divided into four wards.\n* Rockingham Ward (3 councillors)\n* Safety Bay Ward (3 councillors)\n* Baldivis Ward (3 councillors)\n* Comet Bay Ward (2 councillors)\nHistorically, the mayor was elected from among the councillors. The election system was changed for the 2021 council election, with the mayor directly elected. Deb Hamblin succeeded retiring Barry Sammels as mayor of the City of Rockingham, becoming the first female to hold this position. Hamblin was officially sworn in on 19 October 2021 for a four-year term.\nAt the time of the announcement of his retirement in August 2021, Barry Sammels had been the longest-serving active mayor in Western Australia, having first been elected mayor of Rockingham in 2003. Previous to this, he had been elected as a councillor in 1997 and as the deputy mayor in 2001.\nOf the current councillors, Leigh Liley is the longest-serving, having first been elected to the council in 1999, while the current mayor, Deb Hamblin, served on the council from 2005 until her election to mayor.\nCurrent council composition:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Position\n!Name\n!Term\n|-\n| Mayor\n| Deb Hamblin\n| 2021–25\n|-\n| Deputy mayor\n| Lorna Buchan\n| 2023–25\n|-\n| rowspan=6 |Rockingham/Safety Bay Ward\n| Peter Hudson\n| 2023–27\n|-\n| Craig Buchanan\n| 2023–27\n|-\n| Mark Jones\n| 2023–27\n|-\n| Caroline Hume\n| 2021–25\n|-\n| Leigh Liley\n| 2021–25\n|-\n| Dawn Jecks\n| 2021–25\n|-\n| rowspan=3 |Baldivis Ward\n| Mike Crichton\n| 2023–27\n|-\n| Kelly Middlecoat\n| 2023–27\n|-\n| Brett Wormall\n| 2021–25\n|-\n| rowspan=2 |Comet Bay Ward\n| Lorna Buchan\n| 2023–27\n|-\n| Robert Schmidt\n| 2021–25\n|}\nElection results\n2023\nSuburbs\nThe suburbs of the City of Rockingham with population and size figures based on the most recent Australian census:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Suburb\n!data-sort-type=number|Population\n!data-sort-type=number|Area\n!Map\n|-\n| Baldivis ||  ||  ||\n|-\n| Cooloongup ||  ||  ||\n|-\n| East Rockingham ||  ||  ||\n|-\n| Garden Island ||  ||  ||\n|-\n| Golden Bay ||  ||  ||\n|-\n| Hillman ||  ||  ||\n|-\n| Karnup ||  ||  ||\n|-\n| Keralup * ||  ||  ||\n|-\n| Peron ||  ||  ||\n|-\n| Port Kennedy ||  ||  ||\n|-\n| Rockingham ||  ||  ||\n|-\n| Safety Bay ||  ||  ||\n|-\n| Secret Harbour ||  ||  ||\n|-\n| Shoalwater ||  ||  ||\n|-\n| Singleton ||  ||  ||\n|-\n| Waikiki ||  ||  ||\n|-\n| Warnbro ||  ||  ||\n|}\nIndicates locality is only partially located within the City of Rockingham\nPopulation\nIn 1954, Kwinana was excised from Rockingham.\nMedia\nRockingham is serviced by one local newspaper: the Sound Telegraph is delivered every Wednesday.\nConservation\nRockingham Lakes Regional Park, at 4,270 hectares, occupies approximately 16 percent of the area of the City of Rockingham. The park, established in 1997, consists of areas of land that have been identified as having outstanding conservation,\nlandscape and recreation values.\nHeritage-listed places\n, 115 places are heritage-listed in the City of Rockingham, of which seven are on the State Register of Heritage Places, among them Cape Peron K Battery Complex, the Bell Cottage ruin and Lake Richmond.\nSport and recreation\nRockingham is home to the Rockingham Rams in the Peel Football League; Rockingham Flames in NBL1 West; Rockingham City FC in the National Premier Leagues WA; Rockingham Rams in the Harcher State Baseball League; Rockingham Rugby Union club in the RugbyWA competition; and the Rockingham Coastal Sharks in the Western Australia Rugby League.\nSister cities\nThe City of Rockingham has two active affiliations to which it is a signatory, being:\n* City of Akō, located in the Hyōgo Prefecture of Japan – A \"sister city\" relationship based on opportunities for residents and groups to exchange diverse cultural aspects, particularly during official and community visits. \"Ako Lane\", located next to the Council building, is a tribute to this relationship.\n* Kota Kinabalu, the capital city of the Malaysian state Sabah – A \"friendship city\" agreement in conjunction with the objectives of the South West Group to support potential bilateral trade between firms in the two regions.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
