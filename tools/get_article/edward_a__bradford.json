Bradford wrote a letter to his mother about 7th US President Andrew Jackson's visit to the Yale campus. He states, \"Jackson left town this morning for Hartford. He arrived here Saturday afternoon from New York + remained over Sunday, thus giving me a full opportunity to inspect him.  He was attended by Mr. Van Buren (VP) … (NY Governor) + other distinguished characters.\"\nBradford was nominated by President Millard Fillmore as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States on August 16, 1852, to succeed John McKinley. The Senate declined to act on the nomination before the session ended and Bradford was not re-nominated.\nBradford became ill with an unspecified disease in 1869 and left his law practice to seek treatment in Europe. After stays in England and Germany, he died in Paris, France, on November 22, 1872.\nReferences"
