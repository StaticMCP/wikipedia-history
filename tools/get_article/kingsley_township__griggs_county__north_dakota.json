The township board met on February 23, 1893, and discussed the possibility of dividing Pleasant View into two Townships - Clearfield and Kingsley.  There is no record of any action being taken.  However, on July 9, 1894, it seemed to have been separated and Clearfield Township was in existence, so Kingsley Township must have been formed sometime after February 9, 1888\nDemographics\nIts population during the 2010 census was 92.\nLocation within Griggs County\nKingsley Township is located in Township 146 Range 61 west of the Fifth principal meridian.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\"\n|-\n||\n! scope=\"col\" | Range 61\n! scope=\"col\" | Range 60\n! scope=\"col\" | Range 59\n! scope=\"col\" | Range 58\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Township 148\n| Rosendal\n| Willow\n| Pilot Mound\n| Lenora\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Township 147\n| Bryan\n| Addie\n| Tyrol\n| Romness\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Township 146\n| style=\"background: yellow\"|Kingsley\n| Clearfield\n| Cooperstown\n| Washburn\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Township 145\n| Mabel\n| Helena\n| Ball Hill\n| Sverdrup\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Township 144\n| Dover\n| Bartley\n| Greenfield\n| Broadview\n|}\nReferences"
