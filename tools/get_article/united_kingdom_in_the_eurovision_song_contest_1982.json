The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final. In addition, the BBC was also the host broadcaster and staged the event at the Harrogate International Centre in Harrogate, after winning the  with the song \"Making Your Mind Up\" by Bucks Fizz.\nBefore Eurovision\nA Song for Europe 1982\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) used once again the television show A Song for Europe to select its entry, as it had since its debut at the contest in 1957. Terry Wogan once again hosted the contest, which was held on 24 March at Studio 1 of the BBC Television Centre in London. Eight songs were shortlisted from those submitted to the Music Publishers Association. Bucks Fizz were guests at the show, singing their current single \"My Camera Never Lies\" in a pre-recorded performance. The group were interviewed by Terry Wogan live during the show and group member Bobby G performed backing vocals for the winning artists, Bardo. The BBC Concert Orchestra under the direction of Ronnie Hazlehurst as conductor accompanied all the songs, but despite performing live, the orchestra were off-screen, behind the set.\nThe regional juries voted internally and awarded 15 points to their favourite song, 12 points to the second, 10 points to the third and then 9, 8, 7, 6 and 5 points in order of preference for the songs from 4th to 8th. The juries were based in Glasgow, Birmingham, Bristol, Belfast, London, Manchester and Cardiff.\nBardo's victory meant that Sally-Ann Triplett became only the third singer to win the Song for Europe contest twice, having already won the 1980 contest as part of Prima Donna. (Cliff Richard had represented the UK twice in Eurovision, but did not participate in a contest to determine the British artist). Triplett remains the only artist to have participated multiple times to win the contest at all attempts.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center\"\n|-\n|+ A Song for Europe 198224 March 1982\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Draw\n! scope=\"col\" | Artist\n! scope=\"col\" | Song\n! scope=\"col\" | Songwriter(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Points\n! scope=\"col\" | Place\n|-\n| 1 || align=\"left\" | Q-Feel || align=\"left\" | \"Dancing in Heaven (Orbital Be-Bop)\" || align=\"left\" | Brian Fairweather, Martin Page || 59 || 6th\n|-\n| 2 || align=\"left\" | Paul Curtis || align=\"left\" | \"No Matter How I Try\" || align=\"left\" | Paul Curtis || 60 || 4th\n|-\n| 3 || align=\"left\" | The Touring Company || align=\"left\" | \"Every Step of the Way\" || align=\"left\" | David Mindel || 69 || 2nd\n|-\n| 4 || align=\"left\" | Lovin' Feeling || align=\"left\" | \"Different Worlds and Different People\" || align=\"left\" | Tony Hiller, Paul Curtis || 60 || 4th\n|-\n| 5 || align=\"left\" | Good Looks || align=\"left\" | \"Every Day of My Life\" || align=\"left\" | Patrick Burston, David Mindel ||69 || 2nd\n|-\n| 6 || align=\"left\" | Rich Gypsy || align=\"left\" | \"You're the Only Good Thing in My Life\" || align=\"left\" | Elaine Saffer, John Carrington || 53 || 8th\n|- style=\"font-weight:bold; background:gold;\"\n| 7 || align=\"left\" | Bardo || align=\"left\" | \"One Step Further\" || align=\"left\" | Simon Jefferis || 76 || 1st\n|-\n| 8 || align=\"left\" | The Weltons || align=\"left\" | \"How Long\" || align=\"left\" | Paul Curtis, Graham Sacher || 58 || 7th\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n|+ Detailed Jury Votes\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Draw\n! scope=\"col\" | Song\n! scope=\"col\"\n! scope=\"col\"\n! scope=\"col\"\n! scope=\"col\"\n! scope=\"col\"\n! scope=\"col\"\n! scope=\"col\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Total\n|-\n| 1\n| align=\"left\" | \"Dancing in Heaven (Orbital Be-Bop)\"\n| 15 || 8 || 8 || 7 || 10 || 5 || 6 || 59\n|-\n| 2\n| align=\"left\" | \"No Matter How I Try\"\n| 12 || 6 || 6 || 15 || 5 || 9 || 7 || 60\n|-\n| 3\n| align=\"left\" | \"Every Step of the Way\"\n| 6 || 15 || 15 || 6 || 12 || 6 || 9 || 69\n|-\n| 4\n| align=\"left\" | \"Different Worlds and Different People\"\n| 7 || 9 || 7 || 8 || 7 || 7 || 15 || 60\n|-\n| 5\n| align=\"left\" | \"Every Day of My Life\"\n| 8 || 10 || 10 || 12 || 9 || 12 || 8 || 69\n|-\n| 6\n| align=\"left\" | \"You're the Only Good Thing in My Life\"\n| 5 || 7 || 5 || 10 || 6 || 15 || 5 || 53\n|-\n| 7\n| align=\"left\" | \"One Step Further\"\n| 10 || 12 || 12 || 9 || 15 || 8 || 10 || 76\n|-\n| 8\n| align=\"left\" | \"How Long\"\n| 9 || 5 || 9 || 5 || 8 || 10 || 12 || 58\n|-\n! colspan=\"10\" | Jury Spokespersons\n|-\n| colspan=\"10\" |\n* GlasgowKen Bruce\n* BirminghamDavid Freeman\n* BristolAndy Batten-Foster\n* BelfastDavid Olver\n* LondonRay Moore\n* ManchesterJohn Mundy\n* CardiffIwan Thomas\n|}\nAt Eurovision\nThe BBC hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 1982 in Harrogate, presented by Jan Leeming.
