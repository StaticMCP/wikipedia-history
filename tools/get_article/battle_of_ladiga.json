The last of the fighting between the armies of generals John B. Hood and William T. Sherman, it was here that Confederate Brigadier-General Samuel W. Ferguson turned back Brigadier-General Kenner Garrard's larger force. The two armies fought all summer from Chattanooga to Atlanta, then west to Ladiga. To split the South, Sherman turned and led Federal forces in the Savannah Campaign. Hood withdrew to reoccupy Tennessee, fighting the battles of Franklin and Nashville.\nSee also\n* List of American Civil War battles\n* List of battles 1801–1900\n* Troop engagements of the American Civil War, 1864\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=132782 Battle of Ladiga] at the Historical Marker Database"
