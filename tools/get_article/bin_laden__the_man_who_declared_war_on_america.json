      "text": "# Bin Laden: The Man Who Declared War on America\n\nBin Laden: The Man Who Declared War on America () is a New York Times Bestseller by Yossef Bodansky, the former Director of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare.\nThe book provides a full account of the rise of Osama bin Laden and discusses Islamism. Bodansky concludes \"Ultimately, the quintessence of bin Laden's threat is his being a cog, albeit an important one, in a large system that will outlast his own demise -- state-sponsored international terrorism.\" The book details support from Sudan and Afghanistan but claims that perhaps bin Laden's biggest supporter is Iran. Bodansky also alleges a cooperative relationship between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda. The book's success as best-seller was amid controversy of a purported political agenda therein.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/fc/2001-10-26-bin-laden.htm Excerpt published in USA Today]"
