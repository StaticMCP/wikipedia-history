The first half of the book introduces role-playing concepts and describes medieval Europe's history, economy, religion, magic, etc. The latter half contains the game rules, covering character creation (flavored by astrology), social class, combat (where PC behavior and morale is often controlled by the dice), large scale combat, magic (based on actual medieval concepts), clerics and divine power, and monsters.\nPublication history\nFantasy Wargaming was written by \"a circle of gamers in and around Cambridge University under the leadership of Bruce Galloway,\" who would serve as editor of the project, and published by Patrick Stephens Limited in 1981 as a 222-page hardcover with cover and interior art by Lawrence Heath. A second edition was published by Stein & Day in 1982. A third edition was published by Doubleday Book Club in 1982 as a 300-page digest-sized hardcover.\nThis book should not be confused with Fantasy Wargaming by Martin Hackett, which was a set of fantastic wargames rules published in 1990 by Patrick Stephens Limited, nor with Hackett's 2007 roleplaying adaptation of those rules as Fantasy Gaming from the same publisher.\nReception\nFantasy Wargaminging was not well received by many critics, some of whom called it the worst role-playing game ever published.\nGreg Stafford reviewed Fantasy Wargaming for Different Worlds magazine and stated that \"I think the book should have received some stiff editorial judgement before publication. If trimmed and slightly redirected it could have been presented correctly as a medieval sourcebook. Alternately, an editor could have recognized the holes in the game system by reading it himself, with a critical eye, and ordered another rewrite before putting his publishing company on the line. As it is, this is a book for afficionados, not beginners.\"\nW.G. Armintrout was one of those critics, writing in The Space Gamer No. 56 \"I've never seen a worse game. It's too bad that many people's first experience with FRP may be through buying Fantasy Wargaming through the Science Fiction Book Club.\"\nRoy Cram, Jr. reviewed Fantasy Wargaming for Pegasus magazine and stated that \"The rules are the principal shortcoming, being very complicated and unclear. The book is interesting, however, for the great amount of factual material it contains about the middle ages and for many of the interesting ideas it presents. DMs and Judges will probably find it useful and interesting, but, as a game, it will appeal only to those dedicated players who must have total realism at whatever cost to playability.\"\nIn his 1990 book The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games, game critic Rick Swan called this \"Among the worst RPGs ever published. Fantasy Wargaming shows just how badly a game can go astray.\" Swan called the historical material \"rambling, dry, and mostly superfluous to the game it allegedly supports.\" Swan did not like the complicated character generation system \"pointlessly based on astrology.\" He also found \"the magic system is nearly incomprehensible, requiring players to navigate divination tables, ethereal influences, mana accumulation, and a host of other difficult concepts.\" Swan concluded by giving this book a very poor rating of only 1 out of 4, saying, \"Top it off with some distasteful references to Black Masses and you've got a game that I wouldn't touch with a ten-foot broomstick.\"\nLawrence Schick, in his 1991 book Heroic Worlds, noted that the game rules were \"rather complex\" and the magic system \"quite complicated\".\nStreet Vincent, writing in Adventurer Magazine No. 2, had a milder view, finding \"the religion/magic system is really what makes FW.\" Vincent concluded, \"FW is not a game for beginners, but is a suitable alternative for anybody seeking a realistic, coherent fantasy game.\"\nIn Issue 15 of Commodore User Magazine, John Ransley called this book \"a treasure trove of information about creating scenarios and characters, playing rules, combat, magic and spells and almost every other element of the dungeonmaster's art.\"\nIn online discussion, beginning in about 2004, the game received more mixed reviews and discussion, though a large portion did remain negative, with comments like \"If I had to sum this book up in one word, I guess I'd go with: 'NO!'\" being fairly typical, while others might \"recommend the book for research\" but fall short of \"recommend[ing] trying to play it.\" Still others express views of the game as needing work, but fundamentally a good or interesting attempt.\nOther reviews and commentary\n*Alarums & Excursions (Issue 326 - Oct 2002)\nReferences"
