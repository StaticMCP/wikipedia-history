From the 10th to 12th century Jamtland was self-governing and was independent of any crown, hence the name \"Republic of Jamtland\".  It was annexed in 1178 to the crown of Norway. It still exercised significant self-rule, and its primary connection to the Norwegian king was through paying royal taxes. The Orkney Islands were the only other area that enjoyed similar self-rule.\nHistory\nThe concept of the Republic of Jamtland  was founded in 1964 (recalling the former 10th-century republic) in reaction to emigration from the county. The event that triggered its foundation was the centralist plan of Swedish officials to merge Jämtland County with Västernorrland County. The founders organized an association, The Liberation Movement, and mobilized the people through the \"freedom festival\" Storsjöyran. TV entertainer Yngve Gamlin was \"elected\" president, and Jamtland was proclaimed a republic in its own right, within the Kingdom of Sweden.\nThe second president, the comedian Moltas Erikson, described the Liberation Movement as \"51% in jest and 49% in earnest\". It is largely seen as a humorous hoax, and actual support for an independent state among the local population is low. The movement's main focus is to preserve and promote the Jamtlandic culture, language and way of life, but not independence for the three \"constituent republics\".\nThe third president was Ewert Ljusberg, a man again from show business. Once a year he made a popular speech at the city festival Storsjöyran in Östersund where he agitated against and mocked the \"Big-Swedes\", the Swedish government and the European Union, in a simultaneously serious and joking manner.\nActress and television host Eva Röse was elected the Republic's fourth president in 2022.\nNational symbols\nIn addition to the flag of the Republic of Jamtland (which unmistakably has the Norwegian Lion in its centre), the republic boasts its own national anthem, entitled \"Jämtlandssången\". Versions of the song exist in both Swedish and Jamtlandic, the official language of the republic.\nPresidents of the Republic of Jamtland\n*1963–1983: Yngve Gamlin (1926–1995)\n*1983–1988: Moltas Erikson (1932–1988)\n*1988–2021: Ewert Ljusberg (1945–2021)\n*2022–present: Eva Röse (born 1973)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.storsjoyran.se/ Storsjöyran]\n*[http://www.republikenjamtland.se/ The Liberation Movement]"
