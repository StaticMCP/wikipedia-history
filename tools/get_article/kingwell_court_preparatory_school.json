The school opened in 1936.\nKingwell Court School merged with The Old Ride School, which moved from its original home at Little Horwood, Buckinghamshire, in 1959. Boys from The Old Ride joined the Kingwell Court boys in a combined school, renamed \"The Old Ride\" in the winter term of 1959.\nThe school closed down in 1990. Its building, Frankleigh House, is now in residential use.\nReferences"
