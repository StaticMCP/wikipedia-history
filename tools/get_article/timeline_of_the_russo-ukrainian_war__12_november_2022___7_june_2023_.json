      "text": "# Timeline of the Russo-Ukrainian war (12 November 2022 – 7 June 2023)\n\nThis timeline of the Russo-Ukrainian war covers the period from 12 November 2022, following the conclusion of Ukraine's Kherson and Kharkiv counteroffensives, to 7 June 2023, the day before the 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive began. Russia continued its strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure while the battle of Bakhmut escalated.\nThis timeline is a dynamic and fluid list, and as such may never satisfy criteria of completeness. Moreover, some events may only be fully understood and/or discovered in retrospect.\nNovember 2022\n14 November\nThe United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution that held Russia responsible for all damage caused to Ukraine by the invasion and demanded reparations.\n15 November\nRussia launched about 85 to 100 missiles at a number of Ukrainian cities. The strategic bombing campaign caused severe shortages of electricity and water at multiple cities. According to the Ukrainian Air Force some 77 of 96 Russian missiles were shot down. A Pentagon official claimed the Russian plan was to exhaust the Ukrainian air defences. At one stage some 50 missiles were in combat \"within minutes\" near the Polish border.\nA missile crossed over the Ukrainian-Polish border and struck the village of Przewodów, killing two civilians. Top leaders in Poland held an emergency meeting. Initial assessments by the United States found that the missile was likely to have been an air defence missile fired by Ukrainian forces at an incoming Russian missile.\nAccording to Ukraine's Operational Command South, Ukrainian rocket and artillery units attacked Russian positions on the left bank of the Dnipro River and in the area of the Kinburn Spit.\n16 November\nThe Ukrainians claimed to have killed or wounded 50 Russian soldiers in a long-range strike on the village of Denezhnykove, in Luhansk Oblast.\n17 November\nAfter the missile strikes, more than 10 million people were without power by 17 November, but a day later Ukrainian officials reported that electricity had already been restored to \"nearly 100%\" of Ukraine.\nAccording to Ukrainian officials, one of the wrecks of missiles found after a missile attack earlier that day was that of an \"X-55/Kh-55\" cruise missile. These missiles were apparently incapable of carrying a conventional warhead, but this specific missile had an \"imitation block\" (model for training) of a nuclear bomb. They believed the missile was meant to help overwhelm Ukraine's missile defenses.\n19 November\nThe Ukrainians claimed to have killed 60 Russian soldiers in a long-range strike on the village of Mykhailkva, 40&nbsp;km south of Kherson. It was the second such strike in four days.\n23 November\nafter missile strike on 23 November]]\nThe European Parliament declared Russia a \"state sponsor of terrorism\" for the way it had systematically attacked civilians and committed war crimes. This declaration was symbolic, but called for more sanctions.\nThe Russian military launched 65 to 70 missiles at civilian settlements and energy infrastructure, although 51 of those were said to have been shot down. The attack caused blackouts over much of Ukraine and forced several nuclear power plants to shut down. Much of Moldova also experienced blackouts due to the power grid failure in Ukraine.\n25 November\nAccording to U.S. and Ukrainian officials, about 1/3 of Western-supplied artillery went out of action in Ukraine due to wear-related mechanical problems. The United States European Command was said to have a repair base in Poland, but there were problems in transporting the weapons there from the front.\n28 November\nThe Russian army was actively pushing on both sides of Bakhmut, in Donetsk Oblast. The Russians were trying to encircle the town but were making very slow progress, according to observers.\n29 November\nJens Stoltenberg, the Secretary-General of NATO, made a speech at the meeting of NATO foreign ministers at Bucharest, in which he expressed the alliance's commitment to support Ukraine for as long as is required, because allowing Russia to win would only embolden President Vladimir Putin. He also promised Ukraine that NATO would one day accept them as a member and that Putin cannot deny sovereign nations the right to make their own sovereign decisions that were not a threat to Russia. He also speculated that the main challenges to Putin were democracy and freedom.\n30 November\nUrsula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, suggested the creation of a UN court to investigate war crimes committed by Russia. Russia does not recognize the International Criminal Court, so the European Commission proposed two possible alternative ways to hold Russia accountable: either to create a court that would be set up by international treaties, or to create an international court with a number of judges from several countries. She estimated the war damage to Ukraine is about 600 billion Euros. She proposed a financial plan to help pay for this. She pointed out that the EU had frozen 300 billion Euros worth of Russian central bank reserves and 20 billion Euros worth of money belonging to Russian oligarchs, which she suggested should be invested. The investments could be given to Ukraine when sanctions are lifted. The original statement by Ursula von der Leyen included a claim that 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers and 20,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed so far in the war. This angered Ukrainian military officials, who said that the death toll was classified information. In response, the European Commission edited the video of von der Leyen's speech to remove this information. Official publications of the text of the speech were also edited to omit the numbers.\nDecember 2022\n2 December\nUkrainian Presidential Advisor Mykhailo Podolyak claimed that 10–13,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since 24 February, the figure last given in August was 9,000.\nThe Ukrainians struck a Russian concentration near Starobilsk, in the rear area of Luhansk Oblast, reportedly killing 14 Russian personnel and wounding 30.\n5 December\nExplosions were reported at two Russian airbases: the one at Engels-2 reportedly damaged two Tu-95s; the other at the Dyagilevo military airbase near Ryazan, destroyed a fuel truck and killed three, injuring five. The Russian Ministry of Defence stated Ukraine attempted to strike Russia's long-range aviation bombers with Soviet-made jet drones, and that the drones were subsequently shot down at low altitude when approaching the air bases. The attack involved the use of Tu-141 drones that were taken out of storage and appeared to have been fitted with improvised explosives. While no significant damage or burn marks were visible on satellite images of Engels-2, at least one Tu-22M3 bomber was visually confirmed to be slightly damaged at Dyagilevo.\nFollowing the attacks, Russia launched a renewed wave of missile strikes against Ukraine, consisting of about 70 cruise missiles. Ukraine claimed 60 missiles were shot down, Russia claimed 17 targets were hit on the ground. As a result, a missile fell into the territory of Moldova, near the city of Briceni.\n6 December\nThe Governor of Kursk Oblast in Russia, Roman Starovoyt, claimed that a Ukrainian drone attack destroyed an oil tank near an airbase.

A few hours after Putin's statement, Jens Stoltenberg, general secretary of NATO, warned that there was a real possibility of a major war between Russia and NATO.\nRussia re-occupied the previously liberated Dnipro river island of Ostriv Velykyi Potomkin close to Kherson. This was confirmed by presidential advisor Oleksii Arestovych and Lieutenant Colonel Konstiantyn Mashovets, as well as some unofficial Russian sources. The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces claimed on 15 December that Russia had begun the process of forcibly deporting the island's civilian residents.\n10 December\nRussia used Iranian-made drones to hit two energy facilities in Odesa, leaving all non-critical infrastructure in the Ukrainian port without power and 1.5&nbsp;million people without electricity.\nUkraine launched a missile attack on the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol including at a military barracks.
