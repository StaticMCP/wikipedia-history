It combines a museum, a research institute, libraries, international partner organizations, scientific laboratories, centers of traditional crafts, and educational departments.\nThe goal of the Center is to provide a comprehensive study of the history of Uzbekistan from ancient times to the modern period, with a focus on the region’s contribution to world civilization in the fields of science, culture, and spiritual heritage. Special attention is given to the scientific legacy of Uzbek scholars, the study of their works, as well as contemporary academic research and new discoveries.\nHistory\nThe Center was an initiative of the president of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev who envisaged it as  a vehicle to scientifically substantiate the greatness of Islamic civilization and portray Islam as a religion of \"goodness, peace and tolerance.\"\nMirziyoyev formally announced the establishment of the Center for Islamic Culture in June 2017. Later, he proposed renaming it the Center for Islamic Civilization.\nIn July 2021,  President Mirziyoyev hailed the Center as a scientific and educational instituion that would highlight Uzbekistan's role in the cultural heritage of the region. Among its missions would be to establish libraries and train guides and translators. The Center for Islamic Civilization will cooperate with UNESCO, ISESCO and other international organizations. The ICESCO Manuscripts Center will be housed at the Center. The center will have four thematic galleries focusing on Pre-Islamic Heritage, the First Renaissance (8th–13th centuries), the Second Renaissance (15th century) and Modern Uzbekistan.\nIn preparation for the opening, ancient manuscripts and objects directly related to the history and culture of Uzbekistan were purchased from antique dealers, private collectors and international auction houses such as Christie's and Sotheby's. In May 2025, a collection of Seljuk-era jewellery that was up for auction at Christie's was purchased by the center. The collection includes 35 handcrafted rings, earrings, bracelets, chains and clasps.\nAt the opening ceremony of the UNESCO General Conference, hosted by Uzbekistan in October 2025, Mirziyoyev invited other nations to collaborate in the work of the center \"to advance tolerance, enlightenment and interfaith harmony.\"\nIn September 2025, Paolo Zampolli, the United States special envoy for global partnerships visited the Center in Tashkent on his first official visit to Uzbekistan.\nIn November 2025, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, Ilham Aliyev, Sadyr Zhaparov, and Emomali Rahmon (leaders of Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan) joined Mirziyoyev in a visit to the Center.\nDesign and architecture\nOn September 1, 2017, Mirziyoyev visited the Khazrati Imam complex to view the site chosen for the project.   A plot of land of about 10 hectares was allocated next to the complex. Mirziyoyev personally laid the cornerstone on June 15, 2018. The length of the three-story building of the Islamic Civilization Center is 145 meters, the width is 115 meters. The height of the central dome is 65 meters. At least $161.8 million was allocated for the construction of the building. The construction was supposed to be completed by the beginning of 2024, but work on the project remains ongoing.\nThe first floor will house a research center, a data digitization and restoration laboratory, a storage fund for museum exhibits and rare manuscripts. A museum with an exhibition hall of about 15,000 square meters is planned for the second floor. Various exhibits of the cultural heritage of the Islamic world will be displayed in thematic order. A library housing 100,000 manuscripts and their digital copies will be located on the third floor.\nMuseum\nThe museum will  consist of five halls dedicated to the Quran, pre-Islamic civilization, Islamic Golden Age,Timurid Renaissance and modern history of Uzbekistan. Scholars involved in the establishment of the museum include Francois Deroche and Irina Popova. An interactive children’s museum at the center will feature “living portraits” of renowned scholars. Another wing will be dedicated to prominent women of the past.\nAdministration\nOn July 25, 2017, diplomat Shoazim Minovarov was appointed the first director of the Center for Islamic Civilization. On June 6, 2024, Firdavs Abdukhalikov, Chairman of the World Society for the Study, Preservation and Popularization of the Cultural Heritage of Uzbekistan, was appointed the new director of the Center.\nInternational partners\n* Wilmotte & Associés (France)\n* Trend Group (Italy)\n* Avesta Group\nProjects and exhibitions\nThe Samarkand Kufic Quran, one of the oldest manuscripts of the Islamic world, will be exhibited at the center alongside  114  Qur’ans, symbolic of the 114 surahs, dating from different periods. Each of the texts sheds light on the development of calligraphy and the spiritual culture of its time.\nThe center's first major international media project is a series of films narrated by Ben Kingsley.\nSee also\n*Hazrati Imam Complex\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKOzjzt_p2k Uzbekistan opens educational hub for children inside the Center of Islamic Civilization]"
