In political usage, war metaphors are used to manage a perceived societal problem, with the concept taking the place of an individual or state enemy in true war. The war metaphor is sometimes invoked to pursue ordinary domestic politics.\nPhilosopher James Childress describes the use of war as a metaphor as a dilemma: \"In debating social policy through the language of war, we often forget the moral reality of war.\" One fundamental problem is that it is often unclear when the \"war\" is over.\nExamples\nExamples of war used as a metaphor, often on the form \"War on...\" or \"War against...\":\n* \"Customs war\", also known as a \"toll war\" or \"tariff war\", a type of economic conflict between two or more states.\n* \"Trade war\"\n* \"War on crime\", 1930s, J.
