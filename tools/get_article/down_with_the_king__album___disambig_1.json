The album was produced by Run-DMC, Pete Rock, Q-Tip, EPMD, KayGee of Naughty by Nature, Jam Master Jay, the Bomb Squad, Daniel Shulman, Chyskills, Jermaine Dupri and Clifton \"Specialist\" Dillon.\nShowcasing their evolving style, this innovative album boasted invited guests, including reggae star Mad Cobra and Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello. The album features guest appearances from rappers Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth, Q-Tip, EPMD and Onyx. Down with the King was generally received more favorably by fans and critics than the group's previous album, Back from Hell.\nThanks to the title track, the album was certified Gold by the RIAA after only two months, July 20, 1993. Down with the King peaked at number 7 on the US Billboard 200, and number 1 on the Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart.\nThe album features three Billboard singles: \"Down with the King\", \"Ooh, Whatcha Gonna Do\" and \"Can I Get It, Yo\". The title track also hit the UK Singles Chart.\nThe album was reissued by Arista Records in 1999 and 2003.\nBackground\nWith the release of the new album, Run-DMC created a new look: All black Walker Wear outfits, black Timberlands and bald heads. DMC replaced traditional glasses with contact lenses and began to wear around his neck a large black wooden cross. Run started wearing sunglasses. Jay began to wear a designer ski hat by April Walker to cover his own bald head.\nThe album was recorded and mixed at 9 studios in New York City and at 1 studio in Atlanta (\"Can I Get A Witness\").\nCritical response\n| rev2       = Calgary Herald\n| rev2score  = B+\n| rev3       = ''Christgau's Consumer Guide\n| rev3score  = B+\n| rev4       = Entertainment Weekly\n| rev4score  = B\n| rev5       = Los Angeles Times\n| rev5score  =\n| rev6       = NME\n| rev6score  = 6/10\n| rev7       = Q\n| rev7score  =\n| rev8       = RapReviews\n| rev8score  = 7/10\n| rev9       = Rolling Stone\n| rev9score  =\n| rev10      = Select\n| rev10score = 3/5\n| rev11      = The Source''\n| rev11score = 3.5/5\n}}\nThe album received positive reviews. Jason Lymangrover from AllMusic said \"The new sound is decidedly more fashionable, and their fedoras and Adidas are abandoned here for bald heads and baggy black hoodies to match their new gangsta musical direction; which takes an obvious cue from Onyx (signed to Jam Master Jay's label), whose \"Slam\" was a platinum hit earlier in 1993.\"\nRolling Stone gave Down with the King three and a half stars out of five, saying \"...straight-faced and ultraconfident, funky and forthright...[the album has] the same infectious enthusiasm and the same in-your-face attitude as Run-D.M.C.'s raw earlier classics...\"\nEntertainment Weekly gave the album \"B\", saying \"...they still manage to sound young, lean, and hungry after 10 years in the rap game....\"\nGil Griffin from The Washington Post praised the album by saying:\n}}\nVideos\nTwo video clips were released on songs from the album: \"Down with the King\" and \"Ooh, Whatcha Gonna Do\". The video on the title track, which was directed by Marcus Raboy, many other rappers made cameos, including Eazy-E, Redman, Kris Kross, Jermaine Dupri, Onyx, Salt-N-Pepa, KRS-One, EPMD, A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, MC Lyte, Kid Capri, Das EFX, P.M. Dawn and Naughty by Nature. Onyx also appeared in the video for the song \"Ooh, Whatcha Gonna Do\". The video was produced by Drew Stone.\nTrack listing\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!#\n!Title\n!Featuring\n!Producer(s)\n!Samples\n!Length\n|-\n|1\n|\"Down with the King\"\n|Pete Rock & C.L.
