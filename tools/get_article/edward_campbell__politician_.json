The island was occupied by the Germans from 1 July 1940 until the surrender of the German forces on 9 May 1945. During this time, there was one election, held soon after the occupation began. The result installed Campbell as a puppet of the German administration, which was centered around the department of Manche, a French department in Normandy. He won 70% of the vote against Thomas Jenkins.\nThe election was unique in that only two candidates stood to represent the entire island. The post was abolished in 1942.\nReferences"
