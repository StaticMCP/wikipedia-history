'Ed' Clere''' (born April 16, 1974) is a Republican member of the Indiana House of Representatives, representing the 72nd District.\nIn 2015, Clere, concerned about the rapid spread of HIV in Scott County, Indiana, urged then-governor Mike Pence to sign an executive order to allow needle exchange programs to operate. After resisting the intervention for over two months, Pence spoke to the county sheriff, prayed for guidance, then capitulated, allowing such a program to address the epidemic. The rate of infection slowed dramatically.\nClere received the Chancellor's Medal from Indiana University Southeast in 2016.\nIn 2023, Clere ran for mayor of New Albany. He lost to Democratic incumbent, Jeff Gahan, 52%-48%.\nRep. Ed Clere and one other Republican representative joined all 28 Democrats present in voting against an Indiana bill to ban transgender healthcare for children.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://ballotpedia.org/Edward_Clere Ed Clere at Ballotpedia]\n*[http://www.in.gov/h72/ State Representative Edward Clere] official Indiana State Legislature site\n*"
