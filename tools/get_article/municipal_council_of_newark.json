The mayor is also elected for a term of four years.\nMunicipal elections in Newark are nonpartisan and are held on the second Tuesday in May. A council candidate seeking a post in a ward must receive more than 50 percent of the vote. If a candidate does not receive a majority, a run-off election is held with the two candidates with the greatest number of votes.\nCouncil members choose their own president and until 2014, when the position was eliminated, vice president.\nMembers\nAs of November 2025 council members were:\n*C. Lawrence Crump (Council President/Council Member-at-Large)\n*Amina Bey (Council Member-Elect, Central Ward)\n*Patrick O. Council (Council Member, South Ward)\n*Carlos M. Gonzalez (Council Member-at-Large)\n*Dupré L. Kelly (Council Member, West Ward)\n*Luis A. Quintana (Council Member-at-Large)\n*Anibal Ramos, Jr. (Council Member, North Ward)\n*Louise Scott-Rountree (Council Member-at-Large)\n*Michael J. Silva (Council Member, East Ward)\nMayor\nThe mayor may cast a tie-breaking vote on the municipal council when there is an equal number of yes and no votes. The Mayor can also call for meetings of the council outside those regularly scheduled.\nThe Newark mayoral election took place May 13, 2014 and was won by Ras Baraka.\nLuis A. Quintana had stepped down as Council President to be sworn in as mayor on November 4, 2013 following the resignation of Cory Booker, completing the term which ended June 30, 2014.\nBaraka also won the 2018 election and the 2022 election.\nCouncil members since 1954\nCouncil presidents\n*John A.
