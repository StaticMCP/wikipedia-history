It was the last large raid into the Grand Duchy. It was also the last large victory of the Great Hetman Konstanty Ostrogski before his death in 1530.\nIn 1524, İslâm I Giray, son of Mehmed I Giray, raided Poland–Lithuania and upon return started an open war for the throne with his uncle and new Khan Saadet I Giray. The parties reconciled in 1526 and the Khanate launched a large raid into Polesia of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (present-day northern Ukraine and southern Belarus) in December 1526. The Lithuanian-Ruthenian army, commanded by Konstanty Ostrogski, pursued the invaders and soundly defeated them at Olshanitsa (Ольшаниця), a village south of Kiev. Remaining Tatars were defeated by Ostap Dashkevych and Yuri Olelkovich near Kaniv and Cherkasy.\nAfter the battle, the GDL released Khan Sheikh Ahmed, the deposed Khan of the Golden Horde, who was imprisoned for more than twenty years. Sheikh Ahmed, an enemy of the Crimean Khanate, was used by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as a bargaining chip in negotiations against the Crimean Tatars. After these events both Saadet I Giray and İslâm I Giray sent letters to Sigismund I the Old of Poland–Lithuania offering peace and an alliance against the Grand Duchy of Moscow. The plans, however, were interrupted by renewed internal disagreements within the Crimean Khanate.\nThe battle was described by Justus Ludwik Decjusz in Sendbrief von der grossen Schlacht.\n}}"
