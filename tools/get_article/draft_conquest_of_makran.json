The campaign was directed against the tribal regions of Makran (modern-day southwestern Balochistan). The conquest is briefly recorded in Tārīkh-i-Tahīrī and other chronicles, which describe Sanghar’s march into the frontier and his subsequent victory over the local chiefs.\nBackground\nThe frontier region of Makran, located west of Sindh, was historically inhabited by a mixture of Baloch, Brahui, Pashtun, and remnant Arab tribes. By the 11th century, no centralized state ruled the territory; instead, power was divided among several chieftains. For the Soomras of Sindh, control of Makran was crucial to securing trade routes leading to the Persian Gulf and protecting Sindh’s western frontier.\nThe Conquest\nSultan Sanghar mobilized a large force, reported at around 50,000 cavalry, and marched westwards from Sindh. With no organized kingdom to oppose him, the Soomra army rapidly overran the tribal settlements of Makran.\nDespite initial resistance, the Baloch and Brahui tribes were subdued after several engagements. Pashtun clans and Arab enclaves in the coastal belt also resisted, but their irregular levies could not withstand the disciplined Soomra cavalry. Chronicles state that Sanghar’s forces captured key settlements, carried out punitive raids, and established Soomra authority across much of Makran.\nAftermath\nThe conquest allowed the Soomras to extend their influence westward into Balochistan. Sindh gained access to Makran’s ports and overland trade routes. However, Soomra control was never absolute, and the tribes continued to resist sporadically. During the reign of Sultan Umar I, Makran was raided by the Ghurids, weakening Soomra authority in the region.\nSee also\n* Soomra dynasty\n* History of Sindh\n* Makran\nReferences"
