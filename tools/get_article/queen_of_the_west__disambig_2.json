Boat Builders for the American West Steamboat Company for overnight river cruising on the Columbia & Snake Rivers within the United States.  She is currently owned and operated by American Cruise Lines.  The Queen of the West originally carried up to 167 passengers, but now carries 120 following her 2011 refurbishment for ACL.  The ship has 67 cabins spread over 4 decks.\nOn August 4, 2015, ACL announced that Queen of the West would be joined by her 150 passenger sister ship, American Pride, on the Columbia in early 2016.\nSee also\n*Tourist sternwheelers of Oregon\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.frommers.com/trip_ideas/cruise/smallshipsadventurecruises/americancruiselines/americanstar.html Mississippi Riverboat Cruises: Back in the Water for 2012]  from Frommer's\n* [http://www.americancruiselines.com/small-riverboat-cruise-ships/queen-of-the-west Official website]"
