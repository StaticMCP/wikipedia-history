PretSA was previously closely linked with African National Congress deputy president David Mabuza and highly influential in Mpumalanga politics. Rifts within the Mpumalanga ANC around the increasing influence of PretSA are believed to have contributed to Sancota's founding.\nSancota is supportive of the interests of traditional leaders, and has come out in support of abaThembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo, who was convicted of assault, arson, kidnapping and defeating the ends of justice, stating that \"it serves a bad precedent for a king to serve jail time\".\nThe party also believes that electricity utility Eskom should drop all of its debt to municipalities.\nSancota attracted support in the Bushbuckridge area, with at least one councillor defecting to the new party shortly after its formation.\nThe party contested the 2019 general election, failing to win any seats.\nNational elections\n|-\n!
