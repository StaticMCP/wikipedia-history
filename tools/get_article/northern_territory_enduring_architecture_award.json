The award recognises significant, long lasting and innovative architecture with usually more than 25 years passed since the completion of construction.\nBackground\nThe Award for Enduring Architecture recognises achievement for the design of buildings of outstanding merit, which have remained important as high quality works of architecture when considered in contemporary cultural, social, economic and environmental contexts in the Northern Territory. Nominations for the award can be made by AIA members, non–members and non–architects, but they must provide adequate material and information supporting the nomination for consideration of the jury.\nThe average age of the 10 projects recognised from 2013 to 2025 is 41.9 years from completion of construction to year of award.\nNational Award Winners\nRecipients of the state–based award are eligible for consideration of the National Award for Enduring Architecture presented later in the same year, as part of the Australian National Architecture Awards.\nOnly one project located in the Northern Territory has won the national award. In 2019 the Ayers Rock Resort\n(now Sails in the Desert) at Yulara by Philip Cox & Partners won both the local and national award, 35 years after the project was completed in 1984.\nList of award recipients\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" | Northern Territory Enduring Architecture Awards (reverse order)\n|-\n!
