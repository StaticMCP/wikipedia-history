In the , Laguna Quays had a population of 89 people.\nGeography\nThe Coral Sea forms the eastern boundary of the locality. Covering Beach is on the north-east coast ().\nThe northern part of the locality is used for the Laguna Quays Resort, some housing and the currently-closed Turtle Point Golf Course. Grazing is the predominant land use in the  north-west and south-west of the locality. The rest of the locality is undeveloped land.\nHistory\nIn 1992, the Laguna Quays resort opened as a luxury resort. It had cost $250 million. A 70-berth marina opened in 1993. However, in 1995, the resort went bankrupt owing around $200 million. By 2009, the Mackay Regional Council was owed over $2 million for rates. It auctioned parts of the precinct to attempt to recover the money. In 2013, Fullshare Holdings Group bought the resort announcing in 2015 they would refurbish and upgrade the facilities and dredge the marina.\nThe locality of Laguna Quays was officially named and bounded in September 1999.\nOn 27 July 2022, a  long crocodile was trapped and relocated after it was seen in a pond on the Turtle Bay golf course. Although the area is within the normal habitat range for crocodiles, its size and its proximity to people warranted its removal, noting that golf course ponds are attractive to crocodiles as a place of refuge, a source of food, and freshwater.\nIn 2023, the resort had not been redeveloped or reopene, so people with privately-owned land parcels in Laguna Quays formed the Laguna Quay Progress Association to repair and beautify their residential areas to stimulate sales of other blocks of land to form a thriving community.\nDemographics\nIn the , Laguna Quays had a population of 68 people.\nIn the , Laguna Quays had a population of 89 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Laguna Quays.
