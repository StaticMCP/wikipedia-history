He served from 1937 to 1968 as editor of its affiliate Destiny Publishers, which put out Destiny magazine (distinct from the magazine of the same name about Black culture).\nEarly life and career\nRand was born in Haverhill, Massachusetts in 1889. He was raised as a British Israelite, and his father introduced him to J. H. Allen's work ''Judah's Sceptre and Joseph's Birthright'' (1902) at an early age. He later graduated from the University of Maine with a bachelor's degree in law, becoming a successful lawyer but also worked as a construction worker and had other business interests.\nRand was also a prolific author of books on British Israelism, Bible studies, and pyramidology (most published by Destiny Publishers). Rand published The Bulletin, later renamed The Messenger of the Covenant. More recently it has been renamed Destiny and issued by Destiny Publishers.\nAnglo-Saxon Federation of America\nIn 1928, Rand began organizing for the London-based British-Israel World Federation. He eventually established his own British Israel organization, the Anglo-Saxon Federation of America, in Detroit in 1930. Prior to its foundation, Rand had met with prominent British Israelites such as William Pascoe Goard for advice and meetings. He later acquired C. A. L. Totten's book archive through the Totten Memorial Trust.\nInfluence on Christian Identity\nRand is considered the key transitional figure between British Israelism and Christian Identity, but he is not credited as the actual founder of the Christian Identity movement.\n}}\nExternal links\n* [https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/10/all-patriots-know-that-moses-wrote-the-constitution/65353/ \"All Patriots 'Know' That Moses Wrote the Constitution\" Atlantic Monthly OCT 29, 2010]"
