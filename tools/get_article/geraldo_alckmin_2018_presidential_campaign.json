Geraldo Alckmin was the 35th Governor of São Paulo from 2011 to his resignation in 2018. He had previously served as the 31st Governor, from 2001 to 2006. This is Alckmin's second bid for the presidency, his first being in 2006, when he lost to incumbent president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.\nAfter Manaus mayor Arthur Virgílio Neto dropped out as pre-candidate for president on 23 February 2018, Alckmin became the PSDB's presumptive nominee for president. He was officially nominated on 4 August 2018, with Progressive Party Senator Ana Amélia as his running mate. Alckmin's campaign has secured a coalition with eight parties: DEM, PP, PR, PRB, SD, PTB, PSD and PPS\nOn the first round of the election on 7 October 2018, Alckmin finished fourth in the race, receiving about 4.8% of the vote. This was the worst performance for a PSDB presidential nominee in history.\nProgram\nAs candidate, Alckmin has proposed a smaller government and reduction of taxes, and has defended the labor reform that took place in the administration of President Michel Temer.\nCandidates\nElection result\nPresidential elections\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! rowspan=2|Election year\n! rowspan=2|Candidate\n! colspan=2|First round\n! rowspan=2|Second round\n|-\n! # of overall votes\n! % of overall vote\n|-\n! 2018\n| Geraldo Alckmin\n| 5.096.341\n| 4.76%\n| Did not qualify\n|}\nReferences"
