King Pleasure first gained attention by singing the Eddie Jefferson vocalese classic \"Moody's Mood For Love\", based on a 1949 James Moody saxophone solo to \"I'm In The Mood For Love\". Pleasure's 1952 recording, his first after signing a contract with the Prestige label, is considered a jazz classic; the female vocalist featured is Blossom Dearie. He and Betty Carter also recorded a famous vocalese version of \"Red Top\", a jazz classic penned by Kansas Citian Ben Kynard and recorded by Gene Ammons and others. Other notable recordings include a presciently elegiac version of \"Parker's Mood\", the year before Charlie Parker died in 1955, and Pleasure's take on Ammons's \"Hittin' The Jug\", retitled as \"Swan Blues\" in 1962.\nPleasure has been cited as a significant influence by Van Morrison, especially on his album Astral Weeks. Genya Ravan, drawing big inspiration for her singing from King Pleasure, recorded \"Moody's Mood For Love\" with James Moody on her 1972 CBS album Genya Ravan.\nPleasure died on March 21, 1981.\nDiscography\n10-inch shellac (78rpm) and 7-inch vinyl (45rpm) releases\n*1952: \"Moody Mood For Love\" // \"Exclamation Blues\" (Prestige 924) – Merrill Stepter (trumpet); Lem Davis (alto sax); Ray Abrams (tenor sax); Cecil Payne (baritone sax); Teacho Wiltshire (piano); Leonard Gaskin (bass); Teddy Lee (drums); King Pleasure (vocals); Blossom Dearie (vocals) – NYC, February 19\n*1952:  \"Red Top\" // \"Jumpin' With Symphony Sid\" (Prestige 821) – Ed Lewis (trumpet); Charlie Ferguson (tenor sax); Ed Swanston (piano); Peck Morrison (bass); Herbie Lovelle (drums); King Pleasure (vocals); Betty Carter (vocals) – NYC, December 12\n*1953: \"[https://archive.org/details/78_sometimes-im-happy_king-pleasure-the-dave-lambert-singers-john-lewis-percy-heath-k_gbia0391921a Sometimes I'm Happy]\" // \"[https://archive.org/details/78_this-is-always_king-pleasure-the-dave-lambert-singers-john-lewis-percy-heath-kenny_gbia0391921b This Is Always]\" (Prestige 860) – John Lewis (piano); Percy Heath (bass); Kenny Clarke (drums); King Pleasure (vocals); Dave Lambert Singers (vocal trio) – NYC, September 29\n*1953: \"Parker's Mood\" // \"What Can I Say Dear (After I Say I'm Sorry)\" (Prestige 880) – John Lewis (piano); Percy Heath (bass); Kenny Clarke (drums); King Pleasure (vocals) – NYC, December 24\n*1954: \"I'm Gone\" // \"You're Crying\" (Prestige 908) – J.J.
