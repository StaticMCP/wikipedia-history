Voters chose four representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President. Delaware had gained one additional elector compared to the previous election in 1808.\nDelaware cast four electoral votes for the Democratic-Republican and Federalist supported candidate DeWitt Clinton over the regular Democratic-Republican candidate, incumbent President James Madison. These electors were elected by the Delaware General Assembly, the state legislature, rather than by popular vote. The four electoral votes for Vice president were cast for Clinton's running mate Jared Ingersoll from Pennsylvania.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1812 United States presidential election in Delaware\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#EA9978; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic Republican/Federalist\n| DeWitt Clinton\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | 4\n|-\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#008000; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic-Republican\n| James Madison (incumbent)\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | Totals\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | 4\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Delaware\nNotes\nReferences"
