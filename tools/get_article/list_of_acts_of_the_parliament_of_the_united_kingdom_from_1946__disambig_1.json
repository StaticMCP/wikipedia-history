For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3. c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\n9 & 10 Geo. 6\nContinuing the first session of the 38th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 1 August 1945 until 6 November 1946.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 9 & 10 G. 6.\nPublic general acts\n|  as respects the effect of Proclamations of Emergency under section one hundred and two of that Act.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  in respect of each of three years and for the apportionment of such sum among the counties and large burghs of Scotland.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n-\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  and to make further provision as to the instruments by which statutory powers to make orders, rules, regulations and other subordinate legislation are exercised.}}\n|  and to make further provision for the government of the territories heretofore known as the Straits Settlements.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  with respect to the qualifications of members of the Governor-General's Executive Council, to extend temporarily the powers of the Indian Legislature to make laws, to amend subsection (4) of section one hundred and two of the said Act as to the effect of laws passed by virtue of a Proclamation of Emergency, and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.|note4= }}\n-\n|  to make provision as to certain obligations arising out of or in connection with the war, to charge certain payments under the War Damage Act, 1943, on the Consolidated Fund, to provide for a temporary increase in the capital of the Civil Contingencies Fund, to amend the Defence Loans Act, 1937, and to increase the salary of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  in respect of matters arising out of hostilities or the communication of inventions and designs in accordance with agreements or arrangements with other countries.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n-\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and to restore all enactments and rules of law thereby affected.|note4= }}\n|  and to make further provision as to licensing planning committees under the said Act and sub-committees thereof.|note4= }}\n|  to amend Part II of the Housing (Agricultural Population) (Scotland) Act, 1938;
