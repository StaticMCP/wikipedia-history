Notable recipients include Egyptian writer Naguib Mahfouz, who received the award on his 92nd birthday, as well as Farouk Shousha, Sayyid Hijab, Ibrahim Aslan, Radwa Ashour, Sahar El Mougy, and Bahaa Taher.\nThe award is named after the Greek poet Constantine Cavafy, who was born in and lived in Alexandria, Egypt until his death.\nHistory\n]]\nIn 1983, unique cultural celebrations were held for the first time in the cities of Alexandria and Cairo, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the death of the Greek poet Constantine Cavafy, the poet of Alexandria. These events, known as \"Cavafyia,\" were aimed at developing cultural relations between Greece and Egypt by highlighting the works of this Greek poet who lived in Alexandria from birth until his death and created all his works in the city he adored. The idea was supported by the Greek Minister of Culture, Melina Mercouri, and originated with Panayotis Vassilopoulos, the Greek Consul in Alexandria at the time. These celebrations quickly became one of the most important cultural events in Egypt.\nAward winners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Cavafy Award winners\n!Year\n!Country\n!Winner\n!Ref.\n|-\n|1989\n| Egypt\n|Ahmed Abdel Moati Hijazi\n|\n|-\n|1991\n| Egypt\n|Farouk Shousha\n|\n|-\n|2004\n| Egypt\n|Naguib Mahfouz\n|\n|-\n|2013\n| Egypt\nUAE\n|Maysoun Saqr (poet) and Mohamed El-Mansi Qandil (novelist)\n|\n|-\n|2017\n| Egypt\n|Farouk Gouida (poet), Radwa Ashour (novelist), and Sahar El Mougy (novelist)\n|\n|-\n|2011\n| Egypt\n|Amin Haddad, Ahdaf Soueif, and Bashir El-Sebaei\n|\n|-\n|2014\n| UAE\n|Maysoun Al Qasimi\n|\n|-\n|2017\n| Egypt\n|Sonallah Ibrahim and Mohamed El-Shahawi (poet)\n|\n|-\n|2019\n| Egypt\n|Ahmed Bakheet (Poetry), Youssef Noufel (Literary Criticism), and E'tidal Othman (Prose)\n|\n|}\nReferences"
