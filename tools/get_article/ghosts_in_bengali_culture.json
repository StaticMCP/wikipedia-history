Bengali folktales and Bengali cultural identity are intertwined in such a way that ghosts depicted reflect the culture it sets in. Fairy tales, both old and new, often use the concept of ghosts.\nReferences to ghosts are often found in modern-day Bengali literature, cinema, radio and television media. There are also alleged haunted sites in the region. The common word for ghosts in Bengali is bhoot or bhut (), which comes from the Sanskrit word bhūta (भूत), meaning 'past' or 'something that has passed'. Also, the word Pret (derived from Sanskrit 'Preta') is used in Bengali to mean ghost. The word generally refers to the spirit of a deceased person, or entity that has passed on.\nAmong Bengali Muslims, supernatural entities are largely recognised as Jinn, or jinn bhoot () (derived from Arabic 'Djinn'). In Bengal, ghosts are believed to be the unsatisfied spirits or rūḥ of human beings who cannot find peace after death or the souls of people who died in unnatural or abnormal circumstances like murders, suicides or accidents.\nTypes of ghosts and other supernatural entities\nThere are many kinds of ghosts and supernatural entities that frequently come up in Bengali culture and folklore. Ghosts have been important in the socio-cultural beliefs, superstitions and popular entertainment of the Bengali people. A few of these supernatural entities are mentioned here.\nJinn / Djinn\nMost often believed by the Muslim community of Bengal, the Jinn are supernatural beings that are generally considered invisible and capable of affecting living beings with their actions. An important aspect of Jinn is that they are seen, as humans, to be accountable for their deeds in the eyes of God. Jinn are not necessarily good or bad, but are seen as intelligent and subtle beings. They have free will, and a Muslim may acknowledge when a jinn is influencing their life. Some may attribute circumstances in their lives to Jinn interference and in some rural areas, this may be where shamanistic rituals may be employed to ward them off (talismans, prayers, etc.). Some Jinn like to shapeshift and appear as snakes or humans, and may become malevolent if disturbed or harmed by a human. Some Jinns can haunt human residences, toilets, lakes, graveyards, morgues, hospitals and even the wilderness.\nBoba Jinn\nSleep paralysis is often attributed in Bengali lore to a supernatural entity called the Jinn of \"Boba\" () (meaning muteness) or \"Boba Jinn\" (). This entity tries to strangle the victim in their sleep. The victims report themselves being unable to speak or move and often see the fearsome entity sitting over their chest as it strangles them. In Bangladesh, the phenomenon is called Bobaay Dhora (being struck by Boba).\nPari / Pori\n]]\nIn Bangladeshi folklore, pori (also spelled parī) refers to a supernatural entity, similar to a fairy, often depicted as a beautiful, winged creature with a connection to Islamic/Persian mythology. They are known for their ethereal beauty and association with the unseen realm, sometimes interacting with humans, both positively and negatively.\nMamdo\nMamdo or Mamdo Bhoot () are ghosts of Bengali Muslims who died unnatural deaths. The word Mamdo (), came from the word \"mohammadiyah\" (), which means \"followers of Muhammad\".\nThis name may have stemmed from the fact that Mamdo Bhoot's were thought to be the spirits of Muslims that had become spectral or ghost-like.\nPetni\nPetni is what a Churel is called in Bengal. This is a spirit that is typically described as 'the ghost of an unpurified living thing', and is often known to inhabit trees. The Churel is closely related to the lore of Petni and Shakchunni, other popular female supernatural entities in Bengali folk tales. In some Hindu beliefs, these spirits may become dakinis and serve the goddess Kali. In some areas of Bengal, a Petni is the ghost of a woman who died during childbirth or pregnancy. Some Petni's would come about if a woman died during her menstruation. The Petni may appear as a woman with distorted or monstrous features (blackened tongue, claw hands, large fangs, and wild hair), and her feet turned backwards (a common trait of South-Asian supernatural entities), or she may be a shapeshifter to lure humans towards her.\nAleya\nAleya is the name given to a strange phenomenon of light that happens near the marshes (similar to the will-o'-the-wisp), especially reported by the fishermen of West Bengal and Bangladesh. These so-called marsh lights often look like levitating orbs of fire that glow, which confuse fishermen, lure them in the water and drown them. Like the Nishi or the western idea of a siren, their voice is irresistible. Local people believe that these are the ghosts of fisherman who died whilst fishing. The fishermen of Sundarban delta region, especially the Khasti and Manna fishermen communities, strongly believe in these and always do an Atoshi-taron ritual before they go fishing.\nNishi Dak\nIn Bengali, nishi means 'night' or 'darkness' (নিশি), and dak means 'call' (ডাক). This refers to a spirit that calls out to humans in the middle of the night, or in the dark, but in a familiar voice. The nishi dak will prey on those who are alone, and use familiar voices to lure their victims to a secluded area before revealing themselves and killing their victims. Legend says that if one hears the voice of their loved one call out to them once or twice, it is Nishi trying to trick them into answering her call, which gives her the ability to consume the answering person's soul. If the call is heard for a third time, it is safe to answer since Nishi only calls out to a person twice.\nMechho Bhoot\nThe Mechho Bhoot is a famous spirit in Bengali folklore. Its name comes from the word “machh,” (Bengali: মাছ), meaning fish. These spirits live near village ponds or lakes, drawn to their love for fish. They can be playful, but they can also be dangerous. Fishing is very important to agriculture and economy in Bangladesh, as it is a riverine country with a variety of fish in the waters. According to folklore, those who suffer a death in the waters while fishing turn into Mechho Bhoots.\nBegho Bhoot\nThe word Begho comes from the Bengali word meaning 'tiger'(বাঘ). A Begho Bhoot is the ghost of people who were killed or eaten by the tigers in the Sundarbans, which is also a sanctuary for the Royal Bengal Tiger in the Bengal region. These spirits and their characteristics may relate to the folklore of Dakshin Rai, a deity of the Sundarbans who ruled over beasts and demons, who sometimes appeared as a tiger.\nLocal folktale suggests that these apparitions frighten people who enters the jungle and lead them to tiger lairs. They are also said to make the noise of a tiger roar in order to scare villagers. Begho Bhoot is symbolic of the hardships of poor, working class people who often fall victim to their livelihoods.\nman from a group of Bhoot (ghosts), while the man was cutting a branch from the yonder banyan tree or Ashwattha tree.

Taken from the 1912 illustrated edition of Folk-Tales of Bengal by Lal Behari Dey.]]\nBesho Bhoot\nThe word Besho comes from the word Baash'' which means 'Bamboo' in Bengali. It was believed that these harmful ghosts, called the Besho Bhoot, lived within bamboo gardens, and walking past these areas after dusk was considered dangerous. Another superstition states that if a bamboo plant is leaning or laying on the ground, no one should cross over it and should instead go around it, in fear that the bamboo would rise up unexpectedly by the spirit, and the person would die impaled by it. Strange weather phenomenons, such as gusty winds, were said to occur within the bamboo gardens whilst the weather elsewhere was fine.\nShakchunni\nThe word Shakchunni comes from the Sanskrit word Shankhachurni. It is usually described as the spirit of a married woman, wearing a special kind of traditional bangles made of shells (called ‘Shakha Pola'/'শাখা পলা’ in Bengali) around their arms, which is a sign of married Hindu women in Bengal. In Bangladeshi folklore (and sometimes India), Shakchunnis are different from Petnis, the former are said to live on top of trees and attack people who may disturb them. They are also imagined as invincible, able to be banished only through shamanistic rituals.\nMost local folklores in West Bengal and India depict her as a young woman who entered matrimony with a prosperous individual. Regrettably, her marital union proved to be marked by cruelty and abuse inflicted upon her by her husband, ultimately culminating in her untimely demise. In these folklores Shakchunnis return as ghostly apparitions intending to take revenge on their erstwhile husbands.\nGiven her distressing experiences within her own marital life, she harbors an intense longing for a harmonious companionship. Consequently, she targets contentedly married women, subjugating and usurping their identities to perpetuate an illusion of matrimonial bliss on behalf of her victims.\nIn local folklores, Shakchunni is depicted as the exact opposite of traditional submissive Bengali women. They are depicted as evil, revenge-seeking, scary entities with pointy ears. Researchers of local folklores call this a subtle patriarchal message that women who deviate from a set societal expectations are as abhorrent as Shakchunni.\nPishachas\nPishachas are flesh-eating demons in Indian religious lore. They dwell in the dark and often haunt cremation grounds. They are also described as having shapeshifting abilities and invisibility. They are said to be able to possess human beings.\nRakkhosh\nRakkhosh is the Bengali form of the word Rakshasa, from Hindu mythology. They are demonic beings known for having a malevolent nature, ability to shapeshift, and other supernatural abilities. They are depicted as having thick fangs and sharp claws, their appearance varying depending on the story. They are prominently featured in the Hindu epics of Ramayana and Mahabharata, which establishes their creation myth of being created from Brahma's breath and then banished to Earth by the god Vishnu. Many fairytales from Bengal speak of these creatures, describing them as vicious beings who feed on humans. A common call of the rakkhosh in traditional Bengali folk-tales is this couplet: Hau, Mau, Khau,... manusher gondho pau(Bengali:হাঁউ মাঁউ খাঁউ,... মানুষের গন্ধ পাঁউ) The first three are gibberish words describing the opening of the mouth and the intention to devour, whilst the second phrase means \"I smell humans\". This is comparable to the \"fi fie foe...\" phrase associated with giants.\nDaitya (Doitto)\nThe Daitya (or Doitto) (Sanskrit: दैत्य) look human, but possess extraordinary size and strength. They are similar to the giants.\nBrahmodaitya\nA Brahmodaitya is the ghost of a holy Brahmin, or the spirit of a priest and scholar from the highest Hindu caste. Depending on the story, these spirits may appear benevolent or malevolent. Many Bengali folktales and movies portray them as being very kind and helpful to the living.\nBrahmodaitya reflects the rigid and discriminatory nature of caste hierarchies followed in the past. Socio-political experts point out the fact that most other ghosts in local folklores of Bengal are depicted as dark-skinned while Brahmodaitya is depicted as fair skinned and benevolent.\nDamori\nTantric practices and black magic have been very popular in rural Bengal for centuries. Rural people from Bengal, obsessed with the occult, used to travel to the Kamrup-Kamakhya in Assam in order to learn the tantric ways and black magic. Many Sadhu (Ascetic Yogis), Tantric, Aghori, Kapalik and Kabiraj even devoted their lives to the pursuit of occult practices. Such people are said to have the power to invoke lower-level demonic entities such as Hakini, Shakhini (same as Shakchunni) and Dakini. Tantriks use these spirits either for divination or in order to inflict harm on others, with townspeople often seeking them in order to aid them in harming others. The most common practice was called \"Baan Mara\", a ritual used to kill the victim by inducing blood vomit. The two highest-level tantric mantra are the Kularnob and the Moha Damor, who included a lower level mantra named Bhoot Damor who referred to many different demi-goddesses. Damori is a name that refers to those supernatural entities conjured by the tantriks. In Tantra philosophy, if someone were to engage in ascetic pursuit and worship through the Bhoot Damor, the invoked Damori would appear to them and serve them. These beings are neither human nor ghostly, but exist in an in-between state, inhabitants of an unseen realm. They share similarities with the western concept of Fairies; or the Islamic/Persian concept of Pori / Pari.\nVetalas\nVetalas are a class of ghouls in Hindu mythology who are usually described as being knowledgeable paranormal entities that dwell in charnel grounds. They are characterized as evil spirits who haunt cemeteries and take possession of corpses as vehicles for movement. Vetalas are hostile spirits, but can be seen to protect or help humans in some folk tales.\nVetala may also link to Vetal or Betal as a Bhairava form of Shiva, a popular god in Goa.\nOne of the most well known pieces of fiction related to vetalas is the Vetala Panchavimshati, a collection of twenty-five stories part of the Kathasaritsagara, featuring a vetala as one of the two main characters. The story focuses on King Vikramaditya who is asked to capture a corpse hanging from a tree that stands in the middle of a cremation ground. This corpse is possessed by a vetala, who proposes to tell a king a story. Once the vetala finishes the story, it would ask the king a question that the king would have to answer. After the answer, the vetala would return to the corpse in the tree. This occurs another twenty-four times, after which the king is unable to answer the question. Impressed by the king, the vetala informs of the evil designs of the sorcerer that sent Vikramaditya to the cremation grounds. The vetala grants him a gift that would allow him to gain powers and defeat this sorcerer.\nJokkho / Jokkh\nJokkho / Jokkh are warrior-like entities who usually guard treasures in the earth. They are considered to be benevolent, able to bestow fertility and wealth upon their devotees. There is a commonly used Bengali idiom - Jokkher Dhon (literal meaning: Jokkho's Wealth) which means \"protecting a beloved person\" or \"safeguarding precious wealth\".\nShaytan\nShaytan/Shoytan () is the Bengali word for \"Satan\" or \"devil\". It is a common term used in Bengali to refer to the evil entity or force in various religious and cultural contexts.  In Islam, Shayateen (plural of Shaytan) refers to devils, which can be both Jinn and humans who are evil and actively work to misguide others. They are essentially the opposite of good and righteous beings, constantly trying to lead people away from the path of Allah.\nIn festivals\n]]\nBhoot Chaturdashi\nThe 14th day of the Krishna Paksha (waning phase of the moon) which is also the night before Kali Puja and the second day of Dipaboli is celebrated as Bhoot Chaturdashi (translation, the fourteenth of ghosts) by Bengali Hindus. On this night, 14 earthen-lamps (choddo prodip) are lit at homes to appease the spirits of the past 14 generations of ancestors. It is believed that on the night before Kali Puja, the spirits of these ancestors descend upon the earth, and these lamps help them find their way home. Another popular belief is that Chamunda (a fearsome aspect of Kali) along with 14 other ghostly forms ward off the evil spirits from the house as 14 earthen-lamps are lit at different entrances and in the dark corners of the rooms. It is customary to consume a dish of 14 types of leafy vegetables (choddo shaak) during Bhoot Chaturdashi so that evil spirits are unable to possess the body.\nAlleged haunted places\nBangladesh\nAccording to stories, Lalbagh Fort, Golf Heights Banani, Airport Road; Chalan Beel in Sirajganj, Pakri Beach, Mirsarai Highway Crossing in Chittagong and many other places in Bangladesh are claimed to be haunted.\n* Airport Road, Dhaka is associated with the legend of a White Lady ghost supposedly seen by drivers.\n* Dhaka Golf Heights, Banani, Dhaka: Claims include feelings of fear while walking past grave sites at night.\n* Under-construction apartment in Old DOHS, Banani, Dhaka: One group of ghost hunters claim to have seen devil-worshipping signs written on walls at construction sites in Old DOHS Banani.\n* Shahidullah Hall Pond, Dhaka: According to campus rumor, the pond adjoining Shahidullah Hall at Dhaka University campus is believed to be haunted.\n* Farmhouse in Narsingdi: According to one local ghost hunting group, the house is haunted by the figure of a woman with climbing a tree.\n* Farmhouse in Comilla: According to one ghost hunting group, a farmhouse in Comilla is reported to be haunted.\nWest Bengal, India\n* National Library of Kolkata\n* Nimtala crematorium, Kolkata: According to legend, this site in central Kolkata is haunted by the ghosts of those who were cremated there.\n* Putulbari or the House of Dolls, Kolkata: According to believers, the site is haunted by the souls of the dead.\n* Hastings House, Alipore, Kolkata: According to legend, students have seen ghosts on the grounds.\n* '''Writers' Building, Kolkata: According to legend, this residence of junior servants and administrative staff is haunted.\n* Mullick Ghat and Zanana Bathing Ghat The Ganges - Under Howrah Bridge, Kolkata''': Believers claim that many spirits wander the sacred river.\nIn popular culture\nGhosts, other similar supernatural entities, as well as tales of paranormal powers (such as clairvoyance, psychic phenomenon etc.) are plots for many short stories and novels in modern-day Bengali literature. Some classic literature and folk-lore are also based on such plots. The number of Bengali films of this genre are small in number compared to the western world. Multiple radio and TV programs also feature stories of people's paranormal experiences. Common people of both Bangladesh and West Bengal love the supernatural thrills, and the personal stories of people's paranormal experiences are hot topics for gossip, rumours and hangout discussions among friends and family.\nLiterature\nLiterary works involving ghostly/demonic beings is one of the most popular genres in Bengali literature. In the early days, ghosts were the only ingredients of Bengali folk-tales and fairy-tales. Lal Behari Dey  collected many folk-tales of Bengal, and translated them in English. His book called Folk-Tales of Bengal, first published in 1883, features many amazing folk-tales associated with ghostly and supernatural beings.\nThakurmar Jhuli is the most classic collection of Bengali children's folk-tales and fairy-tales, which was compiled by Dakshinaranjan Mitra Majumder in 1907. There we can find many different categories of supernatural entities (such as Rakkhosh) featuring in different stories. Other such story collection from the same author are Thakurdadar Jhuli (1909), Thandidir Tholay (1909) and, Dadamoshayer Tholay (1913).\nMany Bengali writers have practiced the genre of supernatural/horror in their short stories, novels, and others forms of literary works.

Each time the king tries to capture the Betaal, it tells a story that ends with a riddle. If the king cannot answer the question correctly, the phantom consents to remain in captivity. If the king knows the answer but still keeps quiet, then his head shall burst into thousand pieces. And if King Vikram answers the question correctly, the phantom would escape and return to his tree.

However, at the present day, some young Bengali horror story writers are being somewhat influenced by the western horror literature, and their writings thus lack the originality of the classic Bengali horror literature and ghost stories.\nCinema\nClassic Bengali films with horror/supernatural plot are only a handful.

The film with its simple but humorous story went on to become a massive blockbuster of 2012.\nGoynar Baksho (2013) is another popular film involving the supernatural. The film, directed by Aparna Sen, is an adaptation of Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay's tale of 3 generations of women & their changing position in society as seen in relation to a box of jewels, handed down from one generation to the next.\nChhayamoy (2013) is another notable horror movie based on Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay's novel of the same name. The story is about Indrajit, a UK based scholar. While working to preserve historical documents he find a parchment from which he learns about treasures hidden in an old palace in Simulgarh, a village of West Bengal. Indrajit comes to the village, finds out the treasure, but, a local goon Gagan Sapui accuses him of robbery, beats him up and expels him out of the village.
