It instead generally favours regional decentralization including political and fiscal autonomy for Alsace, promoting the defense of its culture, history, traditions, and bilingualism of the Alsatian language. A slogan that has sometimes occurred in protests in the 21st century is \"Elsass frei\" (\"Alsace free\").\nSeveral mass protests have taken place in public places around Alsace in opposition to the French region of Grand Est, with ratification on 1 January 2016. In addition, several Alsatian organisations and political parties have been formed to promote the cause, notably Alsace d'abord and Unser Land.\nThe movement of greater autonomy of Alsace runs partly parallel to that of Alemannic separatism, originating in the Napoleonic era (–1815) and briefly revived both after World War I (1919) and after World War II (1946–1952).\nHistory\n.]]\nas an Upper Rhine German or Alemannic dialect in the 19th and 20th century.]]\nBackground\nThe expansionist doctrines of France since the time of Louis XIV has caused Alsatians to be subject to many shifts in European history.\nOver the centuries, many figures and organisations have contributed to the cause of rejected either or both of these pretentions, promoting varying degrees of autonomy or even independence, both in public and in form of political participation.\nVarious autonomist and separatist movements in Alsace have received support from over the political spectrum, including left, centre and right despite the diverse political ideologies.\n19th century\n*Alsatian Workers and Peasants Party\nWorld War II\nThe establishment of Nazi Germany and the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine during the World War II, introduced a new situation for many Alsatians, including hardships for many, such as the malgré-nous. However, some advocates of autonomy for Alsace saw the new regime as a chance to re-enacted rights for the culture and autonomy of the Alsatians formerly under French government. While few were actually attracted to the antisemitism or authoritarianism of the regime, a number of Alsatian autonomists were subsequently accused of collaboration with Nazi officials after the war, some of which were trialed, prisoned or even executed.\n*:fr:Fritz Spieser (1902–1987)\n* :de:Paul Schall (1898–1981)\n* Joseph Bilger (1905–1975)\n* :fr:Marcel Stürmel (1900–1972)\n*:fr:Camille Dahlet (1883–1963)\n*Joseph Rossé (1892–1951)\n*Jean-Pierre Mourer (1897–1947)\n*Charles Hueber (1883–1943)\n*:fr:Charles Roos (1878–1940)\n*Eugène Ricklin (1862–1935)\nAfter war, also related groups :fr:Nanziger and :fr:Loups Noirs remained notable.\nHowever, other Alsatians were staunch opponents of the Nazi occupation such as the artist Jean-Jacques Waltz.\nAfter reattachment to France\n.]]\nIn contemporary Alsace, Unser Land, formed in 2009 after the merger of Union du peuple alsacien and Fer's Elsass, constitutes the most notable current political party associated with promotion of greater autonomy of Alsace.
