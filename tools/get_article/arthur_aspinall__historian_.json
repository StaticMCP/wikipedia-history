Here, he authored a book on Lord Cornwallis's career in India, Cornwallis in Bengal.\nHis first book, Lord Brougham and the Whig Party (1927), grew out of his doctoral thesis. It was praised as \"thorough and masterly in treatment\" by Lucy M. Brown and I. R. Christie.\nIn 1931 Aspinall became lecturer of history at Reading University and in 1947 he succeeded Frank Stenton to become professor of modern history. He was then professor of history from 1963 until his retirement in 1965. He edited the correspondence of George III and George IV: according to The Times, these volumes \"stand as a permanent memorial to his astonishing industry and meticulous scholarship\".\nPersonal life\nAspinall was married to Gladys Shaw from 1931 until her death in 1965. In 1968 he married Beryl Johnson.\nAssessment\nAfter his death, The Times said:\nAspinall was an exact scholar, with an unrivalled knowledge of the primary source materials for his period, the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries of British political history. He developed his academic life to the publication of impeccable edited texts of the major correspondence of the period, so that every historian working that field, now and in the future, will be heavily in his debt.\nIn his biography of George IV, E. A. Smith said: \"My principal academic debt must be to the late Arthur Aspinall...who gave me endless encouragement. ... Doubtless he would have disapproved of some of my ideas about George IV but, such as it is, I offer my present work as a small tribute to his memory\".\nWorks\n*Lord Brougham and the Whig Party (1927).\n*Cornwallis in Bengal (1931).\n*''The Formation of Canning's Ministry, February to August, 1827 (1937).\n*(editor), The Letters of King George IV, 1812–30 (1938).\n*(editor), The Correspondence of Charles Arbuthnot (1941)\n*(editor), Diary of Henry Hobhouse, 1820–47 (1947).\n*Politics and the Press, 1780–1850 (1947).\n*The Early English Trade Unions (1949).\n*(editor), Mrs. Jordan and her family: being the unpublished correspondence of Mrs. Jordan and the Duke of Clarence, later William IV (1951).\n*(editor), Three Early Nineteenth Century Diaries (1952).\n*(editor), The Letters of King George IV with The Later Correspondence of George III (five volumes, 1962–70).\n*(editor), The Correspondence of George, Prince of Wales, 1770–1810'' (eight volumes, 1963–71).\nNotes"
