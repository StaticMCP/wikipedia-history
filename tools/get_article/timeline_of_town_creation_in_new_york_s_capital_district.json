The Capital District is an 11 county area, which consists of the counties of Albany, Schenectady, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schoharie, Warren, Washington, Columbia, Montgomery, Fulton, and Greene. New York experimented with different types of municipalities before settling upon the current format of towns and cities occupying all the land in a county. Districts were created for Albany and Tryon counties in 1772; all were transformed into towns (or divided into multiple towns) in 1788 when all of the state of New York was divided into towns. Two years before that, in 1786, all of what Washington County encompassed at that time was divided into townships with the same legal status, abilities, and responsibilities as districts with their status as towns confirmed in 1788.-1896[A]|boxstyle_Manor=background-color: #cef2e0|boxstyle_Watervliet=background-color: #cef2e0}}\n|boxstyle_Cohoes =background-color: #cef2e0}}\n[A]|boxstyle_Colonie =background-color: #cef2e0}}\n[A]|East=Clinton1855[D](EastGreenbushin 1858)|boxstyle_Watervliet=background-color: #cef2e0|boxstyle_East=background-color: #fffacd}}\n[D]|boxstyle_Greenbush=background-color: #fffacd|boxstyle_Rensselaer=background-color: #fffacd}}\n[C]|boxstyle_Pittstown =background-color: #faf6ed}}\nNotes\nSchoharie and Greene counties, with Duanesburgh (Schenectady County)\n1787-1788[9]|Woodstock=Woodstock1788[9]|Hurley=Hurleytownship[9]1708-1788|Windham=Windham1798[10]|Hunter=Greenland1813[F](Hunter in 1814)|boxstyle_Hunter=background-color: #ABCDEF}}\n-1772 |Duanesburg=Duanesburg1789[D] |Conesville=Conesville1836[8]|boxstyle_Duanesburg=background-color: #faf5ff|boxstyle_Duanesburgh =background-color: #cef2e0|boxstyle_Conesville=background-color: #99cccc}}\n-1772 |Blenheim=Blenheim 1797[G] |Jefferson=Jefferson1803[G]|boxstyle_Schoharie=background-color: #cef2e0|boxstyle_Blenheim=background-color: #9acd32|boxstyle_Jefferson=background-color: #9acd32}}\nNotes\n[2] = A part of Albany County until 1798, then part of Ulster County until 1800 when Greene County was formed.\n[9] = A part of Ulster County.\n[10] = A part of Ulster County until 1800 when Greene County was formed.\nSchenectady County, except Niskayuna and Duanesburgh\n]]\nNotes\nSaratoga County, and Easton (Washington County)\n[C]|boxstyle_Spatown=background-color: #FFB6C1|boxstyle_Spacity =background-color: #FFB6C1}}\n[C]|boxstyle_Halfmoon=background-color: #cef2e0|boxstyle_Mechanicville=background-color: #FFB6C1}}\nNotes\nWashington County, except Easton\nNotes\nWarren County\n1792-1813|Johnsburg=Johnsburg1805[3]|boxstyle_Patent=background-color: #d2b48c|boxstyle_Township=background-color: #cd7f32|boxstyle_Thurman=background-color: #cd7f32}}\n)|Athol=Athol[4]1813-1852|Thurman=Thurman1852[4]}}\nNotes\n[3] = A part of Washington County until 1813 when Warren County was formed.\n[4] = A part of Warren County.\nColumbia County\n(East Camp)District[A]1775-1788|Germantown=Germantown1788[B]|boxstyle_Camp =background-color: #F7E7CE|boxstyle_Germantown =background-color: #FFCC99}}\nNotes\nFulton, Montgomery, and Hamilton counties, with part of Herkimer County\nSee also\n*List of incorporated places in New York's Capital District\n*Toponymies of places in New York's Capital District\n*Administrative divisions of New York\n*List of cities in New York\n*List of towns in New York\n*List of villages in New York\n*Timeline of town creation in Downstate New York\n*Timeline of town creation in the Hudson Valley\n*Timeline of town creation in Central New York\n*Timeline of town creation in New York's North Country\nNotes\n*a.  Though many sources put Pittstown as incorporated as a township by patent on July 23, 1721 no law can be found incorporating it as such.&nbsp; When Albany County was divided into districts Pittstown is not mentioned, though the land it currently occupies was included in Schaghticoke; if Pittstown had been a municipality it ceased to be so in 1772 (or earlier); the current town of Pittstown was formed in 1788.\nReferences\n*[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_R_zHwh4xByQC  Gazetteer of the State of New York] By John H.
