Referring to the construction as the First State Program on the Great Return to the Territories of the Republic of Azerbaijan Liberated from Occupation (), or simply Great Return (), Azerbaijan began rebuilding and resetting the Nagorno-Karabakh region with Azerbaijanis. The unrecognized Republic of Artsakh controlled the area from 1991 to 2023 and it was inhabited by 150,000 people who were primarily ethnic Armenians until the flight of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians following Azerbaijani reconquest of the region. The first phase of the program is from 2022 to 2026. It covers the Karabakh Economic Region and East Zangezur Economic Region.\nBackground\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the First Nagorno-Karabakh War took place from 1988 to 1994, in which the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast of Azerbaijan, which had a primarily Armenian population, unilaterally declared independence from Azerbaijan as the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh (later renamed Republic of Artsakh), supported by Armenia. The Azerbaijani population was forced to flee; according to the Azerbaijani government at the time of the ceasefire in 1994 there were about 250,000 refugees in Azerbaijan from the war.\nAzerbaijan recovered many of its territories during and after the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War, which culminated by the ceasefire deal on 9 November 2020. The ceasefire allowed rehabilitation to begin in places where Azerbaijan re-established authority, many of which had been practically leveled since Azerbaijan lost control of them in the 1990s.\nThe region was fully recaptured by Azerbaijan in the 2023 Azerbaijani offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh. This resulted in a flight of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians, in which nearly the entire population of Nagorno-Karabakh fled the region for neighboring countries, primarily Armenia.\nProgram\nOn 16 November 2022, the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev approved the First State Program on the Great Return to the Territories of the Republic of Azerbaijan Liberated from Occupation, for a duration lasting from 2022 to 2026.\nAt the 11th Session of the World Urban Forum, President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev claimed that huge mine pollution is the main challenge, which slowing down reconstruction and return of internally displaced individuals.\nAs of May 2025, 13,745 internally displaced persons in Azerbaijan have settled in the region under the program. Azerbaijan aims to settle 150,000 people in the region by 2027.\nBy city\nAgdam\nOn 20 November 2020, the city of Aghdam and its surrounding district were returned to Azerbaijan as part of the ceasefire agreement. Plans were announced to construct a 44.5-kilometer-long highway linking Agdam to the city of Barda. On 28 May 2021, President Aliyev laid the foundation stone for the project.\nFuzuli\nOn 16 November 2020, the foundation stone for the construction of a highway linking the cities of Fuzuli and Shusha was laid. The highway was planned to integrate into a wider scheme to construct a highway to the municipality of Ahmadbeyli. Plans indicate that the road would be 101.5&nbsp;km in length and 37.7m wide.\nOn 26 October 2021, Fuzuli International Airport was inaugurated.

Some former Azerbaijani residents of the city also expressed discontent with the demolition of buildings due to them wanting to return to their homes as well as due to their opinions not being taken into consideration. Among the buildings being demolished were those constructed by the Armenian authorities while they controlled the city, including a new parliament building, apparently in order to make room for the construction of a mosque.\nIn January 2021, plans were announced for the construction of a five-star hotel in the city of Shusha.

Azerbaijan allocated US$1.3 billion from the budget for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of these lands. These funds will apparently be utilized to rehabilitate infrastructure, education, and healthcare sectors, as well as cultural and historical landmarks. Reconstruction is projected to continue in the future years, with specific financial provisions continuing to be made for demining, reconstructing, and resettling.\nControversies\nAzerbaijan's \"Great Return\" program has been characterized as ahistorical and expansionist by international critics and as a nationalist distraction by domestic critics. Other critics point out that the program does not offer the right of return to former ethnic Armenians who fled their homes in 2023.\nVarious Armenian cultural monuments in the captured areas have been partially or entirely destroyed during the reconstruction process, including Armenian cemeteries and homes bulldozed in the process of road construction, as well as an 18th/19th century Armenian church. The restoration of Ghazanchetsots Cathedral announcement was met with criticism and concern by the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom and various Armenian groups alike as well.\nSee also\n* Refugees in Azerbaijan\n* Flight of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians\nReferences"
