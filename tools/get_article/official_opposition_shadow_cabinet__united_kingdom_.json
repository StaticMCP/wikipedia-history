Each Shadow Cabinet member is typically given a position which corresponds to that of a government minister in Cabinet.\nComposition\nShadow Cabinet members, commonly known as shadow ministers, are usually appointed by the leader of the Opposition (currently Kemi Badenoch). The roles of shadow ministers are to develop alternative policies, hold the government to account for its actions and responses, and act as spokespeople for the opposition party in their own specific policy areas. By convention, shadow ministers are drawn either from serving members of the House of Commons or the House of Lords, with most chosen from the former. Since July 2024, the Conservative Party has been the Official Opposition, and its leadership therefore forms the current Shadow Cabinet.\nNot all opposition frontbenchers are members of the Shadow Cabinet, which is composed of the most senior opposition members (usually they number around twenty).\nThe leader of the Opposition, the Opposition chief whip and Opposition deputy chief whip are the only members of the Official Opposition in the House of Commons to be paid for their opposition roles in addition to their salaries as members of Parliament. The leader of the Opposition and the Opposition chief whip in the House of Lords also receive a salary.\nOther parties may also form frontbench teams of spokespeople which may be referred to as shadow cabinets by the party (e.g. the Liberal Democrats in 2019), but these are not part of the Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet.\nCurrent Shadow Cabinet\n, the members of the shadow cabinet are:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n| colspan=5 | His Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition Shadow Cabinet\n|-\n! colspan=2 scope=\"col\" | Shadow Minister\n!
