It was signed after lengthy negotiations between John Hay Drummond Hay and Muhammad al-Khatib, representatives of Queen Victoria and Sultan Abd al-Rahman, respectively. This treaty prolonged Morocco's independence but gave major concessions to British interests, and set a precedent.\nThis treaty was composed of two texts: the first was a general treaty of 38 articles dealing with the status of consuls, and their privileges and their freedom of movement, as well as the settling of British subjects in the country.The second text was a treaty of commerce with 8 articles. The most important was Article 6, which set the customs tariffs at 10%. The treaty abolished the Makhzen monopoly and definitively opened trade in Morocco.\nNotes and references"
