The awards are presented by the Arthur C. Clarke Foundation, although the selection is delegated to the British Interplanetary Society, with the exception of the International award, whose recipient is voted on by the Foundation  Nominations for the awards are made by members of the public, with shortlists drawn up by a panel of judges, who also choose the winner. Sir Arthur C. Clarke chose a special award independently of the public nominations.\nHistory\nFounded in 2005, the idea for the awards was proposed by Dave Wright to Jerry Stone, who then suggested they be named after Sir Arthur Clarke. Once permission was granted, Jerry Stone decided what the awards should look like, what categories should be included, and how they should be nominated and judged.\nHaving obtained Sir Arthur's permission for the awards to bear his name, Jerry Stone decided that the awards should have the same proportions (1:4:9) as the monolith featured in Clarke's 2001: A Space Odyssey, and be made of glass, as the description on the book of 2001 describes 'a crystalline monolith'. This represents Clarke's science fiction work. The award features the diagram Clarke drew in 1945 in order to demonstrate how satellites can provide global communications around the Earth from geostationary orbit, also called the Clarke Orbit. This represents Clarke's science work. It was co-designed by Howard Berry, who suggested the font and lettering style.\nInitially the awards were presented at the UK Space Conference (the British Rocketry Oral History Programme until it was renamed in 2008) which was held annually at Charterhouse School, Surrey, from 1998 to 2010. The association with the conference continues but only in alternate years, as the conference has been bi-annual since 2011.\nNot all categories are awarded each year; for example, 2008 was the first year in which nominations were shortlisted in the category of Best Film Presentation. An additional award was given in 2007 and 2008 that was named after and presented by George Abbey, the former director of the Johnson Space Center. It was awarded to those \"whose space achievement made us laugh the most\".\nThe award ceremony is similar to the Oscars in that multiple awards are given in various categories at the same event, which is different from other awards given in the field. As a result, the awards have been referred to as the Arthurs. The awards are held in high regard by the international Space community:\nDue to COVID-19 lockdowns in the United Kingdom, in 2020-21 the Awards could not be run in 2020. Subsequent editions have all been presented the following year, both for consistency and to allow \"a full calendar year for achievements to be completed and contributions made\".\n2023–2024\nThe 2023 awards were conferred on 12 November 2024 at the British Interplanetary Society's Reinventing Space conference at the Royal Aeronautical Society in London. The judges agreed to return to the pre-COVID system where achievements had to be completed between one award ceremony and the next. To realign the award calendar, nominations were for achievements and contributions in the 2023 calendar year through to September 2024, i.e. 21 months, allowing a return to the pre-COVID 12-month cycle in 2025.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Category\n!Recipient\n|-\n|Industry/Project Team\n|The Space Cluster & ESA Business Incubation Team\n|-\n|Industry/Project Individual\n|Andrew Cawthorne, Surrey Satellite Technology\n|-\n|Academic Study/Research Team\n|The UK Cluster Mission Team\n|-\n|Academic Study/Research Individual\n|Professor Anthony Illingworth\n|-\n|Education and Outreach Team\n|The SUN Team\n|-\n|Education and Outreach Individual\n|Sophie Allan, National Space Academy\n|-\n|Student\n|Joaquin Perez-Grande\n|-\n|Media, broadcast and written,  Team\n|The 'Our Fragile Space' Team\n|-\n|Media, broadcast and written, Individual\n|Andy Saunders\n|-\n|Lifetime Achievement\n|Robert Baldwin\n|-\n|International Achievement\n|Elisabetta Monnini, Leonardo Italy\n|}\n2022\nThe 2022 awards were conferred on 13 October 2023 at The Spine in Liverpool, at the conclusion of the Reinventing Space Conference and as part of the 90th anniversary of the founding of the society in Liverpool.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
