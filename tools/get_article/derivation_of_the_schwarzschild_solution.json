It is considered by some to be one of the simplest and most useful solutions to the Einstein field equations.\nAssumptions and notation\nWorking in a coordinate chart with coordinates  \\left(r, \\theta, \\phi, t \\right) labelled 1 to 4 respectively, we begin with the metric in its most general form (10 independent components, each of which is a smooth function of 4 variables). The solution is assumed to be spherically symmetric, static and vacuum. For the purposes of this article, these assumptions may be stated as follows (see the relevant links for precise definitions):\n# A spherically symmetric spacetime is one that is invariant under rotations and taking the mirror image.\n# A static spacetime is one in which all metric components are independent of the time coordinate t (so that {{tmath|1= \\tfrac\\partial{\\partial t}g_{\\mu \\nu}=0 }}) and the geometry of the spacetime is unchanged under a time-reversal .\n# A vacuum solution is one that satisfies the equation {{tmath|1= T_{ab}=0 }}. From the Einstein field equations (with zero cosmological constant), this implies that R_{ab}=0 since contracting  R_{ab}-\\tfrac{R}{2} g_{ab}=0 yields .\n# Metric signature used here is .\nDiagonalising the metric\nThe first simplification to be made is to diagonalise the metric. Under the coordinate transformation, , all metric components should remain the same. The metric components g_{\\mu 4} () change under this transformation as:\n: g_{\\mu 4}'=\\frac{\\partial x^{\\alpha}}{\\partial x^{'\\mu}} \\frac{\\partial x^{\\beta}}{\\partial x^{'4}} g_{\\alpha \\beta}= -g_{\\mu 4} ()\nBut, as we expect g'_{\\mu 4}= g_{\\mu 4} (metric components remain the same), this means that:\n: g_{\\mu 4} = 0 ()\nSimilarly, the coordinate transformations (r, \\theta, \\phi, t) \\rightarrow (r, \\theta, -\\phi, t) and (r, \\theta, \\phi, t) \\rightarrow (r, -\\theta, \\phi, t) respectively give:\n: g_{\\mu 3} = 0 ()\n: g_{\\mu 2} = 0 ()\nPutting all these together gives:\n: g_{\\mu \\nu} = 0  ()\nand hence the metric must be of the form:\n: ds^2=\\,  g_{11}\\,d r^2 + g_{22} \\,d \\theta ^2 + g_{33} \\,d \\phi ^2 + g_{44} \\,dt ^2\nwhere the four metric components are independent of the time coordinate t (by the static assumption).\nSimplifying the components\nOn each hypersurface of constant t, constant \\theta and constant \\phi (i.e., on each radial line), g_{11} should only depend on r (by spherical symmetry). Hence g_{11} is a function of a single variable:\n: g_{11}=A\\left(r\\right)\nA similar argument applied to g_{44} shows that:\n: g_{44}=B\\left(r\\right)\nOn the hypersurfaces of constant t and constant , it is required that the metric be that of a 2-sphere:\n: dl^2=r_{0}^2 (d \\theta^2 + \\sin^2 \\theta\\, d \\phi^2)\nChoosing one of these hypersurfaces (the one with radius {{tmath|1= r_{0} }}, say), the metric components restricted to this hypersurface (which we denote by \\tilde{g}_{22} and {{tmath|1= \\tilde{g}_{33} }}) should be unchanged under rotations through \\theta and \\phi (again, by spherical symmetry). Comparing the forms of the metric on this hypersurface gives:\n: \\tilde{g}_{22}\\left(d \\theta^2 + \\frac{\\tilde{g}_{33}}{\\tilde{g}_{22}} \\,d \\phi^2 \\right) = r_{0}^2 (d \\theta^2 + \\sin^2 \\theta \\,d \\phi^2)\nwhich immediately yields:\n: \\tilde{g}_{22}=r_{0}^2 and \\tilde{g}_{33}=r_{0}^2 \\sin ^2 \\theta\nBut this is required to hold on each hypersurface; hence,\n: g_{22}=\\, r^2 and g_{33}=\\, r^2 \\sin^2 \\theta\nAn alternative intuitive way to see that g_{22} and g_{33} must be the same as for a flat spacetime is that stretching or compressing an elastic material in a spherically symmetric manner (radially) will not change the angular distance between two points.\nThus, the metric can be put in the form:\n: ds^2=A\\left(r\\right)dr^2+r^2\\,d \\theta^2+r^2 \\sin^2 \\theta \\,d \\phi^2 + B\\left(r\\right) dt^2\nwith A and B as yet undetermined functions of . Note that if A or B is equal to zero at some point, the metric would be singular at that point.\nCalculating the Christoffel symbols\nUsing the metric above, we find the Christoffel symbols, where the indices are . The sign ' denotes a total derivative of a function.\n: \\Gamma^1_{ik} = \\begin{bmatrix}\nA'/\\left( 2A \\right) & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & -r/A & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & -r \\sin^2 \\theta /A & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & -B'/\\left( 2A \\right) \\end{bmatrix}\n: \\Gamma^2_{ik} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1/r & 0 & 0\\\\\n1/r & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & -\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n: \\Gamma^3_{ik} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 1/r & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & \\cot\\theta & 0\\\\\n1/r & \\cot\\theta & 0 &  0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n: \\Gamma^4_{ik} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 & B'/\\left( 2B \\right)\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\nB'/\\left( 2B \\right) & 0 & 0 & 0\\end{bmatrix}\nUsing the field equations to find A(r) and B(r)\nTo determine A and , the vacuum field equations are employed:\n: R_{\\alpha\\beta}=\\, 0\nHence:\n: {\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\beta\\alpha,\\rho}} - \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\rho\\alpha,\\beta}\n+ \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\rho\\lambda} \\Gamma^\\lambda_{\\beta\\alpha}\n- \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\beta\\lambda}\\Gamma^\\lambda_{\\rho\\alpha}=0\\,,\nwhere a comma is used to set off the index that is being used for the derivative. The Ricci curvature is diagonal in the given coordinates:\n: R_{tt} = -\\frac{1}{4}\\frac{B'}{A}\\left(\\frac{A'}{A}-\\frac{B'}{B}+\\frac{4}{r}\\right) -\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{B'}{A}\\right)' ,\n: R_{rr} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{B'}{B}\\right)^{'} -\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{B'}{B}\\right)^{2} + \\frac{1}{4}\\frac{A'}{A}\\left(\\frac{B'}{B}+\\frac{4}{r}\\right) ,\n: R_{\\theta\\theta} = 1-\\left(\\frac{r}{A}\\right)^{'} -\\frac{r}{2A}\\left(\\frac{A'}{A}+\\frac{B'}{B}\\right) ,\n: R_{\\phi\\phi} = \\sin^2(\\theta)R_{\\theta\\theta},\nwhere the prime means the r derivative of the functions.\nOnly three of the field equations are nontrivial (the fourth equation is just \\sin^2 \\theta times the third equation) and upon simplification become, respectively:\n: 4 A' B^2 - 2 r B'' AB + r A' B'B + r B' ^2 A=0 ,\n:  - 2 r B'' AB + r A' B'B + r B' ^2 A - 4B' AB=0 ,\n: r A'B + 2 A^2 B - 2AB - r B' A=0\nSubtracting the first and second equations produces:\n: A'B +A B'=0 \\Rightarrow A(r)B(r) =K\nwhere K is a non-zero real constant. Substituting A(r)B(r) = K into the third equation and tidying up gives:\n: r A' =A(1-A)\nwhich has general solution:\n: A(r)=\\left(1+\\frac{1}{Sr}\\right)^{-1}\nfor some non-zero real constant S. Hence, the metric for a static, spherically symmetric vacuum solution is now of the form:\n: ds^2=\\left(1+\\frac{1}{S r}\\right)^{-1}dr^2+r^2(d \\theta^2 + \\sin^2 \\theta d \\phi^2)+K \\left(1+\\frac{1}{S r}\\right)dt^2\nNote that the spacetime represented by the above metric is asymptotically flat, i.e. as , the metric approaches that of the Minkowski metric and the spacetime manifold resembles that of Minkowski space.\nUsing the weak-field approximation to find K and S\nThe geodesics of the metric (obtained where ds is extremised) must, in some limit (e.g., toward infinite speed of light), agree with the solutions of Newtonian motion (e.g., obtained by Lagrange equations). (The metric must also limit to Minkowski space when the mass it represents vanishes.)\n: 0=\\delta\\int\\frac{ds}{dt}dt=\\delta\\int(KE+PE_g)dt\n(where KE is the kinetic energy and PE_g is the Potential Energy due to gravity) The constants K and S are fully determined by some variant of this approach; from the weak-field approximation one arrives at the result:\n: g_{44}=K\\left(1 +\\frac{1}{Sr}\\right) \\approx -c^2+\\frac{2Gm}{r} = -c^2 \\left(1-\\frac{2Gm}{c^2 r} \\right)\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, m is the mass of the gravitational source and c is the speed of light. It is found that:\n: K=\\, -c^2 and \\frac{1}{S}=-\\frac{2Gm}{c^2}\nHence:\n: A(r)=\\left(1-\\frac{2Gm}{c^2 r}\\right)^{-1} and B(r)=-c^2 \\left(1-\\frac{2Gm}{c^2 r}\\right)\nSo, the Schwarzschild metric may finally be written in the form:\n: ds^2=\\left(1-\\frac{2Gm}{c^2 r}\\right)^{-1}dr^2+r^2(d \\theta^2 +\\sin^2 \\theta d \\phi^2)-c^2 \\left(1-\\frac{2Gm}{c^2 r}\\right)dt^2\nNote that:\n: \\frac{2Gm}{c^2}=r_\\text{s}\nis the definition of the Schwarzschild radius for an object of mass m, so the Schwarzschild metric may be rewritten in the alternative form:\n: ds^2=\\left(1-\\frac{r_\\text{s}}{r}\\right)^{-1}dr^2+r^2(d\\theta^2 +\\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2)-c^2\\left(1-\\frac{r_\\text{s}}{r}\\right)dt^2\nwhich shows that the metric becomes singular approaching the event horizon (that is, {{tmath|1= r \\rightarrow r_\\text{s} }}). The metric singularity is not a physical one (although there is a real physical singularity at r=0), as can be shown by using a suitable coordinate transformation (e.g. the Kruskal–Szekeres coordinate system).\nAlternate derivation using known physics in special cases\n[This derivation is flawed because it assumes Kepler's 3rd law. This is unfounded because that law has relativistic corrections. For example, the meaning of \"r\" is physical distance in that classical law, and merely a coordinate in General Relativity.] The Schwarzschild metric can also be derived using the known physics for a circular orbit and a temporarily stationary point mass.  Start with the metric with coefficients that are unknown coefficients of :\n: -c^2 = \\left ( {ds \\over d\\tau} \\right )^2 = A(r)\\left ( {dr \\over d\\tau} \\right )^2 + r^2\\left ( {d\\phi \\over d\\tau} \\right )^2 + B(r)\\left( {dt \\over d\\tau} \\right)^2.\nNow apply the Euler–Lagrange equation to the arc length integral {{tmath|1= \\textstyle { J=\\int_{\\tau_1}^{\\tau_2} \\sqrt{-\\left(\\text{d}s/\\text{d}\\tau\\right)^2 }\\, \\text{d}\\tau } }}.  Since ds/d\\tau is constant, the integrand can be replaced with (\\text{d}s/\\text{d}\\tau)^2, because the E–L equation is exactly the same if the integrand is multiplied by any constant.  Applying the E–L equation to J with the modified integrand yields:\n: \\begin{array}{lcl} A'(r)\\dot{r}^2 + 2r\\dot{\\phi}^2 + B'(r)\\dot{t}^2 & = & 2A'(r)\\dot{r}^2 + 2A(r)\\ddot{r} \\\\ 0 & = & 2r\\dot{r}\\dot{\\phi} + r^2\\ddot{\\phi} \\\\ 0 & = & B'(r)\\dot{r}\\dot{t} + B(r)\\ddot{t} \\end{array}\nwhere dot denotes differentiation with respect to .\nIn a circular orbit {{tmath|1= \\dot{r}=\\ddot{r}=0 }}, so the first E–L equation above is equivalent to\n: 2r\\dot{\\phi}^2 + B'(r)\\dot{t}^2 = 0 \\Leftrightarrow B'(r) = -2r\\dot{\\phi}^2/\\dot{t}^2 = -2r(d\\phi/dt)^2.\nKepler's third law of motion is\n: \\frac{T^2}{r^3} = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G(M+m)}.\nIn a circular orbit, the period T equals , implying\n: \\left( {d\\phi \\over dt} \\right)^2 = GM/r^3\nsince the point mass m is negligible compared to the mass of the central body .  So B'(r) = -2GM/r^2  and integrating this yields , where C  is an unknown constant of integration.  C  can be determined by setting , in which case the spacetime is flat and .  So C = -c^2  and\n: B(r) = 2GM/r - c^2 = c^2(2GM/c^2r - 1) = c^2(r_\\text{s}/r - 1).\nWhen the point mass is temporarily stationary, \\dot{r}=0  and {{tmath|1= \\dot{\\phi}=0 }}. The original metric equation becomes \\dot{t}^2 = -c^2/B(r) and the first E–L equation above becomes {{tmath|1= A(r) = B'(r)\\dot{t}^2 / (2\\ddot{r}) }}.  When the point mass is temporarily stationary, \\ddot{r} is the acceleration of gravity, .  So\n: A(r) = \\left(\\frac{-2MG}{r^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{-c^2}{2MG/r - c^2}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{r^2}{2MG}\\right) = \\frac{1}{1 - 2MG/(rc^2)} = \\frac{1}{1 - r_\\text{s}/r}.\nAlternative form in isotropic coordinates\nThe original formulation of the metric uses anisotropic coordinates in which the velocity of light is not the same in the radial and transverse directions.  Arthur Eddington gave alternative forms in isotropic coordinates.  For isotropic spherical coordinates r_1, , , coordinates \\theta and \\phi are unchanged, and then (provided that {{tmath|1= r \\geq {2 Gm}/{c^2} }})\n: r = r_1 \\left(1+\\frac{Gm}{2c^2 r_1}\\right)^{2} , &nbsp; dr = dr_1 \\left(1-\\frac{(Gm)^2}{4c^4 r_1^2}\\right)\nand\n: \\left(1-\\frac{2Gm}{c^2 r}\\right) = \\left(1-\\frac{Gm}{2c^2 r_1}\\right)^{2}/\\left(1+\\frac{Gm}{2c^2 r_1}\\right)^{2}\nThen for isotropic rectangular coordinates x, y, z,\n: x = r_1\\, \\sin(\\theta)\\, \\cos(\\phi) , &nbsp; y = r_1\\, \\sin(\\theta)\\, \\sin(\\phi) , &nbsp; z = r_1\\, \\cos(\\theta)\nThe metric then becomes, in isotropic rectangular coordinates:\n: ds^2= \\left(1+\\frac{Gm}{2c^2 r_1}\\right)^{4}(dx^2+dy^2+dz^2) -c^2 dt^2 \\left(1-\\frac{Gm}{2c^2 r_1}\\right)^{2}/\\left(1+\\frac{Gm}{2c^2 r_1}\\right)^{2}\nDispensing with the static assumption – Birkhoff's theorem\nIn deriving the Schwarzschild metric, it was assumed that the metric was vacuum, spherically symmetric and static. The static assumption is unneeded, as Birkhoff's theorem states that any spherically symmetric vacuum solution of Einstein's field equations is stationary; the Schwarzschild solution thus follows. Birkhoff's theorem has the consequence that any pulsating star that remains spherically symmetric does not generate gravitational waves, as the region exterior to the star remains static.\nSee also\n* Karl Schwarzschild\n* Kerr metric\n* Reissner–Nordström metric\nReferences"
