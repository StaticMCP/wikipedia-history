In 1960, he was appointed sole responsible designer of the alphabet.\nIn the early 1960s, Read produced the quarterly journal Shaw-script, which was printed using the Shavian alphabet.\nIn 1966, after extensive testing of Shavian with English speakers from around the world, Read introduced Quikscript, a revised form of his Shavian alphabet. Quikscript, also known as the \"Read alphabet\", has more ligatures than Shavian, which makes it easier to write by hand. Its appearance is more cursive than Shavian.\nA few days before his death, he completed a new alphabet called Soundspell (now Readspel; not to be confused with Soundspel), based, probably for increased chances of popular acceptance, on the Latin script.\n}}\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://groups.io/g/QuikScript Quikscript io group]\n* [https://archive.today/20121208202530/http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shawalphabet/ Shavian Yahoo Group]"
