The contest was held on Super Tuesday alongside primaries in 14 other states and territories.\nBiden won the primary in a landslide. However, No preference received 1 delegate as the result of a protest vote against ongoing American involvement in the Israel–Hezbollah conflict.\nCandidates\nIncumbent President Joe Biden announced on April 25, 2023, his bid for a second term. He faced primary challenges from author, progressive activist, and 2020 presidential candidate Marianne Williamson and U.S. Representative from MN 3, Dean Phillips.\nBallot access controversy\nThere are three ways for a presidential candidate to get on the primary ballot in Massachusetts: a candidate can be placed on the ballot by the state party, they can gather 2,500 signatures to achieve ballot access, or the Secretary of the Commonwealth can place candidates who have been \"generally advocated or recognized in the national news media.\" The Massachusetts Democratic Party voted to submit only Biden's name to the state ballot, which was highly criticized by the Williamson campaign, which did not attempt to file any signatures. Ultimately, both Phillips and Williamson were placed on the ballot by Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin.\nEndorsements\n(1976–2013)\n* Elizabeth Warren, U.S. Senator from Massachusetts (2013–present), candidate for president in 2020\nU.S. Representatives\n* Seth Moulton, U.S. Representative from  (2015–present), candidate for president in 2020\nStatewide officials\n* Maura Healey, 73rd Governor of Massachusetts (2023–present), 44th Massachusetts Attorney General (2015–2023)\nLocal officials\n* Michelle Wu, Mayor of Boston, Massachusetts (2021–present)\nNewspapers\n* The Boston Globe\n}}\nLocal officials\n*Willie Burnley Jr., Somerville City Councilor at-large (2022–present)\nOrganizations\n*National organization and Cape Cod and River Valley chapters of the Democratic Socialists of America\n*IfNotNow Boston\n*Jewish Voice for Peace Action\n*Massachusetts Peace Action\n}}\nPolling\nHypothetical polling\n{| class=\"wikitable tpl-blanktable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;\"\n|- valign=bottom style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n!
