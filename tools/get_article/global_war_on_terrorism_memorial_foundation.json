      "text": "# Global War on Terrorism Memorial Foundation\n\nThe Global War on Terrorism Memorial Foundation is an American non-profit organization dedicated to planning, funding, and building a memorial focused on the Global War on Terrorism on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.\nHistory\nThe Global War on Terror Memorial Foundation was formed in 2015 as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation by a small group of like-minded veterans, military spouses, and citizens seeking to honor the service and sacrifice of all who served in the Global War on Terrorism. In its first two years of existence, the foundation lobbied the United States Congress to pass the Global War on Terrorism Memorial Act. The legislation, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate by unanimous consent and was signed into law by President Donald Trump on August 18, 2017, authorized the establishment of a national war memorial on federal land in Washington, D.C. The Global War on Terrorism Memorial Act entrusts the foundation to oversee the fundraising, design, and construction of the memorial in accordance with federal law, and exempts the memorial from the customary 10-year statutory waiting period after the formal conclusion of the associated conflict. It also prohibits the use of federal funds for the memorial.\nFrom 2019 to 2021, the foundation advocated for the passage of the Global War on Terrorism Memorial Location Act, which authorizes construction of a memorial specifically within the Reserve area of the National Mall. This legislation passed the House of Representatives as an amendment to the fiscal year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act on September 23, 2021. On December 15, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the FY 2022 NDAA, thus securing congressional approval for a memorial on the National Mall. President Joe Biden signed the legislation into law on December 27, 2021.\nThe Commemorative Works Act sets a seven-year timeline for the Foundation to raise funds and finalize a design of the memorial, giving them until 2028 unless extended by Congress.\nConstruction of a memorial\nThe construction of a memorial on federal land in Washington, D.C., is a 24-step process as set forth by the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC). In April 2023, the NCPC staff recommended advancing a site at Constitution Avenue and 23rd Street NW near the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and the planned National Desert Storm and Desert Shield Memorial and a site on the Potomac River near the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial. The Foundation subsequently announced it would move forward with the Constitution Avenue site, putting it in steps 13-19 for design approval.\nIn July 2023, the Foundation selected Marlon Blackwell Architects to design the memorial.\nLeadership\nMichael \"Rod\" Rodriguez, a former U.S. Army Green Beret, became the president and CEO of the foundation on January 3, 2022. President George W. Bush serves as the foundation's Honorary Chairman. The foundation's leadership structure also entails a board of directors. The chairman of the board is Theodore \"Ted\" Skokos, a retired U.S. Army officer and entrepreneur.\nExisting memorials\nCurrently only three nationally oriented memorials honor each of the service members killed in action during the Global War on Terrorism.  An additional (fourth) memorial includes many service members.  There are several state memorials which focus on service members from specific states.
