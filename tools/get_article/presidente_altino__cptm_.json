In 1976, Fepasa begins the modernization of commuter trains and expand the existing maintenance yard next to the new station. which was reopened on 25 January 1979. In the same year, the station becomes an interchange station with the Jurubatuba branch. In 1996, CPTM starts operating West and South Lines from Fepasa and renames them as Line B-Gray and C-Celeste, respectively. In April 2008, it was determined that Line B-Gray would become Line 8-Diamond, and Line C-Celeste would become Line 9-Emerald.\nAccess catwalk\nTo expand the access capacity of Presidente Altino station, Fepasa hired Construtora Azevedo e Travassos and Maubertec Engenharia e Projetos Ltda to implement a  catwalk over the station yard. To implement it, without interfering in the yard of the railway operation, it was used for the first time in Brazil the increment launch method, created in Germany. In about a year, the catwalk was delivered to the traffic.\nReferences"
