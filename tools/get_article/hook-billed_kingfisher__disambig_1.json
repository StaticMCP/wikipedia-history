It is the only member of the genus Melidora.\nTaxonomy\nThe first formal description of the hook-billed kingfisher was by the French surgeon and naturalist René Lesson in 1827 under the binomial name Dacelo macrorrhina. The hook-billed kingfisher is now the only species placed within the genus Melidora which was introduced by Lesson in 1830. The name of the genus probably comes from the classical Greek mēlis for \"yellow\" and doru for \"spear\". The specific epithet macrorrhina is from the classical Greek makros for \"long\" and rhis for \"nose\".\nThere are three subspecies:\n* M. m. waigiuensis Hartert, 1930 – Waigeo Island\n* M. m. macrorrhina (Lesson, R, 1827) – west, central, and east New Guinea, Misool and Batanta Islands\n* M. m. jobiensis Salvadori, 1880 – north New Guinea and Yapen Island\nDescription\nThe hook-billed kingfisher is a large dumpy kingfisher with a length of  and a weight of . It has a long, white stripe below its eyes. Its underside is white. It has dull yellow feet.\nThe call and song are mainly given at night. The most common call is a long whistle followed by a series of higher pitched short notes.\nBehaviour\nBreeding\nThe hook-billed kingfisher excavates a nest chamber in an active arboreal termite nest  above the ground. The clutch is two white eggs which hatch asynchronously. The male helps to incubate the eggs and brood the young.\nFeeding\nIt feeds on insects and frogs. It may dig into the soil searching for prey in a similar manner to the shovel-billed kookaburra.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.xeno-canto.org/species/Melidora-macrorrhina Xeno-canto: audio recordings of the hook-billed kingfisher]"
