As part of a country's cultural heritage, they include celebrations, festivals, performances, oral traditions, music, and the making of handicrafts. The term \"intangible cultural heritage\" is formally established by the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, which was drafted in 2003 and took effect in 2006. The inscription of new heritage elements on UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists for protection and safeguarding is determined by the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, an organization established by the Convention. Palestine ratified the Convention on 8 December 2011. It has served on the Intangible Cultural Heritage Committee from 2016 to 2020.\nStarting in 2008, Palestinian hikaye was the first practice from Palestine to be inscribed by UNESCO; Palestinian embroidery was inscribed in 2021. Joint inscriptions with other Arab countries for Arabic calligraphy and date palm cultivation and use were inscribed in 2021 and 2022 respectively. Four further practices have been nominated for inscription by Palestine: dabkeh in 2023 and Nabulsi soap-making in 2024; metal engraving, and henna, with other Arab states, in 2023 and 2024 respectively.\nBackground\nIn 1993, in response to the Oslo Agreement, significant investment was made in the protection of Palestinian cultural heritage. Its subsequent inscription to the UNESCO lists has given international recognition to these practices. Nonetheless, researchers have argued that the intangible cultural heritage of Palestine has struggled to survive under Israeli occupation. This is particularly evident in the construction of internal borders prohibiting access to land, with the resultant effect of hindering traditional agricultural practices and the semi-nomadic lifeway of some communities. Systemic cultural appropriation of Palestine's heritage has also been reported, such as the use of traditional Palestinian embroidery in Israeli fashion.\nIn some cases, Palestinian heritage has been destroyed by the occupying forces. For example, in the South Hebron Hills, Palestinian cave houses were confiscated by Israeli forces and the residents evicted. This disconnected young people in the area from their heritage; to reconnect to their identity they collected oral histories on the cave-based lifestyle. Support for intangible cultural heritage has also been proposed as a way to foster economic and environmental sustainability, for example in the village of Battir. For many Palestinians, continued connection with their cultural heritage serves as a form of resistance. Palestinian henna designs have had a resurgence in popularity, according to TRT World writing in 2023, with a focus on olive designs, amongst others, as an act of resistance for women.\nOther forms of intangible cultural heritage which are not inscribed, or nominated for inscription, include coffee preparation, Maqluba, Palestinian architecture, Nabulsi cheese, oral testimony from the South Hebron Hills, traditional song, as well as food practices of dried yoghurt and grape syrup. On-going nominations of intangible cultural heritage include Arabic Kohl, scheduled for inscription in 2025, as well as Ka'ak Al-Quds (Jerusalem sesame bread), Art and traditions of building with earth, and Oud instrument: practices, skills and performing arts, all scheduled for inscription in 2026. The traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of wild plant usage in Artas has been considered as another form of Palestinian intangible cultural heritage.\nIntangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity\nUNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity consists of three lists: the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding, and the Register of Good Safeguarding Practices. Palestine only has elements inscribed on the Representative List.\n}}\nRepresentative List\nThis list aims to represent the intangible cultural heritage of Palestine worldwide and bring awareness to its significance.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders sticky-header\"\n|+\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 180px;\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" class=\"unsortable\" | Media\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px;\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px;\" |\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Palestinian hikaye\n|\n| 2008\n| 00124\n| The Palestinian hikaye is a traditional narrative technique which is practiced by Palestinian women over the age of 70; it has been evolving for centuries. Common themes include family issues, concerns with Middle Eastern society, social structures affecting Palestinian women, and critique of society. It is practiced at home, during events or winter evenings. Women and children attend, but it is considered inappropriate for men to attend. The use of expressive language, emphasis, speech rhythms, vocal inflections, use of the Palestinian dialect, and other good story-telling techniques are defining features of the Palestinian hikaye.}}\n|\n| 2021\n|  01718\n| Arabic calligraphy is the practice of transforming and stretching the letters of the Arabic alphabet to convey numerous different motifs. It was originally developed to make writing easily understandable and gradually became an art form present in marble and wood carving, embroidery, and metal etching, among other art forms. Traditionally, the Qalam, writing instrument, is made from bamboo stems and reeds. The ink is created using honey, black soot, and saffron. The handmade paper is treated with starch, egg white and alum. More modern forms use markers, synthetic paint, and spray paint. It is passed down both informally and formally, through schools and apprenticeships.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| The art of embroidery in Palestine, practices, skills, knowledge and rituals\n|\n| 2021\n| 01722\n| Although traditional embroidery is widespread across Palestine and the Palestinian diaspora, it originated from rural areas.

These range from the cultivation and care of date palms, to the use of it in social customs, and cultural references in song and poetry.

The practice reflects the Palestinians' connection to nature and brings communities together.\n|}\nSee also\n*List of World Heritage Sites in the Arab states\n*List of World Heritage Sites in Palestine\n*Destruction of cultural heritage during the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip\n*Tourism in Palestine\nNotes\nReferences"
