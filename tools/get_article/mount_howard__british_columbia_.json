It is part of the Joffre Group, which is a subset of the Lillooet Ranges. Mount Howard is situated  east of Pemberton and immediately southeast of Mount Matier. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into Twin One Creek thence Lillooet Lake which is within the Lillooet River watershed. Mount Howard is more notable for its steep rise above local terrain than for its absolute elevation as topographic relief is significant with the summit rising 1,650&nbsp;meters (5,413&nbsp;ft) above Twin One Creek in .\nEtymology\nThe mountain was named after John Howard, (1944–1978), an avid mountaineer and founder of a guide service that opened up the Joffre Group area for other climbers. He was killed in a climbing accident near the Columbia Icefield when he fell into a crevasse near the top of the Athabasca Glacier on February 23, 1978. The mountain's toponym was officially adopted June 11, 1979, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada.\nClimate\nBased on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Howard is located in a subarctic climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Winter temperatures can drop below −20&nbsp;°C with wind chill factors below −30&nbsp;°C. This climate supports the Twin One Glacier on the peak's north slope. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Mount Howard.\nGallery\nFile:Mount Howard.jpg|North aspect\nFile:Mount Howard (2,551 m).jpg|Mount Howard (centered) viewed from Mount Matier.\nFile:Mt.
