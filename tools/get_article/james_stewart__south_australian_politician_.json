Nearby properties were taken up around the same time by John Stewart, for whom Stewart's Ranges near Naracoorte was named, and Charles Stewart of Avenue Plains (near Lucindale, 40&nbsp;km from Naracoorte). It is not certain what relation Charles and John were to Alexander. Some time before 1870 Alexander took over a cattle property \"Woodlands\" at Morphett Vale.\nJames Stewart, was born in the South East of South Australia, and grew up at \"Moy Hall\" on the Mosquito Plains. He was educated at Portland, Victoria, St. Peter's College, and Whinham's Grammar School in North Adelaide. He married and took over a sheep station in Victoria, which he later sold at a substantial profit, and retired to \"Hackham House\", Hackham, and was a member of the Adelaide Hunt Club.\nJames Stewart was MHA for Noarlunga from March 1870 – December 1871. He failed in his bid to be re-elected.\nHe died at Hackham House after a long illness. He married twice; he had a daughter and three sons by his first wife and a daughter by his second.\nFamily\nJames Stewart's father, Alexander Stewart (c. 1799–1883), arrived in South Australia in 1839 with his wife, who before their marriage was Mrs. Hay, two stepsons, and two step-daughters. Alexander Stewart married again, on 1 July 1863, to the widow Mrs. Jane Hay ( – c. 1884). Alexander Stewart was then stepfather of Daniel Hay, William Hay, and four step-daughters, the youngest being Jessie Hay, who married Ronald McDonald on 11 November 1857.
