It was built in 1959. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 August 1999.\nHistory\nThe Koumala War Memorial was erected in 1959. The dedication date of the memorial is Friday 18 April 1958. Funds for the memorial were raised by public subscription, arranged by the Koumala sub-branch of the RSL. The memorial was erected in honour of those who served in all wars and particularly honours the six local men who made the supreme sacrifice in honour of their country during the Second World War.\nSix small trees have been planted by the school children with each tree representative of one of the six men. Temporary plaques displaying the names were placed beside each tree with the intention to replace them with more permanent plaques at some later stage.\nDescription\nThe Koumala War Memorial is situated in a reserve next to the Koumala State School, facing Bull Street. The reserve is surrounded by a low chain wire fence with white painted metal frames. The setting in which the memorial is located is barren apart from new plantings of \"Ned Kelly\" Grevilleas, and a flagpole which stands directly behind the memorial.\nThe memorial is constructed of white painted concrete and comprises a double stepped base from which rises an obelisk on a square plinth. The front face of the plinth features a plaque with a commemorative statement from the citizens of the Koumala district. The obelisk is surmounted by a small Latin cross.\nInscriptions on the plaques on the memorial read as follows:\nFront Inscription\n[ Names ]\nPlaque :\nIn Memory Of\nThose Who Gave Their\nLives In Defence\nOf Our Country\nAt the going down of the sun\nand in the morning\nWe will remember them\nTheir Name Liveth For Evermore\nDedicated 2006\n[ Names ]\nPlaque :\nErected By\nTHE CITIZENS OF\nKOUMALA & DISTRICT\nIn Memory Of Those Who\nMade The Supreme Sacrifice\nIn Defence Of Their Country.\nHeritage listing\nKoumala War Memorial was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 August 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.'''\nWar Memorials are important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history as they are representative of a recurrent theme that involved most communities throughout the state.
