He made his return in a match against a touring International XI team and took the wicket of Basil D'Oliveira. For the rest of the decade, Parker was a regular in the Rhodesian side for their Currie Cup campaigns and had his best season with the ball in 1967/68 when he took 24 wickets at 20.41. This tally included a match haul of 10 for 124 against Orange Free State at Bloemfontein.\nIn 1978, at the age of 39, Parker made a return to cricket, representing Rhodesia B in the President's Cup and Zimbabwe-Rhodesia B in the 1979/80 Castle Bowl tournament. His batting improved considerably and despite coming into the Castle Bowl with only two first-class half centuries on his resume, he finished the tournament with 416 runs at 46.22, including four half centuries.\nHe crossed to South African team Griqualand West for the 1981/82 SAB Bowl whom he captained in his three matches.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
