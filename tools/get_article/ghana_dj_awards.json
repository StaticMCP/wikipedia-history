Organizers of the Awards later expressed their appreciation of the genuine concerns raised by the international DJs and explained that the suggestions and concerns would be reviewed and addressed accordingly in subsequent editions.\nIn October 2019, DJ Asumadu expressed his huge disappointment at the 2019 Ghana DJ Awards, after he felt snubbed by the organizers of the awards despite playing many shows in the clubs and events.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
