During the ceremony, the Académie André Delvaux presented Magritte Awards in twenty categories. The ceremony, televised in Belgium by BeTV, was produced by José Bouquiaux and directed by Vincent J. Gustin. Film director Jaco Van Dormael presided the ceremony, while actress Helena Noguerra hosted the evening. The pre-show ceremony was hosted by film director Fabrice Du Welz.\nMr. Nobody won six awards, including Best Film and Best Director for Jaco Van Dormael. Other winners included Illegal, Private Lessons, and A Town Called Panic with two awards each, and The Barons, The Boat Race, Looking for Eric, Paths of Memory, Sleepless Night, and Soeur Sourire with one.\nBackground\nIn 2010, the Académie André Delvaux was established by Patrick Quinet, president of the Francophone Film Producers Association (UPFF), and Luc Jabon, president of Pro Spère, to unite the five branches of the film industry: actors, directors, producers, technicians and writers. It aims to recognize excellence in Belgian francophone cinematic achievements in order to have a Belgian counterpart of the French César Awards. Charly Herscovici, who created the Magritte Foundation, allowed the academy to use the name of the Belgian artist René Magritte.\nOverseen by the Académie André Delvaux, the Magritte Awards replace the Joseph Plateau Awards, which were disestablished in 2007. During the first ceremony, 18 merit categories and two special awards were presented, honoring artists, directors and other personalities of the film industry for their works during the 2009–2010 period.\nWinners and nominees\nThe nominees for the 1st Magritte Awards were announced on 13 January 2011 at the Square in Mont des Arts, Brussels, by Patrick Quinet and Luc Jabon, co-presidents of the Académie André Delvaux. Illegal received the most nominations with eight total, followed by Mr. Nobody and Private Lessons with seven each. The nominees for the Magritte Awards for Best Short Film and Best Documentary Film were announced on 29 December 2010.\nThe winners were announced during the awards ceremony on 5 February 2011. Mr. Nobody won six awards, the most for the ceremony: Best Film, Best Director and Best Screenplay for Jaco Van Dormael, Best Cinematography for Christophe Beaucarne, Best Original Score for Pierre Van Dormael, and Best Editing for Matyas Veress. Illegal and Private Lessons received two acting awards apiece. A Town Called Panic received two technical awards. On 25 January 2011 the Honorary Magritte Award was bestowed posthumously to André Delvaux.\nAwards\n, Best Director and Best Screenplay winner|alt=A photo of a man wearing glasses and an unbuttoned collared shirt.]]\n, Best Supporting Actor winner|alt=A black and white side profile of a man looking toward his right shoulder.
