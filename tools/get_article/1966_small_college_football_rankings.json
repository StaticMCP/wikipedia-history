Separate rankings were published by the Associated Press (AP) and the United Press International (UPI). The AP rankings were selected by a board of sports writers, and the UPI rankings were selected by a board of small-college coaches.\nThe 1966 San Diego State Aztecs football team (11–0), led by head coach Don Coryell and defensive coordinator John Madden, was rated as the small-college champion by both the AP and UPI.  (9–0) was ranked No. 2 by the AP and No. 3 by the UPI.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D8FFEB; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Increase in
