As the only American universities old enough to have alumni that participated in the American Revolution and the founding of the United States, these schools have been identified as a group for their influence on U.S. history.\nWhile all nine colonial colleges were founded as private institutions, two later became public universities: the College of William & Mary in 1906, and Rutgers University in 1945. The remaining seven are all members of the Ivy League and remain private : Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Penn, Brown, and Dartmouth.\nNine colonial colleges\nSeven of the nine colonial colleges began their histories as institutions of higher learning. The other two developed out of existing preparatory schools. The University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League university in Philadelphia, began operating in 1751 as the Academy of Philadelphia, a secondary school founded by Benjamin Franklin, and later added an institution of higher education in 1755 following the granting of a charter to the College of Philadelphia. Dartmouth College, an Ivy League college in Hanover, New Hampshire, began operating in 1768 as the collegiate department of Moor's Charity School, a secondary school founded in 1754 by Eleazar Wheelock, the college's founder. Dartmouth considers its founding date to be 1769, when it was granted a collegiate charter.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Image\n! style=\"width:250px;\"|Colonial college  (present name, if different)\n! style=\"width:230px;\"|Colony\n!width=\"50\"|Founded\n!width=\"50\"|Chartered\n!width=\"50\"|First instruction\n!First degrees\n! style=\"width:200px;\" |Primary religious influence\n!width=\"50\"|Ivy League\n|-\n|\n|Harvard College(Harvard University)\n|Massachusetts Bay Colony\n|1636\n|1650\n|1642\n|1642\n|Congregationalist\n|Yes\n|-\n|\n|College of William & Mary\n|Colony of Virginia\n|1693 Since William & Mary describes itself as \"America's second-oldest college\" and gives its year of founding as 1693, it does not seem to be suggesting institutional continuity with the University of Henrico, rather, W&M is providing historical perspective. However, this depends upon the orientation and competitiveness of the administration at any given time; for instance, when a Harvard grad is President, Wm & M is presented as \"second college\", but when Va grad is president, it is \"the first college in its roots\".. (This original college has been revived, in 1992, as \"Henricus Colledge (1619), America's 1st College.\".)

Five of the twelve members of Princeton's first board of trustees were very closely associated with a \"Log College\" operated by Presbyterian minister William Tennent and his son Gilbert in Bucks County, Pennsylvania from 1726 until 1746. Because the College of New Jersey and the Log College shared the same religious affiliation (a moderate element within the \"New Side\" or \"New Light\" wing of the Presbyterian Church) and there was a considerable overlap in their boards of trustees, some historians suggest that there is sufficient connection between this school and the College of New Jersey which would enable Princeton to claim a founding date of 1726. However, Princeton does not officially do so, and a university historian says that the \"facts do not warrant\" such a claim. |group=nb}}\n|1755\n|1755\n|1757\n|Church of England, but officially nonsectarian  Jencks and Riesman (2001) write: \"The Anglicans who founded the University of Pennsylvania, however, were evidently anxious not to alienate Philadelphia's Quakers, and they made their new college officially nonsectarian.\" Franklin himself was a self-described \"thorough Deist.\" Starting in 1751, the same trustees also operated a Charity School for Boys, whose curriculum combined \"general principles of Christianity\" with practical instruction leading toward careers in business and the \"mechanical arts\", and thus might be described as \"non-denominational Christian.\" The charity school was originally planned and a trust was organized on paper in 1740 by followers of traveling evangelist George Whitefield. The school intended to operate inside a church supported by the same adherents. However, the organizers ran short of financing, and although the frame of the building was raised, the interior was left unfinished. The founders of the Academy of Philadelphia purchased the unused building in 1750 for their new venture and, in the process, assumed the original trust. Since 1899, Penn has claimed a founding date of 1740, based on the organizational date of the charity school and the premise that it had institutional identity with the Academy of Philadelphia. Whitefield was a firebrand Methodist associated with the Great Awakening; since the Methodists did not formally break from the Church of England until 1784, Whitefield in 1740 would be labelled Episcopalian, and in fact Brown University, emphasizing its own pioneering nonsectarianism, refers to Penn's origin as \"Episcopalian\". Penn is sometimes assumed to have Quaker ties (its athletic teams are called \"Quakers,\" and the cross-registration alliance between Penn, Haverford, Swarthmore and Bryn Mawr is known as the \"Quaker Consortium.\") But Penn's website does not assert any formal affiliation with Quakerism, historical or otherwise, and Haverford College implicitly asserts a non-Quaker origin for Penn when it states that \"Founded in 1833, Haverford is the oldest institution of higher learning with Quaker roots in North America.\"|group=nb}}\n|Yes\n|-\n|\n|College of Rhode Island(Brown University)\n|Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations\n|1764\n|1764\n|1765\n|1765\n|Baptist, but no religious requirement for admissions|group=nb}}\n|Yes\n|-\n|\n|'''Queen's College'(Rutgers University'')\n|Province of New Jersey\n|1766\n|1766\n|1771\n|1774\n|Dutch Reformed\n|No\n|-\n|\n|Dartmouth College\n|Province of New Hampshire\n|1769\n|1769\n|1768\n|1771\n|Congregationalist\n|Yes\n|}\nOther colonial-era colleges and universities\nSeveral other colleges and universities trace their founding to colonial-era academies or schools, but are not considered colonial colleges because they were not formally chartered as colleges with degree-granting powers until after the nation's founding in 1776.

Presumably starting its life in a log cabin on what was then the nation's frontier, Hugh Henry Brackenridge sought and obtained a charter for the school from the state legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that was passed by the assembly on February 28, 1787. The school's charter was altered in 1819 to grant it university status and confer the name of the Western University of Pennsylvania. The university received its current name, the University of Pittsburgh, with a subsequent alteration to its charter in 1908.|group=nb}}\n|1770?\n|1787\n| Nonsectarian\n|-\n|'''Little Girls' School'  (Salem College'')\n|Province of North Carolina\n|1772\n|1866\n|Moravian Church\n|-\n|Dickinson College\n|Province of Pennsylvania\n|1773\n|1783\n|Presbyterian\n|-\n|Hampden–Sydney College\n|Colony of Virginia\n|1775\n|1783\n|Presbyterian\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n*First university in the United States\n*List of oldest universities in continuous operation\n*Ancient universities, oldest universities in Great Britain and Ireland\n*Ancient universities of Scotland, oldest universities in Scotland\n*Imperial Universities, oldest universities founded during the Empire of Japan\n*Sandstone universities, oldest universities in Australia\nNotes\nReferences"
