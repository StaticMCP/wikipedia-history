Before 1988, the Supreme Soviet had no meaningful political role. After its first democratic elections on 18 March 1990, the institution was renamed the Supreme Council of the Republic of Estonia on 8 May 1990.\nOrganization\nThe structure and formal functions of the Supreme Soviet of the Estonian SSR were copied from the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The sessions of the Supreme Soviet lasted only several days twice a year and decisions were made unanimously and without much discussion. Supreme Soviet elections were held after every four years until 1978 and were held every five years in 1978–1985. The Supreme Soviet gathered in Tallinn, in the Toompea Castle building which now houses the Riigikogu (as it did in interwar Estonia).\nChairmen of the Supreme Soviet\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Portrait\n!Chairman\n!From\n!To\n|-\n|\n|Voldemar Sassi\n|25 August 1940\n|1941\n|-\n|\n|August Kründel\n|5 March 1947\n|14 January 1953\n|-\n|\n|Joosep Saat\n|5 April 1955\n|23 April 1959\n|-\n|\n|Harald Ilves\n|23 April 1959\n|18 April 1963\n|-\n|\n|Vaino Väljas\n|18 April 1963\n|20 April 1967\n|-\n|\n|Arnold Koop\n|20 April 1967\n|18 December 1968\n|-\n|\n|Ilmar Vahe\n|18 December 1968\n|4 July 1975\n|-\n|\n|Johannes Lott\n|4 July 1975\n|13 December 1978\n|-\n|\n|Jüri Suurhans\n|13 December 1978\n|5 July 1982\n|-\n|\n|Matti Pedak\n|5 July 1982\n|27 March 1985\n|-\n|\n|Valde Roosmaa\n|27 March 1985\n|18 May 1989\n|-\n|\n|Enn-Arno Sillari\n|18 May 1989\n|28 March 1990\n|-\n|\n|Ülo Nugis\n|29 March 1990\n|6 October 1992\n|}\nPresidents of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet\nThe presidium was the permanent body of the Supreme Soviet.
