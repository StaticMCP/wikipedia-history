A club cricketer in Southampton for Deanery Cricket Club, he made his debut in first-class cricket for Hampshire against Lancashire at Old Trafford in the 1900 County Championship, with Newton making seventeen first-class appearances in 1900. Described by Wisden as a \"very useful batsman, [and] a most brilliant field\", he scored a total of 568 runs in these matches, at an average of 18.32; he made three half centuries, with a highest score of 69. In the field, he took eight catches. Besides playing, Newton coached cricket at Marlborough College, where amongst the students he coached there was Reggie Spooner, who would later play Test cricket for England. Newton died from pneumonia at Edinburgh in May 1906.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
