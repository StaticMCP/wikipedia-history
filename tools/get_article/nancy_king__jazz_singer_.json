When she was eight, she and her family moved to nearby Eugene, Oregon. Both of her parents were musicians.\nCareer\nShe enrolled at the University of Oregon, where she began gigging with fellow music students. After moving to San Francisco in 1960, her accomplished scat singing landed her many gigs with various bebop artists. Early in her career, began a relationship with saxophonist Sonny King and took his surname, though they never legally married. In 1978, she released her first album, First Date.\nThough The New York Times called her \"one of the country's most admired jazz vocalists\", she refused opportunities that would have brought her a higher profile or greater celebrity. As an example, she once turned down a lucrative recording contract because it would have diverted her career from her improvisational style and her regular collaborators. In an interview, she said she was proud to have not \"sold out\".\nIn 2004, King recorded her live album Live at Jazz Standard with pianist Fred Hersch, which was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album. The 2017 album Porter Plays Porter, featuring her alongside the Randy Porter Trio performing Cole Porter music, was also nominated for the Grammy. She continued to perform until at least 2019.\nPersonal life and death\nNancy and Sonny King had three sons before separating. She lived in Portland, Oregon, and died from breast cancer at a care home there on August 5, 2025, at the age of 85.\nDiscography\n* First Date, with Steve Wolfe (Inner City, 1978)\n* Impending Bloom, with Glen Moore (Justice, 1991)\n* Potato Radio, with Glen Moore (Justice, 1992)\n* Cliff Dance, with Glen Moore (Justice, 1993)\n* Straight into Your Heart, with Steve Christofferson and the Metropole Orchestra (Mons, 1996)\n* King on the Road (Cardas, 1999)\n* Moonray (Philology, 1999)\n* Dream Lands Vol. 1, with Steve Christofferson (Stellar!, 2000)\n* Dream Lands Vol. 2, with Steve Christofferson (Stellar!, 2002)\n* Live at the Jazz Standard, with Fred Hersch (Maxjazz, 2006)\n* Perennial (Ornry Diva, 2011)\nGuest appearances\nWith Karrin Allyson\n* Footprints (Concord Jazz, 2006)\nWith Ray Brown\n* Christmas Songs with the Ray Brown Trio (Telarc, 1999)\n* Some of My Best Friends Are Singers (Telarc, 1998)\nWith Roy Nathanson\n* ''Fire at Keaton's Bar and Grill (Six Degrees, 2000)\nWith Oregon\n* 45th Parallel'' (Portrait, 1989)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
