The park sits on  of land off of Everett Boulevard, near U.S. Route 51 and the proposed Interstate 69. It features exhibits and activities on local history, nature, military history, art and science.\nHistory\nDiscovery Park of America was preceded by the Obion County Museum, which was founded in 1970 and housed the historical collections of the McNatt and Harmon families of Obion County, Tennessee. The Obion County Museum was operated entirely by volunteers for 40 years. In 2005, Robert E. Kirkland, a local businessman known for cofounding the Kirkland's chain of home decor stores, approached the Obion County Museum board about the possibility of building a larger facility in Union City. Kirkland and his wife, Jenny D. Kirkland, had recently sold their portion of CBK, Ltd. (the parent company of Kirkland's) in order to concentrate on local philanthropy. Kirkland met secretly with local businessman Jack Hudgens and Obion County Museum board members Larry Mink and Polly Brasher at the Obion County Library to form a Vision Team. The secrecy of the meetings was to assure that if the idea proved unfeasible, the general public would not be disappointed.\nAfter the Vision Team made its initial plans, Canadian architect Douglas Cardinal was selected to design the new facility as well as its exhibits. The Vision Team wished for the community to be involved in the project and designated eighteen committees, composed primarily of local volunteers. Thirteen of these committees were responsible for the development of the galleries and exhibits within the museum, while five were responsible for the commercial aspects, such as accounting and marketing. Kirkland chose the name Discovery Park of America for the new facility, and asked his lifelong friend and another local businessman, Jim Rippy, to volunteer and serve as chairman of the newly developed Discovery Park of America board of directors.\nAllen Searcy Building Contractors was hired as the principal construction contractor and a groundbreaking ceremony was held on July 1, 2008 in a soybean field on the northwest edge of Union City. At this time, the park was set for completion in 2010. However, on July 8, 2009, Kirkland terminated Douglas Cardinal and construction was halted as the search began for a new architect. Months earlier, Obion County Museum board-member Polly Brasher, who by then was working as the Discovery Park of America Founding Director, had met Kurt Cederquest of Maltbie Exhibit Fabricators at a trade show in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and mentioned the project. After hearing of Cardinal's dismissal, Cederquest contacted his colleagues at Verner Johnson Museum Architects of Boston and Thinc Design of New York City to persuade them to collaborate with him on the project. The three firms made a joint pitch to Discovery Park of America which resulted in a contract in January 2010, and construction resumed on the project in December. Lou Sirianni of Verner Johnson Museum Architects was selected to design the main building, while Tom Henness of Thinc Design would oversee the design of the exhibits and gallery spaces. Kirkland instructed the teams, \"design a building that will stop traffic at 70mph.\" The building also had to include an observation tower and a grand hall. Construction continued for nearly three years. In addition to the main building, Richie Smith Landscape Architects of Memphis, Tennessee was hired to design the 50-acre heritage park surrounding the central museum, which includes two small lakes connected by a moat and a terraced series of weirs.\nThe site sits directly adjacent to the future Interstate 69 corridor and will be connected by exits immediately North and South of the park. The future interstate is meant to connect Canada to Mexico through Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, and Michigan. Union City and Discovery Park sit near the halfway point between these destinations, and the potential tourism catalyzed by the eventuality of a major roadway was taken into consideration when choosing the site of the park, as it would make day trips from St. Louis, Memphis, Evansville, and dozens of rural counties more convenient.\nIn January 2013, Jim Rippy retired from his position at an insurance company and joined Discovery Park full-time as Chief Executive Officer and expanded the staff to fill opening niches as the project neared completion. Donors, sponsors, and long-time supporters were invited to preview the park on October 15, 2013. The park opened to the public with a ribbon cutting ceremony on November 1, 2013. The design and construction had taken nearly ten years and cost approximately $80 million. The Robert E. and Jenny D. Kirkland Foundation was founded as a trust, assuring a provision of $3 million annually for a period of 20 years.\nOn December 31, 2018, Jim Rippy retired as chief executive officer, and Scott Williams was selected as his successor. Williams, a native of West Tennessee, is the former CEO of the Newseum in Washington, D.C. He also worked with Elvis Presley Enterprises, Inc. for 12 years as part of the management team at Graceland in Memphis.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020, Discovery Park closed to protect its guests and employees from the spread of the disease. The park plans to reopen to its members on May 30 and to the general public on June 1. In the meantime, park staff have shared educational and motivational content via social media. The park hosts a semester-long Historical Theater Academy twice a year, and the spring 2020 sessions are being conducted online. The park maintains an official website, a Facebook page, an Instagram, and a YouTube channel with which to share updates on the status of reopening, as well as educational content.\nIn December 2020, Discovery Park intends to unveil a new permanent exhibit in the Ag Center on the north side of the park. The exhibit is titled AgriCulture: Innovating for our Survival, and will discuss innovative techniques in the agriculture industry from the first to last step of the process. CEO Scott Williams released a statement saying, \"''We're calling this a 'mind-blowing, myth-busting farming exhibit that will change the world' and we're certain that after they experience our exhibit, guests will have a much better understanding of how food and fiber get from the farm to the family.\"\nDiscovery Park hosts the podcast series Reelfoot Forward: A West Tennessee Podcast,'' which focuses on the culture and history of West Tennessee. In each episode, CEO Scott Williams interviews a notable guest from fields such as history, education, agriculture, sports, business, and other areas.\nMuseum and Heritage Park\nDiscovery Center\nThe park's central building, Discovery Center, is a three-floor  facility that is divided into 9 permanent exhibit galleries, a traveling exhibit hall, a theater, an observation tower, a cafe, a gift shop, and 3 programming and event spaces.
