She is the granddaughter of Charles D. B. King, Liberia's 17th president.\nAkerele studied at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria and graduated from Brandeis University in Massachusetts, United States with a B.A. in economics. She earned her first M.A. from Northeastern University in manpower economics, then a second M.A. from Columbia University in economics of education. Akerele also completed her first year at the University of Liberia Louis Arthur Grimes School of Law. She later served for over 20 years at the United Nations.\nUpon the election of Sirleaf as president in 2005, Akerele was appointed the Minister of Commerce and Industry. Following a 2007 cabinet shakeup, she replaced veteran diplomat George Wallace as Minister of Foreign Affairs. On 3 November 2010, Sirleaf dismissed her entire cabinet, including Akerele. She resigned that same day. Following the appointment of Toga G. McIntosh as Akerele's successor, Sirleaf disclosed that Akerele had resigned in order to receive medical treatment for an undisclosed illness.\nand First Lady Michelle Obama at the Metropolitan Museum with Olubanke King Akerele in 2009.]]\nSources\n* [http://www.iol.co.za/index.phpset_id=1&click_id=86&art_id=nw20070823230233579C348569 \"Liberian leader reshuffles cabinet\" 24 August 2007, IOL.co.za]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101214224240/http://emansion.gov.lr/press.php?news_id=1743 \"President Sirleaf Calls Newly Reconstituted Cabinet ‘The Right People for the Job’\" 4 December 2010, emansion.gov.lr]\nExternal links\n*[http://www.mofa.gov.lr/content.php?sub=Minister's%20Profile&related=The%20Minister Profile at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs]"
