It premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on May 6, 2004.  It had a limited theatrical release in September 2006 and was released on DVD the following month, on October 24, 2006.\nSaturday Night Live alumni Rachel Dratch and Chris Parnell have small parts, while Burns regulars Connie Britton and Kevin Kash have small roles as Burns' neighbor and building superintendent, respectively.\nPremise\nA man hires a private detective, Jack, to look for his wife.

Burns said \"at the time... my ego wouldn’t allow me to do it. So, we sell the film to THINKFilm, get no money, we’re supposed to have a partnership, and we’ve never seen a red cent from it.\" This prompted Burns to sell his next film Purple Violets straight to ITunes.\nCritical reaction\nCritics were generally unimpressed by Looking for Kitty.  It has a 39% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, qualifying it as \"rotten\", and a 43 on Metacritic, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.  Elizabeth Weitzman of The New York Daily News wrote that it \"offers moments of striking insight amid the inevitable self-indulgence.\"  Noel Murray of The A.V. Club was harsher, writing, \"Burns has continued to cram one-dimensional characters into thinly plotted comedy-dramas, hoping to re-impress moviegoers with his aloof leading-man charm and faux-natural, trying-too-hard-to-be-funny dialogue.\"  Michael Atkinson of The Village Voice wrote, \"It might be the most maturely conceived role in Burns's films, but the plot around it is flimsy, the visual storytelling simpleminded, and the general ideas for character one-note.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
