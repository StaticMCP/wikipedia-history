While studying at Cambridge, he made his debut in first-class cricket for Cambridge University against Leicestershire at Fenner's in 1974. He played first-class cricket for Cambridge until 1976, making 27 appearances. Playing as an all-rounder, he scored 694 runs in his 27 appearances for Cambridge, at an average of 16.13 and a high score of 63. With his left-arm medium-fast bowling, Jackson took 42 wickets at a bowling average of 50.73. Though largely ineffective with the ball, he did take a five wicket haul against Oxford University in The University Match of 1975, with Jackson finishing with ten wickets in the match and accounting for nearly a quarter of his career first-class wicket tally in the process. Jackson also made a single first-class appearance for a combined Oxford and Cambridge Universities cricket team against the touring West Indians in 1976. In addition to playing first-class cricket while at Cambridge, he also represented the university List A one-day cricket, making four appearances in the 1974 Benson & Hedges Cup, before making two List A appearances for the Combined Universities cricket team in the 1976 Benson & Hedges Cup.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
