This is the second release on  the Pump-Kin Music label.\nThis is the official compilation from Benny Benassi's 'Canadian Bus Tour'.\n\"I wanted to do this tour across Canada in a bus and not by a plane to get to know the country better. I've played my sets in various towns over the past few years and I've always wished to come back and explore. I also thought it would be a good idea to have a kind of souvenir of my Canadian journey to share with all the people who come out and party when I play. That's the reason behind this compilation. I really hope you have as much fun listening to it as I did mixing it. Thanks, Benny\".\nTrack listing\n#Depeche Mode - \"Everything Counts\" (Oliver Huntemann & Stephen Bodzin Dub) – 6:35\n#D.I.M. - \"Sisyphos\" – 3:50\n#Ame - \"Rej\" (Pastaboys Club Mix) – 3:34\n#Bodyrox featuring Luciana - \"Yeah, Yeah\" (D.
