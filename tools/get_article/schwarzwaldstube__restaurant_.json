Since 1993, the restaurant has maintained its three-star Michelin rating, the longest streak for any restaurant in Germany. The gastronomy portal  ranked the restaurant first in Germany.\nIn 2024, Schwarzwaldstube was ranked among the world's top restaurants with 99.5 points in the La Liste ranking, sharing the position with eight other restaurants, including Guy Savoy in Paris and Le Bernardin in New York.\nHistory\nThe Schwarzwaldstube was established in 1977, with Wolfgang Staudenmaier as the head chef and Heiner Finkbeiner as the restaurant manager. Shortly after its opening, the Schwarzwaldstube earned two Michelin stars.\nIn 1980, Harald Wohlfahrt became the head chef. The restaurant was awarded three Michelin stars for the first time in the Guide Michelin 1993.\nIn 2017, Torsten Michel succeeded Harald Wohlfahrt as head chef and maintained the three-star rating.\nIn January 2020, a fire destroyed the original building of the Schwarzwaldstube, necessitating its demolition. The restaurant reopened in a temporary location named \"Temporaire\" at the end of May 2021. The original site was rebuilt, and on 8 April 2022, the Schwarzwaldstube reopened in its newly constructed premises. In 2022, the restaurant was again awarded three Michelin stars.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.traube-tonbach.de/restaurants-bar/schwarzwaldstube/ Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube]\n* [https://www.restaurant-ranglisten.de/restaurants/details/schwarzwaldstube/ Schwarzwaldstube on Restaurant-Ranglisten]\n* [https://www.sternefresser.de/restaurantkritik/2021/temporaire-schwarzwaldstube-baiersbronn-torsten-michel-2021/ Review of Schwarzwaldstube on Sternefresser]\n* [https://guide.michelin.com/gr/en/baden-wurttemberg/baiersbronn/restaurant/schwarzwaldstube Schwarzwaldstube on Michelin Guide]"
