The borough includes the two towns of Atherstone (where the council is based) and Coleshill, and the large villages of Hartshill, Kingsbury, Mancetter, Polesworth and Water Orton along with smaller villages and surrounding rural areas.\nThe area historically had a large coal mining industry, but the last coal mine in the area, Daw Mill at Arley, closed in 2013. The borough's landscape is primarily of the mildly undulating agricultural variety, with the North Warwickshire plateau rising to 177&nbsp;m (581&nbsp;ft) above sea-level at Bentley Common, 2.5 miles southwest of Atherstone. The most significant bodies of water within North Warwickshire are Kingsbury Water Park, Shustoke Reservoir, the River Blythe and the mid-section of the Coventry Canal.\nThe neighbouring districts are Nuneaton and Bedworth, Coventry, Solihull, Birmingham, Lichfield, Tamworth, North West Leicestershire and Hinckley and Bosworth.\nHistory\nThe district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, by a merger of one previous district with part of another, these were:\n*Atherstone Rural District\n*Meriden Rural District (remainder split between Solihull and Coventry in the new West Midlands county)\nThe new district was named North Warwickshire, reflecting its position in the wider county. The district was awarded borough status from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.\nGovernance\n| leader2_type      = Leader\n| leader2           = David Wright\n| party2            = Conservative\n| election2         = March 2020\n| leader3_type      = Chief Executive\n| leader3           = Steve Maxey\n| party3            =\n| election3         = March 2019\n| seats             = 35 councillors\n| structure1        = North Warwickshire Borough Council 2023.svg\n| structure1_res    = 200px\n| political_groups1 =\n;Administration (17)\n: |border=darkgray}} Conservative (17)}}\n;Other parties (18)\n: |border=darkgray}} Labour (11)\n: |border=darkgray}} Reform UK (2)\n: |border=darkgray}} Independent (5)}}\n| term_length       = 4 years\n| voting_system1    = First past the post\n| last_election1    = 4 May 2023\n| next_election1    = 6 May 2027\n| session_room      = North Warwickshire Borough Council Offices - geograph.org.uk - 609517.jpg\n| meeting_place     = Council House, South Street, Atherstone, CV91DE\n| website           =\n}}\n, the other town of the borough]]\nNorth Warwickshire Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Warwickshire County Council. The whole borough is also covered by civil parish, which form a third tier of local government.\nPolitical control\nThe council has been under no overall control since the 2023 election, being led by a Conservative minority administration with informal support from two of the three independent councillors.\nThe first elections to the council were held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=2|Party in control || Years\n|-\n|  || 1974–1976\n|-\n|  || 1976–1979\n|-\n|  || 1979–2003\n|-\n|  || 2003–2007\n|-\n|  || 2007–2011\n|-\n|  || 2011–2015\n|-\n|  || 2015–2023\n|-\n| || 2023–present\n|}\nLeadership\nThe role of mayor is largely ceremonial in North Warwickshire. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2009 have been:\n{| class=wikitable\n! Councillor !! colspan=2|Party !! From !!

Councillors\n|-\n|\n| align=center|17\n|-\n|\n| align=center|11\n|-\n|\n| align=center|2\n|-\n|\n| align=center|5\n|-\n! colspan=2|Total\n! align=center|35\n|}\nTwo of the independent councillors form the  \"Dordon Independents\" group, which supported the Conservatives in forming a minority administration in May 2023, and the other three independents form the \"North Warwickshire Independent Representatives\" group. The next elections are due in May 2027, however North Warwickshire is in an area which may be affected by proposed local government reorganisation, which may delay elections or replace the council in its entirety.\nElections\nSince the last boundary changes in 2003 the council has comprised 35 councillors representing 17 wards with each ward electing two councillors except the Arley and Whitacre ward, which elects three. Elections are held every four years.\nPremises\nThe council is based at the Council House on South Street in Atherstone. The building was purpose-built for the council and opened in 1979.\nTowns and parishes\nThe whole district is covered by 33 civil parishes. The parish councils for Atherstone and Coleshill have declared their parishes to be towns, allowing them to take the style \"town council\". Some of the parishes share a grouped parish council. The parishes are:\n*Ansley\n*Arley\n*Astley\n*Atherstone\n*Austrey\n*Baddesley Ensor\n*Baxterley\n*Bentley\n*Caldecote\n*Coleshill\n*Corley\n*Curdworth\n*Dordon\n*Fillongley\n*Great Packington\n*Grendon\n*Hartshill\n*Kingsbury\n*Lea Marston\n*Little Packington\n*Mancetter\n*Maxstoke\n*Merevale\n*Middleton\n*Nether Whitacre\n*Newton Regis\n*Over Whitacre\n*Polesworth\n*Seckington\n*Shustoke\n*Shuttington\n*Water Orton\n*Wishaw\nMedia\nTelevision\nNorth Warwickshire is served by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central with television signals received from the Sutton Coldfield TV transmitter.\nRadio\nRadio stations for the area are:\n*BBC CWR\n*BBC Radio WM\n*Capital Midlands\n*Heart West Midlands\n*Smooth West Midlands\n*Hits Radio Coventry & Warwickshire\n*Greatest Hits Radio Midlands\nCoat of arms\nThe council was granted a coat of arms in 1976.\nSee also\n*List of wards in North Warwickshire\nReferences"
