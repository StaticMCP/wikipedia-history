This vanguard unit took over the city and preparations were started to welcome it. The people of Tabriz covered the road with shawls and precious fabrics until Surhab outside Tabriz. The soldiers and the people lined up on the route applauded Yavuz Sultan Selim and the Ottoman army who entered the city on September 6, 1514.\nOn Friday, September 8, 1514, the Friday greeting was performed at the Sultan Yakub Mosque (in some sources, at the Hasan Han Mosque) and a sermon was read in the name of Yavuz Sultan Selim. Selim also ordered the repair of mosques that had been ruined due to neglect.\nOn September 12, approximately 1,000 scientists and artists began to be sent from Tabriz to Istanbul. On September 15, the Ottoman army left Tabriz and advanced towards Karabakh. The Janissaries, who opposed the idea of Yavuz Sultan Selim staying in Tabriz, also rebelled against the idea of Selim wintering in Karabakh and then marching on Iran again during the following campaign season (sources record that the Janissaries shouted around the Sultan by attaching their torn shoes and clothes to the tips of their spears, and even fired bullets into the Sultan's tent).\nReferences"
