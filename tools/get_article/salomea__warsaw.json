It was named after Salomea Kalinowska (1772–1852), wife of Kajetan Dominik Kalinowski, owner of both villages.\nBetween 1883 and 1890, the Fort V \"Włochy\" had been built between Salomea and Załuski, as part of the series of fortifications of the Warsaw Fortress, built around Warsaw by the Russian Empire. In 1909, it was decided to decommission and demolish the fortifications of the Warsaw Fortress, due to the high costs of their maintenance, and as such the Fort V had been partially demolished in 1913.\nIn 1927, the Electric Commuter Railway had built the train connection line, which connected Salomea to the nearby city of Warsaw.\nOn 5 May 1951, Salomea had been incorporated into the city of Warsaw.\nCitations\nNotes\nReferences"
