The purpose of Penn State College Republicans is to assist in the election of Republican candidates to local, state, and national office, promote conservative ideals and principles at the Pennsylvania State University, engage in community service.\nThe PSU GOP is open to both undergraduate and graduate students at Penn State University Park. They are an official registered student organization with the University. Their self-stated mission is to \"provide a platform for conservative students to connect, discuss, and advocate for their beliefs.\"\nHistory\nFounding\nThe PSU GOP was founded in 1940. The organization was not officially registered with the University as Penn State did not keep records of student organizations until the 1970's.\nReestablishment\nAfter the Watergate Scandal and resignation of President Richard Nixon, the Penn State College Republicans went defunct and ceased to operate. For three years, there were no College Republicans on campus at Penn State University Park. During his freshman year, Rick Santorum became involved with Republican politics by working on various political campaigns. This led him to reestablish the Penn State College Republicans in 1977.\nThe club existed without official recognition from Penn State until December 12th, 1979. Since this date, there has been no lapse in its recognition and existence at Penn State, maintaing a minimum of ten undergraduate, active members.\nAffiliation\nNational\nWhen the Penn State College Republicans was established in 1940, it chartered with the College Republican National Committee (CRNC). This remained to be the case until June 16th, 2024, when the Pennsylvania Federation of College Republicans (PAFCR) left the CRNC to join the National Federation of College Republicans (NFCR). The CRNC controversially stripped the voting rights of several state federations that backed the election of Judah Waxelbaum over Courtney Britt for CRNC Chairman. Among those disqualified were Texas, New York, Mississippi, North Dakota, and Puerto Rico, who all voted to secede following Britt's election. This drove the Penn State College Republicans to join with the rest of the PAFCR to leave the CRNC.\nMembership in the National Federation of College Republicans was short lived, however. After the 2024 election season had concluded, the PAFCR voted to officially leave the NFCR and join the College Republicans of America (CRA). This was caused by the alleged infighting and weak leadership of the Chairwoman Rachel Howard of NFCR, with PAFCR stating that they do \"not wish to waste time in political battles between various College Republican organizations... only the CRA has placed the success of the Republican Party and our candidates over this type of infighting.\" Acting President of the CRA at the time, Gabriel Guidarini, commented on the move, stating \"It was a pleasure to work with them extensively during the election cycle, and we are proud to have them join us today.\" The Penn State College Republicans applauded this decision and moved forward with a charter under the College Republicans of America with the rest of Pennsylvania.\nState\nIn their Constitution, the Penn State College Republicans maintains \"a working relationship with the Pennsylvania State Federation of College Republicans so long as it exists.\"\nLeadership\nExecutive Board\nThe Executive Board of the Penn State College Republicans is elected yearly at the end of the Spring Semester. All active members of the organization are eligible to run for and vote for the elected positions. The only position on the Executive Board that is not elected is the Chief of Staff, who also does not have a vote on the Executive Board. This position is appointed by the President at the beginning of the Fall Semester and is traditionally a First-Year Student.\nCurrent Executive Board\n* Tristin Kilgore, President\n* Hunter Steach, Vice President\n* Emma Smorgonsky, Treasurer\n* Neve McAllister, Secretary\n* Mia Humphreys, Director of Special Events\n* Vacant, Chief of Staff\nCabinet\nIn addition to the Executive Board, the PSU GOP maintains a number of positions appointed by the President and confirmed by the Executive Board to aid with the management of the organizations. These Cabinet Directors include, but are not limited to, Political Director, Communications Director, Fundraising Director, and Press Secretary.\nCurrent Cabinet\n* David Washabaugh VI, Civic Engagement Alliance Liaison\nList of Presidents\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!Name\n!Term\n!# of Terms\n!Class\n!School\n|-\n|Tristin Kilgore\n|2025-Present\n|1\n|2027\n|Liberal Arts\n|-\n|Ryan Klein\n|2023-2025\n|2\n|2025\n|Liberal Arts & Schreyer\n|-\n|Matt Soska\n|2022-23\n|1\n|2023\n|Liberal Arts & Schreyer\n|-\n|Morgan (Watt) Clark\n|2021-22\n|1\n|2022\n|Agricultural Sciences\n|-\n|Jordan Clark\n|2020-21\n|1\n|2021 & 2022\n|Bellisario & Smeal\n|-\n|Max Myers\n|2019-20\n|1\n|2020\n|Liberal Arts\n|-\n|Reagan McCarthy\n|2018-19\n|1\n|2019\n|Liberal Arts\n|-\n|Grant Worley\n|2017-18\n|1\n|2018\n|Engineering\n|-\n|Michael Straw\n|2016-17\n|1\n|2017\n|Liberal Arts\n|-\n|Brad Simmons\n|Spring 2016\n|0.5\n|2016\n|Liberal Arts\n|-\n|Darian (Gist) David\n|2015-16\n|1.5\n|2016\n|Education\n|-\n|Brandon Matsnev\n|2014-15\n|1\n|2015\n|Liberal Arts\n|-\n|Jordan Harris\n|2012-14\n|2\n|2014\n|\n|-\n|Josh Crawford\n|2010-12\n|2\n|2012\n|Liberal Arts\n|-\n|David Frantz\n|Spring 2010\n|0.5\n|2010\n|Liberal Arts\n|-\n|Alex Smith\n|2008-09\n|1\n|\n|\n|-\n|Brandon Means\n|2007-08\n|1\n|\n|\n|-\n|Todd Taylor\n|2006-07\n|1\n|\n|\n|-\n|Seth Bender\n|Fall 2006\n|0.5\n|\n|\n|-\n|Andy Banducci\n|2004-06\n|2\n|2006\n|\n|-\n|Rich Pastena\n|Spring 2004\n|0.5\n|\n|\n|-\n|Brian Battaglia\n|Fall 2003\n|0.5\n|2004\n|\n|-\n|Chris Miller\n|2002-03\n|1\n|2004\n|\n|-\n|Mike Gallo\n|2001-02\n|1\n|2003\n|\n|-\n|T.J.

Gaps in time are due to a lack of information and does not represent the active status of the organization, unless otherwise noted.\nThere have been seven Presidents to serve two distinct terms. No President has yet to serve three terms or two non-consecutive terms. A recent amendment to their Constitution has prevented any President from serving more than two full terms.\nActivities\nElections\nPSU GOP is primarily known for managing local and statewide get-out-the-vote efforts, as well as its campus activism. The chapter traditionally tables use door-to-door canvassing, phone banking, and word of mouth to identify and register Republican voters.\nTheir efforts during the 2024 Presidential election showcased the height of their election activities. PSU GOP planned and carried out multiple College Republican deployments across Pennsylvania. Most notably was their deployment to Pittsburgh on behalf of President Trump, Dave McCormick, and Rob Mercuri. This brought together students from the Pennsylvania Federation of College Republicans, the Ohio College Republican Federation, the College Republicans of Virginia, and the District of Columbia College Republicans to turn out low propensity Republican voters. During this deployment, 16 College Republican chapters knocked on 2,500+ doors, setting a single day record during the election in Pennsylvania. Congressman Glenn \"GT\" Thompson commended this deployment as the \"largest College Republican door knocking effort\" during the election cycle. PSU GOP also helped to bring President Trump to Penn State's campus in the first visit from a major Presidential candidate since Barack Obama in 2008, which Congressman GT also recognized during his speech at the rally.\nPennsylvania Collegiate Leadership Conference\nOverview\nIn 2024, the Penn State College Republicans launched the Pennsylvania Collegiate Leadership Conference as an annual initiative to introduce collegiate leader to the conservative principles of American government and to develop them into the future leaders. The Pennsylvania Collegiate Leadership Conference seeks to be an event for any individual that wants to learn more about these conservative principles.\nNotable Speakers\n* Glenn Thompson, Congressman (PA-15)\n* Rob Bresnahan, Congressman (PA-08)\n* Dan Meuser, Congressman (PA-09)\n* Stacy Garrity, Pennsylvania Treasurer\n* Timothy DeFoor, Pennsylvania Auditor General\n* Fred Keller, Former Congressman (PA-12)\n* Rick Santorum, former U.S. Senator (R-PA)\n* Greg Rothman, PA State Senator and Chairman of PA GOP\n* Cris Dush, PA State Senator\n* Joe Picozzi, PA State Senator\n* Jesse Topper, PA House Republican Leader\n* Jake Corman, Former PA Senate President Pro-Tempore\nEndorsements\n2024\nDuring the 2024 Presidential election, the Penn State College Republicans made multiple endorsements. The earliest of which was for Dave McCormick for US Senate in October 2023, following his endorsement by PA GOP. The following year came the endorsement of Donald Trump on March 12, 2024, once he became the presumptive nominee with his victory in the Washington Primary election.

Most notably, they publicly announced their opposition to the election of Donald Trump, the 2016 Republican Party nominee and eventual winner of the election, as the president of the United States. Along with 13 other College Republicans chapters who declined to endorse Trump or endorsed another candidate for President. This marked the first time in the organization's history that they did not endorse the Republican nominee for President.\nNotable Members\n* Rick Santorum, former U.S. Senator (R-PA) and former Presidential Candidate\n* Vincent Yakowicz, former Pennsylvania Solicitor General and former Secretary of Revenue of Pennsylvania\n* Donald McClure, Chairman of McClure Consulting and Perry County GOP Chairman\n* Dr. David Winkler, Naval Historian and former US Navy Commander\nReferences"
