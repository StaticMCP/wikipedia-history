Created by Otto Binder and C. C. Beck, he originally first appeared in Fawcett Comics’ Captain Marvel Adventures in October 1951, and appeared from then until 1953 when the company ceased publishing its superhero titles. DC later acquired Fawcett's properties, and revived the character in the 1970s.\nPublication history\nCreated by writer Otto Binder and artist C. C. Beck, King Kull's first appearance was in Captain Marvel Adventures #125 (cover-dated October 1951). King Kull appeared in adventures of Captain Marvel during the 1950s and the period in which DC Comics revived the hero during the 1970s.\nFictional character biography\nAccording to one account, King Kull is ruler of the Submen (also called Beast-Men), a brutish but technologically advanced race who ruled humanity until they were overthrown in a revolt, as the humans vastly outnumbered them and killed all the other Beast-Men. Kull fakes his death with a bomb and survives until the 20th century in suspended animation in a cavern, then awakens due to an earthquake and repeatedly threatens the human-dominated modern world with his immense strength, durability, and technology. However, other versions claim he emerged throughout human history and attempted to stop the spread of democracy, and is apparently the basis for the Bogeyman and other mythical monsters.\nHe is usually thwarted by Captain Marvel or the Marvel Family. On one occasion, he collaborated with Doctor Sivana. On another occasion, he released the Seven Deadly Enemies of Man and used Sin bombs to try destroying the world. King Kull once tried to turn Billy to stone.\nOne particularly well-planned escapade requires the efforts of the Justice League of America and the Justice Society of America (in one of their dimension-crossing team-ups, which DC produced annually from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s), as well as a group of heroes of Captain Marvel and King Kull's home universe of Earth-S, referred to unofficially as the Squadron of Justice. Kull has captured both the wizard Shazam who grants the Marvel Family's powers and the ancient gods and goddesses the powers are drawn from after gaining access to the Rock of Eternity with a faster-than-light ship, paralyzing them with a device that slowed down their impulses, except for Mercury, who was able to get away in time; after Shazam makes telepathic communication with him he warns other heroes from the three Earths about Kull. Johnny Thunder's Thunderbolt helps the Marvels get their powers back in the final issue and transports them to the Rock of Eternity. Kull recruits the aid of villains from the three Earths to cause havoc. They are all defeated, and the heroes then head to the Rock of Eternity, with Superman leading the attack. Kull is imprisoned with magic chains that supposedly even Hercules cannot break, and the heroes return to their own worlds.\nFollowing the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths, Kull does not appear for many years. He makes his first appearance in over 20 years in Justice League: Cry For Justice, where he battles Stargirl and Cyclone as part of a massive plot by Prometheus to distract Earth's superheroes so that he can plant massive teleportation devices in various cities.\nIn the \"DC Rebirth\" relaunch, King Kull originates from the Earthlands and is a member of the Monster Society of Evil. He states that his species used to rule the Earthlands. In the \"Dawn of DC\" initiative, Kull is given a vastly different design, having pointed ears, fangs, and claws, while his Submen are smaller, scrawnier, and gray-furred.\nPowers and abilities\nKing Kull has enhanced strength, stamina, and durability. He possesses superhuman intelligence and is an expert at unarmed combat. He additionally has access to an advanced airship.\nRelated characters\nPrior to King Kull, there have been some characters that had his traits:\n* A race of prehistoric men who were frozen for millennia at the North Pole before being resurrected by explorer Rodney Stark.\n* The Beast-Ruler is a villain created by Sivana who possesses the abilities of various animals.\n* Kull, the God of Crime, also fought Captain Marvel. He resided in the Underworld and planned crimes against mankind. Apart from the name he had little in common.\nOther versions\nKing Kull appears in Billy Batson and the Magic of Shazam! #6.\nIn other media\nA character partially inspired by King Kull named 'Kru'll the Eternal' appears in Batman: The Brave and the Bold'', voiced by Michael Dorn. Following his introduction in the episode \"Menace of the Conqueror Caveman!\", he joins the Monster Society of Evil in the episode \"The Malicious Mr. Mind!\".\nReferences"
