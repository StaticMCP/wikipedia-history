Like Axess, Stream consists of only one part with 51 episodes. Currently, there are no plans for an English adaptation of the series, but they did reuse some background elements in MegaMan Star Force.\nStream premiered in Japan on October 2, 2004, exactly one week after Axess concluded. It ran until September 24, 2005. Midway through the series, the 50-minute feature film Rockman EXE: Program of Light and Dark premiered in Japanese theaters on March 12, 2005.

However, because of Dex and Dingo's appearance in the movie, it most likely occurs shortly after episode 22 in which the boys move to DenTech City, but not after episode 29 when elements from the movie begin appearing in the series, specifically those concerning Baryl and Colonel.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"98%\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Title\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Directed by\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Written by\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Premiere date\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | DVD release date\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" bgcolor=\"#efefef;\"|\n|-\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" |\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Takao Kato\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Kenichi Araki\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | March 12, 2005\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | September 21, 2005\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |\nBeams of light are tearing through cities all over the world, deconstructing anything they touch into network data. Dr. Hikari recognizes this as the dreaded \"Spectrum\" program, and he commands Lan to quickly rush and destroy something called the \"Tadashi Hikari\" program. As MegaMan rushes to do so, Bass assaults him, but Colonel intervenes. The destruction of the program is interrupted when a large beast named Nebula Grey appears and absorbs it, causing the NetNavis to retreat. Just then, the Spectrum beams tear through an amusement park, deconstructing many of Lan's friends. Dr. Regal reappears, having transformed into a data being after his demise with LaserMan in Axess, and plans to extract the programming written on Dr. Hikari's retinal pattern, completing Spectrum and transforming the planet into network data. Lan, Chaud, and Raika work together to infiltrate a Netopian army base where Dr. Regal goes through with his plan, and Lan encounters a man named Baryl who claims to be Colonel's NetOp. MegaMan jacks-in to the core of the program to stop Regal, and Bass also appears. In a pinch, MegaMan sacrifices his Ultimate Program to Bass, hoping he can defeat Nebula Grey with it. The resulting fusion creates BassCross MegaMan, a being that obliterates Nebula Grey and spoils Regal's plan. The military base begins to crumble, and Bass absorbs Nebula Grey's power for himself. The NetSavers and Dr. Hikari escape, but Baryl remains behind, uttering the reassuring claim that he is \"immortal.\" Everything deconstructed by Spectrum returns to normal, and peace is restored.\n|}\nNotes"
