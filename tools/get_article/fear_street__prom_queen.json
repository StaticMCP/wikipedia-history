Produced by Chernin Entertainment, it is the fourth installment in the Fear Street film series. The film stars India Fowler, Suzanna Son, Fina Strazza, David Iacono, Ella Rubin, Chris Klein, Ariana Greenblatt, Lili Taylor and Katherine Waterston. Set in 1988, the plot focuses on a masked killer who targets the prom queen candidates of Shadyside High on the night of their senior dance.\nFollowing the release of the original trilogy, discussions began about future films set within the same continuity. In October 2023, R. L. Stine announced further films to be in development, with the fourth installment being a standalone story and Chloe Okuno expected to direct. By March 2024, casting had been announced for principal characters, with McLeary and Palmer hired to adapt The Prom Queen and Palmer as director. Filming took place in Toronto and Hamilton from March to May 2024.\nFear Street: Prom Queen was released on Netflix on May 23, 2025, and was panned by critics, who named it inferior to the original three films.\nPlot\nIn 1988, the senior class of Shadyside High School prepares for their prom. Lori Granger signs up to run for prom queen against the popular girl group nicknamed the \"Wolfpack\", consisting of ruthless queen bee Tiffany Falconer and her friends Melissa Mckendrick, Debbie Winters, and Linda Harper. Lori is outcast by fellow students due to rumors of her mother murdering her father, though she was deemed innocent. Vice Principal Brekenridge intends for the prom to reinvent Shadyside in spite of the town's poor reputation. The night before prom, candidate Christy Renault, who is also a local small-time marijuana dealer, is stabbed and killed by a masked assailant.\nThe following day, Lori attends the prom with her best friend Megan Rogers. Later, Megan stages a prank using a moulded copy of Tiffany's head, creating a rift between her and Lori. Meanwhile, Linda and her boyfriend are mutilated and killed by the assailant in a nearby classroom. Lori receives flowers from an anonymous sender before Tiffany harasses her about her mother's past. Debbie and her boyfriend Judd head to the basement, where the assailant kills Judd and electrocutes Debbie in the power room.\nAfter Melissa helps Lori fix her makeup, Tiffany ends their friendship and ruins Melissa's dress. Lori and Tiffany engage in a dance-off, during which Lori wins over the crowd and Tiffany is left embarrassed. Her boyfriend Tyler breaks up with her and approaches Lori, who harbors feelings for him. Meanwhile, Melissa is killed in the girls' changing room, revealing there are two masked assailants. Megan interrupts Lori, suspecting the disappearances of the prom candidates to be a serial killing carried out by Brekenridge's devoutly religious son, Devlin. Lori rejects Megan's theory and the two distance themselves.\nLater, Megan investigates the basement where she finds the bodies of Debbie, Judd, and janitor Stoker. Lori and Tyler head to the auditorium where Tyler tries to initiate sex. However, the assailant plunges a knife into Tyler’s skull, killing him, and chases Lori. She finds Megan screaming in the basement, but they are locked inside. After a brief chase, they escape through a window and rush to the prom room to warn everyone.\nLori is announced as prom queen just as she tries to warn the school. The assailant arrives, killing students Claire and Gerald, and severing Principal Wayland’s arm, but he survives. Lori uses the tiara crown to stab the assailant, who is unmasked as Tiffany's father, Dan Falconer.\nThe police arrive and arrest Dan, while Megan is taken to the hospital. Lori returns home and stays with Tiffany, who apologizes for her behavior. Nancy, Tiffany's mother, returns and reveals herself as the second killer. As Lori and Tiffany hide, Tiffany tries to stab Lori, revealing that she was also involved. Nancy explains that she killed Lori's father after he broke up with her for Lori's mother. Lori pushes Tiffany through the stairwell, impaling her on a hallway decoration below. Nancy and Lori engage in a brief struggle before Lori bludgeons her with a trophy and flees the house. As Nancy dies, her blood forms the Witch's Mark.\nCast\nProduction\nIn July 2022, R. L. Stine stated that there are discussions for additional films being developed beyond the initial Fear Street trilogy. In December, it was reported that Chloe Okuno would direct an upcoming Fear Street installment, and that Chernin Entertainment would return to produce.\nIn October 2023, Stine stated that the film series will continue with additional Fear Street installments in development. This was confirmed by Scott Stuber when he revealed that the next installment would be a standalone film from R. L. Stine's Fear Street book series. In January 2024, Stine confirmed that the project was in the works and that it was adapting The Prom Queen, specifically, from the series. In March, the film was titled Fear Street: Prom Queen. The screenplay was adapted by Donald McLeary and Matt Palmer, who would also direct.\nWith the title announcement, the initial cast was revealed to include India Fowler, Suzanna Son, Fina Strazza, David Iacono, Ella Rubin, Chris Klein, Lili Taylor, and Katherine Waterston. Additional reports revealed that Ariana Greenblatt had joined the cast as well. Principal photography began in Toronto on March 25, 2024, continued into Hamilton  and wrapped on May 14.\nMusic\nRelease\nFear Street: Prom Queen was released on Netflix on May 23, 2025.\nReception\nOn Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 41 out of 100 based on 15 critic reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\nAlison Forman writing for Indiewire, described the film as \"flirty and fiendish\", and graded it a B+. She wrote: \"when total commitment collides with enough gore and guts, this wonderfully energetic soiree sidesteps tired tropes to reach a royally dark place\". She also noted that Palmer's direction \"rules as definitive proof there is more fun to be had adapting this spooky book series\" and expressed the possibility of Netflix releasing future Fear Street films annually. Clint Worthington for RogerEbert.com unfavorably compared the film to its predecessors, describing it as an \"enormous step-down\" and criticized Palmer's direction. He added: \"Fear Street started as a series that tried to reinvent the wheel, even just by dint of its structure and nods to the innate curse of marginalization; this is empty-headed, straightforward slasher schlock on purpose\".\nDennis Harvey of Variety noted its influences, but argued that \"Fear Street: Prom Queen never rises above its pedestrian concept, which simply lifts cliches from standard slice-and-dice opuses, as well as high school satires like Heathers and Mean Girls, without ever figuring just how seriously it wants to take them\". In addition, he criticized the characters as one-dimensional and the final climax to be \"over-the-top\" and the film's lack of campiness. However, he commended the performances and added: \"That's not the fault of the competent, generally well-cast actors — doing their best, even if you may lament the veteran talent wasted — but rather with the film's tonal uncertainty\".\nNatalia Keogan of The AV Club was more critical, and graded the film a \"D\", describing it as \"a drab, muddled mess, where trite clichés and tepid cinematography are what truly deserve to die\". She especially criticized the film's cinematography for not capturing the 1980s' aesthetics and concluded: \"Void of genre send-ups, visual finesse, '80s styling, or horror's requisite bloodshed, Fear Street: Prom Queen doesn’t even possess the distinction of attempting to emulate horror films from the decade it's set in. This Netflix Original dud could only ever aspire to be a copycat killer, but even then, it doesn’t have the guts.\"\nLuna Guthrie of Collider was more positive, saying that the film is \"not breaking any new ground, but Prom Queen is a solid enough teen slasher that does a nice job of continuing the ever-expanding universe of R.L. Stine\". She especially praised the performances of Strazza and Waterston, writing that \"They're a great duo to watch, and the movie gives them just enough material to really make an impact\". She also commends the film's characterization, adding that \"even movies that aim to appeal to the most basic tenets of entertainment can do so with an element of sophistication\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
