He is known for his soap opera performances, playing Charlie Stubbs in Coronation Street (2003–2007) and James Barton in Emmerdale (2013–2017). His stage work includes West End roles in Spamalot (2007), Viva Forever! (2012), Million Dollar Quartet (2016), and ''Everybody's Talking About Jamie (2019), as well as national tours of Shakespeare in Love, Legally Blonde (both 2017–2018), and The Full Monty (2023–2024). Outside acting, Ward is a noted photographer.\nEarly life\nWard was educated at Oundle School and then Bristol University, where he obtained a degree in Modern British History. He worked as an advertising executive before beginning his professional acting career.\nCareer\nHaving already worked extensively in theatre, Ward joined the cast of the long-running ITV soap opera Coronation Street'' in 2003, portraying local builder and serial womaniser Charlie Stubbs. His character was involved in two major coercive abuse storylines: first involving his fiancé Shelley Unwin, and later his girlfriend Tracy Barlow. To ensure authenticity, Ward worked closely with the charity Women's Aid during this period, becoming an ambassador for them. Stubbs was subsequently murdered by Barlow, with Ward departing the show in January 2007.\nWard's second regular soap role was that of charismatic farmer James Barton in Emmerdale, beginning in 2013. After announcing three years later that he had quit the series, Ward's character was killed off—dying in a car crash; an elaborate stunt filmed at Pinewood Studios—in October 2016. His other television credits include guest-starring roles in Jonathan Creek, ''Footballers' Wives, EastEnders, The Bill, Holby City, Midsomer Murders, Heartbeat, Casualty, Silent Witness, After Life, Vera, and Doctors.\nFollowing national theatre tours of Shakespeare in Love and Legally Blonde between 2018 and 2019, Ward played retired drag queen Hugo Battersby (aka Loco Chanelle) in the musical Everybody's Talking About Jamie, from July to September 2019 at the Apollo Theatre. It was revealed the following year that Ward had briefly undertaken work as a delivery driver for Tesco—alongside teaching film and drama students—after several acting jobs he had scheduled were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Next, he appeared in a 29-date tour of the musical The Full Monty (2023–2024), receiving strong reviews for his portrayal of Gerald, and headlined Jack and the Beanstalk at Bridlington Spa from December 2024 to January 2025.\nFilmography\nFilm\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
