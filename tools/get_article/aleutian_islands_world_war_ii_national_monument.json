The monument was initially created as part of World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument in 2008 by an executive order of President George W. Bush.

The Aleutian Islands campaign was the only campaign of World War II which was fought on North American soil.\nOn December 5, 2008, a Presidential Proclamation made by President George W. Bush created the World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument. The monument included sites in Alaska, California and Hawaii.

Kiska Island is home to the largest intact collection of Japanese artillery pieces in the world and Atka Island contains the crash site and remains of a B-24D Liberator aircraft, one of only two known to still be in existence. The Islands were already managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service as part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge which was created by President William H. Taft in 1913.\nSeparate monuments were created for each state in 2019 when the John D. Dingell Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act was signed into law.\nLocations\nThe national monument includes three sites:\n* Battle of Attu battlefield remnants on Attu Island (four areas totaling )\n* Japanese Occupation Site on Kiska Island and Little Kiska Island (five areas totaling )\n* Atka B-24D Liberator crash site on Atka Island (one area of )\nSee also\n* Aleutian World War II National Historic Area\n* List of national monuments of the United States\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.fws.gov/refuge/alaska-maritime/ww2-aleutian Aleutian Islands World War II National Monument] - official FWS site\n*[https://www.fws.gov/fieldnotes/regmap.cfm?arskey=25333 New monument announcement]  as part of Valor in the Pacific\n*[https://npshistory.com/publications/foundation-documents/valr-ak-fs-2010.pdf U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service − Foundation Statement–Alaska Unit, World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument]"
