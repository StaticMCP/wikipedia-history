This Atlantic hurricane season saw a near-average number of named tropical storms,|group=\"nb\"}} though five of them became dangerous hurricanes of Category&nbsp;4 intensity on the 5-level Saffir–Simpson scale, the most in a single season since 1886. The season officially began on June&nbsp;1, 1999 and ended on November&nbsp;30, 1999. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most tropical systems form. This season's first storm, Tropical Storm Arlene, formed on June&nbsp;11, while the last, Hurricane Lenny, dissipated on November&nbsp;23.\nAltogether, 12 tropical storms formed during the season, including eight hurricanes of which five intensified into major hurricanes.) and higher on the 5-level Saffir–Simpson wind speed scale are considered major hurricanes.|group=\"nb\"}} There were also four tropical depressions that did not reach tropical storm strength. The most significant hurricane of the season was Hurricane Floyd, which caused devastating flooding along the East Coast of the United States, especially in North Carolina, which had been hit only ten days earlier by Hurricane Dennis. Another strong hurricane, Hurricane Lenny became the strongest November Atlantic hurricane on record, and maintained a west-to-east track through the Caribbean for nearly its entire duration. Because of its unusual path, it developed the nickname \"Wrong Way Lenny.\" The deadliest tropical cyclone of the season was Tropical Depression Eleven, whose heavy rain and resultant flooding caused 400 deaths in Mexico. Following the 1999 season, the names Floyd and Lenny were retired from reuse in the North Atlantic by the World Meteorological Organization.\nThis timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. It includes information that was not released throughout the season, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not initially warned upon, has been included.\nBy convention, meteorologists use one time zone when issuing forecasts and making observations: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and also use the 24-hour clock (where 00:00 = midnight UTC). In this time line, all information is listed by UTC first with the respective local time included in parentheses.\nTimeline\nJune\nJune 1\n* The 1999 Atlantic hurricane season officially begins.\nJune 11\n* 18:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;p.m. AST)Tropical Depression One forms about 535&nbsp;mi (860&nbsp;km) southeast of Bermuda.\nJune 12\n* 15:00&nbsp;UTC (11:00&nbsp;a.m. AST)Tropical Depression One strengthens into Tropical Storm Arlene about 510&nbsp;mi (820&nbsp;km) southeast of Bermuda.\non June&nbsp;13]]\nJune 13\n* 06:000&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;a.m. AST)Tropical Storm Arlene attains its peak intensity with sustained winds of  60&nbsp;mph (95&nbsp;km/h) and a barometric pressure of 1006 mbar (hPa;
