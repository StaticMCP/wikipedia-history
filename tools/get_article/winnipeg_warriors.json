They were founded as an expansion team in 1980, but suffered from attendance problems competing with the Winnipeg Jets of the National Hockey League and ultimately moved to Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan in 1984, becoming the Moose Jaw Warriors. During their time in Winnipeg, the team played at Winnipeg Arena. Winnipeg's struggles at the gate were matched by the Warriors' futility on the ice, as the franchise qualified for the playoffs only once in their four years in Winnipeg: a three-game sweep at the hands of the Lethbridge Broncos in 1983.  The Warriors 1983–84 record of 9–63–0 is the second-worst 72 game mark in league history. Only the Victoria Cougars' record of 5–65–2 in 1989–90 was worse.\nSeason-by-season record\nNote: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
