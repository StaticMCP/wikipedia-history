By having its own ministry, the Corps were able to acquire a powerful voice in the cabinet of Iran. It also implied greater regulation and supervision over the Corps by placing its acquisitions and purchases under and the audit and purview of the government.\nIt mirrored the existing parallel Ministry of National Defence (the word \"National\" was dropped in 1984) which solely supported and addressed the administrative affairs of the Iranian Army (Artesh) during these years. In 1989, it was dissolved and reintegrated into the Ministry of Defence and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL), in order to centralize military logistics among the Iranian Armed Forces.\nMinisters\n| ref               =\n}}\n| ref               =\n}}\n| ref               =\n}}\nSee also\n* Economic activities of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps\n* Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps\n* Pasdar (IRGC)\nReferences"
