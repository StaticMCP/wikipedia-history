Discovery France, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery International. It launched on 11 February 2016 as Toonami, based on the Cartoon Network/Adult Swim programming block of the same name in the United States, and was originally targeted at children before shifting to mature audiences in 2020. The channel adopted its current branding on 4 September 2023.\nHistory\nOn 3 February, it was confirmed by Toonami Squad in an email with Turner that Toonami would be launching in France on 11 February 2016. For its first four years on-air, the channel's programming was geared toward young children and teenagers. It also used the logo introduced by the original block in 2004, as well as branded promos that were first used for the Southeast Asian feed.\nDuring evenings, the channel was branded as Toonami Unlimited, airing programs and several All Elite Wrestling events (which are not produced by Warner Bros. Discovery, but air on their channels in the United States) with little to no censorship. On 24 July 2019, an Adult Swim block began airing nightly from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m. CET, followed by adding live-action series and AEW Dynamite to Toonami Unlimited's programming.\nIn September 2020, Toonami underwent a rebrand and shifted its target audience to teenagers and young adults, with its programs no longer subject to censorship during the daytime. On 14 September, the channel was added to StarTimes, being available alongside its English-language African counterpart.\nOn 10 January 2023, Toonami was dropped from Canal+, following a failure of negotiations for the renewal of Warner channels.\nOn 28 June 2023, it was announced that Toonami France would be replaced by Warner TV Next on 4 September, becoming part of the Warner TV franchise that exists in other European, Asian, and Latin American countries.\nFollowing the launch of HBO Max in June 2024, the channel was made available trough the service for all HBO Max subscribers.\nVisual identity\nFile:Toonami Asia logo.png|Logo used from 2016 to 2020\nFile:Toonami (French TV channel) logo.png|Logo used from 2020 to 2023\nFile:Warner TV Next logo.png|Current logo used from 2023\nProgramming\nAdult Swim\nReferences"
