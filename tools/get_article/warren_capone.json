Instead of signing a rookie free agent contract for a team in the National Football League, he opted to sign with the Birmingham Americans of the World Football League.\nAs a rookie in 1974, Capone became the Americans starting middle linebacker, where he was known for his hard-hitting. The team finished the regular season with a record of 15-5 and became the inaugural World Football League champions.\nIn 1975, the Americans were replaced as the Birmingham WFL franchise by a new team called the Birmingham Vulcans. He was the leader of the defense, until the WFL folded in mid-season.\nDallas Cowboys\nOn November 22, 1975, he was signed as a free agent by the Dallas Cowboys of the NFL. He was a backup linebacker and was mostly used on special teams. He played on Super Bowl X and blocked a punt in the game. He became the only player to have participated in the championship games of both the WFL and NFL.\nOn August 4, 1976, he was traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in exchange for a conditional draft choice (not exercised).\nTampa Bay Buccaneers\nIn 1976, he was waived by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers before the start of the season on September 5.\nNew Orleans Saints\nOn October 26, 1976, he signed with the New Orleans Saints as a free agent. He returned a fumble for a touchdown during the season. He was released on September 6, 1977.\nPersonal life\nOn December 1, 2005, he started coaching High School Football at Christian Life Academy. In his third season, Capone was named coach of the year, after guiding Christian Life Academy to a state Class 1A second-place finish and a 12–2 record, just two years after the Crusaders finished 0–9.
