The event was scheduled to take place on 5 and 6 October 2021 but on 31 August 2021, but delayed to 19 May 2022.\n17 award categories will be presented, two more from 2019 with the Inaugural Tina Arena Special Impact Award and Live Production Touring Award being added. Nominations opened on 25 May 2021 and close on 6 July. The Tina Arena Special Impact Award named after Tina Arena, will honour an unsung champion (working diligently and tirelessly, with little recognition) whose personal journey, contribution and service to industry has had an extensive impact on the Australian music community as a whole. In May 2021, Arena said, \"I believe that by working together, alongside the leadership of AWMA, we have an unprecedented opportunity to improve the culture of the Australian music industry for the better, and pave the way for more women to be recognised across the sector.\"\nQueensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk expressed her excitement saying \"It is wonderful to see this fantastic showcase of female talent, proudly supported by the Queensland Government, back on Australia's events calendar.\"\nThe finalists were announced on 31 August 2021.\nAWMA Honour Roll\n* Olivia Newton-John\nNominees and winners\nAWMA Awards\nWinners indicated in boldface, with other nominees in plain.\n{| class=wikitable style=\"width=\"100%\"\n|+Full list of nominees\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Lifetime Achievement Award\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Humanitarian Award\n|-\n|\n*Deborah Cheetham\n**Kate Ceberano\n**Keri McInerney\n|\n*Leigh Carriage\n**Nancy Bates\n**Gemma Farrell\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Diversity in Music Award\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Studio Production Award\n|-\n|\n*Eliza Hull\n**Mindy Meng Wang\n**Alice Ivy\n|\n*Alice Ivy\n**Antonia Gauci\n**Becki Whitton\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Live Creative Production Award\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Live Production Touring Award\n|-\n|\n*Kait Hall\n**Annie Peterson\n**Jenny Moon\n|\n*'''Casey O'Shaughnessy\n**Sophie Kirov\n**Fanny Lumsden\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Music Leadership Award\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Songwriter Award\n|-\n|\n*Sahara Herald\n**Marianna Annas\n**Jodie Feld\n|\n*Tania Doko\n**Dami Im\n**Lisa Young\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Music Photographer Award\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Film-maker Award\n|-\n|\n*Cybele Malinowski\n**Brittany Long\n**Michelle Pitiris\n|\n*Lucy Knox\n**Aimée-Lee Xu Hsien Curran\n**Natalie van den Dungen\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Artistic Excellence Award\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Creative Leadership Award\n|-\n|\n*Elena Kats-Chernin\n**Katie Noonan\n**Eve Klein\n|\n*Emily Ulman\n**Annie Peterson\n**Vanessa Hughes\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Excellence in Classical Music Award\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Music Journalist Award\n|-\n|\n*Genevieve Lacey\n**Elena Kats-Chernin\n**Celia Craig\n|\n*Poppy Reid\n**Jane Gazzo\n**Sosefina Fuamoli\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Excellence in Image Making Award\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Emerging Artist Award\n|-\n|\n*Cindy Vogels\n|\n*Martha Marlow\n**GLVES\n**Vanessa Perica\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Tina Arena Special Impact Award\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"|\n|-\n|\n*Dina Bassile'''\n**Sahara Herald\n**Sonja Horbelt\n|\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
