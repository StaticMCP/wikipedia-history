      "text": "# Sunstorm (John Stewart album)\n\n| noprose   = yes\n}}\nSunstorm is the fifth album by folk musician John Stewart, former member of The Kingston Trio, released in 1972. It is the second of two albums released by Warner Bros. The album features Stewart’s signature lyrical style drawing inspiration from his teenage rock’n’roll days and gospel music, particularly the Staple Singers, whom he discovered through fellow Kingston Trio member Dave Guard. Stewart belts out two rockers; \"Bring It On Home” and \"Drive Again\" but the album mostly centers on ballads with gospel undertones especially prominent on the track \"Light Come Shining\". The album’s sessions brought together an impressive lineup of musicians, including Glen D. Hardin, James Burton, and Jerry Scheff—all part of Elvis Presley’s band at the time. This star-studded ensemble added depth and polish to Stewart’s folk-rock vision, making Sunstorm a quietly ambitious entry in his discography.\nTrack listing\nAll compositions by John Stewart except where noted.\nSide one\n# \"Kansas Rain\" – 2:30\n# \"Cheyenne\" – 3:35\n# \"Bring It On Home\" – 2:06\n# \"Sunstorm\" – 2:35\n# \"Arkansas Breakout\" – 3:35\nSide two\n# \"An Account of Haley's Comet\" (John Stewart, John S.
