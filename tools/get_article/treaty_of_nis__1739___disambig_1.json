It was preceded by the preliminary Russo-Turkish peace treaty, signed through French mediation on 18 September 1739 in Belgrade, while the peace arrangements were finalized by the treaty of Niš on 3 October.\nHistory\nOn 18 September 1739, the Treaty of Belgrade was signed by the Ottoman Empire and the Habsburg monarchy, thus ending the Habsburg participation in the war. On the same day, through the mediation of French ambassador, marquis Louis Sauveur de Villeneuve, a separate preliminary peace treaty was signed, also in Belgrade, aimed to end the war between Russia and the Ottomans. Since the Russo-Turkish treaty was signed through mediation, its viability was depending on official acceptance by the Russian court. At that time, commander of advancing Russian forces, that have successfully captured Moldavia, field marshal Burkhard Christoph von Münnich was not included into negotiations, nor informed of the outcome of French mediation. In spite of that, negotiations proceeded further, and on 3 October (1739) the final Russo-Turkish peace treaty was signed in Niš, also through French mediation. Due to a looming threat of war with Sweden and French diplomatic pressure, Russian court decided to accept both treaties. After the formal ratification by empress Anna of Russia, diplomatic instruments were exchanged and the final convention was signed in Constantinople on 28 December 1739, also through the French mediation, thus formally concluding the war.\nBy the preliminary Russo-Turkish treaty of Belgrade (18 September) and the final peace treaty of Niš (3 October), the Russians gave up their claims to Crimea and Moldavia, but were allowed to build a port at Azov, though without fortifications and without the right to have a fleet in the Black Sea. Russian side also achieved some minor territorial gains, through corrections of land borders in the Pontic steppe regions. Russia was also allowed to build a fortress on the Don river island at Cherkassy, while the region of Kabardia was recognized as a neutral zone between the two empires.\nSee also\n* List of treaties\n* List of treaties of the Ottoman Empire\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
