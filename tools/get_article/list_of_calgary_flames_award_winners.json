      "text": "# List of Calgary Flames award winners\n\nThe Calgary Flames are a professional ice hockey team based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. They are members of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference in the National Hockey League (NHL). The Flames arrived in Calgary in 1980 after transferring from the city of Atlanta, Georgia, where they were known as the Atlanta Flames from their founding in 1972 until relocation.\nThe Flames have won numerous team and individual awards and honours since moving to Calgary. The team has captured the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl as Western Conference champion in 1986, 1989 and 2004, winning the Stanley Cup in 1989. Jarome Iginla is the team's most decorated player, with two Rocket Richard Trophy wins, an Art Ross Trophy, and a Lester B. Pearson Award along with two selections to the NHL first All-Star team, one to the second All-Star team, and a selection to the All-Rookie Team in 1997. Theoren Fleury, Al MacInnis and Jarome Iginla each played in six National Hockey League All-Star Games, the most in Flames history.\nFour players have had their numbers retired by the Flames. Lanny McDonald's number 9 was removed from circulation in 1989, while Mike Vernon's number 30 was retired in 2007. Jarome Iginla’s number 12 was retired in 2019, and Miikka Kiprusoff's number 34 was retired in 2024. Additionally, Al MacInnis' number 2 was honoured in 2012 and Joe Nieuwendyk's number 25 in 2014.  McDonald is also one of several Hockey Hall of Famers who were associated with the Flames. Joe Mullen and Al MacInnis played several seasons in Calgary as part of Hall of Fame careers, while general manager Cliff Fletcher, coach Bob Johnson and owner Harley Hotchkiss have each been inducted as builders.\nThe Flames have three internal team awards. The Molson Cup is awarded to the player who earns the most three-star selections throughout the season. The Ralph T. Scurfield Humanitarian Award, given for dedication and community service, and J. R. \"Bud\" McCaig Award, given for respect and courtesy, are presented towards the end of each season.\nLeague awards\nTeam trophies\nA replica of the Presidents' Trophy on display at the Pengrowth Saddledome.\nThe Calgary Flames have won the Western (previously the Campbell) Conference three times in franchise history, winning the Stanley Cup once, in 1989. They have twice won the Presidents' Trophy as the top team in the NHL during the regular season.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"75%\"\n|+Team trophies awarded to the Calgary Flames\n! scope=\"col\" |Award\n! scope=\"col\" |Description\n! scope=\"col\" |Times won\n! scope=\"col\" |Seasons\n! scope=\"col\" |References\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Stanley Cup\n|NHL championship\n|1\n|}}\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Clarence S.

In 2001–02, Iginla led the NHL with 52-goals and 96-points, earning him the Rocket Richard and Art Ross Trophies. Iginla also was named the most valuable player as selected by his peers, and a first team all-star. Iginla won his second Richard Trophy when he tied for the league lead in goals with 41 in 2003–04.\nLanny McDonald was the first winner of the King Clancy Memorial Trophy in 1987–88, earning the award in recognition of his charity work in both Toronto and Calgary. Sergei Makarov was a controversial winner of the Calder Memorial Trophy in 1989–90. He won the rookie of the year award at the age of 31 after spending 13 seasons in the Soviet League. As a result, the NHL changed the rules for the award, restricting it to players aged 26 or younger.\nJarome Iginla has won numerous league awards while a member of the Flames.\nMiikka Kiprusoff won the Vezina Trophy as the NHL's top goaltender in 2005–06.\nDion Phaneuf was named a first-team All-Star in 2007–08.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\"\n|+Individual awards won by Calgary Flames players and staff\n! scope=\"col\" |Award\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |Description\n! scope=\"col\" |Winner\n! scope=\"col\" |Season\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |References\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Art Ross Trophy\n| Regular season scoring champion\n| ||\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" |Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy\n|rowspan=\"2\" |Perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to hockey\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"5\"| Calder Memorial Trophy\n|rowspan=\"5\"|Rookie of the year\n|' || '\n|rowspan=\"5\"|\n|-\n|'\n|'\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Conn Smythe Trophy\n|Most valuable player of the playoffs\n| |||\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"|Jack Adams Award\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Top coach during the regular season\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | James Norris Memorial Trophy\n| Top defenseman during the regular season\n|  ||\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\"| King Clancy Memorial Trophy\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Leadership qualities on and off the ice and humanitarian contributions within their community\n| ||\n|rowspan=\"4\"|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"5\" | Lady Byng Memorial Trophy\n|rowspan=\"5\" | Gentlemanly conduct\n| ' || '\n|rowspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|  ||\n|-\n|  ||\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"|Mark Messier Leadership Award\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Leadership and contributions to society\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy\n|rowspan=\"2\" | Most goals in the regular season\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"|NHL Foundation Player Award\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Community service\n| ||\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | NHL Man of the Year Award\n| Sportsmanship and involvement with charitable groups\n| ||\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\"|NHL Plus-Minus Award\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Highest plus/minus\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"3\"|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Ted Lindsay Award\n|Most outstanding player during the regular season\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Vezina Trophy\n|Top goaltender\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |William M.

Thirty-two All-Star Games have been held since the Flames arrived in Calgary, with at least one player representing the Flames in each year but 2001. The All-Star game has not been held in various years: 1979 and 1987 due to the 1979 Challenge Cup and Rendez-vous '87 series between the NHL and the Soviet national team, respectively, 1995, 2005 and 2013 as a result of labour stoppages, 2006, 2010 and 2014 because of the Winter Olympics, 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2025 when it was replaced by the 2025 4 Nations Face-Off. The NHL also holds a Young Stars Game for first- and second-year players.\nThe Flames hosted the 1985 All-Star Game at the Olympic Saddledome. A sell-out crowd saw the Wales Conference defeat the Campbell Conference 6–4, while Al MacInnis and Paul Reinhart represented the Flames at the game. Along with Theoren Fleury and Jarome Iginla, MacInnis played a franchise high six All-Star Games as a member of the Flames.\nRobyn Regehr represented the Flames at the Young Stars game in 2002.\nTheoren Fleury, pictured in 2008, represented the Flames in six All-Star Games.\n* Selected by fan vote\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\"\n|+Calgary Flames players and coaches selected to the All-Star Game\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" | Game\n!scope=\"col\" | Year\n!scope=\"col\" | Name\n!scope=\"col\" | Position\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| References\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 26th\n|1973\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 27th\n|1974\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 28th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |1975\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| 29th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |1976\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| 30th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |1977\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 31st\n|1978\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 32nd\n|1980\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 33rd\n|1981\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 34th\n|1982\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 35th\n|1983\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 36th\n|1984\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| 37th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |1985\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 38th\n|1986\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"5\"| 39th\n|rowspan=\"5\" |1988\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\"| 40th\n|rowspan=\"4\" |1989\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"4\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"5\"| 41st\n|rowspan=\"5\" |1990\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\"| 42nd\n|rowspan=\"4\" |1991\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"4\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\"| 43rd\n|rowspan=\"3\"|1992\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"3\"|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| 44th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |1993\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| 45th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |1994\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 46th\n|1996\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 47th\n|1997\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 48th\n|1998\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 49th\n| 1999\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| 50th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2000\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 51st\n|2001\n|No Flames selected\n|—\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 52nd\n|2002\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 53rd\n|2003\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 54th\n|2004\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| 55th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2007\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| 56th\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2008\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 57th\n|2009\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 58th\n|2011\n| (Did not play)\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 59th\n|2012\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| 60th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2015\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| 61st\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2016\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 62nd\n|2017\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 63rd\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2018\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n| (Subbed for Jonathan Quick)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 64th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2019\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" | 65th\n|rowspan=\"3\" |2020\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n| (Subbed for Darcy Kuemper)\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 66th\n|2022\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 67th\n|2023\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 68th\n|2024\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nCareer achievements\nHockey Hall of Fame\nSeveral members of the Flames organization have been honoured by the Hockey Hall of Fame during the team's history in Calgary. Lanny McDonald was the first Flame player inducted, gaining election in 1992. McDonald recorded 215 goals in 492 games for the Flames, including a team record 66 goals in 1982–83. He was joined in 2000 by a fellow member of the 1989 Stanley Cup championship team, Joe Mullen. Mullen spent five seasons with the Flames, recording 388 points and capturing two Lady Byng Trophies. Grant Fuhr, elected in 2003, became the third former Flames player to enter the Hall. Fuhr played only one season in Calgary; however, he recorded his 400th career win in a Flames uniform, a victory over the Florida Panthers on October 22, 1999. In 2007, Al MacInnis became the fourth former Flame inducted into the Hall, and the third to earn his Hall of Fame credentials primarily as a Flame. MacInnis was a member of the Flames from 1981 until 1994. He is best remembered for his booming slapshot, as well as for winning the Conn Smythe Trophy in 1989 as the most valuable player of playoffs. On June 28, 2011, Joe Nieuwendyk was announced as an inductee to the Hockey Hall of Fame. Nieuwendyk played with the Flames from 1986-1987 until 1994–95. Joe was the team captain from 1991 until he left in '95.\nThree members of team management have been inducted in the \"Builders\" category. Former head coach \"Badger\" Bob Johnson joined McDonald in the class of 1992, gaining election as a builder. Johnson coached five seasons with the Flames from 1982 to 1987, and his 193 wins remain a team record. Cliff Fletcher was the Flames general manager from the organization's inception in 1972 until 1991–a span of 19 years. During that time, the Flames qualified for the playoffs sixteen consecutive times between 1976 and 1991. Fletcher was inducted in 2004. In 2006, Harley Hotchkiss became the third Flames builder to gain election. Hotchkiss is the team's current governor, and is an original member of the ownership group that purchased and brought the Flames to Calgary in 1980. He has served many years as the chairman of the NHL Board of Directors, during which he played a significant role in the resolution of the 2004–05 lockout.\nTwo former Flames radio broadcasters have been recipients of the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award Former Atlanta Flames announcer from 1972 to 1980 Jiggs McDonald received it in 1990 for his time among the Flames and other teams and Peter Maher Calgary Flames announcer from 1980 to 2014 was named the recipient in 2006 for his years of service as the radio play-by-play announcer for the Calgary Flames. Maher had been the radio voice of the Flames since 1981, the team's second season in Calgary. He has called six All-Star Games and four Stanley Cup Finals. Former athletic trainer Bearcat Murray, who served with the Flames from 1980 until 1996 and remains with the organization as a community ambassador, will be inducted into the Hall of Fame by the Professional Hockey Athletic Trainers Society and the Society of Professional Hockey Equipment Managers.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\"\n|+Calgary Flames inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame\n! scope=\"col\" |Individual\n! scope=\"col\" |Category\n! scope=\"col\" |Year inducted\n! scope=\"col\" |Years with Flames in category\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |References\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Builder\n|2004\n|1972–1991\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2003\n|1999–2000\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2011\n|1988–1992\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Builder\n|2006\n|1980–2011\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2015\n|1994–1996, 1998–2001\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2009\n|1986–1988\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2020\n|1996–2013\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Builder\n|1992\n|1982–1987\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2007\n|1981–1994\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2016\n|1989–1993\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|1992\n|1981–1989\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2000\n|1985–1990\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2011\n|1986–1995\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Builder\n|2024\n|1972–1982\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Builder\n|2016\n|1972–1977\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Builder\n|2010\n|1980–2009\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2018\n|1998–2000\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2023\n|1982, 1984, 1986–1994, 2000–2002\n|\n|}\nRetired numbers\nThe Calgary Flames have retired four numbers, and a fifth was retired league-wide.
