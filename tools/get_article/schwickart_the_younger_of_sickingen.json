He married Anna Spet of Zwiefalten, daughter of Albert Spet of Zwiefalten and Clara of Ehestetten. Their marriage produced a son, Conrad, who was appointed as advocate, or Vogt, of Bretten from 1504 to 1508.\nLife\nSchwickart of Sickingen came from an old Kraichgau aristocratic family. His duties as amtmann are recorded in a deed as follows: he is to vouchsafe legal protection for all the townsfolk and inhabitants of the Amt. He is also to provide escorts free of charge for all tradesmen, pilgrims and travellers on the \"escort roads\" (Geleitstraßen) - part of a law known as the Geleitrecht - and only accept voluntary donations in return. His income was 150 guilders and the use of ten morgens of pasture, a herb garden, wood and right to the \"small tithe\".\nHe died on 4 August 1478.\nReferences\n* Otto Beuttenmüller: Die Vögte im Oberamt Bretten.
