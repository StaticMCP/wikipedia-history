Yorkshire were announced in March 2019 as hosts, with Parishes of Jersey, Ellan Vannin and Kernow also originally set to participate. All 4 teams are either part of the United Kingdom, or are Crown dependencies. However, Ellan Vannin and Kernow both pulled out for undisclosed reasons, being replaced by Chagos Islands and reducing the tournament to a 3 team format.\nFormat\nThe tournament is a round-robin, with each team playing each other once. This means a total of 3 games to be played over 3 days, at two stadiums (Ingfield Stadium, the home of Ossett United, and the CNG Stadium, home of Harrogate Town. The winner was due to be offered a place at the 2020 CONIFA World Football Cup, which in the event was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nStandings\n|name_CHA =\n|name_POJ =  Parishes of Jersey\n|class_rules = 1) Points; 2) Goal difference; 3) Number of goals scored;\n}}\nAll times are local.\nResults\n| score      = 1–0\n| report     =\n| team2      =  Parishes of Jersey\n| goals1     = Litchfield\n| goals2     =\n| stadium    = Ingfield Stadium\n| location   = Ossett\n| attendance = 521\n| referee    = Karl Parker\n}}\n----\n| score      = 9–2\n| report     =\n| team2      =\n| goals1     = Lester Hinds Harris Watson\n| goals2     = Leelah\n| stadium    = CNG Stadium\n| location   = Harrogate\n| attendance =\n| referee    = Chris Akers\n}}\n----\n| score      =\n| report     =\n| team2      =\n| goals1     =\n| goals2     =\n| stadium    = Ingfield Stadium\n| location   = Ossett\n| attendance =\n| referee    =\n}}\nTop scorers\n;3 goals\n* Tom Harris\n* Kieran Lester\n;2 goals\n* Steven Leelah\n* Karl Hinds\n;1 goal\n* Luke Watson\n* Brodie Litchfield\nControversy\nThe decision by CONIFA to host the 2020 World Football Cup in Somaliland was met with criticism by some, with James Scott, the president of Parishes of Jersey FC, telling the Jersey Evening Post that he would not accept the place at the final tournament if his side won the Atlantic Heritage Cup. The comments were met with a backlash from CONIFA, who criticised inaccurate reporting and defended the decision to host the World Football Cup in Somaliland.\nThe hosting of the 2020 World Football Cup was later transferred to Skopje, North Macedonia, with Parishes of Jersey and Chagos Islands due to participate, before the event was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nReferences"
