The Hussites captured city of Nitra and the Orebite forces conquered the Likava castle in Liptov county, on 29 September. The Taborite forces were looting settlements around cities of Trnava, Nitra and Levice.\nLater, seeking to return home, Hussites were following river Váh to the north, hoping to cross the bridge at Hlohovec. They found the bridge destroyed and were forced to march on towards Ilava, where the Hungarians under the leadership of Miklós Rozgoyni (Mikuláš Rozgoň) and István Poharnok (Štefan Pohárnik) prepared a trap. The battle was fought on a field (Rudé pole, lit. red field) between Ilava and settlement of Košeca. Thanks to the intensive rain, the Hussites were not able to properly manoeuver and about 5,000 of them were killed or drowned trying to cross Váh. Around 250 Hussite war wagons and many cannons were captured. Rozgonyi executed many Taborite prisoners and their commander Zikmund Hořovský. Remains of the Hussite army retreated through the valley of Púchov back into Moravia.\nSources\n* [http://lexikon.katolikus.hu/I/illavai%20ütközet.html Illavai ütközet (Magyar katolikus lexikon)]\n* [https://www.valka.cz/818-Sirotci-vypravy-na-Slovensko Sirotčí výpravy na Slovensko]\n* [https://cestovanie.pravda.sk/cestovny-ruch/clanok/297923-na-povazi-sa-odohra-krvava-bitka/ Na Považí sa odohrá krvavá bitka - Cestovný ruch], Cestovanie - Pravda"
