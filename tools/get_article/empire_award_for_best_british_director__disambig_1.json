It was one of three Best British awards retired that year (the others being Best British Actor and Best British Actress). Winners were voted by the readers of Empire magazine.\nSince its inception, the award has been given to six directors. Guy Ritchie, Roger Michell and Shane Meadows were nominated on two occasions each, more than any other director. Matthew Vaughn was the last winner in this category for his role in Layer Cake.\nWinners and nominees\nIn the list below, winners are listed first in bold, followed by the other nominees.
