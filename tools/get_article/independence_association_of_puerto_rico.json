It was active from 1920 until 1922.\nHistory\nIn 1920, Dr. Leopoldo Figueroa became disillusioned with the Union Party of Puerto Rico's leadership and together with José S. Alegría (father of Ricardo Alegría) and Eugenio Font Suárez co-founded the Independence Association (Asociación Independentista).\nJosé Coll y Cuchí, who belonged to the Union Party of Puerto Rico, felt that the Union Party was not doing enough for the cause of Puerto Rican independence and together with his followers quit the party and founded the Nationalist Association of Puerto Rico (Asociación Nacionalista de Puerto Rico) in San Juan in 1919.\nThe Nationalist Association had a youth group called the \"Juventud Nacionalista\" (Nationalist Youth) which  was at that time presided by José Paniagua. The Nationalist Youth was then composed of students from the University of Puerto Rico and High School students.\nOn September 17, 1922, the Independence Association merged with Coll y Cuchí's Nationalist Association of Puerto Rico and the Nationalist Youth (Juventud Nacionalista) political organizations to form the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party.\nFurther reading\n*José Trías Monge, Puerto Rico: The Trials of the Oldest Colony in the World (Yale University Press, 1997)\nReferences"
