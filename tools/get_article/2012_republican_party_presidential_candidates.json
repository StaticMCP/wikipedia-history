In this table, those marked lighter grey were not featured in any televised debates that occurred while their respective campaigns were active; those marked darker grey were excluded from the majority of those same televised debates, but are notable for having debated with at least some of the televised candidates in other forums (usually online).  Candidates with an asterisk after their withdrawal date subsequently sought the nomination of another party.\nSee results of the 2012 Republican Party presidential primaries for more details about the outcome of the primaries.\nNominee\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Candidate\n!Background\n!Declared\n!States/popular vote/delegates won\n!Withdrew\n!Notes\n|-\n|Mitt Romney(campaign)\n|Former governor of Massachusetts\n|June 2, 2011\n|429,947,433(52.13%)2,061\n|N/A\n|\nThe withdrawal of candidate Rick Santorum on April 10, 2012, eliminated his main challenger and all but guaranteed him the nomination. Newt Gingrich's exit from the race on May 2 left him against Ron Paul and Fred Karger. His win in Texas on May 29 finally accumulated enough delegates to mathematically secure him the nomination. Romney was officially announced as the 2012 Republican presidential nominee on August 28, 2012. He was defeated by incumbent President Barack Obama in the general election on November 6, 2012.\n|-\n|}\nDid not withdraw\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Candidate\n!Background\n!Declared\n!States/popular vote/delegates won\n!Withdrew\n!Notes\n|-\n|Ron Paul(campaign)\n|U.S. Representative from Texas\n|May 13, 2011\n|12,017,957(10.89%)190\n|N/A\n|\nLeading up to the convention, Ron Paul won bound pluralities of the official delegations from the states of Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, and Oregon (but not the Virgin Islands, despite winning the popular vote there).
