It was fought between the armies of the Northern and Southern Court of Japan.\nOverview\nOn February 4, 1348, the war began between Kusunoki Masatsura of the Southern Court and Kō no Moronao of the Northern Court. The Southern army was attacked at Yoshino, the temporary palace of the Imperial residence. Feeling too weak to defend the residence, Masatsura marched out with his whole force to meet his assailants. Kitabatake Chikafusa, meanwhile, led his force towards Izumi, diverting some of the attackers away from the palace.\nKusunoki engaged the enemy commander Kō no Moroyasu in single combat, and, it is said, was about to take Kō's head when he was struck by an arrow; Kusunoki then committed seppuku.\nThe battle ended in a Northern Court victory, but the Southern Court fled Yoshino, leaving little for their enemies to capture. Masatsura, along with his younger brother and second in charge, Masatoki, died during the war.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*George Bruce. ''Harbottle's Dictionary of Battles''.
