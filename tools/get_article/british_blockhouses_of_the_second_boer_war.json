Of the fortifications constructed during the war, around 441 were solid masonry blockhouses, many of which stand today. Different designs were used in the construction, but most were either two or three story structures built using locally quarried stone.\n* Aliwal North Blockhouses (2)\n* Broederstroom Blockhouse\n* Burgersdorp Blockhouse\n* Dewetsville Blockhouse\n* Fort Harlech, Krugersdorp\n* Hekpoort Blockhouse\n* Hopetown Blockhouse\n* Kaalfontein/Zuurfontein Blockhouse\n* Modder River Blockhouse\n* Noupoort Blockhouse\n* Orange River Station\n* Pampoennek Blockhouse\n* Prieska Blockhouse\n* Riversford Blockhouse\n* The Reservoir Blockhouse\n* The Stormberg Junction South Blockhouse\n* Timeball Hill Blockhouse\n* The Warrenton Railway Bridge Blockhouse\n* Warmbaths Blockhouse\n* Witkop Blockhouse\nSee also\n* South African Heritage Resources Agency\n* South African National Museum of Military History\n* Provincial heritage site (South Africa)\n* Military history of South Africa\n* List of castles in Africa\n* History of South Africa\n* List of castles\n* List of forts\nReferences\n* : 978-1-9284-5556-1 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.54272/sach.2021.v35n2a12 |journal=South African Journal of Cultural History |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=204–205 |doi=10.54272/sach.2021.v35n2a12 |s2cid=248876555 |issn=1011-3053|url-access=subscription }}\n*"
