The community is located on the North Shore of Long Island, bordered to the east by the region of Great Neck in Nassau County, to the south by Glen Oaks and the North Shore Towers, and to the west by Bayside.\nThe neighborhood is composed of two main sections. Little Neck is generally used to refer to the area east of Marathon Parkway and/or north of Northern Boulevard, while Douglaston is the rest of the neighborhood; these classifications may overlap depending on different interpretations of neighborhood boundaries. Each of these areas has several subsections. Douglaston–Little Neck represents one of the least traditionally urban communities in New York City, with many areas (particularly those north of Northern Boulevard) having a distinctly  suburban feel, similar to that of Nassau County towns located nearby such as Great Neck.\nThe area is also known for its historical society and other civic groups, notably the Douglaston Civic Association and the Douglas Manor Association. There are two historic districts, Douglas Manor and Douglaston Hill, and two houses, Allen-Beville House and Cornelius Van Wyck House, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in the neighborhood.\nDouglaston–Little Neck is located in Queens Community District 11 and its ZIP Codes are 11362 and 11363. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department's 111th Precinct. Politically, Douglaston–Little Neck is represented by the New York City Council's 19th and 23rd Districts.\nGeography\nDouglaston–Little Neck is bounded by Cross Island Parkway to the west, Grand Central Parkway to the south, the New York City-Nassau County border to the east, and Little Neck Bay to the north.\nDouglaston is considered to be the area located west of Marathon Parkway and north of Grand Central Parkway. According to The New York Times, Douglaston comprises six distinct neighborhoods. Douglas Bay, Douglas Manor, and Douglaston Hill are located north of Northern Boulevard, on the peninsula abutting Little Neck Bay. Douglas Manor takes up most of the peninsula located north of the Long Island Rail Road's Port Washington Branch, while Douglaston Hill takes up a small section between the LIRR and Northern Boulevard. Douglaston Park is the area located between Northern Boulevard and Interstate 495 (I-495, the Long Island Expressway). Additionally, there are two areas south of I-495, Winchester Estates and an area simply called Douglaston. Winchester Estates is located west of Douglaston Park and the remainder of the area south of I-495 is without a distinct name other than Douglaston.\nLittle Neck is the area east of Marathon Parkway and north of Grand Central Parkway. Little Neck itself has three subsections: Pines, Westmoreland, and Little Neck Hills.\nHistory\nEarly settlement\nThe earliest known residents of the area that would become Douglaston–Little Neck were the Matinecock Native Americans. They were sustained by the seafood in Little Neck Bay.\nEarly Dutch settlers were drawn to the area by the rich land and abundant fishing. In the 17th century, European settlers began arriving in the area for its conveniently located harbor. Soon after, the British and Dutch gained control of the Matinecock lands peacefully, except for a small area known as '''Madnan's Neck''' (possibly a shortened form of Native American name for the area, Menhaden-ock, or \"place of fish\"). Thomas Hicks, of the Hicks family that eventually founded Hicksville, and a band of armed settlers forcibly drove out the Matinecock in a battle at today's Northern Boulevard and Marathon Parkway.\n19th century\nIn 1796, Hicks's estate passed to Thomas Wickes (1770–1854), and in 1819, to Wyant Van Zandt, a wealthy merchant, who built a large Greek Revival mansion in the area. Today, this mansion houses the Douglaston Club, a private club with tennis courts, social activities and swimming pools. In 1835, George Douglas bought  of land along with Van Zandt's mansion. Upon Douglas' death in 1862, the land was inherited by his son, William Douglas.\nDouglaston Hill is the oldest area of the community, and is characterized by turn-of-the-20th-century homes in Queen Anne and Victorian styles. It was laid out with very large lots in 1853, at the very beginning of a movement in the United States to create suburban gardens. The area was recognized as a New York City Historic District in December 2004 by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. The Douglaston Hill Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.\nThe settlers thrived growing produce for the Manhattan market and the area was used as a dock on Little Neck Bay. The Little Neck and Douglaston stations opened in 1866 on the North Shore Railroad (now the Long Island Rail Road's Port Washington Branch and the same line featured prominently in the famous F. Scott Fitzgerald novel The Great Gatsby) to serve the community and the dock area. Northern Boulevard was developed into a commercial and cultural hub, and the Little Neck Theater, a 576-seat movie theater, was opened in 1929 at the intersection of Northern Boulevard and Morgan Street. The theater was closed in 1983.\nFrom the 1860s through the 1890s, small hard clams (quahogs) from Little Neck Bay were served in the best restaurants of New York and several European capitals. Eventually, the term \"littleneck\" or \"littleneck clam\" came to be used as a size category for all hard clams, regardless of origin.\nLittle Neck was also famous for being the last stop on the Underground Railroad until 1865.\n20th century\nIn the early 20th century, the Rickert-Finlay Realty Company of Manhattan purchased  of the Douglas' family holdings, and formed the Douglas Manor Association, creating a planned community. Many of the houses in this area were built in architectural styles popular at the time, such as Tudor, Mediterranean, Colonial Revival, and Arts and Crafts. In 1997, New York City's Landmarks Preservation Commission designated Douglas Manor as the Douglaston Historic District, ensuring that no new buildings or external alterations could be made without the commission's approval. The Douglaston Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.\nAn old Matinecock cemetery remained on Northern Boulevard between Cornell Lane and Jesse Court. One of the last photographs of the cemetery was taken by the Daily News in August 1931, a few months before it was removed to make room for a widened Northern Boulevard. The remains from the cemetery were moved to the Zion Episcopal Church of Douglaston and placed under a stone marker that reads \"Here rest the last of the Matinecoc.\"\nOther areas of Douglaston–Little Neck were developed during the latter half of the 20th century. Douglaston Park contains a mixture of large, older homes as well as Capes, Tudors, and ranch-style homes dating from the 1960s. The areas adjacent to the Douglaston Shopping Center are occupied mainly by attached single-family homes built in the 1950s through 1970s (Beech Hills, Deepdale, and another development known colloquially as the \"Korvette's Houses\" due to the former proximity of an E.J. Korvette department store), as well as four-story condominiums added in the mid-1980s.\nIn addition to the Douglaston Historic District and Douglaston Hill Historic District, the Allen-Beville House and Cornelius Van Wyck House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nDemographics\nBased on data from the 2010 United States census, the population of Douglaston–Little Neck was 24,739.\nThe racial makeup of the neighborhood was 53.3% (13,195) White, 1.3% (317) African American, (15) Native American, 35.6% (8,818) Asian, 0.0% (2) Pacific Islander, 0.3% (69) from other races, and 1.2% (308) from two or more races.
