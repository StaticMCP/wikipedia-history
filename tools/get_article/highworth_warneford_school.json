The main buildings from the original school are still in use. The modern Highworth Warneford was established in 1975. There have been constant expansions of the school ever since, including the addition of a sports hall.\nPreviously a community school administered by Swindon Borough Council, in July 2011 Highworth Warneford School converted to academy status.\nAt its March 2018 Ofsted inspection the school was assessed as \"Requires Improvement\", a deterioration from the 2013 rating of \"Good\".\nIn September 2023 the school joined The Park Academies Trust.\nNotable former pupils\n*Felix de Giles - jockey\nReferences"
