It targets publications like books, periodicals, dictionaries, and scientific literature.\nHistory\nMajor releases of Bookmaker include v6.0 and 7.0, 9.0, 9.01, 9.1, 9.11, 10.0, the 2008 edition, and 11.0. V9.01 introduced automatic pinyin annotation, a large-character font library, and GBK font support. The 2008 edition added annotation and layout parameters.\nFeatures\nBookmaker runs on Microsoft Windows (old versions support DOS), and can import Microsoft Word documents directly. It offers tools for mathematical formula entry, chemical notation, symbol library management, and colored element design. Output formats include PostScript and PDF, as well as Founder's proprietary CEB format.\nUnlike WYSIWYG systems, Bookmaker uses batch processing: users write scripts in BD typesetting language () to define layout commands.\nSample files (, .FBD) contain user-edited text with embedded annotations, while backups (.BAK) are created automatically during processing. The .PRO files store global annotations for the complete publication.\nBD language\nCommands in BD language are embedded as annotations within sample files.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Examples\n!Content\n!Bookmaker BD language\n!LaTeX\n!Result\n|-\n|Math expression\n|🄏🄏ⓏsinⓏ¼(α＋β)🄏🄏\n|\\sin(\\alpha + \\beta)\n|\\sin(\\alpha + \\beta)\n|}\nLimitations\n* Full-width single and double quotation marks from Word documents may convert to half-width in Bookmaker 10.0; this can be worked around by re-pasting through Windows Notepad or WordPad.\nReferences"
