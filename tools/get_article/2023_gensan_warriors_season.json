Following the arrivals of former MPBL Most Valuable Player John Wilson and reigning Rookie of the Year Kyt Jimenez, the Warriors once again improved with not just a 21–7 record but also claiming a top-three seed for the first time.\nIn the division quarterfinals, General Santos faced against the Muntinlupa Cagers. The series ended up reaching a third game, which GenSan would win, 85–78, getting their first ever playoff series win. The Warriors' division semifinals series against the Batangas City Embassy Chill also ended up going the full length, but this time, GenSan would fall to Batangas City, ending their season.\nThis is the first season in which the team didn't play any home games during the regular season or playoffs, although they were one of two home teams for this season's Preseason Invitational.\nPreseason\nThe GenSan Warriors were one of eight teams that took part in the 2023 MPBL Preseason Invitational at the Lagao Gymnasium in General Santos. It was the second Preseason Invitational appearance for the franchise. The Warriors failed to make the playoffs after finishing Group B in third place with a 1–3 record.\nSchedule\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=8 style=\";\" | 2023 GenSan Warriors Preseason Invitational schedule\n|-\n! style=\";\" | Stage\n! style=\";\" | Game\n! style=\";\" | Date\n! style=\";\" | Opponent\n! style=\";\" | Score\n! style=\";\" | Location\n! style=\";\" | Record\n! style=\";\" | Recap\n|- style=\"background:#cfc\"\n! rowspan=3 | Group stage\n! 1\n| February 21 || Valenzuela || W 82–73 || Lagao Gymnasium || 1–0\n|\n|- style=\"background:#fcc\"\n! 2\n| February 22 || Nueva Ecija || L 67–73 || Lagao Gymnasium || 1–1\n|\n|- style=\"background:#fcc\"\n! 3\n| February 24 || Imus || L 61–78 || Lagao Gymnasium || 1–2\n|\n|-\n| colspan=8 align=center | Source: [https://mpbl.web.geniussports.com/competitions/?WHurl=%2Fcompetition%2F35515%2Fteam%2F95555%2Fschedule Schedule]\n|}\nRegular season\nStandings\nSchedule\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=7 style=\";\" | 2023 GenSan Warriors season schedule\n|-\n! style=\";\" | Game\n! style=\";\" | Date\n! style=\";\" | Opponent\n! style=\";\" | Score\n! style=\";\" | Location\n! style=\";\" | Record\n! style=\";\" | Recap\n|- style=\"background:#cfc\"\n! 1\n| March 23 || Mindoro || W  87–78 || Baliwag Star Arena || 1–0\n|\n|- style=\"background:#cfc\"\n! 2\n| March 30 || Negros || W  88–74 || Santa Rosa Sports Complex || 2–0\n|\n|- style=\"background:#cfc\"\n! 3\n| April 13 || Laguna || W  89–77 || Bren Z.
