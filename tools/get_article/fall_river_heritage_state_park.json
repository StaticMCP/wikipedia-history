The state park encompasses  beside the Charles M. Braga Jr. Memorial Bridge on Battleship Cove, home of the World War II battleship USS Massachusetts. The park is managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation.\nPark history\nThe development of the state's heritage parks program began with the allocation of $35 million in 1978 for the creation of eight urban parks throughout Massachusetts. The program's aim was to create quality urban space, celebrate the communities' cultural heritage, and stimulate private economic investment. The visitors center at Fall River Heritage State Park opened to the public in 1985.\nActivities and amenities\nIn addition to its visitors center, the park offers a wheelchair-accessible boardwalk, a  meadow used for picnicking, concerts, and arts & crafts fairs, an antique carousel relocated from Dartmouth's Lincoln Park, and a public sailing program.\n}}\nExternal links\n*[https://www.mass.gov/locations/fall-river-heritage-state-parkFall River Heritage State Park] Department of Conservation and Recreation"
