      "text": "# Historical Chinese anthems\n\nHistorical Chinese anthems comprise a number of official and unofficial national anthems of China composed during the Qing dynasty and the Republic of China.\n\"Chinese national anthem\" may refer to:\n*  \"March of the Volunteers\" of the People's Republic of China\n*  \"National Anthem of the Republic of China\" of the Republic of China\nTune of Li Zhongtang\nQuasi-official\nIn 1896, for purposes of diplomatic missions to Western Europe and Russia, Li Hongzhang (Zhongtang being a term of respect for a vizier or prime minister) employed in political lyrics combined with classical Chinese music to create a song later known as the \"Tune of Li Zhongtang\" (李中堂樂).\n{| BORDER=\"0\" CELLSPACING=\"0\" CELLPADDING=\"10\"\n|\n金殿當頭紫閣重，\n仙人掌上玉芙蓉，\n太平天子朝天日，\n五色雲車駕六龍。\n|\nWith a golden palace above his head, and fold upon fold of purple pavilions,\nLike a jade hibiscus on the palm of an immortal,\nThe Son of Heaven of Perfect Peace pays homage to the sun in the sky,\nRiding on a five-coloured car of cloud pulled by six dragons.\n|}\nPraise the Dragon Flag\nQuasi-official\nAfter the Department of the Army was established in 1906, Praise the Dragon Flag became the army song, and has been played at formal occasions overseas.\n{|BORDER=\"0\" CELLSPACING=\"0\" CELLPADDING=\"10\"\n|\n於斯萬年，\n亞東大帝國！\n山岳縱橫獨立幟，\n江河漫延文明波；\n四百兆¹民神明冑，\n地大物產博。\n揚我黃龍帝國徽，\n唱我帝國歌！\n|\nHere for ten thousand years,\nGreat Empire of East Asia!\nThe criss-crossing mountains stand alone,\nThe wide-spreading rivers are the waves of the civilization;\nFour hundred million¹ people under the auspice of the gods,\nThe land is large and the produce great.\nWave my yellow dragon emblem of the Empire,\nSing the song of our Empire!\n|}\n¹ 兆 usually means one trillion (1012), but it could mean one million (106), and should have that value here in the song for factual accuracy. See Chinese numerals for details.\nCup of Solid Gold (1911–1912)\nOfficial\nCup of Solid Gold became the first official national anthem of the Qing Empire in less than a week when the Wuchang Uprising occurred in 1911. It lasted for about one year until the end of the empire and the establishment of the Republic of China. It is in classical Chinese.\nSong of Five Races Under One Union\nProvisional\nAfter the establishment of the provisional government in Nanjing, the Ministry of Education under Cai Yuanpei asked the public for possible anthems (as well as coats of arms), and \"Song of Five Races under One Union\" (五旗共和歌), with lyrics by Shen Enfu (沈恩孚) and music by Shen Pengnian (沈彭年), was released as a draft in the newspaper.\n{|BORDER=\"0\" CELLSPACING=\"0\" CELLPADDING=\"10\"\n|\n亞東開化中華早，\n揖美追歐，\n舊邦新造。\n飄揚五色旗，\n民國榮光，\n錦繡山河普照。\n我同胞，\n鼓舞文明，\n世界和平永保。\n|\nYà dōng kāihuà zhōnghuá zǎo,\nyī měi zhuī ōu,\njiù bāng xīnzào.\nPiāoyáng wǔsè qí,\nmínguó róngguāng,\njǐnxiù shānhé pǔzhào.\nWǒ tóngbāo,\ngǔwǔ wénmíng,\nshìjiè hépíng yǒngbǎo.\n|\nChina, East Asia’s earliest civilisation,\nAdmiring America while chasing Europe,\nAs the old nation is being rebuilt.\nThe Five Colored Flag flutters high,\nThe Glory of the Republic\nshines over its beautiful mountains and rivers.\nMy fellow compatriots,\nlet us all invigorate our civilisation,\nso that peace is protected for the whole world.\n|}\nHow Great is Our China!\nUnofficial\nAlso called \"Patriotic Song\" (愛國歌), \"How Great is Our China!\" (泱泱哉，我中華！) has lyrics written by Liang Qichao and music by overseas Chinese at Datong School (大同學校), Yokohama.
