Its intended readership is, in the first instance, other theologians.\nIn contrast to this, the \"medieval popular Bible\" is aimed at the ordinary population of medieval Europe, and to some extent is also created by them. It ranges from very pious vernacular writings such as the Biblical Epic to scurrilous fabliaux in which biblical figures make an appearance. It includes most religious drama, much stained glass and some wild and fanciful retellings of Bible stories.\nThe forbidden fruit is a standard example. The Bible itself does not say what kind of fruit it was, but in the popular retelling, as opposed to the theological schools, it became an apple.  Since the apple served well to communicate spiritual ideas, the exegetical tradition did not resist it. In the medieval understanding of biblical truth, there was no need for a modern style of debate on the accuracy of the motif.\nSerious work on this area of medieval culture probably began with Beryl Smalley in the 1940s. The term medieval popular Bible became established in scholarship relatively recently as a result of the writings of Brian O. Murdoch, though the phrase had been used before him, usually in a less clearly defined way.\nSee also\n* Bible moralisée\n* Biblia pauperum\n* Legend of the Rood\n* Manuscript culture\n* Mystery play\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*James H.
