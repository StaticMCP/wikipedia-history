It took place on 3 September 1963 near Gò Công, Định Tường Province, after the General Staff of the Viet Cong (VC) (controlled by North Vietnam) called for \"another Ấp Bắc\" on South Vietnamese forces. The intent of the operation was to drive out the VC who had survived the earlier Ấp Bắc engagement. The battle was won by South Vietnamese forces, after inflicting heavy casualties on the VC, using artillery to slaughter VC fighters. It was later discovered that the 91 of the captured VC troops were new recruits, and did not have weapons.\nReferences\n* Quoc Vinh, Tran (1965) Quan doi nhan dan: Resolutely defeat the American aggressors.
