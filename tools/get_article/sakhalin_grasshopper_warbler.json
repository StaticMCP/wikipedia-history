It  is a species found in lowland and coastal regions, nesting in forests or thickets.\nDescription\nThe adult has an unstreaked olive-brown back, uniformly grey breast and buff underparts, with unmottled dull orange undertail coverts.\nThe song is a short phrase, loud and distinctive; nothing like the insect-like reeling of European Locustella species, and more musical than that of Pallas's grasshopper warbler.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Sakhalin Grasshopper Warbler\n\n#REDIRECT Sakhalin grasshopper warbler\n}}"
