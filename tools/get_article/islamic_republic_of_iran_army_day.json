The day of the Iranian Army has been celebrated since 1921.\nHistory\nThe current holiday was established by the former Supreme Leader of Iran, Ruhollah Khomeini on April 18, 1979. Previously, Army Day was celebrated on February 21 (Esfand 3) to commemorate the 1921 Persian coup d'état during the Qajar era. The holiday was moved to December 12 (Azar 28) in 1946 by Mohammad Reza Pahlavi as it was the date when the Imperial Iranian Army defeated the Soviet-backed Azerbaijan People's Government.\nOn April 8, 1979, two months after the fall of the Shah, Khomeini met with Iranian Armed Forces soldiers who made an invaluable contribution to the victory of the revolution. Ten days later, Khomeini named 18 April as Army Day, during a speech to the people calling for military parades to exhibit the nation's military preparedness.\nCelebrations\nThe Iranian government makes a show of military force on Iran Army Day with parades every 18 April, often demonstrating new defense technologies. Army veterans, active servicemen and reservists, also take part in the annually held parade. The parade is held in front of the Mausoleum of Ruhollah Khomeini.\nGallery\nFile:Iranian Army parades it's ATVs.jpg|IRIA 2011 parade\nFile:IRIA soldiers marching in formation.jpg|2012 parade\nFile:Military parade in Iran's Army day (April 2016) 06.jpg|2016 parade\nFile:Military parade in Iran's Army day (April 2016) 04.jpg|2016 parade\nFile:Military parade in Iran's Army day (17April 2016) 06.jpg|2016 parade\nFile:Military parade in Iran's Army day (April 2016) 09.jpg|2016 parade\nFile:Military parade in Iran's Army day (17April 2016) 01.jpg|2016 parade\nFile:Military parade in Iran's Army day (17April 2016) 04.jpg|2016 parade\nFile:Military parade in Iran's Army day (17April 2016) 02.jpg|2016 parade\nFile:Iranian Army commanders in the military parade in Iran's Army day (2016).jpg|2016 parade\nSee also\n*Public holidays in Iran\n*Armed Forces Day\nVideos\n* [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TUI7_y9_TbE&index=94&list=WL&t=0s Iranian Army Day 2018]\nReferences"
