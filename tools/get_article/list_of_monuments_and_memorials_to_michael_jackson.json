Later, it was on display at the National Football Museum in Manchester until 2019, when it was removed from public display. Currently, the statue remains in the care of the museum, stored in its Deepdale archive in Preston, Lancashire.\nOther cases of removed monuments to Jackson include a statue initially located in the Shopping City Süd, in the Austrian district of Mödling, which in 1998 was moved to the center of a venue square used for parties and events organized by the club Baby'O, in Judenau-Baumgarten, Lower Austria. Later, due to the conversion of the club's building into apartments, the statue was sold by its then-owner Franz Zika in 2020.\nAnother statue of Jackson was removed in 2019 from the front of a McDonald's restaurant in Best, Netherlands, where it had been located since 1996 when the restaurant's franchisee purchased the statue, which was previously donated by Jackson, in support of Ronald McDonald House Charities. However the owner  Peter van Gelder confirmed that the statue has not been permanently taken down and instead is going to be relocated when a more suitable location can be found. Both statues were larger-scale replicas of the 10-foot sculpture of Jackson depicted on the cover of Jackson's HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I album. Another statue of Jackson, which had stood in the Nali Patio in Sanlitun, Beijing, since August 29, 2020, was removed from the place before it was demolished in 2024.\nSee also\n*Cultural impact of Michael Jackson\nNotes\nReferences"
