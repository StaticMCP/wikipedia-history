He held the WBA super featherweight title between 2022 and November 2023.\nHe competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in the men's bantamweight event, in which he was eliminated in the round of 32 by Dzmitry Asanau.\nProfessional boxing career\nEarly career\nGarcia made his professional debut against Marlembron Acuna on 16 December 2016. He won the fight by a third-round stoppage. Garcia made his first step up in competition on 10 November 2018, when he was booked to face Robin Zamora for the vacant WBA Fedelatin featherweight title. He won the fight by a second-round knockout. Garcia made his first WBA Fedelatin featherweight title defense against Anvar Yunusov on 27 July 2019. He won the fight by split decision, with scores of 105–103, 107–101 and 102–106.\nFollowing a pair of victories against Miguel Moreno Gonzalez and Isaac Avelar, Garcia was booked to face Chris Colbert on 26 February 2022, in a WBA super featherweight title eliminator, as a late replacement for Roger Gutiérrez who withdrew as he tested positive for COVID-19. Coming in with only 19 days notice, Garcia, who was a +1500 underdog, won the fight by an upset unanimous decision, knocking Colbert down in the seventh round and winning a unanimous decision with judges' scorecards of 119–108 and 118–109 twice.\nWBA super featherweight champion\nGarcía vs. Gutiérrez\nGarcía was expected to challenge the reigning WBA super featherweight champion Roger Gutiérrez on July 10, 2022, at the Poliedro de Caracas in Caracas, Venezuela. The fight was later postponed, as the promoters were unable to organize a bout in Venezuela. The WBA ordered both sides to renegotiate terms to avoid the fight heading to a purse bid hearing. The pair came to terms and rescheduled the fight for August 20. The bout took place on the Adrien Broner and Omar Figueroa Jr. undercard. García fought behind his jab for the first eight rounds of the bout, which kept his opponent relatively inactive. Although Gutiérrez picked up the pace in the ninth round, García had already built up a significant lead and won the fight by unanimous decision. Two judges scored the fight 117–111 in his favor, while the third judge scored the fight 118–110 for García.\nGarcía vs. Davis\nGarcía faced three weight world champion Gervonta Davis in a lightweight bout at the Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C., on January 7, 2023. The fight was a closely-contested affair, until Davis landed a flush straight left early in the eighth round. Soon after, a fight broke out in the crowd at ringside with 2 minutes and 8 seconds left in the eighth round, causing the fight to be temporarily halted. When the action was resumed, Davis found success again with his left hand, visibly hurting García. The latter was disoriented after retreating to his stool in his corner, complaining about his eyesight. The fight was stopped, with Davis winning via eighth-round corner retirement, marking the first loss of Garcia's career.\nGarcía vs. Roach\nOn March 20, 2023, García was ordered by the WBA to make a mandatory title defense against the number-one ranked contender Lamont Roach Jr. A purse bid was called for May 25, which was won by García's TGB Promotions with a bid of $351,000.\nRetirement\nIn August 2025, Garcia announced his retirement from boxing via social media. He concluded his career with a record of 16 wins, 2 losses, and 10 knockouts.\nProfessional boxing record\n{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n|-\n!\n!Result\n!Record\n!Opponent\n!Type\n!Round, time\n!Date\n!Location\n!Notes\n|-\n|21\n|Loss\n|}}\n|align=left|Lamont Roach Jr.\n|SD\n|12\n|25 Nov 2023\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|20\n|Loss\n|16–1\n|align=left|Gervonta Davis\n|RTD\n|9 (12),\n|7 Jan 2023\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|19\n|Win\n|16–0\n|align=left|Roger Gutiérrez\n|UD\n|12\n|20 Aug 2022\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|18\n|Win\n|15–0\n|align=left|Chris Colbert\n|UD\n|12\n|26 Feb 2022\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|17\n|Win\n|14–0\n|align=left|Isaac Avelar\n|UD\n|8\n|18 Dec 2021\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|16\n|Win\n|13–0\n|align=left|Miguel Moreno Gonzalez\n|TKO\n|4 (8),\n|21 Jul 2021\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|15\n|style=background:#DDD|NC\n|12–0\n|align=left|Marco Acevedo\n|NC\n|3 (8)\n|16 Dec 2020\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|14\n|Win\n|12–0\n|align=left|Anvar Yunusov\n|SD\n|11\n|27 Jul 2019\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|13\n|Win\n|11–0\n|align=left|Ronal Ron\n|RTD,\n|3 (8)\n|27 Apr 2019\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|12\n|style=background:#DDD|NC\n|10–0\n|align=left|Charlie Serrano\n|NC\n|1 (10)\n|2 Mar 2019\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|11\n|Win\n|10–0\n|align=left|Robin Zamora\n|KO\n|2 (11)\n|10 Nov 2018\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|10\n|Win\n|9–0\n|align=left|Leonel Lugo\n|TKO\n|2 (8),\n|25 Aug 2018\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|9\n|Win\n|8–0\n|align=left|Antoni Armas\n|KO\n|1 (8),\n|16 Jul 2018\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|8\n|Win\n|7–0\n|align=left|Rafael Hernandez\n|KO\n|6 (6),\n|23 Jun 2018\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|7\n|Win\n|6–0\n|align=left|Jose Luis Graterol\n|TKO\n|4 (6),\n|24 Feb 2018\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|6\n|Win\n|5–0\n|align=left|Manuel Gonzalez Garcia\n|TKO\n|2 (8),\n|22 Dec 2017\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|5\n|style=background:#DDD|NC\n|4–0\n|align=left|Alfonso Perez\n|NC\n|3 (8)\n|14 Sep 2017\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|4\n|Win\n|4–0\n|align=left|Maikol Beaumont\n|UD\n|6\n|26 Jul 2017\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|3\n|Win\n|3–0\n|align=left|Miguel Encarnacion\n|TKO\n|2 (6),\n|24 Jun 2017\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|2\n|Win\n|2–0\n|align=left|Robinson Garcia\n|UD\n|6\n|24 Feb 2017\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|1\n|Win\n|1–0\n|align=left|Marlembron Acuna\n|RTD\n|3 (4),\n|16 Dec 2016\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|}\nSee also\n*List of southpaw stance boxers\n*List of world super-featherweight boxing champions\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nchampion]]\n|years=August 20, 2022 – November 25, 2023}}"
