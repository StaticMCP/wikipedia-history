It served primarily on the Caucasus Campaign against the Russian Empire during World War I.\nFormation and Organization\nThe division was established in late 1914 as part of the reorganization of the Ottoman land forces. It was initially assigned to the 3rd Army and later transferred to the 9th Army.\nDivision Structure (1916)\n* 112th Infantry Regiment\n* 113th Infantry Regiment\n* 114th Infantry Regiment\n* 38th Division Artillery Battalion\n* Ammunition and supply units\nCaucasus Campaign and Engagements\nBetween 1915 and 1917, the 38th Infantry Division participated in several key battles on the Caucasus front. It was among the units that suffered heavy losses following the Battle of Sarikamish. In 1916, the division was tasked with defending the Erzurum line during the Erzurum Offensive (1916) and was deployed to delay the Russian advance around Tercan, Erzincan, and Refahiye.\nDuring the harsh winter of 1916–1917, the division faced severe hardships due to both weather conditions and logistical deficiencies. It entrenched along the Bayburt–Erzincan line and attempted to maintain order during the retreat. Following the October Revolution in Russia in 1917, fighting on the front diminished and the division was reorganized.\nCommanders\n* Kaymakam (Lieutenant Colonel) Ahmet Fikri Bey – 1915–1916\n* Miralay (Colonel) Mustafa Ragıp Bey – 1917\nPost-war\nAfter the signing of the Armistice of Mudros in 1918, the division was officially disbanded. Its personnel were demobilized and its equipment handed over. Some officers and soldiers joined local militia forces and continued their activities.\nReferences"
