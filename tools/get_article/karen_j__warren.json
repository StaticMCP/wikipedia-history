Warren (September 10, 1947 – August 21, 2020) was an author, scholar, and former professor and chair of philosophy at Macalester College.\nBiography\nKaren Warren received her B.A. in philosophy from the University of Minnesota (1970) and her Ph.D. from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst in 1978.\nBefore her long tenure at Macalester College, which began in 1985, Warren was Professor of Philosophy at St. Olaf College in the early 1980s.\nWarren was the Ecofeminist-Scholar-in-Residence at Murdoch University in Australia. In 2003, she served as an Oxford University Round Table Scholar and as Women's Chair in Humanistic Studies at Marquette University in 2004. She has spoken widely on environmental issues, feminism, critical thinking skills and peace studies in many international locations including Buenos Aires, Gothenburg, Helsinki, Oslo, Manitoba, Melbourne, Moscow, Perth, the U.N. Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro (1992), and San Jose.\nKaren was diagnosed with Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) in 2016. Since that time, she worked to promote end of life options for individuals with terminal illnesses. Using ethics as a philosophical framework, Karen argued that humans should have the right to choose when it is time to die when faced with an untreatable fatal illness. Karen articulated her arguments in public forums, including speaking in front of the Minnesota State Senate and writing articles for Compassion & Choices and Psychology Today.\nKaren loved gardening, painting, being in nature, and cheering for her beloved MN Vikings. She loved animals—particularly her most recent cats Hypatia and Colfax. She is survived by a daughter (Cortney), son-in-law (Cal), two grandchildren (Isabella and Kane), two sisters (Janice and Barbara), a brother (Roger) and their respective families.\nKaren donated her body to the University of Minnesota Anatomy Bequest Program for medical education and research. She was also a supporter of the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Research and their work to understand Parkinson's disease and MSA.\nPublic philosophy\nWarren was a believer in allowing public access into the academic field of philosophy and described herself as a \"street philosopher.\" \"I believe philosophy is relevant to people of all ages, in all cultural, geographical, and socioeconomic contexts,\" she has said.\nWarren has taught philosophy in the Berkshire County House of Correction (MA), the Wilderness Society, Eco-Education, Pheasants Forever, Minnesota Naturalists Association and other organizations. As part of her commitment to public philosophy, she has spoken for lay audiences and served as critical thinking consultant to the Science Museum of Minnesota and facilitator of a Women's Issues Book Group at Barnes & Noble Booksellers.\nPublications\nWarren has written extensively in the fields of critical thinking, environmental ethics and ecofeminism. She has written more than forty articles, edited or co-edited five anthologies, and authored Ecofeminist Philosophy: A Western Perspective on What It Is and Why It Matters (2000). She is also the author of a groundbreaking anthology, An Unconventional History of Western Philosophy: Conversations Between Men and Women Philosophers (Rowman & Littlefield, 2009). The anthology explores 2600 years of Western philosophy, juxtaposing leading men and women philosophers' writing on ethics, metaphysics and other topics.\nHer work has been translated into Spanish, Mandarin, French, Japanese and Persian.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927064117/http://www.wilderness.org/AboutUs/LandEthicToolbox/KarenWarren.cfm The Wilderness Society]\n*[https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=stripbooks&field-keywords=karen%20warren&results-process=default&dispatch=search/ref=pd_sl_aw_tops-1_stripbooks_9456367_2&results-process=default Amazon book list]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110621024445/http://thirdspace.ca/articles/rev2-1.htm thirdspace book review]"
