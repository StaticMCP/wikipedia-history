The battle was held on the site of present-day locality Oskarström in Sweden. The Danes had around 4,000 men.\nAfter the outbreak of the war, a Swedish army under the command of King Eric XIV marched into Halland. The goal was to besiege Halmstad, but it failed because of the lack of artillery. Since King Frederick II of Denmark and Norway was on his way with reinforcements, the Swedes pulled back. But they were caught up in Mared on the border between Halland and Småland, where they were defeated.\nThe Danes were victorious, but there was no decisive victory, as the Swedes managed to pull back. As a result of the battle, the Swedes lost some 740 men, including many good officers.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_mared.html Battle of Mared, 9 November 1563 (HistoryofWar.org)]"
