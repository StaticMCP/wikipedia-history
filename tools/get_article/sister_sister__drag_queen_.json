In an essay for The Guardian'' in February 2021, the Liverpool-based entertainer said \"Without going into too much detail, one [post] that came from a blank profile described in graphic detail how they would like to see me die” and mentioned that their mental health \"reached rock bottom\" during the peak of the online abuse she was receiving. Discussing her experience on BBC Radio 5 Live in March 2021, Sister Sister urged people to be more considerate online - particularly given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. \"The new normal is that we're all talking online, so we have to really consider... how does this sound?,\" she told host of the programme Naga Munchetty.
