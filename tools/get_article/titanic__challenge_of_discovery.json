PC World thought that an intriguing premise was let down by poor execution. CBS quoted Ballard as saying that he praised the graphical realism. Chicago Tribune deemed it \"sophisticated and thoroughly engaing\". Praising the games, Washington Post noted how \"Few people make coffee-table CD-ROMs like this anymore\". PC Mag deemed it \"marvelous\". Popular Science gave note of the game's realism.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20000817082450/http://www.pimcom.com/titanic/ Main page]"
