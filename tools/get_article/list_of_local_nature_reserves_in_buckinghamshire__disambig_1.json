Its county town is Aylesbury, and it is surrounded by Northamptonshire to the north, Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire to the east, Surrey and Berkshire to the south, Greater London to the south-east and Oxfordshire to the west. As of April 2020, the ceremonial county is administered by two unitary authorities, Buckinghamshire Council and Milton Keynes City Council. Buckinghamshire has an area of 1874&nbsp;km2, and a population of 739,600.\nLocal nature reserves (LNRs) are designated by local authorities under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. The local authority must have a legal control over the site, by owning or leasing it or having an agreement with the owner. LNRs are sites which have a special local interest either biologically or geologically, and local authorities have a duty to care for them. They can apply local bye-laws to manage and protect LNRs.\nAs of July 2016 there are sixteen LNRs in Buckinghamshire. }} Fifteen are in the Buckinghamshire Council area, and one is in the City of Milton Keynes. Two sites are also Sites of Special Scientific Interest and four are in the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The largest is Black Park LNR with 65.8 hectares. This is part of the 250 hectare Black Park Country Park and the forty-three square mile Colne Valley regional park. The smallest site is the 0.5 hectare Coombs Quarry, which has geological interest due to a Jurassic layer, and Romano-British archaeology. }}\n!scope=\"col\" | Location\n!scope=\"col\" |Local Authority\n!scope=\"col\" |Other classifications\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Map\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Details\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Bacombe Hill\n|\n|\n| Upper Bacombe\n|Buckinghamshire\n|BBOWT, CAONB, NT, SSSI\n|[http://magic.defra.gov.uk/MagicMap.aspx?startTopic=Designations&activelayer=lnrIndex&query=REF_CODE%3D%271008755%27 Map]\n|[http://www.lnr.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/lnr/lnr_details.asp?C=4&N=&ID=16 Details]\n|The hill is chalk grassland which has a rich variety of species. including the entire British population of fringed gentian, and there are areas of juniper and mixed scrub.
