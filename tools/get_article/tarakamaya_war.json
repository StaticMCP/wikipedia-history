It is mentioned in the Padma Purana, and described to be the fifth war in the series of Devasura Sangrama, the battles between the devas and the asuras.\nLegend\nAccording to one legend, this abduction had occurred to punish Brihaspati for his extramarital affair with Mamata, the pregnant wife of Utathya. Another legend states that the abduction occurred due to Soma's arrogance, due to the success of his rajasuya ceremony.[5] Soma refused to return Tara to her husband, despite an intervention by Indra. Others say this happened because Tara and Chandra fell for each other and eloped. Brihaspati, the preceptor, was aided by Indra and the devas, allied with the yakshas, while Soma was assisted by Shukra and the daityas, allied with the danavas. Led by Rudra,[6] the devas assaulted the asuras with divine missiles, and the asuras returned this assault with a barrage of their own. The Brahmanda Purana states that Vishnu participated in the war as well, slaying the asura Kalanemi.[7] Indra is stated to have slain Virochana, the son of Prahlada, who had sided with Soma.[8] Eventually, Brahma intervened and restored Tara to her husband. In due course, she gave birth to Budha, who both Brihaspati and Soma claimed as theirs until Tara affirmed that the latter was the father.[9]\nReferences"
