Their music is described variably as metalcore, hardcore punk and melodic death metal. They have released two albums on this label.\nThe band's first album was From Russia With Love, where they play tribute to their heavy metal influences by covering Iron Maiden's \"The Trooper\". The band's sound is influenced by singer Steve Helferich, who worked in Sweden with his previous band, Welcome To Your Life, and parts of the band's instrument tracking were done in Gothenburg, Sweden.\nHistory\nThe band was formed in early 2002, by Kirk Katlan, Steve Helferich (ex-Welcome To Your Life), Marc Jackson (ex-Throwdown), Geoff Harman (ex-Scars Of Tomorrow) and Jeff \"Tyrone\" Trion (ex-Show Of Hands). Justin Jolley replaced Kirk Katlan soon after and between May and July 2004, the band entered the studio to record their debut record on Indecision Records, From Russia With Love. It was released in November 2004. The band also credit \"The Rookie\" as supplying samples for the album, which basically consisted of background noises and film excerpts to add to the overall sound of the music.\nShortly after the release, Jeff Trion left and formed a band called Rebel Fever. He was replaced by Chris Thomson (ex-Atreyu), and in 2007, a second album, Espionage Made Easy, was released.\nPersonnel\nCurrent members\n* Steve Helferich &ndash; vocals (2002 &ndash; present)\n* Justin Jolley &ndash; guitar (2003 &ndash; present)\n* Geoff Harman &ndash; guitar (2002 &ndash; present)\n* Chris Thomson &ndash; bass (2004 &ndash; present)\n* Marc Jackson &ndash; drums (2002 &ndash; present)\nPrevious members\n* Kirk Katlan &ndash; guitar  (2002)\n* Jeff \"Tyrone\" Trion &ndash; bass (2002 &ndash; 2004)\n* The Rookie &ndash; samples\nTimeline\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor = increment:2 start:2002\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2002\nColors =\nid:v    value:red             legend:Vocals\nid:g    value:green           legend:Guitar\nid:b    value:blue            legend:Bass\nid:d    value:orange          legend:Drums\nid:sam  value:purple          legend:Samples\nid:alb  value:black           legend:Studio_album\nid:bar  value:gray(0.95)\nLineData =\nlayer:back\nat:11/15/2004 color:alb # From Russia With Love\nat:05/08/2007 color:alb # Espionage Made Easy\nBackgroundColors = bars:bar\nBarData =\nbar:Steve    text:Steve Helferich\nbar:Geoff    text:Geoff Harman\nbar:Kirk     text:Kirk Katlan\nbar:Justin   text:Justin Jolley\nbar:Jeff     text:Jeff Trion\nbar:Chris    text:Chris Thomson\nbar:Rookie   text:\"The Rookie\"\nbar:Marc     text:Marc Jackson\nPlotData =\nwidth:11\nbar:Steve    from:start       till:end          color:v\nbar:Geoff    from:start       till:end          color:g\nbar:Kirk     from:start       till:12/31/2002   color:g\nbar:Justin   from:01/01/2003  till:end          color:g\nbar:Jeff     from:start       till:12/31/2004   color:b\nbar:Chris    from:01/01/2005  till:end          color:b\nbar:Rookie   from:start       till:11/30/2004   color:sam\nbar:Marc     from:start       till:end          color:d\n}}\nDiscography\n* From Russia with Love (November 2004) Indecision Records\n* Espionage Made Easy (May 2007) Indecision\nReferences"
