The exact location of Kandalur—somewhere south Kerala—is a subject of scholarly debate. The above (988 CE) event is sometimes assumed to be identical with the \"conquest of Vizhinjam by a general of Rajaraja [I]\", before the \"burning of Lanka\", described in the Tiruvalangadu Grant/Plates.\nThe phrase \"Kandalur salai kalamarutta\" is again used as a title with distinction of three other Chola emperors also (Rajendra, Rajadhiraja and Kulottunga).\nAssessment of the title\nThe \"salais\" were considered prized possessions as they are claimed to have been sacked by many kings of South India. The character of the salais was re-examined in the 1970 paper 'Kantalur Salai-New Light on Brahmin Expansion in South India' by historian M. G. S. Narayanan.\nOlder assessments\nDifferent views were expressed by early scholars regarding the character of \"salai\" (such as a naval base (or) a military training centre (or) a cantonment (or) an ammunition depot).\n# Dr. Hultzsch\n#* \"Built a jewell-like hall at Kandalur\" or\n#* \"Cut the vessel [kalam] in the hall at Kandalur\" or\n#* \"Destroyed ships [kalam] at Kandalur [harbour]\"\n# Gopinatha Rao - \"destroyed/discontinued/transferred the Brahmin feeding [kalam] at Kandalur Feeding House or Hall [salai] \"\n# Desikavinayakam Pillai - \"regulation of the Brahmin feeding at Kandalur Feeding House [salai]\"\n#K. A. Nilakanta Sastri - \"destroyed ships at Kandalur [harbour]\"\n# Elamkulam P. N. Kunjan Pillai - \"discontinued/destroyed the feeding [kalam] of the armed Brahmins [Chathar] at Kandalur\".\nBattle near nishapur (616)\nThe exact location of Kandalur is a subject of scholarly debate. It is possible the original Kandalur salai was located near the Ay headquarters Vizhinjam and the deity was later shifted to Trivandrum (after the Chola raids of the 10th-11th centuries).\n* Original (?) location:— a village around 20&nbsp;km east of Vizhinjam with a Shiva temple called Kandalur Salai.\n* Shifted (?) location:— within the city of Trivandrum (Valiya Salai or Valiassala Temple)\nRaid by Rajaraja I (c. 988 CE)\nAs per historian K. A. Nilakanta Sastri, the capture was the first military achievement of Emperor Rajaraja's reign. The success was summed up in the famous phrase \"Kandalur salai kalamarutta\", which precedes Rajaraja's name in several of his inscriptions from the 4th regnal year (988 CE) onwards.\n* The Kandalur salai belonged to the Ay chief, a vassal of the Pandya king at Madurai, in the mid-860s (865 CE).\n*It is possible that at the time of the raid, the salai may have been under control of the Chera Perumal king of Kerala, Bhaskara Ravi. If that was the case, the campaign can be viewed as part of Rajaraja's early battles against the Cheras, Pandyas and the rulers of Sri Lanka.\n* However, some historians argue that Kandalur salai, which only later Chola inscriptions (1048 CE) claim to have belonged to the Chera Perumals, may have been held by the Pandyas when it was attacked by Rajaraja I.\nChengam hero stone inscription\nA hero stone inscription, dated to the 14th regnal year of Rajaraja I, was unearthed from Chengam, Tiruvannamalai in November, 2009. It supports the view that a military engagement indeed took place at Kandalur. It has a eulogy that talks about Rajaraja I, \"who defeated the Nolambas, the Gangas and the Vengai Nadu\", \"beheading the Malai Alarkal of Kandalur Salai\". According to the newspaper report, it also describes that Rajaraja I built a mantapa platform there, that he [Rajaraja I] split in two a naval vessel belonging to the Chera king and that he destroyed a number of \"boats\".\nReferences to Kandalur salai\nCorrections by M. G. S. Narayanan on K. A. Nilakanta Sastri are employed.\n* 865 CE — Huzur Office/Parthivapuram Plates of Ay chieftain Karunantatakkan Srivallabha (a vassal of the Pandya king Srimara Srivallabha).\n* 988 CE — first Chola reference to the fall of Kandalur salai (\"Kandalur salai kalamarutta\").\n* 1018-19 CE — Chola (Rajadhiraja and Rajendra) campaigns in Kerala.\n* 1048 CE – Velur and Tiruppangili inscriptions – Kandalur salai is mentioned as 'Cheralan Velaikkelu Kantalur Chalai'.\n* Kalingattupparani (III-21) mentions Kulottunga Chola's victory of over the Bow Emblem and the Chola capture of Kantalur Salai.\n* c. 1102 — c.1118 CE – Jatavarman Parakrama Pandya mentions the capture of Kantalur Salai (for his Chola overlord Vikrama Chola).\nReferences"
