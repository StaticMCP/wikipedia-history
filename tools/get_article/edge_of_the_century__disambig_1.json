It was the first Styx album featuring A&M solo artist Glen Burtnik and the final album to feature drummer John Panozzo before his death in 1996. It is also their final album to be released on A&M Records.\nThe album spawned two international singles. \"Show Me the Way\" was written by DeYoung and peaked at #3 on both the Hot 100 Pop Singles Chart and Adult Contemporary Chart. Some radio stations played a version edited with snippets of congressional debate and caller dedications to troops in the Gulf War. \"Love Is the Ritual,\" (Pop singles peak #80) written by Burtnik and Plinky Giglio, and \"Love at First Sight\" (Pop singles chart peak, #25 - only released in the United States), written by Burtnik, DeYoung and Young, were also released as singles, but neither garnered the same amount of success as \"Show Me the Way.\"\nThe album sold more than 500,000 copies and was certified gold by the RIAA.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nStyx\n* Dennis DeYoung – vocals, keyboards, accordion\n* James \"JY\" Young – guitars, vocals\n* Glen Burtnik – guitars, vocals\n* Chuck Panozzo – bass\n* John Panozzo – drums, percussion\nAdditional personnel\n* Salvatore \"Plinky\" Giglio – sequencing (1)\n* Gary Fry – Synclavier programming (4)\n* Terry Fryer – sound effects (9)\n* Howard Levy – harmonica\n* Joe Pusateri – percussion\n* Ronald Kolber – baritone saxophone\n* Jon Negus – clarinet, saxophones, horn arrangements (10)\n* Michael Smith – saxophones\n* Mike Halpin – trombone\n* Danny Barber – trumpet\n* Mark Ohlsen – trumpet\n* Mac Bialystock – horn arrangements (10)\nProduction\n* Dennis DeYoung – producer, mixing\n* Phil Bonanno – engineer, mixing\n* Chris Shepard – second engineer\n* Plinky Giglio – additional engineer (1)\n* Ted Jensen – mastering at Sterling Sound, NYC\n* Hugh Syme – art direction, design\n* Mark Hauser – photography\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Chart (1990–1991)\n! scope=\"col\" | Peak position\n|-\n|-\n|}\nCertifications and sales\nReferences"
