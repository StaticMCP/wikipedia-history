The Chinese sought to minimize, if not to end, Mongolian autonomy.\nMongolians viewed the treaty as a disaster because it denied the recognition of a truly independent, all-Mongolian state. Nevertheless, Outer Mongolia remained effectively outside Chinese control and, according to explanation by baron B.E. Nolde, the Director of Law Section of the Russian Foreign Ministry, had all necessary attributes of the state in the international law of that time.\nThe treaty severely curtailed the independent status of Mongolia declared in 1911, but eventually became moot after the October Revolution of 1917, and the Mongolian Revolution of 1921.\nSee also\n*Mongolian Revolution of 1911\n*Occupation of Mongolia\n*Simla Accord (1914)\n*Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance\nReferences"
