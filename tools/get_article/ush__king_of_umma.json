The victory of Eannatum is mentioned in a fragmentary inscription on the stele, suggesting that after the loss of 3,600 soldiers on the field, Ush, king of Umma, was killed in a rebellion in his capital city of Umma:\n}}Some historians assert that the Lagash king who defeated Ush was Lugalshaengur, and that Ush of Umma, Lugalshaengur of Lagash, Mesilim of Kish, and Nin-kisalsi of Adab were contemporary figures. Kim San-hae has argued that Ush was the first king of the 1st Dynasty of Umma, and that Pabilgagaltuku was his successor.\nFile:Stele_of_Vultures_detail_03.jpg|Slain soldiers of the army of Ush, on the battlefield.
