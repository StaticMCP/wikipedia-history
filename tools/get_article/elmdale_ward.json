      "text": "# Elmdale Ward\n\nElmdale Ward was a municipal ward in the city of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\nThe ward was created in 1929 when it was split off from Dalhousie Ward. It existed until 1994, when it was merged with Queensboro Ward to become Kitchissippi Ward.\nIn 1952, the ward was merged with Victoria Ward and named Ward 7. It was given the name Elmdale-Victoria Ward in 1956, and was known this until 1980.\nElmdale Ward originally consisted of Ottawa's western suburbs, such as Civic Hospital and Hintonburg, but was later shifted west by an expanding Dalhousie Ward to its east. As Ottawa expanded, Elmdale's western boundary became Island Park Drive.\nAldermen\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Council\n!
