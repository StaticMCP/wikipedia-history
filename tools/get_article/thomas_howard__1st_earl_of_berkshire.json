He was created Earl of Berkshire in 1626.\nLife\nHoward was born in Saffron Walden, Essex, the second son of Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk and his wife Catherine Knyvet. He was educated at Magdalene College, Cambridge. He was made a knight of the Bath in January 1605, when Prince Charles was created Duke of York. He then joined the embassy of his kinsman Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham to Spain.\nIn November 1605, although underage, he was elected Member of Parliament for Lancaster in a by-election. He danced in The Somerset Masque on 26 December 1613.\nHoward was elected MP for Wiltshire in 1614. In 1621 he was elected MP for Cricklade. In 1621 he was created Baron Howard of Charlton, Wiltshire and on 7 February 1626, he was created Earl of Berkshire. He inherited the Charlton Park estate in Wiltshire from his mother.\nHoward held a large number of local offices and was Lord Lieutenant of Oxfordshire from 1628. He joined the Privy Council in 1639. At the start of the English Civil War he was imprisoned by parliament, charged with attempting to execute the king's commission of array in Oxfordshire. He was subsequently released, according to Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon because he was an ineffectual man 'that could do no harm any where'. He joined the king at Oxford, where he became tutor to  the Prince of Wales. In 1646 Howard was with the Prince of Wales in Jersey, but did not accompany him to France. Instead he went to Holland and then returned to England, where he compounded with Parliament for his estate in 1649.\nAfter the Restoration of Charles II Howard rejoined the Privy Council. He died in July 1669, reportedly of a fall, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.\nFamily\nHoward married Lady Elizabeth Cecil, daughter and co-heir of William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Exeter in 1614.
