The order is a personal memento rather than a state decoration.\nAppearance\nThe ribbon of Edward VII's Royal Family Order is based on his racing colours. They are (working outwards in) a red stripe, almost half the size of the centre stripe, a thin gold stripe, about one-fifth of the red stripe, and a blue stripe, almost double the red stripe. The red gold pattern is mirrored on both sides.\nList of known recipients\n*Queen Alexandra, the King's wife\n*Princess Victoria, the King's daughter\nSee also\n* Royal Family Order of George IV\n* Royal Order of Victoria and Albert\n* Royal Family Order of George V\n* Royal Family Order of George VI\n* Royal Family Order of Elizabeth II\n* Royal Family Order of Charles III\nReferences"
