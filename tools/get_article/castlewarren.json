The castle site, from which Castlewarren takes its name, is on top of a ridge  above sea level.\nSt. Scuithin's\nThe Catholic church in the village is dedicated to St.Scuithin. There was an old kiln where the church now stands; the people used to build a makeshift altar in the kiln where mass was celebrated. As time went on they began to build small shelters to protect the women of the congregation during inclement weather. The present church was built in 1829 in the shape of a cross. Castlewarren is a sub-parish of Clara, County Kilkenny.\nSee also\n* List of towns and villages in Ireland\nReferences"
