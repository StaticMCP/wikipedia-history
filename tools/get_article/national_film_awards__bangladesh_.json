Every year, a national panel appointed by the government selects the winning entries.\nHistory\nThe National Film Awards were first presented in 1975. The government of Bangladesh offers the National Film Awards to the films and individuals for notable contributions to the art of cinema. Beginning in 1975, The National Film Awards is an event that takes place annually that includes colorful programs, dance, and music. The awards are the only film awards awarded by the government of Bangladesh.\nNo awards were given in 1981 because the panel determined that no film was competent enough to receive an award.\nJuries and rules\nThe juries are appointed by the Bangladesh Film Censor Board, a department under the Ministry of Information of the government of Bangladesh. The board members are chosen from a variety of professions; it has previously included social workers, government officers, educators, journalists, filmmakers, film producers, actors, and poets. The board also provides secretarial assistance and manages screenings of films submitted for the National Film Award.
