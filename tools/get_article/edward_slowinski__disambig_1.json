Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, he spent most of his career with the New York Rangers.\nCareer\nSlowinski began his junior career with the Winnipeg Monarchs in the playoffs of the 1940-41 season, scoring two goals in three games. He stayed in Winnipeg for one more season before moving on to the Ottawa Army and then Ottawa Commandos. Over the next few years he went from team to team - the Red Deer Rangers, Calgary and Winnipeg Navy, and the Ottawa Senators - before making it to the NHL. The New York Rangers put Slowinski into their lineup for the 1947-48 season and, despite playing a handful of games for their AHL team, he was a New York Ranger for his whole career.\nIn the 1949-50 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Rangers were up three games to two over the Red Wings when the Wings came back and took the championship in overtime of the seventh game. Slowinski led all scorers in assists that playoff year but never held the Stanley Cup. He played five more seasons of pro hockey in the AHL before retiring after the 1957–58 season.\nCareer statistics\nRegular season and playoffs\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"|\n! rowspan=\"100\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"|\n! colspan=\"5\"|Regular season\n! rowspan=\"100\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"|\n! colspan=\"5\"|Playoffs\n|- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n!
