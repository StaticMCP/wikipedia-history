The battle pitted the Umayyad forces of the Emirate of Córdoba under Abu-Abdallah against the troops of the Kingdom of León under Ordoño II of León. The battle resulted in a Leonese victory.\nContext\nIn 912, Ordoño II ordered the repoblación of San Esteban de Gormaz as the city had been one of the borderline cities between the Moorish and Christian zones of the Iberian Peninsula. This region had become depopulated early in the Muslim takeover and acted as a buffer zone between the two groups.\nThe battle\nUpon hearing of Ordoño II's efforts to repopulate and take control of the city, Abi-Abda ordered a siege in 917. Ordoño II was able to come to the city's aid successfully and routed the Muslim forces. Abi-Abda himself was captured during the fray and executed by decapitation. His head was put on display on the city's ramparts as a warning to the Muslims.\nAftermath\nA similar battle took place in 919, where the Muslims were repulsed. However, by 920 the city was again in Muslim hands. The city changed hands several times until 1054 when the Christian forces permanently retook the town under the command of Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, also known as el Cid.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
