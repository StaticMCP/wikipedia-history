Russian Empire\n| combatant2        =  Japan\n| commander1        =  Silnitsky Anton Petrovych\n| commander2        =  Tōgō Heihachirō\n| strength1         = Unknown\n| strength2         = 800–1,000\n| casualties1       = Unknown\n| casualties2       = Unknown\n}}\nBackground\nThe Russo-Japanese War created an extremely unfavorable situation for Kamchatka. Communication with the rest of Russia was already extremely tenuous, being maintained with steamships that called at the port of Petropavlovsk, as well as using dog sleds. No preparatory measures were taken to strengthen coastal defenses, and no new weapons were brought in. Although certain steps on the part of Japan were already noticeable.\nJapan, taking advantage of Kamchatka's almost complete isolation from Russia's control, conducted constant poaching of salmon in the mouths of Kamchatka rivers during spawning season. No one could stop the fishing schooners, as the Kamchatka administration at that time had no ships of its own to patrol the coasts. The Japanese, taking advantage of this, were secretly conducting constant monitoring and reconnaissance of the Kamchatka coasts; with the help of these same schooners, intelligence agents were sent to the peninsula under the guise of fishermen. This allowed the Japanese Empire to freely obtain all the necessary information regarding the peninsula's defense capabilities. Also, on the island of Shumshu, adjacent to Kamchatka and separated from it by a narrow strait, a Japanese fishing village was established. In reality, it was a disguised military bridgehead for a rapid military strike against Kamchatka. Soldiers who had undergone appropriate training were stationed on the island under the guise of fishermen. Russia couldn’t fully monitor what was happening in the Far East also due to the following objective reasons:\nExtremely tense international situation in 1902–1904. Huge financial expenditures on the construction of heavy ships for the Pacific and Baltic Fleets.\nComplex internal political situation – competition between various \"parties\" and groupings both in the Tsar's entourage and in financial circles. The heads of the peninsula's administration changed quite often. Taking advantage of the weak connection with \"Russia,\" they quickly adapted and abused their official powers. And since Kamchatka at that time was one of the world's main suppliers of the highest quality furs, there were many financial temptations.\nFurthermore, a fur auction operated on the peninsula, with an annual turnover of tens of thousands of rubles. All this contributed to extreme corruption among both the administration and the merchants. It is known that merchants, and even townspeople, used cheap alcohol to buy the most valuable furs from the local population – the Koryaks, Ainu, and Itelmen. Objective information about the state of affairs in Kamchatka was not sent to St. Petersburg until 1904; all violations and shortcomings were concealed – which is not surprising, since it was almost impossible for St. Petersburg to verify this information.\nOn the peninsula, since the Petropavlovsk defense during the Crimean War, warehouses with weapons remained, containing outdated Berdan rifles and a large number of cartridges for them (Berdan rifles were brought to the peninsula in 1885 and 1900, and the Carle rifles stored before that were scrapped): at the same time, the preservation and combat readiness of the rifles subsequently proved to be of the highest level; the weapons were lubricated and had not suffered during long-term storage. This was a great advantage for the defense and, in essence, played a decisive role. Shortly before the start of the Russo-Japanese War, in 1903, A. P. Silnitsky was appointed the head of the Petropavlovsk district (that is, the de facto governor of all of Kamchatka), who had previously visited both the Kamchatka Peninsula and Chukotka on several occasions. Being an honest and energetic person, he waged an extremely intense struggle against corruption in Petropavlovsk, achieved the competent and lawful conduct of the fur auction, and personally collected yasak. Silnitsky also fought against widespread drunkenness in Kamchatka, ordering the closure of all taverns and drinking establishments in Petropavlovsk; he did not allow the export of alcohol from the city during the fur purchasing season. All these actions turned part of the local elite against him, and subsequently, they declared him to be suffering from schizophrenic disorder. A denunciation and a memorandum were also drawn up against Silnitsky and sent to St. Petersburg – which greatly hindered Silnitsky in the future.\nBattle\nIn 1904, with the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War, A. P. Silnitsky took a series of proactive steps to prepare Kamchatka for defense. He issued an appeal to the population to join a voluntary militia. Silnitsky promptly distributed the available rifles and ammunition to all who wanted them. Additionally, weapons were delivered to almost all villages on the Kamchatka coast via dog sleds. The population was instructed to retreat inland if large enemy forces appeared.\nThe initial clashes involving the militia were with schooner crews attempting to enter coastal waters, particularly those rich in fish, for fishing. Given the wartime situation and the risk of landings and espionage, the militiamen acted decisively, and these crews were eliminated. There were also several landings by Japanese armed forces, ranging in size from 50 to 100 soldiers. One such landing resulted in the capture of the village of Yavino, where a border post was erected with an inscription declaring the land now belonged to Japan. However, this detachment of approximately 90 men was soon systematically destroyed. The argument that these were merely fishermen, not Japanese army soldiers, who put up such a post to intimidate the local population seems unconvincing given the full-scale war between the two nations.\nSubsequently, the militiamen had to confront poaching attempts by relatively small groups of fishermen on schooners. The strategy remained to avoid open combat if soldiers landed and to engage only in guerrilla warfare. It was during the war that illegal incursions into territorial waters became bolder and more frequent, with fishermen often armed with firearms and melee weapons, offering active resistance.\nAttempts to arm the militia by delivering military supplies from the United States were undertaken and often successful. On May 4, 1904, the chartered steamship Redondo arrived in Petropavlovsk with military cargo. In July 1904, the steamship Mineola arrived, first delivering two Baranovsky landing guns to the Commander Islands, and then visiting several Kamchatka settlements before sinking on August 24 due to a navigational accident near Tigil. Voyages of ships under the American flag carrying Russian military cargo for Kamchatka continued into 1905. Two chartered American steamships, Australia and Montara, were unlucky; in the summer of 1905, Japanese cruisers captured them off the coast of the peninsula as war trophies.\nAftermath\nThanks to a well-organized defense, Kamchatka in 1904–1905 managed to repel the majority of attacks. The Japanese command was forced to acknowledge that the population was putting up determined resistance and that it was impossible to break it with small forces.\nThroughout the war, the militiamen repelled attacks from both poachers and soldiers. During the clashes, a peculiar characteristic was noted: Japanese detachments sometimes did not even loot villages but simply destroyed everything possible in the houses, apparently trying to demoralize the local population. Whenever possible, any administrative papers and archives were also destroyed, and financial resources and weapons were seized.\nThe successes in eliminating both fishermen and Japanese detachments of soldiers are quite understandable given the population's high level of familiarity with weapons. Many adult men were experienced trappers and hunters. Also, considering the weak police presence in Kamchatka, people were accustomed to defending themselves independently, especially in the interior of the peninsula.\nReference\n.Vorobyova E.
