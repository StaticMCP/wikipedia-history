This article attempts to compare different accounts of such traditions as they may vary or contradict each other.\nPredynastic period\nRuhanga and Nkya\nAccording to Ruth Alice Fisher, Petero Bikunya and A. R. Dunbar, there was only Ruhanga () and his brother Nkya () in the beginning. John Roscoe mentions the names Enkya and Enkyaya Enkya, who were generally considered \"subordinate gods\", however Nkore sources only mention Ruhanga.\nFisher goes on to state that after Nkya complained about nothing being created, Ruhanga created heaven and earth. He then threw a stone in the air to create the sun, and when Nkya could not escape the sun's heat, he withdrew the sun toward the west and covered it with a cloud. Afterwards, Ruhanga threw another stone upwards to create the moon. As Nkya was still unsatisfied, he created the male chicken to crow when night passes and tall trees to provide shade. Ruhanga commanded Nkya to stay on earth while he goes to heaven, which was closer to earth then and was propped up by a fig tree, a Uganda coral tree and a bar of iron. When he arrived, he noticed that his hands were dirty, so he washed them, and the water then fell onto earth as rain. Nkya was drenched in water and asked for shelter. Because Nkya was unable to break off tree branches, Ruhanga broke a stone into three pieces, which became a knife, an axe and a hammer, then gave them to Nkya to make a hut. Nkya then wanted things to look at, as the world was still very empty, so Ruhanga created shrubs, flowers, birds, insects and wild animals, as well as goats and sheep to accompany him.\nOne day, Nkya asked why bodies and stomachs were created, as they seemed to be useless. Ruhanga then created cows, felled a tree, and carved a milking bowl out of said tree. Nkya was delighted, but he suggested creating something more solid. Thus Ruhanga took a vine and planted it, and very quickly it produced many gourds. He ordained the usage of fruit and leaves as fruit and commanded Nkya to cut off the young shoots so that the fruit would grow close at hand and the vine would not spread over the ground, where it could be trampled on by cattle. Ruhanga also created a clay pot which was put on three small ant-hills, and then put fruit in the pot and wood under the pot. He then struck a rock, where the sun had shone, with a rock, and the subsequent fire ignited the wood, and it would have ignited the gourds as well if Ruhanga did not pour water on them. He asked Nkya to probe the gourds with a stick to see when they become soft and ready to eat, but Nkya was so eager to eat that he burned himself. Ruhanga rebuked him, and taught him how to lay leaves on the ground to turn out the food upon them. After Nkya said that the food was very good, Ruhanga said that he had supplied all that Nkya needed, but it would have been better for humanity if he did not listen to his stomach because it would cause pain, work and theft. Nkya replied by saying that humans would only submit to someone who provides them with food. Ruhanga then agreed to leave the desire for food in the world. He took two bags named Hunger and Mercy, and poured their contents over the world.\nAfterwards, Nkya had four sons. One of them was named Kantu (), but the other sons had no individual names, and they were all called Kana (). Nkya explained this to Ruhanga, who said that the sons should visit him next afternoon to be tested and given unique names. When they arrived, Ruhanga gave the sons one milk pot each and sent them home.\nKintu and Kati\nAccording to John W. Nyakatura and K.W. (standing for Kabalega and Winyi), Kintu () and his wife Kati () were the first people on earth, originating from either Sudan or Abyssinia. Like Nkya, Kintu was said to have three sons, although they already had the names of Kairu (the first son), Kahuma (the second son) and Kakama (the third son). When Kintu became older, he worried about who would be his successor. He decided to test his sons to see who would be the best person to succeed him. In Beattie's account, the three sons were all named Kana, and Kintu asked God for permission to test them, and God agreed.\nFirst test\nRuhanga/Kintu then placed six objects on a crossroads or path for the sons to come across: an ox head, a cowhide thong, a bundle of cooked millet and potatoes, a grass head-ring, an axe and a knife. The first son took the bundle of food, the head-ring, the axe and the knife. The second son took the thong, and the third took the ox head. This test is not mentioned in Nyakatura's account.\nSecond test\nIn the evening, after milking some cows and filling three bowls with milk, Ruhanga/Kintu announced to the children that the second test involved guarding the pots on their laps so that they would not spill until morning. At midnight, the third child doze off, spilling some of his milk. The other two brothers gave some of their milk to him out of sympathy. Just before dawn, the first child spilt all of his milk, and his brothers refused to give some to him. At dawn, Ruhanga/Kintu saw that the first child's pot was empty, the second child's pot was nearly full, and the third child's pot was completely full.\nEvaluation\nMost accounts agree that Ruhanga/Kintu then named the first son Kairu, the second Kahuma and the third Kakama, but Nyakatura's account states that the sons were given these names prior to the tests. Kairu was cursed to be a servant for the other two sons, Kahuma was expected to herd cattle and Kakama was to rule over all men. This story is meant to explain the origin of the social classes of Bairu, Bahuma and Bakama.\nTembuzi dynasty\nThe Tembuzi dynasty was a legendary African dynasty which are said to have ruled the Empire of Kitara in modern-day Uganda.\nLegends\nFisher wrote that Kakama Twale became the first king of Kitara, whilst K. W. and Nyakatura consider Kakama () and Twale (Itwale in K.W.'s account) to be separate kings. In their accounts, Kintu was succeeded by Kakama, who was succeeded by (I)twale. Roscoe and Bikunya only mention \"Twale\" and \"Twari\" respectively.\nNyakatura then mentions that Twale's son, Hangi, succeeded him. Roscoe mentions Hangi and Nyamenge being the king after Hangi, although he wrote that there is no more information available about them. In Nyakatura's account, Hangi has two children: Ira lya Hangi () and Kazooba ka Hangi (). Julien Gorju states that Ira and Kazooba were direct sons of Ruhanga, as Hangi was the Nyoro name for Ruhanga. Nyakatura states that Kazooba succeeded Ira after he died without an heir. Roscoe states that Kabangera succeeded Ira, but there is no more information about him, although some timelines consider Kazooba and Kabangera to be the same person.\nIn Nyakatura's account, there was a notable population increase during Kazooba's reign, and he was loved by his subjects so much that he was deified after his death and succession by Nyamuhanga. Nyamuhanga was sterile for a long time, so he consulted a witch doctor who told him to marry Nyabagabe, the daughter of Igoro, one of Nyamuhanga's servants. Nyabagabe's son was then named Nkya () by Nyamuhanga. Under Nyamuhanga, there was also an increase in population and he was deified after his death and succession by Nkya I. Due to the similarities between Kazooba and Nyamuhanga, Gorju analyses them as the same person. Nyakatura writes that Nkya I was succeeded by Nkya II, and Nkya II was succeeded by Baba (). Nkya I also had to consult a witch doctor due to his infertility, and his resultant son was given the same name as him. Due to these similarities, Gorju analyses Nkya I and Nkya II as the same person. Fisher writes that Baba succeeded Kakama, but Roscoe implies that Baba succeeded Kabangera. Carole Ann Buchanan states that Baba was said to be wealthy, having many people and goats, and Fisher states that this prosperity was shared with the ever-increasing populace.\nNyakatura and K.W. write that Baba was succeeded by, in chronological order, Kamuli, Nseka (), Kudidi (who reigned for longer than usual), Ntonzi (who put down rebellions, ), Nyakahongerwa () and Mukonko (who also reigned for longer than usual).All other accounts mentioned beforehand state that Baba was succeeded directly by Mukonko. Regardless, all accounts agree that Mukonko was succeeded by Ngonzaki (, as he was very wealthy) Rutahinduka ().\nIsaza\nIsaza Waraga Rugambanabato Nyakikooto was the second-to-last Tembuzi king according to most accounts, although K.W. states that Ngonzaki was succeeded by Isaza Mukama, then Isaza Nyakikooto. As a young monarch, he favored fellow young people over older people, banishing his old counselors and replacing them with young ones. He was also a hunter, and one day, he killed a zebra whilst hunting with his friends, who persuaded Isaza to wear its hide. The hide was sewn with leather thongs and he was delighted by it. When he started hunting again, the sun's heat dried his hide to the point where he felt pain and discomfort. After reporting this to his friends, they mocked him, having no solution to the problem.\nIn Nyakatura's account, some of Isaza's friends then told Koogere (Isaza's aunt) and Nyangoma (his sister) about the situation. Koogere and Nyangoma summoned some of their old servants to rescue Isaza. Once there, the servants ordered Isaza's friends to dip him in a river, and they did so. In Fisher's account, there were two old counselors who managed to avoid exile. Isaza sent a message to them asking what he should do, but they refused and told him to consult his young counselors. However, one of the two men relented, saying they should save Isaza for the sake of his father, Ngonzaki. So they ordered Isaza's young men to bring Isaza into their house, where they threw him into a pond. In all accounts, the hide was loosened enough for the old men to cut the thongs and release Isaza, thereby saving his life. Isaza was so grateful that he threw a banquet to celebrate the elderly, reinstating their positions as counselors and telling the youth to respect their elders.\nIsaza was also said to be the first king to divide Kitara into counties (,  ).\nNyamiyonga\nNyamiyonga () was the king of the underworld (). In Nkore tradition, he is called Ruyonga and is the king of Nkore. Nyamiyonga was said to have sent one messenger or multiple messengers to present to Isaza several riddles, from which Isaza was meant to deduce what Nyamiyonga wanted from him: that which announces the dawn (), that which does not finish the job (), the rope that binds water (), that which makes Isaza turn (), that which is unknown () and the little door of poverty (), although the fourth riddle is absent from Bikunya's account. Isaza, baffled by the riddles, called a meeting with his counselors to figure out the meaning of them, but this meeting solved nothing. It eventually transpired that either Koogere (per Nyakatura) or the queen of Isaza (per Fisher) had a maid called Kazana () who claimed to be able to solve the riddles. Kazana requested that various objects and animals be brought to her, and explained that the cock announces the dawn, a dog does not finish the job as it was given a smoking pipe but only stared at it, the rope that binds water is millet flour as it absorbs the water it is cooked in, a calf makes Isaza turn after it lowed, a baby is unknown as it sat on Isaza's lap and scratched his face and wetted his clothes and a blood pact is the door that shuts out poverty because if someone is poor, they can rely on their blood brother for help.\nKazana suggested that Isaza should make a blood pact with Nyamiyonga, but Isaza was unsure about it and asked his chiefs for advice. Fisher writes that his chiefs advised him not to do it because making a blood pact with someone from the underworld would be \"fearful\", so they urged him to choose someone to do it on his behalf. Thus, Isaza sent his servant Kwezi () to do so. Nyakatura gives the name of a particular chief, Kyarunda, who advised Isaza not to do it because he has never met nor seen Nyamiyonga. Isaza agreed, but since customs say that one should not reject an offer of friendship, Isaza sent his gatekeeper Bukuku to do it for him. When Nyamiyonga heard about the deception, either from his messengers (per Nyakatura) or a servant who accompanied his messengers (per Fisher), accounts agree that he was angry as he became the blood brother of a commoner (omwiru, i.e. a descendant of Kairu). He was determined to bring Isaza into his control, so he dispatched Nyamata (), the most beautiful of his daughters, to Isaza's palace in order to trick Isaza into going into the underworld. Whilst Fisher says that Bukuku asked where she came came from and she said \"from yonder,\" Nyakatura implies that Bukuku did not bother to interrogate her due to her beauty. Regardless, accounts agree that when Bukuku told Isaza about Nyamata's beauty, Isaza sent her sister Runyunyuzi to inspect said beauty, and she said there was no one more beautiful in the kingdom than her. When he eventually met Nyamata, Isaza loved her so much that he took her as a wife.\nNyamata eventually figured out that Isaza loved his cattle more than her, although when and how she did this varies among accounts. Nyakatura says that one day she asked him directly what he loves more, and Isaza answered that he loves both equally. Later, when they were sitting together, his cattle strayed towards their direction, and Isaza suddenly got up and went to find out how they were. Nyamata was furious, and he told her to not be angry, saying that he loses all sense of proportion when he sees cows. Fisher says that during the \"time for milking\", they were standing in the doorway watching cattle being brought in, and Isaza followed the cows into a shed. Nyamata told him that he should not leave her alone, but Isaza said that he want to see his cows. That evening, Nyamata refused to attend to him, so Isaza sent a messenger to her, saying that although he loves her over all his wives, he loves his cows more. Regardless, after figuring this out, Nyamata went back to the underworld and told Nyamiyonga about Isaza's love for cattle, where she then gave birth to a boy called Isimbwa. Nyamiyonga decided to choose two of his best cattle from his herds, a bull called Ruhogo () and a cow called Kahogo (), and he sent them to Isaza's palace. When Isaza saw them, he loved them over any other cows in his herd. One day, Ruhogo and Kahogo ran away to Nyamiyonga's palace. Isaza followed them into the underworld, where he was reunited with Nyamata and Isimbwa. However, Nyamiyonga prevented him from ever leaving the underworld as punishment for joining him with a commoner in a blood pact.\nBukuku\nBukuku was the last Tembuzi king, notable for being the only Tembuzi king from a clan other than the Gabu clan, the Ranzi clan. After proclaiming himself king, the chiefs of most of the counties rebelled against him, as Bukuku was a commoner (omwiru), and the people did not think he deserved to be king. Fisher and Dunbar state that Bukuku had to retreat to the south-west of Kitara and Bikunya states that Bukuku only ruled over Kikwenusi, Kisegwe and Kijagarazi, although the location of said places are unknown.\nBukuku's only child was a daughter called Nyinamwiru (). One day, witch-doctors came to Bukuku and either advised him to kill Nyinamwiru because her beauty would bring misfortune (per Nyakatura) or advised him to prevent her from marrying because her son would kill Bukuku (per Fisher). When she grew older, he built a house for her that could only be entered through Bukuku's palace in order to seclude her from the outside world. To attend to her needs, he also gave Nyinamwiru either a maid called Mugizi or two servants; an old man and his wife. Nyakatura writes that Bukuku also cut off one of her breasts and gouged out one of her eyes to make her less attractive, whilst Fisher writes that she was born with only one eye and one ear and that he consulted the witch-doctors because of these birth defects.\nFamily trees\nChwezi dynasty\n}}\n| final_ruler = Wamara\n}}The Chwezi dynasty was a legendary African dynasty which are said to have ruled the Empire of Kitara after the Tembuzi dynasty.\nLegends\nOrigins\nThe Chwezi dynasty is traced back to Isimbwa, the son of Isaza. When Isimbwa grew up, Nyamiyonga arranged a marriage between him and a woman from the underworld called Nyabiryo, and they had a son named Kyomya. Afterwards, he left the underworld and began hunting in various places, accompanied by many other people. One day, he reached Kitara, then ruled by Bukuku.\nNyakatura states that he and his followers paid a visit to Bukuku and gave him many gifts at his palace. Mugizi, the maid of Bukuku's daughter, saw this and told Nyinamwiru, Bukuku's daughter, how good-looking and rich they were. She told Mugizi to ask Isimbwa to pay her a visit, and he agreed, but asked her to wait for a good opportunity. He also sent her some gifts. Isimbwa and his followers then left the palace and went to Kisozi. He left all but two men there, and returned to Nyinamwiru. Fisher states that Isimbwa saw a maid carrying a pitcher to a well to draw water and when he learnt that she was a maid of Nyinamwiru, he gave some flowers to the maid, telling her to tell Nyinamwiru that he sent her the flowers and will return to marry her in four days. After the maid did so, Nyinamwiru sent her to watch for Isimbwa in case he forgets to marry her. Four days later, Isimbwa returned. In any case, accounts agree that Isimbwa used a ladder to climb into Nyinamwiru's house and stayed with her for several months, then he left, promising to return soon. Afterwards, Nyinamwiru gave birth to a son who would be named Ndahura.\nNdahura\nNdahura (, also named Karubumbi ()) and Isimbwa later called him Ndahura after his millitary conquests. Nyakatura says that he was first called Ndahura \"from Bukuku's words\", and later became known as Kyarubimba when he was being raised by Dubumbi.}} was the first Chwezi king of Kitara and the son of Isimbwa and Nyinamwiru. When he was born, Bukuku, Nyinamwiru's father and the then king of Kitara, was surprised that she had a child despite his measures enforced to seclude her from the outside world. Thus, Bukuku ordered Ndahura to be thrown into a river.\nHowever, either Ndahura's necklace or his umbilical cord got stuck to a tree, where he was found alive by a potter named Rubumbi (). Rubumbi then told Nyinamwiru that her child was safe, but Bukuku still thought he was dead.\nNdahura grew up to be a courageous and insolent man, and he began to tend Rubumbi's sheep. Fisher says he used to dig holes in the road for people to fall into, and drink or pour out beer that people carried towards Bukuku. Accounts agree that he was often in trouble with Bukuku's herdsmen, as when they were watering their cattle, he would drive away the cattle so that his own cattle could be watered first. Eventually, the herdsmen reported this to Bukuku, who promised to give Ndahura a beating.\nOne day, Bukuku went to the watering place himself with his stool to see what Ndahura would do. Ndahura drove the herdsmen's cattle away, as usual. Nyakatura states that Bukuku then hurled a spear at him, but missed, so Ndahura took the spear and killed Bukuku with it. Fisher states that Bukuku ordered the herdsmen to grab Ndahura and bring him to him, and as they brought him around the back of the stool, he speared Bukuku in the chest, making him fall forward into the trough and die. Regardless, accounts agree that sat down on the king's stool and proclaimed himself king. When Nyinamwiru heard what happened, she exclaimed \"my ears cause me to hear evil and good\" (), because although her father was killed, her son would reign over Kitara and succeed his grandfather. Fisher and Dunbar wrote that the people were overjoyed as he resembled his paternal grandfather, Isaza.\nBecause the rebellious chiefs refused to submit to Ndahura, he led a series of campaigns to regain the lands formerly ruled by Isaza. Fisher wrote that his first campaign was against Ntale (chief of Ankole), causing him to surrender, but Nyakatura, Buchanan and Bikunya wrote that his first campaign was against Nsinga, chief of Bugoma. However, all of these accounts agree that Nsinga was executed after being accused of witchcraft. Places that Ndahura was said to have annexed include Buruli, Karagwe, Sukuma, Rwanda, Busoga, Ankole, Tooro, Bunyara, Busongora, Bulega, Bukidi, Buganda and Madi, although accounts often disagree on the chronology of these campaigns and expeditions.\nAccounts agree that one day, Ndahura disappeared and did not return home, however the reason for this is disputed. Fisher and Dunbar wrote that while Ndahura was waiting for Wamara, his son, to return from an expedition, Ndahura was swallowed up by the earth and stayed in the underworld with his servant for two days. Nyakatura and Apuuli wrote that during a campaign in Ihangiro against Bwirebutakya (), Ndahura was captured as \"darkness fell upon Ndahura's army\",}} and K. W. and Albert B. Lloyd wrote that Ndahura was killed in said campaign.\nMulindwa\nMulindwa was either the second Chwezi king or simply a deputy or regent who ruled when Ndahura was missing, according to K. W., John Beattie, Nyakatura and Dunbar.\nAccording to Nyakatura, Kyomya and a few hand-picked people went to Ihangiro as spies to discover Ndahura's fate, taking tobacco and coffee to sell on the way. Kyomya eventually found Ndahura and his servant and stole them away to Kitara.\nWamara\nWamara was the last Chwezi king of Kitara. Nyakatura wrote that Wamara was chosen to succeed Ndahura after some deliberation, Dunbar wrote that Ndahura appointed Mulindwa yet Wamara seized the throne, and Fisher wrote that Ndahura reluctantly allowed Wamara to reign.\nThe Chwezi, especially Wamara, generally lost the respect of the people as Wamara's rule was malicious and tensions rose among themselves (e.g. Nyangoma's attempted murder of Mugenyi, Ndahura's half brother). Misango, from the south, was said to have raided Chwezi cattle with his army, but was later killed. Fisher wrote that Mugasa, Wamara's uncle and chief of the Sese Islands, rebelled against him, although the uprising was quickly squashed. Fisher and Dunbar then wrote that Bihogo, Mugenyi's rare ox which gave fragrance to whatever water she drank, had a fit and died, and that Wamara ordered witch doctors to dissect her. Nyakatura, Beattie, Apuuli wrote that Wamara, troubled by misfortunes, summoned his witch doctors to explain the meaning of them, who then slaughtered some bull calves for divination. Nevertheless, accounts agree that the cattle's body was empty and had no organs, and the witch doctors were surprised.\nThere happened to be two brothers, Nyakoka and Karango, who came from Bukidi, and Nyakoka said that he would solve the mystery if he entered into a blood pact with one of the Chwezi. Nyakoka made a blood pact with either Mulindwa (according to Nyakatura, Beattie and Apuuli) or Mugenyi (according to Fisher and Dunbar). He then split the head and hooves with a hatchet, all the internal organs fell out, and an irremovable black smut settled on those organs. Nyakoka is said to have explained that the empty body signified the end of Chwezi rule, the organs being in unusual places signified that the Chwezi will pack up their belongings and move elsewhere, the organs in the head specifically signified that they will still rule through the \"spirit mediumship\" cult and the unremovable black smut signified that the country would be ruled by foreigners with darker skin. The Chwezi were disappointed by this interpretation, and would have killed Nyakoka if he was not told of this beforehand by his blood brother and escaped. They eventually decided to abandon Kitara.\nFamily tree\n}}\nReferences\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*\n*  |year=1920 |location=Rennes |language=fr |trans-title=Among Victoria, Albert and Edward: ethnography of the English part of the vicariate of Uganda: origins, history, religion, customs}}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
