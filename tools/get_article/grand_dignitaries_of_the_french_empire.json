The seven Grand Dignitaries broadly paralleled the Great Officers of the Crown which had existed under the Ancien Régime and were essentially honorific, although several limited functions were ascribed to them in the new constitution of the Empire. In the imperial nobility, the Grand Dignitaries ranked in status directly behind the Princes of France, although in practice, most Grand Dignitaries also held the title of Prince.\nIn 1807, two new dignitaries were created, a further two in 1809, and another in 1810, raising the final number to twelve. Many of the dignitaries were also members of the Imperial Family, with those that were not being high-ranking figures in the imperial administration. The Grand Dignitaries were abolished along with the First Empire in 1814 upon the Bourbon Restoration, the Great Officers of the Crown being reinstated, and were not restored under the Second Empire.\nGrand Dignitaries of the Empire\nAppointed in 1804\n* Jean de Cambacérès, Archchancellor of the Empire\n* Eugène de Beauharnais, Archchancellor of State\n* Charles-François Lebrun, Archtreasurer\n* Joseph Bonaparte, Grand Elector\n* Louis Bonaparte, Grand Constable\n* Joachim Murat, Grand Admiral\n* Louis-Alexandre Berthier, Grand Huntsman\nAppointed in 1805\n* Joseph Fesch, Grand Almoner\nAppointed in 1807\n* Charles de Talleyrand-Périgord, Vice-Grand Elector\n* Louis-Alexandre Berthier, Vice-Grand Constable\nAppointed in 1809\n* Camillo Borghese, Governor-General of the Departments Beyond the Alps\n* Elisa Bonaparte, Grand Duchess of Tuscany\nAppointed in 1810\n* Charles-François Lebrun, Governor-General of the Departments of Holland\nGallery\nFile:Jean-Jacques-Régis de Cambacérès.jpg|Jean-Jacques-Régis de Cambacérès\nFile:EugeneBeau.jpg|Eugène de Beauharnais\nFile:Charles François Lebrun prince architrésorier de l'Empire.jpg|Charles-François Lebrun\nFile:Joseph-Bonaparte.jpg|Joseph Bonaparte\nFile:LouisBonaparte Holland.jpg|Louis Bonaparte\nFile:Murat2.jpg|Joachim Murat\nFile:Joseph Fesch.jpg|Joseph Fesch\nFile:Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord - Pierre-Paul Prud'hon.jpg|Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord\nFile:Louis-Alexandre Berthier.png|Louis-Alexandre Berthier\nFile:Camille Borghèse.jpg|Camillo Borghese\nFile:Elisa Baciocchi Franque Joseph.jpg|Elisa Bonaparte\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/legislation/c_constitution12.html#title5 Constitution of the Year XII – Grand Dignitaries of the Empire]"
