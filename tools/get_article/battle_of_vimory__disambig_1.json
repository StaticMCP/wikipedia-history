After having pillaged the Lorraine region, they arrived in Burgundy and entered into the Beauce region. However, conflicts divided the two commanders and their German and Swiss troops.\nThe Swiss troops were surprised by Henry of Guise's army, and were routed.  The reiters retreated to the castle of Auneau and the Swiss decided to negotiate with the royal troops.\nNotes and references\n* Jouanna, Arlette and Jacqueline Boucher, Dominique Biloghi, Guy Thiec.
