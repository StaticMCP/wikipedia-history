During World War II, the building was occupied and used for the storage of armaments by the Germans. The building suffered extensive damage during the war. Between 1951 and 1955 the building was reconstructed, with a slightly modified architectural style. In 2007, the building underwent extensive renovation works, as part of more extensive works to revitalise the whole central campus.\nReferences"
