DEMAS, and the organizations within focus on supporting democracy and upholding human and civil rights within the Czech republic and internationally. They state their mission as being \"Ready to serve the cause of democracy, human rights and civil society whenever and wherever the need arises.\" Funding for DEMAS initially came mostly from the Czech Republic government, and through programs meant to offer funding for NGOs, such as the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). NED funding is given out by the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs. DEMAS is also funded by the European Union, European Commission, private donors, and other governmental grants and funds.\nDEMAS works with other NGOs and groups through both local and international partners to undertake the work of assisting them in their causes. They work to create links between Czech and international organizations, creating a transnational support network for NGOs. In addition to allowing NGOs to work around possible blocking factors in their countries that prevent them from doing their work, DEMAS also works to help other organizations obtain funding. They also organize and host seminars and workshops on human and civil rights, and democracy.\nFunding\nEach organization participating within DEMAS has their own independent forms and initiatives for funding; some are non-profit, and others funded entirely by private donation. DEMAS was initially funded by the Czech ministry of foreign affairs but is now supported by membership fees, private donations and grants for which it qualifies. DEMAS is fiscally independent from any government and so all action and initiatives undertaken by the organization are decided internally from members of the organization. DEMAS is one of many organizations that are in part funded by NED (National Endowment for Democracy); NED are a non-profit organization funded by the US government to give grants and funding to organizations who focus on democracy.\nActivities\nDEMAS produces annual reports on the activities and actions of its member organizations which outline their work and initiatives, and plans for the future. Their first report was produced 1 year after their creation (2008) in 2009 and they have continued producing them through 2016, with their 2012 report being the largest they have ever produced. They work in conjunction with many of their partners to host a multitude of public events every year to maintain public awareness and interaction with many of the issues they are working towards. They are also a consistent participant in the annual NGO market put on by one of their members, Forum 2000, where they serve to interact with the general public and hand out educational material on the work of their member NGOs, organizations, and their missions; this is their largest activity apart from creating a space for information sharing, to raise awareness and start conversations about democracy in the public sphere.\nRole\nDEMAS serves as a body in which all members can freely interact and support one another, allowing for the creation of smaller networks within the overarching network of DEMAS itself. This results in a large transnational network of organizations with similar missions and initiatives or skills that help increase professionalism and expertise for each organization, to more effectively run their undertakings and support of democracy, especially for organizations who operate in hostile environments. This large network of support allows each group to have more influence at home and abroad, which in turn allows them to have a larger positive impact. DEMAS also act as a partner with their members in setting up and hosting debates, seminars, summits, conferences, and workshops, throughout the year many members of DEMAS such as Forum 2000 host summits or other events that are often mediated by DEMAS as well as promoted by them. Without the support that is available, many organizations may not have near the influence or effectiveness they have due to their vast support of knowledgeable organizations.\nStaff\nBoard of directors\nSylva Horáková\nJakub Klepal\nPavel Pšeja (chairman)\nMarek Svoboda (Vice-chairperson)\nVladimíra Votavová\nExecutive director\nSabina Malcová\nProject Coordinator\nVeronika Soporská\nMembers\nDEMAS has 16 participating members (including observer status members):\nAgora (Central Europe) are focused on promoting and improving standards and methods involved with political life in the Czech Republic, post-Soviet satellites, and the Balkan states.
