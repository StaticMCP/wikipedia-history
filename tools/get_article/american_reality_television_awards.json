It is presented by the Academy of Reality Television and is the first awards show to recognize talent on screen and behind the scenes of reality television.\nIn November 2023, the 10th Annual ARTAS Show was held, and it received more than two million votes in all categories.\nHistory\nThe ARTAS was founded by executive producers Kristen Moss and Andrew Ward with the intention of supporting, examining, and redefining the art of reality in media by rewarding quality, promoting experimentation, and acknowledging that the audience is at the center of the entertainment industry.\nIn 2013, the first awards were given out for excellence in front of and behind the camera in all aspects of unscripted television. Since then, the awards have been presented to recognize and promote the vast array of content that has brought reality television to the forefront of entertainment.\nIn 2014, the American Reality Television Awards also inaugurated a Humanitarian Award, which eventually became the Reality Television Hall of Fame. This award's notable honorees include former President Donald Trump, Heidi Montag, Spencer Pratt, and Janice Dickinson. Ellen DeGeneres, Steve Harvey, Leah Remini, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Gordon Ramsay, Abby Lee Miller, and RuPaul are among the notable figures who have won trophies in various categories for all nine ARTAS Awards.\nIn 2021, Chayce Beckham received ARTAS Award for Outstanding Judging Panel.\nIn 2023, The American Reality Television Awards were honored to be awarded 3 Telly Awards in the categories of Online Entertainment, Social Video General, and Non-Broadcast Low Budget.\n10th American Reality Television Awards (2023)\nThe 10th Annual ARTAS premiered on December 19, 2023, exclusively on YouTube.
