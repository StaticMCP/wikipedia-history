The standard bearer was later killed in a judicial duel connected to this humiliating retreat. King Henry escaped with his life but had suffered a humiliating set back. Realising that further confronting the Plantagenet king would be a highly risky affair, the subsequent peace agreement between Henry and Owain saw the latter buy peace with a certain number of cattle and, although he also cedes Tegeingl to Henry; it is recovered into Welsh hands in the late 1160s.

Although Henry cites bad weather as the reason for his withdrawal, the Welsh troops, under the same skies, remained in the field; from now on, Owain is considered prince of Wales.
