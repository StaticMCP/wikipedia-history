She was a two-time Honda Sports Award winner, a three-time first team All-American, the Pac-10 Champion in 1993 and 1995 and led ASU to team titles in 1993, 1994 and 1995. She graduated in 1995 with a degree in business Management.\nIn 1994, she won the U.S. Women's Amateur and represented the U.S. in the Curtis Cup, the biennial team competition between amateur golfers from the United States and those from Great Britain and Ireland.\nProfessional career\nWard turned professional in 1995 and qualified for the LPGA Tour on her first attempt to become a rookie in 1996. Her first win came at the 1997 Fieldcrest Cannon Classic where she set both the all-time 54 and 72-hole LPGA scoring records; both records have since been broken.\nShe won four tournaments on the tour. Her best season was 2001, when she finished 12th on the official LPGA Tour money list.\nWard was a member of the 2002, 2003 and 2005 U.S. Solheim Cup teams. She was also selected as an assistant captain to Juli Inkster for the 2015 Solheim Cup team.\nPersonal life\nWard lives on a  cattle ranch in Edwall, Washington where she operates a cow/calf beef operation with her husband, Nate Hair.\nProfessional wins (4)\nLPGA Tour wins (4)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!No.\n!Date\n!Tournament\n!Winning score\n!Margin ofvictory\n!Runner(s)-up\n|-\n|1\n|Sep 28, 1997\n|Fieldcrest Cannon Classic\n|−23 (66-65-64-70=265)\n|2 strokes\n| Jane Geddes Rosie Jones\n|-\n|2\n|Feb 21, 1998\n|Cup Noodles Hawaiian Ladies Open\n|−4 (65-69-70=204)\n|Playoff\n| Dana Dormann\n|-\n|3\n|Aug 12, 2001\n|Wendy's Championship for Children\n|−21 (65-62-68=195)\n|3 strokes\n| Moira Dunn Annika Sörenstam\n|-\n|4\n|Apr 16, 2005\n|LPGA Takefuji Classic\n|−16 (65-68-67=200)\n|2 strokes\n| Lorena Ochoa\n|}\nLPGA Tour playoff record (1–2)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!No.!!Year!!Tournament!!Opponent!!Result\n|-style=\"background:#B0E0E6;\"\n|1\n|1998\n|Cup Noodles Hawaiian Ladies Open\n| Dana Dormann\n|Won with par on first extra hole\n|-style=\"background:#F5DEB3;\"\n|2\n|2001\n|LPGA Champions Classic\n| Wendy Doolan\n|Lost to birdie on fifth extra hole\n|-style=\"background:#F5DEB3;\"\n|3\n|2003\n|Wendy's Championship for Children\n| Hee-Won Han\n|Lost to birdie on third extra hole\n|}\nResults in LPGA majors\nResults not in chronological order\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;text-align:center;\"\n!Tournament !! 1996 !! 1997 !! 1998 !! 1999 !! 2000\n|-\n|align=left|Chevron Championship\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|CUT\n|T33\n|T43\n|-\n|align=left|Women's PGA Championship\n|CUT\n|T25\n|style=\"background:yellow;\"|T4\n|CUT\n|style=\"background:yellow;\"|T3\n|-\n|align=left|U.S. Women's Open\n|T19\n|CUT\n|T19\n|T40\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|-\n|align=left|du Maurier Classic\n|T53\n|T16\n|T34\n|T20\n|T55\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;text-align:center;\"\n!Tournament !! 2001 !! 2002 !! 2003 !! 2004 !! 2005 !! 2006 !! 2007 !! 2008 !! 2009\n|-\n|align=left|Chevron Championship\n|T36\n|T36\n|T48\n|T28\n|T50\n|T35\n|WD\n|T58\n|T36\n|-\n|align=left|Women's PGA Championship\n|style=\"background:yellow;\"|T3\n|CUT\n|T11\n|T30\n|CUT\n|T16\n|CUT\n|CUT\n|CUT\n|-\n|align=left|U.S. Women's Open\n|T19\n|CUT\n|CUT\n|CUT\n|T36\n|T41\n|CUT\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|-\n|align=left|Women's British Open ^\n|CUT\n|T56\n|style=\"background:yellow;\"|T6\n|T56\n|CUT\n|T67\n|T23\n|T59\n|CUT\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;text-align:center;\"\n!Tournament !! 2010 !! 2011 !! 2012 !! 2013 !! ... !! 2024\n|-\n|align=left|Chevron Championship\n|CUT\n|T33\n|T56\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|-\n|align=left|U.S. Women's Open\n|T14\n|T34\n|CUT\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|-\n|align=left|Women's PGA Championship\n|T67\n|CUT\n|CUT\n|CUT\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|CUT\n|-\n|align=left|Women's British Open\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|CUT\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|-\n|align=left|The Evian Championship ^^\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" colspan=3|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|}\n^ The Women's British Open replaced the du Maurier Classic as an LPGA major in 2001.\n^^ The Evian Championship was added as a major in 2013.\nCUT = missed the half-way cut\nWD = withdrew\n\"T\" = tied\nSummary\n*Starts – 63\n*Wins – 0\n*2nd-place finishes – 0\n*3rd-place finishes – 2\n*Top 3 finishes – 2\n*Top 5 finishes – 3\n*Top 10 finishes – 4\n*Top 25 finishes – 14\n*Missed cuts – 23\n*Most consecutive cuts made – 8\n*Longest streak of top-10s – 1\nU.S. national team appearances\nAmateur\n*Curtis Cup: 1994 (tie)\n*Espirito Santo Trophy: 1994 (winners)\nProfessional\n*Solheim Cup: 2002 (winners), 2003, 2005 (winners)\nSolheim Cup record\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size: 95%;\"\n!
