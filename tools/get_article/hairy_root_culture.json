The abnormal roots are particularly easy to culture in artificial media because hormones are not needed in contrast to adventitious roots, and they are neoplastic, with indefinite growth. The neoplastic roots produced by A. rhizogenes infection have a high growth rate (compared to untransformed adventitious roots), as well as genetic and biochemical stability.\nCurrently the main constraint for commercial utilization of hairy root culture is the development and up-scaling of appropriate (bioreactors) vessels for the delicate and sensitive hairy roots.\nSome of the applied research on utilization of hairy root cultures has been and is conducted at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. Other labs working on hairy roots are the phytotechnology lab of Amiens University and the Arkansas Biosciences Institute.\nMetabolic studies\nHairy root cultures can be used for phytoremediation, and are particularly valuable for studies of the metabolic processes involved in phytoremediation.\nFurther applications include detailed studies of fundamental molecular, genetic and biochemical aspects of genetic transformation and of hairy root induction.\nGenetically transformed cultures\nThe Ri plasmids can be engineered to also contain T-DNA, used for genetic transformation of the plant cells. The resulting genetically transformed root cultures can produce high levels of secondary metabolites, comparable or even higher than those of intact plants.\nUse in plant propagation\nHairy root culture can also be used for regeneration of whole plants and for production of artificial seeds.\nSee also\n* Crown gall, a plant disease with similar uses caused by a related bacterium, Agrobacterium tumefaciens\nReferences"
