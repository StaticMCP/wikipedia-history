Max additionally performed the song on  Entertainment Weekly series \"In the Basement\" in August 2019. The song was written by Max, Jon Bellion, Jonathan Simpson, Mark Williams, Raul Cubina, Seth Reger, and the producer Cirkut. In a statement, Max described the lyrics as \"realizing that you're in love with someone to a degree that feels almost beyond your control\". \"Freaking Me Out\" charted on the New Zealand Hot Singles chart at number 29.\nComposition\n\"Freaking Me Out\" is described by Brittany Spanos of Rolling Stone as an initial ballad tease with a guitar introduction, which escalates into a \"midtempo pop song\" during the chorus as Max sings the pop hook, \"I'm falling for you / So much so / That it's freaking me out\". According to the song's sheet music that was published on Musicnotes.com, it is set in the time signature of  common time, with a tempo of 98 beats per minute, while composed in the key of E major. Max's voice on the track ranges from the low note of E3 to the high note of E5, while the song is constructed in verse–chorus form. The song's lyrics utilize horror fiction tropes to represent the anxiety of falling, as Max sings the hook over a \"vibrant\" pop production. She uses \"growly vocals\" as the lyrics describe the feeling of losing senses during a new relationship.\nMusic video\nA music video was released as a Halloween special on October 31, 2019. It was directed by Edgar Daniel, and is a literal retelling of the song's lyrics with gothic and glamorous visuals. The video begins as Max observes the ocean waves. While inside a mansion, she is chained by a man within the basement, which serves as a metaphor to describe Max's unfamiliar and terrifying feelings in a relationship. Madeline Roth of MTV News noted that while the music video contained scary scenes such as a dungeon, rocking chair, and a drummer boy, it also included several romantic moments which acknowledged that it is a love song.\n| title1 = Freaking Me Out\n| length1 = 3:13\n}}\n| title1 = Freaking Me Out\n| note1 = Curt Reynolds Remix\n| length1 = 3:00\n| title2 = Freaking Me Out\n| note2 = Bingo Players Remix\n| length2 = 2:45\n| title3 = Freaking Me Out\n| note3 = Keanu Silva Remix\n| length3 = 2:57\n| title4 = Freaking Me Out\n| length4 = 3:13\n}}\nCredits and personnel\nCredits adapted from Apple Music metadata.\n* Amanda Ava Kocivocals, songwriting\n* Henry Walterproduction, songwriting\n* Jon Bellion songwriting\n* Jonathan Simpsonsongwriting\n* Mark Williamssongwriting\n* Raul Cubinasongwriting\n* Seth Regersongwriting\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Chart performance for \"Freaking Me Out\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ)\n| 29\n|}\nReferences"
