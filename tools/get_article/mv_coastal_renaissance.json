Coastal Renaissance was the first laid down, on January 2, 2007, with the yard number 733. The ferry was launched on April 19, 2007, and was completed on October 27, 2007. The name Coastal Renaissance was chosen by BC Ferries to represent the company's renewal. At the time of her construction, Coastal Renaissance was the largest double-ended ferry in the world. The ship left FSG for her delivery voyage to British Columbia on October 27, 2007.  She transited the Panama Canal on November 21.\nThe ship arrived at Nanaimo on December 13, 2007, and entered service on March 9, 2008. The vessel sails the Departure BayHorseshoe Bay and TsawassenSwartz Bay routes. Coastal Renaissance carried the Olympic flame for Vancouver 2010.\nIn 2011, Coastal Renaissance replaced sister ship  on the TsawwassenDeparture Bay route, after Coastal Inspiration rammed the ferry terminal at Duke Point. On October 25, 2017, Coastal Renaissance took part in a training exercise with members of the U.S. Coast Guard, Canadian Coast Guard and Canadian Forces, along with local agencies in Trincomali Channel.\nIn August 2023, Coastal Renaissance suffered an issue with her drive motor, and the vessel was removed from service for extensive repairs. The vessel's return to service has been delayed at least twice; as of January 29, 2024, she was expected to return to service by early March. Repairs were expected to cost approximately $3 million. She returned to service on March 4, 2024, after being out of service for just under seven months.\nNotes\n.\n}}\n}}\nCitations\nReferences\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n*\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n*\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.bcferries.com/about/newbuild/superc.html BC Ferries Newbuild Program]"
