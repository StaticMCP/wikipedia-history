He was born at Rangamati, British India (in what is now Bangladesh) and was the only child of merchant Edward and Marianne Collinson, daughter of Michael Collinson. He accompanied his mother to England when she went there following his father's death. They settled with Marianne's brother Charles Streynsham Collinson on his estate at the Chantry, Ipswich.\nEnlisted in the army in 1808, he served in the Peninsular War as lieutenant in the 48th Regiment.\nHe arrived in New South Wales on the 3rd of August 1817 on the Matilda. Close was transferred to Newcastle where he was acting engineer from 1821 to 1822.\nOn 27 September 1821 at St John's Church, Parramatta he married Sophia Susannah Palmer, daughter of John Palmer. In 1822 he resigned from the army to settle in a 2,560 acre property in Morpeth.\nIn 1829 he was appointed to the Legislative Council, however he found membership of the council to be a burden, both in expense and time and he resigned with effect from 1838.\nClose's son, Edward Charles Close junior, was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly.\nReferences"
