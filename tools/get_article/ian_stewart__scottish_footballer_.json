He was player/manager of Brechin City in the late 1970s, but left that position in January 1980 to become manager of Arbroath. Stewart was sacked by Arbroath in November 1983, despite losing only 39 out of 132 league matches in charge. Arbroath had narrowly missed out on promotion in each of the previous two seasons.\nSoon after leaving Arbroath, he was appointed manager of Montrose. He guided Montrose to promotion in 1984–85. He made a surprising appearances as a player for Montrose in September 1984, aged 38, when two players were unable to travel to an away match against Berwick Rangers. Montrose produced a surprise victory against Hearts at Tynecastle in a 1986–87 Scottish League Cup tie. It was the first time any visiting team had won at Tynecastle in fifteen months.\nReferences"
