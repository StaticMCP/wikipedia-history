That also qualified him to be a member of the 4 × 100 m relay team. At the Olympic Games, Warner finished 13th overall running a personal best of 10.09s twice in both the heat and the semi-final. Next up was the 4 × 100 m relay with Gavin Smellie, Oluseyi Smith, Jared Connaughton & Warner anchoring.
