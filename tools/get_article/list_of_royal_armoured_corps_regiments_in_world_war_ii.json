As the war progressed and further horsed regiments were mechanised, they joined the corps, together with new (armoured) cavalry regiments that were raised for the hostilities. The RAC created its own training and support regiments, and in 1941 and 1942 a number of infantry battalions were converted to armoured regiments and joined the RAC. Lastly, the RAC subsumed the Reconnaissance Corps in 1944.\nIn the list below, the date refers to the date when the regiment joined the RAC.\nCavalry\nRegular\n1939\n*1st King's Dragoon Guards\n*2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen's Bays)\n*3rd Carabiniers (Prince of Wales's Dragoon Guards)\n*4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards\n*5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards\n*3rd The King's Own Hussars\n*4th Queen's Own Hussars\n*7th Queen's Own Hussars\n*8th King's Royal Irish Hussars\n*9th Queen's Royal Lancers\n*10th Royal Hussars (Prince of Wales's Own)\n*11th Hussars (Prince Albert's Own)\n*12th Royal Lancers (Prince of Wales's)\n*13th/18th Royal Hussars\n*14th/20th King's Hussars\n*15th/19th The King's Royal Hussars\n*16th/5th Lancers\n*17th/21st Lancers\n*3rd Cavalry Training Regiment – Edinburgh, closed 1940\n*4th Cavalry Training Regiment – Colchester, closed 1940\n*6th Cavalry Training Regiment – Maidstone, closed 1940\n1940\n*1st The Royal Dragoons\n1941\n*Royal Scots Greys\nHostilities-only\n1940\n*22nd Dragoons\n*23rd Hussars\n*24th Lancers\n1941\n*25th Dragoons\n*26th Hussars\n*27th Lancers\nSpecial Reserve\n1939\n*North Irish Horse\nYeomanry\n1939\n*1st Derbyshire Yeomanry\n*2nd Derbyshire Yeomanry\n*1st Royal Gloucestershire Hussars\n*2nd Royal Gloucestershire Hussars\n*1st Lothians and Border Yeomanry\n*2nd Lothians and Border Horse\n*1st Fife and Forfar Yeomanry\n*2nd Fife and Forfar Yeomanry\n*3rd County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters)\n*4th County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters)\n*1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry\n*2nd Northamptonshire Yeomanry\n*1st East Riding Yeomanry\n*2nd East Riding Yeomanry\n1940\n*Inns of Court Regiment\n*Westminster Dragoons (2nd County of London Yeomanry)\n1941\n*Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry\n*Warwickshire Yeomanry\n*Yorkshire Hussars\n*Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry\n*Staffordshire Yeomanry\n*Cheshire Yeomanry\n*North Somerset Yeomanry\n1944\n*Queen's Own Yorkshire Dragoons\nRoyal Tank Regiment\nRoyal Tank Regiment nomenclature during the Second World War: the regiments were referred to as battalions and used Bn in the title.
