Utah leads the series .\nThe rivalry began in 1892 when Utah State (then the Agricultural College of Utah) defeated Utah 12-0 in the first game for both programs on November 25. For much of its history, whenever the two teams played in Salt Lake City, it was held on Thanksgiving Day. However, this aspect of the rivalry ended in 1958. Since 1959, no meeting has been played on Thanksgiving Day; and more recently, the meeting has been held in September as one of the first games of the season for both teams. Utah and Utah State have not competed in the same conference since 1961, meaning each meeting since then has been a voluntary non-conference game.\nIn the 1970s, Utah and its fans turned their sights towards Brigham Young University as their biggest rival, and the Holy War became the main rivalry in the state of Utah.\nFollowing the Utes' 2015 win, no further meetings had been scheduled until December 14, 2023, when a 2-for-1 home and home series was announced by the two schools, with a game in 2024 taking place in Logan and further meetings in 2026 and 2031 taking place in Salt Lake City. In the entire history of the rivalry, the game has never been contested anywhere beside Logan or Salt Lake City.\nGame results\nUntil 1957, the Aggies were known as the Utah State Agricultural College, or Utah A.C.\n| team2 = Utah State / U.A.C.\n| team2style =\n| November 25, 1892 | Logan | U.A.C. | 12 | Utah | 0\n| November 17, 1900 | Logan | Utah | 21 | U.A.C. | 0\n| November 9, 1901 |
