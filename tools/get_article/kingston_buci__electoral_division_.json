It was abolished as a result of boundary changes for the 2017 election.\nExtent and History\nThe division covers the neighbourhood of Kingston-by-Sea, which forms part of the town of Shoreham-by-Sea. The seat has been won by the Conservative Party at each election held since the seat was created in 2004. In April 2013 Paul Graysmark defected from the Conservative Party to UKIP, making the defence in 2013 a defence for UKIP.\nIt falls entirely within the un-parished area of Shoreham-by-Sea and comprises the following district wards: the north part of St. Mary's Ward, Southlands Ward and the north part of Southwick Green Ward.\nElection results\n2013 Election\nResults of the election held on 2 May 2013:\n2009 Election\nThe results of the election held on 4 June 2009:\n2005 Election\nResults of the election held on 5 May 2005:\nReferences\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20090421131747/http://www.westsussex.gov.uk/ccm/navigation/your-council/elections/ Election Results] - West Sussex County Council\nExternal links\n* [http://www.westsussex.gov.uk West Sussex County Council]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080307072911/http://www.election-maps.co.uk/ Election Maps]"
