This led to frustration among the general public and misunderstandings within the Ghanaian army.\nCause\nThe revolution began when the military government of the Supreme Military Council (SMC II), consisting of Lieutenant General Fred Akuffo, put Flight Lieutenant Jerry John Rawlings on public trial for attempting to overthrow the government on 15 May 1979. This failed coup had happened because Rawlings, a junior soldier in the Ghanaian Army, and other Ghanaian soldiers were not given their salaries.\nRawlings turned the trial against the government by accusing it of massive corruption and requesting his fellow accused to be set free as he was solely responsible for the mutiny. He was publicly sentenced to death and imprisoned.\nOn the night of 3 June 1979, junior military officers, including Major Boakye Djan, broke into the jail where Rawlings was held and helped free him. They then marched him to the national radio station to make an announcement. The first time the public heard from Rawlings was a statement that he had been released by the junior officers and that he was under their command. He requested all soldiers to meet with him at the Nicholson Stadium in Burma Camp, in Accra.\nThe soldiers rounded up senior military officers, including three former heads of state, General Fred Akuffo, Ignatius Kutu Acheampong and Akwasi Afrifa for trial. They were executed by a firing squad.\nAftermath\nRawlings was then appointed the head of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) by the revolting junior military officers to run the country until the ongoing election was completed. Rawlings handed over his power to Hilla Limann in September 1979, but overthrew Limann's government on 31 December 1981.\nSee also\n* History of Ghana (1966–79)\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Amamoo, Joseph G., \"The Ghanaian Revolution\", p.&nbsp;190, iUniverse (2000),\n* Ninsin, Kwame A., \"Issues in Ghana's Electoral Politics\", p.&nbsp;40, CODESRIA (2017),\n* Gocking, Roger, \"The History of Ghana\", Greenwood Publishing Group (2005), p.&nbsp;212,\n* The New York Times: \"Hard.
