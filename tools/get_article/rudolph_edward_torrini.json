Torrini trained and taught Bob Cassilly, founder of the City Museum in St. Louis, and also helped establish the Master of Fine Arts program at Fontbonne College.\nLife and career\nEarly life\nRudolph Torrini was born in St. Louis the son of Stella DiPalma, a pianist in silent movie houses, and Cherinto Torrini, a plaster mold-maker from Garfagnana, Tuscany. After the death of his father, he became a jazz saxophone performer in his teenage years to support his family, then enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1942, serving as a clarinetist on the ship's band of the transport ship U.S.S. West Point.\nTorrini had begun drawing during the war, and afterwards earned a BFA at the St. Louis School of Fine Arts (now Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts) at Washington University in St. Louis, then was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to study for a year at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze in Florence, Italy in 1949. Afterwards, he earned his MFA at the University of Notre Dame, where he studied under Ivan Meštrović. He went on to teach first at Webster College (now Webster University) for 17 years, then chaired the Art Department at Fontbonne College for 35 years.\nSt. Louis artists community\nTorrini was part of the community of 20th Century St. Louis artists that included Edward Boccia, Fred Green Carpenter, Fred Conway, Herb Cummings, Werner Drewes, Gustav Goetsch, Bill Fett, Phil Sultz, Jan Sultz, and Bob Cassilly. He did most of his initial work with clay at his studio in his home in the St. Louis suburb of Webster Groves.  Torrini is married to Ann Walsh Torrini, a painter and maker of stained glass window illustrations, and has four children.\nMusical career\nRudolph Torrini first worked as a jazz saxophone player and clarinetists during the 1930s and 40s, including performing as part of the Navy Band present at Franklin Delano Roosevelt's funeral.  Later, in the 1970s, he formed a Dixieland band with five other musicians called Tiger Rag Jazz Forever, which performed in the St. Louis area and recorded 3 LPs, including Tigers on Parade. All of their recordings feature clarinet and saxophone solos by Torrini. In addition, he was a lover of classical music, and always listened to it while working on his sculptures in his studio.\nDeath\nTorrini died on September 5, 2018, at the age of 95, following complications from Alzheimer's disease.\nMajor works\nRudolph Torrini is best known for his bronze cast public monuments, but he has also made many smaller statues, bas-reliefs, wood carvings, and drawings.
