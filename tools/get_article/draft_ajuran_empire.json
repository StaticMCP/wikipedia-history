      "text": "# Draft:Ajuran Empire\n\nSomalia in the Early Modern Period refers to the era in Somalia's history spanning from the late 17th century or early 18th century until the late 19th century and early 20th century.The period is marked by the fall of the Ajuran Empire, a major medieval and early modern power that controlled the fertile river valleys of the Jubba and Shabelle and held sway over much of southern and central Somalia from the 13th century until the late 17th and early 18th centuries, extending its influence into parts of present-day Ethiopia. Its collapse, caused by internal civil war, led to the rise of new powers: in the south, the Sultanate of Geledi and the Imamate of Hobyo; in the north, the Majeerteen Kingdom, the Isaaq Sultanates (including Habr Yunis), and the Warsangali Sultanate. Political fragmentation, lack of unity, and internal competition ultimately made the region vulnerable to European colonial powers. Britain and Italy exploited these divisions, signing secret treaties and gradually establishing protectorates that later evolved into full colonial rule. This process culminated in the mid-19th and early 20th centuries with the formal partitioning of Somali territories among the French, British, and Italian administrations.\nReferences"
