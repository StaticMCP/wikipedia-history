The University of Delaware is home to the Blue (Fred Rust Arena) and Gold arenas which serve as the home of the University of Delaware Figure Skating Club and the Delaware Ice Skating Science Development Center (ISSDC).  The University of Delaware Ice Skating Science Development Center (ISSDC) is a year-round training facility designed to meet the needs of figure skaters, first-time competitors and Olympians.
