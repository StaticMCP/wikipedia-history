But the achievement of consensus is far away: only a few hundred war veterans, as well as mutilated and desperate people, joined the first Fasci; Furthermore, someone steals the show: the poet, war hero and ace of the skies Gabriele D'Annunzio militarily takes Fiume. So Mussolini throws himself into the elections: the socialists, his former comrades now enemies, win, he doesn't get any votes and is arrested.\n| LineColor = 88221b\n}}\n| OriginalAirDate =\n| ShortSummary = Released after defeat, Mussolini contemplates leaving politics; to \"let off steam\" about his defeat, he rapes his underage secretary, Bianca Ceccato, who becomes pregnant. But then an unexpected opportunity changes Mussolini's mind and makes him return to politics: the strikes called by the socialists, which paralyze the country, induce landowners and industrialists to seek the help of the Fasci to restore order by force. Fascism, born to lift up the least fortunate, rejects workers and peasants and embraces the cause of the masters and the bourgeoisie. Thanks to his new allies he enters Parliament.\n| LineColor = 88221b\n}}\n| OriginalAirDate =\n| ShortSummary = In a country marked by warring classes, Mussolini's strategy is to foment disorder and violence, destabilize the institutions and then offer himself as the only one capable of restoring order and keeping his blackshirts in check. But when it comes to actually stopping the violence, the fascists turn against him.\n| LineColor = 88221b\n}}\n| OriginalAirDate =\n| ShortSummary = The violence of the blackshirts terrorizes the institutions. Mussolini understands that instead of stopping it, it is time to exploit it to the full, and decides to organize the March on Rome, aware of the fact that he would have no chance of success. Surprisingly, Mussolini manages to achieve even more: he becomes head of government.\n| LineColor = 88221b\n}}\n| OriginalAirDate =\n| ShortSummary = Mussolini is in power but that power is not enough. He wants new elections with a new electoral law that will ensure him an overwhelming majority in parliament. Don Sturzo, secretary of the Italian People's Party, tries to block his path but Mussolini obtains his expulsion in exchange for concessions to the Church. The law passes, Mussolini only needs a quarter of the votes to have absolute power. Meanwhile, without Mussolini's knowledge, some blackshirts have Don Minzoni killed.\n| LineColor = 88221b\n}}\n| OriginalAirDate =\n| ShortSummary = To ensure his electoral victory, Mussolini opened the lists of the fascist party to politicians of any formation. In order to be re-elected, many abandon their parties to jump on the bandwagon of the sure winner. But Forni, a charismatic and authoritative fascist leader, rebels in the name of the purity of the movement: Mussolini, fearing losing his people's vote, has him beaten and neutralized.\n| LineColor = 88221b\n}}\n| OriginalAirDate =\n| ShortSummary = After an electoral victory that led Mussolini and his fascist allies to almost completely dominate Parliament, the situation becomes dramatic.

Mieli asked Wright if he wanted to direct a series about Mussolini and Wright \"immediately said yes\". Mieli stated that Wright was chosen because he could bring an outsider's perspective to the story of Mussolini. Speaking about the series, Wright stated:\n}}\nWright's vision for the series was at a \"crossroads between Dziga Vertov's Man with a Movie Camera, Scarface and the rave culture  of the 1990s\". Sky Studios ordered the series in April 2022.\nCasting\nAt the Rome Film Festival in October 2022, it was announced that Luca Marinelli would play Benito Mussolini. Marinelli was Mieli's first choice for the role of Mussolini. Marinelli shaved his head and gained  for the role. He also had to spend two hours in hair and makeup daily during filming. Wright called Marinelli the \"most naturally gifted actor I've ever met\" along with Gary Oldman, who starred in Wright's 2017 biopic, Darkest Hour.\nFilming\nThe series was filmed over a period of six months beginning in November 2022. Filming took place primarily in Rome at Cinecittà Studios. Other filming locations included the Palazzo Reale and the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples, as well as Trieste, Aquileia, Gorizia, and Ruda in Friuli-Venezia Giulia.\nMusic\nNot wanting the series to feel like a \"stuffy period drama biopic\", Wright brought on Tom Rowlands of The Chemical Brothers to compose its score. Wright stated that Rowlands's soundtrack helped the series maintain its pace, rhythm, and energy.\nRelease\nThe series was previewed at the Riviera International Film Festival in May 2023. A teaser trailer for the series was released on 2 August 2024. The series was screened at the 81st Venice International Film Festival on 5 September 2024 and began airing on Sky Atlantic on 10 January 2025.\nIn May 2025, Mubi acquired the distribution rights to the series in North America, Latin America, Belgium, Luxembourg, Turkey, India, and New Zealand.\nReception\nStephanie Bunbury of Deadline wrote that the series \"brilliantly depicts how banal evil gets its way\". She further wrote, \"M. Son of the Century sticks to the facts of the great dictator's life, which are extraordinary enough, but stretches those facts into surreal shapes until we feel we're in some parallel historical universe. Wright's brassy style — unlike anything he has done before — owes something to [Federico] Fellini, but a whole lot more to its subject. Because Benito Mussolini, apart from anything else, definitely knew how to put on a show.\"\nValerio Sammarco of Cinematografo.it gave the series five out of five stars and wrote, \"Whirling and pyrotechnic, Joe Wright's Sky series arrives Out of Competition at Venice81: a monstrous performance by Luca Marinelli, who breaks the fourth wall to tell us about the rise of the Duce.\" Mauro Donzelli of Comingsoon.it also gave the series five out of five stars, calling it \"a marvel\" and \"an extraordinary parable between the intoxication of violence and the ghosts of power\".\nPaola Casella of Mymovies.it gave the series four out of five stars and called it \"an intelligent series with a fearless script and an inspired cast\" and \"a work that takes the bull by the horns, tackling a slice of Italian history with great narrative breadth and immense production effort\".\nAntonio Cuomo of Movieplayer.it gave the series four out of five stars and wrote, \"M. Son of the Century is an impressive and important work, for the production values it uses and for the narrative and visual construction by Joe Wright to do justice on screen to the novel by Antonio Scurati, from which it takes inspiration. Luca Marinelli's work on the character is good, at the center of a cast that manages to offer a complete and multifaceted cross-section of the moment and the figures that brought it to life. A series that evolves in its eight episodes to leave us with important food for thought and a subtle sense of uneasiness that we struggle to shake off. As great stories can do.\"\nChiara Guida of Cinefilos.it gave the series three-and-a-half out of five stars and wrote, \"M. Son of the Century is a candidate to be the most important Italian television event of this season and perhaps also for the seasons to come, a product that unfortunately also speaks of contemporaneity and that could be welcomed even outside national borders.\"\nMarianna Ciarlante of Today rated the series 8.8 out of 10 and wrote, \"Every aspect of this series is a winner, from the direction to the screenplay, from the cast to the lighting, right down to the perfect soundtrack by The Chemical Brothers. Futuristic, original, provocative and provocative, M. Son of the Century is a series not to be missed.\"\nElisa Giudici of Gamesurf rated the series 8.5 out of 10 and wrote, \"M. Son of the Century is a great serial adaptation that immediately understands that the only way to do justice to its literary source and to history is to betray it from the beginning, conversing with the current audience, making contemporary anxieties resonate in its narration, creating a charismatic, sometimes overbearing identity. It will be one of the cult series of 2025.\"\nClaudia Catalli of Wired Italia called the series \"great, great cinema.\" She further wrote, \"Starting with Wright's direction, free, impeccable and obsessively attentive to details as to convey the atmosphere, masterfully alternating fiction with repertoire, behind a meticulous work [that is] both historical and visionary. The pace is incandescent, and the notable writing work, starting from the significant Strega Prize-winning novel by Antonio Scurati and arriving at the excellent screenplay by Stefano Bises and Davide Serino, offers memorable passages, without ever falling into rhetoric and without forgetting irony (fundamental, in a story already historically tragic, dark and violent in itself).\"\nPaolo Nizza of Sky TG24 called the series \"a very powerful fiction that with an imaginative and cinematic style\". He also commended the cast's performances, stating that \"Luca Marinelli should be given every award available on the globe\" and that \"the entire cast seems inclined to excellence\". Antonella Catena of Style Magazine called the series \"pure cinema\" and Gabriele Lingiardi of Badtaste called the series a \"majestic work of production\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
