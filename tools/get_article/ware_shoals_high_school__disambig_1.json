Today, the Main Building serves grades 9-12 and houses administrative offices, classrooms, the auditorium, and the cafeteria.\nRiegel Stadium, an athletic multiplex completed in 1931, contains football field, baseball field, and Field House. The stadium was one of several South Carolina filming locations for the 2008 movie, Leatherheads. The gymnasium was completed in the 1940s. The Agricultural facilities are currently contained in its basement and side yard.\nThe Darby Building, which was opened in 1951 to house junior high students, now serves the Greenwood 51 District Office. The band building, finished in 1955, was the last school facility built by the mill. In 1999, the Ware Shoals Community Library was completed. The library serves as the school and community library. This facility was made possible through a combination of private and public funds and was one of the first of its kind in the nation.\nDemographics\nIn 2021, 19% of students were identified as being from a minority ethnic background. 49% of Ware Shoals High School students have been assessed as \"economically disadvantaged\" based on application for and receipt of free or reduced lunch.\nReferences"
