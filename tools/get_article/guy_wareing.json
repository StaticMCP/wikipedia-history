He gained his first victory on 12 August, destroying a Pfalz D.III fighter over Ploegsteert, Belgium. After destroying two reconnaissance aircraft and driving another down out of control, Wareing became both an ace and a balloon buster by destroying an observation balloon over Gheluvelt on 7 September 1918. He then sent a Fokker D.VII down in flames, and destroyed three more balloons, two of them on two separate sorties on 29 September. He was appointed a temporary captain on 7 October 1918.\nOn 27 October 1918 Wareing was killed when he was shot down by a Fokker D.VII flown by Leutnant Josef Raesch of Jasta 43. He is buried in the churchyard of Église Sainte-Marie-Madeleine, Rumillies, Tournai, Hainaut, Belgium, where his is the only Commonwealth War Grave.\nWareing's award of the Distinguished Flying Cross was gazetted posthumously on 3 December 1918. His citation read:\n:Lieutenant Guy Wilbraham Wareing.\n::\"A bold and courageous airman who has destroyed four enemy aeroplanes and shot down in flames a hostile balloon. He is conspicuous for zeal and devotion to duty.\"\nList of aerial victories\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n|+Combat record\n|-\n!No.\n! width=\"125\" |Date/Time\n! width=\"100\" |Aircraft/Serial No.\n! width=\"100\" |Opponent\n! width=\"100\" |Result\n!Location\n|-\n|1 || 12 August 1918@ 0920 || S.E.5a(C1133) || Pfalz D.III || Destroyed || Ploegsteert\n|-\n|2 || 19 August 1918@ 1115 || S.E.5a(C1133) || DFW C || Destroyed || East of Bailleul\n|-\n|3 || 31 August 1918@ 1450 || S.E.5a(C1133) || LVG C || Out of control || East of Estaires\n|-\n|4 || 6 September 1918@ 1800 || S.E.5a(C1133) || DFW C || Destroyed || South-east of Pérenchies\n|-\n|5 || 7 September 1918@ 0655 || S.E.5a(C1133) || Balloon || Destroyed || Gheluvelt\n|-\n|6 || 15 September 1918@ 1845 || S.E.5a(C1133) || Fokker D.VII || Destroyed in flames || Roulers-Rumbeke\n|-\n|7 || 27 September 1918@ 0845 || S.E.5a(C1133) || Balloon || Destroyed || Moorslede\n|-\n|8 || 29 September 1918@ 1000 || S.E.5a(D6940) || Balloon || Destroyed || South-east of Armentières\n|-\n|9 || 29 September 1918@ 1410 || S.E.5a(C1133) || Balloon || Destroyed || East of Comines\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
