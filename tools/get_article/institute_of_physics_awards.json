It also offers smaller specific subject-group prizes, such as for PhD thesis submissions.\nBilateral awards\n* The Max Born Medal and Prize is awarded yearly by the German Physical Society and the Institute of Physics in memory of the German physicist Max Born. The prize recognizes \"outstanding contributions to physics\" and is awarded to physicists based in Germany and in the UK or Ireland in alternate years.\n* The Fernand Holweck Medal and Prize is awarded jointly by the French and British Physical Societies for distinguished work in any aspect of physics that is ongoing or has been carried out within the 10 years preceding the award.\n* The Harrie Massey Medal and Prize is awarded biennially jointly by the Institute of Physics and by The Australian Institute of Physics.\n* The Giuseppe Occhialini Medal and Prize is awarded to physicists in alternating years who work in Italy (even dated years) or the UK or Ireland (odd dated years).\nBusiness awards\n* The Katharine Burr Blodgett Medal and Prize is a gold medal awarded annually for outstanding contributions to the organisation or applications of physics to a physicist in an industrial or commercial context in any sector.\n* The Dennis Gabor Medal and Prize is a prize awarded for distinguished contributions to the application of physics in an industrial, commercial or business context.\n* The Clifford Paterson Medal and Prize is awarded for exceptional early career contributions to the application of physics.\n* The Lee Lucas Award\n* The Business Innovation Award\n* The Business Start-Up Award\n* The Apprentice Award\n* The Apprenticeship Employer Award\nEducation awards\nThe Lawrence Bragg Medal and Prize\nFirst awarded in 1967, is a gold medal for outstanding and sustained contributions to physics education.
