The Frontenacs existed from 1959 until 1963, winning the final EPHL championship in 1962-63. The Frontenacs played in all four EPHL seasons, and was among the most stable of the league's franchises. When the EPHL folded in 1963, the franchise was transferred to the new Central Hockey League as the Minneapolis Bruins.\nOrval Tessier won two scoring titles with the Frontenacs, and voted the league's most valuable player and most sportsmanlike player in the 1961-62 season.\nNHL alumni\nList of Kingston Frontenacs alumni to play in the National Hockey League.\nReferences"
