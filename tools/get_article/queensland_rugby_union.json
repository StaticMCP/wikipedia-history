It is a member and founding union of Rugby Australia.\nHistory\nThe QRU was founded in Brisbane in 1883 as the Northern Rugby Union, after breaking away from the Queensland Football Association before being formally constituted in 1893 when the name was changed to the Queensland Rugby Football Union.\nThe first 1883 season began with two clubs: Fireflies and Wanderers. Early intercolonials were played at Eagle Farm Racecourse. The competition boomed after the collapse of the QFA in 1890 with the majority of the remaining Australian rules players making the switch to rugby.\nA combination of the introduction of rugby league and the impact of World War I saw the organisation disbanded in 1919, however it reformed after a decade in 1928.\nEarly clubs (1883-1893)\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:100%\"\n|-\n!
