It was the second program from Watson, the first being the Red Ryder terminal emulator. When first released it was known as Red Ryder Host, later becoming White Knight, and finally Second Sight. Second Sight was a traditional text-based BBS system, unlike products like TeleFinder and FirstClass which supported a graphical interface.\nNext, Watson came up with a program for anyone to create a BBS. It was called Red Ryder Host, but later renamed Second Sight. Scott introduced the new program in the same way as Red Ryder, by posting it on bulletin boards. By then, Watson operated his own bulletin board.\nSee also\n*Red Ryder\nReferences"
