Released by Rhino Records in 2002, the box set was based on the success of Have a Nice Decade: The 70s Pop Culture Box, Rhino's box set covering the 1970s. Original release sets had a 3D rubber cover. Later releases had a flat, printed cover.\nLike Omigod! includes a 90-page booklet of cultural comment, a timeline for the decade, and liner notes for the tracks included in the set. As does Have a Nice Decade, the tracks tend to be from the lesser-known artists who were one-hit wonders, although music from the best-selling artists of the era are also included. In addition, many of the 1980s musical styles—rock, pop, country pop, new wave, funk, disco and rhythm and blues—are represented.\nA majority of the tracks on the first 5½ discs focus on 1980–1985, while the remaining tracks cover the period of 1986–1989.\nMastering\nThis compilation was produced by David McLees, Bill Inglot and Gordon Skene, and like many CDs of the period, contains very loud and dynamically compressed mastering, so much to the point that many of the tracks pump from the extremely loud \"brickwalling\" effect that all the tracks have been processed through.\nTrack listing\nDisc 1 (21 tracks)\n# \"Whip It\" — Devo 2:39\n# \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" (Single Version) — The Buggles 3:27\n# \"Empire Strikes Back (Medley)\" — Meco 3:03\n# \"Another One Bites the Dust\" — Queen 3:34\n# \"Celebration\" — Kool & the Gang 3:43\n# \"The Breaks (Pt. 1)\" — Kurtis Blow 4:09\n# \"Let My Love Open the Door\" — Pete Townshend 2:44\n# \"Call Me\" (Single Version) — Blondie 3:32\n# \"Keep on Loving You\" — REO Speedwagon 3:22\n# \"Turning Japanese\" — The Vapors 3:44\n# \"Lost in Love\" — Air Supply 3:54\n# \"9 to 5\" — Dolly Parton 2:46\n# \"I Love a Rainy Night\" — Eddie Rabbitt 3:10\n# \"Sailing\" — Christopher Cross 4:16\n# \"Just the Two of Us\" — Grover Washington, Jr. and Bill Withers 3:58\n# \"Cars\" — Gary Numan 3:57\n# \"Ah!
