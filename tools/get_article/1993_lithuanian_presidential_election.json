They were the first presidential elections under the new October 1992 constitution and the first direct presidential elections in the country's history.\nActing president Algirdas Brazauskas, the former first secretary of the Communist Party of Lithuania and leader of the Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania (LDDP), won over 60% of the vote, enough to win without a runoff. The runner up was Stasys Lozoraitis Jr., an independent candidate endorsed by the Sąjūdis movement and other political parties. These presidential elections had fewest number of candidates up to date.\nBy-elections to several municipal councils were held on the same day.\nCampaign\nUnder Brazauskas' leadership, the LDDP had won 73 out of 141 seats in the Seimas in the 1992 parliamentary elections. Brazauskas was subsequently appointed as Speaker, and by virtue of that position, also became acting president. Based on the success of the LDDP in the parliamentary elections, Brazauskas was considered favorite for the presidential elections.\nThe Social Democratic Party of Lithuania proposed poet Justinas Marcinkevičius as a unity candidate against Brazauskas, but Marcinkevičius refused, stating that he was not a politician. Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the pro-independence Sąjūdis movement, withdrew his candidacy in support of Stasys Lozoraitis Jr., a Lithuanian diplomat, who had spent almost all of his life in Italy and the United States representing the interwar independent Lithuania. Because of the Iron Curtain, his work was virtually unknown in Lithuania. No other candidates came forward as other parties with the exception of the Polish minority declared their support for Lozoraitis as they had become alarmed by the dominance of Brazauskas and the LDDP.\nThe campaign was limited to three weeks. Lozoraitis stressed his experience in complex foreign affairs. Brazauskas, operating in a familiar environment, was better prepared to address domestic affairs and promised to focus on a smooth transition from planned economy to free market. During the campaign, opponents depicted Lozoraitis as a foreigner who did not understand the current situation of Lithuania and was largely dependent on the unpopular Sąjūdis. Valdas Adamkus, who went on to win the 1997–98 presidential elections, assisted Lozoraitis in his campaign.\nOpinion polls\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%; line-height:16px;\"\n!rowspan=\"3\"| Pollster\n!rowspan=\"3\"| Fieldwork date\n!rowspan=\"3\"| Sample size\n|-\n!

This allowed him to win the presidency in a single round; his 61 percent vote share exceeded the 50 percent threshold required to avoid a runoff.\nAftermath\nThe inauguration ceremony took place on 25 February. In May 1993, just a few months after the elections, Brazauskas recalled Lozoraitis as ambassador to the United States despite criticism of politicizing the issue.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.vrk.lt/1993-m.-respublikos-prezidento-rinkimai 1993 Lithuanian presidential elections] VRK"
