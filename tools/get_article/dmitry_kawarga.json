Kawarga began working in his own style of \"biomorphism\" striving to create a synthesis of science, art and technology. His art is featured in numerous museums and is part of the permanent collection of Erarta, Russia's largest private museum of contemporary art located in Saint Petersburg.\nStyle\nKawarga began his career as a painter and got his original art form among Moscow non-conformists. The flat surfaces gained more and more pronounced facture, and became ever more monumental; forms started to emerge in the manner of reliefs, and finally turned into sculptures.\nCurrently, he works with a wide range of polymers that serve as the material of large-scale landscape sculptures as miniature detailed compositions.\nA big cycle of his works called Science Art, because in addition to the monumental sculptures and elaborate reliefs, he also produces kinetic and interactive installations, complete with biofeedback devices and robots.\nHis work synthesizes science, art and technology, and he often involves engineers and programmers in the creative process.\nHis style has been variously described as \"biomorphism\" or \"biogenic art,\" while his insistence on the end of anthropocentrism has caused others to call him a practitioner of \"post-human\" art.\nMember of a large group project in the format of the artist's book A City as an Artist's Subjectivity (2019–2020).\nPermanent collections\n* Hermitage Museum.
