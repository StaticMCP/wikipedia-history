The area covers the former Castle Brewery factory complex in the central part of the town. It was opened in 1885 as a brewery for the town and continued operating until 1982. It was then converted into a mixed-use site of retail units and residential accommodation. The brewery is a Grade II listed building, while an administrative block and a cask store have separate Grade II listings.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
