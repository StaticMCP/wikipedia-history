      "text": "# George Munger Award\n\nThe George Munger Award is presented to the NCAA Division I college football coach of the year by the Maxwell Football Club. The award was named after former University of Pennsylvania head coach George Munger. People who voted for the winners of the award included NCAA head coaches, members of the Maxwell Club, and sportswriters from all over the country.\nIn March 2010, the Maxwell Football Club announced that the award would be replaced by the Joseph V. Paterno Award. Following the breaking of the Penn State sex abuse scandal in November 2011, the club announced that the Paterno award would be discontinued. The Maxwell Club later returned Munger's name to the award.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
