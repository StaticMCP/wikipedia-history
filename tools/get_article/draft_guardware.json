Established in 2021, the company develops software focused on identifying, classifying, and protecting sensitive data to assist organisations in managing data loss risks and complying with regulatory requirements. The company aims to democratise data encryption solutions for enterprises, making advanced protection accessible and manageable across various industries.\nHistory\nGuardWare's core focus is on data protection within enterprise IT environments. In 2024, the company entered a collaborative agreement with the University of New South Wales (UNSW) under the Australian Government’s Defence Trailblazer program. The AUD 7 million project aims to develop technologies that enhance the resilience of Australia’s national defence supply chain.\nProducts and technology\nGuardWare offers software tools that scan IT environments to discover and classify sensitive information. The platform applies classification labels and enforces policies designed to prevent unauthorized access and data exfiltration. Its features support compliance with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), by enabling organisations to monitor and control sensitive data flows. The system also includes key revocation capabilities, allowing administrators to revoke access by invalidating encryption keys as required.\nPartnerships and funding\nThe collaboration with UNSW Sydney, initiated in 2023 as part of the Defence Trailblazer program, represents a key strategic partnership. This federally funded initiative supports the development of sovereign cybersecurity technologies to protect critical supply chain data and infrastructure within Australia. The partnership includes a AUD 7 million grant dedicated to this research and development effort.\nLeadership\n* Rizwan Mahmood – Founder and Chief Executive Officer\n* Alan Rankins OAM – Chairman\n* Simon Scott – Chief Architect\n* Akhil Subedi – Chief Technology Officer\n* Richard Matthewman – General Manager of Business Development\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.guardware.com.au Official website]"
