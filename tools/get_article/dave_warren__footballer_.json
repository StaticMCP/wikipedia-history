Warren's previous clubs include Wrexham FC and Cobh Ramblers.\nCareer\nWarren was born in Cork. He took his first football steps with local club Mayfield United as a central midfielder.\nIn 2000, he moved to Welsh side Wrexham but after two frustrating seasons during which he made just six League appearances for The Robins. The financial troubles that beset the Football League meant that Warren was released by Wrexham in 2002 and he returned to his hometown club Cork City along with the likes of George O'Callaghan and John O'Flynn.\nAt Turner's Cross, Warren struggled for form and moved on loan to Cobh . There he impressed under then-manager Dave Hill who made the move to St Colman's Park permanent. After a successful spell at Cobh, Warren moved to League of Ireland Premier Division side Waterford United in 2007.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
