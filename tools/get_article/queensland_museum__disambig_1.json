The temporary homes included The Old Windmill (1862–1869), Parliament House (1869–1873) and the General Post Office (1873–1879).  In 1875 alone, the museum saw over 25,500 visitors over its 310 days open to the zoological, mineralogical, ethnological, mechanical, literary, and artistic exhibitions.  At this time, exhibits totalled 6,027.\nThe government built a home for the museum in William Street, Brisbane City (later called the John Oxley State Library), with the Queensland Museum moving there in 1879.  The museum occupied the William Street location for 20 years.\nIn 1899, the Queensland Museum moved into the Exhibition Hall (now called the Old Museum), Gregory Terrace, Bowen Hills, Brisbane, remaining there for 86 years.\nIn 1986, the Queensland Museum moved to the Queensland Cultural Centre, South Bank, where the museum is adjacent to the Queensland Art Gallery. Both a tunnel and pedestrian bridge connect the Museum and Art Gallery buildings with the Queensland Performing Arts Centre. Three lifts were added to the bridge in 2004 to provide access to the platforms of the Cultural Centre busway station. A large sculpture of a cicada was located in front of the centre lift, but was removed in 2022 to make way for construction of the Brisbane Metro.\nIn 1987, the Queensland Museum Medal was created to recognise recipients for major contributions in research and other works.  Awardees include palaeontologist Professor Mike Archer, Professor Don Nicklin, palaeontologist Dr Mary Wade, Dr Alan Bartholomai, Steve Irwin, Dr Steve Van Dyck, Anne Jones, Sir David Attenborough, Dr John Hooper, and Professor Peter Andrews.\n; Curators and directors\n* 1872–1879 – Karl Theodor Staiger (died 1888) (first professional curator)\n* 1910–1918 – Ronald Hamlyn-Harris (1874–1953) (former science teacher at Toowoomba Grammar School)\n* 1918–1945 – Albert Heber Longman (1880–1954)\n* 1946–1963 – George Mack (1899–1963), ex-Sydney museum, then senior scientific assistant\n* 1964–1969 – Jack Tunstall Woods ISO,  former QM geologist\n* 1969 – c. 1989 – Dr Alan Bartholomai AM (1938–2015).\nSites\nThe museum operates from its headquarters and general museum in South Brisbane (\"Kurilpa\") with specialist museums elsewhere in the state.\nA separate collections and research centre is based at Hendra.\nSouth Brisbane (\"Kurilpa\")\nQueensland Museum Kurilpa at South Brisbane is part of the Queensland Cultural Centre complex, alongside the State Library of Queensland, the Queensland Art Gallery, the Gallery of Modern Art and the Queensland Performing Arts Centre.
