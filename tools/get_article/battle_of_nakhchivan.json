It was fought by the troops of the First Republic of Armenia, and troops of the Republic of Aras. The battle would be the decisive factor to the capitulation of the Republic of Aras, and its annexation by Armenia.\nArmenian Offensive\nThe Armenian Offensive towards the city of Nakhchivan began in early June, as they advanced from south-western Kangarli with their highly moralised and professionally trained force of 18.000 Armenian infantrymen under the command of Drastamat Kanayan.The Armenians swiftly marched through the south of the Nakhchivan region in order to reach the city, following the railway within the region and defeating numerous smaller units of the Aras army, usually numbering armies in the one thousands composing of ethnic Azerbaijanis.The Armenian army would reach the city of Nakhchivan by mid-June, attacking it in well organised hit and run attacks before beginning a direct march into the city with 18.000 Armenian infantrymenThe smaller Azerbaijani army stood little to no chance against the much larger and better trained Armenian one, and within only days of fighting the Azerbaijanis were forced to surrender, as the city would effectively be in Armenian hands following the battle.\nAftermath\nFollowing the Battle, Drastamat Kanayan met with Kalb Ali Khan Nakhichevanskii in the city, where they would negotiate the terms for the capitulation of the Republic of Aras. The negotiations would result in the direct annexation of all territories by the Republic of Aras, these territories were entirely the region of Nakhchivan, this would also mark the quelling of the Muslim uprisings in Armenia.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
