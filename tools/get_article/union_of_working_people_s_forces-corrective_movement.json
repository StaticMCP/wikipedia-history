Apart from Al-Arab, co-founders of the group included Fouad Itani and Samih Hamada.\nIn founding the new party, Al-Arab condemned the support of the Union of Working People's Forces leadership to the new Egyptian president Anwar Sadat. Al-Arab argued that the Egyptian government under Sadat had abandoned Nasserism. The party joined the Lebanese National Movement (LNM), whilst its mother party Union of Working People's Forces parted ways with the LNM as it sided with the Syrian government.\nMilitary structure and organization\nPalestine Liberation Organization (PLO)   Syria\n| opponents        =  Lebanese Front Lebanese Armed Forces Al-Mourabitoun Army of Free Lebanon  Israel Defense Forces (IDF)\n}}\nLike other Lebanese Nasserist parties, the UWPF-CM had its own militia, the '''Nasser's Forces' (Arabic: قوات ناصر | Quwwat an-Nasir) or Forces de Nasser in French, whose formation was announced on April 15, 1975. The party and its military wing were supported financially and militarly by the Libyan government.\nThe UWPF-CM in the Lebanese Civil War\nAlthough small in size, the Nasser's Forces took part in the street battles that engulfed Beirut, notably on the Battle of the Hotels, Chyah, on the Ras Nabi-Sodeco axis, at Khandak El Ghamik, as well as clashes at Mount Lebanon (Aley, Qmatiyeh and Bdadoun).\nHowever, relations with its LNM coalition partners were strained to the point of the Nasser's Forces battling rival Nasserite parties such as the Al-Mourabitoun in November 1975 over control of the Karantina district in East Beirut.\nThe party underwent a split in 1978. In an extraordinary congress there was a dispute between Al-Arab, who argued in favour of alliance with the governments of Iraq and Libya, and his opponents led by Hassan Qubaysi. On July 23, 1978 Al-Arab was declared expelled from the party and Qubaysi was named the new General Secretary of the party.\nThe Nasser's Forces continued confronting the Christian Lebanese Front right-wing militias between 1978 and 1982. After the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon and the departure of the PLO, the Nasser Forces went underground and supposedly converted itself into a clandestine resistance group.\nSee also\n*Arab Socialist Union (Lebanon)\n*Al-Mourabitoun\n*Battle of the Hotels\n*Lebanese Civil War\n*Lebanese National Movement\n*Lebanese National Resistance Front\n*List of weapons of the Lebanese Civil War\n*Syrian intervention in the Lebanese Civil War\n*Union of Working People's Forces\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Edgar O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon, 1975-92, Palgrave Macmillan, London 1998.\n* Itamar Rabinovich, The war for Lebanon, 1970-1985, Cornell University Press, Ithaca and London 1989 (revised edition). , 0-8014-9313-7 – [https://books.google.com/books?id=Af-tDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA83]\n* Marius Deeb, The Lebanese Civil War, Praeger Publishers Inc, New York 1980.\n*Paul Jureidini, R.
