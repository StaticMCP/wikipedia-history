Manuel Blanco Encalada and José Manuel Borgoño successfully convinced Freire to instead attempt to weaken the royalists and presented a plan to capture three small gunboats. Freire conceded and Guillermo Bell was chosen for the task. Bell was able to successfully capture the gunboats despite being next to the fort of San Carlos.\nConsequences\nAfter eliminating the problem of the gunboats, the Chilean patriots could attack the battery of Poquillihue, to the west of Fort San Carlos, which was now undefended for the sea. The patriots under the command of Ramón Freire and Blanco Encalada would attack the enemy from behind, using the same boats captured from the Royalists, managing to disrupt the defense in the fort and definitively defeat the royalists in the Battle of Bellavista, the next day on January 14.\nReferences"
