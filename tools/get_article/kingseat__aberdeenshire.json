The name \"Kingseat\" is visible on Maps dating back to 1652.\nKingseat Hospital\nDesigned by Marshall Mackenzie Kingseat Hospital was the first segregate or village hospital system in the British Isles opened in 1904.\nDuring World War II it was requisitioned by the Admiralty to be used as a Naval Auxiliary Hospital which it functioned as until 28 February 1946.\nThe hospital closed in 1994 but not before lending its name to the Kingseat Hospital in New Zealand.\nConservation & Residential Development\nThe site was designated a conservation area in 2000 and plans were made to preserve the buildings by converting the site in to residential buildings.\nGovernance\nKingseat is part of the Gordon and Buchan county constituency for UK Parliament elections.\nFor Scottish elections Kingseat is part of the Aberdeenshire East constituency and part of the North East Scotland electoral region.\nKingseat is within the East Garioch ward which forms part of the Garioch administrative area of Aberdeenshire Council.\nNewmachar Community Council represents the views of residents to Aberdeenshire Council and other public bodies. It has a statutory right to comment on all planning applications including all the major housing developments. The Council has nine elected members with elections held every three years.\nKingseat Community Association (an association brought around by the \"Kingseat Matters\" project which started in February 2013) held its first meeting on 18 June 2013 and the first committee meeting on 21 August 2013.. The group's aim is \"to make Kingseat, Aberdeenshire an even better place to live and work.\" The group published a Kingseat Action Plan in 2014 and did a lot of work trying to force the site's main developers to finish the site's construction, they also organised various sports and community days. The group was dissolved in June 2020.\nGeography\nLocated  NW of Aberdeen and  NNE of Edinburgh Kingseat is roughly  east of Newmachar connected by the B979 and a separate walking path.
