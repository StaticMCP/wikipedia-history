Also, it marks another on-screen reunion of Mark Lee, Henry Thia and Gadrick Chin after their previous collaboration in Number 1, in which Lee also portrayed a very similar role just like this film where both roles featured his characters looking for many jobs and work on them but ultimately were all failed attempts, which led them working as a drag queen in that film and durian seller with his family in this film respectively.\nThe film was released on 21 January 2023 in Malaysia and Singapore.
