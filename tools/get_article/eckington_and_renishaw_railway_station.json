The ex-Great Central station was renamed Renishaw Central by British Railways on 25 September 1950.\nThe street level booking office was built on a bridge over the line with covered stairways leading down to the two platforms.\nThe station closed completely in 1951. The line is now part of the current Midland Main Line. It is used predominantly for freight, with a handful of passenger trains going the \"long way round\" from  to  via the Old Road and  largely to retain staff route knowledge in case of diversions.\nPassenger services\nIn 1922 passenger services calling at Eckington and Renishaw were at their most intensive, with trains serving three destinations via three overlapping routes:\n* On Sundays only\n** stopping trains plied directly between  and Chesterfield (MR) via the Old Road.\n* On Mondays to Saturdays three stopping services plied between Sheffield (MR) and Chesterfield\n** most ran direct down the \"New Road\" through  and went nowhere near Eckington and Renishaw.\n* the other two services went the \"long way round\" via the \"Old Road\". They set off north eastwards from Sheffield (MR) towards Rotherham then swung east to go south along the Old Road\n** one of these continued past , a short distance before Masboro' then swung hard right, next stop Treeton, then all stations, including Eckington and Renishaw, to Chesterfield,\n** the other continued past  then swung right onto the Sheffield District Railway passing through or calling at West Tinsley and Catcliffe before Treeton, after which they called at all stations to Chesterfield.\nReferences\nNotes\nSources\n*\n*\n*\nLine open, station closed\n|next=Line open, station closed\n|route=Midland RailwayNorth Midland Railway \"Old Road\"\n|col=\n}}\nExternal links\n*[https://archive.today/20130624220026/http://www.old-maps.co.uk/maps.html?txtXCoord=444230&txtYCoord=378550 Eckington and Renishaw station: old maps via Old-Maps]"
