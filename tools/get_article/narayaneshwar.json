Two of these preachers were later buried there. The dargah built over the Narayaneshwar temple is now the 'Thorla (Senior) Sheikh Salla dargah' and is located on the bank of the Mutha river, not far from the Shaniwar Wada.\nThe temple remains one of the earliest named temples, after Pataleshwar in the city of Pune, although it does not exist in its original form now.\nReferences"
