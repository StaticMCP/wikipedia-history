The PEN America awards have been characterized as being among the \"major\" American literary prizes.\nAward winners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+PEN/Phyllis Naylor Working Writer Fellowship winners\n!Year\n!Author\n!Title\n!Ref.\n|-\n|2001\n|\n|Sparks, published by Wendy Lamb Books in 2002\n|\n|-\n|2002\n|\n|Broken China, published by Simon Pulse in 2006\n|\n|-\n|2003\n|\n|  (Available for Publication)\n|\n|-\n|2004\n|\n|[Untitled] (Available for Publication)\n|\n|-\n|2005\n|\n| Night Road, published by  Harper Teen in 2008\n|\n|-\n|2006\n|\n| Everything You Want, published by Flux Books in 2008\n|\n|-\n|2007\n|\n| Genesis, published as Season of Ice by Bloomsbury in  2008\n|\n|-\n|2008\n|\n| Julia Delany: The American Version, published as The Year We Sailed the Sun by Atheneum Books in 2015\n|\n|-\n|2009\n|\n|, published as Glimpse by Simon and Schuster in 2011\n|\n|-\n|2010\n|\n| Bluefish, published by Candlewick Press in 2011\n|\n|-\n|2011\n|\n| Two Girls Staring at the Ceiling, published by Schwartz & Wade Books in 2014\n|\n|-\n|2012\n|\n| Free Verse, published by G.P.
