      "text": "# National Culture Policy\n\nThe National Culture Policy introduced in 1970 in Malaysia, emphasized an assimilation of the non-Malays into the Malay ethnic group. However, during the 1990s Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad rejected this approach, with his Bangsa Malaysia policy emphasising a Malaysian instead of Malay identity for the state.\nMalaysian National Culture Policy is defined in the \"1971 National Culture Policy\". It defines 3 principles as guidelines for 'national culture':\n# The National Culture must be based on the indigenous [Malay] culture\n# Suitable elements from the other cultures may be accepted as part of the national culture\n# Islam is an important component in the moulding of the National Culture.\nThe strategies to achieve this policy were:\n* Restore, preserve and develop culture towards strengthening national culture through joint research, development , education and cultural expansion and connections.\n* Increase and strengthen  cultural  leadership through training and guidance to interested individuals. Support and mobilize culture as an effective engine of growth.\n* Establish effective communication to instill national awareness and Malaysian nationalism.\n* Fulfill socio-cultural needs.\n* Improve the standard and quality of arts.\nReferences"
