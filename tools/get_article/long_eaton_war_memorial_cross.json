They raised £3,674 ().\nIt was designed by the architect John Ninian Comper. The head, shaft and base were the work of William Gough, architectural sculptor of London. The erection of the steps and foundations was done by E.E. Stevens of Long Eaton under the supervision of local architect John Frederick Dodd.\nIt was erected between the churchyard of St Laurence's Church, Long Eaton and the Market Place. The memorial was unveiled on 23 October 1921 by Lieutenant Colonel C. Herbert Stepney D.S.O. and dedicated by Rt. Revd. Charles Abraham the Bishop of Derby.\nDescription\nThe memorial takes the form of the traditional old English Cross of the 15th century and was carved in Clipsham limestone. It stands  high on an octagonal shaft. The carved lantern head contains four panels; the Great Sacrifice, with the mother and friend standing by, the figure of St Michael the champion of Right and Justice, the figure of St George patron saint of England, and figures of the Virgin Mary and child. Within a bay wreath, carved on the base stone, is the inscription “To the fallen in the Great War, 1914-1919, whose names are inscribed in the Town Roll of Honour”.\nSee also\n*Listed buildings in Long Eaton\nReferences"
