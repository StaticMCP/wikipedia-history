In the , Ferny Grove had a population of 5,871 people.\nGeography\nFerny Grove is a residential suburb  north-west of the Brisbane CBD. It has 8 parks covering nearly 13% of the total area. There are three schools and two childcare centres.\nHistory\nThe district was originally known as Ferny Flats due to the presence of ferns.\nKedron Upper Provisional School opened on 16 August 1875. On 1 October 1909 it became Kedron Upper State School. In 1940 it was renamed Ferny Grove State School.\nThe construction of the railway line to Dayboro through the district led to the decision on 22 June 1916 to call the railway station in the area Ferny Grove to avoid confusion with a place called Ferny Flats in New South Wales. The suburb takes its name from the railway station.\nThe Dayboro railway line opened to Mitchelton railway station (the last station for a suburban passenger service) on 2 March 1918 and to Samford on 1 July 1918, so Ferny Grove railway station would have opened within that period.\nBefore the Second World War, Ferny Grove was mainly known for its pleasant picnic grounds along the banks of Kedron Brook and large areas of forest and fern filled valleys, one of which gives the suburb its name.\nBefore large-scale residential development, Ferny Grove was primarily industrial, containing a large claypit and tile factory operating south of the railway station.  When this factory ceased operation in the 1960s, Ferny Grove was redeveloped for housing.\nAfter the war, while the area was still largely residentially undeveloped, the Brisbane City Council operated a nightsoil sanitation depot beside Cedar Creek.  The depot closed in the late 1960s as more of Brisbane was laid with sewerage infrastructure and the need for nightsoil treatment ended.\nThe Brisbane Tramway Museum Society was established in 1968, when it became apparent that the Brisbane City Council was preparing to close Brisbane's tram system. In 1972, the former nightsoil site at Ferny Grove was leased to the society to establish the Brisbane Tramway Museum () which opened in June 1980.\nOn 17 November 1979, the railway line from Ferny Grove to Keperra was electrified.\nFerny Grove State High School opened on 29 January 1980.\nSt Andrews Catholic Primary School opened on 21 July 1985.\nBrisbane City Council continued to use the area south of the former nightsoil depot as a large refuse tip until the late 1980s. The ferny grove from which the suburb took its name is no longer there; for, situated at the present site of rubbish dump 40 years old, the grove was buried under a large hill, upon which the City Council operates a waste transfer station (resource recovery centre) and sports playing fields ().\nDemographics\nThe population in 1996 was 5,016 people. By 2001 the population was 6,011, with a population growth of 20% over those five years.\nIn the , Ferny Grove recorded a population of 5,609 people, 50.5% female and 49.5% male. The median age of the Ferny Grove population was 38 years of age, 1 year above the Australian median.  78.8% of people living in Ferny Grove were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 69.8%; the next most common countries of birth were England 5%, New Zealand 2.6%, South Africa 1.7%, Scotland 0.9%, India 0.9%.  91.1% of people spoke only English at home; the next most popular languages were 0.5% Afrikaans, 0.5% Cantonese, 0.4% Punjabi, 0.4% German, 0.3% Spanish.\nIn the , Ferny Grove had a population of 5,725 people.\nIn the , Ferny Grove had a population of 5,871 people.\nHeritage listings\nHeritage listings in Ferny Grove include:\n* 85 Mcginn Road: Ferny Grove State School's original school building structure.\nEducation\nFerny Grove State School is a government primary (Prep–6) school for boys and girls at Finvoy Street ().
