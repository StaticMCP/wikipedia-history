He finished his first year with 31 goals, including four in their Preliminary Final loss against North Melbourne at Waverley. He contested the finals with Richmond again in 1977.\nA knee injury suffered in a 1978 training session kept him out of the team for a long period and after managing just four games in 1979 he was traded to Collingwood. In his first season at Collingwood he made it to his maiden VFL Grand Final but ended up on the losing team. He finished his career at Footscray before being forced to retire following an ankle reconstruction.\nMany of Edwards's past and future relations were Australian rules footballers. His grandfather Frank Aked, uncle Frank Aked Jr. and father Arthur Edwards all played for Footscray while his son Jake Edwards played for Carlton and Shane O'Bree, his nephew, played for Brisbane and Collingwood.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*Holmesby, Russell and Main, Jim (2007).
