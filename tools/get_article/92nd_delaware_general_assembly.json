Elections were held the first Tuesday after November 1 and terms began in Dover on the first Tuesday in January. This date was January 6, 1903, which was two weeks before the beginning of the third administrative year of Governor John Hunn and Philip L. Cannon as Lieutenant Governor.\nThe distribution of the Senate seats was seven senators for New Castle County and five senators each for the Kent and Sussex counties. Likewise the distribution of the Assembly seats was fifteen representatives for New Castle County and ten representatives each for the Kent and Sussex counties. The actual population changes of the county did not directly affect the number of senators or representatives at this time.\nIn the 92nd Delaware General Assembly both chambers had a Republican majority.\nLeadership\n{| width=100%\n|- valign=top\n|\n:Senate\n* Henry C.
