The Baroque Revival building serves as the official residence of the president of Estonia.\nThe palace is guarded by Estonian Guard Battalion.\nHistory\nThe building was designed by Alar Kotli and completed in 1938. Echoing the Petrine Baroque style of the neighbouring Kadriorg Palace, then the official residence of the Estonian president, it was purpose-built in 1938 to house offices and living apartments to officials. From 1944 to 1990, it housed the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Estonian SSR. After the Republic of Estonia restored full independence in 1991, it became the presidential residence. The first president of the country to reside in the building was Lennart Meri in 1992–2001.\nThe building is not open to the public.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://president.ee/en/office-of-the-president/the-building/gallery-and-architecture The building of the Office of the President of the Republic]"
