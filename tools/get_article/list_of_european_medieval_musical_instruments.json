It covers the period from before 5th into the 15th A.D. There may be some overlap with Renaissance musical instruments; Renaissance music begins in the 15th century. The list mainly covers Western Europe. It may branch into Eastern Europe and non-European parts of the Byzantine Empire (Anatolia, northern Africa).\nPercussion\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Used in the charamba in Portugal, a circle dance for couples.\nThe adufe is a square or rectangular frame drum usually made of pine, over which is mounted a goat's skin. The size of the frame usually ranges from 12 to 22 inches on each side, and 1 to 2 inches thick. The skin is stitched on the sides, with the stitches covered by a coloured ribbon. In the interior small seeds, stones or bells are placed to make pleasing sounds. Illustrated examples are decorated, possibly with henna.\n|IberiaPortugalSpain\n|\n|\n.]]\n|-\n|Bell\n:Beehive bell\n:Sugarloaf bell\n:Gothic rib bell\nChurch bell\n|From the 1st-4th centuries A.D., Christians were persecuted in the Roman Empire and their religious ceremonies were kept secret. After persecution ended with the 313 A.D. Edict of Milan bells became part of open expression of Christianity. As Christianity became widespread, trumpets, semantrons and bells were used in religious services, including calling worshippers to service. Paulinus of Nola (about 400 A.D.) and Pope Sabinianus (about 604 A.D.) are credited for early use of bells in church.\nMonks in Byzantine cloisters in Damascus cast some of Christianity's earliest bells (about handbell sized). These were used to broadcast time inside the cloisters. Small cast bells in \"Mediterranean tradition\" were used by Christians during the first four centuries A.D.\nIn the 5th century Irish Christians made forged bells of sheet metal, and one was carried by Saint Patrick for use as a church bell. By St. Columba's day (521-597 A.D.), both riveted sheet-metal bells of iron and quadrangular cast-bronze bells were in use. The bells were wrung in the Celtic Christian Church, whose missionary work brought Christianity to parts of Europe conquered by Germanic tribes in the fall of the Roman Empire. The bells in Ireland are culturally linked to those in Scotland, Wales, England, Brittany, France, and Switzerland. Based on number of known bells, Ireland may be source of the region's sheet-metal bell type.\nIn 530 A.D., the Benedictine Order began to engineer cast churchbells and set up foundries to make them, supplying them throughout western Europe. Eastern Europe got bells from Constantinople. Cherson in Crimea also made bells.\nBeehive bells were produced on about the 8th-12th centuries A.D. Sugarloaf bells were made starting in the 12th century. Transitional rib and Gothic rib bells were made from the 12th century and into the 17th century.\n|Latin, western tradition from church\n:tintinabulum, bell\n:cymbalum, single bell\n|\n.

An example is the tintinnabulum, a wind chime made of small bells.\nRacks of hammer struck bells are called chimes. Chimes from cymbalum (Latin). In Middle Ages (10th-16th centuries) was for indoor instrument made up of 4-12 small bells, hung from a bar and struck with hammers. Beginning 12th century, may have had \"large wooden key installed\" to make playing easier and to help play bigger bells.\nDepicted in small sets (4 to 5, 8 to 9).\nCymbala, hung in towers became carillons, the bells eventually becoming very large in comparison to the wrack-suspended bells\n|Latin, western tradition from church\n:tintinabuli, little bell\n:Cymbala, plural, bell chime (multiple bells)\n|.

They copied in manuscript a letter from St. Jerome (342-420 A.D.) to Claudius Postumus Dardanus. In it, Jerome tried to explain pagan and Christian musical instruments that are mentioned in the Bible and their allegorical meanings. The letter was reproduced in Christian manuscripts. Starting about 850, scribes began to illustrate the letter in manuscripts, from descriptions of the musical instruments in the letter. Some are allegorical and wouldn't work, such as a horn with three mouthpieces for each of the Holy Trinity to blow through; however in an allegory the Trinity would be expressed by speaking through the four outlets, symbolizing the Four Evangelists.\nThe bumbulum was played by shaking it. It had hanging bells or jingles, suspended from a centerpiece, itself suspended from overhead. It was described as a carpenter's square (signifiying the Holy Cross) with a \"four cornered object\" hanging from it (signifying Christ on the Cross), with 12 pipes hanging from the object's sides (to jingle and to signify the 12 Apostles).\n|\n|s; below them are a timpanum and chorus (trumpet that splits into two and rejoins at the exit).]]\n|).]]\n|-\n|Clappers\ncrotalum\ncliquettes\ncastagnettes\n|Crotala, from the Carolingian Empire were metal chimes attached to sticks. Cliquettes (also called crotala)  were blocks of wood held in the palms. The palm-held blocks could make clicking and rattle noises like castanets. Other similar instruments worldwide include  the Thai/Cambodian krap sepha, Indian/Nepali khartal, Uzbek/Tajik qairaq, or North African krakebs. Castagnettes were wooden instrument, made up of sticks that were clapped or beaten together.\n|\n|\nholding a lyre and crotalus (clappers).]]\n| (with fipple mouthpiece and duct).]]\n|-\n|Cymbals\nCymbala\nCarillon\n|Greek word kymbolon transmitted to medieval Europe through Latin (cymbalum -singular, cymbala -plural). Examples in Roman and Byzantine mosaics show girls dancing with them, in different versions that include finger or palm cymbals, cymbals on sticks and cup-shaped cymbals.\nThe cymbals on sticks (crotala) found their way into art of the Carolingian Empire. In medieval manuscripts, cymbala became bell chimes, bells suspended in series and struck with hammers. Cup shaped cymbals also made their way into medieval manuscripts. Unlike the dancing artwork from Roman and Byzantine mosaics, the Carolingian and later artwork was stripped of sexuality and put into a Christian or Jewish context.\n|\n| plays cymbala and dances with Dionysus.]] plays the cymbala with hammers, and another also plays cymbala (cup-shaped cymbals).]]\n|, circa 1320]]\n|-\n|Drum\n|The only drums in Europe reaching into ancient times were \"Semitic frame drums\", such as the Greek and Roman tympanum.

Tympanum was used as a name, as well as tabor. These were wooden rings with leather covering one side. At first there were no jingles, as became common. A variant was the pandeiro, introduced with Muslim invasions and pictured in manuscripts in Spain and Sicily. Some tabors could be frame drums, but other grew wider than the hand-held ring which we call tambourine today.\nTof was the Hebrew instrument which Miriam played, \"most commonly translated\" into English as timbrel Near eastern origin, used by Gauls, Greeks, Romans (tympanum), Egyptians, Assyrians. Jingles were probably originally separate from this instrument. Also related to Daff.\nWhen jingles are attached, the instrument is classified as a type of rattle, a \"frame wrattle,\" in which the rattles (or jingles) strike the object to which they are attached.\nA timbrel or Basque tamborello was a \"single-skin frame drum with cymbals\" (modern tambourine), while a \"single-skin frame drum\" without jingles could also be labeled tamburin or bendir. The bendir is also a Muslim frame drum with two snares from North Africa, whose name \"probably derives from a Spanish word.\"\n|Tympanum, Latin\nTympanon, Greek\nTof\nTimbrel\nTambourine\nBendir\nBasque tamborello\n| playing a tympanum.]]\n|; Miriam was known for playing the timbrel]].]]\n|-\n|Hourglass drum\n|Images in miniatures in the Cantigas de Santa Maria and the Valcavado Beatus show an hourglass drum was in use in Spain.

Outside of the church it was used for popular music and folk music, and later by beggars.\nInitially a fiddle shaped instrument with a hand crank, which turned a wheel. The wheel rubbed against all the strings at once making them sound. Strings were sounded simultaneously, with outer strings acting as drones and center strings (which the keys activated) used for melody.\nAt first it was played by two individuals: one turned the crank while the other worked \"key rods\" to change the musical pitch of the strings. As the instrument became a smaller, one-person instrument, key rods became \"push levers\". The new mechanism required that the instrument be tilted as it was played.\nIn the 10th century A.D., Odo of Cluny wrote a work (Quomodo organistrum construatur) that helped readers make an instrument.\n|organae instrumentum, Latin\norganistrum, circa 942 A.D-14th century.\nsymphonia, 12th-16th centuries\nhurdy-gurdy, starting 18th century\nsymphonie, chifonie, armonie, Vielle à roue, French\nLeier, German\ngaita del pobre, vihuela de rueda, sinfonía, chifonía, zanfoña, Spanish\n|\n|, Add MS 42130, folio 81v]]\n|-\n|Psaltery\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Rabel\n|Fiddle, probably variation of rebec.

The boat-shaped lute would become bowed as well, used in northern Africa as the Maghreb rebab and in Andalusia, becoming the rebec.\nCytharas in early copies of Commentary on the Apocalypse were plucked lutes; these lutes were later shown bowed. Bowed instruments entered Europe from the Islamic world in \"Moorish Spain and Byzantium.\nRebab is a word for various kinds of fiddle in the Muslim world.

Clarion eventually became a range of notes, within the reach of natural trumpets and bugles. The later medieval and Renaissance cornetts (fingerhole horns) would also come to hit clarion notes.\n|\n|\n|, with clarions or herald trumpets.]]\n|-\n|Cornett\n\"Proto-cornetts\"\nFingerhole trumpets\nFingerhole horns\n|See horn, shepherd's horn and wooden trumpet'' below\nBest known as a Renaissance instrument (1500s-1600s), cornetts were wooden fingerhole trumpets whose blowhole was so small it required the instrument be played at the side of the mouth. The cornett was likely derived from an animal horn pierced with fingerholes such as the coradoiz. Later cornetts took on a stylized appearance, the curved instruments somewhat resembling an animal horn.  Carved wooden instruments had octagon exterior by the 12th century.\nIn artwork, it may be difficult to know whether an instrument is lip-blown (a trumpet) or a reedpipe (sounded by a reed inserted into the tip, held in the player's mouth).\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Crumhorn\n|See reedpipes below\nA Renaissance/Baroque instrument, the sound mechanism was a bundle of reeds beneath a wooden cap.

Used in medieval Europe by the 11th century A.D.\nIn Europe it was a flute of the countryside, made of willow (see willow flute below) as late as the mid-13th century.\nIt was also made of cane or wood (and in one example, copper) with a fipple at the top, which musicians blew through to produce sound. Later version in 1581 would have 4 fingerholes and 2 thumbholes. It was characterized in 1640 as being shorter than the recorder. One possible version of the instrument was a short four-holed duct flute (Russpfeif), illustrated in 1511 by Virdung.\nThe flaviol was a flageolet of the Pyrenees, about 6 inches long with one fingerhole and played with one hand with the drum or tabor.\nSome flaviols may have 3 fingerholes and two vents, one thumbhole and two vents. Another, played one-handed with tabor, had a single fingerhole.\n|flageol, French until 13th century\nflageolet, French from 13th century forward\nflaviol, Catalonian, Provincial\n|\n|\n|-\n|Fife and drum\n|The fife is a small transverse flute with 6 fingerholes.

The transverse flute was held horizontally below the musician's head, allowing them to blow air into the top side of the instrument (across the hole's sharp edge).\nFlutes had been known in Europe in prehistoric times but disappeared. The transverse flute had also been seen in Europe as early as the 2nd century B.C. (recorded in Etruscan artwork from a tomb in Perugia). It also made an appearance on a coin from Syria, circa 169 A.D. These are the only early examples currently known.\nThe transverse flute which arrived in medieval Europe developed in Asia, where separate traditions existed in India and China. It entered Europe through Byzantium (by way of \"North Africa, Hungary, and Bohemia\") and Germany.\nCurt Sachs saw examples of it in Greek art as early as the 10th century, and said it had been written about \"as plágioi about 800 A.D.\" Other researchers note the 11th century as the beginning of depictions in European artwork.\nTransverse flutes became popular in Germany and were known as German flutes as the instruments' use spread. In the early 20th century, it was noted that the countries of Romania, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Bohemia, Austria and Switzerland held a  \"predilection\" for the transverse flute in the folk music.\n|side blown flute\ncross flute\nGerman flute (English)\nSwegel (German)\nflauta alemana (Spanish)\nflauste d'Allemand (French)\nflauste traversaine (French)\n|.]]), a fresco of a boy holding a transverse flute.]]\n|\n|-\n|Duct flute\nfipple flute\n|Duct flute with tapering bore, seen in French art in 11th century A.D., traceable back from modern times into the 12th century. Called the recorde in England by about 1400. In 1400s multiple sizes existed. By 1511, sizes included bass, tenor, alto and soprano instruments.\nRecorders are fairly rare in medieval art, the pipe (for pipe and tabor) being more common. Possibly began main start in European music in Northern Italy in the 14th century, and was established at the beginning of the 16th century. It is difficult to tell from art if a recorder is presented (with a thumb hole) or a \"some kind of folk pipe (without the thumb hole).\"\nIn comparison, reed pipes had a very limited range of notes (having only 3-4 holes and being played with one hand). Recorders and pipes with the holes requiring two hands to play had a broader range of notes. Another detail difficult to see is the mechanism of sound; recorders are flutes in which the sound is produced by a fipple. Reed pipes such as aulos used reed bundles like a shawm to produce notes, or single reeds like the zummara.\nThree and four hole pipes have been excavated in Novgorod, dating to the 11th and 15th centuries A.D. The timeline is not clear for the development into flutes with more holes. It isn't certain whether pipes with 3-4 holes were played alone, with a timbrel or tabor, or in pairs.\nDouble flutes in Eastern Europe date back to the 12th-13th centuries. Used in Russia, Belarus, western Ukraine, Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia.\n|recorder, English, late 14th century\nflûte à bec, French\nBlockflöte, German\nflauto dritto, Italian\nflauta de pico, Spanish\nSvirel\n:dudka\n:dudka-dvoychatka\n:sopel\n:solpilka\n:pyzhatka\n|\n|\n|-\n|Double flutes\nDouble recorder\n|See: tabor pipe, below\nUses a fipple (hole to blow through, combined with sound producing hole) as on a recorder.

It became common to use ox horn after 1375 A.D. The instrument's popularity in the 15th century led to an organ stop being created by 1511 with the name gemshorn or cor de chamois. It was illustrated by Virdung in 1511, and Agricola in 1528, but may have been in decline in the 16th century.\nThe mouthpiece of the instrument is at the top of the wide end of the horn; the large hole has been filled in with a blowing hole left at the top, creating a fipple. A sound hole to create the sound is cut into the sidewall of the horn, along with fingerholes.\nArtwork showing the instrument shows three or four fingerholes on the top. Three fingerholes and a thumb hole will play an octave. Modern builders have added soundholes.\n|Scottish-English\n:gait horn (goat horn)\nFrench\n:cor de chamois, flûte en corne\nGerman\n:Gams or Gems (for chamois) + horn\nItalian\n:Corno di camoscio\nSpanish\n:gemscorno\n|, a six holed instrument with a vent in the tip, about 13 inches long.]]\n|\n|-\n|Horn\nBockhorn or Bukkehorn\nBlowing horn\nHunting horn\nSignal horn\nBattle horn\nOlifant\nSwedish cowhorn\nShofar\nWar horn\n|Trumpets made from cattle horns (the name bugle from Latin, for buculus or bullock), from other materials and shaped like cattle horns, and other animal horns such as goats (bukkehorn) or sheep (shofar).

Includes bagpipes and bladder pipes (both with internal reeds).\nEuropeans made pipes out of reeds, splitting a reed to make a single reed. A single 3-hole reed pipe could be used for the pipe and tabor. The Launeddas was a more elaborate reed pipe, with multiple pipes; each might have its own reed or one reed might sound multiple pipes. These are more common in medieval art than the recorder (which has more holes and requires both hands to play).\nReed pipe traditions around the world include Asia, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa.\n|\n|.

Europeans used horns (from goats, sheep and cattle) or carved them from wood.\nThe wooden trumpet was illustrated by Anglo Saxon artists in France in the Utrecht Psalter, circa 850 A.D. They drew long wooden horns with thick metal bands to hold the separate halves of the instrument together. Examples of surviving wooden instruments made in this fashion include the lur found in the Oseberg ship (two hollowed out halves held together with 5 rings or bands) and also the Irish wooden trumpet.\nIn Ireland, a wooden trumpet was found in the Erne River and attributed to the \"early Christian Period...8th-10th century.\" The yew-wood trumpet was carved in two halves lengthwise and bound together with strips of bronze, with a bronze mouthpiece.   This Irish trumpet has resembles trumpets illustrated in the Vespasian Psalter.\nIn literature, the instrument was the beme (byme, bemastocc) in Old English. Hygelac (in the late 10th century epic poem Beowulf calls soldiers to battle with \"horn and bȳman\".
