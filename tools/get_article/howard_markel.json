At the end of 2023, Markel retired from the University of Michigan Medical School, where he served as the George E. Wantz Distinguished Professor of the History of Medicine and Director of the University's Center for the History of Medicine. He was also a professor of psychiatry, health management and policy, history, and pediatrics and communicable diseases. Markel writes extensively on major topics and figures in the history of medicine and public health.\nEarly life and education\nMarkel was born in Detroit and grew up in Oak Park and Southfield, Michigan. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree (summa cum laude) in English from the University of Michigan in 1982 and earned his M.D. degree (cum laude) from the University of Michigan Medical School in 1986, before completing his internship, residency, and fellowship in pediatrics at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1993. Markel then joined the University of Michigan faculty as a Professor of Pediatrics and Professor of the History of Medicine. A medical historian by training, Markel earned his Ph.D. in the History of Medicine, Science and Technology from Johns Hopkins in 1994.\nPublications\nQuarantine!\nMarkel's writing focuses on major topics and figures in the history of medicine. A consistent theme in his work has been the historical relationship between epidemics, social stigma and immigration, and public health. His book Quarantine!: East European Jewish Immigrants and the New York City Epidemics of 1892, focuses on the complex interaction between anti-immigrant prejudices in the United States and the ways such prejudices were mobilized during the typhus and cholera outbreaks of 1892 in New York City. Markel's argument about the tension between isolating disease and the potential for social scapegoating acquired new urgency during the 2014 Ebola epidemic. \"Ebola is jerking us back to the 19th century\", he stated in The New York Times.\nWhen Germs Travel\nWhen Germs Travel: Six Major Epidemics That Have Invaded America Since 1900 and the Fears They Have Unleashed expands the scope of Quarantine! by chronicling American epidemics during the two \"great waves of immigration\" that helped shape the 20th century. Markel argues that the association of immigrants with infectious disease is a key component of that history, and that their stigmatization during 20th century American epidemics \"reveal[s] much about our predispositions for dealing with the perpetual threat of contagious disease\".\nAn Anatomy of Addiction\nMarkel's An Anatomy of Addiction: Sigmund Freud, William Halsted, and the Miracle Drug Cocaine explores the lives and careers of Freud and Halsted through their relationship to cocaine. Having treated patients with various forms of substance abuse, Markel thought that sharing Freud and Halsted's struggles (both personal and scientific) with cocaine would raise awareness of the perniciousness of addiction while illuminating an important chapter in medical history. Discussing his work with Science Friday's Ira Flatow, Markel said \"they were so compelling, and I thought using their lives and their struggles I could really put a human face on this terrible disease.\"\nThe Kelloggs\nIn August 2017, Pantheon Books published Markel's latest book, The Kelloggs: The Battling Brothers of Battle Creek. A finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, the book tells the story of the lives and times of the Kellogg Brothers of Battle Creek, Michigan.\nLiteratim: Essays on the Intersections of Medicine and Culture\nIn December 2019, Oxford University Press published Literatim: Essays at the Intersections of Medicine and Culture, a collection of the Markel's essays on medicine, American culture, and how their intersections compose the interstitial matter of modern life.\nThe Secret of Life: Rosalind Franklin, James Watson, Francis Crick and the Discovery of DNA’s Double Helix\nThe Secret of Life: Rosalind Franklin, James Watson, Francis Crick and the Discovery of DNA’s Double Helix, was published by W.W. Norton and Company in September 2021. Audiofile awarded the recorded book version with an October 2021 Earphone Award, The Washington Post named the version as one of the ten best audiobooks in 2021, and both Kirkus Reviews and National Public Radio placed it among its best books of the year list.\nOrigin Story: The Trials of Charles Darwin\nMarkel's latest book was published by W.W. Norton and Company in 1923.  Applauded in the press, the book was named a New York Times Editor's Choice and The Economist Magazine book of the year.\nThe Milbank Quarterly\nFrom 2013 to 2017, Markel was the editor-in-chief of the Milbank Quarterly, a peer-reviewed public health journal of population health and health policy.\nAcademic and popular periodicals\nMarkel has also contributed over 500 articles to scholarly publications and popular periodicals.\nGovernment advice and media appearances\nInfluenza\nFrom 2005 to 2006, Markel served as a historical consultant on pandemic influenza preparedness planning for the United States Department of Defense. From 2006 to 2016 he served as principal historical consultant on pandemic preparedness for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Markel was one of many who advised the federal government's response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic on the CDC Director's \"Novel A/H1N1 Influenza Team B\" real-time think tank. He and a team of researchers at the Center for the History of Medicine collaborated with the CDC to publish a digital encyclopedia of the 1918 influenza pandemic, the largest available digital collection of materials pertaining to the deadliest pandemic of the 20th century and one of the largest collections of historical documents ever assembled on a single epidemic. The collaboration between Markel and the CDC continued with analysis and documentation of non-pharmaceutical interventions deployed during the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic. \"\nEbola\nDuring the 2014 Ebola epidemic, Markel contributed his expertise on the history of epidemics and quarantines to public forums such as NPR's All Things Considered, the BBC World Service, CNN/Sanjay Gupta MD, PBS NewsHour, and The New Yorker. He reminded readers in The New York Times that \"we are a global village. Germs have always traveled. The problem now is they can travel with the speed of a jet plane.\" Markel additionally sought to enhance public understanding of the Ebola outbreak through op-eds for Reuters Opinion and The New Republic.\nCOVID-19\nHe is best known for working with Martin Cetron at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and having co-developed the evidence base of the concept of \"flattening the curve,\" a means of social distancing that saved millions of lives around the globe during the first wave of COVID-19. This work was widely covered in newspapers and media around the world, including an \"Annals of Medicine\" article that appeared in The New Yorker on August 6, 2020. Markel wrote a piece in The New York Times criticizing the Chinese government for their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. He argued that the Wuhan lockdown, which had completely shut all transportation in Wuhan and surrounding cities, was \"too much too late\", and that \"Incremental restrictions, enforced steadily and transparently, tend to work far better than draconian measures.\"\nHonors and awards\nMarkel's historical, medical, and health policy research has been recognized with numerous grants, honors and awards. In 1996 he was a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Generalist Physician Faculty Scholar for his work on American Doctors and Foreign Patients; Health Care Delivery for Russian, Jewish, Mexican, and Chinese Immigrants to the United States between 1880 and 1995, while his work titled U.S. Immigration Policy and the Public Health, 1880-1995 received the National Institutes of Health's James A.
