It is located at 4011 54th Street (at the intersection of Orlando & 54th) in Lubbock, Texas. It was constructed first as a school in 1958 and became a parish entity on January 1, 1961, with the completion of the church itself. When it was built it was surrounded by cotton fields, but is now surrounded by much of the city. On June 17, 1984, Pope John Paul II appointed it the seat of the newly created Diocese of Lubbock with the ordination of Bishop Michael J. Sheehan. As of 2007, its presiding bishop is Bishop Robert Coerver. Its school, which started out as 1st–3rd grade, has grown to serve pre-kindergarten through 12th grade.\nSee also\n*List of Catholic cathedrals in the United States\n*List of cathedrals in the United States\nReferences\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071021174805/http://www.catholiclubbock.org/diohistory/diohistory03.asp The Roman Catholic Diocese of Lubbock: History of the Diocese]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080123233011/http://www.ctkcathedral.org/parishhistory.htm The History of Christ the King Cathedral]\nExternal links\n*[https://ctk-cathedral.org/ Official Cathedral Site]\n*[http://www.catholiclubbock.org/ Diocese of Lubbock Official Site]\n*[http://www.ctkcathedralschool.org/ Official school website]"
