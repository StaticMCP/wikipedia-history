However Air Technical Service Command (ATSC) used the Des Moines airfield.\nIt is still possible to find remnants of these wartime airfields. Two were converted into municipal airports, some were returned to agriculture. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.\nMajor Airfields\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"300\" | USAAF NameCurrent Name\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"200\" | Mission\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"250\" | Host Unit\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"100\" | Location\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"250\" | Coordinates\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"450\" | Notes\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| Des Moines International AirportDes Moines Air National Guard Base\n| Joint Use USAAF/Civil AirportAir Technical Services Command1st Concentration Command\n| 842d Army Air Forces Specialized Depot\n| Des Moines\n|\n| Used by ATSC as an Aircraft/Crew processing center for heavy bomber crews.
