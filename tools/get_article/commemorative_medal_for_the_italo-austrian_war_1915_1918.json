The design of the medal was developed by engraver Silvio Canevari. The medal marks not only the victory in the First World War, but also the completion of the unification of Italy and the 70th anniversary of the beginning of the revolutionary actions of 1848 for the independence of the state.\nEarlier, on 21 May 1916, a special sign (bar with a stretched ribbon) was founded in Italy, which was awarded to employees of the Italian Army and Navy for 1 year of active service. The ribbon on the bar consisted of the colors of the Italian Flag (alternating green, white and red stripes), which is repeated six times. Each additional year of service was marked on the bar with a silver asterisk.\nRoyal Decree No. 150 of 17 January 1918 established a sign for merchant ship crews. Although these sailors did not participate directly in combat, they were also often at risk as a result of military operations. This sign represented a ribbon of silk with eleven vertical stripes of equal width of blue and white. By Royal Decree No. 1786 of 15 July 1923, the badge was converted into a Medal of Merit for Merchant Navy Crews, completely identical to the commemorative medal, but on the ribbon of the mark for merchant ship crews.\nRoyal Decree No. 665 of 3 May 1918 established a sign for railway workers. The sign consisted of a silk ribbon 37mm wide, which has 3 red stripes 9mm wide each, alternating with two white stripes 5mm wide each. After the introduction of the medal, some railway workers hung such medals at their own risk on the ribbon of the previously established sign, although there was no official decree on the absorption of this bar sign with a medal.\nA peculiarity of this medal, made evident in the inscription on the back that mentions \"minted in enemy bronze\", is that the founding decree provided that it should be \"cast with the bronze of the artillery taken from the enemy\".\nAccording to official data, more than 1,800,000 people were awarded the medal.\nAppearance\nMedal\nRound bronze medal. Height (measured with an Adamus device) — 38.5mm, diameter — 32-32,5mm, thickness — about 4mm.\n: Obverse: The left-turned profile of King Victor Emmanuel III in Hadrian's uniform and helmet. In a circle is the inscription \"GUERRA PER L'UNITA D'ITALIA\" (War for The Unity of Italy), at the bottom are the dates of 1915–1918.\n: Reverse: an image of the winged Goddess of Victory on the shields of Roman legionnaires supported by Italian soldiers with the inscription: on the left – CONIATO NEL, on the right – VRONZO NEMICO (Minted from enemy bronze).\nRibbon\nThe decree determined that the ribbon of the medal should have the same colours as the Badge for war fatigue, which was thus replaced.\nThe ribbon of the medal consisted of the colours of the Italian flag (alternating green, white and red stripes), which is repeated six times. The width of the ribbon is 38mm.\nIn fact, the ribbon is almost identical to that of the commemorative medal of the campaigns of the Wars of Independence, which has red on the left and green on the right, as the Italo-Austrian conflict was considered the continuation of the struggles for independence.\nClasps\nBronze clasps can be attached to the ribbon to recall the years of participation in the war with the clasps: \"1915\", \"1916\", \"1917\" and \"1918\".\nIn 1921, King Victor Emmanuel III also commissioned the clasps marked \"Albania 1919\" and \"Albania 1920\" for participants in this military campaign.\nWhen wearing a full-sized medal, bronze clasps are used, when wearing the ribbon on a pad daily – a silver star is used, each of which marks 1 year of service during the war.\n{|align=center class=wikitable width=60%\n|colspan=5|Ribbons\n|-\n|width=20% valign=top align=center|Less than 1 year of campaign\n|width=20% valign=top align=center|1 year of campaign\n|width=20% valign=top align=center|2 years of campaign\n|width=20% valign=top align=center|3 years of campaign\n|width=20% valign=top align=center|4 years of campaign\n|-\n|}\nThere are fracas copies of the Commemorative Medal, which were made by various companies and workshops, so there are a large number of miniature options.\nStatute of award/Eligibility criteria\nDecree No. 1 241 of 29 July 1920 provided that the right to receive a medal at the expense of the state have:\nAll military personnel of the army and navy, as well as related personnel and employees of bodies and auxiliary units who at least had a total service life of at least one year and participated in the war in Italy;\npersons who have suffered wounds or injuries or suffered a serious illness during the war, even if they have served for less than a year;\nall soldiers of the army and navy who for at least four months participated in the war in the Greek archipelago of The Dodecanese, Albania, Syria and Palestine.\nThe beginning of the campaign was considered to be 24 May 1915, the end on 4 November 1918, while for the Italian military contingent in Albania, the qualifying period is considered to be 2 August 1920 (the date of signing the Italo-Albanian Convention).\nThe commemorative medal is worn on the left side of the chest, alone or in a group with other awards. In the presence of other awards, this medal is worn after the Commemorative Medal of the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–1912 and before the medal \"For Services to the Crews of the Merchant Navy\". However, since the presence of a medal of two medals is unlikely, the Medal of Victory is most often the memorial medal on the slats and pads.\nThe calculation of the years of campaign began on 24 May 1915 and ended on 4 November 1918, while as regards the soldiers of the contingent sent to Albania the useful period was extended until 2 August 1920, the date of the signing of the Italo-Albanian Convention.\nIt was also granted to non-Italian soldiers, in particular French and some Austrians, who later became Italian citizens with the annexation of Trentino, who had distinguished themselves in battle.\nManufacturers\nIn connection with the need to produce a large number of copies of this award, it was produced by several companies. Therefore, the awards have small differences, and under the portrait of the king contained the stigma of the manufacturer. There are stamps of six varieties, although there are medals without manufacturer's markings:\nFL & CM\nM.Nelli. Inc.\nSacchini-Milano\nS.I.M.\nS.I.M.
