One such was a mug depicting the tea party scene from the book, with a Cheshire Cat that disappeared when the mug was filled with a hot beverage.\nAlis was available for Unix workstations from Digital Equipment Corporation, Sun Microsystems and others. Two site licenses were sold for Digital's VMS operating system, one to ExxonMobil and one to a brokerage in New York City.\nIn addition to providing a graphical office suite environment with a number of modules including graphics editor and word processing functions, very advanced for the time, Alis was distinguished by a very powerful scripting language called \"ELF\" (Extended Language Facility), which was capable of, for example, reading spreadsheet data, performing calculations on it, and merging results into text documents.\nAster*x and Applixware\nApplixware's next major project was called Aster*x, but was renamed to Applixware to avoid confusion with Asterix the comic book hero. During the mid-1990s, Applixware was one of a small number of WYSIWYG word processors available for Unix systems. Competitors included products from Island Software and proprietary software from the computer hardware companies.\nIn the late 1990s, Linux began to emerge as a desktop operating system, and Applixware was ported to Linux, becoming  the first graphical office suite for the platform. Sales expanded to the point where Applixware was available across the USA as shrink-wrapped software on retail shelves at stores like CompUSA and Micro Center.\nIn 1999, Sun Microsystems bought a competing product, StarOffice, and turned it into the open source OpenOffice software suite. That destroyed the market for competing software, and Applixware sales declined.\nAfter OpenOffice\nApplix Inc. began to seek other software markets, leveraging the power of their scripting engine and flexible architecture to expand into business intelligence software markets such as OLAP. Applixware is often used in the industrial world as a means of developing large scale Unix and Linux applications, and glueing together other applications.\nThe Applixware unit of the company was renamed [https://vistasource.com/ Vistasource, Inc.] and sold to [https://parallaxcap.com/ Parallax Capital Partners] in 2001.\nVistasource now offers a freely available limited version for home users on Linux.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://vistasource.com/ Vistasource, Inc.]\n*[https://parallaxcap.com/ Parallax Capital Partners]\n*[https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3791 Office Wars: Applixware and StarOffice | Linux Journal]"
