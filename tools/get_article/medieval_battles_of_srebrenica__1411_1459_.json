He ruled until 1410 when the city fell to the rule of Sigismund of Luxembourg, during the Hungarian Wars against Bosnia in 1411. Sigismund awarded Serbian noble Stefan Lazarević for his campaigns against Tvrtko II Kotromanić and gave the city to his domain. The city was reconquered by King Stjepan Tomaš in 1444. For the short period of time in May 1445 all of Lower Podrinje fell to Đurađ Branković, but with the help of Bosnian Duke, Ivaniš Pavlović, he withdrew out of Podrinje. In 1448 the Ottomans launched a large counter-offensive into Bosnia penetrating the realm of Stjepan Tomaš. Stjepan Vukčić Kosača had joined the Turks against Tomaš but with Hungarian support they were driven out. In 1449 Stjepan Tomaš reconquered the city from Branković.\nSee also\n* Battle of Bileća\nReferences"
