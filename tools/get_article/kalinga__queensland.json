In the , Kalinga had a population of 2,126 people.\nGeography\nKalinga is bounded by Kedron Brook to the north. The Kedron Brook bikeway follows the brook on the suburb's north-east boundary with two bridges over the creek to Shaw Park in Wavell Heights () and to Toombul Terrace in Nundah (). There is a third bridge over the creek () from the bikeway (but not part of the bikeway) to Carew and New Street in Nundah.\nKalinga is predominantly flat, approximately  above sea level.\nThe M7 Airport Link passes under the suburb through a tunnel.\nThe land use is predominantly residential with the remainder of the suburb being parks. The suburb features a mix of small apartment blocks and standalone houses, with some older style Queenslanders still extant.\nHistory\nThe name Kalinga derives from Aboriginal word Ngalinnga (\"ngalin-nga\"), probably from the Yuggera language, Turrbal dialect, meaning belonging to us.\nThis area is notable for the original residence of Alfred Lutwyche, known as Kedron Lodge.\nOn Saturday 8 October 1888, auctioneers Arthur Martin and Co offered 220 allotments for sale in the Kedron Park Estate, formerly part of the land owned by the then late Justice Alfred Lutwyche and in the vicinity of Park Road, Judge Road and Station Road.\nAn open air-movie theatre opened circa 1920 at 70 Lodge Street (). It was enclosed circa 1929. It seated 400 to 500 people. It was variously known as the Kalinga Picture Palace, Kalinga Picture Theatre, Kalinga Theatre and the Star Theatre. It burned down in the early 1960s and a Mobil petrol station was built on the site.\nOn Saturday 23 October 1920, Brigadier-General L.C. Wilson officially opened the war memorial gates at Kalinga Park at the end of Park Street () to commemorate the service of local men in World War I. Between 200 and 300 people attended the ceremony. The gates were designed by Andrew Lang Petrie who also did the carving of the Helidon sandstone while the steelwork was done by Mr Rodgers.\nBetween 1927 and 1962, an electric tram service operated by the Brisbane City Council served the suburb, branching off the Chermside line at Kedron Park Road.\nOn Sunday 5 February 1928, a Presbyterian Hall was opened in Kalinga by Moderator W.C. Radcliffe.\nOn Sunday 23 July 1933, Archbishop James Duhig officially blessed and opened Kedron Lodge as a temporary Catholic Church.\nOn 25 November 1934, Duhig blessed and laid the foundation stone for the new St Anne's Catholic Church. On Sunday 19 May 1935 Duhig opened and dedicated the church, designed in the Spanish style and could accommodate 500 people. On Sunday 1 August 1937 Duhig blessed and opened the adjoining presbytery.\nThe Kalinga Scout group was formed in 1938. It now occupies the post office of the 17th Australian Personnel Staging Camp in Kalinga Park during World War II.\nSt Anne's Catholic School opened in February 1948 and closed in 1966.\nIn 1950 mechanic Henry William Endres of 51 Kent Street constructed a caravan from a disused aircraft. It was  long and contained two bedrooms, a bathroom and kitchen.\nIn 1983, the Presbyterian Church and Hall in Emma Street were purchased by the Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia (a separate Presbyterian denomination) as their Brisbane church.\nThe name Kalinga had been in use for the area for many years as a neighbourhood within the suburb of Wooloowin, but it was not until 16 October 2015 that Kalinga was officially gazetted as a suburb, having been excised from Wooloowin following requests from local residents.\nDemographics\nIn the , Kalinga had a population of 2,126 people, 49% identifying as male and 51% identifying as female.
