This is Roco's second attempt to chase the presidency.\nPre-election\nBy mid-2003, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo was poised to run for president in 2004 elections. Raul Roco was offered by Arroyo to be his running mate, but he declined, and insisted her to run as his vice president instead.\nOn selection of running-mate after calling out Arroyo, Roco is considering former Cebu governor Lito Osmeña, Senators Noli de Castro, Loren Legarda and Manny Villar and Metro Manila Development Authority chairman Bayani Fernando as his running mate. But he chose former Tarlac Vice Governor Hermie Aquino.\nHe also revealed the party's Agenda of Hope on December 1, 2003.\nSenate slate\nDuring the December 1 convention, Aksyon nominated 19 personalities for their senatorial ticket: Rene de Villa, de Villa's former running mate Oscar Orbos, Senator Rodolfo Biazon, former transportation and communications secretaries Josie Lichauco, former Pasay congresswoman Lorna Verano-Yap, former agriculture secretary Leonardo Montemayor, police Chief Superintendent Romeo Maganto, former assemblyman Emil Ong, former solicitor general Frank Chavez, bowling champion Bong Coo, retired Gen. Rodolfo Gutang, Lanao del Sur congressman Dimaporo Ramos, Sulu congressman Arden Anni, Misamis Oriental Congressman Oscar Moreno, economist and their 2001 senatorial candidate Monsod, broadcasters Pia Cayetano,TV personality Jay Sonza and Melanio \"Batas\" Mauricio, and Christy Ramos, daughter of former President Fidel Ramos.\nRoco's Aksyon forged an alliance with de Villa's Partido Reporma, and Lito Osmeña's PROMDI to form their Alyansa ng Pag-asa slate. But the final senate slate was reduced into only, seven with Coo, Nicanor Gatmaytan Jr., Nueva Ecija politician Eduardo Nonato Joson, Mauricio, Sonza, and former bureaucrat Perfecto Yasay selected in the slate, with the inclusion of Chavez from Reporma.\nThe slate was nickanamed JC JC GaBaY, with J for Jay Sonza, C for Chavez, J for Joson, C for Coo, Ga for Gatmaytan, Ba for Batas Mauricio, and Y for Yasay.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Party\n!Occupation\n!Elected\n|-\n|Francisco Chavez\n|Reporma\n|Former Solicitor General\n|\n|-\n|Bong Coo\n|Aksyon\n|Former athlete\n|\n|-\n|Nicanor Gatmaytan Jr.\n|Aksyon\n|\n|\n|-\n|Eduardo Nonato Joson\n|Aksyon\n|Nueva Ecija Governor\n|\n|-\n|Batas Mauricio\n|Aksyon\n|\n|\n|-\n|Jay Sonza\n|Aksyon\n|TV personality\n|\n|-\n|Perfecto Yasay\n|Aksyon\n|Former bureaucrat\n|\n|}\nSurveys and support to alliance\nRoco performed second to third in surveys, but due to his health problem or prostate cancer suffering, he needs to go overseas for treatment. Unfortunately for him and the party, some of the supporters left his campaign, and insisted that he will not backout. Also, the party feared vote buying initiated by President Arroyo's Lakas–CMD.\nResult\nRoco and the whole Alyansa lost the election, but he later called out Arroyo about her controversial election victory.\nIn August 2005, Roco died at the age of 63.\nReferences"
