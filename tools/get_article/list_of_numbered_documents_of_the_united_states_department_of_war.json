They were mostly (drill) regulations and other field manuals (as they were later called, when the War Department adopted the FM Field Manual numbering), but also collections of military laws or descriptions of countries of military interest and campaigns or battles. Only a few Technical Manuals (TM's) (as they were later called) are included in this series. These publications were mainly printed by the Government Printing Office, but also by some other printers. Many of them can be found in the HathiTrust, Archive.org and CARC (Combined Arms Research Center) online libraries. Other known US War department publications are for example General Orders, Special Orders and Special Regulations. Many of the so-called Monographs, mainly descriptions of campaigns and battles, have their own numbering, but several of them also have a War Department Document (W.D. doc) number.\nList\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
