It has a fractional sloop rig, a plumb stem, a slightly angled transom, a transom-hung rudder controlled by a tiller and a fixed stub keel with a retractable centerboard. It displaces  and carries  of lead ballast.\nThe boat has a draft of  with the centerboard extended and  with it retracted, allowing operation in shallow water or ground transportation on a trailer.\nThe boat is normally fitted with a small  outboard motor for docking and maneuvering.\nThe design has sleeping accommodation for five people, with a double \"V\"-berth in the bow cabin, a straight settee berth in the main cabin plus a convertible double berth on the port side. The galley is located on the port side just forward of the companionway ladder. The galley is equipped with a two-burner stove, an icebox and a sink, with a refrigerator optional. The head is located just aft of the bow cabin on the starboard side. Cabin headroom is .\nFor sailing the design may be equipped with a jib, storm jib or 150% genoa.\nThe design has a PHRF racing average handicap of 261 and a hull speed of .\nOperational history\nIn a 2010 review Steve Henkel wrote, \"... the accommodations plan of the Seaward 24 shows both a gimballed stove with oven and space for a refrigerator (though ... a refrigerator is somewhat impractical on an outboard powered sailboat because of the electrical drain on the batteries, which would require many hours of charging with the noise and smell of a running engine). Best features: Her relatively low freeboard and springy sheer give the Seaward 24 a sleek and salty look, as if she is ready for whatever challenges the sea might bring to her. She is well-built to boot, and with her generous sailplan and long waterline for her size has a better than even chance of satisfying the requirements of experienced sailors. Worst features: None noted.\"\nSee also\n*List of sailing boat types\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://archive.today/20220204154518/https://www.sailingtexas.com/Pics7/picseaward24109a.jpg Photo of a Seaward 24]"
