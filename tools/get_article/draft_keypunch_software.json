Based in Saint Paul, Minnesota, the company marketed low-cost compilations and utilities for home computers such as the Apple II, Commodore 64, Atari 8-bit and ST, Amiga, and MS-DOS; some releases used the label Box Office Software.\nHistory\nBy 1985, packaging for Keypunch compilations listed the company at 1221 Pioneer Building, Saint Paul, Minnesota. In 1986, Compute! reported that Keypunch had introduced a line of $9.99 Atari ST titles, with Amiga versions planned. The following year, Antic described a “new family” of 8-bit programs from the company sold at low prices through mass-market retailers.\nKeypunch also acted as a U.S. distributor for certain third-party games. A 1990 Amiga World review of Ikari Warriors lists the U.S. distributor as “Keypunch Software, 1221 Pioneer Building, St. Paul, MN 55101.” By 1990, the company was also issuing titles under the Box Office Software imprint.\nProducts\nKeypunch primarily issued multi-game compilations and low-cost utility or education disks across several platforms. Examples documented in contemporary packaging and museum/press records include Adventure Pak/Adventure Quest series and other Apple II/Commodore/PC compilations, along with MS-DOS collections such as Strike Force.\nReception and criticism\nRetrospective reporting has criticized some Keypunch releases for repackaging public-domain or shareware games. A technical history of Sopwith by its modern maintainer notes that a version titled Red Baron appeared in Keypunch’s Strike Force compilation with attribution removed and the game labelled “public domain.” Museum catalog entries corroborate Strike Force as a Keypunch-published compilation for IBM PC compatibles.\nSee also\n* Shareware\n* Budget game\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  – company overview and catalog (database)\n*  – catalog and notes (database)"
