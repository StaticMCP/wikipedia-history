Elections were held the first Tuesday after November 1 and terms began on the first Tuesday in January. It met in Dover, convening January 6, 1863, two weeks before the beginning of the first year of the administration of Governor William Cannon.\nThe apportionment of seats was permanently assigned to three senators and seven representatives for each of the three counties. Population of the county did not effect the number of delegates. Both chambers had a Democratic majority.\nLeadership\nSenate\n*John R.
