It includes The Collapsium (2000), The Wellstone (2003), Lost in Transmission (2004), and To Crush the Moon (2005). The first two novels of the series were also printed together as The Monarchs of Sol by Science Fiction Book Club ().\nThe Queendom referred to is the present-day Kingdom of Tonga. In the Queendom of Sol, humanity has returned to monarchism as a stabilizing force in the face of accelerating technological change.\nThe Collapsium\nThe Collapsium is a 2000 hard science fiction novel and the first in the series. The first section of the novel is based on McCarthy's short story \"Once Upon a Matter Crushed\", which was a Sturgeon Award finalist. A reviewer stated McCarthy used postmodern literary technique in consciously creating a protagonist who is a \"throwback\" to the scientist-heroes of Golden Age SF.\nThe Wellstone\nThe Wellstone is a 2003 novel, publishes as the second in the series. In The Wellstone, McCarthy explores the lives of immortal humans known as immorbids in the future.  Nanotechnology has created the wellstone, programmable matter that can emulate nearly any other form of matter, and nanotech fax machines that can not only fabricate objects on demand, but store and retrieve human bodies (with minds intact), cure disease or reverse aging, or be used as teleporters.  Ultradense exotic matter known as collapsium makes gravity manipulation and faster-than-light communication possible.  Humanity has formed a solar system–wide society based on monarchy.\nMany of the technologies in this novel are also described in McCarthy's 2003 nonfiction book, Hacking Matter.\nTo Crush the Moon\nTo Crush the Moon, published in 2005, is the last in the four-part series.\nAwards\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Awards for The Queendom of Sol books\n!Year\n!Work\n! colspan=\"2\" |Award\n!Result\n!\n|-\n!2000\n| rowspan=\"2\" |The Collapsium\n|Theodore Sturgeon Award\n|—\n|Finalist\n|\n|-\n!2002\n|Nebula Award\n|Novel\n|Finalist\n|\n|-\n!2007\n|To Crush the Moon\n|Nebula Award\n|Novel\n|Finalist\n|\n|}\nCovers\nFile:The Collapsium - bookcover.jpg|The Collapsium\nFile:The Wellstone - bookcover.JPG|The Wellstone\nFile:To Crush the Moon - bookcover.jpg|To Crush the Moon\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
