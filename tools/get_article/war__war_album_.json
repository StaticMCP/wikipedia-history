It was released in March 1971 on United Artists Records, their first for the label.\nThe album did not gain much attention upon release, but sales and critical acclaim picked up after their subsequent hit albums throughout the 1970s, the next appearing later in 1971.  One single was taken from the album: \"Lonely Feelin'\" backed with \"Sun Oh Son\", which did not chart.  Of the other songs, \"War Drums\" includes a chant of the band's name and appears to be an attempt at a group theme song; and \"Fidel's Fantasy\" generated some controversy over its spoken word monologue criticizing Fidel Castro.\nCover art\nThe cover painting depicts many disembodied arms giving a three finger salute, a concept also used on the group's first album with Eric Burdon: Eric Burdon Declares \"War\".  There are actually eight arms in the picture, but only seven people in the group, revealing that the artwork was commissioned when Burdon was still with them, confirmed by the cover notes which credit him for the concept.  The cover art is by Norman Seeff.  The back cover shows the same picture, mirror reversed.  The original edition was printed on a linen textured cover slick, and has an inner gatefold photo of the band.\nTrack listing\nAll tracks composed by War (Papa Dee Allen, Harold Brown, B.B. Dickerson, Lonnie Jordan, Charles Miller, Lee Oskar, Howard E. Scott).  The album notes also mention that Hilton Valentine (of The Animals) helped with the lyrics to \"Back Home\".\nSide one\n# \"Sun Oh Son\" – 5:57\n# \"Lonely Feelin'\" – 4:31\n# \"Back Home\" – 6:42\nSide two\n# \"War Drums\" – 3:52\n# \"Vibeka\" – 8:03\n# \"Fidel's Fantasy\" – 11:03\nPersonnel\n;War\n*\"Papa\" Dee Allen – conga, bongos, percussion, vocals (monologue on \"Fidel's Fantasy\")\n*Harold Brown – drums, percussion, vocals\n*B.B.
