While the Republican primary was later held on May 24, 2016.\nSanders overwhelmingly won the March 26 caucus which had about 230,000 participants, winning 72.7% of the state's legislative district delegates to Clinton's 27.1%, giving Sanders a net gain of 47 pledged delegates.\nLater, the state also held a non-binding primary vote on May 24, in which Clinton received about 52% of the vote – although this has no actual bearing on the delegate count for the nomination.\nOpinion polling\n, Seattle, Washington, March 26, 2016.

His victory did not come as a huge surprise, since Seattle as a city had donated the most money per capita to the Bernie Sanders for President Campaign, and Washington state (particularly Seattle) has a history of electing more left-leaning politicians including other self-proclaimed socialists to office. Sanders won all counties in the state on the day of the caucus.\nClinton had lost the Washington caucus eight years earlier to Barack Obama.\nAt a rally in Wisconsin on March 26, Sanders told supporters \"We knew from day one that politically we were going to have a hard time in the Deep South, but we knew things were going to improve when we headed west.\"\nClinton won the Washington Democratic Primary, but lost the caucus. The same was true with Nebraska. She won the Primary and lost the caucus. In both states, despite the primary being non-binding it had significantly higher turnout than the caucuses, fueling criticism that caucuses are undemocratic and a form of voter suppression. For the 2020 nominating process, Washington and Nebraska both replaced their caucuses with binding primaries to allocate the states' delegates.\nSee also\n* 2016 Washington Republican presidential primary\nReferences"
