The ward returns three council members.\nBoundaries\nLocated east of Glasgow city centre, the ward is centred around Dennistoun, although does not include all of the district - the Reidvale streets to the south of Duke Street are within the Calton ward. It was created in 2017 from the East Centre ward (the Dennistoun, Milnbank and Haghill neighbourhoods), the Springburn ward (the Royston, Germiston and Sighthill neighbourhoods along with commercial/industrial land at Blochairn and St Rollox) and a small part of the Anderston/City ward (the Ladywell neighbourhood and the grounds of Glasgow Royal Infirmary).\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Allan Casey(SNP)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Elaine McDougall(Labour)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Kim Long(Green)\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1|Anthony Carroll(Green)\n|}\nElection results\n2022 election\n2017 election\nSee also\n*Wards of Glasgow\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/scotland/dennistoun-ward-glasgow-city#.Xm_XO7enzN4 Listed Buildings in Dennistoun Ward, Glasgow City] at British Listed Buildings"
