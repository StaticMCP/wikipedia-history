It is situated in Lat Krabang District, Bangkok, approximately  east of the city center.  The university consists of nine faculties: engineering, architecture, science, industrial education and technology, agricultural technology, information technology, food industry, liberal arts, and medicine.\nHistory\nKing Mongkut statue at KMITL\nKMITL was founded in 1960 in Nonthaburi province as a telecommunications training center under the technical support of the Japanese government; the center was later named the Nonthaburi Institute of Telecommunications. After moving to a new location at Lat Krabang near Suvarnabhumi Airport, the campus became King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang.\nEngineering began at KMITL in 1960 with a course on telecommunications engineering.\nSince a technical cooperation agreement (August 1960-August 1965) was reached between the Japanese and Thai governments in 1960 to establish a telecommunications training center in Thailand, Japan has continued the cooperation over the course of 40 years. The telecommunications training center became a three-year specialty college in 1964, and then in 1971 joined two other colleges and rose to the ranks of an institute of technology. Part of the school moved to the Ladkrabang campus, and architecture, industrial education/science, and agricultural technology departments were established.\nOn the Japanese side, Tokai University (1977), Tokyo Institute of Technology (1992) and University of Electro-Communications (1997) concluded academic exchange agreements with the school and assisted with such things as the expansion of the university, human resource development and research promotion as part of second phase (December 1978-August 1983) and third phase (April 1988-March 1993) \"Project-type Technical Cooperation\" projects. A Japanese corporation funded scholarship system was established (1971), as well as practical factory-based training (1977), a construction scholarship system (1989), etc. Thus, actual cooperation activities involving linkages with industry as well as things like the start of an invitation program to the Institute for Posts and Telecommunications Policy and a human resource exchange with a public institution were promoted.\nIn 1982 KMITL launched the nation's first doctoral degree in electrical engineering and awarded a doctorate in electrical engineering to Dr. Chom Kimpan, who also earned the first Doctor of Engineering granted by a Thai university.\nThrough the \"Partners Project\" (1992), using a satellite launched by Japan, there were joint experiments in applied technology (areas such as distance medicine, distance education, computer networking, satellite broadcast, and joint development of a human resource training system using distance education, as well as the implementation of a continuation project called the \"Post-Partners Project\" (1996).\nBesides this, as using the developed skills and facilities for the benefit of other developing countries, JICA has been active in supporting KMITL in organizing \"third-country training\" in information technology (started in 1978; presently known as the Japan-Thai Partnership Program, JTTP; having completed 11 programs with 13 courses established), dispatched KMITL professors to the engineering department of National University of Laos and supported KMITL's acceptance of research students from universities in Laos.\nMore recently KMITL has partnered with Thailand Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, a joint effort among Tokyo Institute of Technology, Thailand National Science and Technology Development Agency, KMITL and SIIT to offer international master's degree in Automotive Engineering. From its inception, KMITL has grown to include seven faculties and affiliated research centers.\nAt present, KMITL has been recognized as one of the science and technology universities in Thailand. This could be because of Japan's long-term and ongoing assistance; comprehensive assistance to the university, industry and each level of government; the significant influence of early graduates of study abroad programs in Japan. In the future, one can expect continued development through KMITL's participation in the Southeast Asia Engineering Education Network (SEED-NET) and strengthening of links with other higher education institutions.\nIn 2017, Carnegie Mellon University set up a joint institute with KMITL with the support of the Office of the Higher Education Commission. This was named CMKL University and first opened for student admissions in the 2018 academic year.\nFaculties and departments\n* [http://www.kbs.kmitl.ac.th/ KMITL Business School (KBS)]\n** International Programs\n*** Doctor of Philosophy in Industrial Business Administration\n*** Master of Business Administration\n*** Bachelor of Business Administration\n**** Innovation & Technological Marketing\n**** Global Business & Financial Management\n**** Digital Logistics & Supply Chain Management\n*** Bachelor of Business Administration in Global Entrepreneurship\n** Thai-language Programs\n*** Doctor of Philosophy in Business Administration\n*** Master of Business Administration\n*** Bachelor of Business Administration\n**** Innovative Industrial Management\n**** Management and Innovative Entrepreneurship\n*** Bachelor of Business Administration in Digital Transformation and Technology Management\n*** Bachelor of Arts in Business Economics and Management\n* Faculty of Engineering\n** Department of Agricultural Engineering\n** Department of Biomedical Engineering\n** Department of Chemical Engineering\n** Department of Civil Engineering\n** Department of Computer Engineering\n** Department of Electrical Engineering\n** Department of Electronics Engineering\n** Department of Food Engineering\n** Department of Industrial Engineering\n** Department of Instrumentation Engineering\n** Department of Mechanical Engineering\n** Department of Telecommunication Engineering\n* Faculty of Architecture\n** Department of Architecture\n** Department of Interior Architecture\n** Department of Industrial Design\n*** Industrial Design\n*** 3D-Based Communication Design\n** Department of Communication Arts and Design\n*** Communication Design\n*** Film and Video\n*** Photography\n** Department of Fine Arts\n*** Painting\n*** Sculpture\n*** Printmaking\n** Department of Urban and Environmental Planning\n* Faculty of Science\n** Department of Biology\n** Department of Chemistry\n** Department of Computer Science\n** Department of Mathematics\n** Department of Physics\n** Department of Statistics\n* Faculty of Industrial Education\n** Department of Engineering Education\n** Department of Architecture Education\n** Department of Agricultural Education\n** Department of Industrial Education\n** Department of Language and Social\n*** Japanese\n*** English\n* Faculty of Agricultural Technology\n** Department of Agronomy\n** Department of Horticulture\n** Department of Animal Production Technology\n** Department of Animal Science\n** Department of Agricultural Development\n*** Agricultural Development\n*** Agricultural Communication\n** Department of Soil Science\n** Department of Plant Pest Management\n* Faculty of Agro-Industry\n** Department of Agricultural Industry\n** Department of Fermentation Technology\n** Department of Food process Engineering\n* Faculty of Information Technology\n* Faculty of International College\n** Department of Software Engineering\n** Department of Engineering and Technology Management\n* College of Advanced Manufacturing Innovation (AMI)\n* Faculty of Medicine\nCenters and services\nResearch Center for Communication and Information Technology (ReCCIT)\nThe KMITL Research Center for Communication and Information Technology (ReCCIT) project is the fourth \"project-type technical cooperation\" project implemented at KMITL and has as its goals strengthening the center's research and development capacity and the graduate school program.\nThe implementing partner organizations are the Ministry of University Affairs, KMITL, and a Japan-based advisory committee (Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications or formerly Ministry of Public Management, Home Affairs, Posts and Telecommunications; Tokyo Institute of Technology; Tokai University) has been established.
