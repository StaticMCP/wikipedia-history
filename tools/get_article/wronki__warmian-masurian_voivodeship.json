It is located in the region of Masuria.\nHistory\nWronki was founded in the 16th century. As of 1600, the population of the village was solely Polish. In 1938, during a massive campaign of renaming of placenames, the government of Nazi Germany renamed it to Fronicken in attempt to erase traces of Polish origin. In 1939, it had a population of 342. Following Germany's defeat in World War II, in 1945, the village became again part of Poland and its historic name was restored.\nReferences"
