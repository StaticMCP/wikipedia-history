They attempted an assassination on Batista, the dictator of Cuba at the time, in 1957.\nHistory\nThe DR-13-M, at the time just called “Directorio Revolucionario” (DR), was founded in 1954 as a Catholic student group opposed to the Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista, defining its principles as political liberty, economic independence, and social justice. For a student group, the DR-13-M made military contributions to the Cuban Revolution by focusing on targeted plans.\nIn 1957, the group coordinated an attack on Batista's Presidential Palace organised by DR-13-M leader José Antonio Echeverría, who died the same day in a related incident, and the opening of a second front in the Escambray Mountains, which was taken over by Che Guevara.\nThe death of Echeverría and other leaders led to the virtual collapse of the group, and its remaining membership largely joined the Escambray front under the leadership of the 26th of July Movement. After the death of Echevarría, the leadership passed to Faure Chomón and Rolando Cubela Secades in the urban underground and the Escambray Mountain insurrection, respectively.\nThe DR-13-M's \"Escambray Manifesto\" of 24 February 1958 envisaged simultaneous urban and rural guerrilla warfare against Batista. It called for the restoration of the Constitution of 1940, and for social revolution, while attacking \"those who only a few years ago supported the Nazis in the conquered lands of Europe\". As the manifesto circulated throughout the island, the Escambray guerrillas gained strength.\nGallery\nFile:Faure Chomón Mediavilla-DR-13-M.jpg|Faure Chomón.\nFile:Rolando Cubela Secades.webp|Rolando Cubela Secades.\nFile:Version flag of the Student Revolutionary Directorate.svg|Another flag used by the DR-13-M\nReferences"
