The facial features of this syndrome are triangular face with a pointed chin, frontal bossing, hypertelorism, eyes with downslanting palpebral fissures, a flat nasal bridge, a long philtrum.\nPresentation\nThe signs of this disease are:\nVery frequent:\n* Intellectual Disability\n* Macrocephaly\nFrequent:\n* Abnormal facial shape\n* Abnormality of speech\n* Curly Hair\n* Seizure\n* Frontal bossing\n* Ventriculomegaly\nOccasional:\n* Autistic Behaviour\n* Cafe-au-lait spot\n* Gait Disturbance\n* Hypertelorism\n* Hypotonia\n* Open mouth\n* Long philtrum\n* Polymicrogyria\n* Prominient forehead\nVery rare:\n* Downslanted palpebral fissures\n* Depressed nasal bridge\n* Decreased circulating IgA level\nCause\nThe cause of SKS is gain-of-function mutation in a gene MTOR.\nThis disease is inherited in Autosomal Dominant fashion, but most of the times it's de-novo mutation.\nDiagnosis\nSKS is a rare condition so many physicians aren't familiar with. A diagnosis of SKS is suspected based upon the identification of symptoms, a patient and family history and a thorough clinical evaluation.\nSKS can be confirmed with the detection of a germline or mosaic mutation in the MTOR gene.\nFrequency\nFrequency of this disease is unknown, but all ethnic groups are equally affected\nTreatment\nThere is no cure for SKS, but management of some symptoms can be achieved\nHistory\nSKS was first described by Dr Smith, L.D et al. in 2013.\nReferences"
