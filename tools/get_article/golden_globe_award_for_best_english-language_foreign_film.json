As with other \"Best Film\" Golden Globe Awards, the film itself is considered the winner, with neither directors nor producers being the recipients.\nOriginally awarded once to 1948's Hamlet at the 6th Golden Globe Awards, the award was re-established in 1955 and awarded infrequently until the 30th Golden Globe Awards where it was won by 1972's Young Winston, after which it was discontinued. All of the winners have been British films, with the exception of 1967's The Fox, which was a Canadian production; the 1968 winner, Romeo and Juliet, was a co-production between the United Kingdom and Italy.\nThe Award is mostly remembered on the jubilee anniversary celebrations of when the awarded films were released. It is also invariably mentioned prominently in the obituaries of a producer, a director, or an actor who was associated with the film.\nWinners\n* 1948 – Hamlet\n* 1955 – Richard III\n* 1957 – Woman in a Dressing Gown\n* 1958 – A Night to Remember\n* 1960 – The Trials of Oscar Wilde\n* 1964 – Girl with Green Eyes\n* 1965 – Darling\n* 1966 – Alfie\n* 1967 – The Fox\n* 1968 – Romeo and Juliet\n* 1969 – Oh!
