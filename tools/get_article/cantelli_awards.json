The awards were hosted at the Teatro Coccia, in Novara, where also all the other editions were hosted. The prestigious prize was won, among others, by Ádám Fischer, Lothar Zagrosek, and Riccardo Muti, who was the first Italian conductor to win the prize. Many winners of the prize went on to become prominent conductors.\nThe awards were created in honour of Guido Cantelli, a noted Italian conductor, Italy's greatest talent in conducting in his time, and a protégée of Arturo Toscanini. On November 23, 1958, Cantelli, who by then had become director of La Scala and was performing in the world's greatest theaters and orchestra, died in an airplane clash in Paris, France. Five years later, the Premio Cantelli was established in Novara―the place of birth of the maestro, and where he held his last concert.\nHeld biennially, this competition, which was won by numerous world famous conductors, ran until 1980. There were a total of 10 editions between 1961 and 1980. In 2020, after a long pause, the awards were revived in occasion of the centenary of Cantelli's birth, with the Cantelli Award celebrating its eleventh edition.\nAward categories\nwon the Cantelli Award in 1967]]\nAs of 2020, the awards had six categories.

The prize once included 5,000,000 lire, a gold medal, a diploma, and a contract to conduct a concert at La Scala.\nIn November 1956, Guido Cantelli, at the time the leading Italian conductor, hailed by Toscanini as is heir, and the new director of La Scala, died in an airplane crash in France. Toscanini, who was in failing health and died less than two months later, was not informed of the death of his protégée. Cantelli was but 36 years old at the time of his death. He left his wife, and their 5-month-old son.\nIn 1961, five years after the tragedy, the Cantelli Awards were established in Novara, to be hosted at the Teatro Coccia. The late Italian maestro was originally from Novara, and it was in this Piedmontese city that he conducted his last concert.\nThe last edition of the awards, in which the Cantelli Prize was won by Donato Renzetti, was held in 1980. In the 2020s, in occasion of the anniversary of the maestro's 100th birthday, the Cantelli Awards were revived in Novara.\n2020 revival\nThe 2020 Cantelli Prize was won by New Zealand's Tianyi Lu, who also won the Teatro Regio of Torino Orchestra Award and the Youth Award. In the 2020 edition, the Critics Award was won by Dmitry Matvienko, who was also the winner of the Made in Italy Award.
