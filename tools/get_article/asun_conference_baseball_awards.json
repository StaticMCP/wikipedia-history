Currently, it names a Coach, Pitcher, Player, Freshman, and Defensive Player of the Year. The Coach of the Year award, which dates to 1979, is the oldest. The others—Player (1982), Freshman (2001), Pitcher (2004), and Defensive Player (2014)—were added later. Through the 2001 season, the then-existing awards were known as the major awards of the Trans America Athletic Conference, the ASUN's former name.\nThrough the end of the 2019 season, Stetson has won 29 major awards, the most of any school in the conference.\nOn six occasions, a team has won swept the major awards given out in a season: Mercer in 1983, Georgia Southern in 1986 and 1987, Stetson in 1989, Florida International in 1995, and Florida Atlantic in 1999.  All six instances came before 2001, when only the Coach and Player of the Year awards existed.\nFour individuals have won more than one of the awards. Mercer's Craig Gibson was named Player of the Year in 1985 and Coach of the Year in 2013; Mercer's Chesny Young was named Freshman of the Year in 2012 and Player of the Year in 2013; Jacksonville's Michael Baumann was Freshman of the Year and Pitcher of the Year in 2015; and Florida Gulf Coast's Jake Noll was Freshman of the Year in 2014 and Player of the Year in 2016.\nCoach of the Year\nThe conference's Coach of the Year award is presented annually to the conference's most outstanding baseball coach, as chosen by a vote of ASUN coaches taken at the end of the regular season.  From 1979–1981 and 1987–1992, the award was given automatically to the coach of the TAAC's tournament champion, rather than chosen by the league's coaches.\nThe award was first presented in 1979.  From 1979–2001, it was known as the Trans America Athletic Conference Coach of the Year award, until the conference switched to its current name for the 2002 season.\nWith the exception of 2012, the award has been given to the coach of the league's regular season champion in each season since 2004. In 2012, USC Upstate's Matt Fincher was given the award after his team, picked to finish last, finished second in the ASUN.\nStetson's Pete Dunn, who has coached in the conference since 1986, has won the award six times, the most of any coach.  He is one of three coaches to win the award in three straight years (1988–1990), along with Georgia Southern's Jack Stallings (1985–1987) and Florida Gulf Coast's Dave Tollett (2008–2010).\nWinners by season\nBelow is a table of the award's winners since it was first given out in 1979.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Season\n!Coach\n!School\n!Conf.
