The Gaels compete at the U Sports football level, within the Ontario University Athletics (OUA) conference. Queen's began competing in intercollegiate football in 1882. The Gaels play in the Richardson Memorial Stadium in Kingston, which has a capacity of 8,000.\nSince its inception, the team has won 23 Yates Cup championships and four Vanier Cup championships, the most recent being in 2009. Unique to only two Canadian universities (the other being University of Toronto Varsity Blues), Queen's has also won three Grey Cup championships (1922, 1923, 1924).\nThe program has had three Hec Crighton Trophy winners, Larry Mohr and Tommy Denison, who won it twice.\nHistory\nEarly history\nQueen's has competed continuously since 1882 and the team began organized play in 1883 when the Ontario Rugby Football Union (ORFU) was first founded. The team later went on to win two ORFU championships in 1893 and 1894.\nThe first organized university football league in Canada, the Canadian Intercollegiate Rugby Football Union (CIRFU), was founded in Kingston in November 1897, with charter members Queen's, McGill University, and the University of Toronto.\nAs a member of the Canadian Rugby Union (CRU), Queen's qualified to play in the Grey Cup championship, and went on to win three straight in 1922, 1923 and 1924.\nSince the beginning of the Vanier Cup championship in 1965, Queen's has won four titles in 1968, 1978, 1992 and 2009.\nDoug Hargreaves era\nAfter playing for Frank Tindall from 1951 to 1955, Doug Hargreaves was picked to be his successor in 1976. Though Tindall left some big shoes to fill Hargreaves fill them and then even eclipsed them with his first 16 seasons making the playoffs, 13 of this seasons making the conference finals, with 8 of those seasons winning the conference title, 3 of those seasons playing in the Vanier cup final, with 2 Vanier cup championships (1978, 1992). After many years of success in 1993 and 1994 they missed the playoffs. Hargreaves decided to retire after the 1994 season. Hargreaves is remembered as a great coach who demanded excellence. The driveway leading up to the stadium is named Hargreaves way after Coach Hargreaves.\nBob Howes Era (1995–1999)\nOriginally just named as interim coach in 1995 but after leading the team to the Dunsmore cup (lost 8–3 to the Ottawa Gee Gees) was named head coach. Howes had a plethora of football knowledge as being a 5-time grey cup champion and being a long time assistant to Doug Hargreaves. With a decent staff that saw many holdovers from the Hargreaves era including legendary defensive co-ordinator Bob Mullen. He also had his son Beau Howes as his starting quarterback. The first three years of Howes Campaign were very successful with 3 playoff appearances and two trips to the Dunsmore (1995, 1997) though losing both. They technically have a ceremonial Dunsmore cup victory in 1997 as U Ottawa was found to have ineligible players and their season was forfeited. After the 1997 season though was the end of the success for the Howes staff. The 1998 and 1999 campaigns failed to make the playoffs and thus ended the Howes era.\nPat Sheahan era (2000–2018)\nThe team was led by head coach Pat Sheahan from 2000 to 2018. His first year was a difficult one only mustering a 1–7 season. However, in the off-season he recruited a nucleus of talent including future two-time Hec Creighton trophy winner QB Tommy Denison (Qb #7 2001–2003). With Denison leading the way Sheahan would coach them to a Yates cup appearance in 2002. Though he returned Queens back to a respectable team, Sheahan's teams quarterbacked by Denison never were able to win the Vanier. However, his next star quarterback recruit would be and that was Danny Branagan (Qb # 5 2005–2009). With Branagan he led them to their fourth Vanier Cup in 2009. The following year the team endured a difficult 2010 season, finishing 3–5. The team went on to have strong seasons in 2011, 2012, and 2013, with two semi-final finishes and culminating with a Yates Cup berth; unfortunately, they would lose to Western 51–22. The next season after 8 straight playoff campaigns was ended in 2014 when the Gaels failed to make the playoffs. The team finished fourth in the OUA in 2015, being beaten by the Carleton Ravens in the semi-final game. 2016 saw a new stadium built in the place of the old Richardson with a brand new turf field, jumbotron, and 8000 seats. The team finished in seventh place in 2016 with a 3–5 record and missed the playoffs due to a tie-breaker with Guelph, whom they lost to earlier in the season. 2017 was the last playoff appearance in the Sheahan Era which ended ina quarterfinal loss to McMaster.\nIn 2019, Sheahan was dismissed as head coach after a disappointing 2018 campaign.\nSteve Snyder era (2019–present)\nSteve Snyder took over the team in 2019. In 2021, he led the team to a perfect regular season in the OUA and a berth into the Yates Cup Final (which they lost to Western 29–0). Steve was named OUA and U SPORTS Coach of the Year in 2021. Snyder's era has seen a youth movement on the coaching staff, and a revitalized interest in football in the community, hence the back-to-back hosting of the Vanier cup in 2023 and 2024. 3 straight top four finishes has shown the success Snyder has brought to the program with his own personal touch.  in 2019]]\nHead coaching history\nFrank Tindall (1939–1975)\nFrank Tindall began coaching the Queen's Gaels football team in 1939, following his playing career with the Toronto Argonauts.
