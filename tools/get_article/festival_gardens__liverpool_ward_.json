The Festival Gardens ward was created as a single-member ward from the riverside section of the former St Michael's ward, small sections of the former Riverside and Mossley Hill wards. The ward boundaries follow the River Mersey, Brunswick Way, Sefton Street, Grafton Street, behind Garswood Street, Dingle Mount, Dingle Lane, Aigburth Road, Colebrook Road, Ruthin Way, Hindlip Street, the Northern Line, behind Ampthill Road, Aigburth Road and Jericho Lane.}}\nReferences"
