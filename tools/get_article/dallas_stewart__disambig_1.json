Wayne Lukas, with whom he worked for 12 years. There, he oversaw Grade I winning horses like Lady's Secret, Thunder Gulch, Serena's Song, Timber Country, and Tabasco Cat.\nIn 1999, Stewart trained Kimberlite Pipe to win the Grade II Louisiana Derby and Sapphire and Silk to win the Grade III Prioress Stakes at Belmont Park. Stewart won his first training title at the 2000 Keeneland Race Course Spring Meet. His stakes performers during 2000 included Dollar Bill, who won the Grade II Brown & Williamson Kentucky Jockey Club Stakes at Churchill and competed in all three legs of the Triple Crown.\nIn 2001, his stabled earned more than $3.8 million, topped by Unbridled Elaine's payday for winning the Grade I Breeders' Cup Distaff. He also won two graded events with Nasty Storm—the Grade II Churchill Downs Distaff Handicap and Grade III Dogwood Stakes.\nIn 2002, Stewart won the Grade II Gallant Bloom Handicap at Belmont Park with Nasty Storm, and other stakes with Sweet Nanette, Kazoo and Saintly Look. In 2003, Saintly Look won the Grade III Lecomte Stakes and Stewart also won the Mardi Gras Handicap at Fair Grounds with Even the Score and the Perryville Stakes at Keeneland Race Course with Clock Stopper.\nIn 2006, he won the Kentucky Oaks (G1) with Lemons Forever. He was the trainer of multiple graded stakes winners Silverfoot and Macho Again. Stewart won his first stakes at storied Saratoga Race Course when Macho Again won the 2008 Jim Dandy Stakes.\nIn the 2013 Kentucky Derby Dallas Stewart's horse, a colt named Golden Soul, finished second to Orb. Golden Soul's odds were 50–1, and he was one of five colts at those odds, the other four being Falling Sky, Frac Daddy, Vyjack, and Giant Finish. In the 2014 Kentucky Derby, a Dallas Stewart trainee once again finished second; 37-1 Commanding Curve. Commanding Curve retired from racing in 2016, and is now in training with Olympic equestrian Phillip Dutton.\nIn 2016, Saint's Fan, a chestnut colt that Stewart bred, trains, and owns himself, won the $100,000 Louisiana Champions Day Juvenile Stakes at Fair Grounds Racecourse in New Orleans, Louisiana. Another trainee, Tom's Ready, won the 2016 Gr.II Woody Stephens Stakes and Gr.III Ack Ack Handicap, before finishing fifth in the Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile to Tamarkuz.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080521034954/http://www.ntra.com/stats_bios.aspx?id=2397 Dallas Stewart Biography from NTRA]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071224150909/http://www.dallasstewartracing.com/stewart/public/index.cfm Dallas Stewart Racing Page]\n* [http://www.westpointtb.com/documents/private/articles/loosemacho.pdf Jim Dandy Win Article]\n* [http://www.churchilldowns.com/news/archives/macho-again-wins-derby-trial-opening-day-churchill-downs Derby Trial Article from Churchill Downs]\n* [https://www.espn.com/sports/horse/news/story?id=3507561 Jim Dandy article from ESPN]"
