Grace S. Aspinwall of CCM Magazine rated the album three stars, calling this a \"solid record\". At New Release Tuesday, Dwayne Lacy rated the album three-and-a-half stars, stating that on a release that \"is convicting, but not condemning\" the material is \"introspective, but yet serves as an encouragement and an admonishment for believers\", yet \"The trap beats were a little excessive, but the album is wonderfully written.\" The Christian Manifesto's Calvin Moore rated the album four stars, remarking how \"Love, Hope, War showcases an artist in rare form and places him, I believe, squarely in the top 10 Christian rappers at the moment.\" At Christian Music Zine, Anthony Peronto rated the album 4.75 out of five, writing how the artist \"is back and better than ever\" on a release where \"The lyricism was on point, the concept of the album was consistent and fully realized, and the production has vastly improved from his previous projects.\"\nCommercial performance\nFor the Billboard charting week of February 16, 2013, Love Hope War was the No. 88 most sold album in the entirety of the United States, and it was the Nos. 5 and 2 most sold albums on the Christian Albums and Top Gospel Albums charts respectively.
