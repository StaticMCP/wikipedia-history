As Weekes was the only nominated candidate on election day, she was deemed elected without the need for a vote. Paula-Mae Weeks thus became the first woman to take office as president of Trinidad and Tobago on 19 March 2018.\nThe PNM government nominated Christine Kangaloo, the President of the Senate. The opposition UNC declined to endorse her candidacy on the grounds that she was an active member of the government party and so have nominated their own candidate, Israel Raja-Khan. It's the first time in more than two decades that a presidential election took place without a consensus candidate.\nElectoral method\nThe President of Trinidad and Tobago is indirectly elected for a 5-year term by an electoral college comprising all 41 members of the House of Representatives and all 31 members of the Senate, plus the speakers of both chambers.\nTo win the election a candidate must gain a plurality of votes cast, whereby a quorum comprising the Speaker of the House of Representatives, 10 Senators and 12 other member of the House of Representatives must be met for the election to be considered valid. If only one candidate should be nominated to run in the election, he or she shall be considered to have been elected president without the need for a vote to take place.\nCandidates\nNominated by the Government\n*Christine Kangaloo, President of the Senate (2015-2023)\nNominated by the Opposition\n*Israel Raja-Khan, Senior Counsel\nResults\n}}\nReferences"
