It was the third university in England, after Oxford and Cambridge, and the 22nd in Europe. After being advised by bishops and magnates that Northampton was a threat to Oxford, Henry III dissolved the university in 1265, and signed a Royal Decree that banned the establishment of a university in Northampton.\nIn 2005 the decree was repealed by the Privy Council, allowing the then University College Northampton (founded in 1924) to gain university status and become the University of Northampton.\nHistory\nFounding\nNorthampton was, in the 13th century, a far more important town than is evident today, so it is not particularly surprising that a university was established there. The town was also, briefly, the King's seat.\nThe antecedents of the University of Northampton are in a school founded in the reign of King Richard I. Richard patronised the institution and, according to at least one historian, between 1176 and 1193 the school at Northampton ‘rivalled or even eclipsed the Oxford schools’.\nPhilosopher Daniel of Morley wrote around that time:\n}}\nGrammarian Geoffrey of Vinsauf and legal authority Roger Vacarius both based themselves in Northampton. There was also a strong Jewish learning community.\nThe school lost a powerful supporter with the death of King Richard.\nIn the 13th century, through the reign of King John and his son Henry III, the nascent university gained the patronage of Simon de Montfort.\nIn 1261, with the approval of Henry III, the university was granted a royal charter.\nAbolition\nThe existence of the university was brief. In 1265, four years after it was established, Henry III revoked the town's licence to have a university.\nOne factor in this may have been the participation of scholars in opposition to the King's forces during the Siege of Northampton in April 1264, when Henry III's forces besieged the supporters of Simon de Montfort, patron of the university, in Northampton Castle.\nSources from the time suggest that opposition from the University of Oxford was also a significant factor.  Henry wrote to the mayors and burgesses of Northampton on 1 February 1265, saying:\n}}\nModern University of Northampton\nThe university's name was revived in 2005 when the then University College Northampton, itself an amalgam of earlier institutions, was upgraded to full university status and renamed the University of Northampton. Other than the name and the location in the town, there is no link between the medieval university and the modern university.\nSee also\n*Medieval university\n*List of medieval universities\n*University of Stamford\n*Third-oldest university in England debate\n*Medieval University of Dublin\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111028042113/http://www.northampton.ac.uk/info/20001/about-us/423/history-of-the-university-of-northampton University of Northampton history and dates]"
