It was originally planned to be released alongside the movie on Xbox and PC. Both versions were cancelled at some point.\nPlot\nThe storyline revolves around the eternal war between the vampires and lycans, and as the player, they can choose the side they are teaming with. The players can choose the movie's main character, the vampire Selene, or the lycan Raze and also choose between a selection of other vampires, other Lycans or the hybrid.\nThe player is tasked with taking to the battlefields where they must accomplish missions, whether protecting someone, killing someone, getting an item from somewhere, or simply attacking everyone. Using different weapons, the player slaughters enemies throughout the action-based gameplay.\nReception\n| JXV = 6/20\n}}\nThe Eternal War received mixed to negative reviews on release. Edge described the game as a \"fun playing experience\", citing the \"good buddy AI\" the upgrade system and weapon types, although noting \"the 3D camera is restrictive\". Daniel Wilks of Hyper dismissed the game for its \"dull and linear\" levels, \"poorly animated and incredibly stupid\" opponents, and the \"dull textures\", \"limited polygons\" and \"uninspiring effects\" of its visual presentation. Jeuxvideo found the game to be a waste of time, critiquing the game's character models and effects, \"lousy\" aiming system and camera, and \"small\" levels.\nReferences\nExternal links"
