The competition, known as the Queensland Wizard Cup due to sponsorship from Wizard Home Loans featured 11 teams playing a 26-week long season (including finals) from March to September.\nThe Souths Logan Magpies won their first premiership after defeating the Ipswich Jets 24–18 at North Ipswich Reserve. Central Comets'  Nat Bowman was named the competition's Player of the Year, winning the Courier Mail Medal.\nTeams\nTwo new teams entered the Queensland Cup in 2008, as the competition expanded north with the Mackay Cutters and the Northern Pride. Mackay hadn't hosted a team since the 1996 season, while the Pride, based in Cairns, were represented by the Cairns Cyclones from 1996 to 2000. The two new clubs replaced the Aspley Broncos and North Queensland Young Guns, who withdrew from the competition.\nWith the loss of Aspley and the Young Guns, the Brisbane Broncos and North Queensland Cowboys formed new feeder club partnerships. The Broncos sent players to six different clubs and the Cowboys sent players to the Cutters and Pride, while the Canberra Raiders formed a partnership with the Souths Logan Magpies. 2008 marked the first season since 1997 that the Melbourne Storm were not affiliated with the Norths Devils, instead forming the Central Coast Storm who played in the NSW Cup.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:left\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:white; width:1%\" | Colours\n! style=\"background:white; width:18%\" | Club\n! style=\"background:white; width:21%\" | Home ground(s)\n! style=\"background:white; width:18%\" | Head coach(s)\n! style=\"background:white; width:15%\" | Captain(s)\n! style=\"background:white; width:18%\" | NRL Affiliate\n|-\n|\n| Burleigh Bears\n| Pizzey Park\n| Jim Lenihan\n| Shane O'Flanagan\n|  Brisbane Broncos\n|-\n|\n| Central Comets\n| Browne Park\n| Wayne Barnett\n| Wayne Barnett\n|  Brisbane Broncos\n|-\n|\n| Easts Tigers\n| Langlands Park\n| Darren Smith\n| Trent Young\n|  Brisbane Broncos\n|-\n|\n| Ipswich Jets\n| North Ipswich Reserve\n| Kevin Walters\n| Danny Coburn\n|  Gold Coast Titans\n|-\n|\n| Mackay Cutters\n| Mackay JRL Grounds\n| Shane Muspratt\n| Shane Muspratt\n|  North Queensland Cowboys\n|-\n|\n| Northern Pride\n| Barlow Park\n| Andrew Dunemann\n| Chris Sheppard\n|  North Queensland Cowboys\n|-\n|\n| Norths Devils\n| Bishop Park\n| Mark Gee\n| Marc Brentnall\n|  Brisbane Broncos\n|-\n|\n| Redcliffe Dolphins\n| Dolphin Oval\n| Gary O'Brien\n| Troy Lindsay\n|  Brisbane Broncos\n|-\n|\n| Souths Logan Magpies\n| Davies Park\n| Paul Bramley\n| Phil Dennis\n|  Canberra Raiders\n|-\n|\n| Tweed Heads Seagulls\n| Ned Byrne Field\n| Michael Woods\n| Brad Davis\n|  Gold Coast Titans\n|-\n|\n| Wynnum Manly Seagulls\n| Kougari Oval\n| Shane McNally\n| Darren Bain\n|  Brisbane Broncos\n|}\nLadder\nRegular season\nThe 2008 Queensland Cup regular season featured 22 rounds, with one team receiving a bye in each round.

They then defeated the Northern Pride in the major semi final to earn their second Grand Final appearance. Souths Logan, who finished second and qualified for the finals for just the second time, were upset by the Pride in Week 1 of the finals. In Week 2, they hosted and defeated Redcliffe before getting revenge on the Pride and defeating them 16–12 in the preliminary final to qualify for their first Grand Final.\nFirst half\nSouths Logan got off to a brilliant start when they forced an error off the kickoff and scored in the second minute through prop Cy Lasscock. It took them just five minutes to extend their lead when hooker McKanah Gibson dived over from dummy half in almost the exact spot of their first try. After denying two Ipswich try scoring opportunities, the Magpies crossed for their third try of the game when Matt Templeman intercepted an Ian Lacey pass and sprinted away to score. With two minutes left in the half, Souths Logan converted a penalty goal from in front to lead 18-0.\nSecond half\nDown 18, Ipswich began their fightback with a try from hooker Michael Ryan just four minutes into the second half. In the 55th minute, the Jets cut the lead to six when centre Donald Malone pulled down a Lacey kick to score. Just a minute later, Ipswich completed the comeback when prop Aaron Sweeney scored under the posts to level the scores. A tense final 20 minutes followed, with Souths Logan being denied a try in the 65th minute and Ipswich missing a field goal from in front in the 78th minute. With 40 seconds left to play, Magpies' halfback Albert Talipeau put his centre Kyle Lodge through a gap close to the line. Lodge was cut down short by Jets' fullback Troy O'Sullivan but got up and scored after O'Sullivan couldn't complete the tackle. Referee Justin Eastwood checked with the video referee, who awarded the try. Josh White converted the try to seal the win and give Souths Logan their first Queensland Cup premiership.\nEnd-of-season awards\n* Courier Mail Medal (Best and Fairest): Nat Bowman ( Central Comets)\n* QANTAS Player of the Year (Coaches Award): Scott Smith ( Burleigh Bears)\n* Coach of the Year: Kevin Walters ( Ipswich Jets)\n* Rookie of the Year: Fred Tila ( Easts Tigers)\n* Representative Player of the Year: Isaak Ah Mau ( Queensland Residents,  Ipswich Jets)\nSee also\n* Queensland Cup\n* Queensland Rugby League\nReferences"
