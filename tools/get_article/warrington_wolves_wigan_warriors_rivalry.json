The two clubs are some of the most successful in England, and annually compete in the Locker Cup to celebrate their rivalry.\nHistory\n}}\nThe competitive history of the two clubs began on 18 January 1873 when the then two-month-old Wigan Warriors played their first match against Warrington Wolves (who would not form an official team for another three years). Both clubs were founding members of the NRFU, and have enjoyed a fierce rivalry throughout their history. Both sides also have other major rivalries, Warrington vs Widnes Vikings and Wigan vs St Helens, which at times has dampened the rivalry between them. However it was Wigan's dominance in during the late 1980s and 90s which caused the largest taming of the rivalry. It was only in 2009 and 2010 following Warrington's back-to-back victory in the Challenge Cup and the club's subsequently establishing themselves as a Super League Top Four Club which saw the rivalry heat up again as both teams started simultaneously competing for top honours. In the decade that followed, the clubs contested three Super League Grand Finals in 2013, 2016, and 2018. The rivalry has said to have been at its peak between 2011 and 2013.\n, home of Warrington]]\n, home of Wigan]]\nHead to head\n:Statistics correct as of 05/05/2025\nIn all competitions, competitive and uncompetitive:\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Played\n!Warrington\n!Drawn\n!Wigan\n|-\n|326\n|126\n|6\n|191\n|}\nMeetings in major finals\n*1925–26 NFRL Division One Championship Final: Wigan 22–10 Warrington\n*1948–49 Lancashire Cup Final: Wigan 14–8 Warrington\n*1950–51 Lancashire Cup Final: Wigan 28–5 Warrington\n*1989–90 Challenge Cup Final: Wigan 36–14 Warrington\n*1985–86 Lancashire Cup Final: Wigan 34–8 Warrington\n*1986–87 Premiership Final: Wigan 8–0 Warrington\n*1987–88 Lancashire Cup Final: Wigan 28–16 Warrington\n*2013 Super League Grand Final: Wigan 30–16 Warrington\n*2016 Super League Grand Final: Wigan 12–6 Warrington\n*2018 Super League Grand Final: Wigan 12–4 Warrington\n* 2024 Challenge Cup Final: Wigan 18-8 Warrington\nCollective honours\n:As of the 2024 Super League Grand Final\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!colspan=\"2\"|Warrington Wolves\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Honour\n!colspan=\"2\"|Wigan Warriors\n|-\n!Rank\n!No.\n!No.\n!Rank\n|-\n|12th\n|3\n|League Championships\n|24\n|\n|-\n|12th\n|3\n|League Leaders\n|24\n|\n|-\n|4th\n|9\n|Challenge Cup\n|21\n|\n|-\n|4th\n|2\n|Premiership\n|6\n|\n|-\n|\n|4\n|League Cup\n|8\n|\n|-\n|\n|0\n|Charity Shield\n|4\n|\n|-\n|\n|0\n|World Club Challenge\n|5\n|\n|-\n|\n|8\n|Lancashire League\n|18\n|\n|-\n|\n|9\n|Lancashire Cup\n|21\n|\n|-\n|\n|0\n|BBC2 Floodlit Trophy\n|1\n|5th\n|-\n|}\nLocker Cup\n| gov_body       = RFL\n| champion       =  Wigan Warriors (35th title)\n| season         =\n| most_champs    =  Wigan Warriors\n| count          = 35\n| website        =\n| TV             =\n| qualification  =\n| related_comps  =\n}}\nThe Locker Cup (previously the Wardonia Cup until 1972) is a friendly tournament contested by rugby league clubs Warrington Wolves and Wigan Warriors introduced in 1938. The single game tournament was played as a preseason friendly alternating between the club's home grounds annually until the switch to summer rugby in 1996. It was brought back for Magic Weekend 2019, but was cancelled a year later due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then it has been played for during the Super League season.\n;Results\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year !! Winner !!
