Her work is described as being \"faithful to the original with an unostentatious use of Quebec idiom\".\nBiography\nWarda was born in Cairo, Egypt, but immigrated to Montréal, Quebec, Canada with her parents at the age of 9. She first learned English from watching Happy Days on television. She graduated from the Université de Montréal with a degree in English literature. At the time, she did not intend to pursue a career in translation. In 1991, she began working as an assistant at the Théâtre de Quat’Sous under Pierre Bernard. Bernard persuaded her to translate her first play, Brilliant Traces by Cindy Lou Johnson. This was a success, earning her a Prix de la critique nomination from the Association québécoise des critiques de théâtre. She went on to translate several other plays during her tenure, such as Cindy Lou Johnson's The Years (Les années), Brad Fraser's ''The Ugly Man (L'homme laid''), and Philip Ridley's Pitchfork Disney.  She left the Théâtre de Quat'Sous in 2001. In 2002, she began working for the National Theatre School of Canada, holding the position of associate director general.\nWarda was nominated for the Governor General's Award in 2001 for her translation of George F. Walker's Suburban Motel as Motel de passage, and later won a Governor General's Award in 2011 for her translation of Greg MacArthur's The Toxic Bus Incident as Toxique ou l’incident dans l’autobus. Warda later stated that she had never expected to win, as she had not expected a play to be chosen for the award.\nIn 2015, Warda's translation into French of Erin Shields’ If We Were Birds was used in a production of the play directed by Geneviève L. Blais.\nWarda lives in the Plateau-Mont-Royal borough of Montreal with her husband, actor Benoît Gouin.\nAwards and nominations\n* 2011 Governor General's Award for a French Language Translation (won) – ''Toxique ou l'incident dans l'autobus (2011)\n* 2006 Masque de la Traduction – Wit (2006)\n* 2001 Masque de la Traduction (won) – Motel de passage'' (2001)\n* 2001 Governor General's Award for a French Language Translation – Motel de passage (2001)\n* 1996 Masque de la Traduction – Variations sur un temps (1996)\n* 1992 Prix de la critique, Meilleur traduction – ''Traces d'étoiles (1992)\nSelected works\nTranslated plays\n* Traces d’étoiles (1992) – written by Cindy Lou Johnson, directed by Pierre Bernard.
