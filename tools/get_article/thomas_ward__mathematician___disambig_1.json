He attended Woodlands Primary School in Lusaka, Zambia, Waterford Kamhlaba United World College in Swaziland, and (briefly) the Thomas Hardye School in Dorchester, England. He studied mathematics at the University of Warwick from 1982, gaining an MSc with dissertation entitled \"Automorphisms of solenoids and p-adic entropy\" in 1986 and a PhD with dissertation entitled \"[http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/73322/ Topological entropy and periodic points for Zd actions on compact abelian groups with the Descending Chain Condition]\" in 1989, both under the supervision of Klaus Schmidt.\nCareer\nWard worked at the University of Maryland in College Park, the Ohio State University, and the University of East Anglia. In 2012 he moved to Durham University as Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Education, in 2016 to the University of Leeds as Deputy Vice-Chancellor for Student Education, and to Newcastle University as Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Education from 2021 to 2023. He served in editorial roles for the London Mathematical Society from 2002 to 2012 and was a managing editor of Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems from 2012 to 2014. He served on the HEFCE advisory committees for Widening Participation and Student Opportunity (2013–15) and Teaching Excellence and Student Opportunity (2015–17).\nWorks\nIn 2012 Ward, along with Graham Everest (posthumously) was awarded the Paul R. Halmos - Lester R.
