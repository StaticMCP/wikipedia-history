It ended with the Treaty of Nöteborg in which the border between the two countries was officially established for the first time.\nBackground\nAfter the War of Deposition against Birger was over, the Swedes were once again able to resume their eastern policy with their military. Simultaneously, something had happened which made both Sweden and Novgorod want to make peace with the other. A possible reason is that the constant state of war was detrimental to trade in the region. At this time, the Teutonic Order also attacked Novgorod, which might have contributed to Novgorod wanting peace.\nWar\n1321–1322\nIn 1321, Novgorodian troops attacked Viborg, not much is known about the attack except that it ended in failure for the Novgorodians and they were forced to retreat. In 1322, Knyaz Yuri arrived in Novgorod and ordered the people there to repair several battering rams, while they were being repaired, the Swedes attacked Korela, but this expedition ended in failure.\nAfter this failure, Knyaz Yuri along with soldiers from Novgorod went to Viborg, and from the 12 August to 9 September they besieged it, the Novgorodians rammed the walls with six battering rams since the fortress was very strong. After they had broken into the town, the Novgorodians killed and hanged many of the people inside, with others being led to the low country. After having laid siege to the fortress for a month, they assaulted it, but this ended in failure, and they were forced to retreat. Despite the Novgorodians taking many prisoners, the fortress held strong.\nAfter the failed siege of Viborg, the Novgorodians were eager to make peace, since new problems had sprung up at their southern border.\n1323 and peace\nAny fighting in 1323 is unknown, but it is at this time that representatives from both Sweden and Novgorod sat down to discuss peace. The negotiations took place at the newly established Nöteborg. The Swedish representatives were Erik Turesson, Hemming Ödgislesson, Peter Jonsson, and the priest Vämund. The Novgorodian representatives were very strong with the Prince of Novgorod himself attending. A certain Ludwig von Groten also acted as a mediator. When the negotiations were finished, the first ever \"eternal peace\" had been signed between Sweden and Novgorod, and the border was established for the first time in history.\nAftermath\nThe Treaty of Nöteborg became a base of agreement between Sweden and Novgorod until the Treaty of Teusina in 1595, and all peace treaties until Teusina were listed as being additions of modifications of the aforementioned Treaty of Nöteborg.\nReferences"
