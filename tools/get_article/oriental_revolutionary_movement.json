Politically, being one of the founders of Frente Amplio, it left the alliance in 1993 and is now part of the far-left Comisiones Unitarias Antiimperialistas (COMUNA).\nHistory\nMRO was founded by Ariel Collazo on April 21, 1961, following a split from the Partido Blanco. He traveled to Cuba and became a Marxist–Leninist under the influence of Che Guevara and the Cuban Revolution. The establishment of the MRO involved a large number of members of the Communist Party of Uruguay who left the party and former executives, fiercely criticizing the anti-Stalinist and revisionist lines of the Communist Party of Uruguay.\nIn 1971, MRO was one of the founding organizations of Frente Amplio. It left Frente Amplio in 1993.\nSince 2008, it has been part of the electoral alliance Comisiones Unitarias Antiimperialistas (COMUNA) which however failed at the admission for the 2009 election and didn't run in 2014. Current General Secretary is Mario Rossi Garretano.\nStructure\nMRO has a youth wing, the \"Guevarist Youth\" (') and a mass front, the \"Revolutionary Front for a Socialist Alternative\" ('). MRO publishes Los Orientales.\nSee also\n* Tupamaros – National Liberation Movement\n* Revolutionary Left Movement\n* Revolutionary Movement Tupamaro\n* Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia\n* National Liberation Army\n* Paraguayan People's Army\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
