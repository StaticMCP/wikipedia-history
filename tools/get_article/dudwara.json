Dudwara is known for its agriculture, Netaji Park and famous dangal in which wrestlers from all over the Northern India came to participate. Dudwara is one of the biggest village in the Tehsil in terms of area. Dudwara is south of the village of Bhaddu commonly known as Lower Bhaddu and located uphill from the Bhini bridge on the river Bhini.\nDudwara also has a small handicraft industry that is finding it a little difficult to survive in modern times. The community includes members from both the Hindu and Muslim communities.\nReferences"
