His name is also sometimes spelled (incorrectly) as \"Mnqele\" owing to an error on his passport. He has explained: \"My name is Jabulani Edward Manqele, but Home Affairs made a mistake when I got my ID … they omitted the ‘A’ in my surname. As a result, in my passport my surname is ‘Mnqele’, which is wrong.\"\nClub career\nManqele was signed by Free State Stars from Vodacom League side Trabzon FC in 2011. He scored 11 league goals in his first season with Stars and became the transfer target of several of the top PSL sides, among them Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates.\nOn 22 June 2012, Manqele joined Mamelodi Sundowns on a five-year deal.\nManqele joined Moroka Swallows on a one-year loan, in August 2013.\nInternational career\nAs a result of his performances in the league, he won his first international cap for Bafana Bafana team in a friendly match against Senegal on 29 February 2012.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
