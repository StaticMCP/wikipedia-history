It takes its name from an earlier bridge on the same site which was completed during the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1897. The abutments of the old bridge are still visible at both sides to the left (facing north) of the current bridge. The remains can be seen at low tide near the abutments.\nBy the 1960s shipping had ceased on the River Dee. The bridge's lifting mechanism was removed and the roadway fixed permanently in place. In 2005 the Jubilee Bridge was awarded Grade II Listed building status by Cadw.\nSee also\n*List of bridges in Wales\nReferences"
