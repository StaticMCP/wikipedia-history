Recipients of the award are registered adult leaders who have made an impact on the lives of youth through service given to the council.\nThose deemed worthy of the award by their local council must be approved by the National Court of Honor. Upon their approval, recipients are presented with a silver beaver pendant suspended from a blue and white ribbon, as well as the corresponding square knot.\nHistory\nThe Silver Beaver was introduced in 1931 as a pin-on medal, but due to the heavy weight of the medallion it was switched over to a neck ribbon in mid-1932.  A blue-white-blue ribbon bar was introduced in 1934 for informal uniform wear. In 1946, ribbon bars were replaced by the current knot insignia.\nThe Silver Beaver was initially awarded only to men. The Silver Fawn Award, an equivalent for women, was awarded starting in 1971.  It used the same knot insignia, but on a blue background, as women were mostly involved in Cub Scouting during this period.  The Silver Fawn was discontinued and the Silver Beaver began to be awarded to women in 1974.  A total of 2,455 Silver Fawns were awarded to outstanding women for support of Cub Scouting before the award was discontinued in 1974.\nUsing the United States Military as the model, silver awards are the highest awards in Scouting America. Scouting America currently awards three silver awards, the Silver Beaver, the Silver Antelope and the Silver Buffalo.\nNotable recipients\n* Elliot Quincy Adams\n* Dean Alford\n* Thomas D.
