He has produced Midnight Oil, the The, Matthew Good Band, and Deacon Blue.\nLife and career\nWarne Livesey started his career in London, England as a musician and sound engineer, working with producers like David Lord and Rhett Davies. This led to early production work during London's expanding independent music scene in the early 1980s. In 1986, he teamed up with Matt Johnson to work on his the The album Infected. Livesey worked closely with Johnson on the record also contributing on bass and keyboards as well as arranging for strings. The album sold more than a million copies worldwide. He also worked on the follow-up album Mind Bomb in 1989. He produced Saint Julian (1987) by Julian Cope before going to Australia to work with Midnight Oil on their album Diesel and Dust, released in the same year. The record sold five million copies worldwide and in 2010 was named the best Australian album of all time. The opening track, \"Beds Are Burning\", was an international hit and is included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 songs that shaped Rock and Roll. Livesey went on to produce five more records with the band; Blue Sky Mining (1990), Redneck Wonderland (1998), Capricornia (2001), The Makarrata Project (2020), and their last album Resist (2022).\nDuring the 1990s he also produced: Paul Young, Jesus Jones, the Big Dish and House of Love, whose album Babe Rainbow (1992) he also co-wrote songs for. He also collaborated with Talk Talk frontman Mark Hollis, co-writing most of the songs on his only solo album.\nRelocation to Canada\nIn 1997 Livesey starting working with Canadian alternative rock artist the Matthew Good Band on their second album Underdogs.
