Gareth Davies, the Chief Executive of the Cleft Lip and Palate Association (CLAPA) wrote to BAFTA to express his \"serious disappointment\" at the incident and said that \"many people found the old-fashioned term \"harelip\" highly offensive and that \"making the condition the subject of a cheap joke was simply hurtful\"\nRivers later said that she was extremely sorry for any offence caused and this had certainly not been her intention. Amanda Berry, BAFTA Chief Executive, stated that the Academy would \"never set out to offend nor make fun of anyone\". CLAPA said they were pleased to receive the apologies but is also aware that too many people are still ill-informed about what cleft lip and palate is and what it is not. They added that this ignorance can often feed into prejudice and the media and those in the public eye have a key role in helping the association to de-stigmatise the condition.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
