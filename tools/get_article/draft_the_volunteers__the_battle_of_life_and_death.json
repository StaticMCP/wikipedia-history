The film series tells the story of the third to fifth battles of the Korean War, with the Iron Triangle being the highlight of the second film.\nPlot\nThe story of \"Volunteer Army: Battle of Survival\" revolves around the Iron Triangle Blocking Battle in the fifth battle of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. In May 1951, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the People's Army fought continuously for a month. The troops were exhausted and short of food and ammunition. Under the order of the Sino-Korean Joint Command, the main forces of each corps began to move north for rest. However, at the beginning of the transfer, the United Nations forces launched a large-scale counterattack, attempting to split the defense line of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the People's Army. In order to cover the transfer and rest of hundreds of thousands of volunteers, the 63rd Army was ordered to take the lead. 25,000 soldiers fought fiercely with nearly 50,000 \"United Nations forces\" in Iron Triangle. After 12 days and nights, they resisted several charges coordinated by the enemy's infantry, tanks and artillery. This battle completely shattered the enemy's conspiracy to destroy the Volunteer Army's rear base and eliminate the main force of the Volunteer Army, and played a vital role in stabilizing the situation on the Korean battlefield\nCast\nMain cast\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!actor\n!Role\n!Remark\n|-\n| Zhu Yilong\n| Li Xiang\n| Political Instructor of the 1st Battalion, 188th Division, 63rd Army of the Volunteer\n|-\n| Xin Baiqing\n| Li Moyin\n| Senior Staff Officer of the Volunteer Army Headquarters\n|-\n| Zhang Zifeng\n| Li Xiao\n| Translation Assistant of the Chinese Delegation to the United Nations\n|-\n| Zhu Yawen\n| Wu Benzheng\n| Returned military industry experts\n|-\n| Chen Feiyu\n| Sun Xing\n| Deputy Company Commander, 3rd Company, 1st Battalion, 335th Regiment, 112th Division, 38th Army of the Volunteer Army\n|-\n| Wang Yanhui\n| Peng Dehuai\n| Commander and Political Commissar of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army\n|-\n| Xiao Yang\n| Zhao Annan\n| Patriotic overseas Chinese, volunteer transport team driver\n|-\n| Wu Jing\n| Fu Chongbi\n| Commander of the 63rd Army of the Volunteer Army\n|-\n| Zhang Youhao\n| Yang Sandi\n| Radio operator at the headquarters of the 118th Division of the 40th Army of the Volunteer Army\n|-\n| Ou Hao\n| Zhang Xiaoheng\n| Military expert guard\n|-\n| Han Dongjun\n| Cai Changyuan\n| Commander of the 189th Division of the 63rd Army of the Volunteer Army\n|-\n| Guo Xiaodong\n| Solution\n| Chief of Staff of the Volunteer Army\n|-\n| Li Zhuoyang\n| Yang Chuanyu\n| Soldiers of the 3rd Company, 1st Battalion, 335th Regiment, 112th Division, 38th Army of the Volunteer Army\nheavy responsibility\n|-\n| Zhang Yinghui\n|\n| Commander of the 188th Division of the 63rd Army of the Volunteer Army\n|-\n| Li Naiwen\n| Han Xianchu\n| Deputy Commander of the Volunteer Army\n|-\n| Nie Yuan\n| Hong Xuezhi\n| Deputy Commander of the Volunteer Army\n|-\n| Tang Zeng\n| Yang Fengan\n| Military Secretary to Commander Peng Dehuai\n|-\n| Wang Ting\n| Deng Hua\n| Second Commander of the Volunteer Army\n|-\n| He Ziming\n| Lao Zheng\n| Commander of the 1st Battalion, 188th Division, 63rd Army of the Volunteer Army\n|-\n| Wang Yang\n| Long Daoquan\n| Political Commissar of the 63rd Army of the Volunteer Army\n|-\n| Jia Bing\n| Li Tao\n| Director of the Operations Department of the Central Military Commission\n|}\nProduction\nFilming on the series began on July 5, 2022, and concluded on August 8, 2023, lasting 399 days. Prior to filming, the 176-person cast underwent nearly three months of professional military action training. The film was initially conceived as a two-part series, but was ultimately decided upon as a trilogy.\nThe second film involved approximately 25,000 costumes, with the Volunteer Army uniforms alone weighing approximately 50,000 kilograms. The Cheorwon battlefield was the largest filming location in the \"Volunteer Army\" trilogy, covering approximately 200,000 square meters. The actual battlefield was even recreated using art sets within the studio. The Imjin River crossing during the Fifth Campaign is another key battle in the film. To prevent the fog from dispersing over the Imjin River, the crew constructed a studio set to contain the entire battlefield, effectively trapping the fog.\nRelease\nThe Volunteers was released in China on 28 September 2024, timed to coincide with the country's National Day on October 1.\nReception\nMainland China earned 1.196 billion yuan, making it the biggest winner of the National Day holiday.\nSequel\nThe second installment titled The Volunteers: Peace at Last was released on 30 September 2025.\nSee also\n*The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021) and The Battle at Lake Changjin II (2022), two Chinese films set during the Korean War and co-directed by Chen Kaige\nReferences\nExternal links"
