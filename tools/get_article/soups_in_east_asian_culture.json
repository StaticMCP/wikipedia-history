      "text": "# Soups in East Asian culture\n\nSoups in East Asian culture are eaten as one of the many main dishes in a meal or in some cases served straight with little adornment, particular attention is paid to the soups' stocks. In the case of some soups, the stock ingredients become part of the soup. They are usually based solely on broths and lacking in dairy products such as milk or cream. If thickened, the thickening usually consists of refined starches from corn or sweet potatoes.\nThe quality of a savoury soup is determined mainly by its fragrance and umami or \"xian\" flavour, as well as, to a lesser extent, its mouthfeel.  Many soups are eaten and drunk as much for their flavour as for their health benefits and touted for their purported revitalizing or invigorating effects.\nIn Chinese language, noodle soups are generally considered a noodle dish instead of a soup, as evidenced by the fact that they are called \"soup noodles\" (湯麵), with 'soup' being an adjective, in contrast with \"dry noodles\" (乾麵).\nCultural significance\nMany soups are consumed as a partial restorative and heavily linked with theories from traditional Chinese medicine. One such example is shark fin soup. There are many varieties of such tonic soups, ranging from pungent to light in flavour, and from savoury to sweet. Some soups of the same name may consist of different recipes due to regional preferences or differences. Such soups commonly contain one or more meats (typically pork or chicken), vegetables, and medicinal herbs.\nTraditional soup bases\nChinese\nA bowl of wonton noodle soup\nThere are several basic traditional soup stocks in Chinese cuisine:\n* (): A basic chicken broth that is used in creating most Chinese soups. This broth is sometimes fortified with liquorice root, red dates, wolfberry, and other Chinese herbs.\n* (): A lean pork broth, which is often used as the soup base for long-simmered Chinese soups (called  in Cantonese).  This soup base is often simmered over low heat for several hours with other roots, dried herbs, vegetables, and edible fungi like shiitake mushroom, white fungus, or wood ear.  The Cantonese are especially known for their long-simmered Chinese soups, as they often pair ingredients under Chinese medicine concepts to enhance purported health benefits of the soup.\n* (): Made from lightly blanched pork bones that have been vigorously boiled for several hours, creating a white milky broth. This broth has a rich mouthfeel and deep flavor.\n* (): Made from fish that have been fried and boiled for several hours, creating a white milky broth. This broth has a rich mouthfeel and sweet umami taste.\n* (): A broth made using the bones, meat offcuts, or skin of either pork, duck, or chicken. This broth is commonly used for simple flavouring of common dishes.\n*Refined broth/stocks:\n** (): A dark tan broth made from Jinhua ham, pork, and chicken that has been slowly simmered to finish. This rich and umami broth is used in the creation of many expensive soups such as shark fin soup or wonton soup.\n** (): A filtered white broth made through vigorous boiling of bones and chicken that has been clarified using pureed or finely minced chicken breast meat. Repeating the clarification and infusion process with more minced chicken produces a double-clarified broth ( ). The white broth can also be clarified using egg white or blood but the taste will not be optimal. Used in the Sichuan dish  ().\nIngredients used in making Chinese stocks can be recooked again to produce a thinner broth with less intense flavours, known as  ().\nJapanese\nCollectively known as dashi, most Japanese soup bases are flavoured primarily with kombu (kelp) and  shavings from dried skipjack tuna (katsuobushi). They are soaked or simmered to release the umami flavours of the shavings, and the resulting broth is strained. Mirin is occasionally added to the broth to further enhance the taste of the broth.\n*: Kelp () is soaked in lukewarm water or simmered to yield a light broth.\n*: made by soaking or boiling dried sardines () in water. The heads and entrails are usually pinched off prior to soaking, to prevent bitterness.\n*: made by soaking dried shiitake mushrooms in water.\nKorean\nKorean broth is collectively known as (K:  T: ). Although the literal definition is meaty water,  can be used to include broth made by vegetable equivalent. Each kinds of broth will be used for diverse range of Korean soup.\n* () is a clear broth made from boiling dried Korean anchovies.  (kelp) could be boiled together to enhance its flavour. It is most common type of broth that can be used for most of the simple Korean soup and noodle dishes.\n* ()means a clear broth from boiling meat, which could be beef, chicken, or pork. It is often used to replace the basic  to give more flavour.\n* () is a milky broth made from boiling bones for a long period of time. It is often used to make hearthy and meaty Korean soup such as  ().\n* () is a clear broth from Korean traditional kimchi, not boiled. Most of those kimchi broth used are those with less pepper powder. The typical example is from sliced Chinese radish called  (), which is often used to make cold noodle dishes.\nIndonesian\nwith tamarind-based soup]]\nIn Indonesian cuisine, there are many traditional soup bases to create kuah (soup or stock), acquired from vegetables, spices, meat or bones.\n*Santan is a rich and creamy thin white soup made from coconut milk. It is made by squeezing grated coconut flesh to acquire its oily juice. Thick coconut milk is usually used to make thicker sauce, while thin coconut milk are used to create soup. Sometimes turmeric is added to create golden-yellowish colour. Example of Indonesian traditional soups that employ coconut milk as a soup base are sayur lodeh and several variants of sotos.\n*Kuah asam is a light, fresh and sour thin soup made from asam  jawa (tamarind) juice. Example of soup employing tamarind is sayur asem, vegetables stew in tamarind soup.\n*Kuah cuka, another variant of sour-tasting soup that simply using vinegar instead of tamarind. Usually employed to create seafood soups.\n*Sayur bening literary means \"clear soup\", it is lightly seasoned only with small amount of garlic, shallot, and temu kunci. Example of clear vegetable soup is sayur bayam (spinach soup) and sayur oyong (okra soup).\n*Kaldu in Indonesian cuisine refer to broth or stock acquired from boiling meat and/or bones. The broth might be acquired from chicken, beef and mutton. Example of Indonesian soup that employ kaldu (meat broth) is sop buntut and bakso (meatball noodle soup).\nSoups\nThe soup bases are used to cook a large variety of soups\nAmerican Chinese cuisine\nIn American-Chinese restaurants some of the most popular soups are: egg drop soup, hot and sour soup, wonton soup, and chicken with corn soup.\nKorean\n*Yukgaejang (육개장) is a spicy red soup made with beef strips, red pepper, and assorted vegetables (usually green and white onions, bean sprouts, among others); many variations include egg and rice or cellophane noodles dropped into the soup, and sometimes shrimp and other pieces of seafood. Of the spicy Korean soups, 육개장 is very popular among both Koreans and non-Koreans.\n*Miyeok guk (미역국) is a soup made from boiled sliced beef and miyeok (popularized as wakame in Japanese). It is believed to be good for the blood vessels and heart. Koreans traditionally eat this for birthday celebrations, or when a woman gives birth to a child.\n*Tteok guk (떡국) is a soup made with slices of rice cake. The base is usually beef or anchovy (멸치) stock along with the rice cake slices, and most variations also have sliced green onions, eggs dropped into the soup, and are usually served with strips or pieces of laver (김; many variations will be baked or fried and salted/seasoned). 떡국 is traditionally served on the lunar New Year, but is a favourite during the colder months.\n*Doenjang jjigae (된장 찌개) is a bean paste soup base. Usually served with at least tofu and green onions, many variations include other ingredients (including various meats or fishes but usually not egg, potatoes, and other vegetables). Miso is a less-concentrated, much simpler version of 된장.\n*Sundubu jjigae (순두부 찌개) is a spicy red stew (not so much a soup) very similar in ingredients and preparation to 육개장, but has dropped tofu (i.e. not the firm kind, but uncurdled tofu, called sundubu in Korean) as a primary ingredient in addition to everything else, and will tend to favour seafood ingredients more heavily than meats. Usually served scalding hot and with the balance in favour of ingredients over fluid, 순두부 찌개 is also different from 육개장 in that the egg yolk is often placed in the soup intact (as opposed to the usual dropped egg technique in which the egg white and the egg yolk are broken up within the soup and thus cook within the soup in pieces, not as a single piece).\nIndonesian\n, Indonesian counterpart of chicken soup.]]\nIndonesian soups are known to be flavoursome with generous amount of bumbu spice mixture. Indonesian cuisine has a diverse variety of soups. Some Indonesian soups may be served as a separate whole meal, while others are lighter.\nGenerally Indonesian soups and stews are grouped into three major groups with numbers of variants in between.\n#Soto refer to variety of Indonesian traditionally spiced meat soups, either in clear broth or in rich coconut milk-base soup, example includes soto ayam.\n#Sayur refer to traditional vegetables stews, such as sayur asem.\n#Sop or sup usually refer to soups derived from western influences, such as sop buntut.\nNepalese\n*Kwāti is a mixed soup of nine types of sprouted beans—black gram, green gram, chickpea, field bean, soybean, field pea, garden pea, cowpea and rice bean.
