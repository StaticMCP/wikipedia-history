He enjoyed his first success at adult level when he was part of the Toomevera team that won the Tipperary IHC title in 1984. King later won three successive Tipperary SHC medals from 1992 to 1994. The second of these victories was later converted into a Munster Club SHC title, before later losing the 1994 All-Ireland club final to Sarsfields. King added further Tipperary SHC titles to his collection in 1998 and 1999, before ending his career back with the club's intermediate team.\nKing never played at minor or under-21 levels with Tipperary, however, his performances at club level resulted in a call-up to the senior team for the 1986 season. He was later dropped from the panel but earned a recall in 1994 and won a National League medal on the field of play that year. King made his only Munster SHC appearance in a defeat by Clare that season.\nIn retirement from playing, King became involved in team management and coaching. He has served as a selector at various times with the Toomevara senior team, including during the club's Tipperary SHC-winning season in 2004.\nHonours\nPlayer\n;Toomevara\n*Munster Senior Club Hurling Championship: 1993\n*Tipperary Senior Hurling Championship: 1992, 1993, 1994, 1998, 1999\n*North Tipperary Senior Hurling Championship: 1991, 1994, 1995, 1997, 1999\n*Tipperary Intermediate Hurling Championship: 1984\n*Tipperary Under-21 A Hurling Championship: 1985\n;Tipperary\n*National Hurling League: 1993–94\nManagement\n;Toomevara\n*Tipperary Senior Hurling Championship: 2004\nReferences\n}}"
