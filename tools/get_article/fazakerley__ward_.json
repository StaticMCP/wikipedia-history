Croxteth ward was represented by three councillors.\nThe report describes the boundaries as \"Commencing at a point where the eastern boundary of Warbreck Ward meets the northern boundary of the City, thence generally eastwards along said City boundary and southeastwards along the northeastern boundary of the City to Stonebridge Lane, thence southeastwards along said lane to East Lancashire Road, thence southwestwards along said road to the access way between East Lancashire Road and Sparrow Hall Road to the east of No 151 East Lancashire Road, thence northwestwards along said access way to Sparrow Hall Road, thence westwards along said road to Landford Avenue, thence southwestwards along said avenue to Waresley Crescent, thence generally northwestwards along said crescent to Studland Road, thence westwards along said road to Hursley Road, thence northwards along said road to Long Lane, thence southwestwards along said lane to the eastern boundary of Warbreck Ward, thence generally northwestwards along said boundary to the point of commencement\".\n2004 boundaries\nA review by the Boundary Committee for England recommended that the council was formed of a reduced number of 90 members elected from 30 wards.\nThe new ward retained the majority of the former ward, losing a small part to the new Norris Green ward and taking in parts of the former Gillmoss and Warbreck wards. The ward was part of the Liverpool Walton Parliamentary constituency.\nThe population of the ward at the 2021 Census was 16,374.\nThe ward was dissolved at the 2023 elections where it was distributed into the new Fazakerley East, Fazakerley North wards, Fazakerley West and a small part of the Walton ward.\nCouncillors\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Election!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor\n|-\n| 2004\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Dave Hanratty (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Steve Rotheram (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Jack Spriggs (Lab)\n|-\n| 2006\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Dave Hanratty (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Steve Rotheram (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Jack Spriggs (Lab)\n|-\n| 2007\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Dave Hanratty (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Steve Rotheram (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Jack Spriggs (Lab)\n|-\n| 2008\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Dave Hanratty (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Steve Rotheram (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Jack Spriggs (Lab)\n|-\n| 2010\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Dave Hanratty (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Steve Rotheram (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#FF8C00\"| Louise Ashton-Armstrong (Lab)\n|-\n| 2010\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Dave Hanratty (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Steve Rotheram (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Louise Ashton-Armstrong (Lab)\n|-\n| 2011\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Dave Hanratty (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Peter Clarke (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Louise Ashton-Armstrong (Lab)\n|-\n| 2012\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Dave Hanratty (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Peter Clarke (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Louise Ashton-Armstrong (Lab)\n|-\n| 2014\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Dave Hanratty (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Peter Clarke (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Louise Ashton-Armstrong (Lab)\n|-\n| 2015\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Dave Hanratty (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Peter Clarke (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#FF8C00\"| Paul Brant (Lab)\n|-\n| 2016\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Dave Hanratty (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Peter Clarke (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Paul Brant (Lab)\n|-\n| 2018\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Lindsay Melia (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Peter Clarke (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Paul Brant (Lab)\n|-\n| 2019\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Lindsay Melia (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Frazer Lake (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Paul Brant (Lab)\n|-\n| 2021\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Lindsay Melia (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Frazer Lake (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Paul Brant (Lab)\n|-\n| 2022\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#FF8C00\"| Helen Stephens (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Frazer Lake (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Paul Brant (Lab)\n|}\nindicates seat up for re-election after boundary changes.\nindicates seat up for re-election.\nindicates change in affiliation.\nindicates seat up for re-election after casual vacancy.\n*Cllr Jack Springs (Labour, 2008) died of pneumonia on 11 December 2009 aged 75.\n*Cllr Louise Ashton-Armstrong (Labour, 2012) resigned from the council in 2015.\n*Cllr Lindsay Melia (Labour, 2018) resigned from the council in 2022 after breaking the party whip to vote against the budget.\nElection results\nElections of the 2020s\n2022 by-election\n}}\n9.73\n}}\nN/A\n}}\n12.11\n}}\n5.71\n}}\n24.80\n}}\n3.90\n}}\n2.22\n}}\n2021\n}}\n9.83\n}}\n7.15\n}}\n0.58\n}}\n0.72\n}}\n1.39\n}}\n13.21\n}}\n2.59\n}}\n0.92\n}}\nElections of the 2010s\n2019\n}}\n6.06\n}}\n4.12\n}}\n0.17\n}}\n0.62\n}}\n1.45\n}}\n7.88\n}}\n1.49\n}}\n1.34\n}}\n2018\n}}\n10.46\n}}\n3.68\n}}\n0.54\n}}\n6.29\n}}\nN/A\n}}\n14.17\n}}\n2.67\n}}\n2016\n}}\n5.44\n}}\n7.37\n}}\n1.73\n}}\n0.82\n}}\n1.82\n}}\n8.37\n}}\n31.83\n}}\n2015\n}}\n8.35\n}}\n9.98\n}}\n2.06\n}}\n2.03\n}}\n1.38\n}}\n0.32\n}}\n18.33\n}}\n30.25\n}}\n2014\n}}\n2012\n}}\n2011\n}}\n2010\n}}\n2010 by-election\nFollowing the death of Councillor Jack Spriggs on 11 December 2009 a by election was held on 18 February 2010.\n}}\nElections of the 2000s\n}}\n}}\n}}\nAfter the boundary change of 2004 the whole of Liverpool City Council faced election.
