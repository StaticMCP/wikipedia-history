Mishcon reviewed Space Battle in The Space Gamer No. 28, commenting that \"I believe most gamer will set this aside - a nice try, but not really a challenge. The tactics are just too easily optimized.\" In Moves, the game was criticised for not holding long-term interest compared to other similar games.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.mobygames.com/game/153493/space-battle/ Space Battle] at MobyGames"
