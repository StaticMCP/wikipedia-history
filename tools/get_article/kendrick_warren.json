He averaged 27 points and 11 rebounds in his junior year and as a senior he averaged 26 points and 12 rebounds. One of the best forwards in his class, he was Richmond Player of the Year twice and at the end of his senior year he was selected in the Parade All-America fourth team and was named a McDonald's All-American. In the 1990 McDonald's All-American Boys Game he scored 4 points shooting 1 for 4 from the field and 2 for 2 from the free throw line.\nCollege career\nAlready during his junior year of high school Warren had expressed his will to play for Virginia Commonwealth University, and he committed to VCU in 1990, after his McDonald's All-American selection. His freshman season at VCU saw him leading the team in both scoring and rebounding, with respective averages of 15.7 and 8.5, was awarded the Sun Belt Freshman of the Year and was named in the All-Conference Team. His sophomore season was even more successful and was his best scoring season: he averaged 19.0 points per game, starting all of his 29 games, and was the 3rd best scorer of the 1991–92 Metro Conference tournament. The 1992–93 season saw Warren average 17.6 points and 9.1 rebounds, and VCU reached the Conference finals, where they were defeated by Louisville 90 to 78. Warren's senior season saw a significant improvement in his rebounding average, and he led the Metro Conference with 12.4 rebounds per game. He finished his career as VCU top scorer of all time with 1,858 points (his record has since been surpassed) and was second in career rebounds with 1,049 (the record belongs to Lorenza Watson with 1,143). In 2005 VCU retired his jersey number, 23.\nCollege statistics\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | 1990–91\n| align=\"left\" | VCU\n| 31 || 30 || 28.1 || 541. || .125 || .660 || 8.5 || 1.6 || 1.1 || 2.1 || 15.7\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | 1991–92\n| align=\"left\" | VCU\n| 29 || 29 || 33.8 || .543 || .000 || .508 || 9.5 || 2.1 || 1.4 || 1.5 || 19.0\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | 1992–93\n| align=\"left\" | VCU\n| 19 || 19 || 30.2 || .502 || .200 || .522 || 9.1 || 1.9 || 1.6 || 1.3 || 17.6\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | 1993–94\n| align=\"left\" | VCU\n| 27 || 27 || 32.9 || .533 || .500 || .477 || 12.4 || 2.0 || 1.5 || 2.2 || 18.0\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | Career\n| align=\"left\" |\n| 106 || 105 || 31.3 || .532 || .214 || .538 || 9.9 || 1.9 || 1.4 || 1.8 || 17.5\n|-\nProfessional career\nWarren became automatically eligible for the 1994 NBA draft after his senior year, but he was not selected by any of the NBA teams.
