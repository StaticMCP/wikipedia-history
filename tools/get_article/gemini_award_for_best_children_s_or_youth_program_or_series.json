In that year, a new award was created for Best Pre-School Program or Series, separating programming for toddlers and young children from programming for older children and teenagers. In 2002, the award was split into separate awards for Best Fiction Program or Series and Best Non-Fiction Program or Series, and the single award was no longer presented.\nWinners and Nominees\nWinners in bold.\nBest Children's Program\n1980s\n1986\n* The Kids of Degrassi Street: \"Griff Gets a Hand\" (CBC)\n* A Whole New Ball Game\n1987\n* Down at Fraggle Rock: Behind the Scenes (CBC)\n* Stone Fox (NBC)\n* The Conserving Kingdom (TVOntario)\n1988\n*  'They Look A Lot Like Us: A China Odyssey' (CBC)\nBest Children's Series\n1980s\n1986\n* Fraggle Rock (CBC)\n* OWL/TV (CBC)\n* Today's Special (TVOntario)\n* Wonderstruck (CBC)\n1987\n* Degrassi Junior High (CBC)\n* Fraggle Rock (CBC)\n* Spirit Bay (CBC and TVOntario)\n* What's New (CBC)\n1988\n* Ramona (CBC)\n* Mr. Dressup (CBC)\n* Today's Special (TVOntario)\n* What's New (CBC)\n* Wonderstruck (CBC)\nBest Children's Program or Series\n1980s\n1989\n* Mr. Dressup (CBC)\n* Bob Schneider & The Rainbow Kids in concert\n* Happy Castle (Global)\n1990s\n1990\n* Raffi in Concert with the Rise and Shine Band (CBC)\n* Dear Aunt Agnes (TVOntario)\n* Fred Penner's Place (CBC)\n* Under the Umbrella Tree (CBC)\n1992\n* The Garden (CTV)\n* Join In!
