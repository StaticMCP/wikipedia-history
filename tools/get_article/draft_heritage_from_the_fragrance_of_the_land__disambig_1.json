The museum presents Palestinian cultural heritage in an academic and humanistic manner. The museum is based on a family museum established by his great-grandmother, Dr. Hakima Aydi Tarabin, in the village of Ghazaleh in Palestine in 1790.\nThe museum houses more than 10,000 heritage pieces documenting Palestinian life before 1948, including 250 traditional dresses, jewellery, traditional medical instruments, documents, stamps, and old coins, in addition to a rare library and archives. The museum also is a research center open to researchers and students. It is linked to the Palestinian Academy of Museum Science, which seeks to establish Palestinian museology as an internationally recognized academic discipline. The museum represents a bridge between memory and identity, and a space that re-presents Palestine as a living part of the world's human heritage.\nOriginal museum\n\"Heritage From the Fragrance of the Land\" was established in 1790 in the village of Ghazaleh, north of Beersheba, Palestine, by the physician Hakima al-Aydi Tarabin (1775–1885). This museum was the first private Palestinian institution specializing in heritage preservation and one of the oldest family museums in the Arab world. Initially, the collections were displayed in a Bedouin tent, then moved with the physician during her medical visits, with Egyptian wooden crates used to store the collections. In 1884, the museum was recognized by the Ottoman Empire, granting official protection to Palestinian heritage and facilitating the documentation of the collections, strengthening its status as a collective cultural symbol reflecting Palestinian identity.\nMuseum philosophy and objectives\nThe museum was an embodiment of the concept of “a healthy mind in a healthy body,” and an extension of the philosophy of linking physical health with cultural heritage. The museum reflected this concept by combining medicine and popular memory, and aimed to:\n* Preserving memory and cultural identity by collecting the belongings of the deceased instead of burying them, which contributed to building community awareness of the importance of heritage.\n* Raising awareness among the Bedouin community about the importance of preserving their belongings as part of their identity, and changing traditional burial customs.\n* Documenting Palestinian folk life through the display of traditional clothing, popular medical tools, and everyday items, with the aim of passing on this heritage to future generations.\n* Serving the community by integrating medical and traditional knowledge, making the museum an interactive space between heritage and health.\nThe Nakba and its aftermath\nIn the 20th century, the museum faced significant challenges due to the Nakba of 1948, halting its activities for a period and closing its doors. It gradually returned to activity, especially in the diaspora. Between 1967 and 2000, what became known as \"Palestinian museology\" was born, an attempt to revive the lost cultural narrative. At the beginning of the millennium, Dr. Aydi Tarabin, the grandson of Dr. Hakim, embraced the idea of ​​expanding and developing the museum academically and internationally. He taught museology, and in 2022, he founded the Academy of Palestinian and Arab Museology in Paris.\nFamilial background\nHaikma Aydi Tarabin (1775–1885)\nThe story began in the Tarabin family with the physician Hakima, who studied medicine, specifically ophthalmology, at the Al-Mansur Qalawun Hospital in Cairo. She opened new horizons for the Palestinian Bedouin community with an innovative idea: collecting the belongings of the dead instead of burying them with them, creating a kind of living memory of Palestinian identity. Her philosophy was \"a sound mind in a sound body,\" linking physical health with the preservation of cultural heritage. She began by displaying the belongings in a Bedouin tent and then in Egyptian wooden boxes.\nIn 1884, the museum was recognized by the Ottoman Empire, giving Palestinian heritage official protection and helping to document its collections, strengthening its status as a collective cultural symbol reflecting Palestinian identity.\nDr. Halima Aydi Tarabin (1894–2014)\nHakima's granddaughter, born in the village of Ghazala, was a prominent physician who studied surgery in Constantinople in 1916. She was a pioneer in integrating modern medicine with Palestinian folk cultural heritage. She established a medical clinic alongside a museum, which she developed to reflect Palestinian identity, documenting artifacts related to the community and alternative medicine, such as costumes, plants, amulets, weapons, coins, and manuscripts. She prepared her grandson, \"Museum,\" to be the guardian of this cultural heritage, sending him to Russia, France, and Switzerland to study museology.\nAhmed Munif Aydi Tarabin\nHalima's cousin, a physician and medical activist, co-founded the Arab Medical Institute in Damascus (the nucleus of Damascus University) in 1918. He exchanged medical and cultural knowledge with Halima, and together they established a project to showcase Palestinian culture to the world by sending representatives to Europe.\nEuropean Foundation and the Paris Academy (2000-2022)\nIn 2000, the Academy of Palestinian and Arab Museology was founded in Paris by Dr. Aydi Tarabin, grandson of Dr. Hakima. The museum bears the name \"Museum\" as a family bequest and is known as the \"faithful guardian of Palestinian heritage.\" He played a pivotal role in re-establishing the \"Heritage of the Fragrant Soil\" Museum in 2022 in Paris, transforming it into a global cultural and academic institution to document Palestinian heritage scientifically and systematically, linking popular narratives with academic history. He is also working to expand the museum into a research and educational center that opens its doors to researchers and students from around the world, with a focus on the role of women in heritage preservation and raising awareness about Palestinian identity and heritage through exhibitions, books, and cultural projects. The museum forms a bridge between heritage and modernity, and between Palestine and the world.\nMuseum vision\nThe vision is that the museum is not merely a place to preserve objects, but rather a spiritual and cultural therapeutic space that fosters belonging. Its approach relies on women as \"keepers of memory\" and is based on popular documentation, feminist storytelling, and heritage therapy. It is a global cultural and academic platform that reflects Palestinian identity and its profound heritage, linking the past and present, and the collective and human memory.\nObjectives\nThe museum aims to preserve Palestinian heritage in all its historical, cultural, and social dimensions through:\n* Documenting Palestinian memory and preserving cultural heritage by displaying archaeological artifacts, traditional costumes, and rare historical documents.\n* Promote scientific research by establishing a research center open to researchers and students, and linking the museum with the Palestinian Academy of Museum Sciences.\n* Developing Palestinian museology as an internationally recognized academic discipline and integrating it into global educational programs.\n* Disseminating Palestinian culture globally through libraries, archives, and specialized publishing houses.\n* Building a bridge between the past and the present to enhance Palestinian national identity and heritage awareness among new generations.\n* Promoting international cultural dialogue through the museum’s membership in the International Council of Museums (ICOM) and cultural diplomacy activities.\nReferences"
