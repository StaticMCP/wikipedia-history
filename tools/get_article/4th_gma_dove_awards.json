The incident involved one of gospel music's premier groups, The Blackwood Brothers, who had captured nine out of fourteen awards. They were accused of having conducted an extensive campaign to enlist new members to the GMA and to encourage members to vote for particular award nominees in the Dove Award balloting. Though no specific bylaw of the organization had been broken, the tactic created an industrywide concern over \"voting irregularities and ethical ballot influence and solicitation.\"\nThe GMA Board voted to nullify the entire process, thereby invalidating all the awards that had been presented at the October 8, 1971, banquet held in Nashville. Also, a committee was formed to adjust the voting process with \"safeguards to prevent any future irregularities in Dove Awards balloting.\"  James Blackwood issued a statement in support of the organization's decision and strongly urged all other participants in the Dove Awards to subscribe and adhere to the code of ethics to be set forth by the Gospel Music Association.\nCompilation album\nCanaan Records of Waco, Texas, issued a long play album of nominated recordings titled ''The Gospel Music Association's Dove Awards Nominations for the Gospel Song of 1972 (CAS-9732-LP Stereo).
