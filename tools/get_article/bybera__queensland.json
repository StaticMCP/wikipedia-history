Hirschfeld had been a member of the Queensland Legislative Council and the Queensland Medical Board before he was interned and then later exiled for being German during World War I. He was not allowed  to return to Australia after the war, until General Sir John Monash personally campaigned for his return. When Hirschfeld finally returned to Australia in 1927, he purchased pastoral properties in the Inglewood and Yelarbon areas, where  he experimented with pasture improvement. He also researched the potential of Australian native vegetables, especially in relation to Aboriginal nutrition. On 18 June 1946, he died at this property Bybera and was buried there.\nDemographics\nIn the , Bybera had a population of 3 people.\nIn the , Bybera had \"no people or a very low population\".\nEducation\nThere are no schools at Bybera. The nearest government primary schools are Inglewood State School in neighbouring Inglewood to south-east and Yelarbon State School in Yelarbon to the south. The nearest government secondary school is Inglewood State School (to Year 10) but students in the north-west of the locality may be too distant to attend this school.
