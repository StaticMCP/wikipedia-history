Presented to a film judged as the best film by an emerging director within the festival's Dragons and Tigers program for Asian cinema, it awarded a creative and innovative film, made early in the director's career, which had not yet won significant international recognition.\nFirst created in 1994, the award was discontinued after 2013. It was replaced with a general Best New Director Award, open to all emerging international filmmakers with films screening in any festival program.\nNominated films were selected by film scholar and critic Tony Rayns.\nAward winners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
