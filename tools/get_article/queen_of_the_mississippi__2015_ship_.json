She entered service in spring 2015 and was built by Chesapeake Shipbuilding in Salisbury, Maryland for overnight river cruising within the continental United States. The vessel accommodates 150 passengers in her 84 staterooms.\nThe vessel is a sister ship to American Pride, which originally carried the Queen of the Mississippi name from 2012 to 2015 (before it was repositioned to the Columbia & Snake Rivers).  There are some differences between the riverboats, like internal arrangement and cabins on the 5th deck.  However, both riverboats feature all outward-facing accommodations with private baths, and many cabins also have private furnished balconies. Both Paddlewheels (Queen of the Mississippi now American Heritage, and American Pride) were completely revovated in 2022.\nThe ship deck plans:\n* 1st Deck - double- and single-occupancy staterooms; dining room\n* 2nd Deck - double- and single-occupancy staterooms, all with private balconies; three lounges\n* 3rd Deck - owners suites, double- and single-occupancy staterooms, all with sliding doors to private balconies; library\n* 4th Deck - owners suites, double- and single-occupancy staterooms, all with sliding doors to private balconies; two lounges\n* 5th Deck - Pilot house, double- and single-occupancy staterooms, promenade, shaded public area, sundeck, putting green\nHer stern-mounted paddlewheel is driven by a hydraulic motor, powered by diesel engines. This is augmented by two Z-drive units to provide a higher cruising speed and better maneuverability.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.americancruiselines.com/small-riverboat-cruise-ships/queen-of-the-mississippi Official website]"
