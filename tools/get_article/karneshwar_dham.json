Karneshwar is located in Karon in the Deoghar district of the state of Jharkhand, India. It is a temple complex consisting of the main temple of Baba Karneshwar, where the Shivalinga is installed, and 27 other temples.\nAccording to Hindu beliefs, Karna who was the then ruler of Karon which comes under Angadesh , was a devotee of Shiva and thus he installed a Shivalinga at the current site of the temple to worship Shiva, his lord. As it is believed that the temple is built by King Karna, so from this aspect the temple derives its name.\nReferences"
