In 1452, Jahan Shah conquered Iran, occupied part of the Fars province, and made his son Pir Budaq the ruler of Isfahan. Pirbudag attacked Iran and captured Shiraz and Kerman. This time, at the end of 1453, Jahan Shah appointed Pir Budaq the ruler of Iran. Pir Budaq continued his campaigns. In 1457, Jahan Shah marched with his army to Khorasan. In 1458, he captured the Timurid capital of Herat and sat on the Timurid throne for 6 months. However, he heard news of the rebellion and returned to suppress the rebellion in 1459, signing the Treaty of Herat.\nBackground\nThe Timurids, who were expelled from Azerbaijan during the reign of Qara Yusuf, recaptured some of these territories after his death. As a result of the campaigns of Shah Rukh, Jahan Shah defeated his brother and became the new ruler of the Qara Qoyunlu. During this period, the state was dependent on Shah Rukh. However, after Shah Rukh's death in 1447, Jahan Shah began to rule independently, marched on the Timurids, and gained territory for himself. However, his son Pir Budaq Khan played an important role in the battles. He was even nicknamed \"Abul Fath\". Together with him, the Qara Qoyunlu aimed to conquer Iran and Khorasan.\nTimeline\nBattle of Qasr-i Zard and conquest of Isfahan\nPir Budaq advanced toward Isfahan. Upon hearing of his approach, the people of Isfahan declared their allegiance to him. At the same time, Qasem Babur, who was unwilling to give up control of the city, marched to Isfahan with a 10,000 soldiers. Among his commanders were Alvand Mirza, son of Qara Iskandar, Ata Hasan of Karkin, Hasan of Jilbiri, and Shaykh Haji Pahlavan Hussein Divani. They settled along the banks of the Zenderud River and received support from the local population.\nHowever, the people of Isfahan were discontent with Babur’s rule and the oppression of his men. They believed that the army of Jahan Shah would soon defeat the Timurid forces and began to await his arrival for liberation. When the Timurid commanders heard that Jahan Shah’s army was nearing the city, they unexpectedly abandoned their camp early the next morning.\nMeanwhile, Hussein Divan and Haji Qiyas al-Din also joined the people of Isfahan. Despite being unable to gather sufficient support, the Timurid ruler Qasim Babur entered the city. In the fierce battle that followed between the Qara Qoyunlu and the Timurids, Mirza Qasim Babur was defeated and fled to Khorasan.\nPirbudagh then marched to Shiraz, which surrendered without resistance. In 1454, under Pirbudagh’s command, the Qara Qoyunlu forces captured Yazd.\nBattle of Lavar pass and conquest of Kerman\nThe Timurid prince Sanjar Mirza was stationed at the Lavar Pass, where he had made prior preparations for battle. A courageous and agile young man, Ali Hakkak Isfahani, organized and led a unit of infantry. He directed his force toward the mountain slope where the Chagatai families and their belongings had been sheltered. Upon reaching the site, he began looting and pillaging, causing panic among the Timurid soldiers.\nIn response, many of the Timurids abandoned their positions and rushed back to protect their families and possessions. In the ensuing battle at the Lavar Pass, the Qara Qoyunlu forces killed around 3,000 Timurid soldiers and achieved a decisive victory. Sanjar Mirza fled the battlefield, and as a result, Kerman captured by Pir Budaq.\nKhorasan campaign and Fall of Herat\nIn 1457, following the death of Babur Mirza, the ruler of Khorasan, Jahan Shah took advantage of the ensuing internal strife and advanced into eastern Iran. He moved toward the Caspian coast, capturing Mazandaran and Astarabad. From Astarabad, he launched a campaign into Khorasan, seizing Nishapur and Mashhad. On June 28, 1458, he ascended the throne once held by the Timurid ruler Shahrokh.\nAs a result, foreign envoys arrived in Herat to greet him and present gifts and tributes. Jahan Shah remained in Herat for six months. However, in 1459, the outbreak of a rebellion by Hasan Ali led to a peace agreement. Later, Hasan Ali was imprisoned for his betrayal.\nTreaty of Herat (1459)\nJahan Shah concluded a peace treaty with Abu Sa’id, conceding Khorasan to the Timurids, while the remaining territories remained under Qara Qoyunlu control. In doing so, Jahan Shah secured significant territorial gains for his state. At the same time, the decline of the Timurid dynasty accelerated.\nReferences\n# Nəcəfli T. H.
