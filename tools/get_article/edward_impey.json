Between October 2013 and January 2022 he was Master of the Armouries and Director General of the Royal Armouries.\nEarly life and education\nImpey was born on 28 May 1962 to Oliver Impey and Jane Mellanby. His father was a zoologist by training who became specialist in Japanese art, and his mother was a neuroscientist. His grandfather Kenneth Mellanby was a biochemist. He grew up in the City of Oxford where his father was a curator at the Ashmolean Museum. He was educated at the Dragon School, a preparatory school in Oxford, and at Bedales School, a private school near Petersfield, Hampshire.\nImpey has degrees in history and archaeology.
