The war began on 13 June 2025, when Israel attacked targets at more than a dozen locations across Iran. Under the codename Operation Rising Lion,.}} the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Mossad attacked key nuclear sites, military installations, and residential areas, including targeted assassinations of military and civilian personnel, many of whom were killed in their homes or in meetings. Beginning on the evening of 13 June, Iran initiated retaliatory strikes against Israel, under the codename Operation True Promise III.}} The operation consisted of ballistic missiles and drones targeting military sites, intelligence sites, and residential areas. Iran also threatened to target American, British, and French military bases if they provided assistance to Israel. On 22 June, the United States conducted Operation Midnight Hammer, which involved airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities. Iran responded by attacking U.S. bases in Iraq and Qatar as part of Operation Glad Tidings of Victory.\nOperation Rising Lion\nNuclear facilities\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable style=\"float:center; margin-left: 1em;\"\n|+ Operation Rising Lion attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities\n|-\n!Airstrike target\n!Damage information\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"background-color:#DDFFDD \" ; |Natanz Nuclear Facility\n|The Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant (PFEP), a multi-story enrichment hall with thousands of advanced gas centrifuges used to produce 60% enriched uranium, was destroyed with at least three explosive impacts visible in satellite imagery.
