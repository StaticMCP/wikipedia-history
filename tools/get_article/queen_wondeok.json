She became queen consort through her marriage to her cousin once removed, King Gangjong, becoming his second wife She then changed her initial clan and became the mother of his only successor, King Gojong. Gangjong was her close relative in the maternal line, but very distant in the paternal line.\nAt one time, she was the second-in-command in the inner list of the main palace, but was dethroned and came back as a queen consort and queen dowager (first-in-command). Due to the war, her husband was exiled and they hid in Ganghwa Island. She is recognised for her dynamic life.\nBiography\nHer father-in-law, King Myeongjong was her mother's brother. So, both she and her husband were first cousins and related by blood to King Sukjong and Queen Myeongui.\nMarriage\nShe married Crown Prince Wang O in 1175, a year after his first wife's removal, becoming his second wife. In 1192, after 17 years of marriage, they had a son, Wang Jin (the future Gojong, King Anhyo the Great).\nHowever, in 1197, her father-in-law, King Myeongjong was deposed and imprisoned in Changrak Palace by Ch'oe Ch'ung-hŏn and Choe Chung-su. As a result, her husband, as prince, was also dethroned, and she accompanied him in exile to Ganghwa Island. Myeongjong's throne went to his youngest brother, the 53-year-old Wang T'ak. After Wang-Tak's death, the throne was passed to his son, Wang Yŏng.\nLife as Queen consort\nIn 1212, 14 years after their initial exile, her 60-year-old husband ascended the throne, after Huijong was defeated by the two Choe brothers. She formally became Queen Consort and was given the royal title of Princess Yeondeok (), and once again resided in the palace of Manwoldae.\nIt seems that she raised Princess Suryeong, the daughter from her husband's marriage to his first wife. When Princess Suryeong married, she dedicated a tribute to Yeondeok, thanking her for her care.\nThe Queen was said to have virtue and beauty. One year later, her husband fell ill and died.\nLife as Queen mother\nHer husband was succeeded by their only son, to which she later became a queen dowager (). Although the date she formally became a queen dowager was unknown, but in 1215, both she and King Gojong stayed in Western Cheongju Palace () for a while. From this time, she was called as Grand Queen Mother (), but in 1216, her mother died. In order to mourn his maternal grandmother, Gojong was said to wore a So-bok () for three days after her death.\nIn 1218, her son married a relative and one year later, their eldest son and child, Wang Jeon was born. In 1220, her brother, Marquess Yeongin died. In 1232, she left Sangdo () and moved to Gangdo () while her daughter-in-law died that same year. Three years later, Wang Jeon married and in 1236, his eldest son, Wang Sim was born.\nLater life and death\nMeanwhile, the queen mother later died around the age of 77 or 78 years old in 1239 after lonely life for more than 20 years, which she became one of the few longest-living Goryeo queens. She then buried in Golleung Tomb () which nowadays became the \"Historic Site No. 371\". Also received her posthumous name of Jeonggang () under Gojong's command in 1253.\nAncestors\nIn popular culture\n* Portrayed by Jo Yang-ja in the 2003–2004 KBS TV series Age of Warriors.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Item/E0040631 Queen Wondeok] on the Encyclopedia of Korean Culture .\n*[https://www.doopedia.co.kr/mo/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view2&MAS_IDX=101013001002058 원덕태후] on Doosan Encyclopedia ."
