The Shirenzigou culture is sometimes considered as the easternmost expansion of the Pazyryk culture. Beads were also imported from China.\nLooking at the archaeological and genetic evidence, the region has been suggested as an area of origin for the Yuezhi: the Yuegongtai-Xiheigou (岳公台-西黑沟) archaeological sites, corresponding to the Barkol culture in the Barkol County of Xinjiang. This would have positioned the Yuezhi between the Subeshi culture to their west, the Yanbulaq culture to their east, the aftermaths of the Chemurchek culture to the north, and a wide desertical area to south about a thousand kilometers away from the Central Plains of China.\nGenetics\nGenetic studies on Iron Age individuals of the Shirenzigou site dated to circa 200 BCE have shown a fairly balanced admixture between the West Eurasian and East Eurasian genetic pools. The West Eurasian component was Yamnaya-related, while the East Eurasian component was Northeast Asian-related. The Yamnaya component suggests a strong probability that the Shirenzigou populations were derived from the Afanasievo culture to the north, and spoke an Indo-European language. This reinforces an Afanasievo origin hypothesis for the Tocharians, often called the \"Steppe hypothesis\", rather than a hypothesis favouring BMAC and Andronovo culture origins, the \"Bactrian Oasis hypothesis\".\nThe four extracted Y-DNA belonged to the following haplogroups: Q1a1a1, Q1a1b and R1b1a1a2 (two samples). The samples of mtDNA extracted belonged to haplogroups U4’9, T1a1b, I1b, U4, G3b, H15b1, U5b2c, U5a2, D4j1b, A17.\nFile:Shirenzigou map.png|Shirenzigou map\nFile:Shirenzigou site with dwellings (yellow circles) and tombs (purple triangles).jpg|Shirenzigou site with dwellings (yellow circles) and tombs (purple triangles)\nFile:Shirenzigou panorama.png|Surroundings of the Shirenzigou archaeological site in Barkol County\nFile:Shirenzigou bone arrowhead.png|Shirenzigou bone arrowheads\nFile:Shirenzigou dwelling (from the North).jpg|Shirenzigou dwelling F2 (from the North)\nFile:Shirenzigou dwelling F2, with artifacts.png|Shirenzigou dwelling F2, with artifacts\nFile:Principal component analysis (PCA) based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroup frequencies of ancient and present-day Eurasian populations.png|Principal component analysis (PCA) based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroup frequencies of ancient and present-day Eurasian populations, with Shirenzigou samples\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nReferences"
