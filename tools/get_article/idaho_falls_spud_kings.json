The Spud Kings play their home games at Mountain America Center in Idaho Falls, Idaho.\nHistory\nThe Idaho Falls Spud Kings were born when the USPHL approved the addition of a Tier III expansion team that would play out of the Mountain America Center on March 30, 2022. Just a few months later, before the team had even hit the ice for its first game, the USPHL announced that it would be promoting its entire Mountain Division to Tier II. The Spud Kings lone season at the Tier III (Premier Division) level was predictable poor but, due to the expansive nature of the playoff system, they still managed to play their first postseason games, even managing to win their first round series.\nOnce the team joined the National Collegiate Development Conference, they showed steady improvement but the shot to the top in their third season. Idaho Falls won its first division title that year and then sloughed through the playoff until were the last team remaining. The Spud Kings downed the regular season champions, South Shore Kings, in the final to capture their first league championship.\nSeason-by-season records\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!
