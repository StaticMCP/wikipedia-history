The prize winner receives a monetary award and will complete a lecture tour within the UK. The winner is chosen by the awards committee of the Royal Society of Chemistry's organic division.\nAward history\nThe award was established by the Royal Society of Chemistry in 1979 following Wilfred Hickinbottom's bequest. Hickinbottom was noted for supporting high standards in experimental chemistry.\nPart of the monetary award is the Briggs scholarship, which was funded following a bequest from Lady Alice Lilian Thorpe, William Briggs' daughter.\nPrevious recipients\nThe award was first granted in 1981 to Steven Ley and Jeremy Sanders.\nSubsequent recipients include:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
