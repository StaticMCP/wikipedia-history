The colorful glass-mosaic globes known today as the Turkish mosaic lamp are modern craft adaptations of Ottoman–Turkish glassmaking and stained-glass traditions. The Morocco lamp is a separate tradition, characterized by pierced brass or copper bodies and colored glass panels, rooted in Maghrebi metalwork.\nHistorical Background\nOttoman Glass and Lighting\nFrom the 17th century onward, Ottoman workshops produced everyday glassware alongside oil lamps. By the 19th century, Beykoz glass had become distinctive. In architecture, colored-glass windows set into plaster, known as revzen-i menkuş, were common in mosques and palaces instead of leaded Gothic-style stained glass.\nMamluk Mosque Lamps\nIn the medieval Islamic world, hanging mosque lamps made of glass, decorated with enamel and gilding, reached their height of production during the 13th–14th century Mamluk period. These objects gained attention among European collectors in the 19th century, and many reproductions were made. Mamluk mosque lamps are technically distinct from the modern “mosaic” lamps sold today.\nTurkish Mosaic Lamp (Contemporary Craft)\nToday’s Turkish mosaic lamps are created by applying cut pieces of colored glass onto a spherical glass globe in geometric or arabesque patterns. This style emerged as a modern craft form in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, influenced by Ottoman–Turkish glass traditions and the use of colored glass in architecture.\nMorocco Lamp (Separate Tradition)\nThe Morocco lamp is recognized for its pierced brass or copper body, openwork patterns, and inserted colored-glass panels. It originates from Moroccan/Maghrebi metalworking traditions and differs in form and technique from Turkish mosaic lamps.\nPresent-Day Production and Global Spread\nThis craft is maintained through workshop-based teaching in Turkey and internationally. In the United States, Pedalisa Art () offers traditional Turkish mosaic lamp workshops, contributing to the preservation and promotion of this cultural heritage.\nTerminology and Distinctions\n* Historic: Mamluk enameled glass mosque lamps (13th–14th centuries)\n* Ottoman practice: Oil lamps, Beykoz glass, revzen-i menkuş windows in architecture\n* Contemporary market: Turkish mosaic lamp (glass-mosaic globes), Morocco lamp (pierced brass/copper + glass panels)\nReferences\nReferences"
