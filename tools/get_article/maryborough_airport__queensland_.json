It serves as a small regional airport serving Maryborough and nearby townships. However, increasing competition with Hervey Bay Airport has led to a decrease in commercial air traffic.\nThe airport is primarily used by the Maryborough Aero Club, a flight school and (in development) an aviation museum.\nThe airport was used by the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II; the buildings constructed for the RAAF are now listed on the Queensland Heritage Register.\nSee also\n* List of airports in Queensland\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
