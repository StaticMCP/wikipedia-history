      "text": "# Presidential parliamentary republic\n\nA parliamentary republic with an executive president or presidential parliamentary republic, is a form of parliamentary democracy in which the executive derives its democratic legitimacy from its ability to command the confidence of the legislature to which it is held accountable, but is characterized by a combined head of state–head of government in the form of an executive president who carries out both functions. This is in contrast to conventional parliamentary systems (be it in a monarchy or a republic) where the executive is separate from the head of state, and a presidential system where the executive is separate from the legislature. The president is typically elected by the legislature and must maintain its confidence to remain in office, for which purpose they may be required to hold a seat.\nThis method of presidential election is distinct from an assembly-independent republic, in which either the combined head of state and government (as in the Federated States of Micronesia) or the directorial executive (as in Switzerland) are elected by the legislature but are not accountable to it. It is also distinct from the semi-presidential system (in particular, the 'president-parliamentary' variant), in which the president as head of state is independent of the legislature, while the head of government is subject to parliamentary confidence.\nNational level\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
