The battle started as the forces of Doti attacked from the east and the Garhwal army invaded from the west, forcing Kumaon to fight a two-front war. The war lasted for months, and the defending Kumaoni army under King Udyot Chand emerged victorious; the invaders retreated. After the victory, Udyot Chand went to on a thanksgiving pilgrimage. Seeing the absence of King Udyot Chand, Deopal of Doti attacked the Kumaon again through Kali Kumaon but was repulsed by Kumaon garrison, and Kumaonis chased the Doti army back to their capital and captured it. A peace agreement was made, and Doti agreed to give annual taxes to the Kumaon Kingdom.\nReferences"
