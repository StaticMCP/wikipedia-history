Thanks to voice recognition, the system listens to the dialogue and positions the text in the appropriate place on the tape.\nThis new technique facilitated the adaptation of a film or a program in a foreign language.

DubStudio integrated a voice recognition device developed by the \"Centre de recherche en informatique de Montréal\" (English: Montreal Computer Research Center) (CRIM), in close collaboration with the designers of DubStudio, for the needs of post-synchronization.\nSee also\n*Arden R.
