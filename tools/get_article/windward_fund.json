The Windward Fund serves as the fiscal sponsor for various left-leaning political projects. The Windward Fund had over $158 million in revenue in 2020.\nIn October 2023, after a Washington Examiner investigation revealed that the New Venture Fund and the Windward Fund had given $473,000 between 2020 and 2021 to the Alliance for Global Justice, a group with Palestinian terrorism ties, the New Venture Fund and Windward Fund announced they would discontinue funding of the group.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/windward-fund/ The Windward Fund at InfluenceWatch]\n* [https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/473522162 The Windward Fund at ProPublica]"
