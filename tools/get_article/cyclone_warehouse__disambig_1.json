It was known for hosting eclectic events, and formerly served as headquarters to a loose collective of artists and artisans.\nThe space was founded in 1992 by Troy Shelton, Nicolas Desbons, Todd Martinez, Dan Hersey, Mark Reitman, Jason Price and Geordie Stevens, a group of students from CCAC and SFSU.  They built the space primarily from found materials.\nNeighbors\nThe space was one of 15 bays in a larger warehouse - a mix of artists studios and small business workshops. Some of those neighbors have been \"The Cave\" (a rock venue in the 1990s run by Beky Bonk), Phase (seminal noise venue), Seemen (robotics artist), Ovarian Trolley (on Candy Ass Records), Who's on Third Studios, The Lodge, and Bay Area Metals (recycling center).\nHosted artists\nCyclone Warehouse hosted a long list of memorable events.
