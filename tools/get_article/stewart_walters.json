He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm leg break bowler.\nCricket career\nEarly career\nWalters played his early cricket for Midland-Guildford in the Western Australian Grade Cricket competition. He played under-age and second XI cricket for Western Australia before concentrating on county cricket in England.  He also played seven games of Australian rules football for Swan Districts in the West Australian Football League.\nSurrey\nWalters played in the 2006 Twenty20 Cup competition for his team, Surrey, though he averaged just 7 runs through the competition. He also played three games in the 2006 County Championship, debuting with a sturdy innings of 41, comprising ten boundaries and one single, from third in the batting order.\nSince the opening of the 2007 season, Walters has played several non-Championship matches for the Surrey team, including various Second XI fixtures.\nHe played in the County Championship game against Essex in July 2009, making his highest first-class score of 111*. Walters is a middle-order batsman and occasional bowler. When Mark Butcher had to miss games because of his knee injury, and then announced his retirement with immediate effect in August 2009, Walters took over the captaincy on a short-term basis.\nGlamorgan\nIn February 2011, Walters left Surrey to seek pastures new and joined Glamorgan signing a two-year contract. He signed a one-year extension to his contract in September 2012 after scoring Glamorgan's highest individual score of the 2012 season in the County Championship with 159 against Essex at Colchester and was their leading fielder with 13 catches. He was not re-engaged following the 2014 season.\nCareer best performances\nas of 11 November 2014\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"1\"|\n!colspan=\"4\" rowspan=\"1\"|Batting\n!colspan=\"4\" rowspan=\"1\"|Bowling\n|-\n!\n!Score\n!Fixture\n!Venue\n!Season\n!Score\n!Fixture\n!Venue\n!Season\n|-\n|FC\n|align=\"center\"|188\n|Surrey v Leicestershire\n|The Oval\n|align=\"center\"|2009\n|align=\"center\"|1–4\n|Surrey v Durham\n|Chester-le-Street\n|align=\"center\"|2007\n|-\n|LA\n|align=\"center\"|91\n|Surrey Brown Caps v Northamptonshire Steelbacks\n|The Oval\n|align=\"center\"|2008\n|align=\"center\"|1–12\n|Surrey Brown Caps v Yorkshire Phoenix\n|Scarborough\n|align=\"center\"|2007\n|-\n|T20\n|align=\"center\"|53*\n|Surrey Lions v Glamorgan Dragons\n|Cardiff\n|align=\"center\"|2010\n|align=\"center\"|1–9\n|Surrey Brown Caps v Sussex Sharks\n|Hove\n|align=\"center\"|2009\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://cricketarchive.com/Players/64/64529/64529.html Cricket Archive profile]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d4ywWwvMXU Walters discussing impact of floodlights]\n*"
