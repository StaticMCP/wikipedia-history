It was once the most financially successful of all the clubs in England, with over 1,300 members in 1904.\n.]]\nWorking men's clubs provided a framework for  members to engage in a range of political, educational, or recreational activities.\nDespite the original educational ambitions, most working men's clubs are now mainly recreational. Typically, a club would have a room, often referred to (especially in Northern England) as a vault, with a bar for the sale and consumption of alcohol, snooker, pool or bar billiards tables, as well as televisions for sport entertainment; many provide food. A much larger room would be connected, often called the concert or entertainment room, with a stage and a layout of tables, stools and backrest sofas. They often provide night time entertainment, mainly at the weekends such as bingo, raffles, live music cabaret and comedy, playing  popular music. They are also known for their charitable works.\nDeclining membership has seen many clubs close down and others struggle to remain open.\nworking men's club, West Yorkshire]]\nMembership and structure\nWorking men's clubs are cooperatives run by their members through a committee, usually elected annually. Each club has rules that tend to be vigorously enforced. The committee will discipline members (common punishments being a warning, or a ban for a period) for violations. Despite the name, women are allowed to be members in many clubs, and virtually all clubs allow entry to women. Non-members are not allowed entry unless signed in by a member.\nIn the UK they are registered as co-operatives under the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014, normally using model rules supplied by the Clubs and Institutes Union.\nA dispute at Wakefield City Workingmen's Club in 1978 led to a national campaign for equal membership rights for women. Sheila Capstick, whose husband was an activist in the National Union of Mineworkers, had been a regular snooker player at the club before a ban was instituted on women playing snooker. Her protest, ''A Woman's Right to Cues, developed into a nationwide campaign for equal rights: ERICCA – Equal Rights in Clubs Campaign for Action''.  In April 2007, after the resolution had been consistently rejected over years, the Club and Institutes Union accepted equal membership rights for women.\nClub and Institute Union\nMost clubs affiliate to the Working Men's Club and Institute Union (commonly known as the CIU or C&IU).  The CIU is affiliated to the Committee of Registered Clubs Associations. A member of one affiliated club is entitled to use the facilities of other clubs. There were 2,200 affiliated working men's clubs in the UK as of 2010. There are 1,175 as of 2024.\nThe CIU has two purposes: to provide a national voice  for clubs, and to provide discounted products and services for clubs.\nBrewery\nUntil 2004, clubs ran a brewery at Dunston, Tyne and Wear, which brewed ales and lagers under the Federation brand. The brewery and brands were sold to Scottish & Newcastle for £16.2 million, although CIU clubs still receive discounted beer.\nImpact of 2007 smoking ban\nA poll by the British Institute of Innkeeping and the Federation of Licensed Victuallers Associations found that overall revenue was 7.3 per cent down as more men opted to drink at home, where they could also smoke.\nSee also\n* Association of Conservative Clubs\n* National Union of Labour and Socialist Clubs\n* Men's shed\n* Hackerspace\n* Mechanics' Institutes\n* Women's Institutes\n* YMCA\n* YWCA\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.clubhistorians.co.uk/clubsfactfile/ Club Historians website]"
