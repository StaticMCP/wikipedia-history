He had been away from the music scene for some time and the album marked his return to music. It was also a blues award nominee.\nBackground\nAfter retiring at 55, he recorded the album which was released on Evidence 26084 in 1997.\nThe album includes covers of \"Black Bag Blues\" which is a Lester Butler song and \"Better Days\" which was written by Mick Jagger and Jimmy Rip, which is an Otis Redding styled ballad. Charlie Musselwhite's \"Long As I Have You\" and Hound Dog Taylor's \"Sadie\" are also covered. Other compositions are by Ernest Baker, Andy Kaulkin and Randy Chortkoff. Lester Butler, Jimmy Rip, and East Hampton guitarist, Zach Zunis are among the musicians that played on the album.\nIn a review of the album, Nicky Baxter of Metroactive noted the ease that King Ernest had in going from blues to soul and back again. The only low point was some obtrusive piano pounding.\nIt was nominated in for a W. C. Handy Award in 1998. There were two categories. One was in Soul/Blues Album of the Year category and the other was in the Comeback Blues Album of the Year category.\nBakers follow-up album was in 2000 with Blues Got Soul.\nAlbum details\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+ Tracks\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | #\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Composer\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |Time\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1\n| \"I Resign\"\n| Ernest Baker\n| 4:48\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2\n| \"I'm Not The Only One\"\n| Andy Kaulkin\n| 3:44\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3\n| \"In The Dark\"\n| Junior Parker\n| 4:08\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 4\n| \"Black Bag Blues\"\n| Lester Butler\n| 4:27\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 5\n| \"Better Days\"\n| Mick Jagger - Jimmy Rip\n| 4:39\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 6\n| \"Long As I Have You\"\n| Charlie Musselwhite\n|  6:16\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 7\n| \"Tell Me What's The Reason\"\n| Florence Cadrey\n| 3:52\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 8\n| \"Cryin' For My Baby\"\n| Harold Burrage\n| 5:02\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 9\n| \"Sadie\"\n| Hound Dog Taylor\n| 5:05\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 10\n| \"Forgive Me\"\n| Randy Chortkoff\n| 4:16\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+ Production\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Role\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Name\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Produced by\n| Randy Chortkoff\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Executive producer\n| Jerry Gordon\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Post production coordinator\n| Alan Edwards\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Engineer\n| Glen Nishida\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mixing\n| Randy Chortkoff & Glen Nishida\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Photography\n| Mark Castle\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Art production & design\n| Mark Castle\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Liner notes\n| Scott Dirks\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+ Musicians\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Role\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Tracks\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | King Ernest\n| Vocals\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Paul Bryant\n| Guitar\n| 2, 7, 10\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Lester Butler\n| harmonica\n| 4\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Lee Campbell\n| Drums\n| 6, 7\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Randy Chortkoff\n| Harmonica\n| 2, 3, 10\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mitch Kashmar\n| Harmonica\n| 6\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Andy Kaulkin\n| Piano, Organ\n| 1–3, 5-10\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Pete Kay\n| Drums\n| 4, 5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Tom Leavey\n| Bass\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Ronnie MacRory\n| Drums\n| 9, 10\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Jonnie Morgan\n| Drums\n| 2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Jimmy Rip\n| Guitar\n| 5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Lee Smith\n| Drums\n| 1, 3, 8\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Zac Zunis\n| Guitar\n| 1, 3, 4, 6, 8-10\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | The Texicali Horns\n|\n| 1–3, 5, 7, 8\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Darrell Leonard\n| Trumpet\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Joe Sublet\n| Tenor sax\n|\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
