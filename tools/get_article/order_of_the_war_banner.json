It was awarded  to military commanders who show personal courage or self-sacrifice during the war.\nHistory\nThe Order of the War Banner It was founded by the Presidency of People's Assembly on 29 December 1951, with one class. After that, a public competition for the design of the insignia was announced. The results of the competition were published in Politika on 27 August 1953, and the winner was Grigorij Samojlov, an architect from Belgrade. From its establishment in 1951 until 1984, there were 209 recipients of the order; 204 were Yugoslav citizens, and the remaining five were Soviet generals (who were all awarded in 1964).\nIn 1998, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia adopted new Law on Decorations that kept most of the decorations of the Socialist Yugoslavia, with some additions. Order of the War Banner was kept, but now had three classes. The inscription on the badge was slightly altered, so now it read \"За слободу и независност отаџбине\" (For the freedom and independence of the motherland).\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"70%\" align=\"center\"\n! colspan=\"3\" |Ribbon bar (1951-1992)\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" valign=\"center\" width=\"20%\" |Order of the War Banner (single class)\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |Ribbon bars (1998-2006)\n|-\n| align=\"center\" valign=\"center\"|Order of the War Banner, 1st class\n| align=\"center\" valign=\"center\"|Order of the War Banner, 2nd class\n| align=\"center\" valign=\"center\"|Order of the War Banner, 3rd class\n|}\nRecipients\nSocialist Yugoslavia\n* Petar Gračanin\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia\n* Vladimir Lazarević (1st class)\n* Guards Brigade (1st class)\n* 72nd Brigade for Special Operations (1st class)\nSee also\n*Orders, decorations, and medals of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\n*Orders and medals of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\nSources"
