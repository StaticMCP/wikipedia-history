In this manner, genetic code can be subjected to Version Control Systems such as Git, for the development of improvements and new gene edits, therapeutic components and therapies.\nExamples\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF) funded Wiki project Open Wetware (OWW) provides a resource for reagent, project and laboratory notebook sharing.\nA somewhat related NSF consortium Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center (SynBERC) constructed and distributed wetware. It was succeeded in 2016 by the Engineering Biology Research Consortium.\nReferences"
