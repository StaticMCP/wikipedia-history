Headquartered in Florida, United States, ICTSG operates through continental and regional offices worldwide, including in Kyoto (Japan), Lahore (Pakistan), Cannes (France), and Africa, with the aim of promoting, protecting, and revitalizing traditional sports and games globally.\nThe origins of the ICTSG’s mandate trace back to international initiatives beginning in 1999, when the concept of safeguarding traditional sports and games was first recognized in multilateral forums. The Council’s current strategic pathway, documented through its 1999–2030 timeline, outlines milestones in policy development, institutional partnerships, and global awareness campaigns aimed at integrating traditional sports within educational, cultural, and development agendas.\nInstitutional Role\nICTSG serves as the sole global platform dedicated to the preservation, promotion, and elevation of traditional sports and games. It coordinates with governments, intergovernmental organizations, and civil society to ensure the inclusion of traditional sports in cultural heritage policies and sustainable development strategies. The Council also convenes world and continental games, capacity-building programs, and maintains the ICTSG Online Encyclopedia of Traditional Sports and Games, cataloguing over 160 documented disciplines from around the globe.\nSix-Stage Elevation Framework\nIn alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), ICTSG has developed a Six-Stage Elevation Framework designed to guide the recognition, registration, and institutional adoption of traditional sports at national and international levels. The framework provides structured pathways from local community validation to formal inclusion in international sporting calendars, ensuring that heritage sports are preserved and revitalized for future generations.\nWay Forward\nLooking ahead to 2030, ICTSG’s roadmap emphasizes intercultural dialogue, youth engagement, and technological integration to bring traditional sports into contemporary relevance while safeguarding their cultural authenticity. This includes leveraging immersive technologies, building global coalitions, and supporting policies that embed traditional sports into education and sustainable tourism sectors.\nLeadership\nAs of 2025, the leadership of ICTSG includes several high-profile international figures:\n* Khalil Ahmed Khan – President\n* Joel Bouzou – Ambassador-at-Large\n* Yahya Al-Mataar Jobe – Vice President (Africa)\n* Harko H. Brown – Official Coordinator, Pacific Region\n* Bulat Galimgereyev – Vice President (Europe)\n* Dr. Michael Shamsu Mustapha – Vice President (Africa)\nTSGDAY 2025 - 14th August Celebrated Globally by Traditional Sports & Games Community\nOn 14th August 2025, the ICTSG led a historic global celebration of the International Day for Traditional Sports and Games (TSG Day). The event was marked by the unanimous approval of a landmark Declaration by the ICTSG President in the presence of key stakeholders, members, associated organizations, and international press. The declaration reaffirmed ICTSG’s legitimacy as the sole leading global platform, headquartered in Florida, committed to promoting, protecting, and revitalizing traditional sports and games worldwide.\nThis moment has been hailed as a defining milestone for the global TSG community, further solidifying ICTSG’s role in safeguarding cultural heritage for generations to come.\nReferences:\nName\nICTSG has issued a public statement asserting its status as “an independent, external, and non‑governmental organization.” It acknowledges its origins in UNESCO‑facilitated consultations but emphasizes that it is not governed by UNESCO, nor does it form part of its legal, administrative, or financial structure.\nAccording to the statement: “ICTSG wishes to reaffirm its status as an independent, external, and non-governmental organization, distinct in legal identity and institutional framework from UNESCO.” This wording highlights both the historical connections and current autonomy of ICTSG.\nHistory\nIn March 2025, Shammi Rana, the former Secretary General of the International Council of Traditional Sports and Games (ICTSG), took part in a high-level event organized by the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT) at the UN Headquarters in New York. The event, titled \"Securing the Legacy: Debriefing from Paris 2024 for Future Major Sporting Events,\" commemorated the fifth anniversary of UNOCT’s Global Sports Programme. It brought together global stakeholders to discuss strategies for improving the safety, inclusiveness, and lasting impact of upcoming international sporting events.\nRana took part in a side event focused on the World Games for Indigenous Peoples, where the accomplishments related to Article 31 of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples were highlighted. The event, co-hosted by ICTSG and the Comité Intertribal Memória e Ciência Indígena, also featured a preview of the upcoming World Indigenous Games 2025 in Brazil.\nAdditionally, Rana also participated in another side event on the Commonwealth Sport Declaration, organized by WIN Sports International and the International Organization of Indigenous Resource Development (IOIRD), which focused on supporting Indigenous athletes and cultural initiatives.\nICTSG claims that Shami Ranna's Anamoly in California is not recognized or related with the Council\nThe ICTSG has issued a formal clarification stating that the alleged activities and claims associated with Shami Ranna’s anomaly in California are neither recognized nor connected with the Council. ICTSG reiterated that any such associations are unauthorized and have no legitimate link to its global governance or operations.\nReference:\nIn August 2025, ICTSG published a clarification addressing recent online statements and references appearing on external platforms. The Council stated that ongoing dialogues between governing bodies and affiliated organizations are internal matters, and that premature or unauthorized disclosures are considered breaches of its Code of Conduct, Privacy Policy, and Disclaimers. A fraud alert was issued, advising stakeholders to verify all documents, statements, and appointments via the ICTSG Verification Portal, as official records now include digital security seals and QR codes.\nUNESCO Statement on False Affiliation by Pakistan-Based ICTSG\nIn April 2025, UNESCO released an official statement rejecting claims of affiliation made by a Pakistan-based group calling itself the International Council of Traditional Sports and Games (ICTSG), led by Khalil Ahmed Khan.\nThe statement was issued following a formal complaint submitted by members of the former Ad Hoc Advisory Committee on Traditional Sports and Games (2017–2019). These members raised concerns about the misuse of UNESCO’s name, logo, and past initiatives by the Pakistan-based ICTSG.\nUNESCO clarified that:\n* The Ad Hoc Advisory Committee was dissolved after 2019.\n* The organization led by Khalil Ahmed Khan is not affiliated with UNESCO.\n* The use of UNESCO’s name or logo without permission is not allowed and may result in further action.\nHowever, The ICTSG has issued an official clarification regarding the above points, stating that such references originate from private media sources and reiterating its status as an independent, external, and non-governmental organization. The Council emphasized that no additional official confirmation has been found beyond these reports.\nReferences"
