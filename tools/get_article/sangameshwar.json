The headquarters for the taluka is the town of Devrukh. In Sangameshwar the two rivers Sonavi and Shastri flow together.  The meaning of Sangama in Sanskrit (and most Indian languages) is \"confluence,\" and so the name \"Sangameshwar\". It is historically important as the place where Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, son of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was captured by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb.\nGeography\nThe city lies on the confluence of the Shastri River and Sonavi River. To the east of the city lie the Western Ghats and to the west lies Ganpatipule. The region has a tropical climate.
