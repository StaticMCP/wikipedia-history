Peshawar was governed by the Barakzai Sardars — Yar Mohammed Khan, Sultan Mohammed Khan, Sayeed Mohammed Khan and Pir Mohammed Khan. They were collectively referred to as the Peshawar Barakzais. The Peshawar Barakzais had broken free of their half-brothers ruling Kabul.\nCharles Masson, pseudonym of a deserter from the army of The East India Company was an eyewitness to the event and has left a detailed account.\nEvents\nFollowing the collapse of the Durrani Empire, Afghanistan split into many different states to where virtually every city was autonomous or independent in some shape or form, with states like the Principality of Qandahar and the Emirate of Herat being formed. Maharaj Ranjit Singh sent General Hari Singh Nalwa and Mahan Singh Hazarawala as Nalwa's deputy commander to capture Peshawar. After brief fighting, Hari Singh Nalwa captured the city. The news of the capture of Peshawar quickly reached Kabul and Dost Mohammad Khan, learning of his deposed brothers defeat. Hari Singh Nalwa was appointed as governor of the city by Maharaja Ranjit Singh.\nReferences"
