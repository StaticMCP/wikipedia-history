It further cemented the eventual fall of the Safavid dynasty, which had been declining for decades.\nAftermath\nAfter the battle was won, the Hotak Afghans began slowly but surely to march on deeper into Persia, and eventually towards Isfahan, the Safavid Persian capital. Numbers and casualty figures of the Gulnabad battle are believed to be between 5,000 and 15,000 dead Safavid soldiers.\nSee also\n*Battle of Damghan\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Axworthy, Michael (2006).
