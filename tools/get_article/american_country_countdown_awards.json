      "text": "# American Country Countdown Awards\n\nThe American Country Countdown Awards were a country music award presentation that was held in 2014 and 2016. Produced by Dick Clark Productions and co-branded with the syndicated radio show American Country Countdown, it featured awards based on album sales, touring data, and radio airplay (with the exception of the Breakthrough Artist of the Year award which is fan-voted).\nThe ACCAs were broadcast by Fox, serving as a de facto replacement for their previous American Country Awards show.\nHosts\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
