Several of the residents worked in Houston, some of the residents worked in the Houston Heights, and some residents worked in other areas. The city had 715 residents in 1920. George O. Burgess, a lawyer born in Milligan Texas in 1876, was elected its first mayor. Burgess Hall, located at 700 E. 34th Street, was the City Hall and Courthouse until 1919.
