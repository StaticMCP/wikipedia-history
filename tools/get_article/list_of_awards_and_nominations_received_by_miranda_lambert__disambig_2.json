Lambert is the most awarded artist in the history of the ACM Awards and she is one of only 4 women to win the Triple Crown (winning Best New Vocalist, Best Female Vocalist & Entertainer Of The Year). Lambert is also the most awarded female artist in the history of CMA Awards.\nAcademy of Country Music Awards\nThe Academy of Country Music Awards, also known as the ACM Awards, were first held in 1966, honoring the industry's accomplishments during the previous year. It was the first country music awards program held by a major organization. The Academy's signature \"hat\" trophy was created in 1968. The awards were first televised in 1972 on ABC. In 1979, the Academy joined with Dick Clark Productions to produce the show. Dick Clark and Al Schwartz served as producers and Gene Weed served as director. Under their guidance, the show moved to NBC and finally to CBS, where it remains today. As of 2024, Lambert is the most awarded artist in the history of the ACM awards, receiving several special Milestone Awards over the years, including the honorable Triple Crown Award in 2023 for her achievement of attaining Top New Female Vocalist, Top Female Vocalist, and Entertainer of the Year Awards. Lambert has won 35 ACM awards out of 75 nominations.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Award\n!Nomination\n!Result\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2006\n|Top New Female Vocalist\n|Miranda Lambert\n|\n|-\n|Video of the Year\n|\"Kerosene\"\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 2007\n| Top New Female Vocalist\n|rowspan=\"3\"| Miranda Lambert\n|\n|-\n| Female Vocalist of the Year\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"| 2008\n| Top Female Vocalist\n|\n|-\n| Album of the Year\n| Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\n|\n|-\n| Single Record of the Year\n| \"Famous in a Small Town\"\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2009\n| Top Female Vocalist\n| Miranda Lambert\n|\n|-\n| Single Record of the Year\n| \"Gunpowder & Lead\"\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"| 2010\n| Top Female Vocalist of the Year\n| Miranda Lambert\n|\n|-\n| Album of the Year\n| Revolution\n|\n|-\n| Single Record of the Year\n|rowspan=\"3\"| \"White Liar\"\n|\n|-\n| Song of the Year\n|\n|-\n| Video of the Year\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" | 2011\n| Entertainer of the Year\n|rowspan=\"2\"| Miranda Lambert\n|\n|-\n| Top Female Vocalist of the Year\n|\n|-\n| Single Record of the Year\n|rowspan=\"3\"| \"The House That Built Me\"\n|\n|-\n| Song of the Year\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| Video of the Year\n|\n|-\n| \"Only Prettier\"\n|\n|-\n|Vocal Event of the Year\n|\"Coal Miner's Daughter\" with Loretta Lynn and Sheryl Crow\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 2012\n| Female Vocalist of the Year\n| Miranda Lambert\n|\n|-\n| Album of the Year\n| Four the Record\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 2013\n| Female Vocalist of the Year\n|rowspan=\"2\"| Miranda Lambert\n|\n|-\n| Entertainer of the Year\n|\n|-\n| Single of the Year\n| \"Over You\"\n|\n|-\n| Song of the Year\n| \"Over You\"\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" | 2014\n| Entertainer of the Year\n|rowspan=\"2\"| Miranda Lambert\n|\n|-\n| Female Vocalist of the Year\n|\n|-\n| Single of the Year\n|rowspan=\"3\"| \"Mama's Broken Heart\"\n|\n|-\n| Song of the Year\n|\n|-\n| Video of the Year\n|\n|-\n| Vocal Event of the Year\n| \"We Were Us\" with Keith Urban\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"8\" | 2015\n| Entertainer of the Year\n|rowspan=\"2\"| Miranda Lambert\n|\n|-\n| Female Vocalist of the Year\n|\n|-\n| Album of the Year\n| Platinum\n|\n|-\n| Single of the Year\n|rowspan=\"2\"| \"Automatic\"\n|\n|-\n| Song of the Year\n|\n|-\n| Video of the Year\n|rowspan=\"2\"| \"Somethin' Bad\" with Carrie Underwood\n|\n|-\n| Vocal Event of the Year\n|\n|-\n|50th Anniversary Milestone Award\n|Miranda Lambert\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 2016\n| Female Vocalist of the Year\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Miranda Lambert\n|\n|-\n| Entertainer of the Year\n|\n|-\n| Vocal Event of the Year\n| \"Smokin' and Drinkin'\" with Little Big Town\n|\n|-\n|Merle Haggard Spirit Award\n|Miranda Lambert\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" | 2017\n| Female Vocalist of the Year\n| Miranda Lambert\n|\n|-\n| Album of the Year\n| The Weight of These Wings\n|\n|-\n| Single Record of the Year\n|rowspan=\"3\"| \"Vice\"\n|\n|-\n| Song of the Year\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Video of the Year\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\"Forever Country\" with Artists of Then, Now & Forever\n|\n|-\n|Vocal Event of the Year\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"| 2018\n| Female Vocalist of the Year\n| Miranda Lambert\n|\n|-\n| Song of the Year\n| \"Tin Man\"\n|\n|-\n| Video of the Year\n| \"We Should Be Friends\"\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"| 2019\n| Female Vocalist of the Year\n| rowspan=2|Miranda Lambert\n|\n|-\n| Gene Weed Milestone Award\n|\n|-\n| Music Event of the Year\n| \"Drowns the Whiskey\" with Jason Aldean\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 2020\n| Female Vocalist of the Year\n| Miranda Lambert\n|\n|-\n|Album of the Year\n|Wildcard\n|\n|-\n| Music Event of the Year\n| “Fooled Around and Fell in Love” with Maren Morris, Ashley McBryde, Tenille Townes, Caylee Hammack, and Elle King\n|\n|-\n|Song of the Decade\n|\"The House That Built Me\"\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"| 2021\n| Female Vocalist of the Year\n| Miranda Lambert\n|\n|-\n|Single of the Year\n|rowspan=\"3\"|\"Bluebird\"\n|\n|-\n|Song of the Year\n|\n|-\n| Video of the Year\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"| 2022\n| Entertainer of the Year\n|rowspan=\"2\"| Miranda Lambert\n|\n|-\n| Female Vocalist of the Year\n|\n|-\n| Album of the Year\n| The Marfa Tapes\n|\n|-\n| Video of the Year\n| \"Drunk (And I Don't Wanna Go Home)\" with Elle King\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" | 2023\n| Entertainer of the Year\n| rowspan=\"4\" | Miranda Lambert\n|\n|-\n| Female Vocalist of the Year\n|\n|-\n| Artist-Songwriter of the Year\n|\n|-\n|Triple Crown Award\n|\n|-\n| Album of the Year\n| Palomino\n|\n|}\nAmerican Country Awards\nThe American Country Awards is a country music awards show, entirely voted on by fans.
