Explorer John Lawson mentions \"Tuskeraro\", \"Neus\", \"Schoccores and Achonechy Indians\" in his journal. He also mentions the devastation from illnesses like smallpox and \"distemper\" on the native population which killed entire towns and left one sixth the original population in the area.\n* 1587 – In a venture sponsored by Sir Walter Raleigh, John White and a group of colonists land on Roanoke Island at the site of a former, abandoned settlement to found the \"Cittie of Raleigh,\" about 190 miles from present-day Raleigh, NC. John White returns to England for supplies, leaving behind his granddaughter Virginia Dare, the first English child born in the New World.\n* 1590 – His return delayed by threats against England by the Spanish Armada, John White secures passage on a privateer. As the party stepped ashore, there was no sign of the colonists except the letters \"CROATOAN\" carved on a tree.  This abandoned site later became known as the \"Lost Colony.\"\n* 1701 – John Lawson, English explorer, led a 600-mile expedition starting in Charleston, SC and ending at the mouth of the Pamlico River.  His journey took him close to the site of what later became Raleigh, NC.\n* 1770 – Joel Lane, a planter, successfully lobbies the colonial General Assembly to create Wake County.\n* 1781 – Lane's property was the setting for a session of the state General Assembly.
