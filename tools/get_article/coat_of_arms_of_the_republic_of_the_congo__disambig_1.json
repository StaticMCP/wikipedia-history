The background color of the shield is gold with a green, wavy, horizontal stripe along the middle. A golden crown sits above the shield. Two large African war elephants support the shield. A banner with the national motto \"Unité, Travail, Progrès\" (; translated from \"La Congolaise\") is draped from a bar supporting the war elephants. The arms were adopted in 1960 and readopted in 1991 after having been replaced with a simpler, unheraldic symbol during the People's Republic of the Congo era from 1970 to 1991.\nOfficial description\nThe coat of arms is described as follows:\n*Or, a fess wavy vert, a lion gules, armed and langued vert, overall, maintaining a torch sable flamed gules.\n*A special forest crown.\n*The shield is supported by two war elephants sable tusked or, issuing from the flanks of the shield and sustained on a tree trunk gules.\n*On the circle or of the forest crown: \"République du Congo\" in letters gules upon a scroll or.\n*Motto \"Unité-Travail-Progrès\" in letters gules upon a scroll or.\nHistorical symbols\nFile:Coat of arms of the People's Republic of the Congo.svg|Emblem of the People's Republic of the Congo (1970–1991)\nReferences"
