It took place on December 2, 2000, at the Sheffield Arena in Sheffield, England. The event was broadcast exclusively in the United Kingdom.\nProduction\nBackground\nIn 1999, the American professional wrestling promotion World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) held a United Kingdom-exclusive pay-per-view (PPV) titled Rebellion. The following year, a second Rebellion PPV was announced to be held on December 2, 2000, at the Sheffield Arena in Sheffield, England, thus establishing Rebellion as an annual UK PPV for the promotion.\nStorylines\nThe event featured nine professional wrestling matches and two pre-show matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\nEvent\n{| class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ Other on-screen personnel\n|-\n!Role:\n!Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|English commentators\n|Jim Ross\n|-\n|Tazz\n|-\n|Interviewer\n|Michael Cole\n|-\n|Ring announcer\n|Tony Chimel\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|Referees\n|Mike Chioda\n|-\n|Earl Hebner\n|-\n|Chad Patton\n|-\n|Tim White\n|-\n|Theodore Long\n|-\n|}\nThe opening match was an elimination tables match. This match saw The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) defeat Edge and Christian and T & A (Albert and Test). Edge and Christian first put Albert through a table with a double powerbomb. Christian was then put through a table via a 3-D.\nThe second match was for the WWF Women's Championship. Ivory successfully retained her title against Lita, when Lita went for a sunset flip, Ivory grabbed Steven Richards to block the move, which enabled her to roll up Lita for the win.\nThe next match was a hardcore match for the WWF Hardcore Championship. Steve Blackman retained the title when he kicked a chair into the face of the challenger Perry Saturn.\nThe WWF European Championship was next defended when William Regal took on Crash Holly. Regal pinned Holly for the win, however the referee reversed his decision when Molly Holly pointed out to him that Crash’s foot was on the bottom rope. While the referee was explaining to the ring announcer what happened, Crash used the opportunity to hit a drop kick on Regal and pick up the pinfall victory, and winning the title. Following the match, Regal grabbed the belt, attacked both Hollys and left with the title.\nThe next match saw Billy Gunn and Chyna defeat Dean Malenko and Eddie Guerrero. After Gunn cleared Guerrero from the ring, he hit the Cobra Clutch Slam on Malenko, and picked up the pinfall victory.\nDuring the following match, Kane defeated Chris Jericho. After the match, while Kane was exiting, Jericho grabbed a chair and ran after Kane, attacking him with it. Jericho ultimately applied the Walls of Jericho on Kane while on the entrance ramp, before being broken up by referees.\nThe WWF Tag Team Championship was defended next when Right to Censor (Bull Buchanan and The Goodfather) defended their titles against The Hardy Boyz (Jeff Hardy and Matt Hardy).\nThe next match was scheduled to be The Undertaker taking on Chris Benoit; However prior to the match, Benoit, along with his other members of The Radicalz (Malenko, Saturn and Guerrero), attacked The Undertaker backstage. They twice played The Undertaker's music, but he was unable to come out. Tony Chimel then announced that should The Undertaker not come out, he would be forced to forfeit the match. The match ended when Benoit attempted to put a figure-4 on The Undertaker, however he countered with an inside cradle for the win.\nThe main event saw WWF Champion Kurt Angle defend his title in a Fatal-4-Way match against Rikishi, The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin. Austin and The Rock dominated Angle and Rikishi until the two men squared off. Austin hit a Stunner on Rock but Angle broke up the count. The Rock then executed a Rock Bottom on Austin but the members of the Radicalz as well as Edge and Christian interfered and attacked both Rock and Austin. Austin recovered early and hit a Stunner on Rikishi however he was attacked by the Radicalz, which allowed Angle to hit the Olympic Slam on Rikishi and retain the title.\nAfter the match, Austin and Rock fought off the Radicalz and taunted each other, before sharing beers and posing for the crowd as the show ended.\nReception\nIn 2008, J.D. Dunn of 411Mania gave the event a rating of 7.0 [Good], writing, \"Not a bad show at all. The undercard is filled with average-to-decent matches, and the uppercard features one of the few Benoit versus Undertaker matches as well as a fine four-way match.\nThumbs up.\"\nResults\n|note1  = dark\n|match1 = Val Venis defeated Bradshaw\n|stip1  = Singles match\n|time1  =\n|match2  = The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) defeated Edge and Christian and T & A (Test and Albert) (with Trish Stratus)\n|stip2   = Elimination tables match\n|time2   = 9:55\n|match3  = Ivory (c) (with Steven Richards) defeated Lita\n|stip3   = Singles match for the WWF Women's Championship\n|time3   = 2:57\n|match4  = Steve Blackman (c) defeated Perry Saturn\n|stip4   = Hardcore match for the WWF Hardcore Championship\n|time4   = 6:02\n|match5  = Crash Holly (with Molly Holly) defeated William Regal (c)\n|stip5   = Singles match for the WWF European Championship\n|time5   = 4:59\n|match6  = Billy Gunn and Chyna defeated Dean Malenko and Eddie Guerrero\n|stip6   = Tag team match\n|time6   = 7:26\n|match7  = Kane defeated Chris Jericho\n|stip7   = Singles match\n|time7   = 8:06\n|match8  = Right to Censor (Bull Buchanan and The Goodfather) (c) (with Val Venis) defeated The Hardy Boyz (Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy)\n|stip8   = Tag team match for the WWF Tag Team Championship\n|time8   = 8:08\n|match9  = The Undertaker defeated Chris Benoit\n|stip9   = Singles match\n|time9   = 12:18\n|match10  = Kurt Angle (c) defeated Rikishi, The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin\n|stip10   = Fatal 4-Way match for the WWF Championship\n|time10   = 8:51\n}}\nSee also\n*Professional wrestling in the United Kingdom\nReferences"
