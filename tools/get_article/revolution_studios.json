On February 17, 2000, Roth signed an agreement with actress Julia Roberts to star in their films as well as producing through their Shoelace Productions banner.\nOn June 7, 2000, Roth officially decided to name his new venture Revolution Studios (the name coming from the song by The Beatles, as he has admitted to being a lifelong fan of the band) and announced that Tomcats would be the first film to be produced by the studio. On the same day, Revolution Studios entered into an agreement with Sony Pictures (which also owned a stake in the company) to distribute and market Revolution Studios' films. Roth owned the controlling interest in Revolution Studios. Other equity owners included Hollywood executives Todd Garner, Rob Moore, Tom Sherak and Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas, as well as Starz Entertainment and 20th Century Fox. Starz owned exclusive cable distribution rights, with broadcast television licenses going to Fox. The company sold their films to various distributors in Germany, Italy, Japan, Scandinavia, Portugal and Israel.\nSoon afterwards, the company expanded into television production, under the moniker Revolution Television, with Queens Supreme as its first product, followed by a deal with American Girl.\nOn January 5, 2005, Revolution Studios signed a television syndication distribution deal with Debmar-Mercury to market their library to syndication.\nIn August 2006, Revolution Studios announced that it had licensed to Universal Pictures the sequel rights to its comic-book-inspired hit Hellboy (2004). Universal released Hellboy II: The Golden Army in the United States in 2008.\nCoinciding with the end of its six-year distribution deal with Sony in 2007, Revolution Studios turned its attention to exploiting the remake, sequel and television rights to films in its library. Roth suddenly decided to move into a producing deal with Sony Pictures to start his own production company.\nRevolution Studios produced a sitcom based on its comedy feature Are We There Yet?, which ran from June 1, 2010 to March 2, 2013 on TBS, as well as a sitcom adaptation of Anger Management, which ran from June 28, 2012 to December 22, 2014 on FX.\nIn June 2014, Roth announced that he had sold Revolution Studios to funds managed by Fortress Investment Group for roughly $250 million. Roth continues to serve as a strategic adviser and develops television projects for the Revolution Studios through a first-look deal. Concurrent with the sale, former Chief Operating Officer Vince Totino was promoted to CEO, and former finance executive Scott Hemming was named COO.\nAfter the sale, the newly recapitalized Revolution Studios began adding to its library through a series of acquisitions. In October 2014, Revolution Studios acquired the foreign rights and copyrights of Morgan Creek Productions.\nIn October 2015, Revolution Studios acquired Cross Creek Pictures' 50% interests in feature films Black Swan and The Ides of March. Later that month, Revolution Studios purchased the eight-film Cold Spring Pictures film library, including the 2009 Academy Award nominee and Golden Globe Award winner Up in the Air.\nAlso in 2015, Revolution Studios announced a partnership with Universal Pictures Home Entertainment to produce non-theatrical sequels, prequels, or other spinoffs based on the titles in Revolution Studios' library.\nIn June 2016, Revolution Studios expanded its library to 126 films when it acquired worldwide rights to five films produced by Graham King's GK Films: Hugo, The Tourist, Edge of Darkness, The Rum Diary and The Young Victoria. The rights were previously held by Dallas-based Tango Films. In January 2017, Revolution Studios returned to film production with their release XXX: Return of Xander Cage, the company's first film since 2007's The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep.\nIn January 2017, Content Partners LLC and its affiliate CP Enterprises acquired Revolution Studios from investment funds managed by affiliates of Fortress Investment Group for an undisclosed price.\nCorporate partnerships\nIn October 2014, Revolution Studios forged a global licensing pact with Miramax, wherein Miramax would sell the worldwide television and digital distribution rights to Revolution Studios' library. Miramax has been handling U.S. sales of the Revolution Studios library since June 2012.\nIn May 2016, Revolution Studios announced that it had made a seven-figure investment for a stake in Spanish-language digital services company Latin Everywhere, agreeing to license Spanish-dubbed versions of its library titles to Latin Everywhere's video streaming platform Pongalo (Spanish for \"play it\").\nIn October 2019, Revolution Studios signed a worldwide television and digital distribution deal with Sony Pictures Television, covering the Revolution Studios and Morgan Creek libraries.\nFilms\nHere is a list of films independently produced by Revolution Studios:\nTheatrical films\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
