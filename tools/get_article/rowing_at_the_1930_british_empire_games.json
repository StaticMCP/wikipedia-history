      "text": "# Rowing at the 1930 British Empire Games\n\nAt the 1930 British Empire Games, the rowing competition featured six events for men only (one of which was presumed to be a demonstration event).  In the double sculls event, only Canada was represented, so the organisers simply invited a couple of crews from the United States to provide some opposition. The events were held at Burlington Bay.\nBobby Pearce won the single sculls. Pearce also won the quarter mile dash, also referred to as the canoe championships but it is not clear if this was a medal event or solely a demonstration event. A Canoe event was held between Canada and the United States on the same day.\nThe four and eight gold medal winning England crews were represented by the London Rowing Club, while Canada's coxed four was represented by McGill University Rowing Club and the coxless four by Halifax RC.\nMedal table\n| gold_NZL = 1 | silver_NZL = 1 | bronze_NZL = 1\n| gold_BGU = 0 | silver_BGU = 0 | bronze_BGU = 1\n}}\nMedal summary\n{|\n|-\n|¼ mile dash (+)\n|||1:31sec\n|||1 length\n|||\n|-\n|Single sculls\n|||8:33sec\n|||10 lengths\n|||\n|-\n|Double sculls\n|||7:48\n|Only one pair entered ||\n|Only one pair entered ||\n|-\n|Coxless four\n| (London RC)Francis FitzwilliamsArthur HarbyHugh EdwardsHumphrey Boardman||7:05\n| (Halifax RC)Jerry CalnanJim FlemmingAlbert BellewHenry Pelham||+2 lgths\n|Berry JohnsonVic OlssonAlex RossCharley Saunders||\n|-\n|Coxed four\n|Mick BroughJack MacdonaldBen WatersBert SandosArthur Eastwood||8:02\n| (McGill RC)David Lorne GalesR.
