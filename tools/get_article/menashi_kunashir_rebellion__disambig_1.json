The Ainu working in this industry were forced into it, and subjected to rampant exploitation.\nIn response to the exploitation and the abuses of Ainu workers in the industry, and potentially a suspicion of poisoned sake being given to Ainu in a loyalty ceremony, in May 1789 the Ainu attacked the Yamato on Kunashir and parts of the Menashi District, as well as at sea. More than 70 Yamato were killed. The Yamato executed 37 Ainu identified as conspirators and arrested many others.\nAfter the battle, the Matsumae Domain commissioned the Ishūretsuzō series of portraits of twelve elders who had helped suppress the revolt.\nIn literature\nThe battle is the subject of Majin no Umi, a children's novel by Maekawa Yasuo that received the Japanese Association of Writers for Children Prize in 1970.\nSee also\n* Shakushain's revolt, a similar large-scale Ainu revolt against Yamato influence\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://iiclo.or.jp/100books/1946/htm-e/060main-e.htm English-language page about Majin no Umi]"
