Razzies co-founder John J. B. Wilson has stated that the intent of the awards is \"to be funny.\" The nominees were announced on February 8, 2020, one day prior to the 92nd Academy Awards. The ceremony, the date of which was later announced to be March 14, 2020, was ultimately cancelled amid the concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic. The organizers announced the ceremony's winners online on March 16, 2020. No nominees were announced for the \"Worst of the Decade Awards\", despite being the tradition for the final ceremony of the decade. In contrast, critically acclaimed sequel Toy Story 4 became the first Pixar film to be nominated for a Razzie Redeemer Award.\nWinners and nominees\nThe nominations were announced on February 8, 2020.\n, Worst Picture co-winner]]\n, Worst Picture co-winner, Worst Director winner and Worst Screenplay co-winner]]\n, Worst Actor winner]]\n, Worst Actress winner]]\n, Worst Supporting Actor winner]]\n, Worst Supporting Actress winner]]\n, Worst Screenplay co-winner]]\n, Razzie Redeemer Award winner]]\n{|class=wikitable\n|+40th Golden Raspberry Award nominees\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n* 'Cats (Universal) – Debra Hayward, Tim Bevan, Eric Fellner, Tom Hooper'\n** The Fanatic (Quiver) – Daniel Grodnik, Oscar Generale, Bill Kenwright\n** The Haunting of Sharon Tate (Saban) – Lucas Jarach, Daniel Farrands, Eric Brenner\n** A Madea Family Funeral (Lionsgate) – Ozzie Areu, Will Areu, Mark E.

WhatCulture criticized the nominations, saying that \"It feels as though voters just wanted to nominate Joker for the enormous social media publicity it would generate, and then shaped a dubious awards category around it. Dragged Across Concrete is an even weirder pick, though, both because of its low-budget nature and the fact that there's not that much carnage in it. Michael Bay's 6 Underground is clearly a far worthier nominee than either of those films, given how much obvious human collateral damage is racked up amid the chaotic action sequences.\"\nPlanned ceremony\nIn June 2019, Comedy Dynamics (a company founded by Brian Volk-Weiss) announced that it would produce the awards ceremony. Also, it was to be broadcast live on a \"Comedy Dynamics Network\", which would have marked the first time a Golden Raspberry ceremony was watched by public through a live telecast.\nThe unusual scheduling of the 92nd Academy Awards (usually held towards the end of February) on February 9 affected the 2020 edition of the Golden Raspberry Awards. The organizers announced the nominees on February 8, 2020, one day prior to the AMPAS event. The organizers later announced that the year's Razzie ceremony would be held on March 14; it would have been the second ceremony held after the Academy Awards, spurning the tradition of announcing the winners on the eve of the Oscars ceremony.\nDespite the COVID-19 pandemic, the ceremony was going to go on as scheduled. The organizers later ultimately announced that the ceremony was cancelled, citing bans on mass gatherings that were enacted by local authorities in the wake of the outbreak. The organizers eventually announced winners online on March 16, 2020, through their website and their YouTube channel.\nSee also\n* 92nd Academy Awards\n* 77th Golden Globe Awards\n* 73rd British Academy Film Awards\n* 35th Independent Spirit Awards\n* 26th Screen Actors Guild Awards\n* 25th Critics' Choice Awards\n* 47th Annie Awards\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
