U.S. Route 95 on the American side joins British Columbia Highway 95 on the Canadian side.\nCanadian side\nFrom the junction with the Canadian Pacific Railway at Yahk, the rail head of the Spokane International Railroad (SI) reached the border in November 1905. Two months earlier, a Canadian customs office opened across the border at Eastport. In July 1906, an office opened at Kingsgate, under the administrative oversight of the Port of Nelson. In 1909, the Port of Cranbrook assumed oversight. In 1948, the status was upgraded to Port of Kingsgate. In 1961, 24-hour service began.\nThe depression-era wooden border station was replaced with a brick border station in 1953. This was replaced with the current concrete and steel structure in 2012.\nThis crossing is open 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.\nUS side\nUS Border Inspection Station at Eastport, ID, 1987\nThe SI rail head from the border reached Bonners Ferry in June 1906.\nThe US Customs Service initially operated from space in the railroad depot. In 1934, land was purchased and a new facility was opened in 1936. The building underwent a series of upgrades over subsequent years. The border station was replaced by the current facility in 1988.\nSee also\n* List of Canada–United States border crossings\nReferences\nExternal links\n* (Canadian side)\n* U.S. Customs and Border Protection |url=https://www.cbp.gov/about/contact/ports/eastport-id-idaho-3302 |access-date=2024-06-26 |website=www.cbp.gov |language=en}} (U.S. Port of Entry)\n* U.S. Customs and Border Protection |url=https://www.cbp.gov/border-security/along-us-borders/border-patrol-sectors/spokane-sector-washington/bonners-ferry-station |access-date=2024-06-26 |website=www.cbp.gov |language=en}} (U.S. Border Patrol)"
