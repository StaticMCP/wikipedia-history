The Colonials, led by fourth year head coach Andrew Toole, played their home games at the Charles L. Sewall Center and were members of the Northeast Conference. They finished the season 22–14, 14–2 in NEC play to win the regular season NEC championship. They advanced to the championship game of the NEC tournament where they lost to Mount St. Mary's. As a regular season conference champion who failed to win their conference tournament, they earned an automatic bid to the National Invitation Tournament. In the NIT, they defeated St. John's in the first round before losing in the second round to Belmont.\nRoster\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n!Number\n!Name\n!Position\n!Height\n!Weight\n!Year\n!Hometown\n|-\n| 1\n| Mike McFadden\n| Forward\n| 6–8\n| 220\n| Senior\n| Newark, New Jersey\n|-\n| 2\n| Britton Lee\n| Guard\n| 5–11\n| 180\n| Freshman\n| Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n|-\n| 3\n| Kavon Stewart\n| Guard\n| 6–0\n| 180\n| Freshman\n| Paterson, New Jersey\n|-\n| 4\n| David Appolon\n| Guard\n| 6–4\n| 190\n| Junior\n| Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n|-\n| 5\n| Anthony Myers-Pate\n| Guard\n| 5–11\n| 170\n| Senior\n| Washington, D.C.\n|-\n| 10\n| Desjuan Newton\n| Guard\n| 6–2\n| 185\n| Junior\n| Seattle, Washington\n|-\n| 11\n| Jeremiah Worthem\n| Forward\n| 6–6\n| 215\n| Freshman\n| Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n|-\n| 12\n| Charles Oliver\n| Guard\n| 6–3\n| 190\n| Junior\n| Scotch Plains, New Jersey\n|-\n| 15\n| Karvel Anderson\n| Guard\n| 6–2\n| 190\n| Senior\n| Elkhart, Indiana\n|-\n| 45\n| Stephan Hawkins\n| Forward\n| 6–9\n| 205\n| Sophomore\n| Gary, Indiana\n|-\n| 22\n| Lucky Jones\n| Guard/Forward\n| 6–5\n| 210\n| Junior\n| Newark, New Jersey\n|-\n| 24\n| Aaron Tate\n| Forward\n| 6–5\n| 220\n| Sophomore\n| New Bern, North Carolina\n|-\n| 33\n| Evan Grey\n| Guard\n| 6–3\n| 180\n| Sophomore\n| Columbia, Maryland\n|}\nSchedule\n|-\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#14234B; color:#B01F2E;\"| Exhibition\n|-\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#14234B; color:#B01F2E;\"| Regular season\n|-\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#14234B; color:#B01F2E;\"| Northeast Conference tournament\n|-\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#14234B; color:#B01F2E;\"| NIT\nReferences"
