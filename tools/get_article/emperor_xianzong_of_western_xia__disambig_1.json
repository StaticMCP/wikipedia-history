He was the second son of the Emperor Shenzong who had abdicated in his favor.\nReign\nEmperor Xianzong inherited a weak empire as his predecessors' Emperor Xiangzong and Emperor Shenzong whose reckless attacks on the Jin dynasty and attempts to ally with the Mongols drained the economy. Emperor Xianzong changed his predecessors' policies and decided to ally with Jin dynasty. However, the Jin dynasty was under a barrage of assault from the Mongol Empire and was unable to help out Western Xia. Emperor Xianzong also changed the policy for Mongols. He decided to fight against the Mongol invaders instead of allying with them. However, the Western Xia armies were exhausted from long, incessant, and costly wars against the Jin, and were unable to repel the Mongol assaults. Xianzong died in 1226.\nReferences"
