The nominee was selected through a series of primary elections and caucuses culminating in the 1932 Republican National Convention held from June 14 to June 16, 1932, in Chicago, Illinois.\nAs the year 1932 began, the Republican Party believed that Herbert Hoover's protectionism and aggressive fiscal policies would solve the then-ongoing Great Depression. President Hoover controlled the party and had little trouble securing a re-nomination.\nRepublican Candidates\nNominee\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=\"3\" |Candidate\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Experience\n!Home state\n! data-sort-type=\"date\" |Campaign\n!Popular vote\n!Contests won\n!Running mate\n|- style=\"background:linen;\"\n! data-sort-=\"Hoover&quot;&quot;\" scope=\"row\" style=\"background:linen;\" |Herbert Hoover\n| style=\"min-width:80px;\" |\n| style=\"background:#9e5728;\" |\n|President of the United States\n(1929–1933)\nU.S. Secretary of Commerce\n(1921–1928)\n|\nCalifornia\n|(Campaign)\nSecured nomination:\nJune 14, 1932\n|869,602 (36.0%)\n|4\n|Charles Curtis\n|}\nWithdrew during convention\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=\"3\" |Candidate\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Experience\n!Home state\n! data-sort-type=\"date\" |Campaign\n!Popular vote\n!Contests won\n|- style=\"background:linen;\"\n! data-sort-=\"Hoover&quot;&quot;\" scope=\"row\" |Joseph I.\nFrance\n| style=\"min-width:80px;\" |\n| style=\"background:#a59400;\" |\n|U.S. Senator from\nMaryland\n(1917-1923)\n|\nMaryland\n|Lost nomination:\nJune 14, 1932\n|1,137,948\n(47.5%)\n|7\n|}\nWithdrew before convention\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=\"3\" |Candidate\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Experience\n!Home state\n! data-sort-type=\"date\" |Campaign\n!Popular vote\n!Contests won\n|-\n! data-sort-=\"Hoover&quot;&quot;\" scope=\"row\" |Jacob\nCoxey\n| style=\"min-width:80px;\" |\n| style=\"background:#423121;\" |\n|Mayor of Massillon\n(1931)\n|\nOhio\n|\n|100,844\n(4.2%)\n|1\n|-\n!Royal C.\nJohnson\n|\n| style=\"background:#73638c;\" |\n|U.S. Representative\nfrom South Dakota\n(1915–1933)\n|\nSouth Dakota\n|\n|64,464\n(2.7%)\n|1\n|-\n!George W.\nNorris\n|\n| style=\"background:#5d73e5;\" |\n|U.S. Senator from Nebraska\n(1913–1943)\nU.S. Representative from NE-05\n(1903-1913)\n|\nNebraska\n|\n|139,514\n(5.8%)\n|1\n|}\nThe Primaries\nLittle-known former United States Senator Joseph I. France ran against Hoover in the primaries, but Hoover was often unopposed. France's primary wins were tempered by his defeat to Hoover in his home state of Maryland and the fact that few delegates to the national convention were chosen in the primaries.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

He was nominated on the first ballot with 98% of the delegate vote.\nThe tally was spectacularly lopsided:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Presidential Ballot, RNC 1932\n|-\n| Herbert Hoover || 1126.5\n|-\n| John J. Blaine || 13\n|-\n| Calvin Coolidge || 4.5\n|-\n| Joseph I. France || 4\n|-\n| James Wolcott Wadsworth, Jr. || 1\n|}\nBoth rural Republicans and hard-money Republicans (the latter hoping to nominate former President Calvin Coolidge) balked at the floor managers and voted against the renomination of Vice President Charles Curtis, who won with just 55% of the delegate votes.\nSee also\n*1932 Democratic Party presidential primaries\nReferences"
