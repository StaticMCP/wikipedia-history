Protests at the Sydney Opera House and Lakemba were criticised by New South Wales Premier Chris Minns and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese for alleged antisemitic rhetoric and violence.\nNotable pro-Palestinian protests and campaigns have included weekly marches in Melbourne, Jewish peace activists occupying the electorate office of Defence Minister Richard Marles, blockades at the Port of Melbourne and Port Botany, the establishment of protest encampments at several Australian universities, the Melbourne Land Forces Expo protests, and the Sydney Harbour Bridge protest. Other notable protest actions have included Qantas flight crew donning Palestinian flag badges.\nPro-Israel counter-protests have also been held in Sydney and Melbourne.\nTimeline of events\n2023\nOctober\n, Australia, 15 October]]\n, Australia, 21 October]]\nOn the night of 9 October, around 1,000 protesters attended a pro-Palestinian rally in Sydney, calling on the Australian government to end support to Israel. The protestors marched through the city's central business district to the Sydney Opera House, which had been lit up with the colors of the Israeli flag to create a space \"for Jews to mourn victims of the attacks in Israel\". A small group lit flares and burned Israeli flags.\nThe Premier of New South Wales, Chris Minns, claimed that the Sydney Opera House had been \"overrun with people that were spewing racial epithets and hatred\". The government later apologised for the protests, with police confirming that they are investigating the participants and seeking to press charges. Jewish people were advised to avoid the area, and a man near the protest with an Israeli flag was detained to prevent a breach of the peace. Several witnesses claimed that they also chanted \"Gas the Jews\", although according to a police expert audio analysis of video from the event that was initially believed to have shown that call instead showed chants of \"Where's the Jews\".\nAnother similar rally took place in the south-western suburb of Lakemba. Reports of violence and antisemitism emerged from the protests, which were criticized by politicians including Minns and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.\nOn 11 October, thousands gathered for a vigil held in Sydney showing support for Israel which was attended by a number of government officials.  On 20 October, pro-Palestinian demonstrators blocked the entryway to the US spy base in Pine Gap, Northern Territory, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. On 31 October, a group of Jewish activists occupied Defence Minister Richard Marles' office in Geelong, demanding an end to military support for Israel.\nNovember\nOn 8 November, activists laid themselves down on the Port of Melbourne to block cargo headed for Israel.\nOn 10 November, a fast food restaurant in Caulfield was burned down in a suspicious fire, after the owner Hash Tayeh was photographed leading a pro-Palestine rally in Melbourne. Following the burning of the restaurant, about 200 pro-Palestinian demonstrators affiliated with the Free Palestine Melbourne group staged a protest march in Caulfield, which led to the evacuation of a nearby synagogue. The pro-Palestine march triggered a counter-demonstration by about 200 pro-Israel supporters from the local Jewish community. Police kept the two groups apart but made no arrests.\nOn 12 November, thousands attended pro-Palestinian rallies calling for an immediate ceasefire in several Australian state capitals including Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane. In addition, pro-Israel rallies were held in Sydney and Melbourne calling for the release of Hamas-held hostages and to oppose anti-semitism.

Dvir Abramovich, the chairman of the Anti-Defamation Commission, criticised the cabin crew's conduct as intimidating, harassment and a violation of \"every rule of air travel\". An online petition calling for the dismissal of the cabin crew attracted 2,000 signatures. In response to media coverage, Qantas reiterated its policy against employees wearing unapproved badges on their uniforms.\n2024\nJanuary – March\nProtesters blocked an Israeli cargo ship from entering the Port of Melbourne on 22 January 2024.\nOn 2 February, protesters in Melbourne blocked the entrance to the factory that produces parts for Israel's F-35 military jets.\n, 26 April 2024]]\nApril – June\nOn 25 April students of the University of Sydney put up tents and shouted pro-Palestine slogans. After that, multiple other Australian universities set up encampments. On 8 May, Greens senator Dorinda Cox alleged she was \"manhandled\" by police while protesting as part of Students for Palestine WA at the Crown Perth casino and resort, where Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was speaking at a business breakfast, saying that the police told her group to move and allegedly shoved her into the crowd while she was speaking.\nOn 18 May, Trade Unionists for Palestine organised a protest at Melbourne's Moonee Valley Racecourse, which was hosting the Victorian Labor Party's State Conference. The protest action delayed planned speeches by Albanese and Premier of Victoria Jacinta Allan.\nOn 19 May, Palestinian solidarity protesters and the Christian Zionist group International Christian Embassy Jerusalem (ICEJ) held competing rallies outside the Victorian state parliament in Melbourne.

Organisers claimed about 350,000 attendees (including ~50,000 in Brisbane), while police estimated Brisbane’s crowd at closer to 10,000; police gave no figures for Sydney or Melbourne.\nMelbourne Land Forces Expo protests\nThe 2024 Land Forces protests, also known as Disrupt Land Forces, were a series of anti-war protests which took place from 8–13 September in Melbourne, Australia. Thousands of protesters occupied streets around the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre, where the 2024 Land Forces exhibition was taking place with the support of the Australian federal government and the Victorian state government.\nDisrupt Land Forces highlighted the links between Australian governments and the Israeli weapons industry, as part of ongoing opposition to Israel's attacks on Gaza. The Land Forces exhibition included weapons which have been deployed by Israel in Gaza. Protest organisers denounced the event as \"a cabal of war practitioners and war profiteers\".\nThe state government of Victoria deployed a large police contingent to defend Land Forces from protesters. According to Victoria Police, it was the largest single deployment of officers in the state since the S11 protests in 2000. 82 people were arrested in connection with the protests and over 150 were injured by police during the picket on 11 September.\nEvents\nStarting from 8 September, there were daily actions before and during the Land Forces conference. These were organised by various groups, as part of the Disrupt Land Forces coalition.\n7 September\nOn the afternoon of 7 September, a woman locked herself on to a car blocking the Montague St exit off the West Gate Freeway, blocking and delaying access to the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre. Protesters were chanting the “usual slogans”, including \"From the River to the Sea\" but were namely protesting against the upcoming Land Forces Expo. The woman was cut free by police and arrested. A second woman, who was reportedly the designated police liaison person for the protest group, was also arrested for ‘aiding and abetting’ the woman protesting.\n11 September\nBetween 4,000 and 5,000 protesters gathered from 6am for the first major demonstration, led by activist groups Students for Palestine and Disrupt Wars. Protestors blockaded entrances to the venue and disrupted attendees attempting to enter the weapons exhibition. Students for Palestine described the event as \"a beautiful, defiant day of protest and disruption\".\nOver 1,600 police were deployed to protect the weapons exhibition. Victoria Police have been accused of a police riot by legal observers, with excessive force and weaponry including rubber bullets and flash grenades being used against unarmed protesters. At least 100 people were injured by police violence, including at least one journalist and a photographer who required surgery after being hit in the ear by a rubber bullet. In anticipation of the event, police were granted extended powers under the Terrorism Act. Police alleged afterward that they had rocks, eggs, rotten tomatoes and horse manure thrown at them.\nBy the afternoon, after the protesters had largely dispersed, police had barricaded the Spencer Street Bridge to all road traffic.\nVictorian Greens MP Gabrielle De Vietri confirmed her attendance at the protest that morning. In response, Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan suggested that De Vietri should resign from her position.\n12 September\nOn the morning of the second day of the Land Forces expo, a group of protesters gathered and marched around the streets surrounding the exhibition centre, holding up peak hour morning traffic with police extending an exclusion zone outside the expo.\nIn the late afternoon, a large group of protesters gathered outside the Hanwha headquarters in the Melbourne CBD.\n13 September\nAustralian Greens Senator David Shoebridge greeted a small number of protesters at the Spencer St Beidge, which was still barricaded by police while also speaking to media. He criticised Victoria Police’s excessive use of force.\nReactions\n* Prime Minister of Australia Anthony Albanese condemned protesters for \"throwing things at police\".\n* Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police Shane Patton said of the protests “They come here to protest against war, so presumably anti-violence, and the only way I can describe them is a bunch of hypocrites. Their conduct today was absolutely appalling.”\n* Victorian Greens Leader Ellen Sandell called for an inquiry into excessive force used by police.\nBisalloy Steel Protests\nStarting 2023, protestors held a series of actions at Bisalloy Steel in Wollongong. These have included a sit-in and at least 9 pickets. Bisalloy Steel is Australia's only manufacturer of armour steel, which it exports to Israel. Protesters have alleged that this constitutes complicity in Israeli war crimes, while the company has emphasized the small proportion of its total business which goes to Israel. The pickets have shut down Bisalloy for up to 24 hours at a time.\nAn anti-Zionist Jewish protester was arrested for assault at an early sit-in action, though they were eventually found not guilty.\nThe protests have been attended by NSW Greens Senator David Shoebridge and MP Sue Higginson.\nReferences"
