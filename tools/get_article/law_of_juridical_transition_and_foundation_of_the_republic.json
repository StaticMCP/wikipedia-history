It was drafted to function as a provisional constitution in case 'yes' won the referendum and approved.\nThe law was passed by the Parliament of Catalonia on September 8, 2017 with 71 votes in favor (out of 135) from the ruling coalition JxSí and CUP-CC represented by 72 seats and 47.8% of the social vote support and out-ruling the previous consensus of the Estatut framework and Spanish Constitution; the left-wing opposition party CSQP voted against it and the other opposition parties left the chamber before the votes were cast which represented an opposition of 63 seats even a 48.05% of the social vote.\nThe law was suspended on September 12 by the Constitutional Court of Spain after accepting an appeal from the Spanish government.\nSee also\n*Law on the Referendum on Self-determination of Catalonia\n*2017 Catalan independence referendum\n*Catalan independence\n*Catalan Republic\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://dogc.gencat.cat/ca/pdogc_canals_interns/pdogc_resultats_fitxa/?action=fitxa&documentId=796643 Llei de transitorietat jurídica i fundacional de la República]\n*[http://exteriors.gencat.cat/web/.content/00_ACTUALITAT/notes_context/Law-on-Juridical-Transition.pdf Law on Juridical Transition]"
