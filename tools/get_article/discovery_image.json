This can include planets, dwarf planets, small Solar System bodies (asteroids, comets, etc.) or features found on or near those objects such as ring systems or large craters.\nFor example, a moon of Saturn, Phoebe, was the first satellite to be discovered photographically by William Henry Pickering on March 17, 1899 from photographic plates that had been taken starting on August 16, 1898 at Arequipa, Peru by DeLisle Stewart.\nExamples\nImage:Discovery Charon.jpg|1978 image of Pluto and Charon; the discovery image of Charon\nImage:S2004 S 3 - PIA06115.png|Discovery image of Saturn's still unconfirmed moon S/2004 S 3\nImage:Io Volcanism Discovery image.jpg|Discovery image of active volcanism on Io\nImage:S2004s2 040601.jpg|Discovery image of Pallene\nImage:Mars m04 11e.jpg|Mariner crater on Mars, as viewed by Mariner 4\nSee also\n*Precovery\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*[https://books.google.com/books?q=%22Discovery+image%22+astronomy&btnG=Search+Books Google Book Search : \"discovery image\" astronomy]"
