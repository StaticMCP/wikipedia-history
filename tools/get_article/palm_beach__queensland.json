In the , Palm Beach had a population of 16,349 people.\nGeography\nPalm Beach is bounded to the north by Tallebudgera Creek, to the east by the Coral Sea, to the south by Currumbin Creek, and to the west by the Pacific Motorway.\nPalm Beach has thrice been voted the cleanest beach in Queensland.\nCertainly subdivided by the mid-1950s the subdivision is unusual in the way in which it straddles both sides of the highway. Streets along the highway are named from first to twenty-eighth starting at the southern end of the area and each second one terminates at the highway. Between the beach and the highway in the southern part of the area the narrow Jefferson Lane links across streets. In this lane are some of the earliest and most basic of Gold Coast beach \"shacks\", some on blocks of land valued in millions of dollars. There is some suggestion that these in fact predate the subdivision and other remnants of an earlier settlement.\nRecent extensions of the Palm Beach area to the west have created new subdivisions with different characteristics including a small section of canal development. The area is bounded to the north by the Tallebudgera Creek and the national recreation camp and to the south by tower developments at the mouth of Currumbin Creek. The creek mouths of Tallebudgera and Currumbin have been stabilised with training walls built during the 1970s. Both of the Creek entrances are dredged on an annual basis. There are nearshore bait reefs along Palm Beach and offshore there are fishing reefs that are some of the most productive of the Gold Coast.\nLaguna Lake is in the south western part of the suburb, with Elizabeth Sloper Gardens park around its edges. The Tallebudgera Creek Tourist Park, at the northern end of Palm Beach, provides holiday accommodation mainly for families. The adjacent Tallebudgera Recreational Camp is a national fitness camp visited by children from throughout Queensland.\nCoastal management structures at Palm Beach include training walls at Currumbin and Tallebudgera Creek entrances and mini groynes at 11th and 21st Avenues. The Gold Coast Oceanway is of particularly poor quality through Palm Beach due to the majority of the beachfront being effectively in private ownership. Recent loss of sand due to unusual weather and tidal patterns has caused some houses along the beachfront to lose their yards to the erosion.\nHistory\nPalm Beach Baptist Church opened on Saturday 8 December 1928. It was the first church opened in Palm Beach. It was on Ninth Avenue. In 1969 the original building was demolished and replaced with a brick building.
