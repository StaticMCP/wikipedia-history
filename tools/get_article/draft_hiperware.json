It was developed by HiPer it!, a company within the BPS International Group, a German provider of building information modelling (BIM) and lifecycle-management technologies. The platform combines high-frequency industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) data with cloud analytics and machine-learning tools to monitor, analyse, and improve energy use and technical processes across sectors, including real estate, manufacturing, and retail.\nOverview\nHiPerWare functions as a commissioning and optimisation system for building equipment. It can operate independently or in conjunction with traditional Building Management Systems (BMS) and SCADA platforms. Installations are designed for rapid setup, and data can be sampled as frequently as once per second to support diagnostics and benchmarking. Data collected from energy, water, temperature, vibration, and electrical sensors are linked to digital-twin representations of building components. These can be visualised on BIM models, process and instrumentation diagrams (P&ID), single-line schematics, or 360-degree panoramic images.\nDevelopment and background\nThe BPS International Group, founded in 2009, focuses on BIM and industrial IoT solutions for the real-estate lifecycle. According to press releases and trade-fair materials, HiPerWare version 2.0 was introduced at EXPO REAL 2021 in Munich, described as a significant step in digitalised facility management.\nThe platform architecture employs on-premises data-acquisition units (“Power Connect”, “Sensor Connect”, “Meter Connect”, and “Cloud Connect Gateway”) that transmit operational data to cloud analytics and AI modules. These modules perform anomaly detection and predictive maintenance, with results displayed in dashboards and trend-analysis interfaces. A conversational assistant, HiPerBot, enables natural-language queries across project data.\nCapabilities\nDocumented features include high-frequency data collection for multiple environmental and mechanical variables; integration of BIM models, panoramic imagery, and engineering diagrams; open-API access for third-party tools such as ESG reporting or CMMS platforms; and AI-based detection of inefficiencies with root-cause analysis.\nAccording to independent publications on BIM in operations, combining BIM with HiPerWare creates a long-term digital record of technical systems, which can support reductions in operating costs and energy consumption.\nRecognition\nHiPerWare is used in commercial property, manufacturing, and energy-management contexts and is recognised by Germany’s Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control (BAFA) as an eligible energy-management system.\nIn 2023, BPS International and HiPerWare received the Green BIM Award at BIM-Tage Deutschland in the category “Messbar: Gebäudebestand und Infrastruktur”, acknowledging their contribution to sustainable and digital building operations.\nApplications in projects\nHiPerWare has been implemented in various projects. At the Dubai Dolphinarium, IIoT sensors were installed on pumps and filters to stream real-time operational data into HiPerWare dashboards, enabling the monitoring of electrical and mechanical systems and improving reliability and energy efficiency.\nWithin an office complex operated by BPS Internatioanl Group, the platform was used to integrate IoT data into the building’s BIM model for live anomaly detection and maintenance scheduling, reportedly achieving reductions in energy use and carbon emissions.\nHiPerWare also served as a technological component in Enerbuild, an EU-sponsored initiative led by the Island Energy Council of Gran Canaria (CIEGC) aimed at reducing climate impacts through smart-building and IoT systems. The project combined HiPerWare with the Infraspeak maintenance platform to analyse and monitor building-supply systems through big-data collection."
