Engineer Jack Eastman claims he thought of the display after seeing a toaster in a kitchen during a late-night programming session and imagining the addition of wings, although the winged toasters bear a strong resemblance to those on the cover of Jefferson Airplane’s 1973 album Thirty Seconds Over Winterland. A slider in the Flying Toasters module enabled users to adjust the toast's darkness, and an updated Flying Toasters Pro module added a choice of music—Richard Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries or a flying toaster anthem with optional karaoke lyrics.  Yet another version named Flying Toasters! added bagels and pastries, baby toasters, and more elaborate toaster animation. The Flying Toasters were one of the main reasons that After Dark became popular, and Berkeley began to produce other merchandising products such as T-shirts with the Flying Toaster image and slogans such as \"The 51st Flying Toaster Squadron: On a mission to save your screen!\"\nThe toasters were the subject of two lawsuits, the first in 1993, Berkeley Systems vs Delrina Corporation, concerning a module of Delrina's screensaver ''Opus 'N Bill'' in which Opus the penguin shoots down the toasters. After a U.S. District judge ruled that Delrina's \"Death Toasters\" was infringing, Delrina later changed the wings of the toasters to propellers. The second case was brought in 1994 by 1960s rock group Jefferson Airplane who claimed that the toasters were a copy of the winged toasters featured on the cover of their 1973 record album Thirty Seconds Over Winterland. The case was dismissed because the cover art had not been registered as a trademark by the group prior to Berkeley Systems' release of the screensaver.\nA 3D version of the toasters featuring swarms of toasters with airplane wings, rather than bird wings, is available for XScreenSaver.\nHistory\nIn 1997, Berkeley Systems was acquired by the Sierra On-Line division of CUC International. Joan Blades and Wes Boyd, the founders of Berkeley Systems, later created MoveOn.org. Ed Fries, co-developer of the popular Fish! screensaver, became vice president of game publishing at Microsoft.\nThe Bad Dog TV series, based on the After Dark module of the same name, was produced by CinéGroupe and Saban Entertainment for the Teletoon and Fox Family Channel networks that was first broadcast by Teletoon on March 1, 1999.\nAn official version of After Dark was released for Mac OS X running on PowerPC by Infinisys, Ltd. of Japan in May 2003. For Apple silicon and Intel Macs, remakes of three popular modules — \"Flying Toasters\", \"Mowing Man\" and \"Boris\" — are available as standalone screensavers.\nSierra released an After Dark: Flying Toaster video game for cellphones in 2006.\nSierra Entertainment was eventually acquired by Vivendi Games, which later merged with Activision to form Activision Blizzard, which was subsequently acquired by Microsoft.\nAfter Dark Games\nSierra Attractions and Berkeley Systems released After Dark Games in 1998 for the Macintosh and Windows platforms, which contained several games modeled after their previously released screensavers. These games included ''Mowin' Maniac (a Pac-Man'' clone based on the \"Mowin' Man\" and \"Mowin' Boris\" modules); Roof Rats (similar to SameGame and variants); Solitaire (After Dark themed); Toaster Run (an isometric Glider clone featuring several After Dark characters, including a Flying Toaster and Super Guy); Zapper (a trivia game); Hula Girl (an endless 2D platforming game based on the \"Hula Twins\" module); two word scramble games, Bad Dog 911 (based on the \"Bad Dog\" modules) and Fish Shtick (based on the \"Fish\" modules, mainly \"Fish World\"); Foggy Boxes (a dots and boxes game based on the \"Messages 4.0\" module); MooShu Tiles (a Mahjong-like game featuring many After Dark characters throughout the years); and Rodger Dodger (a Raimais clone that originated as an in-module game).\nJ.C. Herz of The New York Times wrote that the \"sheer simplicity\" of these games helped make them as \"engaging and addictive as the mega-selling 40-hour sagas with souped-up 3-D sound and state-of-the-art computer graphics\". A review in Computer Gaming World stated that, \"If nothing else, it makes for a good time-killer.\"\nModules\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Module Name\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Description\n|-\n| Starry Night\n| The default screen saver, featuring a pixelated city skyline under a night sky\n|-\n| Artist\n| A digital artist applies artistic touches to images in a slow manner so one can see the artist's work\n|-\n| Bad Dog\n| Popular module featuring a white dog with a black ring around one of his eyes, causing trouble on the desktop (the animated series Bad Dog was inspired by the eponymous screensaver)\n|-\n| Bad Dog!\n| A sequel to Bad Dog with new animations and sequences\n|-\n| Bogglins\n| Green slime creatures are formed and make obnoxious noises\n|-\n| Boris\n| The opposite of Bad Dog, a good cat plays on the desktop and chases butterflies\n|-\n| Bouncing Ball\n| A ball bounces around the screen, including bouncing off the edges\n|-\n| Bugs\n| Digital bugs crawl across the screen\n|-\n| Bulge\n| Expands portions of the screen, making the screen appear to have a \"bulge\"\n|-\n| Bungee Roulette\n| Various characters bungee-jump from the top of the screen, but occasionally the bungee cord breaks\n|-\n| Can of Worms\n| \"Worms\" emerge from the screen, crawl around, and \"eat\" the screen content\n|-\n| Chameleon\n| Chameleons walk across the screen, changing colors and eating icons\n|-\n| Clocks\n| Different objects appear as a clock and move around\n|-\n| Coming Soon!\n| A salesperson pitches fictitious \"products\"\n|-\n| Confetti Factory\n| Confetti falls from the top of the screen and onto conveyor belts below\n|-\n| Daredevil Dan\n| A daredevil motorcyclist attempts dangerous jumps over school buses, flames, and piranha tanks\n|-\n| Dominoes\n| A game of dominoes is played on the screen\n|-\n| Doodles\n| Draws doodle-like images\n|-\n| DOS Shell\n| A mock DOS shell is run on the screen, reliving earlier days of computing\n|-\n| Dots\n| A game of \"dots\" is played on the screen\n|-\n| Down the Drain\n| The desktop appears to spiral down a drain\n|-\n| Einstein\n| Complex mathematical and scientific equations are performed on the screen\n|-\n| Fade Away\n| The desktop fades away in different ways\n|-\n| Fish!
