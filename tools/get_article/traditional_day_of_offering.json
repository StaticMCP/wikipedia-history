It is said that the Trongsa Penlop led the representatives of Sharchog Khorlo Tsibgye (Eight Spokes of the Wheel of Eastern Bhutan), Paro Penlop led the people of western Bhutan and Darkar Penlop led the people of the south in their offerings to Zhabdrung. Due to its significance, Zhabdrung chose this day as the time to change the officials of his new government and monastic body in Punakha. The day is regarded as the old Bhutanese New Year Day as the day was chosen by Zhabdrung himself. Since then, the auspicious day is observed as a Traditional Day of Offering.\nSignificance\nTraditional Day of Offering is regarded as the real Bhutanese New Year. It is the day that the representatives from Bhutan offered buelwa to Zhabdrung at Punakha Dzong. The day is observed to remember Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, who united Bhutan.
