In response, the unionist general José Trinidad Cabañas immediately ordered the movement of troops, commanded by General Eusebio Toro and General Ciriaco Braan y Carrascosa, for the defense of the inhabitants and their properties.  After General Cordero was cornered, he retreated to Guatemala, defeated. 300 soldiers of the Guatemalan army invaded Honduras, but the liberal forces of José Trinidad Cabañas, composed of 107 soldiers plus two officers, stopped the invasion, which caused a victory for the Honduran Army, the first in its history.\nReferences"
