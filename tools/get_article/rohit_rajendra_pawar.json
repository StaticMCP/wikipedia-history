He belongs to the politically influential Pawar family.\nEarly life and family\nRohit Pawar was born to Rajendra Pawar and Sunanda Pawar in Baramati, Maharashtra on 29 September 1985.\nHe is the grandson of Dinkarrao Govindrao Pawar and the grandnephew of prominent Indian politician and former union agriculture minister of India, Sharad Pawar. He completed his schooling from Vidya Prathisthan, Baramati. He graduated with a Bachelor of Management Studies from University of Mumbai in 2007. Rohit Pawar is married to Kunti Pawar. The couple has two children.\nBusiness career\nHe is the CEO of Baramati Agro. He served as the President of the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) from September 2018 to 2019.\nPolitical career\nRohit began his political career by contesting and winning the Pune Zilla Parishad elections from the Shirsuphal-Gunawadi constituency in Baramati taluka, Pune, in 2017. During the 2019 Indian General Elections, he actively campaigned for the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), leveraging his family's political influence and his grassroots connections.\nIn October 2019, Pawar was elected to the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly from the Karjat-Jamkhed constituency, defeating the incumbent BJP candidate and cabinet minister Ram Shinde with a significant margin of 135,824 votes. This victory marked a significant political milestone, as the constituency had been a BJP stronghold for 25 years.\nAs an MLA, Pawar has focused on addressing the socio-economic issues of his constituency. He established the Karjat-Jamkhed Integrated Development Foundation (KJIDF) to tackle local development challenges and improve the quality of life for residents. Additionally, he founded the Srujan Foundation, which organizes various events and competitions to engage and empower the youth.\nPawar has been actively involved in campaigning for various elections, including the Vidhan Sabha, Zilla Parishad, and Panchayat elections, over the past few years. His efforts have helped raise the profile of the Karjat-Jamkhed constituency on the socio-political map of Maharashtra.\nIn addition to his legislative work, Pawar has been considered a potential contender for leadership roles within the NCP, given his close relationship with his granduncle, Sharad Pawar, and his growing influence within the party. He is from the fourth generation of the Pawar family to hold public office.\nMaharashtra Cricket Association\nPawar was elected unopposed as the president of the Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA).\nRohit has been serving as the President of the Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) since 2022. The MCA is the governing body for cricket in the state of Maharashtra, India, and is affiliated with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). Under Pawar's leadership, the MCA has focused on infrastructure development and talent identification. In 2023, the association launched its own franchise-based T20 league, the Maharashtra Premier League (MPL), featuring six teams. The league aims to promote cricket at the grassroots level in Maharashtra.\nDuring Pawar's tenure, the MCA has also entered into partnerships to improve facilities and support young cricketers in the state. In November 2023, the association announced a five-year deal with the Punit Balan Group and Manikchand Oxyrich as its main partners, worth Rs. five crore per season. This partnership is expected to help the MCA provide better facilities, develop infrastructure, implement welfare schemes, and focus on grassroots development in remote areas of the state.\nElection results\n2024\n2019\n}}\nSee also\n* Sharad Pawar\n* Supriya Sule\n* Ajit Pawar\n* Sunanda Pawar\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
