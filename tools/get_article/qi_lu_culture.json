The Qi–Lu Cultural District is centered around the Taiyi Mountains and encompasses the region east of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal in present-day Shandong Province, northern Jiangsu Province, and the Liaodong Peninsula. This cultural area aligns with the Jiaoliao Mandarin District and the Jilu Mandarin Districts within Shandong Province.\nTo the west, it is bordered by the Grand Canal and the Central Plains Culture, while to the south, it is adjacent to the Jianghuai Culture in the Jianghuai Mandarin District. Qilu culture can be further divided into two subregions: \"Western Lu culture\" and \"Jiaodong culture.\"\nComposition\nQi–Lu culture is deeply connected to Guan Zhong and Confucius. Their influence played a crucial role in shaping its origins, laying a strong foundation for the subsequent flourishing of Qilu culture.\nQi culture\nState of Qi is located in the northeast part of Shandong, with capital in Linzi, Zibo. Guan Zhong was a statesman and philosopher from the state of Qi, as well as a prominent representative of Legalism during the Spring and Autumn Period. His key ideas were later compiled and recorded in the book Guanzi by subsequent generations.\nLu culture\nState of Lu was located in the southwest part of Shandong, with capital in Qufu, Jining. Confucius, an educator and philosopher from the state of Lu, was the founder of Confucianism. His teachings on benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust had a profound and lasting impact.\nArea\nThe Qi–Lu Cultural District is centered around the Taiyi Mountains, and its scope roughly includes the area east of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal in present-day Shandong Province, northern Jiangsu Province, and the Liaodong Peninsula. It corresponds to the Jiaoliao Mandarin District as well as the Hebei and Shandong Mandarin Districts in Shandong Province.\nTo the west, it is bounded by the Grand Canal and the Central Plains Culture; to the south, it is adjacent to the Jianghuai Culture in the Jianghuai Mandarin District. To the north, it stretches across the Bohai Strait, and in the Liaodong Peninsula, it borders the Northeastern Culture in the Northeast Mandarin District.\nHistory\n\" unearthed from Yinqueshan Han Tomb]]\nThe prehistoric culture of Shandong, known as Dongyi culture, is one of the oldest civilizations in China. The characters of the Dongyi people are believed to be one of the important sources of oracle bone inscriptions from the Shang dynasty. Characters such as \"Dan,\" \"Jin,\" \"Huang,\" \"Feng,\" \"Jiu,\" and \"Pai\" are still in use today.\nAccording to Chinese classics, the Dongyi people invented the bow and arrow and possessed advanced pottery-making technology. They were also the first tribe in China to use copper and iron. Research on Longshan culture suggests that the Dongyi people were the inventors of rituals, signifying the development of their social hierarchy and the establishment of early states.\nChinese archaeologist Yu Weichao has noted that \"if it were not for the great flood more than 4,000 years ago, the Dongyi people might have established China’s earliest dynasty.\"\nFrom the founding of the states of Qi and Lu in the early Western Zhou dynasty to the Spring and Autumn Period, the Qi culture (Jiaodong culture) and Lu culture (Western Lu culture) gradually took shape. Qi culture was primarily influenced by Dongyi culture, with Zhou culture as a secondary influence, whereas Lu culture was predominantly shaped by Zhou culture, supplemented by elements of Dongyi culture.\nQi culture was characterized by its utilitarian and rational approach, which led to the emergence of numerous intellectual traditions and figures. These included military strategists such as Sun Wu and Sun Bin, astronomers like Gan De and Zou Yan, medical scientists like Bian Que, logicians like Gongsun Long, and Yin-Yang school represented by Zou Yan. Additionally, it fostered Taoists, renowned scholars, legalists, peasants, politicians, and other pragmatic schools of thought.\nIn contrast, Lu culture emphasized etiquette and feudalism, with Confucianism advocating for the restoration of feudal hierarchies and societal order. However, opposing schools of thought also arose, such as Mohism, which promoted logic and stood in opposition to Confucian ideals.\nDuring the Warring States Period, Qi culture began to dominate over Lu culture, with Legalism and Mohism playing a significant role in shaping its intellectual landscape.\nDuring the Han dynasty, Emperor Wu officially recognized the Confucian system. Following the policy of \"deposing hundreds of schools of thought and respecting Confucianism alone,\" Confucianism became the cornerstone of China's social framework and values.\nAt the end of the Eastern Han dynasty, two prominent Confucian scholars, He Xiu and Zheng Xuan, emerged from Shandong. During the Eastern Jin and Southern dynasties, many renowned noble families who resettled south of the Yangtze River, such as the Langya Wang family, the Lanling Xiao family, the Gaoping Xi family, the Langya Yan family, and the Taiyang family, originated from the Qilu region.\nAfter the Wei and Jin dynasties, however, Qilu culture gradually lost its independence.\nFeature\nLiterature\nIn August 2011, Mo Yan's novel Frog won the 8th Mao Dun Literature Award. On 11 October 2012, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for his \"fusion of folk tales, history, and contemporary times with hallucinatory realism,\" becoming the first writer from the People's Republic of China to receive this honor.\nArt\nRepresentative works of Shandong folk songs include Liang Fu Yin from the Han dynasty, Bai Xue Yiyin from the Qing dynasty, and the modern Yimeng Mountain Minor. Local folk art forms feature , Shandong Kuaishu, and Lu opera.\nReligion\nThe main religions currently practiced in Shandong Province are Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism, and Christianity (Protestantism).\nBuddhism and Taoism have a history of over a thousand years in Shandong. Islam began to develop in the region after Hui Muslims migrated there in the 13th century. Catholicism and Christianity spread rapidly, primarily following the Opium War.\nIn 1990, Shandong Province had 1.2&nbsp;million religious believers, 3,040 religious activity sites, and 2,578 religious personnel.\nLanguage\nThe Shandong dialect classification by Qian Zengyi and Li Rong.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; float: right;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Eastern District\n! colspan=\"2\" |West District\n|-\n|Donglai District\n|Dongwei District\n|Xiqi District\n|Xilu District\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Jiaoliao Mandarin\n|Jilu Mandarin\n|Central Plains Mandarin\n|}\nThe Shandong region features diverse dialects, with variations in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar. Scholars such as Qian Zengyi classified the Shandong dialect into two major areas and four sub-districts, while Li Rong divided it into three areas: Jilu Mandarin, Jiaoliao Mandarin, and Central Plains Mandarin.\nThe Shandong dialect spoken by Hou Baolin belongs to Jiaoliao Mandarin, whereas the Shandong dialect used in Shandong Kuaishu falls under Hebei-Shandong Mandarin. The Mandarin dialects of Hebei and Shandong include subcategories such as the Liaotai group (e.g., Jinan dialect), and the Huang Le group (e.g., Wudi dialect). The Central Plains Mandarin dialects include the Jining and Zaozhuang dialects.\nThe Jiaodong dialect is more complex and closely resembles the Dalian and Dandong dialects of Liaoning. It belongs to Jiaoliao Mandarin, which is the most distinct dialect group from standard Mandarin in East China. Jiaoliao Mandarin includes the Denglian, Qinglai, and Yingtong subgroups, with approximately 30 million speakers. The Qinglai subgroup is further divided into four smaller areas: the Qingdao area, Qingqu area, Laichang area, and Juzhao area.\nFolk customs\nShandong folk customs are divided into two styles: Qi and Lu. Qi customs reflect the cultural traditions of Dongyi, showing less influence from clan structures and Zhou rituals, with some elements of a developing commodity economy. Lu customs, on the other hand, were shaped by Zhou rites, focusing more on structured practices and agricultural life.\nCultural characteristics vary across the region. The Shandong Plain is known for its farming culture, with Weifang kites and Yangjiabu New Year paintings being prominent examples.\nThe Jiaodong coastal area features fishing customs that are lively and straightforward.\nThe western Shandong region is notable for its strong traditions and its association with Confucius and Mencius.\nDiet\nShandong cuisine ranks first among the four major cuisines in China and has been famous since the Spring and Autumn period. After the Song dynasty, it became a representative of northern cuisine. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, Shandong cuisine was the mainstay of royal cuisine and became very popular in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, and Northeast China, having a significant impact.\nShandong cuisine can be divided into three main styles: Jinan cuisine, Jiaodong cuisine, and Kongfu cuisine. Jinan cuisine is known for its expertise in roasting, deep-frying, and stir-frying, with a stronger, richer flavor. Jiaodong cuisine, originating from coastal areas such as Fushan, Yantai, and Qingdao, specializes in seafood, emphasizing fresh, tender, and light flavors that focus on the natural taste of the ingredients. Kongfu cuisine is renowned worldwide for its exquisite ingredients, fine preparation, unique style, and distinctive flavor.\nTraditional Shandong dishes include sweet and sour Yellow River carp, roasted sea cucumber with green onion, Mushu meat, grilled abalone in its shell, nine-turn large intestine, fried lotus, Jinan roast duck, carrot sweet potato, and Sixi meatballs. Additionally, \"Dezhou Braised Chicken Production Technique\" and \"Longkou Vermicelli Traditional Handmade Production Technique\" are recognized as national intangible cultural heritages.\nShandong is also renowned for its wine culture and emphasis on etiquette. In a formal setting, the person with the highest rank in the guest party is called the \"host\" and sits directly opposite the door. To the right of the host sits the \"guest of honor,\" the highest-ranking guest, while the \"deputy guest of honor\" sits to the left. The \"secondary waiter\" sits opposite the main waiter, with their back to the door, and is primarily responsible for encouraging guests to drink. Serving food, pouring tea, and pouring wine all begin with the guest of honor.\nShandong's wine culture has a long history. The Yantai Changyu Winemaking Company, founded by Qing dynasty industrialist Zhang Bishi in 1892, is now the largest wine producer in China and Asia, and the tenth-largest wine producer in the world. The company produces four wine series: wine, brandy, champagne, and health wine, with hundreds of products. Wine estates and wine culture museums have become popular destinations for cultural tourism, leisure, and sightseeing.\nFestival\n]]\nFestivals in Shandong are divided into traditional festivals and emerging festivals. Most emerging festivals are national events, such as New Year's Day, Women's Day, and Arbor Day. Since the reform and opening up, many new festivals and conferences have been established throughout Shandong, collectively referred to as \"emerging festivals.\" These festivals aim to promote the local economy and tourism and include the Confucius Cultural Festival, Rongcheng Fishermen's Festival, Qingdao International Beer Festival, Zibo Ceramics Glaze Art Festival, and various cultural and art festivals.\nEducation\nEducation system: Shandong's education system follows China's national education policy, which includes nine-year compulsory education, high school education, higher education, and other levels of education.\nBasic education: Shandong Province places a strong emphasis on basic education, including primary and junior high school education.
