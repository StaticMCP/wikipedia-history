It has a fractional sloop rig or unstayed catboat rig with a tall mast, an optional bowsprit, a nearly plumb stem, a slightly angled transom, a transom-hung rudder controlled by a tiller and a fixed shoal-draft wing keel. It displaces  and carries  of ballast.\nThe boat has a draft of  with the standard keel.\nThe boat is normally fitted with a small  outboard motor for docking and maneuvering.\nThe design has sleeping accommodation for four people, with a double \"V\"-berth in the bow cabin and two straight settee berths in the main cabin. The galley is located on both sides just aft of the bow cabin. The galley is equipped with a stove to port and a sink to starboard. The head is located in the bow cabin, centered aft, under the \"V\"-berth. Cabin headroom is .\nThe design has a hull speed of .\nOperational history\nIn a 2010 review Steve Henkel wrote, \"designer Hake has taken the same basic beamy hull that he created in 1979 with the Slipper Deckhouse 17  ... spruced her up with fancier oval ports and other gear, increased some of her dimensions slightly. and changed her name. For a while she was available with either a sloop rig or a very tall cat rig (bridge clearance 33' for the cat, 8' less for the sloop) ... Best features: We think she's relatively good-looking, with springy sheer, pronounced tumblehome, molded bulwarks, and nice fittings such as shiny stainless opening oval ports and cowl vent on the cabintop. Her self-bailing cockpit is deep and comfortable for two people, and her interior is relatively spacious considering her modest LOD; her Space Index is highest of her comp[etitor]s. The rotating freestanding carbon-fiber mast is 28' 6\" long, weighs only 33 pounds, and is secured by a two-footlong sliding aluminum tube inside the mast, which couples the upper mast to a rotating mast bearing on the deck, It is claimed that the vessel takes less than five minutes to rig at a boat ramp, Worst features: Her shallow fixed keel, despite the small wings, prevents pointing as high as her comp[etitor]s, especially in light air.\"\nSee also\n*List of sailing boat types\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_ooPKye5k0 Video of sailing a Seaward Fox]"
