The bill was introduced in the Legislative Assembly by Premier Jacinta Allan and was read a first time on 9 September 2025.\nHistory\nContents of bill\nThe bill is divided into a preamble and 21 parts. Part 1 deals with preliminary matters, including the purposes of the Act, commencement dates, definitions and effects on parliamentary privilege. Part 2 establishes Gellung Warl as a public authority consisting of three arms: the First Peoples' Assembly, Nginma Ngainga Wara and Nyerna Yoorrook Telkuna. Parts 3 to 8 deals with matters establishing and concerning the First Peoples' Assembly. Part 9 establishes Nginma Ngainga Wara, an accountability body monitoring the actions of the state government relating to First Peoples. Part 10 establishes Nyerna Yoorrook Telkuna, a body set up to provide for ongoing truth-telling and healing for First Peoples, continuing on the role of the now-dissolved Yoorrook Justice Commission.\nParts 11 to 15 deal with administrative matters, including data sharing and privacy, financial matters (including ongoing special appropriations), and accountability and complaints mechanisms. Part 16 provides for the dissolution of the First Peoples' Assembly by its own resolution, or by community petition or the Treaty Authority, and for early elections. Part 17 imposes additional requirements on the Parliament when amending or repealing this Act. Parts 18 and 19 sets out transitional provisions, and parts 20 and 21 makes consequential amendments to existing Acts.\nSee also\n* Indigenous treaties in Australia\n* First Peoples' Assembly of Victoria\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* [https://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/bills/statewide-treaty-bill-2025 Statewide Treaty Bill 2025] (Vic)\n*\n*\n* [https://www.treatyvictoria.vic.gov.au/sites/default/files/2025-09/Final_Victoria%27s-Treaty-Information-Pack.pdf Victoria's Treaty: Information Pack]\n:Category:Victoria (state) legislation\n:Category:2025 in Australian law\n:Category:2025 in Victoria (state)\n:Category:Indigenous Australian politics\n:Category:Indigenous Australian law\n:Category:Treaties with indigenous peoples"
