Songwriters can only apply for a certificate if it is a new song.\nSince the 55th Annual Grammy Awards in 2013, mastering engineers are considered nominees and award recipients in this category.\nAlthough \"record\" often refers to any recording of music, Record of the Year differs from Song of the Year or Album of the Year:\n* Record of the Year is awarded for a single or for one track from an album. This award goes to the performing artist, the producer, recording engineer and/or mixer for that song. In this sense, \"record\" means a particular recorded song, not its composition or an album of songs.\n* Song of the Year is also awarded for a single or individual track, but the recipient of this award is the songwriter who actually wrote the lyrics and/or melodies to the song. \"Song\" in this context means the song as composed, not its recording.\n* Album of the Year is awarded for a whole album, and the award is presented to the artist, songwriter, producer, recording engineer, and mastering engineer for that album. In this context, \"album\" means a recorded collection of songs (a multi-track LP, CD, or download package), not the individual songs or their compositions.\nHistory and description\nThe Record of the Year awards have been awarded since 1959. It is one of the four most prestigious Grammy Awards. Despite both the Song of the Year award and Record of the Year being awarded for a single or for one track from an album, this award goes to the performer and production team of the song whereas the Song of the Year award goes only to the composer(s) of the song. According to the 54th Grammy Awards description guide, the award is given for commercially released singles or tracks of new vocal or instrumental recordings. Tracks from a previous year's album may be entered provided the track was not entered the previous year and provided the album did not win a Grammy Award to the artist(s), producer(s), recording engineer(s) and/or mixer(s) if other than the artist. Associate producers and executive producers are not eligible\".\nThe honorees through its history have been:\n*1959–1965: Artist only.\n*1966–1998: Artist and producer.\n*1999–2012: Artist, producer, recording engineer and mixing engineer\n*2013–present: Artist, producer, recording engineer, mixing engineer and mastering engineer\nThe category has expanded to include eight nominees in 2019.\nAchievements\nTom Coyne holds the record for most wins in this category as a mastering engineer at four times (2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018) and was the only person to win the award four consecutive years. Only two artists have won three times: Paul Simon (\"Mrs. Robinson\" in 1969, \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" in 1971, both as part of Simon & Garfunkel; and \"Graceland\" in 1988) and Bruno Mars (\"Uptown Funk\" in 2016, with Mark Ronson; \"24K Magic\" in 2018; and \"Leave the Door Open\" in 2022, as part of Silk Sonic). Four engineers/mixers have won the award three times Tom Elmhirst has won three times as an engineer/mixer (2008, 2012 and 2017), Serban Ghenea (2016, 2018 and 2022), John Hanes (2016, 2018 and 2022), and Charles Moniz (2016, 2018 and 2022)\nRoberta Flack was the first artist to win Record of the Year in two consecutive years: in 1973 (\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\") and 1974 (\"Killing Me Softly with His Song\") from two different studio albums. This happened again when U2 won in 2001 (\"Beautiful Day\") and 2002 (\"Walk On\"), the only occurrence of an artist winning the award in two consecutive years with records from the same album. Billie Eilish became the first musician ever to complete the feat with recordings from a studio album, as well as a non-album single: in 2020 (\"Bad Guy\") and 2021 (\"Everything I Wanted\").\nOther artists to receive multiple Grammys for Record of the Year are Henry Mancini (\"Moon River\" and \"Days of Wine and Roses\"); Simon & Garfunkel (\"Mrs. Robinson\" and \"Bridge over Troubled Water\"); The 5th Dimension (\"Up, Up and Away\" and \"Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In\"); Eric Clapton (\"Tears in Heaven\" and \"Change the World\"); Norah Jones (\"Don't Know Why\" and \"Here We Go Again\"); Adele (\"Rolling in the Deep\" and \"Hello\").\nMark Ronson is the only performer to win the award both as the main credit artist and as a record producer, winning as lead artist for his respective song, \"Uptown Funk\" (featuring Bruno Mars); and as a producer for \"Rehab\" by Amy Winehouse.\nBeyoncé is the most nominated artist for Record of the Year with nine nominations. Beyoncé also has the most Record of the Year nominations among female artists with nods for \"Say My Name\" as part of Destiny's Child and eight times as a solo act with \"Crazy in Love\" (featuring Jay-Z), \"Irreplaceable\", \"Halo\", \"Formation\", \"Black Parade\", \"Savage\" (with Megan Thee Stallion), \"Break My Soul\" and \"Texas Hold 'Em\"; however, she is yet to win one. Bruno Mars is the most nominated male artist with eight nominations for \"Nothin' on You\" as a featured artist, CeeLo Green's \"Fuck You\" as a producer, \"Grenade\", \"Locked Out of Heaven\", \"Uptown Funk\" as a featured artist with Mark Ronson, \"24K Magic\", “Leave the Door Open” as part of Silk Sonic and “Apt.” (with Rosé). The Beatles have the most Record of the Year nominations as a group, with five nominations: \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\", \"Yesterday\", \"Hey Jude\", \"Let It Be\" and \"Now and Then\"; but never won the award.\nFrank Sinatra holds the record for most consecutive years being nominated for Record of the Year, with four. Additionally, Roberta Flack, Steve Winwood, Post Malone, Billie Eilish, and Doja Cat are the only artists to receive three consecutive nominations for Record of the Year, with Eilish achieving it twice.\nThe first woman to win the award was Astrud Gilberto in 1965, for \"The Girl from Ipanema\" (with Stan Getz). Roberta Flack was the first female artist to win the award twice. Flack, Norah Jones, Adele, and Billie Eilish are the only women to win the award more than once for their recordings, winning for \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\" and \"Killing Me Softly with His Song\"; and \"Don't Know Why\" and \"Here We Go Again\" (with Ray Charles); and \"Rolling in the Deep\" and \"Hello\"; and \"Bad Guy\" and \"Everything I Wanted\", respectively (Flack was also nominated for \"Feel Like Makin' Love\"; Adele nominated for \"Chasing Pavements\" and \"Easy on Me\"; and Eilish nominated for \"Happier Than Ever\", \"What Was I Made For?\", \"Birds of a Feather” and “Wildflower”). Additionally, both Florence LaRue and Marilyn McCoo also receive this accolade twice as part of The 5th Dimension, for \"Up, Up and Away\" and \"Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In\".\n”U Can’t Touch This” by MC Hammer was the first rap song to be nominated, while “This is America” by Childish Gambino and “Not Like Us” by Kendrick Lamar are the only winners. Lamar is also the most nominated rapper with five nominations for “Humble”, “All the Stars”, “The Heart Part 5”, “Not Like Us” and “Luther”. M.I.A., Iggy Azalea, Cardi B, Doja Cat, Megan Thee Stallion and Doechii, are the only female rappers to be nominated for the award, with Doja Cat receiving three consecutive nominations, for “Say So”, “Kiss Me More” and “Woman”.\nIn 1959, Domenico Modugno became the first artist to win for a foreign-language song for \"Volare\" in 1959, also the first Italian to win the award. In 1965, Astrud Gilberto became the first Brazilian to win the award for \"The Girl from Ipanema\". In 2014, Daft Punk became the first French artists to win the award. Gilbert O'Sullivan, U2 and Sinéad O'Connor are the only Irish artists to be nominated, with U2 winning twice. Kimbra, Lorde and Rosé are the only New Zealanders to be nominated, with Kimbra winning in 2013. Olivia Newton-John, Gotye, Sia and Iggy Azalea are the only Australians to be nominated, with Newton-John winning in 1975 and Gotye in 2013.\nRicky Martin, Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee and Bad Bunny are the only Puerto Ricans to be nominated, with Bad Bunny receiving two nominations. In 1959, André Previn became the first German to be nominated. In 1964, The Singing Nun became the first Belgian to be nominated. In 1979, Gerry Rafferty became the first Scottish to be nominated. In 1983, Vangelis became the first Greek to be nominated. In 2008, Rihanna became the first Barbadian to be nominated. In 2019, J Balvin became the first Colombian to be nominated. In 2022, ABBA became the first Swedish artists to be nominated. In 2026, Rosé became the first South Korean to be nominated.\nRoberta Flack, George Benson, Michael Jackson, Tina Turner, Bobby McFerrin, Natalie Cole, Nat King Cole, Whitney Houston, Seal, Ray Charles, Pharrell Williams, Nile Rodgers, Childish Gambino, Anderson .Paak, Lizzo and Kendrick Lamar are the only African-Americans to win the award, with Flack winning twice consecutively.\nAt 17 years old, Lorde became the youngest main artist to be nominated for \"Royals\" in 2014, with Billie Eilish becoming the youngest winner at 18 years old for \"Bad Guy\" in 2020.\nChristopher Cross and Billie Eilish are the only artists to receive Grammys for Record of the Year as well as Album of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best New Artist in a single ceremony. Adele was the first artist to win the awards for Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best New Artist on separate occasions. Only seven artists took the Record of the Year and Best New Artist awards during the same ceremony: Bobby Darin (\"Mack the Knife\" in 1960), Christopher Cross (\"Sailing\" in 1981), Sheryl Crow (\"All I Wanna Do\" in 1995), Norah Jones (\"Don't Know Why\" in 2003), Amy Winehouse (\"Rehab\" in 2008), Sam Smith (\"Stay with Me (Darkchild Version)\" in 2015) and Billie Eilish (\"Bad Guy\" in 2020).\nThe person to appear on the most consecutive Records of the Year was Hal Blaine, the prolific studio drummer who played on six consecutive winners from 1966 to 1971: \"A Taste of Honey\", \"Strangers in the Night\", \"Up, Up and Away\", \"Mrs. Robinson\", \"Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In\", and \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\".\nThirty-two of the winning songs have also won the award for Song of the Year.\nProcess\nFrom 1995 to 2021, members of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences nominated their choices for record of the year. A list of the top twenty records was given to the Nominations Review Committee, a specially selected group of anonymous members, who then selected the top five records to gain a nomination in the category in a special ballot. The rest of the members then voted on a winner from the five nominees. In 2018, it was announced the number of nominated tracks will be increased to eight. In 2021, it was announced that the Nomination Review Committees would be disbanded, and the final nominees for record of the year would be decided by votes from members. Starting in 2022, the number of nominees in the category increased to 10. However, the decision to expand the number of nominees in this category was made 24 hours before the nominees were announced after an early version of the nominations list had already been circulated. This allowed \"Montero (Call Me by Your Name)\" by Lil Nas X and \"I Still Have Faith in You\" by ABBA to be nominated as they were the records that received the most votes besides the other eight nominees. As of the 2024 ceremony, the number of nominees has been reduced back to eight.\nRecipients\n1950s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"35%\" | Record\n! width=\"60%\" | Artist(s)\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" |1959(May)\n| \"Nel Blu Dipinto Di Blu (Volare)\"\n| Domenico Modugno\n|-\n| \"Catch a Falling Star\"\n| Perry Como\n|-\n| \"The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late)\"\n| David Seville\n|-\n| \"Fever\"\n| Peggy Lee\n|-\n| \"Witchcraft\"\n| Frank Sinatra\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" |1959(November)\n| \"Mack the Knife\"\n| Bobby Darin\n|-\n| \"A Fool Such as I\"\n| Elvis Presley\n|-\n| \"High Hopes\"\n| Frank Sinatra\n|-\n| \"Like Young\"\n| André Previn\n|-\n| \"The Three Bells\"\n| The Browns\n|}\n1960s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"30%\" | Record\n! width=\"25%\" | Artist(s)\n! width=\"40%\" | Production team\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" |1961\n| \"Theme from A Summer Place\"\n| colspan=\"2\" | Percy Faith\n|-\n| \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\"\n| colspan=\"2\" | Elvis Presley\n|-\n| \"Georgia on My Mind\"\n| colspan=\"2\" | Ray Charles\n|-\n| \"Mack the Knife\"\n| colspan=\"2\" | Ella Fitzgerald\n|-\n| \"Nice 'n' Easy\"\n| colspan=\"2\" | Frank Sinatra\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" |1962\n| \"Moon River\"\n| colspan=\"2\" |Henry Mancini\n|-\n| \"Big Bad John\"\n| colspan=\"2\" | Jimmy Dean\n|-\n| \"The Second Time Around\"\n| colspan=\"2\" | Frank Sinatra\n|-\n| \"Take Five\"\n| colspan=\"2\" | The Dave Brubeck Quartet\n|-\n| \"(Up a) Lazy River\"\n| colspan=\"2\" | Si Zentner\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" |1963\n| \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\"\n| colspan=\"2\" | Tony Bennett\n|-\n| \"Desafinado\"\n| colspan=\"2\" | Stan Getz & Charlie Byrd\n|-\n| \"Fly Me to the Moon Bossa Nova\"\n| colspan=\"2\" | Joe Harnell and His Orchestra\n|-\n| \"I Can't Stop Loving You\"\n| colspan=\"2\" | Ray Charles\n|-\n| \"What Kind of Fool Am I?\"\n| colspan=\"2\" | Sammy Davis Jr.\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" |1964\n| \"Days of Wine and Roses\"\n| colspan=\"2\" | Henry Mancini\n|-\n| \"Dominique\"\n| colspan=\"2\" | The Singing Nun\n|-\n| \"Happy Days Are Here Again\"\n| colspan=\"2\" | Barbra Streisand\n|-\n| \"I Wanna Be Around\"\n| colspan=\"2\" | Tony Bennett\n|-\n| \"Wives and Lovers\"\n| colspan=\"2\" | Jack Jones\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" |1965\n| \"The Girl from Ipanema\"\n| colspan=\"2\" | Stan Getz & Astrud Gilberto\n|-\n| \"Downtown\"\n| colspan=\"2\" | Petula Clark\n|-\n| \"Hello, Dolly!\"\n| colspan=\"2\" | Louis Armstrong\n|-\n| \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\"\n| colspan=\"2\" | The Beatles\n|-\n| \"People\"\n| colspan=\"2\" | Barbra Streisand\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" |1966\n| \"A Taste of Honey\"\n| Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass\n| Herb Alpert & Jerry Moss, producers\n|-\n| \"The 'In' Crowd\"\n| Ramsey Lewis Trio\n| Esmond Edwards, producer\n|-\n| \"King of the Road\"\n| Roger Miller\n| Jerry Kennedy, producer\n|-\n| \"The Shadow of Your Smile (Love Theme From \"The Sandpiper\")\"\n| Tony Bennett\n| Al Stanton & Ernie Altschuler, producers\n|-\n| \"Yesterday\"\n| The Beatles\n| George Martin, producer\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" |1967\n| \"Strangers in the Night\"\n| Frank Sinatra\n| Jimmy Bowen, producer\n|-\n| \"Almost Persuaded\"\n| David Houston\n| Billy Sherrill, producer\n|-\n| \"Monday, Monday\"\n| The Mamas and the Papas\n| Lou Adler, producer\n|-\n| \"What Now My Love\"\n| Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass\n| Herb Alpert & Jerry Moss, producers\n|-\n| \"Winchester Cathedral\"\n| The New Vaudeville Band\n| Geoff Stephens, producer\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" |1968\n| \"Up, Up and Away\"\n| The 5th Dimension\n| Marc Gordon & Johnny Rivers, producers\n|-\n| \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\"\n| Glen Campbell\n| Al De Lory, producer\n|-\n| \"My Cup Runneth Over\"\n| Ed Ames\n| Joe Reisman & Jim Foglesong, producers\n|-\n| \"Ode to Billie Joe\"\n| Bobbie Gentry\n| Kelly Gordon & Bobby Paris, producers\n|-\n| \"Somethin' Stupid\"\n| Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra\n| Jimmy Bowen & Lee Hazlewood, producers\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" |1969\n| \"Mrs. Robinson\"\n| Simon & Garfunkel\n| Roy Halee & Simon & Garfunkel, producers\n|-\n| \"Harper Valley PTA\"\n| Jeannie C.
