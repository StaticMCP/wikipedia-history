He received his undergraduate degree from Harvard College and his law degree from Columbia Law School in 1943. He practiced law in Manchester and served in the New Hampshire House of Representatives. In 1962 he was elected governor of New Hampshire, becoming only the third Democratic governor of New Hampshire in 88 years, and the first since Fred Herbert Brown lost the 1924 election. After his three terms as the 71st governor of New Hampshire, he served on the New Hampshire Supreme Court from 1979, and as its Chief Justice from 1981 until 1986.\nAs Governor, King instituted the first state lottery in the nation since 1894. He was a major hawk and a fierce supporter of President Lyndon B. Johnson during the Vietnam War and the 1968 presidential election.\nDuring his attacks on Senator Eugene McCarthy, Johnson's challenger in the New Hampshire primary, King questioned McCarthy's national loyalty and also warned that a strong vote for \"the appeaser,\" would be \"greeted with cheers in Hanoi.\"\nKing was a Roman Catholic and after his death in 1996 he was buried in the St. Joseph's Cemetery in Bedford, New Hampshire.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050305193533/http://www.state.nh.us/nhdhr/glikeness/kingjohn.html King at New Hampshire's Division of Historic Resources]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091020053749/http://www.nga.org/portal/site/nga/menuitem.29fab9fb4add37305ddcbeeb501010a0/?vgnextoid=b529224971c81010VgnVCM1000001a01010aRCRD&vgnextchannel=e449a0ca9e3f1010VgnVCM1000001a01010aRCRD National Governors Association profile]\n*"
