It flows southwards before turning north and continuing until it discharges into the West Arm of the Cambridge Gulf just south of Wyndham.\nThe river was named in 1884 during hydrographic surveys by Staff Commander James Coghlan after Captain Phillip Parker King, who was the first European to chart the river mouth in 1818.\nThe river flooded in 2005 following heavy rainfall when Cyclone Ingrid crossed the coast in the area. At Diggers Rest Station near Wyndham fences and livestock were swept away.\nThe Indigenous Australian name for the river is Goolime and traditional owners of the areas around the river are the Ngarinjin, for the area around its headwaters.\nReferences\nExternal links"
