The football rivalry game is tied for the oldest rivalry game in NCAA Division II, alongside the Black Hills Brawl. The current, full title is the \"Southern Bancorp Battle of the Ravine\".\nIn its earliest days, the game was played on Thanksgiving Day, but now it is played as the last game on each team's schedule. It is a unique rivalry in that the two schools located in Arkadelphia, Arkansas are across the street from each other and the visiting team walks from their own locker room to the other team's stadium. Ouachita Baptist currently leads the series 47–45–6.\nGame results\n| team2 = Ouachita Baptist\n| team2style =\n| November 28, 1895 | unknown | Ouachita Baptist | 8 | Henderson State | 0\n| 1907 |
