Such ministerial by-elections were usually uncontested however on this occasion a poll was required in East Sydney (Charles Cowper), The Glebe and  West Sydney (John Darvall and John Robertson). Each minister was comfortably re-elected. Only The Paterson (William Arnold) was uncontested.\nDaniel Dalgleish was a former member for West Sydney who was defeated at the election on 24 November 1864. He was then an unsuccessful candidate at the elections for The Glebe (29 November 1864) and Goldfields South (10 January 1865). The day after his loss here, Dalgelish was again unsuccessful at the West Sydney by-election (18 February 1865), which was the final occasion on which he stood for parliament.\nDates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
