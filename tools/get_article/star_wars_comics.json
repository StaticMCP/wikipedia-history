      "text": "# Star Wars comics\n\n'Star Wars comics' have been produced by various comic book publishers since the debut of the 1977 film Star Wars. Marvel Comics launched its original series in 1977, beginning with a six-issue comic adaptation of the film and running for 107 issues, including an adaptation of The Empire Strikes Back. Marvel also released an adaptation of Return of the Jedi and spin-offs based on Droids and Ewoks. A self-titled comic strip ran in American newspapers between 1979 and 1984. Blackthorne Publishing released a three-issue run of 3-D comics from 1987 to 1988.\nDark Horse Comics published the limited series Dark Empire in 1991, and ultimately produced over 100 Star Wars titles, including Tales of the Jedi (1993–1998), X-wing: Rogue Squadron (1995–1998), Republic (1998–2006), Tales (1999–2005), Empire (2002–2006), Knights of the Old Republic (2006–2010), and Legacy (2006–2010), as well as manga adaptations of the original film trilogy and the 1999 prequel The Phantom Menace.\nThe Walt Disney Company acquired Marvel in 2009 and Lucasfilm in 2012, and the Star Wars comics license returned to Marvel in 2015. Several new series were launched, including Star Wars, Star Wars: Darth Vader, and Doctor Aphra. In 2017, IDW Publishing launched the anthology series Star Wars Adventures. In 2022, Dark Horse resumed publishing new Star Wars comics and graphic novels.\nOverview\nThe original series by Marvel Comics began in 1977 with a six-issue comic adaptation of the original film and ran for 107 issues and three Annuals until 1986, featuring stories set between the original trilogy films, as well as adaptations of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. From 1985 to 1987, Marvel published two short-lived series based on the Star Wars animated series Droids and Ewoks. Briefly, the publishing rights went to Blackthorne Publishing, which released a three-issue run of 3-D comics from 1987 to 1988. Then, three years later, the rights to publish Star Wars comics were acquired by Dark Horse Comics, who published the limited series Dark Empire in 1991 and ultimately produced over 100 Star Wars titles until 2014.\nFollowing the October 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, in January 2014, it was announced that the Star Wars comics license would return to Marvel Comics in 2015 (Disney having previously purchased Marvel Entertainment and the Marvel Comics brand and publishing in 2009).\nIn April 2014, Lucasfilm rebranded the majority of the Star Wars Expanded Universe as Legends, only keeping the theatrical Skywalker saga and the 2008 Clone Wars theatrical film and television series as canon. Most media released since then is considered part of the same canon, including comics.\nTimeline\nMarvel (1977–1987)\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Marvel (1977–1987)\n|-\n|Star Wars #1–107\n|April 1977 – May 1986\n|-\n|Star Wars Annual #1–3\n|December 1979 – December 1983\n|-\n|Marvel Illustrated Books Star Wars #1–2\n|November 1981 – October 1982\n|-\n|Star Wars: Return of the Jedi #1–4\n|October 1983 – January 1984\n|-\n|Star Wars: Ewoks #1–14\n|May 1985 – July 1987\n|-\n|Star Wars: Droids #1–8\n|April 1986 – June 1987\n|}\nLucasfilm publicity supervisor Charles Lippincott approached publisher Stan Lee at Marvel Comics in 1975 about publishing a Star Wars comic book prior to the film's release. Lee initially declined to consider such a proposal until the film was completed, and was only persuaded otherwise in a second meeting arranged by Roy Thomas, who wanted to edit the series. Since movie tie-in comics rarely sold well at that time, Lee negotiated a publishing arrangement which gave no royalties to Lucasfilm until sales exceeded 100,000. Thomas and artist Howard Chaykin adapted the events of the original film in issues #1–6 of Star Wars, with the first issue released for sale on April 12, 1977. issue #1 was available for sale on April 12, 1977.}} According to former Marvel editor-in-chief Jim Shooter, the strong sales of Star Wars comics saved Marvel financially in 1977 and 1978. The series began featuring original stories with issue #7 (January 1978). Writer Archie Goodwin and artist Carmine Infantino took over the series as of #11 (May 1978). The series was one of the industry's top selling titles in 1979 and 1980. The 100,000 copy sales quota was surpassed quickly, allowing Lippincott to renegotiate the royalty arrangements. A six-issue adaptation of The Empire Strikes Back by Goodwin and artists Al Williamson and Carlos Garzon appeared in issues #39–44 (September 1980 – February 1981). Writer David Michelinie and artist Walt Simonson became the new creative team with issue #51 (September 1981). Ron Frenz became the regular artist of the title starting with issue #71 (May 1983). As of 1984, the Star Wars series was primarily written by Jo Duffy, and art for the final year and a half of the series was by Cynthia Martin. Marvel published the series until 1986, lasting 107 issues and three Annuals.\nThe first original Star Wars stories not directly adapted from the films to appear in print form were Star Wars comics serialized in the Marvel magazine Pizzazz (1977–1979). The first story arc, titled \"The Keeper's World\", was by Thomas, Chaykin, and Tony DeZuniga.}} The second story arc, entitled \"The Kingdom of Ice\", was by Goodwin, Simonson, Klaus Janson, Dave Cockrum, and John Tartaglione. The final two chapters were scheduled to be printed in issues #17 and 18, but the magazine was cancelled after issue #16. Marvel UK reprinted \"The Keeper's World\" in its Star Wars Weekly #47–50, and \"The Kingdom of Ice\" (including the previously unreleased chapters) in its Star Wars Weekly #57–60 between 1978 and 1979. Star Wars: The Original Marvel Years Volume 3 (2015) and Epic Collection: Star Wars – The Original Marvel Years Vol.&nbsp;1 (2016).}}\nMarvel's Star Wars comics were reprinted in the U.K. as a weekly black-and-white comics anthology. The weekly U.K. issues split the stories from the U.S. monthly issues into smaller installments, and it usually took two to three weekly issues to complete a U.S. monthly issue. The U.K. comic also published original Star Wars stories by British creators, including Alan Moore.}} Star Wars Weekly #1 was published with a free cut-out X-wing fighter on February 8, 1978. It became The Empire Strikes Back Weekly from issue #118 in May 1980, and then became a monthly title from issue #140 in November 1980, reverting to the title Star Wars with issue #159 in July 1982.}} The monthly comic ran until issue #171 in July 1983, when the numbering was reset at #1 for Return of the Jedi Weekly, which was the first time the U.K. comic had been printed in color. This is the title and format that remained until the last issue (#155) was published in June 1986. Further original content was published in issues #94–99, 104–115, 149 and 153–157. Throughout this eight-year period, Marvel UK also published several Star Wars Annuals and Specials.\nMarvel's adaptation of Return of the Jedi (October 1983 – January 1984) appeared in a separate four-issue limited series as well as in Marvel Super Special #27 and in a mass market paperback. From 1985 to 1987, the animated children's series Ewoks and Droids inspired comic series from Marvel's Star Comics line.\nPendulum Press (1978)\nIn 1978, Pendulum Press, under their educational series Contemporary Motivators, also published a 31-page loose adaptation of Star Wars by Linda A. Cadrain and Charles Nicholas. Produced as part of a package which included an audio tape and a film strip, the comic was specifically designed for classroom use, with typeset instead of hand lettering, and vocabulary appropriate for children.\nNewspaper strip (1979–1984)\nA newspaper strip was published between 1979 and 1984, distributed by Los Angeles Times Syndicate and the Watertown Daily Times. The creative teams were revolving, but included Archie Goodwin, Williamson, Russ Manning, Steve Gerber, Alfredo Alcala, Carlos Garzon and letterer Ed King. Goodwin switched from writing Marvel's Star Wars series to the weekly newspaper comic strip after the release of The Empire Strikes Back (1980), becoming the first writer to draw from more than just the original film in establishing the era set between the two films. The strip was based on the storyline and characters established in the original trilogy, but never adapted any of the films, instead fleshing out the history between them. From October 1980 to February 1981, Goodwin and Alcala adapted Brian Daley's ''Han Solo at Stars' End'' (1979).\nIn 1991, Russ Cochran published a 2500-copy limited run of a three-volume hardcover boxset of all of Goodwin and Williamson's Star Wars comic strips from 1981 to 1984, signed by both creators, and featuring new cover illustrations by the latter. Dark Horse Comics collected colorized compilations of the newspaper strip in its Classic Star Wars series from 1992 to 1994. Between 2017 and 2018, The Library of American Comics published a three-volume reprint series of the complete comic strip.\nBlackthorne (1987–1988)\nBlackthorne Publishing released a three-issue series called Star Wars 3-D from December 1987 to February 1988. The comics were later reprinted in a black-and-white, non-3-D format by Dark Horse in their 2013 Star Wars Omnibus: Wild Space, Volume 1.\nDark Horse (1991–2014)\nAdaptations\nFilm and television adaptations\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Dark Horse\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Film\n|-\n|Star Wars: A New Hope — The Special Edition #1–4\n|January–April 1997\n|-\n|Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace #1–4\n|May 1999\n|-\n|Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones #1–4\n|April–May 2002\n|-\n|Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith #1–4\n|March–April 2005\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |The Clone Wars Legacy\n|-\n|Star Wars: Darth Maul – Son of Dathomir #1–4\n|May–August 2014\n|}\nDark Horse also published miniseries adapting Episode I: The Phantom Menace, Episode II: Attack of the Clones, Episode III: Revenge of the Sith .

The series was written by J.&nbsp;W. Rinzler with art by Mike Mayhew. In this version, Luke Skywalker is more mature and a Jedi, and the main protagonist is named Annikin Starkiller. The series received mostly positive reviews.\nReturn to Marvel (2015–present)\nFollowing the acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company in 2012, it was announced in January 2014 that the Star Wars comics license would return to Marvel Comics in 2015. Disney had purchased Marvel's parent company, Marvel Entertainment, in 2009. Meanwhile, with the sequel film The Force Awakens in production, most of the licensed Star Wars novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film Star Wars were rebranded as Star Wars Legends and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014.\nEarly reports in May 2014 suggested that Marvel would announce two new ongoing Star Wars comic series at San Diego Comic-Con. In July 2014, Marvel announced three new series at SDCC: Star Wars, Star Wars: Darth Vader, and the limited series Star Wars: Princess Leia.\nOngoing series\n(left) and writer Jason Aaron (right) at a January 2015 signing at Midtown Comics in Manhattan for Star Wars #1, the first Star Wars comic published by Marvel since 1987.]]\nThe initial series, Star Wars, was released in January 2015, with Darth Vader debuting in February.\nThe ongoing series Star Wars: Poe Dameron was announced in January 2016. Featuring X-wing fighter pilot Poe Dameron introduced in The Force Awakens, the series debuted on April 6, 2016. A six-issue comic adaptation of The Force Awakens by Chuck Wendig began publication in June 2016. In 2017. A second volume of the Marvel Darth Vader comic, subtitled Dark Lord of the Sith, began in June 2017 from writer Charles Soule and artist Giuseppe Camuncoli.\nIn August 2019, Marvel announced that the main Star Wars series that started in 2015, which has narratively caught up to the timeframe of the events of The Empire Strikes Back, would end in November 2019 with issue #75. A 56-page one-shot called Star Wars: Empire Ascendant, written by Soule, Greg Pak, Simon Spurrier, and Ethan Sacks, was released in December 2019 to wrap up the series.\nAt New York Comic Con in October 2019, Lucasfilm and Marvel announced the main Star Wars title would relaunch with a new ongoing series beginning in January 2020. Written by Soule, the flagship series will explore the time between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. It will expand on stories like how the demoralized ragtag band of rebels grows into the massive fleet that attacks the second Death Star, how the plan to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt is formed, how Leia balances her personal desires to save Han with her responsibilities to the Rebellion, Luke's growth as a Jedi while coming to an understanding of Darth Vader's reveal of his heritage, and the evolution of Lando Calrissian from selfish betrayer to trusted general.\nFirst announced as Project Luminous at Star Wars Celebration in April 2019, full details of a publishing initiative called Star Wars: The High Republic were revealed in a press conference in February 2020. Involving the majority of the current officially licensed publishers, a new era set 200 years before the Skywalker Saga will be explored in various books and comics, including an ongoing Marvel title written by Cavan Scott.\nThe ongoing series Han Solo and Chewbacca was announced in December 2021. The series was described as being a collection of different adventures of the pair, starting just a few years before the events of Star Wars: A New Hope.\nIn January 2025, a relaunch of the main Star Wars continuity was announced, with a new #1 set for May of the same year. Written by Alex Segura, the new run explores the timeframe immediately after Return Of The Jedi.\nThree more ongoings were announced in subsequent months: Legacy Of Vader, written by Charles Soule and set shortly after The Last Jedi; Mark Guggenheim's Star Wars: Jedi Knights, set in the lead up to The Phantom Menace; and Doctor Aphra: Chaos Agent, by Cherish Chen, set during the same period as Star Wars' ongoing 2025 series.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Marvel (2015–present)\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Ongoing series\n|-\n|Star Wars (2015) #1–75, four Annuals\n|January 2015 – November 2019\n|-\n|Star Wars: Darth Vader #1–25, one Annual\n|February 2015 – October 2016\n|-\n|Star Wars: Kanan #1–12\n|April 2015 – March 2016\n|-\n|Star Wars: Poe Dameron #1–31, two Annuals\n|April 2016 – September 2018\n|-\n|Star Wars: Doctor Aphra #1–40, three Annuals\n| December 2016 – December 2019\n|-\n|Star Wars: Darth Vader (vol. 2) #1–25, one Annual\n| June 2017 – December 2018\n|-\n|Star Wars (1977) #108\n| May 2019\n|-\n| Star Wars (2020) #1–50\n| January 2020 – September 2024\n|-\n|Star Wars: Darth Vader (vol. 3) #1–50\n| February 2020 – September 2024\n|-\n|Star Wars: Doctor Aphra (vol. 2) #1–40\n| May 2020 – January 2024\n|-\n|Star Wars: Bounty Hunters #1–42\n| May 2020 – January 2024\n|-\n|Star Wars: The High Republic #1–15\n| January 2021 – March 2022\n|-\n| Star Wars: Han Solo and Chewbacca #1–10\n| March 2022 – March 2023\n|-\n| Star Wars: The High Republic (vol. 2) #1–10\n| October 2022 – May 2023\n|-\n| Star Wars: The High Republic (vol. 3) #1–10\n| November 2023 – August 2024\n|-\n|Legacy Of Vader (2025) #1–\n|February 2025 –\n|-\n|Star Wars: Jedi Knights (2025) #1–\n|March 2025 –\n|-\n|Star Wars (2025) #1–\n|May 2025 –\n|-\n|Doctor Aphra - Chaos Agent\n|June 2025 –\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Ongoing series related one-shots\n|-\n|Star Wars: Vader Down #1\n|November 2015\n|-\n|Star Wars: Screaming Citadel #1\n| May 2017\n|-\n|Star Wars: Empire Ascendant #1\n| December 2019\n|-\n|Star Wars Saga #1\n| December 2019\n|-\n|Krrsantan: Star Wars Tales #1\n|June 2022\n|}\nCollected editions\nStar Wars (2015)\nThese books are set between Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope and Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=98%\n! class=\"unsortable\" |#\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Subtitle\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Issues collected\n!

Several other limited series followed, including Kanan (April 2015 – March 2016), Lando (July–October 2015), Shattered Empire (September–October 2015),\nIn 2017, limited series Darth Maul, Mace Windu, and Captain Phasma, as well as further one-shots, continued to expand the Star Wars universe. The comic adaptation of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story was also released. Both the Poe Dameron and the second Darth Vader comics ended their runs in 2018, in September and December respectively.\nIn 2018, Marvel adapted the events of author Timothy Zahn's Star Wars: Thrawn novel in a limited series. The character had been introduced by Zahn's Heir to the Empire trilogy in the early 1990s, now part of the Legends line, and was re-introduced in the new canon in Star Wars Rebels. Adaptations of both The Last Jedi and Solo: A Star Wars Story were released, and the timeframe of Solo was explored further in the Beckett one-shot and in limited series featuring young Lando (Double or Nothing) and Han's time in the Empire (Imperial Cadet). Marvel announced in October 2018 that a five-issue, Wendig penned miniseries, Star Wars: Shadow of Vader, would be released starting in January 2019. The series would be an anthology told from the perspectives of those who had encountered Darth Vader. After three issues had been written, Wendig was removed from the miniseries (and future projects) by Marvel over concerns of his use of social media, and ultimately the miniseries was cancelled. In December 2018, a new miniseries with a similar premise, Star Wars: Vader – Dark Visions, was announced to be written by Dennis Hopeless with art from Paolo Villanelli and Brian Level and was launched in March 2019.\nFor 2019, Marvel announced a number of new limited series.

A five-issue miniseries titled ''Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge will feature stories of the Black Spire Outpost on the Outer Rim planet Batuu and tie into the theme park experiences set to open at Disneyland and Walt Disney World in 2019. In May 2019, a one-shot by writer Matthew Rosenberg and various artists called Star Wars #108 Crimson Forever picks up the story of the original Marvel Star Wars comic run that ended in 1986.\nIn connection with the forthcoming video game Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order by Electronic Arts and Respawn Entertainment, a five-issue miniseries called Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order – Dark Temple was announced in June 2019 to start publishing in September. At a panel discussing the Journey to Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker publishing program at San Diego Comic-Con in 2019, the four-issue Star Wars: Journey to The Rise of Skywalker – Allegiance miniseries was announced. It will help cover a one-year period during the time between The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker''.

Star Wars: The Rise of Kylo Ren premiered on December 16, 2019.\nIn February 2021 it was announced that Charles Soule would be writing a miniseries focusing on the events of Boba Fett between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, this series tied in with the rest of the ongoing Marvel series' at the time, would be called War of the Bounty Hunters - and released from May through October 2021. The story of War of the Bounty Hunters was followed by the additional miniseries Crimson Reign, also penned by Soule, which served as the second in a trilogy of stories revolving around the same cast of characters, notably Qi'ra, whose return to the Star Wars universe occurred in the pages of War of the Bounty Hunters.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Marvel (2015–present)\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | One-shots\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"  |Movie related\n|-\n|Star Wars: C-3PO one-shot\n|June 2016\n|-\n|Star Wars: Droids Unplugged one-shot\n| June 2017\n|-\n|Star Wars: Rogue One – Cassian & K-2SO Special\n| August 2017\n|-\n|Star Wars: The Last Jedi – Storms of Crait one-shot\n| December 2017\n|-\n|Star Wars: The Last Jedi – DJ – Most Wanted one-shot\n| January 2018\n|-\n|Star Wars: Beckett one-shot\n| August 2018\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Marvel (2015–present)\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Limited series\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"  |Film adaptations\n|-\n|-\n|Star Wars: The Force Awakens #1–6\n| June–November 2016\n|-\n|Rogue One: A Star Wars Story #1–6\n| April–September 2017\n|-\n|Star Wars: The Last Jedi Adaptation #1–6\n| May–September 2018\n|-\n|Solo: A Star Wars Story #1–7\n| October 2018 – April 2019\n|-\n|Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker Adaptation #1–5\n| Feb–June 2025\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"  |Original storylines\n|-\n|Star Wars: Princess Leia #1–5\n|March–June 2015\n|-\n|Star Wars: Lando #1–5\n|July–October 2015\n|-\n|Star Wars: Shattered Empire #1–4\n|September–October 2015\n|-\n|Star Wars: Chewbacca #1–5\n|October–December 2015\n|-\n|Star Wars: Obi-Wan & Anakin #1–5\n|January–May 2016\n|-\n|Star Wars: Han Solo #1–5\n| June–November 2016\n|-\n|Star Wars: Darth Maul #1–5\n| February–July 2017\n|-\n|Star Wars: Jedi of the Republic – Mace Windu #1–5\n| August–December 2017\n|-\n|Star Wars: Captain Phasma #1–4\n| September–October 2017\n|-\n|Star Wars: Thrawn #1–6\n| February–July 2018\n|-\n|Star Wars: Lando – Double or Nothing #1–5\n| May–September 2018\n|-\n|Star Wars: Han Solo – Imperial Cadet #1–5\n| November 2018 – March 2019\n|-\n|Star Wars: Vader – Dark Visions #1–5\n| March–June 2019\n|-\n|''Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge #1–5\n| April–August 2019\n|-\n|Star Wars: TIE Fighter #1–5\n| April–August 2019\n|-\n|Star Wars: Target Vader #1–6\n| July–December 2019\n|-\n|Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order – Dark Temple #1–5\n| September–December 2019\n|-\n|Star Wars: Journey to The Rise of Skywalker – Allegiance #1–4\n| October 2019\n|-\n|Star Wars: The Rise of Kylo Ren #1–4\n| December 2019–March 2020\n|-\n|Star Wars: War Of The Bounty Hunters #1–6\n| May–October 2021\n|-\n|Star Wars: Crimson Reign #1-5\n|December 2021-June 2022\n|-\n|Star Wars: Obi-Wan #1-5\n|May–September 2022\n|-\n|Han Solo And Chewbacca #1-10\n|March 2022–March 2023\n|-\n|Star Wars: The Mandalorian #1-8\n|July 2022–March 2023\n|-\n|Star Wars: Yoda #1-10\n|November 2022–August 2023\n|-\n|Sana Starros - Family Matters #1-5\n|February–June 2023\n|-\n|Star Wars: The Mandalorian Season Two #1-8\n|June 2023–January 2024\n|-\n|Star Wars: Obi-Wan Kenobi #1-6\n|September 2023–March 2024\n|-\n|Star Wars: Thrawn Alliances #1-4\n|January–April 2024\n|-\n|Star Wars: Mace Windu: The Twilight Run #1-4\n|February–May 2024\n|-\n|Star Wars: Jango Fett: Trail Of Lost Hope #1-4\n|March–June 2024\n|-\n|Star Wars: Inquisitors #1-4\n|July–October 2024\n|-\n|Star Wars: Ahsoka #1-8\n|July 2024–February 2025\n|-\n|Star Wars: Ewoks #1-4\n|October 2024-January 2025\n|-\n|Star Wars: Battle Of Jakku - Insurgency Rising #1-4\n|October-November 2024\n|-\n|Star Wars: Battle Of Jakku - Republic Under Siege #1-4\n|November-December 2024\n|-\n|Star Wars: Battle Of Jakku - Last Stand #1-4\n|December 2024-January 2025\n|}\nAge of Star Wars maxiseries\nAt San Diego Comic-Con in 2018, Marvel announced Age of Star Wars, a 27-issue maxiseries starting in December 2018 that would span all three eras of the Star Wars saga.
