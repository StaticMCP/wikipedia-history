Julio Argentino Roca was elected.\nBackground\nA leader of the Conquest of the Desert, as well as of the suppression of Mitre's 1874 uprising and others, outgoing president Nicolás Avellaneda had decided on General Julio Roca as his successor early on. Memories of Mitre's defeat did not sit well with Buenos Aires separatists, and this faction nominated the Governor of Buenos Aires Province, Carlos Tejedor.\nResults\nPresident\nVice president\nAftermath\nRoca's election by the electoral college was followed by Tejedor's armed insurrection, and though the latter was defeated, Mitre brokered negotiations between Tejedor's separatists and the national government. These negotiations eventually result in the Federalization of Buenos Aires in September, stabilizing the powerful province's position within Argentina.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*"
