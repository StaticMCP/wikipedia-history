      "text": "# Newtro culture\n\nNewtro () is a portmanteau of the words \"new\" and \"retro\", and refers to the trend of \"modernized retro\". Newtro's beginnings can be traced back to 2018 in South Korea.\nNewtro is an amalgamation of trends of the modern and retro eras (namely, the 1980s and 1990s) in all fields of life, such as fashion, music, movies, beverages, food, architecture, electronics, etc. Newtro is not only a nostalgic pass-time aimed for middle aged but also a source of entertainment for the younger generation. This aspect is very different from the standard retro (which is simply recreating the objects from the past). Newtro is presented by modern sense (i.e. interpretation, not representation).\nThis culture rose to popularity in South Korea in the year 2019, and is still popular today.\nPopularization\nWith the shifting South Korean demographic turning to comprise mostly of 30- to 50-year-old individuals, media and marketing cater to the audience of this age group by making more TV shows with the Newtro concept. Companies are also reintroducing snacks and beverages with old packaging design, clothing, and past trends.\nPeriod dramas set in 19th and 20th centuries, like Mr.Sunshine, Reply 1997, Reply 1994, and Reply 1988 have all influenced the rise of Newtro. These dramas often use historical names, such as Hanseong, the original name of the capital city of South Korea, Seoul. These dramas often show the late 1980s or 1990s Korean time period to viewers. These dramas are highly popular among domestic and international audiences. YouTube opened opportunities to view past programs more easily, rather than waiting for reruns. This increased the viewership for TV programs which were popular in 1990s and 2000s. Family sitcoms like \"Unstoppable High Kicks\", musical programs, such as \"Inkigayo\", and more are the highlights of Newtro on YouTube. Social media has also been an influence. Posting photographs and trending hashtags on social media apps such as Instagram attracted more visitors to Newtro themed cafes and streets, and increased the consumption of Newtro products.\nThese television shows, snacks and drinks, and designs awakened nostalgia for Koreans belonging to that era, and provided a new experience for the present youth generation.\nNewtro, in turn, became a bridge between the older and younger generations. Foods or snacks of the older generations became available for the younger generations, and these retro-style foods, as well as media, became a conversation starter between the generations, thus, reducing the generation gap. It is a way to create inter-generational rapport and generational integration beyond the curiosity of the memory consumption of the older generations and the retro of the young generation.\nExpert Lee Jun-young, Prof. of Consumer Economics, Sangmyung University believes Newtro is very popular in South Korea since there are no limit to new content relating to Newtro. As such, Newtro products meet demand and are likely to continue to evolve and last far longer than other trends.\nRising social, economic and health issues, falling human happiness index, and strong nostalgic feelings in the fast-paced Korean society are increasing the craving for an era that was devoid of such concerns, thus also giving rise to Newtro culture.\nExamples\nTechnology\nwith the modern touchscreen.]]\nSamsung's Z Flip were reintroduced. These  were popular in 2000s.\nThe home appliance industryis targeting customers by increasing the lineup of Newtro designs; items such as refrigerators, washing machines, and water purifiers have been redesigned.\nArchitecture and design\nNewtro has bolstered the historical Hanok architecture and style in the modern age.\nHanok is the traditional Korean housing built and designed in the 14th century during the Joseon dynasty. In the modern times, with the fast-changing Korea, Hanok has not lost its appeal, which lead to the incorporation of certain characteristic features of Hanok into modern homes and living spaces.\nMany cafes are incorporating retro-inspired decors and furniture, often called Hanok (Hangul: 한옥) or a cafe/Dabang (Hangul: 다방)). More Dabang (traditional Korean coffee houses) styled cafes are appearing in cities. Most Hanok cafes maintain the external appearance and general structure of a traditional Hanok, while still having modern interiors.\nRetro style arcades have also adapted the Newtro look. Nintendo and Tencent have both released games that feature their retro jasses. Kom Kom Arcade gives an option to play games from the 80s and 90s, and the arcade is seen in the K-drama When the Camellia Blooms.\nEulji-ro (Korean: downtown Seoul, named after the general Ŭlchi Mundŏk offers an industrial, historical taste of Korea with historical machine and tool shops, printing shops, and traditional houses being renovated into restaurants which store a mix of traditional interior design with modem eateries and bakeries.\nGeneral economics\nThere is a surge in the number of Koreans wanting to experience a different era, a popular activity for Korean couples that has led to the opening of new markets and business.\nIn downtown Seoul, there are dozens of boutique shops that rent out clothes, dresses, suits and accessories from the late 19th century to the early 20th century for a few hours. Customers can take selfies either inside or outside the shop. These shops are thriving, since demand for 1930s and 40s styles are also rising. Many retail uniform rental shops are available in Hanok villages.\nReleasing (non-consumable) products or goods in retro style has also surged in popularity among businesses in South Korea. For example, Daehan Flower, a flower company which had been in the market for almost 80 years prior, expanded its market by selling Newtro style goods using their brand characters as advertisements, attracting customers in their 20s and 30s. Accessories used in 90s are also gaining popularity: plastic bead key-chains, phone decorating stickers, board games, Polaroid cameras, and traditional hair pins with modern designs all have been making a comeback.\nDongmyo Market, Jongno-gu Dist., Seoul, which was popular among the elderly, is now visited by a younger population.\nFashion\nThe Newtro trend has brought back clothes, footwear, accessories from the past three decades. Bell-bottom pants, bold prints, vintage boomer jackets, baggy jeans are back in style.\nModern \"Hanbok\" clothing usually refers to traditional Korean clothes worn during the Joseon dynasty period. It has been transformed into modern Hanbok-esque, while still keeping intact the key features of traditional Korean clothing. The Newtro clothing has been a rising trend with the help of K-pop artists like VIXX, BTS, A.C.E, Blackpink, ONEUS, etc., who featured adorning these modern versions in their music video concepts, season's greetings, concept photos, etc.\nThe ‘2018 F/W Hera Seoul Fashion Week’ held at Dongdaemun Design Plaza in October 2018 saw the reappearance of fashion popular which was 30 years back.

Many stores and brands like Leesle, Danha Seoul offer modern Hanboks. Fila released a remake shoe line from the 1970s which has been selling steadily, with sales of more than 500,000 pairs.\nMakeup companies like Clio, Romand, Peripera, Stonebrick are releasing limited edition makeup in retro style along with making the package look like VHS tapes and cassettes to give it a retro look. Makeup trends from the 80s to the early 2000s are also back in fashion.\nSince, October 2020 Korean schools have started incorporating Hanbok-inspired uniforms; which was introduced by Hanbok Advanced Center.\nMedia\nMBC is now \"re-debuting\" the superstars of 1990s and 2000s- Rain, Lee Hyo-ri and Yoo Jae-suk were all re-released as a\" mixed group\".\nEven in the digital age there is growing demand for LP stores. LP stores in Yongsan-gu district, Seoul, allow visitors to listen to and buy LP records. 1,500 people visit every day. In South Korea, an estimated 600,000 copies of LPs were sold in 2019; more than double compared to 2016.\nNewtro trends can also be seen in the K-pop group DIA's mini-album titled after the trend; it features some 1980s- and 1990s-inspired styling and fashion to add to the numerous other K-pop artists who incorporated Newtro idea into their work. BTS' hit single \"Dynamite\", recounts familiar scenes and fashion from the early 1970s. BTS also released exclusive vinyl records and cassettes instead of the usual CD. Since the 2020s, there has been a rise in k-pop groups coming up with a jewel case version of newly released albums, especially associated with SM Entertainment.\nFood and drink\nNewtro culture has brought back retro packaging and redesigns to various food and drink products.\nOne company has re-launched a type of noodles 30 years after they were originally on the market. Old time snacks have also made a comeback; snacks like Samyang's Star Popeye snack, Lotte's Juicy & Fresh Gum, Lotte's Cheetos, Gompyo's popcorn and Gompyo's nachos.\nGompyo, also redesigned their beer packaging with 90s elements and used their original logo\ndue to Newtro culture.

One beer company has used its old bear character (used back in 1950s) and retro style fonts on its packaging.\nNewtro streets\nNewtro is not centered on a particular store, product, or activity alone.
