Features dramatised reconstructions and analysis by experts in the field of ancient history. This is the story of bloody conflicts between the Greeks and the Persians that lasted for more than fifty years in the fourth century BC. It includes the famous battle of Marathon, a victory that has echoed down the year, and Thermopylae, where the Spartans made a heroic defence of the pass. The running battles did not cease until 449 BC, when the Persians finally gave up hope of annexing Greece.\n||Brian Blessed|| Cromwell ||  499 BC-449 BC ||  ||  || 50 min\n|-\n|| 2 || Hoplite Warfare || The nature of infantry warfare in the Peloponnesian Wars between the Greek city states of Athens and Sparta in 450 BC. The hoplites were the regular infantry of both sides, armed with the long thrusting spear and fighting in powerful phalanxes, but it was the Spartans who used them to greater effect, eventually defeating Athens and subjugating her utterly. The mighty armoured warriors at the heart of Greek legend were famous Hoplites. Fighting shoulder to shoulder, armed with their long thrusting spears and colourful shields, these were the men who dominated the battlefields of the ancient world during the conflicts of the Peloponnesian Wars.\nIn 450 BC, war erupted between the two great powers of ancient Greece, the Athenians and the Spartans. By the time the war had finished, the army, navy and city of Athens would be in ruins.\n||Brian Blessed|| Cromwell || 431 BC–404 BC ||  ||  || 50 min\n|-\n|| 3 || Hannibal and the Punic Wars || A true giant of military history, Hannibal forged his formidable reputation during the Punic Wars of the second century BC. Famed for his incredible fifteen-day journey across the Alps, and for his great victories over the Romans at Trebbia and Cannae, Hannibal remained undefeated in battle until his raw armies were crushed by Scipio at Zama in 203 BC, leaving Carthage at the mercy of the hated Romans. It provides an atmospheric depiction of life in those troubled times. Superb reconstructions and re-enactments convey the savagery of battle in the ancient world. Expert comment and analysis and period imagery combine to tell the story of one of military history's greatest generals. ||Bob Sessions|| Pegasus || 218 BC-201 BC ||  ||  || 55 min\n|-\n|| 4 || Gallic Wars || The Gallic Wars tells the story of the campaigns from 58 BC to 53 BC in which Julius Caesar and his Roman legions conquered Gaul and the mysterious island of Britannia. Caesar portrayed this invasion as genuine concern for Italian security but as the campaign developed, Rome's greatest commander began to hatch plans for the full conquest. This documentary sketches the conflict between Rome and Gaul, specifically Caesar's campaigns of 58–53 BC, culminating with the defeat of Vercingetorix at Alesia. The programme uses clips of actors dressed as Gauls and Romans, one of whom poses as Julius Caesar reading extracts from his De bello Gallico, and these re-enactment scenes are interspersed with academic talking heads. It's all standard classroom stuff that gets the facts across without much in the way of frills or style, but doubtless of value for students. Much time at the beginning of the programme is spent looking at the Celtic way of life in an attempt to redress the bias of the written Roman sources, although the identification of Stonehenge as a druidic monument is highly contentious, as is the idea that Caesar's conquests were in some way retribution for the Gallic sack of Rome back in 390 BC: Caesar was far more interested in the current political scene to care about what was, for him as much as for us. ||Bob Sessions|| Cromwell || 58 BC-50 BC ||  ||  || 55 min\n|-\n|| 5 || The Roman Invasions of Britain  ||\"Neither before or since has Britain ever been in a more disturbed or perilous state.\" CORNELIUS TACITUS. In 55 BC the ambitious Julius Caesar, Emperor of Rome, turned envious eyes towards the mysterious isle of Britain. Within a few short years, the mighty Roman war machine had tamed the Celtic tribal society and transformed it into a province of the Roman Empire. This is the story of the dark years of ancient Britain when the well-disciplined Roman Legions faced the fury of the united Celtic peoples of Britain.||Brian Blessed || Pegasus || 43–96 AD ||  ||  || 55 min\n|-\n|| 6 || Under Siege! Alesia 52BC  ||As resistance to the Roman invasion of Northern Europe collapsed, the Gallic warrior Vercingetorix marshalled 100,000 troops against the formidable and ruthless Roman legions, for what was to be a dramatic yet futile last stand at the famous hilltop fort of Alesia. The last of the fighting Gauls were up against one of military history's most inspired commanders – Julius Caesar and Roman legions of almost mythical invincibility. The extraordinary siege works constructed by the Romans not only kept Vercingetorix's army penned in but also managed to keep an enormous Gallic relief army out.||Jack Fortune || Pegasus || 52 BC ||  ||  || 50 min\n|-\n|| 7 ||The Battle of Hastings-Tapestry of a Battle || I live and by God's help will conquer yet!

But joining the military was the making of him, and he soon discovered a remarkable gift for impressing influential people.

The Emperor's determination to impose the 'Continental System' on the whole of Europe was the driving force behind the decision to invade Spain and Portugal, known to posterity as the Peninsular War. A further headache presented itself in the form of a revitalised and remodelled Austrian army, a force that was to inflict Napoleon's first decisive defeat on the battlefield.
