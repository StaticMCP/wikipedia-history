He received a master's degree from Guelph and the University of Toronto and a doctorate from Cornell. His 1955 thesis was \"studies on ascorbic acid synthesis in apple leaves\" (Cornell: 1955, 304 pages).\nIn 1960, while working for the Canadian Department of Agriculture in Ottawa (Agriculture Canada), he developed a process of making instant mashed potato flakes, and filed a patent on the process (Canadian patent 3260607, July 1966). The product reached the market in 1962. Another of his inventions at the time was an infrared apple peeler.\nHe later worked for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, moving to Italy where he became chief of the technical division, an important component of the Green Revolution. He retired in 1985.\nHe has 5 children, two girls and three boys.\nFurther reading\n*\n*"
