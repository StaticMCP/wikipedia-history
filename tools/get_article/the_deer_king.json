When a pack of dogs race through a Zol-controlled mine, Van, an enslaved former soldier, and a young girl named Yuna are both bitten, but manage to escape as the sole survivors of the attack. Finally free, Van and Yuna seek out a simple, peaceful existence in the countryside. But as the deadly disease once again runs rampant, they find themselves at the crossroads of a struggle much larger than any one nation.\nCharacters\n;\n:|Ray Chase}}\n;\n:\n;\n:\n;\n:|Luciana VanDette}}\nMedia\nNovels\nDuring their Sakura-Con 2023 panel, Yen Press announced that they licensed the novels.\n| OriginalISBN    = 978-4-04-105489-5\n| LicensedRelDate = September 19, 2023\n| LicensedISBN    = 978-1-97-535233-2\n}}\n| OriginalISBN    = 978-4-04-105508-3\n| LicensedRelDate = January 23, 2024\n| LicensedISBN    = 978-1-97-535236-3\n}}\n| OriginalISBN    = 978-4-04-105509-0\n| LicensedRelDate = —\n| LicensedISBN    =\n}}\n| OriginalISBN    = 978-4-04-105510-6\n| LicensedRelDate = —\n| LicensedISBN    =\n}}\n| OriginalISBN    = 978-4-04-109292-7\n| LicensedRelDate = —\n| LicensedISBN    =\n}}\nManga\nDuring their Sakura-Con 2023 panel, Yen Press announced that they also licensed the manga.\n| OriginalISBN    = 978-4-04-111811-5\n| LicensedRelDate = September 19, 2023\n| LicensedISBN    = 978-1-97-536040-5\n}}\n| OriginalISBN    = 978-4-04-111812-2\n| LicensedRelDate = January 23, 2024\n| LicensedISBN    = 978-1-97-536300-0\n}}\nAnime film\nAn anime adaptation was announced on June 21, 2018.

She wrote, \"in the Makokan segments, it reads like a fantasy version of the nonfiction book The Ghost Map, about efforts to discover the root cause of cholera\", and concluded, \"How all of this will come together isn't clear, but it's going to be a fascinating journey to follow. This is one of those books that you could give to your friend who doesn't care for light novels but reads fantasy, and it's worth picking up.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
