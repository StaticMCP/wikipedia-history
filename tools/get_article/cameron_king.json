We are a very proud club, I really enjoy being here and they have been great to me. We have a lot of young talented guys coming through the ranks and a great group of established senior players. I believe the club has a big future and I want to be a part of it.\"\nOn 4 July 2012, King along with teammates David Gower, Michael Lett and Jack Stockwell played for the NSW Cup Representative side against the Queensland Residents at Suncorp Stadium.

What I was going through was nothing compared to what he had copped and he really put it into perspective.'’ \"He will be on the field with me every game I ever play,’’ King said. \"I have made a promise to write his name on my wrist every time I take the field.'’\n2017\nKing was named at hooker to make his NRL debut for Parramatta in their round 17 clash with arch-rivals the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs.

King spoke to the media saying \"Things are probably taking a little longer than I'd hoped, But I do have options back in the UK and in Australia. It's good to get back home and be talking to people and figure out what I want to do.  I've been around friends and family and had a mental break from footy, but I've been assessing the options for next year, whether that be the Championship again, stepping up to Super League or coming back to Australia\".\nOn 2 December 2019, King signed a contract to join Cronulla-Sutherland for the 2020 NRL season.\nIn February 2020, King was taken from the field during Cronulla's trial game against Canterbury-Bankstown with a suspected knee injury.  It was later revealed that King had suffered a season ending ACL injury.  King posted on Twitter saying \"It's still sinking in that my season is over.

Thank you all for the support\".\nOn 15 October 2020, King announced his retirement from the NRL.\nPersonal life\nKing's brother-in-law is former international Greg Alexander, who is married to King's oldest sister Tanya.\nHis father, Stephen King played lower grades at the Penrith Panthers in the 1970s.
