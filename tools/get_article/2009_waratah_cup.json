This led to the creation of the Preliminary Round where 16 clubs were randomly chosen to play. 9 clubs were from the State League Division 2 and the other 7 were from local associations. The remaining 24 clubs would receive a bye into the first round. With the round set to kick-off on 25 March, only tie numbers 1–4 were played with the remaining matches rescheduled to the following week.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!
