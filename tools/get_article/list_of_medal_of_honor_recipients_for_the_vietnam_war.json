The recipients must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States. Due to the nature of this medal, it is commonly presented posthumously.\nThe Vietnam War, (also known as the Second Indochina War, Vietnam Conflict, and in Vietnam as the American War), took place from 1955 to 1975. The war was fought between the Communist-supported North Vietnam and the United States-supported South Vietnam, beginning with the presence of a small number of US military advisors in 1955 and escalating into direct US involvement in a ground war in 1965. US combat forces were withdrawn in early 1973 pursuant to the Paris Peace Accords, but the war continued concluding with the Fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975.\nDuring the Vietnam War and in the following twelve months, 235 Medals of Honor were awarded and since 1978 a further 33 awards have been presented. Of the total of 268 awards, 179 were to the US Army, 15 to the US Navy, 58 to the USMC and 14 to the USAF. These totals do not include the award to the Vietnam Unknown Soldier.\nThe first Medal of Honor presentation for Vietnam was to Captain Roger Donlon for actions on 6 July 1964 as commanding officer of the U.S. Army Special Forces Detachment defending Camp Nam Dong against a Viet Cong attack. The last actions to earn a Medal of Honor in this war were those of Bud Day, for actions as a prisoner of war from 26 August 1967 through 14 March 1973. Day and three others were presented with the Medal of Honor by President Ford at the White House on March 4, 1976. They were the last of the 235 servicemen awarded the Medal of Honor during the Vietnam War and in the following twelve months.\nThe first African American recipient of the war was Milton L. Olive III who sacrificed himself to save others by smothering a grenade with his body. Riley L. Pitts was killed after attacking an enemy force with rifle fire and grenades and was the first African American commissioned officer of the war to receive the medal. Thomas Bennett and Joseph LaPointe were conscientious objectors who received the medal for their actions as medics; three chaplains received the medal, including Vincent R. Capodanno, who served with the Marine Corps and was known as the \"Grunt Padre\".\nRecipients\nindicates that the Medal of Honor was awarded posthumously.All locations are in South Vietnam unless otherwise stated.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\"|Image !!

After DNA testing confirmed his identity, the remains were removed from the tomb and returned to Blassie's family, but the Medal of Honor did not transfer with him. It remains awarded to \"the unknown soldier\" as a tribute to the war dead who have not yet been identified. The Blassie family requested that the Medal of Honor be granted to him but the request was denied by the Department of Defense.\nSee also\n* List of Medal of Honor recipients\nReferences\n:\n*"
