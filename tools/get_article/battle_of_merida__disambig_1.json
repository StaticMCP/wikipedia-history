The force began its Blitzkrieg-like drive northward on 2 August in trucks supplied by General Queipo de Llano. Major Antonio Castejón followed with a second column on 3 August.\nAsensio raced north, smashing through fierce Republican resistance on 6 August. The next day, the Army of Africa captured the village of Almendralejo after a bloody struggle that decimated both sides. The Republicans retreated north to nearby Mérida, while the Nationalists waited for Castejón to arrive.\nThe battle\nOn 10 August the Republican militia made another stand along the Guadiana River, several kilometers south of Mérida. Two banderas (IV Bandera and V Bandera) of the Spanish Foreign Legion and one tabor (II Tabor) of Moroccan Regulares took part in the battle. Before the attack, Mérida was subjected to powerful shelling from Nationalist artillery and aviation. The rebels then attacked the city from three directions: the IV Bandera from the south, crossing the Guadiana River after taking Alange and Zafra, the II Tabor from the east, and the V Bandera crossing the Puente Romano. The IV Bandera initially failed to cross the river, and retreated itself to Almendralejo, but the II Tabor entered the city.\nIn the meantime, Asensio, with the V Bandera, pushed forward and captured the bridge, then swept across the river and captured the city. The loyalist militia retreated rather than risk encirclement, and General Yagüe then arrived to take command of the rebel army. After the occupation of the city, Yagüe's troops carried out a bloody massacre. The committee of defense, led by Anita López was executed by the Nationalists.\nYagüe next moved west against Badajoz with Asensio and Castejón, leaving a detachment of soldiers under Major Heli Tella to hold Mérida. On 11 August the Republican militia reappeared with a strong contingent of Asaltos and Guardia Civil from Madrid. The Republicans attacked and were beaten by Tella's professional Legionnaires.\nMeanwhile, Yagüe's contingent took Badajoz by storm.\nAftermath\nAfter the occupation of Mérida and Badajoz, the Nationalists connected the Nationalist-held northern zone and the southern zone. Furthermore, the Nationalist occupied the occidental half of the Badajoz province and the Republican government lost the control of the Portuguese frontier. The Nationalists carried out a harsh repression in the conquered territory.\nSee also\n*List of Spanish Nationalist military equipment of the Spanish Civil War\n*List of Spanish Republican military equipment of the Spanish Civil War\n*White Terror (Spain)\nReferences\n*\n*Espinosa, Francisco.
