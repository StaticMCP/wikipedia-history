It is the tallest fountain of its type in the world. It is named after King Fahd bin Abdulaziz, the ruler of Saudi Arabia from 1982 until 2005.\nOverview\nThe fountain was donated to the city of Jeddah by King Fahd, hence its name. It was constructed between 1980 and 1983 and was launched in 1985.\nLocated on the west coast of Saudi Arabia, the fountain jets water to a maximum height of . The second-tallest is the World Cup Fountain in Seoul, South Korea, with a water height of .\nKing Fahd's Fountain is listed in Guinness World Records as the highest water fountain in the world.\nThe fountain is visible throughout the vicinity of Jeddah. The water ejected can reach a speed of  and its airborne mass can exceed . The fountain uses saltwater taken from the Red Sea instead of freshwater. Over 500 LED spotlights illuminate the fountain at night.\nHistory\nThe fountain was initially built between 1980 and 1983, and was inspired by the Geneva Fountain (length 140 meters, pumping speed 124&nbsp;mph), but the planners were not satisfied with the height. The fountain was then operated in its current form in 1985 to pump sea water at a speed of 233 miles per hour to a height of 312 meters (1024 feet).\nTeam Red Bull Air Force base jumper Othar Lawrence set a global record by making a historic jump along the fountain.\nDesign\nThe base of the fountain is in the form of a large mabkhara, an incense burner which symbolizes Arabian culture. Since the fountain pumps sea water, rust and corrosion were the main concerns of those who built it. Before reaching the pump, the water passes through several filters to purify it from dirt, sand and organic matter. The fountain is lit by 500 high-light LEDs.\nSee also\n*\n* List of things named after Saudi kings\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
