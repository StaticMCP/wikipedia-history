      "text": "# Buffalo Traditional School\n\nBuffalo Traditional High School is a former magnet school in Buffalo, New York. It served Grades 5 through 12 and was located at 450 Masten Avenue in the city's East Side. It closed in 2005.\nHistory\nThe building was constructed in 1962 on the former site of Offermann Stadium. It first served as the home as Woodlawn Junior High School and became a symbol of the Civil Rights and integration battles of Buffalo, due to failed efforts by African-American residents to have the school integrated with white students. Buffalo Traditional was created in 1977 as part of Buffalo's desegregation program.\nIn 2005, the school was closed. The remaining students were transferred to either Emerson/Harvey Austin Middle School or East High School. The building currently serves home to the Buffalo Academy for Visual and Performing Arts.\nFormer principals\nPrevious assignment and reason for departure denoted in parentheses\n*James Williams&ndash;1977-1983 (Principal - Woodlawn Junior High School, named Principal of Niagara Falls High School)\n*Gerald H.
