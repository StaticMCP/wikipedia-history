He was joined by deputies Rikkos Erotokritou and Prodromos Prodromou who had been expelled from DISY for opposing the party line on the Annan Plan.\nThe coalition received 36,112 votes (10.8%) and Matsis was elected as an MEP by a margin of just 37 votes. He subsequently joined the group of the European People's Party-European Democrats (EPP-ED).\nThe formation of EvroDi was announced on 30 June 2004. On 13 December 2004 the new party elected its leaders during its inaugural meeting. Prodromos Prodromou was elected as President of the Political Bureau, Rikos Erotokritou as vice-president and Christodoulos Taramountas as Assistant Vice President.\nIn 2005, the party merged with New Horizons (Greek: Νέοι Ορίζοντες) to form the European Party.\nReferences\nSee also\n* List of political parties in Cyprus"
