Warren is the principal city of the Warren micropolitan area.\nHistory\nUnited Refining in Warren\nWarren was initially inhabited by Native Americans of the Seneca nation. French explorers had longstanding claims to the area which they acted to secure in an unambiguous fashion with a military-Amerindian expedition in 1749 that buried a succession of plaques claiming the territory as France's in response to the formation of the colonial Ohio Companyand the first of these was buried in Warren but ultimately control was transferred to the British after the French and Indian War.\nAfter the Revolutionary War, General William Irvine and Andrew Ellicott were sent to the area to lay out a town in 1795.

Daniel McQuay of Ireland was the first permanent inhabitant of European descent.\nLumber was the main industry from 1810&ndash;1840, as the abundance of wood and access to water made it profitable to float lumber down the Allegheny River to Pittsburgh.\nDavid Beaty discovered oil in Warren in 1875 while drilling for natural gas in his wife's flower garden. Oil came to dominate the city's economy. Many of the town's large Victorian homes were built with revenue generated by the local oil and timber industries.\nPittsburgh-Des Moines, which was formerly located in Warren, manufactured the Gateway Arch in St. Louis.

The city is attempting to bounce back with the Impact Warren project, a riverfront development project in downtown Warren. The completed project will include new townhouses and senior citizen housing, retail and commercial development, a parking garage, convention center and bus depot.\nMajor employers include Walmart, the United Refining Company (gas supplier for Kwik Fill and Red Apple Food Mart gas stations), Allegheny National Forest, Northwest Bank, Whirley-Drinkworks, Superior Tire and Rubber Corp, Pennsylvania General Energy, Betts Industries, Inc, Blair Corporation, Sheetz, and Interlectric.\nThe Warren Historic District, A.J.
