Dr. Fay L. Warner, a dentist, had the structure built in 1900 and lived here himself until 1908. A relative of his, Fred Warner, lived here in later years and managed the building. The three-story brick structure was one of the most distinguished apartment blocks in Davenport. The building featured a picturesque façade that was typical of Victorian era architecture. The round arch entrances were below ogee-arched moldings. At the top was a deep corbelled cornice frieze. The five sections of the main façade were articulated by full-height octagonal bays. The building was also banded by flat and projecting string courses. The structure was on a raised lot and had a low, stone retaining wall at the sidewalk. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, and has subsequently been demolished.\nReferences"
