The award was established to honor the memory of Paul N. Banks and Carolyn Harris, two early leaders in library preservation.\nThe award consists of a citation and a $1,500 grant donated by Preservation Technologies, L.P. The award recognizes the contribution of a professional preservation specialist who has been active in the field of preservation or conservation for library or archival materials. Winners are chosen based on their accomplishments in preservation leadership, including activities such as leadership in professional associations, training and mentoring in the preservation field, development of new methods and techniques, and significant contributions to literature.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
