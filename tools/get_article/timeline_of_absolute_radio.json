The Radio Authority is mandated to award three licences, awarding each licence to the highest cash bidder, providing that the applicant meets criteria set down in the Broadcasting Act.\n1991\n*October – The second Independent National Radio licence is advertised. It will broadcast on MW, using the 1197&nbsp;kHz and 1215&nbsp;kHz frequencies, which will be relinquished by BBC Radio 3.\n1992\n*29 February – BBC Radio 3 stops broadcasting on 1197&nbsp;kHz and 1215&nbsp;kHz MW.\n*April – The Radio Authority awards the second Independent National Radio licence to Independent Music Radio, a consortium jointly owned by TV-am and Virgin Communications. There had been four other applicants for the licence.\n1993\n*Ahead of its launch on MW, Virgin campaigns to broadcast nationally on FM. It spends 1993 lobbying to broadcast on BBC Radio 4's FM frequencies.\n*March – TV-am sells its stake in Virgin Radio to Apax Partners, JP Morgan Investment Corporation and Sir David Frost.\n*30 April – The station launches as Virgin 1215 at 12.15&nbsp;pm on 30 April 1993. Richard Branson was the first voice to be heard, live from the Virgin Megastore in Manchester, with Richard Skinner the first voice back in the London studios. The first song to be played is a cover version of the Steppenwolf song \"Born to be Wild\", recorded by Australian group INXS.\n*Summer – Virgin 1215 begins broadcasting in stereo on the Astra 1A satellite on an audio sub-carrier of the Sky News channel.\n*2 May – As part of its launch schedule, the first edition of Virgin 1215' album chart show is broadcast, airing at 4pm on Sundays, in direct competition with the charts shows broadcast on both BBC Radio 1 and commercial radio.\n*July – Jonathan Coleman becomes Russ Williams breakfast show co-host.

Also Graham Dene moves to weekday afternoons and Gary King joins to take on weekend breakfast.\n*Having been unsuccessful at trying to obtain BBC Radio 4's FM frequencies, the station tries to persuade The Radio Authority to allocate the recently available 105–108&nbsp;MHz part of the FM waveband to a fourth INR licence as part of a renewed bid to broadcast nationally on FM.\n*29 June – Following its failure to persuade The Radio Authority to use 105–108&nbsp;MHz FM for a new commercial national station, Virgin Radio applies for one of the new licenses to broadcast to London.\n*8 October – Virgin Radio is awarded one of the new London-wide FM licences.\n1995\n*10 April – Virgin Radio starts broadcasting on FM in London.

Capital's plans included moving Virgin Radio from 1 Golden Square to Capital's Leicester Square building and splitting programming between the AM and FM services. The Radio Authority approved the acquisition, but Nigel Griffiths, the Consumer Affairs Minister, referred the takeover to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC). The MMC report into the takeover would not be issued until January 1998, and would recommend that the deal could only go ahead if Capital Gold was sold or Virgin's London FM licence was left out of the deal.
