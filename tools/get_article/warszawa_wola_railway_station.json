It was built on the Warsaw orbital line, which goes through Warszawa Gdańska station. In 2011, it is used exclusively by Koleje Mazowieckie who run the KM9 services from Warszawa Zachodnia through the north of the Masovian Voivodeship to Działdowo, in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship via Legionowo, Nasielsk, Modlin, Ciechanów and Mława, at all of which some trains terminate.\nThe station was closed in March 2017 for the reconstruction of the railway line. Upon reopening in October 2018, its name was changed from Warszawa Kasprzaka to Warszawa Wola, taking the name previously used by a station merged in 2012 into the Warszawa Zachodnia railway station.\nFile:2007-06-14_Dworzec_PKP_Kasprzaka_w_Warszawie.jpg|station platforms in 2007\nFile:2007-06-14 Dworzec PKP Kasprzaka w Warszawie - schody.jpg|entrance to Warszawa Kasprzaka from street level.\nFile:Przystanek kolejowy Warszawa Kasprzaka 2016.JPG|station platforms in 2016\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Station article at [http://www.kolej.one.pl/index.php?dzial=stacje&id=5246&okno=start kolej.one.pl]\n*"
