Though structured as a single-tier municipality, Kawartha Lakes is the size of a typical Ontario county and is mostly rural. It is the second largest single-tier municipality in Ontario by land area (after Greater Sudbury).\nThe main population centres are the communities of Lindsay (population: 22,367), Bobcaygeon (population: 3,576), Fenelon Falls (population: 2,490), Omemee (population: 1,060) and Woodville (population: 718).\nHistory\nThe Kawartha Lakes area is situated on the traditional territory of the Anishinaabeg, Huron-Wendat and more recently, the Haudenosaunee peoples. The city's name is from the Kawartha Lakes. Kawartha is an anglicization of Ka-wa-tha (from Ka-wa-tae-gum-maug or Gaa-waategamaag), which was coined in 1895 by Martha Whetung of the Curve Lake First Nations. It meant \"land of reflections\" in the Anishinaabe language, according to Whetung. The word was later changed by tourism promoters to Kawartha, meaning \"bright waters and happy lands.\"\nPrior to its restructuring as a city, the area was known as Victoria County. The city was created in 2001, during the ruling provincial Progressive Conservative party's \"Common Sense Revolution\". Through provincial legislation, the former Victoria County and its constituent municipalities were amalgamated into one entity named the City of Kawartha Lakes.\nThis act was implemented by the Victoria County Restructuring Commission, led by commissioner Harry Kitchen. Despite a general opposition from residents of the area, the provincial government pushed forward with the amalgamation, which officially came into effect on January 1, 2001.\nBy a narrow margin (51% for, 49% against), the citizens of Kawartha Lakes voted to de-amalgamate in a November 2003 local plebiscite, but the provincial and municipal governments have not taken any steps since the vote to initiate de-amalgamation.\nVictoria County\nPrior to 2001, Victoria County consisted of 13 separate townships and 6 incorporated communities, each with their own local governments:\nThe incorporated townships were (with main population centres):\n*Bexley (Victoria Road, Coboconk)\n*Carden (Dalrymple)\n*Dalton (Sebright, Uphill, Sadowa)\n*Eldon (Glenarm, Kirkfield, Woodville)\n*Emily (Omemee, Downeyville, Fowlers Corners)\n*Fenelon (Cameron, Cambray, Powles Corners)\n*Laxton, Digby and Longford (Uphill, Norland)\n*Longford (largely uninhabited)\n*Manvers (Janetville, Bethany, Pontypool)\n*Mariposa (Oakwood, Little Britain, Manilla)\n*Ops (Reaboro)\n*Somerville (Coboconk, Kinmount)\n*Verulam (Dunsford, Bobcaygeon)\nThe township of Laxton, Digby and Longford is an amalgamation of the once individual townships of Digby and Laxton, and half of the original Longford Township. The separate township of Longford is uninhabited, though dotted with abandoned logging towns. In 2000, just prior to amalgamation into the city of Kawartha Lakes, the township of Verulam and the village of Bobcaygeon were amalgamated into the Municipality of Bobcaygeon/Verulam, and the separate townships of Carden and Dalton amalgamated into the Township of Carden/Dalton.\nIncorporated communities were:\n*Town of Lindsay\n*Village of Bobcaygeon\n*Village of Fenelon Falls\n*Village of Omemee\n*Village of Sturgeon Point\n*Village of Woodville\nGeography\nSurrounding counties are:\n*Muskoka District Municipality\n*Haliburton County\n*Northumberland County\n*Peterborough County\n*Regional Municipality of Durham\n*Simcoe County\nCommunities\n*Ancona Point\n*Bethany\n*Bobcaygeon\n*Bolsover\n*Burnt River\n*Cameron\n*Coboconk\n*Dalrymple\n*Dongola\n*East Emily\n*Eldon\n*Fenelon Falls\n*Glenarm\n*Head Lake\n*Kinmount\n*Kirkfield\n*Lindsay\n*Little Britain\n*Lorneville\n*Manvers\n*Mariposa\n*Norland\n*Omemee\n*Pontypool\n*Rokeby\n*Rosedale\n*''St. Mary's\n*Sturgeon Point\n*Valentia\n*Victoria Road\n*View Lake\n*Woodville\nClimate\nThe Kawartha Lakes area has a humid continental climate with warm, sometimes humid summers and cold snowy winters. The snowier areas are typically the ones closer to large lakes, and snow usually ranges from 150&nbsp;cm to 200&nbsp;cm in a year in most areas.\n}}\n|date=August 2010\n}}\nDemographics\nIn the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Kawartha Lakes had a population of  living in  of its  total private dwellings, a change of |75423|1}} from its 2016 population of .
