The capital of the Sunda Kingdom moved several times during its history, shifting between the Galuh (Kawali) area in the east and Pakuan Pajajaran in the west.\nThe Sunda Kingdom reached its peak during the reign of King Sri Baduga Maharaja, whose reign from 1482 to 1521 is traditionally remembered as an age of peace and prosperity among Sundanese people.\ndepicting the nobility of the Sundanese kingdom of Pajajaran presenting the Royal Crown.]]\nAccording to primary historical records such as the Bujangga Manik manuscript, the eastern border of the kingdom was the Pemali River (Ci Pamali; the present-day Brebes River) and the Serayu River (Ci Sarayu) in Central Java. Most accounts of the Sunda Kingdom come from primary historical records from the 16th century. The kingdom's inhabitants were primarily the eponymous ethnic Sundanese, while the majority religion was Hinduism.\nEtymology\n.]]\nThe name Sunda derives from the Sanskrit prefix su- which means \"goodness\" or \"possessing good quality\". The example is suvarna (lit: \"good color\") used to describe gold. Sunda is also another name for Hindu God Vishnu. In Sanskrit, the term Sundara (masculine) or Sundari (feminine) means \"beautiful\" or \"excellence\". According to Reinout Willem van Bemmelen, a Dutch geologist, the name Sunda was derived from Sanskrit term Shuddha, which means 'white' and 'pure'. The term Sunda also means 'bright, light, purity, cleanness, and white'.\nThe name Sunda is also known in Hindu mythology of Sunda and Upasunda, as one of the powerful Asura brothers that received the boon of invulnerability from Brahma. It is not clear, however, whether the eponymous Sunda was derived from this Hindu myth.\nIt seems that by the 10th century, the name Sunda was used by foreigners, possibly by early Indian explorers, Malay Srivijayan traders and colonizer, as well as Javanese neighbours, as a toponym to identify the Western parts of Java. The Juru Pangambat inscription, dated from 854 Saka (932 CE), confirmes this. The name is similarly used by the Javanese to identify their western neighbour, also rival and enemy, as mentioned in Horren inscription (c. 11th century) from Kediri.\nAn early 13th-century Chinese account reported the pepper port of ''Sin-t'o (Sunda), which probably referred to the port of Banten or Sunda Kalapa. By the 15th to 16th century, after the consolidation of the kingdom by Sri Baduga Maharaja, the name Sunda had shifted from a toponym, into a name that identified a kingdom and its people. The Sunda Strait is named after the Sunda Kingdom, the latter having once ruled the area on both coasts of the strait.\nHistoriography\nKnowledge of the kingdom among Sundanese people has been kept alive through Sundanese Pantun oral tradition, the chant of poetic verses about the golden age of Sunda Pajajaran, and the legend of Prabu Siliwangi, the most popular king of Sunda.\nSeveral stone inscriptions mention the kingdom, such as Juru Pangambat, Jayabupati, Kawali, and Batutulis. Most account and records of the Sunda Kingdom are derived from manuscripts dated from a later period circa 15th to 16th century, such as Bujangga Manik, Sanghyang Siksakanda ng Karesian, Carita Parahyangan, and Kidung Sunda.\nLocal account\n(dated 1533), in Bogor, commemorate the great King of Sunda Sri Baduga Maharaja (rule 1482–1521).]]\nThe earliest reference to the name \"Sunda\" being used to identify a kingdom is the Kebon Kopi II inscription dated 854 Saka (932 CE). This inscription is in the Kawi script, but the language used is Old Malay. It translates as follows:\nAnother reference to the kingdom is the Jayabupati inscription which consists of 40 lines written on four pieces of stone, found on the Cicatih river bank in Cibadak, Sukabumi. This inscription is again written in Kawi script, and mentions the establishment of a protected sacred area called Sanghyang Tapak by the King Jayabhupati of Sunda. The inscription is dated to 1030 CE.\nCopperplate letters dating to the 15th century, including royal instructions, also support the existence of the Sunda Kingdom. The copperplate inscription of Kebantenan I (Jayagiri) reads that Raja Rahyang Niskala Wastu Kancana sent an order through Hyang Ningrat Kancana to the Susuhunan of Pakuan Pajajaran to take care of dayohan in Jayagiri and Sunda Sembawa, banning the collection of collecting taxes from the residents, because they would be knowledgeable about the Hindu religion and worshipped the gods.\n(Sri Baduga Maharaja), the legendary king of the Sunda Kingdom.]]\nThe Kebantenan II (or Sunda Sembawa I) copperplate inscription announces Sri Baduga Maharaja (1482–1521), the king in Pakuan, approved an already delineated sacred estate (tanah devasasana) put at the disposal of the wiku'' (priests), which must not be split as it houses facilities for worship, which belong to the king. The Kebantenan III (Sunda Sembawa II) copperplate inscription announces the king of Sunda's sanctions of holy construction in Sunda Sembawa. The Kebantenan IV inscription details that Sri Baduga Maharaja, who ruled in Pakuan, sanctioned a similar sacred estate at Gunung Samya (Mount Rancamaya).\nThe Batutulis inscription is still in situ at its original location. This inscription commemorates the great king of the Sundanese kingdom named Prabu Guru Dewata Prana who was later crowned as Sri Baduga Maharaja Ratu Haji at Pakuan Pajajaran Sri Sang Ratu Dewata. The king's genealogy states that he was the son of Rahyang Dewa Niskala who died in Gunung Tiga, and the grandson of Rahyang Niskala Wastu Kancana who died in Nusa Larang. It was stated that Sri Baduga had made several works, including making defensive ditches to protect the city of Pakuan, making memorials, making gugunungan (mountains, perhaps punden terraces), making paving halls with rocks, samida forests or making ceremonial places, as well as create telaga warna.\nThe Bujangga Manik] manuscript is the primary source on the daily life of the Sunda Kingdom in the late 15th to early 16th century. Detailing place names, culture and customs, in great detail, it is considered one of the important specimens of Old Sundanese literature. The manuscript tells the story of Jaya Pakuan alias Bujangga Manik, though a prince at the court of Pakuan Pajajaran, preferred to live a solitary life as a devout Hindu. As a hermit traveller, the book details two journeys from Pakuan Pajajaran to central and eastern Java and back, the second journey including a visit to Bali. It is concluded that Jaya Pakuan practised asceticism on a mountain in western Java until his death. As manuscript dates from the pre-Islamic Sunda era, it is written in an older form of Sundanese. It does not contain any words traceable to Arabic. Islamic influence is absent from the content of the story as well. The specific mention of Majapahit, Malacca, and Demak, allow us to date the writing of the story in the 15th century, probably the latter part of this century, or the early 16th century at the latest.\nChinese account\n, a type of junk, which also incorporates Chinese techniques, such as using iron nails alongside wooden dowels, the construction of watertight bulkhead, and addition of central rudder.]]\nwith Julang Ngapak roof in Garut circa 1920s. It was built on poles and having a thatched roof, as described in a 12th-century Chinese source.]]\nAccording to F. Hirt and W.W. Rockhill, there are Chinese sources concerning the Sunda Kingdom. At the time of the Southern Sung dynasty, the inspector of trade with foreign countries, Chau Ju-kua, collected reports from sailors and merchants who had visited foreign countries. His report on far countries, Chu-fan-chi, written from 1178 to 1225 AD, mentions the deepwater harbour of Sin-t’o (Sunda). Chu-fan-chi reported that:\nAccording to this source, the kingdom of Sunda produced high-quality black pepper. The kingdom located in the western parts of Java near Sunda Strait, corresponds to today Banten, Jakarta, and the west part of West Java province. According to this source, the port of Sunda was under Srivijaya mandala domination. This Port of Sunda was highly possible to refer to Old Banten instead of Kalapa (present-day North Jakarta). Its capital is located 10 kilometres inland southward in Banten Girang near Mount Pulosari.\nThe Chinese book “Shun-Feng Hsiang-Sung\" from around 1430 AD relates:\nAccording to this source, the port of Sunda was located west of Kalapa and later identified as the port of Old Banten.\nEuropean account\nEuropean explorers, mainly Portuguese based in Malacca, also reported the existence of the Sunda Kingdom. Tomé Pires (1513) mentioned a Western Java kingdom that had established trade relation with them as Regño de Çumda, which means \"Kingdom of Sunda\". Also the report of Antonio Pigafetta (1522) that mentioned Sunda as a pepper producing region.}}\nThe Portuguese report is dated from a later period of the kingdom, shortly before its fall to forces of the Sultanate of Banten.\nHistory\nHindu temple in Priangan highlands, estimated was built in the 7th century.]]\nThe history of the Sunda Kingdom spanned for almost a millennium, between the 7th to 16th century. One of the few remnants is the 7th century Bojongmenje Hindu temple near Bandung. It was one of the earliest temple structures in Java, older than temples of Dieng in Central Java, and linked to the Sunda Kingdom.\nThe earlier period is unclear, much owed to only two manuscripts dated from a much later period, the Carita Parahyangan''. Its relations to Tarumanagara, a previous kingdom in western Java is unknown. The history of later period, however, after the late 14th century, is clearer especially following the reign of King Wastu Kancana and Sri Baduga Maharaja. This is contributed mainly to the availability of historical sources, including numbers of foreign reports, especially Portuguese's Suma Oriental, several stone inscriptions (prasasti) especially Batutulis, and native primary historical manuscripts of Bujangga Manik and Sanghyang Siksakanda ng Karesian.\nRakryan Juru Pangambat\nAccording to Kebon Kopi II inscription, dated from 932, discovered near Bogor, a skilled hunter named Rakryan Juru Pangambat, declared that the authority is restored to the king of Sunda. This inscription was written in Kawi alphabet, however curiously the language being used is Old Malay. Archaeologist F.D.K. Bosch proposed that this suggests Srivijayan influence over western Java. French historian, Claude Guillot proposed that this was a declaration of independence of the Sunda Kingdom, possibly from Srivijaya.\nJayabupati\nin Sukabumi.]]\nAccording to Sanghyang Tapak inscription, dated from 1030 found in Cibadak near Sukabumi, a king, Maharaja Sri Jayabupati, has established a sacred sanctuary of Sanghyang Tapak. Curiously, the style of the inscriptions reveal an East Javanese script, language, and style, akin to Dharmawangsa's court of Mataram. This has led to suggestions that the Sunda Kingdom at this time probably was under the influence of Mataram, or probably Jayabupati subscribed to Javanese culture.\nSri Jayabupati in Carita Parahyangan is mentioned as Prabu Detya Maharaja. The 11th century Horren inscription found in southern Kediri, reported that çatru Sunda (\"enemy from Sunda\") had invaded and menacing villages in East Java.\nAfter Sri Jayabupati, there is no stone inscription discovered mentioning the next ruler. There is no tangible evidence discovered from the period between the 11th to the 14th century. Most of our current knowledge about this period came from Carita Parahyangan.\nThe Song Chinese source, Chu-fan-chi circa 1200, mentioned that Srivijaya still ruled Sumatra, the Malay peninsula, and Sin-to (Sunda). The source describes the port of Sunda as strategic and thriving, pepper from Sunda being among the best in quality. The people worked in agriculture and their houses were built on wooden poles (rumah panggung). However, robbers and thieves plagued the country. The port of Sunda referred by Chou Ju-kua probably referred to Old Banten, instead of Sunda Kelapa. It seems that by the early 13th century, the maritime trade was still dominated by Srivijayan mandala based in Sumatra.\nGolden age\nThe name Sunda appeared in Javanese source, the Pararaton, reported that in 1336, during the inauguration of his newly appointed position as Prime Minister, Gajah Mada declared the Palapa oath, which stated his foreign policy to unify the archipelago under Majapahit domination. Pararaton recorded what Gajah Mada had said:\nTranslation:\nSunda was mentioned as one of the kingdoms targeted by Mada's overseas campaign. It seems by the early 14th century, the Kingdom of Sunda has grown quite prosperous and took part in international maritime trade.\nPrabu Maharaja\nThe Carita Parahyangan and Pararaton named him as Prěbu Maharaja, while the pseudohistorical Wangsakerta give a detailed name of Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana. He ruled from Kawali Galuh, and died in the Battle of Bubat in 1357, fell victim to a stratagem crafted by the Majapahit prime minister, Gajah Mada.\nHayam Wuruk, the king of Majapahit, intended to marry Princess Dyah Pitaloka, the daughter of Prabu Maharaja. Delighted, the Sunda king and his royal family came to Majapahit, to marry off his daughter to Hayam Wuruk. The Sunda party erected the encampment on Bubat square in the northern part of Trowulan and awaited the proper wedding ceremony. Gajah Mada however, saw this event as an opportunity to demand Sunda's submission to Majapahit overlordship and insisted that the princess was to be presented as a token of submission.\nAngered and humiliated, the Sunda king decided to cancel the wedding and to return home, resulting in a skirmish between the Sunda royal family and the Majapahit army. Outnumbered, almost the entire Sundanese party, including the princess, perished in this tragedy. The tradition says Princess Dyah Pitaloka committed suicide to defend the honour of her country. After his death, Prabu Maharaja was revered as Prabu Wangi () for the heroic defence of his honour. Thus his successors, the later kings of Sunda, were later called Siliwangi (lit. successor of Wangi). The story is the main theme of the book Kidung Sunda, another source reporting this incident found in Bali.\nNiskala Wastu Kancana\ns.]]\nThe next king of Sunda was Niskala Wastu Kancana, who was the youngest son of Prabu Maharaja and younger brother to Princess Dyah Pitaloka, who both perished in Bubat Incident. In 1371, Prince Wastu ascended to the throne, stylized as Prabu Raja Wastu Kancana. According to one of Astana Gede inscriptions, approximately dated from the second half of the 14th century, the king ordered the construction of defensive structures, walls and moats surrounding Kawali city, and renovated Surawisesa palace. The construction of moats and other defensive measures, was probably as a response to a perceived foreign threat. Especially since the relations between Sunda and its powerful eastern neighbour Majapahit empire badly deteriorated following the Bubat incident. Niskala Wastu then resided in Kawali palace of Galuh. His reign is remembered as a long era of peace and prosperity.\nThe copperplate inscription of Kebantenan I reads that Raja Rahyang Niskala Wastu Kancana sent an order through Hyang Ningrat Kancana to the Susuhunan of Pakuan Pajajaran to take care of dayohan in Jayagiri and Sunda Sembawa, banning the collection of taxes from the residents because they were knowledgeable about the Hindu religion and worshipped the gods.\nAccording to Batutulis inscription, Rahyang Niskala Wastu Kancana was buried in Nusalarang, and supported by Carita Parahyangan manuscript that mentioned \"Prebu Niskala Wastu Kancana surup di Nusalarang ring giri Wanakusumah\". At this point, the capital was still located in Galuh, more precisely in Kawali city.\nNingrat Kancana\nNiskala Wastu Kancana's son, named as Tohaan di Galuh (Lord of Galuh) in Carita Parahyangan, succeeded him as the king. He was mentioned in Kebantenan I inscription as Hyang Ningrat Kancana and in Batutulis inscription as Rahyang Dewa Niskala.\nThe new king, however, reigned for only seven years and subsequently demoted. Carita Parahyangan tells that \"... kena salah twa(h) bogo(h) ka estri larangan ti kaluaran ..,\" which translate as \"because (his) wrongdoing, fell in love with a forbidden outsider woman.\" Although it was unclear as to what the line mean, it was possible that the forbidden outsider woman was a Muslim, signifying the presence of Islam in western Java.\nAccording to the Batutulis inscription, Rahyang Dewa Niskala was later buried in Gunatiga. This information is supported by Carita Parahyangan which mentioned that Tohaan di Galuh was nu surup di Gunung Tilu' 'died or buried in Gunung Tilu' (tilu means 'three'), which corresponds to Gunung Tilu mountain range located east of the town of Kuningan.\nSri Baduga Maharaja\nSang Ratu Jayadewata (reigned 1482 to 1521) or also known as Sri Baduga Maharaja, is a grandson of Prabu Wastu Kancana. Jayadewata is often linked with a popular character Prabu Siliwangi in the Sundanese oral tradition of pantun.\nKing Jayadewata moved the government seat from Kawali back to Pakuan in 1482. It is not clear, however, the reason behind the transfer of capital westward; it might be a geopolitical move to secure the capital away from the eastern threat from the rising Muslim power of Demak in Central Java. By 1482, according to Purwaka Caruban Nagari, a Cirebon chronicle, Cirebon declared its independence from Sunda and no longer sent tribute to the Sunda court. Based on the Kebantenan copperplate inscription, he established a tanah devasasana sacred estate at Mount Samya or Rancamaya. He also announced the construction of a sacred compound in Sunda Sembawa, stipulated as the resident of the priests.\nAccording to Batutulis inscription, Sri Baduga Maharaja built defensive moats surrounding Pakuan Pajajaran; he built gugunungan (sacred mounds), established huts and sacred Samya forest, reserves for wood destined for offerings, and the artificial lake Talaga Rena Mahawijaya (which apparently served as a reservoir). Certainly, there was a good road to Sunda Kalapa (present-day Jakarta), the most important harbour of the Sunda kingdom. At the time of Tome Pirés's visit to Pakuan, Sri Baduga Maharaja reigned over the Sunda kingdom.\nThe reign of King Jayadewata was hailed as the golden age of the Sundanese people. The kingdom consolidated its rule and exercised power throughout the western part of Java. It also marked the era of great prosperity resulting from efficient agriculture management and the thriving pepper trade in the region. This era of great wealth also marked the beginning of the Sunda kingdom's decline.\nDecline\nDuring the reign of King Jayadewata, there was already a group of Sunda inhabitants that had converted to Islam, as testified by Portuguese account. Tomé Pires in 1513 reported, there was a significant number of Muslims residing in the port of Cimanuk (today Indramayu), the easternmost port of Sunda Kingdom. According to a Portuguese report, the port of Cirebon which is located just east of Cimanuk is already a Muslim port by that time, ruled by Javanese.\nThese new converts most probably were the people referred to in Carita Parahyangan as \"those who felt no peace because of having strayed from Sanghyang Siksa\". Nevertheless, during this time, Islamic influence had not yet penetrated inland into the capital. As mentioned in Carita Parahyangan that \"mana mo kadatangan ku musuh ganal, musu(h) alit\", which means the capital is \"safe from rough/coarse enemy, (as well as) soft/subtle enemy\". The term \"coarse enemy\" refers to an actual invading foreign army, while \"subtle enemy\" refers to the propagation of a new faith or new religion that might upset the established spiritual order of the kingdom.\nThe kingdom anxiously watched the growing influence of the expansive Islamic Sultanate of Demak that finally succeeded in destroying Daha, the remnant of the Hindu Majapahit court in 1527. As a result of this event, only Blambangan in the eastern edge of Java, and Sunda in the western part remained Hindu kingdoms in Java. Meanwhile, in the land of Sunda, Muslim influences started to penetrate the kingdom.\nRise of Muslim Cirebon and Banten\nof Cirebon. By 1482, the Sunda kingdom lost its important eastern port of Cirebon.]]\nBujangga Manik manuscript, written circa the second half of the 15th century reported that the eastern boundary of Sunda Kingdom realm was the Cipamali river in present-day Brebes. However, the Portuguese Suma Oriental in 1513 reported that the eastern border of Sunda Kingdom is located in the port of Chemano (Cimanuk), the estuarine of Manuk River. This means between 1450 and 1513 the kingdom has lost control of the area surrounding Cirebon, between Brebes and Indramayu on the northeastern part of the kingdom. This signifies the coastal Muslim Javanese push westward into once a traditional Sundanese territory, as Demak Sultanate was responsible as the patron for the rise of Cirebon.\nThe detail of the Sunda Kingdom and its relations with the rise of Cirebon Sultanate, mostly were taken from the account of Purwaka Caruban Nagari, a manuscript of Cirebon chronicle which claimed Cirebon as the rightful successor of Sunda Kingdom.\nAccording to Purwaka Caruban Nagari, a Sunda king Prabu Siliwangi married Nyai Subang Larang, daughter of Ki Gedeng Tapa, port master of Muara Jati (today Cirebon). They had three children: Prince Walangsungsang, Princess Rara Santang, and Prince Kian Santang. Although Prince Walangsungsang was the first-born son of the King, the prince did not earn the right as a crown prince of Sunda Kingdom. This was because his mother, Nyai Subang Larang was not the queen consort. Another reason was because of his conversion to Islam, probably influenced by his mother as she is a Muslim. In the 16th century western Java, the prevalent faith practiced was Hinduism, Sundanese ancestral religion, and Buddhism. It was his half brother, Prabuwisesa, the king's son from his third wife Nyai Cantring Manikmayang, who was chosen as the crown prince.\nWalangsungsang later moved to a settlement called Dukuh Alang-alang on 1445. After Ki Gedeng Alang-Alang's death in 1447, Walangsungsang appointed as the ruler of the town and established a court and assumed a new title as Prince Cakrabuana. King Siliwangi sent his envoy Tumenggung Jagabaya and Raja Sengara, to bestow Prince Carkrabuana with the title Tumenggung Sri Mangana. The settlement, now called Cirebon grew into a thriving port, yet Cakrabuana was still loyal to his father and sent tribute to the main court of Sunda. At that time Cirebon was still a principality within the Sunda Kingdom.\nIn 1479, Cakrabuana was succeeded by his nephew, Sharif Hidayatullah, the son of his sister Nyai Rara Santang. He married his cousin, Nyi Mas Pakungwati daughter of Cakrabuana. He is popularly known with his posthumously name Sunan Gunungjati. On 2 April 1482, Sunan Gunungjati stated that Cirebon will no longer send tribute to Pajajaran, which marked the proclamation that the Sultanate of Cirebon is independent from Sunda Pajajaran.\nThe character described in Purwaka Caruban Nagari, as Prabu Siliwangi, matched the historic character of Dewa Niskala or Ningrat Kancana, referred as Lord of Galuh in Carita Parahyangan. Tohaan di Galuh was the son and heir of Niskala Wastu Kancana.\nThe pressure from coastal Javan Islamic states drove the king of Sunda, Sri Baduga Maharaja, to seek assistance from the Portuguese at Malacca. In 1512 and again in 1521, he sent his son, the crown prince Surawisesa also known as Ratu Sang Hyang (Samian) to Malacca to request the Portuguese to sign an alliance treaty, to trade in pepper and to build a fort at his main port of Sunda Kalapa. Sunan Gunung Jati's son later also established the Sultanate of Banten, which later become a menace for the Hindu Sunda Kingdom.\nSurawisesa and Sunda–Portuguese Treaty 1522\nAfter Sri Baduga Maharaja's death in 1521, the succeeding kings, Prabu Surawisesa Jayaperkosa, also known as Ratu Sang Hyang whom the Portuguese called Ratu Samian, faced the threat of Cirebon and Demak. Under this threat, Surawisesa, who reigned from 1521 to 1535, concluded the treaty with Portuguese from Malacca to establish a warehouse and fortress at Sunda Kelapa in return for protection against the threat of these Islamic Sultanates.\nBy 1522, the Portuguese were ready to form a coalition with the King of Sunda to get access to his lucrative pepper trade. The commander of Malacca, Jorge de Albuquerque, sent a ship, the São Sebastião, under Captain Henrique Leme, to Sunda Kalapa with valuable gifts for the king of Sunda. Two written sources describe the concluding of the treaty in detail, the original Portuguese document of 1522 with the text of the treaty and the signatories of the witnesses, and a report on that event by João de Barros in his book Da Ásia, printed after 1777/78.\nThe king welcomed them warmly upon their arrival. The crown prince had succeeded his father and was now King Prabu Surawisesa, although Barros called him King Samião. This Sunda ruler agreed to an arrangement of friendship with the King of Portugal and granted a fortress at the mouth of the Ciliwung River where the Portuguese could load as many peppers as they wished. In addition, he pledged, dating from the start of construction on the fortress, each year he would donate one thousand sacks of pepper to the Portuguese king. The contract document was drafted into two copies and signed. On the said day in 1522, Henrique Leme of Portuguese and his entourage together with deputies of the King of Sunda erected a commemoration stone at the mouth of the Ciliwung River.\nThe fall of Sunda Kalapa\n, South Jakarta, Sunda Kingdom period]]\nThis trade and defence treaty was fallen apart tremendously due to Portuguese failure to deliver their promise to construct the fortress in Kalapa. The delay was caused by troubles in Goa. To make things worse, in 1527 Fatahillah, a military commander sent from Demak, managed to capture the Sunda Kalapa harbour just before the Portuguese returned.\nThe army of Fatahillah, comprising around Cirebon-Demak troops, conquered Sunda Kalapa. The Sunda authority stationed in the port were fallen. The harbour chief and his family, the royal minister, and all of the people working in the harbour were slaughtered. The port city was completely destroyed and razed, as the Sundanese reinforcements sent from Pakuan was too weak and retreated. The Sunda Kingdom has lost its most important port, thus subsequently Sunda Kalapa was renamed Jayakarta by its Muslim conqueror.\nThirty Portuguese sailors, shipwrecked by storms, swam to the beach at Kalapa only to be killed by Fatahillah's men. The Portuguese recognised the political leadership had changed when they were not allowed to set foot on the land. As they were too weak for a battle, they set sail back to Malacca. The next year, a second attempt failed because of striking sailors angry at not having been paid.\n, the cradle of Jakarta. For centuries it was the royal port of Sunda Kingdom serving the capital Dayeuh Pakuan Pajajaran 60 kilometres inland to the south until it fell to Demak and Cirebon forces in 1527.]]\nThe failure to rely on Portuguese assistance has led Sunda to fend for their own survival by themselves. Carita Parahyangan mentioned that during his 14 years of reign (1521–1535), King Sang Hyang (Surawisesa) has fought in 15 battles. Unbeatable, all in which he managed to repel the series of invading Muslim forces from Cirebon and Demak. He fought in Kalapa, Tanjung, Ancol Kiji, Wahanten Girang, Simpang, Gunung Batu, Saung Agung, Rumbut, Gunung, Gunung Banjar, Padang, Panggoakan, Muntur, Hanum, Pagerwesi, and Medangkahyangan.\nThe war between Cirebon-Demak forces and the Sunda kingdom lasted for almost five years. The king lost thousands of his men. During this war, after Sunda Kalapa, Sunda Kingdom also lost the Port of Banten. Sunan Gunungjati of Cirebon later crowned his son, Hasanuddin, as the king of Banten under the auspices of the Sultan of Demak who, in turn, offered Hasanudin his sister's hand in marriage. Banten was established as the capital of this new sultanate, held as a vassal under Sultanate of Cirebon. Finally, in 1531, a peace treaty was concluded between King Surawisesa of Sunda and Syarif Hidayatullah of Cirebon.\nIn an apparent sorrow after the tremendous defeat and the loss of his two most important ports, Prabu Surawisesa established the Batutulis inscription in 1533 to commemorate his late father. This action was probably an attempt to spiritually appeal for ancestral guidance and protection against the powerful Muslim enemy that now loomed by the gates. Because of ongoing battles, he often could not stay in his palace in Pakuan Pajajaran.\nJaya Dewata\nPrabu Ratu Dewata also known as Sang Ratu Jaya Dewata, was the successor of Prabu Surawisesa. He was, however, not his son. The reign of Prabu Ratu Dewata between 1535 and 1543 was known as a chaotic and difficult one full of hardship, as Islamic forces from Cirebon and Banten tried multiple times to capture the Dayeuh Pakuan capital.\nDuring Ratu Dewata reign, the Carita Parahyangan reported several calamities befell the kingdom; there was a sudden attack, a lot of enemies razed the city, thus mass combat erupted in the grand yard (buruan ageung). In this battle, the noble princes were killed. The chaos has widespread across the kingdom, the attack also occurred in Ciranjang and Sumedang. Another terror was the assassination of the rishis, hermits and Hindu priests that resides in the hermitage sanctuaries. It was reported that the Hindu priests and hermits of mandala Jayagiri, were captured and drowned in the sea. It is highly possible that the attack was launched by Muslim states of Banten or Cirebon. This was a devastating attack straight to the spiritual core of the Sundanese Hindu community.\nUnable to control the kingdom, instead of fulfilling his duty by maintaining the law and order, Prabu Ratu Dewata retreated himself to become a Raja Pandita (priestly king), submitted himself deeply into religious rituals as an apparently desperate appeal for gods' salvation. By this time, Sunda Kingdom were already isolated and confined to the inland.\nLast kings and the fall of Sunda kingdom\nin the 16th century. The Islamic Sultanate of Banten was responsible for the demise of Hindu Sunda Kingdom, and supplant it as the dominant polity in western parts of Java in the following centuries.]]\nSeries of last Sunda kings were notoriously known as incompetent rulers. The successor of Ratu Dewata, King Ratu Sakti reigned from 1543 to 1551, was known as a ruthless king, who indulges himself with sensual pleasure.\nThe next successor that ruled from 1551 to 1567, King Nilakendra, also known as Tohaan di Majaya, is also an incompetent ruler. Instead of fulfilling his duty as a king, he renovates and beautifies the palace. Squander kingdom's fortune by indulging himself in pleasures and luxury.\nBecause of ongoing battles, ironically Tohaan di Majaya could not stay in his newly renovated palace. The last kings of Sunda could no longer reside in Pakuan Pajajaran, since in the 1550s Hasanuddin, the sultan of Banten has launched a successful attack on Dayeuh Pakuan, captured and razed the capital.\nThe surviving Sunda royalties, nobles and common people fled the fallen city, heading to the mountainous wilderness. After the fall of Pakuan Pajajaran, the royal regalia of Sunda Kingdom was evacuated to the eastern principality of Sumedang Larang. Among these regalias are Makuta Binokasih Sanghyang Paké, the royal crown of Sunda. Thus the member of the Sunda dynasty established a surviving minor regional kingdom of Sumedang Larang where Sundanese aristocracy would survive for a few more centuries to come until conquered by Mataram Sultanate in the 17th century.\nFrom 1567 to 1579, under the last king Raja Mulya, also known as Prabu Surya Kencana, the kingdom declined substantially. In Carita Parahyangan, his name is Nusiya Mulya. He ruled further inland in Pulasari, near Pandeglang, at the slope of Mount Palasari. The kingdom has fallen apart, particularly after 1576 due to constant pressure from Banten, and finally collapsed completely in 1579. Thereafter, the Sultanate of Banten took over most of the former Sunda Kingdom's territory, thus ultimately put an end to a millennium of Hindu-Buddhist Dharmic civilization of West Java. By this time, Java has turned more and more Islamic. Only the kingdom of Blambangan on the eastern edge was the last surviving Hindu kingdom in Java, well until its demise in the early 18th century.\nCapital\nThroughout Sunda's history, the centre of cultural and political power often oscillated between the Western Priangan region; initially identified as \"Sunda\", and Eastern Priangan region; traditionally identified as \"Galuh\". The two traditional sites are located in and around modern Bogor city and the town of Ciamis. The two most important capitals are Pakuan Pajajaran, the capital of Sunda; and Kawali, the capital of Galuh.\nKawali\nThe capital of the Galuh Kingdom of the eastern Priangan region, has moved several times. In the older period, the capital was located around the Karang Kamulyan site by the banks of Citanduy river. By the early 14th century, the capital was moved further northwest upstream, in the area now known as Astana Gede, near the current town of Kawali, Ciamis Regency. The city was located on the eastern slope of Mount Sawal near the source of the Citanduy river. A Kawali inscription was discovered here. According to tradition, the keraton in Kawali is called Surawisesa, expanded and renovated by King Niskala Wastu Kancana. Kawali served as the capital of the kingdom for several generations until Sri Baduga Maharaja moved the government back to Pakuan in 1482.\nPakuan Pajajaran\nAfter the fall of Tarumanagara in the 7th century, King Tarusbawa built a new capital city inland near the source of the Cipakancilan river in present-day Bogor. According to Carita Parahyangan, a manuscript from the 15th or 16th century, King Tarusbawa was only mentioned as Tohaan (Lord/King) of Sunda. He was the ancestor of a series of Sunda kings that reigned until 723. Pakuan served as the capital of Sunda during the reign of several kings, and the court shifted to Kawali until Sri Baduga Maharaja moved the court from Kawali back to Pakuan in 1482.\nThe city was permanently settled since at least the 10th century, but not gaining major political importance until King Jayadewata established it as the royal capital of the Sunda kingdom in the 15th century. In 1513, the city was visited by its first European visitor, Tomé Pires, the Portuguese envoy. According to his report, the city of Daio (Dayeuh is a Sundanese term for \"capital city\") was great city, with population around 50,000 inhabitants.\nThe tradition hailed that King Jayadewata ruled justly from his beautiful Kadatwan (palace) called Sri Bima Punta Narayana Madura Suradipati at Pakuan Pajajaran, and his reign is celebrated as the golden age for Sundanese people.\nAfter the reign of King Jayadewata (Sri Baduga Maharaja), Pakuan Pajajaran served as the royal capital for several generations. Dayeuh Pakuan Pajajaran served as the capital of the Sunda Kingdom for almost a hundred years (1482 – 1579), until it was razed and destroyed by the Sultanate of Banten in 1579.\nBecause Pakuan, the capital city of the Sunda kingdom laid between two parallel rivers, Ciliwung and Cisadane, it was called Pajajaran (lit. place laid between two parallel things) or Pakuan Pajajaran. Although primary local and European historical records referred to the kingdom in the western part of Java island as the Sunda Kingdom, the Sundanese, especially after the establishment of the Sultanate of Banten and Cirebon, referred to the kingdom (minus the coastal sultanates) as \"Pakuan Pajajaran\" Kingdom, or simply as the Pakuan Kingdom or the Pajajaran Kingdom. The later name – Pajajaran – is more familiar for people residing in West Java and the Javanese of Mataram region (current Yogyakarta and Solo).\nGovernment and economy\nAdministration\nand become their regalia.]]\nIn many historical sources, including manuscripts, inscriptions, as well as foreign historical accounts from\nChina and Portuguese reports, all refer to \"Sunda\" as a kingdom. On the other hand, the term \"Pakuan\" and \"Pajajaran\" or \"Dayeuh\" refer to its capital which corresponds to the modern city of Bogor. The tangible evidence on the existence of a kingdom as an administrative social structure, was found in Sanghyang Tapak inscription dated 952 Saka (1030 CE), that mentioned Prahajyan Suṇḍa (Sunda Kingdom), with Sri Jayabhupati claimed as haji ri Suṇḍa (the king of Sunda).\nThrough the study on the 14th century inscriptions in Astana Gede site in Kawali, historian suggests that the political model of Sunda Kingdom adhered the concept of Tri Tangtu di Buana, which administrative power was distributed in triad among three elements; Prebu (king), Rama (village chief or regional elder) and Resi (rishi priestly class of religious authority).\nAccording to Tomé Pires (1513), the Sunda kingdom is ruled by a paramount raja (king or monarch), and the right of the throne inheritance descended from a father to his son. However, in the case when a king did not produce a male heir, the successor is elected from the lesser kings, the rulers of regional towns or provinces. These lesser kings are called Tohaan (lord) that acts as local governor, and most are related to the king, which means they belong in the same dynasty.\nMuch of our current knowledge on detailed social order and the bureaucracy structure of the kingdom, is owed to the Sundanese manuscript of Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian, compiled around 1518.\n}}\nAccording to Carita Parahyangan, all regional ruler (governor), rama (village chief), government officials, and rishi (Hindu priests), are required to make a formal annual visit to the capital; paying homage, tax or tribute to the court. As mentioned in some fragments of this manuscript:\n\"..., ti Kandangwesi pamwat siya ka Pakwan...\" (\"... from Kandangwesi the tribute was sent to Pakuan\"),\n\"..., anaking sang Prebu Rama, Resi samadaya sarerea siya marek ka Pakwan unggal tahun...\" (\"... my son the chief of the village, the rishis together all paid a visit to Pakuan every years\").}}\nAnother Portuguese explorer, Diogo do Couto, wrote that the Sunda kingdom is thriving and abundant; it lies between Java and Sumatra, separated from the latter by the Sunda Strait. Many islands lie along the coast of this kingdom within the strait, for nearly the space of forty leagues; the strait's widest point is about twenty-five and narrowest point only twelve leagues broad. Bantam is about the midpoint. All the islands are well timbered but have little water. A small one called Macar, at the entrance of Sunda Strait, is said to have much gold.\nHe also noted that the principal ports of the Sunda kingdom were Banten, Ache, Chacatara (Jakarta), which annually receive twenty sommas, ships from Chienheo, China, to ship the eight thousand bahars, which are equal to 3,000,000&nbsp;kg of pepper the kingdom produced.\nBantam is situated at 6° south latitude, in the middle of a bay, three leagues from point to point. The town is eight hundred and fifty fathoms in length, and the seaport extends about 400. A river capable of admitting junks and galleys flows through the middle of the town: a small branch of this river admits boats and small craft.\nThere is a brick fort, the walls of which are seven palms thick, with wooden bulwarks, armed with two tiers of artillery. The anchorage is good, with a muddy or sandy bottom and a depth from two to six fathoms.\nTerritories\nBased on the primary manuscript in Ancient Sundanese, Bujangga Manik (which tells the story of Bujangga Manik's journey, a Sundanese Hinduism priest who visited Hindu holy places on the islands of Java and Bali in the early 16th century), which is currently kept in the Boedlian Library, Oxford University in England since 1627, the boundary of the Sunda Kingdom to the east is Ci Pamali (Pamali River) and Ci Serayu (Serayu River) in Central Java province. Meanwhile, the vassal territory of the Sunda Kingdom stretched from the western tip at Pasar Talo, Bengkulu to Jatimalang, Purworejo at the eastern tip. The Sunda Kingdom, whose capital was Pakuan Pajajaran, also covered the southern part of the island of Sumatra (Ulubelu inscription). After the Sunda Kingdom was destroyed by the Sultanate of Banten, power over the southern region of Sumatra and the western part of Java was continued by the Sultanate of Banten.\nCulture and society\nReligion\nfrom Cibodas village, Cicalengka Subdistrict, Bandung Regency, West Java. Possibly from the Sunda Kingdom period 8th to 9th century.]]\nHinduism was one of the earliest religious influences established in West Java since the era of Tarumanagara, circa early 5th century CE. In fact, West Java was one of the earliest places in Indonesia that being Indianized, also sparked the historic period of Indonesian history by producing the earliest inscription in Java. As Tarumanagara's successor, Sunda Kingdom has inherited this Hindu civilization influences.\nThe culture of the people in the Sunda kingdom blends Hinduism with Sunda Wiwitan; a native shamanism belief, and also a traces of Buddhism is observable. Several intact prehistoric megalithic sites, such as Cipari site in Kuningan and the Pangguyangan menhir and stepped pyramid in Cisolok, Sukabumi, suggest that native shamanic animism and dynamism beliefs coexisted with Hinduism and Buddhism. The native belief, Sunda Wiwitan, persists today as a way of life for the Baduy or Kanekes people who resist Islam and other foreign influences.\nThe Cangkuang Hindu temple in Leles, Garut, dated from the 8th century, was dedicated to Shiva and built during the Galuh kingdom. Buddhist influence came to West Java through the Srivijaya conquest, as the empire dominated West Java until the 11th century. The brick stupas in Batujaya indicate Buddhist influence in West Java, while nearby Cibuaya sites show Hindu influence.\nThe manuscript Carita Parahyangan clearly demonstrate Hinduism spirituality within the Sunda Kingdom society. This manuscript is opened with a legendary character named Sang Resi Guru that had a son named Rajaputra. Comprehensively the manuscript was written by a Hindu scholar which demonstrate the Hindu frame of references. The Hindu pantheon, such as Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesvara, Rudra, Sadasiva, Yama, Varuna, Kuvera, Indra and Besravaka, were also mentioned in the ancient Sundanese manuscript of Sewakadharma or also known as Serat Dewabuda, dated 1357 Saka or 1435 CE.\nThe Sundanese manuscript of spiritual guidance, the Sanghyang Siksakanda ng Karesian also demonstrate Hinduism religious outlook and frame of references, although it seems already mixed with some sorts of Buddhism spirituality. \" ... ini na lakukeuneun, talatah sang sadu jati. Hongkara namo Sewaya, sembah ing hulun di Sanghyang Panca Tatagata; panca ngaran ing lima, tata ma ngaran ing sabda, gata ma ngaran ing raga, ya eta ma pahayueun sareanana .., \", \" ... this has to be done, the true mandate of the good-hearted (or trusted one). Blessed (should be) in the name of Shiva. Worship the servant to Sanghyang Panca Tatagata (Buddha), panca means five, tata means words, gata means body, yes, that is for the good of all\".\nSunda Kingdom period did not produce enough archaeological evidence and records that could give comprehensive knowledge about the religious aspects of its population. Yet, there are few interesting things that suggest a syncretism took place between Hinduism, Buddhism, and a form of local beliefs system. This indication emerged from the veneration of Hyang figure, which considered possess higher status than Hindu-Buddhist deities, as it is shown in Sanghyang Siksakanda Ng Karesian manuscript (1518): \"...mangkubumi bakti di ratu, ratu bakti di dewata, dewata bakti di hyang...\", which means \"...mangkubumi submit to the king, king submit to the gods, and gods submit to hyang...\"\nAncient Sundanese society did not build temples that are meticulously decorated with exquisite bas-reliefs as demonstrated in temples built by neighbouring Javanese in central and east Java that flourished around the same era. Furthermore, their statuary such as Shiva from Cangkuang temple and Ganesha from the Karang Kamulyan site were made such in a very simple form, almost has primitive megalithic style and quality. This has led to the suggestion that Hinduism and Buddhism were not truly and fully embraced by the ancient Sundanese populace because they still rather faithfully adhered to their own vernacular ancestral beliefs system.}}\nThe people of Sunda are said to be truthful. They, with the great city of Dayo, the town and lands and port of Bantam, the port of Pontang, the port of Cheguide, the port of Tangaram, the Port of Tangaram, the port of Calapa, the port of chi Manuk. are justly governed. The king is a great sportsman and hunter. The kingdom descends from father to son. The women are handsome, and those of the nobles chaste, which is not the case with those of the lower classes. There are monasteries of convents for the women, into which the nobles put their daughters when they cannot match them in marriage according to their wishes. The married women, when their husband dies, must, as a point of honour, die with them, and if they should be afraid of death they put into the convents. The inhabitants are not very warlike, much addicted to their idolatries. They are fond of rich arms, ornamented with gold and inlaid work. Their krises are gilt, and also the point of their lances.\nRelations with regional powers\n(1522), a stone pillar with a cross of the Order of Christ commemorating a treaty between Portuguese Kingdom and Hindu Sunda Kingdom, at National Museum of Indonesia, Jakarta.]]\nThe Kingdom is commonly thought of as the successor of Tarumanagara which also flourished in the same location of Western Java. It seems that in its early history, around the 10th to 11th century, Sunda Kingdom was stuck in between two competing mandalas; the Malay Srivijaya in Sumatra in the west and its Javanese neighbouring kingdom in the east.\nIn early of its history, the kingdom seems served as the vassal of Srivijayan mandala. By the 10th century, the kingdom seems to break loose, liberated from the Srivijayan mandala as stated by Rakryan Juru Pangambat inscription (932 CE). However, according to the Chinese Song dynasty book Zhu Fan Zhi, written around 1225 by Zhao Rugua, ''Sin-t'o (Sunda), was still part of San-fo-tsi  (Srivijaya) 15 tributaries.\nThe Kingdom of Sunda has established relations with its eastern neighbour; the kaleidoscope of Javanese kingdoms, from the era of Mataram kingdom back in the 8th century, all the way to Majapahit in the 14th century and Demak in the 16th century. The popular hero, King Sanjaya of Mataram known as the Javanese Mataram King mentioned in Canggal inscription (732), was also mentioned in Sundanese manuscript Carita Parahyangan; as having his root in the Sunda Kingdom.\nThe Sanghyang Tapak inscription (1030) shows Javanese cultural influence, as the style of script, letters, language, and the title of the king is similar to royal names in East Javanese Mataram court. However, the relations might be not quite harmonious, as according to 11th century East Javanese Horren inscription, mentioned çatru Sunda'', which means the village of Horren was attacked by \"the enemy (from) Sunda\".\nThe relations between Sundanese and Javanese kingdoms descended to a new low, when a disastrous incident took place in Bubat square in Majapahit in 1357, killing all of the Sundanese royal party, including the Sunda king Prabu Maharaja and Princess Tohaan Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi. This tragedy severely harmed the relationship between the two kingdoms and resulted in hostility for years to come, the situation never again returning to normality.\nThe nemesis of the Hindu Sunda Kingdom was no doubt the Islamic states of Java northern coast; they are the Demak, Cirebon and later the Banten Sultanate. In order to protect the political and spiritual order of the kingdom, also to protect the economic interest of the Sunda Kingdom against the menace of Muslim Javanese states, King Sang Ratu Jayadewata seek assistance to the Portuguese based in Malacca.\nThe Sunda Kingdom is known as one of the earliest polity in Southeast Asia that has established diplomatic relations with the European nation. The Luso-Sundanese padrão (1522) stone post, commemorating a treaty between the kingdoms of Portugal (based in Malacca) and Sunda. The treaty formed as pepper trade agreement as well as a political alliance against the menace of their common enemies; the Islamic Demak and Cirebon.\nLegacy\nwritten in Sundanese]]\nAlthough the kingdom of Sunda left little archaeological remains, it remains part of the culture of Sundanese people being kept alive through the Pantun oral tradition, the chant of poetic verses.\nAccording to tradition, the Sunda Kingdom under its legendary king, Prabu Siliwangi, is revered as the prosperous and glorious golden age for Sundanese people. The historical identity and the source of pride for Sundanese, the same as Majapahit for Javanese people. The pantun that mentioned Sunda Kingdom (popularly known as Pakuan or Pajajaran):\nTranslation: It was better during the Pajajaran era, when Kuwera (the god of wealth) was still revered. The era when the earth guru was still honoured. The lost era when the essence of teaching is delivered. No farmer had to take loans. No farmer had to sell their lands. No farmer died in vain. No farmer died in hunger.\nTranslation: In the prosperous kingdom of Pakuan, people lacked no food or clothing. Rice was plenteous. The blessing of Dewa Guru laid on the land, so everyone was rich. The land's fame spread to other lands. Dewa Guru ordered Ki Semar to the kingdom of Pakuan!\nSeveral streets in major Indonesian cities, especially in West Java, were named after Sundanese kings and the Sunda Kingdom. The street names such as Jalan Sunda in Jakarta and Bandung, Jalan Pajajaran in Bogor and Bandung, Jalan Siliwangi and Niskala Wastu Kancana in Bandung, are among street names named after Kingdom of Sunda. The Padjadjaran University in Bandung was named for Pakuan Pajajaran, the capital and the popular name for the Sunda Kingdom. The TNI Siliwangi Military Division and Siliwangi Stadium was named for King Siliwangi, the eponymous popular king of Sunda. The West Java state museum, Sri Baduga Museum in Bandung is named after king Sri Baduga Maharaja.\nList of rulers\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" width=\"90%\"\n!width=\"80px\"|Period\n!width=\"80px\"|King's name\n!width=\"80px\"|Ruler of\n!width=\"80px\"|Capital\n!width=\"200px\"|Inscription or Manuscript reference\n!width=\"300px\"|Events\n|-\n|709 – 716\n|Sena/Bratasena\n|Galuh\n|Galuh\n|Carita Parahyangan\n|\n|-\n|716 – 723\n|Purbasora\n|Galuh\n|Galuh\n|Carita Parahyangan\n| Purbasora, Wretikandayun's grandson, rebelled against Sena and took the throne of Galuh in 716\n|-\n|723 – 732\n|Sanjaya/Harisdarma/\nRakeyan Jamri\n|Sunda, Galuh, and Mataram\n|Pakuan\n|Canggal, Carita Parahyangan\n| Sanjaya, son of Sena's sister, Sannaha, married Tarusbawa's daughter, Tejakencana, and become the king of Sunda.
