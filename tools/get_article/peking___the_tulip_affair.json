His mistress, Sim Chan, is an intelligence agent spying on him for the Chinese government.\nCarter is ordered to stop production of the drug and eliminate Bormann. Carter, posing as Canadian journalist Harry Toombs, travels to Peking via Hong Kong, where he meets Hans Danzig – another German chemist. Danzig explains the danger posed by Agent Z and tells Carter it is only effective if injected. Carter leaves his usual weapons (luger, stiletto and gas bomb) behind. His only weapon is Store – another injectable drug, developed by Danzig that induces a week-long state of deathlike suspended animation. Danzig suspects the secret laboratory producing Agent Z is close to Peking.\nCarter flies to Peking and goes to meet his contact. His contact has been murdered but he meets Lotus, his contact's daughter, who is a prostitute. Although estranged from her father on account of her profession she is aware of Carter's mission. Some of the German scientists are her clients. She arranges for Carter to enter the Imperial Palace where Bormann and the scientists are stationed.\nCarter attempts to assassinate Bormann but manages only to inject two sleeping Germans with Store. He persuades Lotus to lure a German to her flat the next night where Carter will be lying in wait. Carter tortures the man into revealing the location of the laboratory where Agent Z is made.\nCarter and Lotus drive to the laboratory complex 100 miles from Peking. Carter is captured and taken inside the camp. Lotus enters disguised as a guard. Kerner and Sim Chan decide to test Agent Z on Carter. Carter convinces Sim Chan that Kerner and the Germans are using the Chinese to create a new Germany and that they will never hand over Agent Z to them. Carter is injected and apparently dies instantly. Two guards remove his body. A furious Sim Chan stabs Kerner to death for his treachery then drives to Peking to confront Bormann.\nLotus kills the other guard and revives Carter with the antidote to Store, which she had managed to switch with Agent Z in the laboratory. Carter returns to the lab and starts a fire with some chemicals.\nBormann sends Captain Stryker back to the laboratory to question the staff and nearby villagers about what happened and to confirm Carter's death. Stryker finds Carter and Lotus recuperating in a nearby village. Carter kills Stryker in hand-to-hand combat, steals his uniform and car and drives back to Peking.\nBormann discovers Lotus is the daughter of the AXE informant he had murdered and that she helped Carter break into the Imperial Palace. He goes to her apartment and waits for Carter and Lotus to return. Bormann confronts Carter. Just as he is about to kill him Sim Chan appears. They both shoot each other. Sim Chan is killed and Bormann wounded. Lotus tries to kill Bormann but is shot dead. Bormann escapes into the night badly wounded.
