It was later ported as a desk accessory to the Macintosh in 1989 by Kenji Gotoh. He also designed the sleeping graphics for Neko. An X version was later made by Masayuki Koba.\nIn the application, a sprite follows the mouse pointer around. In the System 7 version, the pointer could be modified to various cat toys such as a mouse, fish, or bird.  When Neko caught up with the pointer, it would stare at the screen for a few seconds, scratch an itch on its body, yawn, and fall asleep until the pointer was disturbed. In windowed mode, Neko would stop at window boundaries and scratch at the edge of the window.\nOther appearances\nThe Neko cat has been used as a sprite in many other programs.\n* In 1995, a shareware game for the Macintosh called Kitten Shaver had used sprites that looked similar to Neko. The object of the game was cruel but humorous, as the player would have to shave the cats, with various layers of fur, as they ran across the screen within a limited time. The game was a parody of a game called Bunny Killer. Kitten Shaver was such a success, that a sequel called ''Kitten Shaver 2: Kitty's Revenge'' was released in 1997.\n* Neko has been ported to many other systems:\n** There is also a Neko screensaver for NEXTSTEP.\n** Neko was available on Acorn Computers' RISC OS.\n** Windows 3.x variants Michael Bankstahl (1991), Dara T.

There's also a free-standing application for OS X 10.4 and up.\n** A shareware port titled Cat! or TopCAT! was made for Microsoft Windows 3.1 by Robert Dannbauer in 1991.\n** A Windows 95 port was made by David Harvey from the X source.\n** Ports have been made for the x64 version of Windows, along with the Dec Alpha & MIPS versions of Windows NT.\n** A BeOS version was written from scratch by Greg Weston (later author of the Mac OS X app), as a demonstration of Be's \"replicants\" technology.
