Separatism includes autonomism and secessionism.\nCriteria\nWhat is and is not considered an autonomist or secessionist movement is sometimes contentious. Entries on this list must meet three criteria:\n# They are no longer an active movement with active members.\n# They are demanded greater autonomy or self-determination for a geographic region (as opposed to personal autonomy).\n# They were citizens/people of the conflict area and did not come from another country.\nUnder each region listed is one or more of the following:\n* De facto state (de facto entity): for unrecognized regions with de facto autonomy.\n* Proposed state: proposed name for a seceding sovereign state.\n* Proposed autonomous area: for movements towards greater autonomy for an area but not outright secession.\n** De facto autonomous government: for governments with de facto autonomous control over a region.\n** Government-in-exile: for a government based outside of the region in question, with or without control.\n** Political party (or parties): for political parties involved in a political system to push for autonomy or secession.\n** Militant organisation(s): for armed organisations.\n** Advocacy group(s): for non-belligerent, non-politically participatory entities.\n** Ethnic/ethno-religious/racial/regional/religious group(s).\nList\nAlgeria\n(To Gain independence from Algeria on July 5, 1962)\n* Political party: Mouvement D'Auto-Détermination De la Kabylie (MAK)\n* Rebel organization: Front de Libération Nationale is calling for its dissolution.
