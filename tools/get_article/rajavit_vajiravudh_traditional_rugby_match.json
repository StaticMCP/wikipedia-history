It is held to strengthen the unity of teachers and students, and to encourage esprit de corp and the unity between members of both institutions. The income from the competition is donated to charity.\nThe two teams have competed 25 times; King’s College won 16 times, Vajiravudh College won seven times, and there were two draws.\nHistory\nIn the reign of King Rama VI, there was an annual sports event, held in front of the palace, between schools in the department of the chamberlain (schools under the patronage). On the day of the event, all teachers and students under the patronage had an audience with the king at Mahadlekluang School (the current Vajiravudh College).\nIn reign of King Rama VII, a period of financial crisis required a decrease in the royal court's expenses. King’s College and Mahadlekluang School were combined under the name Vajiravudh College on April 16, 1926, to be a royal memorial to His Majesty the King Rama VI. King Rama IX re-established King’s College and accepted it under royal patronage, and organized the first traditional rugby match (Royal Trophy) on November 11, 1983.\nResult of the match\nKing's College won 16 titles, Vajiravudh College won seven titles and drew two times.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
