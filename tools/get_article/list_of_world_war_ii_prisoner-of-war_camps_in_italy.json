      "text": "# List of World War II prisoner-of-war camps in Italy\n\nFermo\nThere were a number of Axis prisoner-of-war camps in Italy during World War II. The initials \"P.G.\" denote Prigione di Guerra (Prison of War), often interchanged with the title Campo (field or military camp). The Italian Armistice, declared on 8 September 1943, ended the Italian administration of the camps, many of which in the Italian Social Republic of northern and central Italy were resecured by the Germans and used to hold new prisoners and recaptured escapees.\nList of POW camps\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:97%;\"\n! width=\"100\" | Camp\n!Location\n!Notes\n|-\n! colspan=3 | German\n|-\n|Dulag 226\n|Pissignano, Campello sul Clitunno\n|Originally designated \"C.C. 77\" and then P.G. 77 by the Italian Army.

However, for 24 hours, obeying an order of the War Office, the British POW senior officer refused to allow prisoners to attempt an escape. Three days later, J. E. S. Tooes, a Royal Navy submariner, was able to escape when on an outside work detail. Claimed to be the only Gavi fort prisoner ever to escape in 800 years, he crossed into Switzerland in four days.

Richard O'Connor, Lt-Gen. Philip Neame, and New Zealand Brigadiers Reginald Miles and James Hargest. There were several escape attempts—one successful with six officers through a tunnel, four being caught soon after. Brig. Miles and Hargest escaped to Switzerland, but only Hargest eventually escaped to England via Spain. After the Italian Armistice in September 1943, 11 officers and 14 other ranks escaped with Italian partisan and SOE help. Most officers made the Allied lines, whilst many NCOs and other ranks were rounded up by the Germans and consigned to camps in Germany until the end of the war.\n|-\n|P.G. 17\n|Rezzanello\n| Near Piacenza\n|-\n|P.G. 19\n|Bologna\n|\n|-\n|P.G. 21\n|Chieti\n|An old convent used as a camp for about 1300 officers. After the Armistice, anybody wishing to leave the camp was forcibly prevented from doing so by the orders of the Senior British Officer who was following to the letter the orders of Allied HQ to remain in the camp and await the arrival of Allied forces. Consequently, the Germans were able to capture them all. They were subsequently transferred to P.G. 78 [Sulmona] and thence to camps in Germany where they remained until the end of the war.\n|-\n|P.G. 23\n|Vestone near Brescia\n|\n|-\n|P.G. 26\n|Cortemaggiore\n|Piacenza\n|-\n|P.G. 27\n|San Romano\n|Pisa\n|-\n|P.G. 29\n| Veano\n| Piacenza\n|-\n|P.G. 32\n|Bogliaco Garda lake near Salò, Brescia\n|\n|-\n|P.G. 35\n|Certosa di Padula\n|Monastery, near Salerno\n|-\n|P.G. 38\n|Poppi\n|Monastery near Arezzo, Tuscany [http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-1Epi-t1-g1-t9.html Photograph of New Zealand officers]\n|-\n|P.G. 41\n|Montalbo\n|Hilltop 15th Century castle near Piacenza.

They were recaptured after 10 days in Como near the Swiss Border.  After the armistice all 600 men, including Eric Newby and Richard Carver, marched out with the connivance of the Italian commandant and guards an hour before the Germans arrived, thanks to the decision by the Commandant, Colonel Eugenio Vicedomini, to open the gates the day after the Armistice of 8 September 1943.\n|-\n|P.G. 50\n|Caserna Genova Cavalleria - storage centre\n|Rome\n|-\n|P.G. 51\n|Altamura Villa Serena\n|45&nbsp;km from Bari - Transit camp\n|-\n|P.G. 52\n|Pian de Coreglia, near Chiavari\n|About  inland from Chiavari, on the northern edge of a town called Calvari on the banks of the Lavagna River, near Pian de Coreglia.

A large camp, established July or October 1942 – up to 10,000 prisoners, on the site of a disused linen factory at Casette Verdini, to the south west of the settlement of Sforzacosta. Postal mark 3300. The camp was located about  from the railway station near Urbisaglia, today called Urbisaglia Sforzacosta. Fairly modern concrete buildings: two tall storage buildings housed about 2,000 men per floor, and a couple of smaller buildings in the middle. However the camp had poor sanitation facilities: just 12 toilets and 3 taps. Commanded by a \"Blackshirt\" Colonel who had made the \"March on Rome\" with Mussolini, and who had under his command a number of elderly officers, sentries, dogs, Carabinieri, and two interpreters. A mountainous area, cold in winter.\n|-\n|P.G. 54\n|Passo Corese, Fara in Sabina\n| from Rome. 4,000 lower-ranked British, South African and Ghurka prisoners, mostly from the surrender of Tobruk, were held in two compounds of tents, with very poor conditions and food shortages. Many prisoners escaped into the Apennine Mountains when guards deserted as the Italian Armistice was announced on 8 September 1943. It was reorganised by the Germans, became a transit camp and was completely evacuated in January 1944 ahead of the Allied advance. The 1,100 British, South African and American prisoners of war were put on a train to be taken to a camp in Germany. On 28 January 1944, they were crossing the Orvieto Railroad Bridge North in Allerona, Umbria, when the American 320th Bombardment Group arrived to bomb the bridge. Unaware that there were Allied prisoners on the train, they dropped their bombs on their targets. The Germans left the prisoners locked in the boxcars and fled. Approximately half the men were killed by the bombs, or when the cars ultimately tumbled into the river below.\n|-\n|P.G. 55\n|Busseto\n|Near Piacenza. 4 satellite labour camps.\n|-\n|P.G. 57\n|Grupignano\n|Near Udine, at Cividale del Friuli.

Held about 4,000 mainly black African prisoners in September 1942. Conditions were reported to be very bad in this camp from late 1941-late 1942. Overcrowded tents, swampy land, mosquitoes, dysentery, heat, no Red Cross Parcels, meagre water supply. Many prisoners were moved to other camps before winter set in. The camp housed more than 3,000 British and Commonwealth prisoners of war over the period of its existence. Two days after the Italian Armistice on 8 September 1943, a German military column from the Tassignano airfield arrived at the camp and demanded that it be handed over. Camp Commander Col Vincenzo Cione, explaining that he had received no such orders, refused to do so, whereupon German soldiers opened fire, killing the Colonel, his second-in-command Captain Massimo Felice and a camp guard named Domenico Mastrippolito.  In the confusion that followed this atrocity prisoners fled en masse.  Local people who had suffered wartime deprivation then looted the camp. The camp was re-established with wooden huts before the end of 1943. In the early part of 1944 it was used as a detention centre for anti-fascists, civilian prisoners, Jews and foreign enemies, then later abandoned.\n|-\n|P.G. 62\n|Grumello del Piano\n|Near Bergamo.

At first, it was a linen factory and after it was converted into a prison camp for troops. At the end of World War II, it became a camp for Dalmatian and Istrian refugees.\n|-\n|P.G. 71\n|Aversa\n|Near Naples\n|-\n|P.G. 73\n|Fossoli di Carpi\n|Near Modena\n|-\n|P.G. 75\n|Torre Tresca, Bari\n|Transit camp.

In December a further 476 Albanian civilian prisoners swelled camp numbers to about 800. Prisoners were accommodated in military tents and suffered from disease and harsh conditions throughout the winter of 1942. After the Armistice [8 September 1943] the camp fell under German command and became a transit camp Dulag 226. It was abandoned on 8 February 1944.\n|-\n|P.G. 78\n|Sulmona\n|Camp 78 at Sulmona served as a POW camp in both world wars. During World War I, it housed Austrian prisoners captured in the Isonzo and Trentino campaigns; during World War II, it contained as many as 3,000 British and Commonwealth officers and other ranks captured in North Africa. This camp remained intact . In September 1943, as the Italian government neared collapse, the inmates of Sulmona heard rumours that the evacuation of the camp was imminent. They awoke one morning to discover that their guards had deserted. On 14 September, German troops arrived to escort the prisoners northwards, to captivity in Germany, but not before hundreds of them had escaped into the hills. One such escapee was the South African author, Uys Krige, who described his experience in a book titled The Way Out (1946). The nearby Villa Orsini was used to house senior British and Commonwealth officers including; Major-General Sir Adrian Carton de Wiart, Lieutenant General Sir Philip Neame, Air Marshal Boyd, General Sir Richard Nugent O'Connor, Brigadier Reginald Miles and Brigadier James Hargest.
