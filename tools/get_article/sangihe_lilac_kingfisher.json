It was previously considered a subspecies of the Sulawesi lilac kingfisher (C. cyanotis), but was split as a distinct species by the IUCN Red List and BirdLife International in 2014, and the International Ornithological Congress and Clements followed suit in 2022.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Sangihe Lilac Kingfisher\n\n#REDIRECT Sangihe_lilac_kingfisher\n}}"
