Taft (1889&ndash;1953) and Martha Wheaton Bowers (1889–1958), daughter of Lloyd Wheaton Bowers (1859&ndash;1910), the former solicitor general of the United States from 1909 to 1910. His three brothers were: Robert Taft Jr. (1917–1993), who was elected to the U.S. Senate; Lloyd Bowers Taft (1923–1985), who worked as an investment banker in Cincinnati, and Horace Dwight Taft (1925–1983), who became a professor of physics and dean at Yale.\nAt the time of his birth, his grandfather had just ended his presidency and had recently become the Kent Professor of Law and Legal History at Yale Law School. Taft graduated from Yale University and earned a doctorate from Princeton University.\nCareer\nAfter graduating from Princeton, Taft taught English at the University of Maryland and Haverford College. During World War II, Taft became an analyst in military intelligence. After the war ended, he went back to Yale and taught there.\nIn 1949, he went to Dublin as part of the Marshall Plan aid mission and worked for the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Department from 1951 to 1953.\nAmbassador to Ireland\nIn 1953, President Eisenhower appointed Taft U.S. ambassador to Ireland. His task as ambassador was made easier by the fact that John A. Costello (Taoiseach, 1954–57) was a personal friend; Taft described Costello as \"pleasant and unassuming\" whereas he had found Éamon de Valera \"formal and aloof\". (His predecessor, George A. Garrett, had also found Costello more sympathetic than de Valera.) Taft played a considerable part in organizing Costello's successful state visit to the United States in March 1956.\nIn 1957, Eisenhower appointed R. W. Scott McLeod as his successor to the Ambassadorship and Taft returned to the State Department as a member of its policy planning staff. He remained with State until 1960, when he became Consul General in Mozambique. He retired from the State Department's bureau for scientific, environmental and space affairs in 1977.\nPersonal life\nTaft married Barbara Bradfield, with whom he had four children:\n*John Thomas Taft\n*William Howard Taft IV (b. 1945), who married Julia Vadala (1942–2008)\n*Maria Herron Taft, who married John Clemow, son of Albert George Clemow, in 1971.\n*Martha Bowers Taft, who married Michael Golden, son of the British Michael Golden, in 1971.\nTaft was a member of the Metropolitan Club of Washington, D.C. He died of prostate cancer at his Washington home on February 23, 1991.\nSee also\n* Taft family\nReferences\n*|last=Gould|first=Lewis L.|title=Chief Executive to Chief Justice:Taft Betwixt the White House and Supreme Court|year=2014|isbn=978-0-7006-2001-2|publisher=University Press of Kansas|location=Lawrence, Kansas}}\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n*"
