It mixed Gothic and Middle East style elements, and often comes in the form of a jug with a large lip, as well as bowls. Decorative elements include animals and birds, as well as leaves and geometric patterns.\nThe Museo dell'Opera del Duomo in Orvieto held a collection of medieval examples.\nA potter from Orvieto was documented in 1211, and the town had a potters' guild in 1250.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Orvieto Ware\n\n#REDIRECT Orvieto ware"
