Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural heritage is defined as physical and biological formations, geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened flora and fauna), and sites which are important from the point of view of scientific research, conservation or natural aesthetic.\nNorth Korea, officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, ratified the convention on 21 July 1998, making its sites eligible for inclusion on the list. , North Korea has three sites on the list: the Complex of Koguryo Tombs, inscribed in 2004; Historic Monuments and Sites in Kaesong, in 2013; and Mount Kumgang – Diamond Mountain from the Sea, in 2025. In addition, the North Korean government has put four sites on its tentative list in 25 May 2000, meaning they intend to nominate them as World Heritage Sites sometime in the future. In February 2023, a proposal to update the list was approved.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:180px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" |\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Complex of Koguryo Tombs\n|\n|Pyongyang and Nampo\n| 1091; i, ii, iii, iv (cultural)\n| align=\"center\" | 2004\n|This is a complex of 30 tombs which dates back between the 3rd century BC to 7th century AD, during the final period of the Goguryeo kingdom; it was theorized these tombs were for kings, Go dynasty members, and aristocrates.
