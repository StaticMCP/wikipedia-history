      "text": "# Timeline of the 1991 Atlantic hurricane season\n\nThe 1991 Atlantic hurricane season was a below-average Atlantic hurricane season that produced twelve tropical cyclones, of which eight strengthened to become named tropical storms; four of these became hurricanes, of which two further intensified into major hurricanes (Category&nbsp;3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson scale).|group=\"nb\"}} The season officially began on June&nbsp;1, 1991, and ended on November&nbsp;30. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most subtropical or tropical cyclogenesis occurs in the Atlantic Ocean. The first system, Tropical Storm Ana, developed on July&nbsp;2 while the last system, the unnamed Perfect Storm, dissipated on November&nbsp;2.\nThe most destructive storm of the season was Hurricane Bob, which brushed the Outer Banks of North Carolina near peak intensity on August&nbsp;19, then made landfall twice in Rhode Island later that day. Bob killed at least seventeen people along its path and caused extensive damage in New England, totaling $1.5 billion (1991&nbsp;USD); this made it one of the ten costliest hurricanes on record for the United States at the time. The season's other significant storm was a powerful nor'easter known as the Perfect Storm. It began as an extratropical cyclone off the coast of eastern Nova Scotia late on October&nbsp;28, being steered southward and then westward by a ridge to its north. Late the following day, the system absorbed Hurricane Grace to its south, contributing to substantial intensification. Its strength and large size created an enormous area of high seas over the western Atlantic Ocean during late October and early November. It caused severe coastal damage in the northeastern United States, with impacts noted as far south as Puerto Rico. Damages exceeded $200&nbsp;million (1991&nbsp;USD) and thirteen people were killed. Six of the fatalities occurred when the Andrea Gail and her crew were lost amidst the treacherous conditions; the events surrounding her sinking inspired Sebastian Junger's 1997 book The Perfect Storm, which was adapted into a 2000 film of the same name. As the cyclone executed a counter-clockwise loop south of New England, it gradually acquired tropical characteristics, becoming a minimal hurricane on November&nbsp;1, and after weakening into a tropical storm, made landfall in Nova Scotia the next&nbsp;day.\nThis timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. It includes information that was not released throughout the season, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not initially warned upon, has been included.\nBy convention, meteorologists use one time zone when issuing forecasts and making observations: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and also use the 24-hour clock (where 00:00 = midnight&nbsp;UTC). The National Hurricane Center uses both UTC&nbsp;and the time zone where the center of the tropical cyclone is currently located. The time zones utilized (east to west) prior to 2020 were: Atlantic, Eastern, and Central. In this timeline, all information is listed by UTC first, with the respective regional time zone included in parentheses. Additionally, figures for maximum sustained winds and position estimates are rounded to the nearest five&nbsp;units (knots, miles, or kilometers) and averaged over one&nbsp;minute, following National Hurricane Center practice. Direct wind observations are rounded to the nearest whole number. Atmospheric pressures are listed to the nearest millibar and nearest hundredth of an inch of mercury.\nTimeline\nJune\nJune 1\n* The 1991 Atlantic hurricane season officially begins.\n* No storms formed in June.\nJuly\nJuly 2\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;pm EDT) at Tropical Depression One develops from a low pressure area centered about 100&nbsp;mi (155&nbsp;km) south of Charleston, South Carolina.\nJuly 4\n*00:00&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT, July&nbsp;3) at Tropical Depression One strengthens into Tropical Storm Ana.\n*06:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;a.m. EDT) at Tropical Storm Ana reaches peak winds of 50&nbsp;mph (85&nbsp;km/h).\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT) at Tropical Storm Ana reaches a minimum barometric pressure of .\nJuly 5\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;p.m. AST)Tropical Storm Ana becomes extratropical over the north-central Atlantic Ocean.\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (1:00&nbsp;p.m. CDT) at Tropical Depression Two forms over the western Gulf of Mexico.\nJuly 6\n*12:00&nbsp;UTC (7:00&nbsp;a.m. CDT) at Tropical Depression Two reaches peak winds of 35&nbsp;mph (55&nbsp;km/h).\n*22:00&nbsp;UTC (5:00&nbsp;p.m. CDT) at Tropical Depression Two makes landfall near La Pesca, Mexico with winds of 35&nbsp;mph (55&nbsp;km/h) and a barometric pressure of .\nJuly 7\n*02:30&nbsp;UTC (9:30&nbsp;p.m. CDT, July&nbsp;6) at Tropical Depression Two dissipates about 35&nbsp;mi (55&nbsp;km) west of La Pesca.\nAugust\nAugust 16\n*00:00&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT, August&nbsp;15) at The third tropical depression of the season forms from an area of low pressure about 200&nbsp;mi (325&nbsp;km) east of the Bahamian capital of Nassau.\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT) at The tropical depression strengthens into Tropical Storm Bob about 140&nbsp;mi (220&nbsp;km) northeast of Nassau.\nAugust 17\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT) at Tropical Storm Bob strengthens into a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane about 235&nbsp;mi (380&nbsp;km) east of Daytona Beach, Florida.\nAugust 18\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT) at Hurricane Bob strengthens to Category&nbsp;2 intensity about 265&nbsp;mi (425&nbsp;km) south of Norfolk, Virginia.\nAugust 19\n*06:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;a.m. EDT) at Hurricane Bob strengthens to Category&nbsp;3 intensity about 105&nbsp;mi (165&nbsp;km) east-southeast of Norfolk, Virginia, making it the first major hurricane of the season.
