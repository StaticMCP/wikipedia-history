The award was first awarded in 1954 to Winston Churchill, on the semicentennial anniversary of Theodore Herzl's death.\nBackground\nHerzl was the father of political Zionism. Even though he died at the young age of 44, of which only 9 were dedicated to the Zionist cause, he was able to mobilize the forces and create the infrastructure that would revolutionize the Jewish world and bring about the realization of the Jewish people's age-old dream of returning to Zion.\nAward requirements\nAccording to the site of the WZO, candidates are nominated by Zionist Federations around the world for achievement in one or more of several fields:\n* Encouraging aliyah\n* Promoting Zionist education (formal or informal)\n* Fostering the study of Hebrew\n* Advocating on behalf of Israel\n* Furthering the development of Israel as an exemplary society\n* Contributing to the advancement of Zionist thought\n* Organizing on behalf of the Zionist movement\nNominees must be no older than 44, Herzl's age at the time of his death.\nRecipients\nAll Herzl Award recipients receive a distinctive certificate and an engraved cast bronze trophy, as well as being inscribed in a special Herzl album in Jerusalem.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year!!Recipients\n|-\n|rowspan=\"13\"|2004\n| Susana Edith Gelber\n|-\n| Ron Weiser\n|-\n| Francis Weitz\n|-\n| Simon Boysen\n|-\n| Attila Novak\n|-\n| Raphael (Ralphy) Ezekiel Jhirad\n|-\n| Marcos Metta Cohen\n|-\n| Meny Samra Cohen\n|-\n| Errol Anstey\n|-\n| David Borowich\n|-\n| Elana Yael Heideman\n|-\n| Brian Sacks\n|-\n| Moises Salinas\n|-\n|rowspan=\"11\"|2005\n| Damian Szvalb\n|-\n| Gabriel Martell\n|-\n| Dalia Melchior\n|-\n| Enrique Olsoff\n|-\n| Evgeny Maryanchik\n|-\n| Avrom Krengel\n|-\n| David Collins\n|-\n| Steven Elstein\n|-\n| Jonathan Hantman\n|-\n| Gerardo Stuczynski\n|-\n| Elías Farache\n|-\n|rowspan=\"7\"|2006\n| Andrea Uzan\n|-\n| Stanislav Skibinski\n|-\n| Nathan Feldman\n|-\n| Moises Mitrani\n|-\n| Phil Koningham\n|-\n| Ted Ekeroth\n|-\n| Stephen Rosenthal\n|-\n|rowspan=\"8\"|2007\n| Andrés Abramovicz\n|-\n| Marisol Garriga\n|-\n| Jacobo Adat\n|-\n| Tamar Lazarus\n|-\n| Dmitri Vasserman\n|-\n| Daniel Berke\n|-\n| Shanee Fischer\n|-\n| Alberto Moryusef\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|2008\n| Fabio Kornblaum\n|-\n| Daniel Lew\n|-\n| Charlotte Thalmay\n|-\n| Mauricio Faradji\n|-\n| Laura Taragan\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|2009\n| Laurence (Doron) Perez\n|-\n| Torbjorn Karfunkel\n|-\n| Deborah Isaac\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2010\n| Arieh Grossman\n|-\n| Jonathan Sacerdoti\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|2015\n| Benjamin Laniado\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2016\n| Rowan Polovin\n|-\n| Enrique Chmelnik\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|2019\n| Rebeca Mischne\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|2022\n}}\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110531042617/http://www.jewishledger.com/articles/2005/12/29/news/on_the_cover/news01.txt \"Jewish Ledger\"]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061120154011/http://www.jewishagency.org/JewishAgency/English/Home/Jewish+Agency+Resources/JAFI+WZO+Related+Sites/WZO/HERZL/Herzl+Award+Recipients.htm \"Jewish Agency\"]"
