It also offers Weekly, Monthly and Yearly tickets (photocard or smart Key Card required, previous purchases required for Monthly and above). However TVM Lites only accept card payments and therefore Passengers with cash will need to pay on the train with the Conductor or as soon as possible at the next available staffed ticket office\nNew train information displays with announcements have been installed on each platform replacing the old display on platform 1 which used to show trains in both directions. There are also signals at either end of each platform so if there was a problem with one of the platforms, trains could use the other for services in either direction.\nServices\nAll services at Queenborough are operated by Southeastern using  EMUs.\nThe typical off-peak service is one train per hour in each direction between  and , from where connections are available to , London St Pancras International,  and .

The line was worked from the outset by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway which absorbed the S&SR in 1876.\nOn 15 May 1876, Queenborough became a junction station with the opening of a short spur to  to serve steam ship services. A second line was added on 1 August 1901 with the opening of the Sheppey Light Railway, an  light railway across the Isle of Sheppey to . There was no direct connection with the Sheerness Line and trains for Leysdown departed from the outer face of a newly constructed island platform at Queenborough. An iron footbridge was erected at the southern end of the platforms to facilitate passengers changing between main line and branch services. Services on the Sheppey Light Railway ceased as of 4 December 1950.\nUntil the opening of Swale Halt in 1922, Queenborough was the only intermediate station on the Sheerness Line. The imposing two-storey station building has a strong Victorian character with its high-pitched gables and round-headed sash windows. The building is in a similar style to Lymington Town railway station which dates from the same period, a resemblance which may be explained by the fact that the construction of both the Lymington branch line and the S&SR was overseen by John Cass Birkinshaw who was replaced as engineer on the S&SR after the company's directors blamed him for the line's slow construction.\nA wooden waiting shelter was provided on the Upside but not on the Downside. The station also had a sizeable goods shed and goods yard on the Up side adjacent to the main station building. Sidings on the Down side served Sheerness Steelworks and provided connections for MCD car traffic and shipbreaking activities. There was a signal box on the Up side which was located at the point where the Sheppey branch curved away to the east; this closed on 24 May 1959. By this time, the goods shed had already been demolished although the goods yard remained open until 16 August 1971. The line through Queenborough was electrified and the platforms were lengthened in 1959 as part of phase I of the Kent Coast Electrification.\nBy 1993, much of the station building was no longer in use and only the booking office was staffed on weekdays until mid-morning.\nReferences\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links"
