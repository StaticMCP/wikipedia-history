The expedition ended in fiasco for the Byzantine army.\nIn 949, the Byzantine emperor, Constantine VII, planned a new campaign to reconquer Crete. Aware of the costly failure of 911 campaign, Constantine planned a minor, cheaper, and more cautious campaign. He deployed fleets to keep an eye over the Aegean and Mediterranean, reaching to Spain and north Africa. With so many ships on guard duty.\nIn Summer 949, the Byzantine dispatched a fleet of 60 ships consisting of 10,000 marines and 5,700 soldiers and mercenaries. Other source state that the Byzantines had only 4,100 men for the campaign. The expedition was led by the eunuch, Constantine Gongyles. The Byzantine landed on the island without opposition on August 949.\nGongyles failed to fortify his camp or scout the Arabs, which left him exposed. The Arabs launched a surprise counterattack, killing many of the soldiers and capturing the rest along their camp. Gongyles and a small part of his fleet managed to escape this disaster. The failure of the expedition was largely due to Gongyles incompetence.\nReferences\nSources\n*Warren T.
