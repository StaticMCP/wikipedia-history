At Haggard's request, the song was played at Haggard's funeral in 2016.\nMusic career\nDavis moved to Nashville in 2000 from Monticello, Arkansas, to write and perform music, but was unsatisfied with his achievements. During his time there, he joined Ray Scott's band. After the success of \"Unfair Weather Friend,\"  and disillusioned with how he felt Nashville had changed, he decided to leave Music Row and go out on his own, writing and performing himself. He befriended Cody Jinks, with whom he co-wrote \"I’m Not the Devil\", the title track of Jink's 2016 album. Since then he has written and toured regularly with Jinks, including playing Red Rocks Amphitheater with Clint Black, and appearing on Conan.\nDiscography\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Albums\n!Title\n!Album details\n!Year released\n|-\n|''Nobody's Waiting\n|Self Release\n|1998\n|-\n|15 Years in a 10 Year Town\n|Hawkville\n|2015\n|-\n|Black Cats And Crows\n|Ward Davis Music, LLC\n|2020\n|-\n|Live From An Undisclosed Location in Hays, Kansas''\n|Soundly Music\n|2022\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Singles & EPs\n!Title\n!Details\n!Year\nReleased\n|-\n|\"Don't Open That Door\"\n|Single\n|2010\n|-\n|\"Last Monday in May\"\n|Single\n|2015\n|-\n|\"West Point To Arlington\"\n|Single\n|2017\n|-\n|\"I'm Not The Devil\"\n|Single\n|2017\n|-\n|Asunder\n|EP\n|2018\n|-\n|\"Last Monday in May\"\n|Single\n|2018\n|}\nReferences"
