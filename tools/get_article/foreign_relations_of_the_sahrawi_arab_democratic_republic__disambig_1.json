The Polisario Front, the national liberation movement that administers the SADR, currently controls the area that it calls the Liberated Territories, a strip of Western Sahara territory east of the Moroccan Wall. It also administers the Sahrawi refugee camps at Tindouf, Algeria, where its headquarters are. It has conducted diplomatic relations with states and international organisations since its inception in 1976. In 1966, United Nations General Assembly Resolution 22/29 affirmed for the first time the Sahrawi right to self-determination. In 1979, United Nations General Assembly Resolution 34/37 reaffirmed the right of the Western Sahara people to self-determination and independence, recognising also the Polisario Front as the representative of the Western Sahara people.\nSince the country is not widely recognised, the government has asked Independent Diplomat to serve its interests.\nRecognition\n. Of these,  have \"frozen\" or \"withdrawn\" recognition for a number of reasons. Several states that do not recognise the Sahrawi Republic nonetheless recognize the Polisario Front as the legitimate representative of the population of the Western Sahara, but not as the government-in-exile for a sovereign state.\nThe republic has been a full member of the African Union (AU), formerly the Organization of African Unity (OAU), since 1984.  Morocco withdrew from the OAU in protest and remained the only African nation not within the AU between South Africa's admittance in 1994 and (re-)joining the African Union in 2017. The SADR also participates as guest at meetings of the Non-Aligned Movement or the New Asian–African Strategic Partnership, over Moroccan objections to SADR participation. On the other hand, upholding Moroccan \"territorial integrity\" is favoured by the Arab League.\nBesides Algeria, Mexico,  Iran, Venezuela, Vietnam, Nigeria, and South Africa, India was the major middle power to have ever recognised SADR and maintained full diplomatic relations, having allowed the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic to open an embassy in New Delhi in 1985. However, India \"withdrew\" its recognition in 2000.|group=\"note\"|name=\"asotrecog group2\"}}|group=\"note\"|name=\"asotrecog group3\"}}\nCurrent diplomatic relations\nA total of 35 states presently maintain diplomatic relations with the SADR. Of these, 28 have continuously maintained relations with SADR without any interruptions. As of 6 August 2018, Botswana is the most recent nation to have formally established diplomatic relations with the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. Seven states have frozen or canceled relations with the SADR in the past, but later resumed them. As of 20 September 2022, South Sudan is the most recent nation that reestablished diplomatic relations with SADR.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! # !! State !! Relations established !!
