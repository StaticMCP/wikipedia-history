Farquharson would later give up his office in 1901 to run successfully for federal office. He was succeeded by Arthur Peters, who previously served as the province's Attorney General.\nThe opposition Conservatives, led by Daniel Gordon, lost two seats. This was Gordon's final election before stepping down as Conservative leader in 1903 - he was succeeded by John A. Mathieson\nParty standings\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Party Leader\n!colspan=\"2\"|Seats\n!colspan=\"2\"|Popular Vote\n|-\n!1898\n!Elected\n!#\n!%\n|Liberal\n|Donald Farquharson\n| align=right|19\n! align=right|22\n| align=right|16,916\n| align=right|53.5%\n|Conservative\n|Daniel Gordon\n| align=right|11\n! align=right|8\n| align=right|14,699\n| align=right|46.5%\n|-\n|}\nMembers Elected\nThe Legislature of Prince Edward Island had two levels of membership from 1893 to 1996 - Assemblymen and Councillors. This was a holdover from when the Island had a bicameral legislature, the General Assembly and the Legislative Council.\nIn 1893, the Legislative Council was abolished and had its membership merged with the Assembly, though the two titles remained separate and were elected by different electoral franchises. Assembleymen were elected by all eligible voters of within a district, while Councillors were only elected by landowners within a district.\nKings\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
