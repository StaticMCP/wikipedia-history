He was the son of Han Qiubo.\nIn 645 BC, Duke Mu of Qin invaded the Jin state at Han Jian's fief. Duke Hui of Jin asked Han Jian to scout the enemy. Han Jian reported that while the enemy had fewer men, their battle strength exceeds that of Jin. Duke Hui of Jin did not heed Han Jian's words and sent him to deliver the intent to battle. In the ensuing battle, Duke Hui of Jin and Han Jian were both captured and taken to the Qin state.\nHan Jian was succeeded by his son, Han Yu, as leader of the Han clan.\nAncestors\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Han Jian (Zhou Dynasty)\n\n#REDIRECT Han Jian (Zhou dynasty)"
