His heroic deed became a lasting symbol of courage and patriotism, boosting the morale of partisans during the Great Patriotic War.\nThe challenges the students face during their journey strengthen their friendship. Guided by their new history teacher, Yekaterina Sergeyevna, and their scout leader, Anton, the class rises to the occasion, fulfilling their promise to the crew of the trawler *Slavny* by completing the school year with excellent grades.\nCast\nIn alphabetical order\n* Aleksey Alekseev as Stepan Golovin\n* Igor Bezyayev as Nikanor Sarvanov\n* B.
