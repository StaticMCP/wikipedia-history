It starred a werewolf character named \"Warwolf\".\nStory\nThe game takes place on \"Red Earth\"—Earth's second colony planet. Dr. Faryan ventured into a cave and awoke an ancient evil force that made him turn into an evil entity. Afterwards, Dr. Faryan created an army of evil mutants who imprisoned nearly everyone on Earth. The only hope for humanity is a man named Ken, the last of a tribe of changelings who has the ability to transform into a werewolf named \"Warwolf\".\nGameplay\nGetting red \"W\"s will allow Ken to turn into a werewolf, granting him a longer-range melee attack, and a wall-climbing ability. Getting blue \"W\"s, while in werewolf form will make Ken turn back into a man. Getting bubbles will fill his anger meter and getting five of them will turn him into a super werewolf that can jump higher and do double damage for a limited time.\nReception\nGamePro Magazine gave a favourable review to the game, calling it \"challenging\" and with \"slick\" cutscenes between stages, but criticized the \"basic storyline\" and average graphics.\nMagazine VideoGames & Computer Entertainment gave a negative review, criticizing it as a short, tough, \"simple and uninspired\" game, but praised the graphics and level backgrounds. It noted to be design flaws the \"clumsy controls\", which were an inverted control scheme from the usual NES interface (\"B\" to jump and \"A\" to fire), and the need to let the timer run out after the player character loses his werewolf transformation.\nSeanbaby, in an editorial column in Electronic Gaming Monthly, listed Werewolf: The Last Warrior in his \"Worst 7s\", games that he considered to have been, in hindsight, unjustly rewarded with positive notes by previous issues of the magazine.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
