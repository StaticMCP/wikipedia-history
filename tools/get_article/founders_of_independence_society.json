The society has the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception as its Protector and Saint Rose of Lima as its Patroness. The company is an entity attached to the Ministry of Defence.\nHistory\nOnce the operations aimed at consolidating the Independence of Peru were concluded, many of the Peruvians who participated in those days were left in the greatest distress, since the fiscal coffers did not have enough money to solve their needs.\nA group of ex-combatants formed, among others, by Colonels Casimiro Negrón de la Fuente, José Domingo Espinar, Juan Basilio Cortegana and Canon Juan Sánchez achieved that on September 28, 1857, 140 heroes of independence signed in the Chapter House of the Convent of San Francisco the installation document in which the then Humane Society of the Founders of Independence () is established. The then President of the Republic, Ramon Castilla, was appointed as its president and General Juan Francisco de Vidal as its Active President.\nAfter the Peruvian victory at the Battle of Callao, President Mariano Ignacio Prado ordered that the name be extended in order to facilitate the entry of the combattants into the association.\nOnce the War of the Pacific was over, and Peruvian territory was no longer occupied, new institutions emerged with similar purposes. With the objective of unifying these institutions, by decree of November 2, 1937, all of them were incorporated into the society, adopting the name it has today.\nOn September 5, 1917, the Congress of Peru, chaired by , promulgated Law No. 2432, recognising the society as an official institution; with the right to be represented in civic ceremonies and to occupy, within protocol precedence, a place after the General Commanders of the Armed Institutes.\nAfter the negotiations with President Augusto B. Leguía, the transfer to the society of the building constructed for the residence of Andrés Avelino Cáceres in 1924 was obtained. The transfer of the property was completed by the month of December and was inaugurated on the occasion of the first centennial of the battle of Ayacucho.\nHeadquarters\nThe society currently has a headquarters located on Av. Arequipa, in the Santa Beatriz neighbourhood. The building was originally built to be the residence of Andrés Avelino Cáceres, as well as a museum—the Museo de la Breña—due to his death in 1923, however, the building was transferred to the society.\nThe institutional headquarters is the main location of the society in which solemn sessions are held annually to honour the memory of various national heroes and celebrate commemorative dates. For this purpose, the premises have a solemn session hall adorned with various paintings, busts and statues of the heroes of the history of Peru. President Augusto B. Leguía commissioned Waring & Gillow Ltd. of London to make the furniture, curtains, carpets and decorations for the Session Hall and the President's room at the company's headquarters.\nThe institutional headquarters of the society was declared Cultural heritage of Peru on February 9, 1999.\nList of presidents\nThe following is a list of associates who have served as active presidents of the institution:\n{| width=100%\n|valign=top width=50%|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=80% style=\"margin:1em auto; font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n!President || Period\n|-align=center\n|Francisco de Vidal y Laos || 1857-1861\n|-align=center\n| || 1861-1863\n|-align=center\n|José Hermenegildo Allende y Sánchez || 1863\n|-align=center\n| || 1863-1864\n|-align=center\n|José Hermenegildo Allende y Sánchez || 1864-1866\n|-align=center\n| || 1866-1868\n|-align=center\n| || 1868-1869\n|-align=center\n|Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera y Arboleda || 1869-1870\n|-align=center\n|José Hermenegildo Allende y Sánchez || 1870-1871\n|-align=center\n|Francisco Carassa y Jaramillo || 1871-1873\n|-align=center\n| || 1873-1878\n|-align=center\n|Bonifacio Franco Cueto || 1878-1879\n|-align=center\n|Manuel Villar y Olivera || 1885-1887\n|-align=center\n|Antonio Rodríguez Ramírez || 1887-1888\n|-align=center\n|Lizardo Montero Flores || 1888-1891\n|-align=center\n|Juan Buendía y Noriega || 1891-1895\n|-align=center\n| || 1895-1896\n|-align=center\n| || 1896-1898\n|-align=center\n|Miguel Coloma Saavedra || 1898-1901\n|-align=center\n|Federico Ríos || 1901-1902\n|-align=center\n| || 1902-1914\n|-align=center\n|Toribio Raygada y Oyarzábal || 1914-1916\n|-align=center\n|Francisco Román Galindo || 1916-1918\n|-align=center\n|Juan Nepomuceno Vargas Quintanilla || 1918\n|}\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=80% style=\"margin:1em auto; font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n!President || Period\n|-align=center\n|Emilio Benavides Sánchez-Carrión ||1918-1920\n|-align=center\n|Enrique C.
