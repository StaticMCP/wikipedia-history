Since the war started in Yemen in early 2015, more than 3 million people have been internally displaced and around 180,000 have fled the country. Thousands of Yemeni refugees have returned to Yemen preferring the uncertainty of the war over the camps' conditions. According to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Inter-Agency Operation update in October 2017, a total of  2,170 Yemenis remain at the Markazi Refugee Camp in Obock, Djibouti.\nReception\n| rev1score =\n| rev2 = The Independent Critic\n| rev2score = A-\n| noprose =\n| rev3 = Indie Shorts\n| rev3score =\n| rev4 = Indyred\n| rev4score =\n}}\nThe film was praised for its use of hand drawing animation, described by Richard Propes from The Independent Critic as \"The most impactful decision made by Abulohom\".
