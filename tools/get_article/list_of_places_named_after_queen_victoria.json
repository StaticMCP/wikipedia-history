As such, Victoria is one of the most commemorated individuals in place-names around the world.\nOther places that have the name \"Victoria\", without the association with Queen Victoria, tend to be derived from the Spanish language-word for 'victory', see Victoria (disambiguation).\nCommonwealth\nAustralia\nAustralian Capital Territory\n*Queen Victoria Terrace, Canberra\nNew South Wales\n*Queens
