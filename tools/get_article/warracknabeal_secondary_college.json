Later that month the department of Education approved the site on which the new high school was to be built.\nThe Ballarat Star noted the establishment of Warracknabeal High School at the beginning of 1924, and the school submitted its first annual report at the end of that year. The school websites \"History\" page states the same opening year.\nCurriculum\nYears 7–9 are based on AusVELS. Year 7 and 8 students study art, technology subjects (wood, metal, and food), media, and Japanese. Elective subjects begin in Year 9. VCE may begin in Year 10 in order to \"increase subject options for students\". However, Warracknabeal's Year 12 class may be as small as only two students. Therefore, the school supports virtual VCE classes and distance education. Students may also enter VCAL and VET programs (operated in Horsham).\nAs of 2016, on the completion of their secondary education, around 58% of students will enter the workforce. Around 35% of students will continue their education at university, while around 7% will go into TAFE programs.\nExtracurricular activities\nThe school offers private music classes for various instruments as well as sporting activities.\nHouses\nThe school has three houses.\n* Henty – the Henty Highway travels through the town\n* Wimmera – named for the Wimmera region in North-Western Victoria in which the school sits\n*  Borung – named for the Borung County\nPrincipals\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Period\n!Name\n|-\n|1924&ndash;1933\n|F.
