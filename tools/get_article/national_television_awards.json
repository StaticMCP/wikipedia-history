The National Television Awards are the most prominent ceremony for which the results are voted on by the general public and are often branded as \"television's biggest night of the year\". In addition, an equivalent awards ceremony for film, called the National Movie Awards, was held in 2007 and 2008, before being revived in 2010 but has not been held since 2011.\nHistory\nThe first National Television Awards (NTAs) ceremony was held in August 1995 and was hosted by Eamonn Holmes at Wembley Conference Centre. From 1996 onwards, it was traditionally held annually in October at the Royal Albert Hall and hosted by Sir Trevor McDonald. McDonald retired from the role after 12 years in 2008. In July 2009, after ITV decided not to broadcast it that year due to financial issues, the NTAs changed the timing of the event from October to January as part of a new deal with the broadcaster. For the 2010 ceremony, Dermot O'Leary took over as host, and the ceremony was hosted at the O2 for the first time.\nO'Leary decided to leave the programme on 13 February 2019. On 4 October 2019, in a video posted on social media, David Walliams was announced as the new NTAs host for 2020. Despite this, the ceremony remained at the O2 for the 10th successive year. The 26th ceremony was originally going to take place on 26 January but then due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was postponed to 20 April, then postponed again to 9 September.\nIn May 2021, it was announced that Joel Dommett would present the 26th ceremony, replacing Walliams. On 6 April 2022, it was confirmed that Dommett would return as host with the upcoming ceremony being held in September at a new venue, this being OVO Arena Wembley. The 2022 ceremony was subsequently delayed to 13 October as a mark of respect following the death of Elizabeth II. In 2023, it returned to the O2 with Dommett returning as host.\nThe 2024 ceremony took place on 11 September 2024.\nThe 2025 ceremony took place on 10 September 2025.\nThe 2026 ceremony will take place on 8 September 2026.\nCeremonies\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!
