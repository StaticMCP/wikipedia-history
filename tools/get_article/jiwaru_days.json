It was released in Japan by King Records on March 13, 2019, in seven versions. The single features departing member Rino Sashihara as the center performer. It debuted at number one on the Oricon Singles Chart and Billboard Japan Hot 100, with over 1.4 million units sold in Japan in its first week.\nThis single has been redone in Indonesian by JKT48 and in Thai by BNK48 as commemorative single of the group's 1st generation departure. Both versions was released in 2022.\nCommercial performance\n\"Jiwaru Days\" is the 48th AKB48 consecutive single to debut at number one, and the group's 36th consecutive single to sell in excess of a million copies. This made the band second to only B'z in terms of overall best-selling artists in Japan. Despite this, this was considered average in terms of AKB48's past sales, which was attributed to the cancellation of the group's General Election for 2019, which gives fans the opportunity to vote for their favourite singer from the group to front upcoming projects.\n| title1 = Jiwaru Days\n| note1 = ジワるDAYS\n| title2 = Watashi Datte Idol!\n| note2 = 私だってアイドル!; I Am Also an Idol!)
