He mobilized his forces and divided them into three regiments with four banners entrusted to Sa‘d bin ‘Ubada, Al-Hubab bin Mundhir, ‘Abbad bin Bishr and Sahl bin Haneef. Before the fighting, he invited the Jews to embrace Islam, an offer they ignored.\nThe first of their champions (best fighters) came out and was slain by Zubayr, the second of their champions came out and was slain also, the third was slain by Ali. In this way 11 of the Jews were killed one after another and with each one newly killed, a fresh call was extended inviting those people to profess Islam. Fighting went on ceaselessly and resulted in full surrender of the Jews. The Jews resisted for one or two days, then they surrendered on similar terms like the Jews of Khaybar and Fadak.\nAfter the surrender of the Jews at Wadi al-Qura, Muhammad established his full authority on all the Jewish tribes of Medina.\nPrimary sources\nThe event is mentioned in the Sunni hadith collection Al-Muwatta (compiled by Imam Malik, founder of the Maliki school of thought), it states:\nSee also\n* List of expeditions of Muhammad\n* Muhammad as a general\n* Military career of Muhammad\n* Battle of Khaybar\n* Muslim–Quraysh War\nNotes"
