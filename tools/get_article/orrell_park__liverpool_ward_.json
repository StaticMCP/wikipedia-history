The Orrell Park ward was created as a single-member ward from the north-western corner of the former Warbreck ward. The ward boundaries follow the Merseyrail Northern Line Ormskirk branch line, the Langton Dock Branch line, and the city boundary. The ward covers part of the Orrell Park district of Liverpool.}}\nNotes\nReferences"
