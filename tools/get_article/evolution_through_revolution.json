This was the band's first album since 1997, recorded after an eight-year hiatus. Evolution Through Revolution was released on April 14, 2009. It sold around 1000 copies in its first week, and debuted at No. 65 on the Top New Artist Albums (Heatseekers) chart.\nHistory\nBrutal Truth went on hiatus in 1998, following their tour for Sounds of the Animal Kingdom. In 2006, the band reformed to record a song for the Eyehategod tribute album For the Sick. Guitarist Gurn was later replaced by Erik Burke of Lethargy. In late 2007, Brutal Truth recorded four new original songs for This Comp Kills Fascists Vol. 1. In October 2008, the band entered the studio to record 24 songs for a new album, with work on the album being completed in January 2009. Evolution Through Revolution was released April 14, 2009. A deluxe edition was released by iTunes featuring two bonus tracks.\nReception\n| rev2 = Allmusic\n| rev2Score =\n| rev3 = Blabbermouth.net\n| rev3Score =\n| rev4 = Decibel\n| rev4Score = favorable\n}}\nEvolution Through Revolution sold around 1000 copies in its first week, and debuted at No. 65 on the Top New Artist Albums (Heatseekers) chart.\nThe album was well received by critics. Justin M. Norton of About.com called the album \"brash, experimental and multi-faceted\", and found \"Turmoil\" to be \"so fast it appears on the verge of collapsing on itself\". Greg Prato of Allmusic commented that Brutal Truth delivered \"good ol' fashioned grindcore\", complete with \"whiplash-inducing 'zero to 60' tempos, guttural growls, noise guitar [and] airtight drumming\". Ryan Ogle of Blabbermouth.net called the album \"chaotically creative\", and praised \"seemingly impossible tempo shifts\" and the \"grating, yet discernable tone and ear-bleeding servings of feedback\". He then compared the album to imagining \"a variable speed chainsaw where have the blades have been replaced with sledgehammers and then taking it on a frenzied rampage through a shopping mall.\"\nCritics also appreciated the addition of Erik Burke. Saby Reyes-Kulkarni of Nashville Scene said the addition of Burke \"helped propel Evolution Through Revolution into even more chaotic terrain than the band has explored in the past\". Norton agreed, saying, \"fresh blood certainly helped\", as did Ogle, who thought Burke \"brings a whole new brand of dementia to the band\".\n| length21       = 1:30\n| title22        = Dogs of War\n| note22         = only available on LP\n| length22       = 0:39\n}}\nPersonnel\nBrutal Truth\n*Kevin Sharp – vocals, artwork\n*Dan Lilker – bass guitar, backing vocals\n*Erik Burke – guitar\n*Rich Hoak – drums\nAdditional personnel\n*Doug White – recording (at Watchmen Studios)\n*Sanford Parker – recording (at Volume Studios)\n*Jason P.C. – mixing, mastering (at Goatsound)\n*Scott Kinkade – photography\n*Scott Hull – mastering\nReferences"
