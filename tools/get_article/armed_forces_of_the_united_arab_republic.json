After the union was announced on 22 February 1958, the Syrian Army was called the First Army, and the Egyptian Army was named the Second Army. It was dissolved after Syria withdrew from the union after a coup d'état took place on 28 September 1961. However, Egypt under Gamal Abdel Nasser continued using the designation.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.mod.gov.sy/index.php?node=554&cat=945 الجيش العربي السوري في عهد الجمهورية العربية المتحدة]"
