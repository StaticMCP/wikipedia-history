The album has received positive reviews. The album's title comes from a text message sent to a girl by lead singer Ryan Key.\nLater in the year, the band released an acoustic version of the album.\nBackground and recording\nIn July 2010, rumours surfaced that Yellowcard, who had been on a two-year hiatus, would be reforming. In August, Yellowcard announced they would be returning from their hiatus and would be working on a new album for independent label Hopeless Records. Following the band's reformation, they immediately began working on their new album. Ryan Key, who had previously been in a small project with Reeve Oliver vocalist/guitarist Sean O'Donnell (who was chosen as Pete Mosely's replacement after he declined to return) called \"Big If\", confirmed that some of Big If's songs were going to be reworked by Yellowcard and included on the new album.\nSessions for ''When You're Through Thinking, Say Yes'' were held at Sunset Sound and The Casita, both in Hollywood, California, in October and November 2010, with producer Neal Avron. He handled recording with engineer and Pro Tools operator Erich Talaba; they were assisted by Morgan Stratton at Sunset. Avron mixed the recordings at Paramount Recording Studios in Hollywood, with assistance from Nicolas Fournier. Ted Jensen mastered the album at Sterling Sound. While in the studio, they released a number of video updates.

AbsolutePunk reviewer Thomas Nassiff summarized the reunion album as \"a holistic recap of the band's career that still shows good progression\" and \"one very important thing: Yellowcard is back, and they're back for good\". Jared Ponton of Sputnikmusic, in his review giving the album 4 out of 5 stars, explained, \"The record bleeds with the best that Yellowcard have done thus far, yet in a fresh context, bursting with newfound energy after a short hiatus that, in hindsight, was certainly needed.\" Allmusic reviewer Gregory Heaney, who gave the album one of its lowest critical ratings at 3 out of 5 stars, published a more mixed review, while remarking on the band's progression away from catchy violin-driven melodies and toward music focused on the songwriting's impact.\nTrack listing\n|title11 = Sing for Me\n|note11  = acoustic\n|length11 = 3:48\n}}\nPersonnel\nPersonnel per booklet.\nYellowcard\n* Ryan Key – lead vocals, guitar\n* Sean Mackin – violin, backing vocals\n* Ryan Mendez – guitar\n* Sean O'Donnell – bass\n* Longineu W.
