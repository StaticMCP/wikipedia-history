Loudon Wainwright, writing for The New York Times, stated in a review published on October 7, 1984, \"Ten, 20, 30 years from now the best witnesses to World War II will be largely gone. But Presidents honoring them will surely have access to a copy of Studs Terkel's most recent exercise in memory harvesting, The Good War. It is hard to see how any reader now or then can fail to benefit from its 600 pages.\" Gaddis Smith, in a capsule review in the journal Foreign Affairs, claimed, \"This book sustains Studs Terkel's reputation as the nation's foremost practitioner of the difficult (although seemingly simple) art of oral history.\" Kirkus Reviews assessment of the book, dated October 11, 1984, included the following: \"In World War II memories, Terkel has found a great, untold story--with fore-shadowings of Vietnam and aftershocks of atomic warfare.\"\nIn 1985, The Good War: An Oral History of World War Two won the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction.\nSubsequent influence\nMax Brooks has said that The Good War inspired him to write his novel World War Z.  Brooks stated: \"It's an oral history of World War II I read when I was a teenager, and it's sat with me ever since. When I sat down to write World War Z, I wanted it to be in the vein of an oral history.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
