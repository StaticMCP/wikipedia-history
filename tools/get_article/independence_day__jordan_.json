The arrangement transformed the emirate into a kingdom, which became officially known as the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.\nJordan became a full member of the United Nations in December 1955.\nThe holiday, held annually on 25 May, is usually marked with official ceremonies attended by members of the House of Hashim, as well as civil and military officials. Award presentations, political speeches and diplomatic visits are commonplace on the holiday. In the Jordanian Armed Forces, Presentation of Colours ceremonies and national/unit military parades are common during the day, as well as a 21-gun salute in the capital. On the civilian level, festive events and activities including a fireworks display.\nSee also\n*Public holidays in Jordan\n*History of Jordan\n*Timeline of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan\nReferences"
