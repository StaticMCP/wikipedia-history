She is the founder and manager of Wazuri Ghana Limited, a company that produces and sells coconuts at a large scale.

She had her senior high education at Archbishop Porter Girls Secondary School in Tarkoradi, and graduated from the University of Ghana in 2016 with a bachelor's degree in Consumer Science.\nCareer\nIn her first year in tertiary school, Zuri at the age of 18 had to combine her studies with the business of selling sachet water. She later expanded her business activities to include the selling of clothes to students in her school. An encounter with a coconut seller who worked around her father's office inspired her to move into coconut selling, which she found to be lucrative. Zuri later founded Wazuri Enterprise before she turned 20. Wazuri Enterprise has so far provided employment for more than twenty Ghanaian youths.\nReferences"
