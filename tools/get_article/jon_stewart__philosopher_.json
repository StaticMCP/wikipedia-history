He received his MA in 1986 and his PhD in 1992 from the University of California, San Diego, where he studied with Robert B. Pippin, Frederick A.

It was widely reviewed in academic journals, as well as by a Danish newspaper. It is generally agreed that Kierkegaard's Relations to Hegel Reconsidered impacted research in many ways.\nIn continuing to show the relevance of culture and history to understanding the intellectual and philosophical debates of the Danish Golden Age, in 2007 Stewart published A History of Hegelianism in Golden Age Denmark, Tome I, The Heiberg Period: 1824-1836 (Copenhagen: C.A. Reitzel 2007) and A History of Hegelianism in Golden Age Denmark, Tome II, The Martensen Period: 1837-1842'' (Copenhagen: C.A. Reitzel 2007). These studies constituted the most detailed investigations into the influence of Hegel's philosophy on Danish Golden Age culture.\nBooks\n*   The Unity of Hegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit: A Systematic Interpretation, Evanston, Illinois: Northwestern University Press 2000 (Northwestern University SPEP Studies in Historical Philosophy). xv + 556pp. (re-issue, paperback, 2011.)
