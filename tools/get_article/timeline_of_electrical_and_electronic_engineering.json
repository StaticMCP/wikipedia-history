Together with the Lorentz force law, these equations form the foundation for classical electrodynamics, optics, and electric circuits.\n* 1874: Ferdinand Braun discovers the rectifier effect in metal sulfides and metal oxides.\n* 1877: Thomas Edison (1847–1931) invents the first phonograph, using a tin foil cylinder. For the first time, sounds could be recorded and played. A phonograph horn with membrane and needle was arranged so that the needle had contact with the tin foil.\n* 1880: the American physicist Charles Sumner Tainter discovers that many disadvantages of Edison's cylinders can be eliminated if the soundtrack is arranged in spiral form and engraved in a flat, round disk. Technical problems soon ended these experiments. Still, Tainter is regarded as the gramophone record inventor.\n* 1884: Paul Nipkow obtains a patent for his Nipkow disk, an image-scanning device that reads images serially, which constitutes the foundation for mechanical television. Two years later, his patent ran out.\n* 1886: Heinrich Hertz succeeds in proving the existence of electromagnetic waves for the first time – now the groundwork for wireless telegraphy and radio broadcasting in physical science is laid.\n* 1887: Unaware of Charles Sumner Tainter's experiments, German-American Emil Berliner has his phonograph patented.

Quickly it becomes obvious that flat Gramophone records are easier to duplicate and store.\n* 1888:\n** Alexander Graham Bell (1847–1922) significantly reduces interfering noises by using a wax cylinder instead of tin foil. This paved the way for commercial success for the improved phonograph.\n** American Oberlin Smith describes a process to record audio using a cotton thread with integrated fine wire clippings. This makes reel-to-reel audio tape recording possible.\n* 1890:\n** The phonograph becomes faster and more convenient due to an electric motor. The electric motor brings on the first juke box with cylinders – even before flat disk records were widely available.\n** Thomas Edison discovers thermionic emission. This effect forms the basis for the vacuum tube and the cathode ray tube.\n* approximately 1893: The selenium phototube invention allows the conversion of brightness values into electrical signals. The principle is applied in wirephoto and television technology for a short time. Selenium is used in light meters for the next 50 years.\ncamera by the Lumière brothers in 1895 (ref 86.5822) at the French Museum of Photography in Bièvres, Essonne, France]]\n* 1895: Auguste Lumiere's cinematograph displays moving images for the first time.

It was able to execute a finite but not limited set of different mechanical actions using a single communication channel, laying down modern wireless remote control operation principles.\n* 1902\n** Otto von Bronk patented his \"Method and apparatus for remote visualization of images and objects with a temporary resolution of the images in parallel rows of dots\". This patent, initially developed for phototelegraphy, impacted the development of color television, particularly the NTSC implementation.\n** For the first time, audio records are printed with paper labels in the middle.\n* 1903: Guglielmo Marconi provides evidence that wireless telegraphic communication is possible over long distances, such as across the Atlantic. He used a transmitter developed by Ferdinand Braun.\n* 1904\n** For the first time, double-sided records and those with a diameter of 30&nbsp;cm are produced, increasing playing time up to 11 minutes (5.5 minutes per side). These are created by Odeon in Berlin and debuted at the Leipzig Spring Fair.\n** The German physicist Arthur Korn developed the first practical method for telegraphy.\n* 1905: The Englishman Sir John Ambrose Fleming invents the first electron tube.\n* 1906\n** Robert von Lieben patented his \"inertia working cathode-ray-relays\". By 1910 he developed this into the first real tube amplifier, by creating a triode. His invention of the triode is almost simultaneously created by the American Lee de Forest.\n** Max Dieckmann and Gustav Glage use the Braun tube for playback of 20-line black-and-white images.\n** The first jukebox with records comes on the market.\n** American Brigadier General Henry Harrison Chase Dunwoody files for a patent for a carborundum steel detector for use in a crystal radio, an improved version of the Cat's-whisker detector. It is sometimes credited as the first semiconductor in history.  The envelope detector is an important part of every radio receiver.\n* 1907: Rosenthal puts in his image telegraph for the first time a photocell.\n* 1911: First film studios are created in Hollywood and Potsdam- Babelsberg .\n* 1912: The first radio receiver is created, in accordance with the Audion principle.\n* 1913: The legal battle over the invention of the electron tube between Robert von Lieben and Lee de Forest is decided. The electron tube is replaced by a high vacuum in the glass flask with significantly improved properties.\n** Alexander Meissner patented his process \"feedback for generating oscillations\", by his development of a radio station using an electron tube .\n** The Englishman Arthur Berry submits a patent on the manufacture of printed circuits by etched metal.\n* 1915: Carl Benedicks leads basic studies in Sweden on the electrical properties of silicon and germanium. Due to the emerging tube technology, however, interest in semiconductors remains low until after the Second World War.\n* 1917\n** Based on previous findings of the Englishman Oliver Lodge, the Frenchman Lucien Levy develops a radio receiver with frequency tuning using a resonant circuit.\n* 1919: Charlie Chaplin founds the Hollywood film production and distribution company United Artists\n* 1920: The first regularly operating radio station KDKA goes on air on 2 November 1920 in Philadelphia, USA. It is the first time electronics are used to transmit information and entertainment to the public at large. The same year in Germany an instrumental concert was broadcast on the radio from a long-wave transmitter in Wusterhausen.\n* 1922: J. McWilliams Stone invents the first portable radio receiver. George Frost builds the first \"car radio\" in his Ford Model T.\n* 1923\n** The 15-year-old Manfred von Ardenne is granted his first patent for an electron tube having a plurality of electrodes.

By dense grooves (16 grooves on 1&nbsp;mm) and the reduction of speed to 80 min −1 (later 78 min −1) increases the playing time up to 2 times 20 minutes. He carries himself with the decline of his phonograph business.\n** The German State Railroad offers a cordless telephone service in moving trains between Berlin and Hamburg – the idea of mobile telephony is born.\n** John Logie Baird developed the first commercial television set in the world. It was not until 1930, he is called a \" telescreen sold \"at a price of 20 pounds.\n* 1927\n** The first fully electronic music boxes (\"Jukeboxes\") used in the USA on the market.\n** German Grammophon on sale due to a license agreement with the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company.

The term \"High Fidelity\" is embossed around this time.\n* 1935\n** AEG and BASF place at the Berlin Radio Show, the tape recorder \" Magnetophon K1 \"and the appropriate magnetic tapes before. In case of fire in the exhibition hall all four exhibited devices are destroyed.\n** In Germany the world's first regular television program operating for about 250 mostly public reception points starts in Berlin and the surrounding area. The mass production of television receivers is – probably due to the high price of 2,500 Reichsmarks – not yet started.\n** At the same time, the research institute of the German Post (RPF) begins with development work for a color television methods, but which are later reinstated due to the Second World War.\n* 1936\n** Olympic Games in Berlin broadcast live.\n** \"Olympia suitcase\", battery-powered portable radio receiver, introduced.\n** The first mobile television camera (180 lines, all-electronic) is used for live television broadcasts of the Olympic Games.\n** Also in the UK are first regular television broadcasts – now for the perfect electronic EMI system, which soon replaced the mechanical part Baird system – broadcast.\n** Video telephony connections between booths in Berlin and Leipzig.

Thanks to micro-groove (100 grooves per cm) can play 23 minutes per side. The LP record is born. This one is the redemption of the claim \"high fidelity one step closer\" to the end of the shellac era.\n** The Radio Corporation of America (RCA) leads the music format with 45 RPM records, later to conquer the market for cheap players. The first publication in Germany in this format appears 1953rd\n** The British physicist Dennis Gabor (1900–1979) invents holography.  This method of recording and reproducing image with coherent light allows three-dimensional images.
