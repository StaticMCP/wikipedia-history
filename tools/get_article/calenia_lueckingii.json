      "text": "# Calenia lueckingii\n\nCalenia lueckingii is a species of foliicolous (leaf-dwelling) lichen in the family Gomphillaceae. It was formally described as a new species in 1996 by Claudia Hartmann. The type specimen was collected by the author from the edge of Braulio Carrillo National Park (Heredia Province) in Costa Rica; there it was found growing on the leaves of Ardisia in a tropical wet transition rainforest. The species epithet honours German lichenologist Robert Lücking. In 2018, the lichen was recorded from Hainan, China.\n}}"
