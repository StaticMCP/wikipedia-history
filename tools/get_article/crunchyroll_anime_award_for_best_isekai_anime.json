Originally given for best fantasy anime series, it was eventually removed or renamed starting in its ninth edition in 2025 (partially due to confusion over anime genres between fantasy and isekai). It is given for the best fantasy and isekai anime series from the previous year. Winners are determined through a combined voting process by judges and public voting.\nThe Promised Neverland by CloverWorks first won the award in 2020. Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation, Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World and That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime were the only three anime series to received nominations altogether in both categories, the latter two also were the previous respective winners of the Best Fantasy genre.\nIn the latest edition in 2025, the third season of Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World by White Fox won the award.\nWinners and nominees\nIn the following list, the first titles listed in gold are the winners; those not in gold are nominees, which are listed in alphabetical order.
