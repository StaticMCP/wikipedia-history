      "text": "# Journey to a War\n\nFirst US edition (publ. Random House)\nJourney to a War is a travel book in prose and verse by W. H. Auden and Christopher Isherwood, published in 1939.\nThe book is in three parts: a series of poems by Auden describing his and Isherwood's journey to China in 1938 ; a \"Travel-Diary\" by Isherwood (including material first drafted by Auden) about their travels in China itself, and their observations of the Sino-Japanese War; and \"In Time of War: A Sonnet Sequence with a Verse Commentary\" by Auden, with reflections on the contemporary world and their experiences in China. Some editions of the book also contain a selection of photographs by Auden.\nAuden revised many of the poems in this book for his later collections; \"In Time of War\" was renamed \"Sonnets from China\" (with many original sonnets discarded) and the verse commentary was dropped entirely.\nReferences\n* W.
