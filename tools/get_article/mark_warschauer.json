Warschauer is a professor of education and informatics at the University of California, Irvine, where is also the director of the Ph.D. in Education program and founding director of the Digital Learning Lab. He is the author or editor of eight books and more than 100 scholarly papers on topics related to technology use for language and literacy development, education, and social inclusion. Warschauer's books have been translated into Chinese, Japanese, and Portuguese and have been critically acclaimed in fields as diverse as education, media studies, cultural studies, communication, sociology, and information studies. Warschauer has been a keynote speaker at conferences in education and applied linguistics throughout the world.\nBackground\nWarschauer served as a faculty researcher and doctoral candidate at the University of Hawaiʻi, where he published several of his early books and also organized two seminal international symposia on technology and language learning. While at the University of Hawaiʻi, Warschauer also founded and edited the academic journal Language Learning & Technology, one of the first peer-reviewed academic journals published on the World Wide Web.\nFollowing Hawaii, Warschauer took a position as director of educational technology on a large language education US Aid project in Egypt.\nSince 2001, Warschauer has been a professor in the Department of Education and the Department of Informatics at the University of California, Irvine, where he also contributes to the Center for Research on Information Technology and Organizations and the Ada Byron Research Center for Diversity in Computing and Information Technology. Warschauer is the founding director of the PhD in Education program at UC Irvine, one of the few graduate programs in the U.S. that includes a specialization in language, literacy, and technology.\nMajor works\nComputer assisted language learning\nA number of Warschauer publications recognize the potential of technologies for fostering increased learning opportunities for second language learners. Warschauer's books on the topic, including Internet for English Teaching, Virtual Connections, Telecollaboration in Foreign Language Learning, and Network-Based Language Teaching, attracted the attention of second and foreign language teachers and researchers around the world.\nIn these books, Warschauer critiqued previous views of computer-assisted language learning, which often emphasized its use in teaching grammar and vocabulary, and instead he articulated a vision of global citizenship and agency through online communication and research.\nDigital literacy\nWarschauer's book Electronic Literacy: Language, Culture, and Power in Online Education focuses on the particular skills and competency involved in becoming literate in the digital age, and the impact of this digital literacy on overcoming the marginalization of culturally and linguistically diverse learners.\nWarschauer's book Technology and Social Inclusion: Rethinking the Digital Divide argued that social relations, human capital, culture and language are all critical for shaping people's access to and use of new information and communication technologies. The book was based on Warschauer's research on technology, education, and social development projects in Egypt, Brazil, China, India, and the United States.\nWarschauer's book, Laptops and Literacy: Learning in the Wireless Classroom focuses on the use of laptops in education. He analyzes how students learn to read, write, think, conduct research, and produce media in the laptop classroom. The book maintains that while laptops help good schools become better they exacerbate issues at troubled schools.\nRecognition\nWarschauer was the recipient in 1998 of the Educational Testing Service/TOEFL Policy Council Award for outstanding international contribution in the field of technology and language learning.[https://web.archive.org/web/19990221012202/http://www.toefl.org/laicawrd.html Awards Presented at TESOL] His books have been translated into Chinese, Japanese, and Portuguese and have been critically acclaimed in fields as diverse as education, media studies, cultural studies, communication, sociology, and information studies. He has been a keynote speaker at conferences in education and applied linguistics throughout the world.\nPersonal life\nWarschauer married in 1998.\nLoss of his son\nOn August 8, 2003, the body of Mark Warschauer's first son Michael was discovered in the backseat of his car in the UC Irvine parking lot. Only 10 months old, \"Mikey\" had died of heat stroke after Warschauer left him in the car. Warschauer told police he had intended to take Mikey to a day care center before going to his office, but had forgotten the boy was with him. Two months later prosecutors announced that they would not pursue criminal charges against Mark Warschauer, ruling the boy's death accidental. Following the tragic event, Warschauer became active in groups educating parents about children's safety in and around cars. He and his wife went on to have three subsequent children.\nSample publications\nAuthored and co-authored books\n*Zheng, Binbin, Warschauer, Mark. \"[https://www.newspapers.com/image/1144853323 One Laptop Per Child]\" The Bangor Daily News (25 June 2016) p.
