Smoking bans in private vehicles are less common than bans extended to public transport or vehicles used during work, like trucks or police cars.\nTraffic security\nThe acts of looking for, reaching for, and then lighting cigarettes can considerably distract a driver. A burning cigarette that has fallen into a driver's lap might lead to panic-like reactions. Cigarette stubs thrown out of a window pose a serious fire threat. Some serious traffic accidents in Germany are known to have been caused by lit cigarettes.\nSome German tribunals have commented on the imprudence of smoking while driving. Despite that, smoking while driving is legal in Germany, even when children are present. German politician Karl Lauterbach, the country's former Federal Minister of Health, supported banning smoking in vehicles when children are present, a measure supported by 87% of German car drivers, according to an opinion poll conducted by the German Cancer Research Center. In 2023, a proposed law was overturned in the German parliament on the grounds of \"excessive restrictions of civil liberties\". According to estimates of the German Cancer Research Center, around one million minors in Germany were exposed to smoking in cars as of 2022.\nProtection from secondhand smoke\nMore recently, the dangers of secondhand smoke (SHS) have seen more attention, and smoking in a car (whether in motion or not) is banned in some jurisdictions as a measure against passive smoking. SHS, also called environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), is a mixture of two forms of smoke that come from burning tobacco. Mainstream smoke is the smoke exhaled by a smoker. Sidestream smoke is smoke from the lighted end of a cigarette, pipe, or cigar, or tobacco burning in a hookah. This type of smoke has higher concentrations of cancer-causing agents (carcinogens) and is more toxic than mainstream smoke. It also has smaller particles than mainstream smoke. These smaller particles make their way into the lungs and the body’s cells more easily. When non-smokers are exposed to SHS, it is called involuntary smoking or passive smoking. Non-smokers who breathe in SHS take in nicotine and toxic chemicals the same way smokers do. The more SHS someone breathes, the higher the levels of these harmful chemicals in their body.\nSome laws stipulate that such a ban applies only when a passenger is under a certain age. A study showed that after smoking one cigarette in a car, the time required for respirable particles' concentration to return to its initial value, depending on car movement cases, windows positions and ventilation settings, varies between 10 and 60 minutes.\nWildfires\nCigarettes or cigarette litter thrown out of the window of cars moving through a vegetated area (particularly during the hot season) is one of the causes of wildfires or bushfires. A southern France firefighters' department statistic attributes 16% of local bushfires to cigarette litter thrown out of moving vehicles (and 13.8% to cigarette litter from pedestrians).\nJurisdictions with a smoking ban in private vehicles\nAustralia\nIn the Australian Capital Territory, a smoking ban in cars with minors under the age of 16 has existed since May 2012.
