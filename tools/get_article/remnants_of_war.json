It was recorded following a lineup change and a change of studio to Mad Dog Studios in California. The sound of the album was a gradual progression from the traditional heavy metal style of the band's debut album, Burning Star towards the power-thrash sound that the band forged throughout the 1980s.\nTrack listing\nAll tracks written by Helstar.\n# \"Unidos por Tristeza\" - 0:48\n# \"Remnants of War\" - 3:45\n# \"Conquests\" - 3:47\n# \"Evil Reign\" - 4:32\n# \"Destroyer\" - 5:04\n# \"Suicidal Nightmare\" - 5:20\n# \"Dark Queen\" - 4:00\n# \"Face the Wicked One\" - 5:16\n# \"Angel of Death\" - 6:18\nPersonnel\n* James Rivera - vocals\n* Larry Barragan - guitars\n* Rob Trevino - guitars\n* Jerry Abarca - bass\n* Rene Luna - drums\nReferences"
