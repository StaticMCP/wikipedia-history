Most of the buildings of the station remain including the station platform and goods sheds.\nIt is possible to cross the railway tracks on foot just east of the old station at a marked crossing.\nA little further east between the station and the river is Avondale Road, with a bridge over the train line where the train descends (when heading east) through a cutting before it crosses the Yandaran Creek via a railway bridge. From the Avondale Road bridge it is possible to get a good view of the goods trains crossing the river.\nReferences"
