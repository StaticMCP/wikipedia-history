The townsite was first requested by the Wandering Road Board in 1912, with the hope it could become a future terminus for the Hotham Valley Railway, and the townsite, initially called Dampier, was gazetted in 1914. The town however did not attract settlement. In 1940–41 a timber mill was built here by JC \"Charlie\" Tucak, and operated for some years.\nThe townsite is owned by the Horan family, though most of the buildings were destroyed by arson in the mid-1980s.\nReferences"
