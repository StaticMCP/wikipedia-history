He also studied music privately. He began as a Concert singer with the encouragement and assistance of Roland Hayes &mdash; who performed  many of Boatner's works on his concert programs&mdash;and choral director R. Nathaniel Dett.  He also sang leading roles with the National Negro Opera Company. For the National Baptist Convention, he served as the director of music from 1925 to 1931. Boatner was a professor for Samuel Huston College (now Huston–Tillotson University) and Wiley College in Marshall, TX. He then settled in New York conducting a studio and directed community and church choirs. This allowed him to concentrate more on composing.\nBoatner was the natural father of the sax player Sonny Stitt, but the boy - named Edward Boatner, Jr. - was placed for adoption early on to the Stitt family, growing up in Saginaw, Michigan.\nMusic\nNotable arrangements\n* \"Oh, What a Beautiful City\"\n* \"Let Us Break Bread Together\"\n* \"Soon I Will Be Done\"\n* \"Trampling\"\n* \"I want Jesus to walk with me\", for Marian Anderson\nNotable compositions\n* \"Freedom Suite\" for chorus, narrator, and orchestra\n* \"The Man from Nazareth\", a \"spiritual musical\"\n* \"Julius Sees Her\", a musical comedy\nReferences\n# Southern, Eileen.
