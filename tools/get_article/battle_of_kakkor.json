He despatched Gangadhar Tatya. Madho Singh dispatched an army of 4000 that was completely crushed. Tatya attacked Thakur Jodhsingh Singh, who was wounded and killed; the death of this commander was fatal as it saved Marathas who were on the verge of defeat. Gulab Singh tried to command the army, but was also killed. Lastly, Pratap Singh Naruka took the charges and fiercely went upon slaying the Marathas. Gangadhar Tatya was wounded, and had to escape from the battlefield whereas casualties of Rajput were huge, nearly 20 captains were slain. Rajputs were forced to seek peace.\nAftermath\nMalharrao Holkar later laid siege to and captured Burwada fort, forcing Rajputs again to seek peace. Malharrao wasn't able to plunder for long as he had to leave Rajputana to help Dattaji. He arrived too late as Dattaji had already fallen in the Battle of Barari Ghat .\nReferences"
