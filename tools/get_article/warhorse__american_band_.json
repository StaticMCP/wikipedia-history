They officially disbanded in 2005 after releasing the single \"I Am Dying\".\nIn 2019, after the passing of former guitarist Todd Laskowski, WarHorse reemerged for what was planned as a one-off tribute set at Maryland Doom Fest. The band was then offered a spot at Psycho Las Vegas, which led to a handful of additional shows before the pandemic shut down the live music world. Not to be discouraged, WarHorse returned in September 2021 to play the Decibel Magazine Metal & Beer Fest.\nMembers\n* Jerry Orne - bass, vocals (1996-current)\n* Mike Hubbard - drums (1996-current)\n* Terry Savastano - guitar (1998-current)\n* Krista Van Guilder - vocals, guitar (1996–1998)\n* Matt Smith - vocals, guitar (1998–1999)\n* Todd Laskowski - guitar (1998)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n!
