The first installment of the awards were held for Bengali, Assamese and Odia films in a ceremony on 29 March 2014.\nThe award was discontinued in 2015 and 2016 due to the unequal representation and award distribution among the three film industries. The ceremony was re-started from 2017 but awards were given only to the Bengali films. 2021 onwards, it was rebranded as the Filmfare Awards Bangla and awards are being presented only to the Bengali film industry.\nHistory\nOn 8 March 2014, in a press conference held at Kolkata, the Worldwide Media group announced that Filmfare Award is debuting in Eastern India to honour the best cinematic artistic talent of the region. In the inaugural installment, awards in 29 categories would be given away at the Science City auditorium, Kolkata on 29 March 2014. The awards would include 21 trophies for Bengali movies and four each for Odia and Assamese films. The four categories for both Odia and Assamese films are Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Actress.\nThe winners would be selected from 102 entries in Bengali films, 36 and 14 entries respectively from the Odia and Assamese films.\nBengali film actor Prosenjit Chatterjee was present as the chief guest in that occasion. Thereafter two other press conferences followed in Bhubaneswar on 11 March and Guwahati on 14 March 2014 in the presence of Odia film actor Anubhav Mohanty and Assamese film actors Kopil Bora and Zerifa Wahid respectively.\nThe award was discontinued in 2015 and 2016 due to the unequal representation and award distribution among the three film industries. The ceremony was re-started from 2017 but awards were given only to the Bengali films for 2 years - 2017 and 2018. The ceremony was cancelled in 2019 and 2020 due to the then ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 2021 onwards, it was rebranded as the Filmfare Awards Bangla and awards are being presented only to the Bengali film industry.\nCeremonies\n*1st Filmfare Awards East - 2014\n*2nd Filmfare Awards East - 2017 (only Bengali films were awarded)\n*3rd Filmfare Awards East - 2018 (only Bengali films were awarded)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
