He became the first Pro Stock driver to make a sub-6.9-second pass with a 6.894-second run at Richmond, Va. In 2006, Johnson reached his 500th career race.\nOn May 2, 2010, at age 66, Warren became the oldest professional winner in NHRA history, as he won the AAA Midwest Nationals in Madison Illinois.\nJohnson was a member of the Kiz Toys’ Board of Advisors.

The company is now defunct, and rebranded as Kiz Studios, an independent video game and entertainment studio, with offices in Atlanta, Ga. and Charleston, S.C. As of May 2010, he won the National Hot Rod Association's Pro Stock championship in six seasons and 97 NHRA national events. Johnson is also a two time IHRA champion in the Mountain Motor Pro Stock division.\nAwards\n*In 2001, a panel ranked him seventh in the National Hot Rod Association Top 50 Drivers, 1951–2000.\n*He was inducted in the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 2007.\n*In 2015, he was inducted in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.kiztoys.com/kiztoys/about_us/board_of_advisors.cfm?content_id=125 Kiz Toys Board of Advisors]"
