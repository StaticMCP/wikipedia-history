The 21st Century Leaders programme was launched by Trade plus Aid, British Charity Registration 1061376. Trade plus Aid is an ethical trading organisation established in order to create environmentally sound and economically viable means to alleviate poverty in impoverished communities, initially in Africa.\nThe organisation now runs an international campaign entitled Whatever It Takes which, through the sale of ethically traded goods featuring the original artwork of celebrities, seeks to raise money and awareness for organizations working in education, climate change, poverty reduction and health primarily in Africa. In South Africa the organization works on a biogas digester programme to promote environmentally sustainable lifestyles in rural areas.\nThe organisation founded the 21st Century Leaders Awards, an award designed to highlight the work of leaders of popular culture who have sought to use their celebrity to encourage social change.\nMission\n21st Century Leaders mission is to assist and encourage royalty, Nobel Peace Prize laureates, and celebrities from the fields of film, music, fashion, art, sport and literature etc. - to raise awareness and funds for environmental and sustainable human development solutions.\nWhatever It Takes to Make a Difference Campaign\nThe campaign started in December 2002 and requests that celebrity leaders design and donate a symbol of hope for the 21st century, as well as a stick figure self-portrait and a message of hope. Over 740 celebrities' artworks are reproduced on socially and environmentally responsible products  sold internationally to support alleviation of poverty, environmental conservation, and the protection of children.\nTrade plus Aid South Africa\nTrade plus Aid has been working in South Africa for over 18 years, administering various community development, and social outreach programs.  The projects are focused on social and economic upliftment and infrastructure development of impoverished rural communities especially those surrounding the damaging long-term consequences of climate change.\nThe biogas digester program is an effort to motivate an introduction of appropriate and sustainable energy generation for the agricultural sector as well as promoting a holistic approach to nutrient balancing and soil management. The organisation reinvests funds from the commercial biogas digester programme into the installation of family size rural household digesters to replace the need for the gathering of wood fuel for meal preparation and heating.\n2009 Outstanding Humanitarians Awardees\nThe first award ceremony was held on October 30, 2009 in Doha, Qatar and awarded British actor Sir Ben Kingsley CBE, American actor Josh Hartnett, director and producer Danny Boyle & Christian Colson, tennis champions Serena & Venus Williams, and opera singer Monica Yunus.\nSir Ben Kingsley CBE was awarded for his continued aid of disadvantaged young people and children and for his portrayal of the humanitarian role-models Simon Wiesenthal, Itzhak Stern and Gandhi.\nDanny Boyle & Christian Colson, director & producer of the film Slumdog Millionaire, were awarded for their creation of an international children’s development organization focused on education and sanitation, and designed to improve the lives of children in Mumbai’s slum communities and for the Jai Ho Trust, an independent trust which aims to ensure that Rubina Ali (who played the youngest Latika in the film) and Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail (youngest Salim) receive an education, housing and social support.
