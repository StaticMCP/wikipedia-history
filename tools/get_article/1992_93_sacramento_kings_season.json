The Kings received the seventh overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft, and selected small forward Walt Williams from the University of Maryland, and signed free agents Rod Higgins and Kurt Rambis during the first month of the regular season.\nUnder new head coach Garry St. Jean, the Kings got off to a fast start by winning their first three games of the regular season, but later posted a 7-game losing streak in December leading to a 6–16 start. The Kings would then post a 6-game winning streak between December and January, but continued to struggle losing 21 of their next 26 games, holding a 17–34 record at the All-Star break, as they were plagued with injuries; Mitch Richmond only played just 45 games due to a broken right thumb, and was out for the remainder of the season, and Williams only played 59 games due to a hand injury. The Kings lost 16 of their final 21 games of the season, and finished in last place in the Pacific Division with a 25–57 record, missing the NBA playoffs for the seventh consecutive year.\nRichmond led the team in scoring averaging 21.9 points per game, while Lionel Simmons averaged 17.9 points, 7.2 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 1.4 steals per game, and Williams provided the team with 17.0 points and 4.5 rebounds per game, and was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team. In addition, Wayman Tisdale averaged 16.6 points and 6.6 rebounds per game, while Spud Webb contributed 14.5 points, 7.0 assists and 1.5 steals per game, and Anthony Bonner provided with 8.6 points and 6.5 rebounds per game. Meanwhile, Higgins contributed 8.3 points per game off the bench, second-year guard Randy Brown provided with 7.6 points and 1.4 steals per game, and Duane Causwell averaged 8.2 points, 5.5 rebounds and 1.6 blocks per game.\nDuring the NBA All-Star weekend at the Delta Center in Salt Lake City, Utah, Richmond was selected for the 1993 NBA All-Star Game, as a member of the Western Conference All-Star team, but did not participate due to injury; it was his first ever All-Star selection.\nFollowing the season, Bonner signed as a free agent with the New York Knicks, while Higgins signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers during the next season, and Rambis re-signed with his former team, the Los Angeles Lakers.\nDraft picks\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\"\n! style=\"background:#1C4BA0; color:#CC2D5C\" width=\"10%\"| Round\n! style=\"background:#1C4BA0; color:#CC2D5C\" width=\"10%\"| Pick\n! style=\"background:#1C4BA0; color:#CC2D5C\" width=\"20%\"| Player\n! style=\"background:#1C4BA0; color:#CC2D5C\" width=\"15%\"| Position\n! style=\"background:#1C4BA0; color:#CC2D5C\" width=\"15%\"| Nationality\n! style=\"background:#1C4BA0; color:#CC2D5C\" width=\"20%\"| College\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| 1 || 7 || Walt Williams || SF ||  || Maryland\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| 2 || 54 || Brett Roberts || SF ||  || Morehead State\n|}\nRoster\nRegular season\nSeason standings\n:z - clinched division title\n:y - clinched division title\n:x - clinched playoff spot\nGame log\nPlayer statistics\nRegular season\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#002F6C; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#D50032 3px solid; border-bottom:#D50032 3px solid;\"|Player\n! style=\"background:#002F6C; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#D50032 3px solid; border-bottom:#D50032 3px solid;\"|GP\n! style=\"background:#002F6C; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#D50032 3px solid; border-bottom:#D50032 3px solid;\"|GS\n! style=\"background:#002F6C; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#D50032 3px solid; border-bottom:#D50032 3px solid;\"|MPG\n! style=\"background:#002F6C; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#D50032 3px solid; border-bottom:#D50032 3px solid;\"|FG%\n! style=\"background:#002F6C; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#D50032 3px solid; border-bottom:#D50032 3px solid;\"|3P%\n! style=\"background:#002F6C; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#D50032 3px solid; border-bottom:#D50032 3px solid;\"|FT%\n! style=\"background:#002F6C; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#D50032 3px solid; border-bottom:#D50032 3px solid;\"|RPG\n! style=\"background:#002F6C; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#D50032 3px solid; border-bottom:#D50032 3px solid;\"|APG\n! style=\"background:#002F6C; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#D50032 3px solid; border-bottom:#D50032 3px solid;\"|SPG\n! style=\"background:#002F6C; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#D50032 3px solid; border-bottom:#D50032 3px solid;\"|BPG\n! style=\"background:#002F6C; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#D50032 3px solid; border-bottom:#D50032 3px solid;\"|PPG\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 76 || 75 || 30.0 || .509 || .000 || .758 || 6.6 || 1.4 || .7 || .6 || 16.6\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 75 || 34 || 23.0 || .463 || .333 || .732 || 2.8 || 2.6 || 1.4 || .5 || 7.6\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 73 || 0 || 12.1 || .425 || .429 || .840 || 1.2 || 2.3 || .5 || .1 || 4.5\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 70 || 35 || 25.2 || .461 || .000 || .593 || 6.5 || 1.4 || 1.2 || .2 || 8.6\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 69 || 68 || 36.3 || .444 || .091 || .819 || 7.2 || 4.5 || 1.4 || .6 || 17.9\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 69 || 68 || 33.8 || .433 || .274 || .851 || 2.8 || 7.0 || 1.5 || .1 || 14.5\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 69 || 4 || 20.7 || .412 || .323 || .861 || 2.8 || 1.7 || .7 || .4 || 8.3\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|†\n| 67 || 1 || 11.7 || .516 || .000 || .667 || 3.3 || .8 || .6 || .3 || 2.5\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 59 || 26 || 28.4 || .435 || .319 || .742 || 4.5 || 3.0 || 1.1 || .5 || 17.0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 59 || 9 || 14.1 || .485 ||  || .696 || 3.3 || 1.1 || .4 || .4 || 6.1\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 55 || 45 || 22.0 || .545 || .000 || .624 || 5.5 || .6 || .6 || 1.6 || 8.2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 46 || 0 || 10.2 || .474 || .000 || .704 || 2.7 || .8 || .3 || .1 || 4.8\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 45 || 45 || 38.4 || .474 || .369 || .845 || 3.4 || 4.9 || 1.2 || .2 || 21.9\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|†\n| 9 || 0 || 8.4 || .471 ||  || .733 || 1.2 || .6 || .2 || .1 || 3.0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|†\n| 8 || 0 || 9.9 || .444 || .300 || .850 || 1.3 || .1 || .4 || .0 || 7.5\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 3 || 0 || 5.0 || .333 || .500 ||  || .0 || .3 || .3 || .0 || 1.7\n|}\nPlayer Statistics Citation:\nAwards and records\n* Walt Williams, NBA All-Rookie Team 2nd Team\nTransactions\nReferences\nSee also\n* 1992-93 NBA season"
