It was named by Carl R. Eklund for Gilbert Dewart, a seismologist at Wilkes Station, 1957.\nAntarctic Specially Protected Area\nThe island forms part of the Frazier Islands Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No.160 because it supports one of only four known breeding colonies of southern giant petrels on continental Antarctica.\nSee also\n* List of Antarctic and subantarctic islands\nReferences"
