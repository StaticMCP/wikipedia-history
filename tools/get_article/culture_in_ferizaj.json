Composer Lorenc Antoni worked in the city during the early 1940s; another composer is Venqenc Gjini.\nAttractions\nFerizaj has a mosque and a Serbian Orthodox church in close proximity. Nearby are the city library, a park and a number of coffee shops.\nLibraries\nIn 1950, the District of Ferizaj council founded the Miladin Popovic Library, which became Ferizaj's main library. Reading rooms opened in Talinovc Muhaxherve and Tankosiq in 1930, in the Old Village in 1934 and in Pojatisht and Kosine. During the Kosovo War, many libraries were destroyed. Immediately after the war, there were 8,334 books in the Anton Qeta Library before renovations. Ten computers were donated, and an internet network was installed. In 2005, the library had a total of 17,441 books.\nThe Sadik Tafarshiku Library, which opened on January 10, 2001, was funded by the city and the United States Agency for International Development and Save the Children. The library, which features exhibitions, scientific debates and literary hours, had 17,722 books and 1,252 members in 2005.\nNika’s Mill\nNika’s Mill, built during the 16th century, was demolished in the 1990s; €40,000 was allocated by the Ministry of Culture for its restoration. At this location is a square and a restaurant.\nMosque and church\nFerizaj's first mosque, built in 1894 during the Ottoman period, was destroyed by German aerial bombing in April 1941. The construction of a new mosque began in 1942, and was completed the following year. The first minaret was built in 1957, and the second in 2003.\nConstruction of the Orthodox church began in 1928 by the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and was completed in 1931. It was decided to build the church in the courtyard of the mosque; its proposed location was  from the current location, but due to poor building conditions the church was built facing the mosque.\nGoddess of Varosh\nThis antique figure is found in Varos, a prehistoric village in Ferizaj. The sun-baked ceramic figure, dating to the sixth millennium BC, indicates a cult of womanhood.\nHotel Luboten mural\nThe Hotel Luboten mural was painted in 1960 by a Macedonian artist. The mural, in the city center, has become identified with Ferizaj.\nMusic\nTonic and Trix are bands from Ferizaj. Trix was formed in spring 1974 with Veli Sahiti, Muhamet Bislimi and Nuredin Azemi.

The theater had a dance troupe with over 40 members. In 1955, a group of intellectuals founded Ferizaj's amateur theatre.\nNightlife\nFerizaj is noted for its nightclubs, and the best-known are the Diamonds Club and the Coco Club.
