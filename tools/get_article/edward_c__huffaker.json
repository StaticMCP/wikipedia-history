Huffaker was an American pioneer of manned flight best known for suggesting decades before anyone else that the Bernoulli Principle may allow curved wings to fly.\nIn 1889, he performed glider experiments in Chuckey, Tennessee. From 1895 to 1896, he worked for the Smithsonian Institution on aviation modeling by invitation of Octave Chanute. Late in 1896, he returned to Chuckey to test more gliders under the Smithsonian's Samuel Langley's instruction. He left the Smithsonian in 1898 following disagreements with Langley.\nHuffaker worked with the Wright brothers but they did not care for his personality or hygiene.\nHuffaker patented a flight-stabilization device in 1920.\nHuffaker never flew in an airplane.\nReferences\n*\n*"
