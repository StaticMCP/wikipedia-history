      "text": "# Canberra Sport Awards\n\nCanberra Sport Awards or CBR Sport Awards were originally established in 1984 by the Board of ACT Sports House. From 1984 to 2014 they were referred to as ACT Sportstar of the Year Awards and organised by ACTSPORT. The ACT Government took over the Awards after ACTSPORT ceased operations in 2015 and renamed them Canberra Sport Awards. There were no Awards in 2015 due to the transition from ACTSPORT to ACT Government.\nInductions to the ACT Sport Hall of Fame are part of the annual Awards.\nMajor Awards 1984-\nSeveral Awards - overall athlete and coach were not continued in Canberra Sport Awards.

The AIS Award was selected from athletes on scholarship at the Australian Institute of Sport campus in Canberra. In 2014, there was no AIS Award as the AIS no longer offered athlete scholarships.
