It belongs to the section Nigrescentes and is closely related to U. caerulea.\nIn the spring Utricularia warburgii produces 5–20&nbsp;cm. flower scapes bearing 2-6 violet-blue flowers, 8mm in size and bearing a yellow splotch at the throat.\nThe cultivation of this species is not difficult, and is similar to other commonly cultivated terrestrial Utricularia. Plants are best grown in a mixture of peat and sand that is kept constantly moist to wet and placed in bright light conditions.\nReferences\nLiterature\n*Goebel, K. I. 1890.: Ann. Jard. Bot.
