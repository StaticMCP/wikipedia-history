      "text": "# Treaty of Novgorod (1326)\n\nKingdom of Norway\n| depositor           =\n| language            =\n}}\nThe Treaty of Novgorod (; ) was signed on 3 June 1326 in Novgorod and marked the end of decades of the Norwegian-Novgorodian border skirmishes in the far-northern region of Finnmark. The terms were an armistice for 10 years. A few years earlier in 1323, the Republic of Novgorod had settled its conflict with Sweden in the Treaty of Nöteborg.\nThe treaty did not delineate the border but rather stipulated which part of the Sámi people would pay tribute to Norway and which to Novgorod, creating a kind of buffer zone in between the countries. The treaty remained in effect until the 19th century and was never abrogated by any of the powers. It eventually led into a situation where Sami people were freely exploited, some of them forced to pay taxes to all surrounding powers at the same time, including to the Birkarls from Swedish Finland.\nReferences"
