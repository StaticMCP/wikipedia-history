Since December 2019, King has been director of inclusion at Netflix, a department responsible for inclusion and diversity among corporate employees.\nBiography\nKing attended Massey University in Palmerston North, New Zealand, and graduated with a M.A degree in psychology in 2005. In 2008, King completed a post-graduate diploma in journalism from Auckland University of Technology (AUT). King continued her study at Australian Graduate School of Management where she earned her master's degree in business administration in 2013, and then her PhD in the field of organization and gender at Cranfield School of Management in 2023.\nKing began her journalism career reading the news for George FM and freelance writing for the Independent Financial Review. She then pursued her work as a reporter for Breakfast Business and also worked as a television reporter for New Zealand's national news program and Radio New Zealand. She has written for TIME, Huffington Post, Forbes, Bloomberg L.P., and Harvard Business Review on topics related to gender and the advancement of women in organizations.\nKing also took several positions in human resources and gender equality and worked for the United Nations at UN Women in the area of communications, diversity and inclusion. In 2019 Women Tech Founders, a Chicago-based organization dedicated to advancing women in the tech industry, awarded King with the 2019 Inspiring Innovator Award, for her outstanding achievements in the sector.\nDuring her PhD research, King conducted numerous interviews with the CEOs and corporate executives. They explained that the corporations expect their ideal employees to work long hours, be extrovert and not to have any social or family responsibilities. She learnt that most of the corporation work conditions match \"masculine, aggressive\" types of employees and are more suitable for white heterosexual men than for women or minorities. As a result, she launched \"the Fix\", a  radio podcast illuminating gender inequality in corporate business culture and also explaining how to overcome different obstacles at work.  Later, she wrote a book, The Fix Overcome the Invisible Barriers That Are Holding Women Back at Work, on the same subject. The book won Axiom Business Book Silver Award in the category \"Women/Minorities in Business\".\nKing is a member of the advisory board of Girl Up, a Washington D.C.–based foundation established by the United Nations.\nBook\n*King, M.
