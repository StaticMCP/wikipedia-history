After hearing an appeal to the king to protect a manuscript, cockroaches of less nobility (or lesser insects) would refrain from intruding on documents which could be eaten by the king only. Since many manuscripts were made with fish-glue, starch-paste, leather, and other edible substances, insect appetites were a constant problem to Arabic books and scrolls. A similar technique from Syria was to name the first and last page of a document or manuscript \"The Page of the King of the Cockroaches\", in the hope that the Cockroach King would control all other insects. Translated appeals include \"O Kabi:kaj, save the paper!\", \"O Kabi:kaj, save this book from the worms!\" and \"O Kabi:kaj, do not eat this paper!\" \"In Maghribi manuscripts, the word appears in its evidently corrupt form, Kaykataj and is clearly used as a talisman... and mentions, after a certain Muhammad al-Samiri, that when one writes Kaytataj on the first and last folio of the book, one can be sure that worms will not attack it.\"\n*Along with rats, cockroaches are frequently seen infesting various locations in Steve Purcell's comic book series Sam & Max, and one storyline features a race of gigantic cockroaches living on the moon.\n*Archy the cockroach is a sympathetic writer and chronicler in a classic series of newspaper columns by Don Marquis.\n*In Revolt of the Cockroach People, an autobiographical novel by Oscar Zeta Acosta, cockroaches are used as a metaphor for oppressed and downtrodden minorities in US society in the 1960s and 1970s, particularly Mexican-Americans.
