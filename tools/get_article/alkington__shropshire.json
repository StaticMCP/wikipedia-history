The Cotton family rose in prominence due to proximity to Sir Rowland Hill, (publisher of the Geneva Bible and hero of Shakespeare’s As You Like It) whose lands they managed in Shropshire. Architectural association with Hill’s house at Soulton Hall is observable: the out put of a relationship between the families potentially operational into the seventeenth century and seen in the evacuation of the Old Sir Rowland's library from Soulton around the time of the 1643 Battle of Wem, with the forwarding on of his papers into what us now called the Cotton Library.\nRowland Cotton of this family was a favourite of Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales and was an MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme for many years and High Sheriff of Shropshire for 1616. His monument in nearby Norton-in-Hales was designed by Inigo Jones.\nThe Cotton family are important in holding what is known today as the Cotton Library, which saved multiple important documents (including Beowulf and Magna Carter) for the English nation.\nSome alterations and improvements were made in the late 19th century. It was saved from a fire in 2010 when in the ownership of John and Elaine Fearnall.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
