It took place on December 15, 2017, at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City, New York.\nStorylines\nFinal Battle 2017 features professional wrestling matches, which involve different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers portray villains or heroes as they follow a series of events that build tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches.\nAt War of the Worlds UK: Liverpool, ROH World Champion Cody defeated Sanada. After the match, he proclaimed that he had beaten everyone, but Dalton Castle interrupted. Cody avoided a confrontation and attacked Castle the next night, injuring Castle's shoulder. At Global Wars: Chicago, Cody was taking pictures with fans prior to his match, only for one of the fans to be a masked Castle. Castle later issued a challenge for Cody's championship, which was made official.\nEvent\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ Other on-screen personnel\n!|Role:\n!|Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Commentators\n|Colt Cabana\n|-\n|Ian Riccaboni\n|-\n|Ring announcer\n|Bobby Cruise\n|-\n|rowspan=3|Referees\n|Todd Sinclair\n|-\n|Paul Turner\n|-\n|Mike Posey\n|}\nPreliminary matches\nThe event opened with Matt Taven, accompanied by Kingdom teammates T.
