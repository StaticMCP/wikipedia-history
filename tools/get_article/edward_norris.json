At age 16, he dropped out of the Culver Military Academy to marry a socially prominent physician's daughter, Virginia Bell Hiller, and took a job as a reporter.\nTelevision\nNorris made his television debut in 1951 with two appearances on Fireside Theater.\nDuring the course of his 12-year span on television he made two guest appearances on Perry Mason: \"The Case of the Fiery Fingers\" (1958) and \"The Case of the Tarnished Trademark\" (1962). He ended his film and television career the following year when he appeared on an episode of The Third Man, titled \"Ghost Town\".\nMilitary service\nNorris was a flying instructor in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II.\nPersonal life\nAfter Hiller, Norris was married to actresses Ann Sheridan and Lona Andre. On July 21, 1942, newspaper columnist Harrison Carroll reported that Norris \"eloped to Arizona Saturday with a new Hollywood beauty who gave her name as Jane Doe.\" Another newspaper report said, \"An affidavit on file testified that the girl's correct name was Jane Doe.\" The bride's real name was revealed by columnist Jimmie Fidler on July 30, 1942: \"The girl Edward Norris married and introduced to reporters as 'Jane Doe' is June Satterlee, ex-night club hatcheck looker. She's to make a picture to be titled Meet Jane Doe.\" In March 1943, Norris was granted a divorce from Satterlee \"after testifying that she married him solely to further her career in pictures.\" Mickey June Satterlee was the older sister of Peggy Larue Satterlee, known for accusing Errol Flynn of statutory rape, the incident occurring when Peggy was 15 in August 1941. Both sisters were aspiring actresses. Flynn was acquitted of rape in February 1943.\nNorris was an avid shooter and \"won many ribbons and trophies in skeet matches throughout the country.\" He was also a licensed pilot.\nDeath\nNorris died on December 18, 2002, at Fort Bragg, California.\nFilmography\n(in back) Edward Norris, and Anita Louise in The Gorilla (1939)]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Film\n|-\n!
