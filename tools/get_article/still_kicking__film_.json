The catalyst for Young's film was Amy Gorman and Frances Kandl's Project Arts & Longevity through which they were exploring the link between longevity and artistic vitality. Along with the film the joint project resulted in a book entitled Aging Artfully.\n''Still Kicking's'' first festival screening was at the 2006 Real to Reel Film Festival in North Carolina. The film was also selected for screening by the 2006 Independents' Film Festival, the 2006 Port Townsend Film Festival, the 2007 Missouri International Film Festival, and the 2007 Santa Barbara International Film Festival.\nIn 2003 Young produced his first documentary called \"Do You Know Yellowlegs is a Storytelling Museum?\" on the Oakland storyteller Orunamamu, known for her flamboyant attire which included yellow \"psychedelic spandex leggings\" Gorman had interviewed Orunamamu as part of the Project and the film caught their attention. When the three met, Young asked if he could document their process.\nCitations\nReferences\n* Foreword by Robert A.
