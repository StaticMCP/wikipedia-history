It is the oldest of the state arms of Australia, having been granted in 1893 by Queen Victoria, through the simplest heraldic grants of only the shield of arms, motto, helmet, mantling and crest. In 1977, the red deer and the brolga were assigned as supporters by Queen Elizabeth II during her Silver Jubilee.\nHistory\nThe original coat of arms were designed by Sir Albert Woods, Garter King of Arms (head) of the Heralds College. He created four different designs (produced below) which were sent to the Chief Secretary and Premier of Queensland, Sir Samuel Griffith who selected the design that Woods favoured. In order to ensure secrecy, the choice of arms was communicated by telegraph to London using the respective code words, \"Halfpay\", \"Halfprice\", \"Iceblink\" and \"Icebound\".\nIn 1963  the heraldic depiction of the British Imperial Crown was switched to a depiction of St Edward's Crown.\nThe final and current addition to the coat of arms was created in 1977, the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, with the granting of the red deer and brolga as supporting animals. The deer represents the old world and it is a classic animal of heraldry while the brolga represents the native population and is also the state's official bird.\nHeraldic description\nThe blazon of the coat of arms is:\nModernised, this means:\nSymbolism\nIndustrial influence\nThe symbols on the shield represent what Queensland's largest industries at the time the arms were designed. The wheat industry's origins belong with the first settlers in 1788, as the farms were worked by the convicts brought over from England, an idea of Governor Phillip. During the years till 1795, the wheat industry slowly gained popularity and by the late 19th century was a strong force in the agricultural industry of the state. The sugar industry became established by 1868 in Mackay which was a mere four years after the first commercial sugar mill was opened in Cleveland, south of Brisbane. Sugar and Coffee regulations were brought in by Parliament later that year as the industry spread rapidly and with the creation of the Mackay Central Sugar Mill Manufacturing Company ten years later in 1878, the sugar industry had reached its colonial peak.\nThe sheep industry had been in existence since the early 1820s within Australia and by the early 1880s the geographical expansion of this industry had hit Queensland in which major wool auctions were held throughout the state. The mining industry began with the discovery of copper on 20 May 1867 by Ernest Henry in Cloncurry and the industry climbed with the Gold Rush which occurred on 3 September 1873 when gold was discovered in Georgetown. The beef industry was quite prevalent by the late 1880s and by 1890, Queensland had exported Australia's first major export overseas which consisted of 1500 tons and by the 20th century that number had exploded to 43,000 tons.\nSupporting animals\nThe brolga is one of Australia's two native crane species and the only one solely found in Australia. They stand 1&nbsp;m tall with a wing-span of up to 2.4&nbsp;m. They are generally grey and are known for their distinctive energetic mating dance as well as their loud trumpeting \"garooo\" call. They are mostly found along the coast from Rockhampton to the Gulf of Carpentaria. They became the official bird emblem of Queensland in January 1986.\nThe red deer is a traditional beast of heraldry and was introduced into Queensland from the royal herds near London. Despite their position on the coat of arms, deer are a declared feral pest in Queensland with it being illegal to distribute, trade, release into the environment, move or feed any deer under the Biosecurity Act 2014.\nMaltese Cross\nThe Maltese cross has a stranger history than the rest of the elements upon the arms. The Maltese Cross with a superimposed crown was sourced from the state badge, however it is not known how this badge was designed. One popular theory is that Queensland sought to associate itself with the newly issued Victoria Cross (which contains a Maltese Cross with the royal arms and a lion superimposed), first bestowed to Crimean War soldiers by Queen Victoria in 1857, a few years before Queensland became a separate colony in 1859. Another theory is that there was a connection between the Maltese Cross and Lady Bowen, wife of the first governor Sir George Bowen. Given that the Maltese Cross was not adopted until 1876, many years after the governor and his wife left in 1868, the former theory appears stronger.\nGallery\nBelow is a visual evolution of Queensland's coat of arms.\nReferences"
