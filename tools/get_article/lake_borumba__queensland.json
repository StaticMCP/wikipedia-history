It was established to provide schooling to the children of the dam workers who lived at the construction site. There were two teachers at the school. Average attendance numbers in 1961 were 35 students. At the start of 1962, it became Borumba Dam State School with an average attendance of 54 students rising to an average of 61 students in 1963. The dam was completed in March 1964 and the workers and their children moved away with average attendance of 17 children in early 1964. The school closed on 29 May 1964.
