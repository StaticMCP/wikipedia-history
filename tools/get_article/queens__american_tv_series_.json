It starred Eve, Naturi Naughton, Nadine Velazquez and Brandy Norwood. Despite receiving generally positive reviews from critics, ABC canceled the series after one season in May 2022.\nPlot\nBrianna, Naomi, Jill and Valeria once performed as the \"Nasty Bitches\" in the 1990s. Together, the four of them not only turned the world of hip-hop upside down but also achieved legendary status through their music. The four women are now in their forties, unworldly and largely estranged from one another. By reuniting the four, there is now a chance to return to old fame and prestige. But will the former megastars, also known as Professor Sex, Butter Pecan, Jill Da Thrill, and Xplicit Lyrics, manage to achieve this ambitious goal?\nCast and characters\nMain\n* Eve as Brianna \"Professor Sex\" Robinson\n*Brandy Norwood as Naomi \"Xplicit Lyrics\" Harris-Jones\n* Naturi Naughton as Jill \"Da Thrill\" Sumpter\n* Nadine Velazquez as Valeria \"Butter Pecan\" Mendez\n* Taylor Sele as Eric Jones, manager of the group\n* Pepi Sonuga as Lauren \"Lil Muffin\" Rice\nRecurring\n* Precious Way as Jojo Harris, Naomi's 20-year-old daughter\n* Cam'ron as a fictionalized version of himself, a rapper who was featured on one of the group's hit records and also had a previous relationship with Naomi.
