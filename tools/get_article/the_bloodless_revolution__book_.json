It was published in the United States as The Bloodless Revolution: A Cultural History of Vegetarianism From 1600 to Modern Times.\nThe book documents the history of vegetarianism in Europe over the last 400 years and argues that Western vegetarian diets were influenced by travellers' tales from India. Stuart explores the vegetarianism of Thomas Bushell, John Robins, Thomas Tryon, George Cheyne, Roger Crab, John Oswald and others.\nReception\nHistorian Chandak Sengoopta commented that \"The Bloodless Revolution is a wonderful book, crammed with original research and written with verve, wit and passion. The most enthralling work of cultural history I have read in years, it brings out the political, ethical and environmental implications of our dietary choices without any preachiness.\" Philosopher A. C. Grayling praised the historical research of the book.\nThe book was positively reviewed by Publishers Weekly who suggested that \"Stuart offers a masterful social and cultural history of a movement that changed the ways people think about the food they eat.\" A review by Kirkus Reviews described it as \"Culinary and cultural history intertwined: readable, and endlessly interesting.\"\nSee also\n* Vegetarianism in the Romantic Era\nReferences"
