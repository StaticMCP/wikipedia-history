The company merged with Syracuse Consolidated Street Railway in 1890, after an agreement was made that allowed the new company to lease the lines.\nThe city railway extended from Railroad Street through Clinton, Walton, West, Gifford, Geddes and returning in a loop through Delaware, Holland and Niagara to Gifford Street, a total distance of  in the city's Near Westside. By 1875, the road extended from Washington Street to South Street and Geddes Street.\nReferences"
