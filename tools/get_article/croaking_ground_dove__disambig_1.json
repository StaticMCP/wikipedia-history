The adult female's head is brown and the wing markings are less intense than the male's. Juveniles are similar to the female but their feathers have buffy tips.\nDistribution and habitat\nThe croaking ground dove is found near the Pacific coast from Nariño Department in extreme southwestern Colombia through Ecuador and Peru to Chile's Tarapacá Region. Its range in Peru also includes the more inland Marañón Valley. It inhabits arid and semi-arid landscapes with scrub and riparian thickets, and is often found in farmland, gardens, and parks.
