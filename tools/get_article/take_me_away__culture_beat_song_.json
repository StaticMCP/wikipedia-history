The song was co-written by band member Jay Supreme and became a hit in many countries, particularly in Finland where it reached number six. It was also a top-20 hit in Belgium, and a top-30 hit in Germany, Iceland and Sweden. Outside Europe, the song peaked at number four on the Canadian Dance/Urban chart and number 39 on the US Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales chart. The accompanying music video for \"Take Me Away\" was directed by Nikolas Mann and first aired in September 1996. A CD maxi with new remixes was also available, but it was marketed at the same time as the other media.\nCritical reception\nShawnee Smith, of Billboard magazine gave the song a mixed review, saying that while the song \"hasn't moved far beyond that formula [of \"Mr. Vain\"]\", lead singer Tania Evans is \"quite the charmer, and producer/writer Cyborg has a way with hooks that is hard to resist.\" Simon Price from Melody Maker wrote, \"When Culture Beat's Tania Evans, in her saddest Rose Royce (Euro rhyming slang), sings, I...I hope I am your type, it says more to me about party fears and disco paranoia than The Smiths \"How Soon Is Now\" ever did.\"\nTrack listings\n* CD maxi-single (Europe, 1996)\n# \"Take Me Away\" (Radio Edit) – 3:55\n# \"Take Me Away\" (Extended Mix) – 6:59\n# \"Take Me Away\" (Doom Mix) – 6:02\n# \"Take Me Away\" (Sweetbox Hotpants Mix) – 6:02\n# \"Take Me Away\" (Aboria Euro Mix) – 6:11\n# \"Take Me Away\" (Special A Capella Version (Not Normal Mix)) – 3:23\n# \"Hamana\" - 5:21\n* CD maxi-single - Remix (Germany, 1996)\n# \"Take Me Away\" (M'N'S Gazelled Up Mix) – 7:37\n# \"Take Me Away\" (M'N'S Full On Vocal Mix) – 6:59\n# \"Take Me Away\" (GEDO Mix) – 6:16\n# \"Take Me Away\" (Doug Laurent Mix) – 6:10\n# \"Take Me Away\" (Tokapi's House Of Summer Mix) – 5:37\n# \"Take Me Away\" (Hard To Be Hip Mix) – 5:57\n* CD maxi-single (USA, 1997)\n# \"Take Me Away\" (Radio Edit) – 3:37\n# \"Take Me Away\" (Aboria Euro Radio) – 3:41\n# \"Take Me Away\" (Sweetbox Hotpants Radio Edit) – 3:33\n# \"Take Me Away\" (Extended Mix) – 6:55\n# \"Take Me Away\" (Aboria Euro Mix) – 6:07\n# \"Take Me Away\" (Sweetbox Hotpants Mix) – 5:58\n# \"Take Me Away\" (M'N's Gazelled Up Mix) – 7:21\n# \"Take Me Away\" (Doug Laurent Mix) – 6:07\nCharts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Weekly chart performance for \"Take Me Away\"\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1996–97)\n!align=\"center\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Canada Dance/Urban (RPM)\n| 4\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100)\n| 59\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Finland (Suomen virallinen lista)\n| 6\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Germany (Media Control Charts)\n| 26\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Iceland (Íslenski Listinn Topp 40)\n| 29\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Netherlands (Dutch Top 40 Tipparade)\n| 3\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Scotland (OCC)\n| 59\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (OCC)\n| 52\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100\n| 11\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales (Billboard)\n| 39\n|}\nReferences"
