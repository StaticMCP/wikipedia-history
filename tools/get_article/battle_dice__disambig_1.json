It was created by Genie Toys and licensed to Playmates Toys and it began with the majority of the superheroes and supervillains from Marvel in 2006.\nMarvel Battle Dice\nThe figures' booster packs contained 3 random battle figures and one battle die. The starter set cane with 6 figures. There are also battle dice launchers, which are large sized versions of the Thing and the Hulk.\nThe Game\nThe game works by placing the figures (approximately 1\" inch) in the battle dice, which have certain attributes by popping the dice open. When the dice are rolled, the player with the lower dice roll goes first. They select an attribute on the character, and use them to battle the other figure(s). Then the attributes take place, and so on and so forth, and the player with a certain roll wins, etc. Currently, there are 23 different dice. The attributes are measured on a 0-6 scale, 6 being the highest; those attributes are: Intelligence, Strength, Speed, Durability, Energy, and Fighting Skills. Characters are ranked points; in most tournaments teams cannot exceed 30 points, making figures like the powerful Dark Phoenix too expensive to use. A comprehensive explanation can be found at any of the first two links in the links section.\nThe Production Run\nOn September 12, 2006 Playmates Toys officially announced that the game would no longer be supported. The official site announced that the company would be turning its attention away from the game. Series 2 figures although announced for release no longer have an official release date and may never ship. The game received quite a few reviews all of which were above average. And an official reason has not been given as to the end of this games production.\nTournament vouchers should be honored until the beginning of December 2006. After that time they will return any further vouchers un-opened. The first official tournament was held in Sandy Utah on May 20, 2006. The last official tournament has not been revealed.\nSet 1\nIn January 2006, Playmates Toys released the first set consisting of 68 characters, which are:\n*001 - Captain America\n*002 - Captain America (Transparent)\n*003 - Hawkeye\n*004 - Human Torch\n*005 - Invisible Woman\n*006 - Iron Man\n*007 - Mister Fantastic\n*008 - She-Hulk\n*009 - Silver Surfer\n*010 - The Thing\n*011 - The Thing (Transparent)\n*012 - Thor\n*013 - AIM agent\n*014 - Annihilus\n*015 - Baron Zemo\n*016 - Doctor Doom\n*017 - Loki\n*018 - Mole Man\n*019 - Red Skull\n*020 - Super-Skrull\n*021 - Thanos\n*022 - Ultron (Transparent)\n*023 - Ultron\n*024 - Black Cat\n*025 - Black Spider-Man\n*026 - Daredevil\n*027 - Doctor Strange\n*028 - Elektra\n*029 - Ghost Rider\n*030 - Nick Fury\n*031 - Punisher\n*032 - Spider-Man\n*033 - Spider-Man (Transparent)\n*034 - Hulk\n*035 - Hulk (Transparent)\n*036 - Abomination\n*037 - Blackheart\n*038 - Bullseye\n*039 - Carnage\n*040 - Doctor Octopus\n*041 - Doctor Octopus (Transparent)\n*042 - Hobgoblin\n*043 - Mysterio\n*044 - Rhino\n*045 - Venom\n*046 - Vulture\n*047 - Archangel\n*048 - Banshee\n*049 - Beast\n*050 - Cyclops\n*051 - Gambit\n*052 - Kitty Pryde\n*053 - Nightcrawler\n*054 - Professor X\n*055 - Psylocke\n*056 - Wolverine\n*057 - Wolverine (Transparent)\n*058 - Apocalypse\n*059 - Dark Phoenix\n*060 - Deadpool\n*061 - Magneto\n*062 - Magneto (Transparent)\n*063 - Mimic\n*064 - Mojo\n*065 - Mystique\n*066 - Sabretooth\n*067 - Sentinel\n*068 - Toad\n*069 - Wolverine (Stealth)\nThere are also \"Clear\" forms of Wolverine, Spider-Man, Magneto, Captain America, the Thing, Doctor Octopus, Ultron and the Hulk that \"re-arrange\" their abilities.

Their own site for the game was deactivated shortly thereafter, leaving the future of the game — not to mention the two above-mentioned expansions — rather nebulous. Fan support of the game, though scattered, still remains.\nSee also\n*Game design\n*Dice Throne\nReferences"
