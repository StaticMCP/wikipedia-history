Kellogg graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1892 and joined the Naval Engineer Corps. He served as an assistant engineer on numerous ships and participated in the Spanish–American War. He retired in 1920, and became governor three years later, making him only one of two Naval Governors of American Samoa to hold the office following retirement from the service. As Governor, Kellogg asserted the authority of the United States over the tribal chiefs of the islands. He removed the title of Tu'i Manu'a from Chris Young, claiming it implied king-like authority over the people of American Samoa, resulting in widespread protest among the islands' people. Kellogg died at the National Naval Medical Center in Maryland and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\nLife\n.]]\nKellogg was born on August 20, 1870, in Morrisania, Bronx.

As governor, he prohibited certain native death ceremonies, imposing a small fine and imprisonment on those who continued to practice the customs. Along with John Martin Poyer, Kellogg is one of only two Naval Governors of American Samoa who served in the office following retirement from the Navy. He came into some dispute with Chris Young, a man elected as Tu'i Manu'a, or king, of American Samoa by several chiefs. Kellogg argued that the idea was incompatible with the Constitution of the United States and denied Young the title. Kellogg also dealt with the removal of Young and his placement under house arrest, after other Samoan chiefs called him a \"disturbing influence\". Inaccurate rumors were spread that Kellogg had banished him from the islands, causing widespread protest and declarations that he was ruling as a despot.\nBibliography\n*\nReferences"
