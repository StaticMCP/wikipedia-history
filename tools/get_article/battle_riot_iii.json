      "text": "# Battle Riot III\n\nBattle Riot III was a professional wrestling event produced by Major League Wrestling (MLW) that took place on July 10, 2021, at the 2300 Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was MLW's first event since its hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic to feature live ticketed fans, the last being the MLW vs AAA Super Series in 2020. It was the third event under the Battle Riot chronology.\nThe event featured matches that would be taped for future MLW programming; the main card aired as a television special on July 24, 2021, on beIN Sports USA and MLW's YouTube channel. The undercard would air as part of the mini-series, MLW Fusion: Alpha, which premiered on September 22, 2021, on YouTube.\nStorylines\nThe show featured twelve professional wrestling matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\nSeveral names announced to participate in the Battle Riot were Alexander Hammerstone, King Muertes, Richard Holliday, Zenshi, Lee Moriarty, TJP, Gringo Loco, Arez, Kevin Ku, Mads Krügger, Myron Reed, Gino Medina, Calvin Tankman, Savio Vega, E. J. Nduka, Aramís, Marshall Von Erich, Ross Von Erich, King Mo, Bu Ku Dao, Alex Kane, Davey Richards, Daivari, Kit Osbourne, Josef Samael, Simon Gotch, Ikuro Kwon, Tom Lawlor, KC Navarro and Jordan Oliver.\nEvent\nBefore the match, Azteca Underground owner Cesar Duran made his first appearance in an MLW ring and announced he was MLW's new matchmaker. He was then interrupted by Myron Reed and Jordan Oliver of Injustice, who demanded a match for the MLW World Tag Team Championship. They were in-turn interrupted by Konnan and a new incarnation of The Latin American Xchange (now composed of Slice Boogie, Rivera (formally known as Danny Limelight) and Dr. Julius Smokes), later to be known as 5150, and the two teams would get into a brawl.\nResults\n|note1 = dark\n|match1 = Rustin Grundy defeated Anthony Catena\n|stip1 = Singles match\n|time1 =\n|match2 = Delmi Exo (with Ashley Vox) defeated Brittany Blake\n|stip2 = Singles match\n|time2 = 6:40\n|match3 = Alex Kane (with King Mo) defeated Budd Heavy\n|stip3 = Singles match\n|time3 = 3:08\n|match4 = Gino Medina defeated KC Navarro\n|stip4 = Singles match\n|time4 = 4:16\n|match5 = The Von Erichs (Marshall Von Erich and Ross Von Erich) defeated Team Filthy (Kevin Ku and Kit Osbourne) (with Tom Lawlor)\n|stip5 = Bunkhouse Brawl\n|time5 = 11:24\n|match6 = Calvin Tankman defeated Lee Moriarty\n|stip6 = Singles match\n|time6 = 10:59\n|match7 = King Muertes defeated Richard Holliday (c)\n|stip7 =Caribbean Rules match for the IWA Caribbean Heavyweight Championship\n|time7 = 11:12\n|match8 = Alexander Hammerstone (c) defeated Tom Lawlor\n|stip8 = Singles match for the MLW National Openweight Championship\n|time8 = 12:43\n|match9 = Willow Nightingale defeated Ashley Vox (with Delmi Exo)\n|stip9 = Singles match\n|time9 = 7:16\n|match10= Davey Richards defeated TJP\n|stip10= Singles match\n|time10 = 15:01\n|match11 = 5150 (Rivera and Slice Boogie) defeated Injustice (Jordan Oliver and Myron Reed)\n|stip11 = Tag team match\n|time11 = 6:59\n|match12 = Aramís defeated Arez\n|stip12 = Singles match\n|time12 = 11:50\n|match13 = Jacob Fatu (c) defeated Matt Cross\n|stip13 = Singles match for the MLW World Heavyweight Championship\n|time13 = 11:17\n|match14 = Alexander Hammerstone won by last eliminating Mads Krügger\n|stip14  = 41-man Battle Riot match for a future MLW World Heavyweight Championship opportunity\n|time14 = 56:00\n}}\nBattle Riot match entrances and eliminations\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Draw\n!Entrant\n!Order\n!Eliminated by\n!Method of elimination\n!Elimination(s)\n|-\n|1||Davey Richards||24||Lance Anoa'i||Over the top rope||2\n|-\n|2||Tom Lawlor||2||Davey Richards||Over the top rope||0\n|-\n|3||TJP||13||E.
