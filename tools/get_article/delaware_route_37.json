The route runs from DE&nbsp;273 in Pleasantville northeast to U.S. Route&nbsp;202 (US&nbsp;202)/DE&nbsp;141 north of the Wilmington Airport near Wilmington Manor. The road runs through suburban neighborhoods and passes along the edge of Wilmington Airport along Airport Road before it provides access to a business park along Commons Boulevard. The Airport Road portion of DE&nbsp;37 was originally a dirt road that was paved by 1942. DE&nbsp;37 was assigned to its current alignment by 1985.\nRoute description\nDE&nbsp;37 heads to the northeast from DE&nbsp;273 on two-lane undivided Airport Road. It passes through suburban neighborhoods and then intersects DE&nbsp;58 in a commercial area. Past the DE&nbsp;58 intersection, the route widens into a four-lane divided highway and forms the northwestern boundary of the Wilmington Airport, with residential areas on the opposite side of the road. After the boundary with the airport, Airport Road splits to the northwest and DE&nbsp;37 becomes Commons Boulevard, and it passes through the New Castle Corporate Commons, a business park located adjacent to the Wilmington Airport. The route continues northeast and intersects Spruance Drive, which is the entrance road to the Delaware Air National Guard's New Castle Air National Guard Base to the east, before it comes to its terminus at US&nbsp;202/DE&nbsp;141.\nDE&nbsp;37 northbound past DE&nbsp;58 near New Castle\nDE&nbsp;37 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 21,344&nbsp;vehicles at the US&nbsp;202/DE&nbsp;141 intersection to a low of 8,264&nbsp;vehicles at the DE&nbsp;58 intersection.\nHistory\nBy 1920, the Airport Road portion of DE&nbsp;37 existed as a county road. This road was originally a dirt road that was paved by 1942. In 1985, the Commons Boulevard portion of the route was built and DE&nbsp;37 was designated to run along its current alignment. Between May 2005 and June 2006, DE&nbsp;37 was reconstructed and widened from a two-lane road to a four-lane divided highway along Airport Road between DE&nbsp;58 and Commons Boulevard. The widening project cost $8.6 million.\nMajor intersections\n|notes=Southern terminus\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=Northern terminus\n}}\nSee also\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.aaroads.com/guides/de-037/ DE&nbsp;37 at AARoads.com]"
