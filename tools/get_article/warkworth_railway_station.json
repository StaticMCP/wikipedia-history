Benjamin Green was the station's architect. It was situated north of the Station Road level crossing near Houndean Mill, between Warkworth and the hamlet of Eastfield. Two sidings served the coal depot south of the up passenger platform while the goods shed was to the north, also on the up side. Two sidings south of the down side passenger platform served the cattle dock. Warkworth was one of the stations to remain open from 1941 to 1946. In 1951, only 1,023 tickets were sold in the year, an average of three a day.\nWarkworth eventually closed to passengers on 15 September 1958 and closed totally after goods traffic stopped on 2 April 1962. The station house still stands as a Grade II Listed Building, currently a private accommodation. There have been proposals to reopen the station.\nReferences\nExternal links\nLine and station open |next=Line and station open |route=North Eastern RailwayYork, Newcastle and Berwick Railway |col= }}"
