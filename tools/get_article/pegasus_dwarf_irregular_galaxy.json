It was discovered by A. G. Wilson in the 1950s. The Pegasus Dwarf is a companion of the Andromeda Galaxy in the Local Group.\nGeneral information\nIn 1975 Tully & Fisher determined that it was part of the Local Group.\nThe metallicity and the related distance estimate has been subject to discussions in the scientific literature, with varying results; however, recently, by use of the tip of the red-giant branch, a distance within 10% error was achieved in 2000\nand then improved to 3% in 2005.\nIn popular culture\nThe science fiction television series Stargate Atlantis takes place in the \"Pegasus galaxy\" and has shown images of an irregular galaxy. However, the franchise has not explicitly stated if it is the Irregular, Spheroidal, or an entirely fictional location, but since the series claimed the Pegasus galaxy to be 3 million light years away, it is likely the irregular one.\nGallery\nImage:Local Group.svg|Location of Pegasus Dwarf in the Local Group.\nPegasus Dwarf-DDO216-starhopper.jpg|Pegasus Dwarf imaged by an amateur astronomer\nFile:Pegasus Dwarf Irregular Galaxy Hubble.jpg|Part of the Pegasus Dwarf with Hubble\nSee also\n* Pegasus Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy (Peg dSph)\n* Pegasus galaxy, the Stargate Atlantis fictional location.\nNotes\nNED gives the galaxy classification as both dIrr and dSph, which means that it is a transitory between dwarf irregular and dwarf spheroidal.  It is noted as transitory in Cole et al. 1999.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
