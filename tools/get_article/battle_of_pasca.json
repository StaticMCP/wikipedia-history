The battle took place  1470 in the vicinity of Pasca, in modern-day Cundinamarca, Colombia, and resulted in a victory for Saguamanchica.\nBackground\nBefore the Spanish conquest of the Muisca the central highlands of the Colombian Andes (the Altiplano Cundiboyacense) were inhabited by a number of indigenous groups. The most numerous were the Muisca, who lived in the central valleys of the eastern ranges. The leader of the southern Muisca at the time was the freshly installed Saguamanchica, successor to his uncle Meicuchuca. Their neighbours to the northwest were the Muzo; south of them were the Muisca's traditional enemy the Panche; occupying the southeastern part of present-day Cundinamarca were the Sutagao.\nBattle\n}}]]\n| position = left\n}}\n}}]]\n| position = top\n}}\n}}\nShortly after taking power in 1470 Saguamanchica decided to attempt to conquer the Sutagao. He sent an advance force to reconnoiter the area and followed from Bacatá with an army of around 30,000 guecha warriors. The Sutagao hid in the hills around the Pasca River, together with a number of their Panche allies, but Saguamanchica brought them to battle. After a struggle lasting 12 hours the Muisca captured Uzatama, an important cacique (leader) of the Sutagao, causing the Sutagao and Panche to rout.\nThe Cacique of Tibacuy then negotiated the submission of the Sutagao to Saguamanchica.\nAftermath\nSome twenty years later Saguamanchica fought another major battle; this time against the northern Muisca led by Zaque Michuá: the Battle of Chocontá. Both Muisca rulers died in this battle.\nSee also\n* Muisca warfare, history of Colombia, Battle of Tocarema\n* Muisca rulers, Battle of Chocontá\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
