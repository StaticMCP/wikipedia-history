It commemorates the Commonwealth of Nations member states' victims of the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. It was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on July 6, 2010, in a ceremony alongside her husband Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, then-Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg, then-Governor of New York David Paterson, and then-Governor of New Jersey Chris Christie.\nHistory\nOriginally planned as The British Memorial Garden, it was officially named The British Garden at Hanover Square by Prince Harry on May 29, 2009. On May 2, 2012, it was renamed the Queen Elizabeth II September  Garden at a rededication ceremony led by the Dean of Westminster Abbey. This was to include victims of other Commonwealth of Nations member countries who died in the September 11 attacks.\nDesign\nThe original idea for the garden came from Isabel and Julian Bannerman. Lynden Miller and Ronda M. Brands, both garden designers, later helped choose and plan the layout of plants and shrubs for the space.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/british-garden-at-hanover-square British Memorial Garden — Hanover Square] at New York City Department of Parks and Recreation\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120513082734/http://www.westminster-abbey.org/press/news/news/2012/may/dean-of-westminster-dedicates-queen-ii-garden-in-new-york Westminster Abbey press release]"
