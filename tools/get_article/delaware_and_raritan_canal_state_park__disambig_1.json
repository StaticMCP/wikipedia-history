It remains one today, and is used for canoeing, kayaking, and fishing. A graded natural-surface trail along the side of the canal, which was the tow path that mules used to tow barges on the canal before steam powered barges, is now used for hiking, jogging, bicycling, and horseback riding. These trail connect with the trails in Pennsylvania's Delaware Canal State Park by way of five bridges that cross the Delaware River. Some  of the main canal, and all  of the feeder canal, still exist. The park is operated and maintained by the New Jersey Division of Parks and Forestry.\nThe canal is accessible from many points along its route, with small parking areas providing access at most road crossings. One of the most scenic and popular sections of the D&R Canal state park is the segment along Lake Carnegie in Princeton, New Jersey, which features the canal on one side of the path and the lake on the other side. Another attractive section borders the Colonial Park Arboretum and Gardens in East Millstone.\nWhen the canal was used for transportation, New Jersey's landscape was mostly rural, and its primary business was agriculture. Research director of the New Jersey Historical Commission Howard Green is quoted as saying, \"it is one of the most beloved parks in the state, a sinewy, snake-like greenway through one of the most heavily populated parts of the world. It has gone from being the machine in the garden, to being the garden in the machine.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.dandrcanal.com/ Delaware & Raritan Canal Commission]\n* [http://www.nynjtc.org/park/delaware-raritan-canal-sp NY-NJTC: Delaware & Raritan Canal State Park Trail Details and Info]\n* [http://www.traillink.com/trail/delaware-and-raritan-canal-state-park-trail.aspx?gce=201304_1 Trailink]\n}}"
