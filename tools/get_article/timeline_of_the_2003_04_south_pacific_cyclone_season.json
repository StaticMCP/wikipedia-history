The season officially ran from November 1, 2003, to April 30, 2004, with the first disturbance of the season forming on December 4 and the last disturbance dissipating on April 23. This is the period of the year when most tropical cyclones form within the South Pacific Ocean.\nDuring the season at least 16 deaths resulted from tropical disturbances whilst overall damage was estimated at $ (2004&nbsp;USD; $}} &nbsp;USD). The most damaging tropical disturbance was Cyclone Heta which caused at least $ (2004&nbsp;USD; $}} &nbsp;USD) in damage to six different countries and left three dead. The deadliest tropical disturbance of the season was Tropical Depression 10F, which was responsible for eleven deaths and caused $ (2004&nbsp;USD; $}} &nbsp;USD) in damage. Cyclone Ivy also caused 2 deaths and caused $ (2004&nbsp;USD; $}} &nbsp;USD) worth of damage to Vanuatu. As a result of the impacts caused by Heta and Ivy, the names were retired from the tropical cyclone naming lists.\nWithin the South Pacific, tropical cyclones are monitored by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) in Nadi, Fiji, and the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (TCWC) in Wellington, New Zealand. RSMC Nadi attaches a number and an F suffix to tropical disturbances that form in or move into the South Pacific. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issues unofficial warnings within the South Pacific, designating tropical cyclones with a number and a P suffix. RSMC Nadi and TCWC Wellington both use the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale, and measure windspeeds over a period of ten minutes, while the JTWC measures sustained winds over a period of one minute and uses the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale.\nThis timeline includes information from post-storm reviews by RSMC Nadi, TCWC Wellington and the JTWC. It documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. Reports among warning centers often differ; as such, information from all three agencies has been included.\nTimeline\nNovember\n;November 1\n*0000 UTC, (1200 FST)&nbsp;– The 2003–04 South Pacific cyclone season officially begins.\nDecember\nImage of Tropical Depression 01F on December 4, 2003\n;December 4\n*0000 UTC, (1200 FST)&nbsp;– RSMC Nadi reports that Tropical Disturbance 01F has formed about 1965&nbsp;km (1220&nbsp;mi) to the north of Nadi, Fiji.\n;December 5\n*0600 UTC, (1800 FST)&nbsp;– RSMC Nadi reports that Tropical Disturbance 01F has intensified into a tropical depression.\n;December 6\n*0000 UTC, (1200 FST)&nbsp;– RSMC Nadi issues the  final advisory on Tropical Depression 01F.\n;December 16\n*1800 UTC, (0600 FST, December 17)&nbsp;– RSMC Nadi reports that Tropical Disturbance 02F has formed about 330&nbsp;km (205&nbsp;mi) to the northeast of Honiara in the Solomon Islands.\n;December 20\n*1800 UTC, (0600 FST, December 21)&nbsp;– RSMC Nadi passes the primary warning responsibility for Tropical Disturbance 02F to TCWC Brisbane as it moves into the Australian region.\n;December 25\n*0600 UTC, (1800 FST)&nbsp;– RSMC Nadi reports that Tropical Disturbance 03F has formed about 400&nbsp;km (250&nbsp;mi) to the northwest of Suva, Fiji.\n;December 28\n*1800 UTC, (0600 FST, December 29)&nbsp;– RSMC Nadi reports that Tropical Disturbance 03F has intensified into a tropical depression.\n;December 29\n*0000 UTC, (1200 FST)&nbsp;– RSMC Nadi reports that Tropical Disturbance 04F has formed about 120&nbsp;km (75&nbsp;mi) to the south of Honiara in the Solomon Islands.\n*1800 UTC, (0600 FST, December 21)&nbsp;– RSMC Nadi issues the final advisory on Tropical Disturbance 04F.\n;December 30\n*0000 UTC, (1200 FST)&nbsp;– The JTWC designates Tropical Depression 03F as Tropical Depression 07P.\nJanuary\non January&nbsp;6, 2004|alt=Image of Cyclone Heta on January 6, 2004.]]\nalt=Heta formed in the upper center of the map before moving generally northeastward.
