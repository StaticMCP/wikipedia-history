The plaques themselves are permanent signs installed in publicly visible locations on buildings, monuments, or in special locations.\nWhile many Cultural Properties have historical markers installed, not all places marked with historical markers are designated into one of the particular categories of Cultural Properties.\nThe first historical marker in the Cebuano Language was unveiled in 2008 for the Cebu Provincial Capitol, Cebu City. Another marker in the same language was unveiled for Carcel de Cebu the next year.\nThe site of the historical marker of the Sandugo, or the blood compact between Sikatuna and Legazpi became an issue because of the NHCP board resolution that the event site was located off the waters of Loay and not Tagbilaran. Despite the resolution, the marker remains in its original place.\nThis article lists eighty-seven (87) markers from Central Visayas, including six (6) that are part of the Quincentennial historical markers series.\nBohol\nThis article lists thirty (30) markers from the province of Bohol.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:20%; background:#efefef;\"| Marker title\n! style=\"width:20%; background:#efefef;\"| English Translation\n! style=\"width:10%; background:#efefef;\"| Category\n! style=\"width:10%; background:#efefef;\"| Type\n! style=\"width:20%; background:#efefef;\"| Description\n! style=\"width:20%; background:#efefef;\"| Location\n! style=\"width:10%; background:#efefef;\"| Language\n! style=\"width:10%; background:#efefef;\"| Date Issued\n! style=\"width:10%; background:#efefef;\"| Image\n|-\n| Balilihan Belfry\n|\n| Structure\n| Belfry\n| Became a guard tower for the Spanish, Americans, and the Japanese.
