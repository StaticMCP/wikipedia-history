B. Culley Generating Station. The plant has four coal-fired, steam-powered turbines with a combined generating capacity of 791 MWe. Alcoa owns three of the four generating stations, which were placed into service in the early 1960s. The largest unit, known as Unit 4, is 323-MWe unit jointly owned by Alcoa and Vectren. This larger unit was placed in operation in 1970.\nFuel\nThe Power Plant is primarily fueled by Illinois Basin coal, which is mined from the nearby region. It receives approximately 2 million tons of coal annually through both rail and truck shipments.\nEnvironmental impact\nWarrick Plant discharges all of its waste heat (about twice its electrical output) into Ohio River. In 2006, Warrick Plant was the third most-polluting major power station in the US in terms of sulphur dioxide gas emission rate: it discharged  of SO2 for each MWh of electric power produced that year (92,919&nbsp;tons of SO2 per year in total).\nIn light of the high emissions and increasing regulation, Alcoa commenced a large scale $400 million environmental investment to improve emission levels. In December 2008, the project was complete and included wet-flue gas desulphurization equipment (also known as scrubbers). This control equipment significantly reduced sulfur dioxide emissions beyond those required by regulation. Vectren also contributed to the upgrades on its share of Unit 4.\nThe environmental control system also included gypsum dewatering and handling facilities, dry-ash handling, new coal handling equipment and improved control facilities. With the control systems fully operational and online in 2009, the plant saw more than a 95 percent reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions and other compounds.\nSee also\n* List of power stations in Indiana\n* Global warming\nReferences\nExternal links\n* http://www.vectren.com/web/eenablement/learn_about/environmental_stewardship/air_quality_i.jsp\n* [http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/6093534.jpg Barges hauling coal up the Ohio River with the F.
