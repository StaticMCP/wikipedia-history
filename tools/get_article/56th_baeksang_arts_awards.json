The annual awards ceremony is one of South Korea's most prestigious award shows, recognizing excellence in film, television, and theatre. The ceremony was initially set for May 1, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It did not invite an on-site audience to prevent the spread of the disease.\nThe nominations were announced on May 8, 2020. Parasite, which received the most nominations, was nominated in all film-related categories except for Best New Director for which the film does not qualify. For the first time ever, Netflix shows were nominated for the Baeksang Arts Awards, with the film Time to Hunt and the series Kingdom. The Theatre division was also revived for the first time in 19 years, with Baeksang Play, Best Actor and Best Actress added to the existing Best Short Play.\nThe highest honors of the night, Grand Prize (Daesang), were awarded to director Bong Joon-ho of Parasite in the film division and drama series When the Camellia Blooms in the television division. The candidates for Grand Prize – Film were Bong Joon-ho and Parasite. Bong was quickly selected as the winner due to the huge role he played in the film's success, leaving Parasite winning Best Film on a unanimous vote. The candidates for Grand Prize – Television were When the Camellia Blooms, Mister Trot and Kim Hee-ae of The World of the Married. When the Camellia Blooms was chosen as the winner in the third round of votes.
