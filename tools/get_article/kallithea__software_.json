While earlier versions of RhodeCode were licensed entirely under the GNU General Public License version 3, RhodeCode version 2.0 (released in August 2013) introduced exceptions for parts of the software distribution. According to Bradley M. Kuhn of Software Freedom Conservancy, this exception statement is ambiguous and \"leaves the redistributor feeling unclear about their rights\".\nKallithea is mostly written in Python.\nKallithea is a member project of Software Freedom Conservancy.\nFeatures\nKallithea supports hosting repositories of Mercurial and Git version control systems. Repositories can be grouped and thus allow to define common properties like access control. Its web interface for projects allows to fork as well as management of pull requests. It can also be used to quickly exchange code snippets by means of a revision controlled pastebin (\"gists\").\nSee also\n* Comparison of project management software\n* List of tools for code review\n* Comparison of source code hosting facilities\n* Apache Allura\n* Apache Bloodhound\n* Trac\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
