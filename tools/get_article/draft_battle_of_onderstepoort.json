It took place on 11 July 1900, during which a Boer force under the command of General Freek Grobler defeated a British force. Grobler was in charge of the Waterberg burghers, and he was aware of a British garrison near Pyramid Station, about 2 kilometers north of Wonderboompoort. Grobler and his men were planning an attack on this group when the same group attacked them just after dawn. Grobler's force returned fire. The British force moved between two groups of Boer forces and was now attacked from two sides. Their horses ran away in the thicket, and the British soldiers fell back in disorder. The Boers surrounded them and took 17 British prisoners. One British officer was killed. The rest of the British garrison fled.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* The War Reporter. J.E.H. Grobler.
