In practice, it was a general term for the independent armed groups of the Khmer Rouge, which were primarily divided into three factions:\n* The Northeastern Group, led by Pol Pot, was based in Cambodia's northeastern highlands among ethnic minorities.\n* The Southwestern Group, led by Hu Nim, operated in southern and southwestern Cambodia, in the Cardamom and Elephant Mountain ranges.\n* The Eastern Group, led by So Phim, was based in the densely populated eastern provinces between the Mekong River and the Vietnamese border.\nIn the years that followed, widespread dissatisfaction with the Sihanouk regime drove many Cambodians to flee government repression and join Khmer Rouge armed groups, leading to a rapid increase in the Revolutionary Army of Cambodia's ranks.\nAlliance with Sihanouk\nThe situation shifted in favour of the Khmer Rouge after the March 18, 1970 coup, in which Prime Minister Lon Nol, backed by the United States, ousted Head of State Norodom Sihanouk while he was abroad. In response, Sihanouk announced the formation of the National United Front of Kampuchea (FUNK) and the Royal Government of National Union of Kampuchea (GRUNK), aligning himself with all forces opposed to Lon Nol, the strongest among them being the Khmer Rouge.\nAs a result, the Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea was reorganized into the Cambodian People's National Liberation Armed Forces (CPNLAF), absorbing armed groups loyal to Sihanouk. Sihanouk's influence in rural Cambodia allowed the Khmer Rouge to expand their power significantly. By 1973, they effectively controlled most of Cambodia's territory, though only a small portion of its population. Many Cambodians who supported the Khmer Rouge did so under the belief that they were fighting for Sihanouk's return.\nIt was the CPNLAF that ultimately captured Phnom Penh and overthrew the Khmer Republic in April 1975, establishing complete Khmer Rouge rule over Cambodia.\nPurges and conflict with Vietnam\nEven before taking full power, the Khmer Rouge had begun purging the CPNLAF of Sihanouk's influence. From 1972 onward, after Richard Nixon's visit to China, Pol Pot's faction received increased backing from Beijing and gradually consolidated absolute control over the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK).\nOnce they secured power, the Khmer Rouge immediately executed former officers of the Khmer National Armed Forces and their families, without trials or publicity, to eliminate potential enemies. Additionally, they conducted large-scale internal purges, not only removing remnants of Sihanouk's supporters but also eradicating any suspected dissent to centralise power further.\nThe CPNLAF was restructured again into a formal national military force. Around 1976, it reverted to the name Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea, now as the unified national military of Democratic Kampuchea. Its air force was established in 1977.\nFrom as early as 1975, the Khmer Rouge launched cross-border attacks into Vietnam, burning villages, looting, and massacring civilians. Vietnam initially responded with restraint, limiting its actions to defensive counterattacks. However, as Pol Pot prepared for a full-scale war against Vietnam, he initiated another purge, executing numerous Khmer Rouge officials suspected of Vietnamese ties. Only a few, such as Heng Samrin and Hun Sen, managed to escape to Vietnam.\nSwift war and defeat\nThe war against Vietnam proved disastrous for the Khmer Rouge. Since the early 1970s, Vietnamese leaders had anticipated Khmer Rouge hostilities and took precautionary measures. From 1975 to 1978, Vietnam pursued a dual strategy: responding with restraint while simultaneously preparing for an inevitable war in the southwest.\nBy late 1978, Vietnam had established the Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation (FUNSK), composed of former Khmer Rouge officials, soldiers, and Cambodian exiles. Under the banner of FUNSK, Vietnam formed a Volunteer Army to liberate Cambodia from the Khmer Rouge genocide.\nIn just two weeks, Vietnamese forces obliterated the Khmer Rouge's main military divisions, captured Phnom Penh, and established the People's Republic of Kampuchea.\nU.S. and Chinese alliance\nUnder the overwhelming assault of Vietnamese forces, the Khmer Rouge quickly disintegrated. Most of its remaining forces retreated to the Thai-Cambodian border, where they established long-term bases and maintained control over border areas for the next decade. Small remnants continued to engage in guerrilla warfare. By late 1979, the Khmer Rouge reorganized its armed groups into the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea, built from what remained of the Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea.\nDespite this, the weaknesses of the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) led to its complete dependence on Vietnam—a country that had just emerged from two major wars, was now engaged in two border conflicts, and was struggling with a devastated economy.\nVietnam's intervention to destroy the Khmer Rouge triggered strong reactions from its adversaries. China, the United States, and ASEAN nations backed the formation of a Cambodian government-in-exile and the military alliance known as the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK), which included the Khmer Rouge, the Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF), and the royalist ANS (Armee Nationale Sihanoukiste). However, the Khmer Rouge remained the dominant military force within this three-party coalition, playing the leading role in prolonging the conflict against the Vietnam-backed Phnom Penh government for a decade.\nDuring this period, the Khmer Rouge continued to receive foreign support from China, the United States, Thailand, and other countries hostile to Vietnam. However, this support was only enough to sustain its resistance—it was unable to regain its former strength. At its peak, the Khmer Rouge controlled around 20% of Cambodia's territory but only 5% of the population, compared to the Vietnam-backed Phnom Penh government.\nCollapse\nWith Vietnam's full support, the People's Republic of Kampuchea gradually consolidated its control over the country. It also actively pursued diplomatic measures to isolate the Khmer Rouge, including reconciliation with other Cambodian exile factions.\nIn 1989, Vietnam withdrew its troops from Cambodia after securing the Phnom Penh government's stability and military strength. Peace negotiations led to the establishment of a coalition government for a constitutional monarchy with a multi-party system and democratic freedoms.\nAs the Khmer Rouge refused to compromise, it became increasingly isolated. Although it continued military operations, boycotted elections, and rejected the results, it now faced opposition from Cambodia's new coalition government. This government included not only former Vietnamese-backed communists, led by Hun Sen, but also ex-Khmer Rouge allies, including non-communist and royalist factions such as Prince Norodom Ranariddh's forces.\nDeprived of food supplies, trade goods, and international aid, the Khmer Rouge was forced into self-sufficiency. It had to abandon refugee camps, where international humanitarian aid had previously provided medicine and food. Public morale within Khmer Rouge-controlled areas collapsed.\nAfter Pol Pot's death in April 1998, the Khmer Rouge became a spent force, barely surviving. By late 1999, its last remaining commanders and soldiers surrendered to the Cambodian government, marking the final end of the Khmer Rouge.\nGenocide\nOrganization\nRevolutionary Army of Kampuchea\nThe Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea was the official name of the army of Democratic Kampuchea during the period of 1975 to 1979, mainly consisting of Khmer Rouge operatives. In 1979 during the Cambodian–Vietnamese War it was reformed into the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea to continue to fight against the People's Army of Vietnam and the new Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Armed Forces.\nRevolutionary Navy of Kampuchea\nThe Revolutionary Navy of Kampuchea (, LNK) under the new Khmer Rouge regime had a backbone force of 17 American-made Swift class patrol boats (seven of which were sunk in May 1975 by U.S. air attack during the Mayaguez incident). Additionally the Navy also possessed 2 submarine chasers E311 and E312 (PC-461-class), 3 LCUs and 1 LCM and a number of small river boats.\nAir Force of the Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea\nThe Air Force of the Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea (, AFLAK) was mainly defunct for the time that Democratic Kampuchea existed. Many aircraft were captured from Khmer Air Force including many western types. During the Mayaguez incident 5 T-28 Trojan aircraft were destroyed. All aircraft were destroyed or captured in 1979 during the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia.\nEquipment\nInfantry weapons\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Origin\n!Notes\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | Semi-automatic pistols\n|-\n|TT pistol\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|rowspan=\"2\" |Supplied by North Vietnam during the Cambodian Civil War.\n|-\n|Makarov pistol\n|-\n|Type 54 pistol\n|\n|Supplied by China during and after the Cambodian Civil War.\n|-\n!
