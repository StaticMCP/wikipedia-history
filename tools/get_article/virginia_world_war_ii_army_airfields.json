However the other USAAF support commands (Air Technical Service Command (ATSC); Air Transport Command (ATC) or Troop Carrier Command) commanded a significant number of airfields in a support roles.\nIt is still possible to find remnants of these wartime airfields. Many were converted into municipal airports, some were returned to agriculture and several were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.\nMajor airfields\nAir Technical Service Command\n* Blackstone AAF, Blackstone\n: Supported Fort Pickett\n: Now:  Allen C Perkinson Airport/Blackstone Army Airfield\nArmy Air Force Training Command\n* Langley Field AAF, Hampton Was also a part of First Air Force\n: 2d Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Eastern Technical Training Center\n: Now:  Joint Base Langley-Eustis (1947-Pres)\nFirst Air Force\n* Norfolk AAF, Norfolk\n: 390th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Now: Norfolk International Airport\n* Richmond AAF, Richmond\n: 428th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Now: Byrd Field/Richmond International Airport\nReferences\n* Maurer, Maurer (1983).
