It was decommissioned in 2004 and in 2005 bought by the restaurant next door for parties, meetings, and congresses.\nOostwold was home to 254 people in 1840.\nGallery\nFile:Hoofdstraat Oostwold (Westerkwartier).jpg|Main street\nFile:MFC De Gaveborg Oostwold (Westerkwartier).jpg|Sports centre\nFile:Voormalige christelijke basisschool Oostwold (Westerkwartier).jpg|Former school\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
