It has a length of ; its headwaters rises at an elevation of  and meets its confluence at the Delaware River's 173.1 River Mile at an elevation of  for a total elevation drop of  which give Rodges Run a slope of 202.27 feet per mile (19.8 meters per kilometer).\nCourse\nRodges Run rises near the center of Durham Township east of Lehnenberg, and runs generally east northeast, then skirts south and east around an elevation before it drains into the Pennsylvania Canal (Delaware Division).\nGeology\nRodges Run rises in a bed of Hornblende Gneiss laid down during the Precambrian, the hornblende is mixed in with labradorite, the grains are about 1 to 2&nbsp;mm in diameter. Then it moves into a bed of the Leithsville Formation consisting of dolomite, calcareous shale, and chert.\nCrossings and Bridges\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Crossing !! NBI Number !! Length !!
