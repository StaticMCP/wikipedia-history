The museum, along with the Security Forces Exhibit Annex, are part of the Airman Heritage Training Complex, run by the Air Education and Training Command. Its mission is to preserve and honor the history and heritage of enlisted airmen.\nHistory\nThe museum opened as the History and Traditions Museum in 1956 as one of 12 satellite museums to the National Museum of the United States Air Force. Museum construction began in 1956 inside a building that dates to 1942, and it opened to the public in February 1957. With the stated purpose of giving basic trainees \"pride in the past\", museum staff arranged exhibits in coordination with Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. They refurbished aircraft on static display to pay tribute to the planes' respective squadrons, crew, and pilots, ensuring correct paint and insignias.\nOn March 5, 1958 the Air Force announced the consolidation of museums at Randolph and Lackland Air Force Bases into the one at Lackland.\nThe History and Traditions Museum annual attendance was over 100,000 in the 1970s. The museum had over 50 aircraft and missiles, a reference library, and miniatures recreating WWII air battles. The engine exhibit contained a Liberty L-6 and L-12 and an Allison V-12 among others.\ntowed from Kelly AFB to Lackland AFB summer 1990|left]]\nThe SR-71A \"Blackbird\" was put on static display in 1990 at the Parade Ground Airpark.\nIn 2010 the museum reopened with a new name—the Airman Heritage Museum.

The research for the exhibit had begun in 2014 at the Air Force Historical Research Agency.\nThe Airman Heritage Foundation continued to raise funds in 2019 for new building set to open in 2022. It is planned to be more accessible, with the entrance outside the base.\nIn 2019 the Airman Heritage Museum had 36,000 visitors and the Security Forces Exhibit Annex had 23,000 visitors.\nIn 2020, nine static aircraft of the Southeast Asia Airpark were moved to make room for construction of new Airman Training Complexes. Aircraft moved to the Parade Ground Airpark included the B-52, F-4, F-5, F-100, B-57, B-66, and F-105. The T-37 and UH-1 were moved to the Inter-American Air Force Academy.
