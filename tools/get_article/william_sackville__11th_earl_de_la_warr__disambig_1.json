He was styled Lord Buckhurst from 1976 until 9 February 1988, when he inherited the earldom.\nEarly life\nThe son of William Sackville, later 10th Earl De La Warr, the young William Sackville was educated at Eton College.\nCareer\nIn 1976, Lord Buckhurst, as he then was, began a financial career in the City of London as an investment banker at Mullens & Co. For 24 years, he was a director of Laing & Cruickshank and later of its owner Credit Lyonnais Securities, for which he worked in equity sales and published a tip sheet called ''The Earl's Earner''. He was later a director of Shore Capital, working with its natural resources team in sales, and also became a director of Cluff Natural Resources. In April 2016, he joined the hedge fund Toscafund Asset Management as a partner.\nBeyond his work in the City of London, De La Warr is a dairy farmer and  was still breeding livestock at his family seat, Buckhurst Park, East Sussex.\nIn 2009, De La Warr began to hire out the library and an adjacent drawing room of Buckhurst Park for weddings, as a way of \"adapting to stay afloat\", in response to Britain's then-current economic crisis. The house and the estate were subsequently made available to the public for corporate events and outdoor pursuits, as well as weddings.\nPersonal life\nIn 1978, De La Warr married Anne Pamela, Countess of Hopetoun. Born Anne Pamela Leveson, she is a granddaughter of Admiral Sir Arthur Cavenagh Leveson and has two sons by her previous marriage to the Marquess of Linlithgow. In 1988 she became Countess De La Warr and is the owner of South Park Stud, which breeds pedigree Shetland ponies on the Buckhurst Park estate.\n:\n* William Herbrand Thomas Sackville, Lord Buckhurst (born 13 June 1979), is a hedge fund manager in the City of London, and heir to the earldom.

For a decade, he undertook to \"resurrect an extinct sausage\" that was a favourite of his childhood. The result became the Buckhurst Park sausage, a product made by Speldhurst Quality Foods, in which De La Warr owned a stake, sold nationally in Waitrose supermarkets.\nIn October 2021, De La Warr bought the original Poohsticks Bridge for some , intending to give it \"pride of place\" in Buckhurst Park but later had to sell it given the high restoration costs.\nSee also\n* Buckhurst Park, Sussex, family seat of the Earls De La Warr\nReferences\n}}"
