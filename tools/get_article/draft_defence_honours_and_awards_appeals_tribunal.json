The Tribunal is established under Part VIIIC of the Defence Act 1903 and commenced as a statutory body on 5 January 2011 after operating administratively from July 2008.\nHistory\nThe Tribunal was created as part of reforms to provide an independent avenue of review for decisions on honours and awards. It operated administratively from July 2008 and was given statutory status by Schedule 1 to the Defence Legislation Amendment Act (No. 1) 2010, with the new Part VIIIC of the Defence Act 1903 commencing on 5 January 2011. In August 2025 the Government introduced the Defence Amendment (Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal) Bill 2025 to amend Tribunal review arrangements.\nFunctions and jurisdiction\nUnder sections 110U to 110XH of the Defence Act 1903 the Tribunal:\n* reviews reviewable decisions concerning eligibility for defence honours, defence awards and foreign awards\n* conducts inquiries into general honours and awards matters referred by the Minister, and makes recommendations\n* is not subject to direction in performing its functions except as provided by the Act and procedural rules, and can independently issue awards.\nThe Tribunal is supported by procedural rules made under section 110XH. Guidance for applicants is published on the Tribunal website.\nReviews and inquiries\nThe Tribunal publishes decisions on reviews and reports of inquiries. In 2022 the Tribunal recommended that the Minister advise the Governor-General to award the Victoria Cross for Australia to Private Richard Norden for actions at Fire Support Base Coral in 1968. Public and media reporting has discussed Tribunal recommendations and government responses.\nGovernance and procedure\nThe Tribunal is not a court. It consists of a chair and other members appointed under the Defence Act 1903. It is supported by a secretariat within the Department of Defence. Tribunal proceedings are conducted in accordance with the Act and the Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal Procedural Rules 2011, including provisions on applications, hearings, evidence and reasons for decisions.\nSee also\n* Australian honours system\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.legislation.gov.au/C1903A00020/latest Defence Act 1903] at the Federal Register of Legislation"
