The state takes its name from Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, a British nobleman and Virginia's first colonial governor, after whom (what is now called) Cape Henlopen was originally named. Delaware is the second smallest state (after Rhode Island). The history of the state's economic and industrial development is closely tied to the impact of the Du Pont family, founder of E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, one of the world's largest chemical companies. Delaware was one of the 13 original states participating in the American Revolution and on December 7, 1787, became the first to ratify the Constitution of the United States.\nGeneral reference\n]]\n* Names\n** Common name: Delaware\n*** Pronunciation:\n** Official name: State of Delaware\n** Abbreviations and name codes\n*** Postal symbol:  DE\n*** ISO 3166-2 code:  US-DE\n*** Internet second-level domain:  .de.us\n** Nicknames\n***Chemical Capital\n***Corporate Capital (due to the state's business-friendly laws)\n*** Diamond State (allusion to the state flag)\n*** Blue Hen State or Blue Hen Chicken State\n*** The First State (Delaware was the first state to ratify the Constitution; currently used on license plates)\n***Home of Tax Free Shopping\n***New Sweden\n***Peach State\n*** Small Wonder\n***Uncle Sam's Pocket Handkerchief\n* Adjectival: Delaware\n* Demonym: Delawarean\nGeography of Delaware\nGeography of Delaware\n* Delaware is: a U.S. state, a federal state of the United States of America\n* Location:\n** Northern Hemisphere\n** Western Hemisphere\n*** Americas\n**** North America\n***** Anglo America\n***** Northern America\n****** United States of America\n******* Contiguous United States\n******** Eastern United States\n********* East Coast of the United States\n********** Northeast megalopolis\n********* Mid-Atlantic states\n********* South Atlantic States\n* Population of Delaware: 897,934 (2010 U.S. Census)\n* Area of Delaware:\n* Atlas of Delaware\nPlaces in Delaware\nPlaces in Delaware\n* Historic places in Delaware\n** National Historic Landmarks in Delaware\n** National Register of Historic Places listings in Delaware\n*** Bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Delaware\n* National Natural Landmarks in Delaware\n* National parks in Delaware: First State National Historical Park.
