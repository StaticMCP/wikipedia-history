Previously, this group of children has often been called \"war children\", a term that is also used for children generally suffering during war and conflict and also child soldiers.\nThe challenges for Children Born of War are distinctly different, although these children might also belong to other categories of war children. It is also worth noting that the term includes all children with the described parentage, regardless of whether the conception was consentual or not.\nThe concept of Children Born of War has been defined by professor doctor Ingvill Constanze Ødegaard (nee Mochmann) in an article in 2006  and 2008 . These articles further development the description of the term presented in a research report by R. Charli Carpenter .\nA more thorough description of the concept and the research on Children Born of War can be found on the research page of the foundation \"The Children Born of War Project\", a NGO working for the rights and protection of CBOW the world over.\nReferences"
