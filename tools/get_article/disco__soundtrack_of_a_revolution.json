The very word hustles you back to the 1970s\", adding, \"“I will survive,” went the song, and if all this series does is get you to listen to Gloria Gaynor again or for the first time, it’ll have been worth it.\"\nThe Guardian said, \"This wonderful series documents the passion and idealism of the 70s music scene. It’s an immaculately soundtracked history lesson – and so much more besides.\"\nThe Financial Times wrote, \"This BBC documentary series is partly a Day-Glo celebration of heady extravagance and irresistible grooves. But it’s also an illuminating and sobering contemporary history that holds a mirror-ball up to 1970s America and its race, sex and gender politics.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
