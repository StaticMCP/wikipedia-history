He stands, wearing an asymmetrical skirt, a leopard's-tooth necklace and a Bell necklace, which would have intimidated enemies and protected the wearer in combat. His left hand wraps around a (now broken) sword, his right carries a rectilinear shield; holes in the center and heel of his feet indicate he may have originally been connected to a larger structure; the top of his face bears marks of Scarification, and he additionally wears a bead cap and necklace.\nCultural Origins\nThough his garb is clearly similar to that worn by Benin warriors depicted in the famous Benin Bronzes, the style of this piece (such as the \"vigorous\" gestures and upward-sweeping loincloth) are uncommon in Benin art. This, combined with the \"rustic\" style suggest it belongs to a separate artistic tradition, which is currently grouped with the \"basket\" Lower Niger Bronze Industries, perhaps also indicating the widespread nature of such cultural traits; it is tentatively suggested to belong to a hybrid Yoruba-Benin culture. The piece is cast bronze.\nSingle-figure plaque, Benin Kingdom court style, Edo peoples, Benin City, Nigeria, mid 16th to 17th century, cast copper alloy - Dallas Museum of Art - DSC04934.jpg|Benin Bronze, kept in Dallas Museum of Art, depicting a similarly clad soldier.\nBenin Bronzes, Horniman Museum.jpg|Benin Bronze, kept in Horniman Museum, depicting a warrior with similar though also quite distinct garments, and pose.\nBenin, edo, figura di un capo.jpg|Benin Bronze Sculpture kept in African art in the Field Museum of Natural History with warrior bearing similar garb.\nBronzen beeld van krijger uit Benin, RP-F-00-9659.jpg\nLower Niger Bronze Industries\nThe Lower Niger Bronze Industries encompass the works produced by multiple distinct cultural traditions, bound primarily by geographic location in the Lower Niger.\nReferences"
