Promoted lieutenant on 16 January 1974, he was subsequently granted a regular commission, and was promoted captain on 12 October 1979 and to major on 31 July 1984.\nMilitary action\nOn 25 November 1987, when Major Ramaswamy Parameswaran was returning from search operation in Sri Lanka, late at night, his column was ambushed by a group of militants which had five rifles. With a cool presence of mind, he encircled the militants from the rear and charged into them, taking them completely by surprise. During the hand-to-hand combat, a militant shot him in the chest. Undaunted, Major Parameswaran snatched the rifle from the militant and shot him dead. Gravely wounded, he continued to give orders and inspired his command till he died. Five militants were killed and three rifles and two rocket launchers were recovered and the ambush was cleared .\nParam Vir Chakra citation\nThe Param Vir Chakra citation on the Official Indian Army Website reads as follows:\nOn 25 November 1987, when Major Ramaswamy Parameswaran was returning from search operation in Sri Lanka, late at night, his column was ambushed by a group of militants. With cool presence of mind, he encircled the militants from the rear and charged into them, taking them completely surprise. During the hand-to-hand combat, a militant shot him in the chest. Undaunted, Major Parameswaran snatched the rifle from the militant and shot him dead. Gravely wounded, he continued to give orders and inspired his command till he breathed his last. Five militants were killed and three rifles and two rocket launchers were recovered and the ambush was cleared.\nMajor Ramaswamy Parameswaran displayed the most conspicuous gallantry and thought nothing of dying at his post.}}\nIPKF Memorial error\nOn 15 August 2012, R.K. Radhakrishnan, Colombo correspondent of The Hindu reported a glaring error on the IPKF transcription :\n\"The inscription read: IC 32907F MAJ. P.RAMASWAMY MVC 25 NOV 1987 8 MAHAR.\nMVC stands for Maha Vir Chakra, India's second highest military decoration. No one seemed to have noticed the mistake before. As I stood there, it crossed my mind that there was no guarantee that the names and honours of the other 1200 soldiers inscribed on the stone were all correct. Since Independence, only 21 Indians have had the honour of having PVC suffixed to their names. Parameshwaran was the only IPKF soldier who was given that honour. He is also the lone Mahar Regiment soldier to be conferred the PVC, the highest military decoration of India. That must mean a lot to a regiment active since 1941.\"\nNaming of an apartment\nThe Army Welfare Housing Organization (AWHO)  built a colony in Arcot Road Chennai and named it as A.W.H.O Parameshwaran Vihar in the year 1998 in honor of Major Ramaswamy Parameswaran.\n, New Delhi]]\nSee also\n*Indian Army\n*Param Vir Chakra\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
