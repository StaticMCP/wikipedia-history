It was originally a commercial (shareware) program, but with the dominance of Apple's iTunes, development was halted and it was released as freeware. It was retired on November 11, 2004.\nIn January 2021, an updated, stripped–down version was released for macOS 10.12.\nDesign\nOne of the features of Audion that set it apart from its rivals, particularly SoundJam, was its user interface, which featured transparency through a process that mimicked the functionality of alpha channels on Mac OS 9's QuickDraw, a graphics system that did not support them.\nHistory\nCabel Sasser has written that he and Steven Frank had one goal with Audion: \"We wanted to listen to our music CDs on our computers while we worked, and we wanted it to be stylish.\" During Audion's development, MP3 files became a popular means of listening to music on a computer, and Panic licensed an MP3 decoder for incorporation into Audion.\nAudion was originally conceived as one piece in a set of small applications to be called PanicPack, but time constraints led to the release of Audion 1.0 as standalone application on August 16, 1999.\nAudion became known for its MP3 decoder, which was reputed to produce sound with superior fidelity. Sasser said this was an accident, and that he and Frank have no idea how they achieved this.\nApple tried to meet with Cabel and Steven to hire them to create the original version of iTunes based on their work on Audion. The meeting never took place, and Apple instead acquired Audion rival SoundJam MP as the basis for iTunes.\nAudion was retired on November 11, 2004. The final version was 3.0.2, released on August 22, 2002.\nIn March 2020, Panic announced they would be updating hundreds of Audion's unique \"faces,\" or skins, to work with modern versions of macOS. On January 6, 2021, Panic released a stripped-down version of the player for macOS 10.12, with over 860 faces available.\nSee also\n* Comparison of audio player software\nReferences"
