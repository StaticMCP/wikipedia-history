The Portuguese military, led by Major João José da Cunha Fidié, was tasked with suppressing these separatist movements.\nAfter abandoning Parnaíba due to increasing resistance, Fidié launched a campaign to retake Oeiras, the provincial capital. On February 28, 1823, during his march from Parnaíba, Fidié's forces encountered a small contingent of 40-50 rebels positioned near the Lagoa do Jacaré. The rebels aimed to delay Fidié's advance and prevent his forces from regrouping and attacking the more significant resistance movements in Oeiras and Campo Maior.\nBattle\nThe rebels took up defensive positions along the shores of Jacaré. Their goal was to delay Fidié's advances, hoping to block their superior forces, however, the rebels were quickly overwhelmed. Fidié's troops inflicted heavy losses on the rebel contingent, scattering the defenders.\nAftermath\nAfter the victory, Fidié's troops continued their march toward Piracuruca and Campo Maior without significant delay. And 2 days later, Fidié would once again fight at the banks of the Jenipapo River.\nReferences\n*\n*\n*"
