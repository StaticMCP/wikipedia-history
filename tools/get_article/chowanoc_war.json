For two years, the Chowanoc fought with the forces of Peter Jenkins, commander of the colony's army. In the summer of 1677, the colony won, and the Chowanoc were forcibly moved to modern-day Gates County.\nBackground\nIn 1662, the first permanent English settlers occupied the area north of Albemarle County, which became a part of the Province of Carolina. The Chowanoc Native Americans were living in northern Ablemarle County, on their ancestral home on the Meherrin River; in the county, the Chowanoc, Pasquotank, Poteskeet, and Yeopim had a combined population of 200. The population was strong enough to have turned the English settlers away, but the two groups made a peace treaty in 1663. In 1670, Peter Jenkins was promoted lieutenant colonel of the Albemarle colony's army. Around 1675, the other Native Americans living in the region convinced the Chowanoc to attack the English, as the English were attacking the Natives in the area. The English in Ablemarle County hadn't experienced violence since possibly 1666.\nCourse of the war\nIn 1675, the Chowanoc attacked the English, disregarding the 1663 treaty. The English forces were commanded by Peter Jenkins. Both sides suffered heavy losses. The settlers lived in their \"isolated homesteads\" in constant fear of attack, which made settler travel in the area difficult. However, they had the strength of guns. The war dragged on for two years, when in 1677, a ship arrived carrying arms and ammunition for the English. In the summer of 1677, the colony won, which was a \"crushing defeat\" for the Chowanoc. The tribe was moved from the Meherrin River to a reservation on Bennett's Creek, in modern-day Gates County.\nReferences\nSources\n*Powell, William S. (1988).
