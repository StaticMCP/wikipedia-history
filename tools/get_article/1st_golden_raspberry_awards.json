Wilson's living room alcove to recognize the worst the film industry had to offer in 1980. For it was a double feature of ''Can't Stop the Music, winner of Worst Picture, and Xanadu'' that inspired Wilson to start the Razzies. Each category included as many as ten nominees; the maximum was lowered to five the following year to mirror the Oscars. \"There was a fake stage in John's apartment,\" remembers Maureen Murphy, who was a presenter.\nWinners and nominees\n, Worst Director winner]]\n, Worst Actor winner]]\n, Worst Supporting Actor co-winner]]\n, Worst Supporting Actress winner]]\n, Worst Screenplay co-winner]]\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n* 'Can't Stop the Music'\n** Cruising\n** The Formula\n** Friday the 13th\n** The Jazz Singer\n** The Nude Bomb\n** Raise the Titanic\n** Saturn 3\n** Windows\n** Xanadu\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n* 'Robert Greenwald&nbsp;– Xanadu'\n** John G.

In 2022, Razzies founder John J. B. Wilson admitted that he regrets the nomination, saying: \"Knowing the backstory and the way that Stanley Kubrick kind of pulverized her, I would take that back.\" That same year, the awards committee rescinded Duvall's nomination, but not Kubrick's. The nominations for Brian De Palma's Dressed to Kill have also been criticized.\nSee also\n* 53rd Academy Awards\n* 38th Golden Globe Awards\n* 34th British Academy Film Awards\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131104113243/https://razzies.com/asp/content/XcNewsPlus.asp?cmd=view&articleid=20 Official summary of awards]\n* [https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Razzie_Awards/1981 Nomination and award listing]  at IMDb"
