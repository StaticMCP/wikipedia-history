He has contributed to publications including National Geographic, Rock & Ice and Alpinist. Mills was one of the creative minds behind An American Ascent, a documentary chronicling the first all African American ascent of Denali, North America's highest peak.\nBiography\nMills grew up in Los Angeles, California. He developed an interest in the outdoors through his participation in a local Boy Scout troop. He received a bachelor's degree in anthropology from the University of California, Berkeley. Subsequently, Mills started an outdoor focused career in 1989, spending time as a guide, outfitter, independent sales representative, writer, and photographer.\nIn 2009, Mills founded \"The Joy Trip Project\", a news gathering and reporting  organization that covers business, art and culture of the outdoor recreation industry. Through the blog and podcast, Mills covers the people and culture within the industry and unearths buried stories, particularly of adventurers of color.\nIn 2013, alongside Aparna Rajagopal-Durbin and Jeanne O’Brian of the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS), Mills helped organize Expedition Denali, the first all African American expedition to successfully summit Denali, North America's highest peak. A documentary about the Denali expedition entitled: An American Ascent was subsequently produced. Mills acted as a cowriter and coproducer on this production.\nIn 2014, Mills authored The Adventure Gap: Changing the Face of the Outdoors, which recounts Expedition Denali and explores the difficulties minorities face when seeking to utilize the nation's outdoor resources. It additionally highlights role models who found ways to participate in outdoor recreation despite these barriers.\nMills is a faculty assistant at the University of Wisconsin Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies. He teaches a summer course for undergraduate students on diversity, equity and inclusion in outdoor recreation and public management called \"Outdoors for All.\"\nAwards & honors\n* National Geographic Explorer (2023)\n* Paul K.
