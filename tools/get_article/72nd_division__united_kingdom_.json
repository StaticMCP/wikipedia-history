It served in the Home Defence forces and never went overseas.\nHome defence\nOn the outbreak of World War I the Territorial Force (TF) immediately mobilised for home defence, but shortly afterwards (31 August 1914), its units were authorised to raise 2nd battalions formed from those men who had not volunteered for, or were not fit for, overseas service, together with new volunteers, while the 1st Line went overseas to supplement the Regulars. Early in 1915 the 2nd Line TF battalions were also raised to full strength to form new divisions, and began to form Reserve (3rd Line) units to supply drafts. The remaining Home Service men were separated out in May 1915 to form brigades of Coast Defence Battalions (termed Provisional Battalions from June 1915).\n8th Provisional Brigade\n8th Provisional Brigade was formed mainly from details of regiments from the English Midlands. Brigadier-General Willoughby Thuillier assumed command on 8 September 1915 and established his headquarters at Westcliff-on-Sea, later moving to Southminster. By July 1916 the brigade was under the control of Northern Army of Home Forces, with the following units billeted across Essex:\n* Brigade Headquarters: Maldon\n* 8th Provisional Yeomanry Squadron\n* 8th Provisional Cyclist Company\n* 8th Provisional Battery Royal Field Artillery at Southminster\n* 8th Provisional Brigade Ammunition Column RFA\n* 8th Provisional Field Company Royal Engineers at Southminster\n* 8th Provisional Signal Section RE at Maldon\n* 28th Provisional Battalion (formed from home service details of 2/4th and 2/5th Battalions, Leicestershire Regiment, 2/4th and 2/5th Lincolnshire Regiment, and 2/5th and 2/6th Battalions South Staffordshire Regiment) at Tillingham\n* 70th Provisional Battalion (formed from home service details of 5th and 6th Battalions, East Surrey Regiment) at Burnham-on-Crouch\n* 81st Provisional Battalion (formed from home service details of 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th Bns, Royal Warwickshire Regiment) at Asheldham, later Southminster\n* 83rd Provisional Battalion (formed from home service details of the 5th Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment, 4th Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry and 4th Battalion, Royal Berkshire Regiment) at West Mersea\n* 8th Provisional Field Ambulance Royal Army Medical Corps at Burnham\n* 8th Provisional Brigade Train Army Service Corps (from North Midland Divisional Train) at Southminster\nThe following were also attached to 8th Provisional Bde:\n* 1/8th (Cyclist) Battalion, Essex Regiment (until October 1918)\n* 2/3rd Warwickshire Battery, Royal Field Artillery (from October 1915)\n72nd Division formed\nLate in 1916 the War Office decided to form three new home-service divisions and 72nd was the second of these, assembling in Somerset in November. The division was based on 8th Provisional Bde, which moved from Essex and provided four infantry battalions and many of the support units. (On 1 January 1917 these all received new designations and numbers.) In addition, 188th (2/1st Northumberland) Brigade, left over after the earlier disbandment of 63rd (2nd Northumbrian) Division, provided three battalions which joined 72nd Division. 65th (2nd Lowland) Division, 67th (2nd Home Counties) Division and 68th (2nd Welsh) Division provided the personnel for five artillery batteries, while Northern Command and Northern and Southern Armies each loaned a section of guns each until equipment could be issued to the new units. The division had the following composition:\nStaff\n* General Officer Commanding: Major-General F.S. Inglefield (3 November 1916 – 6 September 1917)Maj-Gen G.J.

In May 1917 the 72nd moved again, to East Anglia With its HQ at Ipswich, the division formed part of Southern Army of Home Forces, and was responsible for the coastal defences from the River Deben to Orford Ness. The division remained here for the remainder of its service.\nThe Military Service Act 1916 swept away the Home/Foreign service distinction, and all TF soldiers became liable for overseas service, if medically fit. Henceforth part of the role of the Home Service divisions was physical conditioning to render men fit for drafting overseas, alongside units of the Training Reserve. 'Graduated Battalions' of the Training Reserve were organised in four companies according to age, from 18 to 19 years. Recruits progressed from one to another company every three months, so that every three months there was a company of trained 19-year-old men available for drafting overseas. In July 1917 it was decided that the Graduated Battalions could serve in a Home Defence role while completing their training. Between July and September 1917, six Graduated Battalions replaced other units in 72nd Division, and in October these were affiliated to line regiments and adopted territorial designations.\nDisbandment\nDuring October 1917 the War Office decided to break up the three home service divisions. A number of battalions of 72nd Division were disbanded, and on 21 December the War Office ordered the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, to break up the remainder of the division without delay. The Graduated Battalions transferred to other divisions and between January and April 1918 the remainder of the headquarters and supporting units were broken up.\nThe 72nd Division title has never been reactivated.\nSee also\n*List of British divisions in World War I\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Maj A.F.
