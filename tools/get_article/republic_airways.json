It is headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana.\nHistory\nwith US Airways Express titles]]\nIn 1999, Republic Airways Holdings incorporated a new subsidiary, \"Republic Airline, Inc.\" but the subsidiary had no activity prior to 2004 and no ability to operate aircraft prior to 2005. In 2004 the holding company activated Republic Airways in reaction to a pilots' suit against American Airlines.\nAmerican had awarded the flying of 44-seat regional jets to Chautauqua Airlines, then the main operating subsidiary of Republic Airways Holdings. However, Chautauqua later started to operate 70-seat regional jets on behalf of United Airlines, and this caused American to be in violation of its pilot union scope clause, which prevented an airline from operating on behalf of American if that airline was operating jet aircraft of more than 50 seats, even if such aircraft were operating on behalf of a carrier other than American. To repair the situation, Republic Airways Holdings activated Republic Airline, and upon Part 121 certification in 2005 allowing Republic Airline to operate commercial service. Republic Airways Holdings then transferred the offending 70-seat regional jets from Chautauqua to Republic Airline. American was then no longer in violation of its pilot union scope clause. Republic Airways Holdings paid $6.6 million to the pilot union of American Airlines to settle the issue.\nUS Airways' pilots had a scope clause prohibiting the airline from operating large regional jets such as the Embraer E170. The airline negotiated around this clause by offering flight deck jobs to laid-off US Airways pilots, in a program known as \"Jets for Jobs\". This agreement created a subsidiary, MidAtlantic Airways. As part of US Airways' bankruptcy restructuring, the 25 Embraer E170s delivered to MidAtlantic were bought by Republic to help US Airways come out of bankruptcy; Republic operates them along with additional newly delivered aircraft.\nIn 2007, Frontier Airlines signed an 11-year service agreement with Republic Airways. Under the agreement, Republic would operate 17 Embraer E170 aircraft for Frontier. The first aircraft was placed into service in March 2007, and the last aircraft was expected to be placed into service by December 2008. On April 23, 2008, Republic Airways Holdings (parent of Republic Airline) terminated its service agreement with Frontier Airlines, which entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy in early April 2008. Subsequently, Republic Air Holdings purchased Frontier Airlines in bankruptcy. Frontier-branded Republic Airways E190 aircraft provided regional capacity support. In September 2013, Republic Airways Holdings sold Frontier Airlines. As part of the sale, Republic Airways negotiated a provision that prevented the Frontier-branded E190s from being flown.\nOn February 1, 2008, Republic Airways opened a base at John Glenn Columbus International Airport in Columbus, Ohio.\nOn September 3, 2008, Republic signed a new 10-year codeshare agreement with Midwest Airlines. The aircraft would be based at Kansas City International Airport beginning October 1, 2008. Twelve aircraft would be placed in service with Midwest. On June 23, 2009, Republic announced it would acquire Midwest Airlines for $31 million.\nIn January 2013, Republic Airways Holdings reached a capacity purchase agreement with American Airlines to operate Embraer E175 airplanes under the American Eagle brand beginning in mid-2013. Republic began service as an American Eagle affiliate on August 1, 2013, from Chicago to New Orleans, Pittsburgh, and Albuquerque.\nOn February 25, 2016, the airline filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The airline was hit hard because of pilot shortages, but a new contract ratified in October 2015 helped restructure the airline. At the time of filing, Republic Holdings claimed $2.97 billion in liabilities and $3.56 billion in assets. On November 16, 2016, Republic Airways Holdings filed their reorganization plan, with the intention to emerge from Chapter 11 during the first quarter of 2017.\nIt was announced that parent company Republic Airways Holdings would merge subsidiaries Shuttle America and Republic Airways into one company, with Republic Airways being chosen as the surviving company. On January 31, 2017, Shuttle America merged with Republic Airways. In December 2018, the operating division was renamed Republic Airways to match its parent company.\nAs of January 31, 2017, Republic Airways has the largest fleet of Embraer E170 and Embraer E175 aircraft in the world.\nOn September 21, 2021, Republic Airways announced it will move its corporate headquarters to Carmel, Indiana. The future headquarters and training facility will be a $200 million project and is set to open in January 2026.\nMerger with Mesa Airlines\nOn April 7, 2025, Republic Airways Holdings announced that it would acquire Mesa Airlines in an all-stock merger. Under the terms of the agreement, Republic shareholders will own approximately 88% of the merged company, while Mesa shareholders will retain between 6% and 12%. The merger is expected to close in the third or fourth quarter of 2025, pending approval from shareholders and regulators.\nFollowing the merger, the combined company will operate approximately 310 Embraer 170/175 aircraft and more than 1,250 daily departures. Republic will continue operating under agreements with American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines, while Mesa will fly under a 10-year agreement with United.\nPrior to the merger, Mesa had scaled back its operations to about 60 Embraer 175 aircraft, all of which were leased from United. The merger would leave Republic and SkyWest Airlines as the two largest remaining independent regional airlines in the United States.\nDestinations\n, Republic operates the following routes for American Eagle, Delta Connection, and United Express.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+\nList of destinations\n|-\n!

Total orders were for 36 aircraft, which were operated in an 80-seat configuration under the US Airways Express brand name.\nIn July 2010, Republic ordered a further 24 Embraer 190 aircraft.\nIn May 2012, Republic Airways agreed to fly the 28 Bombardier Q400s for United Express that bankrupt Pinnacle Airlines planned to return to its lessors. The Q400 fleet was retired in 2017.\nRepublic Airways Holdings signed a three-year contract in October 2012 with Caesars Entertainment Corporation where its Republic Airways subsidiary would operate five Embraer 190 aircraft to provide more than 1,500 charter flights annually for Caesars. Service began in January 2013. This contract ended in August 2015 and all E190 aircraft were sold or returned to the lease holders.\nIn January 2013, Republic Airways Holdings reached a capacity purchase agreement with American Airlines to operate 47 Embraer 175 airplanes under the American Eagle brand beginning in mid-2013. The regional jets would be deployed out of American's Chicago hub. In addition, Republic would have options to purchase an additional 47 Embraer aircraft beginning in 2015. Republic took first delivery of the E175 jets in July 2013 and service began August 1, 2013, from Chicago to New Orleans, Pittsburgh and Albuquerque. Republic began using Miami as an American Eagle hub in October 2014 and in New York-JFK in May 2015.\nIn late 2015, it was announced Republic Airways achieved approval from the FAA for Extended Overwater Operations (EOW), which allows Republic to operate up to 162 nautical miles from shore. As of January 31, 2017, only Republic 175 aircraft operating for American Airlines are equipped to operate as an EOW aircraft. American Airlines uses Republic to operate aircraft out of Miami International Airport to various Caribbean and Central American destinations, including the Bahamas, Mexico, Panama, Belize, Honduras, Costa Rica, Turks & Caicos, Cuba, Guadeloupe, and the French West Indies.\nIn late 2016, it was announced, due to the impending merger with Shuttle America, that the 80-seat Embraer 175s operated for American Eagle (previously US Airways Express) would have the last row of seats removed (4 in total) to conform with Delta's scope clause, which limits all regional jets to a maximum of 76 seats. These aircraft were retrofitted to American's standard Embraer 175 layout.\nOn January 31, 2017, all existing aircraft operating under the Shuttle America operating certificate were transferred to the Republic Airline Inc. operating certificate, thus ceasing operations for Shuttle America, and completing the merger process of both subsidiaries. The move made Republic the largest operator of Embraer 170 and Embraer 175 aircraft in the world, at the time.\nOn December 20, 2018, Republic Airways announced that it had finalized a firm order for 100 Embraer 175 aircraft, stating that deliveries for the new aircraft would start in the second half of 2020\nIn October 2019, Republic received the first of 30 E175s to be transferred from Compass Airlines upon the cancellation of their contract with Delta.\nIn September 2021, Republic agreed to sell 11 E170s and 6 E175s to Envoy Air.\nRetired fleet\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Republic Airways retired fleet\n|-\n!Aircraft\n!Total\n!Introduced\n!Retired\n!Notes\n|-\n|BAe Jetstream 31\n|19\n|1995\n|2001\n|Operated for Northwest Airlink.\n|-\n|Bombardier CRJ-200\n|24\n|2006\n|2010\n|Operated for Continental Express.\n|-\n|Bombardier Q300\n|6\n|1998\n|2002\n|Operated for United Express.\n|-\n|Bombardier Q400\n|30\n|2012\n|2016\n|Operated for United Express.\n|-\n|Embraer ERJ-135\n|22\n|2002\n|2009\n|Operated for Delta Connection.\n|-\n|Embraer ERJ-140\n|15\n|2001\n|2014\n|Operated for American Eagle.\n|-\n|Embraer ERJ-145\n|68\n|2015\n|2021\n|Operated for Delta Connection.\n|-\n|Embraer E190\n|17\n|2009\n|2015\n|Operated for Frontier Airlines and Midwest Airlines.\n|}\nIncidents\n* On April 9, 2017, a passenger was forced off of a Republic-operated United Express flight in Chicago bound for Louisville. The passenger was forced off the flight by Department of Aviation officers after he refused to give up his seat to an airline employee. He attempted to run back onto the aircraft, but was forcibly removed. A video posted on social media showing him being injured and dragged off the plane led to a public outcry against United Airlines.\n* On June 21, 2018, a Republic-owned E170 registered N876RW was damaged by a fire while undergoing maintenance at John Glenn Columbus International Airport. The aircraft was deemed to be damaged beyond economical repair.\n* On May 10, 2019, a Republic-owned E175 operating Delta Connection flight 5935 was heading towards New York's LaGuardia Airport when a suicidal passenger attempted to open a cabin door in mid-flight, causing the pilots to declare an emergency shortly before landing. The situation was brought under control, after which the plane landed safely and was met by law enforcement at the gate.\n*On November 6, 2019, a Republic-owned E175 operating American Eagle Flight 4439 returned to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport after suffering severe controllability issues after takeoff: ATC flight data recorded the crew stating a \"trim runaway\" and a \"stalling situation\". The data shows the aircraft rapidly climbing to 15,100&nbsp;ft (4,600 m) and slowing down to 160 knots (300&nbsp;km/h) while performing nearly two full right turns.\n* On June 4, 2022, a Republic-owned E175 operating American Eagle Flight 4837 from Indianapolis bound for Chicago-O'Hare, aborted its takeoff after an odor of smoke was reported in the aircraft. The aircraft was evacuated on a taxiway. No injuries were reported.\n*On June 29, 2025, a Republic-owned E175 was involved in a ground incident at Boston Logan International Airport. A catering van operated by Sky Chefs Collided with the parked aircraft. The van was crushed and visible damage was seen on the aircraft's underbelly. The aircraft was unoccupied at the time and the van driver sustained only minor injuries.\nSee also\n* Air transportation in the United States\n* Regional airline\n* American Eagle\n* United Express\n* Delta Connection\n* Delta Shuttle\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
