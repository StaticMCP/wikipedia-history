Named for silent film director Pedro Sienna, they were given for the first time in 2006. Outstanding artists are awarded for the development and strengthening of national audiovisual media and the best works, artists, and technicians of the production of works released in the country between January and December of the previous year.\nThey came about as a result of Law No. 19.981 of 2005 that created the Council of the Art and Audiovisual Industry (CAIA) and the Audiovisual Promotion Fund, both under the National Council of Culture and the Arts (CNCA).\nPedro Sienna was one of the forerunners of Chilean cinema, directing El Húsar de la Muerte (1925) and winning the National Prize for Art in 1966.\nThe aim of the awards is to recognize an author, artist, technician, or producer who stands out for their artistic quality or projection of their audiovisual work and the relevant activities of dissemination and preservation of audiovisual production.\nExcept for the Career award, given by the CAIA, the awards are granted by a jury. Two pre-selection committees choose the nominees in the categories for feature films and short films.\nAll winners receive the Pedro Sienna sculpture. It was created by , an outstanding sculptor, and inspired by the lens of a camera. It is made of stainless steel with a base of black granite.\nCeremony format\nBeginning with their first edition, the Pedro Sienna Awards were handed out at the end of each year to reward the best of that year. However, in 2016 it was decided to move the awards ceremony to the middle of the year, modifying the period of the release dates of the films that are eligible. That is, beginning with the 10th edition, the awards celebrate the best of the previous year. So although there is no version called 2015 Pedro Sienna Awards, strictly speaking, the films released that year were awarded in 2016.\nSummary of winners\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 auto; font-size: 90%; text-align: center\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:25px;\"|Edition\n! style=\"width:225px;\"|Date\n! style=\"width:225px;\"|Best Picture\n! style=\"width:200px;\"|Best Director\n! style=\"width:200px;\"|Best Actor\n! style=\"width:200px;\"|Best Actress\n! style=\"width:250px;\"|Location\n! style=\"width:190px;\"|Presenter\n|-\n| 1st ||31 Jan 2006 || Play || Alicia Scherson ||  || Blanca Lewin || ,Santiago || Esperanza Silva\n|-\n| 2nd ||31 Jan 2007 ||  || Sebastián Lelio || Jaime Vadell || Patricia López || ,Santiago ||\n|-\n| 3rd ||31 Jan 2008 || Life Kills Me|| Pachi BustosJorge Leiva || Daniel Muñoz || Marcela Osorio || ,Santiago ||\n|-\n| 4th ||31 Mar 2009 || The Good Life || Andrés Wood || Alfredo Castro || Aline Kuppenheim || ,Santiago || Javiera Contador\n|-\n| 5th ||1 Sept 2010 || The Maid || Sebastián Silva || Eduardo Paxeco || Catalina Saavedra || ,Santiago || Blanca Lewin\n|-\n| 6th ||25 Nov 2011 || Violeta Went to Heaven || Patricio Guzmán ||  || Francisca Gavilán || Cine Sala Estrella,Punta Arenas || Mariana Loyola\n|-\n| 7th ||9 Nov 2012 || NoMy Last Round || Cristián Jiménez ||  || Bélgica Castro || J.
