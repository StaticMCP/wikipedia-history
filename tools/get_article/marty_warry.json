He went on to play only 8 games and kick 11 goals with the Roys and was known as a forward with an exceptional leap and a touch of flair. One of those goals he kicked was the last one ever scored for the Roys in the AFL, in their Round 22, 1996 game against Fremantle. He booted 4 for the game.\nWarry was drafted by Collingwood signing a 2yr deal following the takeover of Fitzroy's AFL operations by the Brisbane Bears, but quit the club mid-season, due to a lack of opportunities from then coach Tony Shaw.\nExternal links\n*"
