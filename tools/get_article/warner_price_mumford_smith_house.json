It was purchased by Warner Price Mumford Smith and his wife, Augusta Amelia Houser in 1853; the Smiths owned a flour mill and a stagecoach stop. Their son, Robert Edmund Lee Smith, purchased the house in 1909; it was inherited by their daughter Dora Smith Moser in 1967, and by their grandson, Michael F. Moser, in 1991. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since July 22, 1993.\nThe anarchist publisher Ross Winn was married to Augusta \"Gussie\" Smith, and the two lived together in this house from 1900 until Winn's death from tuberculosis in 1912. During this time he published the newspaper ''Winn's Firebrand, and later The Advance'', from this house.\nReferences"
