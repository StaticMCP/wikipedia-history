It was released by Scepter Records on August 31, 1964, in the United States.  Propelled by the hit singles \"Walk On By\", \"You'll Never Get to Heaven\", and \"Wishin' and Hopin'\", it became Warwick's first album to enter the US charts, reaching the top ten of Hot R&B LP's.\nBackground\nMake Way for Dionne Warwick is notable for including the singles \"Walk On By\", Warwick's second top ten hit on the US Billboard Hot 100. Also featured are \"You'll Never Get to Heaven (If You Break My Heart)\", \"A House Is Not a Home\", \"Reach Out for Me\", and one of the first recordings of \"(They Long to Be) Close to You.\" \"Get Rid of Him\" is actually a 1962 track by the Shirelles, with Warwick's vocal replacing that of Shirley Alston. The album was digitally remastered and reissued on CD on November 29, 2011, by Collectables Records.\nCritical reception\n}}\nAllMusic editor Lindsay Planer gave the album three stars out of five. He remarked that while \"Wishin' and Hopin'\" and \"I Smiled Yesterday\" had \"also been included on Warwick's debut album, Presenting Dionne Warwick. However, that didn't seem to deter listeners eager for new tunes. Warwick's musical mentors and collaborators Burt Bacharach and Hal David also presented the singer with several additional compositions that would become signature songs for other performers in the ensuing years.\"\nTrack listing\nAll tracks are written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, except where noted.\n| length2 = 3:22\n| title3 = They Long to Be Close to You\n| writer3 =\n| length3 = 2:23\n| title4 = The Last One to Be Loved\n| writer4 =\n| length4 = 3:20\n| title5 = Land of Make Believe\n| writer5 =\n| length5 = 3:03\n| title6 = Reach Out for Me\n| writer6 =\n| length6 = 2:52\n}}\n]]\n| writer9 =\n| length9 = 2:55\n| title10 = I Smiled Yesterday\n| writer10 =\n| length10 = 2:43\n| title11 = Get Rid of Him\n| writer11 =\n| length11 = 2:34\n| title12 = Make the Night a Little Longer\n| writer12 =\n| length12 = 2:31\n}}\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Chart performance for Make Way for Dionne Warwick\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1964–1965)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Top LP's (Billboard)\n| 68\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Hot R&B LP's (Billboard)\n| 10\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Top 100 Albums (Cash Box)\n| 31\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | US Top 100 LP's (Record World)\n| 23\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.discogs.com/Dionne-Warwick-Make-Way-For-Dionne-Warwick/master/86432 Make Way for Dionne Warwick] at Discogs"
