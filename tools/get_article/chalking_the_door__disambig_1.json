It is normatively in the pattern of four crosses positioned in between the traditional initials of the three wise men, which are surrounded by the first two and last two digits of the current year (e.g. }} ✝ C ✝ M ✝ B ✝ }}). The practice of chalking the door originated in medieval Europe, though it has spread throughout worldwide Christendom.\nEpiphany\nEither on Twelfth Night (5 January), the twelfth day of Christmastide and eve of the feast of the Epiphany, or on Epiphany Day (6 January) itself, many Christians (including Anglicans, Episcopalians, Lutherans, Methodists, Presbyterians and Roman Catholics, among others) write on their doors or lintels with chalk in a pattern such as \"}} ✝ C ✝ M ✝ B ✝ }}\". The numbers in this example refer to the calendar year  and the crosses to Christ. The letters C, M, and B stand for the traditional names of the biblical Magi (Caspar, Melchior and Balthazar), or alternatively for the Latin blessing  ('May Christ bless this house'), or IIIK referring to the three kings .\nChalking the door is done most commonly on Epiphany Day itself. However, it may be done on any day within the Epiphany season. In some localities, the chalk used to write the Epiphanytide pattern is blessed by a Christian priest or minister on Epiphany Day, then taken home to write the pattern.\nThe Christian custom of chalking the door has a biblical precedent as the Israelites in the Old Testament marked their doors in order to be saved from death; likewise, the Epiphanytide practice serves to protect Christian homes from evil spirits until the next Epiphany Day, at which time the custom is repeated. Families also perform this act to represent the hospitality of the Holy Family to the Magi (and all Gentiles); it thus serves as a house blessing to invite the presence of God in one's home., written in blessed chalk.\n:\nThis custom, often accompanied by processions of children accompanied by their parents, expresses the blessing of Christ through the intercession of the three wise men and is an occasion for gathering offerings for charitable and missionary purposes.}}\nIn 20th century Poland, the practice of chalking the door continued among believers as another way of asserting their Christian identity, despite the Eastern Bloc's state atheism and anti-religious campaigns.\nGallery\nFile:Chalked door for Epiphany.jpg|Epiphany season door chalking on an apartment door in Germany\nFile:Epiphany Season door chalking.jpg|Epiphany season door chalking on an apartment door in the Midwestern US\nFile:C+M+B 2009 an der Tür der Villa Reepschlägerbahn 30, Bild 001.JPG|Epiphany season door chalking at the Villa Reepschlägerbahn in Germany\nFile:\"Christ Bless This House\" Chalk Marking on the West Face of the Church of St Michael, Welling.jpg|Epiphany door chalking at the Anglican Church of St Michael in Welling, London\nFile:Sexten Schmiedenstraße 20 008 2019 09 26.jpg|Epiphany door chalking in Sexten, Italy\nFile:Bonifatiuskirche HD Eingang Februar 2012.JPG|Epiphany door chalking in Heidelberg, Germany\nFile:001 2013 09 15 Eingaenge und Tueren.jpg|Epiphany door chalking in Mittelberg, Austria\nFootnotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.ckrec.org/epiphany-door-chalking/ Epiphany Door Chalking] by Christ the King Anglican Church\n*[https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1A7oTUcdPn/ The Chalking of the Doors, Explanative Graphic] by St Andrew's Episcopal Church\n*[http://www.umcdiscipleship.org/resources/an-epiphany-blessing-of-homes-and-chalking-the-door An Epiphany Blessing of Homes and Chalking the Door] by Discipleship Ministries of The United Methodist Church\n*[http://www.carmelites.net/news/chalking-door-epiphany-house-blessing-2015/ Chalking the Door: An Epiphany House Blessing 2016]  by the Roman Catholic Order of Carmelites"
