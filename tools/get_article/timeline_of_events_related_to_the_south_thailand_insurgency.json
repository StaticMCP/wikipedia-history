Most take place in the Muslim–majority, contested provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani, and Yala in the far south of Thailand bordering Muslim Malaysia.\nFor earlier events see History of Thailand.\nTimeline\n1960–1998\nAlthough the conflict was carried out with less intensity, armed resistance in the 1960s and 1970s involved up to 1,500 insurgents.\n1960– The Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN) was founded by Haji Abdul Karim in response to the introduction of a secular curriculum in Pattani's religious boarding schools.\n1968– Patani United Liberation Organisation (PULO) was founded by Tengku Bira Kotanila (alias Kabir Abdul Rahman). PULO became the most powerful insurgent group during the 1960 – 2000 period of the war.\n29 November 1975– Thai marines allegedly murdered five Muslim youths in the Bacho District of Narathiwat Province. The government allegedly failed to conduct a proper investigation into the matter.\n11 December 1975– PULO organised mass protests in response to the event, which were joined by 70,000 Malay Muslims. A bomb was thrown into the crowd killing 12 and injuring at least 30 protesters. The attack was blamed on Buddhist extremists.\nThe government charged and imprisoned the perpetrators and launched an official inquiry and compensated the families of the victims. Despite the fact that the majority of the protesters demands were granted, the event led to an escalation of the insurgency.\nJune 1977– Sabilillah (Path of God) bombed Don Mueang International Airport in Bangkok. In the aftermath of the bombing Sabilillah vanished into obscurity.\nSeptember 1977– Black December 1902 members threw a bomb into a Thai royal ceremony. Five persons were killed and 47 wounded. The royal family managed to escape unharmed.\n1977– Security forces killed BNPP leader Tunku Yala Nasae.\n* Renewed agitation began in the 1990s, led by Malay intellectuals influenced by revolutionary and Islamist ideas from the Middle East. The BRN split into three rival factions, of which the most militant were the BRN Coordinate and the BRN Congress. The BRN Congress is regarded as the most active group, but there are several others, and competition between these militant groups has helped fuel the insurgency. It is believed that there is now a co–ordinating body called the Patani United Liberation Organisation (Dewan Pembebasan Pattani or PULO), although little is known about the composition or leadership of the various groups.\n1993– The New PULO, a dissident faction of the original PULO, was established by Arrong Moo–reng and Hayi Abdul Rohman Bazo.\n1995– Nasoree Saesang founded the GMIP.\nAugust 1996– Thirty–six schools were torched in Yala, Pattani, and Narathiwat allegedly by members of the New PULO faction, reportedly a dissident faction of the original PULO established by Arrong Moo–reng and Hayi Abdul Rohman Bazo. The Thai Interior Ministry and Thai Military Intelligence reported that New PULO used unemployed youth and young drug addicts to carry out its terrorist missions.\n1997– Members of the Barisan Revolusi Nasional Melayu Patani (BRN), PULO and the New PULO established Bersatu, also known as the Patani Malays People's Consultative Council, to improve co–ordination between rebel factions.\nAugust 1997– Bersatu launched an operation code named \"Falling Leaves\". Between August 1997 and January 1998, 33 separate attacks took place resulting in nine deaths.\nJanuary 1998– Malaysia and Thailand launched a joint operation code named \"Pitak Tai\" to crack down on insurgent outfits. Malaysian authorities arrested New PULO's leader, Abdul Rohman Bazo, its military chief, Haji Daoh Thanam, and Bazo's senior assistant, Haji Mae Yala in Kedah, as well as PULO's military commander, Haji Sama–ae Thanam, in Kuala Lumpur, later handing them to Thai authorities. The Thai government also encouraged local people to monitor the movements of drug traffickers and, as a result, the tough policy on drugs deprived PULO of recruits for its acts of terror.\n1999–2002\n* Following the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, leaflets calling for Holy War and support for Osama bin Laden were distributed in Yala by militants.\n24 December 2001– Insurgents launched a number of attacks on police posts in the three provinces. Five police and one defence volunteer were killed.\n* The Thai National Intelligence Agency estimated that fewer than 1,000 armed militants were taking part in the conflict as of 2001. In that year, the Thai Ministry of Interior estimated that 50 insurgency–related incidents had occurred. By 2002, 75 insurgency–linked attacks had killed 50 police and army personnel.\n2003\n* In 2003, officials counted 149 incidents. The mounting scale and sophistication of the insurgency eventually prompted the government into a recognition that there was a serious issue in the southern provinces.\n2004\n4 January– An escalation of the violence in the southern border provinces of Yala, Pattani, and Narathiwat is reckoned to have begun on 4 January 2004 with the raiding of a Thai Army depot.  Unidentified gunmen raided an army ammunition depot in Narathiwat Province in the early morning, and made off with over 400 rifles and ammunition.\n5 January– Two policemen were killed while attempting to defuse a bomb outside a shopping mall in Pattani. A third policeman was injured in bomb blast that occurred in a nearby park. Two more bombs were successfully defused in nearby areas. Prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra declared martial law in the provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani, and Yala.\n22 January– Rebels killed a Buddhist monk.\n12 March– Somchai Neelapaijit, a Thai–Muslim lawyer and human rights activist, was abducted in Ramkhamhaeng, Bangkok. He represented Muslim defendants, who said they had been tortured, in terrorism cases. He was never seen again.\n28 March– A bomb planted by insurgents injured 29 people, including 10 Malaysian tourists.\n30 March– Masked men raided a quarry in the Yala District, stealing a total of 1.6 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, 56 sticks of dynamite, and 176 detonators.\n23 April– Militants killed an army officer and set fire to 50 public buildings in all 13 districts of Narathiwat Province.\n28 April– Militants launched a string of attacks on armouries and army positions in Pattani, Yala, and Songkhla.

During 2004, insurgents began to sow fear in attacks by beheading Buddhists.\n13 November– One man was killed and at least 13 people injured when five bomb blasts occurred in various parts of the region.\n5 December– Thailand airdropped nearly 100 million origami cranes over the southern regions of the country in an effort to bring peace. Militants respond with series of bombings the following day.\n* A total of 400 people were killed in over 1,000 incidents during 2004.\n2005\n17 February– A bomb exploded near a tourist hotel in the town of Sungai Kolok, killing five persons and wounding over 40. Four persons were killed in other incidents.\n3 April– A series of bomb attacks in Songkhla killed two people and leaving 66 injured. The bombings marked the beginning of attacks against ethnic Thai–Chinese–owned businesses who were considered Thaksin supporters and against southern Thailand independence as a Muslim state.\n14 July– A major attack was launched on the provincial capital of Yala city. Sixty militants targeted an area near a hotel, the railway station, two convenience stores and a restaurant roaming the streets using guns, fire–bombs, and explosives.\n18 July– Two militants entered a teashop, shot Lek Pongpla, a Buddhist cloth vendor, beheaded him and left the head outside of the shop.\n19 July– The Thai Prime Minister enacted the \"emergency powers law\" to manage the three troubled states giving himself sweeping powers to direct military operations, suspend civil liberties, and censor the press. Several human rights organisations and local press expressed their concerns that these new powers might be used to violate civil liberty rights. However, the emergency decree was highly popular, with 72 percent of Bangkok residents and 86 percent of people in the three southern provinces supporting it. Nevertheless, the insurgency escalated further.\n31 August– Three bombs exploded almost simultaneously. Subsequently, 131 civilians from the south fled to neighbouring Malaysia seeking refuge from the Thai authorities. Thailand immediately accused the refugees of being insurgents and demanded that they be returned, sparking a diplomatic spat. Currently, the people are still in Malaysia. Thailand, suspecting that insurgents may also have fled with the refugees, has asked Malaysia to return these Thai citizens but Malaysia has refused on humanitarian grounds.\n16 October– A group of 20 separatists attacked a Buddhist monastery, killing three. An extended state of emergency was announced in the three southern provinces plagued by the insurgency. The announcement sparked a large scale guerrilla raid on 60 targets, in which at least seven persons were killed and 90 weapons were stolen.\n16 November– Separatists killed nine civilians and injured nine others.\n* A total of 500 people were killed during 2005.\n2006\n* A brief lull in the insurgency followed the 19 September 2006 coup that overthrew the government of Premier Thaksin Shinawatra. As the Muslim Army Commander Sonthi Boonyaratkalin settled into his role as head of the junta, violence resumed. , more than 1,400 people had died in less than three years of southern violence. Most were innocent bystanders, both Buddhists and Muslims.\n7 January– Four suspected militants fatally shot two border–police at a weekend market in Yala Province.

[https://web.archive.org/web/20070312142250/http://www.manager.co.th/Local/ViewNews.aspx?NewsID=9500000002447 Manager Online, 2007]\n15 June– During the 60th anniversary of the accession of Bhumibol Adulyadej to the Thai throne, well–coordinated bomb–attacks against at least 40 government and official buildings occurred. Two police officials died and 11 others were injured. Experts say that the bomb attacks were a message to the Thai authorities, rather than an attempt to do real damage, as the bombs were loaded with small amounts of explosives. Had the devices been larger, the casualties and injuries would have been notably greater. The Thai media was late in reporting the incident, only doing so after the BBC and other international news services had announced it.\n18 June– Mass graves of about 300 migrant workers were found in southern Thailand.\n27 June– Seven persons including five security personnel were killed in separatist attacks.\n31 August– Twenty–two commercial banks were simultaneously bombed in Yala Province, killing a retired military officer and wounding 24 people. Afterwards, Army chief Sonthi Boonyaratglin announced that he would break with government policy and negotiate with the leaders of the insurgency. However, he noted that \"We still don't know who is the real head of the militants we are fighting with.\" In a press conference the next day, he slammed the government for political interference, and asked that the government \"Free the military and let it do the job.\" By 16 September, the army admitted that it still wasn't sure whom to negotiate with.\nSeptember– Army Commander Sonthi Boonyaratkalin was granted an extraordinary increase in executive powers to combat the unrest.\n16 September– Six remotely detonated motorcycle bombs simultaneously exploded in the 2006 Hat Yai bombings, killing four people and wounding more than sixty.

Sonthi said the army–led multi–agency Southern Border Provinces Peace Building Command would be dissolved and its troops would come under CPM 43, which would operate in parallel with the SBPAC. The SBPAC and CPM 43 had been dissolved in mid–2001 by former Premier Thaksin Shinawatra. Before that, CPM 43 was under the directive of the SBPAC. Sonthi also made himself head of the Internal Security Operations Command (ISOC). Previously, ISOC had been headed by the prime minister.\nISOC was given 5.9 billion baht in funding for fiscal year 2007. By May 2007, General Sonthi asked the government for an additional emergency budget of two billion baht for ISOC, as the normal budget was running out. The money was under the \"secret budget\" category, which meant that state officials could spend it without having to account for it.\n14 January– A rubber tapper named Pin Khotchathin was beheaded in Yala. His head was found at a rubber plantation in Tambon Tasae in Yala's Mueang district five metres from his body. It was the 22nd murder to feature a beheading since May 2004, although the militants were not always successful in removing their victim's head.\nA handwritten note was left near Pin's head warning of further bloodshed to avenge what the attackers, calling themselves Pattani Warriors, claimed was a case of authorities killing separatist members.\nFacing rising violence, Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont accused Muslim junta chief Sonthi Boonyaratkalin of failing to do enough to curb the insurgency.\n18 February– A series of bombings and arson attacks began in Narathiwat, Yala, and Pattani, and Songkhla Provinces. Six people were killed and over 50 were injured.\nViolence escalated though in the months following the implementation of the junta's \"hearts and minds\" campaign. The monthly death toll increased by 30 percent in the five months after the coup compared to the five months before the coup. Insurgents targeted Princess Sirindhorn by placing a bomb near her helicopter's landing pad. A senior aide to Queen Sirikit, Thanpuying Viriya Chavakul, was injured and narrowly escaped death when gunmen attacked her vehicle convoy on 21 February 2007 in Yala. She later criticised the government for rotating troops too often, preventing them from building bonds with locals. She also made note of troops' lack of communications equipment and bulletproof vests.\nAfter an official visit to Thailand, Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi volunteered to act as a mediator in arranging talks between insurgents and Thai authorities. Foreign Minister Nitya Pibulsonggram rejected the offer.\nDuring the Chinese New Year weekend (from the evening of 18 February 2007 to the afternoon of 19 February 2007), insurgents executed 38 bombing attacks, 26 cases of arson, and seven ambushes.

Aree later admitted that the government's southern strategy was flawed.\n21 February– In their most significant act of economic terrorism and arson to date, insurgents burned down the Southland Rubber warehouse in Yala, destroying 5,000 tons of rubber worth approximately 400 million baht and engulfing Yala city in a dense cloud of black smoke for 12 hours. Thirty fire trucks fought to control the flames in the largest rubber warehouse in the deep south. Spikes were scattered on the road leading to the warehouse to slow emergency workers. No casualties were reported.\nMarch– The junta's top security advisor admitted that insurgents imported their techniques from Al–Qaeda and the Taliban and were motivated by not only by nationalist reasons, like previous generations of insurgents, but religious extremism as well. However, it noted that it still did not know who was behind the insurgency.\nTo protect the Buddhist minority from violence, the Internal Security Operations Command produced Jatukham Rammathep amulets for public distribution. The renowned animist amulets were believed by some to have magical powers to protect their holders from violence and large sums were generally paid for them. The plan was developed by Colonel Manas Khongpan, deputy director of the ISOC in Yala Province.\nIn March 2007, Queen Sirikit vowed to protect people of all religions in the south, and initiated weapons training programmes for locals, particularly teachers. Sirikit's deputy aide–de–camp Napol Boonthap said that the government should review its strategy and not only use a conciliatory approach towards the insurgents. \"Legal action must also be taken against the wrongdoers to show we mean business,\" he said.\n14 March– Eight commuters from Betong to Hat Yai were executed after their van was stopped by insurgents. A roadside bomb delayed rangers stationed nearby in their efforts to reach the site. A Pattani United Liberation Organisation (PULO) executive blamed a portion of the violence directly on paramilitary rangers who instigated violence and then blamed insurgents for their deeds.\nCrown Prince Vajiralongkorn's motorcade was again targeted by a bombing in March 2007.

The military initially claimed that insurgents were behind the shooting. It later admitted that village defence volunteers attacked, after allegedly being \"provoked\" by insurgent sympathisers on the truck. Several hundred angry villagers staged protests against the shooting, demanding the government take action against those responsible.\n13 April– Protests after a mistaken shooting by security forces. Thai soldiers in Pattani shot and killed three Muslim teenagers. The soldiers, who were dispatched to investigate the torching of four mobile–phone relay outlets, opened fire on a group of teenagers when the soldiers thought the teenagers were charging at them. Locals reported that the teenagers were playing tag on the road near a weekly open market near where the soldiers were investigating. Three teenagers, aged 13 to 15 years, were killed and two others were injured. Local army commander Colonel Wanchai Paungkhumsa initially said the soldiers had acted in self–defense, saying that gunshots were fired from where a teenager was standing. Residents ended their protest after reaching a series of agreements with Pattani Governor Panu Uthairath over the shooting. The military agreed to investigate the shootings, and if it was a negligent act, soldiers would be faced criminal charges, be transferred out of the area, and an apology would be given to locals.\nMay– Sonthi started withdrawing troops from the south, replacing them with territorial defence volunteers. He did not say why the regular army was to be reduced in the south.\n14 May– Separatist insurgents shot dead a Thai–Buddhist couple working as fruit pickers in the majority–Muslim area of Bannang Sata, Yala Province and injured their three–year–old daughter. After gunning down Praphan Ponlarak, 36, and his wife Chaddakan, the assailants decapitated Praphan, making him the 29th victim to be beheaded in Thailand's south.\nViolence continued with a noted trend towards targeting soldiers and policemen, particularly after the militants' actions were criticised by Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, secretary–general of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. On 9 May 2007, the army saw its worse casualty in a single incident in years, when seven soldiers were killed in a roadside bombing incident. Two policemen were shot dead and their bodies burnt in another attack on 11 May 2007, which the authorities suspect were conducted by the same group which killed the soldiers. Another 11 soldiers were killed on 31 May 2007 in similar style to the incident on 9 May.\nBetween 27 May and 29 May 2007, several concerted bombings occurred, both in Hat Yai downtown in front of markets, shops and hotels, and also in Saba Yoi, altogether killing more than four people and injuring over 20. The attacks targeted Chinese–Thai, who consider them 'Jews of the Far East' because they are barred from the Thai civil service and are mainly traders.\nJuly– Former Fourth Army chief Harn Leelanont criticised the junta's reconciliation policy in the South, saying it left security personnel incapable of containing the violence.
