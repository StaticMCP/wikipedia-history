The song is about a boy who feels \"suicidal\" (a radio edit changes this to \"in denial\") over the prospect of dating a \"beautiful girl\" only to have her break up with him.\nThe song samples the 1961 song \"Stand by Me\" by American singer-songwriter Ben E. King.\nRapper Lil Mama and actors Kenny Vibert and Lil' JJ are featured in the music video directed by Marcus Raboy, which hit 1 billion YouTube views on September 8, 2022.\nLyrics controversy\nDue to the lyrics containing references to suicide, the song was ineligible to be played on Radio Disney. A re-recorded, clean version with new lyrics was added to the Radio Disney playlist on September 3, 2007. On September 21, 2007, it was reported that the original version of the song was removed from the radio playlist of FM104 in Dublin due to the suicide references.\nTrack listing\nUK CD single\n#\"Beautiful Girls\" (album version) – 4:02\n#\"Beautiful Girls\" (a cappella) – 3:41\n#\"Beautiful Girls\" (instrumental) – 3:40\n#\"Beautiful Girls\" (remix)  – 3:27\n#\"Beautiful Girls\" (video)\nChart performance\nThe week after the song's digital release it hit number one on Billboards Hot Digital Songs, debuting with 260,000 downloads in its first week (the second highest digital sales for a new song of 2007, only behind Rihanna's \"Umbrella\").

It was released digitally on July 20, 2007, as a cover response to \"Beautiful Girls\" by Sean Kingston. The song samples Ben E. King's \"Stand by Me\". Whereas Kingston's version is about a boy who is suicidal over the failure of his relationship with a \"beautiful girl\", JoJo speaks from a girl's perspective.\nChart performance\nThe song debuted at number 39 on the Billboard Rhythmic Top 40 chart one month after its release.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!
