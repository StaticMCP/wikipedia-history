His family moved to West Roxbury, when he was seven. As an older child, he conducted field studies of area wildlife and also studied taxidermy. Once again, his family moved to Worcester, where he became a member of the Worcester Natural History Society, and began to publish the results of his studies. At the age of sixteen he was appointed Curator of Ornithology of the Society's museum.\nWhen he was nineteen, he mounted an expedition to Florida &mdash; this would be the first of many trips he took around the United States to study birds.\nIn 1893, Forbush was appointed Ornithologist to the Massachusetts State Board of Agriculture. His primary studies at this time were \"economic ornithology\" &mdash; that is, determining whether a given species of bird was beneficial or detrimental to agriculture.\nIn 1908 he became the Massachusetts State Ornithologist.\nHe was a founder of the Massachusetts Audubon Society. He was also first president of the Northeastern Bird-Banding Association (now the Association of Field Ornithologists).\nHis work \"Birds of Massachusetts (and Other New England States)\" is a three-volume set of books published 1925&ndash;1929 by the Massachusetts Department of Agriculture. Title notwithstanding, it was and remains a valuable reference regarding not just New England birds but also in regard to ornithology of the Northeast and farther afield.\nHe was also known for his studies of the Heath Hen and his attempts to save the species.\nHe died in Westborough in 1929. His wife donated a glass case containing artistically arranged ornithological specimens to the Westborough Public Library, with a plaque reading:  \"Presented by Etta L. Forbush in memory of her husband Edward Howe Forbush. All specimens collected prepared and mounted by Mr. Forbush at the age of eighteen.\"  In 1931, The Forbush Bird Club of Worcester, Mass., was established in his memory.\nSelected publications\n*[https://archive.org/details/usefulbirdstheir00forbrich/page/n5/mode/2up Useful Birds and their Protection] (1907)\n*[https://archive.org/details/ratsratriddance00forb Rats and Rat Riddance] (1915)\n*[https://archive.org/details/historyofgamebir00for A History of the Game birds, Wild Fowl and Shore Birds of Massachusetts and Adjacent States] (1916)\n*[https://archive.org/details/domesticcatbirdk00forb The Domestic Cat] (1916)\n*[https://archive.org/details/birdsofmassachu01forb Birds of Massachusetts and Other New England States] (1925)\nNotes\nReferences\n*Forbush, Edward Howe, 1925–1929, The Birds of Massachusetts (and Other New England States). 3 vol.
