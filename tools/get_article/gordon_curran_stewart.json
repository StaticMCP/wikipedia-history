His father was born in Scotland and emigrated to the United States at the age of 26, where he became a Presbyterian minister and social worker/organizer in the Chicago neighborhoods. Stewart's mother, Evangeline, worked as a University of Chicago librarian, and this, coupled with the help of a scholarship, allowed Stewart to enter the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, where he remained into his high school years and where he was student body president.\nEducation\nStewart received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the Oberlin College of Arts and Sciences (as the full four-year George F. Baker Scholar having been accepted at the age of 16), where he focused on history and music.  He returned to the University of Chicago to work on a PhD. in European History.  He studied music and drama at the University of Vienna in Austria, and then received an MFA in Directing from Yale School of Drama. In his last year at the Yale School of Drama, he was admitted as a doctoral candidate in comparative literature, which led to his first position as an instructor of English and theatre at Amherst College.\nCareer\nPre-White House\nStewart's first political job was as a ten-year-old poll-watcher in Chicago's 5th Ward which staunchly but futilely opposed the political machine of Richard J. Daley. His next was at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools where he was student body president. As a student at Oberlin College, he won its only all-school election, and spent several months traveling in and writing about West Africa in the days before the Peace Corps was founded. He left teaching at Amherst College to begin a career in drama and politics in New York. While he was directing plays, he worked as Director of Communications for Business Communications for the Arts. There he wrote his first article for a noted public figure, former US Treasury Secretary C. Douglas Dillon, followed by speeches for Katharine Graham of The Washington Post, William S. Paley of CBS, and Arnold Gingrich, the founder of Esquire Magazine, who introduced him to New York Mayor John Lindsay, which led to his position as Chief Speechwriter and Executive Assistant to the Mayor from 1971 to 1973.\nFollowing his time in City Hall, Stewart was Director of Policy for Howard J. Samuels's run for the Governorship of New York in 1974, and also wrote speeches for other Democratic Party campaigns, including Jimmy Carter's successful run for the Presidency of the United States in 1976.
