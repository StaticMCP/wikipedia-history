Obama argued that it was necessary to intervene because the recent chemical weapons attack in Syria \"risks making a mockery of the global prohibition on the use of chemicals weapons\" and that it put U.S. regional allies that share a border with Syria in danger.\nSeptember 2013\n3 September\nIsrael launches two missiles to test its advanced defence system.
