The standards were typically in the form of a rectangular red banner with the Soviet state emblem and the unit's name on the front side. The decree required the standard to be present at the battlefield. The loss of the standard \"due to faintheartedness\" was punishable by court-martial and the disbandment of the military unit. On several occasions the standards were saved at the cost of life or hidden to prevent their capture. However, within months following the invasion of the Soviet Union the Germans captured dozens of Soviet regimental and divisional standards. Some others were later either retrieved or substituted with new ones.\nBattalions\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Unit\n! Details of the standard's loss\n|-\n| 97th Separate Communication Battalion\n| Captured by the Germans in 1941\n|-\n| 132nd Separate NKVD Escort Troops Battalion\n| Captured by the Germans after the defense of Brest Fortress, being found under the fortress' ruins\n|-\n| 573rd Communication Battalion\n| Stolen due to negligence of Lieutenant Pavlov. Captain Rutkovsky, who entrusted the standard to Pavlov, was arrested for 15 days, reduced in rank, and had half of his salary withheld\n|}\nRegiments\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Unit\n! Details of the standard's loss\n|-\n| 8th Guards Airborne Rifle Regiment\n| Lost in 1944 during the battle of Nyíregyháza. Because the regiment's personnel had been killed in action while protecting the standard, the People's Commissar of Defense allowed the regiment to receive a new standard and retain its Guards status.\n|-\n| 9th Vyborg Rifle Regiment\n| Captured by the Germans in 1941\n|-\n| 10th Guards Airborne Rifle Regiment\n| Lost in 1944 during the battle of Nyíregyháza. Alongside the 8th Guards Airborne Rifle Regiment, the regiment was allowed by the People's Commissar of Defense to receive a new standard and retain its Guards status, as its personnel had also died while protecting the standard.\n|-\n| 16th Rifle Regiment\n| Lost in unclear circumstances after the battle on 10 February 1943, the prosecutor's investigation was inconclusive.\n|-\n| 30th Horse Artillery Regiment\n| Captured by the Wehrmacht during the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula\n|-\n| 43rd Guards Mortar Regiment\n| Went missing in the summer of 1942 during an encirclement in Salsk Steppe.

As the result, the regiment was transformed into a penal military unit and its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Yevgeny Danilevich, was reduced in rank to major. In February 1945 the regiment was restored to its original status. This is the only case of punishment of the entire unit for the loss of standard during the war.\n|-\n| 220th Cavalry Regiment\n| Lost in 1944 during the battle of Nagykálló, and later retrieved after eight days\n|-\n| 243rd Howitzer Artillery Regiment\n| Captured by the Germans in 1941\n|-\n| 243rd Rifle Regiment\n| Captured by the Germans in 1941\n|-\n| 283rd Corps Artillery Regiment\n| Captured by the Germans in the village Podvysokoye (present Ukraine), hung at the headquarters of commander Ludwig Kübler\n|-\n| 479th Anti-Aircraft Regiment\n| Captured in 1941\n|-\n| 754th Howitzer Artillery Regiment\n| Burned down in February 1944 after the staff car transporting it had been directly hit by an aircraft bomb\n|-\n| 945th Rifle Regiment\n| Captured by the Germans in 1945 during the battle of Metgethen\n|-\n| 975th Artillery Regiment\n| Lost in action during the Second Battle of Kharkov.
