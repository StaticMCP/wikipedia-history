From 2008 to 2013, it was part of Rockhampton Region. In 2014, the Shire of Livingstone was re-established and now administers Lammermoor.\nDemographics\nIn the , Lammermoor had a population of 1,316 people.\nIn the , Lammermoor had a population of 2,167 people.\nIn the , Lammermoor had a population of 2,551 people.\nEducation\nSacred Heart Catholic Primary School is a Catholic primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 14 Barracuda Crescent ().
