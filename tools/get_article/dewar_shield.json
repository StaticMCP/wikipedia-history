It is the premier amateur rugby competition in Victoria. A total of eight teams from the Victorian Rugby Union compete for the trophy. Clubs must field teams in 3 grades, Dewar Shield Reserves (Penwill Cup) and Dewar Shield 3rd Grade (Mawhinney Cup), to be eligible to compete.\nA \"Game of the week\" is streamed on the Rugby Victoria Facebook Page.\nHistory\nThe Victorian Rugby Union senior competition was established in 1909 with five teams, namely East Melbourne, Melbourne, South Melbourne, St Kilda and University. The Melbourne Rugby Club of that time won the first year of the five-team competition for the new trophy the Dewar Shield (donated by the Scotch Whisky Distillery John Dewar and Sons). One hundred years later in 2009 the current Melbourne Rugby Club once again won the premiership defeating Box Hill in the Grand Final for the same Dewar Shield. The Current (2025) Premiers are Power House who defeated Harlequins 45-29 in the Grand Final held at Box Hill\nThe Premier competition is contested by eight clubs with each club fielding three teams (1st Grade, Reserve Grade, and 3rd Grade). Other senior competitions offered are Metro 2nd Division with an A, B & C Grade, Colts (U20), Country, Women and Masters (over 35s).\nDuring this time, a number of clubs have dominated the 1st Grade results. Melbourne Rugby Club has the most number of Premierships with 20. Moorabbin holds the record for consecutive Premierships, winning six in a row from 1981 to 1986. Other prominent clubs during this 100-year period include Melbourne University, Power House and Navy.\nFootscray and Endeavour Hills were promoted to the Premier division for the 2011 season.\nDewar Shield Clubs\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:95%;\"\n|+ style=\"text-align:left; font-size:110%; line-height: 2.1em;\"| Teams that compete for the Dewar Shield\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"7%\"| Est.\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"5%\"| Colours\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"19%\"| Club\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"17%\"| Location\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"15%\"| Home Ground\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"14%\"| Nickname\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"20%\"| Admitted to Premier Grade\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"20%\"| Premierships (most recent)\n|-\n| 1958\n|\n| Box Hill\n| Box Hill\n| RHL Sparks Reserve\n| Broncos\n| 1966\n| 3 (2001)\n|-\n| 1979\n|\n| Endeavour Hills\n| Endeavour Hills\n| Frog Hollow Reserve\n| Eagles\n| 2007\n|\n|-\n| 1928\n|\n| Footscray\n| Footscray\n| Henry Turner Memorial Reserve\n| Bulldogs\n| 1928\n| 3 (1937)\n|-\n| 1928\n|\n| Melbourne Harlequins\n| Ashwood\n| Ashwood Reserve\n| Quins\n| 1930\n| 12 (2023)\n|-\n| 1909\n|\n| Melbourne\n| Armadale\n| Romanis Reserve, Orrong Park\n| Unicorns\n| 1929\n| 20 (2019)\n|-\n| 1909\n|\n| Melbourne University\n| Parkville\n| Royal Park\n| Students\n| 1910\n| 6 (1967)\n|-\n| 1965\n|\n| Moorabbin\n| Moorabbin\n| Keys Rd Reserve\n| Rams\n| 1965\n| 15 (2012)\n|-\n| 1933\n|\n| Power House\n| Albert Park\n| Noel Clarke Field\n| House, The Society\n| 1936\n| 13 (2025)\n|-\n| 1923\n| .\n| Kiwi Hawthorn\n| Hawthorn\n| Lewin Reserve\n| Kiwis\n| 1987, (1923 as The Kiwi Club)\n| 13 (1996)\n|-\n|}\nWinners\nVictorian Rugby Union Premiership winners\nFormer clubs\n(list may not be complete)\n* East Melbourne\n* South Melbourne\n* St Kilda\n* Hawthorn\n* Kiwi\n* Navy\n* R.A.A.F\n* Boroondara/Kiwi-Hawthorna\n* South Melbourne\n* Southern Districtsb\n* Geelong\n* Northcote/Northern\na Kiwi-Hawthorn now play in the Premiership competition.\nb Southern Districts now play in the Premiership competition.\nSee also\n*Victorian Rugby Union\n*Melbourne Rebels\n*List of oldest rugby union competitions\n*List of Australian club rugby union competitions\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n*[https://vic.rugby/competitions/dewar-shield/dewar-shield-overview/ Dewar Shield] - Rugby Victoria\nClub websites\n*[http://www.boxhillrugby.com.au/ Box Hill RUFC]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20141226103058/http://www.endeavourhills.rugbynet.com.au/ Endeavour Hills RUFC]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130310000935/http://footscrayrugby.org/ Footscray RUC]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140212190657/http://www.quinsrugby.com/ Harlequin RUC]\n*[http://www.melbournerugby.com.au/ Melbourne RUFC]\n*[http://www.melbourneunirugby.com/ Melbourne University RFC]\n*[http://www.moorabbinrams.com Moorabbin RUFC]\n*[https://powerhouserufc.com.au/ Power House RUFC]"
