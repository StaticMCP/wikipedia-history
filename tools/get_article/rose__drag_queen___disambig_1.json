He is best known for competing on the thirteenth season of RuPaul's Drag Race'', placing as third/fourth runner-up alongside Gottmik.\nEarly life\nMcCorkell was born to Heather McCorkell in Greenock, Scotland, in Inverclyde. As a young child, he moved with his parents, brother, and sister to Aberdeen, where he grew up. At the age of 10, the family moved to Sugar Land, Texas, where his parents still live. McCorkell says that to fit in at school he would put on an American accent.\nCareer\nMcCorkell, after starting drag in 2017, performed in a queer play as part of the Capital Fringe Festival, in Washington, D.C. He originally considered making “PIG.” his drag name. Then he, together with queens Jan Sport and Lagoona Bloo, formed the pop group Stephanie's Child in 2018.  In 2017, Rosé won the Lady Liberty drag competition in New York after 12 weeks of competition against 73 other drag kings and queens. He graduated from Wichita State University.\nRosé's casting on the thirteenth season of ''RuPaul's Drag Race'' was announced on 9 December 2020. Rosé performed well in the competition, winning three challenges, including the Rusical, and ultimately reaching the top four alongside Gottmik, Kandy Muse, and Symone. Rosé was one of two contestants to never be up for elimination during the season, along with Gottmik. Rosé was eliminated during the finale episode in a lip sync battle against Kandy Muse, ultimately tying with Gottmik as second/third runner up.\nAfter the airing of the Snatch Game episode, Rosé posted a mini-series to Instagram's IGTV and YouTube titled Mary, Queen of Scots, performing as the Snatch Game character. The mini-series has featured some of Rosé's friends, including Jan and Matthew Camp.\nMcCorkell released his debut single as a solo artist on 7 May 2021, called \"The Devil in the Details\".\nIn December 2022, Rosé was cast in Titanique, a successful off-Broadway musical parody of James Cameron's 1997 blockbuster film.\nIn July 2023, Rosé was announced to star as Glinda in the Geva Theatre Center's all-LGBTQ+ production of The Wizard of Oz.\nFilmography\nTelevision\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Role\n! scope=\"col\" | Notes\n|-\n|2017\n|The Voice\n|Herself (with Stephanie's Child and Jessie J)\n|Special guest\n|-\n|2019\n|''America's Got Talent''\n|Herself (with Stephanie's Child)\n|Contestant\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2021\n|''RuPaul's Drag Race (season 13)\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Herself\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Contestant (3rd/4th Place)\n|-\n|RuPaul's Drag Race: Untucked\n|-\n|RuPaul's Drag Race: Corona Can't Keep a Good Queen Down\n| Standalone special\n|-\n|2022\n|iCarly\n| Kimmy Kimmy Moore\n| Episode: \"iDragged Him\"\n|-\n| 2022–2023\n| Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen\n| Herself\n| 2 episodes\n|}\nWeb series\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n! scope=\"col\" |Year\n! scope=\"col\" |Title\n! scope=\"col\" |Role\n! scope=\"col\" |Notes\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|2021\n|Ruvealing the Look''\n|rowspan=\"5\"| Herself\n|rowspan=\"5\"| Guest\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|-\n|Whatcha Packin'\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|-\n|Cosmo Queens\n|style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|-\n|The X Change Rate\n|style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|-\n|Out of the Closet\n|style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|}\nMusic videos\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n! scope=\"col\" |Year\n! scope=\"col\" |Title\n! scope=\"col\" |Notes\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|-\n| 2021\n| \"GIMME WHAT I WANT\" (Miley Cyrus Cover)\n| Directed by Austin Nunes\n|\n|-\n| 2021\n| \"BOYS\" Disco Remix Ft.
