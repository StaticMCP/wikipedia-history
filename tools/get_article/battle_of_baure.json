After a short engagement on the perimeter of the base, the attack was repulsed, leaving 11 Al-Shabaab fighters and 2 Kenyan soldiers dead. The Al-Shabaab second-in-command was 25 year old British-born Thomas Evans (\"Abdul Hakim\"), who filmed the attack with a camera strapped to his body, and Evans died in the fighting. Evans was well integrated into al-Shabaab, having first joined in 2012, he spoke fluent Somali and issued commands and communicated with fellow fighters through radio. German-born Andreas Martin Muller (\"Abu Nusaybah\") also took part in the attack, and escaped alive but wounded.\nReferences"
