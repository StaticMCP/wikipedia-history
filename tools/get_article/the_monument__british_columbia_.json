      "text": "# The Monument (British Columbia)\n\nThe Monument is a hoodoo in Cassiar Land District of the Northern Interior of British Columbia, Canada. It lies on the southwestern side of Hoodoo Mountain, a flat-topped stratovolcano in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. This light grey, needle-like rock formation has an elevation of about  and rises more than  high, gradually decreasing in diameter to a very sharp point. It is slightly oval in cross-section and stands out against the volcanic rocks comprising Hoodoo Mountain.\nThe Monument contains horizontal columnar jointing and is the eroded remains of a volcanic vent that was probably active between 40,000–30,000&nbsp;years ago. However, the amount of lava supplied by The Monument was probably small compared to the main vents now buried beneath Hoodoo's ice cap. It was fed by a dike that intrudes Slide Canyon on the southwestern side of Hoodoo Mountain.  The surface of The Monument peels off like the layers of an onion, resulting in the creation of a light grey talus deposit at its base. The Monument has been described as a lava spine or a volcanic neck.\nThe Monument is a local name that has not been officially approved by the Geographical Names Board of Canada.\nReferences"
