The standard save the world plot relies on impossible coincidences to fuel a second act twist that's completely unbelievable. You'd think that would disqualify the film as being another forgettable actioner. Imagine my surprise to be actually smiling when the credits rolled. Likable primary characters and a stable of interesting goons kept my attention throughout.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
