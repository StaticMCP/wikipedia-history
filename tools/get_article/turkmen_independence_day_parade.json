Independence Day is the main holiday of Turkmenistan. The parade is held in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan every year and is the largest and most frequent military parade in Central Asia.\nThe parade in full detail\nThe President of Turkmenistan arrives on Independence Square at 10:00AM to the tune of the Presidential Fanfare. The president watches proceedings from the first-floor balcony of the Ceremony Field and Protocol Building, while diplomats and officials watch from below. The Minister of Defense first reports to the president on the status of the parade before heading to his white Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupé inspection vehicle while the parade commander (usually the Deputy Defense Minister or the Chief of the General Staff) gives the order to begin the review of the Ashgabat Garrison. The PC then gives his report on the parade's status to the minister before they both conduct a pass-in-review of the troops. While this happens, the troops sound a three-fold hurray until the minister finishes his/her inspection. After this is done, the national anthem of Turkmenistan is played by the massed bands of the Military Band Service of the Armed Forces of Turkmenistan and a combined choir. While this happens, a flag raising ceremony is also held on the square. The troops will then take an oath of allegiance to Turkmenistan, the Turkmen people, and the president.\nThe parade commander, following the pledge taking, then gives the command to commence the parade proper as the markers take their places. Once the parade is ordered to begin, the Color Guard of the Independent Honor Guard Battalion of the Ministry of Defence of Turkmenistan starts to march down the square, followed by the Corps of Drums of the Berdimuhamed Annayev 1st Specialized Military School and the Military Institute of the Ministry of Defense, following by the units and formations of the Turkmen Ground Forces, Air Force, Naval Forces (Naval Institute and Marine Battalion), Internal Troops, State Border Service, and the Ministry for National Security. While marching, the servicemen chant the phrase \"the people, the homeland, and the great Supreme Commander-in-Chief!\" After this is done, vehicles are then paraded across the square with military aviation flying overhead. At the conclusion of the parade, a drill team from the Independent Honor Guard Battalion of the Ministry of Defence and the massed bands and corps of drums of the military band service perform an exhibition drill. The military parade is followed by the mass procession of representatives of the five Regions of Turkmenistan (Ahal, Balkan, Dashoguz, Lebap and Mary), the capital of Ashgabat, as well as workers in various branches of Turkmenistan's economy.\nTimeline of notable anniversary parades since 1992\nParades have been held annually since 1997:\n* 1993 - It celebrated the 2nd anniversary of independence.

As a result of these designs, the parade took place on a square in the southern outskirts of Ashgabat, with a grandstand being installed on the square eleven days prior. Unlike previous years, Berdimuhamedov received a report from the Secretary of the State Security Council of Turkmenistan, Lieutenant General Çarymyrat Amanow. Turkish-made Baykar Bayraktar TB2 drones were shown off for the first time at the parade. A virtual procession of naval ships passing in the port in the Caspian Sea also took place. After the military parade, the president was presented with a horse named Garashsyz (Independent) from members of the government. The President of the Republic of Tatarstan Rustam Minnikhanov and the Director General of KAMAZ Sergey Kogogin were in attendance.\n* 2022 - The 31st anniversary parade was the first under the newly elected President of Turkmenistan Serdar Berdimuhamedow.\nGallery\nFile:Independence Day Parade - Flickr - Kerri-Jo.jpg| BMP-2 Infantry Fighting Vehicle\nFile:Independence Day Parade - Flickr - Kerri-Jo (200).jpg|Mounted Army Cavalary\nFile:Independence Day Parade - Flickr - Kerri-Jo (215).jpg|Mass demonstrations\nFile:Independence Day Parade - Flickr - Kerri-Jo (11).jpg|An inspection of troops\nFile:Independence Day Parade - Flickr - Kerri-Jo (110).jpg|A soldier during the exhibition drill\nFile:Independence Day Parade - Flickr - Kerri-Jo (24).jpg|Air force soldiers\nFile:Independence Day Parade - Flickr - Kerri-Jo (309).jpg|An aviation float\nFile:Independence Day Parade - Flickr - Kerri-Jo (117).jpg|Massed bands\nFile:Independence Day Parade - Flickr - Kerri-Jo (5).jpg|The entire parade with the Ruhyýet Palace in the background\nFile:Independence Day Parade - Flickr - Kerri-Jo (32).jpg|Ground Forces\nSee also\n*Independence Day (Turkmenistan)\n*Armed Forces of Turkmenistan\nExternal links\n*[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=473xmdqnsx4 Turkmenistan Military Parade, 27 October 2014]\n*[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CNn1zp5VvZw Türkmenistan'da 'Bağımsızlık Bayramı']\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIPsZ3nEa3c?t=474 Turkmenistan Military Parade, 27 September 2021 - Watan Habalary]\nReferences"
