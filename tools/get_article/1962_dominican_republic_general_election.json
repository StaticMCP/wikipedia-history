They were the first after the end of the Rafael Trujillo dictatorship two years earlier, as well as the first with no military candidates for president since 1938. They are generally regarded to be the first free elections in the country's history.\nJuan Bosch of the democratic socialist Dominican Revolutionary Party won the presidential election, whilst his party also won substantial majorities in both houses of Congress. There was also an election for a Constituent National Assembly, which was to amend certain articles of the constitution. However, reforms implemented by Bosch alienated the American government and the local oligarchy, leading to a coup the following year, and eventually the Dominican Civil War. Voter turnout was 65%.\nResults\nPresident\n|votes2=317327\n|cand3=Alfonso Moreno Martínez|party3=Social Christian Revolutionary Party|votes3=54638\n|cand4=Virgilio Maynardi Reyna|party4=Democratic Revolutionary Nationalist Party|votes4=35764\n|cand5=Juan Isidro Jimenes Grullón|party5=Social Democratic Alliance|votes5=17898\n|cand6=Joaquín Balaguer|party6=Authentic Dominican Revolutionary Party|votes6=1273\n|invalid=18291\n|electorate=1646973\n|source=Nohlen\n}}\nCongress\n|votes2=315371|st1t2=20|st2t2=4\n|party3=Social Christian Revolutionary Party|votes3=56794|st1t3=1|st2t3=0\n|party4=Democratic Revolutionary Nationalist Party|votes4=36972|st1t4=4|st2t4=1\n|party5=Social Democratic Alliance|votes5=18726|st1t5=0|st2t5=0\n|party6=Dominican Revolutionary Vanguard|votes6=18586|st1t6=0|st2t6=0\n|party7=Authentic Dominican Revolutionary Party|votes7=5306|st1t7=0|st2t7=0\n|party8=National Party|votes8=4161|st1t8=0|st2t8=0\n|invalid=18291\n|electorate=1646973\n|source=Nohlen\n}}\nReferences"
