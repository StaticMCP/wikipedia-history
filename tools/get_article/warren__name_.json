      "text": "# Warren (name)\n\nWarren () is a common English and Irish surname and a masculine given name derived from the Norman family \"de Warenne\" (see De Warenne family), a reference to a place called Varenne, a hamlet near Arques-la-Bataille, along the river Varenne (Warinna in Medieval documents) in Normandy. The river name is thought to be derived from the continental Old Celtic Var- / Ver- \"water, river\", with a Germanic influence on the initial V- > W- after Warinna, from the Proto-Germanic war-, meaning \"to protect or defend\".\nNotable people with the name include:\nSurname\nA\n*Alan Warren (priest) (1932–2020), Anglican priest and author\n*Alan Warren (sailor) (born 1935), British sailor\n*Alfred Warren (1856–1927), British Conservative member of Parliament\n*Allan Warren, English photographer\n*Andy Warren (British musician)\n*Andy Warren (Canadian musician)\n*Andrew Warren (disambiguation)\n*Arnold Warren, English athlete\n*Art Warren (born 1993), American baseball player\n*Austin Warren (disambiguation)\nB\n*Barney E.
