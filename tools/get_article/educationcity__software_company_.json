The company stated that their site had over 15,500 schools and 8,000 families registered. The service provided educational learning experiences mapped to the National Curriculum in English, Mathematics, Science, language education and computing. The company had won awards, was a BETT and ERA finalist and had been reviewed by the Times Educational Supplement a number of times.\nIn April 2010, EducationCity.com became one of the first ICT content providers to receive accreditation by South West Grid for Learning (SWGfL) Merlin for the integration of the resource into the Merlin Learning platform through the use of Shibboleth and the Systems Interoperability Framework (SIF) .\nOn 16 May 2011, the site had an Alexa rating of 78,987. EducationCity.com launched a new module, Learn English to address English as an Additional Language (English language learning and teaching) needs in primary school.\nAt some point, EducationCity had offices in Rutland, UK and Naperville, US - though after the shutdown of their services, it is unclear whether this is still the case.\nHistory\nIn June 2010, Archipelago Learning (), acquired EducationCity.com.

All user and teacher data was deleted, all contracts were terminated, and access to the software was completely removed. All pre-existing blog posts and links to anywhere within the website now redirect to the parent company Edmentum's website, at [https://www.edmentum.com/intl edmentum.com] . Schools and users were given some time to download any worksheets or videos from the site, but, from that date onward, the software ceased to exist. Furthermore, the parent company's FAQ made it clear that they no longer wish to provide UK-aligned education software.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.educationcity.com EducationCity.com] (company website, now a redirect to Edmentum's homepage)"
