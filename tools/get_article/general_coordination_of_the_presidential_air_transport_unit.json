Mexico's President uses mainly a Boeing 757-225 ordered by President\nMiguel de la Madrid built in 1987 exclusively for this purpose. The plane's official callsign when the president is inboard is TP-01, which stands for Transporte Presidencial 1 (Presidential Transport 1). President Felipe Calderón ordered a new Boeing 787-8 at a cost of 218 million dollars, which has been delivered on February 2, 2016 to substitute the aging 757, and was recently sold to the Government of Tajikistan. When flying into airports with short runways, he uses either a Boeing 737-33A (TP-02) or a Boeing 737-322 (TP-03). For short trips he uses a Super Puma VIP edition called TPH-01 which stands for Transporte Presidencial Helicoptero 1 (Helicopter Presidential Transport 1). Before the 737s and the 757, two Boeing 727-100 were used as presidential transport. The current presidential fleet as of 2008 is as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Aircraft\n!
