It was his first album of entirely new material since 1983's \"Not the Boy Next Door\".\nReviews\nWilliam Ruhlmann from AllMusic gave the album 3 out of 5, saying; \"There may [be] nods to his past, but otherwise Allen was very up to date on Making Every Moment Count, employing five different producers to come up with a recording that had a timely sound, complete with icy synthesizer riffs and programmed drums coming on like torpedoes.” He added, “he remained most affecting on the ballads, which had a poignancy that would be accentuated by Allen's death from AIDS in 1992.”\nTrack listing\n# \"Tonight You Made My Day\" (Peter Allen, Seth Swirsky) - 4:12\n# \"Making Every Moment Count\" (with Melissa Manchester) (Peter Allen, Seth Swirsky) - 3:58\n# \"When I Get My Name in Lights\"(with Harry Connick Jr.) (Peter Allen) - 3:03\n# \"Nobody Can Break Us Up\" (Michael Jay, Peter Allen) - 4:21\n# \"I Could Marry the Rain\" (Peter Allen) - 3:08\n# \"See You in the Springtime\" (Dean Pitchford, Peter Allen) - 4:08\n# \"So Much Depends On Love Today\" (Peter Allen) - 4:41\n# \"Why Not?\" (Dean Pitchford, Peter Allen) - 3:34\n# \"I Couldn't Have Done It Without You\" (Peter Allen, Seth Swirsky) - 3:46\n# \"Love Don't Need a Reason\" (Marsha Malamet, Michael Callen, Peter Allen) - 3:36\nReferences"
