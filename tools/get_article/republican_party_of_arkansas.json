It is currently the dominant party in the state, controlling all four of Arkansas' U.S. House seats, both U.S. Senate seats, all statewide executive offices, including the governorship, and supermajorities in both houses of the state legislature.\nThe Republican Party of Arkansas was founded on April 2, 1867, by \"the leading Union men\" of Arkansas. Under Powell Clayton, it played a preeminent role in politics at the height of Reconstruction in the state (1864–1874). The party chairman is Joseph K. Wood.\nHistory\nThe Republican Party, also referred to as the GOP (Grand Old Party), is the second oldest currently existing political party in the United States after its older rival, the Democratic Party. Both parties exist in all fifty states. Historically, prior to the late 20th century, the Republican Party was much weaker than the Democratic Party in the former states of the old Confederacy, including Arkansas.\nThe Arkansas party did not hire its first paid executive director until 1970, when businessman Neal Sox Johnson, then of Nashville, Arkansas, assumed the position in the last year of  Winthrop Rockefeller's second term as governor of Arkansas.\nJohnson held the position until early in 1973, when he left Arkansas to take a position with the former Farmers Home Administration in Washington.\nBetween 2010 and 2014, similar to what took place in neighboring Oklahoma, Arkansas Republicans won all four U.S. House seats, both U.S. Senate seats, all of the statewide offices, and supermajority control of both chambers of the General Assembly.\nAssociated groups\nThere are six groups and these groups are: Arkansas Diversity Alliances Coalition, African American Coalition of Arkansas, Arkansas African American Trailblazers, Arkansas Federation of College Republicans, Arkansas Federation of Young Republicans, Arkansas Federation of Republican Women, and the Arkansas Federation of Teenage Republicans. The Tusk Club is another arm of the Arkansas Republican Party.\nRepublican governors\nAs of 2023, there have been a total of eight Republican governors.\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:center;\"|#\n!style=\"text-align:center;\"|Governor\n!style=\"text-align:center;\"|Photo\n!style=\"text-align:center;\"|County\n!style=\"text-align:center;\"|Start date\n!style=\"text-align:center;\"|End date\n!style=\"text-align:center;\"|Time in office\n|- style=\"text-align:left; background:#fff;\"\n|9\n| (1833–1914)\n|\n|Jefferson\n|July 2, 1868\n|March 17, 1871\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:left; background:#fff;\"\n|\n| (1826–1915)\n|\n|Pulaski\n|March 17, 1871\n|January 6, 1873\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:left; background:#fff;\"\n|10\n| (1827–1899)\n|\n|Independence\n|January 6, 1873\n|November 12, 1874\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:left; background:#fff;\"\n|37\n| (1912–1973)\n|\n|Conway\n|January 10, 1967\n|January 12, 1971\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:left; background:#fff;\"\n|41\n| (1933–2003)\n|\n|Pulaski\n|January 19, 1981\n|January 11, 1983\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:left; background:#fff;\"\n|44\n| (born 1955)\n|\n|Hempstead\n|July 15, 1996\n|January 9, 2007\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:left; background:#fff;\"\n|46\n| (born 1950)\n|\n|Benton\n|January 13, 2015\n|January 10, 2023\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:left; background:#fff;\"\n|47\n| (born 1982)\n|\n|Hempstead\n|January 10, 2023\n|Incumbent\n|\n|}\nCurrent elected officials\nThe Arkansas Republican Party controls all of the state's seven statewide offices.
