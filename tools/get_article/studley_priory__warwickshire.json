His grandson William III de Cantilupe (d.1254) was also buried at Studley, as was the latter's son and heir Sir George de Cantilupe (1251-1273), who inherited aged 3, 4th feudal baron of Eaton Bray in Bedfordshire, Lord of Abergavenny, who died childless aged 22.\nWhen the priory was closed c. 1536 at the dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII it housed the prior and eight religious brethren. The priory and manor of Studley were granted to Sir Edmund Knightley, who used the buildings  as a source of stone for other buildings.\nNothing remains today apart from the use of the name priory in a few local building names such as Priory Farm which, now much modernised, embodies a few fragmentary portions of a conventual building and is a Grade II* listed building.  A gabled west wall of stone rubble contains the remains of a large 14th-century window. A few medieval sculptured fragments are built on to the walls.\nReferences"
