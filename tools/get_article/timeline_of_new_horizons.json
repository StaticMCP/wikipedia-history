Flyby of Pluto around 11:49:57&nbsp;UTC at 12,500&nbsp;km, 13.78&nbsp;km/s.  Pluto is 32.9 AU from Sun.  Flyby of Charon around 12:03:50&nbsp;UTC at 28,858&nbsp;km, 13.87&nbsp;km/s.\n* July 14, 2015 to October 25, 2016: Transmission of collected data sent back to Earth, and ongoing science discovery based on the observations. The bit rate of the downlink is limited to 1–2&nbsp;kb/s, so it took until October 25, 2016, to transmit all the data.\nArrokoth pre-encounter phase\n* October 22 – November 4, 2015: Trajectory correction maneuver. A course adjustment for the January 2019 flyby of Arrokoth was performed in a series of four thruster firings of 22 minutes each.\n* November 2, 2015: Observation of KBO 15810 Arawn. Long-range observations from a distance of , the closest ever for any Trans-Neptunian Object other than Pluto and 486958 Arrokoth. More images were taken on April 7–8, 2016, at a range of  as well.\n* July 13–14, 2016: Observation of KBO 50000 Quaoar. Long-range observations from a distance of  gives mission scientists a different perspective in order to study the light-scattering properties of Quaoar's surface.\n* February 1, 2017: Trajectory correction maneuver. A small course adjustment towards the January 2019 flyby of Arrokoth was performed with a 44-second thruster firing.\n* March 12, 2017: Arrokoth's orbit is deemed to be sufficiently well-resolved that it is formally catalogued as minor planet #486,958 and announced as such via Minor Planet Circular 103886. From now until its naming in November 2019, the object's official designation is to be .\n* 2017–2020: Observations of Kuiper belt objects (KBOs). The probe will have opportunities to perform observations of 10 to 20 KBOs visible from the spacecraft's trajectory after the Pluto system flyby. Heliosphere data collection is expected to begin.\n* December 9, 2017: Trajectory correction maneuver. This delays the arrival at Arrokoth by a few hours, optimizing coverage by ground-based radio telescopes.\n* December 23, 2017 – June 4, 2018: Final hibernation period before the (KBO) Arrokoth encounter.\n* August 2018 – March 2019: Distant observations of at least a dozen distant KBOs. Recovered by Subaru Telescope in 2014–2017, enabling New Horizons observations\n* August 13, 2018: Switch from spin stabilization to 3-axis stabilization.\n* August 16, 2018 – December 24, 2018: Approach phase. Optical navigation, search for hazardous material around Arrokoth\n* August 16, 2018: First detection of Kuiper belt object Arrokoth\n* October 4, 2018 – December 2, 2018: Opportunities for trajectory correction maneuvers. Maneuvers scheduled for October 4 and November 20, with backups on October 23 and December 2, respectively\nArrokoth science phase and beyond\n* January 1, 2019: Flyby of Arrokoth, then nicknamed Ultima Thule. The flyby occurred at 05:33&nbsp;UTC, and is the outermost close encounter of any Solar System object.\n* January 9, 2019: Switch from 3-axis stabilization to spin stabilization. This ended the Arrokoth flyby, marking the beginning of the downlink phase.\n* 2019–2020: Downlink of data from the Arrokoth flyby. Predicted to take approximately 20 months.\n* November 12, 2019: The object previously known by the provisional designation of  (later numbered 486958 and nicknamed Ultima Thule) was officially named Arrokoth.\n* April 22–23, 2020: Stellar distance measurements to both Proxima Centauri, and Wolf 359 using stereoscopic images from New Horizons and Earth-based telescopes for usable parallax observation.\n* April 15, 2021: New Horizons reaches 50 AU from the Sun, becoming the fifth spacecraft to reach the milestone.\n* April 30, 2021: End of the first extended mission.\n* May 26, 2022: \"NASA’s New Horizons mission’s second extended mission proposal was approved.\" This two-year mission \"will make distant observations of Uranus and Neptune[,] map the very faint 'cosmic background' in visible and ultraviolet (UV) light [and use] its instruments to understand the motions of charged particles as they interact with the solar wind, and to understand our heliosphere's large-scale structure.\"\n* 2020s: The probe may be able to fly by a third KBO. The probe approached Arrokoth along its rotational axis, which simplified trajectory correction maneuvers, saving fuel that could be used to target another KBO. After the flyby, the spacecraft was left with  of fuel.\n* Mid to late 2030s: Expected end of the mission, based on RTG decay. Heliosphere data collection expected to be intermittent if instrument power sharing is required.\nPost-mission phase\n* 2038: New Horizons will be 100 AU from the Sun. If still functioning, the probe will explore the outer heliosphere and interstellar space along with the Voyager spacecraft.\nReferences"
