Townsend Jr. declined to seek re-election. At the Republican convention, former State Representative William D. Denney, the frontrunner for the nomination, received the Party's endorsement for Governor without difficulty—though some opposition to his candidacy arose before the convention.\nThe Democratic contest was more lively, with several prospective candidates in the mix. Attorney Andrew J. Lynch received the endorsement of the Sussex County delegation over Willard F. Deputy, a lumber merchant. At the convention, Lynch was nominated unanimously.\nIn the general election, Denney ended up defeating Lynch by a wide margin, largely mirroring the margin in the presidential election, winning 56% of the vote to Lynch's 43%.\nGeneral election\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Delaware House Journal, 98th General Assembly, 1st Reg.
