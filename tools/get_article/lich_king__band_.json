The band was started to honor the thrash metal sound of the 1980s and they were inspired by bands such as Slayer, D.R.I, and Exodus. Lich King's songs generally have a humorous tone. Martin left the band in 2015 with the statement that \"I solemnly pronounce thrash metal dead\" due to the instability of being a touring band and the low income. The band has found a new vocalist and has continued performing live and releasing new albums such as The Omniclasm in 2017. The band has had tours in countries such as Germany, Australia, and New Zealand.\nMembers\nCurrent members\n* Tom Martin – vocals (2004–2015), songwriting (2004–present)\n* Brian Westbrook – drums, percussion, songwriting (2004–present)\n* Joe Nickerson – bass (2004–2010), rhythm guitar (2011–present)\n* Nick Timney – bass (2013–2014), lead guitar (2015–present)\n* Mike Dreher – bass (2015–present)\n* Zachary Smith – vocals (2017–present)\nFormer members\n* Erick Herrera – guitar (2004–2010)\n* Kevin Taylor – guitar (2004–2010)\n* Dave Hughes – bass (2011–2013)\n* Rob Pellegri – lead guitar (2011–2015)\n* Ryan Taylor – vocals (2015–2017)\nTimeline\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2005\nScaleMajor = increment:2 start:2004\nLegend     = position:bottom  orientation:vertical columns:3\nColors =\nid:vocals   value:red             legend:Vocals\nid:lguitar  value:teal            legend:Lead_guitar\nid:rguitar  value:brightgreen     legend:Rhythm_guitar\nid:bass     value:blue            legend:Bass\nid:writing  value:gray(0.5)       legend:Songwriting\nid:drums    value:orange          legend:Drums\nid:album    value:black           legend:Studio_Album\nid:other    value:gray(0.7)       legend:Other_release\nid:bars     value:gray(0.95)\nBackgroundColors = bars:bars\nLineData =\nlayer:back\ncolor:album\nat:08/25/2007\nat:12/01/2008\nat:04/28/2010\nat:04/01/2011\nat:09/28/2012\nat:04/14/2017\ncolor:other\nat:08/21/2006\nat:12/25/2014\nBarData =\nbar:Martin       text:\"Tom Martin\"\nbar:RTaylor      text:\"Ryan Taylor\"\nbar:Smith        text:\"Zachary Smith\"\nbar:Taylor       text:\"Kevin Taylor\"\nbar:Pelligri     text:\"Rob Pelligri\"\nbar:Herrera      text:\"Erick Herrera\"\nbar:Nickerson    text:\"Joe Nickerson\"\nbar:Hughes       text:\"Dave Hughes\"\nbar:Timney       text:\"Nick Timney\"\nbar:Dreher       text:\"Mike Dreher\"\nbar:Westbrook    text:\"Brian Westbrook\"\nPlotData =\nwidth:11\nbar:Martin       from:start till:04/01/2015      color:vocals\nbar:Martin       from:start till:04/01/2015      color:writing width:3\nbar:Martin       from:04/01/2015 till:end        color:writing\nbar:RTaylor      from:04/01/2015 till:07/01/2017 color:vocals\nbar:Smith        from:07/01/2017 till:end        color:vocals\nbar:Taylor       from:start      till:12/31/2010 color:lguitar\nbar:Pelligri     from:01/01/2011 till:04/01/2015 color:lguitar\nbar:Timney       from:04/01/2015 till:end        color:lguitar\nbar:Herrera      from:start till:12/31/2010      color:rguitar\nbar:Nickerson    from:start      till:12/31/2010 color:bass\nbar:Nickerson    from:01/01/2011 till:end        color:rguitar\nbar:Hughes       from:01/01/2011 till:04/01/2013 color:bass\nbar:Timney       from:04/01/2013 till:04/01/2015 color:bass\nbar:Dreher       from:04/01/2015 till:end        color:bass\nbar:Westbrook    from:start      till:end        color:drums\n}}\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n* Necromantic Maelstrom (2007)\n* Toxic Zombie Onslaught (2008)\n* World Gone Dead (2010)\n* Super Retro Thrash (2011)\n* Born of the Bomb (2012)\n* The Omniclasm (2017)\nDemos\n* Necromantic Maelstrom (2006)\nExtended plays\n* Do-Over (2014)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
