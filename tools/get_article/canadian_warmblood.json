Admission to the stud-book is based on both performance and parentage: a horse must have in its pedigree at least one from a list of twenty-five influential European warmblood stallions foaled between 1840 and 1926, and must also pass a Keuring or performance inspection.\nA breed association, the Canadian Warmblood Horse Breeders Association, was established in 1991; it is a member of the World Breeding Federation for Sport Horses.\nIt is a distinct and separate breed from the Canadian Sport Horse.\nReferences\n.
