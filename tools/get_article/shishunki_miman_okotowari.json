When she meets up with her half-siblings completely by coincidence, she learns that even they have never seen or even met their father.  Asuka comes to stay at the Sudou residence with her younger brother and sister in hopes they will be one day reunited with their estranged father.\nZoku Shishunki Miman Okotowari\nAfter learning that Yashiro-sensei's true name is Takashi Sudou, Asuka has at last found her biological father.  However, the three siblings also discover that Yashiro-sensei is actually the father of only Asuka and Kazusa; Manato's father was the real Yashiro and he has no blood relation to either Asuka or Kazusa.  Takashi Sudou took on Yashiro's name after his senpai (Yashiro) died and adopted Yashiro's son, Manato, as well.\nShishunki Miman Okotowari Kanketsuhen\nThe concluding chapter to the Shishunki series. Two other bonus stories are contained in this one volume edition.\nCharacters\n;\n: A reformed bad girl who now only dreams of meeting her father after her mother dies of an illness.  She is very athletic and is particularly good at gymnastics.  When she discovers she has two half-siblings, Manato and Kazusa, she immediately takes on the role of a reliable and protective older sister.\n;\n: He was thought to be Asuka's half-brother but it turns out that he was the son of Yashiro-sensei's best friend. Like Asuka, Manato once ran in a gang, but has somewhat reformed himself.  He has looked after Kazusa ever since they were children, which is why he is naturally very protective of her.\n;\n: Asuka's half-sister, who utterly despises her older sister for butting into her cozy little life with Manato. She has a serious brother complex and will do anything to keep Manato from accepting Asuka as their sister.\n;\n:A bad boy in general, Hayami has been interested in Kazusa up until he got beat up by Asuka for intimidating Kazusa.  He soon develops an unrequited crush on Asuka.\n;\n:The school class president and captain of the gymnastics club.
