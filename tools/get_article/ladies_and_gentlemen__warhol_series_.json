Commissioned by Italian dealer Luciano Anselmino in 1974, the paintings depict Black American and Latinx transgender women and drag queens. The series consists of 284 silkscreen prints.\nBackground\nIn May 1974, Andy Warhol was approached by Italian dealer Luciano Anselmino in Torino about commissioning a series of large-edition prints and maybe paintings. Anselmino recommended that Warhol paint portraits of drag queens. According to Bob Colacello, who was the editor Interview magazine, Warhol said, \"'Drag queens were out,' but Anselmino persisted, suggesting portraits of Candy, Jackie, and Holly. Andy said Candy was dead, and Jackie and Holly would drive him crazy, asking for more money every time they heard one had sold.\" Anselmino was asked by Warhol to come up with another idea, but later that day he brought up drag queens once more and said, \"They shouldn't be beautiful transvestites who could pass for women, but funny-looking ones, with beards, who were obviously men trying to pass.\" Warhol reluctantly agreed and suggested that he could photograph Colacello. Even though Warhol offered to give him a portrait, Colacello insisted that he didn't want to be immortalized in drag.\nDuring another trip to Europe in July 1974, Warhol's manager Fred Hughes brought Anselmino along. Anselmino informed Warhol that he had secured funding for the Drag Queen series, several hundred thousand dollars, as well as a museum in Ferrera, the Palazzo dei Diamanti, to display it. Upson returning to New York later that month, Colacello posed in drag for Warhol at the Factory, but Warhol decided the photos were \"unusable.\"\nColacello along with Warhol's assistant Ronnie Cutrone, and Vincent Fremont, the manager of the Factory, and makeup artist Corey Tippin found models for the series at the Gilded Grape, which was popular nightclub in the queer community, near Times Square in New York. They would ask potential models to pose for \"a friend\" for $50 per half-hour. The following day, they would show up at the Factory, where Warhol, whom they never named, would take their Polaroids. Some of the models would say, \"Tell your friend I do a lot more for fifty bucks\" the following time they saw them at the Gilded Grape.\nWarhol began creating the silkscreens for the Ladies and Gentlemen series toward the end of the year. On December 28, 1974, he was captured on videotape painting a portrait at the Factory. Shortly after, it was reported that Warhol was working on a series of portraits of transvestites.\nSubjects\nWarhol took over 500 photographs of 14 models. An official list of the Ladies and Gentlemen artworks was released by the Warhol Foundation in 2014. This included 13 names that they could identify:\n* Marsha P. Johnson\n* Alphanso Panell\n* Iris\n* Wilhelmina Ross\n* Broadway\n* Easha McCleary\n* Helen/Harry Morales\n* Ivette\n* Kim\n* Lurdes\n* Michele Long\n* Monique and Vicki Peters\nExhibitions\nA few portraits from the series were included in the retrospective of Warhol's artwork, Andy Warhol: Paintings 1962-1975, at the Baltimore Museum of Art in Maryland from July 1975 to September 1975.\nThe complete series was displayed at the Palazzo dei Diamanti in Ferrara from October 1975 to December 1975. An accompanying book of prints, Ladies and Gentlemen, was published by Gabriele Mazzotta in Milan.\nTwo portraits from the series were included in an exhibition of Warhol's artwork at the Greenberg Gallery in Clayton, Missouri from October 1975 to December 1975.\nLadies and Gentlemen was mounted at Galerie Bischofberger in Zurich, and at the gallery's St. Moritz location, from February 1976 to March 1976.\nIn 1994, the Baltimore Museum of Art acquired two portraits from the series.\nIn 2020, the series was shown at the Tate Modern in London.\nBibliography\n*\nReferences"
