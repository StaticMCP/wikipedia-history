The baton carries a message from the Head of the Commonwealth, currently King Charles III. The relay traditionally begins at Buckingham Palace in London, where the King entrusts the baton to the first relay runner. At the opening ceremony of the Games, the final relay runner hands the torch back to the King or his representative, who reads the message aloud to officially open the Games. The King's Baton Relay is similar to the Olympic Torch Relay.\nStarted as the '''Queen's Baton Relay for the 1958 Games, the relay has been included in every games ever since. Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II in 2022, King Charles III became the Head of the Commonwealth, leading to the relay being renamed as the King's Baton Relay''' for the 2026 Commonwealth Games.\nHistory\nAt the inaugural games, held in 1930 in Hamilton, Ontario, a message from King George V was read to the competitors. In 1936, Australian runner Rowley Bateman proposed a relay from Canberra to Sydney carrying a goodwill message for the 1938 Sydney games. A baton relay from Mountain Ash to Pontypridd to commemorate the centenary of the Welsh national anthem was organised in 1956 by athletics official Bernard Baldwin, who proposed something similar for the finale of the Commonwealth Games. Baldwin later founded the traditional New Year's Eve race 'Nos Galan' in Mountain Ash.\nThe Relay has been involved in every games since the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff, Wales. The Relay for the 1998 Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia was the first to incorporate a more expansive relay to other nations of the Commonwealth. The 2002 Commonwealth Games Relay covered over  and went through 23 nations.\nRather than beginning at Buckingham Palace, the 1970 relay began in at Yellowknife in Canada's Northwest Territories before the baton was flown to Scotland.\nEditions\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%;\" | Year\n! style=\"width:20%;\" | Relay\n! style=\"width:75%;\"| Description\n|-\n|1958\n|'''Queen's Baton Relay\nfor the\nVI British Empire and Commonwealth Games'''\nCardiff, Wales\n|The 1958 silver-gilt and enamel baton was designed by Cardiff jeweller and former soldier, Colonel Roy Crouch, Chairman of the Games' Medals Committee.

On opening ceremony night the Queen's Baton began its journey to the stadium by elephant. The baton was presented to Prince Edward by Malaysia's 1950 Commonwealth weightlifting gold medallist Koh Eng Tong.

The Final Baton Runner Sushil Kumar handed over the baton to Prince Charles, who with President Pratibha Patil opened the Games.\nThe baton was designed by Michael Foley, a graduate of the National Institute of Design.

The baton also incorporated a video camera and microphone, LED lighting (which set its color scheme to match the flag of the nation it was travelling through), and GPS tracking.\n|-\n|2014\n|'''Queen's Baton Relay\nfor the\nXX Commonwealth Games\nGlasgow, Scotland\n|The 2014 Queen's Baton Relay''' began its  journey on 9 October 2013. The baton traveled via 70 nations and territories over 288 days before opening the games on 23 July 2014. At the ceremony, 32 inspiring volunteers from across Scotland carried the baton around Celtic Park Stadium after being nominated for giving their time to developing the nation's youth through sport. The baton was then passed to Sir Chris Hoy, who delivered it to President of the Commonwealth Games Federation Prince Imran and the Queen who then declared the Games open. The BBC provided coverage of the relay. Adventurer Mark Beaumont presented a series of documentaries filmed on the relay for BBC One Scotland, there were also weekly updates for BBC News and a BBC News website and blog written by Mark.\nThe product design consultancy awarded the contract to the design of the 2014 Queen's Baton is a local Glasgow company called 4c Design. 4c Design wanted the 2014 baton to be true to the original intentions of the first relay and so wanted to focus the design around the Queen's handwritten message. Also rather than using cutting edge electronics, they choose to focus on cutting edge manufacturing. This all culminated in the Queen's message being internally illuminated to hint at the secret within, then surrounded by a titanium lattice framework that was grown using the latest additive manufacturing technology. At the top is a puzzle mechanism that dispenses granite gemstones to each of the Commonwealth nations and territories the baton visits, inviting them to join Glasgow at the Games. The puzzle mechanism also has a second function of keeping the message safely locked away until the opening ceremony, where the second stage of the puzzle will be unveiled. The handle of the Queen's Baton is made of Elm wood which came from the Isle of Cumbrae in Scotland. The Elm tree was felled by a local man called David Stevenson in the grounds of the Garrison House and the baton itself is crafted using an old boat building technique called bird mouthing.\n|-\n|2018\n|\n'''Queen's Baton Relay\nfor the\nXXI Commonwealth Games\nGold Coast, Australia\n|The 2018 Queen's Baton Relay''' was launched on Commonwealth Day, 13 March 2017, on the historic forecourt at Buckingham Palace, signalling the official countdown to the start of the Games.
