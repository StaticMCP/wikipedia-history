It is the smallest member of the family Proteidae.\nDescription\nThis species is usually between  long. It has bushy, narrow gills and a compressed tail. All feet have four toes. The salamander is uniform slate gray to brown or dark olive dorsally and dirty white ventrally. Most individuals have no dorsal spots; when the dorsal spots are present, the venter is unspotted (unlike in Necturus lewisi, which is also a larger species). Juveniles are uniformly brown dorsally (as opposed to striped, as in other juvenile Necturus).\nGeographic range\nNecturus punctatus is found on the Atlantic coastal plain and the Piedmont of the eastern United States, from southeastern Virginia to southcentral Georgia. Populations further west into Alabama and Florida represent another, undescribed species.\nHabitat\nDwarf waterdogs live in slow, sand- or mud-bottomed streams and connected ditches, cypress swamps; also stream-fed rice fields and mill ponds. They prefer bottoms with leaf litter and other detritus. During winter juveniles burrow into bottom and adults in leaf beds.\nConservation\nNecturus punctatus is not considered threatened—it has a relatively wide range, with viable populations through most of it. It is not facing major threats, and it is present in several protected areas.\n}}"
