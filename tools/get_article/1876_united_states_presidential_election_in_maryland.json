Maryland voters chose eight representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nMaryland was won by Samuel J. Tilden, the former governor of New York (D–New York), running with Thomas A. Hendricks, the governor of Indiana and future vice president, with 56.05% of the popular vote, against Rutherford B. Hayes, the governor of Ohio (R-Ohio), running with Representative William A. Wheeler, with 43.95% of the vote.\nNotably, this is the closest any Democrat has come to winning the solidly Republican Garrett County since it was first formed in 1872. This is also the first Presidential election that Garrett County was able to vote in, as it was formed on November 4, 1872.\nIn this election, Maryland voted 9.09% more Democratic than the nation at-large.\nResults\nResults by county\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n! rowspan=\"2\" |County\n! colspan=\"2\"  |Samuel J.
