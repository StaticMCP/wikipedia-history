The objective of these forces was to destroy the oil fields and delay capture of the Kuching airfield. The plans were drawn up in August 1941, so that surplus equipment was shipped out, the Miri field closed down, the wells at Seria cemented in, and one of the Lutong refineries shut down. On 8 December, final demolition commenced, and Miri troops were evacuated to Kuching on 13 Dec.\nInvasion\n, 14 January 1942.]]\nOn 13 December, the Kiyotake Kawaguchi's Kawaguchi Detachment left Cam Ranh Bay for Borneo with the objective of capturing Miri and then Kuching. Included in this detachment was an oil drilling group of about 150 oil engineers for the restoration of the Miri and Seria oil fields. On 16 December, they landed near Miri. On 25 December, the Kuching airfield was captured, after British troops under Lane retreated into Dutch West Borneo. On 7 January, the 2/15 Punjab Regiment defended the approach to Sanggau airfield, before being forced to retreat. Then on 28 January, Ledo airfield was captured, when the Kuching airfield was determined to be unusable for their navy land-based planes.\nDutch Martin B-10 bombers attacked Japanese shipping from their base, 'Singkawang II' at Miri, on 17 December, but their attempt failed. The three Dornier Do 24Ks followed up with their own attack, but one was shot down, possibly by a floatplane from Kamikawa Maru. The remaining two, benefiting from cloud cover, were never seen by the Japanese. One flying boat scored two 200&nbsp;kg bomb hits on , causing a massive explosion, while a near miss ruptured its hull plating. The destroyer's stern broke off and the ship sank within minutes.\nOn 22 December, a Japanese convoy left Miri for Kuching, but was spotted by the Dutch flying boat X-35, which radioed a warning to the Dutch submarine , under the command of Lieutenant Commander Carel A. J. van Groeneveld. At 20:40 on 23 December, K XIV infiltrated the convoy and began its attack. The army transports Hiyoshi Maru and Katori Maru were sunk with the loss of hundreds of troops.  was beached to prevent her from sinking, and another transport was less seriously damaged.\nOn the night of 23–24 December, HNLMS K XVI torpedoed the Japanese destroyer Sagiri  north of Kuching, becoming the first Allied submarine in the Pacific to sink a warship. K XVI was lost with all hands during the day by a torpedo from Japanese submarine I66.\nOn 24 and 28 December, B-10 bombers from a different unit flew missions against Kuching from Singapore, Sembawang. On 26 December, B-10s operating out of Samarinda sank a Japanese minesweeper and a collier.\nBy 1 February, all of British Borneo was under Japanese control.\n(ABDACOM) area, with Borneo just left of centre.]]\nReferences\n* Runciman, S., The White Rajahs: A History of Sarawak from 1841 to 1946, particularly 252–5.
