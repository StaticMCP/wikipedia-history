Retinue pheromone may be more accurate because the chemical mix in the pheromone comes from several glands.\nThe following compounds have been identified as present in the QRP, of which, only coniferyl alcohol is found in the mandibular glands. The combination of the five QMP compounds and the four compounds below help create the retinue attraction of worker bees around their queen.\n* Methyl oleate\n* Coniferyl alcohol\n* Hexadecan-1-ol\n* Alpha-linolenic acid\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.pherobase.com/database/genus/genus-Apis.php Semiochemicals of Genus Apis], at pherobase.com\n\n---\n\n## Queen Retinue Pheromone\n\n#REDIRECT Queen retinue pheromone"
