The increase had been planned to become effective in 2015 but was brought forward one year.\nBefore the 2012 budget, the rate of corporation tax in the UK was 26%. In his 2013 budget, Osborne announced another reduction in the rate in 2015 to 20%. The reductions would be offset by the bank levy.\nNew employment allowances will cut National Insurance bills for all UK firms, and 450,000 small businesses should pay no employer NI. Tax reliefs were also announced for investment in social enterprises, and Osborne axed a stamp duty on shares traded on growth markets such as the Alternative Investment Market.\nOsborne cancelled an increase in fuel duty that had been planned for September 2013, and also cancelled a 3p increase in duty on beer planned for April 2013, instead cutting the beer duty by 1p from 24 March 2013. The duty escalator on beer was also cancelled, but remains in place for wine, spirits and cider. Duties on cigarettes were unchanged.\nTax incentives were announced for ultra low-emission vehicles and for investment in shale gas.\nThe Staffordshire Potteries industry will be exempt from the Climate Change Levy.\nTaxes\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The OBR cut its forecast for economic growth in 2013 to 0.6% from 1.2%. It forecast growth to be 1.8% in 2014, 2.3% in 2015, 2.7% in 2016, and 2.8% in 2017.\nThe OBR predicted government borrowing of £121 billion in 2013 and £120 billion for 2014. Government debt as a share of gross domestic product was forecast to increase from 75.9% in 2013 to 85.6% in 2016.\nThe majority of the other business tax changes announced impact small businesses, now receiving the benefits of the National Insurance Contribution. SMEs will also benefit from a certain number of reliefs such as capital gains relief on Seed Enterprise Investment Schemes and stamp duty relief from trading AIM-listed shares, which will help them raise capital. As for larger companies, the advantages of the new budget and incentives will be focused on Research and Development.\nPublic procurement\nThe budget announced the government's intention to use the procurement process to promote suppliers' tax compliance.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21686265 2013 Budget coverage] at the BBC\n*[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/budget-2013 2013 Budget coverage] at The Guardian\n*[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/budget/ 2013 Budget coverage] at The Telegraph"
