      "text": "# In Dubious Battle\n\nIn Dubious Battle is a novel by John Steinbeck, written in 1936. The central figure of the story is an activist attempting to organize abused laborers in order to gain fair wages and working conditions.\nPrior to publication, Steinbeck wrote in a letter:\nThis is the first time I have felt that I could take the time to write and also that I had anything to say to anything except my manuscript book. You remember that I had an idea that I was going to write the autobiography of a Communist ... There lay the trouble. I had planned to write a journalistic account of a strike. But as I thought of it as fiction the thing got bigger and bigger. It couldn't be that. I've been living with this thing for some time now. I don't know how much I have got over, but I have used a small strike in an orchard valley as the symbol of man's eternal, bitter warfare with himself.\nExplanation of the novel's title\nThe title is a reference to a passage from John Milton's Paradise Lost:\nInnumerable force of Spirits armed,\nThat durst dislike his reign, and, me preferring,\nHis utmost power with adverse power opposed\nIn dubious battle on the plains of Heaven\nAnd shook his throne. What though the field be lost?\nAll is not lost—the unconquerable will,\nAnd study of revenge, immortal hate,\nAnd courage never to submit or yield:\nAnd what is else not to be overcome?\nPlot summary\nIn Dubious Battle deals with a fruit-workers' strike in a California valley and the attempts of labor unions to organize, lead, and provide for the striking pickers.\nJim Nolan meets Harry Nilson who initiates Jim's application process to become the newest member of the Communist Party. Mac \"Doc\" McLeod, the Party organizer, tells Jim they will go to the Torgas Valley (a composite location) in an attempt to rouse the two thousand fruit pickers against the Growers' Association, and to encourage the strike to spill over into the cotton fields in Tandale.\nMomentum for strike action builds after old Dan breaks two rungs out of a ladder and falls. London becomes chairman of a committee of seven men, while Mac convinces Al Anderson's father to loan five acres as a base for the fruit pickers in exchange for them picking his crop for free. Doc Burton is hired by Mac to maintain the sanitation of the strikers' camp, so as to prevent it from being disbanded by the Red Cross.\nThe course of the strike is recounted in some detail, including the politics of the local growers, the support by Al through his little luncheonette, the \"sweet-talking\" of some locals in order to garner food and other help for the pickers, and personal crises and tragedies in individual cases. Mac emerges as a heroic but quite single-minded figure; Jim's occasional doubts are presented as well.\nJim joins Sam in a picket as they go after some 'scabs' in the apple orchard. Sam's pickets violently injure them. While out on the road Dakin, the leader of the pickers, is ambushed by a vigilante group at gunpoint. Later, the Anderson barn is burned down by vigilantes. In the aftermath, Jim is killed by a high powered shotgun. As the book ends, Mac is continuing to rouse and motivate the picketers, in spite of seemingly hopeless odds.\nCharacters\n*Doc Burton – A doctor who, despite his skepticism of leftist views, works in the strikers' camp, ensuring that it cannot be disbanded on the basis of a lack of sanitation.\n*Jim Nolan– New member of the \"Party,\" whose political development is one of the book's central themes.

March compared it to the \"genial gusto\" of the \"picaresque\" Tortilla Flat. He commented that \"You would never know that In Dubious Battle was by the same John Steinbeck if the publishers did not tell you so.\" He called it \"courageous and desperately honest,\"  \"the best labor and strike novel to come out of our contemporary economic and social unrest,\" and \"such a novel as Sinclair Lewis at his best might have done had he gone on with his projected labor novel...\"\nIn 1943, with Steinbeck now famous, Carlos Baker \"revalued\" the novel. He opened by saying \"Among Steinbeck's best novels, the least known is probably In Dubious Battle.\" Steinbeck, he said, \"is supremely interested in what happens to men's minds and hearts when they function, not as responsible, self-governing individuals, but as members of a group.... Biologists have a word for this very important problem; they call it bionomics, or ecology.\" He said that \"Steinbeck's bionomic interest is visible in all that he has done, from Tortilla Flat, in the middle Thirties, through his semi-biological Sea of Cortez, to his latest communiqués as a war correspondent in England.\" He characterized In Dubious Battle as \"an attempt to study a typical mid-depression strike in bionomic terms.\"\nIn 1958, critic Alfred Kazin referred to In Dubious Battle and The Grapes of Wrath as \"his most powerful books,\" contrasting them with Cannery Row and The Wayward Bus.  President Barack Obama told the New York Times that it was his favorite book by Steinbeck.\nThe novel likely recounts a fruit worker strike that occurred in Tulare County, California.\nFilm adaptation\nOn January 30, 2015, it was announced that James Franco would direct and star in a film version of the novel. The screenplay was written by Matt Rager and will be produced by AMBI Productions, Rabbit Bandini Productions, and That's Hollywood Productions. The film stars Nat Wolff in the lead role, along with Josh Hutcherson, Bryan Cranston, Robert Duvall, Ed Harris, Selena Gomez, and others. Principal photography began on March 19, 2015 in Atlanta and Bostwick, Georgia. Additional footage was shot in orchards West of Yakima, Washington September 27 and 28, 2015. The film was released in theaters in the United States on February 17, 2017.\nSee also\n*California agricultural strikes of 1933\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\"In Dubious Battle and Other Recent Works of Fiction,\" Fred T.
