The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), organised a public selection process to determine its entry for the contest, A Song for Europe 2002. Eight acts competed in the national final which consisted of a semi-final and a final, during which the winner was selected entirely through a public televote.\nAs a member of the \"Big Four\", the United Kingdom automatically qualified to compete in the final of the Eurovision Song Contest. Performing in position 2, the United Kingdom placed third out of the 24 participating countries with 111 points.\nBackground\nPrior to the 2002 contest, British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest representing the United Kingdom forty-four times. Thus far, it has won the contest five times: in  with the song \"Puppet on a String\" performed by Sandie Shaw, in  with the song \"Boom Bang-a-Bang\" performed by Lulu, in  with \"Save Your Kisses for Me\" performed by Brotherhood of Man, in  with the song \"Making Your Mind Up\" performed by Bucks Fizz, and in  with the song \"Love Shine a Light\" performed by Katrina and the Waves. To this point, the nation is noted for having finished as the runner-up in a record fifteen contests. Up to and including , it had only twice finished outside the top 10,  and . Since 1999, the year in which the rule was abandoned that songs must be performed in one of the official languages of the country participating, the UK has had less success, having yet to finish within the top ten. , \"No Dream Impossible\" performed by Lindsay Dracass finished in fifteenth place out of twenty-three competing entries.\nAs part of its duties as participating broadcaster, the BBC organises the selection of its entry in the Eurovision Song Contest and broadcasts the event in the country. The broadcaster announced that it would participate in the 2002 contest on 13 August 2001. The BBC has traditionally organised a national final featuring a competition among several artists and songs to choose its entry for Eurovision. For its 2002 entry, the broadcaster announced that a national final involving a public vote would be held to select the entry.\nBefore Eurovision\nA Song for Europe 2002\nA Song for Europe 2002 was the national final developed by the BBC in order to select its entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2002. Eight acts competed in the competition which consisted of a radio semi-final on 1 February 2002 and a televised final on 3 March 2002. The semi-final was broadcast on BBC Radio 2, while the final was broadcast on BBC One.\nCompeting entries\nOn 31 July 2001, BBC together with the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA) announced an open submission for interested songwriters to submit their songs. All composers and lyricists were required to be British citizens or residents in the United Kingdom for three years prior to the Eurovision Song Contest 2002. A fee was also imposed on songs being submitted to the national final: £47 for BASCA members, £70.5 for non-BASCA members and £11.75 for songwriters under the age of 17 by 1 May 2002. The submission period lasted until 19 October 2001. More than 550 received submissions were reviewed by various panels of music publishers, songwriters and record label professionals, following which a 20-song shortlist was compiled by BASCA and presented to the BBC which ultimately selected eight semi-finalists to compete in the national final in December 2001. The eight competing songs were premiered during The Ken Bruce Show and Wake Up to Wogan on BBC Radio 2 between 28 and 31 January 2002.\nShows\nSemi-final\nEight acts competed in the radio semi-final which was hosted by Terry Wogan and Ken Bruce during Wake Up to Wogan on 1 February 2002. A public vote consisting of televoting and online voting, which registered over 20,000 votes, selected the top four songs that proceeded to the final. Before the semi-final, the public was able to cast their votes online starting from 28 January 2002.\nOn 6 February 2002, the BBC announced that one of the finalists, \"Never in a Million Years\" performed by Zee, had been disqualified as the song was published on a compilation album in Hungary in June 2001. \"Every Step of the Way\" performed by Level Best, which came fifth in the semi-final, was selected as the replacement finalist. Another semi-finalist, \"Lovestruck\" performed by Honey Trap, was also set to be discussed by the BBC regarding a potential disqualification as it was claimed to be almost identical to a song with the same title, performed by Swedish singer Kinnda. The song was eventually not disqualified as it was ultimately eliminated from the semi-final.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|+ Semi-final – 1 February 2002\n|-\n!
