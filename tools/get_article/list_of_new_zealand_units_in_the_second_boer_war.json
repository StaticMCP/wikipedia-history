The British Government accepted the offer by Richard Seddonthe Premier of New Zealandfor troops, and so the country became the first British colony to volunteer forces for the war. A total of ten contingents departed for South Africa between October 1899 and April 1902. The volunteers of the first two contingents were mainly members of New Zealand's existing permanent or voluntary forces and were expected to supply their own equipment and horses. The Third and Fourth Contingents were organised by regional politicians and businesspeople: the Third organised mainly from Canterbury, and the Fourth from Otago. These two Contingents were also largely paid for through local fundraising rather than central government, and together they became known as the Rough Riders. The remaining contingents were funded by the British Government. The Boer War was the first overseas conflict to involve New Zealand troops, and was the first conflict the nation was involved in since the New Zealand Wars had ceased in the early 1870s. Over 6500 New Zealand soldiers served in South Africa with the units suffering 230 casualtiesmost of those from either accident or disease.\nContingents\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+New Zealand units of the Second Boer War\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Departed\n! scope=\"col\" | Strength\n! scope=\"col\" | Commander\n! scope=\"col\" | Notes\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | First Contingent\n|| 21 October 1899 from Wellington\n|| 215\n|| Major Alfred William Robin\n||\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Second Contingent\n|| 20 January 1900 from Wellington\n|| 266\n|| Major Montagu Cradock\n|| Included a Hotchkiss machine gun detachment\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Third Contingent\n|| 17 February 1900 from Lyttelton\n|| 262\n||\n||\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Fourth Contingent\n||\n|| 462\n||\n* Major Joe Sommerville (North Island)}}\n|| Divided into four Companies: 7th and 8th from the North Island, 9th and 10th from Otago and Southland\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Fifth Contingent\n|| 31 March 1900 from Wellington and Lyttelton\n|| 591\n|| Lieutenant-Colonel Stuart Newall\n||\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Sixth Contingent\n|| 30 January 1901 from Auckland\n|| 602\n|| Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Henry Banks\n||\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Seventh Contingent\n|| 6 April 1901 from Wellington\n|| 667\n|| Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas William Porter\n||\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Eighth Contingent\n||\n|| 1120\n|| Colonel Richard Hutton Davies\n|| Divided into two regiments: North Island and South Island\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Ninth Contingent\n||\n|| 1071\n||\n|| Divided into two regiments: North Island and South Island\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Tenth Contingent\n||\n|| 1251\n||\n|| Divided into two regiments: North Island and South Island\n|}\nSee also\n* Military history of New Zealand\n* List of Second Boer War Victoria Cross recipients\nCitations\nReferences\n*\n*  }}\n* }}\n*\n*  }}\nExternal sources\n*[https://nzhistory.govt.nz/war/new-zealand-in-the-south-african-boer-war/database?field_reg_no_value=&field_surname_0_value=&field_given_names_value=&field_county_city_value=&field_next_of_kin_value= Embarkation database with every New Zealand soldier who joined the New Zealand contingents]"
