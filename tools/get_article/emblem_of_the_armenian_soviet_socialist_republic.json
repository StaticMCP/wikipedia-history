The white grapes shown immediately beneath Ararat represent the traditional Biblical account of the first vineyard that Noah planted upon his descent from his ark as a sign of rebirth of humanity. The inner rim on the sides of the grapes includes wheat, symbolic of the land and natural resources of Armenia. Above Mount Ararat is the hammer and sickle with the red star behind it.\nPrinted on the outer rim are the words \"Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic\" in Armenian (Հայկական Սովետական Սոցիալիստական Հանրապետություն Haykakan Sovetakan Sots’ialistakan Hanrapetut’yun) while in the center outer rim is the motto \"Workers of the world, unite!\" in both Armenian (Պրոլետարներ բոլոր երկրների, միացե՜ք Proletarner bolor yerkrneri, miats’ek’!) and Russian (Пролетарии всех стран, соединяйтесь! Proletarii vsekh stran, soyedinyaytes′!).\nAccording to an account (anecdote) widely reported since the 1920s,   Turkey raised the issue of Ararat being on Soviet Armenia's coat of arms with the Soviet Union. The Soviet response, attributed to Foreign Commissar Georgy Chicherin, pointed out that Turkey's flag features a crescent moon despite Turkey not owning the moon. Later sources described it as likely apocryphal. The account is mentioned in the memoirs of Nikita Khrushchev.\nThe emblem was changed in 1992 to the present coat of arms of Armenia which partially retains the Soviet one, in this case, the Mount Ararat.\nHistory\nFirst revision\nThe Constitution of the Armenian SSR, adopted by the First Congress of the Soviets of Armenia on February 2, 1922, approved the description of the coat of arms of Armenian SSR. The emblem was an image of the ridges of the Greater and Lesser Masis (Ararat), over which, in the rays of the rising sun, there was a sickle and a hammer, at the foot - a bush of grapes with vines and leaves, ears of wheat, olive branches. Around the coat of arms on the margins there were inscriptions in Armenian \"The Socialist Soviet Republic of Armenia\" and \"Proletarians of all countries, unite!\"\nThe name of the republic in Armenian on the coat of arms of 1922 was read as \"Hayastani Socialist Khordhayin Hanrapetutiun\" (Socialist Soviet Republic of Armenia).\nThe image of the arms was made by Martiros Saryan and Hakob Kojoyan.\nOn banknotes of the Socialist Soviet Republic of Armenia in 1922, the version of the emblem was depicted. The abbreviation of the republic's name was placed in the upper part of the emblem in the rays of the sun, below the background of the mountains a sickle and a hammer, under them is the motto. On banknotes of 5.000.000 rubles of the same year, 1922, the image of a round coat of arms was used as a background, where the hammer and sickle were already depicted above the mountains.\nAnother revision on the emblem can be found on the Constitution of Armenian SSR, which was created on 26 May 1926 and approved by the 5th Congress of the Soviets of the USSR, April 3, 1927. The coat of arms is described as:\nSecond revision\nIn 1927, the order of words in the name of the republic changed. The \"Socialist Soviet Republic of Armenia\" was replaced by the \"Armenian Socialist Soviet Republic\".\nThird revision\nThe extraordinary IX Congress of Soviets of the Armenian SSR adopted on March 23, 1937, a new Constitution. The coat of arms was changed: an olive wreath was replaced with grain ears, the disk of the rising sun and its rays were removed from the picture, the sickle and hammer were illuminated with a five-pointed star, the inscription \"Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic\" (\"Hayastani Socialist Khordhayin Hanrapetutiun\", HSKH in Armenian) and \"Workers of all countries, unite!\" (in Armenian and Russian languages).\nFourth revision\nThe decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Armenian SSR of September 6, 1940, established a new translation of the words \"countries\" in the Armenian language in the motto of the emblem, and on March 29, 1941, the design of the emblem with the new version of the motto was approved.\nOn the coat of arms, the Armenian words of \"Soviet\" and \"republic\" were changed. A new version of the name of the republic in Armenian: \"Haykakan Sovetakan Sotsialistakan Respublika\" (HSSR).\nFifth revision\nSince 1966, the word \"Republic\" has been translated again into the old language until the end of the Armenian SSR and for the first time, the Republic of Armenia had the inscription \"Haykakan Sovetakan Socialistan Hanrapetutiun\" (HSSH) on the coat of arms.\nArticle 120 of the Constitution of the Armenian SSR described the arms of the Republic as follows:\nIn the Constitution of 1977 it was specified that the rays on the coat of arms are sunny.\nSee also\n*Coat of arms of Armenia\n*Flag of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic\nReferences\n;Notes\n;Citations"
