He served as Assistant Secretary from 1861 to 1869 when his father, William H. Seward, was the Secretary of State under both Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson, and then from 1877 to 1879 in the administration of Rutherford B. Hayes.\nEarly life\nSeward was born in Auburn, New York on July 8, 1830.  He was the son of Frances Adeline (née Miller) and William H. Seward, who shortly became a New York State Senator, and later the 12th governor of New York, a U.S. Senator, and the 24th U.S. Secretary of State). Frederick was the younger brother of Augustus Henry Seward and the elder brother of General William H. Seward Jr. and Fanny Seward.\nHis maternal grandfather was Judge Elijah Miller and his paternal grandfather was Judge Samuel S. Seward, who was also a physician and a member of the New York State Assembly.\nFrom 1839 to 1840, while his father was Governor of New York State, Frederick attended the Pearl Street Academy in Albany, New York.  He graduated from Union College in 1849 and studied law with Henry E. Davies and William Kent. In 1851, he was admitted to the bar in Rochester, New York.  In 1878, Union awarded him an honorary LL.D. degree.\nCareer\nAfter graduating from college, Seward served as a secretary to his father from 1849 to 1857, and served as associate editor of the Albany Evening Journal from 1851 to 1861.\nBaltimore Plot\n1861–1865]]\nOn February 21, 1861, Seward arrived at the Continental Hotel in Philadelphia carrying a letter from his father for President-elect Lincoln. The letter contained information gathered by Colonel Charles Pomeroy Stone and General Winfield Scott.\nStone had stationed three detectives from the New York police department in Baltimore to gather information about plots against Lincoln. Making his way by train from Illinois to Washington for his inauguration, Lincoln had intended to stop next at Baltimore, which was home to many secessionist sympathizers. According to information gathered by Stone's detectives, secessionists were planning to assassinate Lincoln during his stop in Baltimore.\nThe warning Fred Seward brought would contribute to Lincoln's decision to pass through Baltimore under the cover of night, rather than stop and appear in public there. Although Allan Pinkerton also warned Lincoln of danger awaiting him in Baltimore, it was Seward's information that confirmed everyone's fears.\nCivil War\nWhen his father was appointed Secretary of State in 1861, Seward became Assistant Secretary of State in charge of consular service under Lincoln and Andrew Johnson.  He served in the position until 1869 and \"assisted in the negotiations to the adoption of the Burlingame Treaty,\" which set the attitude towards China when the empire \"accepted the principles of international law.\"\nAttempt on father's life\nattacking Seward after attempting to shoot him]]\nOn April 14, 1865, he was injured in an assassination attempt upon his father on the same night that Lincoln was murdered. Lewis Powell, also known as \"Lewis Paine,\" an ex-Confederate and co-conspirator of John Wilkes Booth, attempted to kill William Seward while the Secretary of State was convalescing at home from a carriage accident.\nThat was Powell's part in the plot to put the government into chaos; Vice President Andrew Johnson and President Lincoln were also to be killed that same evening. After Frederick blocked Powell from gaining access to William Seward's bedroom, Powell tried to shoot Frederick in the head. However, when the gun failed to fire, Powell quickly smashed the pistol over Frederick's head, causing several skull injuries. Frederick then collapsed and fell to the floor at the top of the stairs.\nPowell then burst into William Seward's room and stabbed him several times in the face and neck. Powell also injured a number of others who were present, including Frederick's sister Fanny, his brother Augustus, his father's nurse Private George F. Robinson and messenger Emerick Hansell, but no one was killed. Seward's mother was sure that he was going to die; instead, she died on June 21, 1865, of a heart attack. His sister, Fanny, died soon afterward, in October 1866.\nPowell was hanged on July 7, 1865, along with David Herold, George Atzerodt, and Mary Surratt, who were also involved in the conspiracy.\nLater life\ngun.]]\nOn April 17, 1868, Seward testified in the impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson, having been called as a witness by Johnson's defense team.\nFrederick's father died on October 10, 1872. Seward was a member of the New York State Assembly (New York Co., 7th D.) in 1875.  At the New York state election, 1875, he ran on the Republican ticket for Secretary of State of New York, but was defeated by Democrat John Bigelow.  He served again as Assistant Secretary of State, in the administration of Rutherford B. Hayes under William M. Evarts, from 1877 until his resignation in November 1879 due to illness. Seward was replaced by John Hay, the diplomat who had been one of President Lincoln's private secretaries.\nSeward also edited and published his father's autobiography and letters in a volume entitled Life and Letters of William H. Seward.  Mostly, his life after 1881 was devoted to the practice of his legal profession and to lecturing and writing.\nPersonal life\nOn November 9, 1854, he married Anna Margaret Wharton (1836–1919) of Albany, New York and spent the latter part of his life in a house he built in Montrose-on-the-Hudson, near Peekskill, in New York.  The estate had nearly a mile of Hudson River water-frontage.\nSeward died at his home in Montrose on April 25, 1915, at the age of 84. He was interred with his family in Fort Hill Cemetery in Auburn, New York.  Seward left an estate valued at $100,000.  In 1916, a year after his death, his book Reminiscences of a War-Time Statesman and Diplomat, 1830-1915, a five-hundred page book about the Civil War and politics, was published by G.P. Putnam's Sons.  Also in 1916, his widow sold their 50-acre Montrose estate.\nIn popular culture\nSeward was portrayed by Josh Bowman  in the 2024 Apple TV+ miniseries series Manhunt.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070613045811/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/additional-publications/civil-war/SML.htm Saving Mr. Lincoln: CIA Site] by CIA 2007\n*[http://ehistory.osu.edu/osu/books/battles/vol1/pageview.cfm?page=022 EHistory at OSU | Online Books | Battles and Leaders of the Civil War Volume 1 Page 022] at ehistory.osu.edu Battles and Leaders of the Civil War, Volume 1, Ohio State University Online\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090216041325/https://www.library.rochester.edu/index.cfm?PAGE=1136 Seward, William Henry] at www.library.rochester.edu The University of Rochester Library: Rare Books and Special Collections\nExternal links\n*\n*"
