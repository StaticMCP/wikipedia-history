Wálter Guevara Arze and the PRA formally backed René Barrientos' presidential candidacy in 1966, and the Authentic Revolutionary Party served as part of the governing coalition of parties until 1969. Even after Barrientos' death, Guevara Arze continued as Bolivia's ambassador to the United Nations under Presidents Luis Adolfo Siles Salinas and Alfredo Ovando Candía, until 1970.\nThe Authentic Revolutionary Party was in less sympathy with the Hugo Banzer Suárez government and opposed that regime's continuance after 1974, when Guevara Arze was sent into exile after he criticized the Government.\nIn the 1978 and 1979 presidential elections the Authentic Revolutionary Party supported Víctor Paz Estenssoro's candidacy for the presidency, with Guevara Arze as his running mate in 1978. A splinter faction led by Ríos backed the Nationalist Union of the People of Juan Pereda in 1978, then Nationalist Democratic Action of Hugo Banzer in 1979.\nIn 1979 Guevara Arze was elected president of the Senate. On 8 August 1979, when Congress could not agree on a choice of president between the two major candidates, he was appointed interim President of the Republic, pending the holding of new elections in May 1980. He held this post for less than three months, being overthrown by Colonel Alberto Natusch Busch. The two weeks which followed were perhaps Guevara Arze's finest as a statesman; he vigorously opposed Alberto Natusch Busch and helped rally civilian and military opposition to the colonel's ruthless rule. Alberto Natusch Busch was driven from office – but political compromises were necessary which prevented Wálter Guevara Arze from reassuming the interim presidency. That post went to Lidia Gueiler Tejada, a dissident leader of the Revolutionary Party of the Nationalist Left, who had also backed Víctor Paz Estenssoro in the 1979 general election.\nAs interim President, Lidia Gueiler Tejada was entrusted with the task of conducting the nation to new general elections in 1980. The Authentic Revolutionary Party has little popular following or basis for existence beyond Guevara Arze's personal ambitions and prestige, and it is chiefly useful for backstage maneuvering and coalition-building. When the party ran Wálter Guevara Arze as its candidate on 29 June 1980, it garnered only a 02.78% vote.\nOn 17 July 1980 Lidia Gueiler Tejada was overthrown in turn by General Luis García Meza Tejada.\nThe Authentic Revolutionary Party has had no political power in decades.\nNotes"
