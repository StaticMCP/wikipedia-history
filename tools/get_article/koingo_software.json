Presently, the business develops a mix of 8 shareware and freeware applications, most of which are available for the Macintosh and Windows.\nExcept for a few games in the past, the majority of the titles have been geared towards personal time, data, security, and information management such as for home inventory, scheduling, password and data storage, and digital anti-theft monitoring and protection.\nEarly history\nKoingo Software originally branded its productions under both the Koingo Games and Pain Games titles. These products included titles such as Rocket Launch, Sewer Trouble, and Valley of the Vampire which were black and white HyperCard adventure games.\nIn 1999, the business began also developing products in REALbasic. These new products, such as Alarm Clock Pro (a time management utility), Password Retriever (password database utility), and Contact Keeper (simple address book), not being games, the organization rebranded itself as Koingo Software.\nRecent history\nIn December 2012, Koingo's founder took a leave of absence from the company for five years to pursue other business ventures such as starting his online travel blog on Instagram \"adventurejosh.ca\" and adventurejosh.com. Upon his return, Koingo gave away a new MacBook to one of the adventurejosh.ca followers on March 1, 2017. With his return, Koingo shortly thereafter released a massive overhaul of their flagship application MacPilot, bringing it to version 9, with promises of doing the same for MacCleanse.\nCommunity involvement\nKoingo Software has played an active role in the Macintosh community by regularly donating licenses to Macintosh User Groups, and participating in third-party giveaways and discounts with sites like MacZot and MacHeist.\nIn 2006 through part of 2007, Koingo Software gave away 10,881 copies of their MacPilot application to all users renewing or signing up for a VersionTracker membership.\nThe largest joint venture undertaken was the coupling of Koingo Software's Utility Package (the combination of all 12 of their software titles at the time) with MacUpdate's 2008 back-to-school bundle. Then later that year, the businesses offered Koingo Software's MacPilot in the 2008 Christmas Holiday Bundle.\nReviews\n* [http://www.macworld.co.uk/macsoftware/reviews/index.cfm?reviewid=2302&pagtype=samechandate MacWorld's Editor's Choice: Alarm Clock Pro]\n* [http://www.macworld.co.uk/macsoftware/reviews/index.cfm?reviewid=2412&pagtype=samechandate MacWorld Editor's Review: MacPilot]\n* [http://www.macworld.co.uk/macsoftware/reviews/index.cfm?reviewid=3057&pagtype=samechandate MacWorld Editor's Review: AirRadar]\n* [https://archive.today/20130127103721/http://www.koingosw.com/products/features/alarmclockpro/macaddict.jpg MacAddict Magazine Feature for Alarm Clock Pro, April 2004 Issue]\n* [http://download.cnet.com/Alarm-Clock-Pro/3000-2124_4-10056662.html C|Net: Alarm Clock Pro Editor's Review]\n* [http://download.cnet.com/MacPilot/3000-2094_4-10471031.html C|Net: MacPilot Editor's Review]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090417000316/http://thespinningbeachball.com/index_files/macpilot.php The Spinning Beachball: MacPilot Review]\nCurrent software\nApplications\n* AirRadar\n:Scan for wireless networks, and provides detailed information such as encryption type, signal, noise, ad-hoc status, pbcc flag, channel, MAC address, and beacon interval.\n* Alarm Clock Pro\n:Schedule tasks such as playing multimedia files (including via iTunes), running system scripts, composing and sending e-mails, pinging web URLs, sending text messages and taking web cam and screenshots on a schedule or by timer.\n* Data Guardian\n:The successor to Password Retriever.
