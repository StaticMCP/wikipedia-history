It was built in 1928, and is a seven-story, brick building in an eclectic Gothic Revival / Art Deco style. It features terra cotta tile ornamentation and a continuous terra cotta and brick false parapet. A two-story addition was added to the rear of the building in 1962. It was the first skyscraper, first tower hotel and first fireproof hotel in Newport News.
