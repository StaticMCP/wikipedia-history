In the , the locality of Corfield had a population of 158 people.\nGeography\nThe town is on the Kennedy Developmental Road&mdash;the road linking Winton and Hughenden&mdash; north west of the state capital Brisbane and  south west of the regional centre of Townsville. The Landsborough Highway also passes through the locality (but not through the town) merging with the Kennedy Developmental Road just before crossing into Winton. The Central Western railway line passes through the south of the locality to its terminus at Winton railway station.\nThe Richmond–Winton Road follows a section of the north-western boundary.\nThe principal land use is cattle grazing.\nAs the boundaries of Winton hug the grid layout of its streets, a number of Winton's facilities are actually located in Corfield. These include the Winton Golf Course and the Winton Showground and Racecourse. As Winton uses bore water from the Great Artesian Basin, this water emerges at  and is cooled in ponds in Corfield to  before it is circulated through Winton.\nHistory\nJirandali (also known as Yirandali, Warungu, Yirandhali) is an Australian Aboriginal language of North-West Queensland, particularly the Hughenden area. The language region includes the local government area of the Shire of Flinders, including Dutton River, Flinders River, Mount Sturgeon, Caledonia, Richmond, Corfield, Winton, Torrens, Tower Hill, Landsborough Creek, Lammermoor Station, Hughenden, and Tangorin.\nIn its earlier incarnation as a Cobb & Co changing station along the Hughenden to Winton mail route, the locality was named Manuka&mdash;after a nearby sheep station.\nWhen the railway linking Hughenden and Winton was built in 1899, the town was moved  west to the line and renamed Corfield after William Henry Corfield&mdash;a local carrier and businessman, who, as Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Gregory 1888-99 lobbied for the rail link. The population of the town peaked at around thirty to forty residents and facilities included \"five railway houses, plus the station master’s house, a post office, two petrol depots, a hotel and a school and teacher’s house ... a goods shed and railway building.\"\nCorfield Post Office opened on 5 October 1898 and closed in 1991.\nCorfield State School opened on 4 February 1957 and closed on 31 January 1975. It reopened on 27 January 1976 but closed again on 15 December 1989.\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Corfield and the surrounding area had a population of 162 people.\nIn the , the locality of Corfield and the surrounding area had a population of 380 people.\nAs at 2012, the population of the town of Corfield had declined with a permanent town population of seven.\nIn the , the locality of Corfield had a population of 183 people.\nIn the , the locality of Corfield had a population of 158 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Corfield.
