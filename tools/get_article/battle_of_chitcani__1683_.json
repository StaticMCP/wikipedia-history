On 24 August of the same year, the Polish monarch appointed Stefan Kunicki as hetman of the Right-bank Zaporizhian Cossacks. During the summer and autumn of 1683 Kunicki's army made several campaigns and occupied Nemyriv, Chișinău, Bender. At the end of 1683, the 5,000-strong army of the hetman made a campaign through Moldavian lands to the Budzhak and Bilhorod steppes.\nOn 5 December, a 15,000-strong Cossack-Moldavian detachment of Kunicki and Ștefan Petriceicu suddenly attacked a 25,000-strong detachment of Ali-Pasha near the village of Chițcani, not far from the bank of the Danube. The Tatars were defeated, during the pursuit many Horde men were killed (Ali-Pasha, Aliger-Pasha, several murza) and Tatar commanders were taken prisoner.\nLater Kunicki noted that not a single man in his army was killed. Having won the victory, the hetman of the Right-bank Ukraine moved deep into the Nogai possessions. Stefan Kunicki and his Cossacks destroyed the settlements around Bilhorod (Akkerman) and reached the shores of the Black Sea, taking by storm the cities of Izmail and Kiliia. After this success Hetman Kunicki tried to take Bilhorod, but because of the lack of artillery he failed. Part of the Cossacks, weighed down with booty, returned to Ukraine.\nReferences\nLiterature\n* Чухліб Тарас. Гетьман С.
