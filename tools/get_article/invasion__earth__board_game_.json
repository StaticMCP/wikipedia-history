It was republished in 2004 as part of Far Future Enterprises Traveller: The Classic Games, Games 1-6+.\nReception\nWilliam A. Barton reviewed Invasion: Earth in The Space Gamer No. 48. Barton commented that \"Overall, for its merits as a two-player SF board game and for its direct applications to Traveller role-playing, I can recommend Invasion: Earth to all Traveller enthusiasts as well as all those who have enjoyed GDW's other fine SF games.\"\nAndy Slack reviewed Invasion: Earth for White Dwarf #30, giving it an overall rating of 6 out of 10, and stated that \"This game feels realistic. Unfortunately, I can't say I enjoyed it.\"\nTony Watson reviewed Invasion: Earth in Ares #14 and commented that \"Invasion: Earth is an interesting, well-balanced game. The situation is tense, requiring some attention to strategy and tactics on both players' parts, and though the ground combat tends to drag a bit at times, the game mechanics are appropriate and well-considered.\"\nSee also\nTraveller boardgames\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
