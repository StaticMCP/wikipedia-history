They were founded by Neil Finn and Paul Hester of the New Zealand group Split Enz. Most Split Enz fans shifted their allegiance to the new group, so Crowded House had an established fan base before they had recorded any material. The band has released eight studio albums: Crowded House (1986), Temple of Low Men (1988), Woodface (1991), Together Alone (1993), Time on Earth (2007) and Intriguer (2010),  Dreamers Are Waiting (2021), and Gravity Stairs (2024) . The band dissolved in 1996, and reformed in 2007. Crowded House has won awards both nationally and internationally, including twelve ARIA Music Awards from the Australian Recording Industry Association, and eight APRA Awards from the Australasian Performing Right Association. APRA also listed their track, \"Don't Dream It's Over,\" as the seventh best Australian song of all time in May 2001.\nCrowded House has performed in several venues, and have become well known among both fans and the music industry both for their music and the skill of the individual members. Their most awarded work is \"Don't Dream It's Over\" (1986), from their debut album. The song has earned two ARIA Music Awards, three APRA Awards, a BMI Award, and an MTV Music Video Award. In 1998 it was placed 76th on the Triple J Hottest 100 of All Time. They have also had two other songs in annual Hottest 100 lists of best songs from a year. Crowded House won the BRIT Award for Best International Group in 1994.\nCrowded House has won twelve trophies from 35&nbsp;nominations since the ARIA Music Awards were first presented in 1987, including being the first winners of the Best New Talent and Song of the Year categories in that year. The group's success has been across several categories; they received their most nominations (eight) in the Best Group category, winning in 1988 and 1993. Eight of their ARIA Awards were from their first two albums, Crowded House and Temple of Low Men, with the line-up of Finn, Hester and Nick Seymour. Crowded House has won eight APRA Awards in various categories, including three wins in \"most-performed\" categories from various genres and three wins for either the Gold Award (for best song of the year) or Song of the Year (category renamed from 1991).\nThe New Zealand Music Awards have been conferred annually since 1965 by Recorded Music NZ. Crowded House has received five nominations, primarily in the category of International Achievement, winning in 1992, 1994 and 1995.\nAustralian Record Industry Association (ARIA) Awards\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Year\n! scope=\"col\" |Nominated work\n! scope=\"col\" |Award\n! scope=\"col\" |Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"7\"| 1987\n|rowspan=\"2\"| Crowded House\n| Best New Talent\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| Album of the Year\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|\n| Song of the Year\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| Single of the Year\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| Best Group\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n|\n| Best Video\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| Crowded House – Nick Seymour\n| Best Cover Artist\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" | 1988\n| Crowded House\n| Best Group\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=9| 1989\n|rowspan=5| Temple of Low Men\n| Album of the Year\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| Best Adult Contemporary Album\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| Best Cover Art\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| Best Group\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| Highest Selling Album\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n|rowspan=3 |\n| Song of the Year\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| Single of the Year\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| Highest Selling Single\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n||\n| Best Video\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=7| 1992\n|rowspan=4| Woodface\n| Album of the Year\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| Best Group\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| Best Cover Art\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| Highest Selling Album\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| \"Fall At Your Feet\" - Neil Finn\n| Song of the Year\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n|\n| Engineer of the Year\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n|\n| Best Video\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=3| 1993\n|rowspan=3|\n| Single of the Year\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| Best Group\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| Song of the Year\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=5| 1994\n|rowspan=2| Together Alone\n| Album of the Year\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| Best Group\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| Together Alone – Nick Seymour\n| Best Cover Art\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n|\n| Single of the Year\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| \"Distant Sun\" - Neil Finn\n| Song of the Year\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" | 1995\n|\n| Best Group\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=2| 1996\n|rowspan=2|\n| Highest Selling Single\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| Best Group\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=3| 1997\n|\n| Best Group\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n|\n| Best Video\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| Recurring Dream\n| Highest Selling Album\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" | 2010\n| Intriguer\n| Best Adult Contemporary Album\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" | 2016\n| Crowded House\n| ARIA Hall of Fame\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" | 2021\n| Dreamers Are Waiting\n| Best Adult Contemporary Album\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=2| 2024\n| Gravity Stairs\n| Best Adult Contemporary Album\n|\n|rowspan=2|\n|-\n| Crowded House & Steven Schram Gravity Stairs\n| Best Produced Album\n|\n|}\nAustralasian Performing Right Association (APRA) Awards\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Year\n! scope=\"col\" |Country\n! scope=\"col\" |Nominated work\n! scope=\"col\" |Award\n! scope=\"col\" |Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |1987\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"| Australia\n|\n|Most Performed Australasian Popular Work\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |1988\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"| Australia\n|\n|Gold Award\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |1992\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"| Australia\n| Neil Finn & Tim Finn\n|Songwriter of the Year\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=2|1993\n|style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=2| Australia\n|\n|Most Performed Australian Work Overseas\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n|\n|Song of the Year\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=3|1994\n|style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=3| Australia\n|\n|Song of the Year\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| Neil Finn\n|Songwriter of the Year\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n|\n|Most Performed Australian Work Overseas\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |1995\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"| Australia\n|\n|Song of the Year\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |2001\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"| Australia\n|\n|Top Ten Australian songs\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |2007\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"| New Zealand\n|\n|Silver Scroll\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|}\nMo Awards\nThe Australian Entertainment Mo Awards (commonly known informally as the Mo Awards), were annual Australian entertainment industry awards.
