It was part of the Romanian operations for the defense of the passes in the Carpathians. The objectives of the operation were to resist the enemy attack on the Transylvanian front, to obtain and maintain a defensive device in the Carpathian alignment and to create the conditions for an eventual counter-offensive. At the end, the Central Powers (Germany and Austria-Hungary) failed to defeat the Romanian forces and the battle was a victory for the latter.\nThe Austro-Hungarian forces were commanded by Charles I of Austria, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, while the German army was commanded by General Erich von Falkenhayn. On the other hand, the Romanian commanders were Eremia Grigorescu and Nicolae Sinescu.\nReferences"
