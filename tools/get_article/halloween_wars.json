It premiered on October 2, 2011, on Food Network and it runs over the course of four weeks in October annually. The show pits five teams made up of cake sculptors, sugar artists, and pumpkin carvers against each other to produce the ultimate Halloween themed display. The winning team is awarded $50,000. For season 13 and 14, the winning team is awarded $25,000.\nThe series was hosted by Justin Willman (seasons 1–4), Rossi Morreale (season 5), Jonathan Bennett (seasons 6-10, 13-15), and for seasons 11 and 12, hosted by paranormal investigator Zak Bagans from Ghost Adventures.\nRounds\nEach episode has two rounds. The first round is the \"Small Scare\" where the teams of trios get 45 minutes to create their interpretation of a spooky theme (ex: \"possessed electronics\" or \"zombie dolls\"). The winners of the first round get an extra assistant for the second round (starting in season three, winners of the final episode \"Small Scare\" round get first pick of the pumpkins).\nThe second round is the \"Spine Chiller\" where the teams get five hours to create a large-scale, immersive sculpture based on a new theme. They must also serve a tasting element that usually have something to do with the theme. The themes for the second round relate to the title of each episode (such as \"Zombies vs. Vampires\", where the teams had to create a scene depicting a zombie battling a vampire using cake, candy, and pumpkin).\nJudges\nThere are three judges in the series, with two of them serving as permanent judges in seasons 1-10. Throughout the series award-winning cake artist Shinmin Li served as permanent judge. Hollywood conceptual artist Miles Teves was the second judge in season 1. Actor and award-winning special effects artist Tom Savini was the second judge in season 2. Emmy-nominated SFX make-up artist Brian Kinney was the second judge in seasons 3–5. Writer/director of ''Child's Play'', Don Mancini joined Shinmin in season 6. Director and effects artist Todd Tucker was the male judge in seasons 7–10. Starting in season 11, Food Network Star winner Aarti Sequeira serves as permanent judges along with Shinmin. For Seasons 11-12, Eddie Jackson served as a co-host along with paranormal activity hunter Zak Bagans. In Season 13, Bennett returned to the show as the host.\nIn addition to the two regular judges throughout seasons 1-10, each episode had a third special guest judge that is involved in horror, whether as an actor, a writer, etc.\nEpisodes\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%;\"\n!Season\n!Season premiere date\n!Season finale date\n!No. of teams\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n!1\n|October 2, 2011\n|October 23, 2011\n|5\n| rowspan=\"14\" |Shinmin Li\n| rowspan=\"1\" |Miles Teves\n| rowspan=\"14\" |Guest Judges\n|-\n!2\n|October 7, 2012\n|October 28, 2012\n|5\n|Tom Savini\n|-\n!3\n|October 6, 2013\n|October 27, 2013\n|5\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Brian Kinney\n|-\n!4\n|October 5, 2014\n|October 26, 2014\n|5\n|-\n!5\n|October 4, 2015\n|October 25, 2015\n|5\n|-\n!6\n|October 2, 2016\n|October 30, 2016\n|6\n|Don Mancini\n|-\n!7\n|October 1, 2017\n|October 29, 2017\n|6\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Todd Tucker\n|-\n!8\n|September 30, 2018\n|October 28, 2018\n|6\n|-\n!9\n|September 29, 2019\n|October 27, 2019\n|6\n|-\n!10\n|September 13, 2020\n|October 11, 2020\n|6\n|-\n!11\n|September 19, 2021\n|October 31, 2021\n|8\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Eddie Jackson\n|-\n!12\n|September 18, 2022\n|October 30, 2022\n|9\n|-\n!13\n|September 17, 2023\n|October 29, 2023\n|9\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Aarti Sequeira\n|-\n!14\n|September 22, 2024\n|October 27, 2024\n|8\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
