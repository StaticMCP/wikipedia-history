He was married three times, and was father to archaeologist Gale Sieveking (1925–2007) and Fortean-writer Paul Sieveking (1949–).\nBiography\nSieveking was born on 19 March 1896 in Harrow, Middlesex. His parents were Edward Gustavus Sieveking, a timber-merchant, and Isabel Giberne Sieveking, an author and suffragette whose aunts included the Roman Catholic nun Maria Rosina Giberne and Catherine Hopkins, mother of Gerard Manley Hopkins. He was a very creative child, writing from the age of six, and starting a novel aged 13 which would ultimately see print when he was 26. In-between, he \"actively support[ed] the Women's Suffrage movement\" before war broke out.\nWorld War I\nSieveking (as well as his brother, Valentine Edgar Sieveking) served during World War I. Lance signed up with the Artists Rifles before \"join[ing] the Royal Navy Air Service, [and winning] the DFC\" before being \"shot down over the Rhine\" in 1917 and held as a German prisoner-of-war.\nUpon his return to England, he attended St Catharine's College, Cambridge, and was close friends with fellow-Cambridge student Eric Maschwitz. The two were (with others) both editors on The new Cambridge chap book between 1920 and 1921.\nBBC\nSieveking made his name with the BBC, starting out as assistant to the Director of Education, before \"he went on to introduce the first running commentaries and adapt numerous classics for radio drama... it has been argued that the production of the first television play springs from his ingenuity\". He was drama script editor for ten years (1940–50) before retiring \"six years later in 1956\".\nHe wrote The Stuff of Radio (1934), and his radio dramatisation of C. S. Lewis' first (chronologically) Chronicles of Narnia title ''The Magician's Nephew'' was approved by Lewis personally. In 1927, he designed \"an eight-squared drawing meant to assist BBC radio's football commentators,\" (as well as listeners at home, who could get a copy of the same chart in the Radio Times. His 1928 experimental work The Kaleidoscope was partly recreated in 2022 by the London Bubble Young Theatre Makers and broadcast on BBC Radio 3 as part of a documentary about him.\nAnother early BBC radio drama producer, Val Gielgud, said of the \"not altogether fortunate\" Sieveking:\n:\"He was perhaps over much influenced during his most impressionable years by G. K. Chesterton, and by the theory of that master of paradox that because some things were better looked at inside out or upside down such a viewpoint should invariably be adopted. Talented and imaginative beyond the ordinary, his eyes gazing towards distant horizons, he was liable to neglect what lay immediately before his feet.\"\nHarry Heuser interprets Gielgud's words in the following way:\n:\"Sieveking was an audio-visionary, a trier of radiogenic techniques at whom actors and colleagues would \"gaze with a certain dumb bewilderment\" as he \"exhorted them to play 'in a deep-green mood,' or spoke with fluent enthusiasm of 'playing the dramatic-control panel, as one plays an organ.\" There was not much use for such a one in radio. As Gielgud put it, even British radio broadcasting, \"provided him with no laboratory in which experiments could be carried out.\" \"\nIn 1930, while radio drama was still relatively new, Sieveking found in the still-newer medium of television a place in which he could experiment with new ideas. To that end, (in collaboration with Gielgud) he brought an adaptation of Luigi Pirandello's short play ''L'uomo dal fiore in bocca (1923) to television as \"The Man with the Flower in His Mouth\"'', airing on 14 July 1930 – the first British television play. Very little of Sieveking's work survives in whole or in part (aside from some scripts – see below), but in 1967, \"The Man..\" was re-made, \"authentically re-produced and presented by the original producer, Lance Sieveking, supported by the original art-work (by C R Nevinson) and music recording\".[http://www.tvdawn.com/mwfihm.HTM 'The First British Television Play – \"The Man With the Flower in his Mouth\"].
