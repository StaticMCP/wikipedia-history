The movement is rooted in several instances of indigenous territory being colonized, ruled, and marginalized by different powers and the riots and civil disobedience resulting from it, including the 1958 Rif riots and the Hirak Rif movement. While Riffian independence has been a topic of protest and organization in the past, the formal and internationally noted independence movement could technically be considered to have begun in September 2023 with the formation of the Rif Nationalist Party (PNR).\nHistory\nThe Rif region is largely of Berber origin. Of the 55 Rif tribes, 47 of them are of Berber and/or Arabized Berber origin (although some of these tribes contain a minority of Arab sub-tribes), and only 8 Rif tribes are Arabs not of Berber origin (including the tribes of Oulad Mansour, Oulad Sghir, La'thamna, Banu Sahil, Kholout, Gharbiya, Anjara, and Oulad Stout). The fact that the Rif is a collection of indigenous tribal regions, mostly of Berber origin, provoked significant resentment against the Moroccan state among some Riffians due to the Arab government refusing to allow their region self-governance despite them having been indigenous for several centuries.\nRepublic of the Rif\nIn the summer of 1921, Rif tribal fighters defeated the Spanish army who attempted to take control over the region. The rebellion's leader, Muhammed bin ‘Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi, officially declared the independence of the Rif Republic on September 18, 1921, and established governing institutions in the form of a tribal confederal republic. In 1926, the Republic of the Rif extended over the entire territory in northern Morocco that was under the Spanish protectorate, as well as the entire regions of Iznassen [fr](near Berkane), Triffa [fr] (near Saïdia), and Fahs (near Tangier). After a couple of years, the newly installed republic was crushed by French and British forces, and Abd al-Karim surrendered on May 26, 1926. Despite being under the French protectorate, several cities in the region cities are mentioned in the Rif Berber national anthem.\n1958 riots\nRebellion sparked again between 1957 and 1958, through a popular uprising named the Rif Revolt, which was violently crushed by Moroccan forces, leading to the death of 3000 Rifians. The revolt, led by Sellam Amezian, had a clear set of demands: political and social rights, the departure of foreign troops from the country, the return of the resistance leader Abd el-Krim from exile, the dissolution of political parties, the liberation of political prisoners, and the installation of a \"people's government\" (gouvernement populaire).\nThe  Moroccan National Liberation Army (ALN) maintained an armed struggle in the Rif and in the Atlas entering into open conflict with the Istiqlal party. The latter, led by Abdelkhalek Torres, Mehdi Ben Barka, and Allal Al Fassi, committed numerous crimes (assassinations and kidnappings) against ALN sympathisers. Haddou Aqchich and Abbas Lamsaadi, fighters and emblematic figures of the ALN were assassinated. The Riffian population, feeling more and more marginalised and attacked by the Istiqlal party in power, decided to revolt in October 1958. The revolt was ignited by the closure of the Algerian border to Rif migration, leading to unemployment, in addition to the total lack of Rif political representation in the Moroccan government. On 25 October 1958, the Istiqlal Party offices in Imzoûrene were stormed and government soldiers were overpowered. It was here that the uprising took the form of a real revolt. On 26 December, a harka (a punitive expedition) was decided against the Rif, with the monarchy imposing a media blackout. Journalists, especially foreigners, were banned from the region.\nThe events escalated quickly, and weapons started to be used by both the protesters and the army. The uprising was fiercely oppressed by the army, even using aircraft flown by French pilots. Hundreds were killed and thousands were arrested and wounded. Abd El-Karim estimated the number of detainees in the wake of the Rif uprising at 8,420. The region was subsequently declared a military zone. The brutal repression left the region with a lasting memory of injustice that translated into distrust for the state.\nSince then, Rifians felt politically, economically and culturally marginalized and discriminated against. Central authorities began to invest in the region only after an earthquake in 2004 caused great damages. Despite this renewed interest, the Rif still suffered from high unemployment rates, exceeding 20 percent of the labor force, which represents twice the national average, while the informal economy prevails. Most households relied on the financial support of family members living in Europe, mainly in the Netherlands and Belgium. The region also lacked education: 43.8% of the population does not have any diploma, compared to 36.9% nationally.\nHirak Rif movement\nflag and holding Berber flags]]\nThe Hirak Rif Movement or the Rif Movement (, ) organized mass protests in the Berber Rif region in northern Morocco between October 2016 and June 2017. The movement was triggered by the death of Mouhcine Fikri, a fishmonger who was crushed to death after jumping in the back of a garbage truck attempting to retrieve his allegedly illegal fish merchandise confiscated by local authorities.\nThe movement's leader Nasser Zefzafi was arrested for the obstruction of freedom of worship, and was flown in a military helicopter directly to Casablanca (500&nbsp;km away), where he is being held and was tried by a court of law for charges of sedition and conspiracy as of 10 March 2018, and sentenced to 20 years in prison. The Moroccan authorities chose to detain him away from his native city and his popular base to defuse the protests.\nOn 26 June 2017, day of celebration of Eid el-Fitr, the police and gendarmerie launched a vast crackdown in Al Hoceima and surrounding areas, to disband a planned march in solidarity with the detainees. Officially 60 people were arrested, while many others were unaccounted for, and many injuries were reported by independent journalists. The government official press then published various stories in its media claiming that 39 members of police were injured. Over 400 arrests were made in the aftermath of the protests, more than a quarter of which were minors.\nSeparatist movements\nMany Rif activists have been imprisoned by the Moroccan government for demanding the independence of the Rif region from the Moroccan state.\nThe Rif Nationalist Party (PNR) was formed in September 2023 as a result of persistent marginalization and suppression of civil unrest by separatists. In March 2024, Algeria allowed the separatist party to open a representation office in the capital of Algiers. While at a press briefing in the office, party officials requested help from the Western Sahara separatist Polisario Front \"to confront the Moroccan occupation\", and also expressed intent to open up more diplomatic offices in Tindouf and in more countries. In response, the Polisario expressed interest in establishing ties with the party and helping its members learn how to use military weapons. The Rif Nationalist Party also requested for Algeria to host its military bases and to treat them \"like other liberation movements\". The actions by the Rif Nationalist Party and Algeria's response, which included funding the party, were significant in heightening tensions between it and Morocco.\nIn April 2024, a PNR delegation meet with United Nations representatives in New York City with hope of achieving support for separatism from Morocco and to provide a platform for the Rif people to speak to the rest of the world and advocate for their needs and rights.\nReferences"
