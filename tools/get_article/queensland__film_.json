He attempts to reconnect with an old flame, Marge, and move to Queensland together.\nCast\n*John Flaus as Doug\n*Bob Karl as Aub\n*Alison Bird as Marge\n*Tom Broadbridge as Mick\nProduction\nJohn Ruane says he was inspired by a newspaper article about a slaughterman who killed his de facto wife and then got drunk for two days. He decided to remove the killing aspect, concentrate on the relationship. Ruane:\nWhat we were trying to do then, strangely enough, was trying to imitate Summer of the Seventeenth Doll in reverse and to imitate Midnight Cowboy, a sort of Northcote version of Midnight Cowboy - not the story, but the fact that they were headed for a dream. Their dream was Miami. Our film was obviously about heading to Queensland... It's about a vanishing breed of Australians.\nThe film was made with money from the Experimental Film and Television Fund while John Ruane was a film student at the Swinburne College of Technology in Melbourne.\nRelease\nThe movie was released through the co-operative movement.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://archive.today/20121127233338/http://colsearch.nfsa.gov.au/nfsa/search/display/display.w3p;adv=;group=;groupequals=;holdingType=;page=0;parentid=;query=queensland%20ruane;querytype=;rec=5;resCount=10 Queensland] at National Film and Sound Archive\n*[http://www.ozmovies.com.au/movie/queensland Queensland] at Oz Movies"
