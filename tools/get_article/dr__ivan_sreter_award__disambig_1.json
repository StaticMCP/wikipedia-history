During the Croatian War of Independence he was taken captive by Serb troops and presumably killed, although his remains have not been found .\nThe contest and the award was initially designed by Stjepan Babić, and it has been organized by the literary magazine Jezik since 1993.\nWinners\n* 1993 - László Bulcsú for suosnik, as a replacement for the term koaksijalni kabel (Eng: coaxial cable)\n* 1998 - straničnik as a replacement for bookmark\n* 2006 - Nada Arar-Premužić for uspornik, as a replacement for the term ležeći policajac (Eng: speed bump)\n* 2007 - Vilim Pantlik for naplatnica as a replacement for naplatna kućica (Eng: tollbooth)\n* 2009 - Drago Štambuk for proširnica, as a replacement for žilni potporanj (Eng: stent)\n* 2010 - Vinko Vukadin for ispraznica as a replacement for floskula (Eng: platitude)\n* 2011 - Šandor Dembitz for zatipak as a replacement for tipfeler (Eng: typo)\n* 2018 - Lidija Stević Brtan for zapozorje as a replacement for backstage\n* 2020 - Drago Štambuk and Karlo Kulaš for dišnik as a replacement for respirator\n* 2023 - Tomislav Meštrović and Ognjen Ožegić for prestrujnik as a replacement for adapteri or strujni adapteri (Eng: power adapter)\n* 2023 - Leonardo Štrac and Izabela Štrac for Šećerice as a replacement for sugarcane\n* 2023 - Marko Bukna and Martina Pehar for bakroza as a replacement for ''Wilson's disease''\nReferences"
