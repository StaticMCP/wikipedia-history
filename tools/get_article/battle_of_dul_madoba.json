During the battle, Ibraahin Xoorane killed Richard Corfield. A native Somali account of the battle is found in the poem .\nBattle\nDul Madoba is a ridge some  southeast of Burao in what was then British Somaliland. On 8 August 1913, fleeing Dhulbahante tribesmen sought refuge with Corfield who was stationed at Ber with the Somaliland Camel Constabulary. The Dhulbahante informed him that the Dervish raided their settlements and captured their camel herds. Corfield set out to punish the Dervish and return the looted Dhulbahante livestock. The battle took place on 9 August 1913. On one side 110 members of the SSC from British Somaliland and 300 British-allied Dhulbahante tribesmen all under the command of Colonel Richard Corfield faced some 2,750 well-armed Dervish followers of Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, nicknamed by the British as the Mad Mullah.\nAs soon as the Dervishes charged forward, all of the Dhulbahante tribesmen immediately fled the battlefield. The Constabulary were quickly outflanked on the right causing some of Corfield's men to disperse to the rear. The Maxim gun in the centre fired a couple belts before it was jammed. Richard Corfield, who had positioned himself near the gun, was shot in the head and died instantly.\nCaptain G.H. Summers, who was badly wounded, and Cecil de Sivrac Dunn rallied the surviving Constabulary and formed a protective cover from the bodies of the dead camels. Dervish attacks, which consisted of forward rushes, continued in endless succession, and hand-to-hand fighting ensued. Several Dervishes penetrated the defenses, and attempted to capture the disabled Maxim gun. But at that critical moment, the Dervishes withdrew altogether as their stocks of ammunition were exhausted. The Dhulbahante who had initially fled the battle now returned to loot the bodies on the battlefield. 36 of the Constabulary including Corfield were killed in action, 21 were wounded, and 24 had deserted. The survivors counted 395 dead Dervishes who had been left behind\nSee also\n* Dervish Movement\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*"
