When Tilly notes the Hunter's Moon is rising, which begins to affect Drew, she informs Mack that they must share a long-held secret with their son about his origins. While his father and brother are away, Tilly prepares to speak to Drew, but they are attacked by a wolf-like shadow with red eyes, which kills Tilly and disappears. During the fight, Drew's eyes begin to glow yellow and he partially gains canine features. Hearing screams, Mack and Trent return home and believe Drew has killed Tilly, forcing him to flee into the Dyrewoods with his mother's sword. Heeding her final words, Drew plans to escape to Brackenholme to speak with Duke Bergan, but is caught in a snare by Whitley, who is completing her scout training alongside her master, Hogan. When they are ambushed by the local monstrous Wyldermen, Drew helps fend off the attack and protects a wounded Hogan. They make it to Brackenholme, where Bergan transforms into his werebear form to repel the last of the Wyldermen. Revealed to be Whitley's father, Bergan refuses to speak to Drew and demands that he leave, telling his daughter that King Leopold's Lionguard soldiers are already there searching for Tilly's murderer after having been tipped off by Trent. Surrounded by guards, Drew inadvertently transforms into a werewolf for the first time.\n| LineColor           = 9288FF\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Drew is imprisoned in Brackenholme and is informed by Broghan, the Duke's son and Whitley's brother, that Bergan will speak to him after the Lionguard have left the city. Alongside the soldiers, King Leopod's son Lucas is in Brackenholme for a feast celebrating his betrothal to Bergan's niece Gretchen, accompanied by ratlord magister Vankaskan and his apprentice Hector. Believing that Hector's training can help her determine Drew's true heritage, Whitley tricks the guards into allowing them access to the prison, and they realize that the discovery of a new wolflord is a threat to Leopold and Lucas' claim to the throne of Lyssia. During the feast, Lucas and Vankaskan question Bergan and his family about their prisoner, but they do not reveal Drew's identity. Lucas notices claw marks on Hector's hand, deduces that the prisoner is a werelord, and orders him to be brought to him. Drew escapes from his cell and is intercepted by Whitley. They fight briefly, but Drew is forced to transform into a wolf to save her from a fall, and they land in the Brackenholme market. The townspeople are shocked by the return of a new wolflord, while Lucas grows enraged.\n| LineColor           = 9288FF\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Duke Bergan reveals to Drew that he is the son and heir of the wolflord Wergar. Lucas and Vankaskan interrogate Drew after killing the guard standing watch over his room, with Vankaskan attacking Drew using his dark magic. Drew insists that he just wanted to speak with Bergan, as per his mother's request, which Lucas interprets as a treasonous attempt with the Bear Lord to overthrow King Leopold. Hector warns Whitley and Broghan about Lucas' plans, and they rush to rescue him. Vincent, Hector's brother and a loyalist to the lions, convinces their father, Baron Huth, not to intervene, and later asserts to Hector that he will assume the title of Baron of Redmire when their father dies, threatening to kill Hector if he tries to prevent this. Lucas moves forward with his betrothal ceremony to Gretchen so that he can depart from Brackenholme as soon as possible, planning to take Drew with him as his prisoner. Whitley, Broghan, Hector, and Bergan help Drew to escape the city, reluctantly aided by Gretchen. The escape culminates in a battle with Lucas and his guards, during which Baron Huth is killed by Vankaskan, revealing himself to have a blade made of silver, along with the rest of the Lionguards' blades. Cornered, Drew is forced to cut the ropes to a lift to escape, sending it plummeting towards the river with him, Hector, and Gretchen inside.\n| LineColor           = 9288FF\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = The trio survives the fall and flees Brackenholme in a rowboat. Gretchen and Drew argue, with the former furious that Drew has ruined her wedding and forced her to leave home against her will. She later tries to abandon the boys, but is captured by a Wyldermen tribe who worship Vala, a wereserpent werelord who cast her humanity aside and succumbed to her reptilian nature. Hector uses a forbidden communing ritual to reanimate a Coldwood, a Wylderman shaman killed by Drew, and find out where they are holding Gretchen, whom the tribe plans to sacrifice to Vala. Upon finding and rescuing her, Vala reveals herself and ambushes the group, but is ultimately defeated by Drew after a fierce battle. Drew suddenly collapses, having been poisoned by Vala's venomous bite during the struggle. Dragging him to the boat, Hector and Gretchen decide to head to the nearby village of Motley. Hector notices a black mark on his palm that he is unable to remove and hallucinates Coldwood attacking him, indicating that something had gone wrong with his earlier ritual.\n| LineColor           = 9288FF\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Vala's poison causes Drew to experience nightmares of being taken over by his werewolf side, and makes him act aggressively towards his friends. Waking up, Drew realizes the group is back in Motley and warns Hector and Gretchen that the townspeople blame him for murdering his mother. They come across a prisoner, Hamwell, who tells Drew that the Lionsguard tore the town apart searching for him. Drew reaches his family farm and finds it destroyed before fleeing and stumbling upon his mother's grave. As the poison continues to affect Drew's behaviour, the group inadvertently discovers a chest that Tilly had kept hidden. Inside are symbols of loyalty from three werelords (the bears, the stags, and the sharks) promising to protect him. They resolve to find Vega, the pirate captain wereshark, and ask for his aid. Victor gains permission from Leopold to court Whitley, much to her frustration, and Bergan reluctantly agrees to avoid suspicion from the crown.

As punishment, Leopold assigns Whitley to serve Queen Amelie, who is trapped in a trance-like state thanks to Vankaskan's dark magic. Gretchen expresses second thoughts to Hector about marrying Lucas, and tries to convince Lucas to spare Drew. When he is undeterred, she steals the key to Drew's cell, but he refuses to take it out of fear that she will be hurt when Lucas and Leopold find out that she betrayed them.
