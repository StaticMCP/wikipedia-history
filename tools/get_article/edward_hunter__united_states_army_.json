He read for the law and was prompted to major and judge-advocate for the Department of California in December 1888 and was admitted to the California Bar. At the time he was president of the California Sons of the American Revolution.\nIn 1895, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and deputy judge-advocate and adjutant general in the Department of Dakota at Fort Snelling, St. Paul, Minnesota. When the Spanish–American War broke out he served first at Chickamauga as the mustering officer and then in 1898 he served under General Brooke as judge-advocate in Puerto Rico and as secretary of the committee on evacuation.
