Considered one of the most respected musicians in Sri Lanka, Wijewardena revolutionized Sri Lankan Sinhala Pop Music with the use of the electric guitar in Sinhala music, in the 1960s. Due to his influence on Sinhala pop music, he is often named as the \"father of Sri Lankan pop music\".\nPersonal life\nClarence Wijewardena was born on 3 August 1943, in Haputale, Sri Lanka, to an estate medical practitioner. His family moved to Batugedara, Ratnapura, and Clarence abandoned a budding career as a planter to pursue music full-time. He completed education from Weeraparakrama College, Yatawatta and Hatton Highland College.\nHe married Sheela Ramadasa and they had one daughter, Amila Priyadarshani.\nWijewardena died on 13 December 1996, at the age of 53, in Sri Lanka after a long struggle against ruptured gastric ulcers and gangrene due to acute diabetes.\nCareer in musical bands\nMoonstones\nWijewardena formed the Moonstones at the age of 21 with Annesley Malewana as lead vocalist. Managed by an advertising icon, Sri Sangabo Corea, the group recorded several songs, which aired on the Saturday Star program in 1966.\nThe young musicians were mentored by Sri Sangabo Corea, together with veteran Radio Ceylon/SLBC broadcaster Vernon Corea. Vijaya Corea, gave all the radio exposure that introduced their music to the ears of the listeners and was a guide, a listening ear, mentor and encouragement in all their endeavours, throughout.\nClarence recorded songs for each of their immediate family members in gratitude.\nTheir 1968 debut EP \"Mango Nanda\" was released on the JVPC007 Philips label selling up to 5,000 copies. It included the songs Mango Nanda, Ruwan Puraya, Seetha Ude and Menike. Their second release \"More Hits by the Moonstones\" came out in November that year, on the Sooriya label and included the hits Kalu Mama, Rosa Male, Ramani and Goyam Kapanawa. Later the song Mango Nanda was selected the best Sinhala song by the Hit Parade program on Radio Ceylon as well. In 1969, the Moonstones welcomed female vocalist Indrani Perera who sang lead on the best selling hit Dilhani. Wijewardena himself only sang lead on Dileepa Podi Puthu an adaptation of a poem written by Karunaratne Abeysekera to his son.\nDuring the 'Moonstones' era, Wijewardena, who performed as a composer and music director, became a singer. Wijewardena took the initiative to start a three-member band, he was a self taught guitarist. However, later the 'Moonstones' were formed with Annesley playing the key role as lead singer. After he left the Moonstones in 1970, he held a musical show in Moratuwa with Chanaka Perera and Wijith Peiris and the show was named as \"Breakaways from the Moonstones\". The late Mike Goonesekera took over the reins of the Moonstones after the departure of Clarence.\nGolden Chimes\nWijewardena departed the Moonstones and formed a new music group called the Golden Chimes, with ex-Moonstones bassist Chanaka Perera and Lankika Perera in January 1971.

Wijewardena composed Ada Wei Iru Dina for Bharati which became an all-time hit followed by the lovely Christmas song Bethlehempure and Maa Adarai Nangiye. Clarence offered him another all-time hit Tikirimalee with Ma Mulin Liyu Pem Pathe, Desa Vidala, Bambaraku Aduna, Sarojini and Iru Dina Pamanak.\nThe Super Golden Chimes\nIn 1972, Wijewardena and Gunaratne left the Golden Chimes and they both formed a new band known as Super Golden Chimes also with the support of Annesley in 1973. Wijewardena formed the \"Super Golden Chimes\" back in the company of his lifelong friend Annesley. It was one of the most productive music groups in Sri Lanka and together they hit the number one slot in the Sri Lankan music charts on both the Sinhala and English Services of Radio Ceylon and subsequently the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. For many years they enjoyed the reputation as Sri Lanka's number one group in the 1970s and 1980s. After three years Wijewardena decided to go solo when Annesley announced his plans for marriage.\nExperiments in music\nWijewardena experimented with sitar music and introduced the sitar to some of the songs of the 'Moonstones. For the first time in Sri Lanka, he used a guitar wah wah pedal for the song Pemkathwawa for a recording.

Also he used two guitar players to play lead parts and counterparts of songs such as Sumudu Mal Pipinu and Dileepa Podi Puthu. For the first time in Sri Lanka he used the blocked guitar tone for the song Kusumalatha. Wijewardena introduced some of the guitar techniques through his songs via a single guitar harmony style in the introduction of \"Dileepa Podi Puthu\" and arpeggio styles in \"Sihina Lowak\" and \"Malata Bambareku Se\".\nWijewardena composed a song Ma Langin that was in the 1960s \"Twist\" style and released the song in Yugayen Yugayata cassette in 1989.

Sing Lanka recording studio was the first recording studio in Sri Lanka with multi tracks and Wijewardena was the pioneer to introduce this recording studio. During that time he directed music for a number of artists in Sri Lanka. He also produced a cassette tape named \"Clarence with the Rising Stars\".\nWijewardena showed his outstanding music skills during this time. He composed and directed music a song named as Maha Balwathune for the conference of the Non-Aligned Movement held in 1975 in Sri Lanka. He composed and directed music a song for the SAARC Conference as well. At the same time he sang the song Duwani Sirima when Hon.

The song Kataragama was composed by himself also certificated as the best song in Sri Lanka for the year 1974 by a pop poll conducted by Pop and Teen Fanfare.\nIn the early 1970s, Wijewardena invited Vernon Corea who had mentored him from the start to write the notes on a Lotus LP sleeve. Vernon Corea wrote: \"We have all shared the treat of your lovely Lyrics, your tuneful compositions, your friendly presentation and your spontaneous sense of sharing with your followers, your treasury of talent. Keep going, keep growing, keep glowing\". In 1976, when Vernon Corea was invited to present the first Asian radio programme in English on BBC Radio London called 'London Sounds Eastern' he played the music of Wijewardena and Annesley, introducing them to a whole new audience in London.\nWijewardena became famous for his melodious and catchy jingles aired over the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation.

Some of the early 1960s recordings were at Augie Ranaweera's studio in Bambalapitiya. Wijewardena organised three musical shows with Annesley and Indrani at BMICH in Colombo. Wijewardena proved to be quite a hit in London when broadcaster Vernon Corea broadcast his music on BBC Radio London 206 on his popular radio program, London Sounds Eastern. Wijewardena and Annesley frequently toured the United Kingdom in the 1980s playing to huge audiences in London.\nBeyond singing\nWhen the Sri Lankan cricket team became a Test cricket nation in 1982, Wijewardena produced an album called Test Cricket Souvenir, commemorating the country achieving test cricket status. The song \"Thana Nilla Dige\" performed by Saman de Silva became a hit during the season of Test cricket and every big match in Colombo.\nWijewardena was concerned and made a statement to Sathsara, an art magazine in Sri Lanka regarding the song \"Thana Nilla Dige\" and how its singer Saman De Silva was not given due credit for the song and published a full-page article about the song in a newspaper around the time of the release of the song and cassette but did not mention the name of the composer.\nControversy\nHowever, due to the popularity of his songs which has grown since his death, they have also become the subject of a lawsuit over illegally recorded renditions sampled by other Sri Lankan artists. In 2001, Wijewardena's widow Sheela filed suit against Rajiv Sebastian, hoping to recover a portion of the income earned through the use of her late husband's work. An action doomed to failure due to the non-availability of evidence on the part of the complainant. Since the lawsuit against Rajiv and Sarath Kothalawela, Sheela filed a wrongful lawsuit against Annesley Malawana and lost it with no recourse. To this date, she has been unable to establish her rightful claims as the legitimate or legal heir to his intellectual property.\nLegacy\nMany of his songs are considered classics, and continue to enjoy ample airtime on Sri Lankan television and radio broadcasts and on some overseas radio stations. The songs such as Rasa Pirunu Katha, Geeyakin Kese, Eatha Ran Wiman Yowun Sihina Loke, etc.  are very popular among present generation which again demonstrated his talent in composing music (also as a lyricist) for the future. Clarence also supported the drafting of the Code of Intellectual Property Act No. 52 of 1979 by offering his insights as an artist, advocating for musicians' rights in Sri Lanka.\nOn 21 March 2017, the concert \"Unfogettable Melodies of Clarence Live in Concert\" was held at 6.30 pm at the Nelum Pokuna Theater, Colombo.\nIn popular culture\nA biographical film based on the musical life of Clarence, titled Rhythm of the Guitar: Clarence played by Damith Wijayathunga, was released on 27 June 2025 which was directed by Theja Iddamalgoda.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081218211415/http://www.dailynews.lk/2008/12/13/fea04.asp A name etched in memory]\n* [http://www.lankatown.com/content.aspx?cid=160 An essay on Clarence Wijewardena]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100803195524/http://www.dailynews.lk/2009/08/05/art03.asp Lanka’s pop pioneer – The 66th birth anniversary of Clarence Wijewardena – August 3]\n* [https://www.chords-lk.com/artist/clarence-wijewardena/ Clarence Wijewardena Guitar Chords]\n* [https://rapsrilanka.com/clarence-wijewardena, Clarence Wijewardena song list]"
