Located in the Mountain View section of Wayne Township, New Jersey, the station was at the Parish Drive bridge over the tracks. The station was  away from its terminus at Hoboken Terminal on the shores of the Hudson River, where connections would be made to New York City via ferry and the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad. The western terminus. Denville, was  away, where connections with the Morris and Essex Railroad were available. Just west of the station was Mountain View junction, where a connection to the Erie Railroad's New York and Greenwood Lake Railway was made.\nHistory\nConstruction of the railroad through the Mountain View section of Wayne began in 1869 when the Morris and Essex Railroad began building a freight line. Mountain View station opened on May 12, 1877 after construction began in the summer of 1873 with the North Bergen Tunnel through Bergen Hill. The new tunnel would get service on the Lackawanna to Hoboken for its new terminal. The station was rebuilt in 1909 by the railroad. The Parish Drive overpass was built north of the station in 1939  as part of work for the Works Progress Administration.\nThe station closed in April&nbsp;1963 after the right-of-way through Paterson was purchased for the construction of Route&nbsp;20 and Interstate&nbsp;80. Mountain View was one of three stops closed when the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad moved service to the Main Line of the former Erie north of Paterson. The others were Totowa&ndash;Little Falls and Paterson's Marshall Street station.\nMountain View station on both the Lackawanna and the Erie served as connector points with bus service to the nearby Packanack Lake. People could commute to the lake by taking the train to either station, meeting with the free bus.\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://erierr.railfan.net/boonline.html The Delaware, Lackawanna and Western's Boonton Line]"
