The Spanish then conducted offensives against Filipino rebel encampments in the province but failed.\nBattle\nGeneral Emilio Aguinaldo was already winning battles in Cavite province, and had begun amassing huge throngs of men willing to join the Katipunan. Then he went along with a huge force to Batangas to join with generals Miguel Malvar and Candido Tirona to amass more men in the province to join the revolution. The Spanish fought hard, but one entire company of theirs was completely destroyed. As a result, the revolutionaries led by General Emilio Aguinaldo overran the Spanish positions stationed at Talisay, after the victory, people continued to join with the revolutionary army of General Aguinaldo, which he left in Cavite that was assigned for the meantime to Katipunero generals including Santiago Alvarez to continue the revolution there.\nAftermath\nTo follow up victory, General Malvar then launched a simultaneous attack in the towns of Lemery, Bayungyungan, Calaca, and Taal in the same province, but after suffering heavy losses, called off the attacks. However, the effect of the battle also prevented the afterwards severely weakened Spanish units in the province to help quell the ongoing revolution in Cavite.\nReferences\n*\n*[http://www.oocities.org/valkyrie47no/malvar.htm Miguel Malvar]"
