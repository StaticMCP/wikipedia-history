The annual parade marks the protest of the Bolsheviks against the Tsarist autocracy of the Russian Empire. The Soviet Communist Party General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev and Soviet Prime Minister Alexei Kosygin attended the parade, among other foreign leaders from the Warsaw Pact and allied countries who decided to fly in for the celebrations. Marshal Dmitry Ustinov delivered his second holiday address to the Soviet people on this day, right after the parade inspection that had been presided over by him and led by the commander of the Moscow Military District Colonel General Vladimir Govorov. Music was performed by the Combined Military Band of the Moscow Garrison conducted by Colonel Nikolai Mikhailov. As per tradition, 14 other Soviet Cities (including Leningrad) held their parades on this day. A folding stock version of the AK-47 appeared in the contingent of troops from the Soviet Airborne Forces. This parade included the updated anthem of the Soviet Union.\nInternational dignitaries\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Country\n! Dignitary\n! Position\n!
