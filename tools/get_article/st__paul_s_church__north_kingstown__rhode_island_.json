It is a single-story Romanesque Revival structure, designed by Rhode Island architect Thomas Tefft and built in 1847. Its main rectangular block has a gable roof, and narrow round-arch windows on the side walls with molded surrounds.  The front of the church is asymmetrical, with the tower on the left and its entry slightly off-center between the tower and a small projecting narthex area.  The square tower has single, narrow, round-arch windows on the first level, paired round-arch windows on the second, and clock faces on the third. A roof skirt rises to an open octagonal belfry, which is capped by a steeple and spire.\nThe church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.\nSee also\n*Old Narragansett Church, also sometimes called St. Paul's\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Washington County, Rhode Island\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.stpaulswickford.org/ St. Paul's Church in Wickford]"
