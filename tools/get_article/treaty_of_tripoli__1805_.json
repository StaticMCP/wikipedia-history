It was negotiated by Tobias Lear, an ardent Jeffersonian republican, and took effect April 12, 1806 when the United States Senate ratified the treaty.\nThe United States agreed to abandon Derna (a provincial capital in eastern Libya occupied during the war) and not to supply its mercenary allies who supported Ahmad Karamanli,  the brother of Pasha Yusuf Karamanli, in his claim to be the legitimate ruler of Tripoli. The pasha agreed in return to release Ahmad's wife and children, whom he was holding hostage. The treaty also provided for an exchange of prisoners, primarily of the 297-man crew of the USS Philadelphia in exchange for 89 prisoners held by the U.S., and for a $60,000 payment by the U.S.  to Tripoli due to the difference in numbers of prisoners exchanged.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/barmenu.asp Treaties with The Barbary Powers: 1786-1836]\n**[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/bar1805t.asp 1805 Treaty Text and Related Documents]\n*[https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsp&fileName=002/llsp002.db&recNum=637 9th Congress, 1st Session (scroll down)]"
