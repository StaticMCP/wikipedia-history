There is a memorial within Clough Road Police Station to the officers from the force who died during the First World War.\nThe force's Central Police Station has moved between a number of locations. The first station was located on Whitefriargate, purchased in 1852 from the Hull Incorporation of the Poor, and was used until a purpose-built station was opened on Alfred Gelder Street in 1902. Hull's final Central Police Station opened adjacent to Queen's Gardens in 1957, later becoming the base of Hull's Humberside Police operations until its closure for redevelopment in 2013.\nNotes\nExternal links\n* [http://www.hcpoca.co.uk/HCPOCA/About_the_HCPOCA.html Alumni Association]\n* [http://www.yorkshirefilmarchive.com/film/hull-city-police-commemoration-parade Yorkshire Film Archive]"
