The museum's exhibits are divided into permanent and temporary collections &mdash; the latter being displayed inside the museum's galleries. The permanent collection consists of historic rolling stock that is displayed on the tracks outside, including one of the few remaining armoured railway trains in Europe. The museum also contains a library which houses many books on the subject of Polish railways.\nDuring the interwar period the museum's headquarters were located at Nowy Zjazd Street.\nThe museum was reestablished at the present site, as Railway Museum in Warsaw (), in 1972.\nOn 30 July 2009, PKP S.A. the Polish state railway company served notice to quit on the Museum authorities requiring them to vacate their current location by 31 August 2009. However, as of May 2015, the museum remained in place and open to the public.\nThe museum was disestablished on 31 March 2016 and on 1 April a new institution, Stacja Muzeum, opened, taking over the exhibits and other assets.\nThere were plans to move Stacja Muzeum to a new, purpose-built object at the Odolany railway depot but the idea was eventually dropped. Another plan was to build new premises for some of the exhibits at the current site as part of the redevelopment but this idea also came to nothing and, , Stacja Muzeum is still open at the old site.\nExhibits\n* OKi1-28 Steam passenger tank locomotive, 1904,\n* Oi1-29 Steam passenger locomotive with tender, 1905,\n* TKi3-119 Steam freight tank locomotive, 1913,\n* OKo1-3  Steam passenger tank locomotive, 1920,\n* TKh1-13 Steam freight locomotive, 1920,\n* Tr6-39 Steam freight tender locomotive, 1923,\n* Os24-10 Steam passenger locomotive, 1926, actually Os24-7 with wrong number painted on it,\n* OKa1-1 Steam passenger tank locomotive, 1931,\n* OKl27-26 Steam passenger tank locomotive, 1931,\n* TKbb Nr 10282 Steam locomotive without tender, 1934,\n* TKl100-16 Steam passenger and freight locomotive with tender, 1934,\n* Pm2-34 Express steam locomotive, 1936,\n* EW51-36 Electric Multiple Unit, 1936,\n* TKz-211 Steam freight tank locomotive, 1938,\n* Pm3-3 Express steam locomotive with separate tender, 1940,\n* PzTrWg16 Motorised armoured train, 1942,\n* TKp-4147 Steam freight tank locomotive, 1942,\n* Ty2-572 Steam freight locomotive with tender, 1943,\n* TKc100-10 Steam passenger tank locomotive, 1944,\n* Tr203-451 Steam freight locomotive, 1945,\n* Ryś 1541 Narrow gauge steam locomotive, 1946,\n* Ty42-120 Steam freight locomotive, 1946,\n* Pt47-104  Express steam locomotive with tender, 1947,\n* Ty43-17 Steam freight locomotive, 1947,\n* TKt48-36 Steam passenger tank locomotive, 1951,\n* EP02-02 – Electric passenger locomotive, 1954,\n* EU20-24 Electric freight and passenger locomotive, 1957,\n* Ty51-228 Steam freight locomotive with tender, 1958,\n* ET21-66 – Electric freight locomotive, 1960,\n* SM25-002 Diesel shunter, 1962,\n* SM15-17 Diesel shunter, 1965,\n* ST44-001 Diesel freight locomotive, 1965,\n* SM41-190 Diesel shunter, 1966,\nSee also\n* Narrow Gauge Railway Museum in Sochaczew\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.szukajwarchiwach.gov.pl/zespol/-/zespol/100096 Museum history until its disestablishment in 2016] (in Polish)\n* [https://cyfrowa.stacjamuzeum.pl/ Cyfrowa Stacja Muzeum] – collection of photographs (in Polish)"
