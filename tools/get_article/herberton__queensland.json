In the , the locality of Herberton had a population of 895 people.\nGeography\nHerberton is on the Atherton Tableland in Far North Queensland. It is situated  high on the Great Dividing Range south-west of Atherton. Vegetation ranges from tropical rainforest to the east, wet sclerophyll forests to the north and east and open sclerophyll forests and woodlands to the north and west.\nThe Atherton–Herberton Road enters from the north, and Longlands Gap–Herberton Road exits to the south.\nHistory\nThe first European exploration of this area, part of the traditional land of the Dyirbal, was undertaken in 1875 by James Venture Mulligan. Mulligan was prospecting for gold, but instead found tin. The town of Herberton was established on 19 April 1880 by John Newell to exploit the tin find, and mining began on 9 May 1880. By September 1880, Herberton had a population of 300 men and 27 women. Herberton Post Office opened on 22 November 1880.\nThe town's name is attributed to John Newell. It is believed he named it after the Herbert River whose northern tributary (Wild River) flows through Herberton and/or after Robert George Wyndham Herbert, the first Premier of Queensland (after whom the Herbert River is named).\nIn July 1881, the residents of Herberton had raised £115 for the construction of a school. Herberton Provisional School opened on 12 December 1881 with 35 students in the Herberton Hall; the fee was one shilling per week for the first child of a family with an additional sixpence a week for each additional child. In October 1882 the Queensland Government reserved five acres and two roods for a state school and called for tenders to erect a state school and teacher's residence. In November 1882 the contract for the buildings was awarded to James Pasley to construct the buildings using hardwood in nine months for £2,040. In April 1883 the Queensland Government officially announced that there would be a new state school in Herberton. The actual opening date of the new state school is unclear but Thomas Peter Wood was appointed headmaster of Herberton State School from 1 January 1884, so the school was operational at that time. In 1912 the school was one of the first five schools in Queensland to receive a secondary department, commencing operations on 15 February 1912 with the arrival of the teacher Miss Ramsay B.A. who would teach two languages, English history, mathematics, and science. In 1994, a new primary school campus was established with the secondary department remaining on the original school site.\nIn January 1882, the Queensland Government called for tenders to construct a telegraph line to Herberton. In March 1882 they called for tenders for a post and telegraph office.\nThe Herberton parish of the Roman Catholic Vicariate Apostolic of Cooktown (now the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cairns) was established in 1884. On Sunday 17 March 1889 the Bishop of Cooktown John Hutchinson blessed and opened St Patrick's Catholic church in Herberton.\nHerberton Presbyterian Church was constructed in 1891, opening on 15 November 1891. In 1977 following the amalgamation of many Presbyterian churches into Uniting Church in Australia, it became the Herberton Uniting Church. On Friday 25 November 2022, the church was destroyed in a fire.\nIn the late 19th century, the Mulligan Highway was carved through the hills from Herberton and passed through what is now Main Street, Atherton, before continuing down to Port Douglas. This road was used by the coaches of Cobb and Co to access Western Queensland.\nThe tin mining in Herberton motivated the Queensland Government to build a railway line to connect Herberton to a coastal port.  Three ports were considered: Port Douglas, Cairns and Geraldton (now Innisfail), all involving a crossing of the Great Dividing Range. The route from Innisfail was shortest but would go through the roughest terrain crossing the Great Dividing Range. The route from Port Douglas was the easiest to build but it would be longest. Eventually Cairns was chosen as it had the best port (and the unstable geology of the proposed Barron Gorge route was not known at that time) and the first section of the Tablelands railway from Cairns to Redlynch at the base of the range was opened on 8 October 1887. However, the railway to Herberton was not completed until 20 October 1910 by which time the tin mining boom was over. The Tablelands railway continued from Herberton to Tumoulin opening on 31 July 1911 and then to Ravenshoe opening on 11 December 1916.\nSt Mary's Anglican School for girls was opened in 1918 by the Sisters of the Sacred Advent. The school closed in 1965.\nMount St Bernard College was established on 1 February 1921 by the Sisters of Mercy.\nThe Herberton branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association opened in 1925. In 1949 the branch acquired a building in William Street and named it the Janet Newell C.W.A. Memorial Hall to commemorate the late Janet Newell, a long-serving branch president. Janet Newell was the wife of John Newell and the daughter of William Jack, the founders of Herberton and of the chain of Jack & Newell stores, the first of which was the Jack & Newell General Store in Herberton. The C.W.A. hall was officially opened by two of Janet Newell's sons.\nTin mining ceased in Herberton in 1985.\nThe railway line from Atherton to Ravenshoe was closed in 1988 due to the World Heritage Listing of Queensland's Wet Tropics. However, the section between Herberton and Tumoulin can still be used and the Ravenshoe Steam Railway operate heritage steam train tours along the route.\nThe Herberton Public Library opened in 1995 with a major refurbishment in 2016.\nDemographics\nIn the , the town of Herberton had a population of 974 people.\nIn the , the locality of Herberton had a population of 934 people.\nIn the , the locality of Herberton had a population of 855 people.\nIn the , the locality of Herberton had a population of 895 people.\nHeritage listings\nHerberton has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* Holy Trinity Anglican Church, 38 Broadway Street ()\n* Jack & Newell General Store, Grace Street ()\n* Herberton School of Arts, 61 Grace Street ()\n* Great Northern Mine, off Jacks Road ()\n* Herberton Uniting Church (former), 2–4 Lillian Street ()\n* Herberton War Memorial, Myers Street ()\nClimate\nHerberton is notably drier than the area around Atherton with average rainfall for Herberton of .
