For example, the Hungarian monarch Béla IV is according to Croatian succession correctly titled Béla III. This is because Hungarians had a king named Béla prior to the incorporation of Croatia under the Hungarian Crown but the Croats did not.\nEarly history\nThe details of the arrival of the Croats in the Balkans are sparsely documented by more or less reliable historical sources. Around late 6th and early 7th century, they migrated from White Croatia (around present-day Galicia). According to a legend recorded in the 10th-century De Administrando Imperio, the Croats came to their present region under the leadership of five brothers (called Kloukas, Lobelos, Kosentzis, Mouchlo, and Chrobatos) and of two sisters (called Touga and Bouga), and successfully fought and expelled the Pannonian Avars influence in the Roman province of Dalmatia. The Croats started gradually converting to Christianity under the rule of Porga in the 7th century.\nEarly archons of Croats (7th century)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"  width=100%\n! width=15% | Name\n! width=10% | Reign\n! width=25% | Notes\n|-\n|Father of Porga|| first part of the 7th century || Archon when the Croats fought and expelled the Pannonian Avars and received approval by Heraclius (610–641) to settle in Dalmatia.\n|-\n|Porga|| first part of the 7th century || Archon when the Croats started to be baptized into Christianity during the time of Heraclius (610–641), or Constans II (641–668).\n|-\n|}\nDukes of Lower Pannonia (8th century–896)\nThe areas of modern-day Croatia located in the Pannonian plain had also been settled by Slavic tribes in the early Middle Ages, and history recorded some of their rulers.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"  width=100%\n! width=5%  | Portrait\n! width=15% | Name\n! width=10% | Reign start\n! width=10% | Reign end\n! width=25% | Notes\n|-\n|  ||Vojnomir|| c. 790 || c. 810 ||\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Non-contemporary\n|}\n|Ljudevit|||| c. 823 ||align=\"left\"|\n|-\n|  ||Ratimir|| c. 829 || c. 838 ||\n|-\n|  ||Braslav|| c. 882 || c. 896 || align=\"left\" | Had for spouse Ventescela.\n|-\n|}\nDukes of Croatia (8th century–925)\nThe common chronology of the dukes and kings of Croatia was conceptualized by Franjo Rački and Ferdo Šišić, but although generally accepted, has several controversial claims about the 9th and 10th century line of Trpimirović dynasty. In their interpretation of the De Administrando Imperio (which is mentioning in chronological order prince Terpimer father of Krasimer, prince Krasimer father of Miroslav who was killed by ban Pribina) the rulers, including Trpimir known from other sources as ruling cca. 845–864, have actually ruled in the first part of the 10th century and invented Trpimir II whose not mentioned in historical sources.\n* Šišić's old chronology: Borna, Vladislav, Mislav, Trpimir I, his son Zdeslav, Domagoj, unnamed Domagoj's son, Zdeslav, Branimir, Muncimir, Tomislav, Trpimir II, Krešimir I, Miroslav, Michael Krešimir II with Helen of Zadar, Stephen Držislav, Svetoslav Suronja, Gojslav, Krešimir III, Stephen I, Petar Krešimir IV, and lastly Demetrius Zvonimir with brief rule of Stephen II and Petar Snačić.\n* Komatina's revised chronology (1): Borna, Vladislav, Mislav, Trpimir, Zdeslav, Domagoj, unnamed Domagoj's son, Zdeslav, Branimir, Muncimir, Krešimir I, Miroslav, Tomislav I, Michael Krešimir II with Helen of Zadar, Stephen Držislav, Svetoslav Suronja, Gojslav, Krešimir III, Stephen I, Petar Krešimir IV, and lastly Demetrius Zvonimir with brief rule of Stephen II and Petar Snačić.\n* Đaković's revised chronology (2): Borna, Vladislav, Mislav, Trpimir, Krešimir I, Miroslav, Domagoj, unnamed Domagoj's son, Zdeslav, Branimir, Muncimir, Tomislav I, Michael Krešimir II with Helen of Zadar, Stephen Držislav, Svetoslav Suronja, Gojslav, Krešimir III, Stephen I, Petar Krešimir IV, and lastly Demetrius Zvonimir with brief rule of Stephen II and Petar Snačić.\nVišeslav of Croatia, who left behind a baptismal font day, which mentioned him being a duke, used to be considered by Croatian historiography as a duke of the Croats, but the evidence for most of the claims regarding him is too scarce.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=100%\n! width=5%  | Portrait\n! width=15% | Name\n! width=10% | Reign start\n! width=10% | Reign end\n! width=25% | Notes\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Non-contemporary\n|}\n|Borna|| c. 810 || 821 ||align=\"left\"| Vassal of Frankish Emperor Charlemagne.

All Croatian rulers after Tomislav I held the title of King of Croatia. This is confirmed by epigraphic inscription mentioning the earliest known Croatian queen (regina) Domaslava dated to first half of 10th century.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=100%\n! width=5%  | Portrait\n! width=15% | Name\n! width=10% | Reign start\n! width=10% | Reign end\n! width=25% | Notes\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" |House of Trpimirović\n|-\n||| Tomislav I || 925 || 928 ||align=\"left\"| Possibly the son of Muncimir.

He set his nephew Álmos to rule as his proxy with the title of duke (1091–1095), but he was recognized only by the Hungarian nobility. He was a claimant to the throne due to the fact that his sister was married to the late Croatian king Zvonimir who died without an heir (son Radovan predeceased Zvonimir), however, kingship over all of Croatia would not be achieved until the reign of his successor Coloman.\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" width=\"5%\" | House of Snačić\n|-\n| ||Petar Snačić || 1093/1095||1097||align=\"left\"|Petar Snačić, a Ban of Croatia, was elected to rule by the Croatian nobles, likewise before him his uncle Slavac who briefly appropriated the royal title.

Petar was the last native king of Croatia. From 1102 onwards, the Kings of Hungary were also Kings of Croatia, because of the political union of the two crowns.\n|-\n|}\nUnder the Hungarian Crown (1102–1527)\nFrom 1102, the reigning King of Hungary was also the ruler of the Kingdom of Croatia in agreement with the Croatian nobles (see Pacta conventa). Croatia was governed on his behalf by a viceroy (ban) and a parliament (sabor).

He reigned until 1918, when he renounced participation in state affairs, but did not abdicate.

Beatified by the Catholic Church.\n|-\n|}\nKings of Yugoslavia (1918–1945)\nAfter the World War I and the breakup of Austria-Hungary, Croatia joined a newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs as declared in the Zagreb Resolution (1918). Following a brief period of self-rule by National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (which was recognised by the Croatian Parliament, which beforehand proclamined national independence severing its ties to Austria-Hungary and Kingdom of Hungary and nullified the Croatian–Hungarian Settlement), after the controversial Geneva Declaration (1918) that state became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes under the Karađorđević dynasty (which was not completely accepted by the National Council nor ever confirmed by the Croatian Parliament). After the Vidovdan Constitution (1921), temporarily ceased to exist the Croatian Parliament. It was followed by 6 January Dictatorship (1929) and 1931 Yugoslav Constitution.\nThe name of the kingdom was changed in 1929, amid unitarianist reforms, to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. After the Treaty of Rapallo in 1920 Istria and parts of Dalmatia were annexed to Kingdom of Italy. On the basis of the Cvetković–Maček Agreement, and the Decree on the Banate of Croatia dated 24 August 1939, the Banate of Croatia was created. Under the Agreement was again elected Croatian Parliament (sabor) and a crown-appointed ban would decide internal matters in Croatia.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=100%\n! width=\"5%\" | Portrait\n! width=\"15%\" | Name\n! width=\"10%\" | Reign\n! width=\"10%\" | Consort(s)\n! width=\"25%\" | Notes\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" |House of Karađorđević\n|-\n|||Petar I\n| 1 December 1918 – 16 August 1921 (2 years)||Zorka of Montenegro (m. 1883)|| align=\"left\" | Son of Aleksandar, Prince of Serbia.

The Independent State of Croatia was set as a puppet state of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Soon after its creation, the state government passed three laws on the creation of the Crown of Zvonimir, which made the country de jure a kingdom. Three days later the Treaties of Rome were signed. The Italian Prince Aimone of Savoy-Aosta was designated King of Croatia. Numerous Adriatic islands and a portion of Dalmatia were annexed by Italy, which all combined to become the Italian Governonate of Dalmatia. On 10 September 1943 Independent State of Croatia declared that the Treaties of Rome were null and void and annexed the portion of Dalmatia that had been ceded to Italy.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Portrait\n! width=\"15%\" | Name\n! width=\"10%\" | Reign\n! width=\"10%\" | Consort(s)\n! width=\"25%\" | Notes\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" |House of Savoy\n|-\n|  || Tomislav II (King-designate)|| 18 May 1941 – 31 July 1943 ||Irene of Greece|| align=\"left\" |Tomislav II established a Croatian royal office (kraljevski stol) in Florence and later in Rome.
