But the plot, though completely superficial, is trimly tailored and does suggest a little of the pressure under which Germans of conscience laboured in the pre-war period. The climax, with Brauwitz's suicide and Gerda's volte-face, is hardly convincing. But Gerard Heinz and Margaret Tyzack do their best by the sketchily-written roles of Constantin and his wife. Nazi thuggery is kept down to a minimum and the direction has one or two telling moments.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
