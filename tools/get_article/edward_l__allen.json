He was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia part of Newfoundland, and emigrated in 1845. In 1861, he became the first professional photographer in Boston, Massachusetts. He kept a studio on Temple Place in Boston (c. 1868–1871). For some years, he worked in partnership with Frank Rowell (as \"Allen & Rowell\"). Examples of Allen's photographs reside in the Boston Public Library and the Boston Athenaeum.\nImage gallery\nImage:Interior, Faneuil Hall, by E. L.
