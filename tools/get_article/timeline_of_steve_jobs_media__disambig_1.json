There really isn't a penalty for failure either psychologically or economically in the sense that, if you have a good idea and you go out to start your own company, even if you fail, you're generally considered worth more to the company you left because you've gained all this valuable experience, in many disciplines.\"\n|-\n|1982\n|\n|Academy of Achievement\n|[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymbD_a-G1IQ Audio (YouTube)]\n|\n*Money does not define success\n*To be intelligent is to have a bird's eye view of the city while others are navigating the streets below.\n*The key to making connections that lead to innovation is to have a collection of out of the ordinary experiences to draw from.\n*Bright people are corralled onto a beaten path.

They run a million instructions per second\n* Programmers build a collection of low level instructions into higher level instructions\n* Early electric motors of the late 1890s initially were large thus were applied to large scale applications. They didn't proliferate quickly\n* Later electric motors drove a shaft through a factory to empower multiple workstations simultaneously\n* The fractional horsepower electric motor was a breakthrough because it was applied to small individual applications\n* There are approximately 55 fractional horsepower motors in every household\n* The history of computers parallels the history of electric motors\n* ENIAC the first computer, was giant, hardly anyone got a chance to use it\n* A 1960s computing breakthrough was Time-sharing. Many people could share a large computer e.g. on a college campus\n* \"The reason Apple exists is because we stumbled on to the fractional horsepower computer 5 years before anybody else.\"\n* \"We made a computer that was about 13 pounds\"\n* The first PC was invented in 1976. In 1983 the industry will ship 3 million personal computers\n* By 1986, we will ship more computers than automobiles in the USA\n* \"...I need your help. If you've looked at computers, they all look like garbage. All of the great product designers are off designing automobiles/buildings but hardly any of them are designing computers.\"\n* The industry will sell 10 million computers whether they look ugly or great because people are going to be spellbound/elated\n* \"It doesn't cost any more money to make it look great\"\n* They are going to be these new objects that are going to be in everyone's working environment, educational environment, and home environment\n* \"We have a shot at putting a great object there (work, school, home) and if we don't, we are going to put one more piece of junk object there\"\n* By 1986 people will be spending two or three hours a day interacting with computers\n* Industrial design, the software design should be given the same consideration that we give automobiles if not a lot more\n* \"Most of the objects of our life are not designed in America. We've blown it\"\n* \"Computers and society are out on a first date in the 80s.\"\n* \"We have a chance to make these things beautiful. We have a chance to communicate something through the design of the objects themselves.\"\n* Apple alone will spend over 100 million dollars over the next 12 months on media advertising. IBM will spend at least that amount\n* The personal computer is a new medium of communication. One of the media. e.g. books, radio, television, newspapers\n* Computer communication is different from other mediums. Telephone demands both parties of a conversation be simultaneously present. Computers do not have this requirement.\n* \"One of these days when we have portable computers with radio links, they can be walking around Aspen and retrieve it. (e-mail)\"\n* \"The process of communication changes as the mediums evolve.\"\n* When a new media emerges, we tend to fall back into old media habits\n* The first TV shows are basically radio shows with a television camera pointed at them\n* It took the better part of the 1950s for television to come 'into its own' as a medium\n* John F. Kennedy funeral television broadcast gave people a level of intensity that would not have been possible with radio\n* The Apollo program landing. That experience was not possible with the previous medium\n* It took 20 years for television to evolve away from radio\n* \"Optical video discs\" (Laserdisc) can store 55 thousand images on a side, or an hour of video randomly accessible. What are we using it for? Movies. We're dropping back into old media habits.\"\n* 5 to 10 years from now, random access storage will 'come into its own'\n* 1979 MIT experiment, Aspen Movie Map. A precursor of Google Street View is stored on laserdisc and reveals that random access storage will differentiate itself from other media\n* We are still running historic applications on personal computers e.g. business accounting, COBOL\n* Apple Lisa enables a person with little talent to draw artistic pictures, transmit them via e-mail\n* Computer programs are an idea expressed on paper. They enable thousands of individual experiences based on one set of underlying principles\n* Hamurabi video game. 7 year old kids are playing with a macro economic model. Interactive learning\n* Books were a way to learn without an intermediary teacher. \"The problem was, you can't ask Aristotle a question.\"\n* Maybe in the next 50 to 100 years we will enable computer to capture an individual's underlying spirit, set of principles, world so that after they are gone we can ask the computer a question and receive an answer consistent with that individual\n* Ultimately computers are going to be used for communication and over the next 5 years the standards for interconnecting computers are going to evolve. They all speak different languages right now.\n* Early Xerox PARC local area network list server revealed special interest groups in the office. Soon there were more interest groups than there were employees.\n* As computers are networked (on the internet), they will facilitate the creation of special interest groups and bring together the people in those groups. (Social Networking)\n* Office local area network are about 5 years away\n* Home local area network are about 10 to 15 years away\n* \"We want to put an incredibly great computer in a book that you can carry around with you, that you can learn how to use in 20 minutes. That's what we want to do. And we want to do it this decade. And we really want to do it with a radio link in it so that you dont have to hook up to anything. So you are in communication with all of these larger databases and other computers.\"\n* Apple sets out \"To design the computer that we want to put into the book eventually even though we cannot put it into the book now and it's called Lisa.\"\n* Apple Lisa is sold out for the first year\n* Eventually we will get to the point where people can create images as good as any other way.\n|-\n|1983\n|Hawaii\n|Apple Sales meeting\n|\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSiQA6KKyJo Video (YouTube)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140103095022/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSiQA6KKyJo Video (Archive.org)]\n|\n* In 1958 IBM fails to buy Xerox\n* 1968 IBM dismisses the DEC minicomputer as too small\n* 1977 Apple invents the Apple II, the first personal computer\n* IBM dismisses the personal computer as too small\n* 1981 Apple II is the world's most popular computer\n* Apple grows to a $300 million corporation, fastest growing corporation in American history\n* November 1981 IBM introduces the IBM PC\n* 1983 Apple and IBM computer industry's strongest competitors\n* 1983 Apple and IBM each sell $1 billion in personal computers\n* First major computer firm goes bankrupt.

They insert lots of layers of middle management between the people running the company and the people doing the work.\"\n* \"Apple is an Ellis Island company. Apple is built on refugees from other companies. These are the extremely bright individual contributors who were troublemakers at other companies.\"\n* Dr. Edwin Land (founder of Polaroid) saw the intersection of art and science and business and built an organization to reflect that\n* \"...Dr. Land one of those brilliant troublemakers, was asked to leave his own company‐‑which is one of the dumbest things I’ve ever heard of.\"\n* A visionary that brings together art and science is the most important thing to be, not a football player or astronaut\n* In 5 to 10 years John Sculley and Jobs intend to make Apple a 10 or 20 billion dollar company\n* That scale is merely to remain competitive. The bigger concern is how that scale is achieved.\n* Apple hires people that want to make large contributions today not await permission to do so years from now.\n* People/workers rarely get to contribute to the pool of innovation which we all rely upon.\n* Rather than focus on Fortune 500 customers, focus on how to change how small groups/businesses work.\n* There should not be one computing standard. Macintosh is clearly better than IBM. Innovation emerges via competition.\n* IBM will eventually crush companies that are compatible with their systems\n* To reach tens of millions of people, a computer that is significantly different from IBM is needed. Hence Macintosh.\n* IBM believes in service, support, security, mainframes, and 'motherhood'.\n* \"Apple’s key observation three years ago was that when you’re shipping 10,000,000 computers a year, even IBM does not have enough mothers to ship one with every computer. So you’ve got to build motherhood into the computer.\"\n* If Apple makes a mistake and IBM wins, the world will enter a computer Dark Ages for 20 years.\n* Frito-Lay, a company that dominates a market via service and support and stifles newcomers in their market.\n* IBM dominated and therefore did not innovate in the mainframe industry for 15 years.\n* The IBM platform is a repackaging of dated Apple II level technology\n* Apple and IBM won't have much competition in the hardware space. The days of significant hardware start-ups are gone.\n* New, innovative companies will focus on software.\n|-\n|1985\n|Svaneholm Castle, Sweden\n|Apple University Consortium Europe, Lund University with Håkan Westling\n|\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qLuerYx2IA Video (YouTube)]\n* [https://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/prominent-guests-at-lund-university/id491028102 Video (iTunes)]\n* Video (Quicktime)\n|\n* Computers can revolutionize education\n* Cooperation of European universities\n* Computer is a new medium among print, television, and radio\n* Initially, new mediums are based on old mediums\n* Aristotle was Alexander the Great's tutor\n* Petrochemical Revolution\n* Information Revolution\n* Free intellectual energy from computers\n* Computers will enable us to interact with Aristotles of the future\n* Henry Ford\n* \"The automobile had a historical imperative\"\n* Computers will forever change education as soon as 5 years from now\n* Jobs's dream is to sell Macintoshes to the Soviet Union\n|-\n|1985\n| Redwood City, CA and Pebble Beach, CA\n|'Entrepreneurs' documentary\n|[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loQhufxiorM Video]\n|\n* NeXT Computer logo\n* Building a company\n* Leadership/communicating the vision\n* Product price\n* Delivery window\n* Financing/Expenses\n|-\n|1987\n|Pittsburgh, PA\n|Interview with Connor Freff Cochran\n|\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C78c_7MZf_I Video (YouTube)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20210323123531/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C78c_7MZf_I Video (Archive.org]\n|\n* Addressing the needs of higher education\n* Simulating historical models and making simulation building software\n* Taking time to observe the needs of a group of scholars in order to design and create productive tools\n* Delivering a paradigm shift in the curriculum of higher education for the first time since the 1960s.\n* Higher education introduces change to society\n|-\n|1988\n|Redwood City, CA\n|NeXTStep demonstration of MIDI and quotation application\n|\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J36lUowZn8A Video (YouTube)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160507114257/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTFFimZnlaU Video (Archive.org)]\n|\n* Demonstrates NeXTStep operating system\n* Humans are tool builders and have created tools such as the bicycle, telescope, language, and mathematics to amplify their inherent abilities.\n* Until 1988, computers have been used to revolutionize science and industry.\n* In 1988, computers have finally become powerful enough to have the same impact in the arts and humanities.\n* Digital libraries allow for searching through vast amounts of knowledge quickly such as the complete works of William Shakespeare in under a second.\n* Jobs is interested in the future and uses the digital library to search for quotes about it from George Orwell and Lincoln Steffens.\n* Having the knowledge of civilization accessible at our fingertips will be revolutionary in the humanities.\n* The computer has become good enough to synthesize music of quality to accompany human virtuoso violinist.\n* The music is synthesized from pure mathematics and created about a tenth of a second before it is heard.

Developers who go through NeXT's software camp will go back raving about NeXTSTEP and telling their own management that NeXTSTEP will allow them to build their custom app three times faster than Sun.\n* NeXT's productivity app suite dwarfs that of Sun and includes breakthrough apps such as Lotus Improv and WYSIWYG WordPerfect. Once customers are in the professional workstation category, the productivity app comparison is no longer against PCs and Macs, it's against Sun and NeXT is winning hands down.\n* Interpersonal computing improves group productivity and collaboration through the use of sophisticated desktop computers and will be the largest reason people are buying NeXT computers within 24 months.\n* Regis McKenna once said \"the best marketing is education\".\n|-\n|1991\n|Portland, Oregon\n|Reed College Howard Vollum Award acceptance speech\n|\n*[https://soundcloud.com/allaboutstevejobs/steve-jobs-reed-vollum-award Audio (Soundcloud)] (with intro by Richard Crandall)\n|\n*I never graduated from Reed College\n*Roman Meal is the cheapest way to live\n*Several of us would show up for meals at the Hare Krishna temple\n*Situational ethics\n*Reed College dean Jack Dudman\n*Generosity\n*Character is built not in good times but in bad times\n|-\n|1991\n|Redwood City, CA\n|The state of the industry on the 10th anniversary of the IBM PC\n|\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzZB5pZTslE Video (Youtube)]\n|-\n|1992\n|Cambridge, MA\n|MIT Sloan Distinguished Speaker Series\n|[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk-9Fd2mEnI Video (Youtube)]\n|\n|-\n|1993\n|Redwood City, CA\n| Interview on Paul Rand\n|[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb8idEf-Iak Video]\n|\n* Paul Rand\n* Logos\n* Working relationship with clients\n|-\n|1993\n|San Francisco, CA\n| NeXTWORLD EXPO Keynote Moscone Center\n|[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mC90DnaY60 Video (YouTube)]\n|\n|-\n|1994\n|Redwood City, CA\n| Steve Jobs in 1994: The Rolling Stone Interview\n|[https://web.archive.org/web/20110121144227/https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/steve-jobs-in-1994-the-rolling-stone-interview-20110117 Text (Archive.org)]\n|\n|-\n|1994\n|\n|[http://www.siliconvalleyhistorical.org/ Santa Clara Valley Historical Association] Silicon Valley Documentary\n|\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140515200559/http://www.siliconvalleyhistorical.org/home/steve_jobs_secrets_of_life#!steve-jobs-film/c1x1c Santa Clara Valley Historical Association - Steve Jobs: Visionary Entrepreneur (Archive.org)]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkTf0LmDqKI Video Clip 1]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFURM8O-oYI Video Clip 2]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYfNvmF0Bqw Video Clip 3]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160203053432/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vk8HYHngzds Video Clip 4]\n|\n* Bill Hewlett\n* Failure\n* Changing the world\n* Blue Box\n|-\n|1995\n|Redwood City, CA\n|Steve Jobs: 'The Lost Interview'; Robert X.

Now its 25 million people.\n*Money is not a good reason to start a company\n*Start a company to express an idea. Sometimes that's the only way to get people to listen.\n*You permeate values to employees by example, ultimately.\n*When a product is not quite good enough, we try to stop what we are doing and make it great before we ship it.\n*Employees and others observe how senior management handle problems with products.\n*\"Everybody watches very carefully when you are in a difficult situation, what decisions you make, what values you have.\"\n*We try to hire very smart people. We have a very simple organization and focus on doing very few things well.\n*\"Focussing does not mean saying yes, it means saying no.\" We decide to do very few things.\n*People want to do something great, be excited about what they do, and be recognized for their work.\n*Its very motivating to envision a project in the hands of up to 25 million people\n*We try to allow people to do the best work of their lives.\n*Because others copy Apple, Apple can influence the whole industry beyond the 25 million Apple users.\n*Apple is in a great spot today, 3 or 4 years ago it was fragile.\n*Apple has focussed on the internet for the last 6–7 years.\n*\"I love the internet but the internet has no emotion to it. Its very intellectual.\" It is only one thing we can do with computers.\n*Most people don't have the internet bandwidth to deliver emotion.\n*\"To deliver emotion, you have to have higher bandwidth.\"\n*At Apple, we want to stand at the intersection of technology and humanities.\n*We want to bring the humanist side into these tools. We don't just want to serve the intellectual side.\n*There are a lot of forces in life that tend to funnel us down into an institutionalized path where people forget that they are very unique.\n*The whole computer industry wants to forget about the humanist side and just focus on the technology.\n*A lot of our industry just focusses on more is better. More \"megahertz and megabytes\" we call it \"feeds and speeds\".\n*We can do more with computers than just spreadsheets and word processors.\n*We want to help you express yourself in richer ways in your music, movies, photography.\n*Instead of storing unwatched videotapes, you want to edit them down into a little movie that you can share with others.\n*(You don't have to be creative to emotionally express yourself.) We have had over a million customers make movies with iMovie.\n*The whole personal computer industry has not previously addressed the emotional and creative side of people. It has only spoken to the side of us that is calculating numbers.\n*At last, with this digital lifestyle era opening, we are going to address some of these (emotional applications of computers).\n*I visualize things at most about 1 to 4 years down the road.\n*Some 5 year planning is essential, but most 5 year planning changes within a few years.\n|-\n|2001\n|Cupertino, CA\n|iPod (1st generation) introduction at Apple One Infinite Loop campus\n|\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc_FiHTITHE Video (YouTube)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160613212752/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc_FiHTITHE Video (archive.org)]\n|\n|-\n|2002\n|\n| 60 Minutes (Overtime)\n| [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uKR0nsrPmA Video]\n|\n* Analog generation loss\n* George Lucas\n* Lucas hired Edwin Catmull from New York Institute of Technology\n* Jobs bought computer group from Lucas in 1986 with a vision to create the world's first computer generated animated film\n* The Beatles as an example of a team\n* Business is best executed as a team effort\n* My greatest strength is hanging out with great and talented people\n* All of us need to be on guard against arrogance\n* There wouldn't have been a Pixar if Jobs had not been fired from Apple\n* Returning to Apple after being fired 12 years earlier was an example of the circle of life\n* Computer industry is in its infancy\n|-\n|2005\n|Palo Alto, CA\n|Stanford Commencement Address\n|[http://www.singjupost.com/steve-jobs-2005-stanford-commencement-address-full-transcript Text]\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc Video]\n|\n*Adoption\n*Attending and dropping out of Reed College\n*Hare Krishna\n*Calligraphy\n*Serifs, Kerning, and Typography\n*Macintosh was the first computer with beautiful typography\n*\"Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well-worn path and that will make all the difference.\"\n*Hiring John Sculley\n*Getting fired by Apple's board of directors\n*NeXT Computer technology is at the heart of Apple's renaissance.\n*Marriage and family with Laurene Powell Jobs\n*\"The only way to do great work is to love what you do.\"\n*Pancreatic cancer\n*Whole Earth Catalog\n*Stewart Brand\n*\"Stay hungry.
