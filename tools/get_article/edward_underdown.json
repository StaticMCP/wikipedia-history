There his looks resulted in him being nominated 'Pop Bitch' – the prettiest boy available to the senior students of Pop, the Eton Society.\nNotable work\nUnderdown's early theatre credits include: Noël Coward's Words and Music and Tonight at 8.30; Cole Porter's Nymph Errant; Moss Hart & Irving Berlin's  Stop Press; and Streamline.\nHis film credits include: They Were Not Divided, Beat the Devil, Wings of the Morning, The Rainbow Jacket, ''The Woman's Angle, Her Panelled Door, The Camp on Blood Island, Dr. Terror's House of Horrors, Thunderball, Khartoum, The Magic Christian and Digby, the Biggest Dog in the World.\nTelevision appearances include: Dad's Army, Danger Man, The Saint, The Avengers, The Rat Catchers, Weavers Green, Man in a Suitcase, Doomwatch, The Regiment, Colditz, Upstairs, Downstairs, Survivors, The Duchess of Duke Street and Doctor Who.\nBoth Wings of the Morning and The Rainbow Jacket were set in his beloved racing world, the former being set on Epsom Downs. Wings of the Morning'', starring Henry Fonda, was Britain's first Technicolor film.\nEdward Underdown was also a gentleman jockey and rode with great aplomb in both flat and hurdle races (see references to his riding career in John Hislop's books).\nIn 1950 he was voted by British exhibitors as the most promising male screen newcomer.\nAccording to Ian Fleming's stepson, Underdown was the novelist's preferred choice for James Bond.\nPersonal life\nUnderdown married Hon. Rosemary Sybella Violet Grimston, daughter of Robert Grimston, 1st Baron Grimston of Westbury and Sybil Rose Neumann, on 10 February 1953. Charles Underdown and Rosemary Grimston were sixth cousins through their common ancestors Thomas Villiers, 1st Earl of Clarendon and Lady Charlotte Capell.\nHe died on 15 December 1989 in Hampshire aged 81.\nTheatre appearances\n* Words and Music, Adelphi Theatre, London (1932-1933).

It was here that Edward learnt and developed his riding.\nBefore his career as an actor Edward was a gentleman jockey and rode with great aplomb both on the flat and over sticks (see references to his riding career in John Hislop's books).\nThe Norfolk estate is mentioned in Bill Pertwee's book about the making of ''Dad's Army''. One of the Dad's Army episodes was by co-incidence filmed at the estate. By this time the estate was owned by the War Office and nothing was left except for the verandah and stables. As soon as John Le Mesurier arrived he realised it was familiar to him from weekend parties Edward's father had invited him to in the 1930s. So it was that Edward found himself working in a television series that featured part of his old home.\nThe films Wings of the Morning and The Rainbow Jacket'' were set in his beloved racing world, the former being set on Epsom Downs.\nFinally, after his acting career he worked as a steward at Newbury Racecourse. This was described by Bill Pertwee as \"fitting for a man who not only loved horses but was also an expert rider.\" (ibit, page 86).\nMilitary service\nOn wanting to sign-up, Edward Underdown's first approach was to the Wiltshire Yeomanry. He reputedly appeared at the depot with his friend, Sandy Carlos Clarke, who had recently returned from Canada working as a ranch hand. When asked by the recruiting Sergeant to state their professions, Underdown replied, \"film star\" and Carlos Clarke answered, \"cowboy\" and thinking this was a joke, the sergeant stated that their services were not required. Underdown did subsequently join the Wiltshire Yeomanry whilst Clarke found a post with another Yeomanry regiment.\nUnderdown went on to have a distinguished Second World War record as an officer in the Wiltshire Yeomanry serving in the 8th Army in Africa.\nAfter the war Edward resumed his acting career but remained in the Territorial Army. He remained in the Territorial Army Reserve of Officers until he reached the age limit. He retired as captain on 7 November 1959 and retained the rank of honorary major.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
