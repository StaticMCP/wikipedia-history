In 1972, the National Association of Tenants Organisations officially called for a national rent strike across all of the Republic of Ireland. The rent strike largely ended on August 1973 after the government conceded.\nBackground\nB-scale rent system of the Housing Act 1966 resulted in increased rent burden on tenants living in social housing. Additionally, a lack of services in social housing estates, and desire for greater control over the estates by the tenants added further difficulties.\nIn 1967, the National Association of Tenants Organisations (NATO) was founded as an umbrella of local tenants' organisations. The organisation positioned itself as nonpartisan, primarily to prevent co-option by Fianna Fáil.\nStrike action\nGrievances culminated in March 1970 when rent strikes broke out Ballyphehane, Cork, and Ballymun, Dublin. In late 1972 the National Association of Tenants Organisations called for an all-out national rent strike. At the peak of the strike, 35,000 households were participating, totalling 350,000 people.\nFollowing the 1973 Irish general election, the NATO successfully negotiated with the Fine Gael-Labour coalition government an end to the strike and achieved rent reductions, better terms for tenant purchase of social housing, and for official recognition of the NATO in representing social tenants.\nDespite this, strike action in Cork partially continued under the Joint Cork Corporation Tenants Council.\nRelationship with other political forces\nTensions existed between the NATO and trade unions leadership despite support from trade union membership. Trade union members would often mobilise to support striking tenants in resisting eviction attempts. There were also tensions with the Irish Women's Liberation Movement.\nLabour Party had a complex relationship with the rent strike, with Labour councillors often adopting positions that conflicted with one and other. Rent strike action was supported by parties further left, with such parties participating in the rent strike to an extent. One member of the NATO's executive was also a member of Official Sinn Féin although the strike received only limited coverage in the Official Sinn Féin's newspaper. The Communist Party of Ireland reported frequently on the strike in its newspaper, and one Communist Party figure chaired the Ballyfermot Community Association – one of the largest NATO affiliates. There was some hesitance, even by those with partisan affiliations, to have these parties be too involved. Regardless of partisan affiliation of the individuals involved in strike action, participants were deeply invested in the movement.\nLegacy\nIn 2019, the tenants' union Community Action Tenants Union was established with organisers partially inspired by the NATO and the rent strike of the early 1970s. CATU has shown interest in researching the 70s rent strike, and prior to CATU-assisted research into the rent strike, very little literature or records existed on the rent strike. In 2024, a documentary film covering the events titled Rent Strike was produced by the Upstate Theatre Project with assistance from CATU.\nSee also\n* Dublin Housing Action Committee\n* Derry Housing Action Committee\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*"
