Actually, when the painting was made (1765–66), the regiment had already been disbanded; Gordon, then on half-pay, evidently kept the uniform and had it with him when visiting Rome, where he met Batoni.]]\nThe 105th Regiment of Foot ('Queen's Own Royal Regiment of Highlanders') was a short-lived British line infantry regiment. It was raised in Perthshire by Major-General David Graeme as a two-battalion regiment on 15 October 1760 by converting independent companies. It was named after Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, who had been selected as the wife for the future George III of Great Britain. The regiment served in Ireland and was disbanded in 1763.\nReferences"
