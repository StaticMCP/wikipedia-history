This Android app is a part of the larger TAK family of products.  ATAK has a plugin architecture which allows developers to add functionality. This extensible plugin architecture that allows enhanced capabilities for specific mission sets (Direct Action, Combat Advising, Law Enforcement, Protection Operations, Border Security, Disaster Response, Off-grid Communications, Precision Mapping and Geotagging).\nIt enables users to navigate using GPS and geospatial map data overlaid with real-time situational awareness of ongoing events. The ATAK software represents the surrounding area using the military standard APP-6 symbology, and customized symbols such as icons from Google Earth and Google Maps for iconography and the Cursor on Target data format standard for communication.\nInitially created in 2010 by the Air Force Research Laboratory, and based on the NASA WorldWind Mobile codebase its development and deployment grew slowly, then rapidly since 2016.\nAs of 2020, ATAK has a growing base of 250,000 military and civilian users across numerous public safety agencies and US partner nations, and has seen the addition of 15 United States Department of Defense programs.\nDevelopment and usage\nATAK began in August 2010 and was originally based on NASA WorldWind Mobile. The goal was to demonstrate robust information sharing in a mobile format.\nIn 2013, officials at Draper Laboratory said that the system would be compatible with Android mobile operating systems and could be used for navigation, spatial awareness, and controlling drones.\nOn October 14, 2014, U.S. Army Geospatial Center recommended AFRL's Android Team Awareness Kit (ATAK), over the world-leader Esri's Commercial Joint Mapping Tool Kit (CJMTK), NASA's World Wind, and the Army's Globe Engine (AGE) for map engine driving the Nett Warrior End User Device.  ATAK was selected due to similar capabilities with CJMTK, similar risk, and less than one-third of the total cost.\nAccording to a January 2016 article in National Defense Magazine, \"[ATAK] has already been fielded to AFSOC units\".\nIn September 2015, DARPA reported that ATAK was used in a successful demonstration of the Persistent Close Air Support Program, and is in use by thousands of users.\nPolaris integrated its Ground Guidance software into an ATAK Plugin to allow on and off-road routing for mounted and dismounted soldiers, accounting for terrain, weather, enemy activity and equipment load.\nIn 2018, USAF Security Forces deployed ATAK at Eglin AFB, Florida.\nThe Android Team Awareness Kit or TAK is currently used by thousands of Department of Homeland Security personnel, along with other members of the Homeland Security Enterprise including state and local public safety personnel. It is in various stages of transition across DHS components and is the emerging DHS-wide solution for tactical awareness.\nTAK has supported the rescue of over 2,000 people during disaster response for seven major hurricanes (Harvey, Irma, Maria, Florence, Lane, Michael, and Dorian). The capability is also regularly used during daily public safety operations and national security special events like United Nations General Assembly meetings and the Super Bowl.\nATAK versions\nATAK has various end-user versions:\n* ATAK - Civilian (ATAK-CIV) - A distribution controlled but fully-releasable version of the TAK Product line for First Responders, Licensed Commercial Developers.

WinTAK is an application developed for the Microsoft Windows Operating System which uses maps to allow for precise targeting, intelligence on surrounding land formations, navigation, and generalized situational awareness. It was developed in conjunction with ATAK to provide similar functionality on a Windows platform.\nCommercial licensing\nIn January 2015, AFRL began licensing ATAK through TechLink to U.S. companies, for commercial use to support state/local government uses as well as civilian uses.  As of January 2020, one hundred companies have licensed ATAK for commercial uses. Corona Fire Department is one example of a local public safety agency using ATAK. Corona uses PAR Government's Team Connect platform to leverage ATAK. In civilian use, ATAK is often referred to as Android Team Awareness Kit.\nFederal Government release\nAs of March 31, 2020, the civilian version of ATAK, referred to as CivTAK has been approved for \"Public Release\" by Army Night Vision and is available for download on takmaps.com and subsequently named Android Team Awareness Kit (ATAK) - Civilian.\nLicense grant\nUpon running ATAK-PR 4.0.0.1, the application splash screen shows a statement; \"Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited.\".
