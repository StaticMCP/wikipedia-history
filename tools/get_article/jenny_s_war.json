In the film the prison camp was known as Stalag Luft 4B but in reality it was a group of disused billet huts in some woods at Thoresby Hall, which was then owned by the Coal Board and which has now been turned into a day spa.\nBredon School's Pull Court was used as a Nazi headquarters.\nA short mini-series made for TV, ''Jenny's War'' was first screened on ITV and subsequently released on VHS.\nPlot\nIn 1941, Jenny Baines, an American living in England learns that her son, an RAF flier, has been shot down over Germany.  Jenny goes into Germany, both as a courier for British Intelligence and also to search for her son.  She enlists the help of Karl, her estranged husband who is also a Nazi officer, and he informs her that her son is dead.\nBut Jenny is resourceful and discovers that her son Peter may be in a German POW camp.  However, her enquiries have attracted the attention of the Gestapo and she must disguise herself as a man to avoid capture.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
