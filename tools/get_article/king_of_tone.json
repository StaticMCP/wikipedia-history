      "text": "# King of Tone\n\nThe King of Tone is an overdrive pedal manufactured by boutique electric guitar effects pedal maker Mike Piera and his company Analog Man.  Released in 2005, the King of Tone is a modified version of the then-discontinued Marshall Bluesbreaker pedal.  Among guitarists, the King of Tone has gained \"near-mythical\" status, with a famously years-long waiting list and prices on the used market greatly exceeding the cost of a new pedal.  To meet demand, Piera launched a simplified, lower-cost version, the Prince of Tone, as well as collaborated with the brand MXR on a mini-format, mass-produced version, the Duke of Tone.\nHistory\nIn 1991, Marshall released its \"Bluesbreaker\" overdrive, an attempt to recreate, in pedal format, the tone of the brand's famous Bluesbreaker amplifier.  While later regarded as a classic overdrive circuit, the Bluesbreaker pedal was limited in its gain and tonal range and failed to sell well, with its discontinuation coming the following year.  Jim Weider of The Band later expressed his desire for an improved version of Marshall's pedal to Mike Piera of Bethel, Connecticut.  Under the name \"Analog.Man\", Piera had begun dealing in vintage guitar gear while employed as a software engineer in Tokyo, Japan in the early 1990s, before turning to modifying effects pedals and then designing his own.\nPiera's collaboration with Weider resulted in the King of Tone in 2005.  It was essentially two modified Bluesbreaker-style overdrive circuits in one enclosure, each with independent controls and internal DIP switches to choose between boost, overdrive, and distortion modes.  (JHS Pedals founder Josh Scott later wrote that while the King of Tone's topology is based on that of the Bluesbreaker, the end result of Piera's changes is a \"very, very different\" pedal and that claims of the King of Tone being a Bluesbreaker \"clone\" are incorrect.)\nThe King of Tone sold well upon release, with Piera initially building units himself by hand.  His pedal developed a more significant following, however, after Piera appeared on the YouTube channel \"That Pedal Show\" in 2017.  Orders soon reached 200 per day—far more than Piera could keep up with—and the King of Tone developed a famously years-long waiting list, while prices on the used market far exceeded the cost of a new pedal.  Guitar.com partly attributed this to Piera being so meticulous in his builds that he would rely on components even if they were already out of production and inevitably difficult to source.  In 2025, the waiting list for a new King of Tone stood at approximately four years, while used \"V2\" versions of the pedal from the early 2000s could surpass $2,000, the highest secondhand prices for an overdrive pedal behind only the Klon Centaur.  Piera has rejected theories that the waiting list is a marketing strategy designed to create hype around the King of Tone, stating that maintaining the list was an administrative hassle he had to hire another employee just to deal with.  Piera also rejected the notion of large price increases in response to public demand for his pedal, as Piera does not want to price the pedal out of the average player's reach.  In 2019, the price of a standard King of Tone was $245.  That price had risen to $335 by 2025 due to tariffs and the increasing costs of difficult-to-source parts.\nVariants\nUnable to meet demand and unwilling to cut corners to speed up manufacturing, Piera developed a single-sided variation, the Prince of Tone, that would be manufactured in China.  The Prince of Tone incorporated several revisions to the King of Tone design, increasing the gain and improving the distortion mode.  However, Piera's preferred components were scarce and the pedal was made in limited numbers that still sold out quickly.\nIn 2022, Piera partnered with MXR to release a mini-format, mass-produced version of the Prince of Tone, dubbed the Duke of Tone.  The collaboration began when Jeorge Tripps, founder of Way Huge and MXR's chief designer, suggested pairing Piera's design with MXR's global manufacturing capacity.  In response to the pedal's impending release, the \"online guitar world lost their collective shit\", according to Guitar.com.  By the next year, the Duke of Tone was already MXR's bestselling pedal.  Piera engaged in a second collaboration on a King of Tone-style pedal, this time in 2025 with Chase Bliss Audio on their AM Brothers overdrive, which combines analog and digital architecture to give the user extended controls of the pedal.\nReception\nThe King of Tone is one of the most celebrated overdrive pedals ever made, with Vintage Guitar dubbing it one of a few \"holy grail\" overdrives and Guitar.com attributing it \"near-mythical\" status within the industry.  The latter wrote:\nNotable fans of the pedal include Ed O'Brien, Brad Whitford, Tom Bukovac, and Noel Gallagher.\nSee also\n*List of distortion pedals\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.analogman.com/kingtone.htm Official site]"
