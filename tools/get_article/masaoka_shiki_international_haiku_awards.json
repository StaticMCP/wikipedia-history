The establishment of this award attracts people's attention to Masaoka Shiki as a globally recognized poet and to haiku as a short form of world poetry.\nPurpose\nThe Masaoka Shiki International Haiku Award is awarded to people who have made the most remarkable contribution to the development and the raising awareness of the creativity of haiku regardless of nationality or language.
