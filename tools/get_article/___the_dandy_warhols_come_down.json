It was released on July 15, 1997, by Capitol.\nThree singles were released from the album: \"Not If You Were the Last Junkie on Earth\", \"Every Day Should Be a Holiday\" and \"Boys Better\".\nThis is the final studio album to feature drummer Eric Hedford, who quit the band during the tour, and was replaced with Taylor-Taylor's cousin Brent DeBoer.\nRecording and The Black Album\nThe band's first effort for Capitol Records was an album which was recorded before Come Down called The Black Album, which was rejected by Capitol for, according to frontman Courtney Taylor-Taylor, containing \"no hit songs\". It was later released as a double album in 2004 with Come On Feel the Dandy Warhols, an album composed of B-sides and previously unreleased material.\nAfter rejecting \"The Black Album\" Capitol reached out to Tony Lash, who had co-produced Dandys Rule OK, to produce. ...The Dandy Warhols Come Down was recorded in 1996-1997 at Sound Impressions, Stiles Recording, Falcon Studios, and Courtney&nbsp;Taylor-Taylor's apartment in Portland, Oregon.\nAccording to Taylor-Taylor, it took the band a long time to get noticed by major labels, due to the prevalence of the grunge scene in the Pacific Northwest. In a June 1997 interview with Billboard, he remarked, \"When we came up, there were a group of bands that didn't get recognition because people weren't appreciating what it was we were doing. A lot of us were more influenced by Galaxie 500 than the post-pubescent, fanzine, Nirvana-angst, college thing that was so prevalent at the time.\"\nMusical style\nThe album featured a shift in style from the garage rock influenced sound of their previous album, 1995's Dandys Rule OK, to a more and pop-influenced sound.\nTaylor compared the track \"Good Morning\" to the style of musician Lloyd Cole.\nRelease\n...The Dandy Warhols Come Down was released on July 15, 1997, by Capitol.\nThree singles were released from the album: \"Not If You Were the Last Junkie on Earth\", which helped to establish the band's popularity; \"Every Day Should Be a Holiday\", which reached No. 29 on the UK Singles Chart; and \"Boys Better\", which reached No. 36 on the same chart.\nIt is the final album with founding member Eric Hedford, who was replaced by frontman Courtney Taylor-Taylor's cousin Brent DeBoer in 1998.\nReception\n| rev2 = Encyclopedia of Popular Music\n| rev2score =\n| rev3 = The Guardian\n| rev3score =\n| rev4 = Houston Chronicle\n| rev4score =\n| rev5 = NME\n| rev5score = 7/10\n| rev6 = Pitchfork\n| rev6score = 6.5/10\n| rev7 = Q\n| rev7score =\n| rev8 = Rolling Stone\n| rev8score =\n| rev9 = The Rolling Stone Album Guide\n| rev9score =\n| rev10 = USA Today\n| rev10score =\n}}\n...The Dandy Warhols Come Down has sold 103,000 copies in the U.S. as of 2008.\nThe album has received a generally positive reception from critics. AllMusic criticized the album's consistency, writing, \"the band has talent for not just punchy hooks but for layered sonics as well, but they don't know how to meld the two together.\" Rolling Stone, on the other hand, called it \"the most exhilarating '60s-into-'90s excursion yet attempted by an American band\", following with \"if this is The Dandy Warhols coming down, the mind boggles at the thought of them flying high.\"\nLegacy\nThe album was included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. Pitchfork also included it in their ''The Best Britpop Albums... That Aren't British list.\n\"Boys Better\" was featured on the soundtrack for the films Good Will Hunting, Igby Goes Down, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and Jay and Silent Bob Reboot. \"Every Day Should Be a Holiday\" was featured in the movie There's Something About Mary, Fanboys and the trailer for Sideways''\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nThe Dandy Warhols\n* Courtney Taylor-Taylor – lead vocals, guitar, mixing on \"Whipping Tree\", production and album sleeve design and art direction\n* Peter Holmström – guitar, additional vocals\n* Zia McCabe – keyboard bass, keyboards, percussion, additional vocals\n* Eric Hedford – drums, backing vocals\nAdditional personnel\n* Tony Lash – keyboards, percussion, drums on \"Minnesoter\"\n* Aquaman – additional production on \"Every Day Should Be a Holiday\"\n* Steven Birch – album design and art direction\n* Jeff Bizzell – sleeve photography (larger live photos)\n* Tchad Blake – mixing on tracks 1–7 and 10–12 at: Sunset Sound Factory, Hollywood, California\n* Mario Caldato Jr. – mixing and additional production on \"The Creep Out\" at Bundy's, Los Angeles, California\n* S.
