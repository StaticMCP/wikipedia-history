They raided Tripoli and some neighbouring towns. They ravaged the countryside, killing many Christians and seizing large amounts of loot and cattle. The Count of Tripoli, Pons, led an army to meet the Zengids, who were near Rafaniyya. Initially, the Zengids avoided battle and Pons chased them, but the Zengids turned back and fought the Crusaders, inflicting a heavy defeat on Pons's army. Few of the Crusaders survived the battle.\nPons and his few men retreated towards Montferrand. The Zengids chased them and quickly besieged the castle. Pons managed to slip from the castle with 20 men and head towards Tripoli, where he managed to send a letter to the Latin king, Fulk, to send a relief force. His call was quickly answered and Latins sent a force to meet the Zengids. Hearing this, the Zengids marched to meet the Crusader force, and in a heavy battle, both sides suffered severe casualties, and the Crusaders were almost defeated. The battle ended in stalemate when the Latins retreated towards Rafaniyya while the Zengids withdrew to their territory.\nReferences\nSources\n*Kevin James Lewis (2017), The Counts of Tripoli and Lebanon in the Twelfth Century, Sons of Saint-Gilles.[https://books.google.com/books?id=UzMlDwAAQBAJ&dq=Rafaniyya+Pons+1133&pg=PA112]\n*Donald Sidney Richards (2010), The Chronicle of Ibn al-Athir for the Crusading Period from al-Kamil fi'l-Ta'rikh.
