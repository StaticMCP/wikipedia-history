Its administrative center is the Kinmen-Matsu Joint Services Center in Jincheng, Kinmen, serving as its de facto capital. The province is also known as the Golden Horse (), after the literal reading of the Chinese character abbreviation for \"Kinmen-Matsu\".\nThe islands are the only part of a larger province that remain ROC-controlled. The People's Republic of China gained control of the mainland portion in 1949 during the Chinese Civil War. The islands were under military administration during the Cold War; travel restrictions were not lifted until 1992.\nProvincial administration was transferred to the national and county governments in 1998 following government reforms. The provincial government was practically abolished in 2018.\nHistory\nImperial China\nThe Han dynasty collapsed at the end of the 2nd century AD, paving the way for the Three Kingdoms era. Sun Quan, the founder of the Kingdom of Wu, spent nearly twenty years subduing the Shan Yue people, the branch of the Yue living in mountains.\n]]\nFuchien was also where the kingdom of Minyue was located. The word \"Mǐnyuè\" was derived by combining \"Mǐn\" (), which is perhaps an ethnic name (), and \"Yuè\", after the State of Yue, a Spring and Autumn period kingdom in Zhejiang to the north. This is because the royal family of Yuè fled to Fujian after its kingdom was annexed by the State of Chu in 306 BC. Mǐn is also the name of the main river in this area, but the ethnonym is probably older.\nThe first wave of immigration of the noble class arrived in the province in the early 4th century when the Western Jin dynasty collapsed and the north was torn apart by invasions by nomadic peoples from the north, as well as civil war.  These immigrants were primarily from eight families in central China: , and . The first four remain as the major surnames of the province.\nHistorically, population density in Fujian remained relatively low due to its relative isolation; only two commanderies and sixteen counties were established by the Western Jin dynasty. Like other southern provinces at that time, the province often served as a destination for exiled prisoners and dissidents at that time.\nThe Tang dynasty (618–907) oversaw the next golden age of China. As the Tang dynasty ended, China was torn apart in the period of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms. During this time, a second major wave of immigration arrived therein, led by General Wang, who set up an independent Kingdom of Min with its capital in Fuzhou. After the death of the founding king, however, the kingdom suffered from internal strife, and was soon swallowed up by Southern Tang, another southern kingdom.\nQuanzhou was blooming into a seaport under the reign of the Min Kingdom, and is the largest seaport in the world. Its population is also greater than Fuzhou. Due to the Ispah Rebellion, Quanzhou was severely damaged. In the early Ming dynasty, Quanzhou was the staging area and supply depot of Zheng He's naval expeditions. Further development was severely hampered by the sea trade ban of the Ming dynasty, and the area was superseded by nearby ports of Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Ningbo and Shanghai despite the lifting of the ban in 1550. Large scale piracy by Wokou (Japanese pirates) was eventually wiped out by Chinese military and Japanese authority of Toyotomi Hideyoshi.\nQing Dynasty\nLate Ming and early Qing dynasty heralded an era of large influx of refugees and another 20 years of sea trade ban under the Kangxi Emperor, a measure intended to counter the refuge Ming government of Koxinga in Taiwan. Incoming refugees, however, did not translate into a sizable workforce owing to their remigration to prosperous Cantonese regions. In 1683, the Qing dynasty conquered Taiwan and annexed it into Fujian province, as Taiwan Prefecture. Settlement of Taiwan by Han Chinese followed, and the majority of people in Taiwan are descendants of Hoklo people from Southern Fujian. Fujian arrived at its present extent after Taiwan was split as its own province in 1885. Shortly thereafter, Taiwan Province would be lost to Japan due to the Qing losing the First Sino-Japanese War which ended in 1895.\nRepublic of China\nMainland Period\nThe Xinhai Revolution deposed the Qing dynasty brought the province into the rule of the Republic of China. Fujian briefly gained independence from China again under the Fujian People's Government until it was recontrolled by the ROC during the Warlord Era.\nParts of the province in the northwestern area of Fujian were controlled by the Jiangxi–Fujian Soviet, a component territory controlled by the Chinese Soviet Republic until its collapse in 1934 at the start of the Long March.\nIt came under Japanese sea blockade during Second Sino-Japanese War.\nSince 1949\nDuring the late stages of the Chinese Civil War, the ROC lost control of mainland China, including most of Fujian province, and was forced to relocate to Taiwan, while the victorious Chinese Communist forces established the PRC in 1949, subsequently the provincial government of Fujian was also moved from Foochow to Jincheng. In the Battle of Guningtou, however, ROC forces were able to defend the island of Quemoy (Kinmen) just off the coast of Fujian from communist attack. As a result, the ROC has been able to hold on to a number of offshore islands of Fujian, and has continued to maintain a separate Fujian Provincial Government to govern these islands, parallel to the province of Fujian in mainland China.\nIn 1956, due to heightened potential for military conflict with the PRC, the ROC central government moved the Fujian provincial government out of Fujian to within Taiwan Province in Xindian (now part of New Taipei), and the islands were placed under an extraordinarily tight military administration due to their extreme proximity to mainland China. This was an unusual situation where the government of a province was located and operating in a different province. With the easing of cross-strait relations between the PRC and ROC and the democratization of the ROC in the 1990s, the islands were returned to civilian government in 1992. On 15 January 1996, the provincial government moved back to Kinmen, on Fujian soil.\nBeginning in 2010, the ROC significantly diluted the powers of the two provinces it governs, namely Taiwan and Fujian. Most of the authority at the Fujian province level has been delegated to the two county governments of Kinmen and Lienchiang.\nGovernment\nbuilding, now used by the Kinmen-Matsu Joint Services Center.]]\nThe Governor of Fujian Province was the head of the Fujian Provincial Government, the governor was also titled the \"Chairperson of the Fujian Provincial Government\". According to the Additional Articles of the Constitution, the governor was appointed by the central government.\nThe Fujian Provincial Government was located in Jincheng, Kinmen between January 1996 and 2018.\nProvincial administration was transferred to counties and the national-level National Development Council in 1998, with the transition occurring in 1999 and 2000. This followed 1997 constitutional reforms to downsize provincial governments. The provincial government was reduced to a local interface for the national government with appointed rather than elected officers; it became dormant when the remaining staff and responsibilities were transferred in 2018.\nThe Kinmen-Matsu Joint Services Center was founded in 2017 as the local government office handling administration of the islands. It took over the remaining responsibilities of the provincial government.\nSubdivisions\nFujian province nominally comprises two counties: Kinmen County and Lienchiang County. These islands have a total area of  and a total population of 71,000 (2001).\nThe following are the islands of Fujian under the administration of the ROC, given by county:\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Name\n|Kinmen County||Lienchiang County\n|-\n!Chinese\n|}}||}}\n|-\n!Taiwanese Hokkien\n|Kim-mn̂g-kuān||Liân-kang-kuān\n|-\n!Hakka\n|Kîm-mùn-yen||Lièn-kông-yen\n|-\n!Matsunese\n|Gĭng-muòng-gâing||Lièng-gŏng-gâing\n|-\n!Wuqiunese\n|Ging-meóng-gā̤ⁿ||Léng-gang-gā̤ⁿ\n|-\n!Flag\n|\n|\n|-\n!Map\n|\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=2| Islands\n|numerous islands & islets||36 islands\n|- align=left valign=top\n|\n* Kinmen Islands ()\n** Kinmen ()\n** Lesser Kinmen ()\n** Dadan ()\n** Erdan ()\n** Dongding ()\n** Beiding ()\n** Jiangong ()\n** Binlang Islet ()\n** Fuxing Islet ()\n** Menghu Islet ()\n** Shi Islet ()\n* Wuqiu Islands ()\n** Daqiu ()\n** Xiaoqiu ()\n|\n* Matsu Islands ()\n** Nangan ()\n** Beigan ()\n** Dongju ()\n** Xiju ()\n** Dongyin ()\n** Xiyin ()\n** Gaodeng Island ()\n** Daqiu Island ()\n** Liang Island ()\n** Turtle Island ()\n|-\n!Administrative divisions\n|6 townships|||4 townships\n|}\nThe PRC claims Kinmen as a county of Quanzhou, Fujian and the Matsu Islands as a township of Lianjiang County, Fuzhou, Fujian (with some islands claimed as parts of other areas).\nCulture and demography\nCulturally, its population is predominantly of Han Chinese ethnicity, though Fujian remains one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse provinces of the country. Dialects of the language group Min Chinese were most commonly spoken within the province, including the Fuzhou dialect of northeastern Fujian and various Hokkien dialects of southeastern Fujian. Hakka Chinese is also spoken, by the Hakka people in Fujian. Min dialects, Hakka and Mandarin Chinese are mutually unintelligible. Due to emigration, a sizable amount of the ethnic Chinese populations in Southeast Asia speak Southern Min (or Hokkien).\nEducation\n* National Quemoy University\nSee also\n* Taiwan Province\n* Fujian\n* Politics of the Republic of China\n* Kinmen-Matsu Joint Services Center\n* Battle of Kuningtou\n* First Taiwan Strait Crisis\n* Second Taiwan Strait Crisis\n* Third Taiwan Strait Crisis\n* Chekiang Province, Republic of China\nNotes\nWords in native languages\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060614222107/http://www.fkpg.gov.tw/ ROC Fujian Provincial Government]\n*"
