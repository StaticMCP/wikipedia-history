It spans the boundaries of the city of Misawa, the town of Tōhoku, and the village of Rokkasho in Kamikita District.\nData\nThe lake has an area of  and holds  of water. Its circumference is . At its deepest point, the water is  deep, with an average depth of . The surface is at sea level. The lake is shallow (less than  deep) from the shoreline to a distance of approximately , whereupon the depth drops off precipitously. The edge of Lake Ogawara is very near the coast of the Pacific Ocean, and the sand bar guarding its mouth has been breached numerous times by storms and typhoons, thus accounting for the brackish water of the lake. There are four inflowing rivers, all coming from the Hakkōda Mountains. The only outflow is the Takase River, which drains the lake to the Pacific Ocean.\nHistory\nLake Ogawara was originally a marine bay, which became a lake approximately 3,000 years ago by the formation of a sand bar at its mouth. The shoreline around Lake Ogawara has been settled since prehistoric times, and numerous Jōmon period remains and shell middens have been discovered, most notably at the Futatsumori Site on the west bank of the lake.\nThe lake was used by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service units at Misawa Airfield to practice for the attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II due to its similarity in depth to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii.\nThe Japanese government initiated a project beginning in the 1970s to convert the lake from brackish to fresh water to serve as a source of drinking, industrial and irrigation water despite the adverse environmental impact.\nOn February 20, 2018, an F-16 of the US Air Force based at the nearby Misawa Air Base jettisoned two external fuel tanks into the lake after experiencing an engine fire. Tests conducted in March 2018 found no residual fuel in the lake following a cleanup effort by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. Fishermen were given 85,000,000 yen (about $800,000) in a joint payment from the US and Japanese governments for loses incurred while the lake was closed to fishing during the cleanup efforts.\nEnvironment\nLake Ogawara is an abundant habitat for fish and birds, and is recognized as such by the Japanese Ministry of the Environment. A variety of marimo occurs naturally in the lake.\nIn 1996 the sound of wild birds on the shores of Lake Ogawara was selected by the Ministry of the Environment as one of the 100 Soundscapes of Japan.\nIn 2002, the Ministry of the Environment classified Lake Ogawara to be one of the 500 Important Wetlands in Japan, particularly for its biodiversity of aquatic flora, insects, and freshwater shellfish.  The lake also serves as a habitat for migratory wildfowl.\nThe lake was previously home to the critically endangered Hucho perryi, which was last spotted in 1943. Migratory birds include the whooper swan and tundra swan, among others.\nEconomic activity\nThe lake is a commercial source of cultivated Japanese smelt, icefish, goby and shijimi.\nSources\nThis article incorporates material from the article 小川原湖 (Ogawarako) in the Japanese Wikipedia, retrieved on November 11, 2009.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110523143210/http://www.ilec.or.jp/database/asi/asi-40.html International Lake Environmental Committee]"
