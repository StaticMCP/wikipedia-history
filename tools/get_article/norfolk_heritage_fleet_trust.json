The Trust maintains and hires out a fleet of wooden sailing yachts from the 1930s.\nHunter's Yard is situated in its own dyke off Womack Water on the Norfolk Broads in which the two original boat sheds (the first being built in 1932 and the second in 1935) are mostly as they were built in the 1930s, from timber in the traditional Broads' style, with many of its original features intact and numerous pieces of equipment, tools and boat fittings on view to the public.\nHistory\nHunter's Yard was operational until 1968 when it was sold to the Norfolk County Council and was renamed Norfolk County Sailing Base. The Council maintained the traditions of the Yard, however its main aim was to encourage young people to sail and experience the Yachts and discounts were offered to schools. In 1995 the Council decided to sell the Yard and its fleet as part of an economy measure. Subsequently a fundraising effort was carried out to retain the yard which raised £100,000 from public sources and £200,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund. In 1996 the Norfolk Heritage Fleet Trust was established and took over the yard, continuing to encourage young people to use and sail on the yachts, as well as hiring them out for public use.\nCabin yachts\nThe trust maintain a number of yachts of various types:\nHustler class – sloop-rigged, with 2 berths\nThe trust have five Hustler-class yachts, all built between 1935 and 1938: numbers I, II, III, IV & V.\n*Rig: gaff sloop with self-tacking jib\n*Mast lowing: counter weights\n*Length: LOA 24&nbsp;ft\n*Beam: 7&nbsp;ft 6 in\n*Draught: 2&nbsp;ft 6in\n*Bridge clearance: Minimum 5&nbsp;ft 11in\n*Headroom: 5&nbsp;ft 9in with top raised (aft end)\nWood class – sloop-rigged, Carvel-built with 3 berths\nThe trust have five Wood Class yachts: Wood Anenome (1947), Wood Avens (1949), Wood Rose (1934), Wood Sorrel (1933) and Wood Violet (1934).\n*Rig: gaff sloop with self-tacking Jib\n*Mast lowing: counter weights\n*Length: LOA 24&nbsp;ft\n*Beam: 7&nbsp;ft 6 in\n*Draught: 2&nbsp;ft 6in\n*Bridge clearance: minimum 5&nbsp;ft 11in\n*Headroom: 5&nbsp;ft 9in with top raised (aft end)\nLullaby class – sloop-rigged, Carvel-built of mahogany with 4 berths\nThe trust have four Lullaby-class yachts: Lullaby (1932), Lustre (1932), Luna (1933) and Lucent (2007):\n*Rig: gaff sloop with self-tacking Jib\n*Mast lowing: counter weights\n*Length: LOA 28&nbsp;ft\n*Beam: 8&nbsp;ft 6 in\n*Draught: 2&nbsp;ft 6in\n*Bridge clearance: Minimum 6&nbsp;ft\n*Headroom: 5&nbsp;ft 9in with top raised (aft end)\nHalf deckers\nThe trust also owns a number of half-decker day boats:\n*Buff tip – also known as a White Boat\n:Gunter rig\n:Main sail and jib, LOA, 20 foot\n*Sundew – a Waveney One Design.\n:Gunter rig\n:Main sail and jib, LOA 20 ft\n*Rebel Reveller – high-performance sailing yacht\n:Gunter rig\n:Main sail and jib, LOA 20&nbsp;ft 9 inches\n*Brown Bess – suitable for sailing alone\n:Single, balanced lug sail, LOA 20&nbsp;ft\n*Woodcuts – there are two of these yachts, I & II\n:Single, semi-salanced lug sail, LOA 18&nbsp;ft\nSee also\n*List of waterway societies in the United Kingdom\n*Norfolk Wherry Trust\n*Wherry Yacht Charter Charitable Trust\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.huntersyard.co.uk/ Official website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080727040125/http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/consultations/shipsforthenation.pdf Department for Culture, Media and Sport: Ships for the Nation, Consultation on Government Policy for the Preservation of Historic Ships; mention of Norfolk Heritage Fleet Trust]\n*[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/761066/Sailing-special-Norfolk-by-boat.html Telegraph online, March 5, 2008 article: Norfolk by Boat / Flora Duncan discovers Norfolk via its network of ancient waterways]\n*[http://www.edp24.co.uk/TourismAwards/2008/asp/Winners2.asp Eastern Daily Press Tourism Awards: Norfolk Heritage Fleet Trust wins the Best Water Based Tourism Experience Award 2008]"
