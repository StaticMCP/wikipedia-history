This period was characterised by figures like Martin Cahill and the emergence of groups like the Kinahan Organised Crime Group. In 1996, the murder of investigative journalist Veronica Guerin, who exposed the Irish criminal underworld, highlighted the scale of the problem and the dangers faced by those who investigated it. As the Irish economy grew during the \"Celtic Tiger\" period, so did opportunities for organised crime, such as drug trafficking, cocaine, cannabis, and ecstasy, with groups like the Crumlin-Drimnagh gang, supplying from sources in Spain and elsewhere. Irish organised crime was often associated with violence, including shootings, bombings, and feuds between criminal groups were common.\nThis list is a timeline of activities attributed to organised crime in the Republic of Ireland from the 1990s to the present day.
