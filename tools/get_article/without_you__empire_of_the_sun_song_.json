The single was digitally released on the Australian iTunes Store on 25 September 2009. The CD single was released on 28 September 2009. The song was remixed for single release, making it more uptempo and upbeat.\nLyrics and writing\n\"Without You\" is a notable song on Walking on a Dream as it is the only down-tempo composition on the entire album, contrasting with the previous single releases from the band. The song is a slow, melancholy ballad sung by Steele with such lyrics as; \"No future there is no past, No slow there is no fast.\"\nMusic video\nLuke Steele posing in the neon dome in the music video for \"Without You\".\nThe music video was shot in Fox Studios in Sydney by Josh Logue.\nThe music video, which does not feature Littlemore, consists of Steele in black and white birdlike garb and ice-blue contact lens, who is surrounded by a geodesic dome made of white neon lights. To complete the ice blue theme, other props include a chair and table of food all within the video's aesthetic. The video was shown on the Australian MTV website, YouTube, NovaNation.com and in a link on Twitter.\nNovaNation claims \"The Empire of the Sun boys have dropped another video that speaks volumes about their ability to see beyond the music.\" The video has also been aired on Ten's Video Hits, GO!'s Eclipse Music TV and ABCs Rage.\nTrack listing\niTunes EP\n# \"Without You\" (new version) – 3:31\n# \"Walking on a Dream\" (Treasure Fingers Remix) – 5:25\n# \"Standing on the Shore\" (Losers Remix) – 6:39\n# \"Without You\" (album version) – 4:58\nUK 7-inch vinyl single\n* Purple-colored see-through vinyl\n# \"Without You\" (new version) – 3:31\n# \"Girl\" – 3:12\nPromo CD single\n# \"Without You\" (new version) – 3:31\n# \"Without You\" (new version) (instrumental) – 3:33\nRelease history\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
