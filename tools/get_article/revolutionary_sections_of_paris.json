They first arose in 1790 and were suppressed in 1795.\nHistory\nAt the time of the Revolution, Paris measured 3440 hectares, compared to the 7800 hectares of today. It was bounded to the west by the place de l'Étoile, to the east by the cimetière du Père-Lachaise, to the north by place de Clichy, and to the south by the cimetière du Montparnasse. Under the Ancien Régime, the city had been divided into 21 'quartiers'.\nIn 1789, with a view to elections to the Estates-General, it was instead divided provisionally into 60 districts. By a decree of 21 May 1790, sanctioned by King Louis XVI on 27 June, the National Constituent Assembly created 48 'sections' ('section' then meaning a territorial and administrative division) to replace the 60 districts. Each section was made up of a civil committee, a revolutionary committee and an armed force.\nAfter the Thermidorian Reaction on 27 July 1794, the sections still played an important role in suppressing the popular uprisings. In 1795, however, they were suppressed by the French Directory, which renamed the areas covered by sections as divisions, then quartiers.\nComposition\nCivil committee\nEach section was headed by a civil committee of 16 members (elected by active citizens in the area covered by the section), the juges de paix (judges) and members intended to act as intermediaries between their section and the Paris Commune. From 1792 onwards, the sections occupied themselves permanently with political questions. On 25 July 1792, the Parisians decided to abolish the distinction between active citizens and passive citizens. As a result, the sections' assemblies sat permanently and became the political organ of the sans-culottes. After the Brunswick Manifesto they demanded the deposition of the king, by 47 sections to 48.\nOn 9 August 1792 each section delegated commissioners elected by the active and passive citizens, as a replacement for the 'municipalité' of Paris. There were 52 of these commissioners in total (including Jacques-René Hébert, Pierre-Gaspard Chaumette and François-Xavier Audouin) and they triggered the events of 10 August 1792, putting an end to the monarchy and giving rise to the 'Revolutionary Commune' of Paris.\nRevolutionary committee\nSet up by a law of 21 March 1793, the initial task of the sections' revolutionary committees was surveillance on foreigners without interfering in the lives of French citizens. Their activities towards that end (often going beyond the limits the law of 21 March had placed on them) were enabled by the Law of Suspects of 17 September 1793. They also had the power to make lists and issue arrest warrants. They also had the right to deliver citizenship certificates, all in establishing a direct correspondence with the Committee of General Security.\nArmed force\nParis's armed force was headed by a commander in chief and divided into 6 legions, each legion made up of troops from eight sections. The troops of each section had their own commander in chief, second in command and adjutant-major. The companies were made up of 120 to 130 men, being bigger or smaller according to their section's population. A company was commanded by a captain, a lieutenant and two 'sous-lieutenants'. Each section also had a company of artillery (60 men and 2 cannon each). In the Thermidorian Reaction of 27 July 1794, during the fall of Maximilien Robespierre, 18 companies had been sent to the front by order of Lazare Carnot. Of the 30 remaining companies, three were used to keep order – at the National Convention, the Arsenal, and the Temple. Seventeen remaining companies replied to the Commune's appeal during the night of 27–28 July 1794.\nList of Sections\nThe following is a list of the 48 revolutionary sections:\n# Tuileries\n# Champs-Élysées\n# Roule (eventually known as la République)\n# Palais Royal (eventually known as Palais Egalité, la Butte des Moulins, la Butte St. Roch, and la Montagne)\n# Place Vendôme (eventually known as Piques)\n# La Bibliothèque (eventually known as Filles St. Thomas, 1792, and Le Pelletier)\n# La Grange Batelière (eventually known as Mirabeau and Mont Blanc)\n# Louvre (eventually known as Muséum)\n# l'Oratoire (eventually known as Gardes Françaises)\n# La Halle au Blé\n# Postes (eventually known as Contrat Social)\n# La Place de Louis XIV (eventually known as Petits Pères du Mail and Guillaume Tell)\n# Fontaine Montmorency (eventually known as la Fontaine Montmarte, Molière et La Fontaine, and Brutus)\n# Bonne Nouvelle\n# Ponceau (eventually known as Amis de la Patrie)\n# Mauconseil (eventually known as Bon Conseil)\n# Marché des Innocents (eventually known as Halles and Marchés)\n# Lombards\n# Arcis\n# Faubourg Montmartre (eventually known as Faubourg Mont-Marat)\n# Poissonière\n# Bondy\n# Temple\n# Popincourt\n# Montreuil\n# Quinze-Vingts\n# Gravilliers\n# Faubourg St. Denis (eventually known as Faubourg du Nord)\n# Rue Beaubourg (eventually known as la Réunion)\n# Enfants Rouges (eventually known as Marais and l'Homme Armé)\n# Roi de Sicile (eventually known as Droits de l'Homme)\n# l'Hôtel de Ville (eventually known as Maison Commune and Fidélité)\n# Place Royal (eventually known as Place des Fédérés and l'Indivisibilité)\n# l'Arsenal\n# l'Ile St. Louis (eventually known as la Fraternité)\n# Notre-Dame (eventually known as Raison and la Cité)\n# Henri IV (eventually known as Pont Neuf and Révolutionnaire)\n# Invalides\n# La Fontaine de Grenelle\n# Quatre Nations (eventually known as l'Unité)\n# Théâtre Français (eventually known as Marseille and Marat)\n# La Croix Rouge (eventually known as Section de l'Ouest and Bonnet-Rouge)\n# Luxembourg (eventually known as Mutius Scevola)\n# Thermes de Julien (eventually known as Beaurepaire, Régénérée, and Chalier)\n# Ste.
