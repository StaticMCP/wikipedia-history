Created in 2007, the ward elects four councillors using the single transferable vote electoral system and covers an area with a population of 17,055 people.\nThe area has been politically split between Labour and the Scottish National Party (SNP) with both parties holding half the seats at various points since the ward's creation.\nBoundaries\nThe ward was created following the Fourth Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements ahead of the 2007 Scottish local elections. As a result of the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, local elections in Scotland would use the single transferable vote electoral system from 2007 onwards so Ayr North was formed from an amalgamation of several previous first-past-the-post wards.\nIt contained all of the former Ayr Lochside, Ayr Newton and Ayr Whitletts wards, the southern half of the former Prestwick Toll ward, the majority of the former Ayr Cragie ward and the northwestern part of the former Ayr Central ward. The ward centres on the northern portion of the town of Ayr which is situated on the Firth of Clyde coast in the northwest of the council area. It contains everything in the town north of the River Ayr apart from an area around John Street, south of King Street and east of Craigie Road. The ward's boundaries were unchanged following the Fifth Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements ahead of the 2017 Scottish local elections.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Year\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=5|Douglas Campbell(Labour/Independent/SNP)\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Tom Slider(SNP)\n|rowspan=7; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=4|John Hampton(Conservative)\n|rowspan=7; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=7|Ian Cavana(Labour)\n|-\n!2008\n|style=\"background-color: \" |\n|-\n!2011\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|-\n!2012\n|style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Rita Miller(Labour)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Laura Brennan-Whitefield(SNP)\n|rowspan=3|Ian Davis(Conservative)\n|-\n!2022\n|Mark Dixon(SNP)\n|-\n!2025\n|style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Wullie Hogg(Independent)\n|}\nElection results\n2025 by-election\n2022 election\n2017 election\n2012 election\n2007 election\nReferences"
