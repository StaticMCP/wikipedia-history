In 2002 around eighty National Training Organisations (NTOs) became around twenty SSCs. The Council for Hospitality Management Education conversely has an international outlook.\nThe National Skills Academy for Food & Drink (NSAFD) is at York. The Institute of Hospitality was known as HCIMA - Hotel and Catering International Management Association, which became the IoH in April 2007. The Hotel and Catering Institute was founded in 1949; the professional body merged with the Institutional Management Association in 1971. Hotel, Restaurant & Catering (HRC) is a main national event.\nGreene King and Mitchells & Butlers are two of the biggest apprenticeship providers in the UK, with around 1,500 each; only the armed forces, BT and HMRC have more numbers of apprenticeships. There are single awards GCSE Catering and GCSE Hospitality, or the double award GCSE Hospitality and Catering.\nVictor Ceserani MBE pioneered catering education in the UK, when he was head of catering at Ealing College, now part of University of West London; this had been Acton Hotel and Catering School until 1957 and trained many airline catering staff; he wrote The Theory of Catering and Practical Cookery, with Ronald Kinton and David Foskett (academic).\nColleges\nLeicester College claim to be the East Midlands leading training school for catering and food manufacturing.

In the 1980s, ARA (Automatic Retailers of America), an American company, had won many defence catering subcontracts; it became Aramark in 1994.\nCatering equipment\nMoorwood Vulcan were a main British manufacturer of catering equipment, such as industrial gas cookers. It ceased manufacturing in 2016, being bought in October 2008 by The Manitowoc Company of Milwaukee in Wisconsin, previously owned by Enodis.

It applied to pubs that served table meals.\nThe Licensing Act 1988, given Royal assent on 19 May 1988, allowed pubs to open from 3pm to 5.30pm.\nAs Minister of State for Home Affairs, Michael Forsyth, Baron Forsyth of Drumlean introduced legislation that allowed children under-14 (which was prohibited by the former Licensing Act 1964) into pubs, and were allowed to be served food until 9pm, with half-an-hour to eat the food, and promptly leave the premises by 9.30pm. The licensing law took effect from 3 January 1995, although it was February 1995 before pubs largely changed their policies. Pubs were allowed to open on Sundays from 3pm to 7pm. The Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 gained Royal assent on Thursday 3 November 1994. The act also allowed shops to open after 8pm, and for off-licences to sell alcohol on Sundays from 1 December 1994.\nUnder the Licensing Act 1902, pubs can set their own policies, and from 2012, due to unruly children, Wetherspoons would serve no more than two alcoholic drinks to adults who accompanied children in their pubs.\nThe controversial Licensing Act 2003 allowed pubs to open when they liked. The 2003 act also allowed children under-16 to work in pubs. Children's working hours are governed by the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Section 150 of the 2003 act allowed 16 and 17 year olds to consume beer, cider or wine, but only with a meal in a pub. Spirits cannot be consumed by anyone under 18 in licensed premises. Pubs are not obliged to sell beer for 16 year olds eating a meal, and can refuse.\nFemale-friendly establishments\nAmanda Willmott had founded two pubs in Birmingham - Carpe Diem and Quo Vadis; this design formed the template for her new design of female-friendly pubs for Bass Inns, known as All Bar One, in February 1994, which first opened in December 1994 in Sutton, London; she went on to form a similar chain Ha! Ha! Bar and Canteen, in 1998.\nEating out\nRaymond Postgate launched the The Good Food Guide in 1951; his son later produced 'Ivor the Engine' and 'The Clangers'.\nBeefeater Steak Houses were one of the first chains of restaurants, first opening in July 1974 in Enfield, London; in 1974 its most popular meal was prawn cocktail, rump steak, followed by Black Forest gateau and two glasses of Liebfraumilch German wine; by 1995 it was Britain's largest restaurant chain, with 270 outlets, serving 15 million people per year.\nThe former cafe at Hartside Pass at Leadgate, Cumbria claimed to be the highest cafe in England, at 575m.\n922 restaurants closed in 2019, and 1188 closed in 2018.\nFood safety\nThe 1990 Food Safety Act was the biggest change since 1938. It was introduced due to rising cases in listeria in cooked chilled chicken products. It replaced the Food Act 1984. Prisons, civil service buildings and military bases would now have their kitchens inspected by local environmental health officers, which had not regularly happened before. There had been recent salmonella outbreaks in NHS hospitals. All food outlets would now have to be registered with local authorities. Environmental health officers could instantly close down restaurants, without needing to obtain a court order. Restaurant owners could be fined £20,000 and jailed for six months by local magistrates.\nThe Food Safety (General Food Hygiene) Regulations 1995 were introduced on 15 September 1995, which implemented the European Food Hygiene Directive 93/43/EEC.\nThe Food Information Regulations 2014 brought in the necessity for businesses to display the 14 allergens. This originated from the European FIC Regulation of December 2014, the Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011.\nList of food poisoning cases\n* August 1922, Loch Maree Hotel botulism poisoning, where six guests and two staff died in the first case of botulism in the UK, originating from the hotel's potted duck paste, investigated by the microbiologist Philip Bruce White\n* Between 12-17 March 1984, British Airways had a salmonella outbreak on long-haul flights to North America, the Middle East, and East Africa, affecting 631 passengers and 135 staff on 14 flights, including the businessman Peter de Savary, giving him a week in hospital, and on Concorde flights. No flight deck staff were affected, as the pilot, co-pilot and flight engineer, by common practice, never had the same food as passengers. After the earlier Japan Air Lines food poisoning incident, in February 1975, the 52 year old catering manager of Inflight Catering Company, at Anchorage, had committed suicide. Most onboard the 1975 flight were Japanese Coca-Cola salesmen and their wives, who were being rewarded by their company with a visit to France. At the stopover at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, ham and cheese omelettes had been brought onboard for breakfast, which made 196 passengers ill, on the flight from Tokyo to France. This 1975 incident is the reason why airline pilots and co-pilots do not eat the same food as the passengers. Prof Stanley Mohlers and Kenneth N. Beers of Wright State University Medical School in Dayton, Ohio believed that food poisoning was an untrivial risk for airline crew\n* 19 January 1991, at a McDonald's restaurant on Friar Gate in Preston in Lancashire, 14 people contracted E. coli O157. This strain produced verocytotoxin, so on 15 February 1991, McDonald's announced that it would cook its burgers for longer, across the whole of the UK\n* November 1996 Wishaw, North Lanarkshire, Escherichia coli O157:H7 outbreak, killed 21 people\n* 2005 South Wales E. coli O157 outbreak\n* December 2012, a Christmas meal at the Railway Hotel in Hornchurch made 33 people ill with Clostridium perfringens, and mother-of-one Della Callagher died two days later. She had visited the Queen's Hospital in Romford, on Boxing Day, being given an anti-sickness injection by paramedics in an ambulance, and told to go home. No blood tests had been taken. She went into cardiac arrest the following morning, with CPR given, but the London Ambulance Service took 45 minutes to arrive. The turkey meat, prepared the day before, was not cooled enough, after being cooked, and was not adequately reheated. Food safety records had not been adequately kept, so the 37-year-old pub chef and 41-year-old manager concocted records, and were jailed at Snaresbrook Court for 12 months and 18 months, in January 2015. Mitchells & Butlers were fined £1.5m in November 2014; it was an Ember Inns establishment.\nIncidents\n* On Boxing Day 1969, an 18-bedroomed historic timbered coaching inn in Saffron Walden, in Essex, burned down, killing eleven people. The manager was 55-year-old Emil Landsman, a former wartime fighter pilot with 306 Polish Fighter Squadron, had been there for 21 months, under Trust Houses Forte. The fire led directly to the Fire Precautions Act 1971. Previous fire legislation came under the Public Health Act 1936, which quoted that local councils were to regulate the adequate provision of fire escapes in hospitality venues\nCompanies\nStonegate Pub Company\nThe Stonegate Pub Company (based close to the M1 in Luton) is the largest pub group in the UK, after it bought Ei Group in March 2020 for £3 billion.\nWhitbread\nBefore it sold Costa Coffee in January 2019, Whitbread, in Houghton Regis in Bedfordshire, was the UK's largest hotel and restaurant group, owning Premier Inn, Brewers Fayre and Beefeater.\nPremier Inn\nPremier Inn was developed and expanded in the 2000s largely during the leadership of Alan C. Parker, the chief executive of Whitbread.\nCompass Group\nCompass Group, in Chertsey in Surrey, is the largest contract foodservice company in the world. Sodexo UK employs around 43,000 people, and Compass Group UK has 45,000.\nMcDonald's\n, being officially opened by Mrs Thatcher on 6 May 1983, when she was the local MP, and she also opened the £20m extension on 21 April 1989]] McDonald's arrived in the UK on Powis Street in Woolwich on 1 October 1974, the 3,000th restaurant in the company's history; in December 1971 a McDonald's had opened in Obergiesing in southern Germany. Fred L. Turner attended the opening. Seven other restaurants followed in London, from January 1975 with Golders Green, Baker Street and Finchley Road. A cheeseburger was 21p, and a Big Mac 45p; the Big Mac had been introduced in 1968. The restaurant was not, apparently, well-visited, so the company chose to heavily-advertise its products at less-discerning children.\nIn 1990 meat products were made in Milton Keynes, built in 1980, and Scunthorpe, built in 1989, with fruit pies made in the north of Huntingdon and doughnuts in Orton Southgate, owned by OSI Group, and salads made on the former RAF Methwold in south-west Norfolk (closed in 2006), and chicken products made by Avara Foods (run with Faccenda Foods) in Hereford.\nMcDonald's opened in France in 1972, being their most profitable operation outside of the US, where customers spend more per head than anywhere else, in large groups, often eating dessert, and 70% eat in, than take out, with over 1,400 branches.\nBurger King\nBurger King arrived on 11 October 1977 on Coventry Street in London. The second opened on 4 September 1979 on Victoria Street. The first Burger King outside of London opened in December 1980 at the Arndale Centre in Luton, now called Luton Point. The third in the UK opened on 2 February 1981 on Queensway, London. The British restaurants were directly owned by Pillsbury. By May 1983, it had nine British restaurants; McDonald's had 130, and KFC had 350.\nKFC\nThe first KFC in the UK opened in Preston in August 1965. Another opened soon after at 78 County Road, in Walton, Liverpool. Many of these new outlets were largely franchises, which operated in ways of restrictive trade that could contravene the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1956, and be investigated by the Office of Fair Trading.\nDavid Acheson was head of KFC in the late 1970s. In 1971 KFC had been bought by Heublein, who owned Smirnoff vodka. By the end of 1972, there were 162 in the UK, with 90 in London.\nPizza Hut\nPizza Hut came to the UK in Islington in 1973, being owned jointly by PepsiCo and Whitbread. By October 1983 it had 28 restaurants.\nWorkforce\nIn 2015 the UK hospitality industry employed around 2.9m people – around 9% of the UK workforce. By employment, it is the UK's fourth-largest industry. The most jobs in the industry are found in London (around 500,000) and South East England (around 400,000); 18% of workers in the UK industry are in London. There are around 1.5m restaurant workers, and around 0.5m work in hotels.\nThe Food Safety Act 1990 introduced the training that staff have to follow.\nContingent of EU employees\nAround 25% of the hospitality workforce comes from the EU, making up around 25% of chefs and around 75% of waiting staff.\nIn 2019, 1 in 50 applicants to Pret a Manger was British.\nSee also\n* List of hotels in the United Kingdom\n* List of motorway service areas in the United Kingdom\n* List of pubs in the United Kingdom\n* List of restaurants in London\n* List of restaurants in Scotland\n* List of restaurants in Wales\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b053pzmd BBC Timeshift documentary in March 2015]"
