This was TCU's first conference championship in 35 years. This was also TCU's first bowl appearance in 10 years. Virginia was third in the Atlantic Coast Conference and in a bowl game for the second time in the calendar year of 1994. After a loss to #4 Florida State in their first game, they won six straight games, jumping up to #13 before losing to Duke. They went 2–1 after that, with a loss to NC State making them fall from #13 to #18.\nGame summary\nIn a rain drenched mess laid the Frogs, who failed to win a bowl game once again, the fourth since 1959. The Frogs had a 411.6 yards per game offense, but on this day were limited to 191, as Virginia limited the junior tailback André Davis to 97 yards on 24 carries and made quarterback Max Knake (8 for 24 with 65 yards and 1 touchdown and 1 interception) ineffective. The Cavaliers utilized the rushing attack of Charles Way and Kevin Brooks, who ran for 114 and 90 yards, respectively. Mike Groh went 14 for 23 with 2 interception and 1 touchdown. When asked what he would have done differently after the game, Knake responded \"I'd probably stay out of the casinos before having to get up at 8:30 the next morning. . . . The truth of it is, I played terrible.\"\nAftermath\nWhile TCU wouldn't make another bowl game under Sullivan, they would return to a bowl game four years later. Virginia would reach bowl games in five of Welsh's six final years, including a conference title in 1995.\nStatistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Statistics !! TCU  !!
