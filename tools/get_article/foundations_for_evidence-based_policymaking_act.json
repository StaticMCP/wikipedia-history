The Evidence Act contains three parts (\"titles\"), which address evidence capacity, open data (OPEN Government Data Act), and data confidentiality (the reauthorization of the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act).\nLegislative history\nThe bill was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by former House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin on October 31, 2017. Senator Patty Murray filed counterpart legislation in the U.S. Senate. Rep. Ryan and Sen. Murray acknowledged that the basis of the legislation was a set of recommendations issued by the U.S. Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking. The Evidence Act addresses half of the recommendations from that commission.\nIn November 2017, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform advanced the bill, which was approved unanimously by the full House. The Senate advanced a modified version of the bill in December 2018, which returned to the House for a final vote. The U.S. president signed the bill into law on January 14, 2019.\nImplementation\nFederal agencies have undertaken extensive activities to support implementation of the Evidence Act, beginning in 2019. Many activities are documented in a report from the Data Foundation describing the status of the Evidence Commission's recommendations after 5-years. The federal government also published new resources that describe implementation progress that reflect respective titles of the law. For example:\n* Title 1 relates to evidence-building functions and evaluation with additional information available at [http://www.Evaluation.gov evaluation.gov]\n* Title 2 relates to data management and chief data officers with additional information available at [http://Www.cdo.gov cdo.gov] and through the Federal Data Strategy\n* Title 3 relates to statistical policy with additional information available at [http://www.statspolicy.gov statspolicy.gov]\nSee also\n* Open data in the United States\n* U.S. Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking, est.
