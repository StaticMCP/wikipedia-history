He has hosted his own television shows, ''Russell Howard's Good News and The Russell Howard Hour, and appeared on the topical panel TV show Mock the Week''.  He won \"Best Compère\" at the 2006 Chortle Awards and was nominated for an Edinburgh Comedy Award for his 2006 Edinburgh Festival Fringe show. Howard has cited comedians Lee Evans, Richard Pryor, and Frank Skinner as influences.\nEarly life\nHoward was born in Bath, Somerset, and raised in nearby Radstock, Somerset. His parents are Dave and Ninette Howard. He has two younger siblings, twins Kerry and Daniel (born 1982). Daniel has epilepsy, to which Howard sometimes refers during his act.\nHoward attended Hanham High School, Perins School in New Alresford and Alton College. He later studied economics at the University of the West of England.\nCareer\nTV and radio work\nIn 2004, he was commissioned by BBC Radio 1 to write, sing and perform on the comedy series The Milk Run. Howard has also appeared on the shows Banter (hosted by Andrew Collins) and Political Animal for BBC Radio 4.\nUntil 2010, Howard was a regular panelist on Mock the Week. He has also appeared on 8 Out of 10 Cats, Would I Lie to You?, Live at the Apollo, ''The Secret Policeman's Ball 2008, Law of the Playground and Never Mind the Buzzcocks'' (Series 18, Episode 2 and Series 20, Episode 4).\nHoward frequently worked with other members of the Chocolate Milk Gang, a group of comedians who often collaborated and performed with one another, including Daniel Kitson, John Oliver, David O'Doherty, and Alun Cochrane. Howard shares Oliver's adoration of Liverpool F.C.\nHe was one of several comedians picked as the best comedy talent from the 2005 Edinburgh Festival Fringe that recorded 10–15-minute spots for the \"Edinburgh and Beyond\" show which was aired on Paramount Comedy 1 in the autumn of 2006. The show was filmed at the Bloomsbury Theatre. From 2009, he took over as compère of this show from Al Murray.\n]]\nFrom November 2006 to July 2008, Russell co-hosted The Russell Howard Show on BBC Radio 6 Music with fellow comedian Jon Richardson in a Sunday morning slot previously hosted by Russell Brand. The show continued to air, without Howard, until March 2010. He has since explained that his main reason for leaving the show was that he finds radio \"really restrictive\" and \"I gorge off the audience as a performer, but you can't gauge a reaction on the radio.\"\nRussell was commissioned to make a comedy show called ''Russell Howard's Good News'', aimed at under-25s, for BBC Three. The first episode aired on 22 October 2009 and the show ran for ten series as well as a \"best of\" show and a Christmas Special. It went on to become BBC Three's highest ever rating entertainment series. In the show, he gave his take on the week's major news stories, as well as giving attention to some of the more light-hearted stories of the week. Two more series of the show were commissioned, with the second series starting on 25 March 2010. A seventh series began on 27 September 2012 on BBC Three. Series 8 began on 25 April 2013 on BBC Three, and series 9 started broadcast in its new home on BBC Two in October 2014.\n''Russell Howard's Good News'' was voted the Best Ever BBC Three show on 9 February 2013 as part of the channel's 10th birthday celebrations.\nHoward made his United States television debut on the 3 August 2011 episode of Conan.

In 2015 he appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon where he performed some stand-up.\nIn December 2015, Howard made his acting debut in BBC Two's hour-long comedy-drama A Gert Lush Christmas, which he also co-wrote.

On 10 March 2016, Howard appeared on the BBC 1 panel show Room 101.\nIn March 2016 Howard attacked Conservative MP Philip Davies on his BBC show calling him an \"arsehole\", \"windbag\", \"wanker\" and a \"toad-faced hypocrite\", accusing the MP of filibustering (talking out a bill). Davies complained on the grounds of \"inaccuracy\" and \"misrepresentation\" and the BBC was forced to publish in the Clarifications and Corrections section of the BBC website stating \"Davies did not personally use up all the time available for the debate and that almost three hours remained after he sat down\". Howard was also found to have misrepresented Davies' views on disabled people and the BBC noted \"that the programme did not fully represent his comments, which were, that it would be in the best interests of disabled people, and others, to be allowed to offer to work for less than the minimum wage, if the alternative were no employment at all\". The broadcaster also agreed not to air the episode again due to their misrepresentation of Davies' position. The BBC Trust later rejected a further escalation of the complaint by Davies.\nStarting in October 2016, Howard presented a travel documentary series for Comedy Central called Russell Howard & Mum: USA Road Trip which involved him and his mother Ninette travelling through America.\nOn 29 November 2016, it was announced that Howard would write and star in a 14-part weekly comedy series entitled The Russell Howard Hour on Sky One in 2017, as part of a two-year deal with Sky. The series began on 21 September 2017.\nLive comedy\n, London]]\nA show from his 2007 Adventures tour was released on DVD on 17 November 2008, under the title \"Russell Howard Live\".
