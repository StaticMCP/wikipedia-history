It was first established under the government of Yitzhak Shamir on 27 November 1990, with Avraham Verdiger serving as deputy minister, although Avner Shaki had served as a Minister without Portfolio responsible for Jerusalem Affairs since 1988. However, the post was abolished by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin (who was also the portfolio holder) on 31 December 1992.\nIt was brought back in 2001 in Ariel Sharon's government. In 2005 the role reverted to being the responsibility of a Minister without Portfolio. Between 2013 and 2015 it was combined with the Diaspora Affairs portfolio as the Minister of Jerusalem and Diaspora Affairs.\nList of ministers\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n!#\n!Minister\n!Party\n!Governments\n!Term start\n!Term end\n!Notes\n|-\n!colspan=7|Minister of Jerusalem Affairs\n|-\n|1||align=left|Avner Shaki||align=left|||23||||11 June 1990||\n|-\n|2||align=left|Yitzhak Shamir||align=left|Likud||24||27 November 1990||13 July 1992||Serving Prime Minister\n|-\n|3||align=left|Yitzhak Rabin||align=left|Labor Party||25||13 July 1992||||Serving Prime Minister\n|-\n|4||align=left|Eli Suissa||align=left|Shas||29||7 March 2001||23 May 2002||\n|-\n|–||align=left|Eli Suissa||align=left|Shas||29||3 June 2002||28 February 2003||\n|-\n|5||align=left|Natan Sharansky||align=left|Not an MK||30||3 March 2003||4 May 2005||Had been elected to the Knesset on the Yisrael BaAliyah\n|-\n|6||align=left|Haim Ramon||align=left|Labor Party||30||10 January 2005||23 November 2005||\n|-\n|7||align=left|Ya'akov Edri||align=left|Kadima||31||4 May 2006||4 July 2007||\n|-\n!colspan=7|Minister of Jerusalem and Diaspora Affairs\n|-\n|8||align=left|||align=left|Likud||33||18 March 2013||29 April 2013||Serving Prime Minister\n|-\n|9||align=left|Naftali Bennett||align=left|The Jewish Home||33, 34||29 April 2013||19 May 2015||\n|-\n!colspan=7|Minister of Jerusalem Affairs and Heritage\n|-\n|10||align=left|Ze'ev Elkin||align=left|Likud||34||1 June 2016||17 May 2020||\n|-\n|11||align=left|Rafi Peretz||align=left|Likud||35||17 May 2020||13 June 2021||\n|-\n|–||align=left|Ze'ev Elkin||align=left|New Hope||36||13 June 2021||29 December 2022||\n|-\n!colspan=7|Minister of Jerusalem Affairs\n|-\n|12||align=left|Amihai Eliyahu||align=left|Otzma Yehudit||37||29 December 2022|| 21 January 2025  ||Minister of Heritage, serving alongside Meir Porush\n|-\n|13||align=left|Meir Porush||align=left|United Torah Judaism||37||23 January 2023||17 July 2025 ||Minister of Tradition, serving alongside Amichai Eliyahu\n|-\n|14||align=left|Haim Katz||align=left|Likud||37||23 January 2025|| 19 March 2025 ||Minister of Heritage, serving alongside Meir Porush\n|-\n|15||align=left|Amihai Eliyahu||align=left|Otzma Yehudit||37||19 March 2025|| || Minister of Heritage, serving alongside Meir Porush\n|-\n|16||align=left|Benjamin Netanyahu||align=left|Likud||37||July 2025||||Minister of Tradition, serving alongside Amichai Eliyahu\n|-\n|}\nDeputy ministers\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n!#\n!Minister\n!Party\n!Governments\n!Term start\n!Term end\n|-\n|1||align=left|Avraham Verdiger||align=left|Agudat Yisrael||24||27 November 1990||13 July 1992\n|}\nReferences"
