Similar software such as Cleverbot existed for many years, and the software is, on the fundamental level, not structured toward accuracy – e.g. providing seemingly credible but incorrect answers to queries and operating \"without a contextual understanding of the language\" – but only toward essentially the authenticity of mimicked human language. It was estimated that only two months after its launch, it had 100 million active users. Applications may include solving or supporting school writing assignments, malicious social bots (e.g. for misinformation, propaganda, and scams), and providing inspiration (e.g. for artistic writing or in design or ideation in general).\n*Google released chatbot Bard due to effects of the ChatGPT release, with potential for integration into its Web search and, like ChatGPT software, also as a software development helper tool. DuckDuckGo released the DuckAssist feature integrated into its search engine that summarizes information from Wikipedia to answer search queries that are questions. The experimental feature was shut down without explanation on 12 April. There has been further development regarding LLMs or ChatGPT as user interfaces of Wikipedia or as software using its structured knowledge by others. It may demonstrate an alternative approach to ChatGPT whose fundamental algorithms are not designed to generate text that is true, including for example \"hallucinations\" and fake citations or misinformation more generally. Elicit.org may provide a free alternative to this tool. A broader alternative approach to the software's Q&A applications and use of text generation for assignments may be the improvement of media literacy and Web search skills in education systems.\n*Further LLM developments during what has been called an \"AI boom\" included: local or open source versions of LLaMA which was leaked in March, news outlets reported on GPT4-based Auto-GPT that given natural language commands uses the Internet and other tools in attempts to understand and achieve its tasks with unclear or so-far little practicality, a systematic evaluation of answers from four \"generative search engines\" suggested their outputs \"appear informative, but frequently contain unsupported statements and inaccurate citations\", a multi-modal open source tool for understanding and generating speech, a data scientist argued that \"researchers need to collaborate to develop open-source LLMs that are transparent\" and independent, Stability AI launched an open source LLM.\n*A method for editing NeRF scenes, a novel media technique from 2020, with natural language commands was demonstrated by Nvidia.\n*An open letter \"Pause Giant AI Experiments\" initiated by the Future of Life Institute called for \"AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4\" due to \"profound risks to society and humanity\". It received substantial media attention and also contributed to speculations about perceived large LLM potential). At the time there was extensive media coverage of views that regard ChatGPT as a potential step towards AGI or sentient machines, also extending to some academic works (e.g. a popular preprint by a company). The coverage focused on such views may not represent the majority expert views and, for example, some researchers noted that e.g. the ability to generate coherent text and imitations are not the same as understanding language. A set of techniques under development included self-refining code or text.\n*ChatGPT was shown to outperform human doctors in responding to online medical questions when measured on quality and empathy by \"a team of licensed health care professionals\", albeit the chatbot may have previously been trained with these reddit question and answers threads.\n*News outlets reported on a preprint that described the development of a large language model software that can answer medical questions with a 67.6% accuracy on  and nearly matched human clinician performance when answering open-ended medical questions, Med-PaLM. The AI makes use of comprehension-, recall of knowledge-, and medical reasoning-algorithms but remains inferior to clinicians. As of 2023, humans often – if not most often – conduct query-based web searches, read websites and/or conduct physical doctor's visits to inquire health information, despite various difficulties, partly as they typically did not undergo any formal training in media literacy, digital literacy or health literacy, as such is not part of schools curricula in most education systems as of 2023.\n*A novel potentially significantly more efficient text-to-image approach, as implemented in MUSE, was reported.\n*A first successful autonomous long-duration operation, including simulated combat, of a modified F-16 fighter jet, X-62A, by two AI software was reported.\n*A text-to-speech synthesizer, VALL-E, that can be trained to mimic anybody's voice with just three seconds of voice data and may produce the most natural-sounding results to date, was reported in a preprint.\n*A use of world models for a wide range of domains that make decisions using e.g. different 3D worlds and reward frequencies and outperforms previous approaches, DreamerV3, was reported as a step towards general artificial intelligence in a preprint.\n*A large language model, ProGen, that can generate functional protein sequences with a predictable function, with input including tags specifying protein properties, was reported.\n*A deep-learning model, ZFDesign, for zinc finger design for any genomic target for gene- and epigenetic-editing was reported.\n*Software for generating 3D dynamic scenes (text-to-4D), , was reported.-->\n*A study reported the development of deep learning algorithms to identify technosignature candidates, finding 8 potential alien signals not detected earlier.\n*An international norms and arms control proposal for artificial intelligence in the military (such as LAWs and weapons decision-making), the \"Political Declaration on Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy]\", was published by the U.S. government. The first international summit on military AI led to a joint unbinding statement by the U.S., China and other nations, with some external calls for starting negotiations on an internationally binding law or an enforcement-mechanisms-driven law.\n*The world's first COVID-19 drug designed by generative AI was approved for human use, with clinical trials expected to begin in China. The new drug, ISM3312, was developed by Insilico Medicine.\n*The LLM GPT-4 was launched by OpenAI. It and ChatGPT based on it continued to receive major global media attention.\n*Researchers suggested that growing influence of industry in AI research means that \"public interest alternatives for important AI tools may become increasingly scarce\".\n*Google revealed PaLM-E, an embodied multimodal language model with 562 billion parameters.\nsystem overview]]\n* Researchers demonstrated an open source '' that can create models of natural phenomena from knowledge axioms and experimental data, showing the software can rediscover physical laws like \"Kepler's third law of planetary motion, Einstein's relativistic time-dilation law, and Langmuir's theory of adsorption\" using logical reasoning and a few data points.\n* Researchers demonstrated a non-invasive brain-reading method. It can translate a person's neural activity into a continuous stream of text using fMRI data and transformer machine learning. Prior training data is required for this semantic decoding. Participants listened to stories for 16 hours while their brain activity was recorded.\n*A new AI algorithm developed by Baidu was shown to boost the antibody response of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines by 128 times.\n*Computational neuroscientists showed that people with higher intelligence scores in HCP cognitive tests took more time to solve difficult problems and that their higher synchrony between brain areas allowed for better integration of evidence (or progress) from preceding working memory sub-problem processing. Reducing synchrony in \"avatar\" simulations, that were adjusted and tuned , \"led decision-making circuits to quickly jump to conclusions\". Their codified results may be useful for an understanding of cognition to replicate or imitate in bio-inspired computing.\n*AI was used to develop an experimental antibiotic called abaucin, which is shown to be effective against A. baumannii.\n*A machine learning model is trained to recognise the key features of chemicals with senolytic activity. It finds three chemicals – ginkgetin, periplocin and oleandrin – able to remove senescent cells without damaging healthy cells.\n*Articles in science outlets like Nature suggest contemporary viral concerns about hypothetical existential risk of AI \"plays into the tech companies' agenda\" – partly in the form of 'criti-hype' – and that this \"hinders effective regulation of the societal harms AI is causing right now\" and in the near-future.\n* A science writer provides an overview of \"the nascent industry of AI-designed drugs\".\n* A preprint introduces the concept of \"thought cloning\" by which AI use data of or imitate human thinking.\n* Metaresearchers showed that AI trained with study-author-networks data could generate scientifically promising \"alien\" hypotheses that would likely not be considered otherwise.\n* A study provides an overview and living review of open source LLMs, assessing the levels of openness of their differentiated elements and reviewing the risks of relying on proprietary software or the importance of open source AI.\nMed-PaLM M training data]]\n* AI-supported mammography screening was demonstrated to have the potential to substantially reduce workload and to possibly improve cancer detection rates.\n* A review outlined applications and challenges of using AI to accelerate science.\n*A study that won an international competition

DeepMind announced its Gemini multimodal language model, which it claims has advanced \"reasoning capabilities\" and can outperform GPT-4 on a variety of tasks.\n* A new class of antibiotic candidates, able to kill methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was identified using explainable deep learning.\n* Notable innovation products: an open source automated experimentation science platform (BacterAI) for predicting microbial metabolism , a low-cost smartphone-attachment (BPClip) for blood pressure measurement, an open source transfer learning-based system (Geneformer) for predicting how networks of interconnected human genes control or affect the function of cells, a performant open source AI software for protein design (RFdiffusion) was introduced, multimodal biomedical  was introduced.\nSoftware-hardware systems\n*A two/multi-robot and beacons mesh communication paradigm for exploration by robotic probes, drones, spacecraft, disaster recovery rovers or

(DeWave).\nSoftware\n*Researchers demonstrated how pre-installed apps on Android smartphones in China are  mass surveillance in China.\n*Scientists reviewed safety-by-design technology- and policy-based approaches to ensure biosafety and biosecurity to prevent engineered pathogen pandemics, including digital methods such as DNA sequence screening, some of which are already implemented and part of regulations to some degree.\n*Studies investigated dating apps, revealing high gender inequality, partly exploring possible relevance to the rise of both \"sexual loneliness\" and concentration of sex in various developed countries, and reported subsets of well-being effects.\n*A study hypothesized mental health awareness efforts (in current forms) or glamorised and romanticised mental disorders on social media (e.g. quotes about depression on aesthetically appealing backgrounds shared widely on certain social media) may have contributed to the recent rise in reported mental health problems – by intensifying and over-diagnosing of such – beyond e.g. increased reporting of previously under-recognised symptoms or mental health-related issues.\n*A news outlet reported on a systematic study of major issues in popular currently available commercial VPNs for Internet privacy and security.\n*Researchers reported 'digital resignation', calling for regulations and education reform.\n*Parts of Twitter's recommender algorithms became open source, welcomed and requested by many albeit with several issues related to code exclusion and verifiability. Around the time, the free version of its API, which was also used for research, was shut down – followed shortly thereafter by reddit, proprietary verification checkmarks caused controversy, parts of its source code were leaked, and applications of a \"state-affiliated media\" label – which purportedly uses \":Category:Publicly funded broadcasters\" data which, like the label, does not differentiate and list the shares of funding sources – caused controversy. In April, Twitter was warned by EU digital policy-makers after a report indicated its recent policies \"boost\" Russian disinformation-based propaganda.\n*One of the first empirical studies on what real users are shown during their typical use of popular Web search engines interpreted its results to show that choices for unreliable news sources for their queries are driven primarily by users' own choices and less by the engine's algorithms. The Web scientists linked their findings to the concept of filter bubbles which emphasizes the role of design- and personalization algorithms. A report accompanied by an open letter concluded that Alphabet Inc, against its voluntary promises, still runs climate misinformation ads. Statements by Elon Musk in 2022 suggested YouTube may also show ethically disputed advertising other than science-related misinformation such as extensively showing \"scam ads\".\n*An umbrella review summarized the research on benefits and risks associated with digital media use by youths, suggesting caregivers, policymakers and researchers should continue to move away from prevailing oversimplified recommendations to reduce screen time to instead focus on distinguished types of screen use.\n*An experimental study reported online search to evaluate the truthfulness of false news articles increased the probability of believing them, especially for those for whom search engines return lower-quality information. It suggests media literacy programs with tested strategies and solutions for identified search engines issues are needed.\n* The concept of enshittification about the quality of content on social media platforms introduced in 2022 gained traction.\n* Notable innovations: a Tor browser-equivalent Web browser for privacy-protected browsing when using a VPN (Mullvad browser) was demonstrated, after moderators of the Web content aggregation-based platform Reddit strike against the site's introduction of API pricing and the ensuing closing of several mobile client apps, several novel decentralized open source aggregation platforms gain substantial numbers of users – most notably Lemmy and Kbin which can synchronize their posts via interoperability, the first upgrade of the Global Earthquake Model  for disaster risk reduction, and the misinformation-countering system Community Notes became relatively widely used on X (formerly Twitter).\nHardware and wetware\n*Researchers demonstrated an open-brain surgery-free brain implant, Stentrode, that can record brain activity from a nearby blood vessel, showing it can be used to operate a computer.\n*News outlets reported on a study (21 Nov. 2022) demonstrating locust antennae implanted as biosensors into (bio-hybrid) robots for AI-interpreted machine olfaction.\n' (OI).]]\n*Scientists coalesced recent developments  using human brain organoids into a new field they term organoid intelligence (OI), seeking to harness OI for computing – as a novel type of AI – in an ethically responsible way. Networks of such miniature tissues could become functional using stimulus-response training or organoid-computer interfaces – to potentially become \"more powerful than silicon-based computing\" for a range of tasks – and could also be used for research of various pathophysiologies, brain development, human learning, memory and intelligence, and new therapeutic approaches against brain diseases.\n*Biological organoid intelligence, 'Brainoware', was demonstrated to solve  in a preprint, with implications for bioethics and potential bottlenecks and limits of nonbio-AI.\n*A study demonstrated functional integration of a magnetically steered microbot containing neurons, 'Mag-Neurobot', in a mouse \"organotypic hippocampal slice\" as physical (semi-) artificial neurons.\n*Researchers reported the development of a fuel cell implant powered by blood glucose. It can also release insulin at certain levels and have enough energy to allow smartphone implant control.\n*Researchers reported the development of neuromorphic AI hardware using nanowires  physically mimicking the brain's activity in identifying and remembering an image from memory. A university reported on a demonstration of multisensory motion cue integration by a  for robots.\nwithout new DNA synthesis by recording light exposure.]]\n*Researchers demonstrated encoding and storing data – small images – as DNA without new DNA synthesis by recording light exposure into bacterial DNA via optogenetic circuits. The 'biological camera' extends chemical and electrical interface techniques.\n* Researchers demonstrated the use of biological-electronic hybrid Organoid Intelligence, 'Brainoware', for speech recognition.\n2022\nAI\n*DeepMind announced that its AlphaFold program had uncovered the structures of more than 200 million folded proteins, essentially all of those known to science.\nreported that its AlphaFold program had determined the likely structure of nearly every protein known to science.]]\n*News outlets reported artificial intelligence art had won the first place in a digital art competition. Such artistic imagery is generated using input consisting of text and sometimes images, usually including parameters such as artistic style (text-to-image generation). Around the time, an expert concluded that \"AI art is everywhere right now\", with even experts not knowing what it will mean, a news outlet established that \"AI-generated art booms\" and reported issues of copyright and automation of professional artists, a news outlet investigated how online communities (e.g. their rules) confronted with many such artworks react, a news outlet raised concerns over deepfakes, a magazine highlighted possibilities of enabling \"new forms of artistic expression\", and an editorial noted that it may be seen as a welcome . Moreover, additional functionalities – such as enabling the use of user-provided concepts (like an object or a style) learned from few images for novel personalized art generated from the associated word/s or expanding beyond the borders of artistic images in the same style – were reported. On 22 August, Stable Diffusion released as open source software, making the technology more accessible and free to use on personal hardware as well as extendable by third-parties (i.e. other software projects).\n*A new deep learning technique enabled year-round measurements of sea ice thickness in the Arctic.\n*A screening AI system for many cancer types that integrates different types of data via multimodal learning was reported.\nsystems learn intuitive basic physics similar to infants and any physics via potential variables-identification from only visual data (of virtual 3D environments).]]\n*Researchers reported the development of a deep learning system that learns intuitive physics from visual data (of virtual 3D environments) to some degree \"from scratch\" based on an unpublished approach inspired by studies of visual cognition in infants.

Each letter is associated with a highly distinctive pattern of activity in the brain, making it relatively easy for the algorithm to distinguish them.\n* Archivists initiated a rescue mission to secure enduring access to humanity's largest public library of scientific articles, Sci-Hub, due to the site's increased legal troubles, using Web and BitTorrent technologies.\n* Google demonstrated a research project called LaMDA, an automatic language generation system designed to sustain a conversation with a person on any topic.\n* The most comprehensive 3D map of the human brain – of a millionth of a brain and requiring 1.4 petabytes of storage space – was published.\n* El Salvador passed the Bitcoin Law, making it the first country to give cryptocurrency and bitcoin a status of legal tender. The law was passed by the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador on June 8, 2021, giving the cryptocurrency bitcoin the status of legal tender within El Salvador after September 7, 2021. It was proposed by President Nayib Bukele. The text of the law states that \"the purpose of this law is to regulate bitcoin as unrestricted legal tender with liberating power, unlimited in any transaction, and to any title that public or private natural or legal persons require carrying out\".\n* GitHub Copilot, a programmer assistant AI, was released. Later FOSS variants of the tool included FauxPilot.\ns and digital technology in general and by prevalent forms of use.]]\n* In the debate regarding the cognitive impacts of smartphones and digital technology, a group reported that, contrary to widespread belief, scientific evidence does not show that these technologies harm biological cognitive abilities and that they instead change predominant ways of cognition – such as a reduced need to remember facts or conduct mathematical calculations by pen and paper outside contemporary schools. However, some activities – like reading novels – that require long attention-spans and don't feature ongoing rewarding stimulation may become more challenging in general.\n* Open 3D Engine – a game engine that is free and open source software (FOSS) and has Linux support – was released.\n* Researchers used a brain–computer interface to enable a man who was paralyzed since 2003 to produce comprehensible words and sentences by decoding signals from electrodes in the speech areas of his brain.\n* Japan achieved a new world record Internet speed: 319 Tbit/s over ~3000&nbsp;km which, albeit not being the fastest speed overall, beats the previous record of 178&nbsp;Tbit/s.\n* Scientists reported that worldwide adolescent loneliness and depression increased substantially after 2012 and that loneliness in contemporary schools appears to be associated with smartphone access and Internet use.\n's AlphaFold AI predicted the structures of over 350,000 proteins, including 98.5% of the ~20,000 proteins in the human body, along with degrees of confidence for accuracy.]]\n* DeepMind announced that its AlphaFold AI had predicted the structures of over 350,000 proteins, including 98.5% of the ~20,000 proteins in the human body.

She described potential mitigation measures and exceptions – such as user-powered mesh networks and related peer-to-peer applications – and the robustness of the current Internet infrastructure.\nmodels for genome-based early detection and prioritization of high-risk potential zoonotic viruses.]]\n* Scientists concluded that personal carbon allowances (PCAs) could be a component of climate change mitigation. They found that the economic recovery from COVID-19 and novel digital technology capacities open a window of opportunity for first implementations. PCAs would consist of – e.g. monetary – credit-feedbacks and decreasing default levels of per capita emissions concessions. The researchers found that recent advances in machine learning technology and \"smarter home and transport options make it possible to easily track and manage a large share of individuals' emissions\" and that feedback effective in engaging individuals to reduce their energy-related emissions and relevant new personalized apps could be designed. Issues may include privacy, evaluating emissions from individuals co-running multinational companies and the availability and prices of products and services.\n* Cerebras announced a new hardware and software platform that can support AI models of 120&nbsp;trillion parameters, enabling neural networks greater than the equivalent number of human brain synapses.\n* Pathogen researchers reported the development of machine learning models for genome-based early detection and prioritization of high-risk potential zoonotic viruses in animals prior to spillover to humans. They concluded that their tool could be used for virus surveillance for pandemic prevention via (i.a.) measures of \"early investigation and outbreak preparedness\" and would have been capable of predicting SARS-CoV-2 as a high-risk strain.\n* A loss of public IP routes to the Facebook DNS servers due to malfunctioning capacity-assessment code, routinely triggered after configuration changes of routers of the company's data centers, resulted in stoppage of BGP routing information broadcasts caused the 2021 Facebook outage.\n* A study of data traffic by popular smartphones running variants of the Android software found substantial by-default data collection and sharing with no opt-out (i.e. even the NetGuard firewall, which is not installed by default, may not reliably and completely prevent such data traffic) and implications for users' privacy, control and security.\n* Media outlets reported novel technologies for virtual try-ons of clothes for more sustainable fashion and improved online shopping, which increased relative to shopping at local shops that store clothes due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n*A method of DNA data storage with 100 times the density of previous techniques was announced.\n* Scientists demonstrated that grown brain cells integrated into digital systems can carry out goal-directed tasks with performance-scores. In particular, playing a simulated (via electrophysiological stimulation) Pong which the cells learned to play faster than known machine intelligence systems, albeit to a lower skill-level than both AI and humans, was reported. Moreover, the study suggested it provides the \"first empirical evidence\" of information-processing capacity differences between neurons from different species.\n*Researchers reported the development of organic low-power neuromorphic electronics which they built into a robot, enabling it to learn sensorimotorically within the real world, rather than via simulations like in the study above. For the chip, polymers were used and coated with an ion-rich gel to enable the material to carry an electric charge like real neurons.\n* Researchers reported the development of a system of machine learning and hyperspectral camera that can distinguish between 12 different types of plastics such as PET and PP for automated separation of waste of, as of 2020, highly unstandardized plastics products and packaging.\n* A scientific review summarized research and data about telemedicine. Its results indicated that, in general, outcomes of such ICT-use are as good as in-person care with health care use staying similar.\n* The Log4Shell security vulnerability in a Java logging framework was publicly disclosed two weeks after its discovery.

In a high-level meeting, the importance of security maintenance of open-source software – often also carried out largely by few volunteers – to national security was clarified.\n* Researchers reported the development of a database and analysis tool about perovskite solar cells which systematically integrates over 15,000 publications, in particular device-data about over 42,400 of such photovoltaic devices. Authors described the site – which requires signing up to access the data and uses software that is partly open source but to date not free software – as a participative \"Wikipedia for perovskite solar cell research\" and suggest that extensively capturing the progress of an entire field including interactive data exploration functionalities could also be applicable to many fields in materials science, engineering and biosciences.\n* A third main convergent graphical shell (Maui Shell) and UI framework (MauiKit), based on KDE/Kirigami, for the Linux operating system on smartphones, desktops and other devices, was released.\n2020\n* February 7 – AMD released the Ryzen Threadripper 3990X, the first 64 core CPU for consumer market based on the Zen 2 microarchitecture.\n* March 12 – 15.ai, a free web application that used artificial intelligence to generate text-to-speech voices of fictional characters, was launched. Created by an AI researcher at MIT, it was notable for its ability to clone voices using as little as 15 seconds of audio data and became widely popular for creating memes and fan content. The platform introduced novel features like emotional contextualizers using DeepMoji for sentiment analysis and supported precise pronunciation control through ARPABET phonetic transcriptions.\n* March 26 – After one of the first and largest public volunteer distributed computing projects, SETI@home announced its shutdown by March 31, 2020, and due to heightened interest as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the distributed computing project Folding@home became the world's first system to reach one exaFLOPS. The system simulates protein folding, is used for medical research on COVID-19 and achieved a speed of approximately 2.43 x86 exaFLOPS by April 13, 2020 many times faster than the fastest supercomputer, Summit.\n* April 20 – Researchers demonstrated a diffusive memristor fabricated from protein nanowires of the bacterium Geobacter sulfurreducens which functions at substantially lower voltages than previously described ones and may allow the construction of artificial neurons which function at voltages of biological action potentials. The nanowires have a range of advantages over silicon nanowires and the memristors may be used to directly process biosensing signals, for neuromorphic computing and/or direct communication with biological neurons.\n* May 22 – Australian computer scientists reported achieving, thus far, the highest internet speed in the world from a single optical chip source over standard optical fiber, amounting to 44.2 Terabits per sec, or \"downloading 1000 high definition movies in a split second\".\n* May 27 – A study showed that social networks can function poorly as pathways for inconvenient truths, that the interplay between communication and action during disasters may depend on the structure of social networks, that communication networks suppress necessary \"evacuations\" in test-scenarios because of false reassurances when compared to groups of isolated individuals and that larger networks with a smaller proportion of informed subjects can suffer more damage due to human-caused misinformation.\n* June 11 – Chatbot-technology and text-producing AI GPT-3 was released.\n* July 6 – [Novel protocol/standard] – The Versatile Video Coding standard (H.266) was finalised, designed to halve the bitrate of previous formats, reducing data volume and being especially useful for on-demand 8K streaming services.\n* June 15 – Researchers reported the development of a polymer device that can receive dopamine signals from real cells and learns from it.\n* July 15 – A cyborg beetle with a camera was demonstrated.
