Others who have performed and lived in the area were Horace Andy, Don Drummond, Johnny Moore, and Tommy McCook. When Captain Sinbad moved to the UK, he named his new enterprise \"Rockfort Records\".\nAn enclave for the lower-middle class in the 1950s and 1960s, gang violence began to erupt in the 1980s, and became significantly worse by 2017.\nIn August 2017, a rash of gang violence, crimes, and murder in the area drove some residents to move out of their homes.\nReferences"
