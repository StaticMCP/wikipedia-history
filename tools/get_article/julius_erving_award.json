      "text": "# Julius Erving Award\n\n}}\nThe Julius Erving Small Forward of the Year Award is an annual basketball award given by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame to the top men's collegiate small forward. Following  the success of the Bob Cousy Award which had been awarded since 2004, the award was one of four new awards (along with the Jerry West Award, Karl Malone Award, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Award) created as part of the inaugural College Basketball Awards show in 2015. It is named after Julius Erving, a Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee who played the position. The inaugural winner was Stanley Johnson of Arizona. The school with the most all-time winners is Villanova, with three.\nKey\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| Awarded a national player of the year award: Sporting News; Oscar Robertson Trophy; Associated Press; NABC; Naismith; Wooden\n|-\n| Player (X)\n| Denotes the number of times the player has been awarded the Julius Erving Award at that point\n|}\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
