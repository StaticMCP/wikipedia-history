It covered an area in what is now the western part of the Indonesian province of Central Kalimantan. It then had a brief existence as an autonomous \"native state\" in the United States of Indonesia between 1949 and 1950, before being formally created as a separate Kotawaringin Regency within what was then the Province of South Kalimantan (from which the western part, then consisting of three regencies — the kabupaten of Barito, Kapuas, and Kotawaringin, was split off in 1957 to form the new Central Kalimantan province). However, on 26 June 1959, Kotawaringin Regency was divided into a West Kotawaringin Regency and East Kotawaringin Regency.\nFormer territory\nDuring the Hindu kingdom era, before the arrival of Islam there, the westernmost border of Kotawaringin was the Nanga Pinoh River, while to the west was the Sintang Kingdom which controlled the Melawi River, both rivers are currently in the administrative area of Melawi Regency, West Kalimantan. This can be seen from the presence of benang pukat (trawl nets) found in Nanga Sokan. This trawl nets thread is a kind of proof of a peace agreement between the kingdoms of Sintang and Kotawaringin.\nOn 10 April 2002, additional regencies were created by splitting the two existing regencies — Sukamara and Lamandau from parts of West Kotawaringin Regency, and Seruyan and Katingan from parts of East Kotawaringin Regency.\nIn recent years, there has been some research into local attitudes, with a view to the putative re-establishment of Kotawaringin as a separate province, separate from the rest of Central Kalimantan, based upon the recognition of a shared identity of \"Orang Kotawaringin\". Such a province would cover an area of some 71,600 km2 and would have a population as at 2023 of some 1.25 million people.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\"\n|-\n! align=\"center\" | KodeWilayah !! align=\"center\" | Name ofRegency !! align=\"center\" | Areainkm2 !! align=\"center\" | Pop'n2010Census !! align=\"center\" | Pop'n2020Census !! align=\"center\" | Pop'nmid 2023Estimate\n|-\n| 62.01 || West Kotawaringin ||align=\"right\"|  ||align=\"right\"|  ||align=\"right\"|  ||align=\"right\"|\n|-\n| 62.02 || East Kotawaringin ||align=\"right\"|  ||align=\"right\"|  ||align=\"right\"|  ||align=\"right\"|\n|-\n| 62.08 || Sukamara Regency ||align=\"right\"|  ||align=\"right\"|  ||align=\"right\"|  ||align=\"right\"|\n|-\n| 62.09 || Lamandau Regency ||align=\"right\"|  ||align=\"right\"|  ||align=\"right\"|  ||align=\"right\"|\n|-\n| 62.07 || Seruyan Regency ||align=\"right\"|  ||align=\"right\"|  ||align=\"right\"|  ||align=\"right\"|\n|-\n| 62.06 || Katingan Regency ||align=\"right\"|  ||align=\"right\"|  ||align=\"right\"|  ||align=\"right\"|\n|-\n| || Totals ||align=\"right\"| ' ||align=\"right\"| ' ||align=\"right\"| ' ||align=\"right\"| '\n|}\nSee also\n* East Kotawaringin Regency\n* West Kotawaringin Regency\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*"
