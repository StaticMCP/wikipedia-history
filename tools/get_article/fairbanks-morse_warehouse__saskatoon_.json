Formerly serving as a warehouse for the Fairbanks-Morse Company, the building has been converted into residential condominium lofts.\nHistory\nCanadian Fairbanks Company (later Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company) built the structure in 1911 as a warehouse for its large machinery and mill supply business. It was designed by David Brown and Hugh Vallance of Montreal, who also designed many of the original buildings on the University of Saskatchewan campus. It was built with reinforced concrete, uncommon at that time.\nFrom 1948 until 1985 the Fairbanks-Morse Warehouse served as the home to the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation and as a union hall.\nThe building had CPR spur line until the mid-1960s, when much of the downtown was redeveloped. It changed hands several times, serving as a warehouse, offices, photography studio and art gallery. Some tenants of note include AKA Gallery, The Photographers Gallery and Video Vérité (of which the latter two would merge to become PAVED Arts). The building was declared a heritage site by the city on December 9, 1995.\nIn 2005–2006, Olstar Developments converted the building into 12 condominium loft spaces.\nReferences"
