It was signed in Königsberg (now Kaliningrad) on 30 January 1384. Vytautas granted territory to the Teutonic Knights in return for their support in the civil war.\nBackground\nTreaty\nIn order to secure Teutonic support in the civil war, Vytautas signed the Treaty of Königsberg, granting Samogitia up to the Nevėžis River and Kaunas to the Teutonic Order. In 1382, Jogaila had promised the Knights Samogitia only up to the Dubysa River, but never ratified the Treaty of Dubysa. Samogitia was important for the Knights as this territory physically separated them from uniting with the Livonian Order to the north. Vytautas also promised to become the Order's vassal. In February 1384, several Samogitian regions acknowledged their support to Vytautas and the Knights.\nOn 16 July 1384, Vytautas re-confirmed the Treaty of Königsberg in New Marienverder, a new fortress built on the Neman River. However, the treaty was broken in July when Vytautas and Jogaila reconciled. Vytautas burned Teutonic castles and returned to Lithuania.\nDuring the Lithuanian Civil War (1389–1392) Vytautas once again asked for military support from the Knights. On 19 January 1390, he signed the Treaty of Lyck, confirming the Treaty of Königsberg only to break it again in 1392. Vytautas granted Samogitia to the Knights twice more, first in the Treaty of Salynas (1398) and then in the Treaty of Raciąż (1404).\nLithuanian historian Danilevičius and Polish historian Koneczny raised doubts whether the treaty is original and not a Teutonic forgery.\nReferences"
