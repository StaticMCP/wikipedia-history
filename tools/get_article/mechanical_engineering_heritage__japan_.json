Items in the list are certified by the .\nOverview\nThe Mechanical Engineering Heritage program was inaugurated in June 2007 in connection with the 110th anniversary of the founding of the JSME. The program recognizes machines, related systems, factories, specification documents, textbooks, and other items that had a significant impact on the development of mechanical engineering in Japan. When a certified item can no longer be maintained by its current owner, the JSME acts to prevent its loss by arranging a transfer to the National Science Museum of Japan or to a local government institution.\nThe JSME plans to certify several items of high heritage value over the years.\nCategories\nItems in the Mechanical Engineering Heritage (Japan) are classified into four categories:\n# Sites: Historical sites that contain heritage items.\n# Landmarks: Representative buildings, structures, and machinery.\n# Collections: Collections of machinery, or individual machines.\n# Documents: Machinery-related documents of historical significance.\nEach item is assigned a Mechanical Engineering Heritage number.\nItems certified in 2007\nSites\n* No. 1: Steam engines and hauling machinery at the Kosuge Ship Repair Dock, (built in 1868). – Nagasaki Prefecture\nLandmarks\n* No. 2: Memorial workshop and machine tools at Kumamoto University, (built in 1908). – Kumamoto Prefecture\nCollections\n* No. 3: Forged iron treadle lathe (made in 1875 by Kaheiji Ito). – Aichi Prefecture\n* No. 4: Industrial Steam Turbine (Parsons steam turbine), (made in 1908). – Nagasaki Prefecture\n* No. 5: 10A Mazda Wankel engine (made in 1967). – Hiroshima Prefecture\n* No. 6: Honda CVCC engine (first engine to meet emission standards of Clean Air Act (1970)). – Tochigi Prefecture\n* No. 7: FJR710 Jet Engine (made in 1971). – Tokyo\n* No. 8: Yanmar small horizontal Diesel Engine, Model HB (made in 1933). – Shiga Prefecture\n* No. 9: Prof. Inokuchi's centrifugal pump, (made in 1912). – Aichi Prefecture\n* No. 10: High frequency generator (made in 1929 by German AEG). – Aichi Prefecture\n* No. 11: 0-Series Tōkaidō Shinkansen electric multiple units (operated 1964–1978). – Osaka Prefecture\n* No. 12: Class 230 No. 233 2-4-2 steam tank locomotive (made 1902–1909). – Osaka Prefecture\n* No. 13: YS11 passenger airplane (flown 1964–2009). – Tokyo\n* No. 14: Cub Type F, Honda bicycle engine  (1952). – Tochigi Prefecture\n* No. 15: Chain stitch sewing machine for the production of straw hats (made in 1928). – Aichi Prefecture\n* No. 16:  Non-stop shuttle change automatic loom, Toyoda Type G (made in 1924). – Aichi Prefecture\n* No. 17: Hand operated letterpress printing machine (made in 1885). – Tokyo\n* No. 18: Komatsu bulldozer G40 (made in 1943). – Shizuoka Prefecture\n* No. 19: Olympus gastrocamera GT-I (made in 1950). – Tokyo\n* No. 20: Buckton universal testing machine (installed in 1908). – Hyōgo Prefecture\n* No. 21: Mutoh Drafter manual drafting machine, MH-I (made in 1953). – Tokyo\n* No. 22: Myriad year clock, (made in 1851). – Tokyo\n* No. 23: The Chikugo River Lift Bridge (opened in 1935). – Between Fukuoka and Saga Prefecture\nDocuments\n* No. 24: JSME publications from the early days of the society, (published in 1897, 1901 and 1934). – Tokyo\n* No. 25: \"Hydraulics and Hydraulic machinery\", lecture notes by Professors Bunji Mano and Ariya Inokuchi at Imperial University of Tokyo (1905). – Tokyo\nItems certified in 2008\nSites\n* No. 26: Sankyozawa hydroelectric power station and related objects, (operating since 1888). – Miyagi Prefecture\n* No. 27: Hydraulic lock (made in United Kingdom, operating since 1908) and floating steam crane (operated 1905–2008), Miike Port. – Fukuoka Prefecture\nCollections\n* No. 28: \"Entaro\" bus (Ford TT type), (1923, adapted from chassis imported from United States). – Saitama Prefecture\n* No. 29: Mechanical telecommunication devices (made in 1947 by Shinko Seisakusho Co.). – Iwate Prefecture\n* No. 30: Mechanical calculator, (Yazu Arithmometer, patented in 1903). – Fukuoka Prefecture\n* No. 31: Induction motor and design sheet (made in 1910, in the earliest days of the Japanese electrical machinery industry). – Ibaraki Prefecture\nItems certified in 2009\nSites\n* No. 32: Mechanical Device of Sapporo Clock Tower, (clock mechanism imported/installed from E.

Imported three-point roller Macadam Road roller had been used until 1920s. Sakai Seisakusho, present  made first Japanese version of Macadam type Road roller with internal combustion engine in 1930, and put in market, then in 1968 innovative new model R1 developed. Before model R1, three-point roller that is one-front-roller and two-rear-rollers type which had troubles push forward or trailing road surface material, new model R1 three-point roller, two-front-rollers and one-rear-roller type instead, solved the troubles. Model R1 three rollers driven by oil hydraulic machinery with the same and consistent roller pressure to road surface, three rollers are in the same size in diameter, and three-roller drive in synchronization. Model R1 Road roller itself rudder like curved so that less turning radius and consistent roller pressure for straight and curving road without unevenness with pressing width 2.3 metre. Driver's seat has two steering wheels, left and right, and which wheel to use is driver's choice with effective in man-machine work, R1 machine structure became industrial De facto standard, then in 1974, rather small successor R2 produced suitable for Japanese road conditions. – Saitama Prefecture\n*No. 124: Strain Gage Type K-1. Founder of  Kyowa Musen Kenkyujo, present Kyowa Electronic Instrument,  produced and begun to sell first Japan made strain gauge type K-1 covered with red colored felt in 1951. Meanwhile Ministry of Transport Technology Laboratory section Ship Structure asked him to make prototype strain gauge under the circumstances that imported strain gauge, from United States and others, were widely used but high price, and also strain gauge under research stage was rail transport use. He worked for Army Ministry Aviation Laboratory during war time, recalled survey of shot down B29 strategic bomber and succeeded usable strain gauge after trial and errors. The strain gauge is 20.5mm, fine resistance wires size 25μm and 120Ω resistance covered by red felt for protection, to measure as the first stress test in the ship, then resulted that well change over to welding joint from rivet joint in strength required. Imported strain gauge from United States cost more than Yen1,000, and newly produced one is low cost only Yen86, therefore various measurement instrument uses this strain gauge especially contributed in mechanical engineering area, and it became indispensable component. – Tokyo\n*No. 125: ISHIKAWA - Marinoni Type Rotary Press with Folding Mechanism.

The total number of units produced on Type SB models; it had recorded approximately 30 percent market share with unit production quantity double in every year by 1960. The vaporization system of fuel oil has been widely adopted on kerosene fan heater and other petroleum heating machines thereafter. - Niigata Prefecture\n*No. 128: The Light-weight Electric Car with Arc-shaped Body;Tokyu 5000 Series. Formerly: Tokyu Car Corporation, (now: Japan Transport Engineering Company ) developed entirely steel made high speed electric multiple unit (Tokyu 5000 Series ) for more faster commuting in 1954. Former aeronautics engineers adopted monocoqueelectric train body of circle or curve cross section on contour line that they did not accept unspoken rule of the sides of steel made car body should be with contour line alike rectangular cuboid. They accomplished that car body is more than 10 tonne lighter weight, then it was called Super lightweight electric car, and realized 105 kilometres per hour speed, so that travel time between Shibuya Station and Sakuragichō Station is much saved to 34 minutes. The car body is changed from rectangular cuboid box to round cylinder in outer shape, and called with nickname “airplane without wings” or “green frog” of  body colored, and this new technology adopted on high speed line for Odakyu 3000 series SE, 0 Series Shinkansen and for other car bodies running on ordinary speed other rail roads as well.
