The \"masters of rites\", the fashi (), are also known in east China as hongtou daoshi (), meaning \"redhead\" or \"redhat\" daoshi (\"masters of the Tao\"), contrasting with the wutou daoshi (), \"blackhead\" or \"blackhat\" priests, of Zhengyi Taoism who were historically ordained by the Celestial Master.\nZhengyi Taoism and Faism are often grouped together under the category of \"daoshi and fashi ritual traditions\" (). Although the two types of priests have the same roles in Chinese society—in that they can marry and they perform rituals for communities' temples or private homes—Zhengyi daoshi emphasize their Taoist tradition, distinguished from the vernacular tradition of the fashi.\nRitual masters can be practitioners of tongji possession, healing, exorcism and jiao rituals (although historically they were excluded from performing the jiao liturgy). The only ones that are shamans (wu) are the fashi of the Lushan school.\nThe fashi\nsymbols are used also in ritual masters' traditions.]]\nThe ritual masters ( fashi) are defined, in opposition to formally ordained Taoist priests, as:\nMichael Saso (University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa) distinguishes fashi as \"kataphatic\" (of filling character) in opposition to Taoists as \"kenotic\" (of emptying character), and links them to other Sino-Tibetan indigenous religions:\nThey are known by different names throughout China, other popular ones being \"ritual officers\" (faguan) as they at times call themselves, or \"redhead\" Taoist priests ( hongtou daoshi). There are also localised names, such as \"orthodox lords\" (duangong), \"altar masters\" (zhangtanshi), or \"earth masters\" (tulaoshi) in Guizhou.\nThey are also in competition with other orders who perform similar services: monks and tantric masters under the auspices of Buddhism, and tongji medium.\nThe difference between ritual masters and Deities' mediums is that instead of being subject to territorial gods like the mediums, the ritual masters can marshal the powers of local Deities.\nRed Taoist orders\n, Yilan, Taiwan]]\nLushan school\nThe Lushan (Mount Lu) school (, also  or ), also known as Sannai school (), is present in Fujian, southern Zhejiang and Taiwan. It is very active nowadays, and is related to the worship of the goddess Chen Jinggu (\"Young Quiet Lady\") the Waterside Dame ( Línshuǐ Fūrén), who is very popular in the same area. It is also related to the cult of Wang Laomu, and competing with Maoshan Taoism.\nThe tradition shows similarities with Yao and Zhuang ritual traditions, and has incorporated elements of Tantra, such as the use of mudra and vajra. Lushan fashi perform rituals as the head of celestial troops while invoking the \"Three Ladies\" (sannai): Chen Jinggu and her two disciples, Lin Jiuniang and Li Sanniang. Although Lushan fashi are men, in performance they wear the ritual red skirt of Chen Jinggu and a crown or headdress with the words \"Three Ladies\" painted on it. Lushan fashi also practice a shamanic voyage rite called \"crossing the roads and the passes\" (guo luguan).\nPu'an school\nThe Pu'an school () is present in west-central Fujian, southern Jiangxi and Taiwan. The historical figure of the Buddhist monk Pu’an is worshipped by the practitioners as their \"founding master\" (zushi). Their texts, rituals and iconography incorporate Tantric themes adapted in a Taoist style, and have elements of the Zhengyi and Lushan traditions.\nXujia school\nThe Xujia school () is another form of ritual masters.\nNorthern orders\n* Yuehu\n* Zhuli\n* Shenjia , families of hereditary specialists of gods and rites\n* Yinyang masters or fengshui masters, using the Lingbao scriptural tradition\nSee also\n* Confucianism\n* Fuji (planchette writing)\n* Nuo folk religion\n* Dajiao\n* Taoist schools\n* Yao folk religion\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* , Tai bei shi |location=Wen jin |isbn=9789576689451}}\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*"
