It has an approximate area of 1.5&nbsp;hectares and a diameter of 130&nbsp;metres. The lake is filled from the east by the Beke that carries water from the Tiefwarensee, 230&nbsp;metres away, and is also drained by the Beke to the southwest into the  Binnenmüritz just 70&nbsp;metres away. The lake contains several small bush-covered islets that are used as nesting sites by water fowl.\nThe Herrensee lies on the edge of a small park and there is a nature trail running around it. It gives its name to the bridge that divides the park, the Herrensee Bridge (Herrenseebrücke), which runs over the B 192 federal road and the Lloyd Railway and links the Old Town to the quarter of Waren-Nord.\nExternal links\n* [http://www.mueritzeum.de/ Home page of the Müritzeum]"
