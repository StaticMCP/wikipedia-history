Cale worked with several guest musicians including David Byrne, Moe Tucker, Dave Soldier with the Soldier String Quartet, B. J. Cole and Erik Sanko. It was recorded at Sorcerer Sound in New York City. Cale claimed the album evolved from touring with New York City's Soldier String Quartet. \"Some Friends\" was about his former Velvet Underground colleague, Sterling Morrison, who died unexpectedly the previous year.\nTrack listing\n| length4      = 3:28\n| title5       = So Much for Love\n| length5      = 5:01\n| title6       = Tell Me Why\n| length6      = 5:25\n| title7       = Indistinct Notion of Cool\n| length7      = 2:44\n| title8       = Secret Corrida\n| length8      = 6:02\n| title9       = Circus\n| length9      = 4:03\n| title10      = Gatorville & Points East\n| length10     = 3:00\n| title11      = Some Friends\n| length11     = 4:06\n| title12      = Entre Nous\n| length12     = 3:42\n}}\nPersonnel\nMusicians\n* John Cale − acoustic guitar, keyboards, vocals\n* David Byrne − guitar on \"Crazy Egypt\"\n* Maureen Tucker − drums on \"Dancing Undercover\" and \"Set Me Free\"\n* Erik Sanko − bass guitar\n* Dawn Buckholz − cello\n* B.
