In 1929, he graduated from the Hopkins medical school and remained there serving in a number of faculty posts. He was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, Alpha Omega Alpha and other professional groups.\nHowe was a member of the United States Navy Reserve during and after World War II, leaving the Reserve in 1953 with the rank of lieutenant commander.\nPolio researcher\nHowe had started the original polio program at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in 1937 and remained as a director of the laboratory when it was transferred to the School of Hygiene and Public Health in 1942. At his retirement in 1959, he was adjunct professor of epidemiology.\nHe and his associates traced the pathways through the body of the polio virus, identified the three types of virus and produced immunity in chimpanzees with inactivated virus.\nIn 1952, he successfully inoculated children at the Rosewood State Hospital, just before the pioneer inoculation programs of Dr. Jonas Salk who used a more refined vaccine that was easier to mass-produce.\nDr. David Bodian, professor of neurobiology and anatomy at the medical school, who for a number of years directed the program with Dr. Howe, described him as \"rigorous\" and using an \"objective approach\" in the laboratory, but as a \"somewhat romantic\" person with cultural and artistic interests who was prized for his personal qualities and was \"quite unlike what people think of as a researcher.\"\nAwards and recognition\n, Charles Armstrong, John R. Paul, Thomas Francis Jr., Albert Sabin, Joseph L. Melnick, Isabel Morgan, Howard A. Howe, David Bodian, Jonas Salk, Eleanor Roosevelt and Basil O'Connor.]]\nIn 1942, Dr. Howe was a winner of the first E. Mead Johnson Award and in 1958 was named to the Polio Hall of Fame of the National Foundation in Warm Springs, Ga. His work had also resulted in a number of awards from local groups including a McCormick Unsung Hero award.\nLater life\nFollowing his retirement from Hopkins as a result of ill health, he continued to do research for the Maryland State Health Department until moving to Warwick, Rhode Island.\nReferences\nFurther reading\nSteven Lehrer.
