Initially, the group was composed of vocalist and keyboardist Matthew Vlahovich, bass guitarist Jacob Palahnuk, and guitarist Robert Aaron Ellingson. After a stint with Fritz Helder and the Phantoms, drummer Taylor Hill joined the line-up in late 2011. In February 2013, the band separated from Robert Aaron Ellingson, citing philosophical differences, and wrote and recorded their only album as a three piece. The band released new music until 2016 and officially disbanded on 1 December 2022.\nHistory\nFormation\nIn August 2009, Aaron Ellingson and Jacob Palahnuk established a nascent connection while playing music with their peers, and the two decided to form a band. Palahnuk later connected with Matthew Vlahovich at a concert of Vlahovich's former band, Turn Off The Stars. At the time, Vlahovich was a solo artist working on a project called GoldenGirls, but decided to join Palahnuk and Ellingson to form Young Empires.\nYoung Empires officially began in October 2009. Vlahovich was offered an opportunity to open for We Have Band at Wrongbar in Toronto as a solo artist. Vlahovich wanted to perform with Young Empires; at the time, the band had only written a few songs and were given approximately two weeks to produce a half-hour set. Since then, Young Empires have released a number of online demos and videos, which were recorded in the band member's bedrooms and rehearsal rooms. They have also created a website in which Palahnuk and Ellingson are the designers of the graphic elements and videos.\nBefore the release of their first EP, the band established a national reputation. Within two years, Young Empires gained a fan base through supporting many different bands and traveling extensively across three continents. After a year of writing and recording, Young Empires prepared for the release of their debut album with single releases of \"So Cruel\" and \"The Gates\".\nEarly sets\nA year after inception, the band took part in the Nem-Catacoa Festival in Bogota, Colombia, which also hosted Green Day and Jamiroquai. Young Empires added to their resume by performing at The Juno Awards on March 25, 2011; at the North-by-Northeast Music and Film Festival (NXNE) on June 17, 2010; and at Toronto's Harbourfront Centre on July 2, 2011. There, in Toronto at the SoundClash Music Awards, the band was awarded 3rd place out of five short-listed finalists.  The Grammy Awards accommodated the band for its 53rd edition at the Canadian Blast Grammy Party.  They hit the stage at New York's CMJ (College Media Journal&thinsp;) music week in October 2011, at South by Southwest (SXSW) in Austin in March 2011,  and The Great Escape Festival in Brighton in May 2011.  Their resume includes stops in Paris, Los Angeles, Stockholm, London, and Montreal.\nYoung Empires has shared the stage with headliners such as Jamiroquai, Chromeo, Foster the People, Dragonette, Japandroids, Girl Talk, Sleigh Bells, Jamaica, and Vampire Weekend.\nWake All My Youth\nAfter two years as an unsigned band, Young Empires chose to sign a deal with Pirates Blend Records.\nTheir debut EP, Wake All My Youth, was released in Canada on January 31, 2012, and internationally on February 21, 2012. The EP contained seven tracks and was released on Pirates Blend with mix production by Al-P of MSTRKRFT and Burke Reid.\n\"Choosing to release Wake All My Youth with Pirates Blend has offered us the best of both worlds. On the one hand we're totally independent and make all of our own decisions; yet, we're immersed in one of the strongest communities in Canadian music,\" said Robert Aaron Ellingson.\nThe Gates and later career\nIn 2015, under the Pirates Blend label, Young Empires released their first and only album The Gates.\nIn November 2023 the band announced the passing of founding member and bass guitarist Jacob “Jake” Palahnuk (born 25 January 1984 – died 28 November 2023) due to a heart-related issue.\nStyle\nYoung Empires' music blends elements of alternative dance, electro, and indie rock. Worldbeat refers to the African and Latin American percussion used in their tracks.  Their sound has been compared to the likes of The Killers, Arcade Fire, Cut Copy, Friendly Fires, and Foals.\nYoung Empires' music has evolved alongside a more ambitious project, a brand called \"The House of Young Empires\" which designs clothing, remixes, videos, and web pages. In collaboration with a Toronto-based fashion line called Handsome Clothing, Young Empires has launched a collection of T-shirts and sweatshirts. The fashion industry featured Young Empires on the Parisian music label Kitsuné Maison 10, Nylon TV fashion video, and in the magazine Dazed & Confused.\nReception\nCommercial reception\nYoung Empires' music has been well received by Canadian radio stations. Their song, \"White Doves\", was voted &nbsp;6 on SiriusXM's \"Top 50 of 2011\" Since the release of Wake All My Youth, the band made an appearance on 102.1 The Edge CFNY on January 30, 2012,  and on The Verge (XM) Online Radio on February 8, 2012. Young Empires was a guest on George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight, which aired on February 17, 2012, on CBC  and on MTV Live. In late January 2012, they toured throughout North America to promote their first recorded efforts, including a stop at the 2012 SXSW in Austin, Texas.\nThey received a highly favorable review of their first 2012 US tour gig at the Mercury Lounge on March 1, 2012, by According 2 G, which stated that \"after their set was over, the crowd refused to accept it and was literally begging for them to play more songs. That's a sight I've rarely seen (and I see hundreds of bands a year!).\"\nSome of their tracks have reached the top spots on iTunes Canada Rock Charts (No.&nbsp;2), while two of their demos have reached the top 15 on The Hype Machine's charts.\nOn May 28, 2012, Young Empires released the world's first Facebook Connect [http://whitedoves.me/ interactive music video] that was featured on [http://www.fastcocreate.com/1680867/your-memories-get-saved-from-the-flames-in-interactive-video-for-young-empires Fast Company] on May 31, 2012.\nYoung Empires have been nominated in three categories of the 2012 CASBY Award: Best New Artist, Best New Single, and Best New Album.\nCritical reception\nThe French rock magazine Les Inrockuptibles wrote online: \"Young Empires' cheeky electro, best anti-crisis remedy [...] These Canadians are fighting against the crisis with their extravagant-coloured pop.\"\nAmong the many reviews, the Toronto NOW in its February issue stated, \"Wake All My Youth is unashamedly earnest, in a way that makes you wish you were sixteen instead of making you cringe with embarrassment.\"  The same magazine noted their performance at the NXNE Festival 2011 was rated in the top ten of over five hundred bands.  The band's EP was also reviewed by the online music blog, When the Gramophone Rings, which gave it an 8/10 rating and stated that the band \"has now delivered an EP on which every song has been layered and arranged with the upmost care, and delivered with the most devastating precision.\"\nNumerous Toronto music critics considered Young Empires to be the breakout Toronto band in 2010, while Entertainment Tonight Canada has referred to them as \"one of the most anticipated acts for 2011.\"\nNME magazine paid the band a significant compliment in their August 2010 issue by comparing Young Empires' sound to bands such as The Killers, Arcade Fire, Yeasayer and Foals. An excerpt from this magazine praised the band as follows: \"...the mathmania of Battles, the gloss'n'grandeur of The Killers, and the calamitous quiver of Arcade Fire... Young Empires have consummately summated this generations' achievements in Rock. Not they're total retread merchants; no, they're master weavers of our disparate indie threads, forging a fine tapestry of future disco.\"\nAppearances\n\"Against the Wall\" has been featured in an online advertising campaign for NYLON TV in October 2011.\n\"Let You Sleep Tonight\" appeared on Ringer in season 1, episode 4.
