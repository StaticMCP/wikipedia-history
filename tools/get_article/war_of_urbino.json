Della Rovere set off with an army of some 5,000 infantry and 1,000 horses which he entrusted to Federico Gonzaga, lord of Bozzolo, reaching the walls of Urbino on 23 January 1517.\nHe defeated the Papal condottiero Francesco del Monte and entered the city hailed by the population.\nPope Leo X reacted by hastily hiring an army of 10,000 troops under Lorenzo II de' Medici, Renzo da Ceri, Giulio Vitelli, and Guido Rangoni and sent it against Urbino. Lorenzo was wounded by a bullet from an arquebus on April 4 during the siege of the Mondolfo castle, and returned to Tuscany. He was replaced by Cardinal Bibbiena. Cardinal Bibbiena, however, was unable to control the troops and suffered a defeat at Monte Imperiale with significant losses. Ultimately, he was forced to retreat to Pesaro.\nThe war was, however, ended by the lack of money of Francesco Maria della Rovere, who soon found himself unable to pay the troops hired at Verona. After some unfruitful ravages in Tuscany and Umbria, he began to seek for a diplomatic settlement with the pope. In September they signed a treaty by which della Rovere was relieved of all ecclesiastical censures and was left free to retreat to Mantua with all his artillery, as well as the rich library collected in Urbino by the former duke Federico III da Montefeltro.\nThe war saw the first appearance of Giovanni dalle Bande Nere on the battlefield.\nReferences\n*"
