It is based on the 1812 story of Schneewittchen by the Brothers Grimm.\nPlot\nOnce upon a time, in deep winter in a kingdom, a young Queen gives birth to a girl, who because of her beauty was named Snow White. The Queen however dies in childbirth. After a year, the King remarries a beautiful but proud and vain woman. The new Queen studies black magic and witchcraft and possesses a Magic Mirror, asking it every day:  \"Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?\" The Magic Mirror would reveal the Queen is the fairest one of all.\nOne day, a Prince from the country visits to see Snow White, who is confined inside the castle grounds by the Queen.  She tells the Hunter to alert him if Snow White is ever in danger and gifts her a necklace.  The Queen was ravaged with jealousy when she witnesses this and learns from her Magic Mirror Snow White's beauty surpasses hers.  As a result, she orders the Hunter to take Snow White deep into the woods and kill her.  But there, he spares Snow White's life, and she flees. Snow White runs through the woods that night and, exhausted, stumbles upon a wooden cottage. She goes inside, helps herself with some food on the table, and falls asleep onto one of the beds.  The owners of the cottage, seven dwarfs, return home from work in the mines and sees Snow White, who awakens and tells them of her life story and her wicked stepmother's plans.  To shield her from the Queen, the Dwarfs let Snow White stay with them in the cottage and she happily agrees to tend to their household needs.\nBack at the castle, the Queen consults her Magic Mirror, who reveals Snow White is alive and living with the seven dwarfs. The Queen, realizing she has been tricked, incarcerates the Hunter, and devises plans to eliminate Snow White herself.  She firsts disguises as a peddler woman selling laces, goes to the cottage and finds Snow White, placing a lace onto her so tight she suffocates.  That plan is foiled after the Dwarfs come home and rescue Snow White.  So, for a second time, the Queen disguises as another peddler woman, selling combs.  She places one laced with poison onto Snow White's head, incapacitating her.  But the Dwarfs find Snow White later and revives her.  Undeterred, the Queen goes to her witchcraft room and devises a potion to turn herself into an old countrywoman and poisons an apple. One of the Queen's servants overhears her devious plan and immediately goes to inform and secretly frees the Hunter, who goes to find the Prince to assist.  Going back to the cottage for a third time, the Queen, after several tries, successfully tricks a hesitant Snow White into taking a bite of the apple, and she collapses onto the floor.  The Dwarfs, sensing danger in the ensuing lightning storm, leaves work early and hurries back to the cottage only to find Snow White lying lifelessly on the floor.  The Queen rushes away into the woods to escape the raging storm but is struck dead by lightning.\nUnable to revive Snow White, the Dwarfs built her a glass coffin and placed her inside, keeping vigil.  The Hunter and the Prince, searching for Snow White, spot the Dwarfs with the coffin.  The Prince pleads with them to let him take Snow White's coffin back with him to his palace, and they agree after seeing his love for her.  While carrying the coffin, one of the Dwarfs trips and the coffin falls to the floor, the jolt dislodging a piece of the poison apple from Snow White's throat, reviving her.  Overjoyed, Snow White and the Prince marry, with the Dwarfs throwing them a spectacular wedding party in the woods and they live happily ever after.\nCast\n* Elke Arendt – Snow White\n* Adele \"Addi\" Adametz – The Evil Queen, Snow White's evil stepmother\n* Niels Clausnitzer – Prince Edelmunt\n* Dietrich Thoms – The Huntsman\n* Renate Eichholz – The Good Queen, Snow White's mother\n* Zita Hitz – Francisca, the Chambermaid\n* Erwin Platzer – The Little Moor\nProduction\nNeuschwanstein Castle, in Bavaria, Germany was used as a film set.\nThe Seven Dwarfs were all played by children from a children's dance group led by Suse Böhm.\nHome media\nIn 2007, Schneewittchen was released on DVD in Germany.
