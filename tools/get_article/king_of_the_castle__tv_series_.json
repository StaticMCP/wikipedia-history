Escaping from a gang of local bullies in a malfunctioning lift, Roland finds himself transported to a strange fantasy environment where people and places are twisted variations of those he sees in his real life.\nKing of the Castle'' was one of HTV's most ambitious productions. HTV spent £300,000 on production (a large sum for a children's programme) and the producers spent nine months auditioning 200 actors to play the part of Roland.\nOriginally, King of the Castle had been intended to air in the children's television slot. However, ITV's Network Planning Committee deemed the programme \"too scary\" for children to watch alone. King of the Castle was delayed for four months. It was eventually broadcast in the \"Sunday teatime slot\", for programmes for parents and children to watch together.\nPhilip Da Costa starred as Roland, while other prominent roles were played by Talfryn Thomas, Fulton Mackay, Milton Johns and Angela Richards.\nEpisode guide\n# TX: 8 May 1977 (17:45) - Roland Wright has just moved into a new block of flats which has a broken lift and a dangerous staircase.

Clarke of the British Kendo Association was brought in to act as fight adviser — for which he received an on-screen credit on the closing titles.\nDVD release\n* The complete series was released by Network DVD exclusively through their online website on 8 June 2009. Since Episode 3 no longer exists in the archives in any broadcast quality format, the version on the DVD release is sourced from an off-air VHS videocassette recording.\nReception\nThe Guinness Book of Classic British TV noted that King of the Castle was one of several prominent ITV telefantasy series for younger viewers in this period (along with The Ghosts of Motley Hall, Sky, Children of the Stones and Raven). ''The Hill and Beyond: Children's Television Drama said about King of the Castle: \"it is clearly a highly intelligent and particularly sinister story...King of the Castle'' is a one of a kind and children's television hasn't seen the like of it since.\"\nNovelisation\nIn 2016, Bob Baker wrote an novelisation of King of the Castle, which was published by Fantom Publishing.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
