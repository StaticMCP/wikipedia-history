Pitcher George Zettlein started all 28 of Chicago's games and led the NA with a 2.73 earned run average.\nNear the end of the season, the team lost its stadiums and equipment when the Great Chicago Fire hit the city. The team was able to finish out the season on the road, but had to drop out of the league while the city attempted to recover. The team would not resurface until 1874.\nRegular season\nCabinet card of the 1871 Chicago White Stockings\nSeason standings\nRecord vs. opponents\nRoster\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"10\" style=\"background-color: #0e3386; color: white; text-align: center;\" | 1871 Chicago White Stockings\n|-\n| colspan=\"10\" style=\"background-color: #EE1422; color: white; text-align: center;\" | Roster\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" | Pitchers\n| width=\"25px\" |\n| valign=\"top\" | Catchers\nInfielders\n| width=\"25px\" |\n| valign=\"top\" | Outfielders\n| width=\"25px\" |\n| valign=\"top\" | Manager\n|-\n|}\nPlayer stats\nBatting\nStarters by position\nNote: Pos = Position; G = Games played; AB = At bats; H = Hits; Avg. = Batting average; HR = Home runs; RBI = Runs batted in\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\";\" width=\"5%\" |\n! style=\";\" width=\"16%\" | Player\n! style=\";\" width=\"9%\" |\n! style=\";\" width=\"9%\" |\n! style=\";\" width=\"9%\" |\n! style=\";\" width=\"9%\" |\n! style=\";\" width=\"9%\" |\n! style=\";\" width=\"9%\" |\n|-\n| C ||  || 28 || 130 || 36 || .277 || 2 || 25\n|-\n| 1B ||  || 26 || 135 || 37 || .274 || 0 || 10\n|-\n| 2B ||  || 28 || 135 || 51 || .378 || 1 || 29\n|-\n| SS ||  || 26 || 121 || 28 || .231 || 0 || 15\n|-\n| 3B ||  || 24 || 95 || 25 || .263 || 1 || 17\n|-\n| OF ||  || 18 || 84 || 22 || .262 || 0 || 13\n|-\n| OF ||  || 25 || 124 || 42 || .339 || 4 || 33\n|-\n| OF ||  || 27 || 129 || 28 || .217 || 0 || 17\n|}\nOther batters\nNote: G = Games played; AB = At bats; H = Hits; Avg. = Batting average; HR = Home runs; RBI = Runs batted in\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\";\" width=\"16%\" | Player\n! style=\";\" width=\"9%\" |\n! style=\";\" width=\"9%\" |\n! style=\";\" width=\"9%\" |\n! style=\";\" width=\"9%\" |\n! style=\";\" width=\"9%\" |\n! style=\";\" width=\"9%\" |\n|-\n| align=left | || 20 || 101 || 21 || .208 || 2 || 16\n|-\n| align=left | || 3 || 14 || 1 || .071 || 0 || 0\n|}\nPitching\nStarting pitchers\nNote: G = Games pitched; IP = Innings pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\";\" width=\"16%\" | Player\n! style=\";\" width=\"9%\" |\n! style=\";\" width=\"9%\" |\n! style=\";\" width=\"9%\" |\n! style=\";\" width=\"9%\" |\n! style=\";\" width=\"9%\" |\n! style=\";\" width=\"9%\" |\n|-\n| align=left | || 28 || 240.2 || 18 || 9 || 2.73 || 22\n|}\nRelief pitchers\nNote: G = Games pitched; IP = Innings pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\";\" width=\"16%\" | Player\n! style=\";\" width=\"9%\" |\n! style=\";\" width=\"9%\" |\n! style=\";\" width=\"9%\" |\n! style=\";\" width=\"9%\" |\n! style=\";\" width=\"9%\" |\n! style=\";\" width=\"9%\" |\n|-\n| align=left | || 3 || 10.1 || 1 || 0 || 3.48 || 0\n|}\nReferences\n*[https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHI/1871.shtml 1871 Chicago White Stockings season at Baseball Reference]"
