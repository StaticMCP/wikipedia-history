They are based on a channel's subscriber count but are offered at the sole discretion of YouTube. Each channel is reviewed before an award is issued to ensure that the channel follows the YouTube community guidelines. YouTube reserves the right to refuse to hand out a Creator Award, which it has done for channels featuring horror or extremist political content.\nAwards\nWhen a YouTube channel reaches a specific milestone and is deemed eligible for a YouTube Creator Reward, they are awarded a relatively flat trophy in a metal casing with a YouTube play button symbol. The trophies are of different sizes: each button and plaque becomes progressively larger with the channel's subscriber count. The Gold Creator Award was introduced at VidCon 2012, alongside the Silver Creator Award at VidCon 2013 and the Diamond Creator Award at VidCon 2015. The Creator Awards are made by the New York firm Society Awards.\nPrior to March 2021, YouTube featured three additional benefit levels. These are not eligible for Creator Rewards, but they do offer several preliminary benefits:\n* Graphite was for channels with 1 to 999 subscribers.\n* Opal was for channels with 1,000 to 9,999 subscribers. This is the minimum subscriber count required for the YouTube Partner Program, which also requires a minimum of 4,000 total viewer watch hours in the past 12 months, plus a manual review of the channel's content to determine compliance with the program guidelines.\n* Bronze was for channels with 10,000 to 99,999 subscribers. The YouTube NextUp program is exclusive to channels meeting this threshold and other program criteria. This is also the minimum subscriber count required for a Spreadshop or Spring (formerly called \"Teespring\") merchandise shelf.\nList of award types\nThere are currently three regular Creator Awards tiers, plus a fourth and fifth that have been awarded a few times:\nSilver Creator Award\nAwarded to the channels that reach or surpass 100,000 subscribers. The old version was made of nickel-plated cupronickel alloy. The new version (as of March 1, 2017) is 92% nickel, 5% carbon and 2.5% zinc, with traces of other metals. In March 2018, the look of the Silver Play Button was updated from a metal button housed within a window box with the channel's name printed on the front glass pane to a cleaner-looking flat designed metal plaque award featuring the channel's name embossed on it. Channels at this level are also eligible to apply for a digital verification badge.\nGold Creator Award\nAwarded to the channels that reach or surpass 1,000,000 subscribers.

The color can vary per creator, however: for example, T-Series received a colorless award, while Blackpink received a black award on top of a pink base. , 90 channels have reached this level, but this playbutton is no longer awarded, although some channels received custom playbuttons for other milestones (e.g. ''America's Got Talent'' for 20 million and MrBeast for 200 million).\nRed Diamond Creator Award\nAwarded to channels that reach or surpass 100 million subscribers.
