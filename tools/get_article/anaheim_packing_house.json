Along with the Packard Building, a renovated 1925 Mission Revival style building, and a farmer's market, it makes up a shopping center called the Anaheim Packing District. The Packing House opened on May 31, 2014, and is located in a renovated 1919 former Sunkist citrus packing house built in Spanish Colonial Revival style. It is one of the few remaining packing houses in Orange County, and the only one in Anaheim. The packing house was added to the National Register of Historic Places as the Anaheim Orange and Lemon Association Packing House in 2015.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://anaheimpackingdistrict.com Anaheim Packing District]"
