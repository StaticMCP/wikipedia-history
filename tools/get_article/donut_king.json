There are now 14 stores in China.\nDonut King is not related to a restaurant with the same name that is located in St. Charles, Missouri, United States, or several other Donut King located across the United States.\nWorld's Largest Doughnut\nOn 5 December 2007, Donut King oversaw construction of the World's Largest Doughnut, in order to celebrate The Simpsons Movie's DVD release. It was created from over 90,000 doughnuts, using half a tonne of pink icing and 30&nbsp;kg of sprinkles from Donut King. Taking 40 people over nine hours to build, the giant doughnut measured six metres and weighed 3.5 tonnes.\nSee also\n* List of doughnut shops\n* List of restaurant chains in Australia\nReferences"
