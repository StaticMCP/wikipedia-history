The film marked Maureen O'Hara's screen debut; she appeared very briefly, speaking one line.\nPlot summary\nMillionaire Bobbie Hawkes is engaged to Flo, a singer and aspiring actress who hopes to move to Hollywood. He becomes concerned when his friend Mark points out that Flo seems mostly interested in Bobbie's money. In an effort to discover whether she is a gold digger, Bobbie pretends to have lost his fortune on the stock market and she ends their engagement.\nDisguised as an ordinary laborer, he befriends a shopgirl named Pepper who performs for customers. He is impressed by Pepper's voice and decides to help her start a singing career. A jealous Flo sabotages Pepper's audition with popular bandleader Bert Ambrose and tricks her into signing a contract with the store owner, Mr. Stoker. However, Bobbie outsmarts Flo by arranging a second audition for Pepper. Undeterred, Flo ruins Pepper's debut performance by painting Bobbie as a villain and plying her with alcohol; in the ensuing chaos, everyone in the club is arrested and brought before a magistrate. The magistrate sentences Flo to seven days in jail for assaulting Mark, ruining her chance of a Hollywood contract. Meanwhile, Pepper and Bobbie are free to go and start their life together.\nCast\n* Bert Ambrose and his orchestra as Themselves\n* Evelyn Dall as Pepper Martin, a singing shopgirl\n* Harry Richman as Harry, a successful vocalist\n* Florence Desmond as Flo Hadley, an ambitious actress\n* Hal Thompson as Bobbie Hawkes, an eccentric millionaire\n* C.
