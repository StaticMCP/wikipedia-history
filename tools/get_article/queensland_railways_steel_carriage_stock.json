Over the years these carriages have been used on many different long distance Queensland Rail services.\nAll Queensland Rail Travel (formerly \"Traveltrain\") services are now operated only with L Series carriages.\nM Series Carriage Stock\n}}\nIn January 1950, Queensland Railways awarded a contract for 99 steel bodied carriages to Commonwealth Engineering, Rocklea. These were purchased to operate the Lander series of trains, The Inlander, The Midlander, The Sunlander and The Westlander entering service between 1953 and 1955.\nThe original order of 99 cars was for:\n*8 x MPC class power generation vans\n*8 x MMV class mail vans\n*14 x MBC class luggage vans\n*6 x MDC class dining cars\n*10 x MAL class first class sitting cars (36 seats)\n*14 x MBL class second class sitting cars (52 seats)\n*3 x MCL class composite sitting cars (18 first-class, 24 second-class seats)\n*15 x MAS class first class sleeping cars (14 berths)\n*15 x MBS class second class sleeping cars (24 berths)\n*6 x MCS class composite sleeping cars (8 first-class, 9 second-class berths)\nIn 2007 as well as 2010, Queensland Rail decided that the 80 remaining M-series carriages would have to be removed from service by December 2013.

In July 2014, tenders were called to reconfigure 11 L series carriages. With The Sunlander withdrawn, this allowed The Inlander, Spirit of the Outback and The Westlander to be converted to L series stock.\nReferences"
