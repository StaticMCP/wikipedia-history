In Division I men's and women's college basketball, the AP Poll is largely just a tool to compare schools throughout the season and spark debate, as it has no bearing on postseason play.\n|Week2-25-Color = npr\n|Week2Dropped  \t=\n|Week3-1   \t= South Carolina (3-0) (21)\n|Week3-1-Color \t= u\n|Week3-2   \t= Notre Dame (4-0) (12)\n|Week3-2-Color \t= u\n|Week3-3   \t= Connecticut

Poll is the second oldest poll still in use after the AP Poll. It is compiled by a rotating group of 32 college Division I head coaches. The Poll operates by Borda count. Each voting member ranks teams from 1 to 25. Each team then receives points for their ranking in reverse order: Number 1 earns 25 points, number 2 earns 24 points, and so forth. The points are then combined and the team with the highest points is then ranked #1; second highest is ranked #2 and so forth. Only the top 25 teams with points are ranked, with teams receiving first place votes noted the quantity next to their name. The maximum points a single team can earn is 800.\n|Week3-1   \t= Notre Dame (5-0) (14)\n|Week3-1-Color \t= u\n|Week3-2   \t= South Carolina (3-0) (14)\n|Week3-2-Color \t= u\n|Week3-3   \t=
