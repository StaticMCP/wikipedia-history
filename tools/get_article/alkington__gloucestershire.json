There is no Alkington village, the parish consists of various hamlets, including Woodford, Newport and Lower Wick.\nThe parish adjoins the Stroud parishes of Ham and Stone to the west; Hamfallow to the north; Stinchcombe to the north-east; North Nibley to the east. The South Gloucestershire parishes of Charfield and Tortworth lie to the south and south-west respectively.\nAlkington was in Thornbury Rural District  until the RDC was abolished in 1974.  The greater part was transferred into the new county of Avon, as part of the new district of Northavon but a group of parishes in the north of the district, around Berkeley, wished not to transfer into the new county, but chose instead to remain with Gloucestershire, under the new Stroud District Council. These were the parishes of Hinton, Hamfallow, Ham and Stone, Alkington, and Berkeley itself.\nWith the demise of Avon, in 1996, Alkington remained with the main county of Gloucestershire.\nEconomy\nThe M5 Michaelwood services are situated in the village.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
