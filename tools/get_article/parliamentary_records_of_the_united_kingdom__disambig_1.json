It was purged by Oliver Cromwell in 1648 and disbanded in 1653. It reconvened in February 1660 only to dissolve itself the following month.\nThe longest Parliament of the United Kingdom was the 37th Parliament elected at the 1935 election. It sat for almost 10 years throughout the Second World War, being dissolved in 1945.\nShortest Parliament\nThe aptly named Short Parliament of England was the shortest parliament to sit in any of the United Kingdom’s constituent countries. It sat for just three weeks from 13 April until 5 May 1640.\nThe shortest Parliament of the United Kingdom was the 3rd Parliament  elected at the 1806 election. It sat for 138 days from 15 December 1806 until 27 April 1807.\nLongest sitting\nThe longest single sitting of the House of Commons lasted from 16:00 on 31 January 1881 to 09:30 on 2 February, a duration of 41.5 hours. The session centred on \"Protection of Person and Property in Ireland\".\nThe longest single sitting of the House of Lords lasted from 11:00 on 10 March 2005 to 19:31 on 11 March 2005, a duration of 32.5 hours (excluding breaks). The sitting centred on consideration of Commons amendments to the Prevention of Terrorism Bill.\nMost divisions\nThe highest number of divisions in a single day in the House of Commons is 64 on 23–24 March 1971, of which 57 occurred between midnight and noon.\nLongest speech\nThe longest continuous speech on record is that of Henry Peter Brougham on 7 February 1828 when he spoke for six hours on law reform. He subsequently set the same record in the House of Lords on 7 October 1831 again speaking for six hours during the second reading of the Reform Act.\nSince stricter standing orders were introduced, the longest back-bench speech was given by Ivan Lawrence on 5–6 March 1985 speaking for 263 minutes against the Water Fluoridation Bill.\nMost votes cast\nThe most votes cast in a single division is 660 in the vote of no confidence (350–310) against the government of the Marquess of Salisbury on 11 August 1892. There were 665 out of 670 Members taking part in the division as each side put up two tellers to count the votes, and the Speaker of the House of Commons remained in the Chair. Two seats were vacant, and only three Members failed to take part, two being ill and one absent in Australia.\nFewest votes cast\nThe fewest votes cast in a single division is one; the vote was on a motion by Labour MP Ronald Brown to adjourn debate on the British Railways Bill, and took place at 01:33 on 24 July 1974.\nThe single vote against Brown's motion was cast by Conservative MP Bernard Braine; Labour MPs Bob Cryer and Phillip Whitehead acted as Tellers for the Ayes, while Conservative MPs Norman Tebbit and Roger Moate acted as Tellers for the Noes. Nobody was recorded as having voted in favour.\nSince a quorum was not present, the question was declared not decided, and the business under consideration stood over until the next sitting of the House.\nReferences\nSee also\n*Parliamentary records"
