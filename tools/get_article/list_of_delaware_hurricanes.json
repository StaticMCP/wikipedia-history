Since reliable records began, no tropical cyclone has struck the state while maintaining hurricane intensity, and only two storms since 1851 caused hurricane-force winds in the state. The state often experiences the direct effects of landfalling North Atlantic tropical cyclones and from the remnants of some Pacific storms, such as rainfall or strong winds, as well as the effects of storms that remain offshore, such as rip currents or heavy surf. Since 1749, at least 111&nbsp;tropical cyclones, some of which had become extratropical, have affected the state, including 21 which passed over the state.\nList of tropical cyclones\nPre-1900\n*October 21, 1749 – A hurricane impacted the Mid-Atlantic, and impacts were observed in Delaware, but it's unclear at what strength the storm was when it impacted the state.\n*Fall, 1783 – Nine large ships crash near Cape Henlopen during a gale, killing several people.\n*September 2, 1785 – A hurricane causes 181&nbsp;deaths in the state.
