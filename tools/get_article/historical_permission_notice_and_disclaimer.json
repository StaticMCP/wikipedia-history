Dodson\n|date = 9 November 2002\n|OSI approved  = Yes\n|Free Software = Yes\n|GPL compatible = Yes\n|copyleft = No\n|linking = Yes\n|website =\n|deprecated = Yes\n}}\nThe Historical Permission Notice and Disclaimer (HPND) is an open source license, approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) and verified as GPL-compatible by the Free Software Foundation.\nCharacteristics\nIt is unique among the OSI's licenses because of the choices it allows in its construction.\nIt lets the licensor pick anywhere from 0-2 warranty disclaimers, whether they want to prohibit the author's name from being used in publicity or advertising surrounding a distribution (like in the BSD License), and other spelling and grammar options.\nBesides this, the license can be almost functionally identical to the new, 3-clause BSD License (if the option for the no-promotion clause is exercised), or the MIT License (if the option for the no-promotion clause is not exercised).\nVariants of this license are in use primarily in older software, including the original BSD kernel. Today, it is most popular to choose either the new 3-clause BSD License or the MIT License to meet the licensing needs of the developer.\nThis is the only OSI-certified license (excluding the public domain) that can lack a disclaimer of warranty.\nThe license was deprecated by its author, Bruce A. Dodson, prior to 24 September 2009.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091025115245/http://geocities.com/brucedodson.rm/hist_pnd.htm Original publication of the license]\n* [https://opensource.org/license/historical-php/ Text of the license on the Open Source Initiative website]"
