Iranian festivals are held throughout the year by the people of Tehran, which can be attractive to tourists.\nThere are several artistic, historic and scientific museums in Tehran, including the National Museum of Iran, and the Carpet Museum. There is also the Museum of Contemporary Art, which hosts works of artists such as Andy Warhol, Pablo Picasso and Van Gogh.\nThere are also numerous websites, news agencies and international media in Tehran.\nArchitecture\nThe oldest surviving architectural monuments of Tehran are from the Qajari and Pahlavi eras. Although, considering the area of Greater Tehran, monuments dating back to the Seljuk era remain as well; notably the Toqrol Tower in Ray. There are also remains of Rashkan Castle, dating back to the ancient Parthian Empire, of which some artifacts are housed at the National Museum; and the Bahram fire temple, which remains since the Sassanian Empire.\nTehran only had a small population until the late 18th century, but began to take a more considerable role in Iranian society after it was chosen as the capital city. Despite the regular occurrence of earthquakes during the Qajar period and after, some historic buildings have remained from that era.\nTehran is Iran's primate city, and is considered to have the most modernized infrastructure in the country. However, the gentrification of old neighborhoods and the demolition of buildings of cultural significance has caused concerns.\nFile:Azadi Tower at night III.jpg|Azadi Tower\nFile:02 hasan abad Sq..jpg|Hasanabad Square\nFile:Tehran City Theater 1.jpg|A view of the building of the City Theater of Tehran\nFile:Ministerstv spravedlnosti 1.jpg|The Courthouse of Tehran\nFile:Iranian Foreign Affaire Ministry.jpg|Police House,the National Garden\nin February 2010]]\nPreviously a low-rise city due to seismic activity in the region, modern high rise developments in Tehran have been built in recent decades in order to service its growing population. There have been no major quakes in Tehran since 1830.\nTehran's International Tower is the tallest residential building in Iran. It is a 54-story building located in the northern district of Yusef Abad.\nThe Azadi Tower, a memorial built under the reign of the Pahlavi dynasty, has long been the most famous symbol of Tehran. Originally constructed in commemoration of the 2,500th year of the foundation of the Imperial State of Iran, it combines elements of the architecture of the Achaemenid and Sassanid eras with post-classical Iranian architecture. The Milad Tower, which is the sixth tallest tower and the 24th-tallest freestanding structure in the world, is the city's other famous landmark tower. Leila Araghian's Tabiat Bridge, the largest pedestrian overpass in Tehran, was completed in 2014 and is also considered a landmark.\nTheater\n, Tehran]]\nUnder the reign of the Qajars, Tehran was home to the royal theater of Tekye Dowlat, located to the southeast of the Golestan Palace, in which traditional and religious performances were observed. It was eventually destroyed and replaced with a bank building in 1947, following the reforms under the reign of Reza Shah.\nBefore the 1979 Revolution, the Iranian national stage had become the most famous performing scene for known international artists and troupes in the Middle East, with the Roudaki Hall of Tehran constructed to function as the national stage for opera and ballet. The hall was inaugurated in October 1967, named after prominent Persian poet Rudaki. It is home to the Tehran Symphony Orchestra, the Tehran Opera Orchestra, and the Iranian National Ballet Company.\nThe City Theater of Tehran, one of Iran's biggest theater complexes which contains several performance halls, was opened in 1972. It was built at the initiative and presidency of empress Farah Pahlavi, and was designed by architect Ali Sardar Afkhami, constructed within five years.\nThe annual events of Fajr Theater Festival and Tehran Puppet Theater Festival take place in Tehran.\nCinema\nhouses Iran's Cinema Museum.]]\nThe first movie theater of Tehran was established by Mirza Sahhafbashi in 1904. Until the early 1930s, there were 15 theaters in Tehran Province and 11 in other provinces.\nIn present-day Tehran, most of the movie theaters are located downtown. The complexes of Kourosh Cinema, Mellat Gallery and Cineplex, Azadi Cinema, and Cinema Farhang are among the most popular cinema complexes in Tehran.\nSeveral film festivals are held in Tehran, including Fajr Film Festival, Children and Youth Film Festival, House of Cinema Festival, Mobile Film and Photo Festival, Nahal Festival, Roshd Film Festival, Tehran Animation Festival, Tehran Short Film Festival, and Urban Film Festival.\nMusic\nperforming in 1969]]\nTehran is also one of the most important cities in Asia for the recorded music industry. Tehran is home to two professional orchestras, including the Tehran Symphony Orchestra and Iran's National Orchestra. There are also several concert halls in the city. Many popular singers started their work in Tehran, including Dariush, Ebi, Leila Forouhar, Googoosh, Hayedeh and Mahasti.\nMuseums and galleries\nThere are several artistic, historic and scientific museums in Tehran, including the National Museum of Iran, and the Carpet Museum. There is also the Museum of Contemporary Art, which hosts works of artists such as Andy Warhol, Pablo Picasso and Van Gogh.

It is also the world's nearest ski resort to a capital city. The resort was opened in 1976, shortly before the 1979 Revolution. It is equipped with an  gondola lift that covers a huge vertical distance. There are two parallel chair ski lifts in Tochal that reach  high near Tochal's peak (at ), rising higher than the gondola's 7th station, which is higher than any of the European ski resorts. From the Tochal peak, there are views of the Alborz range, including the  Mount Damavand, a dormant volcano.\nTehran is the site of the national stadium of Azadi, the biggest stadium by capacity in West Asia, where many of the top matches of Iran's Premier League are held. The stadium is a part of the Azadi Sport Complex, which was originally built to host the 7th Asian Games in September 1974. This was the first time the Asian Games were hosted in West Asia. Tehran played host to 3,010 athletes from 25 countries/NOCs, which was at the time the highest number of participants since the inception of the Games. That followed hosting the 6th AFC Asian Cup in June 1976, and then the first West Asian Games in November 1997. The success of the games led to the creation of the West Asian Games Federation (WAGF), and the intention of hosting the games every two years. The city had also hosted the final of the 1968 AFC Asian Cup. Several FIVB Volleyball World League courses have also been hosted in Tehran.\nFile:نمایی از ورزشگاه ۱۲ هزار نفری.JPG|Azadi Indoor Stadium\nFile:Azadi automobile Circuit 6.jpg|Azadi automobile Circuit\nFile:Azadi Motorcylce Circuit 2019-08-10 05.jpg|Azadi motorcycle circuit\nFile:2014 Iran national track cycling championships-13.jpg|Azadi Velodrome\nFile:شقایق در حال انجام تمرینات تناسب اندام.jpg|An Iranian woman doing physical exercise in a gym in Tehran\nFile:Streetball in Tehran Ab-o-Atash Park 004.jpg|Streetball in Ab-o-Atash Park\nFile:Dizin, Iran.jpeg|Dizin, Iran's largest ski resort, is located near Tehran.\nFootball\n, a football match between Esteghlal and Persepolis.
