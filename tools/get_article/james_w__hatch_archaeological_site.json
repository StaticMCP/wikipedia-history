Hatch Archeological Site (36CE0544) is an archaeological site in Centre County, Pennsylvania, United States.\nHistory\nThe nearby Tudek Site, a jasper quarry, was initially recorded in the 1970s during regional surveys conducted by Penn State University and led by professor James W. Hatch. In 2015, PennDOT initiated archaeological surveys in advance of a bike trail project along Puddintown Road in College Township. Phase I and Phase II surveys met criteria to establish a Trinomial Site Number and led to its official naming after James Hatch. In May of 2017, the PennDOT Highway Archaeological Survey Team (PHAST) and Juniata College conducted an excavation which revealed thousands of stone artifacts—mostly debitage—but also stone tools and two hammerstones. Because of its relation to the Tudek Quarry, the James Hatch site was eligible for a National Register of Historic Places designation.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Schindler, D., et al.  \"Aboriginal Thermal Alteration of a Central Pennsylvania Jasper: Analytical and Behavioral Implications.\"  American Antiquity, 1980.\n*-----.  \"The Heat Treating of Jasper: Analytical and Behaviour Implications.\"  American Antiquity, 1981."
