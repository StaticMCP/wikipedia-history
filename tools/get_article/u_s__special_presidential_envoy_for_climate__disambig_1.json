The special envoy was a member of the principals committee of the National Security Council, reporting directly to the president.\nIn April 2025, under Donald Trump's second administration, U.S. secretary of state Marco Rubio announced that the position had been abolished.\nHistory\nThere had been previous climate policy advisors in the White House fulfilling similar roles. Carol Browner was director of the now-defunct White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy from 2009 to 2011. Barack Obama had appointed Todd Stern to the role of special envoy for climate change in 2009. Stern later served as US chief negotiator for the Paris Agreement. Following Stern's departure in mid-2016, Jonathan Pershing took over as US climate envoy until the end of the administration.\nIn November 2020, President-elect Joe Biden announced former secretary of state John Kerry would serve in a newly created role as the first special presidential envoy for climate. This new position made him a member of the United States National Security Council (NSC). It was the first time that the NSC would have an official dedicated to climate change issues and to addressing the climate crisis as one affecting national security.\nThe term \"climate czar\" was used informally to describe Kerry's position.\nOn January 13, 2024, sources close to Kerry revealed that he would leave this position by the upcoming spring. Later that month, it was announced that John Podesta would succeed John Kerry as envoy.\nSince Trump's second inauguration in January 2025, the position has been left vacant.\nForeign visits\n*April 2021: Envoy John Kerry became the first senior official of the Biden administration to visit China.
