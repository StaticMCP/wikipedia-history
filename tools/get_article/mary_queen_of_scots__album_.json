The title track was featured as a B-side to the non-LP single \"Caesar's Vein\", with \"Easter Bunny\" being released as the follow-up single. The track \"Blue Above the Rooftops\" was released as a single to support the album in 1994. The track \"Home Sick\" is only featured on the American release of the album and elsewhere was used as a B-side. The B-side \"Green Bed\" from the \"Caesar's Vein\" EP also likely comes from the album sessions.\nCritical reception\nDave Thompson, in Alternative Rock, called the album \"stronger, more focussed, certainly brighter and cleaner\" than the debut.\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Eugene Kelly.\n# \"Pebble/Shoe\" - 3:23\n# \"On the Breeze\" - 3:15\n# \"Blue Above the Rooftops\" - 3:00\n# \"The Moon's a Balloon\" - 4:53\n# \"Mary Queen of Scots\" - 4:59\n# \"Easter Bunny\" - 5:27\n# \"Let's Hibernate\" - 3:40\n# \"Friendly High\" - 4:48\n# \"River Clyde Song\" - 3:10\n# \"Tongue Rock\" - 2:38\n# \"Home Sick\" (extra track on US Edition) - 4:34\n# \"Fake Digit\" - 4:17\n# \"Love, Bread and Beers\" - 3:07\nPersonnel\n*Eugene Kelly - vocals, guitar\n*Gordon Keen - guitar\n*Raymond Boyle - bass\n*Roy Lawrence - drums\n*Cassell Webb - additional keyboards and backing vocals\nReferences"
