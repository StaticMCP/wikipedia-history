He is a Bram Stoker award nominee for his story “Mr. Torso”, and his short stories have appeared in over a dozen mass-market anthologies, including the award-winning “999”. Several of his novels have sold translation rights to Germany, Greece, Romania, and Poland. He also publishes quite actively in the small-press/limited-edition hardcover market; many of his books in this category have become collector's items.\nLife and career\nLee is particularly known for over-the-top occult concepts and an accelerated treatment of erotic and/or morbid sexual imagery and visceral violence.  He was born on May 25, 1957, in Washington, D.C., and grew up in Bowie, Maryland.  In the late 70s he served in the U.S. Army's 1st Armored Division, in Erlangen, West Germany, then, for a short time, was a municipal police officer in Cottage City, Maryland.  Lee also attended the University of Maryland as an English major but quit in his last semester to pursue his dream of being a horror novelist.  For over 15 years, he worked as the night manager for a security company in Annapolis, Maryland, while writing in his spare time.  In 1997, however, he became a full-time writer, first spending several years in Seattle and then moving to Largo, Florida, where he currently resides.\nLee cites as his strongest influence horror legend H. P. Lovecraft; in 2007, Lee embarked on what he calls his “Lovecraft kick” and wrote a spate of novels and novellas which tribute Lovecraft and his famous Cthulhu Mythos.  Among these projects are Trolley No. 1852, Pages Torn From A Travel Journal, Haunter Of The Threshold, The Innswich Horror, ''Lucifer's Lottery, and The Dunwich Romance.\nBibliography\nNovels and Novellas\n* Night Bait (1982) (written under the pseudonym Philip Straker)\n* Night Lust (1982) (written under the pseudonym Philip Straker)\n* Ghouls (1988)\n* Coven (1991)\n* Incubi (1991)\n* Succubi (1992)\n* The Chosen (1993)\n* Creekers (1994)\n* Mr. Torso (1994)\n* Sacrifice (1995) (written under the pseudonym Richard Kinion)\n* Header (1995)\n* Goon (1996) with John Pelan\n* The Bighead (1997)\n* Shifters (1998) with John Pelan\n* Portrait of the Psychopath as a Young Woman (1998) with Elizabeth Steffen\n* Splatterspunk: The Micah Hays Stories (1998) with John Pelan\n* Masks (1999)\n* Operator B (1999)\n* Dahmer’s Not Dead with Elizabeth Steffen (1999)\n* The Stickmen (1999)\n* The Deaths of the Cold War Kings: The Assassinations of Diem & JFK'' with Bradley O'Leary (2000)\n* City Infernal (2001): Cemetery Dance Publications.\n* Sex, Drugs and Power Tools (2002)\n* Family Tradition (2002) with John Pelan\n* Monstrosity (2002): Cemetery Dance Publications.\n* Ever Nat (2003)\n* The Baby (2003)\n* Teratologist (2003) with Wrath James White\n* Incubi (2003): Necro Publications.\n* Infernal Angel (2003): Cemetery Dance Publications.
