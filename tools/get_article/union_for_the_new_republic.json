They won 233 seats out of 482, slightly less than an absolute majority. 35 Independent Republicans boosted their support.\nIn 1967, UNR candidates ran under the title Union of Democrats for the Fifth Republic (Union des démocrates pour la Ve République, UD-Ve), winning 200 out of 486 seats.\nThe UNR was renamed Union for the Defense of the Republic in 1967, and later Union of Democrats for the Republic in 1971.\nSecretaries General of the UNR\n* Roger Frey, 1958–1959\n* Albin Chalandon, 1959\n* Jacques Richard, 1959–1961\n* Roger Dusseaulx, 1961–1962\n* Louis Terrenoire, 1962\n* Jacques Baumel, 1962–1967\n* Robert Poujade, 1967–1969\nUNR in the Senate\nUnder the Fifth Republic, 39 senators were affiliated to the UNR Group and 11 of them were Muslims or with Muslim origins.\n* First Senate election – 37 seats; 12.0%\n* Second Senate election – 32 seats; 11.7%\n* Third Senate election – 30 seats; 10.9%\nMaurice Bayrou was the leader of the group in the Senate from October 1962 to October 1965.\nElection results\nPresidential\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n|+President of the French Republic\n!rowspan=2|Election\n!rowspan=2|Candidate\n!colspan=2|First round\n!colspan=2|Second round\n!rowspan=2|Result\n|-\n!Votes\n!%\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n! 1958\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Charles de Gaulle\n| 62,394\n| 78.51%\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! 1965\n| 10,828,521\n| 44.65%\n| 13,083,699\n| 55.20%\n|\n|}\nNational Assembly\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ National Assembly\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Election year\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Leader\n! colspan=\"2\" |First round\n! colspan=\"2\" |Second round\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Seats\n! rowspan=\"2\" |+/−\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Rank\n(seats)\n|-\n!Votes\n!%\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n!1958\n|Charles de Gaulle\n|3,603,958\n|17.6\n|4,769,052\n|26.4\n|}}\n|–\n|1st\n|-\n!1962\n|Georges Pompidou\n|5,855,744\n|31.9\n|6,169,890\n|40.5\n|}}\n|44\n|1st\n|}\nSee also\n* Gaullist Party\nReferences"
