It was usually associated with the Pan-Green Coalition and supported Taiwan independence.\nHistory\nDisappointed by the Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) gradual moderation of its support of Taiwan independence, some DPP members, many connected to Peng Ming-min's \"Nation Building Association\", formed the Taiwan Independence Party in 1996. However, the party has failed to win large-scale support, due to the lack of organizational skills and internal disagreements. It was largely displaced as Taiwan's ideological independence party by the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU). The Ministry of Interior removed its entry from the registry of parties on 29 April 2020.\nElection results\nLegislative elections\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Election\n! Total seats won\n!
