The trail links Douglas to Peel. Sections were relaid in 2019 and 2020.\nIn August 2020, the Isle of Man Government, published plans to add a spur from St John's on the heritage trail to Kirk Michael. By 2022, this project was in doubt due to budget overruns.\nRepairs to the trail have been carried out in 2023.\nThe trail has been the basis of a racing series since 2024.\nOther rail-trails on the island include a section in Ramsey.\nReferences\nExternal links"
