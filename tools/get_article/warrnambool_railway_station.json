It serves the city of Warrnambool, in Victoria, Australia. Warrnambool station is a ground level premium station, featuring one side platform. It opened on 4 February 1890.\nIt is the southernmost passenger railway station on the Australian mainland that is still in use today. Some lines during the Victorian Railways era, such as the Timboon and Crowes lines, did venture further south however none are in existence today.\nBeyond the station, the line continues for a further five kilometres to Dennington, and is used by freight trains.\nHistory\nOn 26 April 1988, that section officially changed to being worked as a siding, and the train staff previously used for train movements between Warrnambool and Dennington was abolished. Beyond Dennington, the line used to continue for a further 37 kilometres to Port Fairy. That section was closed in November 1977.\nOn 14 July 2008, the siding serving the freight shed at the eastern (up) end of the station was booked out of use, and the track was removed. The goods shed itself was demolished in August 2018, due to its poor structural condition.\nAs part of the Regional Rail Revival project, passenger services on the line are set to increase to five per weekday from 2022, after upgrade works along the line are completed and the commissioning of a passing lane at Boorcan, located between Camperdown and Terang stations. As part of this project, stabling facilities are also to be upgraded at Warrnambool, to allow VLocity trains to stable.\nAnnounced as part of a $21.9 million package in the 2022/23 Victorian State Budget, Warrnambool Station, alongside others, will receive accessibility upgrades, the installation of CCTV and platform shelters. The development process will begin in late 2022 or 2023, with a timeline for the upgrades to be released once construction has begun.\nPlatforms and services\nWarrnambool has one platform. It is serviced by V/Line Warrnambool line services.\n{| class=\"wikitable defaultcenter col1left\"\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#;background-image: linear-gradient(to right, #); \" |Warrnambool platform arrangement\n|-\n!Platform\n!Line\n!Destination\n!Service Type\n!Notes\n|-\n|1\n||white}}\n|Southern Cross\n|All stations and limited express services\n|\n|}\nTransport links\nTransit South West operates three routes via Warrnambool station, under contract to Public Transport Victoria:\n*: Warrnambool – Dennington\n*: to Warrnambool (loop service via Lake Pertobe)\n*: Warrnambool – Merrivale\nV/Line operates contracted road coach services from Warrnambool station to:\n* Geelong station (via the Great Ocean Road)\n* Ballarat station (via Ararat and Hamilton)\n* Mount Gambier station (via Koroit, Port Fairy and Portland)\nGallery\nFile:Warrnambool station building.jpg|Station building and entrance, September 2008\nFile:Tracks at Warrnambool Railway Station, Warrnambool.jpg|The train tracks at Warrnambool station, September 2023\nFile:Old signalling equipment on platform at Warrnambool Railway Station, Warrnambool.jpg|The old signalling equipment at the end of the station platform, September 2023\nFile:N458 at Warrnambool Station.jpg|N Class locomotive N458 couples to carriages at Warrnambool.\nReferences"
