In 1955 it was translated into English by Christopher Fry with the title Tiger at the Gates. The play has two acts and follows the convention of the classical unities.\nWithin the framework of the Iliadic myth of the Trojan War, Giraudoux criticizes diplomacy and the behaviour of the national leaders and intellectuals who brought about World War I and the lead-up to World War II.\nPlot summary\nThe play takes place the day before the outbreak of the Trojan War inside the gates of the city of Troy. It follows the struggle of the disillusioned Trojan military commander Hector, supported by the women of Troy, as he tries to avoid war with the Greeks. Hector's wife Andromache is pregnant, and this reinforces his desire for peace. Along with his worldly-wise mother Hecuba, Hector leads the anti-war argument and tries to persuade his brother Paris to return Paris's beautiful but vapid captive Helen to Greece. Giraudoux presents Helen as not only an object of desire, but the epitome of destiny itself. She claims that she can see the future by seeing what is coloured in her mind, and she sees war. For Hector, Helen means only war and destruction. But for the other Trojan men, led by the poet Demokos, she represents an opportunity for glory; and they are eager to have others fight a war in her name. The peace agreement Hector negotiates with the visiting Greek commander Ulysses, is no match for Demokos' deliberate lies, and at the end of the play, the seer Cassandra's cynical prediction that war cannot be avoided has been proven right.\nOriginal productions\n''La guerre de Troie n'aura pas lieu was first performed on 21 November 1935 in Paris at the Théâtre de l'Athénée in a production by Louis Jouvet with Jouvet as Hector, and the role of Helen played by Madeleine Ozeray. The music was by Maurice Jaubert (op. 52).\nAn early adaptation was presented in English under the title No War with Troy, with Philip Merivale and Edith Atwater in May, 1939, at the Ann Arbor Theatre Festival.\nThe translation by Christopher Fry was first presented on 3 October 1955 in New York City by the Playwrights' Company with a British cast starring Michael Redgrave as Hector, Diane Cilento as Helen, Leueen MacGrath as Cassandra, and Barbara Jefford as Andromache.\nIn 1956 this production was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Play.  Michael Redgrave was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play, and Diane Cilento (Helen) was nominated for Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play. It also won the New York Drama Critics Circle award for Best Foreign Play.\nIn 1957 David Sarvis directed The San Francisco Actor's Workshop production of Tiger at the Gates.\nTiger at the Gates became an episode of \"Play of the Week\" in the US, going out on February 8 (Season 1, Episode 18), and, unrelated, was later that same year also an \"ITV Play of the Week\" in Britain, adapted by William Bast and airing 25 October (Season 6, Episode 8).\nRobert Redford appeared in \"Tiger at the Gates\" during the 1959 season of the Bucks County Playhouse, in New Hope, Pennsylvania.
