It lists over 1,100 names in 11 columns, with carved marble pilasters to either side, surmounted by a segmental pediment housing the arms of the Great Eastern Railway. An inscription at the top reads: \"To the glory of God and in grateful memory of the / Great Eastern Railway staff who in response to the call of their / King and Country, sacrificed their lives during the Great War\".\nThe memorial was originally located in the station's booking hall. It was unveiled on 22 June 1922 by Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson and dedicated by the Bishop of Norwich. A few hours later, Wilson was shot and killed on his own doorstep in Eaton Place, Belgravia, by members of the Irish Republican Army as he returned home from unveiling the memorial.\nIt was relocated in  when the station was renovated, and moved to a site above the main station concourse, near the entrance from Liverpool Street. An inscription reading \"Great Eastern Railway\", removed from the nearby Harwich House when it was demolished as part of the renovations, was installed above the relocated memorial. Also relocated to the wall below the large war memorial are smaller memorials to Wilson and to Captain Charles Fryatt, an officer of the Great Eastern Railway's marine service who was executed by the Germans in 1916 after being convicted at a court martial as a franc-tireur.\nSee also\n*Great Western Railway War Memorial, at Paddington station (to the west)\n*London, Brighton and South Coast Railway War Memorial, at London Bridge station (to the south east)\n*North Eastern Railway War Memorial, in York\n*Midland Railway War Memorial, in Derby\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.londonremembers.com/memorials/ww1-at-liverpool-street-station Monument: WW1 at Liverpool Street Station]\n* [http://www.iwm.org.uk/memorials/item/memorial/11787 Imperial War Museum]"
