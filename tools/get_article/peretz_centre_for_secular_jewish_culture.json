This includes valuing the 2SLGBTQI+ community as well as welcoming interfaith and intercultural members.\nWith roots including the Jewish Bund, the Peretz remains committed to social justice and diversity. Though as a cultural organization it doesn't take a position on Israeli, Canadian or world politics, it is associated with Vancouver's Jewish left community.\nHistory\nThe Vancouver Peretz Institute, also known as the Vancouver Peretz Shule, was incorporated in 1945 with the intention of opening that September in a converted house at 1190 West 15th Ave. Initially operating within the basement of the Jewish Community Centre, by 1947 they had purchased a building of their own on West Broadway between Alder St and Birch St. Its creation was motivated by a post-Holocaust, desire to expand Jewish education to members of the secular community with a particular focus on Yiddish and traditional culture. The Centre was named after Isaac Leib Peretz, due to his significance to Yiddish culture and for his progressive writings.\nBeginning in 1952, the leftist views of the school led to conflict with the more conservative mainstream Jewish culture in Vancouver. The school was accused of communist affiliations with many believing that its secular model of teaching promoted anti-religiousness, which was thought to be an important component of communism. As a result, the school was denied the ability to participate in the communities United Jewish Appeal and therefore denied funding. They were also accused of being anti-Zionist, again due to individuals associating secularism with being anti-religion. In response to the increased scrutiny, the school sought to satisfy all sides. They would celebrate the birthday of the state of Israel, support peace movements that criticized Israeli policy, all while maintaining a strictly apolitical curriculum.\nConstruction began in 1961 on a new site for the school on Ash St between 45th Ave and 46th Ave. Costing $175,000 the one story building would include classrooms, an auditorium, and kitchen. The building opened the following year. At its peak in the 1959–1960 term, the school taught 118 children, but by 1971 its enrolment had dropped to below 50.\nIn 2001, a new building was constructed at the same location, and the name was changed to the \"Peretz Centre for Secular Jewish Culture\".\nIn 2021, the Vancouver Public Library Oakridge Branch temporarily moved into the first floor of the Peretz Centre for the duration of the Oakridge Mall redevelopment.\nPrograms\nSince 1990, the Peretz Centre has run a two-year bnei mitzvah program which is a secular coming-of-age ceremony for youth. This is done through learning about the importance of volunteering in your wider community, researching Jewish culture and understanding its issues, as well as developing an appreciation for Jewish knowledge and humour.\nThe Centre also hosts the Vancouver Jewish Folk Choir, which performs Jewish songs in Yiddish, Hebrew, Ladino, and English.\nIn addition, the Peretz Centre has Yiddish classes, Sholem Aleichem Speakers Series (SASS), Exploring Jewish Writers (EJW), and regularly hosts secular humanist versions of Jewish holidays.\nIt is also home to the Jewish Museum & Archives of British Columbia and the Vancouver Jewish Film Festival.\nThe Paulina and Shaya Kirman Library\nThe Peretz Centre houses the largest Yiddish language library in Western Canada, consisting of nearly 4000 volumes of books and journals. The library grew out of the existing collection of the Peretz School and expanded through donations of material from community members as well as institutions such as the University of British Columbia. They also received the collections of the Calgary Peretz school upon its closure and material from the United Jewish People's Order Toronto Branch. The library is a member of the Yiddish Book Center and has been a member of YIVO. In 2001, following the construction of the new Peretz Centre, the library was given its own designated space on the main floor and renamed for its founding librarians Paulina and Shaya Kirman.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://peretz-centre.org/ Official website]\n*"
