He was educated at Exeter College, Oxford, matriculating in 1575. His father was executed for murder in 1557. He succeeded his brother John in 1588.\nHe made no secret of his adherence to Roman Catholicism.\nHe was a close friend of Robert Catesby and Catesby's recruitment of Francis Tresham to the Gunpowder Plot took place in Stourton's house in Clerkenwell.

In 1608 he was transferred to the Fleet Prison and was fined £6,000, although he paid only £1,000. He may subsequently have occasionally attended Church of England services, but continued to house Catholic priests.\nHe died on 7 May 1633 and was buried at  Stourton, Wiltshire.\nFamily\nHe married his cousin, Frances Tresham, daughter of Sir Thomas Tresham and Muriel Throckmorton.
