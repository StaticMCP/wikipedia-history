Crawford Fantasy Award (short: Crawford Award) is a literary award given to a writer whose first fantasy book was published during the preceding calendar year. It's one of several awards presented by the International Association for the Fantastic in the Arts (IAFA) and is presented at the International Conference of the Fantast in the Arts each March in Orlando.\nIn order to be eligible, a title must be the author’s first fantasy book; it is permissible for an author active in different genres to be submitted, so long as it is their first fantasy book. In addition to novels and novellas, collections of poetry, short stories, and fiction aimed at younger readers are all eligible.\nThe Prize was conceived and established with the help of Andre Norton, who continued to sponsor it for many years. The award is named after the publisher and editor William L. Crawford (1911-1984).  It was administered by noted Locus reviewer, Gary K. Wolfe from 1985 to 2023. The current administrator is critic Farah Mendlesohn.\nCrawford honorees have gone on to win a dozen World Fantasy Awards (including a Life Achievement Award for Charles de Lint), five Shirley Jackson Awards, five Locus Awards, four Hugo Awards, four Nebula Awards, and 27 other awards of various kinds. Two Crawford-winning novels have been adapted as feature films, Chitra Bannerjee Divakaruni’s Mistress of Spices in 2005 and Christopher Barzak’s One for Sorrow in 2014 (under the title Jamie Marks is Dead).  While the majority of honorees have been residents of the United States, the international dimension of the award is reflected by winners from Canada, the U.K., Sweden, Barbados, India, Australia, New Zealand, and Malaysia.\nList of recipients\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Recipient\n!Title of Book\n!Ref\n|-\n!1985\n|Charles de Lint\n|Moonheart\n|\n|-\n!1986\n|Nancy Willard\n|Things Invisible to See\n|\n|-\n!1987\n|Judith Tarr\n|The Hound and the Falcon trilogy\n|\n|-\n!1988\n|Elizabeth Marshall Thomas\n|Reindeer Moon\n|\n|-\n!1989\n|Michaela Roessner\n|Walkabout Woman\n|\n|-\n!1990\n|Jeanne Larsen\n|The Silk Road\n|\n|-\n!1991\n|Michael Scott Rohan\n|Winter of the World trilogy\n|\n|-\n!1992\n|Greer Gilman\n|Moonwise\n|\n|-\n!1993\n|Susan Palwick\n|Flying in Place\n|\n|-\n!1994\n|Judith Katz\n|Running Fiercely Toward a High Thin Sound\n|\n|-\n!1995\n|Jonathan Lethem\n|Gun, With Occasional Music\n|\n|-\n!1996\n|Sharon Shinn\n|Archangel\n|\n|-\n!1997\n|Candas Jane Dorsey\n|Black Wine\n|\n|-\n!1998\n|Chitra Bannerjee Divakaruni\n|Mistress of Spices\n|\n|-\n!1999\n|David B.
