Each battle buddy is expected to assist their partner both in and out of combat. A battle buddy is not only intended for company, but also for the reduction of suicide; since each watches their partner's actions, a battle buddy can save their fellow soldier's life by noticing negative thoughts and feelings and intervening to provide help. Most participating soldiers have reported satisfaction and have agreed that the Army should implement the system fully, although there have been cons reported as well.\nAdvantages and disadvantages\nEvaluations of the battle buddy system have identified the following advantages:Allen, Reginald E. \"Command Battle Buddy Program.\" Army.

In 2006, the suicide rate in the U.S. Army increased by 37% and, by 2009, there were 344 completed suicides by military personnel (211 of whom were members of the Army). In response, efforts to identify suicide prevention initiatives have increased; military and legislative officials found the assignment of battle buddies to be an effective method of decreasing military suicide rates.Duckworth, Tammy. \"Mental Health in the Army.\" All Psychology Careers | The Psychology Career and Education Center. 2011.
