It is presented by MTV for \"outstanding contributions\" and \"profound impact\" on music videos and popular culture. As the ceremony's special category, the trophy is a gold-plated \"moonman\" rather than the silver ones of the other VMA categories. The Beatles and director Richard Lester were honored with the Video Vanguard Award at the inaugural VMAs for \"essentially inventing the music video.\" David Bowie also received the award at the same ceremony. Two years later, Madonna became the first female recipient. In 1991, the award was renamed after Michael Jackson, who had previously won the 1988 trophy. Beginning in 2023, Toyota sponsors the category through a partnership with Paramount Global, resulting in the award being presented as the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award Presented by Toyota.\nIt was presented as the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2003 VMAs to Duran Duran, and in 2006 as the Video Vanguard Award to director Hype Williams. Following Jackson's death, the award returned with his name restored in 2011. According to MTV, his name was attached to the award due to \"Jackson's groundbreaking work as a video artist\". This naming again caused controversy after the release of Leaving Neverland (2019), a documentary about alleged child sexual abuse by Jackson. As in previous ceremonies, MTV did not explicitly display Jackson's name on the television broadcast of the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards, although its website MTV.com still called it Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. The year's recipient, Missy Elliott, did mention Jackson in her speech, as did Nicki Minaj in her 2022 speech. Mariah Carey is the most recent recipient of the award at the 2025 MTV Video Music Awards.\nSince its inception, the Video Vanguard Award has been awarded to 35 acts, with most of them being of American or British origin, except Russell Mulcahy (1985, Australian), Zbigniew Rybczyński (1986, Polish), U2 (2001, Irish), Rihanna (2016, Barbadian), Nicki Minaj (2022, Trinidadian), and Shakira (2023, Colombian). Out of all the winners, nine acts have also won the VMAs' biggest prize, Video of the Year, including Peter Gabriel and Justin Timberlake, who both earned the two awards in the same night. Since 2013, recipients have been invited to perform a medley of songs leading up to their acceptance speech.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|+Key\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FAEB86\"| *\n| Indicates Video of the Year winners\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Image\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:150px;\"| Recipient\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:125px;\"| Nationality\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Notes\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" scope=\"row\"|\n|\n|\n| United Kingdom\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Presented by the Police members Andy Summers and Stewart Copeland.
