Archaeologists defined the culture based on the Plum Bayou Mounds site, previously known as Toltec Mounds, and named it for a local waterway.\nRelationship to other cultures\nThe Baytown culture (300 to 650 CE) preceded the Plum Bayou culture, and was then followed by early Mississippian cultures, which flourished from 900—1600 CE, until diseases brought by Europeans decimated their populations.\nThe Plum Bayou culture had contact with the Coles Creek culture, located along the Mississippi River, and early Caddoan cultures, located in river valleys of the Red, Ouachita, and Arkansas Rivers in Arkansas and into Oklahoma.\nExotic materials found at Plum Bayou sites reveal trade with the Ozark Plateau, West Gulf Coastal Plain, and the Ouachita Mountains.\nMajor Plum Bayou sites with single or multiple mounds include:\n*Baytown Site\n*Chandler Landing Site, Prairie County\n*Coy Site\n*Dogtown Site\n*Hayes Site\n*Maberry Site, Woodruff County\n*Roland Site\n*Toltec Mounds\nSettlements\n]]\nPlum Bayou culture was one of the earliest groups to build ceremonial community centers with platform mounds and rectangular plazas. They primarily lived in small villages in the uplands and floodplains of the White and Arkansas Rivers. Archaeologists divide Plum Bayou settlements into \"single household, multiple household, multiple household with mound, and multiple mound sites.\"\nSubsistence\nFarmers grew crops such as amaranth, chenopodium, bottle gourd, knotweed, little barley, maygrass, squash, sunflower, and sumpweed. In some later Plum Bayou sites, maize was cultivated in small amounts. Supplementing their farming, Plum Bayou peoples also hunted game and gathered wild plants, such as cherries, grapes, plums, persimmons, and nuts.\nMaterial culture\nThis culture is defined in part by its ceramics. Much of Plum Bayou ceramics was plainware, tempered with shells. Named types of ceramics found at Plum Bayou sites include Coles Creek incised var. Keyo, Larto Red, Officer Punctated, and French Fork incised. Red slip, or clay paint, was also used to decorate some ceramic vessels.\nDecline\nWhile neighboring cultures adopted maize cultivation and increasingly complex religions and political organization, the Plum Bayou people did not. People continued to occupy the region, but they abandoned their ceremonial sites. The exact descendants of the Plum Bayou culture are not known; however, Quapaw people today are responsible for Plum Bayou human remains and artifacts through the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.\nSee also\n*Culture, phase, and chronological table for the Mississippi Valley\nNotes\nReferences\n*Odell, George H.
