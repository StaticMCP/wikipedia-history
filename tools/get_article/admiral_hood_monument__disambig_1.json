It was completed in 1831 to a design by Henry Goodridge.\nDescription\nMonument crown\nThe monument is a  Tuscan column on a cuboid ashlar base set on two tall steps, the lower supporting a wrought iron railing enclosure. The proportions of the monument were based on those of Trajan's column in Rome. There was originally a doorway in the base, but this was sealed in 1990. The monument culminates in a band of laurel wreaths beneath a naval crown, composed of the sculpted sterns of four galleons interspersed with four mainsails. It was carved by Gahagan of Bath.\nThe monument was paid for by public subscription and designed by the architect Henry Goodridge. It was originally linked to the Hood family home at Butleigh by a mile long avenue of cedar trees. The inscription was composed by Sir James Mackintosh and reads as follows:\nOn the north face:\nIN MEMORY OF\nSIR SAMUEL HOOD\nBARONET\nKNIGHT OF THE MOST HONOURABLE ORDER OF THE BATH\nAND NOMINATED GRAND CROSS THEREOF\nKNIGHT OF St FERDINAND AND OF MERIT\nKNIGHT GRAND CROSS OF THE SWORD\nVICE ADMIRAL OF THE WHITE\nAND COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF HIS MAJESTY'S FLEET\nIN THE EAST INDIES\nOn the west face:\nAN OFFICER OF THE HIGHEST DISTINCTION\nAMONGST THE ILLUSTRIOUS MEN\nWHO RENDERED THEIR OWN AGE\nTHE BRIGHTEST PERIOD\nIN THE NAVAL HISTORY\nOF THEIR COUNTRY\nOn the south face:\nTHIS MONUMENT IS DEDICATED\nTO THEIR LATE COMMANDER\nBY THE ATTACHMWNT AND REVERENCE\nOF BRITISH OFFICERS\nOF WHOM MANY WERE HIS ADMIRING FOLLOWERS\nIN THOSE AWFUL SCENES OF WAR\nIN WHICH WHILE THEY CALL FORTH\nTHE GRANDEST QUALITIES OF HUMAN NATURE\nIN HIM LIKEWISE GAVE OCCASION\nFOR THE EXERCISE OF ITS MOST AMIABLE VIRTUES\nHE DIED AT MADRAS DECEMBER 24th 1814\nIt was designated as a grade II* listed building in 1958.\nReferences"
