The treaty was signed in Beijing by Huang Hua (1913 &ndash; 2010), Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China, and Sunao Sonoda (1913 &ndash; 1984), Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan. The treaty went into effect on October 23, 1978, with the state visit of Vice Premier of the PRC Deng Xiaoping (1904 &ndash; 1997) to Japan.  The treaty had its origin in the Joint Communiqué of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China of 1972. Negotiations on a formal peace treaty began in 1974, but were drawn out over various disputes until 1978. The treaty ultimately consisted of five articles, and was strongly opposed by the Soviet Union.\nSee also\n* Joint Communiqué of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China\n* China–Japan relations\n* Japan China Trade Agreement 1974\nFootnotes\n:A.*The treaty is commonly known in Japanese by its abbreviated name, .\nNotes\nReferences\n* Cheng J.Y.S (2001).
