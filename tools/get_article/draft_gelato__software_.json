It was originally intended for use with Quadro FX GPUs, later adding support for GeForce cards. Designed to produce film-quality images, Gelato uses a shading language very similar to RenderMan.\nIt was initially priced at several thousand US dollars (USD) per node. In 2006, Nvidia added a free limited-functionality version.\nIn May 2008 Nvidia announced that it would no longer be developing or supporting Gelato software, releasing a last full-featured version as a free download.\nHistory\nGelato is a rendering system developed in the early 2000s to support Nvidia's motion picture industry customers, providing software support for near-time rendering, then one of the two main application markets for Nvidia Quadro Plex hardware. To address the limits of GPU technology of that time, Nvidia designed Gelato as a hybrid GPU/CPU system, leveraging the advantages of the two different processing architectures. It was created as a functional successor to Blue Moon Rendering Tools (BMRT), a RenderMan-compliant photorealistic rendering system, by BMRT's original developer Larry Gritz and other former employees of Exluna, which Nvidia had acquired in 2002. Exluna had previously created Entropy, an enhanced commercial version of BMRT; Gelato is a clean-slate renderer implementation.\nGelato was originally priced at 2,750 per node. In a push to popularize the emerging concept of GPU-accelerated rendering (as opposed to traditional CPU-based rendering), with the release of Gelato 2.0 Nvidia introduced a free version of Gelato for PCs, with some capabilities locked out. The full-featured version was rebranded \"Gelato Pro\", and was priced at $1,500 per render node, supporting extra features:\n* Sorbetto, an interactive relighting technology\n* DSO shadeops\n* Network parallel rendering\n* Multithreading\n* Native 64-bit support\n* Maintenance and support\nLegacy\nIn May 2008 Nvidia announced that it would no longer be developing or supporting Gelato software, and released a final version of Gelato Pro as a free download. The development team was redeployed to the Mental Ray ray tracing software product, which Nvidia had acquired in 2007.\nGelato was an early step in the Nvidia founders' intent to evolve from a video game card company to a high-performance computing platform provider; it was described by one author as having \"paved the way for important advances in GPU computing.\"\nSee also\n* cg (programming language)\n* OptiX, a later Nvidia CUDA-based ray tracing API\n* OpenImageIO\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  (official website)\n*\n* [https://film.download.nvidia.com/techref.pdf Gelato 2.1 Technical Reference] Nvidia, 2006.\n*\n:Category:3D rendering software for Linux\n:Category:Freeware 3D graphics software\n:Category:Nvidia software\n:Category:Proprietary freeware for Linux"
