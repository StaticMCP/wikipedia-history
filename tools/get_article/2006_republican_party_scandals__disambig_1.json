Bush's second term as President and leading up to the 2006 midterm elections.\nThe Democratic Party unified several local and national campaigns around the slogan or meme \"culture of corruption\". The phrase was used to describe any political scandal, beginning with a national attempt by Gov. Howard Dean (D-VT) to link allegations of insider trading by Senator Bill Frist (R-TN) to the then-emerging Abramoff Scandal. Dean asserted that \"Republicans have made their culture of corruption the norm.\" The phrase was thereafter repeated by other Democratic Party leaders, including Nancy Pelosi (responding to the indictment of Tom DeLay), \"The criminal indictment of Majority Leader Tom DeLay is the latest example that Republicans in Congress are plagued by a culture of corruption at the expense of the American people.\"\nList of politicians\nResigned\nFile:Duke Cunningham.jpg|U.S. Congressman Duke Cunningham — In November 2005 he resigned after pleading guilty to federal charges of conspiracy to commit bribery, mail fraud, wire fraud, and tax evasion. He was sentenced to over eight years in prison and an order to pay $1.8 million in restitution.\nFile:TomDeLay.jpg|U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay — In September 2005, he resigned from the House because a Texas court charged him of violating campaign finance laws and money laundering. DeLay pleaded not guilty, claiming political motivation for the charges. Was found guilty in 2010. His conviction was overturned in 2013 due to insufficient evidence.\nFile:Mark Foley, official 109th Congress photo.jpg|U.S. Congressman Mark Foley — In September 2006, he resigned from the House because of allegations of sending teenage boys explicit sexually solicit e-mails and instant messages. In 2008, the case was thrown out and the charges were dropped because of insufficient evidence.\nFile:Bob Ney.jpg|U.S. Congressman Bob Ney — In November 2006, he resigned after he pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and making false statements in relation to the Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal. He served thirty months in prison.\nLost re-election\nFile:Sue-Kelly.jpg|U.S. Congresswoman Sue W.

A review on right-wing web site WorldNet Daily said: \"Vincent and McCain do not claim that the Republican Party boasts only the good, the pure and the beautiful, as Aristotle said...\"  Democrat William Jefferson was re-elected in his district despite the ongoing investigation, which some political commentators such as Rush Limbaugh have decried as a hypocrisy of the \"culture of corruption\" label with which the DNC had been branding the Republicans.\nRepublicans have also accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of hypocrisy, who had promised to \"drain the swamp\" and have \"the most open, most honest, most ethical Congress in history,\" [https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/62670-pelosi-we-are-the-most-ethical-congress/] while defending the unethical former House Ways and Means Chair Charlie Rangel.\n2006 Democratic party scandals\nWhile usually avoiding using the phrase, Republicans responded to Democratic charges by pointing out that Democrats had also been involved in similar scandals. These Democrats included:\n*Congressman William J. Jefferson, whose Congressional offices were raided by the FBI in May 2006\n*Alabama Governor Don Siegelman, convicted on corruption charges in June 2006\nList of scandals\n*Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal\n*Mark Foley scandal\n*Tom DeLay campaign finance investigation\n*Plame affair\n*Cunningham scandal\n*Jerry Lewis – Lowery lobbying firm controversy\n*Bush administration payment of columnists\nSee also\n*Criminalization of politics\n*Culture of Life\n*Culture of Death\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.thecultureofcorruption.com/ TheCultureofCorruption.com] (Independent Party)\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120204045153/http://www.democrats.org/a/2005/08/an_episode_of_t.php Culture of Corruption: A Week of GOP Scandals] (from the webpage of the Democratic Party)\n*[http://www.thecultureofcorruption.com/ A look at the scandals from the left]\n*[https://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0608/p02s01-uspo.html \"In California, sigh of relief for GOP\"] by Linda Feldmann, Christian Science Monitor, June 8, 2006, retrieved June 21, 2006\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060506033250/http://www.aim.org/media_monitor/4521_0_2_0_C/ \"The Democrats' Culture of Corruption\"] Accuracy in Media, Cliff Kincaid, April 28, 2006\n*[http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/09/28/delay.indict/index.html DeLay indicted, steps down as majority leader]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051217060648/http://www.oxfordpress.com/news/content/shared/news/nation/stories/07/04_DEMS_LOBBY.html Dean decries GOP's \"culture of corruption\"]\n*[https://archive.today/20130104061308/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9680466/ SEC issues subpoena to Frist, sources say]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051128220457/http://www.ajc.com/news/content/news/stories/0705/04demslobby.html Dean slam at GOP puts Democrats in tricky spot]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120204045159/http://www.democrats.org/a/2005/10/republican_cult.php Republican Culture of Corruption Reaches Alaska] (from the webpage of the Democratic Party)\n*[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/01/AR2006110103146.html \"Scandals Alone Could Cost Republicans Their House Majority\"], by Jonathan Weisman and Jeffrey H.
