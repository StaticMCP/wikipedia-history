After attacking, the submarine was located by a German BV 138C flying boat, and the Romanian gunboats Sublocotenent Ghiculescu and Stihi Eugen were sent to the scene. The two Romanian warships attacked the Soviet submarine with depth-charges, sinking her with all hands.\nAlternative versions\nRecent surveys in the area failed to find the wreck in the alleged sinking location and it has been raised the alternative version that M-118 was lost due to a German seaplane attack or from a Romanian field barrage \"S-30\".\nAt the same time, one source reported that two Soviet submarines were sunk by Romanian surface units. There are several Soviet submarines claimed to have been sunk by Romanian surface warships, but the two most valid claims are the M-118 and Shch-206'', sunk on 9 July 1941.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/4980.html M-118 of the Soviet Navy]\n* [http://www.sovboat.ru/ship/m118.php3 M-118 (rus)]"
