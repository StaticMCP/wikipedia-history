He was born Edward Howard Gibbon in London and was the second son of the Charles Howard, 11th Duke of Norfolk, and Mary Ann Gibbon—the Duke's long-time mistress.\nEdward received a formal education, became a surgeon in his early adult years, and then pursued legal training. He and his family migrated to British Guiana to serve as \"Protector of the Slaves\" before returning to England. He established himself as an officer of arms at the College of Arms. He served as Mowbray Herald,  York Herald of Arms in Ordinary and Norroy King of Arms(1848–1849), and secretary to the Earl Marshal.  His older brother Matthew Howard-Gibbon was Richmond Herald of Arms in Ordinary.\nEdward received his hyphenated surname and family coat of arms in 1842 by Royal Licence with consent of the 13th Duke of Norfolk. He served as the mayor of Arundel during the time of Queen Victoria's official visit in 1846. He died on 22 June 1849 in London and is buried at Saint Nicholas Churchyard in Arundel. He was survived by his wife Amelia Dendy Howard-Gibbon and six children. His oldest daughter, Amelia Frances Howard-Gibbon, later became a well-known artist in Ontario, Canada, and the annual Canadian children's illustration award is named for her.\nArms\nBritish History Online |website=british-history.ac.uk |language=en |access-date=2018-11-21}}\n| motto = My Truste Ys\n| orders =\n| bannerimage =\n| banner =\n| badgeimage =\n| badge =\n| symbolism =\n| previous_versions =\n}}\nReferences"
