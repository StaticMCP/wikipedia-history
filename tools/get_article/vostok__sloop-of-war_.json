After repair in Sydney in Australia, the expedition explored the tropical parts of the Pacific, and on  again turned to Antarctica. On  the sloops reached the southernmost point of their voyage at 69° 53' S and 92° 19' W. On  they returned to Kronstadt.\nIn 751 days they covered 49,723 miles (approx. 92,300&nbsp;km). Apart from the discovery of the world's sixth continent, Antarctica, 29 islands were mapped and complex oceanographic works carried out. A medal was issued by the Russian Admiralty to commemorate the expedition.\nIn 1828 sloop Vostok was excluded from navy lists and scrapped.\nNamed in honor\n(right) during the First Russian Antarctic Expedition on a coin of the Bank of Russia]]\n* Vostok Island in the Line Islands group (Polynesia), discovered by Bellingshausen during the First Russian Antarctic Expedition in 1820.\n* Cape Vostok, the western extremity of the Havre Mountains and the northwestern extremity of Alexander Island in Antarctic, discovered by Bellingshausen in 1821.\n* Vostok Rupes, a mountain chain on planet Mercury.\n* Vostok Station, a Russian Antarctic research station located on the Pole of Cold amid the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, established on 16 December 1957 (during the International Geophysical Year) by the 2nd Soviet Antarctic Expedition.\n* Vostok Subglacial Highlands, an east extension of Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains in Antarctica.\n* Vostok Lake, the largest subglacial lake in the world is named after Vostok Station.
