Owing to the general lack of plural markers in Chinese, it is frequently understood as a temple specifically honoring Qian Liu, the first of the Wuyue kings, but it officially honors his entire dynasty. The grounds include the tomb of Qian Liu as well as four of his children and are located beside the Park of Orioles Singing in the Willows. The restored temple has been reckoned among the Ten New Scenes of West Lake under the name ”Loyalty Displayed at the Qian Temple“ (, ).\nHistory\nA Taoist temple was first constructed at the site to honor the Qian kings of Wuyue in Yuanfeng 2 (1079) during the Song dynasty. As prefect of Hang, Su Dongpo erected a commemorative stela for it }},}} ,}} p) that became a famous exemplar of his calligraphy. It praises the Qian kings not only for their bravery and wisdom in safeguarding and assisting their people, but also for having loyally submitted to the Song. The site was originally known as the Biaozhong Temple (\"Temple of Loyalty Displayed\") but gained its present name over the course of the Qing dynasty. During the many Southern Tours of the Kangxi and Qianlong Emperors of the Qing, they inscribed numerous placards for the temple with sayings such as \"Ensuring the Land\" (}}, ) and \"Shelter Left by the Loyal and Obedient\" }},}} ,}} p).\nThe temple grounds were restored in 2003. In 2007, Hangzhou organized a massive ceremony in honor of the 1100th anniversary of Qian Liu's investiture as king of Wuyue. Before an audience including 400 descendants of the dynasty, the municipality's vice-mayor read an elegy; traditional ritual music was performed; offerings were made of incense, silk, grains, and the three animals (ox, sheep, pig) of the great Tailao sacrifice; and a bell was struck fourteen times: once for each prefecture of Wuyue.\nDesign\nThe temple consists of two courtyards surrounded by traditional halls filled with paintings and statuary about the Qian kings. It is sited south of the present location of Yongjin Pond and across the lake from the Tomb of Yue Fei.\nActivities\nThe inner courtyard standing before the central hall honoring Qian Liu includes a large incense burner. Temple staff decorate the inner courtyard each Chinese New Year with a life-size engraving of the corresponding animal of the Chinese zodiac.\nSee also\n* Luoyang, site of the tomb of Qian Chu, last of the Qian kings of Wuyue\n* Lin'an District, site of the royal mausoleums of other members of the Qian dynasty\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n*  |contribution-url=https://wgly.hangzhou.gov.cn/art/2023/8/21/art_1229733703_58949645.html |contribution=King Qians' Temple of Loyalty |title=Official site |url=https://wgly.hangzhou.gov.cn }}.\n* .\n* ."
