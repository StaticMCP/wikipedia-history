This allows determining the exact history of every document (and even small parts of documents).\nPresent HTML and HTTP do not have this feature, but certain systems on the World Wide Web (such as WikiWiki and Everything Engine) may have limited versions of the capability.\nOne application of digital watermarking is source tracking.\nSee also\n*Version control\nReferences"
