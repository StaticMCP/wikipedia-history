The Pascoe River flows into the bay. To the south of the bay is the Kutini-Payamu National Park.\nHistory\nIt was one of the Australian places named by James Cook during his voyage in HMS Endeavour northwards along the east coast in 1770; he named it on Friday 17 August 1770.\nWeymouth Bay was significant in the exploration of the Cape York Peninsula by Edmund Kennedy in 1848. During their journey north from Rockingham Bay (near the present-day town of Cardwell), Kennedy left eight members of the expedition at Weymouth Bay, intending to pick them up later on the return by sea. However Kennedy and all but one member died later during the journey; all but two of the eight members left at Weymouth Bay died before they were relieved.\nReferences"
