Francis’ channel is co-produced by their friend, Mitchell Pratt, who also creates the thumbnails for their videos; they are both bisexual. In Highschool they dreamed of pursuing a career in filmmaking and later received a BFA in Film Production with a Directing emphasis at Chapman University. Their channel largely consists of videos about film/TV, pop culture icons, queer culture, and politics. Francis has also critiqued RuPaul's Drag Race by stating \"I feel like RuPaul’s Drag Race has discouraged mainstream audiences from supporting local drag and lesser known performers. Drag is an art that’s a radical form of self expression, and it takes on every possible form. Which means it can scare away audiences who have only been exposed to the very specific pageantry seen on Drag Race–which is still beautiful and valid!\".\nReferences"
