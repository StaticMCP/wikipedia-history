It is indirectly one of the founding factions of the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO), which was founded in 1905.\nThe POSR was founded by a dissidence from the Federation of the Socialist Workers of France (FTSF) led by Jean Allemane. The party, which along with Allemane was a strong believer of the primacy of syndicalism in politics, became a base of future revolutionary syndicalism and parties of a similar ideology would occasionally be described as Allemaniste.\nHowever, next to the working-class socialism of Allemane, an intellectual socialist movement developed within the POSR, led by Lucien Herr, a librarian. This movement's priority was the education of the people. Overall, the POSR was a moderate reformist party, influenced by possibilism which believed that socialism could be achieved through democratic action, such as decentralization and legislative participation.\nIn 1902, the POSR merged with the FTSF and Independent Socialists to form the French Socialist Party (PSF).\nIn 1905, the PSF was along with the Socialist Party of France a founding member of the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO).\nSee also\n* Federation of the Socialist Workers of France\n* French Section of the Workers' International\n* French Socialist Party\n* History of the Left in France\nReferences"
