The DPR declared independence from Ukraine in 2014 and adopted its own national symbols the same year, but has received limited international recognition, being only recognized by Russia.\nHistory & description\nThe emblem of the Donetsk People's Republic was approved on 20 June 2014 along with the flag.\nThe emblem depicts a silver double-headed eagle with its wings spread upwards. On the breast of an eagle — in a scarlet shield of a Saint Archangel Michael in a silver robe and armament, with a golden sword and a silver edged shield with a silver Orthodox cross. The peculiarity of the emblem of the DPR is that the eagle has no paws, the beaks are closed, and the Archangel Michael is depicted with a beard. The original image of the shield on the eagle's chest completely repeated the project of the coat of arms of Kyiv, developed by the Kyiv artist and heraldist Alexey Rudenko in 2009.\nFile:2014-dpr-seal.jpg\nFile:2016.
