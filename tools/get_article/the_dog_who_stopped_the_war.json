The film was the first in the Tales for All (Contes pour tous) series of children's movies created by Les Productions la Fête.\nPlot\nThe film involves a huge snowball fight between the children of a small town in Quebec during winter vacation who split into two rival gangs, one defending a snow castle, the other attacking it. The attackers are led by a boy who styles himself as \"General Luc\" and has a reputation for being bossy. The defenders are outnumbered and led by Pierre, who owns a dog named Cléo. They also have the genius boy François on their side.  An observer, Danny Martin from Victoriaville, professes his neutrality but watches with interest.\nFrançois designs a massive, elaborate snow fortress, and Pierre's group constructs it. Luc arrives with his army, wearing makeshift armour and wielding wooden swords. They attempt to scale the walls with a ladder, but Luc is injured in the battle and orders a retreat. They regroup and stage a second, more covert attack, but they are spotted and beaten back again with snowballs soaked in ink.\nLuc counters by attacking a third time, this time with his army dressed in garbage bags as protection from the ink. They overwhelm the fort's defences, and Pierre and François escape via toboggan through a secret tunnel. The two groups meet and agree to have one final battle to determine the winner.\nLuc shows up for the final siege with an even larger army, having recruited additional (younger) children with chocolate. They also possess new weapons such as slingshots and a snowball cannon. Luc orders them to charge, and despite being slowed by barricades, they eventually breach the fortress walls and engage in melee combat with the defenders. Pierre's dog Cléo comes after her owner, and one of the fortress walls collapses, killing her. The war ends, as both sides help bury her.\nThe song at the end of the movie is performed by Nathalie Simard. It's called \"L'amour a pris son temps\" (\"Love Is On Our Side\").\nCast\nRelease\nThe Dog Who Stopped the War was first released in theatres on October 3, 1984, by Cinéma Plus.
