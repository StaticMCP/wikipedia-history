Recorded at Wire Recording in Austin, Texas with producer Matt Bayles, it was released by Kemado Records in August 2010. Warp Riders was written and recorded as a concept album centered on an original science fiction narrative written by vocalist and guitarist J. D. Cronise, and marks a conscious change in style from doom metal to a more hard rock-influenced sound.\nThe Sword's third album is the first by the band to be produced by someone other than frontman Cronise, who handled production duties on Age of Winters and Gods of the Earth. It was also the last album to feature original drummer Trivett Wingo, who left the band in October 2010 early into the promotional tour for the record, citing physical and mental exhaustion. The album was also the group's last to be released under their deal with Kemado Records, before signing with Razor & Tie in 2012.\nThe lead single from Warp Riders was \"Tres Brujas\", which was released as a digital download in July 2010. The song is also featured as the first in a trilogy of music videos to promote the album, which also includes \"Lawless Lands\" and \"Night City\". The second single from the album is \"(The Night the Sky Cried) Tears of Fire\", released in November 2010. Warp Riders was a relative commercial success, peaking at number 42 on the US Billboard 200 chart, and the album was promoted on the Warp Riders Tour starting in November 2010.\nWriting and recording\nIt first came to light that the Sword was working on a follow-up to Gods of the Earth in August 2009, when the band revealed that \"The writing process is nearing completion, and demoing will soon commence. Recording will follow in the fall with a release as soon as the suits can get it together. The record will be a concept album centered around an original science fiction narrative\". The first performance of new material came at Fun Fun Fun Fest in November, with drummer Trivett Wingo comparing this practice to the first performance of tracks from Gods of the Earth at the 2007 edition of the festival. An update regarding the album was issued in December, explaining that the band had nearly completed the writing process for the record, would begin recording in early 2010, and were to embark on a short regional tour in January.\nIn February 2010 it was revealed that, contrary to the practice exercised on the band's previous two albums, frontman J. D. Cronise would not be producing the upcoming third album; instead production and engineering would be led by Matt Bayles, known for his work with such bands as Mastodon, Isis and Minus the Bear. It was also revealed at this time that recording for the album had begun, at a recording studio in Austin, Texas known as The Wire. By April the Sword had completed the recording of its third album, although no further details were given regarding a track listing, title or release date. Cronise assured fans in April, in response to the query \"Give us a status report on what's been recorded so far and what it sounds like\" from an interviewer, that the album was \"completely done\" and contained \"things ... that our fans will be very glad to hear, and ... things they don't know they'll be glad to hear until they hear them\".\nComposition and style\nIn the band's first update regarding the third album, it was revealed that the album was to be \"a concept album centered around an original science fiction narrative.\" In March 2010, primary songwriter Cronise added further detail to this idea by suggesting that the album would have a \"broader hard rock sound\", explaining that \"It's really a concept record. The songs revolve around a concept we came up with or spin off from it. It's not the kind of fantasy concept though, it's more sci-fi.\" Cronise also offered the following explanation of the album's direction in an interview with Decibel:\nIt was revealed as early as November 2009 that the band were aiming to take a new direction with the third album, with Cronise explaining that \"coming up with eight or nine or 10 different themes [for songs] every couple years, well, it's a little daunting some times, especially for me personally\" and noting that \"Given the types of themes we'd covered already, I didn't really want to revisit the same stuff again on another record and talk about the same things and doom and gloom and sorcerers and ravens and things. So, we just kind of wanted to change it up and do something a little different.\" Further elaboration was also given on the 'science fiction concept album' idea, with Cronise explaining that \"It's psychedelic, in a way. It's not like Star Wars science fiction ... laser guns and action all the time. It's more cerebral in that it's still mythological in the way it's told. It's science fiction and there's spaceships and robots, but it doesn't take place in the future. It's just like another planet far away sort of thing. Otherworldly. And of course, it will have universal-type themes in it. I wanted to create a completely original kind of setting to have the songs take place in.\"\nPredicting critical reception to the new direction of the album, Cronise proposed that \"It will absolutely alienate some fans. The kind of music we play is partially described as heavy metal and unfortunately, a lot of dudes that like heavy metal are very narrow-minded and only like it to sound one particular way. So I'm sure we alienated people with our second album.\" Despite this, he assured that the sound of the music would not change as much, explaining that \"There'll definitely still be heavy stuff on the record, and fast, thrashy, and slow and sludgy stuff like we've done before. Heavy metal, basically. But a lot of the songs are just what I'd call hard rock songs. The attitude and the vibe is different. It's not as aggressive, sonically. It's a little bit more ... I don't know how to explain it. It's just rock. It's a rock album. Some parts will be heavier than the heaviest stuff we've done, but at the same time, there will be acoustic stuff. It is a varied record, I guess.\nMusic news website MetalInsider.net mentioned the album on its Twitter profile, saying \"Listening to some new Sword album. Mind blown. Sounds like Lynyrd Skynyrd crashed into C.O.C. instead of a mountain.\" According to the press release, the album \"is anchored by an epic science-fiction narrative\" and \"the storyline is a psychedelic space opera that explores temporal themes of death and rebirth.\"\nScience fiction storyline\nThe band's official website gives an in-depth description of the album's science fiction storyline:\n}}\nMusic website musicOMH also briefly detailed the synopsis of the album's story, explaining that \"we follow the tale of an archer by the name of Ereth, who has been cast out from his tribe on the planet Acheron. As luck would have it the planet has undergone a tidal lock, causing one half to be cast in shadow, whilst the other is burnt to a crisp by a set of unforgiving suns. With light and shade being quite a feature of the planet, it was only a matter of time before a battle between good and evil broke out – cursed metaphors. Warp Riders follows this tale to the bitter end.\"\nAlbum cover\nThe album cover was revealed in late June; designed by artist Dan McPharlin, it is said to pay homage to the authors that inspired the album's lyrics.\nRelease\nIt was on April 30, 2010 that the album's title and release date were confirmed as Warp Riders and August 24. On May 14, 2010 the first song titles for Warp Riders – \"Acheron/Unearthing the Orb\" and \"(The Night Sky Cried) Tears of Fire\" – were confirmed. Blabbermouth.net reported the following descriptions:\nThe lead single from the album was \"Tres Brujas\", which was released as a digital download on July 6, 2010. The song is also the first in a planned trilogy of music videos to be produced by Artificial Army (who worked on the video for \"Maiden, Mother & Crone\"), which will begin in August and continue with \"Lawless Lands\" and \"Night City\", while \"(The Night the Sky Cried) Tears of Fire\" will also be released as a 12\" picture disc. In revealing details of the album's artwork, Blabbermouth.net also named more new songs to be released as singles and/or music videos: lead single \"Tres Brujas\" and music videos \"Lawless Lands\" and \"Night City\". On July 18, 2010, the Sword reported on their official Facebook page that \"We are almost done shooting our radical video trilogy for Night City, Tres Brujas and Lawless Lands. First installment should be out first week of August\", and uploaded a screenshot from one of the videoshoots.\nBeginning on August 20, the Sword have been streaming Warp Riders in full on their MySpace page for free. The music video for \"Tres Brujas\" began streaming, also on MySpace, from August 23. In reply to a query from a fan on Twitter, the band revealed that they are planning on releasing a comic book based on the Warp Riders album.\nReception\n|title=Warp Riders > Review |author=Eduardo Rivadavia |website=AllMusic |access-date=September 24, 2010 }}\n| rev1Score =\n| rev2      = The A.V.

The A.V. Club awarded the album an A grade in its review, with critic Leonard Pierce summarised the album by noting that \"the music is gripping, intense, and unimpeachably heavy from the psyched-out mania of “Acheron” to the end.\" Pierce also suggested that \"There isn’t a bad song on the record, and it delivers solid stand-outs ... while remaining a surprisingly unified whole.\" Eduardo Rivadavia of allmusic awarded the album three and a half stars out of a possible five, the same as Gods of the Earth but one less than Age of Winters, and praised the band's choice to change direction both musically and thematically, highlighting \"Tres Brujas\", \"Lawless Lands\" and \"The Warp Riders\" as particularly notable tracks. Reviewing the album for the BBC, critic Noel Gardner suggested that Warp Riders \"is not likely to blow the mind of anyone well versed in this strain of chest-puffing metal, either in terms of originality or any member’s technical ability\", although did recognise that \"The Sword have stepped up a gear with this release, and ought to crumble the defences of more than a few cynics.\" Writing for website musicOMH, Sam Shepherd praised the album, summarising it as \"vital and thrilling\". In Rock Sound Mike Kemp concluded that \"the riffs remain as ample and hard-hitting as ever, and with Matt Bayles (Isis, Mastodon) handling the production, the Sword have never sounded better.\" The album also reached number 42 on the Billboard 200 chart, a personal record for the band.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n;The Sword\n*J.
