Unlike the league awards which are given in each conference, the PVL Press Corps awards are based on annual performance throughout multiple conferences combined with voting from team representatives and the press corps. Alongside the PVL, the men's Spikers' Turf would also have its own set of annual awards.\nThe first event was held on May 28 at Novotel Manila Araneta City in Quezon City.\nEditions\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width=\"100%\"\n|-\n!
