Ocean developed dozens of games for a variety of home computer systems such as the ZX Spectrum, Oric 1, Commodore 64, Dragon 32/64, MSX, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 16, Atari ST, Amiga, IBM PC, BBC Micro and video game consoles, such as the Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Master System, and Sega Genesis/Mega Drive.\nHistory\nJon Woods and David Ward created Spectrum Games as a mail-order business in 1983 after being inspired by the success of Liverpool-based software houses Imagine Software, Bug-Byte and Software Projects. Their initial catalogue was based around clones of arcade video games like Frogger and Missile Command for various home computers including the ZX81, ZX Spectrum and VIC-20.\nWhile trying to sell their titles into high street stores it became clear that the company name was confusing to owners of machines other than the ZX Spectrum. The company was renamed Ocean Software leading to some of its games being re-released with different titles so the Berzerk clone Frenzy was reissued as Robotics and Missile Attack became Armageddon.\nBy September 1984, the success of Ocean allowed Woods and Ward to invest £50,000 in a new software house in return for a 50% stake in the company. U.S. Gold was created by Geoff Brown, owner of Centresoft software distribution, and specialised in importing American Commodore 64 games for the UK market. U.S. Gold had no developers to port the Commodore games for the UK's most popular home computer, the ZX Spectrum, so Ocean produced the conversions of titles such as Beach Head, Raid over Moscow and Tapper through its external development team, Platinum Productions.\nIn October 1984, Ocean bought the name and branding of Imagine Software from the liquidators of the failed software house. Although originally intended to be a label exclusively for arcade conversions, the Imagine logo would also be used on a number of original titles, as well as on UK releases of games licensed from Spanish developers Dinamic Software.\nIn 1985, Ocean and U.S. Gold collaborated again to launch a new label, The Hit Squad, for releasing compilation packages. The first release featured Ocean's ''Daley Thompson's Decathlon'', U.S. Gold's Beach Head, Jet Set Willy from Software Projects and Sabre Wulf by Ultimate Play the Game&nbsp;— all titles which had sold over a million copies&nbsp;— which led to the title They Sold A Million. The compilation went on to sell over a million copies, as did the second and third instalments in the series.\nOver half of Ocean's releases for 8-bit home computers were coin-op conversions and licensed games. While initially focused on British licences, such as Hunchback from Manchester's Century Electronics, Liverpool's Frankie Goes to Hollywood, and Olympic decathlete Daley Thompson, its attention soon shifted to film licences, with The NeverEnding Story becoming its first movie tie-in in 1985.\nIn 1986, a deal was signed with Taito and Data East for home versions of their arcade games, such as Arkanoid, Renegade, The NewZealand Story and Operation Wolf. Operation Wolf was the first title to be converted to 16-bit platforms by Ocean France,  a company created by Ocean and Marc Djan in 1986. The studio produced most of its 16-bit arcade conversions until 1991, when the company became Ocean's French marketing and sales department.\nSuccess of film-licensed games\n1986 also produced titles based on the films Rambo, Short Circuit and Cobra, as well as the first licensed Batman game. But it would be its 1988 game RoboCop, adapted from Data East's arcade game based on the film RoboCop, that would go on to become the most successful movie licence in history by the end of the decade.\nIn 1987, Ocean via Imagine had a deal with Spanish publisher Dinamic Software to release four titles, before launching its own line in the United Kingdom. The following year, Ocean signed a deal with Special FX Software, a company formed by ex-Ocean employees to release titles for home computers, starting with Firefly.\nIn 1989, The Hit Squad branding reappeared as the new budget re-release label for Ocean's 8-bit back catalogue. The entire series consisted of 122 titles over seven 8-bit formats. Their uniform style and numbering has led to them becoming highly collectable. Meanwhile, the company was working on its next big film tie-in, which would be specifically aimed at the new graphically superior 16-bit computers, the Atari ST and Amiga.\nThe success of RoboCop established Ocean globally, and it would be Warner Bros. who suggested to Ocean that it produce a tie-in based on its forthcoming Batman movie. The resulting game was another tremendous hit for the company and is now regarded as one of the greatest video game/film tie-ins. The game was used as the basis of the Amiga 500 \"Batman Pack\", which became one of the most successful hardware/software bundles of all time. In 1990, Ocean launched its new subsidiary, Ocean of America, led by former Data East boss Ray Musci to publish titles for the American market.\nOcean was voted Best 8-bit Software House of the Year at the 1989 Golden Joystick Awards, along with awards for its 8-bit and 16-bit conversions of Operation Wolf.\nMerger with Infogrames (1996)\nIn 1996, Ocean's parent company Ocean International Ltd. announced they would be purchased by and merge with French publisher Infogrames for £100 million. This was the first key purchase in Infogrames' \"Expand through Acquisition\" policy. After the merger, Ocean remained as a separate division of Infogrames, continuing to publish and distribute its own games, such as F-22: Air Dominance Fighter., with the UK subsidiary beginning to distribute titles from Infogrames, such as V-Rally.\nIn 1997, Infogrames' French publishing division Infogrames Télématique launched a European-focused online gaming website under the Ocean brand called Oceanline. The website offered up simplified online versions of a majority of Infogrames' game catalog.\nOn 8 February 1998, Bruno Bonnell announced that Ocean Software Limited would be rebranded as Infogrames United Kingdom Limited in order to standardize its various subsidiaries under the Infogrames banner. Ocean of America, Inc. was later renamed as Infogrames Entertainment, Inc. Infogrames continued to use Ocean as a brand name for specific titles until the end of the year when the company quietly retired the brand in favour of their own. The last title published under the Ocean brand altogether was the North American release of GT 64: Championship Edition for the Nintendo 64.\nAftermath\nInfogrames Entertainment, Inc. began to publish games under their own banner, replacing Infogrames' previous United States subsidiary I-Motion Inc. Infogrames Entertainment, Inc. was soon folded into Infogrames North America, Inc.&nbsp;— a renaming of Accolade&nbsp;— which then became Infogrames' United States division before being merged and folded into Infogrames, Inc., a renaming of GT Interactive.\nThe UK subsidiary continued to publish and distribute Infogrames' titles in the country, later being renamed as Atari United Kingdom Limited in 2003. In 2009, Bandai Namco Entertainment purchased Atari SA's European assets, and the remains of Ocean Software currently lie under the hands as Bandai Namco Entertainment's UK publishing and distribution division.\nTape loaders\nStarting with ''Daley Thompson's Decathlon in 1984, games on the ZX Spectrum used the Speedlock protection system, which eventually included a countdown timer showing the time left to load a game. On the Commodore 64, Ocean added a full-screen graphic to look at and some catchy music to listen to during the loading of the tape. Several different Loaders were implemented over the years. Eleven loaders are known to have been created for Ocean games. Some of the composers who created the music for the Ocean Loaders were Martin Galway, Jonathan Dunn, and Peter Clarke.\nGames\nLicensed games\n* The Addams Family\n* The Addams Family: Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt\n* Addams Family Values\n* Batman\n* Batman: The Caped Crusader\n* Batman: The Movie\n* Clive Barker's Nightbreed: The Action Game\n* Clive Barker's Nightbreed: The Interactive Movie\n* Cobra\n* Cool World\n* Darkman\n* Dennis the Menace\n* Eek the Cat\n* The Flintstones\n* Frankie Goes to Hollywood\n* Highlander\n* Hook\n* Hudson Hawk\n* Jurassic Park\n* Knight Rider\n* Lethal Weapon\n* Manchester United Championship Soccer\n* Miami Vice\n* Navy Seals\n* Platoon\n* Rambo\n* Rambo 3\n* Red Heat\n* RoboCop\n* RoboCop 2\n* RoboCop 3\n* Run the Gauntlet\n* The Shadow\n* Short Circuit\n* Street Hawk\n* Terminator 2: Judgment Day\n* Top Gun\n* Total Recall\n* The Transformers\n* The Untouchables\n* V: The Computer Game\n* Waterworld\n* WWF European Rampage Tour\n* WWF WrestleMania\nArcade conversions\n* Arkanoid (1987, Imagine)\n* Arkanoid: Revenge of Doh (1988, Imagine)\n* Athena (1987, Imagine)\n* Cabal (1989)\n* Chase H.Q.
