She praised Bhuvan Arora’s portrayal of Sub-Inspector Hemant Kumar as mature and humane, noting that his bond with a tea-seller facing caste bias was one of the most moving aspects of the series. A reviewer from Scroll.in remarked that \"Bhuvan Arora, who is usually cast in supporting roles, turns out an efficient performance as the dedicated cop.\" Shreyas Pande of Cinema Express rated the show 2 out of 5, noting that \"The show needed to be a bit more open, a bit less hesitant and a tad more dense to be true to the bleak nature of its themes. Right now, it just brushes away the conflict. The plot doesn’t thicken; the ideas don’t marinate. It just remains a sum total of its parts but never quite comes together as a whole\".\nSreeparna Sengupta from The Times of India rated the series 3 out of 5 stars, writing that \"This crime-thriller series keeps the intrigue going but falters in places\". Abhishek Srivastava of Moneycontrol gave it 3 out of 5, describing the series as \"raw, uneven but engaging,\" acknowledging its flaws in execution but crediting its exploration of caste and morality for elevating it beyond a routine thriller. Arpita Sarkar of OTTPlay rated the show 3 out of 5 and observed that it delivered a \"predictable tale of haunting crime, humanity, and survival,\" praising Arora’s acting but suggesting the writing left little room for surprise. Troy Ribeiro of The Free Press Journal wrote that \"this is not the beast that will devour you, but it will nibble at your curiosity until you’ve clicked through all episodes. A solid binge, if not a lasting memory.\"\nSumit Rajguru of Times Now rated the series 2 out of 5 and labeled it \"a twisted tale that tests patience,\" criticizing its slow burn and occasional lack of narrative clarity. Vinamra Mathur of Firstpost gave it 3 out of 5 emphasizing Arora’s performance as the most impressive aspect, describing the series as an atmospheric whodunit that stood out despite familiar tropes. Rekha Khan of Navbharat Times highlighted the show’s rootedness in rural India and its focus on caste issues, noting that the authenticity of its setting and performances were its strongest points. Navodaya Times echoed this view, praising the rural setting and performances while underlining its commentary on caste.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.zee5.com/web-series/details/janaawar-the-beast-within/0-6-4z5824829 Janaawar – The Beast Within] on ZEE5"
