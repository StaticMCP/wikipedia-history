The western boundary follows Slade Lane from Huntroyde Hall in the north, staying with the road as it turns into Moor Lane, before crossing Burnley Road and briefly following the River Calder. It then cuts back to the east, along the route of the disused North Lancashire Loop railway to Station road, following as it turns into Thompson Street, then Abingdon Road. Its other boundaries are the same as those of the parish.\nThe ward contains Shuttleworth College, Padiham Primary School and a Nursery.  Also Padiham Town Hall, Police Station and Fire Station, as well as the retail district and Market.  As previously mentioned the River Calder passes through the ward, as does the A671.  The ward is almost entirely urban in nature, with a single farm in its north-west corner. In 2001, 75.8% of dwellings where in the lowest Council Tax band.\nDemography\nThe United Kingdom Census 2001 showed a total resident population for this ward of 6,119 of which 2,918 are male and 3,201 female, with a mean age of 37.92 Years. The racial composition of the ward is 98% White and 1.23% South Asian or South Asian / British. The largest religious groups are Christian (79.54%) and Muslim (1.05%). 58.8% of adults between the ages of 16 and 74 are classed as economically active and in work.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://mario.lancashire.gov.uk/agsmario/default.aspx?categ=boundaries&wardcode=30UDGY&layeron=Ward%20Boundary Ward boundaries map at Lancashire MARIO] (Note: highly recommend opening this link in a new window or tab)\n*[http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadAreaSearch.do?a=3&r=1&i=1001&m=0&s=1280878625237&enc=1&areaSearchText=Gawthorpe&areaSearchType=14&extendedList=false&searchAreas= Office for National Statistics (ONS) - Gawthorpe Ward]\n*[http://www.saferlancashire.co.uk/statistics/index.asp?iWardID=52 Lancashire MADE public - Gawthorpe Ward]\n*[http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/cgi-bin/inyourarea/pcfind.pl?Ward=30UDGY Dept. for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) - Gawthorpe Ward]"
