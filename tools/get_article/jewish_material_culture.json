Many aspects of the material culture of Jews is shared, such as the ikat fabrics of Bukharan Jews that are dyed in patterns often corresponding to regions rather than ethnicity. Some local textiles and crafts find use in the creation of religious items like torah ark curtains or robes used in Jewish traditions and ceremonies like bar mitzvah, blending the Jewish aspects of culture with the local traditions.\nBackground\ns of Jewish communities in Central Asia were hand embroidered suzani]]\nMost studies of Jewish history and daily life in historic times have focused on text sources like the Talmud, which gives an incomplete understanding of practices in the daily lives of Jews, and contains some content understood to be theoretical. The material culture of Jewish communities was initially overlooked as an area of study. Work in 2007 has begun to explore the \"questions of transformation of Jewish culture through consumption and material culture\".

The traditional Jewish Houses have been listed as a World Heritage Site since 1993. Since 2020 efforts are underway to develop conservation strategies to preserve the vernacular architecture of the houses, located on narrow streets of medieval mahalla (neighborhoods), as the city undergoes modernization and urban development.\nJews were known for their skilled work dyeing and weaving textiles, especially Cashmere wool and silks. Henry Lansdell described a scene from a bazaar in Tashkent. The silk threads he purchased from the Jewish merchants there are today in the collection of the British Museum: \"We purchased pocket handkerchiefs and skeins of native silk, the latter very glossy, and dyed and sold largely by the Jews, who from the numbers we saw in the bazaar, and their begrimed appearance, gave one the idea that they engage a good deal in handicrafts, especially dyeing.\"\nReferences"
