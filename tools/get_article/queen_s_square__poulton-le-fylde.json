It stands today, immediately to the southeast of Market Place, at the convergence of Blackpool Old Road to the west, Chapel Street (the A588) and Higher Green to the east and Hardhorn Road (also the A588) to the south.\nThe Grade II listed White House, an early home of chaplain Harry Viener, stands on the southern side of the square. The town's war memorial, also Grade II listed, was erected in the square in 1921. It was moved to Market Place in August 1979.\nSeveral buildings original to the square have since been demolished, mostly on its northern and northeastern sides. The town's courthouse also formerly stood in the square.\nCatterall & Swarbrick Brewery Ltd. was established at Queen's Brewery in the square in 1880 by William Catterall and John Swarbrick. Catterall was the original owner of Queen's Brewery.\nFile:Queen's Square, Poulton-le-Fylde.jpg|Queen's Square in the 19th century, looking west from Chapel Street.
