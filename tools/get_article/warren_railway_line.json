It is a –long branch from the Main West line at the town of Nevertire and heads in a northerly direction to the town of Warren. The line opened in 1898 and is used for grain haulage.\nCurrent state\nThe line is unballasted which causes severe speed restrictions over the entire branch. The Auscott siding at Snakes Plain serves an adjacent cotton processing facility which opened in 1995. Today the line has been proposed for closure due to its condition.\nReferences"
