They are an electronica DJ duo from the United Kingdom. Legend says that they were formed over a pint of beer at Charlie's Mom's pub in London, England. They are currently signed to the Om Records label, and have done work for many of their compilations, such as the Om Lounge series. Their style consists of a mixture of funk, soul, Latin, jazz, and hip hop, with some electronic elements such as synthesizers and drum machines. Some of their music, such as the song \"Blue Mosque\", are influenced by Middle Eastern.\nTheir third album, nufoundfunk, released in 2000, was especially well-reviewed. Sharon O'Connell of The Times called it \"an impressively savvy swing through neo-funk, ambient house, jazz'n'bass, hip-hop and soul.\" DJ Magazine called it one of the best of the year.\nDiscography\nAlbums\n*The Imperial Solution – debut LP, released 1998\n*Enter The Throne Room – released 1999\n*nufoundfunk – released 2000\n*Indian Summer – released 2002\n*The Score – released 2008\n*Return of The King – released 2021\nRemixes\n*J Boogie's Dubtronic Science\n*Naked Music NYC\n*Charlie Parker\nRemixes of King Kooba\n*Michael Tello\n*Afro-Mystik\n*Kaskade\n*Ski Oakenfull\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010504/http://om-records.com/artists/king_kooba Om Records Official Page]"
