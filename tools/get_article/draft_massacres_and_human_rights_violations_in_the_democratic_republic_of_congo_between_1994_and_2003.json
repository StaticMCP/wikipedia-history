A mission of the United Nations (UN) was then tasked to investigate war crimes committed in the DRC, but did not succeed to conduct independent research at the time.\nFollowing the discovery of common graves in Rutshuru in North Kivu, the UN put together a new investigation mission, the DRC Mapping Exercise, to investigate again on massacres committed in DRC between 1993 and 2003. On October 1st, 2010, the Mapping Exercise Report is published. It indicates 617 violent incidents suggesting the possibility that \"grave human rights and/or international law violations have been committed on the DRC territory between March 1993 and June 2003\". Since its release, few of these crimes have been judged and the report recommendations have not been acted upon, which Denis Mukwege, Nobel Peace Prize awardee in 2018, denounces\nThese massacres have sometimes been referred to in the media as the Congolese genocide, often in the perspective of confirming the double genocide thesis, that presents the Rwandan Hutus as the initially oppressed ethnic group, and according to which, the massacres targeting the Rwandan Tutsis, committed spontaneously by the Hutus, were in reaction to those planned and done by the Rwandan Patriotic Front during their invasion of Rwanda. This theory is rejected by historians such as Jean-Pierre Chrétien, Gérard Prunier or Alison Des Forges.\n:Category:Wartime sexual violence\n:Category:History of Uganda\n:Category:History of Rwanda\n:Category:Violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\n:Category:Second Congo War\n:Category:Military history of the Democratic Republic of the Congo\n:Category:History of the Democratic Republic of the Congo\n:Category:WikiProject Angola articles\n:Category:WikiProject Zimbabwe articles\n:Category:WikiProject Burundi articles\n:Category:WikiProject Africa articles"
