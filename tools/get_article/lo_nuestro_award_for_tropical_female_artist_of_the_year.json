The Lo Nuestro Awards were first awarded in 1989 and has been given annually since to recognize the most talented performers of Latin music. The nominees and winners were originally selected by a voting poll conducted among program directors of Spanish-language radio stations in the United States and also based on chart performance on Billboard Latin music charts, with the results being tabulated and certified by the accounting firm Deloitte. At the present time, the winners are selected by the audience through an online survey. The trophy awarded is shaped in the form of a treble clef. This category originally was awarded as Tropical Salsa Artist of the Year (1989-1992), and from 1993 onwards was separated as Female Artist of the Year and Male Artist of the Year.\nThe award was first presented to Dominican singer Angela Carrasco in 1993. Puerto-Rican American performer Olga Tañón holds the record for the most awards with 13, out of seventeen nominations. Tañón also has become the most awarded in Lo Nuestro Awards history, with 25 accolades. Cuban singers Celia Cruz and Gloria Estefan, awarded three and two times, respectively, are the only multiple winners beside Tañón. Puerto-Rican singer India is the most nominated performer without a win, with 12 unsuccessful nominations.\nWinners and nominees\nListed below are the winners of the award and the nominees for each year.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:%;\"| Key\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:%;\"| Meaning\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86\"|\n|Indicates the winner\n|}\n(pictured in 1980), three-time winner and five-time nominee]]\n(pictured in 2009), two-time winner out of seven nominations]]\n(pictured in 2011), eight-time nominee]]\n(pictured in 2007), winner in 2010]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"background:#bebebe;\"\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:1%;\"| Year\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\"| Performer\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:1%;\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 | 1993 (5th)\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |\n|rowspan=4|\n|-\n| India\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 | 1994 (6th)\n|style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |\n|rowspan=4|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 | 1995 (7th)\n|style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |\n|rowspan=4|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n| India\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 | 1996 (8th)\n|style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |\n|rowspan=4|\n|-\n|\n|-\n| India\n|-\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 | 1997 (9th)\n|style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |\n|rowspan=4|\n|-\n|\n|-\n| Gisselle\n|-\n| Jessica\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 | 1998 (10th)\n|style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |\n|rowspan=4|\n|-\n| Albita\n|-\n|\n|-\n| India\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 | 1999 (11th)\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |\n|rowspan=4|\n|-\n| Gisselle\n|-\n| India\n|-\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 | 2000 (12th)\n|style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |\n|rowspan=4|\n|-\n| Gisselle\n|-\n| India\n|-\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 | 2001 (13th)\n|style=\"background:#FAEB86\" | Gisselle\n|rowspan=4 |\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 | 2002 (14th)\n|style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |\n|rowspan=4 |\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 | 2003 (15th)\n|style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |\n|rowspan=4 |\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 | 2004 (16th)\n|style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |\n|rowspan=4 |\n|-\n| India\n|-\n|\n|-\n| Sophy\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 | 2005 (17th)\n|style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |\n|rowspan=4 |\n|-\n|\n|-\n| India\n|-\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 | 2006 (18th)\n|style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |\n|rowspan=4 |\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 | 2007 (19th)\n|style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |\n|rowspan=4 |\n|-\n| Gisselle\n|-\n| India\n|-\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 | 2008 (20th)\n|style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |\n|rowspan=4 |\n|-\n|\n|-\n| Fanny Lú\n|-\n| India\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 | 2009 (21st)\n|style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |\n|rowspan=4 |\n|-\n|\n|-\n| Fanny Lú\n|-\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=3 | 2010 (22nd)\n|style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |\n|rowspan=3 |\n|-\n|\n|-\n| Marala\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=5 | 2011 (23rd)\n|style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |\n|rowspan=5 |\n|-\n| Alexandra\n|-\n| India\n|-\n|\n|-\n| Margarita \"La Diosa de la Cumbia\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 | 2012 (24th)\n|style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |\n|rowspan=4 |\n|-\n| India\n|-\n| Santaye\n|-\n| Sohanny\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 | 2013 (25th)\n|style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |\n|rowspan=4 |\n|-\n| Ámbar\n|-\n| Fanny Lú\n|-\n| Leslie Grace\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=5 | 2014 (26th)\n|style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |\n|rowspan=5|\n|-\n| Ámbar\n|-\n| Fanny Lú\n|-\n| Leslie Grace\n|-\n| Gretchen\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* List of music awards honoring women\nReferences"
