He sought alliances with the Khalka Mongols, the Ming dynasty, and the Yehe Jurchens to counter the power of Nurhaci and his Later Jin dynasty.\nWar\nIn 1619, Ligdan Khan attacked Guangning, a horse trading town under the protection of Nurhaci. He was defeated.\nArbitrary treatment of his allies led to their defection to the Jurchens from 1622 to 1624.\nAnother attack by Ligdan in 1625 was turned back by a combined Khorchin–Jurchen force.\nIn 1627, Ligdan attacked the Khorchins for blocking his access to the horse trade. However he was turned back and forced further west, where he attacked the Tumed Mongols, taking Köke Khota from Boshtu Khan.\nIn 1628, Ligdan was defeated by a Mongol alliance at Juu Khota.\nIn 1629, Ligdan attacked the Ming dynasty at Datong and extracted a large subsidies from them.\nIn 1631, Ligdan launched a last offensive against the Khorchin, however his allies deserted him.\nIn 1632, Ligdan came under attack from Hong Taiji. In 1634, he fled west but died of smallpox at Qinghai Lake, and the Chahars were incorporated into the Eight Banners.\nAftermath\n, paying respect to Nurhaci in 1606]]\nThe defeat of Ligdan Khan in 1634, in addition to winning the allegiance of the Southern Mongol hordes, brought a vast supply of horses to the Qing dynasty (renamed from the Later Jin dynasty in 1636), while denying the same supply to the Ming. The Qing also captured the Great Seal of the Mongol Khans, giving them the opportunity to portray themselves as heirs of the Yuan dynasty as well.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*"
