The ceremony was hosted by Russell Brand for the 2nd consecutive year.\nBeyoncé, Green Day, and Lady Gaga were tied for the most-awarded acts of the night, winning three awards each. Beyoncé's \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" won the award for Video of the Year, while Beyoncé and Lady Gaga were both tied for the largest number of nominations with nine, followed by Britney Spears with seven. In the aftermath of his June 2009 death, the show featured various tributes to Michael Jackson, including an opening act featuring a medley of Jackson's biggest hits and a special appearance by Janet Jackson to perform her duet \"Scream\", a eulogy from Madonna, and the premiere of a trailer for the posthumous documentary film ''Michael Jackson's This Is It''.\nThe ceremony was marred by an incident in which Kanye West interrupted Taylor Swift's acceptance of the award for Best Female Video, in order to proclaim that despite her victory, Beyoncé still had \"one of the best videos of all time\", referring to the aforementioned \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\". When Beyoncé was eventually awarded Video of the Year, she acknowledged the moment when she had won her first VMA as part of Destiny's Child, and invited Swift back onstage to finish her acceptance speech. The incident was highly publicized, with Rolling Stone naming it the \"wildest\" moment in the history of the VMAs in 2013.\nThe broadcast was seen by a total of 9&nbsp;million viewers, a 17% increase over 2008, making it the most-watched VMAs since 2004.\nPerformances\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Performer(s)\n!Song(s)\n|-\n!colspan=2|Main show\n|-\n|  This Is It Backup DancersJanet Jackson\n|| Tribute to Michael Jackson\"Thriller\"\"Bad\"\"Smooth Criminal\"\"Scream\" (with Jackson)\n|-\n|  Katy PerryJoe Perry\n|| \"We Will Rock You\"\n|-\n|  Taylor Swift\n| \"You Belong with Me\"\n|-\n|  Lady Gaga\n|| \"Poker Face\" (intro)\"Paparazzi\"\n|-\n|  Green Day\n|| \"East Jesus Nowhere\"\n|-\n|  Beyoncé\n|| \"Sweet Dreams\" (intro)\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\"\n|-\n|  Muse\n|| \"Uprising\" (from the Walter Kerr Theatre)\n|-\n|  Pink\n|| \"Sober\"\n|-\n|  Jay-ZAlicia Keys\n|| \"Empire State of Mind\"\n|}\nHouse band performances\nRapper Wale and go-go band UCB served as the house band for the show, performing right before, during, and right after commercial breaks.

One of the best videos of all time!\", referring to the music video for \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\". As the live audience booed, West shrugged his shoulders, handed the microphone back to Swift, and walked off stage as he flipped off the audience.\nWest was subsequently removed from the show. Later in the show, Beyoncé won Video of the Year for \"Single Ladies\" and called Swift back onstage to let her finish her speech.\nVarious celebrities and industry figures, as well as prominent political figures including then United States President Barack Obama, former President Jimmy Carter, and future President Donald Trump condemned West for his verbal outburst at Swift. West apologized on his blog and during an appearance on The Jay Leno Show.\nEmil Wilbekin, managing editor of Essence magazine, argued that West went too far with his actions, compared to the past: \"I think that it was not Kanye's place to speak for Beyoncé or to ruin Taylor Swift's moment...  It's OK for Kanye to rattle off about himself, but I think he crossed the line when he decided to speak for other people.\" Los Angeles Times contributor Ann Powers opined that \"from one vantage point, it was a case of chivalry gone horribly wrong\" as West meant to \"stand up for\" Beyoncé. Powers was cynical about the onstage embrace Beyoncé and Swift shared, calling it \"staged\" and stating that it added \"another layer of meaning to an already complicated moment. Now this controversy was about women sticking up for each other, too.\"\nIn 2013, Rolling Stone named the incident the wildest moment in VMA history. The outburst resulted in a meme consisting of images of West being superimposed onto other images with text in the style of his interruption as a snowclone (\"X is one of the greatest Y of all time\", or variants thereon, in some cases preceded by \"I'm really happy for you\" and/or \"I'mma let you finish\").\" West later referenced the incident in his 2016 single \"Famous\", controversially claiming that he made Swift famous through it.\nSee also\n*2009 MTV Europe Music Awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090716032752/http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/2009/ Official VMA 2009 site]"
