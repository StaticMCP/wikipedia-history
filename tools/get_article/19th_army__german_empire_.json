It was formed in France on 4 February 1918 from the former South Army command.  It served exclusively on the Western Front and was dissolved on 24 January 1919.\nHistory\n19th Army was one of three armies (along with 17th Army and 18th Army) formed in late 1917 / early 1918 with forces withdrawn from the Eastern Front.  They were in place to take part in Ludendorff's German spring offensive.  The Germans had realised that their only remaining chance of victory was to defeat the Allies before the overwhelming human and matériel resources of the United States could be deployed. They also had the temporary advantage in numbers afforded by nearly 50 divisions freed by the Russian withdrawal from the war (Treaty of Brest-Litovsk).  It was still in existence when the war ended, serving on the Western Front as part of Heeresgruppe Herzog Albrecht von Württemberg.\nOrder of Battle, 30 October 1918\nBy the end of  World War I, the majority of the units assigned were lower quality Landwehr Divisions indicative of the relatively quiet sector that the Army was operating in.\n{| style=\"float: right;\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"font-size: 100%; border: gray solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center;\"\n|- style=\"background-color:grey; color:black;\"\n! colspan=\"3\" | Organization of 19th Army on 30 October 1918\n|-\n|- style=\"background-color:grey; color:black;\"\n!
