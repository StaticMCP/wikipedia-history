On 9 June 2022, it was announced that the club had been promoted to the tier 3 Ardal NW League for the 2022–23 season via the vacancy route.\nFamous Past Players\nHawarden Rangers has a rich history of past players that have gone on to professional level, most notably;\n* Barry Horne: Retired, ex-Everton F.C. defender who earned 59 caps for Wales.\n* Ian Rush: Retired, former Liverpool F.C. and Wales striker who also had a stint as manager of Chester City.\n* Michael Owen: Retired, previously of Liverpool F.C., Real Madrid, Newcastle, Manchester United & Stoke City.
