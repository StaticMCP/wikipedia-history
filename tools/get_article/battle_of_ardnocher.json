The Normans were defeated. The Annales Hiberniae records that on 10 August 1329, Crown forces led by Thomas Butler attacked the fort of Ardnurcher (now the village of Horseleap) but were defeated by William Gallda MacGeoghegan. It says that Butler was killed along with several others of high rank and 140 soldiers. The Annals of the Four Masters offers a different account, giving the date as 1328 and saying that 3,500 Normans were killed.\nSee also\n* Battle of Druim Dearg, 1260AD\n* Battle of Ath an Chip, 1270AD\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Battle of ardnocher\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of Ardnocher"
