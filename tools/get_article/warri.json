Warri City is one of the major hubs of the petroleum industry in Nigeria. Warri, Udu, Okpe and Uvwie are the commercial capital of Delta State with a population of over 311,970 people in 2006. The city is the indigenous territory of Itsekiri, Urhobo and Ijaw people.\nWarri shares boundaries with Uvwie to the east, Udu to the south east, Ogbe-ijoh to the south, and other communities in Warri South LGA to the west. Due to its rapid population growth and linked roads, the city and its border towns, e.g. Uvwie, Udu merged into a conurbation collectively referred as \"Warri\".\nWarri sits on the bank of Warri River which joined Forcados River and Escravos River through Jones Creek in the lower Niger Delta Region. The city has a modern seaport, which serves as the cargo transit point between the Niger River and the Atlantic Ocean for import and export.\nWarri served as the capital of the colonial Warri Province during the early 1900s when this part of Delta State was under the Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria.\nHistory\nEtymology\nThe name 'WARRI' was first associated with the Itsekiri ancestral capital town of Ode Itsekiri which the locals also refer to as 'Iwere'. A mispronunciation of Iwere by several European explorers probably resulted in various names like AWERRI, OWHERE, OERE, OUWERE, WARRE, WARREE, etc. The British eventually anglancised it as WARRI.\nThe area encompassing present-day Warri South, Warri South West, and Warri North, which constitutes the independent territory of the historic Kingdom of Warri, derives its name from the kingdom's capital, Ode-Itsekiri. This is corroborated by French navigator and trader Jean Barbot, who visited Warri in the late 17th century. In his account, Barbot described the capital as follows:\n}}\nBritish Advent pre Warri City\nBritish colonialism effectively took off in the Western Niger Delta with the proclamation of the Oil Coast Protectorate by Great Britain in June 1885. British colonial administration was carried out through local chiefs like Nana Olomu of Ebrohimi in Benin River. This administration was effectively restricted to Benin River and its environs as the British were content with conducting trade with the people of the hinterlands through the Itsekiri as middlemen.\nCreation of Warri City\nThe British decided to move the seat of the administration of the Niger Coast Protectorate from the capital Ode-Itsekiri (Warri or Iwerre) to the uplands to have effective control of the hinterlands. In order to achieve this, the British in 1906 took a lease of a new trading station opened in 1898 on virgin lands for Alexander Miller Brothers Limited of Liverpool at the mouth of the Okere Creeks. This new trading station was also named WARRI after the capital Ode-Itsekiri so the Itsekiris dubbed Ode-Itsekiri BIG WARRI in order to differentiate Ode-Itsekiri from the new trading station.\nWarri Land Ownership Disputes\nWarri (Warri South, Warri Southwest, and Warri North) has a history of land ownership disputes involving the itsekiri, Urhobo, and Ijaw communities. Over 25 court cases have addressed land matters in Warri, with six specifically concerning the city's overall ownership.\nUrhobo Claims\nThe Agbassa Urhobo community has pursued several legal claims to assert ownership over the entire Warri, primarily against the Itsekiri, represented by the Olu of Warri or Itsekiri Communal Land Trustees. Key cases include:\n* Ogegede v. Dore Numa (1925): The Agbassa Urhobo claimed rents for portions of land leased to the government by itsekiri's. The Supreme Court of Nigeria dismissed the claim, finding no evidence to support Urhobo ownership.\n* Ometan v. Chief Dore Numa (1926): The Agbassa Urhobo sought a declaration of title over Warri lands. The court ruled that the Itsekiri, under the Olu, held overlordship, with Agbassa recognized as customary tenants.\n* Agbassa Appeals (1931, 1933): Appeals to the Full Court (1931) and Privy Council (1933) upheld the 1926 ruling, affirming Itsekiri overlordship over Agbassa lands.\n* Other Agbassa Cases (1941–1973): Cases including W/44/1941, W/3/1949, W/121/57, W/41/57, SC.67/1971, and SC.327/1972 consistently recognized the Itsekiri’s radical title and possessory rights over Agbassa lands, with Agbassa people as customary tenants.\n* Idudun v. Okumagba (SC/309/74): The Okumagba family (Urhobo) secured possessory rights to 281.1 acres along Okumagba Avenue based on traditional evidence and acts of ownership. As the defendants did not counterclaim for title, the radical title remained with the Olu of Warri.\nIjaw Claims\nThe Ijaw communities, particularly in Ogbe-Ijoh and Gbaramatu, have contested land ownership in Warri, often against the Itsekiri:\n* Chief Apoh v. Perememighan (1928) & Chief Apoh and Chief Okotie v. Pere (1938): The court affirmed Itsekiri occupancy rights over disputed lands and rivers, allowing Ijaws to use them with permission from the Itsekiri, recognizing the Olu of Warri’s overlordship.\n* Suit W/116/56 (1956): Justice Obaseki granted the Itsekiri possessory title to Aruteghan Creek and surrounding lands, with the Olu of Warri holding radical title, affirming Ijaws as customary tenants.\n* Suit W/148/56 (1956): Chief Isuokumo Oloiki and others, representing Ijaw settlers in Ogbe-Ijoh, claimed ownership of large portions of Warri Division. After prolonged litigation, the Ijaws withdrew their claim, and Justice Rhodes Vivour barred them from future claims against the Itsekiri Communal Land Trustees.\n* Appeal of Chief Isuokumo Oloiki (1967): The Ijaws appealed the 1956 ruling (Suit W/148/56) to the Supreme Court (SC/450/65). Acting Chief Justice Sir Lionel Brett dismissed the appeal on April 24, 1967, permanently barring Ijaws of Ogbe-Ijoh from claiming ownership of Ogbe-Ijoh or other Warri Division lands.\n* Gbaramatu Cases (1946, 1962, 1973): In cases like W/20/46 and SC.37/1973, courts ruled that Ijaws in Gbaramatu were customary tenants under the Itsekiri, with the Olu of Warri holding radical title.\nSupreme Court rulings have consistently affirmed the Itsekiri’s radical and possessory titles over most Warri lands, with the Olu of Warri or Itsekiri Communal Land Trustees recognized as overlords. The Okumagba (urhobo) family holds possessory rights over 281.1 acres along Okumagba Avenue, while the Agbassa Urhobo, Gbaramatu Ijaw, and Ogbe-Ijoh Ijaw communities are customary tenants under the Itsekiri, with the Olu of Warri retaining radical title. Despite these rulings on the ownership of Warri lands, some Urhobo and Ijaw groups continued to assert ownership claims over Warri.\nDemographics\nIts inhabitants are predominantly Christians of different denominations, and some practice a mixture of African traditional religions like most of Southern Nigeria.
