It is endemic to São Tomé, an island off the west coast of Africa in the Gulf of Guinea and was first described by the Italian ornithologist Tommaso Salvadori in 1902 under the binomial name Corythornis thomensis.  A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2008 showed that the São Tomé kingfisher is a subspecies of the malachite kingfisher.\nIts' habitat includes forest, inland wetlands, marine intertidal areas, marine coastal areas, and urban areas.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Sao Tome Kingfisher\n\n#REDIRECT São Tomé kingfisher\n\n---\n\n## São Tomé Kingfisher\n\n#REDIRECT São Tomé kingfisher\n}}\n\n---\n\n## Sao Tome kingfisher\n\n#REDIRECT São Tomé kingfisher"
