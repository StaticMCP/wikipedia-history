With her companion dog King she saves a young woman, and the wealthy father rewards her with the gift of $1,000. Her stepmother plots to get rid of Selah so that she will get the money. With her henchman Chuck Purdy and her half-wit son Bud, she captures the runaway Selah and hold her captive in a cave.
