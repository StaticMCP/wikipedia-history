Among the features Davies listed were planned English settlement, the appropriation of Welsh land, the construction of the Ring of Iron, and the introduction of new administrative and legal orders such as the Statute of Rhuddlan, and the fact that the top-level administrators of these new orders were very rarely Welsh.\nIn his 1984 book South Wales and the Rising of 1839: Class Struggle as Armed Struggle historian Ivor Wilks wrote that the Conquest of Wales by Edward I \"marked the final stages in the reduction of Wales to the status of an English colony,\" saying that \"government and commerce came to be dominated by settlers, for the most part from England, on lands appropriated for the purpose.\" According to Wilks, the Glyndŵr rebellion was \"the great anti-colonial struggle of the early fifteenth century,\" and eventually, after the rebellion's failure, \"the colonial status of Wales was finally legislated out of existence by acts of the English Parliament of 1536 and 1542.\"\nIn his 1989 book The British Isles: A History of Four Nations, historian Hugh Kearney argued that \"a colonial society was delineated more clearly in Wales than anywhere else in the British Isles\" under Norman rule, citing English settlement in Wales leading to a situation where \"without the numerical backing of English tenants, it would have been impossible for the Normans to make the inroads which they did. By the early fourteen century, much of the best land in Wales was occupied by the Normans and their tenants. Each lordship had its 'Englishry' of good land and its 'Welshry' of poorer land. In the one, Norman law operated, in the other, Welsh.\"\nIn his 2017 book The Jews of Wales: A History, Cai Parry-Jones of the British Library wrote that \"Wales has often been perceived by both the Welsh and the non-Welsh as a nation that is devoid of racial prejudice and intolerance,\" saying that the myth stems in part from \"a long-held belief that the Welsh, having been economically and culturally ‘oppressed’ by the English for centuries, are inclined to empathise with other oppressed people and minorities.\" According to Jones, the emphasis on England as the Welsh \"significant other\" have led to the relationship between Wales and minorities within Wales being understudied.\nIn 2019, Martin Johnes of Swansea University published a book titled Wales – England’s Colony? addressing the debates.\nDebates among politicians\nIn a 2009 speech to the Institute of Welsh Politics, MP Adam Price, who would later become leader of Plaid Cymru, argued that \"Wales, for much of its history an anomaly, today finds itself anomalous again. Before the Act of Union we were a conquered nation that was never fully subdued. Post-devolution we're a post-colonial country still waiting to be decolonised. It is these contradictions that describe our present predicament: we are a hybrid state living in the cracks between a dependent past and an independent future.\" In his speech, Price argued that \"what was tried and tested here, soon became the template\" for English imperialism and that English rule over Wales preceded English over Ireland, saying that \"whatever the Irish suffered, we sadly suffered first.\" In 2020, during the George Floyd protests in the United Kingdom, Price stated that he \"would also want to give much greater emphasis than I did to Wales’s own guilt and complicity in Britain’s crimes against humanity... Wales’ experience of privilege and powerlessness is not a simple binary but a complex relationship where being the expropriator and being expropriated are subtly intertwined.\"\nDebates in wider society\nAccording to Richard Phillips, the idea that Wales was an English colony was present in the writing and activism of Welsh travel writer Jan Morris, saying that Morris had a sensitivity to \"internal colonialism\" that enriched her writing about places like Hong Kong, Panama, and Canada.\nReferences"
