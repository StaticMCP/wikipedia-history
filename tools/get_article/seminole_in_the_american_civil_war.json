The Seminole Nation in the Trans-Mississippi Theater had split alliances. However, the majority of the tribe in the Western territories joined the Union Army under the leadership of Billy Bowlegs.}} Others, such as John Jumper, supported the Confederacy. The Florida Seminole participated in some skirmishing in central Florida. They were likely at the Battle of Olustee in February 1864.\nTrans-Mississippi Theater\n(Hemha Micco) was a colonel of the Confederate Army during the American Civil War.]]\nIn 1884, The Philadelphia Inquirer stated that nearly all of the Seminoles \"espoused the cause of the Union\" and because all of the neighboring tribes (Choctaws, Chickasaws, Cherokees, and Creeks) \"almost unanimously joined the Southern Confederacy, it was neither agreeable nor safe for the Seminoles to continue living in the Indian Territory.\" As the Seminole fled south, across the U.S.-Mexican border, \"they were attacked by a Confederate regiment and their principal chieftain [Billy Bowlegs] killed.\" The remaining Seminoles crossed into Mexico and remained there until after the Civil War.\nThe Seminole Nation, those who didn't move to Mexico, was led by John Jumper. Jumper's Seminole name was \"Hemha Micco.\" He was commissioned in the Confederacy as a major and then as an \"honorary lieutenant colonel\". He was in the battles of Round Mountain, Chusto-Talasah, Middle Boggy, and Second Cabin Creek.\nOrganization\nThe Seminole Nation organized into companies, battalions, and regiments.\n*First Seminole Battalion (Mounted Volunteers)\n**The First Seminole Battalion was organized on September 21, 1861.\n**Field & Staff: Major John Jumper\n**Companies: Company A (Captain George Cloud) and Company B (Captain Fushatchie Cochokna)\n*First Seminole Regiment (Mounted Volunteers)\n**The First Seminole Battalion re-organized as the 1st Seminole Regiment on July 1, 1864.\n**Field & Staff: Colonel John Jumper, Major George Cloud, Charles C. Dyer (A.Q.M.), D. R. Patterson (Adjutant), W. W. Burnes ( Assistant Surgeon), Hu McDonald (A.Q.M.)\n**Companies: Company A (Captain Thomas Cloud), Company B (Captain Fushatchie Cochokna), Company C (Captain James Factor), Company D (Captain Tustanucogee), Company E (Captain Sam Hill), and Company F (Captain Osuchee Harjo)\nWestern Theater\nIn Florida, two distinct companies were raised who had Seminole Indians as members of the Confederate Army. Andrew E. Hodges, a white man who lived on the coast near Cedar Key, raised a company of Indian sharp shooters starting in 1862. Hodges' Company not only had Seminole Indians but whites, Hispanics, blacks, and other tribal members in his unit. Seminoles may have played a sharp shooter role at the Battle of Olustee. By July 1864, Hodges had passed his company to Andrew M. McBride. McBride was elected captain and wrote Secretary of War James A. Seddon that the company was ready for service.\n}}\nHodges' Company\nAt the opening of the Civil War, Andrew E. Hodges was living near Cedar Key, Florida. In 1862, he was part of a home guard that navigated the waterways and coasts. Later that year he raised a company of sharp shooters.\nMcBride's Company\nMcBride had mustered 65 individuals on July 7, 1864, at Everglades, Florida. On the muster roll the following was declared, \"We, the undersigned, respectfully volunteer and tender our services to the Confederate States of America, begging to be immediately admitted into their armies, having chosen A. McBride for our Captain.\"}}\nAftermath\nTrans-Mississippi Theater\nReconstruction was a particularly harsh for the Indian nations found west of the Mississippi.\nWestern Theater\nAfter the War ended, the Seminole Indians became reclusive, and their history was obscured. Florida's Seminole Indians continue to live in and around the Everglades.\nBoth Andrew E. Hodges and Andrew McBride survived the War. They lived out the remainder of their lives in Florida.\nSee also\n*Florida in the American Civil War\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=JU002 John Jumper]."
