The expedition included aerial surveys.\nMany geographic features in East Greenland were mapped and named during the expedition. Eskimonaes station was used as a wintering base by the Three-year Expedition to East Greenland.\nHistory\nThe expedition was led by Lauge Koch. The other participants were Danish and Swedish geographers, geologists, archaeologists, zoologists and botanists: Paul Gelting, Gunnar Seidenfaden, Thorvald Sørensen, Steen Hasselbach, Helge G. Backlund, Gunnar Thorson, Gunnar Säve-Söderbergh, Helge Larsen, Thyge Johansen, L. Bruhn, H. Heinrich Nielsen and N. V. Petersen. The expedition vessels were Godthaab and Gustav Holm. The engagement of the Danish state had political connotations, because of the ongoing dispute between Denmark and Norway over East Greenland.\n, first mapped by the Three-year Expedition]]\nSee also\n* Arctic exploration\n* List of Arctic expeditions\n* Cartographic expeditions to Greenland\n* King Frederick VIII Land\n* Cape Brown (Greenland)\nBibliography\n* Thorson, G., ed.
