      "text": "# Treaty of Kerden\n\nTreaty of Kerden (, Persian:عهدنامه گردان) was signed between Ottoman Empire and Afsharid Iran on 4 September 1746. It concluded the Ottoman–Persian War (1743–1746).\nBackground\nDuring the last years of the Safavid dynasty in Iran, Ottomans were able to annex most of Caucasus and west Iran, due to hereditary strife, civil unrest and total chaos. Meanwhile, Afghans were able to annex a part of Khorasan. The shah had to appoint Nadir, an Iranian Afshar Turkoman warlord, as his commander in chief. Under Nadir's brilliant commandship, Iran was able to regain most of her losses. After the victories, it was an easy matter for Nadir to seize the throne. In 1736, Nadir Shah founded the Afsharid dynasty, which lasted until 1796. Nadir Shah was planning to found another great Persian empire, stretching from the Indus to the Bosphorus, like in ancient times. After reconquering former territories of Iran, he further tried to annex the eastern territories of the Ottoman Empire (eastern Anatolia and Iraq). He also proposed to reconcile the two major sects of Islam. (The Ottoman dynasty was of Sunni faith and most Iranians were of Twelver Shia faith.) He planned to force the Ottoman Empire, the most powerful Sunni state, to accept Twelver Shia Islam as a fifth legal school of jurisprudence of Sunni Islam.\nThe terms of the treaty\nThe treaty was signed in Kerden (a location near Qazwin, Iran). The representatives were Hasan Ali Haji (Afsharid side) and Mustafa Nazif (Ottoman side).\n#The boundary line between the two countries was the same boundary line drawn roughly a century earlier according to the Treaty of Zuhab of 1639 (i.e., which included roughly the demarcation of the modern Turkey-Iran and Iraq-Iran border lines).\n#The Ottomans agreed to stop opposing the Afsharid dynasty as the rulers of Iran.\n#The Ottomans also agreed to allow the Iranian hajis (pilgrims) to Mecca (then under Ottoman control).\n#Exchange of consulates () were permitted in both countries.\n#Iran abandoned to force the Ottomans to convert to Shia Islam.\n#Both sides agreed to liberate the prisoners of war.\nReferences and notes\nSources\n*"
