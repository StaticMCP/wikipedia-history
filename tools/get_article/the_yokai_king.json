The series, created by Mark Hattori, is based on the supernatural beings called yōkai from Japanese folklore. It was mainly filmed in various locations of Okinawa, Japan in 2014.\nPlot\nYokai are a class of supernatural creatures that have long held a prominent place in Japanese folklore. They come in a variety of forms, from hideous demons to mischievous creatures to heroes with supernatural powers. They are sometimes dangerous to humans since yokai are not restrained by the laws of nature and those who are not already part animal have the ability to shapeshift.\nThe legend goes that Ippei (Shin Koyamada) was found by his foster father in a coconut shell on a beach. Although he was brought up as a normal boy, Ippei could see nature’s spirits, including kijimuna, invisible to human eyes. As with many legendary heroes, Ippei was initially unaware of his supernatural talents and therefore his destiny.\nCast\n*Shin Koyamada as Ippei\n*Lisa Nakama as Kana\n*Saki as Osaki\n*Kirk Dixon as Nyarl\n*TJ Kayama as Shuten-dōji\n*Nicholas Rush as Shachi\n*Kiki Sukezane as Nuko\n*Vanessa Pan as Gyuki\n*Kingoro Torajima as Tengu\n*Daisuke Onaga as Takeshi\n*Kyoko Fukushi as Hahti\n*Chesuka Hentona as Young Ippei\n*Kougi Inoue as Awati\nProduction\nOn November 11, 2013, Okinawa Entertainment Studio announced the production of the series at the media room of the Okinawa Prefecture Government in Naha, Okinawa Japan.
