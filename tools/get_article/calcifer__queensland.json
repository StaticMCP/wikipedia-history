It is near Calcifer Creek.\nHistory\nThe town's name was derived from a combination of the words calx, cuprum and ferrum, the Latin words for \"limestone\", \"copper\", and \"iron\" respectively. The town was established in 1894, when John Moffat established a copper smelter on the site. At its height in 1898, the town had stores, a branch of the Bank of Australasia, a cricket team, and five hotels.\nThe township was officially proclaimed on 25 March 1899.\nAn accident at the nearby Hobson mine in 1903 killed three men; and by 1907 smelting operations had moved to Chillagoe, and the site was all but deserted. Today, all that remains are the foundations of the smelters and a small cemetery with five graves.\nReferences\nExternal links"
