The medal is intended to recognise those who served as National Service conscripts for the United Kingdom between 1939 and 1960. Some of the proceeds from sale of the medals goes to the poppy appeal. As it is not an official medal it should not be worn.\nDescription\nIt features a lion and a Britannia figure on one side and servicemen on the other. The coloured bands on the ribbon represent the colours of the Union Jack and the Royal British Legion.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.nationaldefencemedal.webs.com UK National Defence Medal]\n* [http://www.awardmedals.com/national-service-full-size-medal-p-794.html?cPath=21_33 The Commemorative National Service Medal at Award Productions]"
