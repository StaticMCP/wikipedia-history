It was never held and was abolished in 1989.\nHistory\nThe rank of  was established on 25 March 1982 by decree of the  (State Council of the GDR), but never bestowed. The  could promote a general to this rank for exceptional military achievement. The rank was an imitation of the supreme Soviet rank, that of Marshal of the Soviet Union.\nSome believe that this rank would only have been granted in wartime and was created as a result of changes in Warsaw Pact military planning. During wartime, a  was to command an operational army group that included all East German forces including Police and Stasi troops. Prior to this change, all East German forces were under the direct control of the Soviet military command.\nIn November 1989, the acting Minister for National Defense, Admiral Theodor Hoffmann, abolished this rank.\nDesign\nSeveral designs were considered for the Marshal shoulder board. The final design was a shoulder board 118&nbsp;mm long and 48&nbsp;mm wide consisting of interlaced gold and silver cord backed by a red cloth material on which was placed a five-pointed, gilded star with a red ruby in the center. According to Klaus Wather's , 12 pairs of these shoulder boards were made.\nDrawings were also made of a Soviet-style \"Marshal's star\" to be worn on a red neck ribbon but this item was never produced.\nAlso planned were Marshal rank insignia for the new field uniform.  This consisted of a 90 x 60&nbsp;mm rectangular badge of stone-grey cloth for mounting on the upper uniform sleeve. On this badge was woven a large five-pointed gold colored star with a red center over a 20&nbsp;mm long horizontal gold bar.  For the cap there was an oval badge 50 × 30&nbsp;mm with the same design as the sleeve insignia.\nOF-10 Marschall der DDR.png|Shoulder board\nGDR Army Arab OF6-9.svg|Collar patches\nMarschall-hat.jpg|Field uniform cap insignia\nSee also\n* Military ranks of East Germany\n* Corps colours (NPA)\nReferences\n* Klaus H.
