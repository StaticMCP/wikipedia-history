With this treaty, the United Kingdom accepted the 1816 Argentine Declaration of Independence. As the United Kingdom was the most powerful world power of the time, and the United States had announced the Monroe Doctrine, this treaty limited the chances of Spain to reconquer its former colony.\nThe treaty also allowed British subjects to keep their religion, and to build their own churches and cemeteries. This was an unprecedented step in the history of the freedom of religion in Argentina, as it was the first time that a religion other than the Catholic Church was legally allowed in the country. The treaty set as well an agreement to stop the Atlantic slave trade.\nIn the context of the dispute over the Falkland Islands (), Lowell S. Gustafson argues that by signing the Treaty without making any reservation about Argentina's settlement on the islands by 1825, the United Kingdom weakened its claim.\nBibliography\n*[https://treaties.fcdo.gov.uk/responsive/app/consolidatedSearch/#search/v=list,c=1,q=country_name%3D%5BARGENTINA%5D%2Cfield3%3D%5BBI%5D%2Csigned_event_date%3D%5B02%2F02%2F1825%5D%2CqueryType%3D%5B64%5D,sm=s,l=library2_lib,a=t Information on the treaty] at the [https://treaties.fcdo.gov.uk/responsive/app/consolidatedSearch/ Database] of the British Foreign Office\n*[https://tratados.cancilleria.gob.ar/tratado_archivo.php?tratados_id=mKSknQ==&tipo=kg==&id=mKOnmQ==&caso=manuscrito Treaty text] (English and Spanish) at [https://tratados.cancilleria.gob.ar/ Digital Library of Treaties] of the Argentine Cancillería\n* (Spanish and English)\n*\nReferences"
