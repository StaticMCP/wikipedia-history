The siege ended after a rescue effort by the Indonesian Navy on 1 May 2011. It was the first pirate seizure of an Indonesian merchant ship off the Somali coast.\nBackground\nOn 16 March 2011, an Indonesian merchant ship, MV Sinar Kudus, was carrying nickel ore from South Sulawesi to Rotterdam when it was hijacked by Somali pirates in the Red Sea. After negotiations, the ship owner agreed to a ransom demand and restored the ship and crew to Indonesian authorities. It was then hijacked a second time by another group of pirates; after signalling \"mayday\" the ship's crew were supported by a group of Denjaka and Kopassus units of the Indonesian military from KRI Abdul Halim Perdanakusuma which secured the ship. A further group of Denjaka and Kopassus were deployed using a Bo 105 helicopter to strafe the pirates, all of whom were killed.\nThere were plans and preparations for an amphibious landing on Somalia by the Indonesian commanders if the hostages were taken ashore, but as the hostages and ship were rescued at sea, the plan was not executed.\nNotes"
