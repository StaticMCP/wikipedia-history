It automated the reading of input files and conversion of the data inside to produce one or more reports and updated output files.}} Postley felt that the market would be large enough to sell directly to customers without contract work. He asked Bauer for $500,000 to develop a new version for the 360. The company's revenues at the time were about $2 million a year, and this additional expense would not fit within the budget. Bauer offered $50,000 and told Postley to find the rest on his own. Postley quickly did this, finding five customers who were interested in the concept and willing to offer $100,000 each to fund its development. The resulting program, Mark IV, was announced in November 1967. After considerable debate, they listed the product at $30,000. Over the next year, it had generated $1 million in new sales.\nIBM's policy of giving away software made it hard to sell software. Even when a product offered obvious advantages, many prospective customers would not buy it, believing IBM would release something similar in the future. This was a particular sore spot for Applied Data Research's product Autoflow, a system that produced flowcharts by reading the assembler language code for a program. IBM released their own product, Flowcharter, which was nowhere near as useful, but customers believed IBM would add similar features and were willing to wait to see. This eventually led to an antitrust suit by the Federal Trade Commission that led IBM to announce they were no longer going to give away software for free starting on 1 January 1970.\nThis announcement opened the floodgates, and commercial software began to sell in large quantities. Mark IV, now running on the 360, System/370 and RCA Spectra 70 as well as non-IBM-compatible systems, was the first software with sales of a million dollars a year, and the first software product to have cumulative sales of $10 million, and then $100 million.\nThis change also started IBM's efforts to sell their own software. This included Generalized Information System (GIS), a system similar to Mark IV in concept and features. In Australia, IBM began distributing misleading comparisons of GIS vs. Mark IV. AIS contacted IBM headquarters in the US, who agreed to stop mentioning Mark IV in any of their materials.\nIn a 1971 ad by Informatics, there are several quotes from customers, such as:\n:We conservatively estimate that the benefits derived from the Mark IV System have completely returned  the cost of our investment in a period of less than 3 months.\n:Mark IV runs ... handle Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Sales Analyses, etc. on about 26 different factories.\n:We contracted with a programming firm to have a Fixed Assets System implemented in COBOL. After 4 months and $16,000 the system was not completed. Two of our own analysts, after attending a 2-1/2 day MARK IV class, wrote the system in 3 days.\nSale\nMark IV went to Sterling Software in 1985 as part of that company's acquisition of Informatics General. As CA VISION:BUILDER, it became part of the product suite from Computer Associates once that company acquired Sterling Software in 2000.  Following the acquisition of Computer Associates by Broadcom Inc in 2018, CA VISION:BUILDER was listed as a legacy product by the new owner.\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://archive.org/details/TNM_Mark_IV_File_Management_System_for_IBM_360_-__20180209_0291/page/n3/mode/2up Mark IV brochure].\n*[http://purl.umn.edu/107108 Oral history interview with Walter F.
