Research continued through World War II to (1) reduce visibility by painting vertical surfaces to harmonize with the horizon and horizontal surfaces to blend with the sea, or (2) confuse identity and course by painting obtrusive patterns on vertical surfaces. Some camouflage methods served both purposes.  American captains were permitted less freedom of interpretation with these schemes (other than Measure 12 Modified) than their British Commonwealth counterparts applied to Admiralty camouflage schemes.\nEarly measures\nWith the likelihood of the United States entering the war, and after experiments with various paint schemes conducted in association with the 1940 Fleet Problem (exercise), the Bureau of Ships (BuShips) directed in January 1941 that the peacetime color of overall #5 Standard Navy Gray, a light gloss shade with a linseed oil base, be replaced with matte Dark Gray, #5-D, a new paint formulation with a synthetic alkyd resin base.  Rather than waste the large quantities of Standard Gray already in inventory and aboard ships, BuShips directed the issuance of a black tinting paste (5-BP) which when mixed in stated proportions with Standard Gray would yield a close approximation of 5-D, with issue of the new paint in pre-mixed form to follow. BuShips also issued Ship Camouflage Instructions (SHIPS-2), laying out 9 painting schemes to be used throughout the Navy. Rather than issue premixed quantities of the less-used new shades, Light Gray (5-L) and Ocean Gray (5-O), yards and supply depots were directed to issue an untinted base paint (5-U) together with a blue-black tinting material (5-TM) which when mixed according to instructions would turn 5-U into either Light or Ocean Gray.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The tinting paste was altered to contain somewhat less black and more blue than before; this meant that Ocean Gray also became somewhat more bluish in cast at this time and all the 5-series paint colors now were categorized as Munsell 5 Purple-Blue. Until 1945 all USN \"gray\" and almost all \"blue\" shades were produced using this same blue-black tint (5-TMa), so that the paints represented different tones of what was effectively a single blue-gray hue.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

On 19 July Measure 12 had been prescribed for the entire Atlantic Fleet, and on 13 September Measure 11 for the Pacific. However, there was considerable time lag between the issuance of new instructions, and paint being manufactured and distributed and ships actually being repainted; at the time of the Pearl Harbor attack on December 7, 1941, most of the Pacific Fleet was still wearing dark gray Measure 1.\nIn November aircraft carriers began applying a dark blue-gray flight deck stain (#250) approximately the same color as Deck Blue, together with a stain approximately Ocean Gray for flight deck markings (#251). The Pacific Fleet's surface ships, less carriers, were ordered into Measure 11 on 16 December 1941. The order also substituted 5-N for 5-S\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Revised Prewar Measures (SHIPS-2 Rev. 1, Sept 1941)\n! Name !! Description !!

All visible canvas boat covers, tarpaulins and windscreens to be dyed in a color to match Deck Blue. It was used in the Pacific and Mediterranean for concealment from aircraft. Royal Navy submarines operating in the Mediterranean used a similar scheme. During the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway, ships wearing Measure 11 came under attack less often than ships wearing Measure 12.\n| align=center |\nin summer 1941 wearing experimental Measure 1B (note the light gray 5-L on the mast above the funnel and director), a precursor of Measure 11.\n|- id=\"Measure 12\" style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| Measure&nbsp;12Measure 12 (Modified) || Sea Blue on the hull up to the main deck (hangar deck on aircraft carriers), Ocean Gray from main deck level to the top of the superstructure masses, and Haze Gray (5-H) for masts and other vertical projections above superstructure level. Horizontal surfaces painted Deck Blue. Canvas dyed blue. Sea Blue was later darkened to Navy Blue (Measure 12A). It was found to be ineffective against aerial observation during the early carrier aircraft battles of Coral Sea and Midway, so all-blue Measure 11 and its replacement Measure 21 became preferred in the Pacific.\nIn Measure 12 (Modified), irregular patches or splotches were added to break up the ship's profile: Haze Gray splotches on Sea Blue (later Navy Blue) and vice versa, and Sea Blue (later Navy Blue) splotches on Ocean Gray. \"These splotches should be obtained by extending the Navy Blue paint into the designated Ocean Gray paint area and vice versa. They should be about 1/3 the area of a rectangle 12 feet high by 20 feet long.\" There were no specific instructions on the positioning or shape of the splotches, which were left up to individual captains, yards or maintenance facilities, and the recommended size was frequently disregarded, so that no two ships looked alike.  Measure 12 (Mod) was used extensively in both fleets during 1942. Unfortunately the splotches in most cases were too small to break up the ship's outline effectively, and at any distance resolved into simple gray.\n| align=center | wearing measure 12\nwearing Measure 12 (Modified)\nwearing measure 12 (Modified).\n|- id=\"Measure 13\" style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| Measure&nbsp;13 || Haze Gray (5-H) overall, with horizontal surfaces Deck Blue.

It would prove useful against submarines in any area where attacks occur mostly at night.\" Purity of color was important for full realization of the Purkinje effect where some colors appear lighter and some appear darker at low levels of illumination. Darkening the pattern increased course deception, but increased visibility at night and in haze. This measure was used extensively through 1943 and early 1944 in North Atlantic and Aleutian waters until replaced by Measure 33. s were delivered to the Royal Navy wearing this measure sometimes identified as the 'American Western Approaches' camouflage scheme.\n| align=center |\nShips-2 pattern drawing for Measure 16 on a submarine chaser\n|- id=\"Measure 17\" style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| Measure&nbsp;17 ||  A dazzle pattern of blues, grays and whites applied only to , , and ; Measure 17 was the prototype for the later dazzle Measures 31, 32 and 33.\n| align=center |\nwearing measure 17.\n|- id=\"Measure 18\" style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| Measure&nbsp;18|| A rarely used pattern almost identical to Measure 12, but with Haze Gray instead of Ocean Gray upperworks, as in the later Measure 22.||\n|}\nWithin the first six months of combat, the United States Navy modified Measures 11 and 12 to meet the needs of Pacific Ocean operations. Sea Blue was found to be too light, and it was ordered replaced by new color Navy Blue (5-N), which used 50% more of the same tinting paste as Sea Blue and was correspondingly darker.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Submarine Measure 10 was Ocean Gray (5-0) on entire submarine above the water line, over all parts which were visible from the air including the numbers, capstan, running light boards and bridge rails. The radio insulators were to be dark and there was no boot-topping. Dull antifouling black paint was to be applied below the waterline.\n|\n|- id=\"Measure 21\" style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| Measure&nbsp;21 || On the advice of United States aviators, Measure 11's Sea Blue was replaced by darker Navy Blue and the scheme designated Measure 21 in mid-1942. Overall Navy Blue (5-N), with decks in dark Deck Blue (20-B). This measure was used extensively in the western and southern Pacific from September 1942 through 1945 to minimize detection and identification by enemy aircraft. \"Useful where greatest danger is from the air and high surface visibility must be accepted... Lowest visibility to aerial observers day and night in all types of weather. Low visibility under searchlight. High visibility to all surface observers in all types of weather.\" Measure 21 also proved effective under artificial illumination during night actions. Upper surfaces of aircraft operating from carrier decks were painted a similar shade of blue. Sailors were ordered to wear dungarees rather than white uniforms when topside, and white \"Dixie cup\" hats were dyed blue. The  is painted (as of 2022-2025 restoration) in Measure 21 as she was in 1945.\n| align=center|\nwearing measure 21.\n|- id=\"Measure 22\" style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| Measure&nbsp;22 || Measure 12 was reworked following recognition of the ineffectiveness of small splotches of paint, and the relatively low contrast between the shades used. Replacement measure 22 used Navy Blue low on the hull below the first continuous deck, with Haze Gray above that. Measure 22 used a straight horizontal boundary between the two colors rather than following the sheer of the main deck, making a characteristic gray \"wedge\" at the bow. This bold contrast at a horizontal line near the horizon reduced visibility to surface observers and created the illusion of greater range. This measure largely replaced Measure 12 where aerial observation was unlikely. \"Useful for combatant ships operating in areas where greatest danger might be expected from gunnery action either from shore batteries or from enemy surface ships. Moderately high visibility to aerial observation at close ranges.\" This measure was used in the Atlantic and European coastal waters from the end of 1942 through the end of World War II, and was often referred to as \"Atlantic two-tone.\" It was worn by shore bombardment ships in the Pacific from late 1944 after the destruction of Japanese naval aviation capability at the Battle of the Philippine Sea.\nDue to the desire for a darker version for greater utility against air attack after the appearance of the kamikaze, Measure 12 was revived in 1945, but amended so as to be identical to Measure 22 save for the use of Ocean Gray rather than Haze Gray.\n| align=center |\nwearing Measure 22\nwearing Measure 22.\n|- id=\"Measure 23\" style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| Measure&nbsp;23 || Replacing all-over Haze Gray Measure 13, Light Gray Measure 23 was in effect a return to Measure 3 for use by anti-submarine vessels in the tropics or subtropics, and ships operating in northern latitudes.

In early 1943 BuShips began the development a green series parallel to the blue-gray series, but the process was slow and therefore the South Pacific Command as an expedient ordered its amphibious vessels to be repainted in Dark Tropic Green with \"tiger stripes\" in Light Tropic Green, both of which could be created by mixing standard 5-TMa blue tinting medium with yellow zinc chromate primer. According to a contemporary report, \"The color of the foliage [in the vicinity of Bougainville] was surprisingly high in key, a brilliance that would have been unbelievable except for the very same observations made on first arrival in the Solomons group.\"\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Initial Admiralty disruptive camouflage schemes employed polygons of multiple shades of gray, blue and green so at least two of the colors would blend with background sea or sky under different light conditions. Experience showed the polygons were too small to be differentiated at effective camouflage ranges. Simplified Admiralty light and dark disruptive schemes were promulgated in 1942 to use larger and simpler polygons with no more than four colors.\nArtist Everett Warner, who had headed the design section of Navy Camouflage during the First World War, returned to that post during the Second. On the basis of Warner's interpretations of recent Admiralty experience, BuShips issued a supplement to SHIPS-2 in March 1943 laying out multiple dazzle patterns under Measures 31 (dark), 32 (medium) and 33 (light) to conceal identity and confuse submarine torpedo fire control. Each measure included multiple pattern designs for ship classes so the pattern would not identify the class of ship. These measures represent the final evolution of dazzle camouflage.\nWarner's office issued over 300 pattern sheets for Measures 31-33. Specific patterns in the dazzle measures were designated as, e.g., MS-32/3D, meaning the 3rd Destroyer pattern under Measure 32; an A indicated an aircraft carrier pattern, B for battleships, C for cruisers and so on. Often a pattern designed for one ship type would be adapted to another, so that, for example, the battleship  wore an adaptation of Measure 32/18D, originally a destroyer pattern. Some patterns could be used as Measure 31, 32 or 33 depending on the paints chosen; these were listed as, e.g.,  MS-3_/6D.\nOn 15 September 1943 the South Pacific command adopted the dazzle measures for all ships; in October the Pacific Fleet officially adopted the dazzle measures for most of its remaining ships.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This measure emphasized mistaken identity and course deception to complicate submarine attack. Patterns were carried across the bow, and light gray was used aft to blend with the wake. Undersides of horizontal elements were countershaded in Pale Gray (5-P) or White (5-U) to reduce self-shadowing.

Measure 32 was applied to most surface ships in the Pacific during 1944, but in 1945 the Pacific Fleet reverted to Measure 12, 21 or 22 in the revised 1945 colors.\nAs with Measure 31, there were also amphibious-craft patterns under MS-32/L in Light Green, Ocean Green, Brown 4A and Black.\nMeasures 32/3SS and 32/9SS were submarine patterns that used a multiplicity of carefully shaded grays to counteract light and shadow and reduce the visibility of a submarine on the surface.\nwearing Measure 32, Design 11A.\n| image2 = USS Duluth (CL-87) underway in Hampton Roads on 10 October 1944 (NH 98363).jpg\n| width2 = 162\n| alt2 =\n| caption2 =  also wearing Measure 32, Design 11A, an adaptation of the same aircraft carrier pattern to a cruiser.\n| footer =\n}}\n| align=center |\nwearing Measure 32, Design 3D; compare to the Benson-class pattern sheet above.\nwearing Measure 32, Design 2C.\n|- id=\"Measure 33\" style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| Measure&nbsp;33(Disruptive system, light)|| Light pattern Measure 33 was a mixture of polygons in Ocean Gray and Light Gray or Pale Gray, or Navy Blue with Haze Gray and Pale Gray  similar to the Admiralty Western Approaches camouflage scheme.

Ocean Gray and Haze Gray retained their names but lost their bluish cast. However, the new paints (which were shipped pre-mixed, not as tinting paste) were generally only available in stateside yards, while ships repainted at forward bases continued to use the older bluish colors. Moreover, for Measure 22 (but not 12 or 21), Navy Blue was still prescribed until existing stocks were exhausted.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Navy Gray !! Ocean Gray (1945) !! Haze Gray (1945) !!

All auxiliaries and odd-numbered cruiser divisions, destroyer squadrons and destroyer-escort divisions were to be painted in Measure 21, and all even-numbered CA/CL divisions, DD squadrons and DE divisions in Measure 22.
