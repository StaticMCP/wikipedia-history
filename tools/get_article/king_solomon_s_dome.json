It is  southeast of Dawson City, Yukon, and is believed to be the source of the gold fields that sparked the Klondike Gold Rush at the turn of the 20th century. The mountain's name comes from King Solomon, an ancient king of Israel who was famed for his riches.\nDuring the gold rush, the mountain was the site of large-scale gold mining and excavation. After the largest sources of gold ore were exhausted, small family-owned operations moved into the area and continue mining gold on and near the mountain today. A communications tower is located atop the mountain, and in 2001, the tower was the site of a fatal accident. The trail for the Yukon Quest 1,000-mile sled dog race passes over the mountain every February.\nThe mountain is in a subarctic climate region, and is covered by an average snowpack of  during March and April.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSB5qckxtpw Two Yukon Quest mushers climbing King Solomon's Dome in 2007]"
