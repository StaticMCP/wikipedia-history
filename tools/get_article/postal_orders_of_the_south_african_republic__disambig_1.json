Any postal orders with counterfoils still attached are from books souvenired after the post office was captured during the Second Boer War.\nDenomination Chart\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

All denominations, except the 1/6, were allowed to circulate. This was done to save on both paper and labour.\nReferences\n*"
