Ramos issued Executive Order (EO) No. 3 on July 7, 1992 creating the Presidential Anti-Crime Commission (PAAC). It was made when the proliferation of kidnapping-for-ransom crime is viewed as a national public concern. Ramos appointed Vice President Joseph Estrada as the inaugural head of the commission.\nEstrada, shortly after succeeding Ramos as President, issued EO No. 8 on July 22, 1998 which abolished the PAAC and created the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC) and the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force (PAOCTF). Panfilo Lacson was appointed to head both agencies.\nPresident Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on April 16, 2001, issued EO No. 10 abolishing PAOTCTF. The PAOCC was retained.\nThe PAOCC underwent another reorganization on June 13, 2011 when EO No. 46 was issued by President Benigno Aquino III.\nPAOCC tackled the proliferation of illegal operations by Philippine offshore gaming operators (POGOs) or offshore gambling hubs in the 2020s. This led to the full ban of POGOs and the arrest of Bamban mayor Alice Guo.\nExecutive directors\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Name\n! colspan=\"2\" |Term\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n!Start\n!End\n|-\n| Gilbert Cruz || January 2023 || October 2025 ||\n|-\n| Benjamin Acorda Jr. || October 15, 2025 || incumbent ||\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
