In accordance with the South African Constitution of 1961, the State President, a largely ceremonial post, was elected by a joint sitting of both houses of the South African Parliament. Both Bozzoli and Graaff had already been candidates for the presidential election of September 1978.\nThe election, following the resignation of State President and former Prime Minister John Vorster less than a year after his election, was won by Marais Viljoen, who had been Acting State President in his capacity as President of the Senate since June 4.  The National Party had nominated Viljoen, rather than Transport Minister Lourens Muller, as its candidate on June 14.  A joint session both houses of parliament voted along party lines on June 19, 1979, after which Viljoen was sworn in 90 minutes after his election.\nBibliography"
