Gold Lake is surrounded by prominent peaks and lakes at the heart of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, including Big Snow Mountain and Iron Cap Mountain.\nWaterfalls\nThe outflow of Gold Lake joins the creeks from Moira Lake, Fools Gold Lake and other snow melting creeks to empty as the inflow of Lake Dorothy, which is the origin of the East Fork of the Miller River. Shortly after the Gold Lake outflow, the creek plunges into an unrated waterfall, Gold Lake Falls. Approximately halfway downstream towards Lake Dorothy, where Moira Lake joins with a tributary, the creek produces an unnamed waterfall, and shortly before the inlet of Lake Dorothy, two additional consecutive waterfalls:  Twist Falls and  tall Lower Twist Falls.\nAccess\nAccess to Gold Lake is through Dutch Miller Gap trail 1030 starting at Dingford Creek gate. The trail leads to a ridge of Big Snow Mountain towards Wild Goat Peak. Gold Lake is on the west side of the ridge, and Chetwoot Lake on the opposite side. The trail passes alongside Hardscrabble Creek and through Hardscrabble Lakes on the south skirt of Hardscrabble Dome. It follows a ridge towards Wild Snow Peak with Gold Lake on the north side of this ridge.\nSee also\n* List of lakes of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness\nReferences"
