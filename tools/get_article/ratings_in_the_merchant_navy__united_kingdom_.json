They are listed in ascending order of seniority.\n\"Mixed\" crew refers to crews that consisted of both white and non-white (African or Asian) members, as was common on British-registered ships, which often had white officers and (sometimes) petty officers, and non-white crew. These tables would probably only have related to white ratings. However, for these purposes, non-white ratings of European, American, or West Indian origin would probably have been considered \"white\".\nThe Merchant Navy Ratings Pension Fund (MNRPF) defined benefits scheme was set up in 1978 to provide pensions for retired Merchant Navy ratings.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Deck Department\n!Engine Room Department\n!Catering Department\n|-----\n!
