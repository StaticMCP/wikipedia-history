The 1997 anthology includes works representing the centuries-long emergence of this distinctly Black literary and cultural aesthetic in fiction, poetry, drama, essays, sermons, speeches, criticism, journals, and song lyrics from spirituals to rap.  Writings ranging from Queen Latifah to Phyllis Wheatley and LeRoi Jones are included within this volume. This anthology asserts that these various artistic forms comprise a Black aesthetic.\nThe anthology, published by the Houghton Mifflin Company, organizes its selections around three themes: the pattern of call and response, the journey toward freedom, and major historical events in the African-American experience. The anthology editors have woven together selections, critical analysis of the texts, historical background, and biographies into a scholarly, unified, and chronological approach to African-American literature and culture. Patricia Liggins Hill of the University of San Francisco served as general editor of the anthology.\nReferences"
