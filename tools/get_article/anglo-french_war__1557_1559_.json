Following the French defeat at the Battle of St. Quentin in August 1557, England entered the war. The French laid Siege to Calais in response.  Following failure in mid-1557, a renewed attack captured the outlying forts of Nieullay and Rysbank and Calais was besieged.\nEvents\nOn 1 January 1558, the French vanguard invested Sangatte and Fréthun Nielles, and the Army Corps reduced Fort Risban the next day. On 3 January, the artillery moved into Fort Nieulay at Rysbank. Thomas, Lord Wentworth, completely overwhelmed by a lightning attack, handed the keys of the city to the French on 7 January. The booty taken by the French was more than they had hoped for: food for three months and nearly 300 guns.\nThe English defences of Guînes and Hames soon also fell. Henry II of France arrived at Calais on 23 January 1558. France had reconquered the last territory it had lost in the Hundred Years' War and put an end to two centuries of fighting between England and France. The new French administration made a particularly efficient demarcation of the border, created a new division of farmland, reorganized the 24 parishes, and reconstructed villages and churches. No harm came to the English residents: after  a rather uncomfortable night they were escorted to the waiting boats and given  safe passage across the English Channel.\nIn England there was shock and disbelief at the loss of this final Continental territory. The story goes that a few months later Queen Mary, on her death bed, told her ladies: \"When I am dead and cut open, they will find Philip and Calais inscribed on my heart.\"\nResult\nThe Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis (1559) confirmed that the French would retain their conquest of the Pale of Calais.\nReferences"
