      "text": "# Draft:Presidential Drawdown Authority\n\n() is a power exercisable by the President of the United States to order the transfer of military equipment and services from existing United States Department of Defense stocks (drawdown) to a foreign country or international organisation. This special authority was created by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 Section 506(a)(1). It is exercisable when an unforeseen emergency creates a need for the US to immediately provide foreign military aid, and this need cannot be met using powers provided by any other law, such as the Arms Export Control Act.\nReferences"
