It was created by Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss, and stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes and Martin Freeman as Doctor John Watson. Sherlock consists of thirteen episodes that were produced as four three-part series airing from 2010 to 2017 and a special episode, \"The Abominable Bride\", that aired on 1 January 2016.\nSet in modern-day London, Sherlock depicts Holmes assisting the Metropolitan Police Service in solving various mysteries. He is assisted by Watson, who has returned from military service in Afghanistan with the Royal Army Medical Corps. The series also features Holmes's archenemy, Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott), as well as his brother, Mycroft Holmes (Gatiss). Amanda Abbington appears as Watson's wife, Mary Morstan, while Una Stubbs plays Mrs Hudson, Holmes's landlady. The series also showcases Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade (Rupert Graves), a Scotland Yard detective and one of Holmes's best friends, and Irene Adler (Lara Pulver), a dominatrix who exchanges state secrets with Moriarty.\nSherlock was met with critical acclaim and received numerous accolades. It won the Peabody Award in 2011 for \"A Study in Pink\". The series garnered forty-seven nominations from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, including four BAFTA TV wins: Best Drama Series, Best Supporting Actor (Freeman and Scott), and the Audience Award. Sherlock received thirty-nine Primetime Emmy nominations (with nine wins), including a win for Outstanding Television Movie (for \"The Abominable Bride\"). Cumberbatch and Freeman both won Emmys for their performances, as did Moffat for his screenwriting. The series garnered several other nominations, including twelve Crime Thriller Awards (six wins), nine Critics' Choice Television Awards (two wins), and three Edgar Allan Poe Awards (one win). Cumberbatch also received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television.\nAwards and nominations\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+\n|-\n!
