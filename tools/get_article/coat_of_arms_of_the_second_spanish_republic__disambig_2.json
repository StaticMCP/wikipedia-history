There was no coat of arms in the Spanish Republican Civil Ensign.\nHistory\nOrigin\nFollowing the 1868 Revolution that put an end to the unpopular reign of Isabella II the Provisional Government that was subsequently established decided to modify the Spanish symbols, doing away with the monarchic elements of the Bourbon Dynasty that had been up till then part of them. After reviewing a few proposals, one of which included a green civic crown, the following coat of arms was adopted: quarterly of Castile, Leon, Aragon and Navarre enté en point of Granada. The crown was a mural crown instead of the royal crown.\nThe First Spanish Republic that was instituted in 1873 adopted the coat of arms of the 1868–1871 Provisional Government without changes.\nThe mural crown topped coat of arms was one of the main official symbols of Spain until the 1874 coup d'état by General Arsenio Martínez-Campos initiated the Bourbon Restoration, putting an end to the period known as Democratic Sexennium (Sexenio Democrático).\n1931\nThe Spanish Republic reestablished in 1931 revived the coat of arms of the short-lived First Spanish Republic (1873&ndash;1874) which had originated in turn in the revision of Spanish symbols that followed the Revolution of 1868. The only exception was that the lion of the second quarter was depicted uncrowned.\nThe coat of arms of the Second Spanish Republic was flanked by the two Pillars of Hercules bearing scrolls with the motto Plus Ultra (Latin for further beyond). The colour of the scrolls is usually white or pale golden, but there is a high proportion of official representations displaying the red colour.\nGallery\nFile:Coat of Arms of Spain-1868 Proposal with the Civic Crown.svg|Proposal of 1868 with a Civic Crown as crest, Provisional Government term, led by Francisco Serrano(1868–1870)\nFile:Coat of Arms of Spain (1868-1870 and 1873-1874).svg|Coat of arms displaying a crowned lion, used during the Provisional Government term and the First Republic(1873–1874)\nFile:1870 5 Pesetas.jpg|5 Peseta coin with the coat of arms first used by the Provisional Govt.\nFile:Coat of Arms of Spain (1931-1939)-Flag Variant.svg|Variant with white pillars\nFile:Escudo de la Segunda Republica en Santander.PNG|Republican Coat of arms carved in stone.
