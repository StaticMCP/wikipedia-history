He held the British super-featherweight title from 2016 to 2017, and the Commonwealth and European super-featherweight titles from 2017 to 2018.\nLife\nMartin Ward is the son of a builder, and one of five children. Some of his brothers were boxers, including John Ward, who in 2010 was the Junior European champion in his weight class. He attended Sawyers Hall College, but left school at age 14. He trains at the Repton Boxing Club in Bethnal Green. In August 2012, he and his brother John Ward were shot on farmland in Essex in what Essex police called a \"neighbour feud.\" Francis O'Donoghue was sentenced to sixteen and half years for the shooting.\nAmateur career\nMartin Ward won the title in 2007 at the Junior European Union Championships (Cadets) of the European Union in Porto Torres in the weight class under 46&nbsp;kg, just edging out Hamza Touba from Germany in points (23-22). At the Junior European Championship (Cadets) of the same year in Siofok, he earned the bronze medal. He also won a bronze at the Junior World Championship (Cadets) 2007 in Baku, where he lost in the semi-final against Elvin Isayev from Azerbaijan by points (5-18).\nIn 2008, he earned a silver in flyweight at the Brandenburg Cup in Frankfurt an der Oder, losing to Qualid Berlaoura from France to points (9-18). In 2009, he won another international title, the European Youth Championship (formerly Junior Championship) in Szczecin in featherweight, defeating in the final round Bunjamin Aydin from Turkey by points (4-0).\nIn 2010, Martin Ward became the first English featherweight champion with a points victory in the final over Ryan Farrag (18-4). Later that year he won the 1st Championship of Great Britain, where he defeated lightweight Josh Taylor from Scotland in the finals (10-9). He qualified in England for participation in the 2011 European Amateur Boxing Championships in Ankara in lightweight. He started there in lightweight, defeating Tomas Vano from Slovakia (20-6) and Ildar Vaganov from Russia (16-10) to points. His victory over Vaganov, in particular, caused a stir, but in the quarterfinals, he was defeated by Vladimir Saruhanyan from Armenia to points (15-22) and thus finished fifth.\nBased on these successes, he was hopeful of being able to participate in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. However, in the 2011 World Championships in Baku he was defeated in the second round by Robson Conceição of Brazil (20-21), after being docked two points by the referee. For this reason, he was not selected to participate in the Olympic Games in London.\nInternational championships\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| Year || Place || Competition || Weight class || Notes\n|-\n| 2007 || 1 || Junior European Union Championships (Cadets) in Porto Torres, Italy || under 46&nbsp;kg || Points win over Erdi Alfaslan, Turkey (19-12), referee stopped contest in the first round over Alessandro Cubedau, Italy and points win over Hamza Touba, Germany (23-22)\n|-\n| 2007 || 3 || Junior European Championships (Cadets) in Siofok || under 46&nbsp;kg || Points win over Catalin Gheorghe, Romania (21-20), referee stopped contest in the second round over Mikola Buzenko, Ukraine\n|-\n| 2007 || 3 || Junior World Championships (Cadets) in Baku || under 46&nbsp;kg || Points victory over Robert Kanalas, Hungary (21-13) and Luis Cortes, USA (21:10) and points defeat against Elvin Isajew, Azerbaijan (5-18)\n|-\n| 2008 || 2 || Brandenburg-Cup (Junioren) in Frankfurt an der Oder || Flyweight || Points win over Alkan Özdemir, Turkey (18-5) and Dieter Geier, Germany (15-8) and points defeat against Qualid Belaoura, France (9-18)\n|-\n| 2008 || 9 || European Union Championship in Cetniewo || Flyweight || Points defeat against Kerem Guren, Turkey (12-14)\n|-\n| 2009 || 1 || Youth European Championship in Stettin || Featherweight || Points win over David Kanalas, Hungary (9-2), Wassili Tocu, Moldova (7-2), Elvin Alijew, Azerbaijan (8-0) und Bunjamin Aydin, Turkey (4-0)\n|-\n| 2009 || 1 || Tammer-Turnier in Tampere || Featherweight || Points win over Mikka Lehtinen, Finland (11-3) and Joe Ham, Scotland (9-4)\n|-\n| 2010 || 1 || Nations Cup in Wiener Neustadt || Lightweight || Points win over Ciaran Bates, Ireland (9-6) and Janosz Török, Hungary (4-2)\n|-\n| 2010 || 1 || British Championships in Manchester || Lightweight || Points win over Josh Taylor, Scotland (10-9)\n|-\n| 2011 || 2 || 62nd Strandja-Memorial in Pazardzhik || Lightweight || Points win over Vage Saruhanjan, Armenia (3-2), Ildar Waganow, Russia (+1:1) and Elvin Isajew (5-3) and points defeat against Airin Ismetow, Bulgaria (2-2+)\n|-\n| 2011 || 5 || Gee-Bee-Tournament in Helsinki || Lightweight || Points defeat against David Oliver Joyce, Ireland (4-16)\n|-\n| 2011 || 5 || European Championship in Ankara || Lightweight || Points win over Tomas Vano, Slovakia (20-6) and Ildar Waganaow (16:10) and points defeat against Vladimir Saruhanyan, Armenia (15-22)\n|-\n| 2011 || 17 || World Championship in Baku || Lightweight || Points win over Dragos Marin, Romania (15-7) and points defeat against Robson Conceição of Brazil (20-21)\n|-\n| 2011 || 1 || London International Invitational || Lightweight || Points win over Eugen Burhard (10-5) in final\n|}\nEnglish championships\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| Year || Place || Weight class || Notes\n|-\n| 2009 || 3 || Bantamweight || disqualifying loss in the semi-final against James Allen\n|-\n| 2010 || 1 || Featherweight || points win in the final over Ryan Farrag (18-4)\n|}\nInternational matches\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| Year || Place || Weight class || Notes\n|-\n| 2007 || Dublin || Ireland vs. England (Junior) || bis 46&nbsp;kg || points win over Neil Walker (21-4)\n|-\n| 2008 || Westport || Ireland vs. England || Featherweight || Points defeat against Carl Frampton (14-14+)\n|-\n| 2008 || Sligo/Irland || Ireland vs. England || Featherweight || points defeat against Willie Carey (11-11+)\n|-\n| 2008 || Gyöngyös || Hungary vs. England || Featherweight || points win over Miklós Ráth\n|-\n| 2008 || Hajdúszoboszló || Hungary vs. England || Featherweight || referee stopped contest in the second rough against Róbert Könnyű\n|-\n| 2010 || Stockholm || Sweden vs. England || Featherweight || points win over Bashir Hassan (2-1)\n|}\nProfessional career\nHe began his professional career on 8 September 2012, where he has had considerable success.\nWard vs. Boschiero\nWard fought Devis Boschiero on 30 November 2018.
