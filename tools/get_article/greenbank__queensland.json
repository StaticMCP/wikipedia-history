In the , Greenbank had a population of 9,587 people.\nGeography\nIt is located  south of central Brisbane. It was once divided between the Shire of Beaudesert and Logan City, but the Queensland Government's amalgamation of local government areas resulted in Greenbank becoming entirely within Logan City, since 15 March 2008.\nThe suburb is surrounded by farmland and includes the forested Greenbank Military Range (), which is on the Commonwealth Heritage List. A strip of parkland and a watercourse originally named The Platypus Pools and Bracken Way is a natural habitat for a number of species of flora and fauna including platypus, the rare black cockatoo, kookaburra, the blue wren, kingfisher, honeyeaters, owls, kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, possums, bearded dragons, legless lizards and water monitors up to 2.5 metres in length. Many more species have been sighted living in this natural habitat. The watercourse and natural forest are fed by torrential rains and natural springs dotted throughout the Spring Mountain area, continuing through to Greenbank, Browns Plains and finishing at Karrawatha National Park. Snakes, mostly consisting of python, whip snakes and red-bellied black snakes, and to a much lesser degree brown snakes. Bird-eating spiders, huntsman spiders, redback spiders and the orb-weaver spider also share the watercourse and forest area.\nThe parkland stretches along on either side of the watercourse and a variety of walking tracks of different fitness levels are used by residents for casual strolls, nature lovers and athletic enthusiasts, horse and bike riding. The tracks extend out into estates of Greenbank; such as Blue Grass, New Beith, Lyons and Teviot Downs Estates which cover more forested areas, while Spring Mountain Estate contains the natural forest areas and watercourse.
