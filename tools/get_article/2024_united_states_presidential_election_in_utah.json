Utah voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote. The state of Utah has six electoral votes in the Electoral College, following reapportionment due to the 2020 United States census in which the state neither gained nor lost a seat.\nRepublican Donald Trump carried Utah by 21.6%, an improvement over his past two statewide victories. Trump's popular vote percentage increased by 1.26% compared to the previous presidential election. Prior to the election, all major news organizations once again considered Utah a state Trump would win, or a red state. Voter turnout was 85.26%.\nDespite Harris losing both the state and presidential election, her 37.81% vote share was the highest received by a Democratic presidential nominee in Utah since 1964. Utah was the only state where Harris received a higher percentage of the vote than Biden. A majority of counties shifted to Harris compared to 2020 (15 out of 29 counties). Despite Utah's rightward swing in the margin of victory compared to 2020, Utah had the second-smallest swing to the right after Washington State.\nPrimary elections\nDemocratic primary\nThe Utah Democratic primary was held on Super Tuesday, March 5, 2024. Incumbent president Joe Biden easily won the state, facing minor opposition from activist Marianne Williamson and Congressman Dean Phillips.\nRepublican primary\nThe Utah Republican caucuses were held on Super Tuesday, March 5, 2024. Former president Donald Trump defeated former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley in one of his weakest performances of the greater Republican primaries. The state GOP returned to organizing a caucus after its use of the primary system in 2020, which significantly lowered turnout.\nGeneral election\nPredictions\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Source\n!Ranking\n!As of\n|-\n| align=left | Cook Political Report\n|\n|December 19, 2023\n|-\n| align=left | Inside Elections\n|\n|April 26, 2023\n|-\n| align=left | Sabato's Crystal Ball\n|\n|June 29, 2023\n|-\n| align=left | Decision Desk HQ/The Hill\n|\n|December 14, 2023\n|-\n| align=left | CNalysis\n|\n|December 30, 2023\n|-\n| align=left | CNN\n|\n|January 14, 2024\n|-\n| align=left | The Economist\n|\n|June 12, 2024\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |538\n|\n| June 11, 2024\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |RCP\n|\n| June 26, 2024\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | NBC News\n|\n|October 6, 2024\n|}\nCandidate ballot access\nAs of August 2024, the following candidates have been designated as \"Election Candidates\":\n* Kamala Harris / Tim Walz, Democratic\n* Claudia De la Cruz / Karina Garcia, unaffiliated\n* Lucifer \"Justin Case\" Everylove, unaffiliated\n* Cornel West / Melina Abdullah, unaffiliated\n* Donald Trump / JD Vance, Republican\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. lawsuit\nOn December 5, 2023, independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. filed a lawsuit against lieutenant governor Deidre Henderson and state elections director Ryan Cowley, arguing that the state's requirement for unaffiliated candidates to attain 1,000 verified signatures before the January 8 deadline is unconstitutional and that it forces Kennedy's campaign to hire professional petition circulators. In the 2020 election, the filing deadline was August 17, and was moved up in a bill passed by the Utah State Legislature in February 2022. Campaign lawyer Paul Rossi argued that the deadline was made \"to block any third-party candidates from appearing on Utah's ballot,\" showing \"an absolute contempt for the Constitution.\" A court filing was made by state attorney general Sean Reyes on December 7, stating that Henderson and Cowley have agreed to not enforce the deadline until March 5, 2024, per request of senior judge David Nuffer. Kennedy later qualified to appear on the Utah ballot on December 28, 2023, marking the first state to award him official ballot access. Kennedy would later withdraw from the ballot in Utah after the suspension of his campaign and endorse Donald Trump for president.\nPolling\nDonald Trump vs. Kamala Harris\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-datatable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;line-height:17px\"\n|- valign=bottom\n!

Johnson did in his 1964 landslide and is a strongly red state, a trait vastly owed to the state's conservative Mormon base. While the state has voted considerably less Republican in more recent presidential elections than it did during the 1970s, 1980s, 2000s, and early 2010s, Utah remains a GOP stronghold at both the federal and state levels. Utah stayed strongly red in other races, with Republican John Curtis winning by 31% in the concurrent 2024 U.S. Senate election in Utah, greatly outperforming Trump.\nWhile Trump won the state handily, Utah had the second-smallest shift to the right in the nation in 2024 after Washington state. Trump improved his margin by just over 1%, compared to the national rightward swing of 6%. Despite Trump's improved margin from 2020, Utah was the only state where Harris won a higher percentage of the vote than Biden in 2020, and it was the highest percentage of the vote won by a Democrat in Utah since Johnson's 1964 victory.\nDemocrat Kamala Harris won the same three counties that Joe Biden did in 2020: Salt Lake, home to the state capital and largest city Salt Lake City; Summit, home to a handful of ski resorts and SLC suburbs; and Grand, home to Moab and nearby Arches National Park. Trump became the first Republican to win the White House without carrying Grand County since William McKinley in 1900.\nNationwide trends\nAccording to an analysis by The Economist, this may have been because of a realignment of college-educated and native-born voters to Democrats, while non-college and foreign-born voters shifted to Republicans. This played out nationally, with Harris gaining among White women with college degrees and Black women, while Trump gained among Whites without college degrees and Hispanic voters.\nUtah, one of the most highly-educated states with relatively few foreign-born residents, did not shift significantly rightward. For example, Harris won over 30% of the vote in Cache County, home to Utah State University, the highest since 1964.\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Utah\n* 2024 United States presidential election\n* 2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries\n* 2024 Republican Party presidential primaries\n* 2024 Utah elections\n* 2024 United States elections\nNotes\nPartisan clients\nReferences"
