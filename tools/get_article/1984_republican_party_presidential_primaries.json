Incumbent President Ronald Reagan was again selected as the nominee through a series of primary elections and caucuses culminating in the 1984 Republican National Convention held from August 20 to August 23, 1984, in Dallas, Texas.\nThe primaries were uneventful as Reagan was virtually assured of the nomination by virtue of his popularity within the party. Thus, he faced only token opposition in the primary race. Ronald Reagan won in a landslide, winning every contest and garnering more than 6.4 million votes. Harold Stassen earned less than 13,000 votes, merely 0.19% of the total votes cast. Ronald Reagan would go on to win the most Electoral votes achieved by any president in history in the general election of that year.\nCandidates\nNominee\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=\"3\" |Candidate\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Most recent office\n!Home state\n! data-sort-type=\"date\" |Campaign\nWithdrawal date\n!Popular vote\n!Contest won\n! colspan=\"2\" | Running mate\n|- style=\"background:linen;\"\n! style=\"background:linen;\" scope=\"row\" data-sort-=\"\" |Ronald Reagan\n| style=\"min-width:80px;\" |\n| style=\"background:#FF3333;\" |\n|President of the United States(1981–1989)\n|\nCalifornia\n| data-sort-value=\"0\" |(Campaign • Positions)Secured nomination: August 23, 1984\n| data-sort-value=\"14,015,993\" |6,484,987(98.8%)\n| data-sort-value=\"44\" |51\n|George Bush\n|\n|}\nWithdrew during primaries\nFile:Harold Stassen 1980.jpg|Former Governor Harold Stassen of Minnesota\nResults\nThe popular vote from the Republican primaries was as follows:\n* Ronald Reagan (inc.): 6,484,987 (98.78%)\n* Unpledged delegates: 55,458 (0.85%)\n* Harold Stassen: 12,749 (0.19%)\n* Ben Fernandez: 202 (0.00%)\nReagan was renominated by a vote of 2,233 (two delegates abstained).
