D. King and his wife, Naomi Barber King. She is a Fox News Channel contributor. She once served as a senior fellow at the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, a conservative Washington, D.C., think tank. She is a former member of the Georgia House of Representatives and the founder of Alveda King Ministries.\nChildhood and family\nAlveda King was born Alveda Celeste King on January 22, 1951, in Atlanta, Georgia. She was the first of five children of A. D. King, the younger brother of Martin Luther King Jr., and his wife Naomi (Barber) King. King says her mother wanted to abort her so she could continue college, but her grandfather was able to persuade her to keep her child. When she was 12, her father became a leader of the Birmingham campaign while serving as pastor at the First Baptist Church of Ensley in Ensley near Birmingham, Alabama. Later that same year, King's house was bombed by opponents to the civil rights movement.\nIn 1969, her father, A. D. King, was found dead in the pool at his home. The cause of death was listed as an accidental drowning.\nMartin Luther King Sr. wrote in his autobiography, \"Alveda had been up the night before, she said, talking with her father and watching a television movie with him. He'd seemed unusually quiet... and not very interested in the film. But he had wanted to stay up and Alveda left him sitting in an easy chair, staring at the TV, when she went off to bed.... I had questions about A. D.'s death, and I still have them now. He was a good swimmer. Why did he drown? I don't know—I don't know that we will ever know what happened.\"\nEducation\nKing studied journalism and sociology as an undergraduate and received a Master of Arts degree in business management from Central Michigan University. She received an honorary doctorate from Saint Anselm College.\nPublic office\nFrom 1979 to 1982, King represented the 28th District in the Georgia House of Representatives.

Hosea Williams was also a challenger in the primary.\nFowler defeated both King and Williams in the primary. It was the last time she ran for elected office. Since then, she has publicly stated \"I've been a Democrat, and I've been a Republican. I've even considered being an independent.

The document, signed on the 158th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation's signing, argued that the tactics and locations of abortion providers like Planned Parenthood were racially discriminatory. According to a document distributed by the group, King and the other signees believed that \"the targeted practices of Alabama abortion providers are both discriminatory and disproportionately harmful to black mothers and their babies\" and that a legal case could be made against abortion using the Tenth Amendment.\n2010 \"Restoring Honor\" rally\nKing spoke at Glenn Beck's Restoring Honor rally at the Lincoln Memorial in August 2010. ABC News reported that in King's speech, she hoped that \"white privilege will become human privilege and that America will soon repent of the sin of racism and return itself to honor.\"\nOpposition to same-sex marriage\nKing has spoken out against same-sex marriage. In 2010 she equated same-sex marriage to genocide at a rally in Atlanta, saying, \"We don't want genocide. We don't want to destroy the sacred institution of marriage.\" In a 2015 essay, she wrote that \"life is a human and civil right, so is procreative marriage.... We must now go back to the beginning, starting with Genesis, and teach about God's plan for marriage.\"\nPersonal life\nKing is African-American. She has been married and divorced three times.
