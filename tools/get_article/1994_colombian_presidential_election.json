The result was a victory for Ernesto Samper of the Colombian Liberal Party, who received 50.57% of the vote in the run-off.\nSamper's victory was tainted by the Proceso 8000 scandal, involving accusations that the Liberal Party had sought funding from the Cali Cartel during his campaign and afterward. This resulted in an investigation, which found several of Samper's close associates within the party guilty, although Samper himself was absolved of any wrongdoing. However, the scandal badly damaged his and his party's reputation during his presidency and resulted in a coalition of opposition politicians forming to oppose him. This resulted in the defeat of the Liberal Party in the following 1998 presidential election. As of the 2022 presidential election, Samper was Colombia's last Liberal Party president.\nResults\n}}\nProceso 8000\nReferences"
