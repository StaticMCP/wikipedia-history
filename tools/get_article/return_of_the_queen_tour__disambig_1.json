After last night’s performance it’s safe to say she’s on the right track.\"\nMTV also gave a good review about the show, saying \"Female MCs, take note: The Queen wants her throne back.\" The Source also wrote an article, saying \"Putting to rest the thought that women in Hip-Hop just can't get along, Kim confirmed that she's already got a record in the bag with Eve and Missy and is still working on her documentary and book.\" Bene Viera from VH1 praised Kim's performance, commenting \"The pint-sized beauty’s performance proved one thing–not that anything needed proving–a legend is a legend. The Queen Bee’s return has arrived, and the fans haven’t gone anywhere. Bow down to the throne.\" while Ernest Hardy of the Los Angeles Times added \"[...] the thing that really girds Kim’s voice and persona is a genuine sweetness that humanizes a steely persona.\"\nReferences"
