For instance, the Ptolemaic astrological tradition has already listed some of the planets in the Solar System and their movements.\nAstrology encompasses various approaches. Sidereal and tropical astrology represent different ways of mapping the zodiac against the backdrop of the stars from a geocentric perspective. Heliocentric astrology focuses on the Sun as the central point of reference, while psychological astrology delves into the intricate connections between celestial movements and the human psyche.\nAcross different cultures, astrology has taken on unique forms and interpretations. Chinese, Hindu, Islamic, Jewish, Tibetan, and Western astrology each offer distinct insights into the connection between the cosmos and human affairs.\nThe following is an incomplete list of the different traditions, types, systems, methods, applications, and branches of astrology.\nBy type\n*\n*\n*\nBy period and place\n*Babylonian astrology ()\n*Chinese astrology ( – present)\n*Hellenistic astrology (2nd century BCE – 7th century CE)\n*Hindu astrology (2nd century CE – present)\n*Western astrology (2nd century CE – present)\n*Jewish astrology (c. 350 CE – present)\n*Early Irish astrology (7th – 11th centuries CE)\n*Islamic astrology (7th century CE – ?)\n*Heliocentric astrology ( – present)\n*Christian Astrology — a book written in 1647 by the English astrologer William Lilly\n*Psychological astrology — rooted in the work of psychologist-astrologer Carl Jung, beginning\nBy function\n*\n**\n**\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nRecent Western developments\nTraditions which have arisen relatively recently in the West:\n*Astrocartography\n*Cosmobiology\n*Esoteric astrology\n*Evolutionary astrology (Steven Forrest)\n*Financial astrology\n*Hamburg School of Astrology\n*Human Design\n*Synoptical astrology\nRelationships with other disciplines and systems of belief\n*Archaeoastronomy\n*Alchemy and astrology\n*Astrology and astronomy\n*Astrology and the classical elements\n*Astrology and numerology\n*Astrology and science\n*Astrotheology\n*Christian views on astrology\n*History of astrology\n*Islam and astrology\n*Jewish views on astrology\nSee also\n*Burmese zodiac\n*Celtic calendar\n*Dreamspell\n*List of astrologers\n*Mesoamerican calendars\n*Qimen Dunjia\n*Tai Yi Shen Shu\n*Vietnamese zodiac\nNotes\nFurther reading\n*"
