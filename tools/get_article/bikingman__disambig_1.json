It was founded in 2016 by Axel Carion, who came back from cycling across South America in 2015 and wanted to share the experience of cycling unknown places in survival conditions for endurance athletes.\nSelf-supported ultra cycling\nThe self-supported nature of the BikingMan races makes it different from supported ultra-distance events like the Race Across America (RAAM), in which each racer has a large support crew with multiple vehicles and where pure performance cycling is needed to finish these races. The carbon footprint of the races are kept to a minimum, support cars outside BikingMan organizations media cars, are strictly forbidden.\nBeing self-supported means that drafting is not allowed, receiving any form of support from other racers, friends, or family is not allowed; all food, accommodation, repairs, etc., must be purchased from commercial sources if they can find any on the road. The organizer provides a mandatory route, a GPS tracker to monitor each participant's progress and prevent cheating, as well as a road book. Riders must strategically choose how much time to devote to riding, resting, and refueling each day.\nIt is not a stage race, the clock never stops from the moment the riders leave the start to the moment that they reach the finish. Orienteering plays a major role as most of the races' locations are unknown to most participants.\nRules of BikingMan races\nThe complete rule set is available in the race manual of every race.\n# Athletes are self-supported and need to handle their fueling, repairs and rest during the race\n# All athletes must ride from the start location to the finish location while crossing the mandatory checkpoints in the right order\n# Every athlete needs to stamp her/his progression at every staffed checkpoint in the opening time windows\n# Drafting and riding as a pack are forbidden\n# Every athlete needs to carry a GPS tracking system to trace her/his progression\n# External assistance of any kind is forbidden\n# No support cars are allowed\n# SOLO or pair riders can attempt the races\nHow to follow the race\nBikingMan events are all covered by a limited number of media cars from the organization. The events are therefore presented live on social networks, namely the Instagram and Facebook accounts of the organization.\nDuring races, and on a daily basis, a story-based article is published on the Exposure page of the organization, as well as an additional article for the leaderboard once the race is completed.\nAll participants are equipped with a GPS tracker, which allows to share their position on a live-tracking website.\nSeason 2017\nIn 2017 was held the first BikingMan event; the IncaDivide race, which took 17 athletes in the Andes mountains of Ecuador and Peru. A brutal race where the main challenge for every racer was to battled against high altitude cycling conditions of the Andes.\nCalendar of the races\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

Compulsory stops at staffed checkpoints ensure athletes timestamp their progression, validate their physical state and eventually scratch the athletes who don't respect the closing times of every checkpoint.\nCalendar of the races\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!
