The aircraft would use a jet engine for most flight, and a cluster of four small rocket engines for added thrust during climb and interception. The design was largely obsolete by the time it was completed due to the rapidly increasing performance of contemporary jet engines, and only two prototypes were built. One of these was the first American fighter to exceed Mach 1 in level flight.\nA unique feature of the Thunderceptor was its unusual inverse tapered wing, in which the chord length increased along the wing span from the root to the tip, the opposite of conventional swept wing designs. This was an attempt to address the problem of pitch-up, a potentially deadly phenomenon that plagued early high-speed models. The Thunderceptor's design meant the entire wing stalled smoothly, more like a straight-wing design.\nDesign and development\nDuring the development of the XP-84, Republic, under the guidance of Alexander Kartveli, looked at the installation of rockets to fighters. The company was inspired by German wartime aircraft: the rocket-powered Messerschmitt Me 163 and the experimental rocket-boosted turbojet Messerschmitt Me 262C Heimatschützer (home protector) series of interceptor prototypes.\nThe Thunderceptor design was one of two swept-wing modifications based on the original Republic F-84 Thunderjet, the other being the Republic F-84F Thunderstreak which was developed later. A serious problem with most swept wing designs of the era was dangerous performance at low speeds and high angle of attack. The stagnant airflow over the wing tended to \"slide\" towards the wingtips, which caused them to stall before the rest of the wing. In this situation the center of lift would rapidly shift forward relative to the center of mass, pitching the nose up and leading to an even greater angle of attack or, in extreme cases, end-over-end tumbling of the aircraft. Aircraft caught in this regime would often stall and crash, and a rash of such accidents with the North American F-100 Super Sabre led to the term \"Sabre dance\".\nThe Thunderceptor's most notable design feature was intended to address this problem. The wings were built to have considerably more chord (distance from the leading edge to the trailing edge) at the tip than root, allowing them to generate more lift. This neatly addressed the problem of Sabre dance by delaying the point of stall on the tip to that of the entire wing. A side-effect of this design was that the tips had more internal room, so the landing gear was mounted to retract outwards with the wheels lying in the wingtips, using two smaller wheels in a tandem arrangement for each main gear strut, instead of one larger one. Another design change was the ability to vary the angle of incidence of the wing as a whole, tilting it up for low speed operations during takeoff and landing, and then \"leveling it off\" for high-speed flight and cruise. This allowed the fuselage to remain closer to level while landing, greatly improving visibility.\nIn keeping with its intended role as an interceptor, the nose was redesigned to incorporate a radar antenna, forcing the air intake for the engine to be moved from its original nose-mounted position to a new intake below it. The fuselage was otherwise very similar to the F-84's. The first prototype did not include the radome, although this was fitted to the second prototype.\nTesting and evaluation\n46-680) after the nose radome installation and on the right is XF-91 (serial 46-681) after the V-tail modification.]]\nThe first prototype made its first flight on 9 May 1949, breaking the speed of sound in December 1951. It was later modified with a small radome for gunnery ranging (although not the \"full\" radome of the second prototype). The second prototype included a full radome and chin-mounted intake, but was otherwise similar. With both the jet and rockets running, the aircraft could reach Mach&nbsp;1.71. Both prototypes completed 192 test flights over the course of five years.\nThe second prototype, 46-681, had an engine failure during takeoff from Edwards AFB in the summer of 1951. Republic test pilot Carl Bellinger escaped from the aircraft just as the tail melted off only 90 seconds into the flight. By the time fire apparatus arrived, driving  across the dry lake bed, the tail section had been reduced to ashes. 46-681 was then fitted with a \"V\" (or \"butterfly\") tail, and was flight-tested with this configuration. It was later used at Edwards AFB as a crash-crew training simulator, then scrapped.\nAs an interceptor the Thunderceptor was soon eclipsed by designs from other companies, but like the Thunderceptor none of these would go into production. The United States Air Force decided to wait the short time needed to introduce newer and much more capable designs created as a part of the 1954 interceptor project. The Thunderceptor, like the other interceptor designs of the era, had extremely short flight times on the order of 25 minutes, making them almost useless for protecting an area as large as the United States. The 1954 designs outperformed the XF-91 in speed, range, and loiter time, as well as including the radar and fire-control systems needed for night and all-weather operation. The era of the dedicated day fighter-type interceptor was over.\nAircraft on display\nThe surviving prototype, 46–0680, is exhibited in the Research & Development Gallery at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio.\nSpecifications (XF-91 Thunderceptor)\nAir Force Legends #210 : Republic XF-91 Thunderceptor\n|prime units?=imp\n|crew=1\n|length ft=43\n|length in=3\n|length note=\n:::: with butterfly tail\n:::: with radome nose\n|span ft=31\n|span in=2.7\n|span note=\n|height ft=18\n|height in=1.1875\n|height note=\n:::: with butterfly tail\n|wing area sqft=320\n|wing area note=\n|aspect ratio=\n|airfoil=Republic R-4,40-1710-1.0\n|empty weight lb=15853\n|empty weight note=\n|gross weight lb=18600\n|gross weight note=\n|max takeoff weight lb=28516\n|max takeoff weight note=\n|fuel capacity=46-680  internals (JP)\n::::46-681  JP in fuselage tank\n::::: LOX in forward fuselage\n::::: LOX in rear fuselage\n::::: water-alcohol in forward fuselage\n:::::*2x drop tanks\n:::::: (JP),  LOX,  water-alcohol in each\n|more general=\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 name=General Electric J47-GE-7 (later GE-17)\n|eng1 type=turbojet engine\n|eng1 lbf=5200\n|eng1 note=dry\n:::: with water injection\n|eng1 lbf-ab=6900\n|eng2 number=1\n|eng2 name=Reaction Motors XLR11-RM-9\n|eng2 type=four-combustion chamber liquid-fuelled rocket engine\n|eng2 lbf=6000\n|eng2 note=with chambers individually switchable\n:*Fuel: Water-alcohol (25% H2O / 75% C2H6O)\n:*Oxidiser: Liquid Oxygen (LOX)\n|max speed mph=984\n|max speed note=at\n|max speed mach=1.49\n|cruise speed mph=\n|cruise speed note=\n|stall speed mph=\n|stall speed note=\n|never exceed speed mph=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|range miles=1171\n|range note=\n|combat range miles=\n|combat range note=\n|ferry range miles=\n|ferry range note=\n|endurance=\n|ceiling ft=50000-55000\n|ceiling note=\n|g limits=\n|roll rate=\n|climb rate ftmin=\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude= in 5 minutes 30 seconds\n|wing loading lb/sqft=58.12\n|wing loading note=\n|fuel consumption lb/mi=\n|thrust/weight=0.60\n|more performance=\n|guns= provision for:\n:*4 ×  M3 cannons with 200 rpg (F-91)\n::or\n:*4 × T-110 cannons with 15 T-131 rounds each (F-91-1)\n::or\n:*4 ×  M24 cannons with 200 rpg (F-91-3)\n|bombs=\n|rockets=\n:*up to 6 ×  HVAR (F-91B)\n::or\n:*24 ×  Mighty Mouse rockets in extendable launcher clusters\n|missiles=4 × Hughes AIM-4 Falcon air-air missiles (F-91-2)\n|hardpoints=\n|hardpoint capacity=\n|hardpoint rockets=\n|hardpoint missiles=\n|hardpoint bombs=\n|hardpoint other=\n|avionics=\n}}\nSee also\nReferences\nNotes\nBibliography\n* Jenkins, Dennis R. and Tony R.
