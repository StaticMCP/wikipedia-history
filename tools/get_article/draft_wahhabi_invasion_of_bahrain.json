From there, they had been running the affairs of the island since 1782.\nSheikh Salman bin Ahmed Al Khalifa and his family settled in the village of Jawa in 1797. In 1799, the ruler of Muscat would occupy Bahrain. This resulted in tensions in the region.\nOccupation of Bahrain (1803–1810)\nThe Al Khalifa asked Abdulaziz bin Muhammad Al Saud to help them regain Bahrain from the ruler of Muscat. He quickly sent an army to capture Bahrain and expel the Omani forces.\nThe Saudi's would than place Bahrain under their protection between 1803 to 1809, and direct control in 1810. The rulers of Bahrain, Abdullah and Salman, along with their families, were sent to Diriyah where they were all detained.\nSecond invasion of Bahrain (1810–1811)\nThe Saudi's installed Abdullah bin Ufaysan as governor of Bahrain. The Bahraini's did not surrender, but rather asked for help from Said bin Sultan, the ruler of Muscat.\nThey attacked the Saudi garrison in Bahrain, and expelled its emir. They arrested sixteen men and took them hostage until they were released. The Saudi's later tried to reclaim Bahrain with the help of the infamous Kuwaiti pirate, Rahmah ibn Jabir al-Jalhami. However, the Saudi forces were defeated by a coalition of Kuwaiti and Bahraini forces in the Battle of Khakeekera.\nAftermath\nThe Saudis did not resume their attempts to invade Bahrain mainly due to the war in Hejaz. Saudi rule in Bahrain was also not stable due to difficulty of sea transportation.\nAlthough the Saudi's were not able to have a direct control over the region, they still had a major influence in Bahrain as well as the entire Persian Gulf.\nSee also\n* First Saudi state\n* Wahhabism\n* Emirate of Kuwait\n* Bahrain\nReferences"
