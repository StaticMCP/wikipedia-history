The project was both a community of popular open hardware websites and a company, founded by Steve Mosher, Jon Phillips, Wolfgang Spraul and Yi Zhang, that made hardware products. Formed from the now defunct Openmoko project, key members went on to form Qi Hardware Inc. and Sharism At Work Ltd. Thus far, the project has released the Ben Nanonote, the Milkymist One, and the Ben WPAN wireless project to create a copyleft wireless platform. The examples of Qi hardware projects are the Ben NanoNote pocket computer, Elphel 353 video camera and Milkymist One video synthesizer.\nQi Hardware was primarily active between 2009 and 2011 before going dormant. It was revived in 2019 and later renamed Qiware. In 2024, its assets were acquired by Phi, a similar organization.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
