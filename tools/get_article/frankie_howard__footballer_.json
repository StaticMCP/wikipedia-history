A pacy left winger who had been a sprinter in his youth, Howard joined Brighton & Hove Albion from Guildford City in 1950. By the mid-1950s, he had established himself in the team, partnering Denis Foreman on the left of the attack, and in the 1957–58 season, he missed only five matches as Albion were promoted to the Second Division. Knee ligaments torn nine months later forced his retirement. He remained on the club staff as groundsman for nearly 30 years. Howard died in Brighton in 2007 at the age of 76.\nReferences"
