Satyan.\nBackground\nThe Ichogil Canal was constructed by the Pakistani government in the 1950's partly as a defensive obstacle to prevent an hypothetical invasion of Lahore. At  wide and  deep, it presents a serious obstacle for any invading military force. Much of the battle was fought from across the canal, with tanks providing fire support to a ground team which had crossed the canal.\nThe battle\nThe battle was notable for being fought after the cease-fire had been signed on 22 September. The Pakistani defences of the Ichogil Bund were built around the village of Burki, which was penetrated by the advancing Indian armour around 10 September 1965. Confronted with this Indian offensive, the Pakistanis withdrew in disarray from Burki to mount a defence at the bund. They had blown off the bridge in the process, only to reoccupy a part of it in large numbers, before the Indians could consolidate their gains. Fighting began around midnight and lasted for about two and a half hours. At the end of the fighting, described as  by the Indians, Indian soldiers had crossed the canal and were just six miles from the city of Lahore.\nCasualties and losses\nIndian casualties in the battle included  49 killed and 65 wounded. Pakistani casualties included 48 dead and an estimated 80 jumped into the canal and were washed away, presumably dead, and 11 captured, including one officer. The Indians captured considerable amount of Pakistani arms and ammunition, including 2 RCL guns.\nSee also\n* Indo-Pakistan Wars\n* Operation Grand Slam\nReferences"
