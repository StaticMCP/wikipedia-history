It has linear, serrated leaves with sharply pointed teeth, head of up to sixty lemon-yellow flowers and oblong follicles.\nDescription\nBanksia hewardiana is an openly branched shrub that typically grows to a height of  but does not form a lignotuber. The leaves are serrated, linear in outline,  long and  wide on a petiole up to  long. There are between five and fifteen sharply pointed teeth on each side of the leaves. Groups of between thirty-five and sixty sweetly-scented flowers are borne in a head on a side branch about  long. There are hairy, lance-shaped involucral bracts up to  long at the base of the head. The flowers have a lemon-yellow perianth  long and a cream-coloured pistil  long and glabrous. Flowering occurs from July to November and the follicles are oblong to egg-shaped,  long and sparsely hairy.\nTaxonomy and naming\nThis species was first formally described in 1856 by Carl Meissner who gave it the name Dryandra hewardiana and published the description in de Candolle's Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis from specimens collected by James Drummond. The specific epithet (hewardiana) honours the English botanist Robert Heward (1791–1877). In 2007 Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele transferred all dryandras to the genus Banksia and renamed this species Banksia hewardiana.\nDistribution and habitat\nBanksia hewardiana grows in woodland and heath between Cataby, New Norcia and Moora.\nConservation status\nThis banksia is classified as \"not threatened\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife.\nReferences\n*"
