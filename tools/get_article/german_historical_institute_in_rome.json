Its purpose is to conduct research of the Italian history and music history, as well as the history of German-Italian relations from the early Middle Ages to the present day. Central is an interdisciplinary and transepochal perspective and a particular focus on transregional and transnational contexts in southern Europe and the Mediterranean area.\nInstitute\nThe \"Deutsche Historische Institut in Rom\", short DHI Rome, was founded as \"Prussian Historical Station\" in 1888 after the opening of the Vatican Secret Archives. It conducts historical basic research, promotes young academics and is a services facility. As such, the DHI Rome supports German scientists and institutions in their relevant research and promotes the cooperation of German, Italian and international historians.\nIn 1960 a Department of Music History was created at the institute, working on the musical cultures of Germany and Italy as well as their relationships in the music history of Europe.\nTraditionally, guests, scholarship recipients and research fellows of the German Historical Institute in Rome work in the Vatican Secret Archives and the Vatican Library. Since the 1960s, they focus increasingly on further church and state archives and libraries situated in Rome. The director sides with an Academic Advisory Board.\nThe DHI Rome was included in the Max Weber Stiftung – Deutsche Geisteswissenschaftliche Institute im Ausland (Max Weber Foundation – German Humanities Institutes Abroad) (founded in 2002 in Bonn), together with further humanities institutes of the Federal Republic of Germany.\nProjects\nThe Institute frequently organizes scientific conferences, colloquials and presentations on topics of Italian history and music history as well as the German-Italian relations from the early Middle Ages to the present day. It issues several scholarships annually for young Ph.D. and post-doc scholars in the fields of history and music history. The Ludwig and Margarethe Quidde Fellowship supports young postdoc researchers who are distinguished by outstanding academic achievements in the field of history or musicology. Several internships of six weeks each are directed at students of history or music history, who focus on German-Italian relations or Italian (music) history. A course of Roman studies in autumn grants students insights in local history and monuments.\nPublications\nThe DHI Rome issues several editions since 1892, reflecting the institute's spectrum of research. They include:\nEditions und regesta\n; Repertorium Germanicum\nThe Repertorium Germanicum is a collection of regesta, gathering all \"German\" topics in the Vatican registers and cameral stock from the Great Schism to the reformation  (1378–1517) since 1897.\n; Repertorium Poenitentiariae Germanicum\nIn addition to the Repertorium Germanicum, the RPG (issued since 1998) offers a fundamental source edition for German history of the late Middle Ages.\n; Nuntiaturberichte aus Deutschland\nSince 1892, a collection of historical sources concerning the Papal diplomacy of the 16th and 17th centuries.\n; Instructiones Pontificum Romanorum\nThis is a source collection of the instructions for the papal nuncios and delegates at European courts, issued since 1984.\n; Concentus musicus\nA gathering of musical monuments selected and edited by the Department of Music History since 1973.
