Expedition 48 began upon the departure of Soyuz TMA-19M in 18 June 2016 and concluded upon the departure of Soyuz TMA-20M on September 6, 2016. The crew of Soyuz MS-01 were transferred to Expedition 49.\nCrew\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Position\n!First Part(June 2016)\n!Second Part(July 2016 to September 2016)\n|-\n!Commander\n|colspan=2 align=center| Jeffrey Williams, NASAFourth and last spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight Engineer 1\n|colspan=2 align=center| Aleksey Ovchinin, RSAFirst spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight Engineer 2\n|colspan=2 align=center| Oleg Skripochka, RSASecond spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight Engineer 4\n|\n|align=center| Anatoli Ivanishin, RSASecond Spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight Engineer 5\n|\n|align=center| Takuya Onishi, JAXAFirst Spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight Engineer 6\n|\n| align=\"center\" | Kathleen Rubins, NASAFirst spaceflight\n|-\n|}\nEVA performed\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#cfccfc\"\n|\n| scope=\"col\" width=\"300\" align=\"center\"|Spacewalkers\n| scope=\"col\" width=\"300\" align=\"center\"|Start (UTC)\n| scope=\"col\" width=\"300\" align=\"center\"|End (UTC)\n| scope=\"col\" width=\"175\" align=\"center\"|Duration\n|-\n| colspan=7 bgcolor=#ccccff height=\"5px\" |\n|-\n| rowspan=2 |1.\n|  Jeff Williams Kate Rubins\n| August 19, 201613:04\n| August 19, 201619:02\n|5 hours 58 minutes\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |Installation of the International Docking Adapter (IDA) on Pressurized Mating Adapter-2 and installation of cables for the next IDA\n|-\n| rowspan=2 |2.\n|  Jeff Williams Kate Rubins\n| September 1, 201611:53\n| September 1, 201617:41\n|6 hours 48 minutes\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |The main objective of this EVA was to retract a thermal radiator on the Integrated Truss Structure segment P1. This radiator was supposed to be retracted during Expedition 45's EVA 2 (November 6, 2015) but was not completed. The radiator had been deployed on Expedition 33's EVA 1 (November 1, 2012) in an attempt to isolate a coolant leak. Additional completed tasks included installing HD video cameras on the port/outboard side of the station (one zenith, one nadir), applying additional torque to SARJ bolts, photographing the inside of the SARJ, tying back a protective blanket covering hardware which will be robotically manipulate later, and tying back Crew and Equipment Translation Aid (CETA) Cart brake handles to keep them out of the SARJ rotation envelope.\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/index.html NASA's Space Station Expeditions page]"
