For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\nAll modern acts have a short title, e.g. \"the Local Government Act 2003\".  Some earlier acts also have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n45 Geo. 3\nThe third session of the 2nd Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 15 January 1804 until 12 July 1805.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 45 G. 3.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  for continuing an act to empower the lord-lieutenant or other chief governor or governors of Ireland, to apprehend and detain such persons as he or they shall suspect for conspiring against his Majesty's person and government.|note4= }}\n|  for consolidating certain of the provisions contained in any act or acts relating to the duties under the management of the commissioners for the affairs of taxes, and for amending the same, so far as relates to the power of acting as commissioners in certain districts.|note4= }}\n|  and solicitors, to make and file the same on or before the first day of term, one thousand eight hundred and five.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  for granting additional annuities to the proprietors of stock created by two acts, passed in the thirty-seventh and forty-second years of his present Majesty.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n-\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n-\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  for discontinuing certain drawbacks and bounties on the exportation of sugar from Great Britain, and for allowing other drawbacks and bounties in lieu thereof.|note4= }}\n|  for suspending the operation of an act of the seventeenth year of his present Majesty, for restraining the  of promissory notes and bills of exchange under a limited sum in England, until six months after the ratification of a definitive treaty of peace.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n-\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  for carrying into execution the treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation between his Majesty and the United States of America.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  for better regulating the issuing and granting of permits and certificates for the conveyance and protection of certain exciseable goods therein mentioned;
