It is a member of the Independent Schools Association.

The second is the Faculty of Queen Ethelburga's and is purely Key Stage 4 (GCSE) and Sixth Form (A-Level and BTEC).\nHistory\n20th century\nThe school originally belonged to the Woodard Corporation, founded by Nathaniel Woodard. The sister senior school was Queen Margaret's School at Escrick and the Junior School was Queen Mary's at Baldersby Park near Thirsk.\nThe School foundation stone was laid on 21 October 1910 by Viscountess Mountgarret, its inscription was 'Pro deo et ecclesia' – For God and the Church. It was laid on the right-hand side of the school door facing the building.\nThe school was opened on 27 September 1912 by the Duchess of Albany, with Derwent and Lyminge opened by Lord Halifax on 18 June 1932. The chapel was given by Lord Mountgarret and dedicated to St Aiden.
