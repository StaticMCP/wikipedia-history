He served as President of the Provincial Assembly of Coquimbo, Proprietary Deputy for Vallenar, Deputy for Huasco, Deputy for Andacollo and Deputy for Freirina. He was the founder and patriarch of the Edwards family in Chile.\nInitially a sailor and surgeon from England, he deserted his own ship to live in Chile where he then worked as a surgeon and developed mines. A supporter of the patriot cause during the Chilean War of Independence, he served as chief physician-surgeon of the United Restoration Army, and was granted Chilean citizenship in 1818 for his services to the independence cause. He then went on to serve in several political posts.\nEarly life\nGeorge Edwards was born on 27 November 1779 in London to John Edwards and Elizabeth Brown. On 2 January  1780, Edwards was christened at St Luke's church in Islington.\nEdwards was educated at Eton College, and the Royal College of Physicians.\nIn Chile\nHaving sailed from a young age in British ships engaged in trade and privateering or looting, Edwards visited Chile for the first time in 1797. In 1803, he enlisted as a surgeon in the British raider “Blackhouse” or “Bacar” which was dedicated to looting and plundering ships and ports in the Spanish colonies in South America. In 1807, Edwards arrived in Chile aboard Bacar which anchored in the bay of Coquimbo and assaulted the unguarded city.\nDuring the sack of Coquimbo, Jorge Edwards entered the house of Diego de Ossandón to steal, but he found his daughter, Isabel de Ossandón, who he fell in love with immediately. He decided to desert the ship and asking for shelter in the house of Diego Ossandón. Family tradition says that when Edwards did not return to the British ship, they spent three days looking for him through all the houses in the city. Edwards hid for three days, hiding in a barrel of wine from his former shipmates. On the third day Spanish reinforcements arrived, forcing the British to retreat from the city, to continue their raids to the north. Once the Spanish authorities were aware of the presence of Edwards in La Serena, he was arrested and sent to Callao, where he was detained.\nOnce released he returned to La Serena in 1805 he was baptized into the Catholic faith. The baptism certificate recognizes that parents are Juan Eduardos (John Edwards) and Isabel Pardo (Elizabeth Brown), Spanish forms of their Welsh and English names respectively.\nJorge Edwards married his first wife Isabel Ossandón Iribarren in 1807, with whom he had eight children, including Agustín Edwards Ossandón.\nAfter that he worked as a doctor and surgeon for some years. He then became active in the mining business, and helped discover silver in Arqueros. He also developed mines in Copiapó and Huasco.\nHis distinctly anti-Spanish feelings made him a supporter of the patriot cause during the Chilean War of Independence, making donations to build the fleet for the liberation of Peru, commanded by a fellow Brit, Lord Thomas Cochrane. After the Battle of Chacabuco, he was appointed chief physician-surgeon of the United Restoration Army. The Supreme Director of Chile, Bernardo O'Higgins granted Edwards Chilean citizenship in 1818 as a reward for his services to the Independence cause.\nHe served as Deputy for Huasco between 1822 and 1823, Deputy for Andacollo between 1825 and 1826, Deputy for Freirina between 1826 and 1828, Deputy for Coquimbo in 1831, and Proprietary Deputy for Vallenar between 1834 and 1837.\nWidowed in 1834, he married his second wife Ventura Argandoña Subercaseaux, with whom he had children.\nEdwards died in La Serena, Chile on March 5, 1848, aged 68.\nReferences\nSee also\n*Edwards family"
