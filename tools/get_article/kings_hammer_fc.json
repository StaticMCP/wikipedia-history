They have won a US National Youth championship.\nIn 2020, they added a U23 team in the Ohio Valley Premier League, winning the league's inaugural season in the Fall of 2020. In 2021, they joined USL League Two, the top amateur division in the United States, while still planning to operate their OVPL team. The next step was to elevate the women's team, which they did in 2022, allowing them to compete in the USL W-League's inaugural season. With both men's and women's now a part of USL, Kings Hammer FC offers the highest level of soccer in Greater Cincinnati, apart from the MLS team FC Cincinnati.\nYear-by-year\nMen's team\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Division\n!League\n!Regular season (W–D-L)\n!Playoffs\n!Open Cup\n|-\n|2021\n|4\n|USL2\n|3rd, Great Lakes Division (8–2–4)\n|Conference Quarterfinals\n|Ineligible\n|-\n|2022\n|4\n|USL2\n|2nd, Valley Division (10–2–2)\n|Conference Semifinals\n|did not qualify\n|-\n|2023\n|4\n|USL2\n|4th, Valley Division (2–5–4)\n|did not qualify\n|did not qualify\n|}\nWomen's team\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Division\n!League\n!Regular season (W–L–T)\n!Playoffs\n|-\n|2022\n|4\n|USLW\n|7th, Great Lakes Division (2–3–7)\n|did not qualify\n|-\n|2023\n|4\n|USLW\n|4th, Valley Division (2–1–7)\n|did not qualify\n|-\n|2024\n|4\n|USLW\n|2nd, Valley Division (6–2–2)\n|did not qualify\n|-\n|2025\n|4\n|USLW\n|bgcolor=\"B3B7FF\"|1st, Valley Division (7–3–0)\n|Conference Finals\n|}\nNotable former players\n* Jacob Goodall, Kings Hammer SC – 2021, signed in 2021 by Greenville Triumph SC ()\n* Rizwaan Dharsey, Kings Hammer SC – 2021, signed in 2021 by Vitória Futebol Clube - Pico ()\n* Sam Robinson, Kings Hammer SC – 2023, international call-up to Puerto Rico ()\n* Maouloune Goumballe, Kings Hammer SC – 2023, signed in 2024 by Sporting Kansas City II\n* Anthony Samways, Kings Hammer SC – 2024, signed in 2025 by Sporting Kansas City\n* Travis Smith Jr., Kings Hammer SC – 2024, signed in 2025 by Chicago Fire FC\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
