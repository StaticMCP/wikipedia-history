Prior to the Crimean War there was no precedent of a mass exchange of awards between allied nations. However, in January 1856 Queen Victoria and the Emperor of France formally agreed to an interchange of decorations between their two Armies.  However, nominations for the French awards had already been gathered, with recommendations requested at the end of October 1855 and mid December 1855.  In exchange several awards of the Order of the Bath were made to French soldiers and sailors.\nAwards of the Légion d'Honneur to members of the British Armed Forces during the Crimean War were made in two lots, with awards first announced in the Le Moniteur of 16 and 19 July 1856 (with a consolidated list appearing in the London Gazette of 4 August 1856) and again on 22 April 1857 (which was republished in the London Gazette on 1 May 1857). The Légion d'Honneur decorations awarded to members of the British Armed Forces were those of Napoleon III's Second Empire with the Maltese Asterisk suspended from an Imperial Crown.\nBritish Armed Forces Recipients\nThe following alphabetical listing of recipients was drawn from the two London Gazette lists, with decorations awarded in the grade of Chevalier (5th class) unless otherwise stated.\n*Abbott, 1829 Private Timothy 95th Regiment\n*Adams, Brevet-Lieutenant-Colonel Cadwallader 49th Regiment\n*Adams, Colonel Frank C.B., 28th Regiment (4TH CLASS)\n*Adye, Lieutenant-Colonel John Miller C.B.

At his own request he was transferred to the Algerian Tirailleurs where he accompanied Colonel De Brancion during the assault on the Malakoff. When the Colonel was killed Thornton picked up a flag and led the attack until he was shot through the groin. In recognition of his conspicuous act of bravery Thornton received the Légion d'Honneur and was appointed a Lieutenant of Chasseurs by the Emperor.\nSee also\n* Crimean War\n* List of recipients of the Légion d'Honneur\n* List of Crimean War Victoria Cross recipients\n* Crimean War medals\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
