Warner graduated from Cornell University in 1903 and was a member of the Sphinx Head Society. He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1971.\nFollowing his playing career at Cornell University, Warner was the head football coach at Cornell University, the University of North Carolina, Colgate University, Saint Louis University, and the University of Oregon. He also coached football at Sherman Institute—now known as Sherman Indian High School—in Riverside, California.\nWarner was the brother of famed football coach Pop Warner. In 1902, Bill and Glenn both played pro football for the Syracuse Athletic Club during the first World Series of Football, held at Madison Square Garden. It was during this event, that Warner played in the first professional indoor football game as his Syracuse squad upset the heavily favored \"New York\" team. While Glenn was injured during the event with a head injury, Bill and the rest of the Syracuse team went on to win the event.\nHead coaching record\nCollege\nReferences\nAdditional sources\n*\n*\n* McCann, Michael C.
