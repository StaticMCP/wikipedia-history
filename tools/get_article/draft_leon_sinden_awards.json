Previous winners include Steven McNicoll and George Rae.\n| holder_label = Most recent winners\n| holder = David Rankine (Nan Shepherd: Naked and Unashamed) & Luke Thornton (Footloose)\n| website =\n}}\nBackground\nThey were founded by and named after the actor Leon Sinden, who spent eight seasons working at the theatre between 1965 and 1994, with the inaugural ceremony taking place in 1995. The award was specifically created to honour actors appearing in supporting roles. Those who have won twice previously are ineligible. Winners are selected by an audience vote, with the result announced at the end of the season on the main stage. There were no awards in 2020 and 2021, as the theatre did not present a full rep season those years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, nor were there awards in 2000, although it was still counted as the 6th award season. Traditionally, the two awards were given to the \"Best Supporting Actor\" and the \"Best Supporting Actress\", but since 2024 the awards have been presented as \"Best Supporting Performance\" with no distinction made between genders.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sticky-header\" style=\"font-size:1.00em; line-height:1.5em;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n! width=\"4%\"| Year\n! width=\"24%\"| Winner 1\n! width=\"24%\"| Notes\n! width=\"24%\"| Winner 2\n! width=\"24%\"| Notes\n|-\n! 1995(1st)\n| Martyn James\n|\n| Claire Richards\n|\n|-\n! 1996(2nd)\n| Martyn James\n|\n| Rona Anderson\n|\n|-\n! 1997(3rd)\n| Russell Hunter\n|\n| Una McLean\n|\n|-\n! 1998(4th)\n| Roy Boutcher\n|\n| Patricia England\n|\n|-\n! 1999(5th)\n| Martin Hodgson\n|\n| Deirdre Davis\n|\n|-\n! 2000(6th)\n| No award\n|\n| No award\n|\n|-\n! 2001(7th)\n| Jimmy Chisholm\n|\n| Janet Michael\n|\n|-\n! 2002(8th)\n| Michael McKenzie\n|\n| Helen Logan\n|\n|-\n!2003(9th)\n| Steven McNicoll\n|For his role as Andy in The Steamie\n| Janet Devigne\n|\n|-\n! 2004(10th)\n| Samuel James\n|\n| Janet Michael\n|\n|-\n!2005(11th)\n| Hywel Morgan\n|\n| Kezia Burrows\n|\n|-\n!2006(12th)\n| Robin Harvey Edwards\n|\n| Jacqueline Dutoit\n| Won for the role of  Lady Pontefract in A Woman of No Importance\n|-\n!2007(13th)\n| Rory Murray\n|\n| Joanne Cummins\n|\n|-\n!2008(14th)\n| Christian Edwards\n| Won for his role in She Stoops to Conquer\n| Luisa Prosser\n|\n|-\n!2009(15th)\n| Alan Steele\n| For the role of Frazer in Good Things\n| Isabelle Joss\n|For the role of Marjorie in Good Things\n|-\n!2010(16th)\n| George Rae\n|\n| Kate Quinnell\n|\n|-\n!2011(17th)\n| Fred Broom\n|\n| Kate Quinnell\n|\n|-\n!2012(18th)\n| Dougal Lee\n|\n| Emily Altneu\n|\n|-\n!2013(19th)\n| Joseph Mann\n|\n| Jacqueline Dutoit\n| Won for the role of Duchess of Berwick in Lady Windermere's Fan\n|-\n!2014(20th)\n| Scott Armstrong\n|\n| Romana Abercromby\n|\n|-\n!2015(21st)\n| Dougal Lee\n|\n| Helen Logan\n|\n|-\n!2016(22nd)\n| Greg Powrie\n|\n| Gemma McElhinney\n|\n|-\n!2017(23rd)\n| Mark Faith\n|\n| Rebecca Elise\n|\n|-\n!2018(24th)\n| Alan Mirren\n|\n| Fiona Wood\n|\n|-\n!2019(25th)\n| David Rankine\n|\n| Fiona Wood\n|\n|-\n!2020\n| No award\n|\n| No award\n|\n|-\n!2021\n| No Award\n|\n| No Award\n|\n|-\n!2022(26th)\n| Richard Colvin\n|\n| Nalan Burgess\n|\n|-\n!2023(27th)\n| Robbie Scott\n|\n| Rachael McAllister\n|\n|-\n!2024(28th)\n| David Rankine\n| Won for multi-rolling in Nan Sheperd: Naked and Unashamed\nFirst awards presented as \"Best Supporting Performance\"\n|Luke Thornton\n|Won for the role of Willard in Footlose\nFirst awards presented as \"Best Supporting Performance\"\n|}\nReferences"
