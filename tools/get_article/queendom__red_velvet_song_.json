Composed by minGtion, Anne Judith Stokke Wik, Moa \"Cazzi Opeia\" Carlebecker, and Ellen Berg with Korean lyrics adapted by Jo Yoon-kyung, the dance-pop song was released as the titular EP's lead single on August 16, 2021, by SM Entertainment, along with its accompanying music video.\nUpon its release, \"Queendom\" received mixed to positive receptions from critics, citing the song as an \"empowering\", \"perfect return\" of the group. It also attained commercial success, marking the group's thirteenth top-ten hit in their home country, their seventeenth top-ten entry on the Billboard World Digital Song Sales, and their first entry on the Billboard Global 200, landing at number ninety-six.\nBackground and release\nAfter a year and eight months, SM Entertainment confirmed through Newsen on June 9, 2021, that Red Velvet will be preparing a new album with the aim of making a comeback in August. Previously, the group released their repackaged album The ReVe Festival: Finale last December 2019 accompanied by the title track \"Psycho\", followed by the unit debut of Irene and Seulgi, with Wendy and Joy making their debut as solo singers. Moreover, Yeri had also built her acting career by appearing in tvN's Drama Stage 2021 - Mint Condition and the web drama, Blue Birthday. Prior to the official release of \"Queendom\", Red Velvet shared a snippet of their new song, alongside a preview of its choreography. The song had its official digital release on August 16, 2021, along with the extended play of the same name.\nComposition\n\"Queendom\" was composed by minGtion, Anne Judith Stokke Wik, Moa \"Cazzi Opeia\" Carlebecker, and Ellen Berg, while the Korean lyrics were written by Jo Yoon-kyung. In a newspaper interview with The Post, Wik revealed that the writer's table for the song was four women, and called it \"impressive\", reasoning that the music industry is male-dominated. She stated that it was written in a \"record time\" since the song had that \"once-in-a-lifetime flow to it\". The whole session of writing and recording the song was finished for four-and-a-half hours with some post-production, with Wik adding that writing and recording of the track \"happened really fast\" and came out \"so good\". In an interview made by Vogue with Red Velvet, Wendy revealed that the group had put a lot of thought towards \"expressing and showcasing\" differently their \"unique colors\". The group had come up with an idea of storytelling three different concepts which were, \"homecoming\", \"journey\", and \"carnival\", while stating that listening to their song would bring their feeling of \"bright and positive energy\".\nMusically, \"Queendom\" was characterized as a dance-pop song. JT Early of Beats Per Minute described the song as house-influenced, noting the \"bright piano\" and \"euphoric synthy\", bass-led chorus. Verónica Bastardo of The Quietus noted the dynamic piano synths chords, \"easy-to-remember\" hooks, electronic instrumentals, \"glimmering\" metals and airy synths. Additionally, Bastardo mentioned the big emphasis on rap sections and vocals that fall in between singing, speaking, and \"actually\" rapping. Kim Na-yeon of Single List acknowledged the rhythmical combination of flute and brass riffs on a \"colorful\" synth base, adding to the fun of listening to \"addictive hooks\", with \"bright and colorful\" vocals from Red Velvet. Tamar Herman of South China Morning Post recognized the \"lusher synth styling\" on which it balanced a \"catchy, magical spell-like\" chorus, \"That's our queendom yeah/Ladida-do Ba-badida). It is composed in the key of F major, with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Lyrically, the song conveys a message of positivity, highlighting that everyone's \"unique differences\" is what makes the world \"so beautiful\". It renders \"feminist-centric\" message, while also focusing on the co-existence of sisterhood and individuality. Kim Sung-yeop of IZM noted the song for thoroughly focusing on the message and sensibility, giving an example of the lyrics, \"Shall we start again\", as it contains an autobiographical story of moving towards a new beginning of Red Velvet. Moreover, Kim described the lyrics, \"Ladida-do Ba-badida\", as a track that does not \"create synergy with the ambiguous concept song\" and refuses to offset the plain impression of the overall melody.\nCritical reception\nFollowing its initial release, \"Queendom\" was met with mixed to positive reviews from music critics. JT Early of Beats Per Minute described the song as \"vivacious and uplifting\" with its \"more laid-back and magical vibe\", calling it as \"the perfect return track\". Anton Holmes of CNN Philippines labelled the track as a \"definitive Red song\", while calling it a \"contender\" as one of the songs of 2021. Tamar Herman of South China Morning Post described the track as \"bright, bubbly pop song of summer\", praising the group's \"empowering verses\" that bounce between the group's tonality, with a welcome return to Wendy's \"power vocals\". Lee Jin-joo of BNT News expressed that unlike the experimental concept that Red Velvet had shown for a while, the group have \"embodied their own colors\" with familiar and popular music. Verónica Bastardo of The Quietus called it a \"light and fun electronic club song\", further adding that it would be a great track for party vibes chants. Han Su-jin of IZE magazine commented on the track's promotion of \"freshness\", adding that the emotions in the melody are close to subtlety. Lee Deok-haeng of StarNews outlined the \"high expectations\" to the song as the group had previously released \"summer unbeaten hit streaks\" such as, \"Red Flavor\" (2017), \"Power Up\" (2018), and \"Umpah Umpah\" (2019). Ana Clara Ribeiro of PopMatters praised the song for being \"positive in sound and message\", stating: \"It doesn’t fail in its attempt to be empowering, but (thankfully) it doesn’t go out of its way to be, even if the lyrics sometimes verge on cliche\". Joshua Minsoo Kim of Pitchfork commented on how the track rarely offers the quintet the chance to flaunt their vocal prowess. Rhian Daly of NME called the song the \"weakest in Red Velvet's career so far\", further explaining that it is \"neither bad nor bold\" with mention of \"incredible awkward raps\" that each member delivers as the verses progresses, and concluded that there's something about the song that feels a \"little hollow\".\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Awards and nominations for \"Queendom\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Ceremony\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Asian Pop Music Awards}}\n| style=\"text-align:center\" | 2021\n| Best Dance Performance (Overseas)\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Gaon Chart Music Awards\n| style=\"text-align:center\" | 2022\n| Artist of the Year (Digital Music) – August\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Golden Disc Awards\n| style=\"text-align:center\" | 2022\n| Digital Song Bonsang\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" |Mnet Asian Music Awards\n| style=\"text-align:center\" rowspan=\"2\" |2021\n| Best Dance Performance – Female Group\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n| TikTok Song of the Year\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Music program awards for \"Queendom\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Program\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | M Countdown\n| August 26, 2021\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Music Bank\n| August 27, 2021\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" | Show!
