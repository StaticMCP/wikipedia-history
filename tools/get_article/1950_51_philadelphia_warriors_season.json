One lesser known aspect of this season involved the fact that the Warriors had been involved with two failed rigged NBA games orchestrated by NBA referee Sol Levy, with Levy failing to help the Warriors win over the Baltimore Bullets on November 15 and against the New York Knicks on November 18. His failures in those matches (with him successfully rigging three out of six total games planned) later led to Levy being arrested for his crime and later be tried as an accomplice for his role in the CCNY point-shaving scandal in 1951. Another lesser known fact about this season is that the Warriors were the very last opponent that the Washington Capitols would ever face off against before folding operations in the NBA on January 9, 1951; Philadelphia saw the end of the Washington Capitols franchise with the Warriors blowing out the Capitols in Philadelphia 102–74, with the Capitols deciding to fold operations later that day and the NBA holding a dispersal draft with the Capitols' players not long afterward. Weirdly enough, the Capitols would try to continue existing for the following season afterward in the original American Basketball League as a technically new franchise of sorts there, but they would fold operations as well by that upcoming January due to the NBA issuing legal threats against the ABL and the new Capitols if they tried to take the original franchise's history away from the NBA just like how they already took the original team's name from the NBA away into the ABL.\nNBA draft\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\"\n! style=\"background:#0000FF;color:#FFD700;\" width=\"7%\"| Round\n! style=\"background:#0000FF;color:#FFD700;\" width=\"7%\"| Pick\n! style=\"background:#0000FF;color:#FFD700;\" width=\"20%\"| Player\n! style=\"background:#0000FF;color:#FFD700;\" width=\"15%\"| Position\n! style=\"background:#0000FF;color:#FFD700;\" width=\"15%\"| Nationality\n! style=\"background:#0000FF;color:#FFD700;\" width=\"20%\"| School/Club team\n|-\n| T || – || Paul Arizin || G/F ||  || Villanova\n|-\n| 2 || 14 || Ed Dahler || F ||  || Duquesne\n|-\n| 5 || 50 || Ike Borsavage || F/C ||  || Temple\n|}\nRoster\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"font-size: 95%; width: 100%\"|}\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color: #0000FF;  color: #FFD700; text-align: center;\" | Philadelphia Warriors 1950–51 roster\n|- style=\"background-color: #FFD700; color: #FFFFFF; text-align: center\"\n!
