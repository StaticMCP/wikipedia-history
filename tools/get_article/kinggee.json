The name is said to have originated from the reigning monarch at the time, King George V, and was an expression that meant 'tops' or 'the best'. The company was established in Sydney in 1926 by Robert Adcock, and initially produced overalls, but has since grown its products to supply a large range of work wear (including under the \"Workcool\" and \"Tradies\" ranges), footwear and accessories.\nHistory\nIn March 1926, a trade mark application for King Gee was successfully made  by Robert Adcock of Concord in Sydney. The trademark was to cover \"articles of clothing, including overalls\". The original King Gee Overall quickly established a reputation for quality and durability, becoming a staple for workers across industries. During the 1930s, the brand gained recognition as part of Australia’s industrial fabric, embodying toughness and reliability in its products.\nWith the outbreak of the Second World War, King Gee expanded its operations by supplying uniforms and workwear to the Department of Supply in support of Australia’s defence forces. This period marked a turning point for the company, reinforcing its reputation as a trusted outfitter of durable clothing in times of national need.\nIn the post-war years, King Gee adapted to changing workplace demands by broadening its range. New slogans such as “Work With Ease in King Gee” emphasised comfort, while the memorable tagline “If They Were Any Tougher They’d Rust” highlighted resilience. The introduction of the “Permanent Press” line, later marketed as “Smart Casuals,” extended King Gee beyond traditional industrial settings into more general work and leisure wear. Campaigns like “For a Nation at Work” reinforced the brand’s strong cultural association with Australia’s working class.\nOver the following decades, King Gee continued to innovate with new lines and marketing strategies. The “Workwear You Can Trust” campaign underpinned ranges such as New G’s and Worn G’s, while later developments saw the launch of advanced apparel including Workcool2 and Tradies Work Denim. KingGee also diversified into footwear with the introduction of its XtremeGuard workboots, further strengthening its place as a comprehensive workwear brand.\nOwnership\nAfter Robert Adcock’s retirement, his son Warren David Adcock assumed leadership of the company and served on the board of Bradmill Textiles, another major Australian textile firm established in the 1920s. By the late twentieth century, King Gee had been acquired by Pacific Brands, having earlier passed through ownership under Sara Lee.\nIn the early 2000s, King Gee was fully integrated into Pacific Brands’ Workwear Group. However, the company faced significant challenges during the late 2000s. Following a net loss of AUD 150 million in 2008, Pacific Brands announced large-scale redundancies and closed its Bellambi factory in New South Wales, ending local manufacturing and moving production overseas in 2009.\nIn 2014, Wesfarmers acquired Pacific Brands’ Workwear Group, bringing King Gee under the same corporate umbrella as fellow Australian label Hard Yakka. Today, KingGee continues to operate as part of Wesfarmers’ Workwear Group, maintaining its position as one of Australia’s leading workwear brands.\nProducts\n*Workcool: Lightweight, breathable clothing for hot conditions.\n*XtremeGuard & Quantum Footwear: Durable work boots with protective features.\n*ShieldTec (Flame Resistant): Garments for hazardous environments.\n*Denim Collection: Classic denim workwear with functional performance.\n*Winter Collection: Insulated clothing for cold-weather work.\n*Fuze by KingGee: Modern workwear blending style and durability.
