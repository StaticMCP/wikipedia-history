The residing deity is known by the name Devi Kiriteshwari (also known as Maa Kiriteshwari or Maa Kiriteshwari Kali).The temple marks the spot where the crown (or “Kirit”) of Goddess Sati is believed to have fallen, following her tragic self-immolation and the subsequent journey of Lord Shiva carrying her body.The construction of the temple is more than 1000 years old and this place was considered to be the sleeping place of Mahamaya. Local people call this temple as Mahishamardini. Devi is also worshipped as Mukuteshwari (as her mukut or crown fell) the Holy Goddess. The original Temple was destroyed in 1405. The present temple was re-constructed by Darpanarayan, king of Lalgola in the 19th century and this is the oldest mark of architecture amongst 51 Peethas.

There is a legend that Nawab Mir Jafar in his death bed had requested for the holy Charanamrito (the holy water) of Maa Kiriteswari while suffering from leprosy.\nCulture\nAccording to David J.
