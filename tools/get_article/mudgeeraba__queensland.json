Mudgeeraba's essential character remains one of a nineteenth-century village.\nGeography\nMudgeeraba Creek is the major creek of a catchment area in the southern region of the Gold Coast. It is part of the larger catchment area of Nerang River. Bonogin and Wyangan Creeks are tributaries of Mudgeeraba Creek.\nMudgeeraba's essential character remains one of a nineteenth-century village, and contains important evidence of its earlier form and building. Most older houses are situated on large blocks of  to , alongside much larger farming properties situated in the area.\nHistory\nIt is thought that the name of the town was derived from an Indigenous Australian expression meaning, \"place of infant's excrement\", \"place where someone told lies\" or \"place of sticky soil\". Another theory is that the name means \"low-lying ground\".\nMudgeeraba is remnant of the type of township that characterises the rural hinterland of the Gold Coast. Subdivision of land was conventional and buildings were traditionally rural or rural commercial. The Schmidt Farmhouse is typical of farms of that period in the district (the farmhouse is now in the adjacent suburb of Worongary).\nMudgeeraba, like other areas in the region, was an early centre for farming, timber getting and cattle grazing by the mid-1870s.\nMudgeraba Provisional School opened on 24 October 1887. On 1 January 1909, it became Mudgeraba State School. In 1915 it was renamed Mudgeraba Upper State School. By 1925 the spelling had changed to Mudgeeraba Upper State School. It closed on 6 November 1955.\nMudgeraba Lower Provisional School  opened on 31 March 1892. In 1914, it became Mudgeraba Lower State School. In 1915 it was renamed Mudgeraba State School.

In 1981, the school relocated to its current site.\nMudgeeraba rose to some prominence with the coming of the railway from Brisbane to Tweed Heads in 1903. The station of the South Coast railway line was located near the present-day motorway entrance. In 1890, the Queensland State Government indicated that the railway station would be positioned as close to the township, located on Coach Road, as possible. Following the decision was made to position the railway station at some distance to the town, early residents acquired land nearby. Once the railway line was in operation the centre of the town was relocated to its present position. The railway was closed in 1961. The modern day Pacific Motorway largely follows the route of the former railway. The new Gold Coast railway opened on a different alignment from Brisbane to neighbouring Robina in 1998. Robina station is about  further than the old Mudgeeraba railway station.\nIn the early 1930s during the Great Depression, the Upper Mudgeeraba Creek banks were the location of unemployment relief camps set up under the Income (Unemployment Relief) Tax Acts, 1930. The creek water helped sustain vegetable gardens for the residents, housed in timber and corrugated iron huts. One aspect of the relief scheme put in place by the Queensland Government was to establish small banana plantations. In Upper Mudgeeraba,  divided into 50 blocks were made available to successful applicants to farm.\nMudgeeraba Opportunity School opened on 1 January 1981 on the former site of the Mudgeeraba State School.
