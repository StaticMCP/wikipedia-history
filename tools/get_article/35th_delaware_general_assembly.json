Elections were held the first Tuesday of October and terms began on the first Tuesday in January. It met in Dover, Delaware, convening January 1, 1811, two weeks before the beginning of the first year of the administration of Governor Joseph Haslet.\nThe apportionment of seats was permanently assigned to three senators and seven representatives for each of the three counties. Population of the county did not effect the number of delegates. Both chambers had a Federalist majority.\nLeadership\nSenate\n*James Sykes Jr., Kent County\nHouse of Representatives\n*Cornelius P.
