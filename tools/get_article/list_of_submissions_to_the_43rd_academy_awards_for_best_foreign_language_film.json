The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film was created in 1956 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to honour non-English-speaking films produced outside the United States. The award is handed out annually, and is accepted by the winning film's director, although it is considered an award for the submitting country as a whole. Countries are invited by the Academy to submit their best films for competition according to strict rules, with only one film being accepted from each country.\nFor the 43rd Academy Awards, thirteen films were submitted in the category Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The five nominated films came from Belgium, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland.\nItaly won for the eighth time with Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion by Elio Petri, which was also nominated for  Best Original Screenplay at the subsequent year (44th Academy Awards).\nSubmissions\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!
