Polish forces were led by Tadeusz Kościuszko, and the Russians and Prussians by Alexander Tormasov, future eminent general of the Napoleonic Wars. Tormasov was aided by Prussian General Francis Favrat, who emphasized the use of artillery, which put Russian-Prussian forces in the advantage.\nBackground\nFollowing the Russian defeat at the Battle of Raclawice, the Prussians entered Poland to help confront the Polish revolt.  Prussia and Russia were threatened by the sanctuary Poland offered serfs and Prussia was additionally threatened by their burghers lured to Poland's promise of democracy and free-market economy.\nOn the morning of the 6 June, General Wodzicki noted, \"It is impossible that Denisov could have amassed such an army.  My eyes must be wrong, but I can see Prussians.\"  Kosciuszko had received assurances the Prussians would remain neutral.\nRussian forces were placed on the left wing, while Prussian army was located on the right wing.\nBattle\nThe combined Russo-Prussian forces of 26,500 were victorious, defeating Kosciuszko's army of 15,000 with cannon fire.  Polish peasant hero, Wojciech Bartosz Głowacki, died of the wounds he sustained during this battle. Other Polish military commanders who took part in the battle were General Adam Poninski, General Antoni Madalinski, General Jan Grochowski and Duke Eustachy Sanguszko. Apart from Glowacki, two other Polish generals also died in the battle: Jozef Wodzicki and Jan Grochowski.\nFound on the battlefield by General Sanguszko, the wounded Kosciuszko stated, \"I want to die here\", as he was ridden to safety.\nAftermath\nKosciuszko's rebels retreated to Warsaw while the combined Russian and Prussian force captured Kraków on the 15 June.  Austria then invaded Poland from the south.  The Polish insurrectionists were reduced to defending Warsaw.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128213/szczekociny-1794 Board game]"
