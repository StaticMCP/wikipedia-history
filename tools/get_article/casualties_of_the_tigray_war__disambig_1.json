According to researchers at Ghent University in Belgium, the combined impact of wartime violence and famine and a lack of medical access had killed an estimated 162,000–378,000 people, with other reported estimates reaching numbers as high as 600,000 killed. The scale of the death and destruction led The New York Times to describe it in November 2022 as \"one of the world’s bloodiest contemporary conflicts.\"\nBreakdown\nTrue casualties statistics have been difficult to determine, largely due to deliberate information blackouts in the region. Journalists have noted the difficulty they face attempting to report on the war, as the Ethiopian government has taken steps to reduce press access to the Tigray Region, facing the risk of getting killed or imprisoned. It is also been reported that there is an unwillingness from either side to fully confirm precise numbers.\nWhile Prime Minister of Ethiopia Abiy Ahmed initially spoke of no civilian casualties in the early days of the war, by February 2021, he described the level of death in Tigray as \"hav[ing] caused much distress for me personally.”\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Breakdown\n! scope=\"col\" |Estimated & claimed casualties\n! scope=\"col\" |Time period\n! scope=\"col\" |Source\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Civilians\n|52,000+ killed\n|3 November 2020 – 2 February 2021\n|Tigrayan opposition parties\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Military\n(all sides)\n|100,000+ killed\n|3 November 2020 – 16 February 2021\n|TPLF\n|-\n|100,000 killed\n|September 2022 – October 2022\n|Kjetil Tronvoll\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |TPLF allied forces\n|3,400+ killed, 1,300 wounded\n|3 November 2020 –\n|ENDF\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Ethiopian and Eritreanallied forces\n|9,273 killed, 6,473 wounded\n|3 November 2020 –\n|TPLF\n|-\n|90,000+ Ethiopian casualties\n|September 2022\n|Alex de Waal\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Total deaths\n|162,000–378,000 killed\n|3 November 2020 – 4 November 2022\n|Ghent University\n|-\n|600,000 killed\n|3 November 2020 – 4 November 2022\n|Olusegun Obasanjo\n|}\nMassacres\nNumerous reports have been made of extrajudicial killings and summary executions (in many cases, targeting civilians) since the war began.\nTerminology:\n* ENDF - Ethiopian National Defense Forces\n* EDF - Eritrean Defense Forces\n* TDF - Tigrayan Defense Forces\n*Fano - Amhara militia\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The three parties' statement, published on 2 February 2021, estimated that at least 52,000 civilians had been killed by the ENDF, the Eritrean Defence Forces (EDF), Amhara militias, and other forces allied with the ENDF. Hailu Kebede, head of foreign affairs in Salsay Woyane Tigray, said that the three parties' collection method was to try to register data from witnesses in every administrative area of Tigray Region. He stated that \"thousands\" of names were already recorded. 2022 estimates from Belgium’s Ghent University put the number of war fatalities at 300,000 to 500,000, including 50,000 to 100,000 from fighting, 150,000 to 200,000 due to famine, and 100,000 from lack of medical attention.\nMilitary deaths\n2020\nAn ENDF soldier present at the attack on the Adigrat base of the ENDF Northern Command during the 4 November Northern Command attacks, Bulcha, stated to BBC News that there were 32 ENDF fatalities and 100 TPLF fatalities.\nBased on its 14–18 November 2020 visit and a visit starting 10 January 2021 to the Tigray Region, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) reported a Humera hospital employee's count of the war deaths as 92, including military (ENDF and TPLF) and civilian deaths.\nAn estimated 760 troops (ENDF and TPLF) were killed during fighting in the Raya region.\nThe TPLF claimed on 24 November to have killed thousands of ENDF and Eritrean in three fronts: Adwa, Idagahamus and Ray-Mokoni. They also claimed to have killed almost an entire Ethiopian division during fighting at Raya. This division is the 21st mechanised division.\nOn 7 December 2020 heavy fighting broke out between AMISOM troops and Ethiopian troops in Hiran region, Somalia, when Ethiopian troops tried to disarm Tigrayan troops. In total 21 Tigrayan soldiers and 20 Ethiopian soldiers were killed.\n2022\nIn September 2022, Ethiopian and Eritrean forces launched a massive \"joint\" offensive against rebels in Tigray. The Ethiopian army reportedly suffered 90,000 casualties in one month.\nNotes\n}}\nExternal links\n* [https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?layers=ac38556529f44b3ea52a6eb2118627c3 fully documented civilian casualties]\n* [https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?layers=edb293d653064f16bdfcc2863e7060db documented casualties]"
