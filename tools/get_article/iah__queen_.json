Daughter of a king, possibly Intef II, and mother of king Mentuhotep II, she was the queen consort of Intef III.\nBiography\nLittle is known for certain about the origin and life of Iah. She bore the title of ''king's daughter (Sȝt-nswt), which indicates that she was the daughter of a king, possibly Intef II, but this remains conjectural. Her name is a reference to Iah, an Egyptian Moon god.\nIah was married to king Intef III, although the important title king's wife is not attested for her. Their children were:\n*Mentuhotep II (died c. 2009 BC)\n*Neferu II\nAs the mother of Mentuhotep II and Neferu II, Iah was both the maternal and paternal grandmother of king Mentuhotep III.\nIah appears on a rock relief in the Shatt er-Rigal where she is shown standing behind Mentuhotep II. In front of both of them are depicted the beloved god's father, son of Ra, Intef and the royal sealer and treasurer Kheti. She also appears in the tomb TT319 of her daughter Neferu II. She is named on relief fragments of Neferu's tomb and on model coffins, where it is written: \"Neferu, born of Iah\".\nTitles\n*Beloved King's Mother (mwt-nswt mryt-f)\n*Priestess of Hathor (ḥmt-nṯr-ḥwt-ḥr)\n*King's daughter (sȝt-nswt)\nReferences"
