Voters chose eight representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nConnecticut was won by Vice President Al Gore by a 17.5% margin of victory. Gore's vice presidential running mate, Joe Lieberman, had been a U.S. senator from Connecticut since 1989. Connecticut is also birth state of Republican nominee George W. Bush; however, as a presidential candidate, Bush identified his home state as Texas, where he was governor, and he did not attempt to compete in Connecticut. Since the 1990s, Connecticut has remained a safe Democratic state, having not been won by a Republican presidential candidate since Bush's father in 1988. Connecticut is also the home state of major Green Party candidate Ralph Nader.\nBush became the first Republican to win the White House without Fairfield County since James A. Garfield in 1880, and the first since 1876 to win without Litchfield County. This was also the first election since 1976 when Connecticut failed to support the overall winner of the electoral college, and presidency. Bush became the first Republican to win without Connecticut since 1968.\nConnecticut was one of ten states that backed George H. W. Bush for president in 1988 but not George W. Bush in either 2000 or 2004.\nTo date, this is the last election which the towns of Sterling and Wolcott voted for the Democratic candidate, and the last time every municipality bordering Rhode Island voted for a Democrat.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 2000 United States presidential election in Connecticut\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic\n| Al Gore\n| align=\"right\" | 816,015\n| align=\"right\" | 55.91%\n| align=\"right\" | 8\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#FF3333; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Republican\n| George W.

Connecticut is allocated eight electors because it has six congressional districts and two senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of eight electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all eight electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector.\nThe electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 18, 2000 to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols.\nThe following were the members of the Electoral College from the state. All were pledged to and voted for Gore and Lieberman:\n#Nick Balletto\n#Frank Cirillo\n#Marilyn Cohen\n#Gloria Collins\n#Kimberly Ford\n#Thomas McDonough\n#Ken Slapin\n#Clorinda Soldevila\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Connecticut\n* Presidency of George W.
