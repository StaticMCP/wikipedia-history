He worked at Atari, Inc. in the early 1980s, where he designed and programmed the Atari 2600 games Yars' Revenge, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial''.\nWarshaw has written four books, and produced and directed three documentaries.\nEarly life\nWarshaw was \"Colorado-born, Jersey-raised, and New Orleans-schooled.\" He attended Tulane University, where he received a bachelor's degree with a double major in Math and Economics. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa and received a scholarship for his graduate work in Computer Science. One year later, he received his master's degree in Computer Engineering.\nCareer\nAfter graduation, he was hired at Hewlett-Packard as a multi-terminal systems engineer. Feeling unfulfilled, he began looking for another job. In 1981, he was hired at Atari, Inc.\nAtari\nWarshaw's first success, ''Yars' Revenge, had been conceived as an Atari 2600 adaptation of the arcade game Star Castle''. However, as limitations became clear, Warshaw re-adapted the concept into a new game involving mutated houseflies defending their world against an alien attacker. The game's working title was Time Freeze. Playtesting by Atari found that the game was popular with women. The game was a major success and is still regarded as one of the best games made for the Atari 2600. This led Warshaw to be chosen to design the game adaptation of the film Raiders of the Lost Ark, which was also a critically acclaimed commercial success.\nHis success on Raiders likewise made him designer and programmer of the ill-fated Atari 2600 adaptation of the film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Problems began early as he was only given five weeks to go from concept to finished product. Warshaw was assisted by Jerome Domurat, a graphics designer at Atari. Although the game was finished on time, it was poorly received and seen as confusing and frustrating. Atari took a major financial loss on the project which, combined with the company's other poor business decisions and the video game crash of 1983, led to the company being divided and sold within two years. During this time, Warshaw developed and almost finished another game called Saboteur. He left the company before it was completed. It was then re-adapted into a game based on the television series The A-Team but this also remained unfinished.\nLater work\nLater, he studied video production and released the documentary From There to Here: Scenes of Passage, a chronicle of the American immigration of two Russian women from the same family, one in 1920 and the other in 1980. Subsequently, he went on to produce the multi-part documentary Once Upon Atari, a collection of interviews and stories of employees and designers at Atari during the late 1970s and early 1980s.\nOn November 14, 2012, Warshaw became a licensed psychotherapist in California. He has a private practice in Los Altos as well as doing public speaking and training delivery in the  Silicon Valley area.\nIn June 2013, Warshaw became a contributing artist to the Museum of Modern Art in New York where ''Yars' Revenge'' was accepted as a part of the new video game collection. As of that time, this game became part of the museum's second round of additions, out of the first twenty-one total items, in their video game collection which had begun in late 2012.\nIn early 2020, Warshaw published Inspired Therapist: My Inner Journey from Wannabe to Healer, relating \"a series of reflections about therapy, what it means to be a therapist, and what it means to live an authentic life\" Also in 2020, Warshaw published a companion volume to his documentary Once Upon Atari, a book titled Once Upon Atari: How I made History by Killing an Industry.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*[http://www.onceuponatari.com/books/books.htm Warshaw's Conquering College Book]\n*[http://www.onceuponatari.com/books/books.htm Warshaw's PAN Book]\n*[http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,102316/ Howard Scott Warshaw] profile on MobyGames\n*[http://www.viceandconsent.com/ Vice & Consent]\n*\n*\n*\n*[http://hswarshaw.com/wordpress/the-inspired-intern/ Inspired Therapist: My inner journey from wannabe to healer]"
