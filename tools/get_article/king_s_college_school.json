The school was established in 1829 by King George IV, as the junior department of King's College London and had part of the school's premises in Strand, prior to relocating to Wimbledon in 1897.\nKCS is a member of the Eton Group of schools. It is predominantly a boys' school but accepts girls into the Sixth Form. In the Sixth Form, students can choose between the International Baccalaureate and A-Level qualifications.\nThe school is included in The Schools Index as one of the 150 best private schools in the world and among the top 30 senior schools in the UK.\nHistory\nA royal charter by King George IV founded the school in 1829 as the junior department of the newly established King's College, London. The school occupied the basement of the college in The Strand. Most of its original eighty-five pupils lived in the city within walking distance of the school. During the early Victorian Era, members of the teaching staff included Gabriele Rossetti, who taught Italian. His son, Dante Gabriel, joined the school in 1837. The best known of the early masters was the water-colourist, John Sell Cotman. Nine of his pupils became practising artists and ten architects. By 1843 there were five hundred pupils and the need for larger premises eventually led to the move to Wimbledon in 1897.\nThe school was progressive in its curriculum in many areas and appointed its first science master in 1855, at a time when very few schools taught science. The first head, John Richardson Major, served the school 1831–1866. 99 of the school's pupils from this period appear in the Dictionary of National Biography. In 1882, only Eton College surpassed the total of thirty Oxford and Cambridge Board examination certificates obtained by pupils at KCS. In 1897, falling numbers of pupils prompted the move to the school's present site in Wimbledon, a suburb served by the railway lines from Surrey and south London. A separate junior school was opened on the same campus in 1912.\nDuring World War I, many letters were written to the school, including some from the Battle of the Somme. During World War II, the school's Great Hall was damaged by bomb shrapnel, and some of the damage can still be seen on the outside of the hall.\nThe only remaining link between KCS and its former parent is that one of the KCS board of governors is nominated by King's College London.\nAcademics\nAll members of the Sixth Form currently study either the IB Diploma or the A-Level course, and all members of the Fifth Form take GCSE and iGCSE qualifications. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic results were not published during the 2019–2020 or 2020–2021 academic years.\nGCSE summary: 2018–2024\n{| style=\"WIDTH:50%; text-align:center\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! style=\"WIDTH: 20%\" | Year\n! style=\"WIDTH: 20%\" | %A*/98\n! style=\"WIDTH: 20%\" | %A*A/987\n! style=\"WIDTH: 20%\" | %A*AB/9876\n|-\n|2024\n|90.7\n|98.3\n|99.8\n|-\n|2023\n|89.8\n|98.1\n|99.9\n|-\n|2022\n|90.9\n|97.7\n|99.6\n|-\n| 2019\n| 82.8\n| 96.3\n| 99.5\n|-\n| 2018\n| 81.7\n| 96.4\n| 99.5\n|}\nA level summary: 2018–2024\n{| style=\"WIDTH:50%; text-align:center\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! style=\"WIDTH: 20%\" | Year\n! style=\"WIDTH: 20%\" | %A*\n! style=\"WIDTH: 20%\" | %A*A\n! style=\"WIDTH: 20%\" | %A*AB\n|-\n|2024\n|49.5\n|86.1\n|96.8\n|-\n|2023\n|50.09\n|82.78\n|93.57\n|-\n|2022\n|68.1\n|94.2\n|99.2\n|-\n| 2019\n| 46.5\n| 79.9\n| 94.9\n|-\n| 2018\n| 45.6\n| 78.6\n| 95.0\n|}\nInternational Baccalaureate Results: 2018–2024\n{| style=\"WIDTH:50%; text-align:center\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! style=\"WIDTH: 20%\" | Year\n! style=\"WIDTH: 20%\" | %7\n! style=\"WIDTH: 20%\" | %7/6\n! style=\"WIDTH: 20%\" | %7/6/5\n|-\n|2024\n|61.8\n|89.7\n|98.8\n|-\n|2023\n|63.8\n|90.6\n|99.4\n|-\n|2022\n|72.1\n|99.0\n|99.5\n|-\n| 2019\n| 56.0\n| 93.8\n| 98.7\n|-\n| 2018\n| 60.7\n| 94.1\n| 99.6\n|}\nFacilities\nKCS occupies a 20-acre site on the south side of Wimbledon Common and owns a boathouse on Putney Embankment and two additional playing-fields in Raynes Park and Motspur Park.\nIn 2010 the school began to renovate and expand its facilities, which was completed in 2019. This included a new sports pavilion (2011), quadrangle and netball court (2015), classroom block (2016), music school (2018), and sports centre (2019).\nKing's College Junior School\nKing's College Junior School (also known as KCJS), is the preparatory school for King's College School located in Wimbledon, London, it is on the same campus as King's College Senior school. It was established in its own right in 1912, and educates boys from ages 7–11.\nThe junior school admits about 85 boys each year in three groups:\n* At 7+ it takes about 54 boys.\n* At 8+ it takes about 14 boys.\n* At 9+ it takes about 12 boys.\nThe first two years (3–4) are collectively referred to as 'Rushmere' (as they are taught in Rushmere House), while the final two years (5-6), are called 'Priory'. 2021/2022 fees are £6,425 per term for years 3–4, and £6,930 per term for years 5–6.\nAs of September 2024 the headmaster is Ted Lougher.\nControversies\nIn 2021 a series of allegations were raised about a culture of misogyny and sexual harassment amongst King's male students. In an open letter to then headmaster Andrew Halls, Ava Vakil called out a 'a deep-rooted culture of misogyny' at the school, labelling King's as a \"hotbed of sexual violence,\" with instances of groping even occurring on school grounds. Further allegations in the letter include catcalling, circulating nude photos of teenage women without their consent, and threatening rape. These allegations were further supported in online, anonymous testimonies alleging even worse behaviour including, but not limited to, rape, on the website Everyone's Invited, where King's was mentioned at least seven times.\nIn response, the school established an independent panel of experts to review King's policies.\nOverseas expansion\nKing's has supported the Shanghai-based education provider Dipont in establishing schools in China. The first two schools, RDFZ King's College School Hangzhou and Nanwai King's College School Wuxi, opened in September 2018. Both schools cater for local Chinese and international students aged 3–18.\nKing's College International School Bangkok opened in September 2020 to over 300 boys and girls aged 2–10. In August 2023, the school opened for over 1,600 students, including its first Sixth Form pupils. In August 2024, its seventh opened. At capacity, the school will cater to roughly 2,400 students from preschool to Year 13. XET will operate the school and King's Wimbledon.\nFounded in 1994, the International School of Monaco (ISM) is a co-educational school with approximately 670 students aged 3–18. There is a bilingual programme for English and French in its early years and primary school. In the senior school the medium of instruction is English, offering IGCSEs in years 10 and 11 and the IB Diploma programme in the sixth form.\nHeads of King's College School\nDr. Anne Cotton, a former headmistress of Portsmouth Grammar School, has been the head of King's College School since September 2022.
