The described setting is Old Mynock Freeport, with four fully developed scenarios anchored there, built on familiar Star Wars tropes—apprentice force users, corrupted Jedi, and techno-mystical curiosities.\nReception\nAndrew Rilstone reviewed Star Wars Live-Action Adventures Gamemaster Toolkit for Arcane magazine, rating it an 8 out of 10 overall, and stated that \"What you need is clear, well described characters with solid, easily grasped goals, and that is what this book provides.\"\nReferences"
