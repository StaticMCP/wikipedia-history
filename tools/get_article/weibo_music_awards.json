It was originally named Freshasia Music Awards from 2016 to 2019 and was renamed Weibo Music Awards when it resumed in 2022 with new award format.\nFreshasia Music Awards used data from music streaming platforms plays, shares, and downloads as the standard for nominations and awards. Participating music platforms included Migu Music, Xiami Music, QQ Music, NetEase Cloud Music, and Baidu Music. In addition, social media engagement on Weibo also factored into the decision. Weibo Music Awards recognizes artists based on primarily engagement (votes and shares) on Weibo.\nWeibo Music Awards has received criticism for the large number of awards given out (e.g. 2019 Freshasia Music Awards had 30 awards while the 2023 Weibo Music Awards had 67) and the gradual shift toward becoming a marketing platform.\nWinners\nFreshasia Music Awards\nBelow is a list of the winners of major awards at the Freshasia Music Awards from 2016 to 2019.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Best Male Artist\n!Best Female Artist\n!Most Popular Artist\n!Best Group\n!Most Popular Group\n!Best Album\n!Most Popular Album\n!Ref\n|-\n|2016\n|Hua Chenyu\n|Li Yuchun\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |TFBOYS\n|\n|Li Yuchun Growing Wild\n|\n|\n|-\n|2017\n|Joker Xue\n|rowspan=\"2\" |Bibi Zhou\n|\n|\n|Joker Xue Beginner\n|\n|\n|-\n|2018\n|Jason Zhang\n|\n|SNH48\n|rowspan=\"2\" |Rocket Girls 101\n|\n|Bibi Zhou Renamed\n|\n|-\n|2019\n|\n|\n|G.E.M.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nWeibo Music Awards\nBelow is a list of the winners of major awards at the Weibo Music Awards from 2022 to 2024\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Best Male Artist\n!Best Female Artist\n!Best Group\n!Ref\n|-\n|2022\n|Hua Chenyu\n|rowspan=\"3\" |Huang Qishan\n|Teens In Times\n|\n|-\n|2023\n|rowspan=\"2\" |Zhou Shen\n|\n|\n|-\n|2024\n|\n|\n|}\nReferences"
