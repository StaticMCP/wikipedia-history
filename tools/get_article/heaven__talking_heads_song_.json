The song was performed live in their 1984 concert film Stop Making Sense, and a live recording from 1979 was included on the 2004 CD reissue of the band's 1982 live album The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads. The lyrics refer to heaven as \"a place where nothing ever happens\", where a party and a kiss repeat exactly the same way endlessly (though David Byrne has claimed the song was inspired by a UK bar of the same name). The song has been called \"the calm after [the band's] unusual ominous storm\" by Bill Janovitz of AllMusic and something \"psychologists would certainly have a field day with\" by author and The Guardian journalist Ian Gittins.\nDave Bell, writing for quarterly UK magazine Ceasefire, argued that the song \"epitomises pop as Samuel Beckett might write it: tedious, beautiful and desperate\".\nCover versions\nIn 1995 the song was covered by Iva Davies and Icehouse on The Berlin Tapes, the soundtrack album accompanying the ballet Berlin, for which Icehouse performed live on stage.\nIn 1996, the song was covered by Jimmy Scott on his album of the same name and the ''My Sister's Keeper Soundtrack.\nThe song was covered by Eric Burdon on his 2004 album My Secret Life and in 1985 by Simply Red for their album Picture Book.\nA German-language cover of the song, \"Der Weg in die Ferne\", was recorded by Joachim Witt for his 1980 album Silberblick.\nIn 1986, Thomas Di Leva made a Swedish-language adaptation of the song, named \"Himlen\". It was recorded for his album Pussel, and was also the B-Side of his single \"Snurra bakåt!\"\nSinger Q Lazzarus covered \"Heaven\" for the 1993 film Philadelphia (directed by Jonathan Demme, who had filmed Stop Making Sense). Her version was not available in its complete form until the release of the soundtrack from the documentary Goodbye Horses: The Many Lives of Q Lazzarus in 2025.\nk.d. lang covered \"Heaven\" for her 2011 album Sing It Loud.\nThe National contributed a cover of \"Heaven\" to the 2024 Talking Heads tribute album Everybody's Getting Involved: A Tribute to Talking Heads' Stop Making Sense.''\nReferences"
