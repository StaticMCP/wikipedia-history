This capability provides APHIS/PPQ better security, reporting functions, and monitoring capabilities for exported commodities.\nThe PCIT also provides a link to the PExD. PExD is a repository of phytosanitary import requirements of U.S. origin commodities to foreign countries. PExD enhances Plant Protection and Quarantine’s\n(PPQ’s) ability to maintain the export program for United States exporters. PExD will support PPQ’s Phytosanitary Issues Management (PIM) Export Services (ES) with the task of entering export summaries\nfor foreign countries. PExD provides reusable text to facilitate uniform entry of export summaries. PExD also provides PPQ staff, State and County cooperators, and exporters’ easy access to export summaries\nvia direct user queries. PExD interfaces with the Phytosanitary Certificate Issuance & Tracking System (PCIT) application processing.\nDuring application processing, users are provided with pertinent export summaries based on the consignee country, applicable commodities, and other data contained in an application.\nPhytosanitary Certificate - Certificate patterned after the model certificates of the IPPC [FAO, 1990]. In the U.S., this is an official document (PPQ Form 577) that attests to the phytosanitary condition\nof commodities and is issued by an Authorized Certification Official.\nSee also\n* Phytosanitary Certification\n* USDA\n* Plant Protection and Quarantine\nExternal links\n* [https://archive.today/20121214102510/http://www.aphis.usda.gov/import_export/plants/plant_exports/pcit.shtml usda.gov]\n* [https://archive.today/20121214115003/https://pcit.aphis.usda.gov/pcit/ usda.gov]"
