It was built from 1810. The property is owned by Transport for NSW. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 April 2000. The Steps are located on the eastern bank of Bennelong Point, adjacent to the Sydney Opera House and on the north-western boundary of the Royal Botanic Garden.\nHistory\n}}\nThis 'small landing place' appears to have been a wooden construction of approximately the same configuration as the existing jetty. It enclosed a small beach and protected boat harbour, which became known temporarily as \"Port Lachlan,\" after Macquarie's son Lachlan.\nGradually the jetty was repaired and improved, and ceased to be reserved for the exclusive use of the Governor. By 1850, it was referred to by the Admiralty as a \"stone pier,\" and stated to be in use for watering shipping anchored nearby. This shipping often and sometimes chiefly comprised warships, hence the name by which the jetty and steps are now known - although it has not been possible to ascertain when it started to be called thus. It was probably towards the end of the 1860s.\nA prolonged and confused disagreement between the NSW Colonial (and subsequently State) and Imperial Governments, the Royal Navy, Royal Australian Navy, Australian Government, Sydney Harbour Trust and Maritime Services Board (MSB), subsequently arose over responsibility for the Steps (as they became principally known), particularly over maintenance and policing. It continued for the best part of 120 years. The MSB file shows that a final resolution had not been determined as late as 1971, and the MSB's researches of that year refer to a government General Order of 1812 and to correspondence going back to 1850s. Whilst these various authorities were arguing, major construction and maintenance seems to have been undertaken by the NSW Public Works Department and its colonial predecessors; the cost often reimbursed but sometimes not by the naval authorities.\nFor many years, the principal usage of the Steps was for naval purposes: liberty boats, watering and stores handling, embarkation of crews, etc. However, merchant vessels appear also to have made much use of the jetty, and about the 1890s, Sydney Ferries Limited seem to have used it as an occasional city terminus. From an early date, the little harbour enclosed at the west of the jetty was used by watermen, and later by commercial launches. The jetty and adjoining foreshores were Domain and Gardens, and picnickers from the delightful park at the tip of Fort Macquarie.\n, watercolour, 13 August 1893]]\nThe entire precinct was destroyed in the course of the construction of the Sydney Opera House, but the jetty and steps survived. It was rebuilt in the early 1970s and reopened in 1973. Memorial plaques on the stone pillars on each side of the seawall entrance commemorate its history, particularly in the Naval context. At various times, wooden wharves and pontoons were added to the stone jetty, and a substantial wooden shed built at the shore end. The latter was intended chiefly for naval purposes, but was used also as a waiting shed for ferry passengers. In 1902, Rear Admiral Beaumont, RN, described the waiting room as \"the habitual resort of idlers.\" The following year, Capt. GH Field also complained of the \"idlers\" - \"especially those disreputable ones of the female sex who make it a most objectionable waiting place for the wives of Officers and Men.\"\nAfter the clean sweep of the Opera House construction, pontoons have reappeared as appendages to the old stone jetty. The complex is now a major embarkation point for harbour cruises, and may be expanded.\nNaval use has now ceased, with expansion of alongside facilities for major warships at Garden Island. It is however principally as a naval landing/embarkation place that Man O'War Steps has its place in history, and this is commemorated by the memorial plaques on the entrance pillars.\nDescription\nA masonry, bitumen topped pier projecting in a dog-leg to the north-west, enclosing a sheltered landing for small craft, with a flight of stone steps to water level at the inner extremity. Original construction dating from 1810–20 and improved/replaced over subsequent years. Majority of existing structure probably part of Farm Cove seawall work of 1860s.\nA plaque installed on the northern entrance to the pier pays tribute to the importance of the steps as the landing and embarkation point for men of the British and Australian fleets for 150 years. It also honours those from the Royal Australian Navy who served during World War I, World War II, Korea, Malaya and Vietnam and did not return. The plaque was rededicated on 13 April 2003. The plaque reads:\nA plaque was also installed on the southern entrance to the pier, dedicated on 20 October 1973, that detailed the history of the pier:\nW. H. Brotherson C.B.E.PresidentThe Maritime Services Board of N.S.W.\nThe Hon. L.A. Punch M.L.A.Minister for Public Works N.S.W.20th October 1973.\n|align=center}}\nCondition\nAs at 1 June 1998, the present condition is good.\nModifications and dates\nOriginal construction dating from 1810–20 and improved/replaced over subsequent years.

The Jetty was restored in 1973 by the Public Works Department and the Maritime Services Board when a ramp and berthing pontoon were added.\nHeritage listing\nAs at 8 December 1998, The only known remains of Macquarie-era harbour works still in existence in Sydney Harbour, in what appears to be its original configuration, and still in daily use. A valuable relic of the \"Old Navy\" days when men of war anchored in Farm Cove and when waterman plied on the harbour. Also the source of one of the longest-running bureaucratic correspondences in the history of NSW.\nThe Man O'War Steps was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 April 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.\nThe place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.\nOf historical significance for its association with activities of early and more recent naval usage of the jetty which has made an important contribution to the naval settlement and activities on Sydney Harbour.\nThe place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.\nOf environmental significance, the stone jetty forms an important part of the harbour in the vicinity of the Opera House and Botanic Gardens at Farm Cove.\nThe place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\nFurther assessment required.\nThe place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\nFurther assessment required.\nSee also\n*Bennelong Point\n*Sydney Opera House\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\nAttribution\nExternal links"
