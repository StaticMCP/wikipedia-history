The headstone was placed in 2002 by the Turkish government, in memory of 298 Turkish soldiers who fell in the Battle of Beersheba.\nA memorial plaque was placed at the base of the tombstone in memory of the Turkish soldiers who fell in the campaign. The plaque was originally placed by the British on the entrance wall of the British military cemetery, in recognition of the respect for the dead that Turks showed when they placed a tombstone for a British pilot who died in battle against them. Next to the tombstone stands a head statue of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.\nIn 2010, the tombstone was vandalized following the events of the flotilla to Gaza, when the inscription \"All honor to the IDF\" was sprayed on it, and an attempt was made to set fire to the Turkish flag next to it.\nSee also\n*Mustafa Kemal Atatürk Plaza\nReferences"
