Some also provide economic local transport. For rail museums, see List of British railway museums.\nMany of the standard-gauge railways listed, including former branch lines and ex-mainline routes, were closed by British Railways under the Beeching Axe of the 1960s. Most have been restored and operate as heritage lines. A smaller number of lines were formerly industrial or colliery railways.\nMany of these preserved railways are mentioned in national and international tour guides, and visits may form part of a school curriculum or feature in other studies, including civil engineering, mechanics, social, economic and political history, visual arts and drama.\nThis list also includes tramways. Nearly all tram services in Britain ended in the 1950s and early 1960s, leaving just Blackpool Corporation Tramways, although some big cities have since revived them in the late 20th century onwards.\nThis list includes those railways which has public open days and excludes those on private sites which are not advertised to the public.\nEngland\nNorthern England\n]]\nStandard gauge\n* Aln
