His father Hans David Ludwig (1805-1865) and his mother Bertha von Brause (1809-1845) were both related to Prussian military families. They lived in Klein Öls Castle, now part of the Oława district in Poland. His nephew was the jurist Peter Yorck von Wartenburg, who opposed Hitler.\nAfter graduating from high school in 1854 in Breslau, Yorck enrolled at the University of Bonn, where he studied law and philosophy. In 1855 he moved to Breslau to continue his studies. In 1857 he traveled with his father Louis to Italy, starting an Italian diary of his own, which he continued on subsequent trips.\nIn Berlin he married, on 3 October 1860, Luise von Wildenbruch (1838-1918), niece of Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia and the older sister of the writer Ernst von Wildenbruch (1845-1909).\nHe moved to Potsdam in 1861, where he took the exam to become an assessor. In 1865, after his father's death, he managed the family properties that included an olive grove and the family castle.\nIn the late 1870s, he met Wilhelm Dilthey, with whom he became friends and correspondent for over twenty years (1877-1897) on philosophical subjects.\nYorck developed a hermeneutical philosophy of history in exchange with his friend Dilthey that was significant for the hermeneutics of Martin Heidegger and Hans-Georg Gadamer. Their correspondence influenced the early Heidegger's philosophy of history, especially central concepts of his early thought and Being and Time such as historicity, generation, and the difference between history as lived (Geschichte) and as an object of inquiry (Historie).Farin, Ingo, \"Count Paul Yorck von Wartenburg\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2016 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = . Heidegger stated in Being and Time that he aimed to \"cultivate the spirit of Count Yorck in the service of Dilthey's work.”\nPublications\n* Die Katharsis des Aristoteles und der Oedipus Coloneus des Sophokles, Berlin 1866.\n* Briefwechsel zwischen Wilhelm Dilthey und dem Grafen Paul Yorck von Wartenburg 1877 - 1897, Halle 1923, Reprint Hildesheim 1995.\n* Italienisches Tagebuch, Darmstadt 1927, 2. edition Leipzig 1939.\n* Bewußtseinsstellung und Geschichte.
