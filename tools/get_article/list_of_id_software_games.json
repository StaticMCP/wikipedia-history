      "text": "# List of id Software games\n\nid Software is an American video game developer based in Richardson, Texas. It was founded in February 1991 by four members of the software company Softdisk: programmers John Carmack and John Romero, game designer Tom Hall, and artist Adrian Carmack. The founders, along with business manager Jay Wilbur, had previously developed the 1990 PC game Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons as \"Ideas from the Deep\" while still employees of Softdisk. After its founding, id developed further shareware computer games in the Commander Keen series for Apogee Software, as well as a series of small games for Softdisk, before releasing the \"grandfather of first-person shooters\", Wolfenstein 3D, in 1992 through both shareware and retail. It was followed by Doom (1993), considered one of the most significant and influential titles in video game history, which id self-published in shareware before releasing for retail through GT Interactive. GT Interactive published a sequel, Doom II (1994) and the two companies split publishing duties on id's final self-published or shareware game, Quake (1996).\nThe company has focused primarily on further computer and mobile games in the Doom and Quake series since 1993, with the addition of the Rage series: Rage: Mutant Bash TV (2010), Rage (2011), and Rage 2 (2019). Additionally, it co-developed a set of mobile phone games with Fountainhead Entertainment in 2005–2009, including Orcs & Elves (2006), Orcs & Elves II (2007), and Wolfenstein RPG (2008). It has released nine Doom games and five Quake titles in total. These games have been published through retail primarily by Activision, EA Mobile, and Bethesda Softworks. Additionally, id published three games in the Heretic series by Raven Software in 1994–1997, before ceasing its publishing operations. In 2009, id was purchased by ZeniMax Media, the parent company of Bethesda. The company's latest release is the first-person shooter Doom: The Dark Ages (2025).\nGames\n|\n* Development began while employees of Softdisk, and completed as id Software\n* Included in The Lost Game Collection of Id Software (1992) and id Anthology (1996) compilations\n}}\n* Included in The Lost Game Collection of Id Software (1992) and id Anthology (1996) compilations\n}}\n* Included in The Lost Game Collection of Id Software (1992) and id Anthology (1996) compilations\n}}\n* Included in The Lost Game Collection of Id Software (1992) and id Anthology (1996) compilations\n}}\n* Android port (2013) developed by Super Fighter Team; Windows, Linux, and MacOS ports (2015–16) developed by Hard Disk Publishing, Nintendo Switch port developed by Lone Wolf Technology\n* Included in The Lost Game Collection of Id Software (1992) and id Anthology (1996) compilations\n}}\n* Included in The Lost Game Collection of Id Software (1992) and id Anthology (1996) compilations\n}}\n* Included in The Lost Game Collection of Id Software (1992) and id Anthology (1996) compilations\n}}\n* Included in The Lost Game Collection of Id Software (1992) compilation\n}}1995&nbsp;– Super Nintendo Entertainment System, PlayStation, Windows1996&nbsp;– 3DO1997&nbsp;– Sega Saturn2001&nbsp;– Game Boy Advance2006&nbsp;– Xbox 3602009&nbsp;– iOS2012&nbsp;– PlayStation 32019&nbsp;– Nintendo Switch\n| notes=\n* First-person shooter\n* Divided into three episodes: \"Knee-Deep in the Dead\", \"The Shores of Hell\", and \"Inferno\"\n* Self-published as shareware by id Software; after release, also published as a retail title by GT Interactive\n* An upgraded version titled The Ultimate Doom (1995) includes a fourth episode, \"Thy Flesh Consumed\"\n* Ported to nearly every possible console and platform, both officially and unofficially, including esotera such as smart thermostats and oscilloscopes; variations on \"It runs Doom\" or \"Can it run Doom?\" are long-running phrases about the widespread porting of the game\n* Included in the id Anthology (1996) compilation\n}}1995&nbsp;– PlayStation2002&nbsp;– Game Boy Advance2003&nbsp;– Tapwave Zodiac2005&nbsp;– Xbox2010&nbsp;– Xbox 3602012&nbsp;– PlayStation 3\n| notes=\n* First-person shooter\n* Published as a retail title by GT Interactive\n* An expansion pack titled Master Levels for Doom II (1995), created by id, includes 21 commissioned levels and over 3000 user-created levels for Doom and Doom II\n* An expansion pack titled No Rest for the Living (2010), created by Nerve Software for the Xbox 360 version, includes nine additional levels; it was included in the PlayStation 3 version (2012)\n* Two sets of Doom II levels by different amateur map-making teams were released together by id as Final Doom (1996), a standalone title for DOS, PlayStation, and Mac OS\n* Included in the id Anthology (1996) compilation\n}}2005&nbsp;– Mobile phones\n| notes=\n* First-person shooter\n* Self-published as shareware by id Software; also published as a retail title by GT Interactive\n* Two official expansion packs were released in 1997: Quake Mission Pack No. 1: Scourge of Armagon, developed by Hipnotic Interactive, and Quake Mission Pack No. 2: Dissolution of Eternity, developed by Rogue Entertainment.
