The Bavarian Uhlan Brigade, consisting of the 1st Uhlan Regiment and the 2nd Uhlan Regiment, part of the Bavarian Cavalry Division, had to march back and forth across Lorraine between August 6 and 10 without finding a gap in the French lines. The hard roads took a severe toll on the horses.\nOn August 10, the French became active and managed to capture the village of Lagarde (known as Gerden from 1871 to 1918) near the border in the German part of Lorraine. To counter this, Lieutenant General Otto von Stetten, commander of the Bavarian Cavalry Division, and Lieutenant General Hasso von Bredow, leader of the 42nd Infantry Division, decided to conduct a forceful reconnaissance against Lagarde on August 11.\nResults\nThe Germans captured eleven guns, several machine guns, and 1,400 prisoners. A fallen French brigadier general was found with a two-day-old army order revealing the French battle plan in Lorraine. The Bavarian Uhlan Brigade lost 16 officers, 219 soldiers, and 304 horses.\nReferences"
