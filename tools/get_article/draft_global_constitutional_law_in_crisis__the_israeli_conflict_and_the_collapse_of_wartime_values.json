Two decades later, Israel⁴  launched a pre-emptive strike in the 1967 Six-Day War (June 5–10, 1967), shattering Arab armies and seizing the Sinai, Gaza, West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and Golan Heights.  In 1973 Egypt and⁵  Syria struck back on Yom Kippur, inflicting heavy Israeli losses before a ceasefire was negotiated.  The⁶  war ended with Israel withdrawing from most of Sinai in return for peace with Egypt.  (Israel has since⁷  fought multiple conflicts – 1956, 1982, 2006, and most recently 2023–present – each time redrawing the military and political map.)Israel’s trajectory – born into war and forged by war – epitomizes how power politics have long trumped international covenants. But even as Israel rebuilt and pressed for security (ultimately signing peace deals with Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994), the core values of the world order were supposed to bind all parties. Those values – sovereignty, self-determination, human rights, rule of law – are enshrined in the UN Charter and the Geneva Conventions. The Charter’s Preamble and Articles promise “faith in  fundamental human rights,” equality of nations, and the peaceful settlement of disputes. In practice, however, these  constitutional commitments  are too  often  treated  as  optional, especially  in  armed conflicts Enshrined Norms on Paper: The International Charter and Humanitarian LawThe UN Charter is essentially the world’s constitution.¹ It proclaims in Article 1 that the United Nations exists “to develop friendly relations among nations based on … equal rights and self-determination of peoples,”² and to promote “respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all.”³ Its principal  articles then bind states: “The Organization is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its members.”  Crucially, Article 2(4) expressly forbids “the threat or use of force against the territorial⁴  integrity or political independence of any state.”  In short, every country – large or small – is supposed to⁵  enjoy equal sovereignty, settle disputes by peaceful means, and never resort to war except in self-defense.⁶Similarly, post-war treaties codified rules of war. The Geneva Conventions (1949) and their Protocols enshrine   humanitarian   law:   armed   forces   must   distinguish   combatants   from   civilians,   protect   the wounded and prisoners, and outlaw indiscriminate attack.  In effect they set strict limits on wartime⁷  conduct. As a  US   Red   Cross   summary   explains,   the   four   Conventions   “provide   specific   rules   to safeguard combatants … who are wounded, sick or shipwrecked, prisoners of war, and civilians, as well as medical personnel.”  All 196 nations – including Israel and its neighbors – are party to these treaties.⁸ ⁹ By these lights, the thousands of civilian deaths and sieges in today’s conflict should raise immediate legal alarms.¹⁰Sovereignty & Peace: UN Charter Article 2(1)–(2) guarantees sovereign equality of nations and binds members to obey Charter obligations. Article 2(4) flatly prohibits force against any state. _______________________________________________________________________________1.

Mary Ellen O’Connell, The Power and Purpose of International Law• Self-Determination: Article 1(2) affirms “equal rights and self-determination of peoples”. (In theory, this is the basis for any viable Palestinian state.)  • Human Rights: Article 1(3) commits the UN to promote human rights and fundamental freedoms universally . All states ratified the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and related Covenants, which protect rights even in emergencies. • International Humanitarian Law: The 1949 Geneva Conventions and 1977 Protocols (Additional I & II) limit how war can be waged. They forbid targeting civilians or using starvation as a weapon, ensure humane treatment of prisoners, and require parties “in any and all circumstances” to avoid unnecessary suffering. These provisions form a global constitution of war – ideals meant to hold all governments accountable. They envision a world where law reigns, not raw muscle. Yet in practice these norms are invoked selectively, with enforcement hinging on which state pulls the strings. The 2023–25 Gaza War: Law Versus RealityIn October 2023, Hamas militants launched a massive assault on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and seizing over 240 hostages. Israel immediately declared a state of war (the first such declaration since  1973) and responded with massive air strikes and a ground invasion of Gaza. What followed has been catastrophic: by June 2025, over 54,000 Gazans – roughly 2% of Gaza’s population – had been killed according to official tallies. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled from one neighborhood to the next under relentless bombardment, and two-thirds of Gaza’s buildings were damaged or destroyed.In this war, fundamental legal principles have been blatantly tested or ignored. Israel’s air and ground campaign   in   densely   populated   Gaza   has   produced   extraordinary   civilian   casualties.¹   Under international humanitarian law, combatant states must distinguish civilians from fighters and avoid disproportionate harm.² Yet the scale of destruction has prompted stark warnings.³ As one leading international law scholar noted, “International humanitarian law … must apply regardless of who is right or wrong.” He emphasizes that both sides – Israel and Hamas – have violated IHL, but that does not  excuse either side. Hamas’s rocket barrages deliberately target Israeli towns (a war crime), and Israel’s bombardment has left tens of thousands of civilian dead and vast devastation, raising urgent questions about “excessive” harm relative to military gain\nOfficial bodies have cried foul. On 12 June 2025, the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted an emergency resolution demanding that Israel immediately end the blockade of Gaza, open all crossings, and allow aid. The resolution – passed after a US veto blocked Security Council action – condemned “any use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare” and the deliberate denial of humanitarian access. It demanded an “immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire” and compliance by all parties   with   international   law,   echoing   the   core   IHL   obligation   to   protect   civilians.¹   (Palestinian representatives reminded the Assembly that Israel “must abide by international law” and cannot remain “the exception to every rule”.)²Meanwhile, Israel’s leadership has framed its campaign as the ultimate self-defense – “dismantl[ing] Hamas” by “all the power” of the IDF (Israel’s army).³ Israel argues it has left “no place safe” for Hamas fighters, and warns that any criticism overlooks the brutality of the October 7 attacks.  ⁴ Indeed, Israel’s ambassador insisted in the UN that “genocidal jihadists” are to blame  and that any Gaza  civilian casualties are caused by civilians cooperating with militants. This tit-for-tat narrative showcases how one side’s law enforcement is another side’s war crime. The result is a humanitarian nightmare that shreds wartime values. Gazan civilians lack food, water, medicine, and shelter.  Hospitals are overwhelmed; children see their families killed. Israel’s stated policies – including destroying Gaza’s sewage and energy infrastructure – have been denounced as collective punishment. In September 2024, the UN’s human rights chief warned that basic IHL rules (treating civilians humanely, protecting relief supplies, etc.) were being violated with impunity. She reminded all parties that “international humanitarian law comprises a set of universal and binding rules to protect civilian objects” – rules repeatedly flouted in Gaza.Selective Enforcement and Double StandardsThe Gaza war has exposed glaring contradictions in how international norms are applied. Even as global law calls for impartiality, politics distort enforcement\nReferences"
