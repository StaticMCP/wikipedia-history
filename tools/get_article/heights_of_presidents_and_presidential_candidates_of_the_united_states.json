Some observers have noted that the taller of the two major-party candidates tends to prevail, and argue this is due to the public's preference for taller candidates.\nThe tallest U.S. president was Abraham Lincoln at , while the shortest was James Madison at .\nDonald Trump, the current president, is  tall, according to the White House physician (as of April 2025). JD Vance, the current vice president, is reportedly  tall. Trump's height is disputed and is generally considered shorter than official reports suggest.\nU.S. presidents by height order\nAbraham Lincoln, the tallest president, was .\nJames Madison, the shortest president, was .\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sort-under-center sticky-header\"\n|-\n!

The topic is also popular among essayists and popular science writers.\nA number of studies have been published, but many have methodological issues, including varied and unjustified date ranges from which elections are sampled in order to calculate percentages of elections in which taller candidates have won. One 2001 study approached the issue by measuring the support of candidates in terms of popular votes, giving evidence for an advantage for taller candidates. Other studies have also compared presidential height to the average height of the population.\nAccording to a 2013 study, significantly taller candidates were more likely to win the popular vote, while they were not more likely to win U.S. presidential elections: the number of taller candidates who won elections did not differ in a statistically significant manner from chance. It also found that the winning probability of the taller candidate increases to the present day, affecting studies which only analyze elections from the recent past.\nMentions in popular culture\n* In Ray Bradbury's 1953 dystopian novel Fahrenheit 451, when Mildred and her friends discuss the success of one presidential candidate over the other in a recent election, they talk only about the attractiveness of the winning candidate over the loser. One of their points is \"You just don't go running a little short man like that against a tall man.\"\n* A 1975 book called First Impressions: The Psychology of Encountering Others notes: \"Elevator Shoes, Anyone? One factor which has a far-reaching influence on how people are perceived, at least in American society, is height. From 1900 to 1968 the man elected U.S. president was always the taller of the two candidates. (Richard Nixon was slightly shorter than George McGovern.)\"\n* A 1978 book titled The Psychology of Person Identification states:  \"They also say that every President of the USA elected since the turn of the [20th] century has been the taller of the two candidates (Jimmy Carter being an exception).\"\n* A 1988 article in the Los Angeles Times fashion section about a haberdasher devoted to clothing shorter men included a variation of the tale: \"Stern says he just learned that Dukakis is 5 feet, 8 inches. 'Did you know,' he adds, noticeably disappointed, 'that since 1900 the taller of the two candidates always wins?'\"\n* A 1997 book called How to Make Anyone Fall in Love with You discusses the issue in a section about the importance of height: \"What about height? One assumes the taller the better, because our culture venerates height. In fact, practically every president elected in the United States since 1900 was the taller of the two candidates.\"\n* A 1999 book, Survival of the Prettiest by Nancy Etcoff, repeated a version of the legend in a section on the power of heights: \"... Since 1776 only [two Presidents,] James Madison and Benjamin Harrison[,] have been below-average height. The easiest way to predict the winner in a United States election is to bet on the taller man: in this century you would have had an unbroken string of hits until 1972 when Richard Nixon beat George McGovern.\"\n* A chapter titled \"Epistemology at the Core of Postmodernism\" in the 2002 book Telling the Truth:  Evangelizing Postmodernisms makes this observation:  \"I remember the subversive effect the observation had on me that in every U.S. presidential race, the taller of the two candidates had been elected. It opened up space for a counterdiscourse to the presumed rationality of the electoral process.\"\nComparative table of heights of United States presidential candidates\ncompares his height to that of a statue of George Washington while touring National Constitution Center in Philadelphia.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#beb;\"| &nbsp;Taller candidate was elected&nbsp;|| style=\"background:#ffd;\"| &nbsp;Shorter candidate was elected&nbsp;\n|-\n| style=\"background:#c8ccd1;\"| &nbsp;Winner and opponent were of the same height&nbsp; || style=\"background:#fff;\"| &nbsp;Comparison data unavailable&nbsp;\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sort-under-center sticky-header\"\n|- align=\"top\"\n!
