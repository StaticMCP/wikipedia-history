It is named after the site of Baia-Hamangia, discovered in 1952 along Golovița Lake.\nGenesis and successor\nThe Hamangia culture began around 5250/5200 BC and lasted until around 4550/4500 BC. It was absorbed by the expanding Boian culture in its transition towards the Gumelnița culture.\nIts cultural links with Anatolia suggest that it was the result of a recent settlement by people from Anatolia, unlike the neighbouring cultures, which appear descended from earlier Neolithic settlement.\nArt\nThe Hamangia culture attracted and attracts the attention of many art historians because of its exceptional clay figures.\nPottery\nPainted vessels with complex geometrical patterns based on spiral-motifs are typical. The shapes include: bowls and cylindric glasses (most of them with arched walls). They are decorated with dots, straight parallel lines and zig-zags, which make Hamangia pottery very original.\nFigurines\nPottery figurines are normally extremely stylized and show standing naked faceless women with emphasized breasts and buttocks. Two figurines known as \"The Thinker of Cernavodă\" and \"The Sitting woman\" are considered masterpieces of Neolithic art.\nGallery\nFile:Human-sized clay head found at Varna necropolis.png|Life-sized clay head,\nFile:The Thinker & The Sitting Woman of Cernavoda.png|The Thinker and Sitting Woman, c. 4900 BC\nFile:Female figurines, clay, ivory, bone, 4900-4600 BC, AM Varna, Varm51.jpg|Figurines\nFile:Durankulak-nekropola Hamangia.tif|Anthropomorphic pottery\nFile:2006 0814Hamangia Histria Museum20060298.jpg|Figurine\nFile:Ceramic bowl from the 5th millennium BC, Durankulak.jpg|Pottery\nFile:Sofia - Skeleton from the Durankulak Necropolis.jpg|Burial at the Durankulak necropolis\nSettlements\nsettlement]]\nSettlements consist of rectangular houses with one or two rooms, built of wattle and daub, sometimes with stone foundations (in Durankulak). They are normally arranged on a rectangular grid and may form small tells. Settlements are located  along the coast, on the coast of lakes, on lower or middle river terraces.\nImportant sites\n*The Durankulak lake settlement, now Archaeological Complex Durankulak, commenced on a small island, approximately 7000 BC and around 4700/4600 BC the stone architecture was already in general use and became a characteristic phenomenon that was unique in Europe.\n*Cernavodă, the necropolis where the famous statues \"The Thinker\" and \"The Sitting Woman\" were discovered\n*The eponymous site of Baia-Hamangia, discovered in 1953 along Lake Golovița, close to the Black Sea coast, in the Romanian province of Dobrogea.\nInhumation\nCrouched or extended inhumation in cemeteries. Grave-goods tend to be without pottery in Hamangia I. Grave-goods include flint, worked shells, bone tools and shell-ornaments.\nSee also\n*Cucuteni-Trypillia culture\n*Cycladic art\n*History of Bulgaria\n*Old Europe\n*Prehistoric art\n*Prehistory of Southeastern Europe\n*Prehistoric Romania\n*Varna culture\n*Vinča culture\n*List of Stone Age art\nReferences\nExternal links\n[https://hamangia.eu/en/hamangia-culture/ HAMANGIA CULTURE – DEVELOPMENT AND OVERVIEW]"
