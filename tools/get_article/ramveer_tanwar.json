He has contributed to cleaning and restoring approximately 80 ponds across states such as Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Gujarat, and Karnataka. He is often referred to as the 'Pond Man of India'.\nTanwar is the founder of the social organization, Say Earth and the 'Jal Chaupal' campaign, focused on the revival of water bodies and promoting environmental awareness. He serves as the brand ambassador for the Swachh Bharat Mission, appointed by Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation and holds the position of Ghaziabad district coordinator for the Ground Water Force under the Government of Uttar Pradesh.\nEarly life and education\nRamveer Tanwar was born in Dadha village in the Gautam Buddha Nagar district of Uttar Pradesh. He is the youngest of five siblings. He received his primary education in his village. In 2014, Tanwar graduated from KCC Institute of Technology and Management with a bachelor's degree in Mechanical engineering.\nAfter graduating, Tanwar worked as an engineer briefly before committing to full-time environmental and water conservation work. He received groundwater conservation training from the Central Pollution Control Board of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.\nWork\nIn 2015, Tanwar launched the 'Jal Chaupal' campaign to conserve water and revive water bodies, starting in Dadha village. He expanded the initiative to raise awareness on water conservation in rural areas of Uttar Pradesh, including Dabra, Kulipura, Chauganpur, Sirsa, Rampur, and Salempur.

Under this campaign, young individuals began capturing selfies with ponds and sharing them on social media. To specify the locations, participants were encouraged to include the pond's name. The initiative garnered widespread attention, as the images of cleaned water bodies served as inspiration, and motivated local officials to clean them. The campaign also received support from individuals of Indian origin residing abroad, as well as citizens from the United States, Canada, and Indonesia.\nIn 2020, Ramveer Tanwar founded the non-profit, Say Earth, which is engaged in its ongoing pond cleaning efforts.
