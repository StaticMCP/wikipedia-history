The sanctions on oil began in December 2022 and included an embargo of Russian oil, namely, the bringing of crude oil and refined oil products from Russia to the EU and other G7 nations by ship, with a few exceptions.\nSanctions apply to anyone facilitating the maritime transport of such oil in breach of the embargo, including trading and commodities brokering, financing, shipping, insurance, including reinsurance and protection and indemnity, and flagging and customs brokering.\nOn 23 June 2023 as part of the 11th sanctions package, the EU prohibited access to European ports of all vessels suspected “with reasonable cause”, of having been involved in transshipment of Russian oil at a price higher than the price cap, or having turned off their Automatic Identification System trackers.\nCertain ships carrying oil have been flagged as being probably in violation of the embargo and some have been specifically sanctioned, as have their owners/managers.\nThe number of ships considered in violation of the embargo can be significant. In October 2023, 2 carrying crude oil and 21 with oil products were identified, out of a total of 182 tankers carrying oil from Russian Black Sea ports that month.\nIn 2023, under 5% of Russian crude oil products went to Europe, a fall of 90% in the year.\nHistory\nDuring and after Russian intervention in the Syrian civil war in 2015, sanctions have been used against Russian tankers by the United States, including product tankers Sudak (IMO:8943155) and Sig (IMO: 9735335), chemical tanker Stalingrad (IMO: 9690212) and the combined chemical and oil tankers Marshal Zhukov (IMO: 9690224) and Yaz (IMO: 9735323). In 2022, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, 72 ships were directly sanctioned by the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Sanctions do not aim to stop these vessels from trading and they have been seen to berth in overseas ports, however they have been restricted by the sanctions, with most ports of call being in Turkey, India, Iran and Egypt.\nBreaches of sanctions\nWhilst the price of crude remained below the $60 level, breaches were generally limited to small quantities of oil imported into the EU from Russia and transshipment of oil at sea, however when the oil price rose in Summer 2023, the number of potential breaches increased with oil being purchased at a price over the oil cap price.\nShip-to-ship transshipments\nThe object of ship-to-ship transshipments is to mask the source of the oil, to hide from the buyer (or the authorities) that the oil is Russian and subject to sanctions.\nShips involved in transshipments have been known to change their names and their paint colours during voyages and to turn off their Automatic Identification System trackers.\nTransshipments have taken place off the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, in the Black Sea and in the Mediterranean Sea.\nThe majority of transshipments from ships leaving the Black Sea have taken place in the Gulf of Laconia, close to Greece, but outside of the 6-mile territorial limit, it is in international waters. The Jumbo is a crude oil tanker,  Gabon flagged, that was based in the gulf acting as a depot tanker, with some ships delivering oil to the depot and others collecting from it.\nShipping refined oil from Bulgaria\nBulgaria has the Lukoil Neftohim Burgas refinery where Russian crude has been allowed under EU rules to be brought by ship. The refined oil is under an export ban by the EU, however refined oil has been shipped to the EU and the US in 2023. Seaexpress a product tanker managed by Thenamaris Ship Management collected 40,000 tons on 10 August 2023 and delivered it on 23 August to Rotterdam. Ship-to-ship transfers were used to send Naphtha from Burgas to the US in June 2023. Bulgaria is cancelling the export quotas given to the refinery from 1 January 2024. The European Commission is investigating the situation. Bulgaria will also cease the importation of Russian crude oil on 1 March 2024.\nCrude Oil\nThe embargo came into effect on 5 December 2022 with a 45-day transition period, all ships had to load by 5 December 2022 and unload at the destination port before 19 January 2023.\nAround 100 tankers are under investigation by the US in November 2023, with management companies being asked to provide evidence that the price cap has not been breached by the tankers. The EU/G7 countries put pressure on crude oil tanker flag countries in late 2023 to run better checks that their crude oil tankers are not breaching the $60 price cap limit.\nShips believed to be in violation of the embargo\nTons delivered and numbers of crude oil tankers identified in probably being in violation of the embargo, in 2023, through direct delivery or

Lloyd's List defines a tanker as \"dark fleet if it is aged 15 years or over, anonymously owned and/or has a corporate structure designed to obfuscate beneficial ownership discovery, solely deployed in sanctioned oil trades, and engaged in one or more of the deceptive shipping practices outlined by US State Department guidance issued in May 2020.\"\nSanctioned shipmanagement companies\nThe UK Government have sanctioned the following management companies under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018:\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto; width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:10%;\"|Month\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:25%;\"|Sanctioned manager\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:20%;\"|ships under management\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:10%;\"|Flags\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:30%;\"|Note\n|-\n| May 2023 || Sun Ship Management (D) Ltd  Dubai, United Arab Emirates || 92 vessels  oil, LNG and chemical tankers || || probably owned by Sovcomflot  tankers owned by Sovcomflot\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" | December 2023 || Oil Tankers (SCF) Management  Dubai, United Arab Emirates || 61 tankers || || tankers owned by Sovcomflot\n|-\n| K&O Ship Management  Dubai, United Arab Emirates ||4 tankers || Panama ||  owners unknown,  management changed to Prominent Shipmangement Ltd, China\n|-\n| Radiating World Shipping Services LLC ♦  Dubai, United Arab Emirates ||rowspan=\"2\"| 17 tankers:  nine aframaxes  three suezmax tankers  five product tankers || rowspan=\"2\"| Cook Islands || owners unknown\n|-\n| Star Voyages Shipping Services L.L.C ♦  Dubai, United Arab Emirates || owners unknown\n|}\n* ♦ Companies have been moving tankers to other managers including One Moon Marine Services LLC.\nThe US Government have sanctioned the following management companies being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024:\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto; width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:10%;\"|Month\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:25%;\"|Sanctioned company\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:30%;\"|ships\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:10%;\"|Flags\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:25%;\"|Note\n|-\n|-\n| December 2023 || SUN Ship Management D Ltd  Dubai, United Arab Emirates manager || SCF Primorye and others || || tankers owned by Sovcomflot\n|-\n| January 2024 || Hennesea Shipping Co Ltd Dubai, United Arab Emirates  owner || HS Atlantica and 17 others including five chemical/product tankers || Liberia || tankers owned by Hennesea Shipping Co and ultimately by Sovcomflot.\n|}\nInsurance of tankers\nSuspected breaches of sanctions by insurance companies are investigated. Sometimes the insurance company is provided with false information regarding the source of the cargo, its price, the destination, and even the ships name and IMO number when an application for insurance is made.\nIn December 2023 an insurance company Continental Steamship Owners Mutual Protecting & Indemnity Association Ltd. incorporated in the Marshall Islands, but based in Estonia, was “forcibly dissolved”. The company was insuring 27 elderly, anonymously owned tankers, 10 of which appear to have been using fraudulently issued IMO company numbers.\nFlag state and tankers\nSuspected breaches of sanctions by flag states are investigated. Pressure is being put on nations to increase oversight of ships carrying their flags, both to ensure they do not breach sanctions but to also enforce safety and environmental standards.\nMost tankers suspected of breaching sanctions since 2021 fly the flag of Liberia, Liberia's flag registry is administered by a private US company based in Virginia, USA, as is the Marshall Islands flag. Panama, Gabon, the Cook Islands, Palau and Vietnam all flag more than 5% of tankers suspected of breaches.\nCameroon flagged ships were banned from entering United Arab Emirates ports due to safety concerns from January 2024, many of their tankers are old and ply their trade with Russia whilst having a poor safety record.\nSale of tankers\nSanctions announced in December 2023 require notification rules to be followed for the sale of tankers to any third country to make it transparent in an attempt to identify tankers that could be used to evade the import ban on Russian crude or petroleum products.\nSee also\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences"
