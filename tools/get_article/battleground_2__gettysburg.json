Terrain hex maps are 3D or 2D with various scales and sizes.\nThe basic platform for the Battleground series involves individual infantry and cavalry regiments, artillery batteries, and commanders. All are rated for strength, firepower, weaponry, morale, and movement. As a unit takes fire, it may become fatigued, disordered, or routed to the rear. Players compete against the computer's artificial intelligence or against another player via modem. Players may try a variety of 25 individual scenarios, or refight the entire Battle of Gettysburg.

The magazine's August issue that year reported that Gettysburg had sold more than 60,000 copies.\nThe editors of PC Gamer US and Computer Gaming World nominated Gettysburg as their pick for 1995's best computer wargame. Computer Gaming World reviewers argued Gettysburg \"is so much sheer fun that it could have captured top honors in many prior years. As the Battleground series continues to mature, it continues to blend the best elements of board games and miniatures with the strengths of computer wargames.\" A reviewer for PC PowerPlay provided a less positive review, noting \"the whole front end of the game is disappointing\" with limited game options and scenarios, although praising the battle detail as \"exceptional\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.gamesfirst.com/reviews/rick/Getty/Getty.htm Games First review]\n* [http://www.gamefaqs.com/computer/doswin/data/196726.html GameFAQs]"
