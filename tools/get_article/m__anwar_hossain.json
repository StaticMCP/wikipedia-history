With over 1400 citations, Hossain is one of the most cited plant scientists in Bangladesh. His works have appeared in premier scientific journals including the Journal of Biological Chemistry, Plant Physiology, Plant Molecular Biology and Plant and Cell Physiology. Hossain serves in the Editorial Board of Bioresearch Communications. After his PhD he returned to Bangladesh for 2–3 years, and then again went to Kyoto Prefectural University as a part of a Biotechnology Career Fellowship Program (1987–1990). This time he studied plant genetic engineering.\nFrom 1991 to 1994 and 1995–1996 he worked at Purdue University, USA and Kyoto University, Japan respectively as visiting scientist (full-time professor) during which he worked for developing submergence (flood) tolerant rice.\nAfter the fall of the Sheikh Hasina led Awami League government, Hossain was assaulted outside Shahjalal International Airport on 9 August 2024.
