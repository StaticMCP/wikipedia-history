He was carpenter by trade, and was contemporary with Thomas Edwards (Twm o'r Nant).\nIn 1747 he invited the revivalists into his home and in 1749 he started preaching himself, but returned to the established church following the split between Howel Harris and Daniel Rowland. In 1761 he left his home at Tan-y-fron and went to live at Brynbugad, where he rejoined the Methodists. When the South Wales preachers visited to North Wales, Edward Parry was again inspired and gained in popularity as a powerful preacher. As a result, he was invited to preach in the London chapels.\nIn 1773 he built a chapel on his land at Tan-y-fron and the following year worked with Twm o'r Nant and David James of Llansannan to publish a series of hymns and psalms.\nParry died aged 63 and was buried in Llansannan churchyard.\nBibliography\n*Goleuad Cymru (Caerleon 1820–1830), 1827, pages 446, 464, 490, 516, 558\n*Methodistiaeth Cymru (1851–1856), pages i, 143–6, iii, 113-25\n*Enwogion y Ffydd, 1880\n*''Emynau a'u Hawduriaid by J.
