He was born in February 1831 at Grandtully Castle near Pitlochry in Perthshire.\nHe entered the Army on 2 June 1847 as an Ensign in the 93rd Sutherland Highlanders.  After four years home service, he attained his promotion as Lieutenant, becoming a Captain two years later on 29 December 1854.  In February 1854, on the outbreak of war with Russia, the 93rd Highlanders embarked for the Crimea, where they were destined to see much fighting and to win great renown.\nStewart was present at the Battle of Alma on 20 September that year, when the 93rd, as part of the Highland Brigade, 1st Division, stormed the Great Russian Battery on the Alma Heights with the other Highland Regiments and Foot Guards (93rd losses: 1 officer, 54 men). He was also present at the Battle of Balaklava a month later on 25 October, where the 93rd alone formed the now famous 'Thin Red Line' which, unsupported, repulsed the charge of a large body of the enemy's cavalry, and thereby prevented a direct assault on the port of Balaklava. He also served in the Siege of Sevastopol through the winter of 1854/5. He was wounded in the trenches above the besieged port, and remained in the Crimea until July 1856, when his regiment returned to England.\nFor his services in the Campaign, Stewart received the Crimean Medal with clasp for Alma, Balaclava and Sebastopol, the Turkish Medal and the Order of the Medjidie (5th class).\nIndian Mutiny\nThe following summer found the 93rd on its way to India, where the laurels gained in the Crimea were to be more than doubled. The regiment reached Calcutta in September 1857, just in time to join Sir Colin Campbell's advance to relieve the Siege of Lucknow. The heroic achievements of Sir Colin's few forces are now matters of history, foremost among them stand the operations of 16 November: the Capture of the Secunderabagh and the Shah Najaf, deeds with which the name of the 93rd will ever be associated. The first VC exploit of that day was undertaken by Captain George Stewart, whose action was witnessed by Surgeon William Munro of the 93rd Highlanders.\nWhile the artillery was being brought to bear on the Sikandarabagh, Capt. Stewart, with some Highlanders and a few of the 53rd Regiment of Foot, advanced towards two of the enemy's guns, which were maintaining a heavy flanking fire and which covered the approach to the barracks, a large cross-shaped building surrounded by outhouses. Stewart captured the guns in a most gallant manner, and by this means his force was able to gain possession of the barracks .  Field Marshal The Lord Roberts described the action as \"serviceable as it was heroic, for it silenced the fire most destructive to the attacking force\". The possession of this building secured the left of the British advance, and greatly facilitated the ultimate withdrawal of the garrison of Lucknow.\n' to repulse Russian Cavalry at the Battle of Balaklava, Crimea 25 Oct 1854, action in which Capt. Stewart was involved, painted by Robert Gibb]]\nStewart was 26 years old, and a captain in the 93rd (Sutherland) Highlanders when he was awarded the Victoria Cross for his above actions at Lucknow. He was gazetted on 24 December 1858 and his citation read:\n}}\nSix Victoria Crosses in all were bestowed on the 93rd Highlanders for their gallantry on 16 November, but Sir Colin Campbell decided, perhaps fearing that he might be accused of partiality, that only one of these should be given to the officers. Votes were taken and Capt. Stewart was chosen by his brother officers to receive the much prized honour. A total of 18 Victoria Crosses were awarded to British forces at Lucknow on 16 November 1857, the largest number ever awarded in a single day.\nAfter the withdrawal of the Lucknow garrison, Sir Colin's Army was hurried back to Cawnpore. Stewart took part in the great battle which ensued there on 6 December. His regiment was in the thick of the fighting, and two days later, it formed part of the force under Sir Hope Grant. It completed the destruction of the Gwalior rebels as they were attempting to cross the Ganges at Oude. After two months of minor operations, the 93rd fought its way in to Lucknow under Sir Colin Campbell, and distinguished itself as on the previous occasion. Stewart took part in the storming of the Mogum's Palace on 11 March 1858,and, with characteristic daring, led a small party beyond the building in pursuit of the mutineers.\nWith Lucknow captured, the 93rd was sent into Rohilkand under Brigadier-General Walpole, helped to defeat the enemy at Alaganj, and fought under Sir Colin Campbell at Bareilly. There the regiment remained throughout the hot weather. In the following winter, it took part in the pacification of Oude, which was finally accomplished by the beginning of 1859.\nFor his services in this campaign, besides the Victoria Cross, Capt. Stewart received the mutiny medal with clasp for Lucknow.\nWilliam Stewart was promoted Major but left the Army in 1860. On 19 October 1868, while at Hythe, Hampshire, Stewart was giving a demonstration of sword swallowing.  His trick went fatally wrong and he died from internal injuries a week later, on 26 October. William Stewart predeceased his father.\nSee also\n*List of Indian Mutiny Victoria Cross recipients\n*List of Victoria Cross recipients (N–Z)\n*List of Scottish Victoria Cross recipients\nReferences\nBibliography\n* The Journal of the Victoria Cross Society, 150th Indian Mutiny Anniversary Edition, Oct 2007.\n*Monuments to Courage (David Harvey, 1999)\n*The Register of the Victoria Cross (This England, 1997)\n*Scotland's Forgotten Valour (Graham Ross, 1995)\n* Military History of Perthshire (edited by the Duchess of Athol).\n* Historical Records of the 93rd Sutherland Highlanders (compiled and edited by Roderick Hamilton Burgoyne, late 93rd Highlanders.
