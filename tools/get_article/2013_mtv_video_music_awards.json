The performance began with Cyrus performing \"We Can't Stop\" in bear-themed attire. Following this, Thicke entered the stage and Cyrus stripped down to a flesh-colored two-piece latex outfit while they performed \"Blurred Lines\" in a duet. Cyrus subsequently touched Thicke's crotch area with a giant manicured foam finger and twerked against him.\nCritics broadly panned the performance, while fans and celebrities were shocked. Parents expressed outrage over the performance. An article published in The Hollywood Reporter described the performance as \"crass\" and \"reminiscent of a bad acid trip\". The performance was described by XXL critic B. J. Steiner as a \"trainwreck in the classic sense of the word as the audience reaction seemed to be a mix of confusion, dismay and horror in a cocktail of embarrassment\", while the BBC said Cyrus stole the show with a \"raunchy performance\". Katy Kroll of Rolling Stone magazine wrote in 2014, \"there were dancing teddy bears, an overused foam finger, an unflattering flesh-colored bikini, some very obvious groping and twerking – lots and lots of twerking. For lack of a better term, it was a hot mess.\" A Telegraph article described Cyrus' actions as her going into \"overdrive [...] trying to kill off her Disney millstone, Hannah Montana\". The performance generated 306,100 tweets per minute on Twitter, Cyrus' performance resulted in a gain of over 213,000 Twitter followers, 226,000 likes on Facebook, and 90,000 downloads of her new single, \"Wrecking Ball\", within days of the controversial performance. This amounted to a total 112% increase in Cyrus' social media activity. The performance topped Twitter during the East Coast telecast, with Timberlake behind with 219,800 tweets per minute at its peak. The most-mentioned performers on Twitter were Cyrus (4.5&nbsp;million), Timberlake (2.9&nbsp;million) and Lady Gaga (1.9&nbsp;million).\nSee also\n*2013 MTV Europe Music Awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
