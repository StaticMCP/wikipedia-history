He threatened to invade Holland if the Habsburg Netherlands would gather a fleet in support of Christopher of Oldenburg to lift the siege of Copenhagen. Mary of Hungary nevertheless ordered Adolf of Burgundy to compose a fleet of 45 Dutch, Spanish, and Portuguese ships with 3,000 sailors and 4,500 troops under command of Frederick II, Elector Palatine. She also sent Georg Schenck van Toutenburg with the soldiers to Groningen to eliminate the threat of the enemy troops there.\nSchenck van Toutenburg was allowed by the citizens to occupy the City of Groningen and continued towards Appingedam. The two armies did battle near Heiligerlee and Meindert van Ham was defeated.\nConsequences\nBefore the Dutch fleet was ready to sail, Copenhagen fell in the hands of Christian III of Denmark, and peace was concluded in the Count's Feud.\nHabsburg became master of Groningen and Drenthe, which were renamed Lordship of Groningen and County of Drenthe. Charles of Guelders was forced to sign the Treaty of Grave.\nSources\n* Israel, J.I.,The Dutch Republic; Its rise, greatness, and fall 1477-1806 (Oxford 1998), 63-64."
