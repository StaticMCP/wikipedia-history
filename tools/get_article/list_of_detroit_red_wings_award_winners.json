They are members of the Atlantic Division in the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL) and are one of the \"Original Six\" teams of the league. The franchise and its members have won numerous team and individual awards and honors. The first team trophy acquired by the club was the Prince of Wales Trophy in 1934, at the time awarded to the champion of the American Division.  Their most recent team trophy was the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl in 2009, taken in honor of being the champions of the Western Conference. The team has captured the Stanley Cup as league champion eleven times, most recently in 2008.\nGordie Howe is the team's most decorated player, with six wins each of the Art Ross Trophy as regular season scoring leader and the Hart Memorial Trophy as regular season most valuable player (MVP), twenty-one selections to the First and Second Team All-Stars (the most in league history), twenty-two appearances in the All-Star Game, the Lester Patrick Trophy for outstanding contributions to the sport in the United States, and the NHL Lifetime Achievement Award for long term contributions to hockey.  Nicklas Lidstrom has the most awards of any defenseman, having once won the Conn Smythe Trophy as post season MVP to go along with having won the James Norris Memorial Trophy (Norris Trophy) seven times as the best defenseman in the league as well as twelve selections to the First and Second Team All-Stars and twelve selections to the All-Star Game. Terry Sawchuk leads goaltenders with three wins of the Vezina Trophy as the league's best goaltender, seven selections to the First and Second Team All-Stars, seven selections to the All-Star Game, the Lester Patrick Trophy, and the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league's best rookie. Howe, Lidstrom, and Sawchuk have all had their uniform number retired by the team and have all been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.\nThree Red Wings have been the inaugural recipient of an award and three awards are named in honor of former Red Wings.  In 1932 Carl Voss was named the first winner of the Calder Memorial Trophy.  The first time the Norris Trophy was awarded was in 1954, when Red Kelly won.  In 2007 Chris Chelios was named the first annual winner of the Mark Messier Leadership Award, the award previously having been given on a monthly basis. The Jack Adams Award, given to the best coach, is named for Jack Adams, long-time head coach and general manager of the club.  The Norris Trophy takes its name from James E. Norris, who owned the club from 1932 to 1952.  In 2010, the Lester B. Pearson Award was renamed the Ted Lindsay Award to recognize Ted Lindsay \"for his skill, tenacity, leadership, and for his role in establishing the original Players' Association.\"\nLeague awards\nTeam trophies\nThe Detroit Red Wings have won the O'Brien Trophy five times, the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl and the Presidents' Trophy six times each, the Stanley Cup eleven times, and the Prince of Wales Trophy thirteen times.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"70%\"\n|+Team trophies awarded to the Detroit Red Wings\n! scope=\"col\" |Award\n! scope=\"col\" |Description\n! scope=\"col\" |Times won\n! scope=\"col\" |Seasons\n! scope=\"col\" |References\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Stanley Cup\n|NHL championship\n|11\n|, , , , , , , , , ,\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |O'Brien Trophy\n|NHL championship runner-up\n|5\n|, , , ,\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Clarence S.

Sixty-four All-Star Games have been held since 1947, with at least one player chosen to represent the Red Wings in each year. The All-Star game has not been held in various years: 1979 and 1987 due to the 1979 Challenge Cup and Rendez-vous '87 series between the NHL and the Soviet national team, respectively, 1995, 2005, and 2013 as a result of labor stoppages, 2006, 2010, and 2014 because of the Winter Olympic Games, 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2025 when it was replaced by the 2025 4 Nations Face-Off.\nDetroit has hosted five of the games. The 4th, 6th, 8th, and 9th games all took place at the Detroit Olympia. On October 8, 1950, the Red Wings, winner of the 1950 Stanley Cup Finals, played a team of All-Stars in the 4th All-Star Game. Only 9,166 people attended the game, making it is the smallest attendance figure in All-Star Game history. Ted Lindsay scored the first hat trick in an All-Star Game, as the Red Wings won 7–1. The 6th All-Star Game was held on October 5, 1952. For the second year in a row, the format had the First and Second Team All-Stars, with additional players on each team, play each other. After the game ended in a tie for the second year in a row, the NHL decided that they would continue with the previous format of the Stanley Cup winner playing an all-star team. The Red Wings won both the 1954 Stanley Cup Finals and the 1955 Stanley Cup Finals and so hosted the 8th and 9th All-Star Games, each on October 2.  The 1954 match ended in a 2–2 tie while the Red Wings won the 1955 game by a score of 3–1. The 32nd National Hockey League All-Star Game  was held at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit on February 5, 1980. The Wales Conference all-star team won for the fifth consecutive time. Gordie Howe, then of the Hartford Whalers, appeared in his twenty-third and final All-Star game, his first twenty-two coming during his career in Detroit.\nplayed in 10 All-Star Games as a Red Wing]]\nhas coached two All-Star Games|alt=Mike Babcock at a press conference]]\nwas selected to play in two All-Star Games|alt=Chris Osgood during a game]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\"\n|+Detroit Red Wings players and coaches selected to the All-Star Game\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" | Game\n!scope=\"col\" | Year\n!scope=\"col\" | Name\n!scope=\"col\" | Position\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| References\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" |\n|rowspan=\"3\" |1947\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"  rowspan=\"5\" |\n|rowspan=\"5\" |1948\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"5\" |\n|rowspan=\"5\" |1949\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n!

The first was the Ace Bailey Benefit Game, held in 1934, after a violent collision with Eddie Shore of the Boston Bruins left Ace Bailey of the Toronto Maple Leafs hospitalized and unable to continue his playing career.  In 1937 the Howie Morenz Memorial Game was held to raise money for the family of Howie Morenz of the Montreal Canadiens who died from complications after being admitted to the hospital for a broken leg.  The Babe Siebert Memorial Game was held in 1939 to raise funds for the family of the Canadiens' Babe Siebert who drowned shortly after he retired from playing.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\"\n|+Detroit Red Wings players and coaches selected to All-Star benefit games\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" | Game\n!scope=\"col\" | Year\n!scope=\"col\" | Name\n!scope=\"col\" | Position\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| References\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" |\n|rowspan=\"2\" |1934\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\" |\n|rowspan=\"4\" |1937\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"4\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" |\n|rowspan=\"2\" |1939\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|}\nCareer achievements\nHockey Hall of Fame\nMany members of the Red Wings organization have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.

All of those players have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. The most recently retired number is that of Red Kelly, whose number was retired on February 1, 2019.\nThe Red Wings have also made the number 6 of Larry Aurie and the number 16 of Vladimir Konstantinov no longer available for issue. However, the numbers are not considered to be officially retired. Although Aurie's uniform was retired in 1938 by James E. Norris, current team owner Mike Ilitch does not consider the number to be retired. Konstantinov's number has not been issued to any player since he was permanently disabled in a vehicle accident after the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals. Number 99 is also unavailable due to having been retired by the league in honor of Wayne Gretzky.\nThe banners with the retired numbers hanging at Joe Louis Arena.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\"\n|+ Detroit Red Wings retired numbers\n! scope=\"col\" |Number\n! scope=\"col\" |Player\n! scope=\"col\" |Position\n! scope=\"col\" |Years with Red Wings as a player\n! scope=\"col\" |Date of retirement ceremony\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |References\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1\n|\n|\n|1949–55, 1957–64, 1968–69\n|March 6, 1994\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |4\n|\n|\n|1947–60\n|February 1, 2019\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |5\n|\n|\n|1991–2012\n|March 6, 2014\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |7\n|\n|\n|1944–57, 1964–65\n|November 10, 1991\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |9\n|\n|\n|1946–71\n|March 12, 1972\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |10\n|\n|\n|1950–73\n|November 10, 1991\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |12\n|\n|\n|1938–52\n|April 29, 1995\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |19\n|\n|\n|1983–2006\n|January 2, 2007\n|\n|}\nOther awards\nin 1970|alt=Bobby Baun, then with the Toronto Maple Leafs, in the penalty box during a game]]\nMembers of the club have also won various non-league awards that are designated for or typically given to NHL players.
