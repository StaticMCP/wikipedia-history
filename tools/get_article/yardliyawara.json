Today they are considered one of the larger grouping known as the Adnyamathanha people.\nLanguage\nThe Yardliyawara language is classified as one of the Karnic languages, though this has been disputed, and is now classified as a dialect of Yarli.\nCountry\nNorman Tindale describes their tribal lands as extending over some , from east of the northern sector of the Flinders Ranges, from Wertaloona south to Carrieton and Cradock. In an easterly direction the boundaries ran to Frome Downs and Holowilena Station on Siccus River. To the west the boundaries extended to Arkaba and Hawker.\nPeople\nThe Yardliyawara are often subsumed under a collective tribal grouping as one of the Adnyamathanha, which embraces also several other distinct groups such as the Wailpi, Kuyani, Pilatapa, and Barngarla. Their territory around Wertaloona had a variety of sandstone that could be used to manufacture millstones, and northern tribes would come down to trade for it.\nCultural practices\nThe Yardliyawara imposed circumcision on young males undergoing initiation, but refused to adopt the rite of subincision practised by some of their neighbours.\nAlternative names\n*Jadliaura\n* Yadliaura\n* Yadlikowera, Yaldikowera (error of transposition of d and l)\n* Arkaba-tura (This ethnonym combines the toponym Arkaba with the word for 'man', tura.)\n* Wonoka (toponym)\n* Eura (this is a generic ethnonym covering several tribes)\nSome words\n* wilka (tame dog)\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
