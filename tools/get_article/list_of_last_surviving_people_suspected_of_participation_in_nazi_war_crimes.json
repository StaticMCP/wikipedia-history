      "text": "# List of last surviving people suspected of participation in Nazi war crimes\n\nThis is a list of the last surviving people suspected of participation in Nazi war crimes, based on wanted lists published by Efraim Zuroff of the Simon Wiesenthal Center. Beginning in 2002, Zuroff produced an Annual Status Report on the Worldwide Investigation and Prosecution of Nazi war criminals which from 2004 to 2018 included a list of the \"most-wanted\" criminals who had never been convicted. Of those who have been charged for Nazi war crimes in the 21st century, many died awaiting trial, died during the appeals process, or died while waiting to be deported. Very few served actual prison time due to their advanced age which made their sentences (if any) symbolic. On the other hand, some listed here had all charges against them cleared after the fact.\nOver 200,000 Nazis are estimated to have been perpetrators of Nazi-era crimes. Of these, roughly 140,000 cases were brought between 1945 and 2005. According to professor Mary Fulbrook, only 6,656 of them were ever convicted. It remains unknown how many or if any legitimate Nazi fugitives remain today. The National WWII Museum reported in 2023 that those who served are now \"in their 90s or older\". However, The Washington Post estimated in 2014 that the hunt for fugitives could possibly continue into the 2040s, citing the \"age someone would have had to have been at the time\" and \"average life expectancy\".\nLocated\nThose marked in yellow are still living.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=100px |Name\n! width=100px |Served in\n! width=100px |Position/Rank\n! width=100px |Tried/Convicted\n! width=50px |Date of birth\n! width=50px |Date of death\n! width=50px |Last residence\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Short summary\n|-\n|\n| Aktion T4\n| Medical professor\n| No/No\n| align=\"center\"|\n| align=\"center\"|   (Age )\n| Germany\n| A former medical professor at the University of Jena, Albrecht was accused of killing a patient in 1941, as part of the Nazi euthanasia program which carried out mass killings of the mentally ill and physically disabled.

In 2019, he was charged with complicity in the murder of 5,232 prisoners. Due to his age at the time of the crimes, Dey was tried in a juvenile court. He acknowledged serving as a guard but denied being a Nazi supporter or directly participating in killings. In July 2020, the court found him guilty of accessory to murder and sentenced him to two years' probation.\n|-\n| Milivoj Ašner\n| Croatian police\n| Police officer\n| No/No\n| align=\"center\"|\n| align=\"center\"|   (Age )\n| Austria\n| Ašner served as the police chief of Slavonska Požega, Croatia, and was accused of taking part in the persecution and deportation of hundreds of Serbs, Jews and Romani to concentration camps operated by the Ustaše.

In 2011, Csatáry was discovered to be living in Budapest, and the following year he was charged with war crimes by Hungarian authorities. In 2013, a Slovak court commuted his death sentence to life imprisonment and sought his extradition. In the same year, Hungarian courts suspended his case on the grounds of double jeopardy. Csatáry died in August 2013 while awaiting trial, aged 98.\n|-\n| Algimantas Dailidė\n| Lithuanian Security Police\n| -\n| Yes/Yes (never served sentence)\n| align=\"center\" |\n| align=\"center\" |   (Age )\n| Germany\n| Dailidė served in the Lithuanian Security Police (Saugumas) in Vilnius and took part in the persecution of Polish Jews in the Vilna Ghetto.

He was denaturalized in 1981 and extradited to Israel, and in 1988 he was convicted of crimes against humanity and sentenced to death. The verdict was overturned by the Supreme Court of Israel in 1993 after new evidence cast doubt on his identity. Demjanjuk returned to the US and regained his citizenship, but was denaturalized a second time in 2002 when new allegations arose. He was extradited to Germany in 2009, convicted in 2011 and sentenced to five years in prison pending appeal. Demjanjuk died in March 2012 before his appeals could be completed, which in effect voided his prior conviction.\n|-\n| Peter Egner\n| Sicherheitsdienst\n|\n| No/No\n| align=\"center\" |\n| align=\"center\" |   (Age )\n| United States\n| An ethnic German born in Yugoslavia, Egner served in the Sicherheitsdienst in Belgrade from 1941 to 1943, during which time the unit participated in the mass murder of more than 17,000 civilians.

His sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment, but in 1952 he escaped from prison and fled to Germany. Several attempts to extradite him were unsuccessful.

In June 2024, a German court ruled that Formanek was unfit to stand trial, though an appeal would be likely. A Frankfurt court later would order him to stand trial in December 2024. However, Fornamek died on April 2, 2025, a few days before a ruling could be made by the regional court in Hanau on whether he could stand trial; his death would be reported 28 days after it happened.

Zentai emigrated to Australia after the war. In 2005, Hungary issued an international arrest warrant against Zentai and requested his extradition. After a prolonged legal fight, the High Court of Australia ruled in 2012 that he could not be extradited, as the offense of \"war crime\" did not exist in Hungary in 1944. Zentai died in January 2018 in Perth at the age of 96.\n|}\nNever located alive\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=100px |Name\n! width=100px |Position\n! width=50px |Date of birth\n! width=50px |Date of death\n! width=50px |Last known residence\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Short summary\n|-\n| Petras Bernotavičius (Peter Bernes)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| Bernatavicius was deputy to the Nazi-appointed mayor of Kupiškis, Lithuania, and was accused of organizing the killing of more than 1,000 Jews in Kupiškis in 1941. He moved to the United States after the war but fled to Lithuania in 2002, shortly before his US citizenship was revoked. Petras was not mentioned on the most wanted Nazi fugitive list when it was last updated in 2018.\n|-\n| Alois Brunner\n| Hauptsturmführer\n| align=\"center\"|\n| align=\"center\"|   (Age )\n|\n| The former assistant of Adolf Eichmann, Brunner was responsible for the deportation of over 100,000 Jews to Nazi death camps in Eastern Europe. He fled Germany at the end of the war for Egypt, then Syria, where he lived for decades under Syrian protection and escaped multiple manhunts and investigations. Brunner was last seen in 2001 but his fate remained unconfirmed until 2014, when it was reported that he had died in Syria.\n|-\n| Mikhail Gorshkow\n| Gestapo\n| align=\"center\"|\n| align=\"center\"|   (Age )\n|\n| Born in Estonia, Gorshkow served as an interpreter and interrogator for the Gestapo in Belarus and was accused of taking part in the massacre of 3,000 Jews in Slutsk. In 2002, it was reported that a man with the surname \"Gorshkow\" fled to the United States after the war but was denaturalized and moved to Estonia. Estonian authorities closed the case against Gorshkow in 2011, claiming that his identity could not be proved beyond reasonable doubt.

Heim's whereabouts remained unclear, although in 2009 it was reported that he had been living in Egypt and had died in Cairo in 1992, which was confirmed by a court in Baden-Baden. The Simon Wiesenthal Center disputed the finding and Heim remained on Nazi fugitive list until 2013.\n|-\n| Y (unnamed)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| The unnamed person was accused of being accessory to the murder of Hungarian Jews in Auschwitz.
