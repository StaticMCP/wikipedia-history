The conflict grew out of the rival imperialist ambitions of the Russian Empire and the Japanese Empire over Manchuria and Korea. The major theatres of operations were Southern Manchuria, specifically the area around the Liaodong Peninsula and Mukden, and the seas around Korea, Japan, and the Yellow Sea.\nThe Russians were in constant pursuit of a warm-water port on the Pacific Ocean, for their navy as well as for maritime trade. The recently established Pacific seaport of Vladivostok was the only active Russian port that was reasonably operational during the summer season; but Port Arthur would be operational all year. Negotiations between the Tsar's government and Japan between the end of the First Sino-Japanese War and 1903 had proved futile. The Japanese chose war to maintain exclusive dominance in Korea.\nThe resulting campaigns, in which the fledgling Japanese military consistently attained victory over the Russian forces arrayed against them, were unexpected by world observers. These victories, as time transpired, would dramatically transform the balance of power in East Asia, resulting in a sober reassessment of Japan's recent entry onto the world stage. The embarrassing string of defeats increased dissatisfaction of the Russian populace with the inefficient and corrupt Tsarist government, and was a major cause of the Russian Revolution of 1905.\nList of battles\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"100%\"\n! width=\"12%\" style=\"background: #FFEBAD\" | Battle\n! width=\"26%\" style=\"background: #FFEBAD\" | Location\n! width=\"16%\" style=\"background: #FFEBAD\" | Date\n! width=\"36%\" style=\"background: #FFEBAD\" class=\"unsortable\"| Notes\n! width=\"10%\" style=\"background: #FFEBAD\" | Result\n|-\n| Battle of Port Arthur\n| Port Arthur, Manchuria (modern Lüshunkou)\n| February 8&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;9, 1904\n| The Imperial Japanese Navy attacks the Russian Pacific Fleet at Port Arthur.\n| bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\"|Inconclusive\n|-\n| Battle of Chemulpo Bay\n| Chemulpo Bay, Korea (modern Incheon)\n| February 9, 1904\n| The Imperial Japanese Navy completes its attack of the Russian Pacific Fleet at Chemulpo Bay.\n| bgcolor=\"#FFA7A7\"|Japanese victory\n|-\n| Battle of the Yalu River\n| Wiju, Korea (modern Uiju)\n| April 30&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;May 1, 1904\n| Russian forces fail to hold a line at the Yalu River in the face of a Japanese attack.\n| bgcolor=\"#FFA7A7\"|Japanese victory\n|-\n| Battle of Nanshan\n| Liaotung peninsula, Manchuria (modern Liaodong peninsula)\n| May 25&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;26, 1904\n| Japanese troops take Chinchou and Dalny.\n| bgcolor=\"#FFA7A7\"|Japanese victory\n|-\n| Battle of Te-li-Ssu\n| Outside Wafangdian, Manchuria\n| June 14&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;15, 1904\n| Japanese and Russian forces skirmish near Wafangdian.\n| bgcolor=\"#FFA7A7\"|Japanese victory\n|-\n|Hitachi Maru Incident\n|Tsushima Strait\n|15 June,\n1904\n|three Japanese military transports were sunk in a Russian commerce raiding sortie by a Vladivostok-based armored cruiser squadron of the Imperial Russian Navy\n| bgcolor= \"#A7C8FF\"|Russian victory\n|-\n| Battle of Motien Pass\n| Liaotung peninsula, Manchuria (modern Liaodong peninsula)\n| June 27, 1904\n| Russian troops abandon the critical Motien Pass.\n| bgcolor=\"#FFA7A7\"|Japanese victory\n|-\n| Battle of Tashihchiao\n| Tashihchiao, Manchuria (modern Dashiqiao)\n| July 24&ndash;25, 1904\n| Japanese forces take the village of Tashihchiao.\n| bgcolor=\"#FFA7A7\"|Japanese victory\n|-\n| Siege of Port Arthur\n| Port Arthur, Manchuria (modern Lüshunkou)\n| July 30, 1904&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;January 2, 1905\n| Japanese forces successfully lay siege to Port Arthur.\n| bgcolor=\"#FFA7A7\"|Japanese victory\n|-\n| Battle of Hsimucheng\n| Hsimucheng, Manchuria\n| July 31, 1904\n| Russian forces are forced to abandon the village of Hsimucheng.\n| bgcolor=\"#FFA7A7\"|Japanese victory\n|-\n| Battle of the Yellow Sea\n| Off Shantung, Manchuria (modern Shandong)\n| August 10, 1904\n| The Japanese and Russian navies fight to a stalemate.\n| bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\"|Inconclusive\n|-\n| Battle off Ulsan\n| Off Ulsan, Korea\n| August 14\n| Russian naval units are forced to cease their interference with Japanese shipping.\n| bgcolor=\"#FFA7A7\"|Japanese victory\n|-\n| Battle of Korsakov\n| Off Korsakov, Russia\n| August 20\n| Russian cruiser Novik forced to scuttle herself.\n| bgcolor=\"#FFA7A7\"|Japanese victory\n|-\n| Battle of Liaoyang\n| Liaoyang, Manchuria\n| August 24&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;September 4, 1904\n| Japanese troops occupy Liaoyang.\n| bgcolor=\"#FFA7A7\"|Japanese victory\n|-\n| Battle of Shaho\n| Sha River, Manchuria\n| October 5&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;17, 1904\n| Both sides sustain heavy casualties in a Russian attack.\n| bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\"|Inconclusive\n|-\n| Battle of Sandepu\n| South of Mukden, Manchuria (modern Shenyang)\n| January 25&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;29, 1905\n| A Russian attack commences in freezing cold, causing both sides to sustain heavy casualties.\n| bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\"|Inconclusive\n|-\n| Battle of Mukden\n| Mukden, Manchuria (modern Shenyang)\n| February 20&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;March 10, 1905\n| Russian forces are encircled by Japanese and forced to abandon Mukden.\n| bgcolor=\"#FFA7A7\"|Japanese victory\n|-\n| Battle of Tsushima\n| Straits of Tsushima\n| May 27&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;28, 1905\n| The Japanese navy destroys the Russian fleet in the Straits of Tsushima.\n| bgcolor=\"#FFA7A7\"|Japanese victory\n|-\n| Raid on Yingkou\n| Manchuria\n|January 9th,\n1905\n|Russian troops were able to inflict a number of major defeats on the Japanese and disrupt logistics\nMost of the large warehouses in Yingkou were destroyed\n| bgcolor= \"#A7C8FF\"|Russian victory\n|}\nSee also\n* First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895)\n* Russian invasion of Manchuria (1900)\n* Russian Revolution of 1905\nReferences\n* Connaughton, Richard (2003).
