It was created for the 1956 Academy Awards, in which a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since.\nAs of 2025, Greece has been nominated five times in the category.\nSubmissions\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award.\nIn the 1990s, Greek film law stipulated that the winner of the Greek Film Competition at the Thessaloniki Film Festival would represent Greece at the Oscars the following year. After Greek films that were mostly in English (and thus ineligible for the Foreign Language Film award) won the award in 2005 and 2007, Greece decided to revise the selection process. Beginning in 2008, the Greek submission is determined by an ad hoc committee appointed under the auspices of the Greek Ministry of Culture. The first film to be selected under the new rules was Correction, since El Greco contained too much English to qualify.\nIn 2004, Greek film Nyfes was ruled ineligible for being in English. The country was allowed to change its submission, selecting A Touch of Spice.\nBelow is a list of the films that have been submitted by Greece for review by the Academy for the award by the year of the submission and the respective Academy Award ceremony.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!

The scandal involved accusations of interference by the Greek Culture Ministry in the selection committee's work, leading to widespread protests from filmmakers and industry organizations.\nThe controversy began when acclaimed Greek filmmaker Vasilis Kekatos, a winner of the Short Film Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, publicly claimed on Facebook that he and other members of the selection committee had been abruptly replaced by the ministry. Despite having been provided with codes and passwords to watch and rate the submitted Greek films, Kekatos alleged that the ministry had intervened to appoint a different committee. The Greek Culture Ministry responded to these allegations by denying that Kekatos and the other individuals mentioned in his post were ever officially chosen for the committee. The ministry asserted that the official committee members had been announced through its official channels on August 13, 2024.\nThe scandal had a significant impact on the submission process. In protest of the ministry's actions, 21 out of 26 films that had submitted their files withdrew from consideration, and two members of the newly appointed committee resigned. Additionally, local film organizations, unions, and the Hellenic Film Academy issued public statements demanding an investigation into the matter.\nFurthermore, one of the newly appointed committee members, film critic Dimitris Danikas, faced additional scrutiny, as he had been expelled from the Hellenic Film Academy due to publications deemed inconsistent with the Academy's moral standards.\nFollowing these events, Greek Deputy Culture Minister Jason Fotilas held a press conference on August 22, 2024, where he claimed that a Culture Ministry employee had taken the initiative to contact Kekatos and the other committee members on an unofficial list from the ministry’s Directorate of Cinema and Performance Arts, before the Deputy Minister had officially accepted it.\nAccording to Fotilas, “the employee apologized and said he acted out of overzealousness so that the procedures would run faster and we could save time,\" since the Academy’s August 15, 2024, deadline was fast approaching, and the Deputy Minister’s official approval was only a formality.\nAlthough several media questions remained unanswered during the press conference, Fotilas stated that he was open to discussions with the Hellenic Film Academy to find a solution that would secure the validity of the procedure, even though the Academy had complained that it had been trying for months to get an appointment with him to discuss the current selection process and other industry issues.\nFollowing the press conference, the Academy issued a statement asking the Deputy Culture Minister to consider the complete cancellation of the procedure and the non-submission of a proposal by our country for this year's Academy Award for Best International Feature Film.\nThe 2024 Greek Academy Awards submission scandal, which garnered international film media coverage, raised concerns about the transparency and fairness of the selection process. Critics argued that the government's involvement had compromised the independence of the committee and undermined the credibility of the Greek submission. The controversy also highlighted the need for reforms to ensure a more equitable and transparent system for future submissions.\nSee also\n*List of Academy Award winners and nominees for Best International Feature Film\n*List of Academy Award-winning foreign language films\n*List of Greek award-winning films in International Film Festivals\n*Cinema of Greece\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080707023727/http://www.oscars.org/awardsdatabase/ The Official Academy Awards Database]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080622050250/http://www.oscars.org/impc_site2/index.html The Motion Picture Credits Database]\n*[https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Academy_Awards_USA/ IMDb Academy Awards Page]"
