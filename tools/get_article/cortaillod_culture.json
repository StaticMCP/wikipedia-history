The Cortaillod Culture in the west of the region is contemporary with the Pfyn Culture\nin the east and dates from between 3900-3500 BC. The Classic Cortaillod culture of the western Alpine foreland and the Early Cortaillod culture of central Switzerland pre-date this at 4300-3900 BC.\nEvidence, such as higher frequencies of dog bones and pendants made from dog metapodials, suggests a special relationship between dog and man during the later part of this period in the western part and the early Horgen culture in the eastern part of the Alpine foreland.\nThe culture is named for the village of Cortaillod in the canton of Neuchâtel.\nGallery\nFile:Laténium-pointe-cristal.jpg|Crystal arrowhead, c. 3500 BC\nFile:Cortaillod gobelet IMG 6640.jpg|Goblets made from deer antler, c. 3580 BC\nFile:HMB Essen und Kochgerät Jungsteinzeit.jpg|Pottery, implements and foodstuffs\nFile:Axe IMG 6658.jpg|Axe\nFile:Yverdon-Clendy - 13 von 17.jpg|The Clendy megalithic alignment\nReferences\nSources\nSchibler, J. 2006.
