      "text": "# Timeline of the Yemeni civil war (2014–present)__disambig_1\n\nThe following is a timeline of the Yemeni civil war, which began in September 2014.\n2014\nAfter several weeks of street protests against the Hadi administration, which made cuts to fuel subsidies that were unpopular with the group, the Houthis fought the Yemen Army forces under the command of General Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar. In a battle that lasted only a few days, Houthi fighters seized control of Sanaa, the Yemeni capital, in September 2014. The Houthis forced Hadi to negotiate an agreement to end the violence, in which the government resigned and the Houthis gained an unprecedented level of influence over state institutions and politics.\n2015\nIn January 2015, unhappy with a proposal to split the country into six federal regions, Houthi fighters seized the presidential compound in Sanaʽa. The power play prompted the resignation of President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi and his ministers. The Houthi political leadership then announced the dissolution of parliament and the formation of a Revolutionary Committee to govern the country on 6 February 2015.\nOn 21 February, one month after Houthi militants confined Hadi to his residence in Sanaʽa, he slipped out of the capital and traveled to Aden. In a televised address from his hometown, he declared that the Houthi takeover was illegitimate and indicated he remained the constitutional president of Yemen. His predecessor as president, Ali Abdullah Saleh—who had been widely suspected of aiding the Houthis during their takeover of Sanaʽa the previous year—publicly denounced Hadi and called on him to go into exile.\nOn 19 March 2015, the troops loyal to Hadi clashed with those who refused to recognize his authority in the Battle of Aden Airport. The forces under General Abdul-Hafez al-Saqqaf were defeated, and al-Saqqaf fled toward Sanaʽa. In apparent retaliation for the routing of al-Saqqaf, warplanes reportedly flown by Houthi pilots bombed Hadi's compound in Aden.\nAfter 20 March 2015 Sanaa mosque bombings, in a televised speech, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, the leader of the Houthis, said his group's decision to mobilize for war was \"imperative\" under current circumstances and that Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and its affiliates—among whom he counts Hadi—would be targeted, as opposed to southern Yemen and its citizens. President Hadi declared Aden to be Yemen's temporary capital while Sanaʽa remained under Houthi control.\nAlso, the same day as the mosque bombings, al-Qaeda militants captured the provincial capital of Lahij, Al Houta District after killing about 20 soldiers before being driven out several hours later.\nPolitical developments\nHadi reiterated in a speech on 21 March 2015 that he was the legitimate president of Yemen and declared, \"We will restore security to the country and hoist the flag of Yemen in Sanaʽa, instead of the Iranian flag.\" He also declared Aden to be Yemen's \"economic and temporary capital\" due to the Houthi occupation of Sanaʽa, which he pledged would be retaken.\nIn Sanaa, the Houthi Revolutionary Committee appointed Major General Hussein Khairan as Yemen's new Defence Minister and placed him in overall command of the military offensive.\nControl of Taiz\nOn 22 March 2015, Houthi forces backed by troops loyal to Saleh entered Taiz, Yemen's third-largest city, and quickly took over its key points. They encountered little resistance, although one protester was shot dead and five were injured. Western media outlets began to suggest Yemen was sliding into civil war as the Houthis from the north confronted holdouts in the south.\nOn 14 December 2015, the pro-Saleh Yemeni Army and Houthi militants carried out a strike with an Tochka ballistic missile against a military camp that was being used by troops of the Saudi-led coalition, south-west of the city of Taiz.\nWestern Yemen advance\nOn 23 March 2015, Houthi forces advanced towards the strategic Bab-el-Mandeb strait, a vital corridor through which much of the world's maritime trade passes. The next day, fighters from the group reportedly entered the port of Mocha.\nOn 31 March 2015, Houthi fighters entered a coastal military base on the strait after the 17th Armoured Division of the Yemen Army opened the gates and turned over weapons to them.\nOn 2 April 2015, Mahamoud Ali Youssouf, the foreign minister of Djibouti, said the Houthis placed heavy weapons and fast attack boats on Perim and a smaller island in the Bab-el-Mandeb strait. He warned that the weapons posed \"a big danger\" to his country, commercial shipping traffic, and military vessels.\nSouthern offensive\nBattle of Dhale\nOn 24 March 2015, Houthi forces seized administrative buildings in Dhale (or Dali) amid heavy fighting, bringing them closer to Aden. However, Houthi fighters were swiftly dislodged from Ad Dali' and Kirsh by Hadi-loyal forces.\nFighting over Dhale continued even as the Houthis advanced further south and east. On 31 March 2015, Hadi loyalists clashed with the Houthis and army units loyal to Saleh.\nOn 1 April 2015, a pro-Houthi army brigade was said to have \"disintegrated\" after being pummeled by coalition warplanes in Ad Dali. The commander of the 33rd Brigade reportedly fled, and groups of pro-Houthi troops withdrew to the north.\nThe city reportedly fell into pro-government hands by the end of May.\nFighting in Lahij\nOn 24 March 2015, in the Lahij Governorate, heavy fighting erupted between Houthis and pro-Hadi fighters. The next day, Al Anad Air Base, 60 kilometers from Aden, was captured by the Houthis and their allies. The base had recently been abandoned by United States of America USSOCOM troops. Defense Minister Mahmoud al-Subaihi, one of Hadi's top lieutenants, was captured by the Houthis in Al Houta and transferred to Sanaʽa. Houthi fighters also advanced to Dar Saad, a small town, 20&nbsp;km north of Aden.\nOn 26 March 2015, after clashes erupted in Aden, Hadi loyalists counterattacked as a Saudi-led military intervention got underway. Artillery shelled Al Anad Air Base, forcing some of its Houthi occupants to flee the area. Saudi airstrikes also hit Al Anad. Despite the airstrikes, the southern offensive continued.\nFighting reaches Aden\nIn Aden, military officials said militias and military units loyal to Hadi had \"fragmented\" by 25 March, speeding the Houthi advance. They said the Houthis were fighting Hadi's troops on five different fronts. Aden International Airport suspended all flights. Fighting reached Aden's outskirts on 25 March 2015, with pro-Saleh soldiers taking over Aden International Airport and clashes erupting at an army base. Hadi reportedly fled his \"temporary capital\" by boat as the unrest worsened. On 26 March 2015, he resurfaced in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, where he arrived by plane and was met by Saudi Prince Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud.\nOver the following days, Houthi and allied army forces encircled Aden and hemmed in Hadi's holdouts, although they encountered fierce resistance from the embattled president's loyalists and armed city residents. They began pressing into the city center on 29 March 2015 despite coalition air strikes and shelling from Egyptian Navy warships offshore.\nOn 2 April 2015, the compound that has been used as a temporary presidential palace was taken by the Houthis, and fighting moved into the central Crater and Al Mualla districts.\nA small contingent of foreign troops was reportedly deployed in Aden by early May, fighting alongside anti-Houthi militiamen in the city. Saudi Arabia denied the presence of ground troops, while Hadi's government claimed the troops were Yemeni special forces who had received training in the Persian Gulf and were redeployed to fight in Aden.\nin Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, 7 May 2015]]\nOn 21 July 2015, forces loyal to Hadi recaptured Aden with support from Saudi Arabia in Operation Golden Arrow after months of fighting. This allowed supplies to finally reach the port city giving civilians desperately needed aid.\nOn 22 July 2015, a Saudi military plane landed in Aden international airport filled with relief aid. Also, a UN ship docked in Aden carrying much-needed relief supplies, the first UN vessel to reach the city in four months. Another ship sent by the UAE also delivered medical aid. On 21 July 2015, a UAE technical team had arrived to repair the tower and passenger terminal at Aden international airport, heavily damaged in clashes. On 24 July 2015, a military plane from the UAE arrived filled with relief aid.\nOn 4 August 2015, Houthi forces were pushed back from the Al-Anad airbase, by Pro-Hadi forces.\nOn 17 October 2015, Saudi Arabia confirmed the arrival of Sudanese troops into Aden for the purpose of bolstering the Saudi-led coalition.\nOther campaigns\nAbyan Governorate\nThe Houthis racked up a series of victories in the Abyan Governorate east of Aden in the days following their entrance into Hadi's provisional capital, taking control of Shuqrah and Zinjibar on the coast and winning the allegiance of a local army brigade, but they also encountered resistance from both pro-Hadi army brigadiers and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula militants. Zinjibar and Jaar were recaptured by AQAP on 2 December 2015.\nHadhramaut Governorate\nAl-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula took control of Mukalla in the eastern Hadhramaut Governorate on 2 April 2015, driving out soldiers defending the city with mortar fire and springing some 300 inmates from prison, including a local al-Qaeda leader.\nLocal tribal fighters aligned with Hadi surrounded and entered Mukalla on 4 April 2015, retaking parts of the city and clashing with both al-Qaeda militants and army troops. Still, the militants remained in control of about half of the town. In addition, al-Qaeda fighters captured a border post with Saudi Arabia in an attack that killed two soldiers.\nOn 13 April 2015, Southern militia said they took control of the army base loyal to the Houthis near Balhaf. Mukalla city was recaptured from AQAP in late April 2016, after UAE and Hadi loyalists troops entered the city, killing some 800 AQAP fighters.\nOn 12 June 2015, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula leader Nasir al-Wuhayshi was killed in a US drone strike in Mukalla.\nLahij Governorate\nAlthough the Houthis took control of Lahij on the road to Aden, resistance continued in the Lahij Governorate. Ambushes and bombings struck Houthi supply lines to the Aden front, with a land mine killing a reported 25 Houthi fighters on their way to Aden on 28 March 2015.\nShabwah Governorate\nFighting also centered on the Shabwa Province, in the oil-rich Usaylan region, where Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and Ansar al-Sharia hold sway. On 29 March 2015, 38 were killed in fighting between the Houthis and Sunni tribesmen. Tribal sources confirmed the death toll, and claimed only 8 of them were from their side, with the other 30 either Houthis or their allies from the Yemeni military.\nOn 9 April 2015, the Houthis and their allies seized the provincial capital of Ataq. The takeover was facilitated by local tribal chiefs and security officials.

The attacks came despite the UN Secretary-General António Guterres and other organizations asking to maintain ceasefire during the COVID-19 pandemic. In their statement, a group of regional experts also said that all political prisoners should be released from prisons to tackle the appalling health care system, and mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic from spreading in Yemen.\nApril\n* On 5 April, at least 5 women were killed and 28 people injured when shelling hit the woman's section of Taiz's main prison. The shelling came from the part of the divided city controlled by the Houthis. The attack was condemned by the High Commissioner of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR) Michelle Bachelet, who called it a breach of international humanitarian law.\n* After the United Nations urged both sides to pursue peace talks in order to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in Yemen, Saudi-led coalition spokesman Turki Al-Maliki announced a unilateral ceasefire beginning 9 April at noon, to support efforts to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic.\n* However, despite pledging to a ceasefire in Yemen, the Saudi-led coalition carried out dozens of airstrikes in the span of a week.

An STC official, Nabil al-Hanachi stated that they managed to \"stop the attack and kill many of them\". The renewed fight between the two sides brought additional risks to the already vague Riyadh Agreement.\n* On 19 May, the President of STC Aidarus al-Zoubaidi visited Riyadh for two days, in order to discuss the prolonged impasse with the Hadi government. However, the talks were extended to the eighth day on 26 May, where the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was facing a challenge to resolve the conflict between the Hadi government it sponsors and the separatists backed by the UAE. The conflict between the two sides reflected rising differences within the Saudi-led coalition, giving rise to a \"war within a war\" that the two are fighting against the Houthi rebels.\nJune\n* On 15 June, an airstrike from the Saudi-led coalition on a vehicle carrying civilians killed 13, including four children.\n* On 14 June, the STC confiscated billions of Yemeni riyals en route to the central bank in the port city Aden.\n* On 21 June, the STC seized full control of Socotra, deposing governor Ramzi Mahroos, who denounced the action as a coup.\n* On 30 June, Houthis forces made further advances on the North of Badya and the South of Marib, seizing 400&nbsp;km of terrain and inflicting 250 killed, wounded and captured Pro-Hadi Government forces.\nJuly\n* On 2 July, coalition fighter jets launched scores of airstrikes on several Yemeni provinces.

Both parties also agreed to visitation rights in detention facilities and likely more prisoner swaps in the near future. Hans Grundberg, the UN’s special envoy for Yemen said that things are finally moving \"in the right direction\" toward a resolution of the conflict.  The possible end to a devastating war in the region comes after the recent Saudi-Iranian rapprochement mediated by China a week earlier.\nApril\nOn 14 April, former chief of staff Mahmoud al-Subaihi and Hadi's brother and intelligence chief Nasser were released by the Houthis as part of a prisoner swap with the Yemeni government.\nOn 19 April, at least 85 people were killed and 322 people injured in a stampede in Sanaa, Yemen.\nNegotiations to end the civil war that includes all major combatants begin in April 2023 after Iran and Saudi Arabia resume diplomatic relations.\nSeptember\nOn 14 September a Houthi delegation visited Riyadh for what could be the final round of peace talks.\nOctober\nThe Ayatollah succeeded in persuading the (religious) leader of the Houthis, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, to launch at least one ballistic missile against Israel on Halloween either of Iranian design or some knock-off & it was intercepted (not in the atmosphere) by an Arrow 2. Houthi spokesperson Brigadier General Yahya Saree spokesman officially declared war against Israel, claiming that Ansar Allah had actually launched an entire wave of ballistic missiles & drones for Halloween.\nNovember\nOn 1 November 2023, an Israeli Air Force F-35 shot down a Quds cruise missile. On 9 November 2023, the Houthis launched a ballistic missile, possibly a Hatem, against the southern Israeli city of Eilat & for a 2nd time, it was intercepted in space. 2nd generation 2000 km range is suspected. However, Arrow 3s have a very high interception success rate. But the Houthis remain undeterred & launch Wa'aed drones at will against Israel using a flight path over the Red Sea.\nDecember\n* On 11 December, Shia religious leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi hit the Norwegian MT Strinda oil tanker while it was transiting a load of palm oil to Naples.

For Red Sea maritime security to and from the Suez Canal, Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) in Manama, Bahrain has a 39-nation naval partnership (which includes Norway &) which established (its) Combined Task Force 153 on 17 April 2022. (CDR Fridtjof is CMF's Norwegian Representative.) The International Maritime Security Construct was established on 16 September 2019 & also guards the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait via Coalition Task Force (Operation) Sentinel. Norwegian State Secretary for Foreign Affairs Eivind Vad Petersson (who reports to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Norway) said the attack will cause \"great financial and material losses\".\n* On 15 December, a Houthi drone hit the German-based shipper Hapag-Lloyd's container ship MV Al Jasrah, causing a fire which was eventually extinguished & a Houthi ballistic missile hit, setting the Swiss-owned container ship MSC Palatium III ablaze. Because NATO's rulers authorized neither CTF 153 nor Operation Sentinel to deter the Houthis, the world's second largest shipping company, Maersk, stopped shipping containers through the Red Sea & the Suez Canal. Hapag-Lloyd paused all shipments through the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait through the weekend. 10% of all oil traded at sea passes through it & a staggering number of dollars of cargo per year.\n* 16 December, HMS Diamond shot down a Wa'aed drone, forcing the Houthis to switch tactics to relying on their various types of ballistic missiles. USS Carney shot down 14 drones. Two more major shipping firms, Italian-Swiss based MSC and France's CMA CGM, suspended ship passage through the Bab-el-Mandeb Straight, costing the Suez (a combined) more than half its traffic. 40% of all exports & imports that are traded at sea transit through the strait. (Notably, Chinese COSTCO was still operating.)\n2024\nMay\nOn 26 May 2024, The Houthis, with the help of the International Committee of the Red Cross, released more than 100 detainees in Sanaa, as part of a \"unilateral humanitarian initiative\" aimed at pardoning the prisoners and returning them to their families.\n2025\nMarch\nOn 15 March 2025, The US began striking Houthi positions in Yemen.\nSee also\n* Outline of the Yemeni crisis, revolution, and civil war (2011–present)\n* Timeline of the Yemeni crisis (2011–present)\n* MV Sea Isle City\nReferences"
