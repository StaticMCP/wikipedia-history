It is the city's de facto downtown, central business district and administrative center, hosting the seat of the Ho Chi Minh City Hall. Saigon ward was established in 2025 by merging the entire Bến Nghé ward with parts of Nguyễn Thái Bình and Đa Kao wards from the former District 1, which was dissolved following Vietnam's 2025 administrative reforms.\nPrior to the ward's establishment, Saigon was the historic and colloquial name for Ho Chi Minh City's central area, roughly corresponding to the former District 1. It was also the official name for the capital city of the State of Vietnam (as Đô thành Sài Gòn-Chợ Lớn), the Republic of Vietnam (as Đô thành Sài Gòn), and the Republic of South Vietnam (as Thành phố Sài Gòn-Gia Định).\nGeography\nWard of is located in the central core of Ho Chi Minh City, bordering:\n* Bến Thành Ward (south, separated by Nam Kỳ Khởi Nghĩa St.);\n* Tân Định Ward (west, separated by Nguyễn Đình Chiểu St.);\n* Xuân Hoà Ward (southwest, separated by streets of Hai Bà Trưng and Nguyễn Thị Minh Khai);\n* Gia Định Ward (northwest, separated by Thị Nghè Canal);\n* Thạnh Mỹ Tây Ward (north, separated by Thị Nghè Canal);\n* Xóm Chiếu Ward (southeast, separated by Bến Nghé Canal);\n* An Khánh Ward (east, with the boundary being the Saigon River).\nAccording to Official Dispatch No. 2896/BNV-CQDP dated May 27, 2025, of the Ministry of Home Affairs, following administrative reorganization, the newly established Saigon Ward will have an area of 3.04 km², a population of 47,022 people (2024), and a population density of 15,468 people/km² (2024). Saigon Ward was established according to the provisions of Article 6 of Resolution No. 76/2025/UBTVQH15 dated April 14, 2025, of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly.\nHistory\nEtymology\nThe first known human habitation in the area was either a Cham settlement called Baigaur, or a Cambodian city named Prey Nokor, which was a small fishing village. Over time, under the control of the Vietnamese, it was officially renamed Gia Định () in 1698, a name that was retained until the time of the French conquest in the 1860s, when it adopted the name , francized as , although the city was still indicated as  on Vietnamese maps written in chữ Hán until at least 1891.\nHo Chi Minh City has a history of administrative management of more than 300 years, since 1698 when Lord Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh established Gia Định Province. Over that time, the place has had many different names used to refer to the entire land or a part of the area, such as Saigon, Chợ Lớn, Gia Định, Bến Nghé, Phiên An, Phan Yên. Of which, Saigon is the most popular name in administrative management as well as community and cultural life.\nIn 1976, the National Assembly officially renamed Saigon–Gia Định (established from the merge of City of Saigon and Province of Gia Định) as Ho Chi Minh City. Prior to the establishment of Saigon Ward in 2025, the name Saigon was no longer used in an official capacity, but is still widely used as a common name for the city. The area of Saigon ward then was Bến Nghé ward (except the now-extension part in Đa Kao).\nEstablishment\nDuring Vietnam's 2025 administrative reorganization at the commune level, the government of Ho Chi Minh City has advocated naming new wards and communes with letters instead of numbers, with considerations from the history of the land, familiarity, and cultural values. This policy is widely supported by the people.\nTo implement the above policy, District 1 proposed to name its central ward Saigon for the following reasons:\n* \"As the historical, political, economic, and cultural center of Ho Chi Minh City, the ward is home to many symbolic architectural works such as the Ho Chi Minh City Hall, Saigon Opera House, Ho Chi Minh City Museum, etc.\n* It is home to many important historical sites, with structures such as Ba Son Shipyard (associated with the revolutionary activities of Ho Chi Minh and the workers' movement in the early 20th century) and the U.S. Consulate General (U.S. Embassy before 1975).\n* More than 3/4 of the ward's perimeter is bordered by rivers and canals, from the Thị Nghè canal and Bến Nghé canal to the Saigon River, which affirms the characteristic river element in the history and culture of this land.\n* It is a bustling commercial and financial center, with significant streets such as Nguyễn Huệ, Đồng Khởi, Lê Lợi, Hàm Nghi, Hai Bà Trưng, etc.\n* Showing respect for historical values to help preserve local identity in the context of rapid urbanization.\n* The name Saigon is easily recognizable and familiar to both residents and international visitors, convenient for promoting the image, promoting the development of tourism, services, and urban economy.\n* Saigon is not only a place name, but also a symbol of pride, familiar memories, and responsibility to continue the traditional values of a young city, but rich in heritage that knows how to cherish its roots in the city's development journey.\"\nOn June 16, 2025, the Standing Committee of the National Assembly issued Resolution No. 1685/NQ-UBTVQH15 on the arrangement of commune-level administrative units of Ho Chi Minh City in 2025. Accordingly, the entire Bến Nghé ward and parts of Đa Kao ward (quarter 4, 5, 6, 8, 10) and Nguyễn Thái Bình ward (quarter 1) will be reorganized into a new ward called Saigon Ward (Clause 1, Article 1).\nDivision\nSaigon ward is divided into 14 quarters, including Ba Son Quarter and numbered quarters from 1 to 13, with 1 to 8 is part of former Bến Nghé ward, 9 is part of former Nguyễn Thái Bình ward and 10 to 13 is part of former Đa Kao.\nEducation\nSchool\n* April 30 Kindergarten\n* Hoa Lư Kindergaten\n* Sapa Private Kindergarten\n* Hòa Bình Primary School, Branch 2 of the school on Tôn Thất Đạm Street before school year of 1998–1999 was Bến Nghé Primary School\n* Vinschool Golden River Private School at Vinhomes Golden River development (Ba Son)\n* Asian International School, Primary School at 2Bis Thái Văn Lung\n* Võ Trường Toản Secondary School\n* Trưng Vương High School\n* Trần Đại Nghĩa High School for the Gifted\nHigher educations\n* Ho Chi Minh City University of Social Sciences and Humanities, Saigon Campus (of VNU-HCM)\n* Ho Chi Minh City Medicine and Pharmacy University, School of Pharmacy\n* Ho Chi Minh University of Banking\n* Saigon University, Campus 2\n* Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology, Ho Chi Minh City\n* Institute of Social Sciences in Ho Chi Minh City\n* Institute of Education Management of Ho Chi Minh City\n* Cao Thắng Technical College\nLibraries\nSome notable libraries located in the ward:\n* American Center Ho Chi Minh City – Library of Consulate General of the United States, Ho Chi Minh City at Level 8, Diamond Plaza, 34 Lê Duẩn Boulevard\n* The IDECAF Media Library at 31 Thái Văn Lung Street\n* Nguyễn An Ninh Digital Library on Nguyễn Văn Bình Street, a digital version of the original same name physics library and specialized for topics of Southern Vietnam\n* Library of Social Sciences at Insitiute of Social Sciences in Ho Chi Minh City, 34 Lý Tự Trọng\nConsulates\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+List of Consulate General in Sài Gòn Ward\n!Nation\n!Address\n|-\n|\n|25 Lê Duẩn Boulevard\n|-\n|\n|29 Lê Duẩn Boulevard\n|-\n|\n|Level 4, Deutsches Haus, 33 Lê Duẩn Boulevard\n|-\n|\n|No.4 Lê Duẩn Boulevard\n|-\n|\n|No.6 Lê Duẩn Blvd & 27 Nguyễn Thị Minh Khai St.\n|-\n|\n|Somerset Chancellor Court Ho Chi Minh City, 21 Nguyễn Thị Minh Khai Street\n|-\n|\n|Room 5, Level 11, Saigon Centre Tower 2, 67 Lê Lợi Boulevard\n|-\n|\n|No.7 Lê Thánh Tôn Street\n|-\n|\n|Level 20, Vincom Center Đồng Khởi, 47 Lý Tự Trọng Street\n|-\n|\n|Suite 804, Level 8, The Metropolitan, 235 Đồng Khởi Street\n|-\n|\n|Suite 1002, Level 10, The Metropolitan, 235 Đồng Khởi Street\n|-\n|\n|93 Pasteur Street\n|-\n|\n|Room 501, Sailing Tower, 111A Pasteur Street\n|-\n|\n|Level 10, President Place Building, 93 Nguyễn Du\n|-\n|\n|Level 37, Bitexco Financial Tower, No.2 Hải Triều Street\n|-\n|\n|18 Phùng Khắc Khoan Street (formerly in Đa Kao)\n|-\n|\n|22 Phùng Khắc Khoan Street (formerly in Đa Kao)\n|}\nReferences\nFurther reading\nSee also\n* Ho Chi Minh City\n* District 1"
