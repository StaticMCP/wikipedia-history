It also known as the school mackerel, doggie mackerel, or shiny mackerel.\nDescription\nThe Queensland School Mackerel resembles other Spanish mackerels, with an elongated and highly compressed body, with a deeply forked tail. Like other Scrombridaes, it lacks a swim bladder. The coloration of the first is a blue-ish green, with the stomach being lighter in color. The front of the first dorsal fin, as well as the very end of it, is jet black. The anal fin and finlets are white. It displays a spotted pattern, with large black to grey colored blotches either throughout the body or only in small patches. After the fish is caught, these spots tend to become faint.\nThese fish have been recorded at up to  in length, and weighing up to , although they are commonly . Females grow larger but slower than males, and they can live up to 10 years,.\nThe Queensland school mackerel can be distinguished from the Australian spotted mackerel (Scomberomorus munroi) as the spots are considerably larger, as well as the darker color on the dorsal.\nRange\nQueensland mackerel are found in tropical waters of the Western Pacific, largely confined to inshore coastal waters of southern Papua New Guinea and northern and eastern Australia, from Shark Bay and Onslow, Western Australia to Sydney, New South Wales.\nBiology and ecology\nQueensland school mackerel live an epipelagic lifestyle over continental shelves. They commonly occur in waters down to , usually to , in depth. They prefer inshore waters, within  of a reef or rocky area. They can also be found in bays and estuaries while following baitfish, especially during austral spring and winter . Queensland mackerel have been known to school with other species of Spanish mackerel, notably narrow-barred Spanish mackerel (S. commerson).\nFemales mature between  while males mature between  fork length. Spawning occurs between October and January, by releasing pelagic eggs.\nThe diet of this species includes clupeoids (herring, menhaden, etc) and anchovies. Larval fish eat other larval fish and planktonic invertebrates.\nRelation to humans\nThis species is popular in recreational fishing using trolling methods and is prized as table fare. It is caught in commercial fisheries using gillnets, often while targeting other species of Spanish mackerel. They are commonly sold fresh in markets as fish steaks, and may be used in nigiri sushi. As a predator in coral reef ecosystems, there is a possibility of ciguatera poisoning.\nSee also\n* Mackerel as food\nReferences\n*"
