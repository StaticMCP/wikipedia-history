The museum is dedicated to the history of the Peenemünde Army Research Centre and the Luftwaffe test site of \"Peenemünde-West\", especially the rockets and missiles developed there between 1936 and 1945. Since January 2007 the information centre has become an anchor point on the European Route of Industrial Heritage (ERIH), a Europe-wide network of industrial monuments, and a part of the ERIH themed routes for Energy and Transport & Communication.\nIn 2008 the museum had around 222,000 visitors including many school classes. Around €6.5 M were invested in the museum's renovation and expansion; a further investment of €3.9 M is planned. In 2002 the HTM was given the Coventry Cross of Nails and in 2013 the European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Award.\nExhibition\nThe main purpose of the exhibition in the power station is to be a memorial site where visitors can learn from exhibits, documents and films about the fateful pact made by the rocket engineers around Wernher von Braun with former powers in order to develop the aerospace industry.\nIn the mid-1960s, building on his technical experience from Peenemünde, Wernher von Braun led the design team which developed the Saturn V rocket for NASA that was used to fly to the moon. The role of the former rocket engineer in Peenemünde, however, was to develop weapons of war. Films show visitors how V-1 flying bombs worked.\nThese experiences formed the basis for the development of nuclear missiles by the Allies after the war. According to documents in the exhibition even Peenemünde experts took part, including in Great Britain and France, where they helped to develop the Force de Frappe.\nAs part of a detailed chronicle about the test site, the living and working conditions of the forced labourers and prisoners of war in Peenemünde is illustrated. In addition, there is extensive information on concentration camp prisoners, who assembled the V1-flying bombs in Bavaria and Austria under inhuman conditions.\nThere is a chapel near the site which commemorates all the victims.\nOpen air displays\nAmongst the showpieces on display in the open-air part of the site are a replica V-1 flying bomb (Fieseler Fi 103) and the A4 rocket.\nExhibits in the Peenemünde Historical Technical Museum include:\nFile:Peenem Museum V1 Modell.jpg|The V-1 flying bomb\nFile:2020 07 23 V1 on ramp with power station behind.jpg|V1 rocket on launch ramp with power station behind, Peenemünde 23 07 2020\nFile:Peenemünde 2001 -NEWA 5W 57- by-RaBoe 01.jpg|Anti-aircraft missiles\nFile:Peenemünder Triebwagen.JPG|Former Peenemünde railbus in the open air site\nFile:MiG-23ML 332.jpg|MiG-23ML of JG-9 squadron, displayed since 30 April 2010 at the Rechline Aerotechnology Museum.\nFile:Launching pad for V1.JPG|Launching pad for V1\nFile:Peenemünde 2001 -Hans Beimler (ship, 1986)- by-RaBoe 01.jpg|The Hans Beimler, a former Soviet-built, missile corvette of the Tarantul class operated by the Volksmarine\nFile:Fusée V2.jpg|V-2 rocket replica\nFile:2020 07 23 Peenemünde harbour (for importing coal).jpg|Peenemünde harbour (for importing coal) from roof of power station, on 23 07 2020\nInformation boards on the Peenemünder Haken\nThere is a large number of information boards at historic locations, connected with the Army Research Centre and Luftwaffe test site, spread over the whole Peenemünder Haken (\"Peenemünde Hook\") and managed by the HTI. The sites include Oxygen Factory II (Sauerstoffwerk II), two former forced labour camps and a halt on the old Peenemünde industrial railway. The displayed objects and terrain are generally freely accessible and often inconspicuous. Several were laid out with the help of youth volunteers.\nSee also\n* Test Stand VII, the principal V-2 launch test facility\nReferences\nLiterature\n*Bernd Kuhlmann: Peenemünde - Das Raketenzentrum und seine Werkbahn, GVE-Verlag, Berlin, 2.
