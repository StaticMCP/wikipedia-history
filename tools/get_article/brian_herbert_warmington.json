H. Warmington. After he went to the Mill Hill School, he studied Classics and History at Peterhouse, University of Cambridge. He interrupted his studies during World War II and was commissioned as an officer in the Intelligence Corps of the British Army. Warmington (together with some other students of Classics, like Alan Stripp) trained at a Japanese language course at Bedford (United Kingdom) from 31 August 1943 until 18 February 1944. Warmington was then ordered to Australia and worked as one of the first British code-breakers of Japanese coded radio transmissions. After the war, he returned to Cambridge with his Australian wife and earned a 1st class honours degree in Classics and History and won the Thirlwall Prize in 1951.\nAcademic career\nWarmington taught at Bristol University, where he ultimately earned the position of Reader in Ancient History. He was a scholar with wide-ranging interests. His first book was The North African provinces from Diocletian to the Vandal Conquest'' (published by Cambridge University Press in 1954). He became co-author of the 2nd edition of Henry Parker's A History of the Roman world from AD 138 to 337 (Methuen, 1958). Warmington's Carthage (R. Hale, 1960, later published by Penguin) on the famous early enemy of the Roman Republic was perhaps his most widely-read book, with multiple editions and re-printings, as well as translations in French, German, Italian, and Hungarian. His book Nero: Reality and Legend (Chatto & Windus, 1969) also saw a broad reading public. His Suetonius’ Nero (Bristol University Press, 1977) continues to serve as useful edition of the biography for upper-level Latin courses (and has also gone through several printings). In addition to his interest in the Roman Republic and Empire, he was also interested in the later Roman Empire. He published important articles on Ammianus Marcellinus and Constantine. He was also a generous and helpful guide to younger scholars (and is so thanked in the prefaces and forwards of many scholarly works).\nWarmington died on 27 April 2013.\nSelected publications\n* Brian H.
