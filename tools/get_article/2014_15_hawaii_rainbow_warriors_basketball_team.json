The Rainbow Warriors, led by interim head coach Benjy Taylor, played their home games at the Stan Sheriff Center as members of the Big West Conference. On October 28, 2014, Gib Arnold was removed as coach at Hawaii following an NCAA investigation. Assistant Benjy Taylor was named interim head coach. Despite a 22 win season and being the runner up in their conference tournament, the Warriors didn't play in a postseason tournament. Taylor was not retained after the season.\nRoster\n)\n|asst_coach=\n* Brad Autry ()\n* Senque Carey ()\n* Brandon Loyd ()\n* Jamie Smith () - Director of Basketball Operations\n* Nick Jones () - Graduate Manager\n|roster_url=http://hawaiiathletics.com/roster.aspx?path=mbball&\n|accessdate=\n}}\nSchedule and results\nSource: [http://hawaiiathletics.com/schedule.aspx?path=mbball&]\n|-\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#004231; color:white;\"| Exhibition\ni Pacific]]\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium = Stan Sheriff Center\n| site_cityst  = Honolulu\n| gamename     =\n| tv           =\n| score        = 62–55\n| attend       = 5,154\n| record       =\n}}\n|-\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#004231; color:white;\"| Non-conference games\n|-\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#004231; color:white;\"| Conference games\n|-\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#004231; color:white;\"| Big West tournament\nReferences"
