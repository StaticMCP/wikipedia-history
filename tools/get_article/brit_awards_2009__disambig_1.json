The awards ceremony was held at Earls Court in London, and was broadcast live on ITV on 18 February at 8pm (GMT). Duffy became the first female artist to ever win three awards in the same year, and only Blur, in 1995, have ever won more awards at a single ceremony. The show was advertised as live by ITV but the broadcast included several audio deletions which means the show was shown on a time delay system. The 2009 Brit Awards ceremony was watched by 5.49 million people and was the 32nd most watched programme on TV on the week ending 22 February.\nHosts\nKylie Minogue, Mathew Horne and James Corden hosted the 2009 edition of the Brit Awards, with Fearne Cotton presenting backstage.  Fearne also hosted the launch party for ITV2 in January.\nJohnny Vegas introduced and closed the event, as well as reading out the nominees in a pre-recorded voiceover. Emma B provided the live voiceovers as the artists came to the stage.\nRufus Hound, Sara Cox, Melanie Blatt and Nicole Appleton presented the Red Carpet and Encore events on ITV2.\nAlesha Dixon presented a backstage programme, screened on ITV two days after the ceremony.\nPerformances\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Performer(s)\n!Song\n!UK Singles Chart reaction(week ending 28 February 2009)\n!UK Albums Chart reaction(week ending 28 February 2009)\n|-\n| U2\n| \"Get on Your Boots\"\n| 12 (debut)\n| U218 Singles – 48 (+6)\n|-\n| Girls Aloud\n| \"The Promise\"\n| 39 (+19)\n| Out of Control – 37 (+5)\n|-\n| Coldplay\n| \"Viva la Vida\"\n| 27 (+18)\n| Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends – 15 (+16)\n|-\n| Duffy\n| \"Warwick Avenue\"\n| 71 (re-entry)\n| Rockferry – 4 (+15)\n|-\n| Take That\n| \"Greatest Day\"\n| 52 (+10)\n| The Circus – 16 (+1)Beautiful World – 52 (+4)Never Forget - The Ultimate Collection – 61 (-4)\n|-\n| Kings of Leon\n| \"Use Somebody\"\n| 3 (+9)\n| Only by the Night – 1 (+1)Because of the Times – 36 (+15)Aha Shake Heartbreak – 55 (+24)\n|-\n| The Ting TingsEstelle\n| \"Shut Up and Let Me Go\"\"American Boy\"\"That's Not My Name\"\n| 86 (re-entry)82 (+17)58 (+33)\n| We Started Nothing – 8 (+25)\n|-\n| Pet Shop BoysLady GagaBrandon Flowers\n| \"Suburbia\"\"Love etc.\"\"Left to My Own Devices\"\"Always on My Mind\"\"Go West\"\"Opportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money)”\"What Have I Done to Deserve This?\"\"Domino Dancing\"\"I'm With Stupid\"\"Being Boring\"\"It's a Sin\"\"All Over the World\"\"West End Girls\"\n| N/A\n| PopArt: The Hits – 19 (re-entry)\n|}\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n!

The performance saw the band members, including Cheryl and Nicola Roberts appear as though they were naked, with their modesty being covered by pink feathers. This performance was nominated in the 2010 ceremony for the \"BRITs Hits 30 – Best Live Performance at the BRIT Awards\", alongside Oasis and The Who, which the Spice Girls eventually went on to win. \"The Promise\" won best British single, their first ever BRIT award.\nMick Kluczynski\nTen days before the 2009 Brits, Mick Kluczynski, the production manager for the Brits since 1995 who assisted with the transition from the Fleetwood/Fox debacle to the scale of the current ceremony, died. Despite this setback the team he put in place ensured that everything went as planned, and the show was dedicated to his memory.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/2009 Brit Awards 2009 at Brits.co.uk]"
