Timur and Amir Hussein set out for Tashkent to meet this army. The battle ended inconclusively on the first day. On the second day, although Timur initially repelled the Mongols, Mongol General Semsheddin Beg gathered a Mongol unit and defeated Timur without him realizing what had happened, suffering heavy losses. Amir Hussein's condition was not good. He was defeated and retreated. Realizing that Timur was also defeated, he realized that he had lost the battle and fled towards Samarkand. The Mongols came and besieged Samarkand, Timur's capital, neither Amir Hussein nor Timur faced the Mongols. Samarkand was left to its fate, and by their own efforts they defeated the Mongols.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*"
