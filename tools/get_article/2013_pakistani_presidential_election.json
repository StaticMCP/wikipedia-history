Incumbent President Asif Ali Zardari’s term was scheduled to expire on 8 September 2013; and as such, Article 41 of the Constitution of Pakistan required the elections to be held no later than 8 August 2013. The Electoral College of Pakistan – a joint sitting of the Senate, National Assembly and Provincial Assemblies – were tasked with electing a new president to succeed President Zardari, who declined to seek a second term in office. After the Pakistan Peoples Party and its allies boycotted the presidential election, the two candidates were Mamnoon Hussain backed by the Pakistan Muslim League (N), and Wajihuddin Ahmed backed by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf. Agra-born Hussain was elected president by a majority securing 432 votes. The elections were the first time in Pakistani history where a civilian president was elected while an incumbent civilian President was still in office, completing a historic and democratic transition of power that began with the 2013 General Elections.\nBackground\nFollowing the 2013 general elections, it was expected that the new president would be chosen by the party that won a plurality and thus headed by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistan Muslim League (N). It is the first time in the country that a president elect has been chosen in the presence of a sitting president.\nSchedule\nThe Election Commission of Pakistan announced the initial election schedule on 17 July 2013. All nomination papers for candidates had to be submitted by 24 July, with scrutiny occurring on 26 July. Candidates then had an additional 3 days to withdraw their nomination, after which the official candidate list was announced. The elections were originally to take place via secret ballot on 6 August, and official results confirmed the next day. The elections would be presided by the Chief Justices of the Islamabad High Court and the 4 provincial High Courts.\nThe Supreme Court of Pakistan on 24 July, revised the date for the presidential election on the appeal of the ruling party, PML (N), asking the election commission to hold it on 30 July instead of 6 August. The court made the order as many of the lawmakers who will elect a replacement for President Asif Ali Zardari will be paying pilgrimages or offering special prayers on 6 August for the holy month of Ramadan, which ends a few days later, thus making it potentially difficult for some lawmakers to oblige with their religious duties along with the election. The petition was filed by the leader of the house in the Senate Raja Zafarul Haq on the same day.\nThe court ordered the Election Commission of Pakistan to change the election schedule on the appeal of the Federal government: nomination papers were filed on 24 July, their scrutiny was held on 26 July, the withdrawal of candidature up to 12 noon on 27 July and the final list of candidates was published at 5pm on 27 July. The polling was held on 30 July.\nCandidates\nThe PMLN nominated former Sindh Governor Mamnoon Hussain as its candidate; while the PPP nominated Senator Raza Rabbani (later boycotting); and PTI named Justice Wajihuddin Ahmed.\nMamnoon Hussain\nHussain was an Agra-born business man. He belonged to Sindh and owned a textile business in Karachi. He was born in Uttar Pradesh, India, in 1940. He started his political career in the 60s as a Muslim Leaguer. He was considered loyal to the former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.\nIn 1999, he was elected as the president of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industries (KCCI) and was soon selected by Nawaz Sharif to become governor of Sindh in June 1999, but lost the post after the then Army Chief Gen Pervez Musharraf overthrew the PMLN government in a 1999 Pakistani coup d'état in October 1999.\nWajiuddin Ahmed\nAhmed is a retired senior justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan of Pakistan, Human rights in Pakistan activist, Jurist Doctor and former professor of law at the Sindh Muslim Law College.\nPrior to be elevated as List of Justices of the Supreme Court of Pakistan of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, he briefly tenured as the Chief Justice of the Sindh High Court from 1998 until refusing take Legal Framework Order, 2002 in opposition to 1999 Pakistani coup d'état in 1999. He remained a strong critic of President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf, eventually taking up a leading role in Lawyer's movement in 2007 to oppose President Musharraf. Ultimately, he unsuccessfully ran for the presidential elections held in 2007. Since 2011, he has been active in Politics of Pakistanthrough PTI and became a forerunner on PTI platform for the presidential election.\nBoycotts\nOn 26 July, the PPP announced its decision to boycott the election. The ANP  and the BNP(A) also announced a boycott. They cited as their reason the Supreme Court of Pakistan's decision to change the election date from 6 August without consulting all parties.\nElectoral College Strength\nThe Electoral College of Pakistan is formed by a joint sitting of the six leading political bodies in Pakistan:\n* the Senate of Pakistan,\n* the National Assembly of Pakistan,\n* the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab,\n* the Provincial Assembly of Sindh,\n* the Provincial Assembly of Balochistan and\n* the Provincial Assembly of Khyber Paktunkhwa\nSo that each province has an equal vote, all provincial assemblies are given exactly 65 votes in the electoral college. This mean that the each member of the Punjab Assembly has 65/370 = 0.176 votes, each member of the Sindh Assembly has 65/168 = 0.387 votes, each member of the KPK Assembly has 65/124 = 0.524 votes and each member of the Balochistan Assembly has 65/65 = 1 vote.\nThe political composition of these bodies is as follows:\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n!
