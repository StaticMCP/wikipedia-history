While many stories involving interstellar travel feature planets already suited to habitation by humans and supporting their own indigenous life, some authors prefer to address the unlikeliness of such a concept by instead detailing the means by which humans have converted inhospitable worlds to ones capable of supporting life through artificial means.\nHistory of use\nAuthor Jack Williamson is credited with inventing and popularizing the term \"terraform\".  In July 1942, under the pseudonym Will Stewart, Williamson published a science fiction novella entitled \"Collision Orbit\" in Astounding Science-Fiction magazine.  The series was later published as two novels, Seetee Shock (1949) and Seetee Ship (1951).  American geographer Richard Cathcart successfully lobbied for formal recognition of the verb \"to terraform\", and it was first included in the fourth edition of the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary in 1993.\nThe concept of terraforming in popular culture predates Williamson's work; for example, the idea of turning the Moon into a habitable environment with atmosphere was already present in ''La Journée d'un Parisien au XXIe siècle (\"A Day of a Parisian in the 21st Century\", 1910) by . In fact, perhaps predating the concept of terraforming, is that of xenoforming – a process in which aliens change the Earth to suit their own needs, already suggested in the classic The War of the Worlds (1898) of H.G. Wells.\nLiterature\n{|  class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:6%;\"| Date\n! style=\"width:26%;\"| Title\n! style=\"width:18%;\"| Author\n! style=\"width:10%;\"| Planet/Moon\n! style=\"width:50%;\"| Notes\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 1898\n|The War of the Worlds''\n|H.

At the end of the film, a Genesis Device is detonated in the Mutara nebula resulting in the creation of a main sequence star and a habitable planet known as the Genesis Planet. Due to unstable \"proto-matter\" used in the terraforming process, the planet's evolution is accelerated, leading to the eventual premature destruction of the Genesis Planet.  The nine-disc Star Trek: The Motion Picture Collection contains an extra featurette on the \"real-science applications of terraforming\".\n|[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084726/] [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088170/]\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|1990\n|Total Recall\n|USA\n|Aliens have built a terraforming device on Mars, which when turned on, fills the atmosphere with oxygen, allowing humans to live on the surface.
