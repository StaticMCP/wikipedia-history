      "text": "# Resonance (T.M.Revolution song)\n\n\"Resonance\" is the twenty-second single from T.M.Revolution released on June 11, 2008 in Japan by Epic Records Japan. \"Resonance\" was released three years after T.M.Revolution's twenty-first single \"Vestige\". The single was released in three types of editions: CD-only, CD+DVD and CD+Blu-ray Disc; this is the first time in history for an artist to release a CD+Blu-ray Disc format. The first edition releases also came with a \"T.M.Revolution×Soul Eater Wide Cup\" sticker. The PV uses segments from all his past music videos edited to make it look like he's singing the lyrics to \"Resonance.\" \"Resonance\" is used as the opening theme to the anime Soul Eater, and the song \"Soul's Crossing\" on the single is used as the theme song to the video game based on the Soul Eater series, Soul Eater: Monotone Princess.\nTrack listing\n;CD\n# \"Resonance\"\n# \"Soul's Crossing\"\n;DVD/Blu-ray\n# \"Resonance\" -music clip-\nOricon Chart Positions\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Chart\n!align=\"center\"|Peakposition\n!align=\"center\"|Sales\n!align=\"center\"|Time inchart\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Oricon Weekly Singles\n|align=\"center\"|#4\n|align=\"\"|85,429\n|align=\"\"|18 weeks\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.sonymusicshop.jp/detail.asp?goods=ESCL-3075 CD-only information at Sony Music Shop]\n* [http://www.sonymusicshop.jp/detail.asp?goods=ESCL-3071 CD+DVD information at Sony Music Shop]\n* [http://www.sonymusicshop.jp/detail.asp?goods=ESCL-3073 CD+Blu-ray Disc information at Sony Music Shop]"
