Ingenuus' troops were defeated, as Gallienus' general Aureolus adequately used the advantage given by the mobility of an improved cavalry component of the army (a remarkable military innovation of Gallienus's), and the usurper was killed in battle, or took his own life to avoid capture.\n*Battle of Mursa Major (351 CE), between Constantius II and Magnentius"
