They are the longest-running unaffiliated contest open exclusively to independent presses. The IPPY Awards are open to authors and publishers worldwide who produce books written in English and intended for the North American market. According to the IPPY website, the awards 'reward those who exhibit the courage, innovation, and creativity to bring about change in the world of publishing.'\nHistory\nThe IPPY Awards were founded in 1996 by the Small Press publishing magazine. In 1998, Small Press became the Independent Publisher magazine, but continued to run the annual IPPY Awards. The IPPY's mission statement claims the awards are intended to 'recognise the deserving but often unsung titles published by independent authors and publishers, and bring them to the attention of booksellers, buyers, librarians, and book lovers around the world.' The IPPY criteria for an 'independent' publication mandates that all entries must be from publications that are either 1) independently owned and operated, 2) operated by a foundation or university, or 3) long-time independents that became incorporated but operate autonomously and publish fewer than 50 titles a year.\nThe first IPPY awards received 325 entries and awarded 90 gold, silver, and bronze medals.  In 2020, over 3,000 books were entered into the IPPYs, and 422 medals were awarded. In 25 years, IPPY entry categories have expanded from the 28 available in 1996 to more than a hundred options in 2020, including separate categories for specific genres, regions, and E-books.\nEntry and prize consideration\nIn 2020, the entry fee for the IPPY Awards was $85. Entry discounts for regional and E-book categories are often available. For the 25th anniversary IPPY Awards in 2021, a $25 discount was available for early submissions.\nEntries are judged based on first impression, design, originality, use of language, message delivery, and relevance. IPPY medalists receive certificates, medals, and book sticker seals. They also have the option to purchase additional merchandise, including plaques, electronic images, and additional medals and seals.\nAbout 2,400 publishers throughout the English-speaking world participate in the awards each year. In 2017 the contest drew over 5,000 entries, and medals were awarded to authors and publishers from 43 U.S. states, seven Canadian provinces and 15 countries. In 2020, medals were awarded to authors and publishers from all 50 U.S. states, 10 Canadian provinces, and 61 countries.\nOutstanding Book of the Year\nIn 2010, the IPPYs introduced additional \"Outstanding Book of the Year\" awards. Every IPPY submission is considered for an Outstanding Book award, regardless of category. The outstanding medalists are chosen for exemplifying 'daring spirit' with a book that is 'the most heartfelt, unique, outspoken and experimental among all entries.' In 2020, there were 11 Outstanding Books in eight categories:\n* Most Original Concept\n* Best Book Arts Craftsmanship\n* Most Outstanding Design\n* Most Likely to Save the Planet\n* Independent Spirit Award\n* Independent Voice Award\n* Freedom Fighter\n* Peacemaker\nNotable Outstanding Books of the Year include Peter Kalmus’ Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution, which was named 2018’s Most Likely to Save the Planet, as well as Warren Lehrer’s A Life in Books: The Rise and Fall of Bleu Mobley, 2014’s Most Original Concept.\nRecipients\nBooks by IPPY winners in 2016, 2017 and 2018 were published by university presses including Princeton, Stanford, Yale, Wisconsin, Iowa, and other major university presses. Among the fiction gold medalists was Elena Ferrante's The Story of the Lost Child, originally published in Italy and issued in English by Europa.\nPrevious winners in fiction categories include the small presses like Milkweed, Coffee House, Graywolf, The Other Press, McPherson, Europa, and McSweeney's. IPPY Gold Medal winner Lord of Misrule also won the National Book Award and The Patience Stone also won France's Prix Goncourt for its French edition. David Eggers won a 2003 Outstanding Book of the Year for A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius. Margaret Atwood won in 2003 for Negotiating with the Dead: A Writer on Writing. Juan Felipe Herrera, the United States Poet Laureate, won an IPPY gold medal in 2005 for Featherless (Desplumado). Randal Graham won in 2018 the IPPY gold medal in fantasy fiction for Beforelife. David Pietrusza won the 2023 IPPY Gold Medal for US History.\nCategories and regions\nGeneral Categories:\n# Fine Art\n# Performing Arts (Music/Dance/Cinema/Theatre)\n# Photography\n# Architecture\n# Coffee Table Books\n# Popular Fiction\n# Literary Fiction\n# Short Story Fiction\n# Poetry - Standard\n# Poetry - Specialty\n# Anthologies\n# Juvenile Fiction\n# Young Adult Fiction\n# Fantasy\n# Science Fiction\n# LGBT+ Fiction\n# Erotica\n# Historical Fiction\n# Military/Wartime Fiction\n# Horror\n# Multicultural Fiction\n# Multicultural Fiction – Juv-Young Adult\n# Mystery/Cozy/Noir\n# Suspense/Thriller\n# Religious Fiction\n# Romance\n# Urban Fiction\n# Visionary / New Age Fiction\n# True Crime\n# Graphic Novel/Drawn Book\n# Humor\n# Children's Picture Books (7 & Under)\n# Children's Picture Books (All ages)\n# Children's Interactive\n# Juvenile-Young Adult Non-Fiction\n# Multicultural N-F Juv-Young Adult\n# Multicultural Non-Fiction Adult\n# Essay\n# Creative Non-Fiction\n# Autobiography/Memoir I (Celebrity/Political/Romance)\n# Autobiography/Memoir II (Coming of Age/Family Legacy/Travel)\n# Autobiography/Memoir III (Personal Struggle/Health Issues)\n# Biography\n# Aging/Death & Dying\n# Animals/Pets\n# Business/Career/Sales\n# Cookbooks – General\n# Cookbooks – Specialty\n# Current Events I (Political/Economic/Foreign Affairs)\n# Current Events II (Social Issues/Humanitarian)\n# Education I (Workbook/Resource)\n# Education II (Commentary/Theory)\n# Nature\n# Environment/Ecology\n# Finance/Investment/Economics\n# LGBT+ Non-Fiction\n# Gift/Specialty/Journal\n# Holiday\n# Health/Medicine/Nutrition\n# History (U.S.)\n# History (World)\n# Home/Garden/Crafts\n# Inspirational/Spiritual\n# New Age/Mind-Body-Spirit\n# Parenting\n# Popular Culture\n# Psychology/Mental Health\n# Sports/Fitness/Recreation\n# Reference\n# Religion (Eastern/Western)\n# Science\n# Self Help\n# Sexuality/Relationships\n# Transportation (Auto/Aviation/Railroad, etc.)\n# Travel – Essay\n# Travel – Guidebook\n# Women's Issues\n# Writing/Publishing\n# Book/Author/Publisher Website\n# Cover Design – Fiction\n# Cover Design – Non-Fiction\n# Cover Design – Non-Fiction Oversize\n# Best First Book – Fiction\n# Best First Book – Non-Fiction\n# Book Series - Fiction\n# Book Series - Non-Fiction (note: Book Series category submissions require at least two volumes, with one volume's copyright/release date falling within the 2018–2020 time frame)\n# Audiobook - Fiction\n# Audiobook - Non-Fiction\nE-Book Categories\n# Best Adult Fiction E-Book\n# Best Romance/Erotica E-Book\n# Best Mystery/Thriller E-Book\n# Best Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Horror E-Book\n# Best Adult Non-Fiction Personal E-Book\n# Best Adult Non-Fiction Informational E-Book\n# Best Juvenile/Young Adult Fiction E-Book\n# Best Children's Illustrated E-Book\n# Best Regional E-Book – Fiction\n# Best Regional E-Book – Non-Fiction\n# Best E-Book Design\nRegional Categories (Awards for \"Best Fiction\" and \"Best Non-Fiction\" in each region)\n# Northeast (ME, VT, NH, MA, RI, CT, NY)\n# Mid- Atlantic (PA, WV, VA, DE, MD, DC, NJ)\n# Southeast (KY, NC, SC, GA, FL, AL)\n# South (MS, LA, AR, TX, TN)\n# Great Lakes (OH, MI, IN, IL, WI)\n# Midwest (MN, IA, MO, OK, KS, NE, SD, ND)\n# West-Mountain (MT, WY, UT, CO, NM, AZ, ID, NV)\n# West-Pacific (CA, OR, WA, HI, AK)\n# Canada-East (ON, QB, NF, NB, NS, PE, Nunavut)\n# Canada-West (BC, AB, SK, MB, NW Territories, Yukon)\n# Australia/New Zealand/Pacific Rim\n# Europe\nCriticism\nThe IPPY Awards were criticized by Writer Beware, an advocacy website sponsored by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA), which stated that it was one of several profiteer awards run by the Jenkins Group and that 'even among profiteers, however, Jenkins is unusual in the amount of extra merchandise it hawks to winners.' The site classified profiteer awards as awards that are aimed at \"making money for the sponsor. Such awards aren't really about honouring writers at all.\"\nReferences"
