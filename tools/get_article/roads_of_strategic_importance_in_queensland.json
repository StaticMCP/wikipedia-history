The purposes of this document are to:\n* List the strategic corridors that are wholly or partly in Queensland, with at least one project in Queensland.\n* List all ROSI projects in Queensland, and provide a link to each project description.\n* List all roads and associated structures targeted by ROSI projects in Queensland.\n* Record the copying of project details to associated Wikipedia articles.\n* Indicate projects targeted for \"early works\" by the Queensland Government.\n__FORCETOC__\nData columns\nThe list is in the form of a table with the following date columns:\n* Corridor name\n* Project short name\n* Road name\n* Copied\n* Notes\nCorridor name\nCorridor names from the source document (reference 1) are listed alphabetically without any division between Northern and Southern Australia corridors. A corridor name, \"Non-corridor projects\", is below the corridor names.\nProject short name\nWhere a project short name differs from the project name in the source document it has been derived as follows:\n* A road name, if included, has been removed.\n* The remaining text has been rearranged.\nFor example \"Flinders Highway (Townsville - Charters Towers) Wide Centre Line Treatment\" is changed to \"Wide centre line treatment Townsville-Charters Towers\".\nThese project short names are listed alphabetically within each corridor, so there is no relation to the sequence of project names in the source document.\nRoad name\nWhere a road name is in the project name or the project description it has been included in this column. Where there are multiple names only one has been listed in this column. The alphabetic index for the table is based on the road name.\nCopied\nIf used by participating editors this column indicates that the details of a project have been copied to a related Wikipedia article.\nNotes\nIn addition to miscellaneous notes this column indicates those projects targeted for \"early works\" by the Queensland Government, as shown in reference 2.\nTable\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Corridor name\n!Project short name\n!Road name\n!Copied\n!Notes\n!class=unsortable |\n|-\n|Cairns to NT border\n|Corridor upgrade Croydon–Mt Garnet\n|Gulf Developmental Road\n|Yes\n|Early works -
