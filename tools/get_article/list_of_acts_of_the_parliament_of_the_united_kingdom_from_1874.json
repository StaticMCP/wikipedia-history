For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".\nSome of these acts have a short title. Some of these acts have never had a short title.  Some of these acts have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n37 & 38 Vict.\nThe first session of the 21st Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 5 March 1874 until 7 August 1874.\nPublic general acts\nor the Supply Act 1874|public|1|28-03-1874|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to apply the sum of one million four hundred and twenty-two thousand seven hundred and ninety-seven pounds fourteen shillings and sixpence out of the Consolidated Fund to the service of the years ending the thirty-first day of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy-three and one thousand eight hundred and seventy-four.|note4= }}\n| or the Supply Act 1874|public|2|30-03-1874|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to apply the sum of seven million pounds out of the Consolidated Fund to the service of the year ending the thirty-first day of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n| |note4= }}\n| or the Supply Act 1874|public|10|21-05-1874|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to apply the sum of thirteen million pounds out of the Consolidated Fund to the service of the year ending the thirty-first day of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five.|note4= }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  in regard to the Stamp Duty payable by Advocates in Scotland on admission as Barristers in England or Ireland, and by Barristers in England or Ireland on admission as Advocates in Scotland.|note4= }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n| or the Drainage and Improvement of Lands Amendment (Ireland) Act 1874|public|32|16-07-1874|archived=n|An Act to amend \"The Drainage and Improvement of Lands Act (Ireland), 1863.\" }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  so far as regards the reference of differences to the Railway Commissioners in lieu of Arbitrators.}}\n| or the Colonial Attornies Relief Act 1874|public|41|30-07-1874|archived=n|An Act to amend \"The Colonial Attornies Relief Act.\" }}\n|\n| or the Alkali Act (1863) Amendment Act 1874|public|43|30-07-1874|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to amend the Alkali Act, 1863.|note4= }}\n| or the Factories (Health of Women, &c.)
