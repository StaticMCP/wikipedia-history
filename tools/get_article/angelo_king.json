He played college football for the South Carolina State Bulldogs.\nEarly life\nKing attended Columbia High School. He accepted a football scholarship from the South Carolina State University.\nHe was named a starter at linebacker midway through his freshman season, and was a part of the 1977 team that was awarded the National Black Championship by the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper.\nKing was a four-year starter that received All-MEAC honors in 1979 and 1980. He also received honorable-mention Little All-American honors in 1980. As a senior, he blocked a school record 4 punts (6 in his career).\nIn 2007, he was named to the South Carolina State Centennial Football Team. In 2012, he was inducted into the South Carolina State Athletic Hall of Fame.\nProfessional career\nDallas Cowboys\nKing was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Dallas Cowboys after the 1981 NFL draft. He was waived on August 3. He was re-signed and released again on August 25. On September 8, he was re-signed after linebacker Mike Hegman fractured his arm in the season opener against the Washington Redskins. He played mainly on special teams and remained on the roster after Hegman returned.\nHe was mainly a nickel linebacker and special teams player for three seasons. On August 27, 1984, he was traded to the Detroit Lions in exchange for a sixth round draft choice (#151-Stan Gelbaugh).\nDetroit Lions\nKing was a part-time starter and special teams player for the Detroit Lions in his first season with the team. In 1985, the team changed to a 3-4 defense and although he was assigned the role of nickel linebacker, he eventually started 9 games after Michael Cofer was lost for the year and posted career-highs with 90 tackles (77 solo) and 4 sacks.\nThe next year, he missed 5 games with an ankle injury (4 weeks spent on the injured reserve list). After Jimmy Williams was lost for the year, he started the last 4 games at strongside linebacker and finished with 23 tackles.\nHe was cut on September 6, 1987. After the players went on a strike on the third week of the season, those games were canceled (reducing the 16 game season to 15) and the NFL decided that the games would be played with replacement players. King was re-signed to be a part of the Lions replacement team, but was injured in the first game and placed on the injured reserve list, before being released on October 27.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.scsuathletics.com/hof.aspx?hof=163 South Carolina State Hall of Fame bio]"
