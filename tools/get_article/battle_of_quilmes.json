The confrontations began at dawn on July 30, 1826 and lasted for three hours.\nBackground\nOn the night of July 29, while an Argentine convoy of troops and military equipment carried out a crossing to the Banda Oriental, escorted by the Río de la Plata schooner that was commanded by captain Leonardo Rosales, admiral Brown, with a force integrated by the 25 de Mayo frigate (flagship), the Congreso, Independencia, Republica and General Balcarce brigs, the Sarandí schooner and other small ships in a total of 18, was in his usual base waiting for the convoy's arrival and left the port in an unsuccessful attempt to surprise the Brazilians.\nThe Brazilian fleet, commanded by captain Norton, was composed of the Nichteroy frigate, the corvettes Liberal, Maria da Glória, Maceió and Itaparica, the brigs Pirajá, Caboclo and 29 de Agosto, the schooners Leal Paulistana, Dona Paula, Conceição and 7 de Março and a few gunboats, with a total of more than 200 guns. From 8 o'clock onwards, the fleet continued to sail until midnight, when it anchored to the east of the outer channel, near Ensenada waiting for the return of the convoy to attack it, which it finally did near the coast of Quilmes.\nOrder of Battle\nEmpire of Brazil\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"text-align: left;\" | Ships\n! style=\"text-align: left;\" | Type\n! style=\"text-align: left;\" | Guns\n|-\n| Nichteroy\n| Frigate\n| 38\n|-\n| Maria da Glória\n| Corvette\n| 30\n|-\n|\n| Corvette\n| 22\n|-\n| Maceió\n| Corvette\n| 20\n|-\n| Itaparica\n| Corvette\n| 20\n|-\n| Caboclo\n| Brig\n| 18\n|-\n| 29 de Agosto\n| Brig\n| 18\n|-\n| Pirajá\n| Brig\n| 18\n|-\n| Leal Paulistana\n| Schooner\n| 8\n|-\n| Conceição\n| Schooner\n| 4\n|-\n| Dona Paula\n| Schooner\n| 4\n|-\n| 7 de Março\n| Schooner\n| 3\n|-\n| 9 de Janeiro\n| Gunboat\n| 2\n|-\n| 12 de Outubro\n| Gunboat\n| 2\n|-\n| Itaparica\n| Gunboat\n| 1\n|-\n|}\nUnited Provinces of the Río de la Plata\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"text-align: left;\" | Ships\n! style=\"text-align: left;\" | Type\n! style=\"text-align: left;\" | Guns\n|-\n| 25 de Mayo\n| Frigate\n| 36\n|-\n| Independencia\n| Brig\n| 22\n|-\n| Congreso\n| Brig\n| 18\n|-\n| Republica\n| Brig\n| 16\n|-\n| Balcarce\n| Brig\n| 14\n|-\n| Oriental-Argentino\n| Brig\n| 13\n|-\n| Sarandí\n| Schooner\n| 8\n|-\n| Río\n| Schooner\n| 1\n|-\n| Pepa\n| Schooner\n| 1\n|-\n| 9 Gunboats\n| Gunboat\n| 1 gun each\n|-\n|}\nBattle\nAs Scheina puts it:\n}}\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.todoababor.es/datos_docum/nav_prov_rioplata.htm Ships of the United Provinces of the River Plate]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090406223215/http://www.hicon.pl/~pothkan/hhwn/Argentina-Sai.html Historical Handbook of World Navies]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090217084522/http://www.naval.com.br/NGB/ Ships of War]\n*[http://www.histarmar.com.ar/InfHistorica-2/AporteExtr-8.htm Article on the foreign origin of sailors involved in the Argentina-Brazil War]\n*[http://www.ara.mil.ar/ Official site of the Argentine Navy]\n*[http://www.mar.mil.br/ Official site of Brazilian Navy]"
