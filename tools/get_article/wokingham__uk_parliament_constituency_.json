From its creation in 1950 until 2024, it was represented solely by Conservatives, most notably, John Redwood, who held his position from 1987 until 2024 when he stepped down following the dissolution of parliament.\nSince 4 July 2024, Wokingham has been represented by Clive Jones, a Liberal Democrat.\nConstituency profile\nThe seat covers the prosperous town of Wokingham, the southern suburbs of Reading, and a rural area to the west. Residents are significantly wealthier than the UK average, reflected in high property prices. In 2019 the area was ranked as the least deprived constituency in the UK.\nHistory\nOriginally, Wokingham was part of a larger constituency of Berkshire, which returned two Members of Parliament (MPs), increased to three in the Reform Act 1832. In the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 Berkshire was divided into three county constituencies, Northern (Abingdon), Southern (Newbury), and Eastern (Wokingham), and two borough constituencies, Reading and New Windsor, each returning one member. The constituency was abolished under the Representation of the People Act 1918 being largely replaced by the newly created Windsor Division, with the town of Wokingham itself being added to the Newbury Division.\nThe second version of the seat was created for the 1950 general election. From 1983, its borders have gradually been moved westwards as new constituencies were created in the east of the county.\nThe constituency has been represented since 1987 by the high-profile Conservative John Redwood, having continuously elected Conservative MPs with comfortable majorities throughout its history. However, in 2019, the majority was drastically reduced to 11.9% from 31.5% in 2017 (and 43.2% in 2015) when Redwood was challenged by the Liberal Democrat candidate, Philip Lee, who had been the Conservative MP for the neighbouring constituency of Bracknell.\nIn December 2023, the Labour Party included the seat in its published list of 211 non-battleground seats, suggesting they did not see it as winnable. On 24 May 2024, two days after announcement of the date of the 2024 UK general election, and just 40 days before the actual date, John Redwood announced he would not be standing again, saying that he had 'other things I wish to do'. The 2024 election result saw Clive Jones of the Liberal Democrats take the seat – the first non-Conservative to do so in the seat's history.\nBoundaries and boundary changes\n|frame=yes|text=Map of 2010–2024 boundaries}}\n1885–1918\n* The Sessional Divisions of Maidenhead and Windsor;\n* Part of the Sessional Division of Wokingham; and\n* In the Sessional Division of Reading, the parishes of East Swallowfield and West Swallowfield.\n1950–1955\n* The Borough of Wokingham; and\n* The Rural Districts of Easthampstead and Wokingham.\n1955–1974\n* The Borough of Wokingham;\n* The Rural Districts of Easthampstead and Wokingham; and\n* The East ward of the County Borough of Reading.\nThe East ward of Reading was transferred from the abolished constituency of Reading South. From the 1964 general election, the Park ward replaced the East ward following a revision to the local authority wards.\n1974–1983\n* The Borough of Wokingham;\n* The Rural District of Easthampstead; and\n* The Rural District of Wokingham parishes of Remenham, Ruscombe, St Nicholas Hurst, Twyford, Wargrave, and Wokingham Without.\nThe Park ward of the County Borough of Reading was transferred to the re-established constituency of Reading South, along with western parts of the Rural District of Wokingham.\n1983–1997\n* The District of Wokingham wards of Bulmershe, California, Charvil, Coronation, Emmbrook, Evendons, Hurst, Little Hungerford, Loddon, Norreys, Redhatch, Remenham and Wargrave, St Sebastian's, Sonning, South Lake, Twyford and Ruscombe, Wescott, Whitegates, and Winnersh.\nThe seat regained north-western parts of Reading South (abolished once again). Eastern areas, comprising the District of Bracknell (formerly the Rural District of Easthampstead) formed the bulk of the new constituency of East Berkshire.\n1997–2010\n* The District of Wokingham wards of Arborfield, Barkham, Emmbrook, Evendons, Little Hungerford, Norreys, Redhatch, Shinfield, Swallowfield, Wescott, and Winnersh; and\n* The District of Newbury wards of Burghfield and Mortimer.\nThe boundaries moved westwards, gaining parts of Reading East (including Shinfield) and Newbury. The seat lost northern areas to Reading East and the new constituency of Maidenhead, as well as the ward of Wokingham Without in the south to the new constituency of Bracknell.\n2010–2024\n* The District of Wokingham wards of Arborfield, Barkham, Emmbrook, Evendons, Hawkedon, Hillside, Maiden Erlegh, Norreys, Shinfield North, Shinfield South, Swallowfield, Wescott, and Winnersh; and\n* The District of West Berkshire wards of Burghfield, Mortimer, and Sulhamstead.\nThis change saw a further minor gain from Newbury.\n2024–present\nUnder the 2023 periodic review of Westminster constituencies, the constituency was defined as being composed of the following, as they existed on 1 December 2020:\n* The Borough of Wokingham wards of: Arborfield; Barkham; Charvil; Emmbrook; Evendons; Finchampstead North; Finchampstead South; Hurst; Norreys; Remenham, Wargrave and Ruscombe; Swallowfield; Twyford; Wescott; Winnersh; Wokingham Without.\nThe seat underwent major changes, with about half the electorate being transferred out – the parts in the District of West Berkshire to the newly named constituency of Reading West and Mid Berkshire; and western parts of the District of Wokingham, including Earley and Shinfield, to the newly created constituency of Earley and Woodley. To compensate, the boundaries were extended southwards to include the Wokingham Without ward and the community of Finchampstead, transferred from Bracknell; and northwards to include the parts of Wokingham Borough previously in Maidenhead, including Twyford.\nFollowing a local government boundary review in Wokingham which came into effect in May 2024, the constituency now comprises the following from the 2024 general election:\n* The Borough of Wokingham wards or part wards of: Barkham & Arborfield; Emmbrook; Evendons; Finchampstead; Norreys; Spencers Wood & Swallowfield (part); Thames (except Sonning parish); Twyford, Ruscombe & Hurst; Wescott; Winnersh; Wokingham Without.\nThe seat currently comprises a majority of Wokingham district in Berkshire, centred around the town of Wokingham itself. It is in the South East region of England.\nThe neighbouring constituencies (clockwise from north) are: Wycombe, Maidenhead, Bracknell, North East Hampshire, Reading West and Mid Berkshire, Earley and Woodley, and Henley and Thame.\nMembers of Parliament\nMPs 1885–1918\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member\n!Party\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n|1885\n|Sir George Russell, Bt. || Conservative\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n|1898 by-election\n|Oliver Young || Conservative\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n|1901 by-election\n|Ernest Gardner || Conservative\n|-\n|\n|1918\n|colspan=\"2\"|Constituency abolished\n|}\nMPs since 1950\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member\n!Party\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n|1950\n|Peter Remnant || Conservative\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n|1959\n|Sir William van Straubenzee || Conservative\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n|1987\n|Sir John Redwood || Conservative\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n|2024\n|Clive Jones || Liberal Democrats\n|}\nElections\nElections in the 2020s\nElections in the 2010s\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | 2019 notional result\n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"130px\" colspan=\"2\" | Party\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"50px\" | Vote\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"30px\" | %\n|-\n|\n| Conservative ||align=right| 30,524 ||align=right| 55.5\n|-\n|\n| Liberal Democrats ||align=right| 17,774 ||align=right| 32.3\n|-\n|\n| Labour ||align=right| 5,423 ||align=right| 9.9\n|-\n|\n| Green ||align=right| 1,211 ||align=right| 2.2\n|-\n|\n| Others ||align=right| 80 ||align=right| 0.1\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\" bgcolor=\"#EAECF0\"|\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\"|Turnout\n|align=right|55,012\n|align=right|78.3\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\"|Electorate\n|align=right|70,235\n|}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n|votes = 5,516\n|percentage = 9.9\n|change = +6.8\n}}\n}}\nElections in the 2000s\n}}\n}}\nElections in the 1990s\n}}\n}}\nElections in the 1980s\n}}\n}}\nElections in the 1970s\nElections in the 1960s\nElections in the 1950s\nElection results 1885–1918\nElections in the 1880s\nElections in the 1890s\n|votes = 2,738\n|percentage = 35.4\n|change = New\n}}\n* Caused by Russell's death.\nElections in the 1900s\nElections in the 1910s\n}}\nSee also\n* List of parliamentary constituencies in Berkshire\n* List of parliamentary constituencies in the South East England (region)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://mapit.mysociety.org/area/13471.html Wokingham UK Parliament constituency] (boundaries April 1997 – April 2010) at MapIt UK\n*[https://mapit.mysociety.org/area/65774.html Wokingham UK Parliament constituency] (boundaries April 2010 – May 2024) at MapIt UK\n*[https://mapit.mysociety.org/area/168701.html Wokingham UK Parliament constituency] (boundaries from June 2024) at MapIt UK"
