Thus the River Ure and River Ouse can be counted as one river system or as two rivers. If it is counted as one, the River Aire/ River Ouse/Humber system would come fourth in the list, with a combined length of ; and the River Trent/Humber system would top the list with their combined length of .  Also, the Thames tributary, the River Churn, sourced at Seven Springs, adds  to the length of the Thames (from its traditional source at Thames Head). The Churn/Thames' length at  is therefore greater than the Severn's length of . Thus, the combined Churn/Thames river would top the list. Sue Owen et al., in their book on rivers, generally restrict the length to the parts that bear the same name. Thus the River Nene is quoted at , but would be around  more if the variously named sources were included. Many of the above lengths are considerably different from Sue Owen's list, some longer and some shorter.\nWhere a river ends in an estuary the conventional British approach has been to treat the river as ending at the end of the administrative zone. Thus the Severn ends at the mouth of the Bristol Avon and the Thames at the Yantlet Line. The currently accepted end of the Severn Estuary is about  further, and the Port of London's authority stretches now to Margate,  further. Other countries have different conventions, making comparisons of limited value. Those rivers which empty into other (non-tidal sections of) rivers are indicated in the table thus*. In Yorkshire, the Aire, Derwent, Don, and Wharfe all empty into a tidal section of the Yorkshire Ouse.\nThe calculation of mean flow presents its own challenges, relying on sampling at a limited number of gauging stations.   The data presented in the table are derived from those offered up by the National River Flow Archive, in particular the flow measured at the lowermost gauging stations on each named watercourse. Sometimes the figures of further downstream tributaries are combined with those of the main stem river to provide a more realistic flow figure for the lowermost non-tidal stretch of a watercourse.\nSee also\n* List of rivers of England\n* List of rivers of Ireland\n* List of rivers of Scotland\n* List of rivers of Wales\n* List of rivers in the Isle of Man\n* Terminology\n** Estuary\n** Firth\n** Floodplain\n** River\n** River delta\n** Source (river or stream)\n** Tributary\n** Canal & River Trust\n** Canals of the United Kingdom\n** Geography of the United Kingdom\n** List of lakes in the United Kingdom\n** Reservoirs and dams in the United Kingdom\n** Waterfalls of the United Kingdom\n** Waterways in the United Kingdom\nReferences\nhe:בריטניה הגדולה#נהרות"
