In fact, it was declared  ('Prince of cheeses, and first among desserts'), which only later became \"king of cheeses, cheese of kings\".\n* Roquefort in France: Frédéric Leblanc du Vernet, 1869\n* Époisses: Brillat-Savarin, early 19th century\n* Stilton in England (1912)\n* Cheddar in England\nCheeses are idiosyncratically named \"kings\" of particular types of cheese by individual writers: Maroilles, the king of strong cheeses; Halloumi, the \"king of cooking cheeses\"; Västerbotten, the king of Swedish cheeses; and Emmental, the king of Swiss cheeses.\nSometimes lower ranks of nobility are used for other cheeses, e.g., Camembert, the \"prince\" of cheeses.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## King of Cheeses\n\n#REDIRECT King of cheeses\n}}"
