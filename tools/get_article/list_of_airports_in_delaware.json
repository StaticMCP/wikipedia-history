It contains all public-use and military airports in the state. Some private-use and former airports may be included where notable, such as airports that were previously public-use, those with commercial enplanements recorded by the FAA or airports assigned an IATA airport code.\nFrom 2008 to 2013, Delaware was the only U.S state that had no airports in the FAA category known as commercial service (2,500+ boardings per year). In 2013, scheduled commercial airline passenger service became available at Wilmington Airport, but it ended in 2015. Commercial service to Wilmington Airport resumed in 2021, but ended again on June 6, 2022. Commercial service resumed in 2023.\nAirports\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- valign=baseline\n! style=\"white-space:nowrap; text-align:left;\"  | City served\n! style=\"white-space:nowrap; text-align:left;\"  | FAA\n! style=\"white-space:nowrap; text-align:left;\"  | IATA\n! style=\"white-space:nowrap; text-align:left;\"  | ICAO\n! style=\"white-space:nowrap; text-align:left;\"  | Airport name\n! style=\"white-space:nowrap; text-align:left;\"  | Role\n! style=\"white-space:nowrap; text-align:right;\" | Enplanements (2023)\n|- style=\"background:#CCCCCC;\"\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| Commercial service – primary airports\n|\n|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| Wilmington\n| [https://web.archive.org/web/20130512044708/http://www.deldot.gov/information/community_programs_and_services/airports/pdfs/new_castle_airport.pdf ILG]\n| ILG\n| KILG\n| Wilmington Airport\n| P-N\n| align=\"right\" | 133,377\n|- style=\"background:#CCCCCC;\"\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| Reliever airports\n|\n|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| Middletown\n| [https://web.archive.org/web/20090115222016/https://www.deldot.gov/information/community_programs_and_services/airports/pdfs/summit_airport.pdf EVY]\n|\n| KEVY\n| Summit Airport\n| R\n| align=\"right\" | 15\n|- style=\"background:#CCCCCC;\"\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| General aviation airports\n|\n|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| Dover / Cheswold\n| [https://web.archive.org/web/20130512044648/http://www.deldot.gov/information/community_programs_and_services/airports/pdfs/delaware_airpark.pdf 33N]\n|\n|\n| Delaware Airpark\n| GA\n| align=\"right\" | 5\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| Georgetown\n| [https://web.archive.org/web/20120206111101/http://www.deldot.gov/information/community_programs_and_services/airports/pdfs/sussex_county_airport.pdf GED]\n| GED\n| KGED\n| Delaware Coastal Airport\n| GA\n| align=\"right\" | 81\n|- style=\"background:#CCCCCC;\"\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| Other public-use airports (not listed in NPIAS)\n|\n|\n|- valign=top\n| Dover\n| [https://web.archive.org/web/20090612225543/http://www.deldot.gov/information/community_programs_and_services/airports/pdfs/chandelle_estates.pdf 0N4]\n|\n|\n| Chandelle Airport\n|\n|\n|- valign=top\n| Farmington\n| [https://web.archive.org/web/20090612225712/http://www.deldot.gov/information/community_programs_and_services/airports/pdfs/chorman_airport.pdf D74]\n|\n|\n| Chorman Airport\n|\n|\n|- valign=top\n| Felton\n| 0N6\n|\n|\n| Albanna Aviation Airport\n|\n|\n|- valign=top\n| Laurel\n| [https://web.archive.org/web/20090612225737/http://www.deldot.gov/information/community_programs_and_services/airports/pdfs/laurel_airport.pdf N06]\n|\n|\n| Laurel Airport\n|\n|\n|- valign=top\n| Smyrna\n| [https://web.archive.org/web/20090115222020/https://www.deldot.gov/information/community_programs_and_services/airports/pdfs/smyrna_airport.pdf 38N]\n|\n|\n| Smyrna Airport\n|\n|\n|- valign=top\n| Wyoming\n| [https://web.archive.org/web/20090612225724/http://www.deldot.gov/information/community_programs_and_services/airports/pdfs/jenkins_airport.pdf 15N]\n|\n|\n| Jenkins Airport\n|\n|\n|- style=\"background:#CCCCCC;\"\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| Other military airports\n|\n|\n|- valign=top\n| Dover\n| [https://web.archive.org/web/20090115221920/https://www.deldot.gov/information/community_programs_and_services/airports/pdfs/doverafb_civil_terminal.pdf DOV]\n| DOV\n| KDOV\n| Dover Air Force Base / Civil Air Terminal at Dover AFB\n|\n| align=right | 383\n|- style=\"background:#CCCCCC;\"\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| Notable former airports\n|\n|\n|- valign=top\n| Rehoboth Beach\n| REH\n|\n|\n| Rehoboth Airport\n|\n|\n|}\nSee also\n* Delaware World War II Army Airfields\nReferences\nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA):\n* [http://www.faa.gov/airports/airport_safety/airportdata_5010/ FAA Airport Data (Form 5010)] from National Flight Data Center (NFDC), also available from [http://www.gcr1.com/5010web/ AirportIQ 5010]\n* [http://www.faa.gov/airports/planning_capacity/npias/reports/index.cfm?sect=2011 National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (2017–2021)], released September 2016\n* [https://www.faa.gov/airports/planning_capacity/passenger_allcargo_stats/passenger/media/cy20-all-enplanements.xlsx Passenger Boarding (Enplanement) Data for CY 2019 and 2020], updated November 8, 2021\nDelaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT):\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090612225342/http://www.deldot.gov/information/community_programs_and_services/airports/ Airport Directory]\nOther sites used as a reference when compiling and updating this list:\n* [http://aviation-safety.net/ Aviation Safety Network] – used to check IATA airport codes\n* [http://gc.kls2.com/cgi-bin/gclookup?Q=state:US-DE Great Circle Mapper: Airports in Delaware] – used to check IATA and ICAO airport codes\n* [https://www.airfieldsfreeman.com/DE/Airfields_DE.htm Abandoned & Little-Known Airfields: Delaware] – used for information on former airports"
