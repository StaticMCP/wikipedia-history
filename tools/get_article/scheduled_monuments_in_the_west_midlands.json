Monuments are defined in the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 and the National Heritage Act 1983. Scheduled monuments—sometimes referred to as scheduled ancient monuments—can also be protected through listed building procedures, and English Heritage considers listed building status to be a better way of protecting buildings and standing structures. A scheduled monument that is later determined to \"no longer merit scheduling\" can be de-scheduled.\nScheduled monuments in the West Midlands county are divided by borough.\nBirmingham\nCoventry\nDudley\nSandwell\nSolihull\n*Hampton in Arden packhorse bridge\nWalsall\nWolverhampton\nReferences"
