To accomplish this, she approaches the most popular girl in school, Mai Oduka.  As soon as the school year begins, she is successful in joining her group of friends. However, pretending to be one of the popular girls when she has always been a loner is mentally taxing, and so as Renako walks alone to the school's rooftop one day to unwind, Mai discovers her and believes she is preparing to end her life. The miscommunication actually ends with both of them opening up to each other, and Renako returns home ecstatic that she has finally met someone to call her best friend. At least until Mai confesses her love the following day and asks her out. Renako is puzzled by the sudden confession, but Mai suggests that they play a game to see which relationship is more suitable for them: \"best friend\" or \"lover\".\nCharacters\n;\n:|date=October 30, 2021|access-date=March 21, 2025|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211030053128/https://ln-news.com/articles/112580|archive-date=October 30, 2021|url-status=live}} Kanna Nakamura (anime) Yukari Anzai (anime)}}\n:Mai's childhood friend and longstanding rival.

Unless...'' episodes}}\nAn anime television series adaptation was announced on November 19, 2024. It is produced by Studio Mother and directed by Natsumi Uchinuma, with Naruhisa Arakawa handling series composition and scripts, Kojikoji designing the characters, and Yoshiaki Fujisawa composing the music.

The opening theme song is \"Muri Muri Evolution\", performed by Akari Nanawo, while the ending theme song is \"Mayocchauwa\" (迷っちゃうわ), performed by The Dance for Philosophy. Remow licensed the series for streaming on the It's Anime YouTube channel.\nOn September 23, 2025, after the anime's finale, a sequel was announced. It will be first released theatrically on November 21 of the same year under the title ''There's No Freaking Way I'll Be Your Lover! Unless... ~Next Shine~. The sequel will then also air on television in five episodes at a later date.\nReception\nLight novel\nSean Gaffney of Manga Bookshelf'' gave the first light novel a mixed review, saying that although he could \"understand the appeal\", he was put off by Mai disregarding Renako's lack of consent to her advances and the \"very, very panicky teenager\" tone of Renako's narration. Gaffney additionally was disinterested in the harem premise of the series, saying he would prefer that the series focus on Renako and Mai's relationship development. He concluded his review by saying, \"this isn't bad. It just has a lot of things I personally dislike.\"\nManga\nThe manga adaptation was nominated for the 2021 and 2022 Next Manga Award in the web manga category.\nReviewing the first six volumes of the manga adaptation for Anime News Network, Rebecca Silverman gave it a positive review, praising the art, humor, character arcs, and complexity of the harem romance dynamics, but expressed discomfort with Mai's lack of concern for Renako's consent in several scenes, despite acknowledging it was \"clearly being done in a spirit of humor\". Silverman said that readers looking for a yuri harem story would likely enjoy the series.\nAnime\nThe first episode of the anime adaptation received mixed responses in ANN's Summer 2025 seasonal previews, with reviewers generally praising the visual presentation and animation, but divided on the premise. Caitlin Moore praised the color palette of the series, calling it \"bright in a pleasing way\", but was put off by Mai's characterization, describing her as \"a creep\". Despite this, Moore acknowledged that fans of the source material would almost certainly enjoy the \"energetic\" anime adaptation. Christopher Farris felt similarly about Mai, saying she was \"all but pressuring\", but described Renako as a relatable protagonist and expressed interest in further episodes. \"Bolts (MrAJCosplay)\" expressed similar sentiments, saying that they were \"a bit conflicted\" on the romance plot, and that they felt the episode abandoned the relatable plot thread of Renako's social anxiety in the second half. James Beckett gave the most positive review, praising the first-person perspective scene showing Renako's social anxiety at the episode's start, and called the story \"a cute premise for an adorable show\", saying that although it risked portraying Mai as predatory, \"she and Renako would make a superstar couple\".\nThe second episode also received a mixed response in ANN. Farris enjoyed the story's exploration of the \"blurry lines\" between friendship and romantic relationships, but disliked the episode's kissing scene on account of Mai continuing to further push Renako's boundaries. \"Bolts (MrAJCosplay)\" expressed a similar opinion. James Beckett, in contrast, acknowledged that Mai's behavior would constitute \"big red flags\" in reality, but opined that this was not an issue \"in the universe of a cartoon rom-com.\"\nVrai Kaiser of Anime Feminist gave the first episode a positive review, praising the \"neon edge\" of the visual presentation and the premise, but commented that some viewers might not enjoy the fast pace of the series.\nNotes\nSee also\n*Whisper Me a Love Song, a manga series written and illustrated by Eku Takeshima\n*Flower and Asura, a manga series illustrated by Musshu\n*Link!
