It turned into a large, toxic plume cloud that drifted into Seward. A mandatory evacuation was ordered for the town's approximately 300 residents, while a voluntary evacuation was put out for nearby Pecatonica and Winnebago. The incident caused at least 10 minor injuries, but no fatalities, and residents were allowed to return 12 hours later.\nReferences"
