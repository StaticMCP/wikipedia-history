Four genre categories were added the list of awards from the previous year and German liquor brand, Jägermeister were named as the sponsor of the event for the first time.\nIn 2015, Angus of Sneaky Sound System reflected on the night saying \"We felt incredibly proud. Being an independent artist we'd put so much time, energy and money into the album so to receive these awards felt really very special. The AIR Awards mean a lot. Platinum awards and chart success and glowing reviews are wonderful of course, but it is just as gratifying to be recognised by your fellow independent artists for the quality of you recordings.\"\nPerformers\n*British India\n*Ben Winkleman\n*Urthboy\n*Blue King Brown\nNominees and winners\nAIR Awards\nWinners are listed first and highlighted in boldface; other final nominees are listed alphabetically.\n{| class=wikitable style=\"width=\"150%\"\n|-\n! ! style=\"background:#589C89; width=;\"50%\"| Best Independent Artist\n! ! style=\"background:#589C89; width=;\"50%\"| Best Performing Independent Album\n|-\n|\n*Sneaky Sound System\n**Gotye\n**Hilltop Hoods\n**The John Butler Trio\n**Wolf & Cub\n|\n*'The John Butler Trio - Grand National' (Jarrah Records / MGM)\n** Blue King Brown - Stand Up (Roots Level / MGM)\n** Birds of Tokyo - Day One (Egg Records / MGM)\n** Hilltop Hoods - The Hard Road Restrung (Obese Records)\n** Sneaky Sound System - Sneaky Sound System (Whack Records / MGM)\n** Wolf & Cub - Vessels (Dot Dash / Inertia Music)\n|-\n! ! style=\"background:#589C89; width=;\"50%\"| Best Performing Independent Single / EP\n! ! style=\"background:#589C89; width=;\"50%\"| Best New Independent Artist\n|-\n|\n*Sneaky Sound System - \"UFO\"\n**Ricki-Lee Coulter - \"Can't Touch It\"\n**Sneaky Sound System - \"I Love It\"\n**Sneaky Sound System - \"Pictures\"\n**The Cops - \"80 in the Shade\"\n**The John Butler Trio - \"Funky Tonight\"\n|\n*British India (Flashpoint/Shock)\n**Birds of Tokyo (Egg Records / MGM)\n**Macromantics (Remote Control / Inertia Music)\n**Muph & Plutonic (Obese Records)\n**Toni Collette and the Finish (Hoola Hoop / MGM)\n**Urthboy (Elefant Traks / Inertia Music)\n|-\n! ! style=\"background:#589C89; width=;\"50%\"| Best Independent Blues and Roots Release\n! ! style=\"background:#589C89; width=;\"50%\"| Best Independent Country Release\n|-\n|\n*'C.W.
