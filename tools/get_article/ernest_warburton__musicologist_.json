His efforts were published from 1984 to 1999 in the 48 volumes of The Collected Works of Johann Christian Bach.\nWarburton was also an executive with BBC Radio, serving as Head of Music Programmes (1977–1982) and Editor of Music for BBC Radio 3 (1982–1986) before transferring to the BBC World Service. During this period, he revived many obscure operas, such as Wagner's Die Feen and Rienzi and Puccini's Le Villi.\nAs general editor of The Collected Works of Johann Christian Bach, Warburton not only edited a share of the music, but wrote out the scores printed in the edition in his own calligraphy.\nEarly career\nTeaching\nAfter obtaining his BA at Oxford in 1959, Warburton was unable to stay there to complete his DPhil, due to lack of funds. In 1960, he started work as a music teacher at Queen Mary's Grammar School for Boys, Basingstoke, Hants. Warburton continued working at Queen Mary's Grammar School until 1964, when he completed his DPhil .\nDuring his time teaching, his time was described in one of his obituaries: “Although feared by some for his acerbic tongue — unleashed only on those who fell below the high standards he set himself and required from others — he was a companionable and humorous man, long-suffering and often highly entertaining.” Warburton was known to severely admonish his school choir immediately before a concert, likening them to a “bunch of wet cod on a slab”.\nWarburton directed a production of Bach's St Matthew Passion at the town Parish Church. This production involved his own school choir, the choir of the Girls’ High School, and some professional soloists.\nWarburton was later known as “the white tornado” on account of his striking platinum blond hair (he had albinism), the boys’ nickname for him at the school was simply “Omo” (after the contemporary washing powder which was “whiter than white”).\nFrom 1964 to 1967 he was Director of Music at Bishop's Stortford College before moving to the BBC.\nBBC\nUpon moving to the BBC in Manchester, he became head of music within three years. In 1967, he produced his first broadcast opera, Puccini's Le Villi. In 1977, he moved to London as the BBC's Head of Music Programmes for radio. In 1986, he was appointed music organiser for the World Service, then managing editor, and later editor, BBC World Service, English. He retired in 1995.\nReferences\nSources\n*"
