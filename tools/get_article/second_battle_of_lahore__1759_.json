The Maratha Empire had left Punjab without any resistance, leaving the Sikhs alone against the Afghan Empire. The Afghan army marched for Lahore. When the Sikhs got intel, they attacked the army, scaring away the Durranis during the night.\nBattle\nWhen the Shah learnt about this, he sent a 40,000 strong army towards Lahore in order to teach the Sikhs a lesson. Jassa Singh was already prepared. When the battle began, Jassa Singh and Jai Singh attacked the Afghans from the right while the remaining Sikhs attacked from the left. If the Afghans attacked the Sikhs in the right, they would be attacked by the Sikhs in the left and vice versa. The battle concluded at night with both armies retreating, with the Afghans facing 2,000 slain, and Jahan Khan was wounded.\nAftermath\nAfter this fierce engagement, the Afghans had fought the Marathas in the Battle of Taraori (1759) and defeated them.\nReferences\nSee also\n* Nihang\n* Martyrdom and Sikhism"
