Mark struggles to ensure she sticks to the script as Ruby gets herself into a romantic entanglement with him and Ellie - who, despite the two being obvious incompatible, he has feelings for - and realises that her steadfastly ensuring she prioritises her geniality with customers who appreciate it over constantly trying to upsell does not always lead to disappointing results, and can be more important than always having a business-minded head.\n|LineColor       = A92311\n}}\n|AltDate = 23 January 2024\n|ShortSummary    =\n|LineColor       = A92311\n}}\n|AltDate = 30 January 2024\n|ShortSummary    =\n|LineColor       = A92311\n}}\n|AltDate = 6 February 2024\n|ShortSummary    =\n|LineColor       = A92311\n}}\n|AltDate = 13 February 2024\n|ShortSummary    =\n|LineColor       = A92311\n}}\n|AltDate = 20 February 2024\n|ShortSummary    =\n|LineColor       = A92311\n}}\n}}\nProduction\nThe series is produced by Lucy Lumsden and Jayde Adams for Yellow Door Productions. Ideas for the show were loosely inspired by Adams time spent working at a centre in the Stokes Croft area of Bristol.\nCasting\nIn the cast are local actors from Bristol who answered open casting adverts, including Dan Hiscox who was working as a care assistant in nearby village Pucklechurch.\nFilming\nFilming began in January 2023. Filming took place in the Totterdown area of South Bristol.\nBroadcast\nThe series was made available on ITVX from 22 June 2023.\nReception\nSteve Bennett wrote, in a two-and-a-half star review for Chortle, that Adams' character Ruby is \"just a little too bland to sustain the viewer’s interest – which is something of a surprise for anyone familiar with Adams's often brash, larger-than-life stand-up performances\". However, he praised the relatability of the characters - rather than being \"comedy archetypes\" - and that the show was mostly \"built on gentleness, both of the characters and of the action\", but that \"it may be quite a big ask for a streaming show to hope audiences stick with the show and warm to its laid-back pace\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
