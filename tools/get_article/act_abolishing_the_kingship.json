On 7 February, Parliament voted down the idea of continuing the monarchy and the act to abolish the office of King was formally passed on 17 March.\nOn 8 May 1660, the Convention Parliament proclaimed Charles II to have been lawful king of England since his father's death, leading to the restoration of the monarchy.\nFollowing the Restoration the act was declared void because it had not received royal assent.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040927073801/http://home.freeuk.net/don-aitken/ast/cp.html#214 Full text of the Act]"
