The arch was designed by Rosedale resident John LeRoy Marshall, inspired by the Arc de Triomphe. The flood-lighted structure is located on Mount Marty, and is most easily visible at night from the intersection of Rainbow Boulevard and Southwest Boulevard. A historic marker was dedicated under the arch in 1993 to honor the soldiers of World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War.\nHistory\nThe groundbreaking ceremony was on July 20, 1923, featuring French General Henri Gouraud. It was reportedly more impressive than the final opening ceremony.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* The Winding Valley and The Craggy Hillside : A History of the City of Rosedale, Kansas by Margaret Landis.
