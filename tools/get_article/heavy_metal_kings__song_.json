It was released in 2006 through Babygrande Records as the lead single from the group's fifth studio album Servants in Heaven, Kings in Hell.\nMain recording sessions took place in 2006 at Found Sound Recording in Philadelphia by Scott \"Supe\" Stallone, while Ill Bill's vocals were recorded at Powerhouse Studios in New York by Elliot Thomas. Written by Vinnie Paz, Ill Bill and Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind, it was produced by the latter. The song utilises a sample from \"Boiling Rage (Estuans Interius)\" by German composer Carl Orff, taken from his famous cantata Carmina Burana, and a vocal sample from Mobb Deep's \"Front Lines (Hell on Earth)\" for the chorus.\nThe single was released in a limited edition blue vinyl pressing, with every copy signed by group's lead vocalist Vinnie Paz. The music video was released shortly before the album's release, starring Vinnie Paz, Ill Bill, DJ Kwestion and R.A. the Rugged Man.\nThis title of the song inspired Vinnie Paz and Ill Bill to release an eponymous collaborative album, which was dropped in 2011. In 2017, the duo of Paz and Bill released their second collaborative album, Black God White Devil, under the 'Heavy Metal Kings' moniker.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n*Vincenzo \"Vinnie Paz\" Luvineri — songwriter, first and third verses, chorus\n*William \"Ill Bill\" Braunstein — songwriter, second verse\n*Kevin \"Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind\" Baldwin — songwriter, producer\n*Dave \"DJ Kwestion\" Klein — scratches\n*Scott \"Supe\" Stallone — recording, mixing\n*Elliot Thomas — additional vocal recording\n*Michael Sarsfield — mastering\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
