The Cemetery is located on the south-east of Albert on the junctions of the roads to Peronne (D938) and Bray-sur-Somme (D329).\nBackground\nWorld War I\nThe extension was first used by the British in August 1915 when the British first held the Albert. Before that, the French held Albert and had done so even through the German advance on the Somme and the. subsequent Battle of Albert in September 1914.\nThe Extension was used by fighting units and Field Ambulances from August 1915 to November 1916, and more particularly in and after mid to late 1916, when Field Ambulances were concentrated at Albert due to the  Battle of Albert 1916 and the wider Somme Campaign. From November 1916, the 5th Casualty Clearing Station used it for two months. From March 1917 to February 1918, it was not used, until 4 burials in March 1918. Plot II was created in August 1918 by the 18th Division.\nIt was captured by the Germans on 26 April 1918 and before its recapture by the 8th Battalion East Surrey Regiment on the following 22 August during the Battle of Albert 1918 it had been completely destroyed by artillery fire.\nWorld War II\nDuring the Second World War it was used again after the French moved British graves into the cemetery from isolated areas around Albert.\nThe Cemetery\nThe War graves are located in an extension to the original local cemetery of Albert.\nThe majority of graves are arranged face towards the road with Cross of Sacrifice at the head in the centre. A few more additional roads line the side of the Cross with the rest of the graves being located next to the main plot separated by a wide path. The War graves are separated from the rest of the communal cemetery by low walls, hedges and fences.\nBurials\nThere are a total of 888 burials with 868 being identifiable, the rest are unknown soldiers and are thus marked as such. 12 of these unidentifiable burials are from the First World War and 8 are from the Second World War.\nFive graves were destroyed by shell fire and as such are now represented by memorials to them. Two soldiers known to be among the casualties buried here, but whose graves could not be identified, are commemorated by memorials, inscribed, \"Known to be buried in this cemetery\"\nBurials by unit\n1st Battalion, Canadian Mounted Rifles: 6\n2nd Battalion, Canadian Mounted Rifles: 2\n4th Battalion, Canadian Mounted Rifles: 3\n5th Battalion, Canadian Mounted Rifles: 2\n29th Lancers, Deccan Horse): 1\n2nd Battalion Canadian Mounted Rifles: 2\nQueen Victoria's Own Sappers and Miners: 1\n43rd Erinpura Regiment: 1\nArgyll and Sutherland Highlanders: 1\nArmy Ordnance Corps: 2\nArmy Service Corps: 20\nArmy Veterinary Corps: 1\nAustralian Army Medical Corps: 2\nRoyal Australian Engineers: 4\nRoyal Australian Artillery: 1\nAustralian Infantry, Australian Imperial Force: 27\nAustralian Light Trench Mortar Battery: 1\nAustralian Pioneers: 3\nBedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment: 17\nBlack Watch: 10\nBritish West Indies Regiment: 2\nCambridgeshire Regiment: 1\nQueen's Own Cameron Highlanders: 4\nCameronians (Scottish Rifles): 2\nCanadian Army Medical Corps: 13\nCanadian Army Service Corps: 1\nCanadian Engineers: 11\nCanadian Field Artillery: 19\nCanadian Infantry Corps:118\nCanadian Machine Gun Corps: 7\nCanadian Pioneers: 8\nCanadian Corps of Signals: 1\nDorsetshire Regiment: 1\nDuke of Cornwall's Light Infantry: 1\nDuke of Wellington's (West Riding Regiment): 1\nDurham Light Infantry: 7\nEast Lancashire Regiment: 5\nEast Yorkshire Regiment: 1\nEssex Regiment: 40\nGeneral List: 1\nGeneral Staff: 2\nGloucestershire Regiment: 8\nGordon Highlanders: 5\nGrenadier Guards: 1\nHighland Light Infantry: 1\nKing's Own (Royal Lancaster Regiment): 4\nKing's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry: 6\nKing's Royal Rifle Corps: 6\nKing's Shropshire Light Infantry: 2\nLancashire Fusiliers: 9\nLeicestershire Regiment: 2\nLeinster Regiment: 1\nLincolnshire Regiment: 11\nLondon Regiment (1908–1938): 1\nMachine Gun Corps: 5\nManchester Regiment: 5\nMiddlesex Regiment: 2\nNorfolk Regiment: 12\nNorth Staffordshire Regiment: 10\nNorthamptonshire Regiment: 13\nNorthumberland Fusiliers: 66\nNorthumberland Hussars: 1\nPrincess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry: 4\nQueen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment: 20\nRoyal Army Medical Corps: 13\nRoyal Berkshire Regiment: 14\nRoyal Canadian Regiment: 5\nRoyal Engineers: 38\nRoyal Field Artillery: 50\nRoyal Fusiliers: 18\nRoyal Garrison Artillery: 40\nRoyal Horse Artillery: 1\nRoyal Horse Guards: 2\nRoyal Irish Rifles: 3\nRoyal Munster Fusiliers: 3\nRoyal Scots: 16\nRoyal Sussex Regiment: 6\nRoyal Warwickshire Regiment: 9\nSeaforth Highlanders: 1\nSherwood Foresters: 8\nSouth Lancashire Regiment: 5\nSouth Staffordshire Regiment: 3\nSouth Wales Borderers: 10\nSuffolk Regiment: 21\nBuffs (Royal East Kent Regiment): 17\nLoyal Regiment (North Lancashire): 2\nQueen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey): 5\nWelch Regiment: 8\nWest Yorkshire Regiment (Prince of Wales's Own): 3\nWiltshire Regiment: 1\nWorcestershire Regiment: 4\nYork and Lancaster Regiment: 9\nYorkshire Regiment (Alexandra, Princess of Wales's Own): 4\nNotable burials\nTwo deserters by the names of Pioneer Ernest Beeby ( 212th Company, Royal Engineers) and Private Henry Palmer (1st/5th Battalions Royal Northumberland Fusiliers) were executed at dawn by firing squads.
