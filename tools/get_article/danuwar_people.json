They speak Danwar language. Danuwars can be found throughout the hills and Terai regions of central and eastern Nepal but they mainly reside in Sindhuli and Udayapur district. They have close physical and cultural similarities with Tharus of Terai. There are various sub groups largely Rajhan, Kachhade, Rai-Danuwar and Tharu Danuwar.\nEtymology\nThe word Danuwar is thought to be derived from the word 'Duna' which means leaves plates and people consuming food in it were later called Danuwar. Another theory suggest that it is derived from the Sanskrit Dronibar which signifies the plain land between the confluences of two rivers situated in the laps of the two hills.\nLanguage\nDanuwar people speak Danwar language (also known as Danwari) which is close to Bote-Darai and Tharu languages. According to the census of 2011, there were a total of 46,000 who considered Danuwar as their mother tongue.\nReligion\nDanuwar people consider themselves as Nature worshippers. However many follow Hinduism and some even wear 'sacred thread' like the Brahmins.\nReferences"
