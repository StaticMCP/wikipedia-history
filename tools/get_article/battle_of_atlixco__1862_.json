The republicans were commanded by Tomas O'Horan, who later defected and was executed at the end of the war. The imperials were commanded by Leonardo Marquez, a veteran of the Mexican–American War and supporter of Miguel Miramón known as the \"Tiger of Tacubaya\". The two sides were evenly matched with 1,000 soldiers each. The republicans were victorious.\nReferences"
