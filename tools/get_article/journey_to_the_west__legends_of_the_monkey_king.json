It is based on the 16th-century novel Journey to the West. There are 26 episodes (52 segments) in total, with a duration of about 22 minutes each (11 minutes per segment), along with a 75-minute prequel television film. In the original 1999 Chinese edition of the series, there are instead 52 episodes with each segment being extended to a full, half-hour episode with added animation and dialogue, and the prequels making up episodes 1–7.\nThe English-language version of the show was produced by Cinar (now WildBrain, previously Cookie Jar Group and then DHX Media). It first aired on Teletoon in Canada in 2000, and was later aired on the Cookie Jar Toons block on This TV in the U.S. from 2009 to 2010. In Indonesia, it was broadcast by Indosiar in 1999 to 2000 every Monday morning.\nThe production began in 1992. It has since been regarded as a classic of Chinese animation.\nSummary\nSun Wukong, who was born from a magic stone, has been imprisoned underneath a mountain for five centuries for his mischief in the heavens. One day, the Guanyin told Monkey that the Monk Tang Sanzang will set him free and Monkey will join him on a pilgrimage from China to India. The next day, Tripitaka came and set Monkey free, and the two started their Journey to the West. Along the way, they meet two new friends, Zhu Bajie and the Hermit Sha Wujing, who join them on the journey; together, they face many dangers and evil creatures and sorcerers and learn to get along.\nCast\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Character (English name)\n!Mandarin Chinese voice\n!English voice\n|-\n|Sun Wukong (The Monkey King)\n|Zhang Hanyu (episodes 1-7);\nShen Xiaoqian (episodes 8-52)\n|Thor Bishopric\n|-\n|Tang Sanzang (Tripitaka)\n|Qiao Zhen\n|Terrence Scammell\n|-\n|Zhu Bajie (Pigsy)\n|Cheng Yuzhu\n|Mark Camacho\n|-\n|Sha Wujing (Sandy)\n|Liu Feng\n|A.J.
