A reward of 50 pounds for Bacon's capture was offered by the governor of New Jersey, William Livingston.\nA Continental militia, commanded by Richard Shreve and Edward Thomas, set out to hunt Bacon down on December 1782. After several days of unsuccessful search it returned to Burlington, New Jersey. En route, the Continentals stopped at the tavern near the bridge, unaware of Bacon and his men on the other side.\nLearning that the Continental militia was nearby, Bacon had little time to escape and so decided to barricade the bridge and open fire on the Continentals. After holding off the Continentals for some time the Continentals began to overcome them. Local inhabitants heard the gunfire and came to the aid of the Loyalists, which gave Bacon and his men time to escape. The Continentals overpowered the local Loyalist supporters and captured several of them.\nBacon was discovered, captured, and killed at a tavern in Tuckerton, New Jersey, a few months after the engagement. He was so hated among the populace there that his corpse was paraded through town and around the countryside before its burial in an unmarked grave.\nReferences"
