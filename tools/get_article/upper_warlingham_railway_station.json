Outside the station is a self-service passenger-operated ticket machine with cash and contactless payments. There is a card only ticket machine located on platform 2.\nThe \"Upper\" prefix originated because what is now  station on the Caterham line, approximately  to the south west, was previously (until 1956) called Warlingham station and the prefix was originally necessary to differentiate them, Whyteleafe South station being lower down in the valley.
