Managers are not permitted to vote for their own players.  Eighteen Gold Gloves are awarded each year (with the exception of 1957, 1985, 2007 and 2018), one at each of the nine positions in each league. In 1957, the baseball glove manufacturer Rawlings created the Gold Glove Award to commemorate the best fielding performance at each position. The award was created from a glove made from gold lamé-tanned leather and affixed to a walnut base. Initially, only one Gold Glove per position was awarded to the top fielder at each position in the entire league; however, separate awards were given for the National and American Leagues beginning in 1958.\nBeginning in , Major League Baseball awarded a Gold Glove Award to a utility player (i.e. players who played multiple fielding positions in a given season).\nKey\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n| Year\n| Links to the corresponding Major League Baseball season\n|-\n| PO\n| Putout\n|-\n| A\n| Assist\n|-\n| E\n| Error\n|-\n| DP\n| Double play\n|-\n| FPct\n| Fielding percentage\n|-\n|bgcolor=#bbeeff| * or **\n| Winner of the most Gold Glove Awards at his position (** indicates tie)\n|-\n| †\n| Member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum\n|}\nAmerican League winners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!
