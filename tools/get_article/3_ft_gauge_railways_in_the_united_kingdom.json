In fact, in 1802, a  gauge plateway-type railway owned by the Coalbrookdale Company in England became the first railway in the world to have a locomotive designed and built for it. The locomotive's designer, Richard Trevithick, is credited with making the first recorded successful demonstration of a locomotive on rails (in 1804 on a different railway in Wales).  gauge locomotive-powered railways, along with other narrow-gauge railways of varying widths, would later become one of the most common railway gauges chosen for short-distance lines in the British Isles, such as those found in mines and industrial sites (see table below).\nRailways\n{|class=wikitable\n!Country/territory\n!Railway\n|-\n|England\n|\n*Alan Keef Headquarters (private) ( gauge lines and dual gauge lines with  gauge track also present) (all  gauge trackage is dual-gauged with  gauge trackage) (operating)\n*British Moss Litter Company (defunct)\n*City of Worcester Tramways Company (defunct)\n*Coalbrookdale Company (world's first railway to have a locomotive designed and built for it; however, no record of a successful run of this locomotive exists) (gauge of locomotive itself slightly wider than  gauge due to railway's plateway design) (defunct)\n*Crowle Peatland Railway (operating)\n*Eastwell tramway (defunct)\n*Geltsdale Reservoir Railway (defunct)\n*Kettering Ironstone Railway (1876-1962)\n*Moorends Works (standard-gauge lines also present) (defunct)\n*Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway (converted to  gauge) (operating)\n*Redlake Tramway (defunct)\n*Rye and Camber Tramway (defunct)\n*Scropton Tramway (defunct)\n*Southend Pier Railway (1986-present) (operating)\n*Southwold Railway (defunct)\n*Steep Grade Railway (defunct)\n*Thorne and Hatfield Moors (defunct)\n*Titterstone Clee Hill (defunct)\n*Torrington and Marland Railway (defunct)\n*Tramways Trust Company (defunct)\n*Trevithick Shed (located in Blists Hill Victorian Town) (UNESCO World Heritage Site status shared with entire Ironbridge Gorge area) (separate standard-gauge railway named Hay Inclined Lift and separate  gauge railway named Mine Railway also present) (operating)\n*Tynemouth and District Tramways (defunct)\n*Woolsthorpe tramway (defunct)\n*Worcester Tramways Company (defunct)\n|-\n|Northern Ireland\n|\n|-\n|Scotland\n|\n*Lochaber Narrow Gauge Railway (dual gauge lines with standard-gauge track also present) (defunct)\n*Skye Marble Railway (defunct)\n*Strathbathie Light Railway (1900-1949)\n|-\n|Wales\n|\n*Barmouth Junction and Arthog Tramway (defunct)\n*Deep Mine Railway (located in Llechwedd Slate Caverns) (separate  gauge railway named Miners' Tramway also present) (operating)\n*Gorseddau Tramway (defunct)\n*Llanelly Tramways (defunct)\n*Little Ormes Head Quarry Tramway (defunct)\n*Penmaenmawr & Welsh Granite Co.
