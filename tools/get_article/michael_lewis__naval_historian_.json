Jonathan Clayton, a headmaster, and niece of the clergyman and Cambridge tutor Charles Clayton. The Lewis family were minor Carmarthenshire gentry, with a strong clerical tradition alongside farming, who had made money in inn-keeping; on his father's side Lewis descended from the sailor Sir Richard Hawkins and the judge Sir William Elias Taunton, whose father, also Sir William Elias Taunton, Clerk of the Peace of Oxfordshire and Town Clerk of Oxford, bought the Freeland Lodge estate near Eynsham, Oxfordshire where Lewis was born a century later. Lewis was educated at Uppingham School and studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took a Bachelor of Arts degree with honours in 1912 and a Master of Arts in 1924.\nDuring the First World War, he served in the Royal Marines from 1914 to 1919, becoming a lieutenant.\nAcademic career\nLewis spent his entire 42-year academic career in English naval colleges.
