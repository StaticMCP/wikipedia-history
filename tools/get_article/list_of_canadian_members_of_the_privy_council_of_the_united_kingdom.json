Counsellors have the prenominal title of \"Right Honourable\" and the postnominal title \"PC\", for Privy Counsellor.  Several Governors General were appointed to the council, if they were not already members, while Canadian prime ministers were also appointed, with three exceptions (Alexander Mackenzie, John Abbott and Mackenzie Bowell). Chief Justices were also sworn in, which allowed them to sit on the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which was the highest court of appeal for Canada until 1949. Some High Commissioners to London were also sworn into the Imperial Privy Council, as well as a few federal cabinet ministers on the recommendation of the Canadian prime minister.\nWhen Canadian appointments to the Imperial Privy Council ended in 1968, the Canadian Privy Council began awarding the title of \"Right Honourable\" to the Prime Minister, Chief Justice and select Canadians.\nIn addition, some Canadians living in the UK, such as Bonar Law, were appointed to the Privy Council in connection with their involvement in UK politics.\nGovernors General\n*Earl of Minto (1901-1904) (11 August 1902)\n*Earl of Bessborough (1931-1935) (20 March 1931)\n*Lord Tweedsmuir (1935-1940) (28 May 1937)\nPrime Ministers\n*Sir John A.
