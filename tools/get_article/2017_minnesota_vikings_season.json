With the team's home stadium, U.S. Bank Stadium, scheduled to host Super Bowl LII at the end of the season, the Vikings attempted to make history as the first team to play the Super Bowl on their home field; in recording their best regular season record since 1998, they clinched a first-round bye for the first time since 2009 and became the eighth team in the Super Bowl era to qualify for the playoffs in a season in which their stadium hosted the Super Bowl. They defeated the New Orleans Saints in the divisional round 29–24 on a walk-off play referred to as the \"Minneapolis Miracle\", but lost 38–7 to the eventual Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC Championship Game, preventing them from becoming the first team in NFL history to play a Super Bowl in their home stadium.\nThis was the first season since 2006 without star running back Adrian Peterson on the roster, as the team declined his contract option in February.\nRoster changes\n2017 draft\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|style=\"background-color:lightsteelblue; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; width:2em;\"|\n|Pro Bowler\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\" style=\"\"| 2017 Minnesota Vikings draft\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Draft order\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Player name\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Position\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| College\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Contract\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Notes\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Round\n!style=\"\"| Selection\n|-\n! 1 || 14\n|colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the Philadelphia Eagles}} ||\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 2 || 41\n| bgcolor=lightsteelblue| Dalvin Cook || RB || Florida State || 4 years / $6.35&nbsp;million || from Bengals}}\n|-\n! 48\n|colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the Cincinnati Bengals\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=\"4\"| 3 || 70\n| Pat Elflein || C || Ohio State || 4 years / $3.33&nbsp;million || from Jets\n|-\n! 79\n| colspan=\"4\"|Traded to the New York Jets ||\n|-\n! 86\n| colspan=\"4\"|Traded to the Kansas City Chiefs || from Dolphins}}\n|-\n! 104\n| colspan=\"4\"|Traded to the San Francisco 49ers || from Chiefs\n|-\n! rowspan=\"5\"|4 || 109\n| Jaleel Johnson || DT || Iowa ||  || from 49ers\n|-\n! 120\n| Ben Gedeon || LB || Michigan ||  ||\n|-\n! 128\n| colspan=\"4\"|Traded to the Cincinnati Bengals || from Dolphins\n|-\n! 132\n| colspan=\"4\"|Traded to the Philadelphia Eagles || from Chiefs\n|-\n! 139\n| colspan=\"4\"|Traded to the Kansas City Chiefs || from Browns via Eagles\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\"| 5 || 160\n| colspan=\"4\"|Traded to the New York Jets ||\n|-\n! 170\n| Rodney Adams || WR || South Florida ||  || from Chiefs\n|-\n! 180\n| Danny Isidora || G || Miami (FL) ||  || from Chiefs\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|6 || 199\n| colspan=\"4\"|Traded to the Washington Redskins ||\n|-\n! 201\n| Bucky Hodges || TE || Virginia Tech ||  || from Redskins\n|-\n! rowspan=\"5\"|7 || 219\n| Stacy Coley || WR || Miami (FL) ||  || from Browns via 49ers\n|-\n! 220\n| Ifeadi Odenigbo || DE || Northwestern ||  || from 49ers via Redskins\n|-\n! 230\n| colspan=\"4\"|Traded to the Washington Redskins || from Eagles\n|-\n! 232\n| Elijah Lee || LB || Kansas State ||  ||\n|-\n! 245\n| Jack Tocho || CB || NC State ||  || from Chiefs\n|}\nDraft trades\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ 2017 Minnesota Vikings undrafted free agents\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Name\n!style=\"\"| Position\n!style=\"\"| College\n|-\n| Wes Lunt || QB || Illinois\n|-\n| Terrell Newby || RB || Nebraska\n|-\n| R.

Despite going to Lincoln Financial Field as three-point favorites, primarily due to a general lack of confidence in Eagles second-string quarterback Nick Foles, the Vikings lost in a massive upset to the number 1 seeded Philadelphia Eagles by a score of 38–7. Although the Vikings took an early lead on their opening drive via a pass from Case Keenum to Kyle Rudolph, the Eagles leveled the scores on a 50-yard Patrick Robinson interception return before scoring a further 31 unanswered points over the final three-quarters. This loss extended the Vikings' NFC title drought to 41 seasons, second only to the Detroit Lions' 48.\nPro Bowl\nFour Vikings players were elected to the Pro Bowl when the rosters were announced on December 19, 2017, with three-time selection Everson Griffen, two-time selection Xavier Rhodes and first-timer Adam Thielen all named as starters, while Griffen's fellow third-timer Anthony Barr was named on the bench at outside linebacker behind the Cardinals' Chandler Jones and the Redskins' Ryan Kerrigan. Safety Harrison Smith was rated as the best safety in the league by Pro Football Focus over the course of the season, but was not included in the roster for the Pro Bowl, leading to some considering him to be one of the biggest snubs of the season.\nSmith was eventually named to the NFC's Pro Bowl roster on January 22, after New York Giants safety Landon Collins withdrew due to injury. Kyle Rudolph was also included after Jimmy Graham pulled out with an injury, while Linval Joseph took the place of the Super Bowl-bound Philadelphia Eagles' Fletcher Cox. Smith will be appearing in his third straight Pro Bowl, while Rudolph and Joseph are appearing in their second career Pro Bowls. Barr and Griffen also pulled out of the Pro Bowl due to injury, replaced by Thomas Davis and Michael Bennett respectively.\nStatistics\nTeam leaders\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=150px style=\"\"| Category\n!width=150px style=\"\"| Player(s)\n!width=75px style=\"\"| Total\n|-\n| Passing yards || Case Keenum || 3,547\n|-\n| Passing touchdowns || Case Keenum || 22\n|-\n| Rushing yards || Latavius Murray || 842\n|-\n| Rushing touchdowns || Latavius Murray || 8\n|-\n| Receptions || Adam Thielen || 91\n|-\n| Receiving yards || Adam Thielen || 1,276\n|-\n| Receiving touchdowns || Stefon DiggsKyle Rudolph || 8\n|-\n| Points || Kai Forbath || 130\n|-\n| Kickoff return yards || Jerick McKinnon || 312\n|-\n| Punt return yards || Marcus Sherels || 372\n|-\n| Tackles || Eric Kendricks || 113\n|-\n| Sacks || Everson Griffen || 13.0\n|-\n| Interceptions || Harrison Smith || 5\n|-\n| Forced fumbles || Everson Griffen || 3\n|}\nSource: Minnesota Vikings' official website\nLeague rankings\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=150px style=\"\"| Category\n!width=100px style=\"\"| Total yards\n!width=110px style=\"\"| Yards per game\n!width=80px style=\"\"| NFL rank\n|-\n| Passing offense || 3,753 || 234.6 || 11th\n|-\n| Rushing offense || 1,957 || 122.3 || 7th\n|-\n| Total offense || 5,710 || 356.9 || 11th\n|-\n| Passing defense || 3,078 || 192.4 || 2nd\n|-\n| Rushing defense || 1,337 || 83.6 || 2nd\n|-\n| Total defense || 4,415 || 275.9 || 1st\n|}\nSource: NFL.com\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
