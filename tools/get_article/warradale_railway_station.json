Situated in the south-western Adelaide suburb of Warradale, it is 13.7 kilometres from Adelaide station. It was gutted by fire and subsequently rebuilt.\nHistory\nWarradale Station was built in 1956, 42 years after Hove Station was opened which is just west of the station. The station was destroyed by a fire in 2002 and was subsequently rebuilt. It is located on Railway Terrace, Warradale, close to the Oaklands station to the east.\nIt consists of one centre island platform accessible by an underpass and a pedestrian crossing at the eastern end of the platform. The station has been resurfaced in patches numerous times and is quite an uneven surface. The shelter of the station is unique on the Seaford line but similar to the original Elizabeth and Elizabeth South shelters. The station underpass is one similar to the Brighton underpass and is reasonably narrow.\nServices by platform\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Platform\n!Destination/s\n|-\n| style=\"background:#\" |1\n|Seaford\n|-\n| style=\"background:#\" |2\n|Adelaide\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links"
