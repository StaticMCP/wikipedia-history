They occur commonly in polytheistic religions.\nUnlike most gods and goddesses in polytheistic religions, monotheistic deities have traditionally been portrayed in their mythologies as commanding war in order to spread religion. (The intimate connection between \"holy war\" and the \"one true god\" belief of monotheism has been noted by many scholars, including Jonathan Kirsch in his book God Against The Gods: The History of the War Between Monotheism and Polytheism and Joseph Campbell in The Masks of God, Vol. 3: Occidental Mythology.)\nThe following is a list of war deities:\nAfrica\nEgyptian\n, an Egyptian goddess of warfare]]\n*Anat-- also known as Anath-- was a goddess of fertility, sexuality, love, and war.
