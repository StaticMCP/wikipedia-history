The team previously operated from 1970 to 2018 and were based at Derwent Park Stadium. They re-opened in 2022, competing during the 2023 National Development League speedway season.\nHistory\n1970s\nSpeedway began in Workington after a successful application was made by the promotion team for a licence to race at Derwent Park for the 1970 season. The promoters were Ian Thomas and Jeff Brownhut and the rugby pitch required moving 25 yards sideways to accommodate the speedway track.\nThe team's inaugural league season was the 1970 British League Division Two season and the opening fixture was held on 3 April against Berwick Bandits in a Border Trophy match. The team finished the season in 11th place.\nThe 1973 season resulted in the team finishing runner-up to Boston Barracudas, a season which saw number 1 rider Lou Sansom top the league averages with an average of 10.56. After a third place finish in 1976, the Comets struggled near the foot of the table from 1977 to 1979.\n1980s\nThe new decade resulted in even worse results, the Comets lost 36 of their 38 matches in 1980 and only fared a little better in 1981. This led to the teams' withdrawal from the league just before the start of the 1982 season.\nSpeedway returned to Derwent Park in 1987, when Glasgow Tigers arrived to race, while searching for a new home. However the team changed its name to Workington Tigers soon afterwards but held their last fixture against Stoke on 31 July. The team's results were expunged. It was the last season of speedway at Workington for twelve years.\nReturn & 2000s\nThe Comets returned in 1999, when Ian Thomas, together with Tony Mole brought back the team to race in the Premier League (division 2). They also made a star signing by recruiting Carl Stonehewer, who with Brent Werner won the Premier League Pairs Championship.\nStonehewer was not only Workington's top rider but was the stand out rider in the Premier League, winning the Riders' Championship in 2000 and 2001, the pairs in 2000, 2001 and 2003 and the Premier League Four-Team Championship in 2001 and 2004. James Wright replaced Stonehewer in 2006 but continued to help Workington win trophies by leading the team to the fours title again. Wright then won the Riders' Championship in 2007. The following season in 2008, the Comets won the Young Shield, pairs and fours and in 2009, there were Young Shield and fours successes. The return of speedway in Workington had provided a golden era.\nOff the track and at the end of the 2007 season, the club had been sold by promoter Tony Mole to businessman Keith Denham.\n2010s\nDespite several team changes taking place in 2010, the Comets won a third consecutive Young Shield and two seasons later in 2012 won the pairs, courtesy of Adam Roynon and René Bach. Craig Cook topped the league averages in 2017.\nIn October 2018, the Comets won the SGB Championship for the first time in their history. In the same month, the Comets completed a treble with Knockout Cup and Championship Shield victories. Despite such a successful season, it was announced in January 2019 that the Comets were withdrawing from the SGB Championship for financial reasons.\n2020s\nIn 2021, the return of speedway to Workington was announced, with the previous Northside training track in the town being redeveloped for league racing. The team, under the control of local businessman Andrew Bain, were set to enter the 2022 National League but a series of vandalism incidents at the circuit pushed this back a year. Having received permission to use the 'Comets' nickname, the club returned to action for the 2023 National Development League speedway season. Following their successful return in 2023, they announced that for the 2024 season they would move up a division and duly competed in the SGB Championship.\nNotable riders\nRené Bach\n* Neil Collins\n* Craig Cook\n* Rusty Harrison\n* Peter Ingvar Karlsson\n* Daniel Nermark\n* Kauko Nieminen\n* Taffy Owen\n* Mick Powell\n* Adam Roynon\n* Lou Sansom\n* Simon Stead\n* Carl Stonehewer\n* Brent Werner\n* James Wright\n}}\nSeason summary\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=350|Year and league\n!width=50|Position\n!width=350|Notes\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 1970 British League Division Two season || 11th ||\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 1971 British League Division Two season || 15th ||\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 1972 British League Division Two season || 7th ||\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 1973 British League Division Two season || 2nd ||\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 1974 British League Division Two season || 4th ||\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 1975 New National League season || 6th ||\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 1976 National League season || 3rd ||\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 1977 National League season || 16th ||\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 1978 National League season || 14th ||\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 1979 National League season || 15th ||\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 1980 National League season || 20th ||\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 1981 National League season || 19th ||\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 1987 National League season || N/A || withdrew, results expunged\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 1999 Premier League speedway season || 11th ||\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 2000 Premier League speedway season || 5th ||\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 2001 Premier League speedway season || 6th ||\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 2002 Premier League speedway season || 15th ||\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 2003 Premier League speedway season || 9th ||\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 2004 Premier League speedway season || 2nd ||\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 2005 Premier League speedway season || 7th ||\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 2006 Premier League speedway season ||7th ||\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 2007 Premier League speedway season ||7th ||\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 2008 Premier League speedway season || 5th ||Young Shield, Premier League Pairs & Fours\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 2009 Premier League speedway season || 7th ||Young Shield\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 2010 Premier League speedway season || 6th || Young Shield\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 2011 Premier League speedway season || 4th ||\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 2012 Premier League speedway season || 4th ||\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 2013 Premier League speedway season || 5th ||\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 2014 Premier League speedway season || 6th ||\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 2015 Premier League speedway season || 8th ||\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 2016 Premier League speedway season || 7th ||\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| SGB Championship 2017 || 8th ||\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| SGB Championship 2018 || 3rd || Champions (won PO) & Knockout Cup winners\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| SGB Championship 2024 || 4th ||\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| SGB Championship 2025 || 7th ||\n|}\nHonours\nSGB Championship\n*Winners: 2018\nSGB Championship Knockout Cup\n*Winners: 2018\nSGB Championship Shield\n*Winners: 2018\nYoung Shield\n*Winners: 2008, 2009, 2010\nPremier League Four-Team Championship\nWinners: 2001, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2009\nPremier League Riders Championship\n*2000 Carl Stonehewer\n*2001 Carl Stonehewer\n*2007 James Wright\nPremier League Pairs Championship\n*1999 Carl Stonehewer with Brent Werner\n*2000 Carl Stonehewer with Mick Powell\n*2001 Carl Stonehewer with Peter I.
