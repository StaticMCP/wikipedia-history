This functionality could be extended to driving assistant.\n# Tracking: shows where the tracked object have been. (This functionality relies past positioning data to be stored, so not just the \"software\" technically).\nAdditional functions that extends the capabilities of satellite navigation software includes:\n# Searching: finds locations with addresses or GNSS coordinates (latitude and longitude).\n# Traffic updates: shows real-time traffic information, enabling the software to suggest a better route during driving.\n# Offline map: allows regions of map to be pre-downloaded, enabling usage with minimal connectivity.\n# Bookmarking: saves locations for later use.\nRequirement\nHardware-wise, a GNSS receiver is needed to interpret satellite signals and compute the user’s location. Nowadays, it is usually a single integrated circuit (IC).\nSatellite navigation software is most commonly used on mobile devices, particularly mobile phones, to provide the positioning functionality. However, relying exclusively on GNSS data is not accurate enough due to the limitations of GNSS services, To address this, Assisted GNSS (A-GNSS) is used instead. By leveraging data from nearby cellular towers, Wi-Fi,  and Bluetooth connections, A-GNSS enhances accuracy, reduces power consumption, lowers the risk of signal blockage, and effectively mitigates the limitations of GNSS.\nSoftware products\nThere are many navigation software products available. The primary distinction is whether it is designed for use on land, water or air. Below is a short-listed software products:\nLand-based\nFree and open source\n* OpenStreetMap (Cross-platform) open source and free\n* OsmAnd (Android) open source, and free\n* MoNav (Cross-platform) open source and free\n* Navit (Cross-platform) open source and free\nProprietary (available for free)\n* Apple Maps (iOS, macOS, watchOS)\n* Google Earth (Windows, Mac, Linux, with [https://earth.google.com/web/@0,0,0a,22251752.77375655d,35y,0h,0t,0r/data=CgRCAggBOgMKATBCAggASg0I____________ARAA website])\n* Google Maps (platform independent, with [https://www.google.com/maps website])\n* Magic Earth (Android, iOS, with [http://www.magicearth.com website])\n* Mapy.cz (Android, iOS, with [https://en.mapy.cz/ website]) - freemium\n* Waze (Android, iOS)\n* Windows Maps (Windows)\nCommercial\n* DeLorme Street Atlas USA and Topo USA\n* HERE\n* Rand McNally\n* Navigon\n* Navman\n* Magellan\n* Mireo\n* iGO\n* ROUTE 66\n* TomTom Navigator\n* TomTom Mobile\n* TeleType WorldNavigator\n* TPL Maps\n* OziExplorer\n* GPSS\nMarine navigation software\nNavigation software for use on the water has many features in common with land-based GNSS navigation software. It can use electronic navigation chart or raster charts, usually provides user ability to plan routes and set waypoints, and may have live GPS tracking capabilities. In addition, marine navigation software often has option to control external autopilot for automated boat navigation. It may incorporate GRIB weather overlay on the chart, Tide predictions and other related information services of additional use to mariners.\nFree and open source\n* OpenCPN (Cross-platform) open source and free\nAeronautical navigation software\nThis kind of software usually creates a modern glass cockpit and uses more than just a single GNSS sensor to assist the navigation. Such sensors are Attitude and Heading Reference Systems (AHRS) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors.\nSee also\n* Comparison of free off-line GPS software\n* Comparison of commercial GPS software\n* Comparison of web map services\n* Geopositioning\n* GPS software-defined receiver\n* Wayfinding software\nReferences"
