It was probably built to replaced High Mill, at the other end of the village. It was worked as a corn mill, and from the early 1900s it was run by J. Ross & Sons, who mostly produced animal feed. It was powered by water until 1967, when it was converted into a garage and office. The building was Grade II listed in 1986.\nThe mill is built of stone and rubble, with sandstone and limestone quoins, paired gutter brackets, and a Westmorland slate roof with gable copings. There are fronts of one and three bays, and on the right return is a two-storey lean-to range. In the left return is a sluice for the mill race. Inside, most the machinery survives, including the breastshot wheel, gearing, cogs, and grindstones.\nSee also\n*Listed buildings in Markington with Wallerthwaite\nReferences"
