Fight hordes of other warriors to claim your spot in becoming the almighty giant in the arena, unlock over 40 evolutions with their own unique style, trait, and design!\nHistory\n[This heading has started on production, please do not vandalize it.]\nOn March 3, 2018, Evowars.io was fully released to the public, there used to be 14 evolutions with little to no customization to the evolutions. This day also introduced only one gamemode which is free-for-all (FFA). FFA sends people into an arena in which people try to fight to become the mightiest person in the arena.\nRESOURCES:\n* Evowars.io was fully released on March 3, 2018\n* Evowars.io was a .io game that introduced a unique mechanic to the game, which is the XP system.\nGameplay\n[This heading has one issue, mainly, the image is small, people cannot see it, and it is outdated.]\nThere are five total game modes as of June 4, 2025 in computer, that you can pick five modes, in which, they are called: Classic or FFA, Teams, Offline, Event Mode, and Duels. The mobile version of Evowars.io has four game modes, which are Deathmatch or FFA, Teams, Duels, and Classic Mode.\nWhen you enter the game and picked your mode, the first that you should do is to move, in mobile, your finger should be in the screen so that it can follow the direction that the finger is going. In computer, laptop, or PC, the mouse controls the character.\nTo attack other players or destroy barrels, simply click the screen if your device is a phone or tablet. For laptop, PC, or computer users, simply click with your mouse once to attack. Power orbs are the key to beginning your journey, they range from big to small and the bigger it is, the more [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/video-games-how-do-experience-points-xp-work-shubham-bhopale#:~:text=XP%2C%20short%20for%20experience%20points,quests%2C%20or%20exploring%20new%20areas. XP] you get, in the early game, it is important to get these orbs because you easily level up and they are everywhere.  The most XP that you can possibly get is by killing other warriors, they range from a small boost to a huge advantage. When you level up higher, the weapon, model, and the cooldown changes depending on what level you are.\nAnother feature that is important is the sprint button, the sprint button is a button which makes you fast but you slowly lose XP in order to get to the next level. To sprint, there is a button in which you can click in mobile devices, while in computer or PC, click the left part of the mouse. In laptop with touchpads, click the \"Shift\" button in order to sprint. This button is important and reliable because you can avoid certain hits from other players and you can possibly fight them back.\nStrategies\nThere are some strategies that can make you a better player inside of the game, all of the techniques require knowledge on hitboxes which is very crucial on a game that involves around this.\nKamikaze\nKamikaze is one of the strategies that require good knowledge about hitboxes from evolutions and swords that are introduced. Kamikazing is also one of the hardest techniques to learn because smaller and faster evolutions can boost at precisely at the right moment and kill larger players. This is one of the effective ways to earn a lot of points in one go as the higher evolution a player is, the slower their sword can swing again and the more points you receive. However, it is very hard to do this technique and unless they aren't a great player or you took them by surprise, can easily sprint away or kill you almost instantly. Make sure to stay cool and focused to avoid getting killed by kamikazes.\nSprinter\nSprinter is a strategy that requires decent connection from your WiFi. This strategy is one of the most popular methods to get in to the leaderboards. The sprinter starts collecting orbs at the start to level up faster and become bigger, then, they will eventually start killing smaller players that below their levels, after that, the sprinter will stop sprinting at level 17 - 19 due to losing experience points which are crucial to the main game. You can reduce this by equipping higher level mounts, maxed out mounts can reduce 10% of XP every time you boost to a mere 5%, extending the recommended 17 - 19 levels to 20 - 21. For evolutions that are above 21+, it is therefore advisable to use your boosts warily and sparingly. It is also advisable to start playing defensively because playing the sprinter role in higher levels are not advisable and can possibly ruin your chance at winning.\nPeaceful\nPeaceful is one of the easiest strategies to master. The peaceful starts at focusing on collecting orbs, they can give a lot of XP for early levels. The peaceful should be atleast around top ~10 to 20, then will start attacking warriors that are weaker and smaller. The peaceful is also one of the easiest to kill due to them only focusing on collecting orbs in the early game, but in the mid game, they will start becoming powerful if anyone ignores the peaceful. If done correctly, you might be able to start attacking other warriors, or kill stronger people if their movement feels wrong and janky.\nFacts\n* One of the removed features that Evowars: New Era did was adding a \"premium\" feature, players who had premium could access evolutions that were still in progress, some examples of these are the \"archangel\" in version 1.1, and \"butcher\" in version 1.3. This was eventually revamped to VIP due to people not wanting the game to be P2W (pay to win).\n* Purchasing the [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2368080/EvoWars_New_Era/ Steam] version of Evowars: New Era would get you gamepad support, enchanced graphics quality, ad-free gameplay, quick respawn after death, and more XP and gold.\n* Morbash, one of the warriors in Evowars.io, is inspired by the game called \"Elder Scrolls.\"\n* Reaper, one of the warriors in Evowars.io, was created by two games that Night Steed S. C. did, one was called \"Minigiants.io\" which inspired the model and the other was called \"Warcall.io\" which inspired the weapon and design for him.\n* \"Teams Mode\" was originally called \"Eternal Battle\" but was eventually renamed due to not fitting the game mode.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://evowars.io Official website for the game]\n* [https://nightsteed.com Night Steed S.
