She is widely memorialised in statuary, throughout the former British Empire, and elsewhere. This statue is carved from stone and stands atop a substantial plinth.\nThe artist\nGeorge Blackall Simonds (1843–1929) was a Reading sculptor and director of H & G Simonds Brewery. He exhibited consistently at the Royal Academy. Simonds studied under Johannes Schilling in Dresden, and Louis Jehotte at The Royal Academy of Brussels. He created over 200 pieces in many different media.\nWhile The Falconer (1873) is in Central Park, New York, much of his larger work is to be found in or near Reading.  Substantial pieces were also commissioned for Allahabad and Calcutta in India.\nThe Maiwand Lion (1886) in the Forbury Gardens is his, the Statue of George Palmer and that of Henry Bilson Blandy, Mayor of Reading 1871–1873. In 1922 he designed the war memorial at Bradfield, Berkshire, which commemorates the deaths in the First World War of those of the 2nd Battalion, South Wales Borderers, including his son.\nReferences\nExternal links"
