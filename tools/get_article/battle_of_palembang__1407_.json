It happened in 1407. The battle resulted in the defeat of Chen Zuyi, who was captured and sent to China for execution.\nBackground\nChen Zuyi was a pirate leader who had seized Palembang on Sumatra. He dominated the maritime route of the Malaccan Strait. The chronicler Ma Huan wrote that Shi Jinqing informed Admiral Zheng He about Chen Zuyi's depredations. The Haiquo Quangji by Shen Moushang states that Shi Jinqing secretly reported Chen Zuyi's plans to attack Zheng He to him.\nCourse\nIn 1407, while returning homewards from their voyage, Ming China's treasure fleet led by Admiral Zheng He engaged the pirate fleet led by Chen Zuyi in battle at Palembang. The Chinese fleet defeated Chen's pirate fleet in this encounter. During the confrontation, 5,000 pirates were killed, ten pirate ships were destroyed, and seven pirate ships were captured.\nThe Mingshi records that Zheng was initially sent to Palembang to negotiate the pacification of Chen and others, but it also states that Chen and the others plotted to attack Ming China's forces. The Taizong Shilu records that Chen tried to evade and withdraw from active engagement with Ming China's treasure fleet. Dreyer (2007) characterizes the much-later account of Chen in the Mingshi as a disparaging attempt to portray him as an evil pirate and thereby contrast him from the Chinese merchants of Palembang who submitted.\nMing China's treasure fleet took three prisoners, including Chen, back to the Chinese capital Nanjing for decapitation.\nAftermath\nOn 2 October 1407, Chen Zuyi and his lieutenants were executed. On 29 October 1407, the Yongle Emperor of Ming China issued an order to reward the officers and other crew members who went to battle against Chen's pirate fleet at Palembang.\nMing China's imperial court appointed Shi Jinqing as the Pacification Superintendent of Old Port, which established an ally at Palembang and secured access to this important port.\nSee also\n* Ming–Kotte War\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
