It was produced by Pompano Puff and J Gramm.\nBackground and composition\nThe cover art of the song shows Kodak Black holding hands with his girlfriend as a heart of smoke explodes in the sky, with soldiers at war behind them.\nThe chorus of the song previously leaked in 2019, following which it went viral on the video-sharing app TikTok and was also used for Black's feature on the song \"On the Low\" by Shoreline Mafia in 2020. Lyrically, the song finds Kodak expressing his feelings toward a girl, saying she wants \"love\" but he wants \"war\". The production of the song contains xylophone.\nCritical reception\nPreezy Brown of Vibe regarded the song as among the \"standouts\" that \"help close out Back For Everything on a high note\". On the other hand, Jayson Buford of HipHopDX wrote, \"'Love & War,' the last record, is abominable. With his xylophone production, it's a SoundCloud snippet that should've stayed there.\"\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Chart performance for \"Love & War\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2022)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|}\nCertifications\nReferences"
