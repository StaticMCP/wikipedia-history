Wormley (December 31, 1907 – November 3, 1995) was an American designer of modern furniture. His furniture represented a convergence of historical design and 20th-century innovation that still has appeal among contemporary collectors.\nEarly life\nWormley was born in Oswego, Illinois. After contracting polio in early childhood, which temporarily impaired his mobility until age five and resulted in a permanent limp, his family relocated to Rochelle, Illinois. There, at twelve years of age, he met Edward C. Crouse, who would become his lifelong partner. The two became close friends, and as teenagers, they entered into a sexual relationship.\nIn 1925, when Edward C. Crouse left for college, he and Wormley maintained frequent and heartfelt correspondence. Addressing each other affectionately as “dear heart,\" discussing \"passionate encounters\" and planning their future life, Crouse penned, \"We'll have to wait, though, until we're (heavens, I almost wrote 'married'!) living together.\" Around Christmas that year, the young couple revealed their relationship to their families.\nDesign career\nIn 1926, Wormley briefly studied at the Art Institute of Chicago but had to leave after three terms due to financial issues. He began work as an interior designer for Marshall Field's. During the Depression, Wormley was introduced to the president of the Dunbar Furniture Company in Berne, Indiana, who hired him to upgrade their product line.\nWormley and Crouse continued their frequent correspondence through the 1930s and early 1940s. The relationship was a rocky one: Wormley was frequently insecure, and Crouse struggled with his sexuality, often expressing disgust and despair, and spent periods \"trying to be regular.\" Despite this, they shared a deep affection, went on long vacations together, and talked freely about their sexual experiences with other men, demonstrating that their relationship was still the most significant thing. By 1941, the two men were referring to each other as \"husband\" (Crouse) and \"wife\" (Wormley).\nIn 1942, Wormley was the head of the furniture unit of the wartime Office of Price Administration. After leaving in 1944, he founded Edward Wormley and Associates, a design firm with Dunbar as its major client. In 1944, Dunbar decided to focus strictly on modern lines, and Wormley began incorporating European and Scandinavian innovations into his work. His eye for quality and the exacting craftsmanship at Dunbar made for furniture that was elegant, understated, and exceptionally well-made. Wormley was never really at the forefront of modern design. Instead, he took the best elements from classical and historical designs, then translated them into modern vernacular. The result was furniture that was sophisticated yet mainstream and very successful.\nWormley and Crouse bought a house together in Weston, Connecticut, in 1947 and remained there for the rest of their lives.\nGood Design exhibitions\nWormley's inclusion in the Good Design exhibit series staged by the Museum of Modern Art and the Merchandise Mart between 1950 and 1955 allowed him to gain recognition by including his work alongside designers like Bertoia, Nelson, and Eames.\nIn 1950, three of Edward Wormley’s works were on display at the Good Design exhibit: an adjustable upholstered wood armchair, a “Short John” coffee table with laminated wood legs, and a “Repartee” gray carpet. By the end of the Good Design exhibitions in 1955, thirty Wormley pieces had been awarded the Good Design designation.\nWormley's tables\nWormley's tile-topped tables, created as part of the Janus line in 1957 for the Dunbar Furniture Company, were a partnership between the modern production design aesthetic and the tile traditions of Tiffany and Otto Natzler. Dining tables, stacking tables, and other styles of tables manufactured by Dunbar were also popular at auction.\nRetirement and death\nWormley retired in 1967, alongside Crouse, who had joined him in his design work. The couple frequently traveled together until Crouse's death from cancer in 1975. Wormley lived until 1995, when he died due to two heart attacks. He was buried with his parents in Oswego, Illinois.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Marie FERRAN-WABBES, Wormley - Dunbar. Edward J Wormley (1907 - 1995).
