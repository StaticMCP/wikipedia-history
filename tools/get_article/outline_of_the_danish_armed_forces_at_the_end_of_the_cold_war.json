      "text": "# Outline of the Danish Armed Forces at the end of the Cold War\n\nThe following is a hierarchical outline for the Danish armed forces at the end of the Cold War. It is intended to convey the connections and relationships between units and formations. In wartime all Danish military units would have come under the joint West German/Danish NATO command Allied Forces Baltic Approaches (BALTAP). BALTAP was a principal subordinate command under the Allied Forces Northern Europe Command (AFNORTH). The commander-in-chief of (BALTAP) was always a Danish Lieutenant General or Vice Admiral, who had the designation Commander Allied Forces Baltic Approaches (COMBALTAP). In peacetime BALTAP had only a few communication units allocated and all other units remained under national command of West Germany's Bundeswehr and Denmark's Forsvaret.\nForsvaret\nForsvaret (Danish Defence) was the unified armed forces of the Kingdom of Denmark, charged with the defence of Denmark and its overseas territories of Greenland and the Faroe Islands. Forsvaret had four service branches:\n* Royal Danish Army\n* Royal Danish Navy\n* Royal Danish Air Force\n* Danish Home Guard\nThe Forsvaret headquarters also had operational control of the following entities:\n* Danish Defence Intelligence Service\n** Dueodde SIGINT station, on Bornholm\n* Royal Danish Defence College\n* Judge Advocate Corps\n* Lyngby Radio\nRoyal Danish Army\nThe Royal Danish Army Command was based in Karup and tasked to train, maintain and prepare the army for war. However operational control in peacetime rested with the Western and the Eastern Regional Command. In wartime the former would have transferred its units to LANDJUT, while the latter would have become the LANDZEALAND command.\n*  Royal Danish Army, Karup\n** Jaegerkorpset, at Aalborg Air Base, (Long range reconnaissance and special operations)\n** Army Material Command, Hjørring\n*** Army Depot Service\n*** Army Maintenance Service\n*** Army Ammunition Arsenal\nWestern Regional Command\n}}\nduring an exercise in 1984]]\nThe Western Regional Command was based in Aarhus and commanded by a major general. In case of war it would have transferred command of all its units to NATO's Commander, Allied Land Forces Schleswig-Holstein and Jutland (LANDJUT). The command was responsible for the South Jutland, Ribe, Vejle, Ringkjøbing, Viborg, North Jutland and Aarhus counties, which together form the Danish part of the Jutland peninsula, and also for the island of Funen, which with the surrounding islands formed the Funen County.\n* Western Regional Command, Aarhus\n** Jutland Division, Fredericia\n*** 3rd Signal Battalion\n*** 1st Jutland Brigade, Fredericia\n**** 1st Brigade Staff Company (5 × M113, 8 × TOW on Land Rover)\n**** 1st Battalion, Jydske Dragonregiment, (20 × Leopard 1A3, 21 × M113 (including 4 with TOW), 4 × M125 mortar carriers, 2 × TOW on Land Rover)\n**** 1st Battalion, Kongens Jyske Fodregiment, (10 × Leopard 1A3, 32 × M113 (including 4 with TOW), 4 × M125, 4 × TOW on Land Rover)\n**** 1st Battalion, Fynske Livregiment, (10 × Leopard 1A3, 32 × M113 (including 4 with TOW), 4 × M125, 4 × TOW on Land Rover)\n**** 2nd Battalion, Kongens Jyske Fodregiment, (Light Infantry)\n**** 6th Artillery Battalion, Nørrejyske Artilleriregiment, (12 × M109A3 howitzer, 8 × M114/39 155&nbsp;mm howitzer, 15 × M113)\n**** 1st Armoured Engineer Company (6 × M113)\n**** 1st Logistic Battalion\n**** 1st Military Police Detachment\n*** 2nd Jutland Brigade, Skive\n**** 2nd Brigade Staff Company (5 × M113, 8 × TOW on Land Rover)\n**** 2nd Battalion, Jydske Dragonregiment, (20 × Leopard 1A3, 21 × M113 (including 4 with TOW), 2 × M125)\n**** 1st Battalion, Dronningens Livregiment, (10 × Leopard 1A3, 32 × M113 (including 4 with TOW), 4 × M125, 4 × TOW on Land Rover)\n**** 2nd Battalion, Dronningens Livregiment, (10 × Leopard 1A3, 32 × M113 (including 4 with TOW), 4 × M125, 4 × TOW on Land Rover)\n**** 3rd Battalion, Dronningens Livregiment, (Light Infantry)\n**** 3rd Artillery Battalion, Nørrejyske Artilleriregiment, (12 × M109A3 howitzer, 8 × M114/39 155&nbsp;mm howitzer)\n**** 2nd Armoured Engineer Company\n**** 3rd Logistic Battalion\n**** 2nd Military Police Detachment\n*** 3rd Jutland Brigade, Haderslev\n**** 3rd Brigade Staff Company (5 × M113, 8 × TOW on Land Rover)\n**** 3rd Battalion, Jydske Dragonregiment, (20 × Leopard 1A3, 21 × M113 (including 4 with TOW), 2 × M125)\n**** 1st Battalion, Prinsens Livregiment, (10 × Leopard 1A3, 32 × M113 (including 4 with TOW), 4 × M125, 4 × TOW on Land Rover)\n**** 2nd Battalion, Prinsens Livregiment, (10 × Leopard 1A3, 32 × M113 (including 4 with TOW), 4 × M125, 4 × TOW on Land Rover)\n**** 3rd Battalion, Prinsens Livregiment, (Light Infantry)\n**** 7th Artillery Battalion, Sønderjyske Artilleriregiment, (12 × M109A3 howitzer, 8 × M114/39 howitzer)\n**** 3rd Armoured Engineer Company\n**** 7th Logistic Battalion\n**** 3rd Military Police Detachment\n*** Divisional Artillery Regiment, Skive\n**** Staff and Target Acquisition Battery\n**** 23rd Artillery Battalion, (18 × M114/39 155&nbsp;mm howitzer)\n**** 24th Artillery Battalion, (18 × M114/39 155&nbsp;mm howitzer)\n**** 18th Heavy Battery, (4 × M115 203&nbsp;mm howitzer)\n**** 19th Heavy Battery, (4 × M115 203&nbsp;mm howitzer)\n*** 4th Battalion, Fynske Livregiment, (Light Infantry)\n*** 5th Battalion, Jydske Dragonregiment, (Reconnaissance: 18 × M41 DK-1, 9 × M113, 9 × M125)\n*** 6th Battalion, Jydske Dragonregiment, (Tank destroyer Battalion: 50 × Centurion Mk V (84&nbsp;mm gun))\n*** 33rd Artillery Battalion, Skive, Nørrejyske Artilleriregiment (18 × M59 155&nbsp;mm gun, would have joined LANDJUT's Corps Artillery)\n*** 14th Air Defence Battalion, (Stinger, Bofors 40&nbsp;mm L/70)\n*** 3rd Engineer Battalion\n*** 8th Logistic Battalion\n*** Long Range Reconnaissance Company, Dronningens Livregiment\n*** Electronic Warfare Company\n*** Heavy Transport Company\n*** 1st Military Police Company\nWestern Regional Command reserve units:\n* Jutland Battle Group, Holstebro\n** 7th Staff Company\n** 4th Btn, Jydske Dragonregiment, (Armored)\n** 1st Btn, Slesvigske Fodregiment, (Light Infantry)\n** 2nd Btn, Slesvigske Fodregiment, (Light Infantry)\n** 3rd Btn, Slesvigske Fodregiment, (Light Infantry)\n** 8th Artillery Btn, Nørrejyske Artilleriregiment, (6 × M114/39 155&nbsp;mm howitzer, 12 × M101 105&nbsp;mm howitzer)\n** 7th Engineer Company\n** 5th Logistic Battalion\n** 7th Military Police Detachment\n* 4th Artillery Battalion, Skive, Nørrejyske Artilleriregiment (24 × M101 105&nbsp;mm howitzer, would have joined LANDJUT's Corps Artillery)\n* 10th Artillery Battalion, Varde, Sønderjyske Artilleriregiment  (24 × M101 105&nbsp;mm howitzer, would have joined LANDJUT's Corps Artillery)\n* 11th Artillery Battalion, Varde, Sønderjyske Artilleriregiment  (24 × M101 105&nbsp;mm howitzer, would have joined LANDJUT's Corps Artillery)\n* 5th Signal Battalion\n* 5th Engineer Battalion\n* Host and Support Battalion (Supporting arrival of NATO reinforcements in Jutland and northern Germany)\n* Rear and Sustainment Battalion\n* Logistics Support Group West (LSG-W)\n** Supply Battalion\n** Transport Battalion\n** Medical Battalion (incl.

Furthermore, agreements signed after World War II forbade the stationing on Bornholm or reinforcing of Bornholm, by foreign troops. Therefore, the island was only guarded by one Battle Group with a single active light infantry battalion. However, during the transition to war this Battle Group would have been augmented and reinforced by local reservists.\n* Bornholms Værn's Battle Group\n** Staff and Signal Company\n** 1st Battalion, Bornholms Værn (infantry) (4 × TOW on Land Rover)\n** 2nd Battalion, Bornholms Værn (infantry) (reserve) (4 × TOW on Land Rover)\n** 3rd Battalion, Bornholms Værn (infantry) (reserve) (12 x 106&nbsp;mm RR on Jeep M38)\n** Light Tank Squadron, \"Bornholm Dragoons\" (10 × M41 DK-1)\n** Light Reconnaissance Squadron (6 × M41 DK-1)\n** 12th Artillery Battalion (18 × M101)\n** Air Defence Battery (Stinger)\n** Motorized Engineer Company\n** Maintenance & Logistic Company\nRoyal Danish Army Aircraft Inventory 1989\nThe inventory of the Royal Danish Army in 1989 consisted of the following aircraft:\n* 14 × Hughes 500M, observation\n* 12 × AS350 L1 Écureuil, armed with TOW anti-tank missiles\n* 8 × T-17 Supporter, liaison and observation\nRoyal Danish Air Force\n}}\ntaxiing into takeoff position during Exercise OKSBOEL '86 at Karup Air Base.]]\nThe Royal Danish Air Force Command was headquartered at Karup Air Base and tasked to train, maintain and prepare the army for war. However operational control in peacetime rested with the Tactical Air Command. In wartime the air force's commander would have become the commander of Allied Air Forces Baltic Approaches (AIRBALTAP). AIRBALTAP commanded all flying units, flying reinforcements, all ground-based radar systems and stations, all air defence units and airfields in its sector. In war the entire Royal Danish Air Force would have come under AIRBALTAP.\nIn 1989 the Royal Danish Air Force consisted of the following units:\n* Royal Danish Air Force, in Karup, commanded by a Danish lieutenant general\n** Flyveskolen (Basic Flying School), Avnø Air Base, T-17 Supporter\n** Air Force Materiel Command, Karup\n*** Air Force Depot Service\n*** Air Force Maintenance Service\n*** Air Force Ammunition Arsenal\n** Tactical Air Command, Karup\n*** Aalborg Air Base\n**** Eskadrille 723, F-16A\n**** Eskadrille 726, F-16A\n*** Karup Air Base\n**** Eskadrille 725, F-35 Draken, TF-35 Draken\n**** Eskadrille 729, Reconnaissance, RF-35 Draken, TF-35 Draken\n*** Tirstrup Air Base\n**** Co-located Operating Base to be reinforced by U.S. Air Force / Royal Air Force squadrons\n*** Vandel Air Base\n**** Co-located Operating Base to be reinforced by U.S. Air Force / Royal Air Force squadrons\n*** Skrydstrup Air Base\n**** Eskadrille 727, F-16A\n**** Eskadrille 730, F-16A\n*** Værløse Air Base\n**** Eskadrille 721, Transport, C-130H Hercules, Gulfstream III\n**** Eskadrille 722, Search and rescue, S-61A helicopters\n** Air Defence Command East, Skalstrup Air Station\n*** Eskadrille 541, Stevns Fort, with 1 × I-Hawk battery (6 × launchers)\n*** Eskadrille 542, Kongelund Fort near Aflangshagen Air Station, with 1 × I-Hawk battery (6 × launchers)\n*** Eskadrille 543, Sigerslev Air Station, with 1 × I-Hawk battery (6 × launchers)\n*** Eskadrille 544, Tune near Skalstrup Air Station, with 1 × I-Hawk battery (6 × launchers)\n** Air Defence Command West, Karup\n*** Eskadrille 531, Odense, with 1 × I-Hawk battery (6 × launchers)\n*** Eskadrille 532, Odense, with 1 × I-Hawk battery (6 × launchers)\n*** Eskadrille 533, Skrydstrup Air Base, with 1 × I-Hawk battery (6 × launchers)\n*** Eskadrille 534, Karup Air Base, with 1 × I-Hawk battery (6 × launchers)\nRoyal Danish Air Force Inventory 1989\nThe inventory of the RDAF in 1989 consisted of the following aircraft:\n* 70 × F-16A/B Falcon, fighter (last 12 × delivered in 1989)\n* 16 × F-35 Draken, fighter\n* 18 × RF-35 Draken, reconnaissance\n* 9 × TF-35 Draken, training\n* 3 × C-130H Hercules, transport\n* 3 × Gulfstream III, VIP\n* 8 × S-61A Search and Rescue helicopters\n* 20 × T-17 Supporter, training and liaison\nRoyal Danish Navy\n}}\nThe Royal Danish Navy Command was based in Aarhus and tasked to train, maintain and prepare the navy for war. However operational command in peacetime rested with the Navy Operational Command. In war, the commander of the Royal Danish Navy would have come as \"Flag Officer Denmark (FOD)\" under the command of Allied Naval Forces Baltic Approaches (NAVBALTAP), which was commanded alternatingly by a Danish or German vice admiral. However Danish ships and units based in Greenland and the Faroe Islands would have come under command of NATO's Command Eastern Atlantic Area (EASTLANT), who would also have taken command of Island Command Greenland and Island Command Faroes.\nTogether with German Fleet under the Flag Officer Germany (FOG) the Royal Danish Navy would have tried to keep the Warsaw Pact's United Baltic Sea Fleets, consisting of the Soviet Baltic Fleet, Polish Navy and East German Volksmarine bottled up in the Baltic Sea by blocking the Danish straits and thus ensuring NATOs unchallenged control of the North Sea.  Additionally, NAVBALTAP was to prevent amphibious landings on the Danish coast. To fulfill its mission the navy fielded a large number of minelayers and fast attack crafts. The first would have been used to mine all sea lanes and potential landings beaches, while the latter would have harassed the enemy fleet with continuous hit and run attacks.\nAt the beginning of 1989 the Royal Danish Navy consisted of the following ships.\n* Royal Danish Navy, in Aarhus, commanded by a vice admiral\n** Navy Materiel Command, Aarhus\n*** Navy Depot Service\n*** Navy Maintenance Service\n*** Navy Ammunition Arsenal\n** Frogman Corps, at Torpedo Station Kongsøre\n** Sirius Dog Sled Patrol, Daneborg, Greenland\n** Navy Operational Command, Aarhus\n*** Kattegat Marine District, Frederikshavn (Maritime Surveillance Center and tactical control of sea units)\n*** Bornholm Marine District, Rytterknægten (Maritime Surveillance Center and tactical control of sea units)\n**** Frigate Squadron\n***** Peder Skram-class frigates: F352 Peder Skram, F353 Herluf Trolle\n***** Niels Juel-class corvettes: F354 Niels Juel, F355 Olfert Fischer, F356 Peter Tordenskiold\n***** Daphne-class seaward defence vessels (in the process of being replaced by Flyvefisken-class patrol vessels): P530 Daphne, P531 Dryaden, P533 Havfruen, P534 Najaden, P535 Nymfen, P536 Neptun (decommissioned 30 October 30, 1989), P537 Ran, P538 Rota (decommissioned 31 October 1989)\n*****  Oiler: A559 Sleipner\n**** Torpedo Boat Squadron\n***** Søløven-class fast torpedo boats (in the process of being replaced by Flyvefisken-class patrol vessels): P510 Søløven, P511 Søridderen, P512 Søbjørnen, P513 Søhesten, P514 Søhunden, P515 Søulven\n***** Willemoes-class fast missile boats: P540 Bille, P541 Bredal, P542 Hammer, P543 Huitfeldt, P544 Krieger, P545 Norby, P546 Rodsteen, P547 Sehested, P548 Suenson, P549 Willemoes\n***** Flyvefisken-class patrol vessel: P550 Flyvefisken (commissioned 19 December 1989)\n***** Oilers: A568 Rimfaxe, A569 Skinfaxe\n***** Land-based Mobile Base (MOBA) with approximately 40 trucks, which supplied fuel, ordnance, and freshwater, and provided repair facilities outside the naval bases to the torpedo boats.

The task of the Home Guard was to support the armed forces. The Home Guard Command was based in Copenhagen and administered the home guard during peacetime. In case of war the home guard units would have reinforced the other three armed services.\nArmy Home Guard\nThe Army Home Guard was commanded by a major general. Home guard units were tasked to secure and guard key infrastructure, and report and delay enemy infiltrations by air or sea in their area of operation.
