It was written by Onuzo, who previously worked on films such as The Wedding Party, New Money, Up North and The Set Up. The film explores the themes of love, family and ambition. Oboli announced on Instagram that filming for the movie commenced in May 2019. She also revealed that Richard Mofe-Damijo had joined the cast. In an interview with Pulse Nigeria in September 2019, Mofe-Damijo said he accepted his role because he loved the precedent upon which the film is set. He also said his political affiliation in real life helped him portray the role better. Moreover, Mofe-Damijo revealed that shooting was tedious due to the filming of night scenes.\nRelease\nLove is War premiered at the Filmhouse Cinemas in Lekki on 22 September 2019. It was released across cinemas in Nigeria on 27 September. A teaser of the film was released a month earlier. Guests who attended the premiere include Ayo Makun, Funke Akindele, Toke Makinwa, Sharon Ooja, Alex Ekubo, Inidima Okojie, Mercy Aigbe, Tope Oshin and Sophie Alakija, among others.\nReferences"
