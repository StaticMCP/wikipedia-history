Digges was an intimate friend of George and Martha Washington, who visited the house many times. George Washington spent his forty-third birthday at Warburton Manor. Warburton Manor occupied a strategic site on the Potomac River and today it is the site of Fort Washington, designed by Pierre Charles L'Enfant in 1814.\nSee also\n*Province of Maryland\nNotes\n*Toogood, Anna, Warburton Manor and the Digges family of Maryland, Division of History, U.S. Office of Archeology and Historic Preservation (1970)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=3663 Historical Marker] Retrieved 17 July 2018"
