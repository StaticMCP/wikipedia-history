The peak body for the sport is Mountain Bike Australia (MTBA). According to AusCycling officials, more people in the country, participate in mountain biking than rugby league and rugby union combined, and is more popular than fishing as a recreational activity. Mountain biking has prompted regional towns to invest heavily in new trails to meet increasing demand for the sport, with local governments viewing mountain biking as a significant driver of tourism revenue.\nFacilities\nAustralian Capital Territory\n's downhill track, during the 2009 UCI World Mountain Bike Championships.]]\nMount Stromlo Forest Park has international standard tracks including a downhill track, 60 kilometres of cross-country, four-cross track, and a dedicated mountain bike trials course. There is also a testing track known as \"the playground\" for training and testing demonstration bikes.\n* Sparrow Hill, part of Kowen Pine Forest, 11&nbsp;km from Queanbeyan on the Kings Highway, and 25 minutes from Canberra CBD, has 50&nbsp;km of world-class cross-country tracks renowned for being fast and flowing, popular with beginner and elite alike. All tracks are named and maintained, and clear signage offers numerous routes of varying length.\nNew South Wales\n* Manly Dam, Sydney\n* Thredbo\n* Oaks Fire Trail, Blue Mountains\n* Hunter Valley\nTasmania\nTasmania has a strong mountain biking culture with a large network of tracks around the state including the world class Blue Derby which hosted the  in 2017. Hollybank, Wellington Park and Trevallyn are other popular mountain biking areas.\nVictoria\nSince the early 2000s, investment in mountain biking facilities has produced a number of areas of high quality trails. The 2006 Commonwealth Games in particular caused the creation of the Lysterfield Park mountain bike network, including the 6.4 kilometre race circuit. Nearly 60 mountain biking clubs are registered with Mountain Bike Australia. The trail network at Mount Buller is one of only three \"IMBA Ride Centers\" outside the US designated by the International Mountain Biking Association.\nParks Victoria and the Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) have assisted with the creation of trail networks in recent years, such as at Forrest and Lysterfield Park. In 2012, Parks supported the creation of a downhill trail in Kinglake National Park, the first mountain bike trail in a Victorian national park. The trail, Shepherds, follows an existing powerline easement to minimise environmental damage.\nFrom the mid-2000s, a large number of tracks began to be constructed, with support from government agencies, local councils and tourism bodies. Reasons for the growth included the need to replace shrinking or displaced industries (as with the timber industry at Forrest), the need to supplement short ski seasons (as at all the ski resorts except Mount Hotham), the desire to attract more visitors to the national parks (as with Kinglake) and the need for facilities to support a growing sport (as with Lysterfield Park).\nFormal trail networks:\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n!
