The 150th episode overall, the episode was directed by Laura Belsey, and written by Jim Barnes and Erik Mountain. \"One More\" was released on the streaming platform AMC+ on March 12, 2021, and aired on television on AMC two days later, on March 14, 2021.\nIn the episode, with a map from Maggie, Aaron (Ross Marquand) and Gabriel (Seth Gilliam) search for food and supplies to bring back to Alexandria. Checking out one more location, they chance upon a stash. Faith is broken and optimism is fragmented when they are put to the ultimate test.\nThe episode was overwhelmingly praised by critics, particularly the performances and Laura Belsey's direction.\nPlot\nWith a map of potential supply sources that Maggie created, Aaron and Gabriel are on a supply run. On their way, the two slay walkers in a field, but are unsuccessful in their search and discuss how much they miss their daughters. Later, Gabriel falls into mud and destroys the map, but still wants to visit the final location, a water tower. Aaron, however, believes it's pointless and wants to return to Alexandria.\nLater, the men find a seemingly abandoned warehouse. There, Aaron kills a wild boar that was about to attack him. They then cook and eat the animal, and also find a bottle of whiskey that they drink while playing cards. The next day, Gabriel wakes up and discovers that Aaron has disappeared before an armed man suddenly appears, revealing that he lives in the warehouse. The man tells Gabriel that he is angry at them for killing his boar and drinking his whiskey. Gabriel tries to convince him that they are good people, but he doesn't believe him. The man then retrieves Aaron and forces the two to play Russian roulette, and the two of them ask the man why he is forcing them to do this. and he replies \"enlightenment.\" He gives them the option of pointing the gun at the other player instead of themselves each round, expecting that they will opt to kill the other to spare their own life. Instead, neither of them point the gun at the other. When Aaron calls Gabriel family, the man snaps and says that several years beforehand, his brother stole his food and tried to kill him, forcing him to \"handle the situation\", presumably killing him. This betrayal from his own brother led the man to believe that all people are selfish and evil, and he is now trying to prove that all mankind is selfish. Eventually they manage to convince the man that not all people are bad, and the man reveals that his name is Mays. Gabriel takes advantage of Mays' lowered guard by smashing his head with the mace attachment on Aaron's prosthetic arm, killing him instantly, feeling that Mays is too dangerous to risk taking home with them. When Gabriel says that they're now all good, Aaron replies \"are we?\"\nAfterwards, Aaron and Gabriel discover a room upstairs stocked with supplies. They find Mays' brother in handcuffs, revealing that Mays had kept him alive as a prisoner for years, with the corpses of his wife and daughter at his feet, bullet holes in their skulls. Gabriel frees the man, who grabs Gabriel's gun and commits suicide by shooting himself. Aaron and Gabriel then gather the Mays' supplies and leave. The two later cross a field and spot the water tower. Aaron says \"one more\", and they head off toward the water tower.\nProduction\nguest starred in this episode as Mays, a deranged and renegade survivor, who lost trust in people and lives in an apparently abandoned warehouse.
