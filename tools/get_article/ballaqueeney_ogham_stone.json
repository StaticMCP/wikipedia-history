It was discovered at Ballaqueeney (Ballaquine) Isle of Man in 1874 by Reverend F. B. Grant during the process of excavating dirt for use as railroad ballast.\nThe stone was kept in a garden in Ballaqueeney from its discovery until about 1885. This caused the stone surface to deteriorate, due to being exposed to wind and rain, with the result that two Ogham letters can no longer be read.\nMacalister noted that \"the grooves are finely cut with a V-shaped section\" and \"the scores forming the consonants for the most part are 2 inches in length...there are no traces of divisional points; but there are longer spaces between the words than between the letters\".\nThe stones are now located at the Manx Museum in Douglas where it has the catalogue number \"MM 2\".\nMacalister reads the Ogham inscription as  meaning \"[Stone] of Bivaidonas, son of the tribe of Cunavali\". F. J. Byrne suggests that the personal name Bivaidonas is related to the Conailli Muirtheimne of north Louth and south Down. D. McManus notes that the tribal name Cunavali could refer to either an Irish or a British tribe.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.gov.im/about-the-government/statutory-boards/manx-national-heritage/ Manx national heritage]\n* [http://www.gov.im/mnh/heritage/museums/manxmuseum.xml The Manx Museum in Douglas, Isle of Man]"
