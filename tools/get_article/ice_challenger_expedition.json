The expedition's six man team used a six-wheel drive vehicle to cover about 1,000 miles.\nNot to be confused with the Ice Challenger expedition to traverse the ice floes in the Bering Strait.\nExpedition details\nIn 2005 a team of six people took part in the Ice Challenger Expedition. Traveling in a specially designed six-wheel drive vehicle, the team completed the journey from the Antarctic coast at Patriot Hills to the geographic South Pole in 69 hours. In doing so they easily beat the previous record of 24 days. They arrived at the South Pole on 12 December 2005.\nThe team members on that expedition were Andrew Regan, Jason De Carteret, Andrew Moon, Richard Griffiths, Gunnar Egilsson, and Andrew Miles.\nThe expedition hoped to show that wheeled transport on the continent is not only possible but also more practical. It was also aimed at increasing awareness about global warming.\nFurther expeditions\nA second expedition led by Andrew Regan and Andrew Moon is departed in November 2010. The Moon-Regan Trans Antarctic Expedition traversed the entire continent, using 2 six wheel drive vehicles and a Bio-Inspired Ice Vehicle. The team used the expedition to raise awareness about the global environmental importance of the Antarctic region and to show that bio-fuel can be a viable and environmentally friendly option.\nSee also\n*South Pole Traverse\nReferences"
