It is  in size. It is located  in Roselle at the border with the neighboring cities of Elizabeth and Linden.\nHistory\nIn 1921, a group of local citizens alarmed by the rapid industrialization of the area created the Union County Park Commission by referendum vote of the people, to purchase and preserve remaining natural areas.\nIn 1923, the famous landscape design firm, the Olmsted Brothers (founded by their father Frederick Law Olmsted who designed New York's Central Park) completed its design plans for \"Elizabeth Park,\" now known as \"Warinanco.\"\nLenape namesake\nThis park was named in 1925 for an indigenous Lenape tribal leader of the region, whose name was recorded by English colonists as \"Warinanco\" in 1664. That year, a group called the Elizabethtown Associates bought the Elizabethtown Tract including land in today's Union County from Warinanco and another Lenape leader, Mattano.\nWarinanco's name is recorded elsewhere as \"Waerhinnis Couwee,\" \"Warrines\" and \"Wieronies.\" It is thought that Warinanco was a minor sachem, or tribal elder, of the Hackensack people (a band or subgroup among the Lenape).\nFeatures and landmarks\nAzalea Garden\nThe Caxton Brown Memorial Azalea Garden, located just south of the Warinanco Park Administration building. The garden is dedicated to the memory of Caxton Brown of Summit, New Jersey (1879-1952), who helped create, and was a member of, the Union County Park Commission. It contains hundreds of plants in many dozens of manicured beds. A boulder and plaque was dedicated in Brown's memory in the azalea garden in 1957.\nThe garden was refurbished with white gravel walking paths and new plantings in 2024.\nChatfield Garden\nThe Henry S. Chatfield Memorial Garden (also known as the Chatfield Garden). This area originally contained 14,200 tulips imported from Holland and planted in 21 beds but has been transitioned to more diverse blooms beyond tulips to support pollinators throughout the season.\nIt is named for the Union County Park Commission's first president Henry Summers Chatfield (1864-1933), who is memorialized with a stone bench in the tulip garden.\nUnion County Park Commission Administration Buildings\nThe Union County Park Commission Administration Buildings has several historical buildings located within the park. These buildings are listed on the state and the federal registers of historic places in 1985.\nSports\nThere is a 400-meter long athletic track as well as a long jump track and a space for shot put. Inside of the athletic track there is an artificial-surface field that can be used for soccer, football, and other sports.\nThe park has ten baseball diamonds.\nMagnolia Grove\nThere is a mature planting of flowering magnolia trees.\nWarinanco Lake\nA dock offers paddleboating.\nWarinanco Park Sports Center\nThe sports center, including the Warinanco Ice Rink, was expanded and modernized in 2017.\nFlora and fauna\nWarinanco is known for its springtime displays of cherry blossom, dogwood, redbud, and azalea blooms.
