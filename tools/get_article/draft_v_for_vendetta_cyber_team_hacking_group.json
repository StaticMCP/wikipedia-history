Their activities suggest a level of coordination, resources, and operational security often associated with state- or organization-backed cyber operations.\nOverview\nThe group is known for targeted cyber campaigns in multiple countries, including India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the United Kingdom. VFVCT specializes in website breaches, data exfiltration, and disruption of digital services, demonstrating technical capabilities beyond typical hacktivist activity. Their campaigns indicate strategic intent, often targeting sensitive government and institutional infrastructure.\nActivities and operations\n* Government Website Breaches: VFVCT has breached government portals, including the North Sulawesi government website, extracting databases and credentials.\n* Regional Cyber Campaigns: The group has launched coordinated operations affecting multiple countries, targeting government agencies and critical infrastructure. These campaigns display a level of planning and sophistication that has led analysts to speculate on potential backing or sponsorship.\n* High-Profile Malaysian Breach: On 16 September 2025, VFVCT breached Perbadanan Putrajaya and the Malaysia Space Agency (MYSA), reportedly exposing national ID numbers, names, addresses, emails, phone numbers, voter details, and other sensitive data.\n* Strategic Targeting: VFVCT’s attacks appear selective and goal-oriented, often aimed at high-value institutional networks rather than random defacement or disruption, aligning with patterns seen in state-backed cyber units.\nAnalysis and attribution\nWhile the exact affiliation of VFVCT remains unconfirmed, cybersecurity experts note that the group’s operational methods, resource allocation, and strategic targeting are consistent with those of state- or organization-sponsored cyber actors. Their campaigns are distinct from typical hacktivist operations, which are often decentralized and opportunistic.\nOther Asia-based APTs and hacktivist groups\n* APT32 – OceanLotus (Vietnam)\n* APT-C-35 / Charming Kitten (Iran)\n* Lazarus Group – APT38 (North Korea)\n* Berserk Bear (Russia)\n* StrongPity – APT-C-41 (Turkey)\n* Sandworm Team – APT28 (Russia)\nReferences\n* [https://cyberxtron.com/blog/emerging-hacktivist-v-for-vendetta-launches-cyberattack-campaigns-against-india-indonesia-malaysia-and-uk--6415 \"Emerging Hacktivist 'V FOR VENDETTA' Launches Cyberattack Campaigns Against India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and UK\"] – CyberXtron.
