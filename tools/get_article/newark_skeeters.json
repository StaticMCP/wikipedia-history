In 1928, the American Soccer League suspended Newark when the team defied the league's boycott of the National Challenge Cup.  The Skeeters then joined two other ASL teams, Bethlehem Steel and the New York Giants, in the newly created Eastern Professional Soccer League.  The club folded upon the merger of the ASL and ESL after the fall 1929 season.\nYear-by-year\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Division\n!League\n!Reg.
