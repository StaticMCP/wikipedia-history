On the steps up right the monument Ettore Ferrari had created a crown, in order to remember that Garibaldi was the first Master of Italian Freemasonry. During Fascism it was replaced by fascist symbols and a copy of it was put in place only in 1943. The monument was inaugurated on September 20, 1895 by Enrico Gallori.\nThe placement of the monument gave rise to several politic interpretations, as it was inaugurated in the period when relationships between the Kingdom of Italy and the Holy See were still suspended. The official version declared that the Hero directs his gaze to the Vatican. After the Lateran Treaty in 1929, the statue was turned around to face the city of Rome. A very popular Roman legend underlines that, in this way the horse now offers its backside to the Holy See.\nThe monument was restored by the Municipality of Rome in 1990.\nSee also\n* Giuseppe Garibaldi\n* Janiculum\n* Freemasonry\n* Monument to Giuseppe Garibaldi (Buenos Aires)\nReferences"
