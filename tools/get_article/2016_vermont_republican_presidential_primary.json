However, on election day, Donald Trump only narrowly won the popular vote by 2.3%, and tied with John Kasich in the delegate count. Vermont was one of only three states, along with his native Ohio and neighboring Michigan, where Kasich won a county.\nThis was the only GOP primary contest that Trump won in 2016 that he would lose in 2024, by 4 points to Nikki Haley.\nPolling\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"width:180px;\" |Poll source\n! style=\"width:135px;\" |Date\n! style=\"width:100px;\" |1st\n! style=\"width:100px;\" |2nd\n! style=\"width:100px;\" |3rd\n!Other\n|- style=\"background:Moccasin;\"\n|Primary results\n|March 1, 2016\n|Donald Trump32.34%\n|John Kasich30.01%\n|Marco Rubio19.08%\n|Ted Cruz 9.61%, Ben Carson 4.13%, Jeb Bush 1.79%, Rand Paul 0.68%, Chris Christie 0.58%, Carly Fiorina 0.34%, Rick Santorum 0.27%\n|-\n|Castleton University/Vermont\nPublic Radio\nMargin of error: ± 9.01% Sample size: 118\n|February 3–17, 2016\n|  |Donald Trump32.4%\n|Marco Rubio\n16.9%\n|Ted Cruz\n10.5%\n|John Kasich 10.0%, Jeb Bush 7.7%, Ben Carson 3.1%, Chris Christie 2.4%, Carly Fiorina 1.0%, Rick Santorum 0.6%, Someone else 3.3%, Not sure/Don't know 12.1%\n|}\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2;margin-bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:0.2em 0.4em;\" |2016 Vermont Republican presidential primary\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Candidate\n! colspan=\"2\" |Vote\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Delegates\n|-\n!#\n!%\n|-\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Donald Trump\n|19,974\n|32.52\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |8\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |John Kasich\n|18,534\n|30.17\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |8\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Marco Rubio\n|11,781\n|19.18\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Ted Cruz\n|5,932\n|9.66\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Ben Carson\n|2,551\n|4.15\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Jeb Bush (withdrawn)\n|1,106\n|1.80\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Rand Paul (withdrawn)\n|423\n|0.69\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Chris Christie (withdrawn)\n|361\n|0.59\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Carly Fiorina (withdrawn)\n|212\n|0.35\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Rick Santorum (withdrawn)\n|164\n|0.27\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Write-ins\n|390\n|0.63\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |0\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n!Total valid votes\n!61,428\n!100%\n!16\n|}\nDelegates were awarded to candidates who got 20% or more of the vote proportionally.\nAnalysis\nVermont's voter base is much more moderate and irreligious than the Southern Super Tuesday contests. Exit polls by Edison Research showed this benefitted Trump and Kasich: Trump carried somewhat conservative voters with 35% of the vote, but John Kasich won moderates with 40% to Trump's 34%. Kasich did particularly well in the populous Burlington metro, holding Trump to a narrow margin statewide.\nTurnout dropped in the Vermont Republican primary compared with 2012, as some registered Republicans crossed over to vote for favorite son Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary.\nSee also\n* 2016 Vermont Democratic presidential primary\nReferences"
