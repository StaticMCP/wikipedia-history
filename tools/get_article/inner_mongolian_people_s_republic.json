It existed from 9 September 1945 until 6 November 1945.\nHistory\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese established a puppet state in Inner Mongolia called Mengjiang. Mengjiang was disbanded by the invasion of Soviet and Mongolian troops in August 1945. On 9 September 1945, a congress of \"People's Representatives\" was held in what is now the Sonid Right Banner. The congress was attended by representatives, 80 of whom were from the Chahar, Xilingol, and Siziwang areas. The congress proclaimed the Inner Mongolian People's Republic, and a provisional government of 27 members was elected, of whom 11 were in the Standing Committee.\nThe Chinese Communist Party took notice of the government, fearing separatism. The CCP sent Ulanhu to take control of the situation, and he ordered the Inner Mongolian government to be dissolved. The region was later organised as the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region.\nSee also\n* Mongolian People's Republic in Outer Mongolia\nExternal links\n* [http://www.nmqq.gov.cn/fagui/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=4952 History of the interim government of the Inner Mongolian People's Republic]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140202121813/http://lyj.xlgl.gov.cn/ywxg_2/tzly/hsly/200709/t20070902_80098.htm 锡察地区的民族自治运动]"
