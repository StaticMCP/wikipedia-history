The building was built in 1917 during a wave of luxury apartment construction on the Near North Side. Architect John Nyden designed the Renaissance Revival building, which was one of Chicago's first luxury apartments designed in the style. Like most skyscrapers of the area, the ten-story building is split into three parts visually; the upper two and lower two floors are faced with terra cotta and are connected by a brick shaft. The building is topped with a cornice and balustrade. Terra cotta lintels and decorations add an Adamesque influence to the building.\nThe building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 26, 1987.\nReferences"
