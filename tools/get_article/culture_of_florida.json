      "text": "# Culture of Florida\n\nThe culture of Florida is often different in metropolitan areas than in more rural areas. Many parts of rural central and northern Florida are similar to the rest of American Southern culture, particularly around the Panhandle. In the larger cities such as Miami, Orlando, and Tampa, where there has been a large number of people moving from other parts of the United States (mostly New York, New Jersey and Illinois), and even other areas of the world, the culture is much more diverse, and has been heavily influenced by Caribbean, Latin American, Jewish, and European culture. Thus, modern-day Florida, from the second half of the 20th century through today, has been heavily influenced by the cultures of people moving in from foreign countries and other parts of the United States, and is often a mix of cultures, values, and ideas.\nThe state's close proximity to the ocean influences many aspects of Florida culture and daily life. Many people in Florida are avid boaters, surfers, and divers. Florida is home to more charter boat companies than any state in the United States. Snorkeling is a popular weekend activity in southern Florida, with several sites having dive and snorkeling training. In northern Florida, there are many horse breeding and riding farms, and the area around Ocala is one of the centers of thoroughbred horse breeding in the world. Florida culture is also influenced by tourism, an important industry in the state. Florida is home to the largest number of cruise ships in the world, and many people work in the cruise industry.\nCuisine\nSouthern Florida has been more influenced by infusions from the various cuisines of the Caribbean, South America, and Europe, compared to Northern Florida. However, the cuisine of the Southern United States is popular throughout the whole state. Florida is most often associated with seafood, key lime pie and Floribbean cuisine. Citrus and strawberry production are major industries and the fruits are widely consumed, with strawberries seen as a winter and spring staple. Strawberry shortcake is especially popular with around 200,000 sold each year during the 11-day Florida Strawberry Festival. Less conventional strawberry desserts such as strawberry,pizza are enjoyed by tourists. Tropical fruits are grown in South Florida and are widely used in Florida cuisine. Barbecue is especially popular throughout the state, where many barbecue competitions are held annually. The development of Florida cuisine has drawn on the cuisines of the southeastern United States, the Bahamas, Colombia, Spain, Cuba, and the rest of the Caribbean, as well as being influenced by national and worldwide trends. Florida attracts immigrants from places around the world as well, many of whom bring their native cuisine with them.\nEconomic trends\nFlorida's population increases annually more rapidly than that of most states. The main economic driver for Florida is tourism. Hotels, restaurants, leisure activities and other tourism-related activities are economically important. Many people from other states retire in Florida. This helps drive home construction, infrastructure expansion, as well as the banking and financial planning industries. Recreational and commercial fishing have been economically important in Florida for over a century.\nFlorida is also an important agricultural state, producing large amounts of vegetables, fruits, cattle, and dairy products. Light manufacturing has recently increased in Florida, and a number of companies have moved their headquarters to the state, attracted by lower taxes and less regulations.\nLanguages\nAs of 2005, 74.54 percent of Florida residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a first language, while 18.65 percent spoke Spanish, and 1.73 percent of the population spoke French Creole (predominantly Haitian Creole). French was spoken by 0.63 percent, followed by German at 0.45 percent, and Portuguese at 0.44 percent of all residents. Also, Italian comprised 0.32 percent, while Tagalog made up 0.30 percent of speakers, Vietnamese was at 0.25 percent and Arabic at 0.23 percent. In all, 25.45 percent of Florida's population age 5 and older spoke a language other than English.\nFlorida's public education system identifies over 200 first languages other than English spoken in the homes of students. In 1990, the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) won a class action lawsuit against the state Florida Department of Education that required educators to be trained in teaching English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL).\nLiterature\nFlorida literature is as varied as the state itself. Genres traditionally include fiction, nonfiction, and poetry, and some of it may be considered part of the American regional Southern literature genre. Writers affiliated with the locale of Florida include William Bartram, Elizabeth Bishop, James Branch Cabell, Hart Crane, Stephen Crane, Harry Crews, Nilo Cruz, John Fleming, Ernest Hemingway, Carl Hiaasen, Jay Hopler, Zora Neale Hurston, José Martí, Campbell McGrath, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, Wallace Stevens, and Harriet Beecher Stowe.\nMusic\nFlorida is the birthplace of Southern Rock.  Bands such as Lynyrd Skynyrd, Molly Hatchet, The Allman Brothers all hailed from Northern Florida. The Outlaws hailed from Tampa Bay.\nFlorida is home to several unique music subgenres including Freestyle Florida breaks and Miami bass.\nSince the 90s, Miami has made a name in the world of electronic, rap, and reggaeton music.
