By late 2025, global finance and artificial intelligence were \"deeply intertwined\". A June 2025 Menlo Ventures report raised concerns about the sustainability of future revenue and long-term profitability of AI, given the relatively low rate of consumer monetization.\n2017\n* 30 NovemberThe New York Times said that new AI reports by McKinsey & Company, the National Bureau of Economic Research, and an AI Index created by university researchers, indicated an early AI boom. The Index built on a project\"The One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence\" launched in 2014.\n2018\n* 2018 was a year of incremental AI growth in finance.\n2022\n* The release of ChatGPT by OpenAI became the catalyst for an artificial intelligence boom that continues to remake the global economy.\n*  According to a European Central Bank report, public interest in AI increased rapidly as evidenced with rising Google searches, AI jobs, models, patents, and innovations since late 2022. At that time Europe led the US in the size of its AI workforce.\n2023\n* The regulatory body, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), published their report, \"Generative Artificial Intelligence in Finance: Risk Considerations\", drawing attention to oversight gaps and the need for regulations. The report explores the risks posed by using generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) systems in the financial sector including \"broader risks to financial stability.\"\n2024\n* January 12 In January 2024 Bloomberg's published its list of the \"Magnificent Seven\" Big Tech companies on the stock market based on their strength, size and market capitalizationApple, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Meta Platforms (Facebook), Nvidia, and Tesla.\n* 21 June  During the AI boom, Nvidia became the world's most valuable company, surpassing Microsoft, as its value increased to over US$4 trillion.\n*  In 2023 and 2024, the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks were the primary drivers behind the increase in equity indexes, according to Reuters.\n2025\nJanuary\n* 23 January President Donald Trump's AI policy was announced calling for United States global leadership in artificial intelligence. The Economist noted that this politic shift in which the United States seeks \"global dominance\" in AI includes trimming regulations and assisting in expansion of infrastructure and increase in number of AI workers. Governments of Gulf nations were also investing trillions of dollars in AI.\n* 27 January Against the backdrop of a tech war between China and the United States over AI dominance, within days of the launch of China's free DeepSeek App, it was the most downloaded app in the United States, rising to the first place in the Apple app store. President Trump responded immediately, saying this \"sudden rise\" should be a \"wake-up\" call to the United States, and called on US companies to be more competitive.\nJune\n* 26 June In their June 2025 report, Menlo Ventures estimated that only about 3% of consumers paid for artificial intelligence-related services, representing about $USD12 billion in annual spending. This is relatively low in contrast to the massive capital expenditure by AI infrastructure companies, which raises concerns about revenue sustainability and long-term profitability.\nJuly\n* 23 July The Trump administration launched the US AI Action Plan, positioning the United States in a high-stakes technological race with China for global dominance in artificial intelligence, emphasizing that neither nation can afford to fall behind due to the exponential nature of AI advancement. The plan, a new government website and policy speech called for accelerated AI adoption across federal agencies, and a number of initiatives to make is easier for AI infrastructure expansion, and other measures to ensure American leadership in AI standards. Some leading experts warned that the administration failed to provide sufficient regulations and safeguards for AI safety. Concerns were raised about the negative impacts of cuts to research funding and tightened visa policies for scientists, potentially undermining public trust and America's ability to compete internationally.\nSeptember\n* 7 September The Economist cautioned that AI revenues are relatively modest compared to the high cost and investments in the creation of new data centers. Even Sam AltmanOpenAI CEO and one of the leading figures of the AI boom,raised concerns about investors' outsized hopes for financial returns. At the same time, history has shown that new technologies, like railways and electricity, endured and spread after the initial hype faded.\n* 12 September Economists warn that U.S. households' direct and indirect investmentsmutual funds or retirement plansin the stock market reached an unprecedented historically high level, now representing 45% of all financial assets, or about $USD51.2 trillion. Compared to the Dot-com bubble this represents a sharp increase in exposure. This makes U.S. households vulnerable to market downturns which in turn would result in decreasing consumer spending. U.S. household net worth rose to a record $176.3 trillion in the second quarter, an increase of $7.3 trillion since early 2025 and about $46 trillion higher than before the pandemic. Federal Reserve data attribute the surge primarily to gains in stock markets and housing values. However, the rise in wealth on paper coincided with increased household borrowing and growing government debt.\n* 18 September Questions were being raised about how quickly the data centers, chips, servers, and GPUs assets of major AI companies will depreciate in value. Comparisons have been made to the Railway Mania in the aftermath of the stock market bubble where a valuable physical infrastructure remained standing, and the telecoms crash after the dot-com bubble which left fiber networks.\n*28 September There were warnings that record-high American stock ownership during the AI-fueled market boom is a red flag for systemic risk, as the current concentration in equities exceeds levels seen before the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, and could amplify the impact of any future stock market correction.\nOctober\n*  3 October In 2025 alone, venture capitalists invested almost $USD200 billion in the artificial intelligence sector.\n* 29 October Nvidia was the first company in the world to be valued at US$5 trillion, largely due to AI demand and strategic partnerships with leading technology and AI firms. Nvidia's increase in value was \"meteoric\".\nNovember\n*  2 November Forbes reported that, since April, the 'Magnificent Seven' tech giants together contributed over 40% of the S&P 500's return, highlighting their outsized influence and the growing impact of AI on market valuations. CNN warned that while there is a current benefit to investors, with such a high concentration in the S&P 500, they are highly exposed to the fate of the Mag Seven.\n*  2 November Globally there are 11,000 datacentreshuge campuses for AI infrastructure, including thousands of chips, GPUS, and servers. This represents a 500% increase over the last two decades. It is anticipated that $3USDtn more will be spent on increasing that number over the next two or three years.\n* 5 November Concerns about the potential for a market bubble were raised as six of the AI-related Big Tech \"Magnificent Seven\"that contribute to the AI boomreported losing ground in the stock market. Global markets and artificial intelligence have become \"deeply intertwined\", according to a Reuters report.\n**As of November 2025, more than 50% of the 20 largest S&P firms were deeply exposed to AI. In contrast, in 2000, the 20 S&P 500 firms represented 39% of its total value only 11 of these companies were exposed to the internet. If AI fails to deliver strong returns on their investments, these top S&P firms would be significantly impacted, according to the Economist.\n** Analysts suggest that the AI market in 2025 may not behave like a traditional one, as investors are simultaneously aware of the risks and driven by the potential for outsized rewards. Leading AI labs may believe that the first company to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI)—when an AI system surpasses all human cognitive abilities and becomes capable of self-improvement—could dominate the future of technology and finance. While some have estimated that the potential value of such a breakthrough could be as high as $1.46 quadrillion, this figure is speculative and widely debated.\n* 5 November Bloomberg described Nvidia's H100 Hopper-Blackwell AI chips as the \"King of AI chips\". Nvidia dominates the AI chip market with over 78% of the market share because of both speed and cost. According to Business Insider, the technical superiority and widespread developer familiarity with Nvidia's platform resulted in H100 chips becoming the preferred choice for demanding AI workloads.\n* 7 November Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England called attention to the risk to the market in light of the lack of certainty about future earnings in AI versus AI companies \"very positive productivity contribution\".\n* 10 November The first report of the Forecasting Research institute's (FRI) Longitudinal Expert AI Panel (LEAP) was published, providing insights into the projected high-stakes impact of AI by 2030. The panel includes hundreds of leading experts from computer science, economics, and AI policyincluding superforecasters. LEAP experts forecast that around 18% of work hours in the US will be assisted by generative AI by 2030, up sharply from approximately 2% in 2025. This reflects a major anticipated integration of AI technologies into daily work and productivity.\n* 11 November By late fall 2025, these large AI-related tech companiesincluding Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Googlehad begun using loans and financial instrumentsspecial purpose vehicles (S.P.V.), asset-backed securities (A.B.S.)to obtain the capital they need for large investments in their new data centers and AI infrastructure. Elon Musk's xAI and Meta used S.P.V.s, rather than relying only on their own cash flow, to acquire tens of billions in debt for major investments. Citing the June Menlo report on low consumer interest in paid AI use combined with huge capital expenditure by large AI companies, a New York Times article cited growing concerns about revenue sustainability, long-term profitability, and the potential risk factor for credit markets, as tech firms take on increasing amounts of debt to finance acquisition of billions of dollars of Nvidia chips, for example.\nSee also\n* Applications of artificial intelligence\n* AI boom\n* Existential risk from artificial intelligence\n* Statement on AI Risk\n* Big Tech\n* AI alignment\nFootnotes\nReferences\nB\n*\n* |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-12/the-magnificent-seven-shape-us-stocks-microsoft-apple-nvidia-and-more|work=Bloomberg|date=12 January 2024|access-date=2025-08-05}}\n*\nC\n*\n*\nD\n*\nE\n*  | access-date=9 November 2025}}\n*  | access-date=5 November 2025}}\n*  | access-date=6 November 2025}}\n*  |work=The Economist |people=Tom Standage (editor), Alex Hern (AI writer)|series=Insider|date=5 November 2025c |title=Could the AI bubble pop? |access-date=10 November 2025 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-26Zv7pVW8}}\n*  | access-date=11 November 2025}}\n*\nG\n*\nH\n*\n*\nI\n*\nK\n*\n*\n*\n*\nL\n*\n*\n*\nM\n* | title=2025: The State of Consumer AI | date=26 June 2025 | url=https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-consumer-ai/ | access-date=8 November 2025}}\n*\n*\nR\n*  |work=Forecasting Research Institute |user=Research_FRI |number=1987883190803964334 |date=10 November 2025 |title=Today, we are launching the most rigorous ongoing source of expert forecasts on the future of AI: the Longitudinal Expert AI Panel (LEAP) |access-date=11 November 2025}}\nS\n*\n*\n*  | access-date=5 November 2025}}\n*\nT\n*\nW\n*\n* |title=America’s AI Action Plan |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf |website=The White House |publisher=Executive Office of the President of the United States |date=July 2025 |access-date=8 November 2025 }}\n*  | access-date=5 November 2025}}\n*"
