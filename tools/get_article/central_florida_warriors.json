They competed in the USA Rugby League (USARL) in the Southeast Rugby League Conference. They play their home games at Spec Martin Stadium.\nHistory\nThe Warriors were founded in March, 2014 as part of an expansion by the USARL to represent the Central Florida area from Daytona to Orlando in the sport of rugby league. Along with fellow new clubs the Atlanta Rhinos and Tampa Mayhem they joined The Jacksonville Axemen to form the USARL South Conference.\nThe Warriors name was used as a way to pay tribute to all the military men and women who have served the United States.\nAfter winning their inaugural game against fellow newcomers the Atlanta Rhinos in the opening round in the 2014 season, the team went on to finish second in the Southern Conference. In the playoffs they again defeated the Rhinos before being eliminated by the Jacksonville Axemen in the Southern Conference championship. 2015 saw the Warriors enter the season with newfound confidence after what many thought was a successful first season in the USARL. The team finished the regular season 3-3, again finishing second in their conference. This time in the playoffs they defeated the Axemen in the Conference semi-final before going down to the Atlanta Rhinos in the Conference championship round.\nUSARL season summaries\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|+ C = champions, R = runners-up, F = finished first, P = playoff appearance, L = finished last (brackets represent playoff games)\n!
