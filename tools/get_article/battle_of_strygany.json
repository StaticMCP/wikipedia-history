According to Odukha, UPA lost 70 troops in this clash.\nOn May 13, the Soviet forces attacked UPA's defensive line near Bryduryn. Some UPA units managed to break out with casualties, while others took advantage of environment and Soviet disorganization. However, half of UPA troops were unable to break out and were defeated in swap near Bryduryn.\nAftermath\nAccording to Odukha's report, UPA suffered 127 killed and 28 captured. Other sources estimate UPA losses at 83–102 killed and 30 captured. According to eyewitness accounts, 7 of UPA captives were executed on Odukha's order and the rest were sent with NKVD and given various sentences. Soviet authorities learnt about UPA's planned propaganda activities in Eastern regions after interrogating prisoners.\nLegacy\nOn June 1992, dead UPA fighters were honored with a memorial in the form of metal cross.
