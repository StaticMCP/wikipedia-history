It was written by Walter Klenhard, based on a story he wrote with Chuck Norris and his brother Aaron. Chuck Norris also starred in the film, with Eddie Cibrian and Joe Spano. The film premiered on November 1, 1998, on CBS.\nPlot\nIn 1983, ten-year-old Logan Fallon witnesses the murders of his family (younger sister Jessica; their parents Nicholas and Terry) - along with five police officers - by Mafia thugs. Following said tragedy, Logan grows up on a Taos, New Mexico ranch owned by Jake Fallon (a former Army Ranger and recipient of the Distinguished Service Cross) and Ben, the boy's paternal uncle and maternal grandfather, respectively.\nUltimately, Ben and Jake discover that Logan has been blessed with \"proximity sense\": the ability to perceive danger before it happens. Said gift previously saved Logan's life from the mobsters who slaughtered Jessica and their parents; sadly, his warnings were dismissed as youthful gibberish.\nIn 1991, Logan follows in Jake's footsteps by joining the Army and becoming a Ranger. He learns martial arts and survival skills, becoming a tough and lethal fighting machine. Seven years later, he has achieved the rank of Staff Sergeant - and earned a Distinguished Service Cross of his own, by rescuing a downed U.S. Air Force Captain in Guatemala.\nLogan returns to Jake's ranch, where they plan for Logan to resign from the Army so he can avenge the murders of their loved ones. Logan is torn between obeying the laws of the land or living by his own rules. Traveling to Chicago, he visits his family's graves and discovers that Nick's best friend - now his executor - has invested wisely over the past 15 years, thus becoming very wealthy.\nLogan moves into a hotel to plan his revenge; while living there, he has to deal with a woman and her son living with her abusive husband, and they soon form a bond. He gives them money to leave and when the husband returns after he went to go get beer, he finds Logan sitting on the couch and the latter teaches him a lesson by beating him up.\nUsing the name \"Jimmy Testa\", Logan infiltrates the underworld clan responsible for his family's death. Under the wing of Sal Mercado, Jimmy works his way up the Mafia ladder. Meanwhile, FBI Agent John Downing - who himself has been pursuing the Fallon killers for over a decade - reviews the old case files after Logan contacts him anonymously. Jimmy has been contracted to assassinate Joseph Landers, a local judge; acting on Logan's tip, Downing arranges for the judge's death to be faked. For carrying out said hit, Jimmy is slated to become a \"made man\". But at his ceremony, Logan reveals his true identity to all those gathered and proceeds to finish what the mob started 15 years ago, with an assist from his uncle Jake.\nCast\n* Chuck Norris as Ranger Jake Fallon\n* Eddie Cibrian as Logan Fallon\n* Joe Spano as Special Agent John Downing\n* Jeff Kober as Sal Mercado\n* R.D.
