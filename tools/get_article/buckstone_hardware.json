They added a fifth member and moved to Toronto. In 1969, they changed their name to Buckstone Hardware.The Canadian Pop Music Encyclopedia - [https://canpopencyclopedia.home.blog/b/#Buckstone_Hardware BUCKSTONE HARDWARE]\nIn the summer of 1969, Buckstone Hardware appeared at a concert that was opened by Motherlode. The Guess Who were also at the event. When Buckstone Hardware came on to do their set, guitarist Jake Thomas broke the high E string of his guitar within the first minute. He didn't have a spare guitar and had to finish the song. After the song finished, he had a tap on his shoulder and it was Randy Bachman offering him the use of his guitar. After the next song Bachman returned his guitar to him with the new string installed. After the show, he wanted to thank Bachman and went to the tent where the Guess Who were in but he was stopped by security.Bay Today, Jul 30, 2004 - [https://www.baytoday.ca/local-news/when-jake-met-randy-updated-62794 When Jake met RandyLocal blues guitarist Jake Thomas meets rock legend Randy Bachman 36 years after the former Guess Who guitarist helped him out.]\nDuring their time they shared billing with acts such as Manchild and Brutus.The Canadian Pop Music Encyclopedia - [https://canpopencyclopedia.home.blog/b/#Buckstone_Hardware BUCKSTONE HARDWARE] They were referred to by Billboard as one of Toronto's leading bands.\nTheir manager was Michael Watson.Billboard, May 30, 1970 - [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_fSkEAAAAMBAJ/page/n91/mode/2up?q=Buckstone Page 71 Canadian News Report, From The Music Capitals of the World, TORONTO]\nCareer\n1968 to 1969\nIn 1969, the North Bay group, having appeared recently on the Sunday Morning Show on CBC-TV and their week run at Electric Circus, along with appearances local and further afield had set a good scene for their record release.
