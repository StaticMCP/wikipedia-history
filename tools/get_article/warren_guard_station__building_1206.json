It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.\nThe building is a  \"Shotgun ('Rocky Mountain Cabin') style building, with classical refinements such as the temple front, columns with capital moldings, and six-over-six sash. It is of wood frame construction on a concrete foundation, with a north facing corrugated metal (steel) gable roof. The siding is Shevlin log cabin siding (developed by Shevlin-Hixon Lumber to emulate log construction).\"\nReferences"
