Joaquín Balaguer of the Social Christian Reformist Party won the presidential election, whilst the Dominican Revolutionary Party-led alliance won the Congressional elections. Voter turnout was 87.6%.\nDespite reforms after the 1990 elections, including a new electoral roll, these elections were also branded fraudulent. Following the election an agreement known as the Pact for Democracy (Pacto por la Democracia) was reached, which shortened the presidential term to two years, allowing new elections to be held in 1996 in which Balaguer would not run (for the first time since 1966).\nResults\nPresident\nCongress\nReferences"
