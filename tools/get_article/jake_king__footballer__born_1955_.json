King made a total of 306 appearances in the Football League for Shrewsbury, scoring 20 goals, before leaving in 1982 to join Wrexham. At Wrexham, King made 92 League appearances, scoring 5 goals. On 3 October 1984, away to FC Porto in the first round of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, he scored twice in the first half of a 4–3 away defeat as Wrexham beat the Portuguese on the away goals rule. King's final League club was Cardiff City, where he made 30 appearances, before joining Limerick City in Ireland.\nCoaching career\nIn 1987, King advised then Shrewsbury Town player David Moyes to his first coaching role, at Concord College.\nKing left his position as manager of Telford United to manage former club Shrewsbury Town in May 1997; he was sacked in November 1999. He later returned to Telford United, before being sacked in April 2004.\nKing was appointed First Team Coach at Aberystwyth Town in June 2009.\nBusiness interests\nKing worked as a chef before his professional playing career and since has also run restaurants. He ran a restaurant in Ireland for five years, commuting from England to personally run the kitchen. He later acquired a public house called The Cross Gates at Ford near Shrewsbury which three years later he converted into a restaurant called Smokestop BBQ, and ran it as an American smokehouse with his wife and son before selling the business in 2016.\nPersonal life\nAnother of King's sons, Jordan, is also a footballer, and played under his father at Telford United.\nReferences"
