However, the Russian world champ beats the program in a televised match. The West German mathematician becomes a top chess pro himself, which the West German media boast will prove the superiority of Germany and democracy. Rosemund believes that the entire Red Communist bloc is out to stop him from vanquishing their own Stefan Koruga, to become the next Bobby Fischer and a symbol that capitalism is preferable to socialism.\nCritical reception\nJohn Simon called Black and White Like Day and Night \"the best film ever about chess\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
