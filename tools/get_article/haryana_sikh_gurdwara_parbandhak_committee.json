HSGPC), also known as the Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (HSGMC), is an organization responsible for the upkeep of Sikh gurdwaras in the Indian state of Haryana. It was formed on 11 July 2014 by a Haryana Legislative Assembly bill. Before this, the gurdwaras of Haryana were officially under Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC). HSGPC is headquartered at Kurukshetra.\nOn 20 September 2022, the Supreme Court of India upheld the validity of the Haryana Sikh Gurdwaras (Management) Act, 2014, paving the way for the formation of HSGMC.\nHistory\nThe idea of a separate gurudwara management committee for Haryana was originally proposed by Didar Singh Nalwi and then he started this movement on 27 December 2000. HSGPC was registered as a society in Jan 2003 with members as following : Jagdish Singh Jhinda, Gurbhajan Singh Chahal, Didar Singh Kamboj, Balwinder Singh bajwa, Hakam Singh Arnauli, Iqbal Singh Waraich, Avtar Singh Chakku, Nawab Singh Virk(Singhra), Jarnail Singh Ajrana, Manjit Singh Bedi & Surjit Singh Bajwa.

Why to deny same rights to the Haryana Sikhs  Delhi Sikhs have their own committee called Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee for maintaining all historical Gurdwaras in Delhi.\nAn SGPC Member who was elected on SAD(B) from Karnal, Bhupinder Singh Asandh stand in support of  demand for an independent gurdwara body. He said neither he is honored and nor the SGPC sought his suggestions for the management of Haryana gurdwaras. Other SGPC (Badal) members Harpal Singh and Machonda Amrik Singh Janetpur, both from Ambala, were also supporting the demand for separate body to manage Sikh shrines in Haryana. The chief of Sehajdhari Sikh Party P. S. Ranu handed a memorandum to chief minister for inclusion of Sehajdhari Sikhs in the proposed body.\nRadical Sikh outfit Dal Khalsa and spokesperson Kanwar Pal Singh welcomed the passage of HSGPC Bill and congratulated Haryana Sikhs for getting the right to manage their religious institutions.\nThe formation of separate committee is supported by Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee.\nCriticism and Opposition\nThe move is opposed by Parkash Singh Badal (then Chief Minister of Punjab - SAD/BJP) and  SGPC Head-Avtar Singh Makkad and called it a planning of Congress Party to divide Sikhs. Parkash Singh Badal cried and even threats to quit as CM of Punjab.\nOn 3 July 2014, Jathedar of Akal Takhat, Giani Gurbachan Singh appealed Haryana Sikh not to form another committee and forms a 10 Member committee to talk with Sikh leaders of Haryana who are struggling for creating another committee.\nExcommunications of HSGPC officials\nAkal Takhat, Sikh's highest temporal seat excommunicated Haryana finance minister Harmohinder Singh Chattha. Also two top officials of HSGPC, Jagdish Singh Jhinda and Didar Singh Nalwi. This decision is called politically motivated.\nCriticism of Excommunications\nCoordinator of American Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee said ''It's a matter of serious concern that Sikh's top institution is losing credibility all because Akal Takht Jathedar's independence is under question\nBhai Mohkam Singh, the convener of United Sikh Forum met Jathedar Gurbachan Singh on 17 July and demanded to take back decision.\nCapturing of Haryana Gurdwaras by SAD and SGPC\nOn 17 July 2014, Amritsar Based SGPC, backed with Shiromani Akali Dal, also executed their battle planning which they fortified many Gurdwaras in Haryana. They deployed around 5-100 Armed persons in Gurdwaras. On 21 July, Haryana Government said that they will not forcibly take over Gurdwaras and will do peaceful march for the same. HSGPC leader Didar Nalvi criticized CM of Punjab for making Arab like situation where shia and SUnni are fighting with each other.\non 6 August, members of HSGPC made a forceful attempt to enter Gurdwara in Kurukshetra and police used water canons, tear gas shells and cane charge to disperse them. Several HSGMC members were injured and some vehicles too were also damaged as HSGMC members were chased away by police.\nHSGPC leader claimed that the Gurdwaras which are vacated by SGPC has missing Cash and Gold.
