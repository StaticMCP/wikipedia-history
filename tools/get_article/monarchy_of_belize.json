The current Belizean monarch and head of state, since , is . As sovereign, he is the personal embodiment of the Belizean Crown. Although the person of the sovereign is shared with 14 other independent countries within the Commonwealth of Nations, each country's monarchy is separate and legally distinct. As a result, the current monarch is officially titled  of Belize and, in this capacity, he and other members of the royal family undertake public and private functions as representatives of the Belizean state. However, the  is the only member of the royal family with any constitutional role.\nAll executive authority is vested in the monarch, and royal assent is required for the National Assembly to enact laws and for letters patent and Orders in Council to have legal effect. Most of the powers are exercised by the elected members of parliament, government ministers, and judges. Other powers vested in the monarch are significant but are treated only as reserve powers and as an important security part of the role of the monarchy.\nThe Crown today primarily functions as a guarantor of continuous and stable governance and a nonpartisan safeguard against the abuse of power. While some powers are exercisable only by the sovereign, most of the monarch's operational and ceremonial duties are exercised by his representative, the governor-general of Belize.\nOrigins\n| salign=right| source=Former Government Minister Hector Silva, 2022}}\nIn 1836, after the emancipation of Central America from Spanish rule, the British claimed the right to administer the region nowadays known as Belize. In 1862, the Settlement of Belize in the Bay of Honduras was declared a British colony called British Honduras, and the crown's representative was elevated to a lieutenant governor, subordinate to the governor of Jamaica.\nUnder a new constitution, the United Kingdom granted British Honduras self-governance in 1964. On 1 June 1973, British Honduras was officially renamed Belize. Independence from the United Kingdom was granted on 21 September 1981, following the signing of the Belize Independence Order in 1981 by Queen Elizabeth II, which made Belize a sovereign state and an independent constitutional monarchy.\nPrince Michael of Kent represented the Queen at the independence celebrations. In the capital, Belmopan, in the morning of 21 September, Prince Michael handed the instruments of independence to George Price, who became the prime minister of the newly independent country. Elmira Minita Gordon, a sociologist, was appointed governor-general of Belize by the Queen the same day, who upon assuming office became the first female governor-general in Commonwealth history.\nThe Belizean Crown and its aspects\n| salign=right| source=Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel, addressing Queen Elizabeth II of Belize, 1985}}\nThe sovereign of Belize is shared with 14 other Commonwealth realms, members of the Commonwealth of Nations that share the same person as sovereign. However, the monarch's relationship with Belize is completely independent from his position as monarch of any other realm. Despite sharing the same person as their respective national monarch, each of the Commonwealth realms is sovereign and independent of the others.\nSince independence in 1981, the Belizean Crown has had both a shared and a separate character and the sovereign's role as monarch of Belize is distinct to his or her position as monarch of any other realm, including the United Kingdom. Only Belizean ministers can advise the sovereign on matters of the Belizean state. The monarchy thus ceased to be an exclusively British institution and in Belize became a Belizean, or \"domesticated\" establishment.\nThis division is illustrated in a number of ways: The sovereign, for example, holds a unique Belizean title and, when he is acting in public specifically as a representative of Belize, he uses, where possible, Belizean symbols, including the country's national flag and the like.\n, featuring St Edward's Crown in the centre, and a crowned lion on top.]]\nIn Belize, the legal personality of the state is referred to as the \"Crown in Right of Belize\", or \"His Majesty in right of His Government in Belize\", or the \"Crown in right of His Majesty's Government in Belize\".\nTitle\nIn Belize, the King's official title is: Charles the Third, by the Grace of God, King of Belize and of His Other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth.\nThis style communicates Belize's status as an independent monarchy, highlighting the sovereign's role specifically as Sovereign of Belize, as well as the shared aspect of the Crown throughout the Commonwealth realms. Typically, the sovereign is styled \"King of Belize\", and is addressed as such when in Belize.\nSuccession\nLike some realms, Belize defers to United Kingdom law to determine the line of succession.\nSuccession is by absolute primogeniture governed by the provisions of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, as well as the Act of Settlement 1701, and the Bill of Rights 1689. This legislation limits the succession to the natural (i.e. non-adopted), legitimate descendants of Sophia, Electress of Hanover, and stipulates that the monarch cannot be a Roman Catholic, and must be in communion with the Church of England upon ascending the throne. Though these constitutional laws, as they apply to Belize, still lie within the control of the British parliament, both the United Kingdom and Belize cannot change the rules of succession without the unanimous consent of the other realms, unless explicitly leaving the shared monarchy relationship; a situation that applies identically in all the other realms, and which has been likened to a treaty amongst these countries.\nUpon a demise of the Crown (the death or abdication of a sovereign), it is customary for the accession of the new monarch to be proclaimed by the governor-general in the capital, Belmopan, after the accession. Regardless of any proclamations, the late sovereign's heir immediately and automatically succeeds, without any need for confirmation or further ceremony. An appropriate period of mourning also follows, during which flags across the country are flown at half-mast to honour the late monarch. The day of the funeral is likely to be a public holiday. A memorial service commemorating the late monarch is likely to be held at St. John's Cathedral, Belize City.\nConstitutional role and royal prerogative\nand President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan converse under a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, 2018]]\nThe Belizean Constitution gives Belize a similar parliamentary system of government as the other Commonwealth realms, in which all powers of the state are constitutionally reposed in the monarch, who is represented by the governor-general of Belize; appointed by the monarch upon the advice of the prime minister of Belize. The monarch's domestic duties are performed by this vice-regal representative.\nThe role of the monarch and the governor-general is both legal and practical; the Crown is regarded as a corporation, in which several parts share the authority of the whole, with the monarch as the person at the centre of the constitutional construct.\nExecutive\nThe governor-general is responsible for appointing a prime minister, who thereafter heads the Cabinet and advises the monarch or governor-general on how to execute their executive powers over all aspects of government operations and foreign affairs. The monarch is informed by the governor-general of the acceptance of the resignation of a prime minister and the swearing-in of a new prime minister and members of the ministry.\nThe governor-general also appoints and dismisses ministers, members of various executive agencies, and other officials.\nThere are also a few duties which must be specifically performed by the monarch, such as signing the appointment papers of governors-general.\nAs all executive authority of Belize is vested in the sovereign, the institutions of government are said to act under his authority; hence, the government of Belize is formally referred to as \"His Majesty's Government in Belize\".\nForeign affairs\n, 2022]]\nThe Royal Prerogative also extends to foreign affairs: the sovereign or the governor-general may negotiate and ratify treaties, alliances, and international agreements; no parliamentary approval is required. However, a treaty cannot alter the domestic laws of Belize; an Act of Parliament is necessary in such cases. The governor-general, on behalf of the monarch, also accredits Belizean High Commissioners and ambassadors, and receives diplomats from foreign states.\nIn addition, the issuance of passports falls under the Royal Prerogative and, as such, all Belizean passports are issued in the governor-general's name, the monarch's vice-regal representative.\nNational Assembly\nThe governor-general is responsible for summoning the two Houses of the National Assembly: the Senate and the House of Representatives, and may at any time prorogue or dissolve the National Assembly. At the opening of a new parliamentary session, the governor-general reads the Speech from the Throne, outlining the government's legislative agenda. A general election follows dissolution, the writs for which are issued by the governor-general at Belize House.\nFurther, the constitution outlines that the governor-general alone is responsible for appointing senators. The viceroy must make five senatorial appointments on the advice of the prime minister, one after consulting the Belize Advisory Council, and two on the advice of the leader of the opposition, or if the position is vacant, then in accordance with the advice of person(s) selected by the governor-general in his own deliberate judgment.\nAll laws in Belize are enacted with the viceroy's signature. The granting of a signature to a bill is known as Royal Assent; it, and proclamation, are required for all acts of parliament, usually granted or withheld by the governor-general, with the Public Seal of Belize.\nThe authority of the Crown is embodied in the mace of the House of Representatives, which bears a crown at its apex; unlike other bicameral realms, however, the Belizean legislature only has a mace for the lower house.\nBecause the Belizean monarchy is a constitutional one, the powers that are constitutionally the monarch's are exercised almost wholly upon the advice of her prime minister and the ministers of the Crown in Cabinet, who are, in turn, accountable to the democratically elected House of Representatives, and through it, to the people. The monarch's role, and thereby the viceroy's role, is almost entirely symbolic and cultural, acting as a symbol of the legal authority under which all governments and agencies operate. In exceptional circumstances, however, the monarch or viceroy can act against such advice based upon his or her reserve powers.\nCourts\nThe sovereign is responsible for rendering justice to all his subjects, and is thus traditionally deemed the fount of justice. In Belize, criminal offences are legally deemed to be offences against the sovereign and proceedings for indictable offences are brought in the sovereign's name in the form of The King [or Queen] versus [Name]. Hence, the common law holds that the sovereign \"can do no wrong\", and the monarch cannot be prosecuted in his or her own courts for criminal offences.\n| salign=right| source=Elizabeth II of Belize, 1994}}\nThe appointment of the chief justice of Belize, and other justices of the Supreme Court also falls under the Royal Prerogative, and these duties are assigned to the governor-general by the Constitution.\nThe governor-general can also grant immunity from prosecution, exercise the \"prerogative of mercy\", and pardon offences against the Crown. Pardons may be awarded before, during, or after a trial. The exercise of the 'Prerogative of Mercy' to grant a pardon and the commutation of prison sentences in described in section 52 of the Belizean Constitution.\nCultural role\nBelize celebrates the birthday of its monarch every year in May. The day is known as ''Sovereign's Day'', and is marked by parades in Belize City, although it is not an official public holiday, like in the UK. Horse races, conducted by the National Sports Council, are held in Belize City's National Stadium and Orange Walk Town's People's Stadium. A cycling race, also arranged by the National Sports Council, is held between the cities of Belmopan and Cayo. There is a flag-raising ceremony among other events held at schools and universities to commemorate Sovereign's Day.\nThe Crown and Honours\nWithin the Commonwealth realms, the monarch is deemed the fount of honour. Similarly, the monarch, as Sovereign of Belize, confers awards and honours in Belize in his name. Most of them are often awarded on the advice of \"His Majesty's Belize Ministers\". Investitures are conducted by the governor-general on behalf of the sovereign.\nThrough the passage of the National Honours and Awards Act, Belize established three national orders on 16 August 1991: the Order of Belize, the Order of Distinction, and the Order of the National Hero. The monarch's representative, the governor-general serves as chancellor of all these orders.\nThe Crown and the Defence Force\nThe Crown sits at the pinnacle of the Belize Defence Force. The monarch is the Commander-in-Chief of the entire Forces. The Crown of St. Edward appears on Belize Defence Force badges and rank insignia, which illustrates the monarchy as the locus of authority.\nUnder the Belizean Defence Act, every member of the Belize Defence Force must swear allegiance to the monarch of Belize, on taking office. The current oath is:\nThe Crown and the Police Force\nfeaturing the Crown]]\nEvery member of the Belize Police Department has to swear allegiance to the monarch of Belize, on taking office. Under the Police Act of Belize, every police officer must make the following declaration on joining the Department:\nAll riot proclamations are also issued in the monarch's name and end with the phrase \"God Save the King\".\nSt Edward's Crown is used on the badge of the Belize Police Department, and is incorporated into the rank insignias for commissioner, senior superintendent, and superintendent.\nRoyal symbols\nThe main symbol of the Belizean monarchy is the sovereign himself. Thus, framed portraits of him are displayed in public buildings and government offices. Many Belizeans also keep portraits of the royal family in their homes. Queen Elizabeth II appeared on some commemorative Belizean stamps. Her crowned effigy is prominently featured on Belizean coins. All banknotes of the Belize dollar featured the Queen's portrait until the introduction of a new series in 2025.\nA crown is also used to illustrate the monarchy as the locus of authority, appearing on police force, postal workers, prison officers, and Belize Defence Force regimental and maritime badges and rank insignia.\nGod Save the King is the royal anthem of Belize.\nRoyal visits\n20th century\nPrincess Margaret visited Belize in 1958. The Duke of Edinburgh visited in 1962. Prince Michael of Kent represented the Queen at the independence celebrations in September 1981.\nElizabeth II, Queen of Belize, visited the country in October 1985. She was welcomed by the mayor and given the key to Belize City. She spent the night in Government House before flying to Dangriga the following day where she watched a Junkanoo Dance by children and received a painting from the people of the Stann Creek District. She also met British Servicemen and women stationed in Belize. During the visit, the Queen was served the famous gibnut during an official dinner. The next day, the British press in London ran headlines: \"Queen Eats Rat in Belize\". Ever since, the gibnut has often been referred to as \"The Royal Rat\", or \"The Queen's Rat\" in Belize.\n| salign=right| source=Elizabeth II of Belize, 1985}}\nThe Duke of Edinburgh returned in 1988 for a solo visit in his capacity as President of the World Wide Fund for Nature.\nThe Queen visited again in 1994. On her arrival at the airport in Belize City, she was greeted by 90% of the city's population. The Queen also visited the towns of San Ignacio, Punta Gorda, and Cahal Pech, one of Belize's many Mayan archaeological sites. The Queen attended a special sitting of the National Assembly, where she addressed the body for the first time and spoke of Belize's \"robust democracy\". The Queen also noted in her speech that this was the first occasion in which she had been welcomed by a song both written and performed by a governor-general.| salign=right| source=Prince Henry of Wales, 2012}}\nThe Princess Royal visited Belize in April 2001. The Princess visited the National Assembly of Belize at Belmopan, and the Belize Defence Force, Price Barracks, Ladyville, Belize City. During her visit, The Princess also visited San Lazaro Village Roman Catholic Primary School at Orange Walk, the Mennonite Community at Blue Creek Village, the Rio Bravo Conservation and Management Area, Marla's House of Hope, NOPCA Saves – Children's Home (National Organisation for the Prevention of Child Abuse), Belize Zoo, and the Commonwealth War Graves at Lord's Ridge Cemetery at Belize City.\nIn 2012, Prince Harry visited on the Queen's behalf to mark her Diamond Jubilee. During his visit, the Prince visited the remains of the ancient Mayan city of Xunantunich, launched a canoe named in honour of the Queen, and attended officially naming of the 'Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II Boulevard' in Belmopan.| salign=right| source=The Duke of Cambridge, 2022}}\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited in March 2022 on the occasion of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. During their visit, the couple visited Mayan sites, explored Belize's Maya chocolate making, and celebrated the culture of the Garifuna community in Hopkins. The Duke and Duchess also learned about the restoration efforts of Belize's barrier reef being led by communities across the country, and scuba-dived to learn more about the second-largest barrier reef in the world. At the reception hosted by Governor-General Dame Froyla Tzalam in celebration of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee, the Duke said, \"Now we know why Belize is so lovingly referred to as the Jewel. We hope to return again soon and to show our children this wonderful country. They are rather jealous that they're not here with us now\". A visit to a Maya village in southern Belize was also planned, but was cancelled due to local protests.\nDebate\nIn March 2022, the government of Belize set up the People's Constitutional Commission to review the laws of Belize, including the constitution, as well as the way the country is governed. Prime Minister Johnny Briceño has said that he will bring about a referendum on the commission's broad recommendations, which are due in 2024.\nIn May 2023, Briceño suggested that it was \"quite likely\" that Belize would be the next Commonwealth realm to become a republic. Briceño did not say if he would introduce a bill for a referendum on becoming a republic, which would need parliamentary approval.\nAn opinion poll conducted in February and March 2023 found that 48 per cent of respondents supported the continuation of Belize's monarchy, against 43 per cent who supported a republic. Seventy one per cent of those who stated they preferred to keep the Crown said the monarchy was a \"good thing\" for the country.\nList of Belizean monarchs\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Portrait\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20%;\"| Regnal name(Birth–Death)\n! colspan=2   | Reign over Belize\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Full name\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Consort\n! rowspan=\"2\" | House\n|-\n!Start\n!End\n|- style=\"background:#eee;\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |Elizabeth II(1926–2022)\n|21 September 1981\n|8 September 2022\n|Elizabeth Alexandra Mary\n|Philip Mountbatten\n|Windsor\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |Governors-general: Dame Elmira Minita Gordon, Sir Colville Young, Dame Froyla TzalamPrime ministers: George Cadle Price, Sir Manuel Esquivel, Said Musa, Dean Barrow, Johnny Briceño\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#eee;\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |Charles III(b. 1948)\n|8 September 2022\n|present\n|Charles Phillip Arthur George\n|Camilla Shand\n|Windsor\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |Governors-general: Dame Froyla TzalamPrime ministers: Johnny Briceño\n|}\nSee also\n* Lists of office-holders\n* List of prime ministers of Elizabeth II\n* List of prime ministers of Charles III\n* List of Commonwealth visits made by Elizabeth II\n* Monarchies in the Americas\n* List of monarchies\nFootnotes\nExternal links\n* [http://www.royal.uk/belize/ Belize] at The Royal Family website\n* [https://archive.today/20070712194912/http://www.governmentofbelize.gov.bz/exec_govgeneral.html Government of Belize: Governor-General of Belize]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110720103800/http://www.belize.gov.bz/public/Attachment/98202443271.pdf Constitution of Belize]\n}}"
