Since making her professional music debut in 1987 Garbi has released 20 studio albums: Prova (1989), Gyalia Karfia (1990), Entalma Silepseos (1991), Tou Feggariou Anapnoes (1992), Os Ton Paradeiso (1993), Atofio Hrysafi (1994), Arhizo Polemo (1996), Evaisthisies (1997), Hristougenna Me Tin Katy (1998), Doro Theou (1999), To Kati (2000), Apla Ta Pragmata (2001), Emmones Idees (2003), Eho Sta Matia Ourano (2005), Pos Allazei O Kairos (2006), Kainourgia Ego (2008), Pazl (2011), Buona Vita (2013), Perierges Meres (2013), Spase Tous Deiktes (2017). Garbi has also released two live albums: 18 Hronia Live (2007) and 30 Hronia Katy Garbi (Live Katrakio 2019) (2020). Garbi had her biggest commercial success with Arhizo Polemo and Evaisthisies, two of the highest selling albums of the 1990s (decade), followed by the double To Kati, which is one of the best-selling albums of the 2000s (decade) in Greece. Her albums have been released on Sony Music Entertainment Greece (1989–2009, 2013), Universal Music Greece (2010–2013) and Panik Platinum (2016–present). She has released material on Incipit Records, Front Seat, Planetworks and 2645 Records.\nGarbi began her music career as a duo with her sister, Liana Garbi as Adelfes Garbi. Breaking away from the duo, Garbi featured on compilation albums Ta Deka Dekaria Vol 1 and Vol 2, which were followed by her debut solo album Prova. In 1992, Garbi's fourth album Tou Feggariou Anapnoes was certified gold and spawned Garbi's first commercial hit \"Pes To M'Ena Fili\". This led to her participating in the Eurovision Song Contest 1993 with \"Ellada, Hora Tou Fotos\", taking 9th place. The same year Garbi began collaborating with songwriter Phoebus in a partnership that resulted in 1 gold, 1 platinum and 3 multi-platinum albums.\nGarbi's popularity culminated in the mid-1990s early-2000s (decade), becoming a prominent performer of the laiko-pop genre reigning at the time. The first annual music awards were materialized in Greece with the launch of the Pop Corn Music Awards; in 1997 Garbi won four awards for her album Arhizo Polemo. She was awarded album of the year and song of the year in 1999, for album Evaisthisies and its title track, respectively. Garbi has also received one Arion Music Award, and received two honorary MAD Video Music Award for her 30 years of discography in 2019 and for outstanding contribution to the Greek music industry in 2022 citing sales in excess of 2,000,000. She has been nominated for awards in laïko, contemporary laïko, pop, and dance categories and has won 12 recognized awards from over 45 nominations.\nThis list includes only recognized awards and not polls and other awards. Also, the list may be incomplete due to the lack of sources on Greek awards prior to the new 2000 millennium.\nArion Music Awards\nThe Arion Music Awards are the official Greek music industry awards by IFPI Greece since 2002, after the Pop Corn Music Awards, which were organized by the Greek magazine Pop Corn from 1992–2001, were discontinued. The Arion Awards were broadcast by Mega Channel in their first five years before moving to ANT1 channel. The awards have not been held since 2007 for various reasons. Katy Garbi has won one award, in a tie with Natasa Theodoridou from five nominations.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" align=\"center\"|2002\n|  rowspan=\"5\" |Katy Garbi\n| Female Singer of the Year\n|\n|-\n| Best Female for Laïko\n|\n|-\n| Best Female for Modern Laïko\n|\n|-\n| align=\"center\"|2004\n| Best Female for Modern Laïko\n|\n|-\n| align=\"center\"|2006\n| Best Female for Laïko\n|\n|-\nEurovision awards\nThe Eurovision Song Contest is an annual competition held among active member countries of the EBU.
