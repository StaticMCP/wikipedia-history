It premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on June 10, 2021 and won the Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject).\nSummary\nLusia Harris reflects on her time as a college basketball star, during which she and her team, Delta State University, won three national championships, and she won a silver medal with the United States women's national basketball team at the 1976 Summer Olympics. Her playing career ended after her graduation, as the WNBA would not be founded until 1996; she was offered the unique opportunity to try out for the New Orleans Jazz (later Utah Jazz) of the NBA, but turned it down, preferring to concentrate on raising a family. She would then return to Delta State University as head coach of their women's team.\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Award\n! Date of ceremony\n! Category\n!
