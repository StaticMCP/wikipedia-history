The peak is the second highest thirteener (a peak between 13,000 and 13,999 feet in elevation) in the state.  It is located in the La Garita Mountains, sub-range of the San Juan Mountains, in Saguache County, within the La Garita Wilderness.  Stewart Peak is the 55th highest peak in Colorado by most standard definitions, just missing the list of Colorado fourteeners.  At one time, the peak's elevation was measured to be over 14,000&nbsp;ft and it was believed to be a fourteener, but more recent and accurate surveys have dropped it below that threshold.\nClimate\n(1991–2020 normals)\n|single line = y\n|Jan high F = 23.7\n|Feb high F = 23.5\n|Mar high F = 28.7\n|Apr high F = 34.2\n|May high F = 42.7\n|Jun high F = 54.3\n|Jul high F = 59.1\n|Aug high F = 56.8\n|Sep high F = 51.1\n|Oct high F = 41.1\n|Nov high F = 30.4\n|Dec high F = 23.7\n|Jan mean F = 12.2\n|Feb mean F = 11.7\n|Mar mean F = 16.3\n|Apr mean F = 21.4\n|May mean F = 30.1\n|Jun mean F = 40.6\n|Jul mean F = 45.8\n|Aug mean F = 44.1\n|Sep mean F = 38.4\n|Oct mean F = 28.9\n|Nov mean F = 19.3\n|Dec mean F = 12.6\n|Jan low F = 0.7\n|Feb low F = -0.1\n|Mar low F = 4.0\n|Apr low F = 8.7\n|May low F = 17.5\n|Jun low F = 26.9\n|Jul low F = 32.4\n|Aug low F = 31.3\n|Sep low F = 25.7\n|Oct low F = 16.8\n|Nov low F = 8.2\n|Dec low F = 1.5\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 3.33\n|Feb precipitation inch = 3.59\n|Mar precipitation inch = 3.90\n|Apr precipitation inch = 4.60\n|May precipitation inch = 2.45\n|Jun precipitation inch = 0.99\n|Jul precipitation inch = 2.96\n|Aug precipitation inch = 3.21\n|Sep precipitation inch = 2.68\n|Oct precipitation inch = 3.21\n|Nov precipitation inch = 3.72\n|Dec precipitation inch = 3.39\n|source=PRISM Climate Group\n}}\nHistory\nThe first recorded ascent was on September 23, 1879, by the surveying party of Emmanuel Lee McNider on behalf of the U.S. government.\nSee also\n*List of Colorado mountain ranges\n*List of Colorado mountain summits\n**List of Colorado fourteeners\n**List of Colorado 4000 meter prominent summits\n**List of the most prominent summits of Colorado\n*List of Colorado county high points\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links"
