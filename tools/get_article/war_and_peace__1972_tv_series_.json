This 20-episode series began on 28 September 1972. The BBC dramatisation of Tolstoy's epic story of love and loss set against the backdrop of the Napoleonic Wars. Anthony Hopkins heads the cast as Pierre Bezukhov, Morag Hood is Natasha Rostova, Alan Dobie is Andrei Bolkonsky and David Swift is Napoleon, whose decision to invade Russia in 1812 has far-reaching consequences for each of them and their families.\nThe twenty-part serial was produced by David Conroy and directed by John Davies. Conroy's aim was to transfer the characters and plot from Tolstoy's novel to television drama to run for a duration of 15 hours. Scripted by Jack Pulman, this version of War and Peace contained battle sequences, which were filmed in Yugoslavia. The theme tune is the Russian imperial anthem, played by the band of the Welsh Guards.\nHopkins received the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor for his performance, and the production designer Don Homfray won a BAFTA for his work on the series.\nProduction\nWar and Peace followed the success of such literary adaptations as The Forsyte Saga (BBC2, 1967).\nCharlie Knode designed the costumes.\nThe production took three years (1969–1972) and involved location filming in SR Serbia of Yugoslavia and at English stately homes. Several scenes were shot at Petrovaradin Fortress in Novi Sad. Soldiers of the Yugoslav Territorial Defense appeared as extras in battle scenes.\nCast\n*Anthony Hopkins as Pierre Bezukhov\n*Alan Dobie as Andrei Nikolayevich Bolkonsky\n*Morag Hood as Natasha Rostova\n*Angela Down as Maria Bolkonskaya\n*Rupert Davies as Count Ilya Rostov\n*Faith Brook as Countess Natalie Rostova\n*David Swift as Napoleon Bonaparte\n*Frank Middlemass as Mikhail Kutuzov\n*Sylvester Morand as Nikolai Rostov\n*Joanna David as Sonya\n*Harry Locke as Platon Karataev\n*Donald Douglas as Tsar Alexander I of Russia\n*John Cazabon as Barclay de Tolly\n*Fiona Gaunt as Hélène Kuragina, wife of Pierre Bezukhov\n*Anthony Jacobs as Prince Nikolay Bolkonsky, father of Andrei and Marya\n*Athene Fielding as Mademoiselle Bourienne, companion to Marya\n*Barnaby Shaw and Rufus Frampton as Petya Rostov\n*Peter Bathurst as Pfuhl\n*Morris Perry as Joseph Fouché\n*Geoffrey Morris as Napoleon's secretary\n*Michael Gover as General Balashev\n*Toby Bridge as young Nikolenka Bolkonsky\n*Neil Stacy as Boris Drubetskoy\n*Anne Blake as Princess Drubetskoya\n*Gary Watson as Denisov\n*Donald Burton as Dolokhov\n*Tony Steedman as Marshal Davout\n*Joseph Wise as Russian officer\n*Colin Baker as Anatole Kuragin\n*Basil Henson as Prince Vasili Kuragin\n*Josie Kidd as Katishe\n*James Appleby as German adjutant\n*Gerard Hely as Prince Murat\n*Michael Billington as Lt.

The length—almost fifteen hours—meant the series could include scenes, like the wolf hunt, or Denisov dancing the mazurka, that are dramatically superfluous but thematically vital. The acting is inspired, in part because the casting was inspired, from Anthony Hopkins, as Pierre, to David Swift, as a pint-sized, swaggering Napoleon. Everyone looks just the way he or she's supposed to look.\"\nClive James criticised some performances: \"I was cruel to Morag Hood when I said that her performance made me want to throw a tarpauline over her and peg down the corners. I should have blamed the director, who had obviously told her to bounce up and down at all times in order to convey exuberance. [...] In that same production, Alan Dobie as Andrei was grim enough to send you to sleep, but Anthony Hopkins was a perfect Pierre: a real tribute to his acting, because his default mode is to be in command.\"\nPaul Mavis (DVD Talk) awarded it 4 stars, saying, \"It positively luxuriates in its expansive format, giving the viewer a remarkable chance to fully experience the various nuances of character and the myriad permutations of shifting relationships (as well as Tolstoy's numerous plot coincidences) that mark this mammoth work.\" He praised Alan Dobie as \"uniformed in Byronic splendor [...] spot-on as the dour, heroic, closed-off Andrei Bolkonsky\", also praising Angela Down (Maria) and Sylvester Morand (Nikolai). However, he criticised Hood's performance, saying, \"the casting of Morag Hood (which, according to the production history included in this DVD set, was a desperate, last-minute decision) is a distressing misfire. [...] poor Hood can't begin to approach the character with even a modicum of believability. Natasha begins the story as a wild, impetuous girl of thirteen - an age and a temperament that Hood evidently felt needed to be delineated by having Natasha laugh insanely at everything while leaping about like a mad thing (Hood is also far too old to be a believable 13-year-old). As for later maturing into this bewitching, erotic little beauty whom all men adore, either an actress has that innate, inexplicable quality or they don't - you can't 'act' that powerful allure onto the screen. It has to come from within, and simply put, Hood doesn't have it.\"\nAndrew D. Kaufman, in his book Give War and Peace a Chance: Tolstoyan Wisdom for Troubled Times said that this version had \"much to recommend\", although he preferred the 1966–67 Soviet film. James Monaco called it \"easily the best adaptation [...] in any medium\" in How to Read a Film: The World of Movies, Media, Multimedia: Language, History, Theory (1977).\nDVD release\nThe series was released in a Region 2 4-DVD boxset by DD Home Entertainment in 2005. The set is accompanied by an illustrated booklet, written by Andy Priestner, which provides a detailed account of how the series was made. In 2009 Simply Home Entertainment released a 5-disc edition with 200 production stills.\nSee also\n*War and Peace (1956 film), version directed by King Vidor\n*War and Peace (1966–67 film), Soviet-produced version, directed by Sergei Bondarchuk\n*War & Peace (2016 TV series)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00tl07n/episodes/guide  List of War and Peace episodes at BBC Programmes]"
