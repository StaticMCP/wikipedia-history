It is located on Highway 14, approximately  southeast of Sherwood Park on the south-west shore of Cooking Lake.\nOverview\nPrior to the arrival of European settlers, the South Cooking Lake region was inhabited by many Indigenous peoples, including the Cree, Blackfoot and the Sarcee. The name South Cooking Lake is a rough translation of the Cree name for the lake, O-pi-mi-w-sioo-Sakyakn (Here's Where We Cook Lake or Cooking Lake).\nIn 1891, the first settlers arrived at South Cooking Lake and began to farm the area. By 1894, Cooking Lake began attracting visitors from nearby settlements including Edmonton for recreational purposes, with large scale recreational infrastructure being developed by 1900. Popular activities included sailing, swimming, and picnicking. Large numbers of game including lynx, fox, mink, muskrat, elk, deer, moose, wolves, coyotes, and black bears drew sportsmen to the area, while the lake's plentiful fish stocks led it be fished commercially until 1926.\nRecreational villages composed of summer cottages, including at South Cooking Lake, quickly developed around Cooking Lake. The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway connecting Edmonton to Winnipeg was even specifically routed to run close to South Cooking Lake to permit greater access to the lake for city residents. Special trains were also run on weekends to ferry passengers.\nAlthough a predominantly summer village community, permanent residents of South Cooking Lake steadily grew and in 1923 the South Cooking Lake Community League was founded.\nToday it is still possible to see a variety of wildlife and birds throughout the area. There is a day-use park, which is a great place for family picnics, boating, and windsurfing. There is a boat launch, walking trails, picnic sites, and waterfowl viewing areas. The community hall has been completely renovated and is available for rent.\nDemographics\nThe population of South Cooking Lake according to the 2024 municipal census conducted by Strathcona County is 291, a |277|1}} change from its 2022 municipal census population count of 277.\nIn the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, South Cooking Lake had a population of 288 living in 133 of its 138 total private dwellings, a change of |241|1}} from its 2016 population of 241.
