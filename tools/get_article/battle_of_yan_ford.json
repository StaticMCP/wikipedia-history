The lookout first reported five to six hundred enemy cavalry on their way, then reported that there were slightly more cavalry than before and the size of the infantry force was beyond measurement. At this point Cao Cao stopped the lookout from reporting, and had his horsemen undo the saddles and release the horses.\nThe baggage train from Boma appeared on the road north of the dyke at this time, in plain view of Yuan Shao's men. Some of Cao Cao's officers became uneasy at the prospect of so many enemy horsemen, and suggested to return and defend the camp. Cao Cao's strategist Xun You objected, saying: \"This is the way we bait the enemy! How can we leave?\" Cao Cao glanced at him and smiled.\nWen Chou and Liu Bei, commanders of Yuan Shao's cavalry, leading five to six thousand cavalry, came one after the other. Cao Cao's men asked to mount their horses, but Cao Cao denied them until Yuan Shao's horsemen, ever increasing in number, split off to raid the baggage train. Cao Cao then gave the permission to mount the horses, and all of Cao Cao's horsemen, led by Zhang Liao and Xu Huang while being less than 600 in number, jumped onto their horses and charged at the enemy. Yuan Shao's army was defeated and Wen Chou was killed in action.\nAftermath\nYan Liang and Wen Chou were the most highly regarded generals in Yuan Shao's army, and both were killed in two successive battles. Yuan Shao's men became greatly shaken.\nWith the victory at Yan Ford, Cao Cao was able to retreat back to his base in Guandu (官渡; northeast of present-day Zhongmu County, Henan) with the men and supplies without incident. Yuan Shao followed close behind and made camp at Yangwu (陽武; near present-day Yuanyang County, Henan), immediately north of Guandu. He had ignored Ju Shou's advice to leave a garrison at Yan Ford as a cautious step, and had all his forded forces concentrated at Yangwu, and now a decisive battle became imminent.\nIn Romance of the Three Kingdoms\nThe Battle of Yan Ford was the opening event in chapter 26 of the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms.\nThe battle described in the novel closely followed the one in history until Cao Cao made the call to charge at Wen Chou's forces. At that time Zhang Liao and Xu Huang, two of Cao Cao's best generals, gave chase. Wen Chou fired two arrows from atop his horse, one of which sliced off the feather on Zhang Liao's helmet and the other hit Zhang Liao's horse in the face. Brandishing his poleaxe, Xu Huang came for Wen Chou but had to retreat when a band of enemy soldiers came to their commander's rescue.\nLeading a dozen riders, Guan Yu then cut off Wen Chou's escape and engaged in a duel with the enemy. Within three bouts, Wen Chou attempted to flee. However, Guan Yu's horse, the Red Hare, was of a superior breed and soon caught up. Guan Yu then slew Wen Chou from behind.\nNotes\nReferences\n*de Crespigny, Rafe.
