The site became a  state park in 1946; it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.\nDescription\nThe Beckley Furnace stands in what is now a rural area of central North Canaan, on the south side of Lower Road just west of its junction with Furnace Hill Road.  The site spans the Blackberry River, with the main blast furnace and its developed features on the north bank.  The main furnace is a large stone structure,  tall and  per side at the base, gradually sloping to  at the top.  It is set near the road, which runs at a high elevation above a stone retaining wall.  About  upriver is the dam, a stone structure with a penstock providing access to a turbine chamber.  Further downstream are the remnants of two more dams and furnaces, and there are large piles of slag mounded on the south side of the river.  No longer extant are wood-frame buildings that would have been needed to support the operations of the furnace.\nHistory\nThe furnace was built for the production of pig iron by John Adam Beckley in 1847 and continued in operation until 1919. It was the second of three working blast furnaces built at the site; a fourth furnace was under construction in the early years of the 20th century but was never put in operation.  The works successfully adapted to changing conditions, but was unable to compete on scale, and closed in the early 1920s. The stack was restored by the state in 1999. The dam built on the Blackberry River to provide power for the furnace and other industrial operations was repaired by the state in 2010.\nActivities and amenities\nThe state park offers picnicking and pond fishing. Tours of the furnace are offered periodically by Friends of Beckley Furnace.\n}}\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140321094104/http://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=2716&q=325172 Beckley Furnace Industrial Monument] Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection\n*[http://beckleyfurnace.org/ Friends of Beckley Furnace]"
