This was the first major battle fought after the formation of the Khalsa.\nBackground\nThe neighboring Hill chiefs began to despise the Guru over his growing popularity. Sikhs were also frequently ambushed and attack by the men of the Raja and which caused unrest between the Sikhs and Rajas.\nBattle\nOn the 23rd of June 1699, the Guru was on a hunting trip in the Dun when Balia Chand and Alim Chand, two hill kings, seeing him with only a small retinue, launched a surprise attack in a bid to capture the Guru. The combined forces of the 2 kings far outnumbered the Sikhs. Soon, reinforcements under Bhai Uday Singh reached and the tables were turned. Alam Chand had his right hand cut off by Alam Singh Nachna and fled from the battlefield. Balia Chand was shot by Udai Singh and died. The hill troops, demoralized by the retreat and death of their generals, the kings retreated.\nAftermath\nThe defeat of the 2 kings unnerved the hill Rajas, who met in a council and decided to send a letter to the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb for help. Then the Mughals fought the Sikhs in the Battle of Anandpur (1700).\nSee also\n* Nihang\n* Martyrdom and Sikhism\nReferences"
