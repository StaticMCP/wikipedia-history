This battle was fought on December 4, 1864, the forces of the Dominican Liberation Army commanded by Major General José María Cabral ambushed the Spanish royal army under the command of Colonel Herrera.\nThis victory of the Dominican forces was the only confrontation of some importance won by the Dominican independentists, representing a triumph after August and September 1863.\nEvents\nInvasion of Neiba\nDuring the first days of December, Field Marshal Eusebio Puello, Governor of Azua, received a report in which the inhabitants of Neiba were supposedly regretful for their insurgency and wanted to once again recognise the authority of Spain. Puello, driven by his Spanish patriotism and good will, sent a small column to capture the city. However, when his troops arrived at the town, they discovered that it was completely abandoned, and as if they were to continue there according to the instructions they had, they needed more rations than they were carrying. The head of the Spanish troops had a group go to Azua to get rations and there a convoy of pack animals with provisions was organized, which left escorted by 80 peninsulars and 30 Dominicans (according to José de la Gándara there were 50 men from the first provisional battalion) who were to reach Fondo Negro.\nAmbush by José María Cabral\nOn December 4, 1864, on the mountain of La Canela (now Galván) located between the towns of El Rodeo and Cambronal at 3:00 in the afternoon, the Spanish convoy was ambushed by the independence forces made up of 600 men under General José María Cabral. The Spanish forces, although they were surprised by the attack, struggled against the Dominicans and felt the security of their aim. Unfortunately, the battle took place in open field and the situation strategically favored the insurgents because they were at a higher altitude. In the afternoon the Spaniards, already without ammunition, began the retreat towards Azua and the independentists obtained 11 prisoners of war, 40 mules and much of the weapons along with ammunition.\nWithdrawal of Spanish forces\nThe Spanish chief, who was waiting for rations in Neiba, soon received news of what had happened in La Canela and that the separatists, considering his return to Azua indispensable, were waiting for him in ambushes at the Cambronal pass. Being isolated and short of supplies, at night he made a quick march in the opposite direction and was able to get his soldiers out of the very compromised situation in which they found themselves. After the Spanish defeat, Neyba was again besieged by the Dominicans and placed under their control on December 5, 1864.\nSee also\n*José María Cabral\n*Battle of Sabana Burro\n*Dominican Restoration War\nReferences"
