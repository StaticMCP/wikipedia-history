Following a boundary review, the size of the council was reduced from 57 to 49 members for this election.  No elections were held in Milton Keynes, which is a unitary authority outside the area covered by the County Council.  The council continues to be administered on the Leader and Cabinet model. The Conservative Party won a reduced majority on the council.\nAll locally registered electors (British, Irish, Commonwealth and European Union citizens) who were aged 18 or over on Thursday 2 May 2013 were entitled to vote in the local elections. Those who were temporarily away from their ordinary address (for example, away working, on holiday, in student accommodation or in hospital) were also entitled to vote in the local elections, although those who had moved abroad and registered as overseas electors cannot vote in the local elections. It is possible to register to vote at more than one address (such as a university student who had a term-time address and lives at home during holidays) at the discretion of the local Electoral Register Office, but it remains an offence to vote more than once in the same local government election.\nSummary\nSuffering the loss of 335 of 1451 councillors in simultaneous elections across England, the Conservative Party won 36 seats, and saw their majority on the council cut from 17 seats to 11. Meanwhile, the main opposition group on the council altered from the Liberal Democrats to UKIP who won their highest percentage of the vote since their 1993 formation, at 27%. The Labour Party won its first seat here since the 2005 election, in Buckingham West. Seven of twelve Liberal Democrats lost their seats, to Conservative, UKIP and Labour candidates. An independent candidate won the West Wycombe electoral division that replaced Stokenchurch, Radnage & West Wycombe.\nResults\n|}\nThe overall turnout was 30.2% with a total of 116,182 valid votes cast.
