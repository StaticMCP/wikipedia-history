The name was chosen when the Beatrixlaan was renewed. Officially this area is the strip of buildings along the Utrechtsebaan from Nationale Nederlanden to the Palace of Justice. Besides Nationale Nederlanden, many large international companies such as KPN, Siemens, PostNL, Sdu, Deloitte, Q8 and MN Services are located here.\nThe Beatrixkwartier also hosts the World Trade Center The Hague in the Prinsenhof building.\nThe central axis of the quarter is the Prinses Beatrixlaan along with the Beatrixkwartier RandstadRail station halfway past the Netkous viaduct, which opened on October 29, 2006. Furthermore, the neighborhood is intersected by the A12 motorway.\nBuildings\n{| width=\"left\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"table-layout:fixed;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n* CentreCourt\n* Prinsenhof\n* Haagse Poort\n* Beatrixpark\n* Monarch\n|\n* Siemens building\n* KPN building\n* Silver Tower\n* Green Tower\n|}\nReferences"
