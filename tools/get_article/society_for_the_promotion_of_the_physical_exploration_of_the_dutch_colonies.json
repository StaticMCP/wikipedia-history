To that end, from the late 19th century to the eve of World War II, the Society equipped expeditions to explore Dutch overseas territories.\nA number of famous classical and exploration trips to, among other Borneo and Dutch New Guinea were developed by and under the auspices of the Society and the Indian Committee for Scientific Investigations, a sister organisation in Batavia, Dutch East Indies.\nIn the early 21st century, the society is now known as \"The Treub Society\" after its founder, Melchior Treub.\nMain expeditions\n* 1899-1900 - The Siboga Expedition of Max Weber\n* 1903 - The North New Guinea Expedition of A.
