Aleksander is a branch of Vurka, as Shraga Fayvel Danciger was a leading disciple of Rabbi Israel Yitzhak Kalish of Vurka. Prior to the Holocaust, Aleksander was the second-largest Hasidic group in Poland. They attracted artisans, merchants and water carriers rather than elite Talmudic scholars and richer people who were attracted to Ger. Like the rest of Polish Jewry, almost all of Aleksander hasidim were murdered in the Holocaust. Between the world wars, Hasidic Jews from all over flocked to the small village of Aleksander to spend the holiest days of the Jewish year in the presence of their spiritual leader, their rebbe, Rabbi Yitzchak Menachem Danciger (1879–1942). The Rebbe of Aleksander attempted to remain neutral in political issues while emphasizing communal prayer and the study of Torah. He was murdered by the Germans on September 5, 1942, eight days before Rosh Hashanah, at Treblinka extermination camp. Today, Aleksander has emerged from the ashes of the Holocaust and continues growing in numbers in small communities in America, Europe and Israel (including a small, but growing community in Melbourne, Australia).\nHistory\n, 1930s]]\nThe founder of the dynasty of Aleksander was Rabbi Yechiel Dancyger (1828–1894), son of Rabbi Fayvl from Gritse, a disciple of Israel Yitzhak Kalish of Vurke.\nHis son, Yerachmiel Yisroel Yitzchok Dancyger (1853–1910), was even more famous, and accumulated a large group of followers. He was the author of Yismach Yisrael (Hebrew: \"Israel will Rejoice\", 1911), which he wrote together with his brother, Shmuel Tsvi (1860–1923), who later succeeded him and authored the Tiferes Shmuel. The teachings of the rebbes who followed stressed ethics, mysticism and ecstatic religious forms, putting less emphasis on studying the Talmud.\nThe followers of the rebbes from Aleksander were primarily merchants and artisans, especially from Warsaw, and also in Łódź, where there were approximately 35 houses of prayer and study. There were also shtiblekh in numerous other towns, including Bełchatów, Opoczno, and Piotrków. In 1914 his brother Betsalel Yoir (1856–1934) began to serve as a rebbe in Łódź, thus starting a second branch of Alexander. After Shmuel Tsvi's death, the dynasty was continued by his son, Yitzchok Menachem Mendel Dancyger (1880–1943), whose accomplishments included the expansion of religious schools in Łódź and in Aleksander. Unlike many chasidic leaders of that period, he was not interested in politics. During the Second World War, he was in the Warsaw Ghetto. Refusing to leave for the Land of Israel, he died along with his family in Treblinka. Nowadays, the community of chasidim of Aleksander exists mainly in Israel, but there are several synagogues (shtiblekh) in Boro Park, Monsey, Lakewood, Cleveland, Antwerp, London, and Zürich.\nFile:Dormitory of M.

He was a prolific writer and published a number of works, including Responsa Hashava Letava (Lodz, 1933) and another volume that contained two works: Kedushat Yitzhak and Nahalat Zvi (Jerusalem, 1952)—the former on the hasidic masters who precipitated Aleksander Hassidism, and the latter as commentary on the weekly Torah portion. Rabbi Yehuda Moshe also spoke to survivors and collated their recollections of pre-war Aleksanderism in Meoran Shel Yisrael (Bnei Brak, 1971). His main collection of thoughts on the Torah and the festivals was published posthumously under the title Emunat Moshe (Bnei Brak, 1976–1991).\nRabbi Yehuda Moshe was succeeded by his son Rabbi Avraham Menahem Dancyger (1921–2005), whose hasidic insights are currently being printed under the title Imrei Menahem. Over the tenure of his thirty two years as Rebbe, R' Avraham Menachem expanded the Aleksander community in four countries, and built a seven-story yeshiva in the Slabodka neighborhood of Bnei Brak Israel. The yeshiva was the rebbes pride and joy, demonstrating a revival of the Aleksander Yeshiva system destroyed in the Holocaust. He died in 2005 shortly following the holiday of Purim.\nThe eldest son, Rabbi Yisroel Zvi Yoir Dancyger, was appointed Aleksander Rebbe in the will of his father in 2005. He has since expanded the Aleksander Hasidic court by building new institutions in Israel and abroad, and attracts many young followers from outside the chassidus. His younger brother, R' Shneur Zalman, established a synagogue in Cleveland Ohio which he runs together with his family to serve the local non-hasidic community.\nImportant Aleksander literature\nIn addition to learning the chassidic works revered by all groups, Aleksander chassidim learn Aleksander chassidus regularly, often in weekly classes on Thursday evenings in their synagogues. The Aleksander Dynasty has produced a number of classic texts that are revered throughout the Jewish world.\n* Yismach Yisroel – The fundamental text of Aleksander ideology.
