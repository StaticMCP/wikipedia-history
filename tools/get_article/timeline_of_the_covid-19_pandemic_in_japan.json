The National Institute of Infectious Diseases (Japan) (NIID) has determined from its genetic research that the COVID-19 variant of the first wave is derived from the Wuhan type that is prevalent in patients from China and East Asia.  After entering Japan in January through travellers and returnees from China, the virus resulted in numerous infection clusters across the country before moving towards its disappearance in March. Japanese medical surveillance confirmed its first case of the virus on 16 January in a resident of Kanagawa Prefecture who had returned from Wuhan.\nThe first wave was followed by a second one that originated from a COVID-19 variant of the European type that is traced back to early patients from France, Italy, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Japanese medical surveillance detected the second wave on 26 March when the government's expert panel concluded the likelihood of a new outbreak caused by travellers and returnees from Europe and the United States between 11 and 23 March.  The NIID has established that the majority of viruses spreading in Japan since March is the European type. This has led it to conclude that the data \"strongly suggests\" that the Japanese government has succeeded in containing the Wuhan variant and that it is the European variant that is spreading across the country.\nInitial outbreak (January–March 2020)\nJanuary 2020\nOn 16 January, Japan confirmed its first case of COVID-19 when a man in Kanagawa Prefecture who had previously travelled to Wuhan tested positive.\nOn 24 January, Tokyo Metropolis confirmed its first case of COVID-19.
