The tower on the right was 2 WTC.]]\nThe original World Trade Center, which featured the landmark Twin Towers (1 WTC and 2 WTC), was a building complex in the Financial District in Lower Manhattan, New York City. 1 and 2 World Trade Center – the North and South Tower – stood at  with 110-stories respectively, becoming the tallest buildings in the world from 1971 to 1973. The North Tower, with its antenna included, was the tallest building in the world by pinnacle height until the towers were destroyed in the September 11 attacks in 2001. An iconic feature of the New York City skyline for nearly three decades, the World Trade Center has been featured in cartoons, comic books, computer games, video games, television, films, photographs, artwork, and music videos.\nLiterature\nBooks\nIn Richard Martin Stern's novel The Tower (1973), a breeches buoy line shot from a helicopter is used to link the World Trade Center's North Tower to the neighboring (fictional and taller) \"World Tower Building,\" in order to rescue hundreds of people trapped by a fire. Dozens of people are saved by this method, before the breeches buoy is overwhelmed in a panic, and crashes to the ground below. The World Trade Center's Twin Towers appear on the cover of Wilt Chamberlain's 1991 reissue of his book A View From Above. Similarly, The World Trade Center can be seen on the cover of Anne Gutman and Georg Hallensleben's children's book Lisa in New York (The Misadventures of Gaspard and Lisa), which was published in 2002, a year after the building complex was destroyed. and in Godzilla: Monster Apocalypse, the prequel novel of Godzilla: Planet of the Monsters anime film, the giant mantis Kamacuras appeared in New York City in May 1999, and proceeded to destroy the World Trade Center and devastate much of the city, leaving 2.5 million casualties.\nThe Towers also appeared on the paperback cover of Bright Lights, Big City, Jay McInerney's iconic novel of 1980s New York. The book was published in September 1984 as the first original title from the newly created Vintage Contemporaries imprint.\nPhilippe Petit's tightrope walk in 1974 between the two towers is fictionalized in Colum McCann's novel of 1970s New York, Let the Great World Spin. The fall of the towers forms part of the plot of Ken Kalfus' novel A Disorder Peculiar to the Country, and the attack also appears on its paperback cover.\nComic books and graphic novels\nMost of the Marvel Comics' heroes reside in New York City, so views of the towers were not uncommon. The World Trade Center complex was featured in numerous other comics as well.\n* In 1985 The Uncanny X-Men #189 continued the alternate vision of the future first seen in the Days of Future Past story line. Rachel Summers (who came from the future), while describing the dire future of the early 21st century, says \"The Twin Towers of World Trade Center lie in ruins. Thousands are dead, many more injured\". The accompanying image is of a somewhat futuristic Twin Towers smoldering after having been hit by an unknown attack.\n* The 1986 graphic novel Rebel, by Pepe Moreno, depicted the two towers being destroyed in a post-apocalyptic 2002 setting.\n* In the 1989 Damage Control, the Twin Towers were damaged when a giant robot fell on them. Damage Control, a construction company that specialized in repairing superhero-related damage, had the towers repaired (although visibly crooked) by the end of the issue.\n* In the 1992 Mort & Phil comic El 35 aniversario (The 35th Anniversary) appears an image of a plane that crashes into the WTC.\n* Adventures of Superman #596 was coincidentally released one day after the September 11, 2001 attacks. It depicted, in passing, the World Trade Center (specifically the Twin Towers) as having been damaged but not destroyed by an alien attack (along with other world landmarks such as the White House, the Eiffel Tower, the Sydney Opera House, the Great Wall of China, Big Ben, and the in-universe LexCorp Building).  The issue's artist, Mike Wieringo, remarked, \"The book was completed months ago. The ironic thing is that the damage done by the terrorists is far greater than I could ever portray visually.\" The book's writer, Joe Casey, could not have intentionally referenced the attacks on the World Trade Center, but DC acknowledged that it mirrored the devastation so vividly that they made the books returnable without penalty to retailers. Many retailers took DC up on this offer, causing the issue to become sought after on the secondary market due to its rarity and general curiosity towards the real-life synchronicity with the 9-11 attacks.\n* Captain America vol. 4 #1 had Steve Rogers arguing with Nick Fury when the former decided to stay and find survivors before heading to Afghanistan.\n* Marvel Comics' Marvel Graphic Novel #17 depicts the Living Monolith standing almost as tall as the World Trade Center and thrusting his giant fist through one of the towers.\n* The 2004 comic Ex Machina detailed the life of Mitchell Hundred, formerly the world's first and only superhero, who was elected mayor of New York City in the wake of his saving hundreds of lives during the North Tower's collapse, and in preventing the South Tower's collapse.\n* The Amazing Spider-Man vol. 2 #36 showed the aftermath of the Towers’ collapse through the heroes’ eyes, more specifically Spider-Man's.\nThe Twin Towers of the World Trade Center have also been depicted in several online web comics:\n* Coming-of-age web comic \"Maddie in America\" vols. 2 and 3 are set at the original World Trade Center during November 1985, with the main characters staying at the Vista Hotel and visiting the Austin J. Tobin Plaza and the Windows on the World restaurant.\n* After Volume 5 of the spin-off series \"Outsiders\", the Twin Towers become a focal location of the series as the workplace of main character Siobhan Pattinson. She receives employment on the 103rd floor of the South Tower in the summer of 1987.\n* Artist Sebastian Utzni's \"M-Maybe\" collects pages from 18 Comics published between 1973 and 2001 depicting the destruction of the Twin Towers.\nTelevision\nCartoons and anime\n* In the 1985 cartoon M.A.S.K., an episode titled \"Attack on Liberty\" leads Matt Trakker to Miles Mayhem's current hideout – three quarters of the way up the side of the North Tower. Hovering the Thunderhawk outside the window, Matt leaps through the window and confronts Miles, who later escapes and is pursued by Matt around the Statue of Liberty. Mayhem's plot circulated around destroying the Statue and creating a 9/11-style incident.\n* In the 1986 animated series The Real Ghostbusters, in the episode \"The Boogeyman is Back\" the Twin Towers are the site of a battle between the Ghostbusters and a blue ghost. During the battle, Egon Spengler is caught in the ghost's crosshairs and hangs from one of the towers. He falls, but is saved by Winston Zeddemore in a flying chopper and brought back to the roof as the other Ghostbusters Ray Stantz and Peter Venkman capture the ghosts.\n* The Twin Towers were depicted as being part of the skyline of New York City in multiple episodes of the 1987 version of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon television series:\n** During the season three finale (\"The Big Blow Out\"), as the Technodrome rampages through New York, Krang uses the World Trade Center Towers as the basis of a conduit that will transmit enough energy to propel the earth into Dimension X, where Krang's spacefleet is waiting to destroy New York City.\n** The season two episode \"Enter: The Fly\", the TMNT are flying in their blimp over New York City, searching for Shredder. April O'Neil said that Shredder was seen on the roof on one of the two buildings, and the TMNT find Shredder and Baxter Stockman there.\n* In the 2000 MTV animated series Spy Groove, in the episode entitled \"Manhattan Glam Chowder\", the villain Mr. Fish is on top of the South Tower about to lure Agent #2 into a trap. Later Agent #1 appears on the North Tower and uses a laser to slice the antenna to make a bridge over to the South Tower. This episode did not air in the United States because the show was cancelled after six episodes. The episode can be found in Europe and Canada.\n* In the 1994 cartoon Fantastic Four an episode titled \"Incursion of the Skrull\" featured New York City with the Twin Towers getting destroyed and crumbled by the laser blasters by one of the Alien Skrulls jet planes during the invasion of New York, where people are panicking. It later turned out to be a handheld video game played by a superhero named \"The Thing.\" This episode was released seven years before 9/11.\n* In Futurama, there is a future WTC in New York with its appearance very similar to the old one, except for its skybridges. In the art for the Volume 1 DVD collection, they are shown as similar to the Petronas Towers.\n* In the 1994 animated series Gargoyles the Twin Towers are seen in a few episodes (such as the five-part pilot) as well as the third season opening of The Goliath Chronicles.

This episode aired seven years before 9/11.\n* In the animated sitcom The Simpsons:\n** In the season 9 episode titled \"The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson\" (1997), Homer is forced to deal with a mountain of parking tickets issued while his car sat illegally for months in the Austin J. Tobin plaza of the World Trade Center (an unrealistic event after the 1993 bombing, due to a bomb being placed inside a rental truck and parked in the garage in the basement). Homer, desperately needing to use the restroom, pushes people out of his way to get a ticket to the elevator into the towers. After pushing other people out of the elevator line to get to the top of the South Tower, Homer discovers the only working bathroom is in the North Tower. Also in the episode, two men in opposite towers begin arguing with each other, and one proclaims \"Sorry, they put all the jerks in Tower One\", a line which the show's creators expressed deep regret about during the post-9/11 episode commentary on the Season 9 box set. This episode has been banned in many countries (including some American affiliates around the time of the 9/11 attacks, though others have aired the episode with many edits to remove the scenes and verbal references to the World Trade Center), but is included in the season 9 box set.

The section of the New York City skyline containing the Twin Towers is absent, to reduce memory requirements for the map. The reason that the developers gave, if anyone asked, was that they had been destroyed by terrorists: ''\"We just said that the Towers had been destroyed too, and this was way before 9/11... years. That's kind of freaky.\"\n* Midnight Club: Street Racing (2000) features the entire WTC complex, where players can drive into the Austin Tobin Plaza in between the Twin Towers. They can also gain access to the underground parking garage beneath the World Trade Center (the site of the February 26, 1993 bombing).\n* Shortly after the attacks, the now defunct Westwood Studios pulled all remaining copies of the 2000 real-time strategy game Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2, whose box contained artwork of New York City under attack by invading Soviet forces; notable landmarks depicted under attack included the World Trade Center and the Statue of Liberty.

The Game Boy Advance, Android, and iOS versions re-inserted the towers.\n* In Trade Center Defender (2001), a flash-arcade game released on September 12, 2001, players had to shoot down planes that were heading towards the towers. If an aircraft managed to get through the buildings, the towers would pulverize. On September 13, the game was removed from sale over the internet. Lycos apologized for the game and pulled it from Angelfire arcade. By late September, the game was remade by French website Uzinagaz and was titled New York Defender. Unlike in the original game, the burning towers in the remake were made to look more realistic and similar to how they were destroyed during the actual disaster. New York Defender can still be found today in arcade and flash gaming websites.\n* Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (2001) featured a major plot on a ship going down the Hudson River, with the World Trade Center included.

A patch was also made available to remove the World Trade Center from the existing versions of the simulator.\n* In Grand Theft Auto III (2001), it is believed the World Trade Center was to make an appearance. Due to the city (Liberty City) being based on New York and the game being intended to be released in the autumn of 2001. Despite popular beliefs that the World Trade Center was entirely deleted and replaced with new buildings, the reality is the World Trade Center was never meant to be in the game, since Liberty City during this era was a mix between different American cities rather than being a New York parody. However, due to the attacks some changes were made to the final game; flight paths in game for the scripted plane AI were altered to fly farther away from the downtown area, a mission arc and character involving terrorism were removed, police cars were repainted to avoid resemblance to NYPD police cars, the player's ability to destroy commercial planes with rockets on the airport from the beta version was removed, and the game's cover in North America was changed to remove an explosion, creating the iconic cover that the franchise still carries to this day.\n* The 2002 video game Spider-Man, the first game adaptation of the film, has a cutscene featuring the World Trade Center towers outside of Norman Osborn's office where Spider-Man enters.\n* The 2004 video game Spider-Man 2, the game adaptation of the second film, features a virtual Manhattan which included a large plaza, bearing resemblance to the Tribute in Light memorial, on the World Trade Center site.\n* The 2005 video game True Crime: New York City features a fenced-off \"Ground Zero\".\n* In Tycoon City: New York (2006), the World Trade Center is paid tribute to in the form of two very tall trees standing side by side, representing the Towers.

The complex also features The Sphere sculpture, though unlike the real World Trade Center, a road divides the complex in two. In the game's latter half, set in 2006, the entire area is replaced by a fenced-off building site.\n* In World in Conflict (2007), the game's teaser trailer prominently features the skyline of New York City during a U.S. Ranger assault on Governor's Island, which has been occupied by the Soviets in an alternate timeline in which the Cold War culminates into World War III between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The game is set in an alternate 1989, 12 years before 9/11. In the tenth level, \"Liberty Lost\", the World Trade Center is featured prominently in the background during the player's efforts to recapture Governor's, Ellis, and Liberty Islands.\n* In Rhythm Heaven Fever (2011), the World Trade Center can be seen in the game exhibition match in a zoom out shot of the New York skyline.
