Measuring 28 centimetres (11&nbsp;inches) in diameter, it is at the Kunsthistorisches Museum (Museum of Art History), Vienna, Austria.\nThe baby's first halting steps parallel Christ struggling with the Cross on the obverse, while the whirligig in his hand alludes to the Cross itself.\nSee also\n* List of paintings by Hieronymus Bosch\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Christ child with a walking frame\n\n#REDIRECT Christ Child with a Walking Frame"
