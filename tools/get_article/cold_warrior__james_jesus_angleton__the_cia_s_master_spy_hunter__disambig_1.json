Babcock praised Mangold's research, calling his book \"a major revision in the history of American espionage,\" although he averred that the depiction of Angleton was \"one-dimensional.\" In The New York Times, Joseph Finder hailed Cold Warrior as \"fascinating and superbly researched,\" but stated that the work was unduly slanted against Angleton.\nRaymond L. Garthoff of the Brookings Institution stated that in regard to Angleton the book is the \"best and most complete and accurate account so far as one can tell.\" Intelligence scholar Gregory F. Treverton called Cold Warrior a \"commanding indictment\" of Angleton. CIA Chief Historian David Robarge stated that the book is \"the most factually detailed, thoroughly researched study of Angleton\" but also criticized what he described as \"sinister overtones and shallow psychologizing.\" Counterintelligence specialist Cleveland Cram highlighted Mangold's research and called Cold Warrior \"an honest and accurate book,\" although he lamented that much material had been cut from earlier drafts of the work.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n* \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20160303235333/http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/book-reviews/10286566/cold-warrior-james-jesus-angleton-c-i-a-s-master-spy-hunter-book COLD WARRIOR: JAMES JESUS ANGLETON, THE C.I.A.'s MASTER SPY HUNTER (Book)]\" (book review).
