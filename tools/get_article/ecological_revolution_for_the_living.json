Aymeric Caron expressed the view that  The Greens lost its legitimacy to take care of the ecological crisis by embracing capitalistic values of the market instead of focusing on what is actually important.\nFormerly named Ecological Union for the Living, the party adopted its actual name in 2020.\nIn the 2022 French legislative election, Aymeric Caron of the Ecological Revolution for the Living was elected to the National Assembly in the 18th constituency of Paris with the support of the New Ecological and Social People's Union alliance. Upon taking office, Caron, who became the party's sole Member of Parliament, chose to sit with the La France Insoumise group rather than as an independent.\nIdeology\nA self-described anti-speciesist and deep ecologist political party, REV emphasizes the rejection of the commodity status of animals.\nREV is an explicitly vegan political party claiming to refuse \"the exploitation and the slaughter of non-human animals to satisfy morbid and unnecessary food cravings.\"\nREV sets out four fundamental rights for non-human animals:\n* The right not to be killed.\n* The right not to be tortured.\n* The right not to be locked up.\n* The right not to be sold.\nTo achieve these rights, REV proposes the gradual closure of all meat farms, a ban on hunting and fishing, the closure of non-rehabilitative zoos and aquariums, prohibition of fur production and sale, and closure of pet stores in favor of non-kill animal shelters.\nOn economic issues, REV takes a social democratic and anti-consumerist stance. It advocates for a 28-hour working week, a strengthening of the national healthcare system, public banking, a tax on financial transactions, and a maximum income of €480,000 a year.\nAs an environmentalist political party, REV advocates for the transition to 100% renewable energy, followed by the gradual closure of all nuclear power plants. Additionally it advocates for free public transportation to incentivize low emission transit, a national ban on single-use plastics and the establishment of water as a common good and universal fundamental right, guaranteeing its free access for all.\nOn social issues, REV takes a pro-immigrant, secular and socially progressive stance. It calls for an end to police brutality, the equal status of men and women, LGBT acceptance, legalization of euthanasia, the creation of a legal route to the Schengen area, zero migrant deaths at European borders, and universal asylum for climate refugees.\nREV also calls for a reformed French democracy, calling for the abolition of the Senate and the office of the President, the replacement of ballotage with a proportional representation system, and limitations on the power of lobbies in the political system.\nOn foreign policy, REV calls for the creation of a global federal government either through the manifestation of a new internationalist organization, or through the reformation of the United Nations. Additionally, REV calls for the gradual abandonment of borders, international nuclear disarmament, the creation of an international regulatory body to ensure trade justice, and the cancelation of \"illegitimate debts\" owed to developed nations from the developing world.\nPresidential Elections of 2022\nIn January 2022, the REV joined the Parliament of the People's Union to support Jean-Luc Mélenchon's candidature. It participated in writing the program, mainly concerning animals' rights. Despite the program being less ambitious than what the REV advocates for outside of this alliance, it is still considered the most viable plan for ecology as a whole.\nLegislatives Elections of 2022\nDuring the Presidential Election, the REV negotiated an agreement with LFI in regard to the candidates and to avoid competing against each other. This agreement was to be upheld in the NUPES (New Social and Ecological People's Union) which is an electoral contract between the main four leftist parties.\nThe REV was to present 10 candidates in counties historically right-leaning. This situation ended with only one candidate elected : Aymeric Caron, the party's founder.\nEuropean Elections of 2024\nIn February 2024, the REV announced its alliance with La France Insoumise in order not to dilute votes any more than they actually were. Three members of the REV were candidates: Carine Sandon, Laura Vallée-Hans and Gregory Perche, respectively 11th, 55th and 66th on the list.\nThe People's Union came out of the election with 9 elected candidates, and thus no member of the REV was elected to the European Parliament.\nEuropean Parliament\n{| class=\"wikitable\"style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

During the discussion, it was decided the REV would present five candidates. Out of the five, Aymeric Caron was re-elected triumphantly without a second turn. Among the four others, only Victor Prandt went to a second turn but ended losing to a far-right candidate.\nSee also\n* List of political parties in France\n* List of animal advocacy parties\n* Animalist Party\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  [https://rev-parti.fr Official website]"
